Technological advances have improved orthopaedic implants and surgical techniques for bone reconstruction. However, improvements in surgical techniques to reconstruct bone have been limited by the paucity of autologous materials available and donor site morbidity. Recent advances in the development of biomaterials have provided attractive alternatives to bone grafting expanding the surgical options for restoring the form and function of injured bone. Specifically, novel bioactive (second generation) biomaterials have been developed that are characterised by controlled action and reaction to the host tissue environment, whilst exhibiting controlled chemical breakdown and resorption with an ultimate replacement by regenerating tissue. Future generations of biomaterials (third generation) are designed to be not only osteoconductive but also osteoinductive, i.e. to stimulate regeneration of host tissues by combining tissue engineering and in situ tissue regeneration methods with a focus on novel applications. These techniques will lead to novel possibilities for tissue regeneration and repair. At present, tissue engineered constructs that may find future use as bone grafts for complex skeletal defects, whether from post-traumatic, degenerative, neoplastic or congenital/developmental \"origin\" require osseous reconstruction to ensure structural and functional integrity. Engineering functional bone using combinations of cells, scaffolds and bioactive factors is a promising strategy and a particular feature for future development in the area of hybrid materials which are able to exhibit suitable biomimetic and mechanical properties.

Its mineralised matrix consists of 1) an organic phase (mainly collagen, 35% dry weight) responsible for its rigidity, viscoelasticity and toughness; 2) a mineral phase of carbonated apatite (65% dry weight) for structural reinforcement, stiffness and mineral homeostasis; and 3) other non-collagenous proteins that form a microenvironment stimulatory to cellular functions (2) . Bone tissue exhibits a distinct hierarchical structural organization of its constituents on numerous levels including macrostructure (cancellous and cortical bone), microstructure (Harversian systems, osteons, single trabeculae), sub-microstructure (lamellae), nanostructure (fibrillar collagen and embedded minerals) and subnanostructure (molecular structure of constituent elements, such as mineral, collagen, and non-collagenous organic proteins) ( Figure 1 ) (3) . Macroscopically, bone consists of a dense hard cylindrical shell of cortical bone along the shaft of the bone that becomes thinner with greater distance from the centre of the shaft towards the articular surfaces. Cortical bone encompasses increasing amounts of porous trabecular bone (also called cancellous or spongy bone) at the proximal and distal ends to optimise articular load transfer (2) . In humans, trabecular bone has a porosity of 50-90% with an average trabecular spacing of around 1mm and an average density of approximately 0.2 g\u00b7cm -3 (4) (5) (6) .

The mechanical properties depend on the bone composition (porosity, mineralisation etc.) as well as the structural organisation (trabecular or cortical bone architecture, collagen fibre orientation, fatigue damage etc.) (11) . Collagen possesses a Young's modulus of 1-2 GPa and an ultimate tensile strength of 50-1 000 MPa, compared to the mineral hydroxyapatite which has a Young's modulus of ~130 GPa and an ultimate tensile strength of ~100 MPa.

The xenograft was reported to have become fully incorporated into the skull of the patient. In the 1800s, plaster of Paris (Calcium sulphate) was used to fill bone cavities in patients suffering from Tuberculosis (31). Attempts were also made to fill bone defects with cylinders made from ivory (32). In 1820 the German surgeon Phillips von Walters described the first clinical use of a bone autograft to reconstruct skull defects in patients after trepanation (33). Walters successfully repaired trepanation holes, following surgery to relieve intracranial pressure, with pieces of bone taken from the patient's own head.

Several procedures such as the use of hydrogen peroxide to macerate bone grafts (\"Kieler Span\") in the 1950s and 1960s to overcome antigenity were not successful (40) (41) . Today, bone substitute materials such as (bovine) bone chips are routinely used in clinical practice after being pretreated to remove antigen structures. However, due to the processing steps necessary to abolish antigenicity, most of these grafts do not contain viable cells or growth factors and are therefore inferior to viable autologous bone graft options. When allografts with living cells are transplanted, there is a risk of transmitting viral and bacterial infections: Transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human T-lymphozytic virus (HTLV), unspecified hepatitis, tuberculosis and other bacteria has been documented (mainly) for allografts (mainly from those containing viable cells) (42) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 270, "end": 274, "text": "(37)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 414, "end": 418, "text": "(38)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 419, "end": 423, "text": "(39)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 588, "end": 592, "text": "(40)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 593, "end": 597, "text": "(41)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1331, "end": 1335, "text": "(42)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Bone grafting and bone substitutes in the last 4 000 years"}, {"text": "As early as 1932, the work of the Swiss H.

Even though this statement was made more than 50 years ago, it still remains valid today, when bone is still the second most transplanted material, second only to blood. Worldwide more than 3.5 million bone grafts (either autografts or allografts) are performed each year (45) . Recent advances in technology and surgical pro-cedures have significantly increased the options for bone grafting material, with novel products designed to replace both the structural properties of bone, as well as promote faster integration and healing. The number of procedures requiring bone substitutes is increasing, and will continue to do so as the population ages and physical activity of the elderly population increases.

However, the available volume of autologous bone graft from a patient is limited and an additional surgical procedure is required to harvest the grafting material which is associated with a significant risk of donor site morbidity. 20-30% of autograft patients experience morbidity such as chronic pain or dysaesthesia at the graft-harvesting site (48) .

In 1986, Masquelet and colleagues (58) first described a new two-stage technique taking advantage of the body's immune response to foreign materials for bone reconstruction. The authors called it the 'concept of induced membranes' -soon to become known as the 'Masquelet technique': In a first step, a radical debridement of necrotic bone and soft tissue is followed by the filling of the defect site with a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) spacer and stabilisation with an external fixator. After the definitive healing of the soft tissue, a second procedure is performed 6-8 weeks later, when the PMMA spacer is removed and a morcellised cancellous bone graft (from the iliac crest) is inserted into the cavitiy (59-60). The cement spacer was initially thought to prevent the collapse of the soft tissue into the bone defect and to prepare the space for bone reconstruction. However, it was soon discovered that the PMMA spacer does not only serve as a place holder, but that a foreign body reaction to the spacer also induces the formation of a membrane that possesses highly desirable properties for bone regeneration (60-61): The induced membrane was shown to be richly vascularised in all layers; the inner membrane layer (facing the cement) composed of synovial like epithelium and the out part is made from fibroblasts, myoblasts and collagen. The induced membrane has also been shown to secrete various growth factors in a time-dependent manner: High concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as well as transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF \u03b2) are secreted as early as the second week after implantation of the PMMA spacer; bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) concentration peaks at the fourth week. The induced membrane stimulates the prolifera-tion of bone marrow cells and differentiation towards an osteoblastic lineage. Finally, clinical experience has shown that the cancellous bone inside the induced membrane is not subject to resorption by the body. Ever since its introduction the 'induced membrane'-technique has been used very successfully in various clinical cases (see (59) and references therein). However, the Masquelet technique still requires the harvesting of an autologous bone graft, and with that come all the potential aforementioned complications. Furthermore, the use of alternate bone substitute materials, such as hydroxyapatite tricalcium phosphate, in combination with the Masquelet technique has so far yielded results inferior to the use the Masquelet technique with autologous bone grafting material (59, 62) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 327, "end": 331, "text": "(57)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2439, "end": 2443, "text": "(59)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2888, "end": 2892, "text": "(59,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2893, "end": 2896, "text": "62)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Bone grafting and bone substitutes in the last 4 000 years"}, {"text": "Besides the Masquelet technique, a more recent innovation has also significantly improved the clinical approach to restoring bone defects. The development of the Reamer-Irrigator-Aspirator (RIA \u00a9 )-System (DePuy-Synthes) has given clinicians an alternative to iliac crest harvesting to retrieve bone grafting materials from patients: The RIA System provides irrigation and aspiration during intramedullay reaming, allowing the harvesting of finely morselised autologous bone and bone marrow for surgical procedures requiring bone grafting material (63). The RIA was initially developed to lower the intramedullary pressure during the reaming of long bones to reduce the risk of fat embolisms and pulmonary complications such as the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrom (ARDS), as well as to reduce local thermal necrosis of bone tissue (64) (65) . However, the finely morselised autologous bone and bone marrow that is collected by the RIA has been shown to be rich in stem cells, osteogenic cells and growth factors and has been recognized to be a suitable bone graft alternative to the iliac crest autograft tissue (66) (67) . Also, RIA enables the harvesting of larger bone graft volumes compared to the iliac crest (approx. 40 cm 3 for the femur and 33 cm 3 for the tibia) (48, 65) . Furthermore, the risk of complications from the harvesting procedure has been reduced significantly (RIA 6% vs. 19.37% for iliac crest autografts) (68) . Since its introduction, the indications for use of RIA have been further extended to include the treatment of postoperative osteomyelitis (69) and the harvesting of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (70) . The innovation driven by the RIA systems was so significant, that the Journal \"Injury\" has dedicated a complete issue to the data available on RIA and its applications recently (71) .

With the introduction of tissue engineering and its clinical application the regenerative medicine in 1993 (75) the modern day quest for BSMs has undergone a significant change. The limitations of current clinical approaches have necessitated the development of alternative bone repair techniques and have driven the development of scaffold-based tissue engineering strategies.

Due to poor vascularisation or low metabolic activity, the capacity of the surrounding tissue to eliminate the by-products may be low leading to a build up of the by-products thereby causing local temporary disturbances (97) : A massive in vivo release of acidic degradation by-products leading to inflammatory reactions has been reported for several (120) (121) (122) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 120, "end": 125, "text": "(118)", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 317, "end": 322, "text": "(119)", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 701, "end": 705, "text": "(97)", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 928, "end": 932, "text": "(97)", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 1059, "end": 1064, "text": "(120)", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 1065, "end": 1070, "text": "(121)", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 1071, "end": 1076, "text": "(122)", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Biocompatibility"}, {"text": "Another example is the increase of osmotic pressure or pH caused by local fluid accumulation or transient sinus formation from fibre reinforced polyglycolide pins used in orthopaedic applications (120) .

Therefore, it is important that the three dimensional Tissue Engineering Construct (TEC) is exposed at all times to sufficient quantities of neutral culture media when undertaking cell culture procedures, especially during the period where the mass loss of the polymer matrix occurs (97) .

The scaffold structure is expected to guide the development of new bone formation by promoting attachment, migration, proliferation and differentiation of bone cells. Parallel to tissue formation, the scaffold should also undergo degradation in order to allow for ultimate replacement of scaffold material with newly formed, tissue engineered bone. Furthermore, the scaffold is also responsible for (temporal) mechanical support and stability at the tissue engineering site until the new bone is fully matured and is able to withstand mechanical load. As a general rule, the scaffold material should be sufficiently robust to resist changes in shape resulting from the introduction of cells into the scaffold (each of which should capable of exerting tractional forces) and from wound contraction forces that would be evoked during tissue healing in vivo (79) . In order to achieve optimal results, it is therefore necessary to carefully balance the biomechanical properties of a scaffold with its degradation kinetics. A scaffold material has to be chosen that degrades and resorbs at a controlled rate, giving the TEC sufficient mechanical stability at all times, but at the same time allowing new in vivo formed bone tissue to substitute for its structure. Figure 3 depicts the interdependence of molecular weight loss and mass loss of a slow degrading composite scaffold and also shows the corresponding stages of tissue regeneration (80) . At the time of implantation the biomechanical properties of a scaffold should match the structural pro-perties of the tissue it is implanted into as closely as possible (124) . It should possess sufficient structural integrity for the period until the engineered tissue ingrowth has replaced the slowly disappearing scaffold matrix with regards to mechanical properties. In bone tissue engineering the degradation and resorption kinetics of the scaffold have to be controlled in such a way that the bioresorbable scaffold retains its physical properties for at least 6 months to enable cell and tissue remodelling to achieve stable biomechanical conditions and vascularisation at the defect site (97) . Apart from host anatomy and physiology, the type of tissue that is aimed to be engineered also has a profound influence on the degree of remodelling: in cancellous bone the remodelling takes 3-6 months, while cortical bone will take twice as long, approximately 6-12 months, to remodel (79) . Whether the TEC will be part of a load bearing or non-load bearing site will also significantly influence the needs for mechanical stability of the TEC as mechanical loading can directly affect the degradation behaviour as well (79) . Utilising orthopaedic implants to temporarily stabilise the defect area also influences the requirements for biomechanical stability of the TEC significantly (18, 125) . It is therefore crucial to meticulously select the scaffold material individually for each tissue engineering approach to tailor the mechanical properties and degradation kinetics exactly to the purpose of the specific TEC (97) .

The close proximity of the scale of these materials to the scale of natural bone composites makes the application of nanomaterials for bone tissue engineering a very promising strategy. Surfaces with nanometer topography can promote the availability of amino acid and proteins for cell adhesion to a great extent, for example, the adsorption of fibronectin and vitronectin [two proteins known to enhance osteoblast and bone forming cell function (129) ] can be significantly increased by decreasing the grain size on the scaffold/implant surface below 100 nm (130) . It has also been shown that calcium-mediated cell protein adsorption on nanophase material promotes unfolding of these proteins promoting bone cell adhesion and function (130) . Current literature supports the hypothesis that by creating surface topographies with characteristics that approximate the size of proteins, a certain control over protein adsorption and interactions will be possible. Since the surface characteristics regarding roughness, topography and surface chemistry are then transcribed via the protein layer into information that is comprehensible for the cells (127) , this will enable the fabrication of surface properties directly targeted at binding specific cell types. In vitro, osteoblast adhesion, proliferation and differentiation and calcium deposition is enhanced on nanomaterials with grain sizes less than 100 nm (130) (131) . The adherence of osteoblasts has been shown to increase up to threefold when the surface is covered with nanophase titanium particles instead of conventional titanium particles (132) .

To date, most synthetic biomaterials that have been shown to be osteoinductive contained calcium phosphate underlining the crucial role of calcium and phosphate in osteoinduction properties of biomaterials (142) . As summarised above, adequate porosity and pore size is crucial for bone tissue engineering scaffolds in order to allow sufficient vascularisation and enable a supply of body fluids throughout the TEC. Together with this nutrient supply, a release of calcium and phosphate ions from the biomaterial surface takes places and is believed to be the origin of bioactivity of calcium phosphate biomaterials (143) (144) (145) . This process is followed by the precipitation of a biological carbonated apatite layer (that contains calcium-, phosphate-and other ions such as magnesium as well as proteins and other organic compounds) that occurs when the concentration of calcium and phosphate ions has reached super saturation level in the vicinity of the implant (142, (146) (147) . This bone-like biological carbonated apatite layer is thought to be physiological trigger for stem cells to differentiate down the osteogenic lineage or could induce the release of growth factors that complement this process (142) . For biomaterials lacking calcium phosphate particles, the roughness of the surface is considered to act as a collection of nucleation sites for calcium phosphate precipitation from the hosts' body fluids, thereby forming a carbonated apatite layer.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 608, "end": 613, "text": "(142)", "ref_id": "BIBREF151"}, {"start": 1018, "end": 1023, "text": "(143)", "ref_id": "BIBREF152"}, {"start": 1024, "end": 1029, "text": "(144)", "ref_id": "BIBREF153"}, {"start": 1030, "end": 1035, "text": "(145)", "ref_id": "BIBREF154"}, {"start": 1373, "end": 1378, "text": "(142,", "ref_id": "BIBREF151"}, {"start": 1379, "end": 1384, "text": "(146)", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}, {"start": 1385, "end": 1390, "text": "(147)", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}, {"start": 1618, "end": 1623, "text": "(142)", "ref_id": "BIBREF151"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Surface Properties"}, {"text": "Comparing calcium phosphate (CaP) coated fibrous scaffolds (fibre diameter approx 50 \u03bcm) made from medical grade polycaprolactone (mPCL) with non-coated mPCL-scaffolds, we have shown that CaP-coating is beneficial for new bone formation in vitro, enhancing alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralisation within the scaffolds (148) . Interestingly, other research has shown that the implantation of highly soluble carbonated apatite ceramics alone did not result in bone induction in vivo (149) , suggesting that a relatively stable surface (e.g. through a composite material that contains a less soluble phase) is needed for the facilitation of bone formation as discussed above (see \"mechanical properties and degradation kinetics\"). Bone formation requires a stable biomaterial interface and therefore, too rapid in vivo dissolution of calcium phosphate materials has been shown to be unfavourable for the formation of new bone tissue (150) (151) .

The majority of these studies indicate the importance of pore structure in facilitating bone growth. Increase of porosity as well as pore size and spacing of pore interconnectivity has been found to positively influence bone formation in vivo, which is also correlated with scaffold surface area. Pore interconnections smaller than 100 \u03bcm were found to restrict vascular penetration and supplementation of a porous structure with macroscopic channels has been found to further enhance tissue penetration and bone formation (97, 158) . Interestingly, these results correlate well with the diameter of the physiological Haversian systems in bone tissue that possess an approximate diameter of more than 100 \u00b5m. The ability of new capillary blood vessels to grow into the TEC is also related to the pore size, thereby directly influencing the rate of ingrowth of newly formed bone tissue into the TEC: In vivo, larger pore sizes and higher porosity lead to a faster rate of neovascularisation, thereby promoting greater amounts of new bone formation via direct osteogenesis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 471, "end": 476, "text": "(157)", "ref_id": "BIBREF168"}, {"start": 1002, "end": 1006, "text": "(97,", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 1007, "end": 1011, "text": "158)", "ref_id": "BIBREF169"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Porosity and pore size"}, {"text": "In contrast, small pores favour hypoxic conditions and induce osteochondral formation before osteogenesis occurs (92) .

In addition, the rate of degradation is influenced by the porosity and pore size (for biodegradable scaffolds). A higher pore surface area enhances interaction of the scaffold materials with host tissue and can thereby accelerate degradation by macrophages via oxidation and/or hydrolysis (157) . Therefore, scaffolds fabricated from biomaterials with a high degradation rate should not have high porosities (>90%) in order to avoid compromise to the mechanical and structural integrity before adequate substitution by newly formed bone tissue. Scaffolds made from slowly degrading biomaterials with robust mechanical properties can, in contrast, be highly porous (157) . Table 4 illustrates mechanical properties and degradation kinetics in relation to the porosity for many commonly used composite scaffolds. This illustrates that there are a number of advantages and disadvantages associated with any changes made to the porosity or pore size of scaffolds. It is inevitable to find a balance between these pros and cons in order to tailor the scaffold properties ideally to the demands of the tissue engineering approach used. For comprehensive reviews on role of porosity and pore size in tissue engineering scaffolds, the reader is referred to two recently published reviews (157, 159) . It becomes clear that a multitude of factors have to be taken into account when designing and fabricating scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. However, it is beyond the scope of this review to present all of them in detail and a number of comprehensive reviews have been published recently on this topic (2, 5, 79, 97, 101, (160) (161) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 257, "end": 261, "text": "(79)", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 553, "end": 558, "text": "(157)", "ref_id": "BIBREF168"}, {"start": 928, "end": 933, "text": "(157)", "ref_id": "BIBREF168"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1549, "text": "(157,", "ref_id": "BIBREF168"}, {"start": 1550, "end": 1554, "text": "159)", "ref_id": "BIBREF170"}, {"start": 1863, "end": 1866, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1867, "end": 1869, "text": "5,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1870, "end": 1873, "text": "79,", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 1874, "end": 1877, "text": "97,", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 1878, "end": 1882, "text": "101,", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 1883, "end": 1888, "text": "(160)", "ref_id": "BIBREF171"}, {"start": 1889, "end": 1894, "text": "(161)", "ref_id": "BIBREF172"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 936, "end": 943, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "Porosity and pore size"}, {"text": "The three-dimensional design characteristics in combination with the material properties of a scaffold are crucial for bone tissue engineering purposes.

It is therefore necessary to exert strict control over the scaffold properties during the fabrication process. Conventional techniques for scaffold fabrication include solvent casting and particulate leaching, gas foaming, fibre meshes and fibre bonding, phase separation, melt molding, emulsion freeze drying, solution casting and freeze drying (162) . All of these techniques are subtractive in nature, meaning that parts of the fabricated scaffold are removed from the construct after the initial fabrication process in order to generate the desired three-dimensional characteristics. Hence a number of limitations exist regarding these fabrication methods: conventional methods do not allow a precise control over pore size, pore geometry, pore interconnectivity or spatial distribution of pores and interconnecting channels of the scaffolds fabricated (92, (163) (164) . In addition, many of these techniques require the application of organic solvents and their residues can impose severe adverse effects on cells due to their potentially toxic and/or carcinogenic nature, reducing the biocompatibility of the scaffold significantly (165) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1042, "end": 1047, "text": "(162)", "ref_id": "BIBREF173"}, {"start": 1553, "end": 1557, "text": "(92,", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1558, "end": 1563, "text": "(163)", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 1564, "end": 1569, "text": "(164)", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}, {"start": 1835, "end": 1840, "text": "(165)", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Additive manufacturing and Computer Aided Design -Game changers in the fabrication of three-dimensional scaffolds"}, {"text": "The introduction of additive manufacturing (AM) techniques into the field of bone tissue engineering has helped to overcome many of these restrictions (92, 162, 166) . In AM three-dimensional objects are created in a computer-controlled layer-by-layer fabrication process. In contrast to subtractive conventional methods of scaffold fabrication, this technique is additive in nature and does not involve removal of materials after the initial fabrication step. These techniques have also been named \"rapid prototyping\" or \"solid free form fabrication\" in the past, but in order to clearly distinguish them from conventional methods the latest ASTM standard now summarises all of these techniques under the term \"Additive Manufacturing\" (167) . The basis for each AM process is the design of a three-dimensional digital or in silico model of the scaffold to be produced. This computer model can either be created from scratch using \"computer aided design\" (CAD) methods or can be generated using data from a 3D-scan of existing three-dimensional structures (such as the human skeleton) (168) . The digital model is then converted into an STL-file that expresses the three-dimensional structure as the summary of multiple horizontal two-dimensional planes. Using this STL-file an AM-machine then creates the three-dimensional scaffold structure in a layer-bylayer fabrication method in which each layer is tightly connected to the previous layer to create a solid object. A number of different AM techniques are currently applied using thermal, chemical, mechanical and/or optical processes to create the solid three-dimensional object (166) . These methods include laser-based methods such as Stereolithography (STL) and Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), printing-based applications (e.g. 3D-Printing, Wax-Printing) and Nozzle-based systems like Melt Extrusion/ Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and Bioplotting.

With recent technical advances AM is nowadays applied to make custom-made implants and surgical tools (175) and to fabricate highly detailed, custom-made three-dimensional models for the indivi-dual patient (using data from CT, MRI, SPECT etc.) to plan surgical approaches, specifically locate osteotomy sites, choose the correct implant and to predict functional and cosmetic outcomes of surgeries (176) (177) .

AM technologies have relatively few process steps and involve little manual interaction, therefore, three-dimensional parts can be manufactured in hours and days instead of weeks and months. The direct nature of AM allows the economical production of customized tissue engineering scaffolds. The products can be tailored to match the patient's needs and still sustain economic viability as compared to traditional techniques which must manufacture great numbers of devices.

AM methods reduce the design constraints and enable the fabrication of desired delicate features both inside and outside the scaffold.

This is a significant benefit, since incomplete removal of solvents may lead to harmful residues that can affect adherence of cells, activity of incorporated biological agents or surrounding tissues as already described. AM allows the control of scaffold porosity leading to the applications that may have areas of greater or lesser structural integrity and areas of encouraged blood flow due to increased porosity. Fabricating devices and/or implants with differences in spatial distribution of porosities, pore sizes, mechanical and chemical properties can mimic the complex composition and architecture of natural bone tissue and thereby optimise bone tissue engineering techniques. In addition, scaffolds with gradients in porosity and pore sizes can be functionalised to allow vascularisation and direct osteogenesis in one area of the scaffold, while promoting osteochondral ossification in the other, which is an appealing approach to reproduce multiple tissues and tissue interfaces within one and the same biomaterial scaffold (157) .

In addition, the impact of musculoskeletal conditions is predicted to grow with the increasing incidence of lifestyle-related obesity, reduced physical fitness and increased road traffic accidents (180) . The impact of bone trauma is significant-the consequences of failing to restore full function to an injured limb are dramatically demonstrated by the statistic that only 28% of patients suffering from severe open fractures of the tibia are able to resume full function and hence return to previous employment (180) .

At the beginning of 2001, tissue engineering research and development was being pursued by 3 300 scientists and support staff in more than 70 start-up companies or business units with a combined annual expenditure of over $600 million USD (182) . The US National Institutes of Health (NIH), accounting for the largest cumulative US federal research expenditures, has increased the funding in tissue engineering from 2.36 billion USD in the fiscal year 2003 to more than 614 billion USD for the fiscal year 2006 (183) . Between 2000 and 2008 the number of papers published on tissue engineering and scaffolds per year increased by more than 400% and more than 900%, respectively (184) .

As Scott J. Hollister has pointed out, there is, on the one hand, a stark contrast between the amount of tissue engineering research expenditures over the last 20 years and the resulting numbers of products and sales figures. On the other hand, there is also a significant discrepancy between the complexities of intended tissue engineering therapies compared to the actual therapies that have reached clinical applications (184) . This evident gap between research and clinical application/commercialisation is commonly termed the \"Valley of Death\" due to the large number of ventures that \"die\" between scientific technology development and actual commercialization due to lack of funds ( Figure 4 ) (184) . The Valley of Death is particularly large for tissue engineering approaches because this field of research often utilises immensely cost intensive high-tech biotechnologies for technological development eating up large parts of the funding available, but then additionally faces the challenges of funding large scale preclinical studies and clinical studies to gain approval by regulatory bodies, demonstrate product safety and gain clinical acceptance (184) (185) (186) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 396, "end": 401, "text": "(182)", "ref_id": "BIBREF195"}, {"start": 668, "end": 673, "text": "(183)", "ref_id": "BIBREF196"}, {"start": 835, "end": 840, "text": "(184)", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 1564, "end": 1569, "text": "(184)", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 1842, "end": 1847, "text": "(184)", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 2303, "end": 2308, "text": "(184)", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 2309, "end": 2314, "text": "(185)", "ref_id": "BIBREF198"}, {"start": 2315, "end": 2320, "text": "(186)", "ref_id": "BIBREF199"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1831, "end": 1839, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Translating bone tissue engineering strategies from bench to bedside"}, {"text": "To bridge the gap between the bench and bedside, the scaffold is required to perform as a developmentally conducive extracellular niche, at a clinically relevant scale and in concordance with strict clinical (economic and manufacturing) prerequisites ( Figure 5 ) (187) .

For large and high-load bearing defects the scaffold can also deliver cells and/or growth factors to the site of damage and provides an appropriate template for new tissue formation. The scaffold should thus constitute a dynamically long-lasting yet degradable three-dimensional architecture, preferably serving as a functional tissue substitute which, over time, can be replaced by cell-derived tissue function. Designing and manufacturing processes are believed to be the gatekeepers to translate tissue engineering research into clinical tissue engineering applications and concentration on the development of these entities will enable scaffolds to bridge the gap between research and clinical practice (184) . One of the greatest difficulties in bridging the Valley of Death is to develop good manufacturing processes and scalable designs and to apply these in preclinical studies; for a description of the rationale and road map of how our multidisciplinary research team has addressed this first step to translate orthopaedic bone engineering from bench to bedside see below and refer to our recent publication (185) . In order to take bone tissue engineering approaches from bench to bedside, it also imperative to meticulously assess the clinical demands for specific scaffold characteristics to achieve a broad and optimised range of clinical applications for the specific tissue engineering approach. A sophisticated bone tissue engineering technology will not necessarily have multiple clinical applications just because of its level of complexity, and defining specific clinical target applications remains one of the most underestimated challenges in the bridging the Valley of Death (184) . There is often a great level of discrepancy between the clinical demands on a tissue engineering technique and the scientific realisation of such technique, hampering the clinical translation. Thus a scaffold that is realistically targeted at bridging the Valley of Death should (187): (i) meet FDA approval (for further details on this topics see reviews by Scott J. Hollister 2011 and 2009) (184, 189) ; (ii) allow for cost effective manufacturing processes; (iii) be sterilisable by industrial techniques; (iv) enable easy handling without extensive preparatory procedures in the operation theatre; (v) preferably, be radiographically distinguishable from newly formed tissue; and (vi) allow minimally invasive implantation (190) (191) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 264, "end": 269, "text": "(187)", "ref_id": "BIBREF200"}, {"start": 423, "end": 428, "text": "(188)", "ref_id": "BIBREF201"}, {"start": 1138, "end": 1143, "text": "(184)", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 1549, "end": 1554, "text": "(185)", "ref_id": "BIBREF198"}, {"start": 2129, "end": 2134, "text": "(184)", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 2530, "end": 2535, "text": "(184,", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 2536, "end": 2540, "text": "189)", "ref_id": "BIBREF202"}, {"start": 2864, "end": 2869, "text": "(190)", "ref_id": "BIBREF203"}, {"start": 2870, "end": 2875, "text": "(191)", "ref_id": "BIBREF204"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 253, "end": 261, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Bridging the gap between tissue engineering research and clinical applications"}, {"text": "In targeting the translation of a (bone) tissue engineering approach from bench to bedside, there is a distinct hierarchy and sequence of the type of studies that need to be undertaken to promote the translation process (192) : Having identified clinical needs and based on fun- damental discoveries regarding biological mechanisms, a novel tissue engineering approach is designed and first studies are undertaken to characterise mechanical and chemical properties of the TEC to be used. The next step involves feasibility and bioactivity testing and should be carried out in vitro and in vivo. In vitro assays using cell culture preparations are used to characterise the effects of materials on isolated cell function and for screening large numbers of compounds for biological activity, toxicity and immunogenicity (193) (194) . However, due to their nature using isolated cells, in vitro models are unavoidably limited in their capacity to reflect complex in vivo environments that the TEC will be exposed to and are therefore inadequate to predict in vivo or clinical performances. Therefore, in vivo models (that is animal models) are required in order to overcome the limitations of in vitro models to provide a reproducible approximation of the real life situation. In vivo feasibility testing is almost exclusively done in small animals, mainly in rodents and rabbits (192, (195) (196) (197) . The advantages of small animal models include relatively easy standardisation of experimental conditions, fast bone turnover rates (=shorter periods of observation), similar lamellar bone architecture and similar cancellous bone thinning and fragility, similar remodelling rates and sites, common availability and relatively low costs for housing and maintenance. Disadvantages of rodent and rabbit models include different skeletal loading patterns, open epiphyses at various growth plates up to the age of 12-14 months (or for lifetime in rats), minimal intra-cortical remodelling, the lack of Harversian canal systems, a smaller proportion of cancellous bone to total bone mass and their relatively small size for testing of implants (196) . Whilst a large number of studies in rodents and rabbits have established proof of concept for bone tissue engineering strategies, scaling up to larger, more clinically relevant animal models has presented new challenges. Quoting Thomas A. Einhorn, when conducting animal studies, one has to keep in mind that \"in general, the best model system is the one which most closely mimics the clinical situation for which this technology is being developed, will not heal spontaneously unless the technology is used, and will not heal when another technology is used if that technology is less advanced than the one being tested\" (198) . The most effective animal models will therefore 1) provide close resemblance of the clinical and biological environment and material properties, 2) encompass highly standardised measurement methods providing objective parameters (qualitative and quantitative) to investigate the newly formed bone tissue and 3) are able to detect and predict significant differences between the bone tissue engineering methods investigated (192) . For clinical modelling and efficacy prediction of the tissue engineering strategy to be translated into clinical application, up-scaling to large animal models is therefore inevitable. Thereby, the tissue engineering therapy can be delivered in the same (or similar) way in which it will be delivered in clinical settings utilising surgical techniques that match (or closely resemble) clinical methods at the site that matches the setting in which it will be used later as closely as possible (192) . The advantage of large animal models (using nonhuman primates, dogs, cats, sheep, goats, pigs) is the closer resemblance of microarchitecture, bone physiology and biomechanical properties in humans. They encompass a well-developed Haversian and trabecular bone remodelling, have greater skeletal surface to volume areas, show similar skeletal disuse atrophy, enable the use of implants and techniques similar to the ones used in humans and show highly localised bone fragility associated with stress shielding by implants. However, the use of large animal models has disadvantages as well, including the high cost and maintenance expenses, extensive housing and space requirements, relatively long life spans and lower bone turnover rates (making longer study periods necessary), difficulties in standardisation to generate large, homogenous samples for statistical testing as well as various ethical concerns depending on the species used (e.g. primates) (196) . But despite several disadvantages, it is inevitable to perform the final pre-clinical in large animals, as realistically as possible, with relevant loading conditions and with similar surgical techniques as used in the final procedure in humans (197) . Large animal models provide mass and volume challenges for scaffold-based tissue engineering and require surgical fixation techniques that cannot be tested either in vitro or in small animal models (184) . In general, preclinical translation testing is performed in large skeletally mature animals, the species most utilised are dog, sheep, goat and pig (192, 199) . If sufficient preclinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of the new bone tissue engineering system has been generated utilising large animal models, clinical trials care undertaken to prove clinical significance and safety, ultimately leading to the translation of the technology into routine clinical practice.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 220, "end": 225, "text": "(192)", "ref_id": "BIBREF205"}, {"start": 817, "end": 822, "text": "(193)", "ref_id": "BIBREF206"}, {"start": 823, "end": 828, "text": "(194)", "ref_id": "BIBREF207"}, {"start": 1376, "end": 1381, "text": "(192,", "ref_id": "BIBREF205"}, {"start": 1382, "end": 1387, "text": "(195)", "ref_id": "BIBREF208"}, {"start": 1388, "end": 1393, "text": "(196)", "ref_id": "BIBREF209"}, {"start": 1394, "end": 1399, "text": "(197)", "ref_id": "BIBREF210"}, {"start": 2139, "end": 2144, "text": "(196)", "ref_id": "BIBREF209"}, {"start": 2769, "end": 2774, "text": "(198)", "ref_id": "BIBREF211"}, {"start": 3200, "end": 3205, "text": "(192)", "ref_id": "BIBREF205"}, {"start": 3701, "end": 3706, "text": "(192)", "ref_id": "BIBREF205"}, {"start": 4665, "end": 4670, "text": "(196)", "ref_id": "BIBREF209"}, {"start": 4918, "end": 4923, "text": "(197)", "ref_id": "BIBREF210"}, {"start": 5124, "end": 5129, "text": "(184)", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 5280, "end": 5285, "text": "(192,", "ref_id": "BIBREF205"}, {"start": 5286, "end": 5290, "text": "199)", "ref_id": "BIBREF212"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Rationale for translating bone tissue engineering strategies into clinical applications"}, {"text": "Taking composite scaffold based bone tissue engineering from bench to bedside In accordance with the above outline rationale for translating bone tissue engineering research into clinical applications, during the last decade our interdisciplinary research team has focussed on the bench to bedside translation of a bone tissue engineering concept based on slowly biodegradable composite scaffolds made from medical grade polycaprolactone (mPCL) and calcium phosphates [hydroxyapatite (HA) and tricalcium phosphate (TCP)] (80, 200) .

Our research group at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT; Brisbane, Australia) has spent the last 5 years developing a world-leading defect model to study pre-clinically different treatment options for cases of large volume segmental bone loss (159, 210) . We have successfully established this 3 cm critical-sized defect model in sheep tibiae to study the mPCL-TCP scaffold in combination with cells or growth factors including bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) (211) (212) . This model has not only generated a series of highly cited publications (211) (212) (213) (214) (215) , but also has attracted large interest in the orthopaedic industry to be used as a preclinical test bed for their bone graft products under development. The model enables control of experimental conditions to allow for direct comparison of products against a library of benchmarks and gold standards we have developed over the last 5 years (we have performed more than 200 operations using this model todate). Our preclinical tibial defect model developed at QUT is one of the only available models internationally, which is suitable from both reproducibility and cost point of view for the evaluation of large segmental defect repair technologies in statistically powered study designs. We have chosen this critical sized segmental defect model of the tibia for our large animal model because tibial fractures represent the most common long bone fractures in humans and are often associated with significant loss of bone substance (216) (217) . Also, tibial fractures result in high rates of non-unions or pseudarthroses (216, 218) . From an orthopaedic surgeons point of view it can be argued that amongst all bone defects seen in the clinical practice, segmental defects of the tibia are often the most challenging graft sites. This owes to the grafts being required to bear loads close to physiological levels very soon after implantation, this is despite internal fixation, which often provides the necessary early stability, but also suffers from the poor soft tissue coverage (vascularisation issue) of the tibia compared to the femur. Hence, in a bone engineering strategy for the treatment of segmental tibial defects, the scaffold must bear (or share) substantial loads immediately after implantation. The scaffold's mechanical properties (strength, modulus, toughness, and ductility) are determined both by the material properties of the bulk material and by its structure (macrostructure, microstructure, and nanostructure). Matching the mechanical properties of a scaffold to the tibial graft environment is critically important so that progression of tissue healing is not limited by mechanical failure of the scaffold prior to successful tissue regeneration. Similarly, because mechanical signals are important mediators of the differentiation of cell progenitors, a scaffold must create an appropriate stress environment throughout the site where new tissue is desired. Hence, one of the greatest challenges in scaffold design for load bearing tibial defects is the control of the mechanical properties of the scaffold over time. By trialing our bone tissue engineering strategies in a tibial defect model, we will therefore address a highly relevant clinical problem and are creating valuable pre-clinical evidence for the translation from bench to bedside. With the 3 cm critical defect being regenerated successfully by applying our mPCL-TCP scaffold in combination with BMP (102), we are now investigating bone regeneration potentials in even larger sized tibial defects ( Figure 6 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 539, "end": 544, "text": "(159,", "ref_id": "BIBREF170"}, {"start": 545, "end": 549, "text": "210)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 757, "end": 762, "text": "(211)", "ref_id": "BIBREF225"}, {"start": 763, "end": 768, "text": "(212)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 843, "end": 848, "text": "(211)", "ref_id": "BIBREF225"}, {"start": 849, "end": 854, "text": "(212)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 855, "end": 860, "text": "(213)", "ref_id": "BIBREF228"}, {"start": 861, "end": 866, "text": "(214)", "ref_id": "BIBREF229"}, {"start": 867, "end": 872, "text": "(215)", "ref_id": "BIBREF230"}, {"start": 1806, "end": 1811, "text": "(216)", "ref_id": "BIBREF231"}, {"start": 1812, "end": 1817, "text": "(217)", "ref_id": "BIBREF232"}, {"start": 1896, "end": 1901, "text": "(216,", "ref_id": "BIBREF231"}, {"start": 1902, "end": 1906, "text": "218)", "ref_id": "BIBREF233"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3867, "end": 3875, "text": "Figure 6", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "Rationale for translating bone tissue engineering strategies into clinical applications"}, {"text": "Spinal fusion has been investigated in animal models for one hundred years now and a lot of the knowledge we have today on how spinal fusion progresses was gained through animal models (219) (220) .

Also, sheep spines allow for an evaluation of the success of the study using fusion assessments commonly used in clinical practice. When considering spinal fusion in large animal models, it is apparent that due to the biomechanical properties of the spine a biped primate animal model [such as in (221) ] should ideally preferred over a quadruped large animal model [for example ovine (222) or porcine (223) ]. But given the expenses and limited availability of primate testing as well as ethical concerns due to the close phylogenical relation, it is more feasible to trial large numbers of scaffold variations in the most appropriate quadruped large animal models and then evaluate the best performing scaffold in a primate model, if possible (184) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 185, "end": 190, "text": "(219)", "ref_id": "BIBREF234"}, {"start": 191, "end": 196, "text": "(220)", "ref_id": "BIBREF235"}, {"start": 819, "end": 824, "text": "(221)", "ref_id": "BIBREF236"}, {"start": 907, "end": 912, "text": "(222)", "ref_id": "BIBREF237"}, {"start": 924, "end": 929, "text": "(223)", "ref_id": "BIBREF238"}, {"start": 1267, "end": 1272, "text": "(184)", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Minimally-invasive ovine thoracic spine fusion model"}, {"text": "We have outlined above that defining specific clinical target applications is a critical prerequisite for successful bone tissue engineering research that is meant to be translated into clinical practice.

Autologous bone grafting is still the gold standard to achieve spinal fusion and superior to other bone grafts for spinal fusion (227) (228) (229) . Nonetheless, the use of autologous bone grafting material has significant risks as outlined in detail above. A number of animal models for the use of tissue-engineered bone constructs in spinal fusion exists (230) and the use of bone morphogenetic proteins for spinal fusion has been studied extensively (219, 222, (231) (232) .

We have been able to show that radiological and histological results at 6-months post surgery indicated had comparable grades of fusion and evidenced new bone formation for the mPCL-CaP scaffolds plus rhBMP-2 and autograft groups. The scaffold alone group, however, had lower grades of fusion in comparison to the other two groups.

Although the clinical translation of these approaches has not taken place on a large scale yet, bone tissue engineering clearly holds the potential to overcome historic limitations and disadvantages associated with the use of the current gold-standard autologous bone graft. Optimizing combinations of cells, scaffolds, and locally and systemically active stimuli will remain a complex process characterized by a highly interdependent set of variables with a large range of possible variations. Consequently, these developments must also be nurtured and monitored by a combination of clinical experience, knowledge of basic biological principles, medical necessity, and commercial practicality. The responsibility for rational development is shared by the entire orthopaedic community (developers, vendors, and physicians). The need for objective and systematic assessment and reporting is made particularly urgent by the recent rapid addition of many new options for clinical use. By applying a complex interplay of 21st century technologies from various disciplines of scientific research, the gap between bone tissue engineering research and the translation into clinically available bone tissue engineering applications can successfully be bridged.
