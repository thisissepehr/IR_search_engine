The disease most often affects young adults (aged 15-30 years [2]; 20-40 years [1]), with a second peak occurring in individuals aged[55 years [1, 2] . There are two main types of HL, namely classical HL (accounts for 95% of cases; focus of this review) and nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL [1, 2] . Classical HL is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, with these cells consistently expressing the cell membrane receptors CD30 and CD15 [1, 2] .

Given the nature of the disease, brentuximab vedotin therapy was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, with most common adverse events (such as peripheral neuropathy and neutropenia) manageable with dose reductions and/or delays and the majority of patients with peripheral neuropathy experiencing improvement or complete resolution of symptoms [38] . The most common adverse reactions (i.e. incidence C20%) occurring during brentuximab vedotin salvage or consolidation therapy were neutropenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN), fatigue, nausea, anaemia, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), diarrhoea, thrombocytopaenia and cough [19] . In addition, pyrexia, rash and vomiting were common adverse reactions with brentuximab vedotin salvage therapy, and peripheral motor neuropathy was a common adverse reaction during consolidation treatment with brentuximab vedotin [19] In the noncomparative pivotal phase 2 trial in patients with relapsed or refractory HL, the most common (i.e. incidence C15%) brentuximab vedotin-related adverse events of any grade were PSN (incidence 42%), nausea (35%), fatigue (34%), neutropenia (19%) and diarrhoea (18%) [24] . Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of grade 3 or 4 severity occurred in 55% of patients. TEAEs of grade 3 severity occurring in at least 2% of patients were neutropenia (14%), PSN (8%), fatigue (2%) and pyrexia (2%).

The initial treatment intensity should reflect the clinical stage and the presence or absence of clinical risk factors [1, 2], with the use of risk-adapted therapy resulting in excellent cure rates irrespective of the HL stage at the time of diagnosis [1]. Prognostic factors for adverse outcomes include aged C45 years, male gender, stage IV disease, albumin level of B4 g/dL, haemoglobin level of \\10.5 g/dL, leucocytosis [i.e. white blood cell (WBC) count [15,000/mm 3 ] and lymphoctyopenia (i.e. lymphocyte count \\8% of the WBC count and/or lymphocytes \\600/mm 3 ) [2]. Initial chemotherapy typically involves ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine plus dacarbazine) [1, 2], BEACOPPescalated (bleomycin, etoposide, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) [1, 2] or Stanford V [doxorubicin, vinblastine, vincristine, bleomycin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide (or mechlorethamine or ifosfamide), prednisone] [2]. However, dependent on the stage of the disease, a significant proportion of patients relapse or are refractory to initial therapy (Sect. 1). The general treatment of choice in these patients is HDCT followed by ASCT (\u00b1radiotherapy) [1, 2]. Prior to HDCT/ASCT, patients receive salvage regimens (e.g. ICE) to reduce the tumour burden and mobilise stem cells prior to HDCT and ASCT [1]. Brentuximab vedotin is recommended as an option for patients with relapsed or refractory classical HL who have failed HDCT/ASCT or at least two prior chemotherapy regimens (irrespective of their eligibility for HDCT/ASCT [2]) [1, 2]. The approval of brentuximab vedotin as consolidation therapy after ASCT (Sect. 6) is too recent for it to have been considered in 2014 ESMO [1] and NCCN [2] guidelines.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "Acknowledgements During the peer review process, the manufacturer of brentuximab vedotin was offered an opportunity to review this article.
