Infected patients can produce virus-bearing droplets by sneezing, coughing, or even breathing (e.g., Settles 2006) . Observations indicate that coughs and sneezes produce ejecta that are well described as a multiphase, turbulent cloud comprising hot, moist air and suspended droplets (Bourouiba et al. 2012 (Bourouiba et al. , 2014 . A theoretical model describing the evolution of the cloud was developed by Bourouiba et al. (2014) and validated against experiments. The turbulent gas-phase dynamics were shown to be critical in enhancing the range of the smaller suspended droplets by delaying their exit from the cloud. This model can be used to assess contamination ranges in various environmental conditions. Inputs for this model include the volume fraction of liquid to gaseous phases and the droplet size distribution. The droplet size spans the micrometer and millimeter scales, but no consensus on the size distribution can be found in the literature. The techniques for measuring expiratory droplet size distributions have included enumeration on glass slides (Duguid 1946) , optical counting (Papineni and Rosenthal 1997) , aerodynamic droplet sizing (Johnson et al. 2011) , interferometric Mie imaging (Morawska et al. 2009 ), scanning mobility droplet sizing (Yang et al. 2007) , and laser diffraction (Zayas et al. 2012) . Despite these efforts, discrepancies persist between the reported size spectra. The variability in the composition and physical properties of the ejected salivary mucus is also a major source of uncertainty for all inferences relying on optical characteristics and evaporation rates based on pure water.",

            "text": "Abstract Coughs and sneezes feature turbulent, multiphase flows that may contain pathogen-bearing droplets of mucosalivary fluid. As such, they can contribute to the spread of numerous infectious diseases, including influenza and SARS. The range of contamination of the droplets is largely determined by their size. However, major uncertainties on the drop size distributions persist. Here, we report direct observation of the physical mechanisms of droplet formation at the exit of the mouth during sneezing. Specifically, we use high-speed imaging to directly examine the fluid fragmentation at the exit of the mouths of healthy subjects. We reveal for the first time that the breakup of the fluid into droplets continues to occur outside of the respiratory tract during violent exhalations. We show that such breakup involves a complex cascade of events from sheets, to bag bursts, to ligaments, which finally break into droplets. Finally, we reveal that the viscoelasticity of the mucosalivary fluid plays an important role in delaying fragmentation by causing the merger of the droplet precursors that form along stretched filaments; thereby affecting the final drop size distribution farther downstream. Hydrodynamic instabilities of fluid films at or near the exit of the respiratory tract are expected to play a critical role in setting the size distribution of the ejecta. Such fluid fragmentation phenomena are found in industrial applications (Villermaux 2007) . In such settings, while the precise form of fluid fragmentation generally depends on the details of the source conditions, it has been reported to involve a cascade to smaller scales, from a fluid volume to sheets, ligaments, and, finally, droplets (Eggers and Villermaux 2008) . Relative to industrial flows, the fluid dynamics of violent expirations remains poorly understood. To gain insight into the physics selecting the dominant droplet sizes emitted, we directly image the emissions of droplets with high-speed videography. In Sect. 2, we discuss the possible physical mechanisms involved in the fluid fragmentation accompanying such violent expirations. The experimental setup and the results of our visualization of real human sneezes are presented in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, we describe the anatomy of sneeze ejecta in more detail, with a focus on the type of fragmentation processes leading to droplets.",

            "text": "Sneezing and coughing are often caused by an irritation of the nose and then trachea, respectively; this leads to nerve stimulation and the resulting reflex action (James and Burgh 1969) . It has been reported that the respiratory changes in a sneeze are analogous to those of a cough, except for the timing of the different phases (Widdicombe 1979) . In particular, both a sneeze and a cough consist of an initial irritation, a closure of the glottis, and a rapid increase in intrathoracic pressure. Following the re-opening of the glottis, air is expelled at high flow rates (Banner 1986 ). For the sneeze, the pharynx also seems to be constricted (Widdicombe 1979) ; however, the subsequent dynamics remain poorly understood relative to those of the cough. Within the airway system, sneezes and coughs consist of fast airflows interacting with relatively slow moving, thin fluid layers. The majority of the studies of drop size measurement (e.g., Zayas et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2007; Morawska et al. 2009 ) focus on coughing, talking, or respiration. Turner et al. (1941) used single flash photographs to record sneezes using a dark field imaging setup and highlighted parts of the complex nature of such emissions. Duguid (1946) also studied sneezing; however, the sneeze dynamics examined were presumably altered by the subjects' ingestion of a dyed solution used for flow visualization.",

In this complex geometry, it is assumed that a combination of Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities can result in the destabilization of these layers into droplets. Such instabilities involve surface tension, viscous, and aerodynamic forces, the relative magnitudes of which determine the final size of the resulting pathogen-bearing droplets. Surface tension and fluid viscosity generally favor larger droplets, while higher air speeds tend to result in smaller droplets. The liquid phase of interest in this problem is a mixture of saliva and mucus, the relative fraction of which is a function of the location within the respiratory tract. Reported physical properties of saliva are close to those of water with density \u03c1 = 1000 kg/m 3 , dynamic viscosity \u00b5 = 1 mPas, and surface tension of \u03c3 = 60 m/N m (Schipper et al. 2007; Stokes and Davies 2007) . These fluids are mostly composed of water (97 %) and contain other agents such as salts, proteins, and fatty acids (Bansil and Turner 2006) . They are viscoelastic because of the dissolved large glycoprotein mucins or biopolymers they contain (e.g., MUC5B (Dekker et al. 2002) ). The relaxation times reported for mucosalivary fluids are 2.24 ms \u2264 \u2264 76.2 ms (Haward et al. 2011; Kesimer et al. 2010; Raynal et al. 2002) .

In the subsequent phase, when the polymers become sufficiently stretched, they resist the surface-tension-driven breakup that would occur via the Rayleigh-Plateau instability in a Newtonian fluid. Instead, filament stretching can be accompanied by the beads-on-a-string structure, which arises when a balance of inertial, capillary, viscous, and elastic forces is achieved (Bhat et al. 2010 ). Beads on a string are a clear indicator of the influence of viscoelasticity and play a key role in selecting final sizes of the droplets. The Deborah number De quantifies the effect of viscoelasticity by prescribing the relative magnitude of the polymer relaxation time and timescale of fragmentation \u03c4, De = /\u03c4. In our experiments, we observed typical mucosalivary ligaments of diameter ranging from 0.409 to 0.952 mm. For such sizes, the capillary time ranges from \u03c4 = \u03c1d 3 /\u03c3 = 0.97 to 3.40 ms, leading to 0.65 \u2264 De \u2264 78.73. Other values reported in the literature on saliva include 0.004 \u2264 De = /\u03c4 \u2264 0.5 (Bhat et al. 2010) .",

Villermaux and Bossa (2009) and Reyssat et al. (2007) provide a detailed analysis of the dynamics of fluid bags. Typically, a volume of liquid subjected to a net air flow in a particular direction is deformed by differential aerodynamic pressure that tends to flatten the volume into a sheet that expands as it is swept downstream (Fig. 1) . The fluid is then transformed by the aerodynamic pressure into a bag structure that expands and thins until it becomes unstable and ruptures. The resulting holes expand at the Taylor-Culick speed (Taylor 1959; Culick 1960) . As the holes grow and the liquid shell destabilizes, ligaments form perpendicular to the bag rim surface due to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability of the rim and are stretched (Lhuissier and Villermaux 2012; Scharfman et al. 2013 ). These ligaments then eventually break into droplets via Rayleigh-Plateau-type instabilities (see Fig. 1 ).",

The comparison of the two figures (Figs. 3, 4) suggests caution when generalizing the features of coughs to sneezes as is often done in the literature. In particular, it is clear that sneezes induce a fragmentation process that continues outside of the respiratory tract. Given that sneezes have received less attention in the literature, we now focus on characterizing their ejecta in greater detail. In order to characterize further the fluid breakup and estimate the effect of viscoelasticity on this process, we examine Fig. 6 in more detail. There, a dense field of sneeze ejecta is imaged both from the top and side. The side and top views were recorded at 8000 and 2000 fps with synchronized start times. The total duration of the sneeze was 134.5 ms with an estimated Reynolds number for the gas cloud of Re G = 10 5 .

The resolution of the raw images in Figs 7, 8, 9 has been increased using a leastsquares approximation for display purposes (Munoz et al. 2001 ). In Fig. 7 , we show an example of multiple expanding sheets after rupture. The white outlines show the bag edges, which are retracting in the directions indicated by the arrows. Residual ligaments from the piercing and retraction of the bags are also apparent. In Fig. 8 , a bag located just downstream of the lower lip is displayed. There, as the liquid exits the mouth, the fluid is flattened into a sheet and then expanded and stretched into a bag-like structure. Figure 9 shows a bag that is in the flattened sheet phase of its growth. This particular bag is deflected downward and acquires little momentum in the downstream direction and subsequently falls below the lower lip. Ligaments bounding the sides of this sheet radiate outward from it as the sheet expands and thins. Estimating a male lung capacity of 1.5 L and using our direct records of sneeze duration of about 250 ms, and mouth diameter of about d = 3 cm, we estimate the characteristic gas exhalation speed to be U \u2248 2.2 m/s. This leads to a corresponding gaseous Weber number We G = \u03c1 G U 2 d/\u03c3 \u2248 2.2, where \u03c1 G = 0.9782 kg/m 3 is the air density (Picard et al. 2008) . For individual Newtonian droplets, the critical We G for transition to the bag regime is 12 for Ohnesorge number Oh L = \u00b5/ \u221a \u03c1d\u03c3 < 0.1 (Pilch and Erdman 1987) . For a Newtonian liquid jet in a crossflow, the transition from column to bag breakup occurs at a gaseous We G of 4 (Sallam et al. 2004; Scharfman and Techet 2012; Scharfman et al. 2013) . Figure 10 shows droplets, or beads, forming on the elongating ligaments of mucosalivary fluid ejected by the sneeze. The time sequence in Figure 10b shows two consecutive mergers of adjacent beads on the same ligament shown in Fig. 10a . This ligament of mucosalivary fluid is being stretched by the background air flow and has negligible viscous effects, since Oh \u2248 0.005. The diameter of this ligament is approximately 0.2 mm, while the mean measured ligament diameter during the course of the sneeze is about 0.6 mm. In this low-viscosity regime, a Newtonian fluid ligament would be expected to fragment via a Rayleigh-Plateau instability on the capillary timescale \u03c4 RP = \u03c1d 3 /\u03c3 , where d is the initial diameter of the ligament. For example, the ligament observed in Fig. 10 would be expected to pinch off in approximately 330 \u00b5s; however, we see that the breakup is still in progress after more than 13 ms owing to the retarding effects of viscoelasticity. That represents the extension of the filament lifetime by a factor of \u223c 40 when compared to that of an identical filament made of pure water.

We provide the associated video SIV1 in the electronic supplementary materials Fig. 8 Development of the bag instability at the edge of the lip. The bag first grows into a mucus bubble then deforms prior to finally bursting. The snapshots are shown at intervals of 0.5 ms. The bag was originally nearly spherical in shape. This sequence was recorded at 8000 fps. Scale bar is 2 mm Fig. 9 Bag shown here (highlighted by the oval) originates from the mouth near the lower lip. It is in the form of a flattened sheet of horizontal extent of approximately 16 mm. This image was captured at 40 ms from the onset of a sneeze.

Despite recent efforts, no consensus on the size distributions of such droplets is reached in the literature. It is commonly assumed that the droplets are formed within the airway system, with the process of their formation being unreported. Here, we report the results of direct high-speed recordings of the droplets emitted at the exit of the mouth during violent exhalation events. Our study has revealed the rich physics accompanying the fragmentation induced by violent expirations. Our findings indicate the shortcoming of the common belief that the respiratory droplets are formed prior to ejection. Moreover, our findings show the limitations of using indirect measurement techniques tailored to estimate spherical droplet sizes only. In reality, ligaments are suspended in the turbulent cloud and continue to play an important role in shaping the final droplet sizes after ejection. In particular, we showed that violent respiratory exhalations including sneezes involve a sequence of fragmentation processes from mucosalivary fluid sheet formation and extension, to puncture and retraction, to ligament stretching, and, ultimately, to droplet formation. Moreover, we revealed that viscoelasticity plays an important role in retarding the ligament breakup process in time by up to a factor of 40. In addition, viscoelasticity appears to play a major role in the selection of the upper tail of the final size distribution, namely favoring larger drops than expected with a Newtonian fluid under the same fragmentation conditions. This appears to be due to the beads-on-string formation and repeated merger of droplets along the filaments prior to the final separation into isolated droplets. It remains to be clarified how this process influences the lower tail of the size distribution when compared to that of Newtonian fluid under the same fragmentation conditions in unsteady flows such as violent expirations. Namely, it remains unclear whether we would also detect smaller satellite drops created from very thin stretched viscoelastic mucosalivary filaments attached to the larger drops resulting from mergers.",

This particular sequence is observed on the largest ligament shown in (a), which has a diameter of 0.2 mm origin of the contradictory size distributions reported in the literature. By revealing key fragmentation processes, such as bag burst and mergers of beads on string, that influence the final droplet size distribution, our study is the first step in that direction. A theoretical and analog experimental framework for rationalizing the effect of viscoelasticity on the fragmentation leading to the final sneeze drop size distribution is currently under development. A more detailed analysis of the role of each fragmentation process identified herein in setting the final droplet size distribution is also being investigated to refine our assessment of the risk of contamination by violent expirations.",

The latter illustrated the negligible effect of the head motion on the timescales of droplet formation and ejection shows a sequence of close-up snapshots of sneeze ejecta recorded at 2000 fps. The duration of the sneeze is 150 ms. In addition to the expected droplet ejecta, our experiments reveal the presence of ligaments of various sizes. Here, the largest ligaments are 3 cm in length and are ejected at speeds of up to 35 m/s, with twisting and stretching observed during flight. The droplet sizes in this recording ranged from 160 \u00b5m to one millimeter, with a maximum observed speed of 14 m/s.
