In addition, the activity of the promoters themselves may vary among different bacterial hosts. Three different promoters were investigated for their capability to drive enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression in Lactococcus lactis spp. cremoris MG1363, in Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 20016 T and in five L. reuteri strains isolated from chicken crops. The promoters of the Lactobacillus acidophilus surface layer protein gene (slp), L. acidophilus lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhL) and enterococcal rRNA adenine N-6-methyltransferase gene (ermB) were fused to the coding sequence of EGFP and inserted into the backbone of the pTRKH3 shuttle vector (pTRKH3-slpGFP, pTRKH3-ldhGFP, pTRKH3-ermGFP). Besides conventional analytical methods, a new quick fluorimetric approach was set up to quantify the EGFP fluorescence in transformed clones using the Qubit TM fluorometer. ermB proved to be the most effective promoter in L. reuteri isolates, producing 3.90 \u00c2 10 \u00c07 g of fluorescent EGFP (mL OD stationary culture ) \u00c01 . Under the same conditions, the ldhL promoter produced 2.66 \u00c2 10 \u00c07 g of fluorescent EGFP (mL OD stationary culture ) \u00c01 .

Indeed, the excitation wavelength provided by the blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) of the instruments has a peak around 480 nm and the emission of SyBr Green stains shows a maximum around 521 nm; these values are not far from those of EGFP, having the excitation peak at 488 nm and the emission peak at 510 nm.

Following the testing in the L. reuteri DSM 20016 T reference strain, five different erythromycin-sensitive strains of L. reuteri isolated from chicken crops (H09, I09, N07, N09, and N10) were chosen for transformation trials. Transformed colonies were obtained from all the strains. I09 and N09 isolates were cultured in MRS at 37 1C, instead of H09, N07 and N10, which had their optimal growth condition in MRS at 40 1C. The GFP fluorescence was examined in all the recombinant bacteria. The fluorescence was initially observed in pelleted cells upon blue LED light (470 nm) looking through a green polyester filter (Lime#8, Lee filters) and by epifluorescence microscopy on unfixed cells. A high level of fluorescence was detectable in L. lactis/ pTRKH3-ermGFP, while L. lactis transformed with pTRKH3-ldhGFP and pTRKH3-slpGFP showed a very low intensity. The fluorescence of pelleted L. lactis cells required a washing step with PBS to be detectable. Very particular conditions were needed to achieve optimal fluorescence in L. reuteri, as reported by P\u00e9rez-Arellano & P\u00e9rez-Mart\u00ednez (2003) in Lactobacillus casei. Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 20016 T , L. reuteri N09 and I09 were grown in MRS medium under several combinations of the following culture conditions: incubation at 30 or 37 1C, unbuffered or buffered MRS medium, with or without aeration. No fluorescence could be detected when L. reuteri was grown in an unbuffered medium at 37 1C, either with or without aeration. Growth temperature and pH were the most important factors affecting the synthesis or the stability of the GFP protein, because in buffered medium at 30 1C, fluorescence was clearly visible (Fig. 1 ). In contrast with the results of Wu & Chung (2006) , we found that aeration conditions barely influenced GFP expression, achieving similar results with or without aeration in L. reuteri strains (Fig. 2a) . Concordant data were obtained by fluorimetry (Fig. 2b) . In H09, N07 and N10 strains, fluorescence was clearly detectable when these isolates were grown in buffered MRS at 37 1C without aeration, due to their different optimal growth conditions ( Fig. 1) . As observed in our in vitro experiments, although GFP is considered as a suitable reporter to be used in bacteria, detection of this protein in vivo could be problematic due to the high rate of denaturation observed at low pH levels developed and tolerated by LAB during their growth. Actually, satisfactory fluorescence visualization in Lactococcus and Lactobacillus requires a neutralization step performed by washing the cells in a neutral phosphate buffer. Even though visible fluorescence can be recovered by the treatment, it is still unclear whether the totality of the protein can be renatured in this way or whether a part of it remains irreversibly 'switched off ' following extended exposition to low pH levels. To overcome such potential problems in vivo, some alternative reporter proteins could be tested to replace EGFP in vivo, such as the red fluorescent protein from Discosoma sp., which is more stable in acidic environments.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1360, "end": 1398, "text": "P\u00e9rez-Arellano & P\u00e9rez-Mart\u00ednez (2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2018, "end": 2035, "text": "Wu & Chung (2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1975, "end": 1982, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2179, "end": 2188, "text": "(Fig. 2a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2236, "end": 2245, "text": "(Fig. 2b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2438, "end": 2445, "text": "Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Results and discussion"}, {"text": "The GFP produced in recombinant L. lactis and L. reuteri strains was analyzed by Western blotting with mouse Anti-GFP antibody (Roche).

The choice of promoters is one of the most important features to consider when expressing specific antigens in LABs to 'vaccinate' the host.
