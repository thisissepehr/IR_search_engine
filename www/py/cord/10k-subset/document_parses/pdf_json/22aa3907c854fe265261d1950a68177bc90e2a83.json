We identified two isolates of this strain in a diarrhea outbreak at a child care center in Houston, Texas; and two isolates in diarrhea stool samples from two children in Mexico City. All four isolates were detected in stool samples by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). One of the Mexican isolates was typed by EIA and all four isolates were HAstV-5 by typing RT-PCR. The four isolates were >97% nucleotide-identical in two different genomic regions: ORF1a (246nt), and the 3 end of the genome (471nt). One isolate from each geographic location was further sequenced in the transition region from ORF1b to ORF2 (1255nt) and this region of the two isolates showed \u2265 99% nt identity. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences of eight HAstV antigenic types and the novel strain in the transition region demonstrated the new strain being closely related to HAstV-3 in ORF1b, but closest to HAstV-5 in ORF2. These results and high sequence identity among all HAstV antigenic types in the transition region and RNA structural predictions supported a potential recombination site at the ORF1b/ORF2 junction. This is the first evidence that recombination occurs among human astroviruses.",

The genome includes three open reading frames: ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2 ( Fig. 1) [6, 13] . ORF1a and 1b encode non-structural proteins, including a serine protease (Pro) and RNAdependent RNA polymerase (Pol), respectively, and these regions contain sequences highly conserved among AstVs. ORF2 encodes the capsid protein and is highly variable at the 3 end. The family Astroviridae is distinguished from other virus families that are not enveloped and have ssRNA genomes, such as Picornaviridae and Caliciviridae, by the presence of ribosomal frameshifting between ORF1a and ORF1b and the lack of the helicase domain [6] . However, AstVs contain eight characteristic amino acid motifs in the Pol region (e.g. YGDD) typical of +ssRNA virus polymerases, indicating that astrovirus Pol belongs to supergroup I polymerases, which includes the Pol enzyme of picornaviruses, caliciviruses, potyviruses and several other plant viruses [6] . +ssRNA plant viruses also share similarities with human astroviruses (HAstVs), such as the substitution of the catalytic cysteine with serine and the genomic organization resembles that of Luteoviridae [24] .",

In the case of Picornaviridae, poliovirus with natural recombinant genome was isolated from vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis in France, detected by double restriction fragment length polymorphism assay and confirmed by partial sequence analysis [4] . In the case of Caliciviridae, calicivirus with natural recombinant genome (Arg320) was identified from a diarrhea stool sample from Argentina and confirmed by sequence analysis [7] . In the case of Luteoviridae, Koev et al. proposed that recombination has occurred during luteovirus evolution, based on sequence analyses of genetic regions of the two major genera, Luteovirus and Polerovirus [9] . In Caliciviridae and Luteoviridae the recombination events were localized at the Pol/capsid junction, which is a transition between homologous (non-structural) and divergent (structural) regions. Both of these viruses have subgenomic RNA encoding the capsid protein. In Luteoviridae it is proposed that recombination has occurred by Pol switching strand at the subgenomic promoter [9] . Neither natural nor artificially induced recombination has been detected among AstVs.",

The capsid gene of a HAstV-7 Oxford reference strain was sequenced in our laboratory [AF248738]. The 1.2 kb amplicon of the 3 end of the genome of H2067 was sequenced and submitted to GenBank [AF292080]. Amplicons (1.2 kb) from the junction region between ORF1b and ORF2 for HastV-3 to 7 Oxford strains [AF292074-8], HAstV-8 South African strain (As20) [AF292073], and isolate H2067 [AF292072] were sequenced and submitted to GenBank.",

Dotted lines indicate the hypothesized 120nt-long recombination site. Maximum likelihood phylograms of 576nt of ORF1b and 637nt of ORF2 5 end are in the left upper and right lower corners, respectively. Phylogenetic distances are given as number of substitutions per site. Identities between selected strains (T5, T3, and H2067) are presented on the diagonal created by dot plot analysis.
