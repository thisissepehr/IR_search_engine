A substantial proportion occurs intrapartum and is avoidable with better care. At a low-resource tertiary hospital, this study assessed the quality of intrapartum care and adherence to locally-tailored clinical guidelines. Methods: A non-participatory, structured, direct observation study was held at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, Zanzibar, Tanzania, between October and November 2016. Women in active labour were followed and structure, processes of labour care and outcomes of care systematically recorded. Descriptive analyses were performed on the labour observations and compared to local guidelines and supplemented by qualitative findings. A Poisson regression analysis assessed factors affecting foetal heart rate monitoring (FHRM) guidelines adherence. Results: 161 labouring women were observed. The nurse/midwife-to-labouring-women ratio of 1:4, resulted in doctors providing a significant part of intrapartum monitoring. Care during labour and two-thirds of deliveries was provided in a one-room labour ward with shared beds. Screening for privacy and communication of examination findings were done in 50 and 34%, respectively. For the majority, there was delayed recognition of labour progress and insufficient support in second stage of labour. While FHRM was generally performed suboptimally with a median interval of 105 (interquartile range 57-160) minutes, occurrence of an intrapartum risk event (non-reassuring FHR, oxytocin use or poor progress) increased assessment frequency significantly (rate ratio 1.32 (CI 1.09-1.58)). Conclusions: Neither international nor locally-adapted standards of intrapartum routine care were optimally achieved. This was most likely due to a grossly inadequate capacity of birth attendants; without whom innovative interventions at birth are unlikely to succeed. This calls for international and local stakeholders to address the root causes of unsafe intrafacility care in low-resource settings, including the number of skilled birth attendants required for safe and respectful births.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Every year around the world, 2.1 million babies die in the womb (stillbirths) and another 2.6 million die within 28 days of birth (neonatal deaths).

Skilled birth attendants were involved in focus groups discussions, adapting international labour management guidelines to better suit their local situation and participation in trainings. Prior to the PartoMa intervention, the stillbirth rate was 59 per 1000 total births (52% had positive foetal heart rate on admission) and the rate of Apgar score of \u22645 was 52 per 1000 live births. At the 12th intervention month, stillbirth rate had decreased to 39 per 1000 total births (relative risk 0.66, 95% CI 0.53-0.82; intra-hospital singleton stillbirths reduced from 28 to 15 per 1000 total births) and Apgar score \u2264 5 fell to 28 per 1000 live births (relative risk 0.53, 95% CI 0.41-0.69). This was associated with improved quality of care, including improved foetal heart rate surveillance (a reduction in median time interval from last FHR to delivery from 120 (IQR 60-240) to 74 (IQR 30-130) minutes), more judicial use of oxytocin and improved management of women with severe hypertensive disorders. labour ward. Skilled birth attendants (SBAs) comprised 27 nurse-midwives (diploma-level in nursing, except three seniors with university-level degree), 13 resident doctors (general doctors) and six intern doctors (total n = 46) who together provided routine labour care and comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care. On average, six to eight nurse-midwives and five doctors were allocated to the maternity unit in the morning shifts and a total of six SBAs were in the remaining shifts (including weekends). These were the main roles of nurse-midwives: assessment on admission; intrapartum and postpartum care including supportive care, routine monitoring, administration of medication, vaginal deliveries, and perineal repair; maintenance of ward hygiene, and delivery sets. The roles of the doctors involved providing labour and postpartum care to high risk women and complicated deliveries and performing obstetric and gynaecological operations. Direct supervision was provided by two senior midwives and two senior (visiting) doctors, only during morning shifts. In addition, there were three obstetricians who could be consulted and called for emergencies (Additional file 2, cadre definitions).

Predictors were adopted from the NICE [19] and local PartoMa guidelines, and from the hypothesis that they would alter the frequency of observations and/or the quality of care.

Expected frequencies of FHRM for low-risk labours, highrisk labours, and non-reassuring/abnormal FHR were set at 60, 30, and 15 min, respectively [9] .

Four intervals were calculated: between two adjacent FHRMs, vaginal examinations, contractions and the last FHR-to-delivery interval. Differences between work shifts (day/evening/nights) were tested using one-way-ANOVA for the number of staff, equipment and labouring women and chi-square test for composite adverse perinatal outcomes (i.e. stillbirths and Apgar score < 7 at 1 min).

Substantial findings of this study were the discontinuous care. Lack of support and respectful care were reflected by a significant absence of communication, privacy, and support at the time of delivery. Structural challenges observed were high workload compared to staff numbers, an unconducive environment and scarcity of monitoring devices. However, despite this congested and unconducive environment, SBAs showed ability to provide evidence-based triage; they prioritised the monitoring of women who were recognised to have an intrapartum risk event (non-reassuring/abnormal FHR, oxytocin use, and crossing the action line) leading to a significant increase in frequency of FHR assessments.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Lack of attendance and delay in diagnosing second stage of labour in the majority of women was the rationale behind our conservative approach to determine FHRM guidelines adherence.

For example, with one nurse-midwife attending four women simultaneously, there is insufficient time to palpate contractions in accordance to international recommendations (every 30 min for 10-min duration), not to mention time for any other care or rest. Providing support throughout birth was thus an overarching challenge, notably of women in early labour who were not considered as yet eligible for routine intrapartum care. However, women in general, including in Sub-Saharan Africa, favour continuous birth companionship [26] . Evidence suggests that it is the most significant intervention during birth associated with positive effects on perinatal outcomes and women's experience of birth [27] . As such the lack of support in this study, including in the second stage of labour, meant that women were likely to have had significant distress and negative birth experience. In addition to suboptimal care, this inevitably leads to a workforce with moral distress, burnout, and compassion fatigue hence, even less capable of giving compassionate care [28] . In order to cope with the high workload, resident doctors performed a significant part of routine intrapartum care that is usually conducted by midwives. However, this may have impaired the ability to provide obstetric care to the large number of high-risk women and further disrupted midwifery-led supportive care. The lack of adequately trained SBAs, in particular nurse-midwives, may have been exacerbated by lack of inter-professional collaboration and supervision of junior staff, as well as by inefficient organisation of space, workforce and tools [29] . Consequently, care remained severely suboptimal and the stillbirth rate persistently high, emphasising the need to first improve the basic structure of care. Achieving minimal standards of care would require efficient allocation of available resources, organisation, supervision and teamwork as well as an adequate increase in human resources. Moreover, birth companionship is a challenge in open and overcrowded labour wards. Efforts should also be placed on how e.g. relatives and traditional birth attendants may assist the overstrained skilled birth attendants in providing continuous support during labour and delivery.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 735, "end": 739, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 905, "end": 909, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1265, "end": 1269, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1827, "end": 1831, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We here report the labour observation aspect of a broader work that included an ethnographic study and a locally co-created intervention to improve quality of labour care. Measurement of the quality of labour care is essential for identifying gaps, developing context-tailored interventions and monitoring of quality improvement processes. This unique systematic observation of intrapartum routine care overcomes the shortcomings of records-based studies in assessing quality of care. It allowed evaluation of the interactions between labouring women and their birth attendants, and the structural context care was provided in. The findings are supported by record-based quantitative PartoMa findings and also by mainly qualitative findings that showed similar suboptimal structural challenges to processes of care in numerous areas across Sub-Saharan Africa and other low resource-settings [12, [29] [30] [31] . However, observations are more resource-consuming than record-based assessments, hold a higher risk of the Hawthorne effect, and may pose ethical dilemmas about the non-participatory nature of the observer and their moral responsibility to participant safety in understaffed settings. Thus, a tradeoff of biased results for participant safety may be necessary. As the observers were not qualified birth attendants, they expressed any concerns on patient safety, including imminent delivery, to the staff on duty and in emergency situations, they assisted the staff when requested. Observations show it was common practice for birth attendants to wait until signs of imminent delivery before attending to women in the second stage of labour.
