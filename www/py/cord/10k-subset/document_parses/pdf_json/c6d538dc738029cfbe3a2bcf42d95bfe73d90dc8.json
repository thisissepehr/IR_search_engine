Several studies have shown that cytokine storms are directly associated with influenzainduced fatal acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Due to the narrow administration window, current antiviral therapies are often inadequate. The efforts to use immunomodulatory agents alone or in combination with antiviral agents in the treatment of influenza in animal models have resulted in the achievement of protective effects accompanied with reduced cytokine production. Currently, there are no immunomodulatory drugs for influenza available for clinical use. Animal models, despite being ideal to study the anti-inflammatory responses to influenza virus infection, are very costly and time-consuming. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish fast and economical screening methods using cellbased models to screen and develop novel immunomodulatory agents. In this study, we screened seven human cell lines and found that the human monocytic cell U937 supports the replication of different subtypes of influenza viruses as well as the production of the important pro-inflammatory cytokines and was selected to develop the cell-based model. The U937 cell model was validated by testing a panel of known antiviral and immunomodulatory agents and screening a drug library consisting of 1280 compounds comprised mostly of FDA-approved drugs. We demonstrated that the U937 cell model is robust and suitable for the high-throughput screening of immunomodulators and antivirals against influenza infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Annual influenza epidemics cause approximately 290,000-650,000 deaths in addition to causing severe illness in 3-5 million individuals each year (WHO 2018) . This threat poses a continuous challenge to the health care and public health system and is an economic burden to individuals and countries. The 1918 H1N1 Spanish flu, which was caused by the most virulent influenza virus to date, infected about 5% of the world's population and had a mortality rate of 2% (Taubenberger and Morens 2006) . In recent years, some of the most prevalent highly-pathogenic avian influenza viruses (such as H5N1 and H7N9) have crossed the species barrier, resulting in human infection and death . Although the pathogenesis of influenza is not fully understood, severe cytokine storm, with markedly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interferons (IFNs), tumor necrosis factors (TNFs), interleukins (ILs), and chemokines, has been detected in patients hospitalized with severe influenza infections (Beigel et al. 2005) . This aggressive proinflammatory response along with an insufficient antiinflammatory response is commonly referred to as the ''cytokine storm'' (Liu et al. 2016) . Several studies have shown that cytokine storms are directly associated with influenza-induced fatal acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Tisoncik et al. 2012; Short et al. 2014) . Antiviral treatments, which target viral components, are prone to develop drug-resistant viruses and have a narrow time window for their administration; they are also unable to control the excessive proinflammatory response that occurs in the late stage of infection (Davidson 2018) . Therefore, the attenuation of the host inflammatory response with immunomodulators may represent a good strategy for combating severe influenza. In addition, therapeutics designed to target host components are less likely to develop drug-resistant virus strains. In recent years, a few immunomodulatory agents, including proteinase-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) antagonist (Khoufache et al. 2013) , sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P1) receptor 1 agonists (Teijaro et al. 2011) , and tyrosine protein kinase (TPK) inhibitors (Florence et al. 2018) , have shown protective effects in animal models including alleviating the pulmonary inflammatory reaction and increasing survival rates. However, the lack of efficient cell-based screening models is a great impediment in the development of anti-inflammatory drugs targeting influenza-induced cytokine storms (Davidson 2018) . Animal models, despite being ideal for studying potential antiinflammatory therapeutics, are very costly and time-consuming. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish fast, economical and time-saving screening methods using cellbased models that can be used to screen and develop more potent immunomodulatory agents.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 145, "end": 155, "text": "(WHO 2018)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 464, "end": 494, "text": "(Taubenberger and Morens 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1000, "end": 1020, "text": "(Beigel et al. 2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1167, "end": 1184, "text": "(Liu et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1359, "end": 1381, "text": "(Tisoncik et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1382, "end": 1400, "text": "Short et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1670, "end": 1685, "text": "(Davidson 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2059, "end": 2082, "text": "(Khoufache et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2136, "end": 2157, "text": "(Teijaro et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2205, "end": 2227, "text": "(Florence et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2537, "end": 2552, "text": "(Davidson 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Upon infection of host cells by an influenza virus, they can be subsequently recognized by pattern recognition receptors, such as TLR3/7 and RIG-I, which activate downstream pathways, including the NF-jB pathway and the IRF pathways, leading to the expression of multiple cytokines (Pulendran and Maddur 2015) . Among the influenza-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, some common and important pro-inflammatory factors including IFN-a/b, TNF-a, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-8, have been detected in patients with severe influenza (Ramos and Fernandez-Sesma 2015) . Based on their roles in influenza mediated inflammatory injuries in the lungs, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5 are co-regulated by the NF-jB pathway, and the interferons are regulated by the IRF pathways, which can induce the expression of a panel of ISGs, e.g., CXCL9 and CXCL10, primarily through the STAT pathways and the NF-jB pathway (Iwasaki and Pillai 2014) . Although the functions of these cytokines have not been fully elucidated, they can be further categorized into two classes according to their therapeutic effects in animal experiments when being targeted: class one includes factors that do not improve or worsen the disease after gene knockout or antibody neutralization, e.g., CCL5 (Wareing et al. 2004) , IFN-b (Mordstein et al. 2008) , and IL-1b (Kozak et al. 1995) ; class two includes factors that, along with gene knockout or antibody neutralization, can significantly increase the rate of survival and reduce inflammation in the lungs, e.g. CCL2 (Damjanovic et al. 2011; Hrincius et al. 2015) , and CXCL10 (Ichikawa et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013) .

Combination therapies that include both antiviral agents and anti-inflammatory agents represent a potential solution in curing influenza pneumonia. Immunomodulators that can inhibit the excessive inflammatory response in the lungs of patients infected by influenza viruses are urgently needed. However, the use of traditional anti-inflammatory drugs, including corticosteroids, during an influenza infection has been found to have either no effect or even detrimental effects in clinical retrospective studies (Hui and Lee 2013; Ramos and Fernandez-Sesma 2015) . Therefore, the use of selective immunomodulatory agents to specifically inhibit the excessive expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in influenza pneumonia is a potentially valid strategy. However, currently, it is rare to find influenza-related anti-inflammatory drugs either in clinical trials or in preclinical research.

However, the current cell models are not suitable for screening of immunomodulating agents for influenza treatment. Therefore, the establishment of a cell-based influenza virus infection model that can be used for both antiviral and anti-inflammatory drug discovery is very valuable and urgently needed. Cell models are quite different from animal models in that they do not show indications of viral pneumonia found in the lungs of animals. To establish a useful cell model, the right cell type must be chosen; one that plays an important role in influenza-induced cytokine storms and has the appropriate readouts (e.g. induces the expression of the most important cytokines upon influenza infection). Lung epithelial cells, neutrophils, and monocytes/macrophages all play important roles in the influenza-induced cytokine storm and the subsequent ALI and ARDS (Short et al. 2014) . In order to identify a human cell line that can support multi-types and -subtypes of influenza virus infection and the production of important pro-inflammatory cytokines, we examined seven human cell lines, including epithelial cell, neutrophils, and monocytes/macrophages, that are important for the pathogenesis of severe influenza and found that monocytic U937 cells can support the infection and replication of the three IAV and one IBV strains tested. Next, we measured the expression of 7 cytokines, including CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-b, and TNF-a, by quantifying their mRNA levels. A strong response was observed for five of the seven cytokines. For the purpose of using U937 cells as a model for the influenza-induced cytokine production, we measured the correlation between the kinetic expression of CCL2 and CXCL10 at different time points and the MOIs of the viruses used for infection and found that the expression of CCL2 and CXCL10 reached their peak levels when the U937 cells were infected with an influenza virus at an MOI between 0.025 and 0.05. Furthermore, the U937 cell model was demonstrated to support complete viral replication and the expression of CCL2, CXCL10, and IL8 when infected by all of the four subtypes of influenza viruses tested. Therefore, the U937 cell model exhibits great potential for drug discovery of anti-inflammatory and antiviral agents against influenza. However, we think other human cell lines of epithelial, neutrophil, monocyte, and macrophage origins may also be useful for the study of influenza mediated cytokine responses; however, their applications are not as robust for HTS as the U937 cell line and need to be carefully tested and optimized. CCL2 and CXCL10 were chosen as the readouts for antiinflammatory drug screening against influenza in the U937 cell model for the following reasons: (1) these two factors are closely related to the immunopathology caused by influenza. In the fatal cases caused by an influenza virus infection, the levels of these two cytokines were significantly higher in patients than in healthy controls (de Jong et al. 2006; Deng et al. 2008; To et al. 2010; Gao et al. 2013) . (2) Functional studies have shown that knocking out the CCL2 or CXCL10 genes or using neutralizing antibodies to deplete their protein levels and subsequently reducing their functional activity, can significantly alleviate the inflammatory response to influenza infection and improve the survival rate in experimental animal models of influenza infection (Damjanovic et al. 2011; Ichikawa et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013; Hrincius et al. 2015) . (3) CCL2 and CXCL10 are two of the major cytokines/chemokines that recruit monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils, both of which play important roles in influenza-induced inflammation (Ichikawa et al. 2013; Tavares et al. 2017) . The reduction of the levels of these two cytokines may decrease the infiltration of inflammatory cells. (4) CCL2 and CXCL10 are regulated by different signaling pathways. CCL2 is primarily regulated by the NF-jB pathway whereas CXCL10 is predominantly regulated by the interferon pathway, both of which are key pathways for controlling inflammatory cytokine responses (Chen et al. 2018) . (5) Although the inclusion of more cytokines and chemokines may be a better representation of the influenzainduced cytokine storm, too many readouts may unnecessarily complicate the screen. Based on these reasons and concerns, we decided to start with two of the most important pro-inflammatory cytokines, CCL2 and CXCL10.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 160, "end": 181, "text": "(Gerritz et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 182, "end": 197, "text": "An et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 235, "end": 257, "text": "(Hoffmann et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1122, "end": 1141, "text": "(Short et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3247, "end": 3268, "text": "(de Jong et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3269, "end": 3286, "text": "Deng et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3287, "end": 3302, "text": "To et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 3303, "end": 3319, "text": "Gao et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3677, "end": 3701, "text": "(Damjanovic et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 3702, "end": 3723, "text": "Ichikawa et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3724, "end": 3741, "text": "Wang et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 3742, "end": 3763, "text": "Hrincius et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3949, "end": 3971, "text": "(Ichikawa et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3972, "end": 3992, "text": "Tavares et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 4363, "end": 4381, "text": "(Chen et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The use of the U937 cell model to study the anti-inflammatory effects on influenza-induced cytokine responses was validated by testing a panel of known antiviral and immunomodulatory agents, in addition to screening a drug library with 1280 compounds comprised mostly of FDA-approved drugs.

It is worth noting that the 6 re-confirmed hit compounds can be categorized into four classes: (A) TPK inhibitors, (B) Quinolone antibiotics, (C) Statins, and (D) Serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Interestingly, inhibitors targeting these four classes of targets have been previously reported in the literature to reduce inflammation and improve lung pathology caused by influenza infection. The TPK inhibitors, ibrutinib, and imatinib have been reported to protect mice from lethal influenza infection and improve acute lung injury caused by influenza (Hrincius et al. 2015; Florence et al. 2018) . The quinolone antibiotic levofloxacin, which has antioxidant effects, increased the survival rate in mice infected with the H1N1 PR8 virus and was shown to inhibit excessive superoxide production in the lungs of mice (Enoki et al. 2015) . Statins block the inflammatory signaling pathway and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory factors in cells. Their use in animal experiments has shown to reduce the mortality of H1N1 and H3N2-infected mice.
