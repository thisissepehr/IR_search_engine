Methods Thirty healthy volunteers (15 atopic) took part. Basehne tests included viral serology. microbiological culture and polymerase chain reaction for rhinovirus infection (HRV-PCR), histamine bronchial provocation and bronchoscopy. Twenty subjects (eight atopic) underwent repeat tests when they developed a cold. Results Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEVi) was significantly lower during colds (-0.I9L [95% confidence mterval -0.10, -0.29], P-0,0004) and there was a significant increase in bronchial responsiveness (+0.62 doublings of the dose-response slope [+0.24. +1.00], i' = 0.003). Eight subjects (two atopic} had a diagnosed viral infection: two HRV. three coronavirus (HCV), one HRV + HCV. one parainfluenza III (PI) and one respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (also Haemophilus influenzae). In biopsies, during colds, total eosinophils (EGl\"^) increased significantly (geometric mean 6.73-fold [1.12,40.46], P = O.OA). Activated eosinophils (EG2^) only increased significantly in the subgroup without diagnosed viral infection and particularly in atopic rhiniiics. T-suppressor (CD8*\") cells also increased significantly (median +178.3 cells mm\", 7^ = 0.004). Epithelial expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression increased in four atopic rhinitics during colds. Bronchial washings showed a significant increase in neutrophils (GM 1.53-fold [1.04,2.25], i' = 0.02). Conclusion Lower airway inflammation was present in atopic and non-atopic normal subjects with colds. Atopic subjects differed in that they were less likely to have positive virological tests and were more likely to show activated eosinophilia in the lower airway, despite a similar spectrum of symptoms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "attacks with upper respiratory tract viral infections, a majority of which are rhinoviral [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Until recently. There is increasing evidence of an association of asthma rhinovirus (HRV) infections were difficult to diagnose genome common to many if not all serotypes, allowing improved diagnosis of HRV infection. Two studies using this technique have found particularly high identification rates for HRV in asthma exacerbations [6.7] . Several studies have shown that colds may increase asthma severity, using indirect measurements, such as peak expiratory fiow (PEFR), bronchial responsiveness and the late asthmatic response to allergen [8] [9] [10] . However, there is little information on the direct effect of cold virus infection on the immunopathology of the lower respiratory tract. Bronchial biopsies in influenza and mycoplasma have shown inflammatory features consistent with asthma [11, 12] . Nasal biopsies in experimental rhinovirus infection have not shown evidence of an inflammatory infiltrate [13] and it is suggested that mediators such as histamine and bradykinin may cause upper airway symptoms [14] . In nasal epithelial cell cultures, rhinoviruses have a negligible cytopathological effect, compared with the destruction of the monolayer caused by influenza A and adenovirus [15] . Nevertheless, nasal epithelial cell shedding is increased in vivo in experimental rhinovirus infection [16] . Given the high rates of rhinovirus infection in association with asthma exacerbations, it is intriguing to note that the receptor for major rhinovirus serotypes is the intercellular adhesion molecule, ICAM-1 [17] . Its ligands include integrins present on inflammatory cells and binding to ICAM-1 is essential to migration of inflammatory cells into tissues [17, 18] . ICAM-1 is constitutively expressed by vascular endothelial cells but is also upregulated on bronchial epithelial cells in asthma [19, 20] , suggesting a mechanism for inflammatory infiltration of the epithelium. Viral infection may upregulate TCAM-1: by a direct efl'ect as shown in cultured tumour cell fines [21] or indirectly via expansion of TH| T-helper cell clones producing interferon--7 [22.23] . The aim of this study was to examine bronchial epithelial tissue in naturally acquired cold virus infections, in order to determine whether there are differences between the lower airway infiammatory response and ICAM-1 expression in atopic and nonatopic subjects. We decided to study naturally acquired colds, using respiratory symptoms as the diagnostic endpoint, as experimental infection with a specific rhinovirus serotype may not necessarily result in the spectrum of symptoms and inflammatory changes which occur in common colds. We anticipated ^60% identification of viral infections, with a predominance of rhinovirus infections as in previous studies [6.7] . Asthmatics were not studied as we felt that it would be inappropriate to bronchoscope such subjects during an exacerbation. Atopic subjects show mild bronchial Infiammatory changes [24] which may be exacerbated by environmental factors, without unacceptable risk.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 90, "end": 93, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 94, "end": 97, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 98, "end": 101, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 102, "end": 105, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 106, "end": 109, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 445, "end": 450, "text": "[6.7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 656, "end": 659, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 660, "end": 663, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 664, "end": 668, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 911, "end": 915, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 916, "end": 919, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1032, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1133, "end": 1137, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1315, "end": 1319, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1425, "end": 1429, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1640, "end": 1644, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1790, "end": 1794, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1795, "end": 1798, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1930, "end": 1934, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1935, "end": 1938, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2111, "end": 2115, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2196, "end": 2203, "text": "[22.23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2867, "end": 2872, "text": "[6.7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3056, "end": 3060, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Thirty normal individuals aged between 18 and 45 years gave written informed consent to take part in the study, which was approved by the District Research Ethics Committee.

The study has shown the presence of bronchial inflammation in healthy adult subjects complaining of symptoms of the comtnon cold. We demonstrated two distinct groups among such subjects: those with virologically proven infections and those without. A relative rise in neutrophils was a characteristic of the former group, whereas activated eosinophilic infiltration was present in the latter. Despite such differences, symptom scores were similar in the two groups. Atopy and rhinitis were factors associated with the development of activated eosinophilic inflammation in the bronchial mucosa. The majority of subjects showed reduced FEVi and increases in airways responsiveness, neutrophils. total EGl ^ eosinophils and CD8 ^ suppressor T-lymphocytes. regardless of atopy or the ptesence of viral infection. While perception of symptoms of the common cold by subject or observer eould have influenced the results of lung function and bronchial provocation testing, staining and counting of biopsy and iavage specimens was performed without knowledge of subject, eoryzal symptoms or infection status. Our ilndings indicate that many subjects with symptotns traditionally thought to indicate upper respiratory tract infection have evidence of lower respiratory tract inflammation. It seems likely that total eosinophils and neutrophils increased as part of an acute granulocyte infiltrate, whereas CD8 ' T-suppressor cells may be involved in a killer cell response to viral infection: their role in those subjects in whom we were unable to identify a pathogen is less clear. Numbers of subjects with HRV infection were too few to consider separately. However, our methodology for HRV RT-PCR has previously been well validated [7] , results in adult asthtna exacerbations comparing well with those of a study in children using similar techniques [6] . In the latter study there was a higher rate of picornaviruses identified by PCR but the confirmed rate of HRV was similar. The excess of picornaviruses may have been accounted for by HRV or enterovirus infections, the former being more likely. Differences between the two studies may reflect the age groups involved. Bronchial immunopathology in the HRV cases was not distinctive, despite lCAM-1 being the receptor for major HRV serotypes [17] . ICAM-1 expression in bronchial epithelium was limited to four atopic rhinilic subjects. We have not previously been able to show bronchial epithelial ICAM-1 expression in non-asthmatics, whereas ICAM-1 is constitutively expressed by the vascular endothelium. However, our previous study compared asthmatics with non-atopic non-rhinitics [20] , Thus, the findings of this study suggest that ICAM-1 may be up-regulated in lower airway epithelium in allergic rhinitis as well as in asthma. ICAM-I was only expressed in diagnosed viral infection in one atopic rhinitic subject with the combination of RSV together with Haemophilus influenzae infection. This was a 23-year-old heterosexual who had never smoked. He had no exceptional symptoms and made a full and rapid recovery. Bronchial lavage demonstrated high neutrophilia (64%). Although this is a small study, we believe that our findings suggest a tendency, often suspected in clinical practice, for allergic subjects to report allergic inflammation as a \"cold\". This could explain the low diagnostic rate of viral infection particular to the atopic group, despite a combination of PCR and serological diagnostic techniques which have given a high yield of viral diagnoses in previous studies [7] , It is interesting that there were no significant difl'erences in symptoms among atopic and non-atopic subjects save for breathlessness. which was, paradoxically, more common among the non-atopic subjects. Lower respiratory tract symptoms were quite common among these subjects with uncomplicated colds, providing a clinical correlation with the inflammatory infiltrate, especially with CD8'^ T cells. Other investigators have found slight differences in symptomatology in atopic subjects with experimental HRV infections: symptoms tending to be earlier in onset [28] and more severe in those with evidence of preceding HRV infection [29] , Other studies have shown that markers of allergic inflammation can be detected at distant sites in atopic subjects. Djukanovic et al. [24] showed greater numbers of inflammatory cells in the bronchial mucosa of atopic rhinitics than in non-atopic normals. In contrast, we found no difference between atopic and non-atopic subjects at baseline, but only half of our atopic subjects had rhinitis. Other studies from our laboratory have shown constitutive up-regulation of cytokines such as granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the nasal mucosa of atopic non-rhinitics with eczema [30] . Thus, it is perhaps not surprising that activated eosinophils can increase in the bronchial mucosa in atopic rhinitics with episodes of respiratory symptoms. Previous studies of the immunopathology of the common cold have concentrated on experimental HRV infection, examining mainly nasal secretions and peripheral blood. There have been few studies of bronchial pathology. Halperin et al. [35] isolated HRV from the lower airway in experimental infection, using a bronchoscopic technique which minimised contamination from the upper respiratory tract. Calhoun et al. [36] found that subjects experimentally infected with HRV16 showed an increase in eosinophils in bronchoa[veolar lavage specimens following allergen challenge. There was an amplified response in atopic rhinitic subjects, consistent with the increase in allergen responsiveness among similar subjects in a previous study [[0] . Other studies of colds have produced conflicting data. Neutrophilia has been consistently found in nasal secretions [16.31] , together with shed epithelial cells [16] . Levandowski [32] showed a reduction in CD4 + and to a lesser extent, CD8 ^ T cells in peripheral blood after HRV25 infection and suggested that this might indicate recruitment of such cells to the site of inflammation. However, the same investigators found only neutrophils and monocytes in nasal secretions [31] . Others have not been able to find an increase in inflammatory cells in nasal biopsies [13] and suggested tbat the symptoms of common cold infection might be caused by mediators such as histamine and kinins [14.33] . Hsia et al. [22] showed an increase in production of interleukin-2 and interferon--j by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, inversely related to severity of the cold. They also showed an increase in natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity and antigen-stimulated blastogenesis. Skoner et al. [34] showed increases in peripheral blood total leucocytes and lymphocytes, especially, CD3, CD4, CDS and CD3 ' DR^; but a decrease in NK cell activity and lymphoproliferative response to RV39, particularly in nonatopic subjects. There were subtle differences in the peripheral blood response between atopic and nonatopic subjects with a tendency to a later response in the atopic allergic group. Such peripheral blood changes indicate a systemic immune response to HRV. Our findings indicate that healthy non-asthmatic subjects with symptoms of the common cold can develop bronchial inflammation, including an infiltrate of eosinophils. neutrophils and CD8^ T-suppressor cells. Atopic rhinitic subjects were most likely to show allergic inflammation with activated eosinophilia and were least likely to have a diagnosed viral g) 1996 Blackwell Science Ltd, Clinical and E.xperimenlal Allergy. 26. 665-676 infection. Therefore, symptoms typical of the common cold may be caused by airway inflammation in the absence of viral infection. Exposure to aeroallergens and possibly environmental pollutants should be considered as alternative triggers of cold symptoms.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1890, "end": 1893, "text": "[7]", "ref_id":
