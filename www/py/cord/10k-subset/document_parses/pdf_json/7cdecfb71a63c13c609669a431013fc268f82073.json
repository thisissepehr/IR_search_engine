While ICU clinicians have largely focused on whole-body exercise to address limb muscle weakness (e.g., early mobilization), we now know that respiratory muscle weakness is twice as prevalent as limb muscle weakness in ICU patients [2] . Moreover, respiratory muscle weakness is associated with a higher risk of extubation failure [3] , a longer duration of ventilator-dependence [4] and worse outcomes in terms of hospital mortality [2] and mortality within 1 year [3] . While ventilator-weaning failure is complex, and respiratory muscle weakness is only one contributing factor [5] , this weakness is modifiable and can respond to targeted training. In this context, it is surprising that respiratory muscle rehabilitation is not yet standard practice in many ICUs around the world.",

Diaphragm proteolysis is detectable within 18-69 h of controlled mechanical ventilation [6] , and rapid atrophy affects respiratory muscles more frequently than limb muscles. Following at least 24 h of mechanical ventilation, respiratory muscle weakness is almost twice as prevalent as limb muscle weakness (63% vs. 34%) [2] . Even patients ventilated primarily with pressure support modes are not immune to these atrophic changes, but they are likely to have respiratory muscle weakness at the point of weaning from mechanical ventilation (e.g., 38% of predicted maximal inspiratory pressure) [7] . While \"under-assistance\" has been identified as a potential contributor to myotrauma [8] , respiratory muscle weakness could be potentially attributable to \"over-assistance\" from the ventilator in pressure support mode: a recent prospective study of 231 patients in Australian ICUs identified excessive support provided in 41% of patients in pressure support mode [9] . Therefore, inspiratory muscle weakness appears to be a likely consequence of mechanical ventilation, regardless of the mode of ventilation provided.",

Recent ultrasound studies of diaphragm thickness (a surrogate measure of inspiratory muscle strength) revealed that by day 4 of mechanical ventilation, reduced diaphragm thickness could be detected in 41% of patients [4, 10] . Reduced diaphragm thickness is associated with reduced likelihood of weaning from mechanical ventilation, higher likelihood of complications, and prolonged ICU admission [4] . Furthermore, low inspiratory muscle strength (maximal inspiratory pressure <30 cmH 2 O) at the point of extubation is associated with extubation failure, and is independently associated with 1-year mortality (hazard ratio 4.41, 95% CI 1.5-12.9) [3] . Inspiratory muscle weakness is also associated with higher ICU and hospital mortality [2] . Thus, from an ICU clinician's perspective, inspiratory muscle weakness must be considered as a potentially treatable and reversible component in the matter of life and death.",

Yet while ICU physiotherapists now invest considerable energy in providing early mobilization therapy to offset the impact of ICUacquired weakness [11, 12] , the respiratory muscles are frequently neglected in the rehabilitation approach [13] . Clearly respiratory muscle atrophy is an important aspect of ICU-acquired weakness, and we can no longer afford to ignore respiratory muscle rehabilitation as part of holistic recovery for ICU survivors. Identification of respiratory muscle weakness, and early commencement of targeted training, requires effective collaboration of the whole ICU multidisciplinary team, but in particular a cohesive approach between medical, nursing, and physiotherapy staff [14] .",

For ventilator-dependent patients, features within the ventilator software can be used to obtain an approximation of maximal inspiratory pressure (e.g., \"negative inspiratory force\"). In this procedure, the ICU clinician coaches the patient to inhale forcefully against a \"closed gate\" within the system, with the resultant pressure an indication of inspiratory muscle strength. In our experience it is essential that the patient is warned that they will experience no flow of air during the attempt. While this is not a true measure of maximal inspiratory pressure, as it is not performed from residual volume (due to the presence of positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP]), a low \"negative inspiratory force\" score can flag a patient for whom inspiratory muscle weakness should be suspected. Based on both our clinical experience and the data available [3] , scores <30 cmH 2 O should be cause for concern.",

The patient then inhales maximally and the best of three attempts are recorded [18] . While maximal inspiratory pressure scores have not been found to reliably predict weaning failure [18] , our experience has been that scores <30 cmH 2 O may indicate a degree of inspiratory muscle weakness which could impact on weaning and recovery.

However, even if ICU clinicians do not have access to this device, lack of measurement does not preclude appropriate therapy.

Moreover, where inspiratory muscle training is being used around the world, a wide variety of approaches is being employed, and not all of these are evidence-based. For example, a survey of French physiotherapists revealed that 83% considered controlled diaphragmatic breathing (without resistance) to be a form of inspiratory muscle training, and only 16% measured inspiratory muscle strength [26] . More recently, a metaanalysis of 28 studies of inspiratory muscle training in ICU patients described a broad range of training strategies, including strength-based and endurance-based loading (through a removable threshold device or through manipulating ventilator settings), and also more general strategies such as upper limb exercises, mobility training, and biofeedback [22] .

A limitation of this resistive loading is that the amount of resistance (and therefore load) depends on the flow rate generated by the patient. If the patient breathes slowly enough, the load can be very low or negligible. In contrast, \"threshold loading,\" typically using a removable device, requires patients to generate a specific resistance as they initiate a breath to open the valve and generate flow. An important advantage of this threshold loading is that a specific, reliable, and reproducible load can be titrated and MIP = maximal inspiratory pressure; MEP = maximal expiratory pressure; age in years; LLN = lower limit of normal applied to the respiratory muscles [27] , which can be increased over time to generate a training effect. As with all strength training, gradual increases over time are the key to muscle fiber proliferation and hypertrophy. If the load is unreliable or variable, then our ability to deliver an efficient and effective training regime is hampered, and our patients may waste valuable effort with suboptimal training. Thus, inspiratory muscle training strategies that use a titratable load are more likely to result in effective training.",

While theoretically both approaches should result in reliable training, the outcomes are contrasting. Studies of ventilator manipulations have failed to show significant benefits in terms of either breathing muscle strength or weaning duration, despite applying training loads for up to 30 min at loads up to 40% of maximal inspiratory pressure [28] . In contrast, as outlined earlier, several studies of threshold loading (using removable devices) have demonstrated significant gains in inspiratory muscle strength and ventilatorweaning success rates [24, [29] [30] [31] . While these contrasting results may be challenging, there is a key feature differentiating the approaches: in the training with removable devices, patients must actively participate in their therapy and, if only for a short time, consciously tolerate breathing without the ventilator support. In addition to physiological adaptations, there may be a psychological dimension to this training (i.e., development of tolerance to the sensations of unsupported breathing) that would be absent in the ventilator-based approach. Future studies are needed to better elucidate the potential psychological dimensions of respiratory muscle training, but psychological factors may be key to the success of the therapy.",

In fact, there is scarce evidence that deep breathing exercises (without resistance) confer any benefit in acutely unwell patients, for example, in the postoperative phase [32, 33] . Upper limb exercises and mobilization are important aspects of whole-body strengthening and rehabilitation and will also induce, via increased ventilation, an endurance type of training to the respiratory muscles. However, it is our view that ICU clinicians should be wary of classifying these as respiratory muscle strength training per se. Instead, focused and targeted respiratory muscle strengthening should be achieved using titratable resistance, individualized to the patient's current level of weakness, and followed by sufficient rest periods to allow recovery as in athletic training [34] . Based on the available evidence, an international shift toward titratable loading for respiratory muscle training in ICU patients is now overdue.",

In this approach, the patient is briefly removed from the ventilator, and the inspiratory muscle trainer is connected to the endotracheal tube or tracheostomy for training (i.e., breathing through the valve). The intensity is increased over time simply by winding the spring more tightly [14] . This device has been shown to be safe for inspiratory muscle training in selected ventilator-dependent ICU patients, with a negligible rate of adverse events [35] .",

Whether the therapist should use a \"strength\" (high intensity, low repetition) or \"endurance\" (low intensity, longer duration) approach to prescribing training parameters is still somewhat open to debate. In the recent systematic review of inspiratory muscle training in ICU patients [22] , where \"strength\" and \"endurance\" regimes were analyzed separately, both favored inspiratory muscle training relative to control groups. It could be argued that as the inspiratory muscles are primarily muscles of endurance, an endurance-based approach would be sensible [36] . However, in our experience, the highly limited window of patient effort (frequently compromised by fatigue, inattention, or delirium), coupled with the relative disadvantage of potential lung decruitment during sustained training (e.g., secondary to prolonged loss of PEEP), makes strength training a more realistic option for the ICU patient. A patient may be willing to attempt six high-resistance breaths, whereas the prospect of breathing against a low resistance for several minutes can appear prohibitively daunting. From this perspective, the best respiratory muscle training approach may be the one that the ventilator-dependent patient can successfully achieve.",

Early studies in COPD patients often failed to detect benefits of inspiratory muscle training where intensity was less than 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure [44, 45] . In contrast, later systematic reviews and meta-analyses which included studies with intensities great then 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure were more favorable not just for inspiratory muscle strength but also for exercise tolerance and quality of life [37, 46] . In athletes, inspiratory muscle training intensity is typically prescribed between 50% and 80% of maximal inspiratory pressure, across endurance sports such as swimming [42] , cycling [41] , rowing [40] , and running [43] . With high-intensity training, athletes improve not just inspiratory muscle strength but frequently exercise performance as well (e.g., 2.6% increase in 25 km cycling time trial performance [41] ; 3.5% increase in 6-min rowing time trial performance [40] ). In studies of inspiratory muscle training in ICU patients, high-intensity training (6 repetitions per set, >50% of maximum, 30 breaths per day) has resulted in improvements in inspiratory muscle strength [24, 30] , and in the postweaning period has improved quality of life [23] . Therefore, wherever possible, a high-intensity approach to strength training should be used to optimize inspiratory muscle training in ICU patients.",

First, the floor effect of this spring-loaded device can be problematic for a patient who is profoundly weak (e.g., maximal inspiratory pressure <18 cmH 2 O). If the lowest setting of the device is only 9 cmH 2 O, patients may struggle to open the valve at its lowest setting. Second, we have also noted a ceiling effect. Toward the end of training, several of our patients have comfortably exceeded the 41 cmH 2 O upper limit of the device and would be capable of training at much higher intensities. While for most patients this might not be necessary, for those returning to a more active lifestyle, continuing to improve their inspiratory muscle strength may be a vehicle to better tolerance of endurance exercise. To better suit the needs of our ICU patients, we require devices with a broader training spectrum.",

The advantages of a tapered flow resistance load have been well-described in patients with COPD [47] but may also be advantageous for ICU patients. Briefly, whereas a traditional threshold load requires the patient to generate a preset pressure, beyond which they can \"coast\" through the rest of the breath, the tapered flow resistance load provides a tapered load beyond the threshold point, meaning that patients continue to work throughout the duration of the breath, rather than \"coasting.\" The result is that for each breath at the specified intensity, the patient generates more work (at a guaranteed achievable resistance). Thus, the total workload (and therefore potential training effect achievable) is considerably higher with tapered flow resistance load compared to traditional threshold loading. The following graph from a study of tapered flow resistance load in a ventilator-dependent ICU patient captures this difference (Fig. 3) .",

Clearly, we need more studies in different patient cohorts to confirm these findings and elucidate the optimal training approach. Another major randomized trial is underway, using tapered flow resistance load and comparing both strength and endurance approaches [48] . We await the results of this study with keen interest.

In the landscape of reducing sedation to facilitate early rehabilitation in the ICU [1] , this provides yet another imperative to minimize (or eliminate) sedation as early as possible.",

Given the very high likelihood that these patients will have significant respiratory muscle weakness when they are eventually weaned from the ventilator, is there any advantage to commencing respiratory muscle training after liberation from the ventilator? The good news is that these patients can still benefit from training in the postweaning period. In a study of inspiratory muscle training in recently weaned ICU patients (invasively ventilated for 7 days or more), 70 patients were randomized to either usual care or additional daily threshold-based inspiratory muscle training [23] . Two weeks of daily training improved inspiratory muscle strength (maximal inspiratory pressure) as well as quality of life. Patients were most likely to benefit if they had at Fig. 5 Criteria for suitability for inspiratory muscle training for ICU patients. PEEP positive end-expiratory pressure, FiO 2 fraction of inspired oxygen, RR respiratory rate, MIP maximum inspiratory pressure, NIF negative inspiratory force (measured on the ventilator). *Recently weaned means independently breathing 24 hours per day without any invasive ventilatory support. (Reproduced from [14] with permission) least moderate inspiratory muscle strength (28 cmH 2 O or more) [49] . Therefore, a targeted approach to inspiratory muscle training in recently weaned ICU patients appears to be a worthwhile investment.",

In an ICU environment, these factors could include fear and anxiety, as well as cognitive challenges around attention, catastrophizing, and perceived lack of control. A better understanding of the psychological dimension of dyspnea in ICU patients could further inform our approach to optimized ventilatory weaning and respiratory muscle rehabilitation. We hope that future studies of ICU patients will incorporate these patient-centered perspectives and shape our understanding of how best to facilitate holistic recovery.",
