At present, HFRS is getting worse with increasing cases and natural foci in China. Therefore, there is an urgent need for monitoring and predicting HFRS incidence to make the control of HFRS more effective. In this study, we applied a stochastic autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model with the objective of monitoring and short-term forecasting HFRS incidence in China. Methods: Chinese HFRS data from 1975 to 2008 were used to fit ARIMA model. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Ljung-Box test were used to evaluate the constructed models. Subsequently, the fitted ARIMA model was applied to obtain the fitted HFRS incidence from 1978 to 2008 and contrast with corresponding observed values. To assess the validity of the proposed model, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the observed and fitted HFRS incidence was calculated. Finally, the fitted ARIMA model was used to forecast the incidence of HFRS of the years 2009 to 2011. All analyses were performed using SAS9.1 with a significant level of p < 0.05. Results: The goodness-of-fit test of the optimum ARIMA (0,3,1) model showed non-significant autocorrelations in the residuals of the model (Ljung-Box Q statistic = 5.95,P = 0.3113). The fitted values made by ARIMA (0,3,1) model for years 1978-2008 closely followed the observed values for the same years, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 12.20%. The forecast values from 2009 to 2011 were 0.69, 0.86, and 1.21per 100,000 population, respectively. Conclusion: ARIMA models applied to historical HFRS incidence data are an important tool for HFRS surveillance in China. This study shows that accurate forecasting of the HFRS incidence is possible using an ARIMA model. If predicted values from this study are accurate, China can expect a rise in HFRS incidence.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), or epidemic hemorrhagic fever (EHF) is an acute viral syndrome caused by infection with one of hantaviruses. HFRS is an important infectious disease in developing countries. In China, HFRS is caused mainly by 2 types of hantaviruses, Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV), each of which has coevolved with a distinct rodent host. HTNV is associated with Apodemus agrarius, whereas SEOV, which causes a less severe form of HFRS, is associated with Rattus norvegicus [1] . In hantavirus -endemic areas, HFRS is most common among farmers and others who may have close contact with excreta of infected rodents [2, 3] . In mainland China, HFRS remains a serious public health problem with approximately 20,000-50,000 human cases reported annually, approximately 90% of the total cases worldwide [4] [5] [6] . Currently, HFRS is endemic in 28 of 31 provinces in mainland China [4, 7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 517, "end": 520, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 658, "end": 661, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 662, "end": 664, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 842, "end": 845, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 846, "end": 849, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 850, "end": 853, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 923, "end": 926, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 927, "end": 929, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "In response to the spread of HFRS in China, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention designed a surveillance system for HFRS and created educational programs for the general public. However, the impact of control efforts remains difficult to measure due to the inherent complexities of HFRS as a disease: multiple viral strains with identified genetic polymorphisms, complex disease manifestation, diverse animal reservoirs, and multiple routes of transmission [8] . Infectious diseases have certain characteristic features that lead themselves to modeling, such as: speed of pathogen variation, accumulation of susceptible hosts, and environmental indices [9] . Thus, epidemic modeling and forecasting can be essential tools to prevent and control HFRS. Recently, statistical methods including linear regression [10] [11] [12] , correlation coefficients [13] , grey swing model [14] , back propagation artificial neural network model [15] have been used for prediction of HFRS incidence. The variation of HFRS incidence, which is influenced and constrained by diversified factors, is characterized by tendency and randomicity. These statistical tools are inappropriate for analyzing the randomicity of HFRS. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, which take into account changing trends, periodic changes, and random disturbances in time series, are very useful in modeling the temporal dependence structure of a time series. In epidemiology, ARIMA models have been successfully applied to predict the incidence of infectious diseases, such as influenza mortality [16] , malaria incidence [17] , as well as other infectious diseases [18, 19] .

Finally, data were collected by case number according to the sampling results. There might be admission rate bias in the disease report, but this has been reduced as much as possible.

In this paper, we applied an ARIMA (p, d, q) model to analyze the surveillance data of HFRS in China. Disease monitoring by public health department entails ongoing data collecting, processing, and updating. However, the national level China CDC is the appropriate level of organization for the implementation of an ARIMA predictive model, because reported data is continually received and updated. We found that model predictions are further improved by the assured availability of the Health Department data. In this study, we have obtained an ARIMA model that closely fits HFRS incidence in China. The autoregression and moving average parameters of our model imply the incidence of HFRS in a month can be estimated by the residual occurring one month prior.

A model without seasonal terms will need to be updated frequently. Confidence intervals that widen rapidly as time increase from the starting point of the forecasts also indicate a model that needs frequent updating. Generally speaking, there are two ways to implement the updating. The model can be reapplied to the original series with extra observations added at the end to give forecasts based on a later starting point. Alternatively, a new model can be fitted to the longer series. This is probably preferable, since fitting a model is quick, especially when the old model is used as a guide, and it makes better use of the additional observations. Some limitations of this study also need to be taken into account when interpreting the results.
