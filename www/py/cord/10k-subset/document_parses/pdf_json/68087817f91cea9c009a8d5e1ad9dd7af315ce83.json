Nucleoprotein is highly conserved among viral strains. Some antibodies can distinguish pH1N1 NP from earlier strains [31] , but polyclonal sera like ours mainly detect shared epitopes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed on rNP proteins of A/Brisbane/10/2007(H3N2), A/ PR/8/34(H1N1), and pH1N1. The distribution of baseline endpoint titers is shown in Figure 2 . Most donors had titers of 1280 or 5120. Titers on the 3 NP strains for individual sera were identical or differed by only 1 dilution. Antibodies recognizing cell surface conformational epitopes of M2 [32] are more broadly cross-reactive and protective in passive protection than those recognizing linear epitopes [33] . For that reason, we used the M2-CFA and transfectants of Zhong et al [28] to measure antibodies to cell surface \"human M2\" (HM2) from A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) or \"swine M2\" (SWM2) from A/CA/04/09 (pH1N1). Human mAb Ab1-10, which recognizes M2 of seasonal, pandemic, and avian viruses and inhibits pandemic virus plaques [34] , was used as a positive control.",
