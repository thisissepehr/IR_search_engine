Organizational systems to protect against HAI in hospitals in Australia are relatively poorly developed. Awareness and practice of infection control by medical and other healthcare staff are often poor. These lapses in practice create significant risk for patients and staff from HAI. Excessive patient exposure to antimicrobials is another key factor in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and Clostridium difficile infection. Physicians must ensure that their interactions with patients are safe from the infection prevention standpoint. The critical preventative practice is hand hygiene in accord with the World Health Organization 5 moments model. Improving the use of antimicrobials, asepsis and immunization also has great importance. Hospitals should measure and feed back HAI rates to clinical teams. Physicians as leaders, role models and educators play an important part in promoting adherence to safe practices by other staff and students. They are also potentially effective system engineers who can embed safer practices in all elements of patient care and promote essential structural and organizational change.

Patients are frequently confined in crowded, difficult to clean environments, where they may undergo invasive procedures, be fitted with prosthetic devices, and require broad-spectrum antibiotics or immunosuppressive therapies. These conditions provide ideal opportunities for the adaptation and spread of pathogenic microorganisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and multi-resistant Acinetobacter species. Pathogens circulating in the general community also enter the hospital and exploit the crowded conditions to spread rapidly within the hospital population.

There are well-documented cases of blood-borne virus infections in healthcare staff that have resulted from lapses in Standard Precaution practice (e.g. following avoidable needlestick injury or mucosal splash). 7 The worldwide SARS epidemic provided a stark reminder of risk from pathogenic respiratory illness. In Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore and elsewhere, healthcare staff were at the highest risk of contracting SARS and significant mortality resulted. 8 Other respiratory illnesses such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus are also frequently spread among staff by infected patients and major morbidity may result. A recent review concludes that tuberculosis remains a very important occupational risk for healthcare staff in low and middle income countries and for staff in some high-income country facilities. Risk appears particularly high when there is increased exposure combined with inadequate infection control measures. 9 Organisms such as MRSA that are spread mainly by contact (touch), colonize and infect healthcare staff with varying ease dependent on the characteristics of the strain. A review of 127 investigations of hospital MRSA and the involvement of healthcare staff indicated an average of 4.6% of healthcare staff to be carriers of MRSA with 1 in 20 (5.1%) experiencing MRSA infection. Risk factors for staff included chronic skin disease and poor infection control practice. Staff were implicated as the cause of several MRSA clusters. 10 New virulent strains of community-type MRSA have been isolated in most Australian states, causing outbreaks within families, facilities and communities. 11 MRSA infected or colonized patients admitted to hospital increase the risk of MRSA spread to healthcare staff and their families. A recent report highlighted the impact of community-type MRSA on a paediatric clinic in the United States; 16 of 45 staff experienced skin infections and one staff member died from MRSA infection. 12", "cite_spans": [{"start": 210, "end": 211, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 636, "end": 637, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 882, "end": 883, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1368, "end": 1369, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1899, "end": 1901, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2055, "end": 2057, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 61, "end": 69, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Risks to healthcare staff"}, {"text": "A conventional division specifies three modes of infectious illness dissemination -contact (direct, indirect, common vehicle and vector), droplet and airborne spread; however, in reality a continuum of patterns exist for each pathogen.

Infections spread by the droplet respiratory mode can also be transmitted through contact spread as many of these infective agents remain viable on hands and surfaces for extended periods. For instance there is compelling evidence that respiratory syncytial virus cross-infection in paediatrics is reduced by increasing compliance of healthcare staff with hand hygiene. 15 Agents that cause respiratory infection are designated as either spread by droplet or airborne routes (see Table 1 ) largely based on epidemiological studies; however, this division is artificial to some degree. The process of coughing or sneezing creates droplets of varying size that may be expelled at high velocity across distances up to 6 m, which may facilitate distant transfer of any respiratory infective agent. Furthermore, in low-humidity (e.g. air conditioned) environments, larger droplets may evaporate to form droplet nuclei that remain airborne for extended periods. Whether true airborne transmission of infection occurs depends on such variables as the infectious dose of an agent, the delivered dose to the recipient and what degree of pre-existing immunity the recipient has. The microbes that are most efficiently disseminated by the airborne mode (e.g. tuberculosis, measles, varicella) remain viable in droplet nuclei and have a very low infectious dose in a susceptible individual. In low-humidity environments, influenza more usually spread by 'droplet' may also be spread over short distances via the airborne route as shown from animal studies. 16 Healthcare staff and other patients must be protected from infectious fine particle (<5 mM) aerosols that are capable of transmitting infection at low doses \u2020Active screening and isolation for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-colonized patients/staff is not performed at some Australian sites as it is considered to be an ineffective measure. However, all evidence-based international standards and guidelines support the practice in patients demonstrated to have moderate to high risk for carriage. Active screening for other MROs (e.g. vancomycin-resistant enterococci) is still controversial and varies widely in practice. In large part, screening should be confined to patient populations at highest risk from morbidity (e.g. intensive care, haematology and solid organ transplant patients).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 503, "end": 505, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 613, "end": 620, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "How is HAI spreads?"}, {"text": "It is tempting to ascribe the failure to prevent HAI to individual human factors alone -lapses and active failures by doctors and other healthcare staff; however, these lapses occur in a healthcare environment that often fails to facilitate safe systems of care. For instance lack of training or credentialing in standard infection control practices, understaffing and lack of availability of alcoholbased hand rub make adherence to safe practice less likely. To protect patients more effectively, it is crucial that systems of management and care in hospitals are improved such that (i) lapses or active failures are less likely to occur and (ii) there are safeguards to prevent injury in the event of a lapse. A basic premise is that humans are fallible and errors are to be expected. Systems that provide barriers and safeguards must be improved to reduce the capacity for human error to cause an adverse event. 17 Most existing healthcare systems still have significant potential to create risk for patients and staff from HAI. There are many relatively hidden and important deficiencies (latent unsafe conditions) that contribute to significant HAI risks. Table 2 catalogues Australian healthcare systems, their status of development and examples of latent unsafe conditions with an assessment of the HAI risk from each of these. The risk assessment is a subjective synthesis of the likelihood of an unsafe condition or event coupled to the potential severity of outcome in line with the NSW risk assessment process. 18 In addition to system change, organizational culture change, that is, the establishment of new norms of behaviour driven by leaders in management and clinical care who have been convinced of need for urgent change is needed. 19 Leaders must provide explicit, unequivocal support for infection control policy and its implementation. They must ensure that all necessary enablers such as bed-side alcohol-based hand rub and universal staff training are in place. Sufficient epidemiologists and infection control professionals are required to effectively manage and implement infection control surveillance, audits and training.

Always disinfect your hands with alcohol-based hand rub BEFORE and AFTER touching a patient or performing a procedure. Set the example for your team and expect others to follow your lead.2. Dress well for safer care -abandon ties and lanyards, bare your arms to the elbow -no wrist watches or jewellery.3. Insist on the provision of alcohol-based hand rubs at the patient bedside and in your clinic/rooms. 4 . Take alcohol-impregnated wipes on your ward rounds to disinfect equipment, such as stethoscopes and pulse oximeters between use on every patient. 5. Ensure your team follows a standard, methodical, sterile (aseptic) approach for all invasive procedures (especially IV line insertion).6. Invasive devices are potentially dangerous -remove them as soon as you can (within 3 days for peripheral cannulae). 7. Target antimicrobial therapy -consult Therapeutic Guidelines: Antibiotic for the most appropriate agent(s), dose, route and duration.8. Be the first on your team to have the influenza vaccine every year and make it known to others.9. If you're not receiving regular, relevant feedback about healthcare-associated infections like MRSA involving your patients, then you're missing out -insist on it. 10. Look beyond the obvious when seeking source(s) of infection.
