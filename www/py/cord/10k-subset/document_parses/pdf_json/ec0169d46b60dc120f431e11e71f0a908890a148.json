In this work, we cloned and sequenced the ORF6 gene of PRRSV and found that it could not be expressed in Pichia pastoris strain GS115. Then, the ORF6 gene was modified and synthesized based on the codon bias, poly (A) signal of yeast expression system and secondary structure of 5 H -end mRNA of foreign gene. The modified gene was inserted into the yeast expression vector pPICZaA, induced and expressed by the same methods. The recombinant protein with a molecular mass of approximately 23 kDa was screened by SDS-PAGE and identified by Western blot with convalescent sera of animals infected with CH-1a strain of PRRSV. The results indicated that it was similar to the native protein. The expression level of the recombinant protein could attain 2.0 g/L. In the meanwhile, the optimal conditions for expression were determined. It provides an additional means for studying the structural and functional characteristics of PRRSV ORF6 gene.",

PRRSV is a relatively small, enveloped virus containing single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 15 kb [5, 18] . The viral genome contains 8 open reading frames (ORFs) that are transcribed in cells as a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs [5, 18, 19] . The ORF1a and ORF1b situated at the 5 H end of the genome represent nearly 75% of the viral genome and encode proteins with apparent RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities [18, 20] .",

The M protein contains 1\u00b12 putative glycosylation sites and 3 highly hydrophobic regions in its N-terminal half [15, 17] , which are assumed to represent potential membrane spanning domains by analogy to the coronavirus M protein [23] . Another, 18 amino acid residues of the protein is probably exposed on the virion surface which relates to viral absorbtion and propagation [1] . The M protein is the most conserved structural protein between North American and European isolates. It is highly antigenic and can elicit a detectable antibody response as early as 10 days following infection [10, 14, 16, 32, 33] . Therefore it is suggested that the recombinant protein can be used as antigen for sera test and subunit vaccine. Because the structure and function of M protein are still unclear so far, it is necessary to prepare a large quantity of the recombinant M protein by the gene engineering method for studying the protein. Pichia pastoris has been developed into an expression system for high-level expression of recombinant proteins. It not only shares many of the advantages of higher eukaryotic expression systems such as protein processing, protein folding, and posttranslational modification, but is also as easily manipulated as E. coli [7, 8, 11] . Many heterologous proteins have been highly expressed in P. pastoris such as TNF, EGF [4, 28] .",

As a eukaryote, P. pastoris has been developed as an excellent host for the production of foreign proteins [8] . The organism has the potential for high level of expression, efficient secretion, easily grown to very high cell densities and the advantages of higher eukaryotic expression systems such as protein processing, protein folding, posttranslational modification while being as easily as to be manipulated as E. coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae [4, 7, 8, 11, 28] .

In addition, an apparent difference of bias between yeast and bacteria was found by analyzing the codon characteristics of 110 yeast's genes. The usage frequency of codon AGA and CGC were 86.6% and 1.25%, respectively, and CGA and CGG were not used within the six codons of arginine [10, 25, 26] . So codons of arginine in the ORF6 gene were changed into AGA. Because codons of other amino acids were similar to arginine, we decided to modify the whole ORF6 gene. All codons of ORF6 gene were mutated according to yeast bias codons. In the meanwhile, rich ATT region was removed to avoid the undesirable termination signal of yeast. Results confirmed that the modified ORF6 gene was highly expressed (approximately 2.0 g/ L), indicating that ORF6 gene was successfully modified.",
