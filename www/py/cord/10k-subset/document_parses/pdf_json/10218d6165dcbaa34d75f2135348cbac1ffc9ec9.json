            "text": "Rickettsia are obligate intracellular bacteria that evade antimicrobial autophagy in the host cell cytosol by unknown mechanisms. Other cytosolic pathogens block different steps of autophagy targeting, including the initial step of polyubiquitin coat formation. One mechanism of evasion is to mobilize actin to the bacterial surface. Here, we show that actin mobilization is insufficient to block autophagy recognition of the pathogen Rickettsia parkeri. Instead, R. parkeri employs outer membrane protein B (OmpB) to block ubiquitylation of bacterial surface proteins, including OmpA, and subsequent recognition by autophagy receptors. OmpB is also required for the formation of a capsule-like layer. Although OmpB is dispensable for bacterial growth in endothelial cells, it is essential for R. parkeri to block autophagy in macrophages and to colonize mice because of its ability to promote autophagy evasion in immune cells. Our results indicate that OmpB acts as a protective shield to obstruct autophagy recognition, revealing a distinctive bacterial mechanism to evade antimicrobial autophagy.",

            "text": "To identify surface proteins that may protect Rickettsia from autophagic recognition, we assessed whether R. parkeri transposon mutants lacking known surface proteins were polyubiquitylated. In particular, we assessed strains with transposon (tn) mutations in ompA, ompB, sca2, and hrtA (encoding the 17-kDa antigen) 33, 38 . The ompB mutant (ompB STOP ::tn), obtained via serial-passaging the parental ompB::tn strain, contains a suppressor mutation in the form of a stop codon upstream of the transposon that prevents expression of a truncated OmpB product, which appears to be toxic ( Fig. 1b ; Extended Data Fig. 1a-e) . The mutants were analyzed for co-localization with polyubiquitin at 72 hours post infection (hpi) in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) (Fig. 1a , c; Extended Data Fig. 1e ). Wild type (WT), ompA::tn, and hrtA::tn bacteria were polyubiquitin-negative. Notably, the sca2::tn mutant, which is defective in actin polymerization at this time point 33 , was also polyubiquitin-negative. However, more than 75% of the ompB STOP ::tn (and ompB PROM ::tn, an independent mutant; Extended Data Fig.   1a -d) bacteria co-localized with polyubiquitin. To confirm that polyubiquitylation of ompB STOP ::tn bacteria was due to mutations in ompB and not to polar effects on surrounding genes, we tested R. parkeri mutants with insertions in the genes directly upstream or downstream of ompB (Fig. 1b) . We also tested a mutant with an insertion in the gene rickCE encoding for a rickettsial deubiquitylase 39 . Mutants with insertions in the genes directly flanking ompB, or in rickCE, were all polyubiquitin-negative (Fig. 1a, c) . Thus, polyubiquitylation of ompB STOP ::tn bacteria is caused by mutations in ompB. Furthermore, purified ompB STOP ::tn bacteria were heavily polyubiquitylated while WT bacteria showed little polyubiquitylation (Fig. 1d) , suggesting that bacterial proteins or tightly associated host components are ubiquitylated. These data demonstrate that R. parkeri requires OmpB, but not Sca2-mediated actin mobilization, for avoidance of polyubiquitylation.",

PYR-41 treatment caused a 9-fold reduction in the number of polyubiquitin-positive ompB STOP ::tn bacteria compared with a vehicle control (Extended Data Fig. 2a, b) . We next examined the nature of ubiquitin chains in the coat by identifying which of the seven lysine or the N-terminal methionine residue(s) are linked, using ubiquitin linkage-specific antibodies. We observed that ~90% of ompB STOP ::tn bacteria were positive for M1, K63, or K48-linked ubiquitin chains, whereas WT bacteria were polyubiquitinnegative (Extended Data Fig. 2c ). This demonstrates a role for the host ubiquitin machinery in forming the polyubiquitin coat and shows that the coat may consist of heterotypic ubiquitin conjugates, as observed for mitochondria during mitophagy 40 .",

The internalization of ompA::tn, sca2::tn, or hrtA::tn mutants, in contrast, were not impaired (Extended Data Fig.   3a ). Thus, OmpB is important for optimal internalization into HMECs. Nevertheless, internalization was rapid enough to determine the kinetics of polyubiquitin coat formation. Some purified ompB STOP ::tn bacteria in the initial inoculum had a polyubiquitin coat, and there was increased co-localization with polyubiquitin over time, corresponding with internalization (Fig. 2b) . We also observed that the majority of intracellular ompB STOP ::tn bacteria were polyubiquitin-positive whereas the majority of extracellular bacteria were polyubiquitin-negative at 60 mpi (Extended Data Fig. 4e, f) .

Alternatively, OmpB may camouflage the bacterial surface, either directly and/or via its role in formation of a capsule-like halo. In support of these hypotheses, OmpB makes up more than 10% of the cellular protein mass 35 and is thus abundant enough for a camouflaging role. Moreover, a role for the OmpB-dependent capsule-like halo would be consistent with speculation that the capsule O-antigen shields Francisella tularensis from ubiquitylation 23 . A third possibility is that OmpB recruits host proteins that camouflage the bacterial surface or cleave polyubiquitin chains.

In addition, a sub-population of WT L. monocytogenes is polyubiquitylated during intracellular growth 11, 22, 52 , whereas nearly all R. parkeri are polyubiquitin-negative, suggesting that OmpB is a more robust shield, perhaps because its mechanism may not involve recruitment of host components such as the actin machinery. Thus, although cytosolic pathogens have evolved a common strategy of using abundant surface proteins to block host polyubiquitylation, the mechanism by which each protein acts as a shield is distinct. Understanding the commonalities and differences in how pathogen proteins protect against polyubiquitylation and autophagy will enhance our understanding of pathogenic strategies for avoidance of innate immunity, and might be coopted as a therapeutic strategy for treating infectious disease.",

Randomly assigned 8-10-week-old male and female C57BL/6, Atg5 flox/flox , and Atg5 flox/flox -LysMcre+ mice were used in the experiments comparing these genotypes. No data blinding was performed. The sample size for mice experiments was chosen based on the results between two groups after the first experiment, in which 2-3 mice per group were used. Mice were housed in specific pathogen-free conditions and euthanized according to standard protocols approved by UC Berkeley Animal Care and Use Committee.",

Immediately after injection, to confirm the infectivity and titer of the bacterial strains, bacteria were enumerated using a plaque assay, as described above. At 2, 24, 48, and 72 hpi, mice were sacrificed, doused with ethanol, laid on the right side, and the spleen, liver, lung, and kidney were removed and transferred into cold sterile PBS. Organs were disrupted in a homogenizer (Polytron) for ~10 seconds and centrifuged at 200 x g for 5 min. Supernatants were collected to assess the PFUs per organ using a plaque assay, as described above (Fig. 6g) . Due to moderate toxicity of the organ supernatants on Vero cells (particular from the liver), we optimized the protocol as follows. Instead of centrifuging the homogenized organs at 200 x g for 5 min, we employed 300 x g for 5 min. Subsequently, instead of centrifugation of supernatants at 300 x g for 5 min, which we normally use for R. parkeri infections, supernatants were centrifuged at 230 x g for 5 min. These minor changes reduced the toxic effects on Vero cells, leading to the detection of ompB STOP ::tn PFUs and increased WT PFUs (Fig. 6h) .",
