            "text": "Background: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthritogenic alphavirus (family Togaviridae), transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes. CHIKV re-emerged in 2004 with multiple outbreaks worldwide and recently reached the Americas where it has infected over a million individuals in a rapidly expanding epidemic. While alphavirus replication is well understood in general, the specific function (s) of non-structural protein nsP3 remain elusive. CHIKV nsP3 modulates the mammalian stress response by preventing stress granule formation through sequestration of G3BP. In mosquitoes, nsP3 is a determinant of vector specificity, but its functional interaction with mosquito proteins is unclear. Methods: In this research we studied the domains required for localization of CHIKV nsP3 in insect cells and demonstrated its molecular interaction with Rasputin (Rin), the mosquito homologue of G3BP. The biological involvement of Rin in CHIKV infection was investigated in live Ae. albopictus mosquitoes.",

Ae. albopictus Rin displayed a diffuse, cytoplasmic localization, but was effectively sequestered into nsP3-granules upon nsP3 co-expression. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that the Rin-nsP3 interaction involved the NTF2-like domain of Rin and two conserved TFGD repeats in the C-terminal variable domain of nsP3. Although in vitro silencing of Rin did not impact nsP3 localization or CHIKV replication in cell culture, Rin depletion in vivo significantly decreased the CHIKV infection rate and transmissibility in Ae.albopictus.",

            "text": "CHIKV proteins are translated from a viral singlestranded positive-sense RNA of approximately 11.8 kb [15, 16] . The four alphavirus non-structural proteins (nsP1-4) are directly translated from genomic RNA and form a replication complex (RC), which is associated with the plasma membrane and endosomal membranes [17] . A number of functions has been assigned to alphavirus nsPs: nsP1 is involved in capping of RNA [15] and is the membrane anchor of the RC [17] , nsP2 has protease and helicase activity, causes host shut-off and inhibits interferon-induced JAK-STAT signaling and the unfolded protein response [18] [19] [20] [21] . NsP4 serves as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [16] . The functions of nsP3 are more enigmatic, but the protein is highly phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues [22, 23] and is essential for RNA synthesis [24] as part of the viral RC [17] . CHIKV nsP3 can be divided into three regions; the macrodomain (amino acids 1-160) is conserved among alphaviruses, Coronaviridae, rubella and hepatitis E viruses and can bind ADP-ribose, RNA and DNA in vitro [25] . The central, zinc-binding domain (amino acids 161-324) is conserved among alphaviruses, while the C-terminal region is highly variable and even shows substantial dissimilarity between CHIKV strains [26, 27] . SINV nsP3 is found in cytoplasmic granules or foci which are also comprised of various host proteins [28, 29] . In both mammalian and mosquito cells the cellular protein Ras-GAP SH3 domain binding proteins (G3BPs) were found in nsP3-granules [28, 29] . G3BPs are ubiquitously expressed proteins conserved among eukaryotes. Mammals have three G3BPs: G3BP1, 2a and 2b, which are expressed from 2 distinct genes, while insects have one, named Rasputin (Rin) [30] . Mammalian G3BP is a widely used marker for stress granules (SGs) [31] , which are cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) that form when translation is impaired in response to several types of cellular stress [32] . NsP3-G3BP-granules are the explicit phenotype of the first reported function of alphavirus nsP3, as we have recently shown that CHIKV nsP3-G3BP granule formation prevents the establishment of bona fide SGs [33] . These nsP3-G3BPgranules did not contain other crucial SG marker eIF3 and cells expressing nsP3 were unable to respond normally to oxidative stress [33] . The inhibition of SGs via an interaction between nsP3 and G3BP has now also been confirmed for SFV [34] . Details on the interaction between nsP3 and mosquito Rin are currently lacking.",

Vector competence is a complex trait involving an interplay between vectors, pathogens and environmental factors [36] but the molecular details are not well understood. While it has been firmly established that antiviral RNAi pathways play a major role in controlling CHIKV and other arboviral infections in the mosquito [37, 38] , other mechanisms of virus-host interactions that influence vector competence and the roles therein of viral (non) structural proteins need to be examined. Recently, however, nsP3 of ONNV (transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes), has been uncovered as an important determinant for vector specificity. CHIKV does not normally infect An. gambiae, however, a chimeric virus containing ONNV nsP3 in a CHIKV infectious clone backbone became infectious for An. gambiae mosquitoes [39] . Thus, it is hypothesized that specific molecular interactions between mosquito host factors and alphavirus nsP3 determine the vector specificity.",

To determine which domains within nsP3 are responsible for the formation of nsP3-granules, truncated versions of nsP3 fused with EGFP ( Fig. 1a) were expressed in insect cells (Fig. 1d) . For these studies we used Sf21 cells because of their superior transfection efficiency as compared to mosquito cells. Removal of the entire C-terminal variable region (nsP3.2) resulted in the formation of filamentous, cytoplasmic structures. (Fig. 1d, left) . To investigate whether the macrodomain could be eliminated from nsP3 without affecting its localization, it was deleted from EGFP-fused nsP3 and nsP3.2, yielding truncated mutants nsP3.7 and nsP3.8, respectively (Fig. 1a) . When expressed in insect cells, nsP3.7 showed an identical granular phenotype as full-length nsP3, whereas nsP3.8 formed filaments that were very similar to those produced by nsP3.2 (Fig. 1d, middle) . We observed similar filaments upon expression of these nsP3.2 or nsP3.8 Representing either the full length protein N-terminally fused to EGFP (nsP3), nsP3 isoforms with adapted C-terminal amino acids (nsP3, nsP3-DDEL and nsP3-dUAG) or truncated nsP3 variants (nsP3.2, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.10).

However, when Rin was co-expressed with nsP3, which localized to small nsP3 granules (Fig. 2b, right) , both proteins displayed strong co-localization and formed much larger granules (Fig. 2c, top) . These nsP3-and Rin-positive granules or aggregates were larger and more asymmetrical than normal nsP3-granules. In this experiment, Rin was transiently (over) expressed, which may explain the large size of the granules. In contrast, when mCherry-Rin was co-expressed with the C-terminal truncated, filamentous mutants EGFP-nsP3.8 (Fig. 2c, bottom) or EGF-nsP3.2 (not shown), Rin did not co-localize with the filaments formed by these mutants and retained its diffuse, cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 2c, bottom) .

Deletion of a conserved SH3-domain binding motif (PVAPPRRRR) in the variable domain of nsP3 resulted in a diffuse nuclear/cytoplasmic localization of nsP3 and abrogated the interaction between nsP3 and G3BP, restoring the potential of the cell to respond to oxidative stress [33] . A recent study, however, convincingly showed that the interaction between nsP3 and mammalian G3BP depends on two conserved repeats (with core sequence TFGD) in the variable domain of nsP3 [43] . To further investigate which domain(s) of nsP3 are crucial for the interaction between CHIKV nsP3 and Rin, both the SH3-domain binding motif and conserved TFGD repeats in the variable domain of nsP3 were mutated using site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 3a) . When EGFP-nsP3 and Rin-mCherry were transiently expressed in insect cells, both wild type proteins displayed perfect co-localization. Deletion of the SH3-domain binding motif (nsP3-d398/406) resulted in a diffuse nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of nsP3 and a diffuse mainly cytoplasmic localization of Rin (Fig. 3b, second panel) , identical to the distribution of nsP3 and G3BP in mammalian cells [33] . However, when conserved proline and/or argenine residues from the SH3domain binding motif were substituted for alanines (nsP3-P398A and nsP3-PPR401AAA) the co-localization of nsP3 and Rin in cytoplasmic nsP3-granules remained unchanged (Fig. 3b) .",

The first 140 amino acids of mosquito Rin show high sequence homology to that of NTF2-like domains including the NTF2-like domain of human G3BP (Fig. 4a) . Protein structure prediction of Ae. albopictus Rin revealed a 100 % structural homology of the NTF2-like domain with those of G3BP and Drosophila Rin (Fig. 4b, left) , which contains a binding pocket for FxFG containing peptides [44, 45] . Here we mutated a phenylalanine of Rin (F34) that is expected to interact with the phenylalanines of FxFG domains via pi-stacking (Fig. 4b, right) [44] . Indeed, amino acid substitutions in Rin (F34W or F34A), within PiB-A.alb-Rin-mCherry (Fig. 2a) strongly reduced the sequestration of Rin into nsP3-granules (Fig. 4c) , indicating that this amino acid is essential for nsP3-Rin interaction. Effect of Rasputin silencing on the formation of CHIKV nsP3-granules So far, we have shown that nsP3 has a granular localization and that Rin has a diffuse cytoplasmic localization when expressed individually. To investigate whether the formation of nsP3-granules requires Rin, localization of EGFP-nsP3 was studied after Rin expression was silenced in mosquito cells using dsRNAmediated RNAi. U4.4 mosquito cells were transfected with dsRNA from either Rin (dsRin) or firefly luciferase (dsLuc) as a control. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR on Ae. albopictus Rin mRNA, normalized by housekeeping gene S7 mRNA, showed a 90 % reduction in Rin mRNA when cells were transfected with dsRin RNA (Fig. 5a) . Subsequent transient expression of EGFP-nsP3 displayed clear nsP3-granules in both dsRin and dsLuc transfected cells (Fig. 5b) . This result indicates that the formation of CHIKV nsP3-granules in mosquito cells is independent of (high levels of ) mosquito Rasputin.",

Sixteen and twenty-four hpi, total RNA was isolated, viral structural proteins were detected and viral titers were determined. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR on transcripts purified from CHIKV infected cells showed that Rin silencing was efficient (>70 %) (Fig. 7a) . To quantify replication levels of CHIKV in Rin silenced cells the relative levels of CHIKV genomic RNA were measured. CHIKV replication produced equal concentrations of genomic RNA in Rin-depleted versus dsLuc transfected cells at both timepoints (Fig. 7b) .

We conclude that Rin depletion in cultured U4.4 mosquito cells does not affect CHIKV RNA replication, structural protein expression or virion production.

Remaining mosquitoes were orally infected with CHIKV (10 7 pfu/ml) and sacrificed six days post infection. b Total RNA was isolated and Rin silencing was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on Ae. albopicutus Rin mRNA, normalized for the internal control S7. Bars represent mean Rin mRNA values normalized to dsLuc injected mosquitoes. Error bars indicate one standard error of the mean (n = 5). c Heads and bodies from the blood fed mosquitoes were separated, homogenized and the presence of CHIKV was determined by incubating the homogenate on Vero E6 cells. Bars represent the percentage of CHIKV positive mosquito bodies and heads from both dsLuc and dsRin injected mosquitoes. Asterisk indicates significant difference (P < 0.05 Fisher's exact test). d From all the CHIKV positive mosquito heads and bodies the viral titers (TCID 50 /ml) were determined. Data points represent one individual mosquito head or body. Asterisk indicates significant difference between dsLuc and dsRin injected mosquitoes (P < 0.05, Mann Whitney test) and red data points indicate mosquitoes with positive saliva conserved in cells from mammalian and insect origin. In mosquito cells, CHIKV nsP3 forms cytoplasmic granules, which are highly similar to the nsP3-G3BP granules that inhibit the formation of SGs in mammalian cells [33] . Removal of the variable domain results in the formation of filaments. Both the granular or filamentous nsP3 structures form independent of the N-terminal macrodomain. This indicates that multimerization of nsP3 is attributed to the central conserved domain. How nsP3 multimerizes into these two diverse cytoplasmic phenotypes is unknown, however, removal of the C-terminal variable domain may cause a conformational change or affect interactions with host factors which allows nsP3 to form long cytoplasmic filaments. Whereas Rin is clearly sequestered into nsP3-granules and transient overexpression of Rin may increase the size of the nsP3-granules, silencing of Rin and reducing its co-localization with nsP3 by mutagenesis shows that Rin is not required for the formation of nsP3granules (Figs. 3, 4 and 5) . Elucidation of the exact structural composition of these nsP3 granules and filaments, however, needs further experimentation.",

When we replaced the phenylalanine and glycine from either one of the nsP3 C-terminal TFGD repeat with alanines there was no apparent change in the co-localization of nsP3 and Rin. However, the interaction between nsP3 and Rin was completely lost when both TFGD repeats were mutated (Fig. 3c ). This suggests a direct interaction between these amino acid repeats and Rin, and shows that both repeats are redundant for the interaction with Rin. Ae. albopictus Rin was isolated from U4.4 cells. Sequence analysis revealed that the Nterminal NTF2-like domain has high homology with other NTF2-like domains including human G3BP (Fig. 4a) . The three-dimensional crystal structures of the NTF2-like domains from Drosophila Rin and human G3BP have recently been resolved, and contain a binding pocket for FxFG containing peptides [44, 45] . The NTF2-like domain from Ae. albopictus Rin was modelled onto that of Drosophila, showing high resemblance (Fig. 4b) . As expected from this model, point mutations in the binding pocket of the Rin NTF2-like domain (position F34) greatly reduced the interaction between nsP3 and Rin (Fig. 4c) . Although Rin still partly localized to nsP3-granules, this result does provide evidence of an interaction between CHIKV nsP3 and the NTF2-like FxFG binding pocket of Rin. A recent study has confirmed this interaction between homologous sites in SFV nsP3 and mammalian G3BP [46] . Additional interactions were predicted between FxFG peptides and residues in the NTF2-like binding pocket of G3BP [44] , which could explain the strongly reduced, but not completely abolished, interaction of mutated Rin with nsP3.",

            "text": "Rasputin silencing during oral, in vivo infections resulted in a marked decrease in the percentage of CHIKV infected mosquitoes in concert with strongly reduced viral titers in the mosquito heads (Fig. 6) . Interestingly, in vitro Rin silencing did not affect CHIKV infection in cultured mosquito cells (Fig. 7) , which is in agreement with in vitro studies with SINV and siRNA-mediated G3BP1/2 silencing in mammalian cells [47] . However, simultaneous G3BP1/2 silencing reduced early CHIKV replication in 293/ACE2 cells [48] . These observations suggest that Rin may be involved in the initial establishment of a productive infection and/or affects CHIKV infections in specific mosquito tissues, e.g. the midgut. It also is an indication that results obtained in cell lines are not always a good proxy for results obtained in vivo. Indeed, midgut barriers have been described in arthropods that limit arbovirus replication and/or dissemination through the organism [49, 50] . The interaction between nsP3 and Rin may play a significant role in modulating the midgut antiviral responses. Interestingly, exchanging the nsP3 genes of CHIKV and ONNV made CHIKV infectious for An. gambiae [39] . Moreover, replacing only the C-terminal end of CHIKV nsP3, which is required for Rin interaction, with that of ONNV was sufficient to orally infect An. gambiae with CHIKV. This fragment encompasses the variable domain of CHIK nsP3, suggesting a strong role for the C-terminal domain of nsP3 in facilitating oral infection in specific vector species.",

In response, viruses often inhibit the formation of bona fide SGs (reviewed in [55] ). Poliovirus 3C cleaves G3BP [56] , whereas others, including alphaviruses, induce viral granules that sequester G3BP and/ or other SG factors to favour viral replication [33, 34, [57] [58] [59] . Flavivirus and hepatitis C virus infections also bind SG components to increase their replication efficiency [58, 60] and G3BP1/2 are required for efficient CHIKV minus strand RNA transcription [48] . Together with our in vivo data on the proviral role of Rin in mosquitoes, this strongly suggests that viruses, including CHIKV, can utilize SG components (e.g. G3BP/Rin) for efficient replication in their natural hosts and/or vectors.",
