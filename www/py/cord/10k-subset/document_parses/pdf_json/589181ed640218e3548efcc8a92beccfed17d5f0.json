In addition, when the lag was \u221215, there was a marginally significant negative CCF, which we believe to be a false alarm.

These studies laid the foundation for investigating the epidemiological characteristics of the H7N9 epidemics. Compared with these published studies, the innovative points lie in our analysis of the transmission mechanisms in the human population from a stochastic perspective, according to the transmission characteristics of H7N9. The occurrence of infection was treated as a random event produced by a Poisson process, and the rate of infection changed with time. Therefore, the entire epidemic process can be regarded as the connection of multiple Poisson processes occurring at different rates. We established a relationship between the probability of infection and a continuous time Markov chain; the growth rate of new infections was then obtained. The initial stage of an infectious disease is effective contact with the pathogen. The growth rate of new infections reflects the frequency at which susceptible individuals come into contact with the virus: The more frequent the contact, the faster the rate of new infections increases. Therefore, we believe that this rate is the earliest and most accurate reflection of the severity of the epidemic. Although changes in the number of confirmed cases can reflect the temporal distribution features of the epidemic, laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is delayed by a period of time greater than that of infection; in our study, the average delay was 13 days (standard deviation, 6.8 days). Therefore, evaluating the epidemic's development trend using the temporal distribution of confirmed cases is imprecise. This study aimed to analyze the epidemic trend more accurately and to establish a more precise statistical foundation for analyzing the impact of various prevention and control measures adopted by China, and meteorological and environmental factors, on the epidemic. For example, some influencing factors-such as closing and regular disinfection of live poultry markets, atmospheric temperature, rainfall, and the number of migratory birds-can be evaluated more timely and accurately by judging the growth rate of new infections.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 282, "end": 290, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Correlation test of time series for new infections and new confirmed cases.

The number of infections increased drastically, reached a peak in March 2013, and then decreased drastically. From May to September 2013, infections were sporadic. The number of infections gradually increased from October through November 2013, then markedly increased in December, reaching a peak in January 2014, thereafter drastically decreasing. The epidemic stabilized from March through September 2014. Thereafter, the pattern of temporal distribution was essentially similar to what was observed in 2014, i.e. a high incidence in winter and spring with a low incidence in summer and autumn. The fifth epidemic was the most serious, with the number of infections increasing drastically in October 2016 and reaching a peak in January 2017; an estimated 229 new infections occurred in January 2017. Thereafter, the number of cases gradually decreased, but still fluctuated at a high level. From 2013 through May 2017, the expected numbers of infections annually were 212, 305, 171, 324, and 755.
