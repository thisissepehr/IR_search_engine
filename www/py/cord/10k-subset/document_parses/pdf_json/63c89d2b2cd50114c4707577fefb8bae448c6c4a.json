Lung injury and neutrophil infiltration were attenuated in NOX-1 null mice (deficient in the gp91 phox and p47 phox subunits of Nox) [35, 36] . NOX-1 inhibitors have been considered a potential therapy for ALI [34] . Therefore, NOX-1 inhibition might have an additional benefit in GLN-treated mice after ALI challenge. MPO is a useful marker of neutrophil infiltration in different ALI models [37, 38] . Our data showed that 3 h of ALI challenge resulted in significantly higher MPO activity than in unchallenged mice, but no abrogation effect was caused by GLN treatment. It is possible that the selected time point was not appropriate for GLN function, thus the decreased effect on MPO activity was not observed in our study, unlike previous reports [39, 40] . On the other hand, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling was believed to be another pathway of acid and LPS-induced ALI other than RAGE expression. In mice treated with adenovirusmediated siRNA targeting the TLR4 gene, a protective effect was shown against LPS challenge [41] . Thus, whether TLR4 signaling was involved in the beneficial effects of GLN remains to be explored in future studies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 8, "end": 12, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"},
