The assay is based on a time-gated luminescence microscopy technique enabling visualization and enumeration of individual germinating endospores. Germinating endospores release calcium dipicolinate to form highly luminescent terbium dipicolinate complexes surrounding each germinating endospore. EGA and heterotrophic plate counting (HPC) were used to evaluate the swab/rinse recovery efficiency of endospores from stainless steel surfaces. EGA and HPC results were highly correlated for endospore recovery from stainless steel coupons inoculated with range of 1,000 endospores per coupon down to sterility. Dosage-dependent decrease of surface endospore germinability were observed in dry heat, UV irradiation, oxygen plasma and vaporized hydrogen peroxide treatments, measured with EGA and HPC. EGA is a fast and complementary method to traditional HPC for quantitative sterility assurance testing of surfaces.

The major drawback is that HPC usually requires several days for results. Faster and more efficient methods have been proposed in recent years to measure microbial contamination of surfaces, such as ATP bioluminescence, enzyme, and nucleic acid-based techniques 26-30 . Yet, conventional cleaning practices of surfaces still largely do not include quantitative approaches for assessing the effectiveness of the cleaning regimen, because of cost, ease-of-use, or time-to-results. There is a need for fast, quantitative, cost effective and convenient methods to assess the level of contamination on surfaces in tracking routes of infection, surveillance of the environment and evaluation of decontamination protocols. The endospore germinability assay (EGA) addresses this need by enabling the fast measurement of germinable endospore populations, which serve as excellent indicators for measuring surface bioburden reduction, owing to their omnipresence in the environment, and because they are the hardiest microbial organisms. Consequently, a reduction of viable endospores necessarily indicates an even greater reduction in non-spore forming microorganisms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "The concept of endospores as bioindicators for monitoring sterilization effectiveness is extensively used in hospitals, where sterilization processes are monitored by using endospores as dosimeters (e.g., endospore test strips to verify autoclave compliance with regulatory requirements 31 ).

They are protected from environmental extremes and sterilants by a series of protective layers, including spore coat, peptidoglycan cortex, and a core that includes high concentrations of calcium dipicolinate stores 32-34 . Endospores can remain dormant for many years 35,36 , and when more favorable conditions are signaled by the presence of water, nutrients, and germinants, endospores may germinate and become metabolically active 22, 37, 38 . In the context of human health, this enables endospore-forming pathogens (e.g., B. anthracis, C. botulinum, and C. difficile) to persist after cleaning regimens are applied, causing contamination, food spoilage, and disease.

Defining viability for microorganisms is neither simple nor straightforward 51 . Endospores that give rise to colonies on growth media are clearly viable, and this is generally considered a reliable approach to demonstrating viability. However, culture-based methods often overlook more than 99% of the viable-but-not-culturable (VBNC) population of cells in environmental samples [52] [53] [54] , effectively representing a conservative lower limit estimate of viability. In contrast, germination accounts for a greater fraction of viable organisms, but may include a subset population of germinable-but-not-viable endospores. As a complement to culturability, however, germination may be considered an upper limit on the viable number of endospores. While germination is a process that is nutrient-induced, and nutrients supplied may not cause all spores to germinate 55, 56 , we have demonstrated the reproducible correlation of germination-capable populations to culturable populations within lab spore suspensions, and that this correlation can be extended to spore inactivation studies 39, 57 .
