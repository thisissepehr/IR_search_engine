            "text": "Background: Alternative splicing of Vascular endothelial growth factor-A mRNA transcripts (commonly referred as VEGF) leads to the generation of functionally differing isoforms, the relative amounts of which have potentially significant physiological outcomes in conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The effect of such isoforms on pulmonary vascular permeability is unknown. We hypothesised that VEGF 165 a and VEGF 165 b isoforms would have differing effects on pulmonary vascular permeability caused by differential activation of intercellular signal transduction pathways. Method: To test this hypothesis we investigated the physiological effect of VEGF 165 a and VEGF 165 b on Human Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial Cell (HPMEC) permeability using three different methods: trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER), Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) and FITC-BSA passage. In addition, potential downstream signalling pathways of the VEGF isoforms were investigated by Western blotting and the use of specific signalling inhibitors. Results: VEGF 165 a increased HPMEC permeability using all three methods (paracellular and transcellular) and led to associated VE-cadherin and actin stress fibre changes. In contrast, VEGF 165 b decreased paracellular permeability and did not induce changes in VE-cadherin cell distribution. Furthermore, VEGF 165 a and VEGF 165 b had differing effects on both the phosphorylation of VEGF receptors and downstream signalling proteins pMEK, p42/44MAPK, p38 MAPK, pAKT and peNOS. Interestingly specific inhibition of the pMEK, p38 MAPK, PI3 kinase and eNOS pathways blocked the effects of both VEGF 165 a and VEGF 165 b on paracellular permeability and the effect of VEGF 165 a on proliferation/migration, suggesting that this difference in cellular response is mediated by an as yet unidentified signalling pathway(s).",

            "text": "Background VEGF was originally identified by its properties as both a permogen and a mitogen, key elements in the function of the alveolar-capillary membrane, leading to interest in its role in many forms of lung disease particularly ARDS [1] [2] [3] . We and others found that VEGF levels were compartmentalised between the alveolar space and the vascular bed [4, 5] . Low levels of intrapulmonary VEGF were found in patients with ARDS with increasing intrapulmonary VEGF levels associated with recovery [5] . In contrast, plasma levels in patients with ARDS were elevated compared with normal, at-risk, or ventilated control subjects, with falling levels associated with recovery [6] . These data suggest that VEGF is beneficial in the alveolar space but detrimental in the vascular space. To explore the significance of these observations, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms that regulate VEGF bioactivity. VEGF exerts its biological effect through specific receptors, VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 and co-receptors, neuropilin-1 and neuropilin-2 [7] . In addition, alternative splicing of VEGF transcripts leads to the generation of several functionally different isoforms [8, 9] . We have previously explored changes in VEGF xxx -isoforms and receptor expression as mechanisms for regulating VEGF bioactivity and suggested that both these factors may contribute [10] but do not fully explain the reported contradictory findings. The VEGF xxx b isoform family consists of peptides of the same length as other forms but with a different Cterminal six amino acids-SLTRKD rather than CDKPRR [11] . The receptor binding and dimerisation domains are intact, but VEGF xxx b stimulates a unique pattern of VEGF-R2 tyrosine residue phosphorylation, contrasting with those activated by conventional isoforms [9] . Two specific isoforms, VEGF 165 a and VEGF 165 b isoforms were shown to have contrasting effects on the epithelial and endothelial sides of the alveolar-capillary membrane [12] . These data suggest a pneumotropic effect which could be beneficial within the alveolar space following ARDS. However, the effect of these isoforms on vascular permeability another key element of ARDS is unknown.",

We went on to analyse potential cytoskeleton remodelling induced by VEGF isoforms. VE-cadherin has been particularly associated with endothelial cell adherens junctions but may also contribute to change in tight junction activity [19, 20] . a c b Fig. 1 HPMEC stimulated with 20 ng/ml of VEGF 165 a, VEGF 165 b or without any stimulation (control). a Paracellular permeability was quantified by TEER using endohm-12 system in HPMEC cultured in inserts. VEGF 165 a reduced resistance (increased permeability) *p < 0.05 (45 min onwards) and VEGF 165 b increased resistance (decreased permeability) ***p < 0.001 (15 to 45 min) compared to control. b ECIS measurements on HPMEC show that VEGF 165 a reduced the resistance (increased permeability) significantly***p < 0.001 in comparison to control; whereas VEGF 165 b had an opposite effect with a significant increase (*p < 0.05) in the resistance (reduced permeability). Data expressed as a mean fold-change compared to control over time. c The passage of FITC-coupled BSA across the monolayer of HPMEC was monitored over a period of 90 min. The fluorescence intensity of the aliquots was quantified and data was expressed as cumulative FITC-BSA over time. Concentration of FITC-BSA in the lower chamber slowly increased in both control cells and those stimulated with VEGF 165 b; in contrast cells stimulated with VEGF 165 a showed a significant increase in the passage of FITC-BSA p < 0.01 after 60 min. Each experiment was performed in triplicate (n = 5-8). All data were analysed using two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post-test for multiple analysis and plotted as mean \u00b1 SEM Previously, a changed distribution to a zig-zag pattern in VEGF 165 a treated human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) was demonstrated using 100 ng/ml stimulation [20] . We repeated this experiment using HPMEC and showed similar results suggesting a significant change in VE-cadherin distribution between the cells stimulated with VEGF 165 a (Fig. 2a) . Visible gaps appeared between the cells with an apparent zig-zag pattern of VE-cadherin distribution between adjacent cells. In contrast, stimulation with the VEGF 165 b isoform induced minimal change compared to untreated control cells suggesting it did not induce VE-cadherin reorganisation (Fig. 2a ). In addition, changes in the actin structure were observed between the stimulated and the unstimulated cells demonstrating an increase of stress fibres across the cells and more actin filopodia with VEGF 165 a. Again, in contrast, there was only a partial induction of actin filaments in the cell periphery and stress fibres by VEGF 165 b (Fig. 2b) . These data led to the hypothesis that VEGF 165 a and VEGF 165 b activate different signalling pathways involved in permeability in HPMEC.",

Stimulation with VEGF 165 a also induced a significant phosphorylation of AKT at 5 (p < 0.05) and 10 min (p < 0.01) and returned to control levels at 60 min. LY294002 compounds is an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and inactivation of PI3K have been reported to lead to dephosphorylation of Akt that subsequently stop G1 cycle in cell growth and ultimately lead to cell apoptosis [34, 35] . Co-culture with LY294002 to block AKT protein inhibited both the permeability effects of VEGF 165 a and VEGF 165 b on HPMEC (Fig. 5 f and g) . In contrast with the permeability assay where the cell monolayer was stable over the experiment (2 h), inhibition of AKT for long periods (24 h) induced cell death so we were unable to undertake the scratch assay as a migration/proliferation model. Finally, we investigated the potential of the eNOS pathway for differential effects. There is a significant body of evidence to suggest that endothelial nitric oxide (synthesised by eNOS) may have a crucial role in causing hyperpermeability in response to pro-inflammatory agents such as VEGF [36, 37] . Therefore, the effects of the different VEGF isoforms on the eNOS phosphorylation in HPMEC were studied.",

Despite this, there is a very limited understanding of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of pulmonary endothelial cell (EC) barrier function integrity, which is so essential for maintaining this critical function of the lung. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was originally described as both an angiogenic and a permeability factor [39] and its effects have previously been studied using the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) as the archetypal EC. Large organ functional differences are reflected in the variability of endothelial cell junction structure and composition particularly relevant in the functional differences between the pulmonary and systemic circulation (See figure on previous page.)

To explore our hypothesis and its relationship to previous clinical studies (5, 6) it was important to study the response of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (HPMEC) to VEGF isoforms. Among all the pathological processes involved in. ARDS increases in lung vessel permeability are critical and non-redundant [42] . The measurement of permeability in this study has been undertaken only in-vitro models with self-evident limitations [43] . Transport of plasma proteins, cell and solutes across monolayers occurs paracellularly via specialised endothelial cell-cell junctions, or transcellularly by special transport mechanism including transcytosis, via transcellular channels or cell membrane transporter proteins.",

The integrity of the adherens junction is particularly critical for regulating paracellular permeability via homophilic adhesions between VE-cadherin molecules [19, 20] . Disruptions of these domains lead to downstream events that result in organisational changes in the actin cytoskeleton [44] . The transcellular pathway is responsible for the transport of larger molecules such as albumin across endothelial cell monolayers, classically via transcellular pores associated with caveolae and lipid rafts [45] . Traditionally these pathways have been considered independent but there is now a body of evidence showing interdependence [46] . Following on from this, the in-vitro methods of measuring permeability that we have used, TEER (thought to reflect only paracellular permeability) and FITC-BSA (thought to only reflect transcellular mechanism) are recognised to have influences from crosstalk between both pathways [15] .",

This suggested that the differences were due to divergence of signalling pathways and therefore potential targets for amelioration of outcome e.g. reducing permeability whilst preserving a pneumotropic effect. To verify this hypothesis, different protein inhibitors have been used to look at their effect on the change in resistance reflecting the paracellular permeability pathway of pulmonary microvascular ECs.",

Being part of the same signalling pathway these results suggest that VEGF cell paracellular permeability involves the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT pathway, which then further phosphorylates and activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) [49] . Also, the inhibition of pMEK and p38 MAPK did not affect VEGF isoforms activity on the proliferation and paracellular permeability pathway in HPMEC. In summary, the inhibitors chosen did not allow for the identification of specific differential pathways between VEGF 165 a and VEGF 165 b. Further studies of other pathways are required in order to unravel the molecules responsible for the differential permeability effects of VEGF isoforms such as Src kinase pathway and its role in the regulation of endothelial-barrier integrity as demonstrated recently by Gao et al.

In the context of ARDS, VEGF (from the alveolus) may be a triggering component leading to further endothelial dysfunction and failure of the ACM. The data presented has shown that exposure of HPMEC to exogenous VEGF 165 a significantly increased endothelial cell monolayer permeability which would lead to failure of the ACM barrier function, of particular significance in the lung environment. On the other hand, depending on the isoforms present, VEGF may also be a protective agent, the data presented showing a decrease in permeability with VEGF 165 b exposure. Further work will need to be undertaken to clearly identify the divergence in the permeability signalling pathway induced by both isoforms and the potential protective proprieties of VEGF 165 b. ",

Stimulation with VEGF 165 a increased phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and p42/p44 at 5 and 10 min in contrast with VEGF 165 b which induced increased phosphorylation only at 10 min for both proteins. c & d Measurement of cells resistance by Endohm system. Dotted lines correspond to cell pre-incubated with pMEK inhibitor UO126. UO126 inhibited the effect of VEGF 165 a (c) and the effect of VEGF 165 b (d). e Graphs represent the mean of the scratched area in HPMEC treated with UO126 inhibitor at 24 h relative to control. VEGF 165 a but not VEGF 165 b stimulation significantly diminished scratched area (p = 0.004) and was inhibited by UO126 (p = 0.03). Densitometry and scratch assay analysed by Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc Dunn's analysis. TEER measurement analysed using two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post-test.
