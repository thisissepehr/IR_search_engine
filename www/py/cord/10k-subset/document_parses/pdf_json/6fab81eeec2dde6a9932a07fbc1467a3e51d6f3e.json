For more than 125 years, the therapy against diphtheria has been based on polyclonal horse sera directed against Dt (diphtheria antitoxin; DAt). Animal sera have many disadvantages including serum sickness, batch-to-batch variation in quality and the use of animals for production. In this work, 400 human recombinant antibodies were generated against DT from two different phage display panning strategies using a human immune library. A panning in microtiter plates resulted in 22 unique in vitro neutralizing antibodies and a panning in solution combined with a functional neutralization screening resulted in 268 in vitro neutralizing antibodies. 61 unique antibodies were further characterized as scFv-Fc with 35 produced as fully human IgG1. The best in vitro neutralizing antibody showed an estimated relative potency of 454 IU/mg and minimal effective dose 50% (MED50%) of 3.0 pM at a constant amount of DT (4x minimal cytopathic dose) in the IgG format. The targeted domains of the 35 antibodies were analyzed by immunoblot and by epitope mapping using phage display. All three Dt domains (enzymatic domain, translocation domain and receptor binding domain) are targets for neutralizing antibodies. When toxin neutralization assays were performed at higher toxin dose levels, the neutralizing capacity of individual antibodies was markedly reduced but this was largely compensated for by using two or more antibodies in combination, resulting in a potency of 79.4 IU/mg in the in vivo intradermal challenge assay. these recombinant antibody combinations are candidates for further clinical and regulatory development to replace equine DAt.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Diphtheria is an infectious disease and caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The bacterium primarily infects the throat and upper airways but can also affect other body sites. The produced toxin can spread through the bloodstream and affect organs, such as the heart and kidneys. In severe cases, diphtheria toxin (DT) may cause myocarditis or peripheral neuropathy. Due to a membrane of dead tissue over the throat and tonsils, swallowing and breathing can be difficult. The disease is spread through direct physical contact or by coughing or sneezing of infected individuals 1-3 . Diphtheria is fatal in 5-10% of cases, but children under the age of five have a mortality rate of up to 20%. Treatment involves antibiotics to kill the bacteria (erythromycin or penicillin for 14 days) and administering of diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) to neutralize the effects of the toxin 4-6 . C. diphtheriae was identified as the causative agent of diphtheria in 1883 and in 1888 the diphtheria toxin was first described in the culture medium of C. diphtheriae 7 . The gene for DT is encoded on a corynebacteriophage 8,9 and the toxin is secreted as a single polypeptide chain of 535 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 58 kDa 10,11 . Mild trypsinization and reduction of DT in vitro generates two fragments, A and B, which remain covalently attached by an inter-chain disulfide bond 12 . Fragment A contains the enzymatic activity, whereas fragment B binds the protein to the cell surface receptors and promotes translocation of fragment A to the cytoplasm 13,14 . DT is composed of three structural domains: the catalytic domain (C) corresponds to fragment A (21 kDa) while the transmembrane (T) domain (20 kDa) and receptor binding (R) domain (17 kDa) comprise fragment B (37 kDa) (Fig. 1) 15 .

Interestingly, both of the best neutralizing antibodies directed to the R-domain (see below) have the VH4-34 V-gene. The binding of the neutralizing antibodies to DT and the mutant CRM197 48, 49 was analyzed and reduced binding to CRM197 was seen for many of the selected antibodies. This result is in accordance with Bigio et al. 60 who found, that the conformation of CRM197, which has only one amino acid change in the catalytic center, is not identical to wildtype DT. The antibodies were initially analyzed in the scFv-Fc format because the conversion from scFv to scFv-Fc is only one cloning step 61 . For further in vitro and in vivo assays, 35 selected antibodies were converted to the IgG format because IgGs are the preferred format for therapeutic antibodies 54 . Here, differences in the EC50 between the scFv-Fc format and IgG were measured. A few antibodies lost affinity by cloning from scFv to IgG format, possibly due to different folding or the reduced flexibility of the angle between VH and VL in the Fab/IgG compared to the scFv format because of the stabilization by CH1+ CL 37, 62, 63 . Conversely, the affinity was improved for the antibody ewe192-D8 whose initially weak EC50 increased by around 10-fold following conversion to IgG. The EC50 values determined by MST differed to that measured in ELISA by a factor of ~100. In ELISA the analyzed antibodies had an EC50 value of under 1 nM. The interaction in ELISA is measured on immobilized DT and not in solution which likely explains the vast difference to the MST results.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 517, "end": 519, "text": "56", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 980, "end": 982, "text": "57", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1207, "end": 1209, "text": "58", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1336, "end": 1338, "text": "59", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1529, "end": 1532, "text": "48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1533, "end": 1535, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1672, "end": 1674, "text": "60", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1944, "end": 1946, "text": "61", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 2111, "end": 2113, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2438, "end": 2441, "text": "37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2442, "end": 2445, "text": "62,", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 2446, "end": 2448, "text": "63", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The recognized domains and minimal epitope regions of the neutralizing antibodies were determined by immunoblot or phage display.

Using both approaches, the binding domain was identified for 33 antibodies, but it was not possible to identify the epitope domain for one of the antibodies. It was possible to narrow down the minimal epitope region (MER) to 14 amino acids in the best case. For two of the analyzed antibodies, the complete C-domain was selected by phage display, indicating that the epitope is not linear. Interestingly, these two antibodies bound the C-domain in western blot after SDS-PAGE, indicating sufficient refolding of the C-domain on the PVDF membrane. In the case of ewe192-H8, domain mapping revealed that only the B-fragment was the antibody target and not a specific domain within that fragment of DT. However, using the phage display approach the T-domain of the B-fragment was identified showing that the conformation of the recognized MER may depend on the formation of T-and R-domains.
