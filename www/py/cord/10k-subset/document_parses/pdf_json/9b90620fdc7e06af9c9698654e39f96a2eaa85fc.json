The adrenal blood supply of between 50 and 60 small branches emanating from the three suprarenal arteries feeds into a subcapsular plexus, which drains into medullary sinusoids by relatively few venules. This is known as a \"vascular dam.\" In addition to this peculiar vascular arrangement, the adrenal glands are also very susceptible at times of stress, when there may be up to a sevenfold increase in cortisol production as well as a great increase in vascularity of the glands themselves. Several risk factors for adrenal hemorrhage have been identified: i) severe systemic illnesses, such as heart disease or infection; ii) previous thromboembolic disease, on the basis of a coagulopathy; and iii) the postoperative state (137) .
