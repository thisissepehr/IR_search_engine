At various time intervals, media and homogenates of the tissue were assayed for lingual lipase and amylase activity and percentage secretion calculated. Histamine elicited moderate secretion (~ 10%) of lingual lipase and amylase. In contrast, pyrilamine, an H1 receptor antagonist, elicited >60% secretion. There were statistically significant differences between the percentage secretion of lingual lipase and amylase for basal secretion, as well as for histamine-and pyrilamine-evoked secretion above basal. The H 2 receptor inhibitors, cimetidine and ranitidine, stimulated secretion of only amylase, but not lingual lipase. When combined with histamine, these antagonists partially inhibited only the secretion of histamineevoked lingual lipase, but not amylase. The differences in percentage secretion between the two enzymes indicate that exocytosis may not be the only process involved in protein secretion. The anomalous effects of the H~ and H 2 receptor antagonists necessitate a more detailed characterization of the receptors of von Ebner's glands.",

            "text": "The effect of histamine on minor salivary gland secretion has not been investigated. Thus, it is of interest to investigate the role of histamine in the regulation of secretion of protein from rat von Ebner's (lingual serous) glands, a minor exocrine salivary gland. Von Ebner's glands of rat tongue are located in the posterior portion of the tongue, embedded between the muscle fibers beneath the vallate and foliate papillae [15] . A unique function of these minor salivary glands is to secrete the digestive enzyme, lingual lipase [16] . Lingual lipase is the enzyme responsible for the first step of fat digestion. Lingual lipase hydrolyzes triacylglycerol at the acid pH of the stomach producing amphipathic products that form emulsions which aid in the further digestion of fats by pancreatic lipase [17, 18] . Von Ebner's glands also secrete amylase [16] . The regulation of protein secretion from yon Ebner's glands differs from other salivary glands. Protein secretion from the parotid gland is mediated mainly by the fi-adrenergic receptor and fluid secretion is mediated by the cholinergic receptor [19] . Cholinergic stimulation (carbamylcholine chloride, pilocarpine) is the primary mechanism of protein secretion from yon Ebner's glands. Isoproterenol (fl-adrenergic) elieited minor secretion and phenylephrine (~-adrenergic) evoked no response [16] . In addition, in von Ebner's gland protein secretion is also elicited by substance P [20] . In the present study, the effects of histamine on the secretion of lingual lipase and amylase from von Ebner's glands were investigated. The role of H1 and H 2 receptors in histamine-evoked secretion was evaluated with the H1 receptor antagonist, pyrilamine, and the H2 receptor antagonists, cimetidine and ranitidine.",

Briefly, Sprague-Dawley male rats, 200 _+ 30 g, certified free of sialodacryoadenitis and rat corona viruses, were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Raleigh, NC and housed under controlled temperature, humidity, and lighting (on at 0800 and off at 2000 h daily), and allowed unlimited access to water and a commercial pelleted diet. For each experiment, eight rats were fasted overnight, anesthetized with nembutal (50 mg/kg, i.p.), and exsanguinated. Tongues were removed and the glands dissected one at a time, being careful to exclude any mucous glands which are found posterior and lateral to von Ebner's glands. The glands were minced and pooled in 1.33 ml DMEM, previously gassed with 95% 02, 5% CO2. The glands were gassed after each addition of tissue. When all the glands were dissected, DMEM was added and the tissue randomly divided into eight 50 ml round-bottom polycarbonate tubes. Controls, to determine basal secretion, were done in duplicate with each experiment and all test samples were in duplicate. After centrifugation to 240 x,q, the media were aspirated and discarded. One milliliter DMEM or 1 ml ofa DMEM solution of a receptor antagonist was added to the tubes for preincubation. The tubes were gassed and incubated for 20rain at 37uC in an AO water bath shaker at 90 cycles/min. The media were aspirated and discarded and l ml of DMEM alone (basal secretion) or DMEM solutions of the agonist, antagonist, or the solution of the agonist plus the solution of the antagonist were added to the tissue. The incubation was carried out with gassing every 15 min. Aliquots of 0.2 ml were removed (0.1 ml into two cryogenic tubes) at 30, 60, and 90min and replaced with 0.2ml of the appropriate solution. Experiments with pyrilamine and some experiments with histamine were also aliquoted at 15 min. At the final time interval (90min), all the media were aspirated and stored in two cryogenic tubes/ sample in liquid nitrogen. The tissue was washed with DMEM, frozen on dry ice, thawed, and then homogenized with a Polytron (Brinkmann Instruments) for 30 s in Tyrode's solution (glucose-free), total volume = 4 ml. The homogenates were centrifuged for 15min at 850x g and the supernatants were stored in two cryogenic tubes/sample in liquid nitrogen.",

            "text": "Franklin [10] found that 1 mM histamine stimulates pancreatic enzyme secretion from in vitro isolated rabbit pancreas preparations and Pariente et al. [25] found that intravenous infusions of histamine also increased enzyme secretion from the rabbit pancreas. In addition, amylase secretion was elicited by 0.01mM histamine from isolated guinea-pig pancreas [11] , any by 1 mM histamine in isolated segments of guinea-pig pancreas [12] . In contrast, histamine evoked fluid secretion from the parotid [13] and submandibular glands [9, 13] of cats and dogs. Evidence for the physiological role of histamine as a mediator in parasympathetic induction of salivary secretion and in secretion from the stomach comes from the work of Lorenz and coworkers. Histamine was found in stomach tissue [6, 26] , the pancreas [26] , parotid and submandibular glands [27] , in submandibular and parotid saliva [14] and the tongue [26] . Especially interesting are the findings by Lorenz et al. [26] that histamine is present in the area of the tongue, between the root and the body, where von Ebner's gland is located and that it can be released from this area by compound 48/80. In addition, enzymes involved in histamine metabolism were found in many species in the parotid and submandibular glands and the gastric mucosa. Histidine decarboxylase was found in the parotid [28] and the submandibular [27, 28] glands. Histamine methyl transferase was detected in the parotid and submandibular glands [28, 29] and in the gastric mucosa [29] . Diamine oxidase was demonstrated in the parotid and submandibular glands [28, 30] and in the gastric mucosa [30] . This is a dose response curve showing the percentage secrehou above basal of lingual lipase and amylase evoked by 0.001-10 mM pyrilamine incubated with minced yon Ebner's tissue for 60min. The values for basal secretion were 9.94+_0.91% and 13.38 +_0.37% percentage secretion for lingual lipase and amylase, respectively; n=4 6, n= 1 for data at 0.001 raM. Time course of the percentage secretion above basal of lingual lipase and amylase when minced von Ebner's glands were incubated with 10raM pyrilamine. Media sampling was done at 15, 30, 60, and 90 rain. Homogenates of the tissue taken at 90min and all media samples were assayed for lingual lipase and amylase. Statistical evaluation of all pyrilamine data was by the split-plot ANOVA using Bonferroni's correction on log,, transformed data with multiple and individual comparisons. The percentage secretion of lingual lipase was significantly different from the percentage secretion of amylase at 30, 60, and 90rain, p-0.0021, 0.0042, 0.0264, respectively, n-6. The 15min data were not included in the overall ANOVA due to smaller sample size, n = 3. The values for basal secretion for lingual lipase were 3.42+0.45%, 5 Mast cells, a source of released histamine, were found in the submandibular gland, but they are not the sole source of histamine released from the gland [27] . Mast cells have also been found in the tongue [26] and in von Ebner's gland [Redman, R.S., unpublished observations]. In von Ebner's gland they are widely scattered, some are adjacent to the acinus, and many are near the ducts, in the stroma, blood vessels, and muscle bundles. The density of these mast cells is similar to those seen in the tongue [26] . These findings of histamine content in and release from the stomach, parotid and submandibular glands, and the tongue and the detection of enzymes of histamine metabolism in the stomach, parotid and submandibular glands provide further evidence that histamine plays a role in the regulation of secretion. Studies to characterize the histamine receptor in von Ebner's gland revealed unusual findings. Treatment of minced von Ebner's glands with the H2 receptor antagonists, cimetidine and ranitidine, evoked differential results in the stimulation of secretion of lingual lipase and amylase and in the inhibition of the secretion of each enzyme elicited by histamine. Both antagonists stimulated secretion of amylase but not lingual lipase and they both had some inhibitory effect on the histamine-stimulated secretion of lingual lipase, but they had no effect on the histamine-stimulated secretion of amylase. The results gave no clear indication that histamine binds to an H 2 receptor or even that this receptor is present in von Ebner's gland. The results are similar to those found in the rabbit pancreas by Pariente et al. [25, 31] . Injection of cimetidine into an infusion of anesthetized rabbits increased both pancreatic juice flow and enzyme output [31] , and in addition, infusion of histamine plus cimetidine increased the flow rate and protein output above infusion with histamine alone [25] . HI and H2 receptors act through different signal transduction pathways. The H z receptor stimulates the adenylate cyclase system [2, 5, 32] and the H t receptor acts primarily through the phosphatidyl inositol system [1, 2, 33] . Increased cytosolic Ca 2 + was found in the cytosol of the exocrine pancreas after stimulation with histamine [12] . Thus, the H1 receptor antagonist, pyrilamine, was tested as an inhibitor of histamine evoked secretion of lingual lipase and amylase. A most unexpected finding was that pyrilamine was a very potent stimulator of lingual lipase and amylase secretion. It was more effective in stimulating secretion of lingual lipase and amylase than carbamylcholine chloride. Greater than 60% lingual lipase and amylase were secreted above basal in 90 rain of incubation with 10raM pyrilamine, whereas in vitro incubations with carbamylcholine chloride resulted in secretion of 55.9 +2.4% lingual lipase and 28.0+2.5% amylase in 90min [16] . Only in vivo i.p. injections of pilocarpine caused greater secretion. Von Ebner's glands were maximally depleted of both enzymes in 1 h, with 25.9+3.4% lingual lipase and 31.8+6.4~ amylase remaining in the glands [16] . Pyrilamine, which is also known as mepyramine (Merck Index, 9th edition, 7767, 1976), is the classical antagonist of the H1 receptor and has been used to characterize HI receptors for many years [2] . However, in yon Ebner's gland, pyrilamine functions as a secretagogue for protein secretion and could possibly have a receptor that differs from the H~ receptor. Leurs et al. [33] found that in rat liver plasma membranes, [3HI mepyramine labels non-H t re-ceptors. These authors suggest the presence of an ethylenediamine recognition site and warn against using mepyramine binding as the sole indicator of the presence of the H 1 receptor. Lorenz et al. [-9] also found that in dog submandibular glands, unlike other antihistamines which inhibit salivation stimulated by histamine, mepyramine, stimulates fluid secretion and the release of histamine. In addition to the anomalous histamine receptor results, the present studies have confirmed previous findings of differences in the percentage secretion of lingual lipase and amylase when stimulated to secrete by carbachol, isoproterenol, forskolin [16] , and substance P [20] . In the present studies, statistically significant differences were found in basal secretion of lingual lipase and amylase at 15, 30, and 60min and also in percentage secretion above basal when the tissue was treated with histamine at 60 and 90 min or pyrilamine at 15, 30, and 60min. However, when the total percentage secretion was analyzed, there was no significant difference in the percentage secretion during pyrilamine treatment at all time intervals and only statistically different at 30 min with histamine. When the basal secretion values at each time interval are subtracted from the results of treated samples, the assumption is made that basal secretion continues during the secretagogue stimulation. This could probably occur if basal secretion is by a pathway that is different from stimulated secretion. Explanation of the phenomena of differential secretion of two enzymes is very difficult. If the proteins are packaged in the same secretory granules and exocytosis is the only means of secretion from secretory granules, the percentage secretion of both enzymes should be the same and both enzymes should be similarly effected by agonists and antagonists. However, there are many instances of \"nonparallel\" protein secretion from the pancreas [34] . Among the possible reasons for these results are the presence of more than one secretory pathway, a variety of secretory granules containing different enzyme compositions, or interactions of the enzymes with membrane proteins of the secretory granules that may effect the release of the enzymes [35] . It is also possible that constitutive secretion [36] may play a role in these phenomena. The results presented in this paper indicate that in order to learn more about the regulation of secretion from von Ebner's gland, there must be further characterization of the receptors of von Ebner's gland.",
