They are often receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics; they have multiple entry points for pathogens; and their immune system is impaired by blood circuit interaction. These factors are thought to predispose them to fungal infections. We thus aimed to evaluate the prevalence, risk factors, and prognosis of fungal infections in adults on ECMO. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry, which compiles data on ECMO use from hundreds of international centers. We included all adult patients from 2006 to 2016 on any mode of ECMO with either a diagnosis of fungal infection or a positive fungal culture. Results: Our study comprised 2129 adult patients (10.8%) with fungal colonization or infection. Aspergillus involvement (colonization or infection) was present in 272 patients (1.4%), of whom 35.7% survived to hospital discharge. There were 245 patients (1.2%) with Candida invasive bloodstream infection, with 35.9% survival. Risk factors for Aspergillus involvement included solid organ transplant (OR 1.83; p = 0.008), respiratory support (OR 2.75; p < 0.001), and influenza infection (OR 2.48; p < 0.001). Risk factors for candidemia included sepsis (OR 1.60; p = 0. 005) and renal replacement therapy (OR 1.55; p = 0.007). In multivariable analysis, Aspergillus involvement (OR 0.40; p < 0.001) and candidemia (OR 0.47; p < 0.001) were both independently associated with decreased survival. Conclusions: The prevalence of Aspergillus involvement and Candida invasive bloodstream infection were not higher in patients on ECMO than what has been reported in the general intensive care population. Both were independently associated with a reduced survival. Aspergillus involvement was strongly associated with ECMO for respiratory support and influenza.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Critically ill patients are at increased risk of fungal infections. Candida and Aspergillus are the most frequently isolated fungi in the intensive care unit (ICU). In fact, Candida is the third most prevalent microorganism in patients with infections the ICU [1] . It is responsible for 12% of ICU-acquired bloodstream infections [2] . Nosocomial Candida bloodstream infection (CBSI) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality as well as a prolonged hospital length of stay compared with other bloodstream infections [3] . Crude mortalities of 40-60% and attributable mortalities of 5-71% have been reported in patients with Candida infection in the ICU [4] [5] [6] . Invasive aspergillosis (IA) has typically been described in patients with hematological malignancies and profound immunosuppression, but recent evidence has suggested that it may be present in a significant proportion of critically ill patients without these conventional risk factors [7] . Researchers in previous studies have reported a 1-2% prevalence of Aspergillus [8] [9] [10] [11] in the respiratory tract of mechanically ventilated patients and up to 8% in those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [12] . In an autopsy series of patients who died of ARDS, a prevalence of 12.5% was described [13] .

These data are more in line with the 7.2% prevalence found in an Australian ICU in a review of their ECMO cases between 2005 and 2011 [20] . There was a much lower prevalence of Aspergillus involvement in the ELSO registry. The first caveat in interpreting the rates of Aspergillus involvement is that microscopic examination and culture of respiratory tract specimens have a combined sensitivity of only 50% for IA [21] . Second, discriminating between colonization and infection is always challenging without histology. Biopsies are rarely performed in ECMO patients, because they are at high risk of bleeding owing to systemic anticoagulation, platelet and coagulation factor consumption, and increased fibrinolysis associated with the extracorporeal circuit. Nonneutropenic patients most often do not display the characteristic radiological signs of IA [22] . Furthermore, many patients had respiratory failure with already abnormal chest imaging results before developing IA. Newer tests such as galactomannan and PCR of serum or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens have been developed to improve the diagnostic yield for IA [23] . However, results of such tests, if performed, were not collected in the database. Blot and colleagues have described and validated an algorithm for use in diagnosing aspergillosis in critically ill individuals [24] . However, the ELSO registry did not collect all the variables needed to apply their definitions. In addition, whether Aspergillus isolated in the lower respiratory tract of critically ill patients can be viewed as a contaminant or colonizer remains a matter of debate [25, 26] . Meersseman and colleagues reported an overall survival of 20% in patients without hematological malignancy with evidence of Aspergillus involvement [14] . The higher survival that we found could be due to the fact that ECMO patients, although acutely very ill, are younger and have fewer comorbidities than the general ICU population.
