The targets are not always exclusively proteins, but could include lipids or glycolipids, as well. Our aim in the present review is to summarize and highlight the possibility that antiganglioside antibodies (AGAs) could have a pathophysiological role and help in the diagnostics or prognostic evaluation of the diseases. AGAs are autoantibodies produced against gangliosides, which are sialic acid containing glycosphingolipids (Box 1). Since their discovery, AGAs have been linked to a wide variety of pathologies, notably inflammatory neuropathies following an immunological insult. 3, 4 In recent years, gangliosides received renewed interest as targets for cancer immunotherapy. It is known that the GD3 ganglioside is strongly expressed by melanoma cells. 5, 6 The clearest pathophysiological role for AGAs has been demonstrated in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS).

In general, sialic acids are not very immunogenic, although in some cases and with specific sialic acids immunization may occur and cause immune damage (see below). Gangliosides function in the recognition and protection of host organs and tissues from complement attack by binding the complement regulatory protein factor H. 36 The complement system has a potentially strong cytotoxic and inflammationinducing activity. Sialic acids provide a robust protection against complement killing of autologous cells. This is mediated by the binding of the soluble complement inhibitor factor H to the surface sialic acids, when the surfaces are threatened by C3b deposition. 37 Structural studies have shown that the specific targets for factor H include the \u03b12-3 linked sialic acid glycans of the GD3 ganglioside. 38 Thus, on surfaces, where the complement component C3b has become accidentally bound, the neighboring sialic acids provide the additional affinity to bind the complement inhibitory factor H instead of the activation promoting factor B, which does not bind to sialic acids. 36 Gangliosides play an important role in maintaining the integrity of lipid rafts, particular cell membrane microdomains. 22, 33 Changes in ganglioside composition of lipid rafts may cause alterations in the modes of interactions with individual counterpart proteins, or phospholipid and cholesterol molecules. 22 These may be involved in signaling, generation of focal synapse-like points of interactions and removal of membrane components by internalization or exocytosis. 39 Such events may take place in T lymphocytes during their activation by various signals. 40 Thus, defects in membrane lipid rafts could contribute to dysfunction of CD4+ T helper cells and consequent autoimmunity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 474, "end": 476, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 816, "end": 818, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 956, "end": 958, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1231, "end": 1233, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1354, "end": 1357, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1358, "end": 1360, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1543, "end": 1545, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1707, "end": 1709, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1798, "end": 1800, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "IMMUNOLOGICAL ROLES OF GANGLIOSIDES"}, {"text": "A set of mammalian proteins, more than 150, are anchored to the outer leaflets of cell membranes via a GPI-lipid anchor, which is a standard means of membrane protein anchoring in protozoan parasites.

Gangliosides are sialylated glycosphingolipids. Their synthesis consists of the sequential addition of sugars and/or sialic acids (neuraminic acid; NeuAc) by two main groups of enzymes, i.e., sialyltransferases (GM3/GD3/GT3 synthases and ST3GAL2/ ST3GAL3) and glycosyltransferases (B4GALNT1 and B3GALT4). 19, 148 The letters M (1), D (2), T (3) and Q (4) indicate the number of sialic acid residues, respectively. The numbers, on the other hand, indicate indirectly the number of sugar residues subtracted from 5: e.g., GM1 contains 5-1 = 4 sugar residues, and GD3 contains 5-3 = 2 sugar residues. Abbreviations: beta-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferase 1 (B4GALNT1), beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase 4 (B3GALT4), ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 2 (ST3GAL2), ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 3 (ST3GAL3) synaptic transmission. In general, gangliosides seem to have important roles in the maintenance of the nervous system. Various diseases, especially those involving the neurological system and many neurodegenerative diseases may arise from disturbed ganglioside metabolism or alternatively from the action of antibodies directed against single or multiple targets. In 2004 mutations to GM3 synthase were identified as the cause of an autosomal recessive infantile-onset epilepsy syndrome. 47 In addition, mutations in ST3GAL5, which codes for an enzyme necessary for ganglioside biosynthesis, result in an early-onset seizure disorder with motor and cognitive disturbances. Furthermore, mutations in B4GALNT1, a gene encoding for another enzyme of the ganglioside biosynthetic pathways, result in hereditary spastic paraplegia and intellectual deficits. 10 In addition to gangliosidoses, ganglioside accumulation diseases, also diseases like infantile epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and multiple sclerosis (MS) may involve disturbed ganglioside metabolism. 48 On the other hand, the peripheral neuropathy Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is an example of a disease associated with production of autoreactive antiganglioside antibodies (AGAs). 49 As studied by Ceccarelli et al. already in the 70's, gangliosides can promote the regeneration of injured neurons. 26 Exogenously administered gangliosides mimic endogenous gangliosides through their insertion into the plasma membranes after first adhering as micelles. 25 During recent years, exogenous purified gangliosides have been used experimentally to treat certain neurological diseases. 48 AGAs have been found in a variety of disorders classically considered to be of exclusive neurological interest. Anti-GM1 AGAs have been found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. 50 AD has been also related to IgM anti-GD1b 51,52 and anti-GQ1b\u03b1 antibodies, although the latter association has received discordant views in the literature. 53, 54 It appears that GM1-amyloid-beta protein complexes have the capacity to increase A\u03b2 assembly. 55 To further complicate the picture, Svennerholm et al in 2002, reported a slowing of the degenerative process in Alzheimer's disease patients treated with exogenous GM1. 21 Similarly to AD, association to anti-GM1 antibodies has been found also in Parkinson disease 56 and GM1 supplementation has been studied as a possible treatment strategy 57 . The presence of AGA in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has been investigated, but recent studies found no differences between ALS patients and healthy controls. 58 AGA were also sporadically identified in cases of myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton syndrome 59, 60 and in a single case of small fiber neuropathy 61 . Because of their ubiquitous nature in the neuronal system, it is not surprising that gangliosides have potentially multiple pathological roles in neurological diseases.

According to Hughes and Cornblath, antibodies to GM1, GM1b, GD1a, and GalNac-GD1a are in particular implicated in acute motor axonal neuropathy and also, with the exception of GalNac-GD1a, in acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy. 81, 88, 89 Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS) was described for the first time in 1956 by Charles Fisher Miller. 90 It is characterized by the clinical triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and areflexia. Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (BEE), clinically very similar to MFS, is characterized by hypersomnolence, ophthalmoplegia and ataxia. 82 Both syndromes are associated with anti-GQ1b antibodies, suggesting that they are two distinct manifestations of a single disease spectrum. 91, 92 Subsequent testing of the anti-GQ1b antibodies revealed that they react also with GD3 and GT1b gangliosides, making it difficult to identify a clear target for the immunological attack. 93 As is apparent from the above, there is no doubt that antiganglioside antibodies may cause a variety of serious neurological diseases. However, antibodies alone rarely cause target cell damage. They recruit the complement system, leukocytes and other effector mechanisms into the area of antibody deposition. They mediate inflammation and cell injury, whose extent depends on the types of antibodies (class, subclass, target specificity and affinity), individual patterns or reactivity (including the MHC-type determining the extent of T cell help) and target cell sensitivity to damage. Importantly, sialic acids on gangliosides usually protect cells from complement attack, but this protection may fail, if AGAs neutralize the protective layer on cell surfaces. As pointed out above, the complement inhibitor factor H is a key player in protecting host cells from complement attack, because it binds directly to gangliosides in the context of prior antibody-mediated C3b deposition.

The most important pathogen associated with GBS is Campylobacter jejuni. 9,94 Almost three-quarters of the GBS patients developed the disease after a gastrointestinal or respiratory infection. 94 The onset of GBS can be explained by the molecular mimicry that occurs between gangliosides and the campylobacter's lipooligosaccharides (LOS). 7 Although GM1 in particular is indicated as the target for AGAs in GBS, there are many other homologs between the campylobacter LOS and human gangliosides. 95 As stated by Shahrizaila and Yuki the association between GBS and C. jejuni is the is the first human autoimmune disorder that fulfills the criteria to conclude that GBS is caused by molecular mimicry. 96 The criteria include (1) the establishment of an epidemiological association between infectious agent and the immune-mediated disease. In general, epidemiological studies have shown 30-35% positivity for C. jejuni in GBS patients as compared to 4.4% in controls. 97 The second (2) criterium is to identify antibodies or T cells directed against the target antigen. As previously stated, AGAs were identified in patients with GBS and recognized as the key pathological element in the pathogenesis. Depending on the ganglioside targeted a different manifestation of GBS may occur. Interestingly, also activated T cells and macrophages have been identified around the nerves of GBS patients. 88 Apparently, patients develop T cell responses against the exogenous LOS and endogenous glycolipids (gangliosides). Further studies should address the nature of the responding T cells. Possible candidates include innate lymphoid cells, gamma-delta T cells or NK cells. As the third criterium (3) microbial mimics to the target antigens have been identified. They include the low molecular weight LOS of C. jejuni. It has been observed that only certain specific C. jejuni serotypes are associated with GBS, in particular O: 19 and O:41. 94,98 These serotypes correspond to the development of AGAs especially against GM1 but also to other gangliosides, like GD1a and GD3. As the final criterium (4) it has been shown that GBS can be induced in a rabbit model by an injection with either the GM1 ganglioside or the homologous LOS of C. jejuni. 99 The antibodies were found to disrupt lipid rafts, nodal structures and ion channel clusters in the peripheral motor nerves. 99 Interestingly, in the animal model the neuronal damage could be inhibited with the synthetic serine protease inhibitor nafamostat mesilate that also acts as a complement inhibitor. 100 Pathogens other than C. jejuni GBS and AGA development can be a post-infectious condition associated with many pathogens other than C. jejuni. These include M. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus. 9,101-103 M. pneumoniae has been linked to the development of GBS. These patients developed antibodies not only against gangliosides but also against anti-galactocerebrosides. [104] [105] [106] H. influenzae has GM1-like structures on its surface that can elicit a mimicry-type antibody response similar to the one seen in C. jejuni infections. [107] [108] [109] Analyses of the the antecedent infections in GBS and MFS have indicated that C. jejuni is the most common causative agent for infections preceding the occurrence of the neurological disease, being usually observed in approximately 21-32% of the cases. 101, 110 Physiology of gangliosides and the role of antiganglioside antibodies in. . .

No direct evidence is available for the pathogenetic mechanisms in humans but evidence from studies in mice indicate that CD8+T cells can mediated killing of orexinergic neurons to give a narcolepsy-like phenotype. 135 Surprisingly, narcolepsy has been associated with the pandemic H1N1 flu vaccine. In Finland and Sweden, between October 2009 and August 2010, and later in other countries, after the vaccination campaign against the H1N1-type influenza A with the Pandemrix vaccine (GSK), a clear increase in narcolepsy cases was reported. The cases were observed in particular in children and adolescents, ranging from 4 to 19 years of age. The vaccination increased the risk of developing narcolepsy 6.5-14.4fold in vaccinated subjects compared to unvaccinated ones. [136] [137] [138] An increase in narcolepsy was not restricted to the flu vaccine. Interestingly, in China, in the absence of vaccination, a 6-fold increase in the incidence of narcolepsy was observed after the 2009 influenza pandemics. 139 The mechanisms and potential autoantigen underlying the development of H1N1 vaccine-or virus infection-induced narcolepsy have remained elusive. The receptor for the H1N1virus hemagglutinin H1 is sialic acid, \u03b12-3 or \u03b12-6 linked to galactose, structures commonly present on gangliosides, like GD3. Furthermore, the other main protein on the virus particle surface is neuraminidase N1, capable of cleaving sialic acids. A molecular mimicry between orexin and the viral proteins leading to T cell cross-reactivity has been suggested. 140 Pandemrix is an AS03adjuvanted vaccine that contains \u03b1-tocopherol, which in vitro can increase the expression of orexin, upregulating the Nrf2 pathway. 141 In this way it can potentially favor cross-reactive antigen presentation by MHC class II. 142 Another influenza A (H1N1) vaccine, Arepanrix (also by GSK) with a similar composition, same adjuvant and antigenicity as Pandemrix, 143 did not show any increase in narcolepsy incidence. 144 This could have been due to a different protein antigen composition in the vaccine. 145 In our own study 137 we found AGAs, in particular anti-GM3 and anti-GM4, in the sera of 18.1% of patients with Pandemrix-induced narcolepsy (compared to 7.3% in unvaccinated controls). The origin of these antibodies could be an immune response against the vaccine adjuvant (squalene) preparation that is from shark liver, a source rich in the GM3 and GM4 gangliosides. The role of anti-ganglioside antibodies in the pathological process is not clear. While the disease most likely is a specific autoimmune response to distinct self antigen(s) expressed by the orexin producing neurons the anti-ganglioside antibodies could have an additional role.

On some occasions, however, the tolerance is broken, and the immune system succeeds in responding to the microbial mimics of sialic acids with consequent autoimmunity as a byproduct. Examples include neuronal autoimmune diseases like Guillain-Barr\u00e9 and Miller-Fisher syndromes. The role of AGAs in the pathogenesis of many different diseases is not fully understood. AGAs could (i) participate in the direct damage to the structure that they bind to, (ii) be a sequela of different types of infectious diseases, (iii) facilitate many immunemediated pathological mechanisms, including complement activation and the enhancement of its functional effects because of neutralization of a basic complement control mechanism of the cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONCLUSIONS"}, {"text": "Relative to proteins, immune responses to carbohydrates and glycolipids have often received less attention in studies of autoimmunity despite the fact that they could have a direct or an important adjunct role. Future studies should address the abilities of antibodies to neutralize the functions of gangliosides, including their roles as receptors or protective molecules against immune attack. Therapeutic inhibition of complement activation could be considered in cases, where the protective ability of gangliosides has become compromised, and complement causes serious injury. Because of varying expression during different life periods, gangliosides could explain relative sensitivities to diseases in different age groups, especially in the elderly people. Their roles as receptors for infectious agents and initiators of immunological cross-reactions still needs further exploration. Also, studies on the roles of gangliosides Fig. 2 A model for the pathogenesis of secondary narcolepsy following Pandemrix\u00ae vaccination. In susceptible recipients, i.e., in those, who harbor the HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele, antigen presenting cells (APCs, dendritic cells and macrophages) gather at the injection site after the vaccine shot. Following the uptake of and response to vaccine components (e.g., H1 and N1 proteins, squalene, \u03b1-tocopherol, possible nucleoprotein or ganglioside impurities) the APCs migrate to the lymph node presenting the antigens to the T-cells through the MHC class II, inducing their activation. Eventually, through a process of molecular mimicry this mechanism could lead to a targeted attack against hypothalamic orexinergic neurons and to the subsequent narcolepsy onset. Antiganglioside antibodies could emerge upon complex formation between H1N1 proteins and the gangliosides, which would be picked up by the ganglioside responding B cells. T cells specific for the H1N1 proteins would provide the necessary help for antibody formation by B cells, and subsequently by plasma cells. Antiganglioside antibodies have an ability to both activate complement and to neutralize the complement inhibitory gangliosides on neuronal cell surfaces Breast cancer GM3, GD3, 9-O-Ac GD3, 9-O-Ac GT3", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 934, "end": 940, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "CONCLUSIONS"}, {"text": "Groux- Degroote 154 Physiology of gangliosides and the role of antiganglioside antibodies in. . .
