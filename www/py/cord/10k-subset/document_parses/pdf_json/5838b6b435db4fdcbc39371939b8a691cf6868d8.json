            "text": "Generation and characterization of transgenic mice are important elements of biomedical research. In recent years, transgenic technology has become more versatile and sophisticated, mainly because of the incorporation of recombinase-mediated conditional expression and targeted insertion, site-speci fi c endonuclease-mediated genome editing, siRNA-mediated gene knockdown, various inducible gene expression systems, and fl uorescent protein marking and tracking techniques. Site-speci fi c recombinases (such as PhiC31) and engineered endonucleases (such as ZFN and Talen) have signi fi cantly enhanced our ability to target transgenes into speci fi c genomic loci, but currently a great majority of transgenic mouse lines are continuingly being created using the conventional random insertion method. A major challenge for using this conventional method is that the genomic environment at the integration site has a substantial in fl uence on the expression of the transgene. Although our understanding of such chromosomal position effects and our means to combat them are still primitive, adhering to some general guidelines can signi fi cantly increase the odds of successful transgene expression. This chapter fi rst discusses the major problems associated with transgene expression, and then describes some of the principles for using plasmid and bacterial arti fi cial chromosomes (BACs) for generating transgenic constructs. Finally, the strategies for conducting each of the major types of transgenic research are discussed, including gene overexpression, promoter characterization, cell-lineage tracing, mutant complementation, expression of double or multiple transgenes, siRNA knockdown, and conditional and inducible systems.",

Transgenic models also complement well with the increasing number of available knockout/knockin and other mutant mouse lines generated by both ethyl nitrosourea (ENU) and gene-trapping mutagenesis. These loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches synergistically increase our ability to understand complex physiological processes and mechanisms of disease.",

However, as of today, the great majority of transgenic projects are still carried out using the conventional random integration method. In spite of three decades of experimentation and optimization, our ability to predict and control the expression of randomly inserted transgenes is still far from satisfactory. Nevertheless, some important knowledge and general guidelines for controlling transgene expression have accumulated over the past three decades. Following these guidelines can signi fi cantly improve, although not guarantee, the odds of proper transgene expression. This chapter is mainly aimed at providing beginners with a broad perspective on the applications of the conventional transgenic technology. It is impossible to discuss each topic in much detail, and therefore many important innovations and contributions are not mentioned here.",

One important lesson learned from the past three decades is that the genomic environment surrounding the site of integration can exert a profound in fl uence on expression of the transgene. In the cell nucleus, chromatin interacts extensively with the nuclear matrix and other proteins to form looped and topologically constrained domains. Distinct boundary elements or insulators embedded in the genome separate it into regions where gene expression is often facilitated or repressed. Consequently, it is not surprising that the promoter activity of the inserted transgene is subject to the in fl uence of the local genomic environment as well as distant transcriptional enhancers or repressors.",

            "text": "These chromosomal position effects are typically represented in the following forms. First, it is quite common that some of the transgenic lines do not express the transgene at all or express it at a very low level. These silenced transgenic lines are often eliminated during the initial period of transgenic mouse characterization. Second, altered transgene expression refers to transgenic lines with spatial or temporal expression patterns that do not match those expected based on the promoters used to drive the transgenes. This is often a result of the in fl uence of a strong promoter/ enhancer/repressor near the integration site. Third, mosaic transgene expression is another often-encountered problem, i.e., the transgene is expressed only in a portion of cells of the same tissue. Fourth, progressive extinction also happens to some transgenes. In this case, the transgene gives correct and robust expression when the transgenic line is fi rst established, but its expression decreases or even completely stops after multiple generations of breeding. Chromosomal epigenetic modi fi cations such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation probably play important roles in diminishing the expression of these transgenes. Most researchers carefully characterize their transgenic lines when they are fi rst created, but then do not reexamine transgene expression thereafter. Many scientists who receive mice from another laboratory tend to trust the published initial characterization results. Therefore, failure to periodically check transgene expression can potentially lead to erroneous scienti fi c conclusions.",

Prokaryote-derived cloning vector sequences often strongly suppress transgene expression if they are not removed from the transgene. Genomic DNA usually expresses better than cDNA [ 10, 11 ] . When many copies of transgenes are inserted as tandem repeats at the same location, they are more likely to be silenced [ 12, 13 ] . While introns may facilitate the export of mRNA out of the nucleus, which at least partially explains why genomic DNA is better than cDNA for achieving gene expression, the other observed phenomena still remain to be explained, although chromosomal epigenetic modi fi cations are believed to be the main suspect.",

After all, shouldn't cultured cells and cells in live animals have similar, if not exactly the same, genomic organization and transcriptional machinery? To help clear the confusion, it should be pointed out that the majority of in vitro transfection experiments involve transient transfection. The DNA vectors do not even integrate into the genome, and therefore they are not subjected to complicated genomic environmental in fl uences. In fact, for generation of stable cell lines, the same problems of chromosomal position effects and epigenetic modi fi cations do exist, as reviewed by Kwaks and Otte [ 14 ] . However, because hundreds of thousands or millions of cells are normally used in each cell transfection experiment, it is usually not very dif fi cult to fi nd some cells with the expected gene expression. In the case of transgenic animals, creating and maintaining each transgenic line is labor-intensive and costly. Most scientists do not have the luxury of selecting several perfect lines from many available transgenic lines. Furthermore, each transgenic animal contains hundreds of different cell types, whereas each cell transfection experiment normally uses only one type of cell. Therefore, unexpected patterns of tissue-speci fi c gene expression are far more likely to show up in transgenic mice than in a particular cell line. Lastly, useful transgenic models need to be maintained for a very long time, for multiple generations. Moreover, authentic transgene expression must also be properly maintained through the changes in gene activities and overall genomic modi fi cations associated with the different stages of embryonic and postnatal development. In contrast, the changes in gene expression and epigenetic modi fi cation in stably transfected cell lines are rather limited.",

When more than 50 kb of genomic region fl anks both the 5 \u00a2 and 3 \u00a2 ends of the gene, the probability of faithful and reproducible transgene expression is as high as 85 % [ 23 ] . However, one potential problem with using large BACs is that larger clones are more likely to include neighboring genes. Whether these extra full-length or partial genes pose any complications to the study will depend on the purpose of the project.",

Shearing is a potential problem during preparation, storage, and microinjection of BAC as well as other large DNA molecules. BAC DNA should be stored in TE buffer or microinjection buffer supplied with salt and polyamines to make the long DNA strands more compact and hence less prone to shearing.

It is noteworthy that some of the most commonly used promoters for transfecting cultured cells are not the best choice for directing ubiquitous gene expression in transgenic animals. Such promoters are small in size and very convenient, but they are subject to heavy position effects. For example, CMV is considered a ubiquitous promoter for transfecting a wide variety of cultured mammalian cells. However, in transgenic mice its effects are not as ubiquitous [ 31 ] . For ubiquitous transgene expression, good results have been achieved using the ROSA26 and the CAGGS (chicken b-actin promoter with CMV early enhancer) promoters. For tissue-speci fi c expression, proven promoters for most major tissues or cell types can be found in the literature. For instance, the Tie2 promoter has been shown to be able to direct transgene expression speci fi cally in the vascular endothelium [ 32 ] . Tissue-speci fi c promoters for liver, intestine, and macrophage, which are of particular interest to lipoprotein researchers, are discussed in Chapter 12 of this volume.

A good starting point is to place several kilobases of promoter region in front of a suitable reporter gene. Depending on whether the reporter gene expression is able to match the pattern of endogenous gene expression, the length of the promoter can be subsequently increased or decreased to identify important genomic regulatory elements. For most genes a few kilobases or even several hundred base pairs of DNA upstream of the transcription initiation sites are enough to confer tissue-speci fi c gene expression.

One of the main problems of the siRNA approach is that it can only reduce, but never completely abolish, endogenous gene expression. However, in the cases when complete knockout results in lethality, the knockdown approach can actually be advantageous. As will be discussed in Subheadings 4.6 and 4.7 , the conditional and inducible systems developed for RNA polymerase II promoters also appear to work for the U6 and H1 promoters, which signi fi cantly enhance the fl exibility and usefulness of the siRNA knockdown approach [ 47 ] .",

Some users of transgenic core facilities request that their transgenic lines be made directly on the mutant background, but it is usually easier and faster to create the transgenic lines in standard wild-type mice and then cross them into the mutant background.

The disadvantage is that extensive breeding and genotyping are required; furthermore, the obtained genotypes are not stable and hence the transgenes may segregate in subsequent generations. Several alternative methods exist for incorporating multiple transgenes into the same transgenic line. First, two or more separate transgenes can be mixed and comicroinjected. Because multiple copies of transgenes are often cointegrated at the same genomic location, there is a good chance that both transgenes are integrated in the same locus in the same transgenic line. Such transgenic lines can be stably maintained without tedious crossbreeding and genotyping. When mixing DNA constructs for microinjection, the DNA concentration for each construct should be proportionally reduced so that the total DNA concentration remains in the normal 1-2 m g/ml range. Otherwise the elevated DNA concentration may reduce the survivability of the injected embryos. Second, two transgenes, each containing its own promoter and polyadenylation sequence, can be cloned into the same transgenic vector. Third, an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) can be used to create bi-or polycistronic mRNA, which enables the production of two or more proteins from the same mRNA.

These systems require the interbreeding of two transgenic mouse lines, one carrying the gene of interest under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (fusion of CMV minimal promoter and seven copies of the TetO sequence termed the tetracycline response element or TRE), and the other carrying the transcriptional activator (tTA for the Tet-off system or rtTA for the Tet-on system). In the absence of tTA or rtTA, the CMV minimal promoter is not enough to drive expression of the transgene. However, when tTA or rtTA binds to the TetO sequences of the tetracycline-inducible promoter, RNA polymerase can be recruited to the CMV minimum promoter to begin transcription. Both tTA and rtTA are created by fusion of a TetR protein and the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein, but they behave oppositely in terms of their requirements for tetracycline to activate the tetracycline-inducible promoter. tTA requires the absence of tetracycline for binding to TRE, whereas rtTA requires the presence of tetracycline to be able to bind to the promoter. Therefore, when a tetracycline analog such as doxycycline is administered through food, water, or IP injection, rtTA can turn on the transgene whereas tTA can turn it off.",

There are dozens of ubiquitous or tissue-speci fi c tTA and rtTA transgenic lines available at The Jackson Laboratory. One advantage of the rtTA over the tTA system is that induction of gene expression can be achieved quickly. This is because the added doxycycline can enter the tissues in a matter of minutes or hours, whereas clearing it out of the system usually takes days. It is worth mentioning that for brain tissues, it takes a longer period of time for the added doxycycline to take effect because of the blood-brain barrier. However, the disadvantage of the rtTA system is that basal level (leaky) expression appears to be higher [ 75, 76 ] .",

Because the tetracyclineinducible system itself requires two mouse lines, when they are further crossed to the conditional knockout/knockin mouse line, breeding and genotyping become very complicated. Therefore, the tamoxifen-inducible system is often adopted for achieving inducible recombinase transgene expression. In this case, the Cre protein is fused to a modi fi ed estrogen receptor (ER) protein.",

In the absence of tamoxifen, the Cre-ER fusion proteins stay in the cytoplasm. Upon tamoxifen administration, tamoxifen binds to ER to cause a conformational change in the receptor and result in transport of the Cre-ER fusion protein into the nucleus. Because Cre needs to be located in the cell nucleus to perform its function of mediating homologous recombination between two loxP sites, its activity can be effectively turned on and off by tamoxifen. Several versions of Cre-ER fusion proteins are currently available, and CreERT2 appears to be the most sensitive variant to date. Hunter et al. [ 81 ] created the FLPeERT2 fusion gene, which can be used for inducibly removing sequences fl anked by FRTs. Besides ER, the progesterone receptor (PR) can also be fused to Cre recombinase to create a Cre-PR fusion protein, which can be induced by the synthetic steroid RU486 [ 82 ] .",
