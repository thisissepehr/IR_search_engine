The Hep B Free campaign was launched to eliminate HBV in San Francisco by increasing awareness, testing, vaccination and linkage to care. The campaign conducted 306 street intercept and telephone interviews of San Francisco Asians to assess current levels of HBV knowledge, testing behaviors and effectiveness of existing campaign media materials. One-third of respondents ranked HBV as a key health issue in the Asian community, second to diabetes. General HBV awareness is high (85%); however, a majority could not name an effective prevention method. Sixty percent reported having been tested for HBV; provider recommendation was the most often cited reason for testing. Respondents reported a high level of trust in their providers to correctly assess which health issues they may be at risk for developing and test accordingly, confirming that efforts to increase HBV testing among Asians must simultaneously mobilize the public to request testing and compel providers to test high-risk patients. Regarding community awareness, more than half reported hearing more about HBV recently; younger respondents were more likely to have encountered campaign materials and recall correct HBV facts. Assessment of specific campaign materials found that while upbeat images and taglines captured attention and destigmatized HBV, messages that emphasize the pervasiveness and deadly consequence of infection were more likely to drive respondents to seek education and testing.

Together with our findings, these facts suggest that efforts to increase hepatitis B screening among Asians must both mobilize the public to request testing, as well as educate providers and institute processes that would remind them to test high-risk patients. In this next phase of the campaign, SFHBF is capitalizing on our target population's high level of trust in the medical providers by focusing on outreach to the clinician community (Table 6 ). In addition to continuation of educational events and distributing a screening algorithm developed earlier in the campaign, SFHBF is promoting a clinician's honor roll to encourage clinicians to pledge to test patients at risk for hepatitis B infections, and has created a ''Patient Ask Sheet'' that may be distributed at public venues to help individuals proactively ask their providers for hepatitis B testing and/or vaccination (Fig. 3) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 267, "end": 271, "text": "[32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 272, "end": 275, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 613, "end": 617, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1063, "end": 1071, "text": "(Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF8"}, {"start": 1506, "end": 1514, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "While our survey provided useful information for refining campaign strategies, it does have the following Fig. 3 Patient ''Ask Sheet''. Available at: http://www.sfhepbfree.org/patientform/ limitations. Because the campaign did not have the resources to conduct a representative-sample survey of the San Francisco Asian population, our results can only be considered an evaluation of our specific outreach program and cannot be extrapolated to all Asians living in San Francisco. Also, even though a wide array of monolingual Asians reside in San Francisco, we only had the resources to survey one monolingual group (Cantonese speakers, the largest proportion of monolingual Asians in San Francisco [6]). By recruiting for our street intercept interviews at locations frequented by Chinese residents and interviewing non-Cantonese-speaking Asians in English only, we overrepresented monolingual Cantonese speakers and may have excluded valuable feedback from non-Chinese Asians that also have high prevalence of HBV infection, such as Vietnamese, Cambodian and Korean residents. Also, while we did find a higher percentage of respondents who were familiar with hepatitis B (90%) compared to studies in similar populations in other parts of North America, (ranging from 56% to 86% [15, 26, 27, 30, [35] [36] [37] [38] ), and that almost half of our respondents reported seeing an increase in hepatitis B awareness within their community in the past year, we are unable to directly attribute these apparent increases to SFHBF due to the lack of baseline data from the period before 2007, with the most recent local data having been produced in 2000 [10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1279, "end": 1283, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1284, "end": 1287, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1288, "end": 1291, "text": "27,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1292, "end": 1295, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1296, "end": 1300, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1301, "end": 1305, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1306, "end": 1310, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1311, "end": 1315, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1646, "end": 1650, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 106, "end": 112, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our evaluation project does have some strengths.

Our use of many open-ended questions and lack of initial prompting about hepatitis B as the survey's subject matter should have elicited objective feedback about how a sample of Asians in San Francisco prioritize hepatitis B in relation to other health issues in their community. We were able to use results from this project to determine where to focus upcoming campaign activities, resulting in a new and nationally-recognized media campaign with messaging that emphasizes the serious consequences of infection and a more focused strategy for clinician outreach. It is our hope that, by simultaneously driving both the Asian community to seek testing from their medical providers and the clinician community to be more vigilant in initiating testing and vaccination, SFHBF and our partner organizations can build a comprehensive and sustainable strategy to significantly decrease the burden of disease caused by hepatitis B in San Francisco.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Prevalence of HBV and risk of HBV acquisition in hepatitis B screening programs in large metropolitan cities in the US", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Guane", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": [], "last": "Sui", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Lam", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Kim", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "V", "middle": [], "last": "Warren", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Liu", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2004, "venue": "Hepatology 716A", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Epidemiology of hepatitis B in the United States", "authors": [{"first": "W", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Kim", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2009, "venue": "Hepatology", "volume": "49", "issn": "", "pages": "28--34", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Screening in chronic hepatitis B among Asian/ Pacific Islander populations", "authors": [{"first": "", "middle": [], "last": "Cdc", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2005, "venue": "MMWR Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report", "volume": "55", "issn": "18", "pages": "505--509", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection in the United States: The national health and nutrition examination surveys", "authors": [{"first": "G", "middle": [], "last": "Mcquillan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": [], "last": "Coleman", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Kruszon-Moran", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1976, "venue": "American Journal of Public Health", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "14--18", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "High prevalence of chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection in adult Chinese Americans living in California.

Anecdotally, partners have reported positive responses to this new material: one screening partner saw a doubling of clients within months of the new media campaign; this and other screening clinics report that clients are citing the ad as a reason for coming to the clinic; another community partner also reported that the ads have provoked many conversations about hepatitis B within the Asian community.
