NiV usually affects impoverished rural communities in Bangladesh, thus, affected families often experience a severe social and financial crisis [24, 25] . NiV kills people and leaves survivors with permanent neurological sequelae, similar to those experienced by some survivors of Japanese encephalitis [26, 27] . Sixty-one percent of NiV cases affected males with a mean age of 27 [3] who could be the main wage earners of the family. Most died [3] , and those that survived could not continue to work due to the neurological effects of NiV. In addition, NiV is a disease that requires special care. Hospitalization and illness episodes can last a week [28] . The financial burden associated with hospitalization translates into reduced monthly food and children education expenditures, having to borrow money, taking loans with high interests, and selling assets [29] [30] [31] . Prevention could reduce the risk of disease transmission as well as save poor families from social degradation. Despite the severity of Nipah illness, since an average of fewer than 20 NiV cases are identified annually in Bangladesh [3] , the cost of NiV prevention is unlikely to meet the traditional criteria for cost-effective interventions to prevent cases [32] . However, in addition to causing sickness and death, outbreaks have social consequences including fear, social unrest, violence and economic loss [33] [34] [35] [36] . For diseases with moderate to high perceived severity, such as pandemic influenza, SARS or Ebola, investing and intervening earlier in the outbreak can be cost effective [37] . NiV is a deadly disease that can transmit from person to person and represents a global pandemic threat [38, 39] . Estimating NiV prevention costs is of interest to local and global health communities, helping to make informed decisions on funding interventions to prevent this disease. If we prevent a large high-mortality NiV pandemic, an effective intervention would be remarkably cost-efficient. Disaster preparedness reduces the impact of disasters and associated costs, compared to a scenario without preparedness [40] . Initiatives to mitigate low probability, high catastrophic risks are not uncommon. NASA spends millions of dollars each year to track asteroids, though chances of dying from an asteroid impact are very low for the average person in the United States [41] . Investing in active surveillance activities for zoonotic infections, implementing effective ecological health interventions, improving modeling capabilities, increasing evaluations of health systems and public health needs and policies, and implementing better risk communication can improve the preparedness to respond to emerging infectious diseases [42] . For example, Taiwan established a nationwide emergency department, based on a syndromic surveillance system, that collaborated with 189 hospitals for better public heath response to improve their pandemic flu preparedness and disease control capabilities [43] . Similarly, investing in preventing NiV could provide an important benefit.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 380, "end": 384, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 385, "end": 388, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 539, "end": 543, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 544, "end": 547, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 618, "end": 621, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 682, "end": 685, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 890, "end": 894, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1101, "end": 1105, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1110, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1111, "end": 1115, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1351, "end": 1354, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1479, "end": 1483, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1631, "end": 1635, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1636, "end": 1640, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1641, "end": 1645, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1646, "end": 1650, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1823, "end": 1827, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1934, "end": 1938, "text": "[38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1939, "end": 1942, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2350, "end": 2354, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2607, "end": 2611, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2966, "end": 2970, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 3228, "end": 3232, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Health intervention studies from Bangladesh, focusing on cost, find some similarities with our study [44] [45] [46] .

They could conduct meetings in the areas immediately surrounding their offices, affix posters, provide leaflets, and disseminate messages to people receiving their services during the sap harvesting season, adding a minimal cost.
