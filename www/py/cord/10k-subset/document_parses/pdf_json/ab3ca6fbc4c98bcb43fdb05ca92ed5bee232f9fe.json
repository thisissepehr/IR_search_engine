Despite high mutation rates, the genetic diversity of HA is constrained. This limited diversity is evident in HA phylogeny, which shows high extinction rates that result partly from cross-immunity between similar strains. That is, many HA mutants go extinct because they fail to spread efficiently from host to host because of immunity in previously infected individuals. Several hypotheses have been suggested to explain how competition between closely related strains interacts with other factors to limit the observed diversity of HA and NA. One hypothesis suggests that short-term, straintranscending immunity may limit the growth and mutation of influenza strains (Ferguson et al., 2003) . Another hypothesis is that punctuated antigenic changes in HA may precipitate selective sweeps, allowing sufficiently novel mutants to outcompete related strains of the same subtype (Koelle et al., 2006) . This process has been termed 'epochal evolution', as the discovery of new antigenic phenotypes depends on periods of extensive genotypic change with generally minor but occasionally dramatic effects on phenotype.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 967, "end": 990, "text": "(Ferguson et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1175, "end": 1196, "text": "(Koelle et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "How are the patterns of seasonal influenza in humans useful to predict species jumps? Understanding the dynamics of influenza in human hosts sheds light on the potential of the human population to be infected by new strains, the probability that a spillover virus can acquire evolutionary adaptations to facilitate spread in humans and the abilities of intermediate hosts (such as chickens and pigs) to generate pandemic viruses. Seasonal influenza creates cycles of higher and lower immunity in humans: epidemics deplete susceptibles, leaving a higher fraction of the population with protective immunity. Some of this immunity has been shown to be cross-protective against viruses of other subtypes (e.g. infection with seasonal influenza can confer partial protection to infection with H5N1). In addition, the diversity of viruses circulating in humans should in theory correlate with the potential for an emerging virus to exchange gene segments with an adapted resident virus, which could increase the emerging virus's rate of transmission. Reassortment events are commonly associated with seasonal influenza and appear to be an integral evolutionary step in pandemics. The generation of pandemic viruses through reassortment depends sensitively on dynamics in the intermediate host population, including the amount of herd immunity in non-human hosts and the dynamics of viral diversity in that host population. Compared to humans, pig populations can contain a much greater diversity of H3N2 viruses, including antigenic variants of H3 HA that have long been extinct in the human population (de Jong et al., 2007) , but the rate of viral antigenic evolution in pigs is slower. As with humans, an important question is how host immunity, local climate, viral mutation and birth/death processes affect the observed patterns of influenza diversity. Understanding these basic processes should allow the long-term effects of interventions (e.g. culls, quarantines, antivirals and vaccinations) on viral evolution to be predicted and shed light on which steps (such as key mutations or contact rates between hosts) (Cobey et al., 2010) limit emergence.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1597, "end": 1619, "text": "(de Jong et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2115, "end": 2135, "text": "(Cobey et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Data collected from the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic may provide new insights into its tropism and virulence mechanisms.

While those viruses are not infectious to humans, these viruses are known to have made a species jump from cats to dogs and also to raccoons. Their small, single-stranded DNA genomes (comprised of two genes that encode four proteins) and widespread occurrence among domestic and wild carnivores make the parvoviruses particularly useful as models for understanding how species jumps occur. In the late 1970s, canine parvovirus (strain 2, CPV-2) emerged as a new pathogen infecting dogs and spread globally within the year (Hoelzer and Parrish, 2010) . That virus was clearly shown to be a descendant of a cat virus (feline panleukopenia virus, FPV) that jumped from cats to dogs within 5 years prior to its emergence. Since that time, CPV-2 has continued to evolve, and in one of those steps, it re-acquired the ability to infect cats while continuing to evolve within its canine host. Phylogenetic analyses reveal changes in amino acid residues on the surface of the viral capsid proteins. Although those are singlestranded DNA viruses, they show high levels of variation, similar to those seen for RNA viruses. Parrish et al. have shown that many of the genetic differences between CPV and FPV associated with host range variation occur in these capsid protein genes, resulting in a tropism shift that enabled the species jump from cats to dogs. They further characterized the viruses structurally and showed that they differ in their antigenicity and exhibit species-specific differences in attachment to the host cell receptor (transferrin receptor type 1) (Harbison et al., 2009) .

Spillover events are defined here as incidental human outbreaks without sustained human-human transmission; species jumps are driven by genetic changes that enable sustained human-human transmission. Viruses that have spilled over into human populations may subsequently evolve (i.e. jump) to efficiently transmit among human hosts. Marburg viral RNA and antiviral serum antibodies were detected in Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) in Uganda(Towner et al., 2009).While these outbreaks occurred in Germany, both were caused by exposure to the same lot of green monkeys (Chlorocebus sp, formerly genus Cercopithecus) imported from Uganda. \u00a7 While infected animals have been detected in markets, they have not yet been detected in the wild.-Two more recent studies have narrowed this estimate to1915 -1941(Korber et al., 2000 and1884 -1923(Worobey et al., 2008 using phyloge-animal species (mice, ferrets, macaques) were affected differently depending upon the strain with which they were infected(Memoli et al., 2009). These pathotype variations suggest that for a given A/H1N1pan strain, different species are more or less susceptible to infection and/or develop different immune responses that diminish or worsen outcomes of infection, leading to species-specific differences in morbidity and mortality. Despite fears, A/H1N1pan has exhibited a global mortality rate of far <1%, compared with an estimated 2.5% for 1918 pandemic influenza A virus(Taubenberger and Morens, 2006; Bautista et al., 2010).Smith et al. (2009), utilizing a Bayesian molecular clock analysis of swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) outbreak strains, estimated that the A/H1N1pan common ancestor emerged between August 2008 and January 2009. Additional retrospective analyses may help reveal how sentinel cases during this time frame went unnoticed. The possibility that A/H1N1pan emerged up to 8 months before detection illuminates the uncertainties, opportunities and risks accompanying the current zoonotic viral surveillance vacuum.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Table 1.
