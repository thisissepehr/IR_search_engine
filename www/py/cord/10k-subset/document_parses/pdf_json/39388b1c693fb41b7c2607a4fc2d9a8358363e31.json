Furthermore, profiling of serological responses can be used to identify biomarkers indicative of exposure to pathogens. Conducting such immune surveillance requires readout methods that are highthroughput, robust, and require small sample volumes. While the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the classical readout method for assessing serological responses, the advent of multiplex assays has significantly increased the throughput and capacity for immunoprofiling. This report describes the development and assay performance (sensitivity, linearity of detection, requirement for multiple dilutions for each sample, intra-and inter-assay variability) of an electro-chemiluminescence (ECLIA)-based multiplex assay.",

Testing sera from preclinical and clinical studies has also been used to determine the potency of vaccine formulations as well as their potential to induce cross-species or cross-serotype reactive antibodies. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have been the standard readout method to answer these aforementioned questions. The advent of multiplex testing platforms, such as the electro-chemiluminescence immunoassays (ECLIA), and bead-based flow cytometric assays enables the simultaneous detection for different antibody specificities and significantly increases the throughput of testing. The nature of multiplex platforms is ideal for sample sparing, enabling more in-depth analyses compared to single-plex assays such as the ELISA. Depending on the serological assay platform, antigens are either simply coated onto assay plates as in the case of the ELISA or they require modifications such as biotinylation or chemical linkage to fluorescent beads. In the case of the ECLIA, antigens require biotinylation to complex with proprietary linkers that allow targeted binding to specific regions in the assay well. The ECLIA technology tested here allows up to ten antigens to be coated in a single assay well.",

Antibody binding to the plate antigens is detected by adding a secondary antibody specific for the immunoglobulin heavy chain of the antibodies in the test sample. For use in the ECLIA, the polyclonal secondary antibody is coupled with a proprietary Sulfo-Tag as the reporter molecule. Lastly, the substrate for the Sulfo-Tag is added. Upon inserting the specialized ECLIA plates into the reader, an electric pulse initiates the substrate conversion, resulting in chemiluminescence. A high-resolution camera quantifies the ECLIA signal in the various sectors of the well and reports the luminescence signal in each well sector. One of the significant advantages of ECLIA is that the substrate is activated by the reader thus eliminating any variability as result of timing associated with the addition of the substrate to the wells and the plates, which can be an issue in the ELISA.",

The plate antigens were either the full-length CSP [4] , or peptides representing the central CSP-repeat region or C-terminal end of the CSP. Plate antigens with significant epitope-overlap were chosen deliberately to address potential antigenic competition when simultaneously testing sera for reactivity with different epitopes. The performance of the new ECLIA-based readout was compared to that of a qualified, malaria-specific ELISA performed in an international serology reference center, since the ELISA is a commonly employed serological readout in malaria (due to the relatively basic requirement for hardware), and historical comparison to earlier results within our program spanning close to 20 years [5, 6] . The ELISA requires testing of several replicates of a serially-diluted sample to either determine the OD1 titre or endpoint titre. In the case of a quantitative ELISA, several sample dilutions need to be tested to ensure that the OD of the sample falls within the linear range of the standard curve.",

To characterize the ECLIA platform and compare it to the classical ELISA, pre-existing CSPimmune nonhuman primate (NHP) samples (n = 30) [9] and a de-identified human CSP-immune serum pool were used. Commercial human pooled serum (Gemini Biosciences, Sacramento, CA) was used as negative (malaria-na\u00efve) control serum. Two mouse monoclonal antibodies, one specific for the C-terminus of the CSP (clone 1E9, PATH/MVI), and one specific for the CSPrepeat region of the CSP (clone 1A6, PATH/MVI), were used as assay controls.

The linear range of the ECLIA assay was assessed in two ways. First, the correlation of the ECLIA luminescence intensity was measured at single-point dilutions with the antibody titres calculated using all the dilutions, across all samples. Second, to assess linearity directly, the change in signal intensity (Intensity, I) was calculated as a result of a change in antibody concentration (Concentration, C), or \u0394Intensity/\u0394Concentration, across the range of antibody concentrations and dilutions measured. Then the \u0394I/\u0394C curve was estimated by first plotting the \u0394Intensity and \u0394Concentration from consecutive data points in the correlation plot and then by applying a loess smoothing function using the loess function in R statistical package. The dilution and concentration span at which \u0394I/\u0394C \u2248 1 is indicative of the linear range, while a \u0394I/\u0394C \u2248 0 indicates that the ECLIA instrument is either below its sensitivity limit (at low concentrations) or saturated (at high concentrations), and the readout is unresponsive to differences in antibody concentrations.",

Malaria na\u00efve pooled human serum (specificity control) and the CSP-immune serum pool were tested at a 1:3,000 dilution.

Competing equal concentrations of plate-bound vs. soluble Pf16 peptide results in a roughly 70% competition. This could be due to different orientations and valencies when providing the peptide in a monomeric form vs. a format that may resemble multimers (due to the closer spatial arrangement of the peptide on the ECLIA well spot).

The optimal coating concentrations (66 nM for CSP-FL, 300 nM for the fragments/protein subunits) were applied to coating either wells with one antigen only (singleplex) or a cocktail consisting of all peptides (multiplex). CSP-immune serum and malaria-na\u00efve human pooled serum (negative control) were used at 1:5000 dilution to determine whether multiplexing resulted in lower luminescence signal, which would indicate antigenic competition (Fig. 4a) .

In contrast, the titration of the CSP-repeat-specific mAb 1A6 did not reach saturation despite a wide range of concentrations. Both mAbs responded stronger with their respective fragment than with the CSP-FL.

The biological samples tested here were from thirty CSP-immune nonhuman primates. Towards that end, the single dilution read-out was compared across four dilutions (1:4,000, 1:8000, 1:16,000, 1:32,000) with the titre calculated from the serial dilutions as the 'gold standard' (Fig. 8a) . For the four single-point dilutions analysed, R 2 values as high as 0.995 for the highest dilution were observed, over a serum antibody concentration range of approximately tenfold. The 1:4000 and 1:8000 dilutions did show evidence of saturation for samples with higher antibody concentrations. At the 1:16,000 and 1:32,000 dilutions, the relationship between signal intensity and concentration was highly linear, with \u0394I/\u0394C of close to 1.0 across most of the serum antibody concentration range (Fig. 8b) . By contrast, 1:4000 and 1:8000 showed \u0394I/\u0394C approaching 0.0 for samples with higher antibody concentrations, indicating some degree of instrument saturation. These findings suggest that testing the thirty CSP-immune NHP serum samples at a single dilution (1:32,000) was sufficient to accurately determine the antibody titres by ECLIA.",

Comparing some of the features with the classic ELISA demonstrated the advantages of Fig. 7 Linearity of ELISA vs ECLIA based assay for the assessment of CSP-specific antibodies. a ELISA readout for single sample (human CSP-immune pool) across fifteen twofold dilutions from 1:50 to 1:819,200, compared against the relative serum concentration, expressed as the log Dilution \u22121 for the CSP-FL, CSP C-term, and NANP antigens.

Special emphasis was placed on determining whether closely related antigens could be tested simultaneously without impacting the quantification of such antibodies. To this end, a single malarial antigen, CSP, and its fragments were used as plate antigens. CSP is one of the leading malaria vaccine antigens [12] ; the magnitude of antibody responses to either full length CSP [13] or its fragments has been identified as a potential biomarker of protection [14, 15] . While the role of CSP-repeat-specific antibodies has been well documented [8, 13, 15, 16] , there are conflicting data on the role of C-terminus-specific antibodies [7, 14, 17] and their ability to contribute to protection against infection. The method described here enables high-throughput testing and permits profiling of large samples sets even when sample volumes are limited to determine the role of epitope specificity of CSP-specific antibodies. The assay development report evaluates crucial parameters for a sensitive and reproducible assay: (1) the optimal coating concentrations for the CSP protein, as well as the derived peptides that represent important functional elements in efficacious immune responses induced by vaccination; (2) the equivalency of the U-plex linkers to ensure that no bias is introduced by assigning test antigens to linkers that are not capable of delivering the same signal strength; (3) the impact of biotinylation on immunoreactivity with specific antibodies. In this study, biotinylation did not notably change the interaction between antibodies and the antigens. However, it should not be assumed that this will be the case for all antigens. One cannot exclude the possibility that biotinylation may impact access to select epitopes by a subset of antibodies due to steric hindrance. The assay described here is intended for the characterization of polyclonal responses where steric hindrance would only have a negligible impact on the overall signal considering the wide range of epitope specificities and the high sensitivity of the assay platform. Other multiplex platforms such as bead-based flow cytometry also requires modification of the antigens by either biotinylation or chemical linkage. The latter assay platform has been used in some field studies for the profiling of antibody specificities and their contribution to clinical outcomes [18, 19] . Alternatively, protein arrays are available that allow an in-depth profiling of the antibody responses in vaccinees or residents of malaria endemic areas with special emphasis on polymorphic antigens where several alleles have been included into the array chips [20] . The ECLIA method described here could be considered complementary to protein microarrays.",

However, because of the extremely wide linear range of the ECLIA, a simple single-point measurement is sufficient to determine antibody titres. By contrast, in the ELISA, a much narrower linear range means that multiple dilution points are necessary for each sample to be in the linear range of the instrument, and then serial dilutions are required to create a titration curve from which a titre can be calculated. Furthermore, the ECLIA can be multiplexed to measure responses to multiple antigens simultaneously from a single sample. Equally important, no antigenic competition could be detected when testing closely related antigens in the ECLIA. These characteristics make the ECLIA the preferred platform for serological immunoprofiling, which is crucial for the identification of biomarkers of exposure or correlates of immunity.",

Once coupling is complete, U-PLEX-coupled antigens are combined into a cocktail and the assay plates coated. Each U-PLEX linker can only bind to its respective spot (color coded in Figure) ; up to 10 antigens can be coated per well (top view plate well). (Panel B) Overview of all steps to complete the assay: antigen-coated wells are incubated with diluted serum or plasma. Antigen-specific antibodies will bind to the antigen and the binding visualized by adding a Sulfo-Tag-labeled secondary antibody and substrate. (Panel C) Data acquisition. Plate is inserted into reader which will deliver an electric pulse that activates the substrate. A high resolution camera measures the luminescence above each spot. ",
