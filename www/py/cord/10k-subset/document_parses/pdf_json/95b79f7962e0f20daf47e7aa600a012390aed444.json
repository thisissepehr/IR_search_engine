The cardiorespiratory management of brain-dead donors is very similar to the management of critically ill patients, and the same applies to the management of anaemia and coagulation. Central diabetes insipidus is of particular concern, and should be diagnosed based on clinical criteria. Depending on the degree of vasopressor dependency, it can be treated with intermittent desmopressin or continuous vasopressin, intravenously. Temperature management of the donor is an area of uncertainty, but it appears reasonable to strive for a core temperature of > 35 \u00b0C. The indications and controversies regarding endocrine therapies, in particular thyroid hormone replacement therapy, and corticosteroid therapy, are discussed. The potential donor should be assessed clinically for infections, and screening tests for specific infections are an essential part of donor management. Although the rate of infection transmission from donor to receptor is low, certain infections are still a formal contraindication to organ donation. However, new antiviral drugs and strategies now allow organ donation from certain infected donors to be done safely.",

Efforts to increase organ donation rates in the population, such as opting-out laws or campaigns to promote donation consent, are part of the solution to this challenge. Other important elements involve the early identification of potential donors, and include organ donation as an option in the end-of-life care of every intensive care unit (ICU) patient [1] . On the other hand, organs from deceased potential donors are often refused because of suboptimal quality [2] . Adequate donor management to maximize the number of organs that can be offered for donation is essential to expand the donation pool.

A primary devastating injury to the brain and/or brain stem results in a massive immediate activation of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to an increase in arterial blood pressure and cardiac afterload, followed by left atrial pressure elevation, increased pressure in the pulmonary capillary bed, pulmonary vasoconstriction, and endothelial damage [3] (Fig. 1 ). This sympathetic storm may lead to cardiac muscle damage [5] , and contribute to respiratory problems, described below. In a small retrospective cohort study, Esmolol was used to mitigate this response [6] , but needs stronger evidence before it can be broadly recommended. Thereafter, vasoplegia becomes the most dominant hemodynamic feature, requiring fluids and/or vasopressors. Brain stem death includes the vagal nuclei, and, therefore, only the sympathetic nervous system influences the heart rate. An intravenous injection of atropine will fail to increase the heart rate after brain stem herniation [7] . Endocrine changes might contribute to fluid depletion or vasoplegia. The specific fluid and endocrine management of the brain-dead donor will be described in the sections below.",

There are no major studies dictating which types of monitoring should be applied in brain-dead donors [8] , but it is common sense that hemodynamic shock states should be evaluated using invasive arterial blood pressure measurements, lactate levels, (mixed) venous oxygen saturations, and echocardiography to evaluate myocardial contractility and exclude other cardiac pathology. Serial echocardiography can be used to assess potential recovery in neurogenic stunned myocardium, and guide continued support in potential donors [9] , which may increase the number and quality of donor hearts. In some cases, specific invasive monitoring with pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) [8] or arterial waveform analysis-based techniques [10] can be useful to steer management. It is difficult to set universal hemodynamic treatment goals for all donors, and the recommended mean blood pressure targets of 60-70 mmHg [2, 8] are not based on evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In the Monitoring Organ Donors to Improve Transplantation Results (MOnIToR) RCT, stopped prematurely due to lack of resources, management based on blood pressure, pulse pressure variation, and cardiac index targets was not superior to conventional therapy in increasing the number of organs transplanted per donor [11] .",

In a small prospective trial where brain-dead cardiac donors were weaned of norepinephrine and switched to dopamine and/or vasopressin, norepinephrine exposure was associated with reduced end-systolic elastance, which was in turn associated with worse cardiac graft function and worse survival at 1 year in heart transplant recipients [12] . An RCT of low-dose dopamine (4 \u00b5g/kg/min) in 264 brain-dead kidney donors resulted in a significantly reduced need for dialysis in the recipient of the dopamine-treated grafts [13] . Patients on norepinephrine > 0.4 \u00b5g/kg/ min or other adrenergic agents were excluded from this study, and 78.4% and 85.8% of donors received concomitant norepinephrine in the dopamine and control groups respectively. A recent retrospective study of 135 kidney donors found a similar rate of catecholamine use of 85.8% (dopamine 60%, noradrenaline 49%, dobutamine 11%, adrenaline 3%) [14] , while only noradrenaline, and not dopamine, was associated with a decreased incidence of graft loss. Apparently, several combinations of vasopressors and catecholamines are being used in donors, and in the absence of RCTs comparing their effect on graft outcomes, the superiority of one regimen over the other is not established.",

Donor management guidelines emphasize the importance of the prevention or immediate correction of hypovolemia to maintain perfusion in potentially transplantable organs [8, 15] . Brain death-related pathophysiological changes make the clinical assessment of volume status in organ donors even more challenging, compared to general ICU patients [16] . Appropriate monitoring is essential to guide fluid replacement, but optimal monitoring modalities remain undefined [1, 7, 13] . The negative results of the multicentre MOnIToR trial make it difficult to make specific recommendations with regard to fluid resuscitation targets [11] . Euvolemia, even while this is an ill-defined concept, is the primary therapeutic goal, and isotonic crystalloid solutions are the preferred choice for volume replacement in the organ donor. In the absence of evidence of superiority of one over the other, 0.9% saline or lactated Ringer solution are both recommended [8] . Starch-based synthetic colloids should be avoided because of their known adverse effects in critically ill patients generally [17, 18] , and Overview of the sympathetic storm and the pro-inflammatory cascade caused by devastating brain injury with brain stem ischemia. As brain damage progresses and intracranial pressure rises to the point where cerebral perfusion is impaired, progressive ischemic damage through the entire brain and brain stem will cause hypothalamic activation of the autonomic system (so-called autonomic storm), characterized by a systemic stress response with increase in circulating catecholamines. Hemodynamic repercussions: Activation of alpha-1-adrenergic receptors causes vasoconstriction and increased arterial blood pressure (first phase of the Cushing reflex). The circulating high levels of catecholamines can lead to increased oxygen consumption, arrhythmias and cardiac injury. As a result of activation of baroreceptors in the aortic arch and damage to brain stem vasomotor nuclei with loss of peripheral vascular tone, parasympathetic activation leads to hypotension, reduced cardiac contractility, and bradycardia (second phase of the Cushing reflex). Respiratory repercussions: The acute increase in intracranial pressure and the consequent catecholamine release and generalized inflammatory response produces a transient increase in systemic intravascular pressure that damages the alveolar epithelial cells and increases pulmonary capillary permeability to protein. The respiratory system is then vulnerable to further inflammatory insults (the so-called \"second hit\") caused by mechanical stress induced by mechanical ventilation activating a vicious circle where the respiratory function may worsen damage of the central nervous system because hydroxyethyl starch has been associated with a 41% increase in the risk of delayed graft failure after renal transplantation [19] . A perceived challenge in volume management is the potential for a conflict between treatment goals for kidney and lung donation. Traditionally, aggressive fluid resuscitation was believed to result in improved kidney retrieval rates, while a conservative fluid replacement strategy benefited lung procurement. However, in a recent cohort study, a lung-targeted management strategy, including a restrictive fluid balance, had no adverse effect on kidney graft survival compared against historical controls [20] .",

Dosing is largely empirical. Small doses minimize over-prolonged action and risk of hypervolemia, and can be repeated to obtain the desired clinical effect [22] . In practice, an initial IV dose of desmopressin of 1-4 \u03bcg is usual, repeated as necessary until urine volume and serum sodium concentration come under control. If further correction of hypernatremia is required once volume status is stabilized, hypotonic fluids such as 5% dextrose can be considered while being mindful to avoid hyperglycaemia. Vasopressin infusion is indicated when CDI occurs in association with hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation; it acts equally at all three vasopressin receptors, so has pressor in addition to antidiuretic actions. Vasopressin use is associated with increased organ retrieval rates, although it is not known whether this effect is related to its reversal of hypotension, treatment of CDI, or both [23] . Maintaining serum sodium < 155 mEq/L during the management of CDI is recommended because some studies report worse liver graft survival with higher concentrations [8] .",

Previous guidelines recommended the use of liberal tidal volumes [10-15 mL/ kg of predicted body weight (PBW)] [27] with positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of at least 5 cmH 2 O to treat NPE. However, ventilator-induced lung injury is common in organ donors [28] , and recent experimental evidence shows that protective ventilation attenuates the severity of lung injury [29] . A protective ventilator strategy bundle (using 6-8 mL/kg of PBW, PEEP equal to 8-10 cmH 2 O, a closed circuit for tracheal suction, alveolar recruitment manoeuvres after any disconnection, [30] , increased the number of eligible and transplanted lungs, while the number of other transplanted organs was not influenced. Current guidelines recommend 'low stretch protocols' , using lower tidal volumes of 6 mL/kg PBW, plateau pressures < 30 cmH 2 O, and measures to recruit atelectatic lung [8] , an approach similar to the management of acute lung injury patients [31, 32] .",

Low T3 levels were historically ascribed to hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction following brain death. However, several studies of brain-dead organ donors demonstrated residual pituitary function in the majority of patients, due to internal carotids supply, with normal to elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone levels [35, 36] . Thyroxine (T4) levels usually remain in the normal range and levels of inactive reverse-T3 are normal or elevated. This constellation points to non-thyroidal illness rather than central hypothyroidism, with increased peripheral inactivation of thyroid hormone in the presence of a functioning thyroid gland, as also occurs in general ICU patients [35, 36] . Since prolonged and/or severe hypothyroidism may lead to myocardial dysfunction, low T3 levels have been hypothesized to provoke hemodynamic instability in the potential donor. It remains unclear, however, whether non-thyroidal illness occurring after brain death should be treated. A large observational study including data from 63,593 brain-dead organ donors independently associated thyroid hormone substitution with an increased number of procured organs [37] . However, due to the observational design, a causal relationship cannot be inferred. Moreover, the apparent benefit of thyroid hormone replacement was not confirmed by an RCT, which could not find any impact on donor hemodynamics or number of procured organs [38] . However, the relatively low number of patients with hemodynamic stability included in RCTs may preclude a conclusion in this patient subgroup. Hence, consensus guidelines have recommended to consider thyroid hormone replacement in hemodynamically unstable donors [8] . For this purpose, both T4 and T3 substitution have been used, although T4 is increasingly degraded to inactive reverse-T3. Commonly used doses are reported in Table 2 .",

However, as with the thyroid axis, the HPA axis is usually not deficient after brain death [35, 36] . Moreover, in observational studies, donor hemodynamic instability was not associated with hypocortisolaemia or absent corticotropin responsiveness of the adrenals [35, 39] . Nevertheless, corticosteroids may improve hemodynamics through their vasopressor effects [40, 41] . The second potential reason to administer corticosteroids is to reduce inflammation, which may negatively impact graft function [8] . Observational studies have suggested increased organ procurement rates and improved graft and recipient survival by administering corticosteroids [37, 40] . High-quality RCT evidence is lacking, however. A systematic review revealed only one RCT showing clinical benefit, i.e. reduced hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury and acute rejection, which was not confirmed by a subsequent RCT [40] . The large heterogeneity in study design and concurrent therapies, and the poor quality of most RCTs, preclude a strong conclusion [40] . In most studies, high doses of methylprednisolone were administered (Table 2) . Theoretically, corticosteroid-induced or corticosteroid-aggravated hyperglycaemia could have outweighed any potential benefit. More recently, lower doses of hydrocortisone have been studied [40, 41] . A relatively small observational study found improved blood glucose control by such strategy, without a benefit on patient-centred outcomes [40] . In summary, the indications for corticosteroid treatment in brain-dead organ donors remains unclear, but could be considered in case of hemodynamic instability. Importantly, they should only be administered after sampling for tissue typing, since they may reduce human leukocyte antigen expression [8] .",

Hypothermia may have negative consequences because it can activate intravascular coagulation and produce organ damage [45] . Myocardial contractility reduces, and the heart becomes more susceptible to arrhythmias. Independent from this early coagulopathy, hypotension, and injury severity, admission hypothermia has been associated with reduced organ donation in trauma patients [46] .

Although certain subpopulations might benefit from a higher haemoglobin levels, an RBC transfusion target of 7 g/dL is recommended in hemodynamically stable patients [51] . Whether the same target can be extended to brain-dead donors is unclear [8] since no RCTs have addressed this issue, or have examined the effect of transfusion on oxygen delivery (DO 2 ) to tissues or organs. Brain-dead donors typically have a decreased oxygen consumption (VO 2 ). At least in some centres, haemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusions appear to be higher than 7 g/dL. In a retrospective review at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the haemoglobin trough level was above 7 g/dL in 86.5% of donors who received RBC transfusions; in 15.8% it was even above 10 g/dL [52] . Kidneys transplanted from brain-dead donors who had received one or more RBC transfusion had a lower probability of delayed graft function [53] . Currently, universal recommendations on RBC transfusion targets in braindead donors cannot be made. Clinicians should integrate their decision to transfuse in a global therapeutic strategy targeting the cardiovascular system, and consider RBC transfusions in cases of hemodynamic instability with signs of tissue hypoxia [10] . Maybe computerized decision support systems such as the 'Digital Intern' could support clinicians for individualized transfusion dosage in brain-dead donors [54] .",

In particular, an increased fibrin formation, hypofibrinolysis, as well as a higher platelet activation paired with a profound dysregulation in the von Willebrand factor production (which promotes platelet attachment to damaged vasculature), are observed [55] . This prothrombotic state may contribute to formation of microthrombi in transplantable organs, and potentially to a deterioration of their function. However, no specific strategies to avoid these processes have been validated in clinical trials. In brain-dead donors due to traumatic brain injury (TBI), the incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can be as high as 15-25% [56] , especially if the donor had a general bleeding and received multiple units of blood products. Still, DIC in the donor is not a contraindication for transplantation, as it does not affect long-term or even early graft function in heart, lung [56] , and kidney [57] transplantation. Severe thrombopenia could complicate the surgical procedures of organ procurement, but there is uncertainty with regard to the minimum safe platelet level for surgery. In addition, a low platelet level in donors suffering from immune idiopathic thrombopenia was associated with a lower unadjusted 5-year patient and graft survival in liver transplant recipients, but no effects on other transplanted organs was observed [58] . While good clinical evidence is lacking, an international normalized ratio (INR) of < 1.5 and a platelet count of > 50,000/mm 3 have been proposed as therapeutic goals [10] , including the transfusion of clotting factors and/or platelets to achieve these goals before surgery. There are no conclusive evidence-based data on thromboprophylaxis in the braindead organ donor. It might be reasonable in patients with normal coagulation and platelets to prescribe low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) because of the pro-coagulative status.",

The infection screening protocols and its different elements varies across centres and geographical regions [59, 61, 62] . A summary of common screening tests can be found in Table 3 . In the ICU, where the potential donor is usually located, the incidence of infection (mainly pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections) can reach up to 40%, especially when the length of stay is prolonged [63] . Bacteraemia or sepsis are not contraindications to donation, provided appropriate antibiotics have been administered for at least 48 h prior to procurement [8] , and in the absence of shock, multi-organ failure or poor response to antibiotic treatment. Some infections, such as fungal infections or bacteraemia, are only diagnosed after transplantation, and in those cases, it is important to communicate well with the coordinating transplant organization to allow for treatment of the receptor [59] . Bacterial meningitis in the donor is not a contraindication either, after adequate treatment for at least 24-48 h aimed at the known or presumed pathogen, and treatment of the recipient with the same antibiotics for 5-10 days [8] . However, meningoencephalitis due to rare pathogens (including Mycobacterium, lymphocytic chorio-meningitis virus, West Nile virus, rabies, Cryptococcus, Coccidioides, Aspergillus, and Balamuthia) may be a challenge, and specific guidance can be found on the website of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network [64] . When a donor has febrile illness with unclear etiology, signs of meningitis or encephalitis, or focal or global neurological deficits of an unknown origin, the organs should not be offered for procurement [8] . In endemic areas, Zika virus transmission from donor to receptor has been documented [65] , and maybe donors who have recently travelled to these areas should be screened [60] . Organs from HIVpositive donors have been transplanted successfully to HIV-positive receptors [66] , and this is now an acceptable practice. Because new antiviral agents against hepatitis C have become available, successful use of organs from hepatitis C-positive donors has been reported with good outcomes, provided the receptor was treated based on viral load monitoring [67] , or pre-emptively [68] .",

This poses a particular challenge in the management of these patients, and may lead to loss of potential organs for donation if left untreated. In essence, the hemodynamic and respiratory management of brain-dead donors does not differ that much from the management of the critically ill patient, with a focus on substrate supply and consumption matching, and avoiding therapy-induced harm such as ventilator-induced injury or excessive vasoconstriction. Specific endocrine therapies, such as the use of vasopressin or analogues, steroid therapy, and thyroid hormone replacement, are often indicated. Infections in the donor are a special challenge, in particular because of the risk of transmission. The most important management strategies are summarized in Table 4 . Unfortunately, for many of the management strategies in brain-dead donors, we lack evidence from RCTs that demonstrate an effect on receptor outcomes. Hence, some of the elements in brain-dead donor management protocols are based on pathophysiological reasoning, epidemiological observations, or extrapolations from general ICU management strategies.",

As brain damage progresses and intracranial pressure rises to the point where cerebral perfusion is impaired, progressive ischemic damage through the entire brain and brain stem will cause hypothalamic activation of the autonomic system (so-called autonomic storm), characterized by a systemic stress response with increase in circulating catecholamines. Hemodynamic repercussions: Activation of alpha-1-adrenergic receptors causes vasoconstriction and increased arterial blood pressure (first phase of the Cushing reflex). The circulating high levels of catecholamines can lead to increased oxygen consumption, arrhythmias and cardiac injury. As a result of activation of baroreceptors in the aortic arch and damage to brain stem vasomotor nuclei with loss of peripheral vascular tone, parasympathetic activation leads to hypotension, reduced cardiac contractility, and bradycardia (second phase of the Cushing reflex). Respiratory repercussions: The acute increase in intracranial pressure and the consequent catecholamine release and generalized inflammatory response produces a transient increase in systemic intravascular pressure that damages the alveolar epithelial cells and increases pulmonary capillary permeability to protein. The respiratory system is then vulnerable to further inflammatory insults (the so-called \"second hit\") caused by mechanical stress induced by mechanical ventilation activating a vicious circle where the respiratory function may worsen damage of the central nervous system",
