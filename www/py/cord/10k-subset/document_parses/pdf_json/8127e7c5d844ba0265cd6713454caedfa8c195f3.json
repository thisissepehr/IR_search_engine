Epidemics occur each winter that lead to many young infants under the age of three months being hospitalised. The high frequency of RSV infections is probably responsible for the idea that RSV itself induces apnoeas. As RSV is highly associated with apnoeas (2,3), several guidelines recommend hospitalising young infants with an RSV infection even if there are no clinical signs that warrant hospital care (25) . In contrast to these recommendations, our study revealed that the same proportion of apnoeas was also observed in nonRSV infections and that they occurred irrespective of the causative micro-organism. We could not find a statistically significant difference between apnoeas and any specific virus, but our sample size was probably too small to answer that question. Our findings were in line with a prospective multicentre study that demonstrated a similar apnoea risk across the major viral pathogens (20) . Definitions of apnoea differ in the literature (23, 26) , and this makes it difficult to determine their incidence accurately. To compare our study with the literature, we focused on apnoeas at home, namely a parental reported history of respiratory arrest at home, in common with most of the other researchers (15) . A minimum duration of the respiratory arrest was not included in this definition. Most infants with ARI-associated apnoeas receive their care in a general hospital. As a result, the registration of apnoeas during hospitalisation in our study was less accurate than in a PICU setting and was probably under-reported. Furthermore, the phenomenon of apnoea remains a subjective observation when it is not measured with close monitoring of vital parameters, breathing patterns and airflow. Despite these issues, our results stress that parental observations of apnoeas should be taken seriously and are a strong predictor of apnoeas in hospital (Tables 1 and 2) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 484, "end": 488, "text": "(25)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 993, "end": 997, "text": "(20)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1051, "text": "(23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1052, "end": 1055, "text": "26)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1311, "end": 1315, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1959, "end": 1975, "text": "(Tables 1 and 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Young age is an important risk factor for the occurrence of apnoeas (3, 4) .

The correlation of apnoeas with the DSS supports the view that the inflammatory reaction itself is an important factor when it comes to increasing the risk of apnoeas (7) . Activation of the laryngeal chemoreceptors by inflammatory cytokines leads to prolonged respiratory arrest between two breaths (6) , and this view is further supported by the observation that apnoeas mainly occur in children with an involvement of the lower respiratory tract. These are both situations in which hypoxia and hypercapnia are more likely to occur. However, the inflammatory response is only partly responsible, because the significance of the DSS decreased after excluding apnoea from the scoring system. Without extensive breathing registration, it is not possible to establish the relative contribution of the brainstem respiratory centre and the inflammatory status. Four of the infants with apnoea in our study were only diagnosed with an upper respiratory tract infection, and one of these infants suffered from choking periods due to nasal obstruction.
