Type A influenza antigen was detected by Directigen Flu A (Nippon Becton Dickinson, Tokyo, Japan), using nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from the patients through the nasal cavity at the initial consultation.

Other studies 1-6 have reported that anti-influenza viral agents, such as rimantadine hydrochloride, 1,2 amantadine hydrochloride, 1 and neuraminidase inhibitors, [3] [4] [5] [6] are efficacious in alleviating the symptoms of influenza when treatment with these agents is begun within 2 days of the onset of illness. However, to our knowledge, very little is known about the proportion of Japanese patients who visit a community hospital within 2 days of the clinical onset of laboratoryconfirmed influenza infection. Silagy and Watts 6 reported ment of complications. We investigated the time intervals, from the onset of the fever in the 39 patients and from the onset of the severe myalgia in the 1 patient, until their consultation with the physicians to determine whether the interval was appropriate for the administration of antiinfluenza viral agents, including amantadine. The time intervals were determined retrospectively, based on the medical records. Data values were expressed as means \u03ee SD. Differences in age and duration of administration of amantadine between survivors and patients who died were examined by Student's t-test. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The distribution of the consultation times for patients with type A influenza by week of the year is shown in Fig. 1 . The first patient with type A influenza visited the hospital in the fifty-second week of 1999, while 30 (75%) of the 40 patients visited the outpatient clinic from the fourth week to the sixth week of 2000. The time at which the maximum number of patients visited the hospital was similar to that determined by the national investigation (http://idsc.nih.go.jp/index-j.html). Between week 5 and week 6, type A influenza-specific antigen could not be detected, due to the unavailability of Directigen Flu A across Japan. Therefore, some cases were not counted. that 40% of clinically diagnosed influenza patients consulted physicians within 36 h. Although the number of patients with laboratory-confirmed type A influenza was limited in our study, the majority (77.5%) of the patients consulted physicians within 2 days of the appearance of symptoms. The reason for such early consultation could be the sudden onset of high fever (mean body temperature, 38.9 \u03ee 0.8\u00b0C). Understandably, the availability of medical services, including transportation and the location of the medical facility, and the government medical insurance system, influence the medical consultation behavior of patients. Therefore, the results of such investigations will vary based on the country and the available health care system. These factors possibly explain the shorter period between the appearance of symptoms and consultation in our study compared with that of Silagy and Watts. 6 Therefore, in Japan, the results presented here indicate that, following laboratory confirmation of diagnosis of influenza by the rapid antigen-detection assay at the initial consultation, treatment with anti-influenza viral agents could be administered in the majority of patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 269, "end": 272, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 273, "end": 276, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 277, "end": 280, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 281, "end": 284, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1417, "end": 1423, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": ""}, {"text": "In the present study, only patients with laboratoryconfirmed type A influenza were treated with amantadine HCl.
