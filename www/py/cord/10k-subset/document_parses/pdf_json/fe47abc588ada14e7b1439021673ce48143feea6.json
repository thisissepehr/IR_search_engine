The role of epidemiologists is therefore to search for the existing associations between these particular categories and specific diseases in order to determine the risk factors. Some results of this epidemiological quest are well-known. For instance, old age is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, a sex worker's occupation with a higher risk of sexually transmitted disease, and a smoker's lifestyle with cancer. The purpose of epidemiological categories such as a patient's ethnicity and race can be understood in a similar way. For example, while Canadian Aboriginals are found to be at a higher risk of drug abuse-related health problems, 2 immigrants are associated with a higher risk of developing tuberculosis than their non-Aboriginal counterparts. 3 Although social scientists argue that race and ethnicity are social and not biological constructions 4,5,6 and therefore irrelevant as epidemiological variables, the establishment of associations between one's race or ethnicity and specific health problems represents a useful medical concept. For example, if Aboriginal people are found to be at a higher risk of contracting HIV than other groups in Canada, then public health efforts can be directed towards Aboriginal communities. Linking one's race or ethnicity and a specific health problem can attract more resources with which to address a broader range of health-relevant problems in that particular community. Furthermore, without recognizing race or ethnicity, scientists, researchers, decision makers and service providers cannot truly identify those who are the most disadvantaged and the most deserving of their help.",

For instance, it is well established that tuberculosis is a social disease affecting largely those at the bottom of the social ladder. In fact, some authors consider tuberculosis as a penalty for \"ruthless exploitation\" of the poor in capitalist economies. 9, 10 For this reason, establishing that being an Aboriginal or a Third World person is per se a risk factor for developing tuberculosis ignores large socio-economic and political forces which frame the life chances and health of these people.",

On the contrary, those with \"brown skins,\" \"bad characters\" and \"peculiar customs,\" such as Levantines and Orientals (defined at that time as Chinese, Japanese and Hindus) appeared to be those whom Canada least desired to embrace. These groups of immigrants, often seen as health and economic threats to Canadians, were attributed the most negative features among all immigrants.

The two could not exist together, and it had been truly said that \"we must conquer, be conquered or exclude them.\" 24 This kind of negative reporting in newspapers coincided not only with certain attitudes toward \"unscrupulous, lying, and treacherous Chinamen,\" but also with serious actions taken against them. 25 For instance, about 4,500 Chinese immigrants were placed in quarantine, and all Chinatown was burned down after only two cases of bubonic plague were discovered in Hawaii in 1899. Fear of this plague led also to implementing quarantine laws in San Francisco which did not apply to the houses of non-Asians. 26 Incidents of violence against Chinese immigrants were present in Canada, as well. In 1892, an alcohol-fuelled mob rioted in Calgary's Chinese district after an outbreak of smallpox was linked to a laundry business run by Chinese people, although only four deaths from smallpox were reported. 27 The Calgary Herald condemned the riot, but it also advised Canadians to avoid sending their laundry to the Chinese businesses so that they \"may render the stay of Chinamen in Calgary useless and, in a short time, without violence, without any interference with personal liberty, \u2026 rid of what the majority regard as an obnoxious element.\" 28 Despite the fact that contemporary Western societies, proud of their democracy, law and human rights charters, proclaim their concerns about world peace, justice and equality, many studies document that North Americans believe that immigrants have been and continue to be a health threat. The passage of time between the last century and this one has not changed the notion of immigrants as \"disease-breeders.\" 29 In fact, Tomes drew a parallel between the atmosphere of germ panic in North America that surrounded the immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe at the beginning of the twentieth century and the one that surrounded the immigration from the Third World at the end of the millennium:",

            "text": "The association of immigration and infectious disease has intensified scrutiny of national border crossings, from Ellis Island inspection lines to detainment camps for Haitian immigrants. As historians have noted, fears of racial impurities and suspicions of immigrant hygiene practices are common elements in both periods. 30 Recent research provides sound evidence that negative health discourses about immigrants are readily present in the Western world even today, 31, 32, 33, 34 whether they concern the Ebola virus of black Africans, 35 the SARS of the Chinese, 36 or the overreproduction of Latinas, 37 which all threaten in different ways the highly regarded and healthy bodies of white Canadians, Britons, or Americans respectively. In addition, studies showed that more attention is paid to these assumed health risks rather than to the actual health issues of immigrants suffering from trauma, torture, malnutrition and physical violence endured in the past. 38 Moreover, immigrants' negative health images are as frequent as the images of immigrants posing threats to the safety, economic stability and cultural traditions of the native-born populations. 39, 40 This negative representation of the \"other\" (a social construct implying immigrants' presumed or real physical, psychological and behavioural differences) can be traced to the Enlightenment period, during which Europe embraced the concepts of biological determinism and social Darwinism. 41 Scientists of that era believed that people's minds, qualities and abilities (which were presumed to be as different as were their languages) were biologically determined. All these assumed differences had to be classified in some way. As a result of these classification efforts, Carl Linne first classified human races into four categories based on their physical differences. He also linked these different physical characteristics to different cultural, behavioural and moral traits. Other scientists modified and advanced his classification; however, they always maintained the same organizing principle-namely, the hierarchy of races. 42 It was the scientific and technological advancement and industrial prosperity of Europe during that historic era which led scientists to a belief (which they empirically evidenced, for instance, by measuring people's skulls) that the white race was naturally and inherently superior to all other races. 43 By maintaining this discourse of \"the inferior other\" in both scientific and public realms over several centuries, a non-white personal identity acquired a wide range of negative associations, connotations and meanings. 44 Said in his influential work on orientalism explained that \"degenerated\" and \"uncivilized\" non-white races were framed identically to the other undesirable elements in Western societies such as criminals, the mentally ill, the poor, women, etc\u2026. 45 ",

            "text": "One may wonder why it is important that health professionals talk about this \"othering\" discourse today. As Said noted, the construction of personal identity permeated by \"othering\" discourse is highly relevant to many political issues such as immigration, criminal law, foreign policies, and education, 46 since those today deemed different and inferior experience profound inequalities in economic status, housing, health, education, criminal justice, and the labour market. 47 The concept of \"othering\" serves as the boundarymaintaining mechanism that leads to the preservation of social distance and hierarchy between various groups in society. 48 One of the efficient means of maintaining a socially stratified society with the white race on top of the social hierarchy is to feed continuous fear of and prejudice towards the \"others.\" One way to feed this fear is to represent the \"other\" as a threat to health. For instance, by constructing immigrant personal identity as a tuberculosis threat, tuberculosis management and policies tend to focus on restricting immigration and surveying immigrants rather than on addressing the broad social, economic and political reasons which foster tuberculosis within the immigrant population. 49 To avoid designing health policies and clinical practices operating on the premises of the \"othering\" discourse, we need to implement several changes in our medical, nursing or science school curricula. These curricula need to challenge the notion that disease is purely a biological entity residing in a depersonalized human body. 50 Future health professionals and service providers need to know that medical knowledge is subject to diverse historical, social, cultural and political influences. 51 They need to reflect on how history, economy and politics-as well as their own personal biases and prejudices-can affect many health conditions, clinical practices, health policies and research, and even the structure of health organizations. 52, 53 Until our medical schools are ready to introduce such an educational approach, the query, \"Have you been abroad recently?\" is likely to continue topping the list of diagnostic questions posed when addressing the health problems of our visibly different immigrant patients.",
