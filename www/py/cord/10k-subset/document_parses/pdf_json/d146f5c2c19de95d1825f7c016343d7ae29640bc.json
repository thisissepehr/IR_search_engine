            "text": "On September 21, 2008, Thabo Mbeki resigned his position as the President of South Africa under intense pressure by the leadership of the ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC). The international news media showed no love lost for the former President. The Guardian called him a ''failed hero'' (September 22, 2008) and The New York Times stated he ''leaves a legacy of squandered potential and significant failures'' (September 26, 2008) . Although most news coverage readily reported Mbeki's tragic political failures, including his policy of non-confrontation with Zimbabwe and a widening of the gap between rich and poor, his policy on HIV/AIDS medical treatment is what many agree he will be remembered for most. Mbeki and his Minister of Health, Manto Tshbalala-Msimang, systematically and aggressively promoted the use of ''traditional'' and nutritional medicines-such as beetroot, lemons, and garlic-as legitimate treatments for HIV/AIDS, while deeming antiretroviral (ARVs) drugs toxic or poisonous. This public policy campaign greatly contributed to a general fear of western pharmaceutical medicines within the HIV positive population of South Africa. It is estimated that this policy cost about 330,000 people their lives from 2000 to 2005 (Chigwedere et al. 2008) .",

More specifically, media representations of medicine in South Africa, which culminate in a mass condemnation of Mbeki's HIV/AIDS policies, reflect an ongoing struggle between indigenous and colonial practices that have dominated South Africa's social, cultural, and economic landscape for over a century.",

Since South Africa is the most heavily infected and affected nation in the world, and its politics are well publicized in the United States and Britain, it is a good case study to explore the degree to which contemporary representations of the crisis continue to carry and convey persistent colonial discourses and tropes. This article examines the contemporary western media portrayal of western and traditional medicine in South Africa and how the introduction of HIV/AIDS as a major news story around the year 2000 shifted this characterization. Insights are then examined in light of the colonial context of South Africa's political struggle over medicine.",

In many rural areas over 40% of all pregnant women have tested positive (UNAIDS/WHO 2008), creating a health emergency of unprecedented proportions. Creating an effective and comprehensive strategy for dealing with this HIV/AIDS epidemic has not been easy, in part due to other pressing social and political issues that were coincident with the introduction of the disease. In 1982, when the first case of AIDS was diagnosed in South Africa, the country was in a state of emergency due to the policy of apartheid. When apartheid ended in 1994, the new government began to show concern for controlling the HIV outbreak; 4.3% of all pregnant women were testing positive. Although ANC government started strong on HIV issues in 1994, by 1997, it had completely reversed course, going so far as to deny the severity of the problem (Schneider and Stein 2001; Van der Vliet 2004 , Butler 2005 . In 1999, Thabo Mbeki was elected president, and only one year later, he began to publicly state he did not believe HIV caused AIDS. His administration decided not to fund antiretroviral (ARV) treatment for HIV positive people using public services, including pregnant women who were at risk to pass the virus onto their child.",

By all accounts, the process of distributing ARVs has been slow and fraught with controversy. Currently, 429,000 HIV positive people are on ARVs ), yet the total number in need of ARV treatment is much higher (only about 17% of patients who qualified for ARVs received them in 2005) (Goggin et al. 2009 ). The government under Mbeki stated the cost of the medicines is too high, and their effectiveness is not known. Former President Mbeki stated on several occasions that ARVs may be ''toxic'' (Van der Vliet 2004), discouraging their use by his own citizens despite pleas from the international community, activist groups, and other health organizations for him to reverse his position on HIV/AIDS treatment. With President Mbeki's resignation, many are optimistic that the new administration will do better in treating the HIV positive population. At this time it seems the new administration is more likely to support the use of ARVs, but President Zuma is not without his critics. In 2006, he was tried but subsequently acquitted for allegedly raping an HIV positive woman. At the trial he acknowledged having sex with the woman, who he knew to be HIV positive, but stated he took a shower after to prevent infection. He was widely condemned for these actions by women's rights and AIDS activists (BBC 2006) .",

For example, the colonial perception of the indigenous tie to nature, reflecting persistent modern assumptions (following Latour 1993) , are present in numerous representations of indigenous medicine. These range from images of the San of Southern Africa trekking through the desert, understanding the medicinal use of each plant, to the Native American 'harmonious' ties with nature, with medicine men making teas from barks and flowers to cure ills. By the beginning of the twentieth century African traditional practices, indigenous experts, and natural materials began to compete with modern biomedical medicine practiced by doctors with scientific training. The result was a reconfiguration of what counted as authentic and effective medicine, with struggles throughout the colonies over the status of indigenous medicine. Complex configurations of laws and discourses became sites in which concepts of the indigenous and modernity became entangled and disputed (Flint 2008) .",

This confusion is not new, of course, as such elisions over what traditional medicine is and does can be traced to colonial images of ignorant indigenous people relying on witchdoctors for treatment and the need of the white doctors to truly heal them from the unhealthy African environment (Brantlinger 1985; Packard 1985; Crozier 2007) .",

Third were articles on traditional medicinal practices, including those about traditional healers and traditional medicine. This category includes articles about traditional treatments for disease as well as traditional practices such as circumcision. Articles about muti killings were also included in this topic because these are often considered to be murders for use in traditional medicine (a claim I will discuss further). Fourth most common were articles on how South Africans were sick from HIV, which ranged from human interest stories about a person who is HIV positive, to general articles about how South Africa has the world highest number of HIV positive people. Finally, the fifth most common stories were articles on why or how generic ARV medications are the salvation for HIV positive people in South Africa. These articles fall into two categories. They are either editorials that state that generics are needed due to their less expensive cost to fight HIV or they are articles about generic drugs being used already.",

A muti killing is a practice where a person is killed so that his or her body parts may be used for ''medicinal'' purposes (the word muti is derived from the Zulu and Xhosa word for medicine). Several of the articles about muti killings, particularly those around 1995, discuss a very influential report commissioned by the government which came out on muti killings and witchcraft in South Africa. News coverage about muti killings during this time period usually tells of a child who was killed for his or her body parts, along with details of what each body part would be used for.

Only witches are involved in the intentional killing of individuals for ''health'' reasons, which are usually related to the belief that an individual is captive to ''evil forces.'' Conversely, traditional healers do not participate in the killing of individuals, and are more inclined to use spiritual means to heal or protect people who consult them for assistance. This critical distinction is rarely made in newspaper coverage of medicine in South Africa, where traditional healers are often called witchdoctors (see The New York Times (Eprile 1993) , The Guardian (Beresford 1995) and (Dillner 1995) , and The Times (Hornsby 1986) ). Since traditional healers believe themselves to be protecting against witchcraft, the use of the word witchdoctor to describe them is considered insulting. Sexuality is also a reoccurring theme, with many articles discussing the importance of traditional medicine in curing sexual ailments, some going so far as to claim that all traditional medicine is for sexual purposes (Hornsby 1986) . Others discuss the practice of checking girls for virginity (Daley 1999) . Still others examine the practice of male circumcision and its importance in becoming a man, often taking a critical view since several boys die each year due to infections (Taylor 1995) .",

These images of the witchdoctor with ''amulets'' hanging from her neck, or the dangerous image of children massacred for use in traditional medicine are the same images that dominated colonial representations. It was these images that led to the suppression of traditional medicine during the colonial and apartheid periods due to fear and misunderstanding of the practice. Though the HIV infection rate had been increasing in South Africa for over a decade, it was only in 2000 that the international community began to take notice. As previously discussed, several events and circumstances forced the world to examine the epidemic occurring in South Africa, including the alarming percentage of pregnant women testing positive for HIV (approximately 24.5%, Department of Health 2000) and Thabo Mbeki's public denial that HIV causes AIDS. From 2000 to 2001, there was also intense coverage of the international trial between pharmaceutical companies and the South African government over the patents of HIV drugs. These events, and the corresponding newspaper coverage that resulted, forced a change in the type of newspaper articles about medicine in South Africa. Suddenly, an HIV/AIDS crisis was at hand. While the topic of medicine was of little importance in western media coverage before 2000, it began to define how the western media saw the country after 2000. South Africa became a country with the most HIV positive people in the world; a place forgotten not only by the West, but also forsaken by their own government, and traditional medicine was now a cure and a curse for those sick with AIDS.",

The press dubbed Tshbalala-Msimang 'Dr. Garlic' in many of the articles, as she was quoted as ''extolling nutrition over drugs (Boseley 2005) .'' The Mbeki administration's denial that HIV caused AIDS or that ARVs were effective in treating the disease was the dominant topic in 91 articles in this period.

According to most newspaper articles, this is both the fault of the government's lack of action and the high price of pharmaceuticals. At the same time the media is critiquing the government, they are exploring the concept of enrolling traditional healers into the fight against AIDS, as they can convince HIV positive people to take their ARVs. The South African government is represented as not only passively allowing large segments of the population to seek traditional treatments over biomedical options, but as also actively claiming the traditional treatments are the better option. They also frequently deny those interested in ARVs access to the drugs, leaving them no choice than to rely on traditional remedies. This leads to confusion in the press. We have a population being directed to traditional healers, then from the healers being directed to a biomedical system not supported by the government and therefore not able to properly care for them. The media addresses this through reporting on a rise in regulation, or calls for regulation. The lack of regulation is seen, in part, as a cause of the AIDS crisis because unregulated healers will not refer a potentially HIV positive person to a biomedical doctor, increasing the chance that person will spread the virus due to their lack of knowledge of their HIV status. An increase in regulation, especially of traditional medicine, is one way to ensure that those who need it are treated correctly, with western medicine, the same western medicine unavailable to them.",

Second, healers were forbidden to mix or compound their own herbs as medicines. Although many policy makers at the time stated a fear that the compounded medicines made by traditional healers may do harm to the people using them, the more immediate reason for the ban was that the white doctors did not want competition from traditional healers (Flint 2001 (Flint , 2008 .

There is an inability of the orientalist western imaginary to understand traditional medicine outside of the already prefigured beliefs about Africans and their traditional healing practices, as seen in how the media often conflates witchcraft with traditional medicine. In addition, among conventional medical practitioners themselves in South Africa, there is widespread belief that traditional medicines are unproven, scientifically untested, and ineffective. To the degree that there are emerging calls for the inclusion of traditional healers in contemporary HIV/ AIDS treatment, informal discussions with members of the allopathic medical community suggests widespread skepticism and resistance. 2 Media representations of traditional healing both support and challenge the medical establishment. By calling for inclusion, newspapers confront the expert power of doctors.
