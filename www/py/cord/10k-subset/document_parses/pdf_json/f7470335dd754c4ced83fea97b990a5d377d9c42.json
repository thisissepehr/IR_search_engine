We compared the characteristics of patients with virus-positive versus virusnegative BALF. Of the 636 BALF samples sent to the microbiology laboratory, 232 underwent viral tests.

The development of molecular biology techniques, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), has dramatically increased the yield of viral tests for various respiratory diseases [2, 4, 5, 8] . However, most studies have been performed in specific settings, with highly selected patients. Hence, the yield of viral tests on BAL fluid (BALF) remains poorly characterized in routine practice. A key dilemma with the development of new tests is the relatively high cost associated with their non-discriminated use. To better inform the use of viral tests in patients with respiratory diseases, we performed an observational, retrospective study in our institution, with three aims: (i) to assess the diagnostic value of viral tests on BALF in routine practice; (ii) to analyze the characteristics of patients with virus-positive BALF; and (iii) to identify the factors predictive of positive viral tests in BALF.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 127, "end": 130, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 243, "end": 246, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 247, "end": 250, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 251, "end": 254, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 255, "end": 258, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 382, "end": 385, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 386, "end": 389, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 390, "end": 393, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 394, "end": 397, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 577, "end": 580, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 581, "end": 583, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 584, "end": 586, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 587, "end": 589, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Pontchaillou University Hospital is a 1,819-bed tertiary-care hospital which serves as a referral center for the area of Rennes, France.

Hence, testing for viruses in BALF may be considered in patients with a wide spectrum of clinical and radiological abnormalities [16, 17] .

All these studies found that HSV and CMV in BALF are associated with increased morbidity and/ or mortality. However, the causal relationship between HSV or CMV in BALF and patient outcomes cannot be ascertained from these observational studies. Among the rapid tests currently available, PCR is one of the most valuable, the results being available within hours with high sensitivity, especially in immunocompromised patients [2] . Multiplex PCR tests, with their ability to detect several viruses in one set, may be particularly interesting in the diagnostic workup of acute respiratory diseases suspected to be of viral origin [24] [25] [26] . In our study, the diagnostic yield of viral tests would have dropped from 30 to 20 %, had PCR tests not been performed.

Firstly, the retrospective review of medical charts identified a significant proportion of patients who were unlikely to suffer from viral infections, and for whom viral tests should not have been performed. In contrast, among patients not included in this study as no viral test was requested, there probably were patients who would have benefited from viral tests on BALF. However, the comparison of the 212 patients who had BALFs tested for viruses in 2008 and a random selection of 40 patients who had BALF samples not tested for viruses during the same year found that the only significant differences were immunodepression (10 % vs. 83 %, p<0.0001) and ground-glass attenuations on CT scan (23 % vs. 74 %, p<0.0001). This suggests that clinicians are aware of the situations most likely to be associated with the presence of viruses, and that they appropriately select the patients in whom viral tests are more likely to return positive. Lastly, PCR was performed in only 149 of 232 BALF investigated for viruses. More systematic use of PCR tests in these patients may have increased the proportion of viruses identified. Secondly, the identification of virus in BALF during the diagnostic workup of a respiratory disease does not systematically imply that the virus is responsible for the disease and that the patient will improve with appropriate antiviral treatment. Despite these limitations, this observational study allowed us to identify categories of respiratory diseases where viral tests are very unlikely to return positive (e.g., initial assessment of immunocompetent patients with interstitial pneumonia or pulmonary micronodules). As a consequence, indications for viral tests in BALF were dramatically reduced for these patients in our institution.
