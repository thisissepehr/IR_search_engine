Heparanase is an endo-\u03b2-D-glucuronidase which cleaves chains of HS present at both cell surfaces and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Early on, its deregulation appeared to be involved in tumor cell growth, migration and metastasis, and later on in other pathologies such as inflammation, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and nephropathy [1] [2] [3] [4] . Heparin, exclusively produced by mast cells, is a highly sulfated form of HS. Early studies evidenced the HS higher charged congener unfractionated heparin (UFH) as an efficient heparanase inhibitor as well as substrate [5, 6] . Then, investigations were mainly oriented to identify non-anticoagulant heparin derivatives to overcome the UFH anticoagulation and bleeding side effects as well as to improve its pharmacokinetics and bioavailability.

HS is expressed in almost all cells of mammalian species as linear polyanionic chains, differing in size (20 up to 100 kDa) and sulfated domain distribution among species and tissues of the same species. The composition of natural physiological HS chains can be altered in several pathological conditions [8] [9] [10] [11] . Heparin and HS-like glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) have been isolated from avian intestinal mucosa [12] , terrestrial invertebrates [13, 14] , marine crustacean and mollusk species [15] [16] [17] as well as bacterial and virus species [12] .

However, functional studies are hampered by the fact that samples of pure HS are very expensive and difficult to isolate. The first HS rich preparation was isolated in 1948 as by-product of heparin manufacturing process and named \"heparin monosulfate\" for its low sulfate content [19] . On the other hand, the presently available pharmaceutical heparin is mainly derived from the porcine intestinal mucosa extracts which contain other linear GAGs, [dermatan-(DeS) and chondroitin-sulfate (ChS)] which are difficult to separate from HS [12] .

However, three years earlier in 1975, a heparanase-like endoglucuronidase from murine mast cells was found able to cleave macromolecular heparin to functional heparin [22] and in 1983 lymphoma cells were found able to degrade HS chains of HSPGs of subendothelial ECM [23] . Finally, in 1984 other authors reported for the first time in the title of their paper the term heparanase to design an endoglucuronidase, able to degrade HS, produced by the highly invasive lung metastatic murine B16-BL6 melanoma cells [24] . Endoglucuronidase activities were previously described in other mammalian tissues and cells such as rat liver tissues [25] , human skin fibroblasts and placenta [26] , human platelets [27] and activated T lymphocytes [28] . A partially purified human platelet enzyme was found able to cleave both HS and heparin [29] . In the following years, the increasing interest in heparanase function and role in several pathological contexts has been documented by an ever-growing number of reports summarized and commented in [3] and in Vlodavsky et al., Chap. 1 in this volume. Since 1984 heparanase-like activity was detected in several human normal and malignant cells and tissues. However, the lack of selective activity assays along with the low concentration and instability of crude enzyme have hindered heparanase isolation and characterization until 1999 when five teams have independently reported the cloning and functional expression of the human heparanase gene in mammalian and insect cells [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] Heparanase, at present the only known mammalian endo \u03b2-D-glucuronidase, is physiologically expressed primarily in platelets, activated white blood cells and placenta. The heparanase human gene encodes for a pre-proenzyme which undergoes removal of the N-terminal signal peptide in the endoplasmic reticulum to give rise to the pro-enzyme of 65 kDa. Cleavage of a 6 kDa linker peptide by cathepsins in the lysosomes leads to an active enzyme constituted of two subunits of 50 and 8 kDa that are not covalently linked, as also confirmed by X-ray crystal structures [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] and (Vlodavsky et HS cleavage is affected by heparanase expression levels and proteolytic activation but can also be influenced by the activity of other HS biosynthetic and modifying enzymes. Notably, the multiple substrate recognition allows heparanase to degrade HS chains independently of cell specificity and environment [9] . Hence, heparanase localization and activating processes are relevant in determining its biological function in a variety of healthy and malignant cells and tissues [35] . Moreover, heparanase upregulation has been described in several malignancies and pathological conditions including acute and chronic inflammation, fibrosis, amyloidosis, diabetes and related nephropathies, osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis and other vessel wall pathologies [3, 6] The first evidence of heparanase activity in the murine melanoma B16-BL6 [24] and T-lymphoma [23] experimental models, were provided by Nakajima et al. [24] and Vlodavsky et al. [23] associating the in vivo metastatic potential of these cells with HS degradation.

Interestingly, the N-unsubstituted D-glucosamine (GlcNH 3 + ) in the disaccharide GlcA-\u03b21-4-GlcNH 3 + 6S, very uncommon (0.7 to 4% of total GlcN) in natural HS chains [50], was quite abundant in HS of mammary carcinoma cells [51, 52] .

This discovery was extremely useful in the search for new anticoagulant and antithrombotic heparins endowed with better pharmacokinetic and fewer side effects and analogously, in the identification of non-anticoagulant congeners to be evaluated in other therapeutic fields. The progress in the knowledge of the HS/heparin biosynthetic pathway [57, 58] has opened the way for chemo-enzymatic synthesis of polymers called \"bioheparin\" [59] and \"bioengineered heparins\" [60] . These novel approaches were stimulated, at the end of the nineties, by the \"mad-cow crisis\", which urged the search for new animal sources of heparin or semisynthetic derivatives to compensate the withdrawal of bovine heparin from the market. Looking for heparin-like GAGs, several N-deacetylated N-sulfated sulfoamino heparosans were firstly obtained and then subjected to O-sulfation at the 6-O position of GlcNS and 2-O, 3-O sulfation of GlcA [59] . A number of semisynthetic O-sulfated sulfamino heparosans (SAHSs), differing in degree and pattern of O-sulfation as well as molecular size, were tested in the mouse B16-BL6 melanoma model. Among these compounds, the two high Mw SAHS-2 (Mw 25,7 kDa) and SAHS-4 (Mw 22.7 kDa) and a low molecular weight derivative SAHS-5 (Mw 3.2 KDa), showed a remarkable anti-metastatic activity, with the sole SAHS-4 displaying a modest anticoagulant activity [61] . Highly N,O-sulfated heparosans were found to bind FGF-2 and inhibit FGF-2-induced endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis likely interfering with the formation of FGF-2/FGFR/HS complexes [62] [63] [64] . Various species of O-sulfated N-acetyl heparosan (OSK5) (Fig. 20 .4) were reported to bind FGF-1, \u22122 and \u2212 8 with different FGF signaling antagonist activity influenced by the type of FGF and FGFR expressed and by the cellular context [65] . This class of derivatives (OSK5), along with new preparations of O-sulfated sulfamino heparosans (NSOSK5), were also tested as heparanase inhibitors in a translational project \"Heparanase\" supported by the EC, which recognized the enzyme as a potential therapeutic target for cancer. New powerful analytical tools, such as 2-D NMR spectroscopy, have allowed a better characterization of the component profile and sequence of heparosan derivatives and complex GAGs [66] .

Heparanase and selectins are inhibited by LMWHs, albeit with a somewhat lower efficacy than UFH. Taking into consideration the heterogeneity of the starting UFH chains in term of size, beyond the anticoagulant activity, their depolymerization can offer other compositional and interaction differences affecting the pharmacological properties of LMWH. For example, early in vivo evaluation of antimetastatic effects evidenced a significantly higher activity of dalteparin (Fragmin) in comparison with that of nadroparin or enoxaparin [5] . Size fractionation of tinzaparin allowed separation of HMW fractions whose components, not present in the other two LMWHs, are endowed with high selectin inhibitory activity but low antiXa activity [74] .

Structural characterization of ROHs obtained from UFH from different animal sources are reported by Alekseeva et al. [97] .

Early investigations suggested that, other than temperature and pH values, neighboring residues could influence and differentiate the periodate oxidation rate of IdoA versus GlcA [100, 101] . Other studies evidenced that mild acid hydrolysis of ROH gave oligomers bearing at the non-reducing end of non-anticoagulant LMWH, the N,3,6 trisulfated glucosamine residues [102] . In a recent kinetics study of enoxaparin periodate oxidation, NMR-HSQC showed that the complete IdoA oxidation occurred in 2 hr. while GlcA was only partially oxidized after 8 hr.

A number of nonanticoagulant ROH were tested in a variety of therapeutic areas where UFH was active.

The oxidation of aldehyde to carboxyl was performed using sodium chlorite (NaClO 2 ) in aqueous media, pH 4, 0 \u00b0C for 24 h or at a neutral pH in the presence of oxidation catalysts [129] . The data in Table 20 .2 show that the majority of the reported DCoxHs exhibited high efficacy in inhibiting in vitro heparanase and CAG multiple myeloma growth in vivo, independently of the Mw. It is noteworthy in vivo human CAG multiple myeloma growth inhibition after 14 days treatment with drugs administered at 60 mg/Kg/day by subcutaneous continuous delivery [128] that the random presence of about 40% of dicarboxylated gs-uronic acid residues, instead of both 2-O-sulfated and non-sulfated uronic acid, along the heparin sequences, did not affect the interaction with the enzyme or its inhibition. Accordingly, these modifications did not significantly change the in vivo tumor growth inhibition in comparison with Roneparstat. The interaction with heparanase and its inhibition by a tricarboxylate moiety was first demonstrated with the natural enzyme inhibitor trachyspic acid, a metabolite of Talaromyces trachyspermus [130] , and was later confirmed by its synthetic (+) enantiomer ( Fig. 20.7) [131].", "cite_spans": [{"start": 462, "end": 466, "text": "[87]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 678, "end": 683, "text": "[129]", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1055, "text": "[128]", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 1615, "end": 1620, "text": "[130]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 698, "end": 706, "text": "Table 20", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 1681, "end": 1691, "text": "Fig. 20.7)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "Dicarboxylated Oxy-Heparins (DCoxyHs)"}, {"text": "Recently, different classes of biotinylated N-acetyl gs-heparins were obtained by several approaches.

UFH and heparosan derivatives, including N-acetyl and de-O-sulfated derivatives were assayed upon H5N1 virus infection. 2-O-desulfated and ssLMWH showed an anti-viral activity comparable to that of UFH whereas N-acetylation was detrimental [91] . In a recent study investigating the interaction of GAGs with the Zika virus envelop protein (Zikave), porcine intestinal UFH was shown to bind Zikave more efficiently than other GAGs (ChS, DeS). Among the UFH oligomers, the binding with Zikave was inhibited starting from the 18-mer [136] . A number of derivatives, including heparin and N-acetyl heparin and their 2-O, 6-O, 2,6 di O desulfated derivatives, were assayed for effect on H5N1 influenza virus invasion comprising a H5 pseudo typed HIV system.

It was demonstrated that inhibition of interactions between parasite and erythrocytes can be achieved by heparin fragments sizing more than 3.5 kDa (dodecasaccharide) bearing natural N,6-O and 2-O sulfation [138] .
