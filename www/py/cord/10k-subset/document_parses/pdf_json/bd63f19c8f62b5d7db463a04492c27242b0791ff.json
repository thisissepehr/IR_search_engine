            "text": "Background: Influenza infections are often complicated by secondary infections, which are associated with high morbidity and mortality, suggesting that influenza profoundly influences the immune response towards a subsequent pathogenic challenge. However, data on the immunological interplay between influenza and secondary infections are equivocal, with some studies reporting influenza-induced augmentation of the immune response, whereas others demonstrate that influenza suppresses the immune response towards a subsequent challenge. These contrasting results may be due to the use of various types of live bacteria as secondary challenges, which impedes clear interpretation of causal relations, and to differences in timing of the secondary challenge relative to influenza infection. Herein, we investigated whether influenza infection results in an enhanced or suppressed innate immune response upon a secondary challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in either the acute or the recovery phase of infection. Methods: Male C57BL/6J mice were intranasally inoculated with 5 \u00d7 10 3 PFU influenza virus (pH1N1, strain A/Netherlands/602/2009) or mock treated. After 4 (acute phase) or 10 (recovery phase) days, 5 mg/kg LPS or saline was administered intravenously, and mice were sacrificed 90 min later. Cytokine levels in plasma and lung tissue, and lung myeloperoxidase (MPO) content were determined. Results: LPS administration 4 days after influenza infection resulted in a synergistic increase in TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 concentrations in lung tissue, but not in plasma. This effect was also observed 10 days after influenza infection, albeit to a lesser extent. LPS-induced plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were enhanced 4 days after influenza infection, whereas a trend towards increased pulmonary IL-10 concentrations was found. LPS-induced increases in pulmonary MPO content tended to be enhanced as well, but only at 4 days post-infection. Conclusions: An LPS challenge in the acute phase of influenza infection results in an enhanced pulmonary pro-inflammatory innate immune response. These data increase our insight on influenza-bacterial interplay. Combing data of the present study with previous findings, it appears that this enhanced response is not beneficial in terms of protection against secondary infections, but rather damaging by increasing immunopathology.",

            "text": "Several studies have evaluated immunological interactions between influenza and bacterial infections, including infections with Gram-negative bacteria [3] . In vitro studies in which influenza-infected alveolar macrophages were subsequently stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial compound that induces a profound innate immune response, revealed increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) \u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-6 [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , indicative of a priming effect on these cells by influenza. Data from in vivo animal studies are ambiguous. Similar to the in vitro data, some report enhanced responses. For instance, influenza infection in mice was shown to enhance the inflammatory response and neuropathogenicity resulting from LPS administration on days 3 and 4 after influenza inoculation [9] . Likewise, murine influenza infection resulted in increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in both plasma and lungs, and enhanced pulmonary neutrophil influx upon pneumococcal infection 7 days later [10] . Similar results were observed in mice 14 days after influenza infection [11] . However, two otherwise largely comparable studies demonstrated reduced pulmonary pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations upon Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus infections in mice infected with influenza 7 days before, indicative of influenza-induced immunosuppression [12, 13] . These equivocal results may be due to differences in the severity or kinetics of the influenza infection or the use of different bacteria as secondary challenges, thereby targeting various complex multi-receptor signaling pathways. Also, the use of live bacteria could have contributed to these ambiguous results. For instance, if influenza would induce immunosuppression and thereby facilitate outgrowth of bacteria upon a secondary live infectious challenge, the increased bacterial burden can eventually result in fulminant inflammation, which would wrongfully suggest influenza-induced augmentation of the immune response.",

For example, a preceding influenza infection in mice gravely enhanced lung injury induced by a secondary infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae 7 days later, resulting in a severe necrotic pneumonia accompanied by increased mortality [10] . Also, Fig. 4 MPO content in lung homogenates of mice that received mock/influenza followed by NaCl/LPS 4 or 10 days later.

These and our study reveal that the enhancing effect on the pro-inflammatory innate immune response is most evident in the lungs, probably because the influenza-induced damage and consequent inflammatory effects are most pronounced at this site. In this context, our data are in line with the recommendation to use corticosteroids in patients with severe influenza infections in the Intensive Care Unit to counteract the pulmonary hyperinflammatory response causing ARDS. Several underlying mechanisms may contribute to the observed effects. At the cellular level, studies have shown that influenza and certain bacterial pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, utilize similar immunological pathways and that the overlap in the inflammatory mediators produced thereby creates augmentation of the immune response during sequential infection, in turn causing immunopathology [17, 18] . Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that influenza stimulates TNF-\u03b1 gene transcription activators or may interfere with labile transcription repressor proteins and stabilizes TNF-\u03b1 mRNA by delaying its degradation [8] . Alternatively, the increased lung MPO levels observed do not necessarily reflect PMN infiltration into the lungs, but may (also) result from PMNs trapped in the vasculature, as circulating activated neutrophils become rigid and can be trapped within the small capillaries of the lung [19] . As such, increased entrapment of leukocytes in the pulmonary vasculature during influenza infection could also contribute to the enhanced inflammatory cytokine levels upon LPS challenge. We can only speculate on this, because no histological data are available, which represents a limitation of this work.",

For instance, pro-inflammatory cytokines are induced in influenza-infected cells to limit viral replication and to initiate downstream immune responses [20] . However, this is not supported by previous work, where an increased bacterial burden was observed irrespective of an enhanced or suppressed response [11] [12] [13] . Several explanations for this observation may be put forward. First, next to potentiating pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, the present study and work by others [11] have shown that influenza infection also potentiates production of the key anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which was demonstrated to be crucial in facilitating bacterial outgrowth upon secondary challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae [11] . Second, influenza may on the one hand prime for production of innate cytokines produced by myeloid cells, but impair T cell-derived cytokines that are instrumental for the adaptive immune response. This was elegantly demonstrated by Kudva et al., who showed that, in line with our results, infection with Staphylococcus aureus 6 days after influenza resulted in increased pulmonary levels of innate cytokines such as IL-6 and MCP-1, and increased neutrophil influx to the lungs, but decreased concentrations of T-cell-derived IL-17 and IL-22, which were demonstrated to play a pivotal role in fending off the staphylococcal infection [21] .",

This could be partly biased by the exclusion of two mice in both recovery groups due to severe influenza infection. However, it might also be argued that 10 days post-infection is too soon for these effects to manifest. For example, profound desensitization towards LPS and flagellin, another Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand, was observed in alveolar macrophages obtained from mice up to 6 weeks after influenza infection [22] . Furthermore, the direction of the response upon a secondary challenge is probably highly dependent on the pathogen or stimulus used, each using distinct intracellular signaling pathways. With regard to this, it is well-known that influenza virus particularly predisposes to Aspergillus fumigatus, which is present in 25% of all influenza patients [23, 24] , causing infections such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis that are associated with very high mortality rates. As different mechanisms may be important in host defense towards various pathogens, the specific response towards Aspergillus fumigatus could be suppressed by a preceding influenza infection. The use of corticosteroids may be another important factor in the observed vulnerability towards particular secondary infections, as steroid use was shown to be independently associated with the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus in sputum of cystic fibrosis patients [25] and with a substantially increased risk of community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [26] . Furthermore, a meta-analysis revealed that the use of corticosteroids was significantly associated with nosocomial infections [27] . To the best of our knowledge, these putative detrimental effects of corticosteroid treatment during influenza on secondary infections have yet to be studied systematically in animal models. In any case, it remains to be determined whether the overall effects of corticosteroid treatment are beneficial or not, as they may lead to increased susceptibility in a subset of influenza virus-infected patients but may also provide health benefits in another subset of influenza virus-infected patients.",
