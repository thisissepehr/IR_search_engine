H9N2 infection rapidly triggered the activation of innate immunity through phosphorylation of signaling molecules including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Using specific inhibitors or small-interfering RNA, we confirmed that indirubin derivatives can suppress H9N2-induced cytokines production through MAPKs and STAT3 signaling pathways. These results underscore the immunomodulatory effects of indirubin derivatives on pulmonary endothelium and its therapeutic potential on IAV-infection.",

IAV are single-stranded negative-sense RNA viruses that belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae. Their RNA genome is comprised of eight segments which encode for 11 viral proteins including the surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), matrix proteins M1 and M2, nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS2, and polymerase proteins PB1, PB2, PA, and PB1-F2 2 . The glycoproteins HA and NA play a determinative role in viral tropism as well as pathogenesis. For instance, seasonal H3N2 virus mainly bind onto the epithelium of the upper respiratory track, while highly pathogenic avian H5N1 attaches abundantly to the lower respiratory tract 3 .",

The host pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) play a vital role in recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from invading pathogens. Its activation initiates and orchestrates the innate immunity during an infection 4 . Transmembrane toll-like receptors (TLRs), such as TLR-3 5 /7 6 /8 7 /10 8 and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors (RLRs) 9 can recognize influenza viral protein or viral RNA molecules. Recognition of IAV by the host cell activates several intracellular signaling pathways and results in the induction of gene expression for cytokine or chemokines 10 . These cytokines and chemokines are essential in cell-cell communication and recruitment of immune cells. Gene expression of cytokines is tightly regulated by a complex network of signaling pathway. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including p38 MAPK (p38), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), are the most extensively studied signaling pathway in the context of innate immunity 11 . Each MAPK has a distinct role in conveying the effects of PRRs activation. In general, JNK activation is pro-inflammatory 12 , while p38 and ERK play a role in both eliciting and turning-off inflammatory responses [13] [14] [15] . Binding of cytokines on their transmembrane receptor leads to activation of downstream signaling pathways, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins are the common signaling molecules which function as transcription factors for cytokines production 16, 17 .",

Recent studies on highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses like H5N1 subtype highlighted that lung endothelium are at the center of innate immune cells recruitment and excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production during severe IAV infection [22] [23] [24] . Clinical presentation of severe IAV infection is characterized by multi-organ failure and systemic inflammatory response syndrome, also known as a \"cytokine storm\" 25,26 .

Next, indirubin derivatives were found to suppress H9N2-induced IP-10 ( Fig. 3A) , RANTES (Fig. 3B ) and IL-6 ( Fig. 3C ) expression in a concentration-related manner.

Both indirubin derivatives slightly induced and inhibited the basal level of RANTES and IL-6 respectively. It may be due to the regulatory effects of indirubins on innate immunity 45 . For 46 . Similar to the results of direct virus infection, viral RNA stimulated cytokines expressions, and the inhibitory effects of MAPKs inhibitors were very similar to the experiments in direct infection. This confirmed that the suppression effects of MAPKs inhibitors on cytokines expression were not due to their potential effects on viral load. As a result, the anti-inflammatory effects of indirubin derivatives are mainly due to its inhibitory effects on different kinases.",

Endothelial cells in the pulmonary vasculature form a barrier between the blood and interstitium. This strategic position suggests that pulmonary endothelial cells are prone to be affected by the cytokines and viral particles released from the IAV-infected epithelial cells. A recent study by Teijaro et al. identified endothelial cells as the central orchestrator which contribute to the aberrant pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production during early IAV infections 22 . Concomitant with our in vitro data, we showed that H9N2 virus can efficiently infect HPMECs (Fig. 4A,B) and induce a significant amount of IP-10, RANTEs, IL-6, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 1. IP-10 and RANTES are the chemoattractants for leukocytes including T cells, NK cells, and granulocytes, while production of IL-6 by endothelial cells initiates infiltration of neutrophils in the early phase of infection 47 . These cytokines have been found histopathologically in the lungs (including epithelial and endothelial cells) of H5N1 infected patients, who showed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 48 , and ARDS can be characterized by progressive pulmonary endothelial damage. It has been suggested that treatment with antibodies against IP-10 in H1N1 infected mice can improve the survival rate and reduce acute lung injury 49 . Furthermore, suppression of early innate cytokine and chemokine production in the pulmonary endothelium can significantly improve survival of mice infected with lethal H1N1 Swine IAV 22 . These studies suggested that inhibition of cytokines production of the pulmonary endothelium is an attractive therapeutic strategy against IAV-induced cytokine storm.",

In this study, we demonstrated the immunomodulatory effects of indirubin derivatives, particularly E804 on IAV-infected pulmonary endothelial cells. Over the past two decades, many studies have identified that indirubin derivatives are potent inhibitors of various kinases, including MAPKs 35,36 , Src kinase 37 , glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2 ) 50 and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 51 . Based on these findings, potential functions of indirubin derivatives have been proposed, including anti-inflammation 35, [40] [41] [42] , anti-leukemia 36 , antiviral 38, 39 and angiosuppression 52, 53 . Crystal structure analysis revealed that indirubin can form three hydrogen bonds with the ATP-binding pocket of CDKs, thereby competitively inhibiting ATP binding in the catalytic domain of CDKs 36 . The results from our in vitro kinase assay also demonstrated that E804 is a potent inhibitor of p38 and JNK (Fig. 7C,D) . The cytokine ELISA data also suggest that H9N2-induced IP-10 expression of HPMECs was dependent on p38 and JNK activation, while RANTES and IL-6 were controlled by JNK and p38, respectively ( Fig. 5A-C) . However, the Western blot analysis showed that E804 could also inhibit phosphorylation of p38 (Fig. 7A) and JNK (Fig. 7B) , which mean upstream kinases of p38 and JNK may also be inhibited by E804. MAPKs are important mediators of influenza-induced cytokine expression. In fact, p38 has been shown to regulate the stability of IL-6 mRNA 54 . Meanwhile, another study also indicated the critical function of p38 on IP-10 during viral infection 55 . Furthermore, inhibition of p38 by specific inhibitor SB202190 in vivo can greatly diminish H5N1 lethal infection 28 . However, the role of JNK in IAV infection has not been fully examined. Nacken et al. elucidated that influenza viral RNA induces JNK phosphorylation in an RIG-I dependent manner, but the NS1 of IAV has also an intrinsic JNK activating property 56 . Taken together, the potent inhibitory effect of p38 and JNK signaling pathways by E804 strongly correlates with its anti-inflammatory function.",

            "text": "IFNs are pro-inflammatory cytokines crucial for antiviral responses to IAV infection. STAT1 and STAT2 are predominant and essential transcription factors of type I and II interferons signaling pathway, but the role of STAT3 activation after IFN binding remains controversial. Undeniably, STAT3 is indispensable for downstream signaling pathway of many other cytokines like IL-6, VEGF or EGF 57 . Our data showed that H9N2 infection on HPMECs can significantly induce IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 1 expression. Interestingly, STAT3-specific siRNA has no effect on H9N2-induced IL-6 ( Fig. 5F ) and IFN-\u03b3 1 (Fig. 8B ), but strongly inhibit IFN-\u03b2 expression level, indicating the involvement of STAT3 in IFN-\u03b2 induction. The Western blot data showed that IAV-infection could activate STAT3 in early stage (15 min after addition of virus) followed by another activation at 2 h.p.i. (Fig. 6) . H9N2 was found to upregulate TLR-8 and MyD88, which is critical to the induction of IFN-\u03b2 58 . In line with this finding, the early activation of STAT3 may function together with the downstream signaling molecules of TLR-8, possibly the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), to induce rapid expression of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA at 2 h.p.i. (Fig. 1H) . And then the autocrine effect of IFN-\u03b2 induces a further amplification of IFN-\u03b2 expression and result in a cytokine storm. A previous study suggested that E804 could inhibit STAT3 dimerization and subsequent DNA binding 37 . Our translocation experiments clearly indicated that E804 could inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Since the induction of many pro-inflammatory cytokines requires type I interferon signaling, inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 production by E804 may blunt the early induction of these cytokines. Though IFN-\u03b2 is a well-known antiviral cytokine, it is also involved in the pathogenesis of influenza infection. In vivo studies focusing on the S1P 1 receptor and p38 pathway also suggested that, even the IAV-induced IFNs were suppressed by an S1P 1 receptor agonist 22 or p38 inhibitor 28 , the survival rate of the infected mice could still be significantly improved if those strongly induced cytokines were suppressed. In many studies, increased viral load were concomitant of reduced interferons expressions. However, in the present study, viral titer did not further increased in indirubin derivatives treated cells (Fig. 4B ) even IFN\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 1 were suppressed, the results indicated that suppression of cytokines produced by the infected pulmonary endothelium could reduce IAV pathogenicity independent of the viral clearance. In fact, many kinases including CDK 39 and MAPKs, which are suggested being involved in the influenza replication process are also the target of indirubin derivatives, this might explain the partial antiviral effect of indirubin derivatives in this model. Meanwhile the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3 leaded to induction of IFN-\u03b2 . Indirubin derivatives particularly E804 is a potent inhibitor of p38 and JNK signaling pathways. E804 could also reduce the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3. By inhibition of these signaling pathways, E804 could significantly suppress H9N2-induced cytokine burst in HPMECs.",

The encouraging results from in vitro and pre-clinical studies have led to an increased interest on this topic. However, to achieve the best clinical outcome, antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs should be administrated at the appropriate time during an infection. Further understanding of the immune dynamic could allow us to design an optimum therapy strategy. In this report, we demonstrated for the first time, the potent immunomodulatory effects of indirubin derivatives on pulmonary endothelial cells and their therapeutic potential for IAV-infection (Fig. 9) . As a result, the combinational effects of indirubin derivatives and antiviral drug in animal model warrant further investigation.",

However, both indirubin derivatives cannot reduce the virus titer in H9N2-infected HPMECs.H9N2-induced IP-10, RANTES and IL-6 expressions are mediated through MAPKs. To investigate the signaling pathways that mediate the induction of cytokines production during H9N2 infection in HPMECs, cells were treated with MAPKs specific chemical inhibitors after H9N2 infection, or transfected with STAT3-specific siRNA before H9N2 infection. The ELISA results showed that JNK inhibitor SP600125 partially inhibited H9N2-induced IP-10 (Fig. 5A)and RANTES(Fig. 5B) production. Also, the p38 inhibitor SB203580 could significantly suppress the production of IL-6 (Fig. 5C) and showed partial inhibition on IP-10 (Fig. 5A) expression induced by H9N2.

(A,B) HPMECs transfected with non-targeting siRNA (50 nM) or STAT3 specific siRNA (50 nM) were infected with H9N2 at 2 MOI for 1 h, and further incubated for 24 h.p.i. The mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 1 were quantified by real-time RT-PCR. (C) HPMECs were infected with H9N2 at 2 MOI followed by treatment with indirubin derivatives E804 or E231 (1 \u03bc M). Total cell lysates were harvested at 2 h.p.i. Phosphorylation and total STAT3 were detected by Western blot analysis with specific antibodies. (D) Subcellular fractionation was performed 2 h post infection. Western blot analysis was performed to determine the translocation of STAT3 from cytoplasm to nucleus. The GAPDH and Lamin A/C denoting the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions respectively.
