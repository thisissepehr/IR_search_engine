Intestinal structural changes, enterocyte proliferation, enterocyte apoptosis, and mucosal expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) were determined 24 h after the last LPS injection. LPS-INS animals showed a significantly greater bowel and mucosal weight in jejunum and ileum, mucosal DNA and protein in jejunum and ileum, villus height in ileum, crypt depth in jejunum and ileum, cell proliferation rates in jejunum, and significantly lower apoptotic index in ileum compared to LPSanimals.

A fact that insulin is present in human milk and that breast milk stimulates maturation and proliferation of intestinal mucosa, led to the hypothesis that insulin might have a trophic gut effect [9] . Shulman et al. [10] have demonstrated that administration of oral insulin causes an increase in ileal mass and disaccharidase activity in the newborn miniature pig without apparent concomitant changes in serum glucose, insulin, or cortisol levels. In another experiment, the same authors observed an increase in ileal lactase activity following oral insulin administration in the newborn miniature pig [11] . In a recent clinical trial, these authors has shown that enteral administration of insulin to preterm infants (26-29 weeks of gestational age) leads to a higher lactase activity and less feeding intolerance [14] . Buts et al. [15] analyzed the distribution, ontogeny, and molecular properties of insulin receptors in immature and mature enterocytes using radioligand binding assays. They have shown that 125Iinsulin binding to the insulin receptor was five times higher in crypt cells than in villus cells and two times higher in the ileum than in the jejunum. These authors concluded that increased responsiveness of rat immature enterocytes to insulin could be related to high membrane concentrations of insulin receptor and that normal rat enterocytes express a 60-kDa phosphotyrosine protein identified as a direct substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. In another study, these researchers have demonstrated that insulin activates the brush border membrane hydrolases in rat immature intestine by binding the hormone to its intestinal receptor and indirect triggering of the transcription of hydrolases genes and possibly by changes in intracellular polyamine concentrations [16] . We have recently shown that oral insulin supplementation exerts intestinal trophic effects, as well as systemic effects in rats when administered up to 6 weeks beyond the suckling period [17] . Since insulin has trophic gut effects, we hypothesized that insulin may have a beneficial effect on gut growth and recovery in different gastrointestinal disorders. We have recently demonstrated that oral insulin exerts a strong stimulating effect on bowel re-growth following massive small bowel resection in a rat [18] .

Increased bowel and mucosal weight as well as mucosal DNA and protein support this conclusion. Parallel increases in mucosal DNA and protein indicate that the greater mucosal mass of animals treated with oral insulin can be attributed to cellular hyperplasia. Because the DNA content is directly proportional to mucosal cell number, these measurements exclude such factors as edema or vascular engorgement as responsible for differences in mucosal mass.

This may be explained by the presence of bacteria in the ileum that may lead to a temporary insensitivity of cells toward subsequent LPS and insulin stimulation.
