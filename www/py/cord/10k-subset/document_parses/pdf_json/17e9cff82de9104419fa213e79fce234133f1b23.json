Based on this 36 amino acid peptide template (termed I 1 ), a series of shorter peptides was designed and synthesized (Table 1) (Fig, 1) . The first step in optimization was to shorten the 36 amino acid peptide from both the N-and C-terminals. The resulting peptide, termed I 2 , with 14 amino acid residues exhibited a 10-fold lower inhibitory activity than I 1 . To improve the potency of I 2 , the second step introduced the consensus substrate recognition sequence of furin into the reactive site. Furin recognizes a specific RXRAKR\u2193 site. The peptide I 3 was then designed by replacing the P 2 residue with Lys and P 1 , P 4 and P 6 residues with Arg. These replacements led to a decrease in the K i value of I 3 by approximately 5.8\u00d710 \u22128 M, suggesting that the consensus substrate sequence of furin is essential for the inhibitor. When two alanine residues at the P 1 ' and P 2 ' positions of I 3 were replaced with Asp (P 1 ') and Leu (P 2 '), respectively, to achieve I 4 , the K i value for furin further decreased three-fold, indicating that a negatively charged residue at the P 1 ' site is favorable. Though the 14 amino acid peptides I 3 and I 4 have appropriate inhibitory activities, their relatively large sizes restrain their application. The third step was to remove the N-terminal Thr-Lys-Lys-Val and C-terminal Ala residues flanking the reactive site of the inhibitor I 3 to obtain I 5 . The truncation at both termini had no apparent impact on the inhibitory activity of I 5 , resulting in a nonapeptide inhibitor with a K i value of 2.7\u00d710 \u22128 M. To protect the peptides from possible in vivo degradation by exopeptidase, three cyclic peptide inhibitors with 10, 12 and 14 amino acid residues were also synthesized in the thioester formation, between the N-terminal cysteine and the Cterminal Leu. Unexpectedly, the inhibitory potencies of the peptides I 6 , I 7 and I 8 decreased by 160, 35 and 5 folds, respectively, compared to I 4 ( Table 2 ). Stability assays were carried out to measure the stability of the inhibitors over several hours. To measure the stability of these inhibitors, the IC 50 concentrations of the inhibitors were used based on their K i values. The substrate concentration for the stability assay was 1.0 \u00b5M. Enzymes incubated without inhibitors were used as a control to confirm that furin activity would not change during incubation in buffer at 37 \u00baC. The initial inhibitory activity of each inhibitor was marked as 100%; their inhibitory activities at indicated time points were then compared with initial activity and normalized as percentage values. Inhibitory activities were measured three times. When the synthesized peptides (I 1 \u2212I 8 ) were incubated with furin for an indicated time, their inhibitory activities gradually decreased in a time-dependent manner, with the exception of I 5 . The most stable inhibitor, I 5 , retained 100% potency against furin, even after a 3 h incubation period. In contrast, the inhibitor I 6 was the least stable with a 50% activity loss during the same time period. Among inhibitors I 2 , I 3 and I 4 , the activity of the one with the highest inhibitory activity (K i -I 4 <K i -I 3 <K i -I 2 ) decayed the fastest. I 4 is five amino acids longer than I 5 ; however, I 5 is more stable than I 4 . Compared with I 4 , the cyclic peptides I 6 and I 8 lost their potencies much more quickly, suggesting that the cyclization of peptide is not helpful in the optimization of a furin inhibitor (Fig. 2) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 254, "end": 258, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 389, "end": 397, "text": "(Fig, 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2220, "end": 2227, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 3744, "end": 3752, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Optimization of inhibitor"}, {"text": "To confirm the stability analysis results further, HPLC was also used to measure stability.

Until now, proteinase inhibitor 8 and histone H1.2 have been reported as naturally synthesized possible inhibitors of furin in mammals [23, 35] . The C-terminal fragment of histone H1.2 was found to be more potent than full-length histone H1.2, with a K i value of 310 nM against furin. This C-terminal fragment of histone H1.2 has many advantages over other furin inhibitors; for example, its small size and lack of a disulfide bond means it is easily synthesized and purified. However, modifications are needed to promote its potency and stability before it can be applied therapeutically.

Studies of furin inhibitors have shown that peptides comprised of positively charged residues are better furin inhibitors [13, 41] . There are three pockets in the substrate binding sites of furin [4, 42] : S 1 , S 2 and S 4 . In general, the S 1 pocket of furin needs Arg in the P 1 site of the substrate/inhibitor, the S 2 pocket interacts with Lys in the P 2 site, and the S 4 pocket favorably interacts with Arg in the P 4 site. As furin does not have an S 3 pocket, the P 3 site of the substrate/inhibitor is optional; thus, a favorable substrate of furin would have the conserved RAKR\u2193 sequence. Furin also has another secondary pocket in the substrate binding sites, the S 6 pocket. It can interact with Arg in the P6 site of the substrate/inhibitor. Our previous study showed that only one site cleaved by furin exists in the C-terminal of histone H1.2 (K175\u2212K178) [35] . Based on this cleavage site, I 1 with 36 amino acids was designed and found to be a potent furin inhibitor, with a K i value of 5.1\u00d710 \u22127 M. To shorten the original I 1 peptide, the 14 amino acid peptide inhibitor I 2 was then designed by removing the N-and C-terminal residues flanking the reactive site of I 1 ; the inhibitory activity of I 2 was thus reduced almost 10-fold. In order to increase inhibitory potency, we further designed I 3 and I 4 based on the optimal cleavage site (RXRAKR\u2193 DL). The mutations at the reactive site markedly increased the inhibitory activities of I 3 and I 4 , indicating that the consensus substrate sequence of furin is preferable to achieve high inhibitory activity. At the same time, substitution with Asp and Leu at the P 1 ' and P 2 ' positions may also increase inhibitory activity three-fold ( Table 2) . By docking the nonapeptide (RERRRKKRG) with furin [43] , the S 1 , S 2 , S 4 and S 6 pockets are at one side.
