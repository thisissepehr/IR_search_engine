Methods This prospective cohort study was conducted on patients admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of a tertiary care institute of North India, from June 2012 through March 2014, who received mechanical ventilation for more than 24 h. All enrolled children were assessed daily for development of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) using the case definition given by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Chest radiograph and microbiologic samplings were performed in children suspected to have VAP. Risk factors associated with VAP were calculated by doing bivariate and multivariate analysis. Results A total of 128 patients were screened and 86 were enrolled (median age 30 mo 95% CI 4.0-84.0; 72% boys). The most common admitting diagnosis was sepsis (16%) followed by acyanotic congenital heart disease with pneumonia (14%) and the most common indication for ventilation was respiratory failure (45.3%). The incidence of VAP according to CDC criteria was 38.4%, while the incidence of microbiologically confirmed VAP was 24.4%. The incidence of ventilator associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) was found to be 11.6%. Acinetobacter was the most frequently isolated organism (47%) followed by Pseudomonas (28%), Klebsiella (15%), E. coli (5%) and Enterobacter (5%). Risk factors for VAP on bivariate analysis were use of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (p = 0.027, OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.1-24.3), enteral feeding (p < 0.001, OR 6.5, 95% CI 2.1-19.4) and re-intubation (p = 0.024, OR 3.3 and 95% CI 1.1-9.6). On multivariate analysis, use of PPI (p = 0.03, OR 8.47, 95% CI 1.19-60.33) and enteral feeding (p < 0.001, OR 12.2, 95% CI 2.58-57.78) were identified as independent risk factors for VAP. Conclusions Ventilator associated pneumonia is an important complication in children receiving mechanical ventilation in PICU and Gram negative bacilli (Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas) being the important causative agents.

Despite improvements in aseptic techniques, antibiotic therapy, and supportive care, VAP continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality of ICU patients. The incidence continues to be high in spite of improved understanding of the risk factors of VAP. There is no consensus on the preventive strategies akin to adults, in form of bundle approach in children. In 2004, the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) system of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a mean VAP rate of 2.9 per 1000 ventilator days for participating PICUs in the United States [1] , while pediatric studies across the globe report an incidence of 2-17% [2] [3] [4] [5] . There are very few studies from developing countries including India reporting the incidence of VAP in chidren. One study from North India reported incidence of VAP to be between 17 and 30% [6] . The risk factors for VAP in infants and children vary somewhat from those in adults. Inoculation of the formerly sterile lower respiratory tract typically occurs from aspiration of secretions, colonization of the aero-digestive tract, use of contaminated equipment, medications, presence of a genetic syndrome, re-intubation, enteral feeding, transport out of the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and duration of mechanical ventilation [7] . Common etiological agents causing VAP are Pseudomonas spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and various Gram negative bacilli.

The European Respiratory Society, European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine taskforce suggest a positive culture of respiratory secretions as a mandatory item in the diagnosis of VAT. Though CDC definition for VAT requires only one of the clinical criteria to be fulfilled, the documentation of 11.62% was done in the presence of purulent secretion as a mandatory criteria to avoid confusions in case of ETA being sterile. Hence, this clinical definition could well be adopted for VAT though ETA positivity is useful for making decision about treating VAT. Craven et al. reported the incidence of VAT to be 11% in adults [13] , though they used microbiological confirmation to be mandatory in the diagnosis of ventilator associated tracheobronchitis.
