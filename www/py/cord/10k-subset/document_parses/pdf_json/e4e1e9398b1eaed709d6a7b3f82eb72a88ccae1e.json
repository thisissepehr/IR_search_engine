In order to realistically analyze the spreading mechanism and dynamical behavior of epidemic diseases, in this paper, a generalized disease transmission model of SIS type with agedependent infection and birth and death on a heterogeneous network is discussed. The model allows the infection and recovery rates to vary and depend on the age of infection, the time since an individual becomes infected. We address uniform persistence and find that the model has the sharp threshold property, that is, for the basic reproduction number less than one, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, while for the basic reproduction number is above one, a Lyapunov functional is used to show that the endemic equilibrium is globally stable. Finally, some numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate and complement the main results. The disease dynamics rely not only on the network structure, but also on an age-dependent factor (for some key functions concerned in the model).",

            "text": "Epidemic dynamic models provide a theoretical method for quantitative studies of infectious diseases. Since Kermack and McKendrick proposed SIR and SIS compartmental models to study disease transmission McKendrick 1927, 1932) , epidemic models for the transmission of infectious diseases have been extensively studied. These classical compartmental models are important tools in analyzing the spread and control of infectious diseases, but usually neglect the population structure or assume that all individuals have the same possibility to contact others-they are most effective for well-mixed homogeneous populations with a substantial penetration of infection. However, the spreading of infectious diseases is primarily via specific contacts between individuals, emerging diseases start with a relative small number of infectious, and the possibility to contact others is heterogeneous. Therefore, depicting the spread of disease processes on a contact network can be more realistic (Levin and Durrett 1996; Read and Keeling 2003; Keeling and Eames 2005; Durrett and Jung 2007) . Currently, the most popular transmission models on networks are based on mean-field approximations and follow the framework initially proposed by Vespignani (2001a, b, 2002) . These were the first to study SIS epidemic model on a scale-free network and show that the epidemic threshold is infinitesimal in the limit of a large number of links and nodes. Since then, a great deal of epidemiological research work followed on scale-free (and other) networks (House et al. 2009; Olinky and Stone 2004; Fu et al. 2008; Colizzaa et al. 2006; Wang and Dai 2008) .",

However, the popularly used epidemic models are described by ordinary differential equations, which assume that all individuals within a compartment behave identically, for instance, all infectious individuals are assumed to be equally infectious during their periodic infectivity. Hence, in order to reflect the effect of this demographic behavior, researchers have begun to examine age-structured epidemic models since the pioneering work (Hoppensteadt 1974 (Hoppensteadt , 1975 Elveback et al. 1971) . Elveback et al. (1971) suggested that disease transmission models with age-dependent contact rates are more realistic. Some recent studies in Magal et al. (2010) , Wang et al.

As far as we know, there are few results based on age-structured epidemic models on complex networks. Yang et al. (2016) built and analyzed an SIS epidemic model on complex networks by incorporating both infection age and behavior epidemiology, and then obtained the epidemic dynamics of their model. However, some strong assumptions were used, such as closed populations, i.e., the total number of individuals stay invariant during the whole epidemic duration. Since some diseases can last for an individual's lifetime, the influence of birth and death plays an important role in the disease spreading (Liu et al. 2004; Zhu et al. 2013 ). In Liu et al. (2004) , it was suggested that empty nodes give birth to individuals with certain rate. Later (Zhu et al. 2013 ) proposed a birth event that occurs at a vacant node next to a non-vacant node at constant rate, which also depends on the number of neighboring individuals and connectivity degree. But this demographic factor was not considered in Yang et al. (2016) .",

Our model is appropriate for studying diseases such as malaria, influenza, gonorrhea and childhood diseases, etc., whose spreading processes obviously shows heterogeneity of infectivity in infectious individuals. In general, there are two main approaches to analyze age-structured models by studying the nonlinear semigroup generated by the family of solutions. One approach is to use the theory of integrated semigroups (Magal et al. 2010; Thieme 1990; Magal and McCluskey 2013) . We employ an alternative approach, namely by integrating solutions along the characteristics to obtain an equivalent integro-differential equation, which was utilized by Webb for age-dependent population models (Webb 1985) . Although epidemic models with age structure have been extensively studied, there are still inadequate results on the full global stability. In this paper, our methods of theoretical analysis follow the techniques laid out in the monograph (Smith and Thieme 2011) . We establish uniform persistence of the system and the existence of a compact global attractor in order to make use of the invariance principle. We show the global stability of equilibria by constructing the proper Volterra-type Lyapunov functions which rely on uniform persistence and invariance, and this is different from the method used in Yang et al. (2016) . Hence, our work based on age structure will provide new insight into the study of epidemic spreading dynamics on scale-free networks.",

By using various analytic methods, we demonstrate the asymptotic smoothness of solutions and uniform persistence of the system (1) via analyzing its limiting system (5) with Volterra integral equations. We found that the basic Dynamics of I k (t) subject to time t of system (23). c Dynamics of I (t, \u03c4) subject to time t of system (1), \u03c4 = 5, 10, 20, 50. d Dynamics of I (t, \u03c4) subject to time t of system (23) reproduction number is not only related to the network structure, but also depends on parameters which relate to infection age. In addition, we showed that the disease-free equilibrium in model (5) is globally asymptotically stable if R 0 < 1 by analyzing the corresponding characteristic equations and applying Fatou's Lemma. Meanwhile, if R 0 > 1, the system has a unique endemic equilibrium, which is globally asymptotically stable by constructing proper Volterra-type Lyapunov functions. We performed some simulations under different parameters and \u03d5(k) to illustrate our theoretical results. In addition, we continue to construct an age-infection model (23) according to system (1). We consider different infection rates, recovery rates and diagnosis rates with respect to age of infection based on the background and presumed characteristics of various childhood diseases (in particular HFMD), we found that it is important to treat specific infectious groups according to infection age to most effectively control the overall spread of disease.",

Cholera, for example, has multiple transmission pathways: it can be transmitted directly to humans by person-to-person contact or indirectly to humans via contaminated water. We know that different infectivity is important for indirect and direct transmissions. Many researchers have studied various age-of-infection cholera models, while none of them are constructed on complex networks. Hence, our future work is to study the influence of network structures on an age-of-infection cholera model.",
