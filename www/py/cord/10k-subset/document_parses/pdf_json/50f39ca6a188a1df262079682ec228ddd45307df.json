Methods: A series of CpG ODN with different primary structures were synthesized. Their capabilities to stimulate mouse spleen cell proliferation were determined by [ 3 H]thymidine incorporation assay. Cytokine (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-12, and IFN-\u03b1) secretion spectra induced by CpG ODN were assessed by ELISA. The ability of CpG ODN to activate natural killer cells was evaluated by standard 4 h 51 Cr-release assay. Flow cytometry was utilized to examine the expressions of various lymphocyte surface molecules on diverse immunocytes. An effective CpG ODN for murine, ODN1826, was set as the template of modification and the positive control. Results: The immunostimulatory activities of CpG ODN with different sequences and compositions varied markedly, both in character and in extent. It was useless for improving the immunostimulatory activity of ODN1826 by simply increasing the functional hexameric CpG motif number, modifying the site of CpG motifs, or changing the distance between multi-CpG motifs. However, an addition of a selfcomplementary palindrome structure at the 3'-end, but not the 5'-end of CpG ODN, aroused marked improvement in its activity. Several designed ODN had superior comprehensive immunostimulatory properties compared to ODN1826. Conclusion: The immunostimulatory activity of a CpG ODN was relevant to its primary structure.

The cells are activated upon recognition of PAMP and trigger the generation of optimal adaptive immune responses. The bacterial genome, compared to vertebrate DNA, contains a higher frequency of unmethylated deoxycytidyl-deoxyguanosine (CpG) dinucleotides. Small oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) with unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (CpG ODN) are able to perfectly mimic the immunostimulatory activity of bDNA [1, 2] . CpG ODN are known to stimulate innate and adaptive immunity because of their interesting immunostimulatory properties in a number of vertebrate, such as stimulating B-cell proliferation [3] [4] [5] , enhancing the expression and synthesis of cytokines [6] , and promoting natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity [7] . Multiple studies have shown that CpG ODN-induced activation is presumably a 2-step process. First, CpG ODN, independent of their sequence, are recognized by different receptors [1, 2, [8] [9] [10] ; Mac-1 surface immunoglobulins and scavenger receptors are possibly involved in this process. The cellular uptake of ODN is sequence independent, but can be influenced dramatically by backbone modifications. Phosphorothioated modifications can enhance cellular uptake and increase immunostimulatory activity and half-time of CpG ODN [9, 11] . In addition, runs of at least 4 guanosines have been reported to enhance the cellular uptake of ODN due to the fact that base-quartet-stabilized, 4-stranded helices called tetraplexes are formed [10, 12] . Second, CpG ODN trigger the motif-dependent recognition of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) within the endosome and initiate immunocellular activation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 99, "end": 105, "text": "[PAMP]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 585, "end": 588, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 589, "end": 591, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 780, "end": 783, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 784, "end": 787, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 788, "end": 791, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 846, "end": 849, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 904, "end": 907, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1087, "end": 1090, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1091, "end": 1093, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1094, "end": 1097, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1101, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1102, "end": 1106, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1441, "end": 1444, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1445, "end": 1448, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1646, "end": 1650, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1651, "end": 1654, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Immunostimulatory activities of CpG ODN depend on their structural and chemical characteristics. A number of researchers have studied the relationship between the CpG ODN structure and their immunostimulatory properties. CpG ODN were structurally and functionally divided into 3 types in previous studies for humans: A type (also known as D type), B type (also known as K type), and C type. A-type CpG ODN is capable of activating human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) to produce large amounts of type I IFN (\u03b1/\u03b2) and strongly activates NK cells. It has mixed phosphodiester/phosphorothioate backbones and contains a single hexameric purine/pyrimidine/CG/purine/pyrimidine motif flanked by self-complementary bases that form a stem-loop structure capped at the 3'-end by a poly G tail [13] . B-type CpG ODN primarily activates B cells, resulting in their proliferation and antibody secretion. It has phosphorothioate backbones and encodes multiple TCGTT and/or TCGTA motifs [13, 14] . C-type CpG ODN optimally consist of a stimulatory hexameric CpG motif (5'-TCGTCGTT-3') linked by a T spacer to GC-rich palindromic sequences (5'-CGGCGCGCG-CCG-3') [15] . The C-type CpG ODN very strongly stimulates B cells as well as type I IFN secretion in vitro in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In vivo, it is a strong, Th1inducing adjuvant. In addition, another C-type CpG ODN is reported to display a B-type CpG ODN structure feature at the 5'-end and A-type CpG ODN structure feature at the 3'end and shares the activities of both A-and B-type CpG ODN [16] .

The 5'-end palindrome destroyed the free end; this may have been responsible for the lost of the immunostimulatory activity of ODN3 and ODN12.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 74, "end": 78, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 179, "end": 182, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 183, "end": 186, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 187, "end": 190, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 641, "end": 645, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "However, ODN10, one of the most potent ODN involved in our study, possessed a holistic, self-complementary palindrome structure (5'-TCCATGACGTTTTAAAACGTCA-TGGA-3'). In theory, the sequence would form a large hairpin structure, so it was hard to keep a single chain 5'-end. Despite this, the comprehensive immunostimulatory activity of ODN10 was distinguished. Furthermore, in another study, a cyclic CpG ODN without any free ends had potent immunostimulatory efficiency (data not shown). This result challenged the hypothesis that the free 5'-end was essential for retaining the immunostimulatory activity for a CpG ODN. Undoubtedly, more investigations still needed to be carried out in order to elucidate this.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The analysis of cytokine secretion is a traditional method for the SAR of CpG ODN. Generally, a certain cytokine can be secreted by several immune cells, for example IFN-\u03b1 secretion by pDC or cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, so we could not identify which cells were influenced by CpG ODN. Thus, the more efficient and accurate method of flow cytometry was used as a powerful tool in the study for the determination of the cell-specific activation of ODN. As we known, CD19 was the characteristic surface marker of B cells, and the activation of B cell was characterized by the upregulation of cell-surface molecules, such as costimulatory molecules CD80. CD11c was the characteristic surface marker of pDC, and one of the mature markers of pDC was the upregulation of Ia b expression on pDC. The results showed that both B-class CpG ODN and C-class CpG ODN could upregulate the level of CD80 expression on CD19-positive cells. C-class CpG ODN induced a much higher level of Ia b expression on CD11c-positive cells than B-class CpG ODN. The CD94 expression on NK cells was similar to the Ia b expression on pDC. The results obtained via flow cytometry and cytokine analysis were consistent.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "All of the cellular immune effects of CpG ODN in murine were believed to result directly and indirectly from activating TLR-9-expressing pDC and B cells [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Nevertheless, B cell and pDC activation seemed to need different structure characteristics [28, 29] . An explanation for this is that pDC activation was associated with ODN that can form secondary structures, such as the dimeric C-class and the multimeric A-class. These higher-ordered structures might induce TLR-9 cross-linking, promote the recruitment of one or more additional cofactors or adaptor proteins into the TLR-9-signalling complex, and/or alter the intracellular compartmentalization of the ODN [30, 31] . Thus, the relationship between the primary and higher-level structure of CpG ODN and its accessibility, recognition, and combination with TLR-9 still need further study.", "cite_spans": [{"start":
