An actual hospitalization room was the investigate case study. Transient simulations with computational fluid dynamics (CFD), based on the finite element method (FEM) were performed to investigate the efficiency of the existing heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) plant with a variable air volume (VAV) primary air system. Solid modelling of the room, taking into account thermo-physical properties of building materials, architectural features (e.g., window and wall orientation) and furnishing (e.g., beds, tables and lamps) arrangement of the room, inlet turbulence high induction air diffuser, the return air diffusers and two patients lying on two parallel beds was carried out. Multiphysics modelling was used: a thermo-fluidynamic model (convection-conduction and incompressible Navier-Stokes) was combined with a convectiondiffusion model. Three 3D models were elaborated considering different conditions/events of the patients (i.e., the first was considered coughing and/or the second breathing). A particle tracing and diffusion model, connected to cough events, was developed to simulate the dispersal of bacteria-carrying droplets in the isolation room equipped with the existing ventilation system. An analysis of the region of droplet fallout and the dilution time of bacteria diffusion of coughed gas in the isolation room was performed. The analysis of transient simulation results concerning particle path and distance, and then particle tracing combined with their concentration, provided evidence of the formation of zones that should be checked by microclimatic and contaminant control.

Design of air ventilation systems has been greatly assisted by computer simulations based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling (Chow and Yang 2003) . CFD can predict air velocities, temperatures and contaminant concentrations throughout the room for a range of plant design changes. This information has been interpreted in terms of indoor air quality indices, and then compared against health criteria and also thermal comfort indices to assess patient comfort (Rygielsky and Uden 2007; Walker et al. 2007; Soper 2008; Tunga et al. 2009 ). CFD modelling provides useful indications on the supply diffuser locations and types, flow and ventilation rates, exhaust air vent locations, air filter efficiency, distribution of heat loads in the room, arrangement of furniture, and other obstacles to air movement (Jiang et al. 2009; Qian et al. 2010) . The work of Jiang et al. (2009) is crucial to derive useful suggestions on the minimum ventilation rate, corresponding to the dilution level for preventing airborne infection.

(2003) providing basic support for CFD simulations for studying the ventilation system performances for isolation rooms. The airflow patterns in isolation rooms are governed by the positions, configurations and specified velocities/pressures of the air-supply and exhaust vents of the ventilation system.

Memarzadeh and Manning (2002) used computational fluid dynamics analysis to show that when the design is appropriate, laminar flow conditions are the best choice among a large comparison of flows and ventilation systems in order to control the risk of contaminant deposition in an operating room surgical site. They found that a low velocity (25 to 35 fpm), vertically directed, unidirectional downward airflow over the operation room table with return air (exhaust) ducts at various heights achieved optimal removal of airborne particulates (Memarzadeh and Manning 2002) . Comparison of performances (number of airborne particles, microbial contamination, kinetics of decontamination, rate of mixing and an index of functionality) of three types of airflow systems: laminar (unidirectional) flow, stabilised flow and turbulent flow, in the operating theatre in a French hospital, has shown that during operations, the laminar flow is the single airflow system to reach the class B10 (Talon et al. 2006) . In a recent study, Brandt et al. (2008) analysed 55 hospitals in Germany and concluded there may be little benefit from vertical laminar airflow (LAF) for preventing surgical site infections in surgical procedures. Both the authors and many researchers have pointed that, although with conspicuous statistics, this was not a randomised, controlled, blind study.

The present study is inspired by widespread awareness the importance of HVAC systems in resource allocation on the frontlines of public health preparedness (Soper 2008; Tang et al. 2006) and response to infectious disease. Transient simulations, applied to a three-dimensional model of the room, considering most typical positions of two patients, investigated the airflow patterns associated with different cough conditions, in order to develop an understanding of the effects of these arrangements on the regions of droplet fallout. To study particles and/or control of virus dispersion in the isolation room, the door at first was considered closed, as often as practical so that the airflow can be kept stable, then in the last simulation it was considered open. For this study, results obtained in a recent work (Balocco and Li\u00f2 2011) were used, improving fluid-dynamic, thermal and diffusion modelling. The numerical simulations were performed to analyse diffusion of particles that emitted from a patient entering the breathing zone or reaching the body surface of another patient. For this reason a particle tracing and diffusion model, connected to cough events, was also defined. Transient simulations of the patients coughing conditions were performed over 60 seconds.

The main attention of these papers has been the evaluation of the effects of supply and return air diffuser location and negative pressure in isolation rooms for patients with highly infectious diseases (Tunga et al. 2009; Walker et al. 2007 ). The HVAC design is fundamental to maintain negative pressure within isolation rooms and to protect health of workers, patients and visitors. This is also necessary to control patient risk from airborne diseases (Rygielski and Uden 2007) . Door opening causes the dispersion of air out of the isolation room. An isolation room held at negative pressure to reduce aerosol escape and a high air-change rate to allow rapid removal of aerosols can eliminate transmission of infectious aerosols to those outside the room. Tunga et al. (2009) found that an air velocity above 0.2 m/s via a doorway effectively prevents the spread of airborne contaminants out of the isolation room with an open door (M\u00e9ndez et al. 2008; Rygielski and Uden 2007) . Techniques such as aerosol particle tracer sampling and computational fluid dynamics can be applied to study the performance of ventilation systems during coughing episodes.

The coughing events that cause droplet transmission have been modelled in several sophisticated ways (Cunningham 1910; Yu and Diu 1983; Marianne et al. 1987; Batchelor 2000; Tellier 2006 ) but they were not incorporated in a CFD intensive simulation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 641, "end": 658, "text": "(Cunningham 1910;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 659, "end": 675, "text": "Yu and Diu 1983;", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 676, "end": 697, "text": "Marianne et al. 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 698, "end": 713, "text": "Batchelor 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 714, "end": 726, "text": "Tellier 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Particle tracing and diffusion model"}, {"text": "Several studies show that a close cough is unlikely to cause infection, whereas a close, unprotected, horizontally directed sneeze may be potent enough to cause droplet transmission (Yu and Diu 1983; Marianne et al. 1987; Tellier 2006; Stanley et al. 2008 ). Referring to the literature (Diekmann and Heesterbeek 2000; Tang et al. 2006; Walker et al. 2007 ) large droplets were considered with a diameter larger than 60 \u03bcm, small ones, if the diameter is less than 60 \u03bcm, and nucleus droplets when less than 10 \u03bcm. Therefore, coughing and sneezing produce droplets in a size range from less than 1 to up to 2000 \u03bcm. In the present study particles of 10 \u03bcm, which are contagious at to 2 meters distance, were considered. Particles with this dimension remain in the air up to 491 seconds when performing a trajectory of 1.5 m as reported by Yu and Diu (1983) and Diekmann and Heesterbeek (2000) . Particles larger than 50 \u03bcm have a remarkably lower permanence in the air and are rarely inhaled by the patients. Moreover, particles of the size of 1.0 \u03bcm evaporate very quickly (Marianne et al. 1987; Diekmann and Heesterbeek 2000; Tellier 2006 ). The Cunningham Slip Correction (C c ) which is a correction to the drag coefficient, used to predict the drag force between a fluid and a particle moving through this fluid (Cunningham 1910; Marianne et al. 1987; Tellier 2006) was used in the proposed model. When the particle diameters become small (less than 10 \u03bcm in the air) the fluid can no longer be considered continuous: the drag coefficient on each particle must be divided by the Cunningham correction factor. The correction factor is greater than 1, which means that the effective particle drag coefficient goes down.

These conditions generate a reduction of the Cunningham factor, towards its lower boundary, which is 1. Therefore in all the simulations a value of Cunningham factor, equal to 1, was used.

This means that large convective vortices may occur, within which an airflow of a \"laminar type\" is still present, because it is connected to the fluid layers slipping. As a matter of fact, one of the most important simulation issues is the use of turbulent versus laminar flow modelling approaches. High velocity vertical laminar airflow (LAF) (90 to 400 feet per minute, or fpm) has been typical and used in many hospitals for decades in the US, UK, and Europe.

COMSOL Multhiphysics code was used (COMSOL 2009). See (Verdier 2004; van Schijndel 2009 ) for a comparison of COMSOL with respect to other currently used CFD software. The transient simulations with thermal and fluid-dynamic coupled models were preceded by a long enough run without cough/sneeze events. The sneeze and/or cough events were considered at the beginning of the transient simulation. Then for all the transient simulations, considering the \"supine position\" three events (coughing and/or breathing) were investigated: the first event (model_1) concerns the first patient coughing three times when the second is breathing; the second event (model_2) concerns the first patient coughing three times when immediately after the second coughs twice, the third (model_3) concerns both patients coughing, at the same time, three times. For all these models the door was kept closed, so that particle diffusion would be influenced by ventilation airflow patterns alone. The \"impulse\" functions (volumetric and mass flow due to coughing) for the simulation of coughing events were repeated over time, with a time interval as \"peak-to-peak\" equal to 2 seconds. In model_2, the time phase displacement between coughing events of the two patients was taken as 6 seconds. These conditions remain throughout the entire simulation of 60 seconds when the ventilation system operating and the coughing/breathing events happen. Each simulation considers the results of both the ventilation system in standard operating conditions and the effect of the coughing/breathing events. They were performed with a long enough run (60 seconds) for the cough/sneeze events combined with the stationary model of ventilation considering a single and/or repeated sneeze and/or cough event at the beginning of the simulation, with an inlet velocity at the initial instant due to the cough of 28 m/s, which is the maximum experimentally determined connected to the transient flow due to the impulse that has a length of about one second (Phillips et al. 2004 ). The inlet/outlet breathe velocity was considered constant 0.9 m/s. Thermal boundary conditions due to sensible and latent heat released by the head surface of the two patients, sensible heat of the two bed-headboard lamps and safety lamps on the ceiling, and then thermal conditions of the external opaque wall and the French-window were taken into account. The thermal conditions that are strictly connected to the indoor airflow displacement and buoyancy thermal effects, in particular due to the plant system solution (the HVAC-VAV plant combined with radiant panel in the ceiling) and variation of temperature and heat flows related to climatic stresses and external building thermo-physics, were taken into account. The (full) input data, sub-domains settings, boundary conditions and basic equations used for all the time dependent simulations, combining the Incompressible Navier-Stokes, Convection-Conduction (Appendix Eq. (A1)) and Convection-Diffusion models (Appendix Eq. (A2)) on the non-isothermal airflow (Appendix Eq. (A3)), are provided in the Appendix. For indoor climatic conditions, a uniform internal air temperature of 22\u2103 and 50% of relative humidity were assumed, as provided by the plant and suggested (UNI 10339 1995; ASHRAE 1995; UNI EN 13779 2005) . External climatic data were set at the external design conditions of 0\u2103 air temperature and 85% relative humidity. The simulations started with the Incompressible Navier-Stokes application mode, under laminar flow conditions and then the turbulence k-\u03b5 model was activated. The software automatically reformulates the equations with the exception that additional boundary conditions for the turbulence model needed to be specified: e.g., the eddy viscosity automatically replaces the molecular viscosity (Batchelor 2000; COMSOL 2009 ). Simulation results were used to calculate the mean air velocity value of the central inlet air diffuser, that is 1.36 m/s according to the technical data provided by the company. Therefore even with reduced surface diffusion, the airflow is laminar and produces the airflow adherence to the ceiling (it guarantees the \"coanda effect\") and its slow fall down. The airflow modelling based on CFD with FEM, solves the fundamental conservation equations for mass momentum and energy in the form of the Navier-Stokes equations. The airflow modelling without taking into account the coughing events, provided low Reynolds numbers (10 2 \u2212 10 4 ) that suggested using the Incompressible Navier-Stokes model (that uses the Boussinesq approximation) which was combined with Convection-Diffusion and Convection-Conduction models. The Boussinesq approximation is a way to treat some simple cases of buoyant flows without having to use a compressible formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations. This approximation assumes that variations in density have no effect on the flow field, except that they give rise to buoyant forces.

The airflow field is minimally influenced by patients sensible heat transfer and the fact that the temperature difference throughout the room is small. The flow field and velocity distribution induced by the high turbulence air inlet diffuser, combined with the air return diffusers, produce wide recirculation zones near the wall and small partial stagnation areas near the ceiling and between the two beds (Fig. 4) .

It can be found that the position of the two bed-headboard lamps has a remarkable effect on airborne particle dispersion Fig. 6 Temperature field-at 1 m height (a), slice-detail (b) on the wall (c), and the whole room (d) (Fig. 7) . The particle concentrations (point sources were assumed for the present study) in various parts of the room are very sensitive to the location of the particle sources as highlighted by Chow and Yang (2003) . Particle tracing and diffusion suggest that in the room there is a formation of a zone, albeit a limited one, that should be checked by a microclimatic and contaminant control between the two beds and around the ceiling surface. In particular, model_2 and model_3 provide the most critical conditions in the isolation room, due to bio-aerosol concentration: the temporal and spatial dynamics of coughing of the two patients produces an increase in bio-aerosol residual concentration. The analysis of the residual concentration highlights the presence of important levels of bio-aerosol in the vicinity of the upper zone of the two beds, of the wall adjacent to them and the surfaces of the bed-headboard lamps. Bio-aerosol concentration, over 10 \u2212 50 seconds, achieves high values and then decreases with time because of the continuous dilution provided by the airflow inlet.
