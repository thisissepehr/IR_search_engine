These results are confirming HoLEP is a valid surgical option for patients with large prostates. There is conflicting evidence on the role of raised inflammatory markers in acute ureteric colic and spontaneous stone passage, particularly in patients managed conservatively and whether White Cell Count (WBC) on admission can predict stone passage. If so, it could be used to guide management in these patients. MIMIC aims to assess whether (WBC) at acute ureteric colic presentation is associated with likelihood of spontaneous stone passage.

Commonly, the ileal conduit is created using a 15-20 cm ileum length. The distal left ureter passage under mesosigmoid previous its extensive dissection, in order to allow a tension-free ureteroileal anastomosis, often leads to a compromised blood supply to the left ureter, resulting in a higher incidence of delayed ischemic damage of the distal ureter, wich is the most common cause of ureteroenteric stricture. In literature, ileoureteral stricture rate reported is 1.7-14%, being more common on the left side. Of some interest is the fact that no significant diferrence is been reported in strictures occurrance rate between Bricker anastomosis type and Wallace type. The strictures resulting from urinary diversion are difficult to treat, have a high risk of recurrence and may lead to renal function deterioration. We presented our results with a modified ileal conduit tecnique (MICT) and left ileoureteral anastomosis aimed to prevent uretero-ileal anastomosis stricture. With innovations in the treatment of DM has increased life expectancy and late complications began to be seen more often. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is one of the important late complications of DM.

The extra-parenchymal portion of cyst wall was dissociated and incised using either a Thulium or Holmium laser, and a pathological examination was performed. Renal calculi were treated simultaneously. For parapelvic cysts patients, laser was used to incise cyst wall towards identified pelvis to create a permanent communication between the cyst and adjacent renal collecting system. F6 double-J stent was inserted into the cyst cavity at the end to prevent auto-closure for at most two months. 22F nephrostomy tube was left in renal pelvis for a duration of two weeks. More than 50% reduction in cyst volume was considered a success. The perioperative complications, hospitalization days and the effective rate of surgery were evaluated.",

Adding these parameters in Introduction and Objective: Prostate cancer (PCa) grade in the diagnostic biopsy is an important determinant of patient management. The Gleason grading groups (GGG) are recently introduced for grading of prostate cancer. This new scoring system is subject to a similar inter-observer agreement as the Gleason score (60%). Computer aided diagnosis systems using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown to approach human performance in diagnosing skin disease, while reducing inter-observer variability. A CNN learns to recognize patterns from a gold standard and distinguish preset categories. By using a CNN on digital histology slides, it can learn to detect abnormalities and give an indication of likelihood of tumor presence. The aim of this study is to explore the accuracy of a CNN for grading of prostate biopsies using the recently introduced GGG.",

Moreover, patients were asked about the fear of having a new episode of FP and if it disturbed their sex life, leading to performance anxiety or some change in sexual habits, such as avoiding certain sexual positions. Finally, we searched the penis and interviewed the patients about any evidence of pain in erection, penile nodules or curvature acquired after surgery. Conclusion: Surgical treatment of PF has satisfactory results, providing adequate recovery of sexual function, even in the long term follow-up. Most patients preserve erectile function without development of penile curvature or deformity. However, erectile dysfunction could occur in the late postoperative period and must be treated. Psychological sequelae are common, causing fear of recurrence and resulting negative impact on the sexual life of these patients, which must be closely monitored.",

Patients were included if they were female, age between 21 and 60, pre-menopausal and had a symptomatic infection. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, any urological abnormalities, systemic sepsis, or any immune-compromised state. In addition, demographic and clinical details including symptomology, bacteriology data were analyzed for factors impacting QOL. A total of 85 women of different ethnicities (Mean age 31.8 \u00b1 6.8 (SD), 59% Chinese) were recruited into the study. There were no significant co-morbidities in these patients. With an average of 3 episodes of UTI/year, at least 50 % of patients suffered from E.Coli UTI. Table 1 shows that the mean SF-36 scores of RUTI patients were lower in all domains except PF when compared with local published population reference values, adjusted for age and gender. Amongst RUTI women, symptomatology of UTI episodes except fever, obesity (BMI>28), smoking, alcohol intake, previous pregnancies, and sexual activity did not significantly negatively impact on their QOl. However, RUTI women who also reported chronic constipation (CC) had significantly lower mean scores than those without in all domains except MH, RE and VT (Table 1 ).

In the patients stratified according to the size of the tumor, the following average regression rates were achieved: 25.6% \u00b1 20.5% -in the group with tumors of less than 4 cm (n = 10); 17.3% \u00b1 12.1%in the group with the tumor size ranged from 4 to 7 cm (n = 22); 21.5% \u00b1 15% -in the group with the tumors exceeding 7 cm (n = 25) (t-test; p = 0.29). The decrease in the size of primary RCC due to the neoadjuvant TT was a prerequisite for the organ-sparing treatment (partial nephrectomy) in 41 (71.9 %) patients including those with bilateral RCC and RCC of solitary kidney. Nevertheless, the cases of progression and stabilization of the tumor growth in the setting of central localization of cancer and small percentage of functional parenchyma in 16 (28.1 %) patients required nephrectomy.

Treatment options for high-risk PC include external beam-radiation therapy (RT) with androgen-deprivation hormonal therapy; trimodal therapy with a combination of brachytherapy, RT, and hormonal therapy; and radical prostatectomy (RP) with neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. To date, no sufficiently large-scale, prospective, randomized clinical trials have compared the abovementioned treatment options. Thus, optimal management strategies for high-risk PCa patients have not been established. Therefore, this study was aimed to compare the prognoses between patients with high risk localized or locally advanced prostate cancer (PCa) treated with either radiotherapy (RT) or radical prostatectomy (RP) after a median 3.6-month neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (NHT).",

Importantly the procedure is amenable to local anesthesia or monitored sedation without significant morbidity. Early data shows promising results and an alternative to surveillance. Introduction and Objective: Prostate cancer is the most common solid malignancy, with one out of six men being diagnosed during their lifetime, in western Europe and the United States (US). In the US alone, over 1.3 million men undergo a prostate biopsy procedure -the clear majority is performed transrectally (TR). The approach is common because the alternative transperineal (TP) approach is perceived to require general anaesthesia, requires longer time and is economically disadvantageous. However, there are major drawbacks to TR prostate biopsies. Urosepsis is certainly the most devastating one. Such terrible outcome is too common, as 4% of patients require hospital admission post TR prostate biopsy. Multiparametric MRI has enhanced accuracy and significance of prostate cancer detection. Herein we present our MRI/US Fusion of TP Prostate Biopsy technique under local anaesthesia with results from 3 institutions in Europe and the US Materials and Methods: We prospectively collected the information of eligible men -Elevated PSA, Abnormal DRE, an abnormal MRI or a diagnosis of prostate cancer) at the time of TP MRI/US Fusion prostate biopsy, performed under local anaesthesia or mild sedation.

The underlying problem is the misconception of patients that larger penis size results in better sexual performance and satisfaction. In many cases, the injection occurs in a group event where several men are injected together in the same setting by traditional shamans or their peers. Various substances have been encountered in practice, among others hair oil, paraffin, and silicone. Initially a bulking effect of the penis is observed, but over longer time of this painless mass evolves into devastating complications. Patients present with acute complaints of acute pain, genital skin irritation, abscess formation, and in some cases Fournier gangrene. Chronic complaints of this condition are suffered both by the patient and his partner, painful erection, dyspareunia, reduced sexual image leading to rejection of sexual activity by the partner.

Two additional ports were placed above the iliac crest: a 10-mm port on posterior axillary line for the camera and a 5-mm working port on the anterior axillary line. Following identification of quadratus lumborum and psoas muscle, dissection of lumbar ureter was facilitated by the lithiasic protrusion. Longitudinal ureterotomy was performed over the impacted stone, which was extracted and placed inside a specimen retrieval system (Endobag \u2122 , Covidien, Dublin, Ireland). The ureteral stent was identified and the ureteral incision closed with 4-0 polyglactin interrupted suture (Vicryl \u00ae , Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH, USA). A Jackson-Pratt drain was left in place through the 5-mm port and port site closure was completed.",

The patient remained under regular endocrine surveillance. At the age of 29, an asymptomatic elevation of plasmatic metanephrines led to a repeat radiologic evaluation. Abdominopelvic computed tomography identified bilateral adrenal nodules (30 and 16mm in diameter, at the left and right adrenals, respectively), with heterogeneous enhancement and unspecific washout. MIBG (Metaiodobenzylguanidine) scintigraphy was compatible with bilateral pheocromocytoma. The patient was admitted for preoperative hemodynamic and hormonal optimization. A simultaneous bilateral adrenalectomy was performed, via transperitoneal laparoscopic approach in sequential lateral decubitus, with operative time of 130min and <50ml of blood loss. During the procedure, the expected severe hemodynamic variation due to adrenal manipulation and removal was managed accordingly. The procedure was otherwise uneventful.

Previous medical history included only a bilateral hydrocele repair. Due to progressive worsening of the voiding symptoms, the patient underwent a reevaluation with transrectal prostate ultrasound, revealing a 7cm solid lesion on the pelvic cavity, lateral to the prostate, without apparent contact with the bladder, prostate or seminal vesicles. Further characterization with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of a heterogenous 7cm left laterovesicoprostatic solid lesion, with regular contour and well-defined limits, without communication with the surrounding structures. Ultrasound-guided transrectal biopsy of the lesion was inconclusive, revealing fragments of fibro-adipose tissue with areas of unspecific inflammatory infiltration. Considering the probable role of the pelvic lesion on the worsening of voiding symptoms, as well as its undetermined malignant potential, the patient opted for surgical treatment. A transperitoneal laparoscopic excision of the mass was performed, with operative time of 120 minutes, <150ml of blood loss and without immediate complications. Postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged 3 days after the procedure. Pathology and imunohystochemistry of the specimen were compatible with a benign inflammatory miofibroblastic tumor. The patient is asymptomatic at one year of follow-up.",

A stiff 8 Fr ureteral catheter or Double-J-stent pusher is used. The Amplatz catheter can also be used. Its tip is held with a forceps. With a \"lancet\" blade scalpel, beginning from the tip, a 4-5 cm longitudinal slit is performed in one side of the catheter. At the end of the slit, the scalpel is turned on its self to perform a small hole to accommodate the guidewire. It will be the egress point of the guidewire. The catheter is bent just after the slit. Thus, the small hole will be in the apex of the bend. The tail of the guidewire is inserted into the slit tip of the catheter. After transiting in the 4 cm of the catheter with the slit, the guidewire will egress through the hole, in the summit of the bend. The catheter is advanced over the guidewire until reaching the calyceal cavity. \"One shot\" or \"one step\" dilation is performed over the catheter with a 24 Fr Amplatz dilator and sheath.

Endoscopic vision is not perfect secondary to a mild bleeding. Exploration of the parenchyma tunnel finds an active bleeding, which could be tamponed by the Amplatz sheath. However, it was a shallow calyx and when the Amplatz sheath is over advanced, it impede endopyelotomy. Thus, cauterization of the parenchyma is decided.

Bacterial infection induces activation of intracellular signaling pathways through the interaction between bacterial factors and host cell receptors (e.g. lipopolysaccharide and toll like receptor 4). Exosomes are membrane vesicles with a diameter of 40-150 nm and carry various molecular constituents such as proteins and nucleic acids that are contained in cells from which they are derived. Thus, exosomes are expected to serve as a diagnostic marker for various diseases. Since exosomes are also secreted from cells infected with bacteria, urinary exosome analysis may be useful for understanding of mechanisms in UTI.

In the other hand, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most frequent affection of the elderly men and represents the most frequent cause of bladder obstruction. BPH, through its obstructive mechanism, can be a risk factor of bladder cancer. Their simultaneaous resection was considered but it has been a subject of controversies for a longtime. It was suspected to enhance the risk of tumor implantation in the prostatic fossa and then the recurrence risk in this site. Many recent studies have shown that simultaneous resection does not major the risk of recurrence in the prostatic urethra. The aim of this study was to evaluate the oncologic prognosis of this procedure compared to single trans-urethral bladder resection. After restoration of supply, BCG prescriptions for primary and relapsing TCC rebounded to a higher level with a faster rate of growth than prior to the first shock while for CIS the number of prescriptions have not rebounded and are currently close to zero.",

Neurological pathology such as pudendal nerve injury is also sited. Theory 2: Failure in the urinary milk-back mechanism. This is supported by findings on micturating-videocystography showing a bulbar residue between the external sphincter and bladder neck when asked to halt urinary flow. When the external sphincter relaxes, urine falls into the bulbar urethra causing dribbling. Optimal therapy targets the cause. One RCT concluded that pelvic floor exercises showed a greater reduction in urine loss compared to those managed with urethral milking. Pelvic floor exercises and physiotherapy are therefore strongly encouraged for Theory 1. Urethral milking forms the treatment basis for theory 2.

Total IPSS was significantly improved by flexible-dose tamsulosin in this study (P < 0.001). Satisfaction rate on 12 weeks flexible-dose tamsulosin treatment was 59% and dissatisfaction rate was 27.3%. IPSS QoL score, voiding subscore, and storage subscore were significantly improved by flexible-dose tamsulosin too. Total IPSS after 0.4mg dose escalation was significantly improved compared to IPSS before dose escalation in tamsulosin 0.4mg group.

It is hypothesized that the material induces an acute inflammatory response, which leads to constructive remodelling and material integration, but when an excessive inflammatory reaction is given, patient's tissues and/or the synthetic material may be damaged, leading to a mechanical failure of native tissue erosion.

The aetiology of Peyronie's disease remains unknown. It is thought to occur due to a wound healing disorder occurring after trauma in predisposed men. However, many previous postulations have existed. Heraclius' unfortunate urination was attributed to numerous incestuous relationships. Others theorised that the frigidity of the post-menopausal partner was the cause, or shockingly that the \"annoying\" resistance of a partner during forceful penetration was to blame. Lapeyronie associated the disease with venereal infection, but noted that treating one did not treat the other. Peyronie's was so common in wounded soldiers requiring penile transfusion, that a vascular cause was also postulated. Historical treatments include mercury or milk, intralesional injections, and even the suggestion by Lapeyronie himself of bathing in the holy waters of Bar\u00e8ges.

All mpM-RI were performed using a 1.5 T system with external antennal and data were reviewed according PI-RADS v2 by expert uroradiologists. Pathological specimens were classified according the new PCa grading system: grade 1: Gleason 6 (3+3), grade 2: Gleason 7 (3+4), grade 3: Gleason 7 (4+3), grade 4: Gleason 8 (4+4) and grade 5: Gleason 9-10. Statistical data was achieved with SPSS v.20: The agreement between the mpMRI and PCGS was measured by the kappa concordance coefficient (KCC). Hypothesis testing was performed using the chi square test and the Fisher's exact test.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a light-based imaging technique that facilitates instant three-dimensional tissue visualization on a \u00b5m scale down to ~2mm depth.

Therefore, the need of an adequate biopsy sampling for these patients is mandatory, even if they are more at risk of post-biopsy complications, including infections. Fosfomycin trometamol (FT), is a bactericidal, broad-spectrum antibiotic with low profile of resistance and elevated activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria but the prostate tissue distribution is not well know. Aim of our prospective study is to compare the prostatic concentration of FT in men with different metabolic abnormalities. arithmetic mean of C and P was considered as total prostatic concentration (T). Metabolic features, including waist circumference, blood pressure, glycaemia, HDL-Cholesterol and trigliceride was recorded from all men, and splitted into normal or pathologic values according to NCEP-ATPIII definitions. The differences in concentration of FT inside prostate (in zones: C, P and T) between men with or without abnormal metabolic parameters were analyzed by Anova.",

Classically, the antimicrobial prophylaxis is based on oral fluoroquinolones (FQ) starting on the day before the procedure.

Many risk factors have been suggested, but recent antimicrobial use has the major impact. The addition of peri-procedural intramuscular (IM) gentamicin theoretically offers better antimicrobial spectrum coverage, without significantly increasing time spent on the procedure, without nephrotoxicity and without increasing selective antimicrobial pressure.

Patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) for bladder cancer usually have a segment of small bowel used for urinary diversion. Small bowel recovery could lead to loose stools post-operatively in RC patients. Management of suspected C. diff involves isolation protocols that might necessitate patients to single rooms outside their parent ward. For RC patients, this could represent inadequate post-operative nursing care. This study analysed the incidence of C. diff infections in RC patients Materials and Methods: A prospective database of cystectomy patients is maintained in our institution, collecting data on patient demographics, operative and pathological outcomes. Patients having Bristol stool grade 6-7 and symptoms suggestive of infective diarrhea post-operatively had stool samples sent for microbiological analysis. Anti-microbial use during the peri-operative course was reviewed. C. diff positive patients, only 1.7% of those were RC patients. As loose stool is an accepted post-operative occurrence in RC patients and the low incidence of C. diff infection, should we adjust the protocol by which we isolate post-RC patients with loose stools to allow for the expected loose motion post-operatively.",

Although its correction can improve abnormal semen parameters, it is still debatable if it improves the odds of spontaneous pregnancy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the spontaneous pregnancy rate, the need to resort to medically assisted reproduction techniques and the birth rate in a population of infertile patients who were submitted to percutaneous embolization of clinical varicocele. Results: After performance of the varicocele percutaneous embolization, and without accounting for the semen parameters, 42% of the couples resorted to assisted reproduction techniques. The overall pregnancy rate was 47% (52.4% were spontaneous and 47.6% occurred after assisted reproduction techniques). On average, the first pregnancy occurred 17.54\u00b114.4 months after the percutaneous procedure. 55.7% of the pregnancies occurred in the first 12 months after the treatment. The time between embolization and spontaneous pregnancy or pregnancy after assisted reproduction techniques is not significantly different (p>0.05). Of these pregnancies, 83% resulted in delivery, mostly of a single newborn (81%). The patients that had higher mobility rates before the procedure had higher odds of pregnancy (p=0.031). Couples with men with higher sperm concentration after the embolization had also higher pregnancy rates (p=0.012).",

The female patients who became pregnant were young (median age = 26 years), had a healthy BMI (median = 28), and had a median infertility duration of 5 years. Most of the sperm used in the ICSI cycles came from ejaculation (64.7%). Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to study the predictability of clinical pregnancy. Prognostic variables included; 5 male factors (infertility duration, testicular grade, fresh/frozen, sperm source and percent of abnormal forms) and 6 female factors (age, BMI, smoking, infertility duration, number of good embryos, and transfer day) were considered. Restricted cubic splines were applied to numeric or ordinal variables to accommodate potential non-linear associations. The final nomogram was built from the logistic model with the 11 selected predictors. The model discrimination was quantified by a concordance index (CI), which is equal to the non-parametric area under the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and represents the probability that for a randomly selected pair of cases, the one with clinical pregnancy would have a higher predicted probability of being clinically pregnant than the other without clinical pregnancy. The CI ranges from 0.5 to 1 with 0.5 indicating no discrimination ability and 1 representing perfect separation of patients with different outcomes. In addition, calibration was assessed graphically by plotting the observed against the predicted probability. Bootstrap analysis with 1000 resamples was used to correct over-fitting bias in the internal validation. All statistical analyses and plotting were performed using R version 2.12.2 (2011-02-25 R Development Core Team) with Hmisc and Design packages added. An alpha level of 0.05 was used.

The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic impact of preoperative serum CYFRA 21-1 level on extra-urothelial recurrence after nephroureterectomy in patients with non-metastatic UTUC. Despite the earlier detection of suspicious masses, mortality has remained largely stable, suggesting over treatment of small renal masses. These concerns have led to a resurgence in renal biopsies.

To delineate parameters affecting the selection of the appropriate surgical tactics, the univariate and multivariate analysis was used. The following factors were taking into account: tumor size, exo-or endophytic growth pattern, the proximity of tumor to the renal cavitary system, and tumor location -in sinus (n=425), polar (n=285) or lateral (n=193). The volume of the functional renal parenchyma (VFRP) was assessed by the original methodology. All the parameters were based on CT findings. The nomograms demonstrating how VFRP and tumor size affect the selection of the appropriate surgical treatment depending on the tumor location have been plotted. For RCC with polar localization, VFRP > 58 % should be considered as indication for PN. For RCC located in sinus, the tumor size less than 38 mm on the average should be considered as indication for PN. The analysis allowed us for the development of the novel nephrometric system for the assessment of tumors of kidneys (NCIU nephrometry). NCIU system that takes into consideration both tumor location (Nearness -central location of tumor; Collateral -peripheral location; Inferior -lower location; Upperupper location) and VFRP allows one for determining precisely the indications for PN or RN.",

In case of lateral location of the tumor with VFRP > 58 %, PN should be considered. In case of medial location of the tumor, the size of the tumor is the principal factor affecting the selection of the surgical tactics. The less is the tumor size (fewer than 38 mm), the more likely is PN as the treatment choice. Introduction and Objective: Use of neoadjuvant targeted therapy (nTT) prior to nephron-sparing surgery is a new approach in managing of complex kidney lesions. The use of TT allows for significant increase in survival of the patients with advanced and metastatic RCC decreasing the size of the primary foci as well.

In our practice, we utilized the device to close the 12-mm assisting port at the end of the cases. Patients have been divided into two groups: group A included all patient on which we utilized the TSCD, group B included patients on which TSCD wasn't used. We compared results between groups including length of stay, post-operative analgesia requirement and risk of developing incisional hernia post-operatively. In all patients, we have utilized the same peri-operative and post-operative analgesia protocol. Forty-year female with no co-morbid illness, presented with hematuria. Contrast enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) of abdomen and pelvis was suggestive of solitary, asymmetrical, in-homogenously enhancing mass arising from the dome of the bladder, measuring 5.5cm x4.5cmx 1.4cm in maximum diameter. Subsequent transurethral biopsy proved the mass to be a mucinous ade-nocarcinoma of bladder. We proceeded with a robotic partial cystectomy. After distention with normal saline, tumor bulge was seen at dome and anterior wall of the bladder. At this stage flexible cystoscopy was done using Karl StorzTM (Tuttlingen,Germany) cysto-nephroscope scope. Tumor was visualized simultaneously under cystoscopic and robotic view with help of Tile-Pro TM (Intuitive surgicals, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) feature. At this stage, the light intensity of the robotic lens was decreased so that the tumor could be trans-illuminated by the cystoscope. Cystoscopic view could be seen at the bottom of the console screen using the Tile-proTM feature. Area to be resected was marked with monopolar scissors, using electrocautery on the peritoneal surface of bladder, 1cm away from the tumor margin. Using simultaneous visualization, bladder was incised with a margin of 1cm around the tumor and tumor was excised along with urachus, anterior peritoneum and perivesical fat. Thought the same can be replicated in laparoscopic surgery, but the surgeon requires two separate screens and has to concentrate on both of them. Moreover, easy availability of a cystoscope makes it a preferred choice over intraoperative ultrasound which she is an expensive and scarcely available.",

Before incising the plate, we tested the diameter of urethral plate by approximating the edge of opposite glans over the 10 Fr. urethral catheter. When it was necessary to deepen the ventral glanular groove further, it was incised until the urethral plate was divided enough to make the urethra with an adequate diameter after tubularization. Thereafter, a horseshoe shaped de-epithelialization was made in the glans around the meatus as described by Zaontz.

Almost 1/3 were downgraded to Gleason 7 (3+4) and 1/4 to Gleason 7 (4+3). This means that we could be over-diagnosing Gleason 8. This is not only of concern for patients where no final pathology will be available (those undergoing radiotherapy or brachytherapy), but also for those patients where a small difference of one or two Gleason grades might influence the therapeutic decision. The limitations of this scoring system should be considered when selecting treatments, and should be an effort refining PC diagnostic techniques.",

Treatment protocol mandated a safety margin of 3 mm within the prostate capsule, anticipating 10% untreated prostate. Of the 30 patients, 55% (16/29) had cancer on repeat biopsy, which was clinically significant in 31% (9/29). Six patients underwent salvage therapy. Here we report on our experience with the 4 salvage prostatectomies (SP) that were performed. Results: SP was technically feasible in all 4 men. A modified Lloyd-Davies position allowed rectal access for an assistants finger to guide the posterior dissection.

The CAPRA-S c-index for BCR was 0.63 in this validation set Conclusion: In this study, the CAPRA-S score was capable to predict BCR after radical prostatectomy with a c-index of 0.63. This is the first reported study to validate this tool in a population from the Middle East. The low perforance of CAPRA-S in predicting BCR in our population may be attributed to the fact that 30% of cohort is high risk , adding to that the small sample size and retrospective nature of the study.",

One of the technically demanding aspects of this surgery is the urethrovesical anastomosis. To describe a new device for facilitating the urethrovesical anastomosis at the time of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy Materials and Methods: We have designed a new device to perform the urethrovesical anastomosis in a semiauthomatic way. The set include a 27F cystoscope to facilitate the placement and enhance the quality of 4 double urethrovesical sutures. Stitches are placed with new device able to change both suture needles simultaneously from one to the other jaw introduced through a 12 mm laparoscopic trocar. All 4 sutures are placed at 6, 3, 9 and 12 o' clock position. Knots are performed extracoporally and moved down with a pusher.",

A double running suture with barbed unidrectional sutures is the most used system to perform urethrovesical anastomosis at the radical laparoscopic prostatectomy. The average time for this anastomosis is 27 minutes (range 14 to 80). Technical results depend on surgeons skills and experience.

Evaluate the rate of subgrading of patients with biopsies showing Gelason 6 PC. Identify clinical and analytical factors correlating with subgrading that could be used in regular practice. Compare rates of recurrence in patients initially subgraded. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . 60.6% of patients had a Gleason > 6 in the RP specimen. Factors correlating with this subgrading were a PV < 50cc (p=0.008) and more than 3 positive cores in PB (p=0.003). The rate of recurrence was 14.4% (excluding the 9 patients who underwent adjunctive radiotherapy). There was no correlation between recurrence and the following factors: subgrading (p=0.981), positive surgical margins (p=0.142), pT staging (p=0.049).",

Due to the shorter vein and the greater incidence of venous thrombosis in right allografts, left kidneys are frequently elected. However, left arterial anatomy may be complex, rendering the transplantation demanding. For this reason, analysing outcomes after left multiple-artery kidney (LMAK) and right single-artery (RSAK) harvest could aid in decision-making. The inability to meet the needs of patients on the transplant waiting list, with the donation in brain death and the living donor, has led to the development of alternative programs in order to increase the number of donor organs. In our Region, we have implanted the donation in controlled asystole with Maastricht type III donors, that is, those patients who died after cessation of life support treatment (LTSV).

Materials and Methods: Tumor samples taken from 40 patients with histopathology diagnosis of CCRCC and tissue samples from 20 normal kidneys as a control group were examined by immuno-histochemical staining for CD 31. Results: The mean CD 31 expression in CCRCC was significantly higher than in the benign kidney tissue (109.5 vs. 23.2) (U=699, P<0.0001). CD 31 expression values in CCRCC were negatively correlated with degree of tumor necrosis (r =-0.304, P=0.055); the Fuhrman nuclear grade (r=-0.132, P=0.415); the tumor size (r=-0.09, P =0.578); the pathological stage (r=-0.03, P=0.817), VEGF A expression (r = -0.09, P=0.817); and degree of tumor hemorrhage (r=-0.01, P=0.93). CD 31 expression values in CCRCC were positively correlated with DFS (r=0.182, P=0.334); PFS (r=0.162, P=0.653) and CSS (r=0.160, P=0.731) in CCRCC.",

The aim of surgical reconstruction for urethral stricture is to provide an adequate caliber, compliant and stable urethra. The changing pattern of urethral stricture management with open urethral reconstructive surgery was started since 2012 in our center. The success rate of open urethral reconstructive surgery is defined as a stable and good flow rate also no postoperative calibration nor dilatation. To present our center`s experience in managing urethral stricture with open reconstructive surgery and the impact on urethral dilatation procedure in urological outpatient services. and Methods: This is a prospective study.Patients who had open reconstructive surgery and patients who had urethral dilatation in outpatient clinic from 2012 to 2016 at Hasan Sadikin General Hospital Bandung were included in the study. We study the characteristic of the patient who underwent urethral dilatation procedure in outpatient services during that period of time. We perform the comparison study between ratio of open reconstructive surgery and ratio of urethral dilatation from total of urethral stricture patients each year. The correlation between ratio of open reconstructive surgery and ratio of urethral dilatation was analyzed by Pearson analysis.Results: The total of patient underwent open urethral reconstructive surgery technique was 320 patients, and total patient who underwent urethral dilatation was 174 during 5 years period. Mean for ratio of urethral dilatation was 0.30\u00b10.18 and ratio of open reconstructive surgery was 0.59\u00b10.16. There was significant correlation between increase of ratio of open reconstructive surgery and decrease of ratio of urethral dilatation (P 0.012). There was a strong negative correlation between ratio of open reconstructive surgery and ratio of urethral dilatation (R -0.955) Conclusion: Open reconstructive surgery gives a positive impact in decreasing number of urethral dilatation procedure. There was significant correlation between increase of ratio of open reconstructive surgery as decrease of ratio of urethral dilatation procedure in outpatient services. Open reconstructive surgery is more effective rather than continuous urethral dilatation. DVIU/dilation combined with intermittent dilation may be used as a palliative maneuver for patients unwilling to open undergo urethral reconstruction or medically unfit for surgery. Introduction and Objective: Urethral stricture disease is seen in 2-9% of patients after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) but data is limited as to treatment outcomes. Our purpose is to establish patterns of disease severity and treatment for post-TURP strictures. and Methods: A retrospective database was created for patients who underwent management of post-TURP strictures at 9 reconstructive urology centers. Data consisted of demographics, TURP method, location/length of urethral strictures, interventions prior to urethroplasty, surgical technique used for urethroplasty, and outcomes. Exclusion criteria included age <18 and follow-up period <1 year. Success is defined as no intervention within the observation period. A descriptive analysis was performed on a total of 130 patients. Success rate for patients who had prior endoscopic intervention (urethrotomy or dilation) was 83% versus those with no prior endoscopic intervention who had a success rate of 100%. Seventeen percent of patients reported complications including recurrent UTI, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and penile shortening.",

In this study, we hypothesized that bladder contractility index (BCI) may be an early marker for future renal deterioration in patients of PUV. CKD III or estimated eGFR of \u226445 ml/min/1.73m2 has been reported to be associated with more adverse renal, cardiovascular and clinical outcome. The objective is to assess the correlation of bladder contractility index (BCI) with development of CKD III (eGFR of \u226445 ml/min/1.73m2;KDIGO classification) or more in PUV. and Methods: A retrospective search of our hospital database identified 320 children with PUV who had undergone valve ablation between 2000 and 2010. Patients' clinical records were analyzed as on December 2015. Two hundred and seventy patients were included for the analysis. All patients had a baseline urodynamic study (UDS) done at 6 months after valve surgery and thereafter annually for 5 years. UDS parameters collected were, bladder contractility index (BCI=PdetQmax+5 Qmax), end filling pressure (EFP), compliance (\u0394C), bladder outlet obstruction index (BOOI= Pdet Qmax -2 Qmax) and bladder volume ejection (BVE=Voided volume/total capacity). Primary end point of the study was an eGFR of \u226445 ml/min/1.73m2 (CKD stage IIIA or more, KDI-GO classification). : Mean follow-up period was 12.5 years (range 1-15) and median age of patients at the time of evaluation was 5.8 yrs. At the end of the study, 21.8% (59/270) patients had progressed to CKD stage IIIA or more and lifetime risk for developing CKD stage was 45%. Cox regression analysis of risk factors predicting development of CKD stage IIIA was done.Conclusion: Bladder contractility index and end filling pressure are the two important urodynamic indices which can predict early the long-term risk of development of CKD stage III in children with PUV.Introduction and Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the success and morbidity of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) performed through the 11th intercostal space and compare it with the subcostal approach. and Methods: Data of patients with renal calculi under 18 years of age were prospectively collected between January 2005 and December 2015. Patients were divided into two groups those done with supracostal (group 1) and subcostal access (group 2). Patient characteristics, stone location, stone burden, number and location of the access point, operative time, visual pain score, hospital stay, and complications according to the modified Clavien classification were compared between group 1 and group 2. On day 1 of the operation, all patients were investigated for complete blood count (CBC) and any fall in the hematocrit level. Postoperative chest X-ray was routinely done in all cases of supra-costal access. both the group. The stone-free rate was 84.8% and 85.36% in groups 1 and 2 respectively after one session of PCNL. Change in hematocrit level (p=0.261), visual pain score/ need of analgesia (p=0.368), and hospital stay (p=0.231) were not statistically significant in two groups. A total of 27 (49%) complications were documented in the two groups according to modified Clavien classification. Overall complication rate was 28% in group 1 and 25% in group 2 (p value =0.799). Grade-I complications were recorded in 17 (30.1%), grade-II in 8 (14.5%) and grade IIIb in 2 (3.63%) patients. Grade-IIIb complications were recorded in group1 only; 1 in the form of nephropleural fistula which responded to repositioning of JJ stent and placement of a nephrostomy tube and another hydropneumothorax requiring intercostal tube drainage. There were no grade-IV or grade-V complications. : Supracostal PCNL in selected cases is effective and safe with acceptable complications. The modified Clavien system provides a standardized grading system for complications of PCNL in pediatric patients. and Objectives: S.T.O.N.E nephrolithometry and Guy's score can be used for predicting stone free status, preoperative patient counselling and surgical planning before percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL). The objective is to determine the mean value of Guy's stone score and S.T.O.N.E nephrolithometry in predicting stone clearance after percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL). and Methods: We conducted a prospective study of patients undergoing single tract, prone posi-37th CONGRESS OF THE SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9 INTERNATIONALE D'UROLOGIE -SIU 2017 ABSTRACT BOOK tion PNL at our hospital. Only patients with unilateral procedure and radio-opaque stones were included. The Guy's Stone Score and S.T.O.N.E. Nephrolithometry score were calculated on non-contrast CT scan before procedure. Stone clearance was assessed with X-ray KUB within 2 weeks and complications were graded using modified Clavien grading system. Patients who were stone free were compared with those who had residual fragments. Chi-square/ Fischer exact test was used for comparison of categorical variables where appropriate. Student's t-test was used for comparing continuous variables. A p-value of \u22640.05 was taken as statistically significant.Conclusions: Both scores are useful predictors of stone clearance and can be used in preoperative patient counseling. However, Guys score is simple and readily usable in clinic settings due to its pictorial representation, while S.T.O.N.E score is cumbersome and time consuming.",

Under general or spinal anesthesia, the patient is placed in the split-leg modified lateral position. The skin and nephrostomy catheter are disinfected, and betadine soaked gauze are left around the nephrostomy catheter for at least 15 minutes. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a guidewire is inserted through the nephrostomy catheter and it is coiled in the renal pelvis or passed down the ureter. The nephrostomy catheter is removed. A 24F Amplatz sheath is back-loaded over the 24F nephroscope. Under endoscopic vision, the nephroscope is advanced through the percutaneous tract beside the guidewire, until reaching the caliceal cavities. Then, the Amplatz sheath is advanced over the nephroscope to the kidney. The guidewire is left outside the Amplatz sheath. : From January 2012 to May 2016, 16 patients had a second look-PCNL. The reentry under endoscopic vision was possible in all cases in a few minutes time. Save in one case in which the second look was scheduled after 3 weeks, with 18Fr nephrostomy catheter, because of pus retention, the 21F nephroscope had reached the collecting system, however the introduction of the 24F Amplatz sheath was difficult. Therefore, dilation of the tract was performed with the 24F Amplatz dilator.

For optimal efficacy, several authoritative guidelines recommend BCG administration at a maintenance schedule. Despite this recommendation, maintenance therapy remains underused. We aimed to evaluate the patterns of BCG use and its impact on outcomes in NMIBC patients at an Australian tertiary centre. and Methods: Medical records were retrospectively assessed between 2009 and 2013 for patients referred for BCG therapy. Data collated from electronic medical records included: patient demographics, pathological diagnostics, treatment details, follow-up and oncological outcomes. The maintenance schedule involved BCG instillations weekly for three weeks, every three months for one year. Recurrence was confirmed on cystoscopy and/or histology, and presence of muscle invasion was considered as progression. T-test, Fisher's exact test and Kaplan Meier regressions were used. : Data for 170 patients who received BCG therapy was assessed. Preliminary analysis demonstrates 24% of patients completed maintenance therapy. Only 9 patients (10%) in the BCG maintenance arm had recurrences. No patients receiving maintenance BCG progressed. Kaplan Meier regression displayed a 74% risk reduction of recurrence. : Extending BCG therapy to maintenance can further minimise the progression and recurrence of urothelial bladder carcinoma versus BCG induction alone. Despite this, BCG maintenance remains underutilised. The reasons for the low utility of maintenance BCG are unclear but should be the focus for further study.Dept. of Surgery, Austin Health, The University",

In this study, we examined the first-degree relatives of asymptomatic adolescent boys who were diagnosed with a varicocele to reveal the familial risk for varicocele. and Methods: From October 2014 until March 2017, we examined 609 adolescents aged 11 to 16 years. Ultrasonography was used to diagnose varicoceles, which were defined as venous vessels with a diameter \u22652mm and retrograde flow during valsalva manoeuvre. The participant and parent were asked to fill in a questionnaire in which we asked whether the participants father and brother(s) have (had) a varicocoele. Chi-square analysis was used for statistical analysis. : In 38 of the 609 (6.24%) included boys, the father was found to have or have had a varicocele. The other 571 (93.76%) boys formed the control group. In 17 of the 38 (44.74%) fathers with a varicocoele, the son was diagnosed with a varicocele. In the control group this was the case in 21 (3.68%) sons. Chi-square analysis showed a significant difference between both groups (p = 0.001). No significant difference was found when stratified for varicocele grade (p = 0.246).Of the 609 included boys, 9 (1.48%) had a brother who had or have had a varicocoele, the other 600 (98.52%) boys formed the control group. Of the 9 brothers with a varicocoele, 2 (22.22%) had a brother in which we diagnosed a varicocele. In the control group this was the case in 133 (22.17%) brothers. Chi-square analysis showed no significant difference between both groups (p = 0.997). No significant difference was found after stratification for varicocele grade (p = 0.246).:  We report a varicocele prevalence of 22.17% in Flemish asymptomatic adolescent boys. In conclusion, a significant increase in the risk for a varicocele exists when the patients father has or has had a varicocoele. When a father is known with a varicocele, his son should be screened during adolescence. Furthermore, this risk doesn't seem to be influenced by the grade of varicocoele.",

Its prevalence in asymptomatic men is reported to be 4,2% to 5,6%(1,2). As far as we know, there's no knowledge about the relation between TM and testicular volume. and Methods: From April 2015 until December 2016, we examined 474 adolescents aged 11 to 16 years. Adolescents with a current or past pathology influencing testicular growth were excluded. Ultrasonography was used to determine testicular dimensions. Testicular volumes were calculated using Lambert's formula: (Volume=LxWxHx0,71).Independent t-test was used for statistical analysis.Conclusion: We report a prevalence of TM in Flemish asymptomatic adolescent boys of 8,97%. Furthermore, these results show that the mean testicular volumes in boys with TM don't seem to differ from the mean testicular volumes in the healthy population.Alterations of Autonomic NervousSystem Activity during Bladder Filling in Children with Spina Bifida Kim SW, Lee YS, Han SW Introduction and Objective: The functional activity of autonomic nervous system in spina bifida has not been well elucidated. Our objective was to investigate autonomic nervous system activity using heart rate variability (HRV) in children with spina bifida during bladder filling. and Methods: HRV was assessed during video-urodynamic study in a fixed protocol (P0: 2 minutes before start filling; P1: start of filling-normal desire to void; P2: P1-end of filling or start of voiding). A total of 25 HRV and UDS results between May 2015 and July 2016 were reviewed retrospectively. During the period, children with vesicoureteral reflux who underwent video-urodynamic study was established as a control group. Children more 4 years old were included for the study. Children who had voiding symptoms or who were on medication affecting autonomic nervous activity such as anticholinergics were excluded. Sixteen patients were included finally (9 control, 7 spina bifida). : Comparison of outcomes at baseline demonstrated significantly lower RMSSD and pNN50 in children with spina bifida compared with control (23.46\u00b114.99 vs 50.96\u00b123.53, p=0.018; 4.61\u00b16.58 vs 33.97\u00b122.02, p=0.004, respectively). In frequency domain, high frequency (HF) HRV was significantly lower (117.61\u00b1117.83 vs 724.43\u00b1402.64, p=0.002) while low frequency (LF) HRV was not different (p=0.502). During filling phase, the ratio of LF/HF (P0 5.43\u00b15.95 vs P1 3.85\u00b14.93, p=0.025) was reduced and HF were significantly increased in children with spina bifida. : Alterations in cardiac autonomic nervous system activity were detected in children with spina bifida at baseline and during bladder filling. Domains representing parasympathetic activity are relatively decreased in children with spina bifida and sympathetic activity is dominant at baseline. During bladder filling phase, a decrease in sympathetic neural activity in children with spina bifida may be related to the pathophysiology of neurogenic bladder in spina bifida.Introduction and Objective:To evaluate the clinical results of monotherapy with combination therapy in treatment of primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (PMNE) in children.",

Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) induce testies descent that may be through increasing testicle's weight and vessels and also inducing testosterone. The aim of this study is to investigate therapeutic effects of HCG in treatment of unilateral UDT in children. and Methods: In a perspective qualitative study, 211 male children with unilateral Cryptorchidism and over the six months' age that did not undergo surgical procedure, treated by HCG infusion. They visited 4 weeks, 3 months and 12 months following treatment and were checked in testis location, recurrence and complications. Data were analyzed by Khi -deux test. : Suggest that 4 weeks following the last injection of HCG, in 160 (75.12%) patient's relocation of testis to the inguinal canal and descent to the scrotum were observed. Among 46 patients with intrabdominal testis, in 32 patients (69.50%) testis was relocated to the inguinal canal. Also, in 86 patients intrainguinal testis, in 60 patients (69.7%) testis was relocated to the scrotum. This was 78% (39 of 50) in the patients with sup.ing. pouch testis and 100% patients with retractile testis had descent to the scrotum. : More than 50% of cases in all groups replied to the treatment with HCG that resulted in the descent from primary location. This seems slightly higher in comparison to the previous studies. With regard to primary anatomical testis location, there was almost 20% -25% of recurrence so at least one year following is necessary.Is Top-Down Approach Accurate enough to Identify Vesicoureteral Reflux? Introduction and Objective: This study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans performed during febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) for prediction in identifying the severity of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). and Methods: Between January 2005 and December 2016, 208 of 1500 children (416 renal units) who were admitted with the diagnosis of a first febrile UTI with positive urine culture at our hospital retrospectively were evaluated. For them renal DMSA scan was performed during the first two weeks of UTI and VCUG at the first month after treating UTI. Renal parenchymal status based on DMSA scan was classified as normal, pyelonephritic change, scars and atrophy. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of DMSA scanning for predicting VUR were analyzed. : Male-to-female ratio was 59/149. The mean age was 3.34\u00b12.54 years. Patients with pyelonephritic change in DMSA had significantly higher rate of grade III VUR (P<0.001) and patients with scar in DMSA had significantly higher rate of grade IV-V VUR (P=0.005). Spearman analysis showed a significant association between grade of VUR and severity of renal damage in DMSA (P<0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (NPV) of DMSA scan in predicting VUR was as followed: 52%, 75%, 78% and 48%. : This study showed that first step use of DMSA scan in assessment of children with first episode of febrile UTI lead in missing of many patients with high grade VUR and DMSA could not predict results of VCUG with enough accuracy. Hughes K 1 , Baird A 2 The Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool, United Kingdom; 2 Aintree University Hospital and Alder Hey Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool, United Kingdom Introduction and Objective: Intravesical botox therapy was originally reserved for girls with medical refractory overactive bladder symptoms (OAB) with proven detrusor over-activity (DO) on urodynamic studies (UDS). However, girls without DO can still have exhibit significant OAB symptoms resulting in low self-esteem, social isolation and undue stress and anxiety when compared to their peers. Our aim is to see if there is a significant difference between quality of life outcome scores in patients with NNDO diagnosed on urodynamic studies (UDS) versus clinically demonstrated idiopathic overactive bladder symptoms (IOAB) receiving submucosal intravesical botulinum toxin A injections. and Methods: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data of patients aged 10-18 undergoing their first intravesical botox treatment (200 IU Allergan) between April 2010 and April 2014. Patients were subcategorized into 2 groups: NNDO diagnosed on UDS (group 1) and those with normal or no urodynamic studies (group 2). A PIN-Q paediatric quality of life questionnaire was completed on the day of surgery and 3 months post operatively. The difference in scores was statistically analyzed using the unpaired student-t test on graphpad (p= <0.05 was considered significant). : Thirty-two females received botox. Seventeen in group 1, mean age 14.5 years (10.9-17.5). There was no significant difference between group demographics or previous medical therapies tried. Pre PIN-Q: mean 40.5 (26-74). Post PIN-Q: mean 25.7 (8-58). Reduction in PIN-Q score: mean 6.9 (31-3). Fifteen in group 2, including 6 with normal and 9 without UDS pre-botox. Mean age 15.3 years (12.0-17.0). Pre PIN-Q: mean 47.4 (29-77). Post PIN-Q: mean 16.0 (3-31). All girls had a reduction in their PIN-Q score post botox; mean 16.1 (49-10). There was no statistical difference between the pre (p=0.37), post (p=0.30) and decrease (p=0.14) in PIN-Q scores. : UDS should not be performed routinely on all patients with medical refractory IOAB prior to botox therapy. It should be reserved for patients with intractable symptoms post treatment. Introduction and Objective: The loss of one testicle may affect not only fertility but also psychological matter, especially in young adults. However there 37th CONGRESS OF THE SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9 INTERNATIONALE D'UROLOGIE -SIU 2017 ABSTRACT BOOK has been no study on the etiology of testicular loss in those ages. The current study is aimed to estimate the prevalence of testicular loss and identify the disease that contributed to the testicular loss in post pubertal young male. and Methods: In Korea, all 19-year-old men are candidates for military service so they must visit the Military Manpower Administration to check their health status. Thus, they are considered a cohort of young Korean male adults born in the same year. The retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted with total 74,033 examinees to evaluate the prevalence of testicular loss among 19 years old male who visit Seoul and Incheon Military Manpower Administration for draft physical examination from April 2014 to March 2016.The examinees of testicular absent or severe atrophy were identified and investigated through medical history taking, physical examination, scrotal ultrasound, abdominal CT and medical records review. In this study, severe testicular atrophy was defined as volume which less than 1/3 of unaffected testis measured by sonography. : The prevalence of testicular loss was 0.10% (75 of the 74,033 examinees). Of the 75 examinees, 71 examinees were unilateral testicular loss and remaining 4 were bilateral testicular loss. The most common cause was testicular torsion (24 examinees, 32.0%) and the other etiologies of testicular loss are summarized in table 1. Sixteen of the 24 examinee who underwent the scrotal exploration for testicular torsion were significantly delayed in hospital visit more than 1 day. Also, only 3 of the 18 examinee presenting testicular loss from cryptorchidism underwent surgical treatment within 18 months. : In our knowledge, this is the first epidemiology study of testicular loss in similar ages especially in young adults. Most of testicular loss was associated with late access to urological clinic that leads to delay in surgery. Therefore, clinicians and media should provide proper education on promoting public awareness not to delay diagnosis and visiting hospital especially in younger ages.The Comparison of High Ligation Only versus High Ligation with Hydrocelectomy in the Pediatric Hydrocele: Is Hydrocelectomy Necessary in Pediatric Hydrocele? Ha JY, Shin TJ, Byun HJ, Jung WH, Kim BH, Park CH, Kim CI Dept. of Urology, Keimyung University Dongsan Medical Center, Daegu, South Korea Introduction and Objective: A hydrocele is classified into two types by etiology. Noncommunicating type occurs at any age, mostly in adults. The treatment of choice of noncommunicating hydrocele is a hydrocelectomy, an incision is made into the scrotum. Communicating type present at birth, generally found in infants and young children. In most of the cases, a patent processus vaginalis would be found and would require to be ligated via inguinal incision, as standard surgical approach for hernia in children. Several studies of pediatric hydrocele repair have been reported, but there are no definite guidelines that clearly demonstrates a necessity of hydrocelectomy in pediatric hydrocele. Thus, we reviewed the outcomes of hydrocele repair to assess the necessity of hydrocelectomy. and Methods: A total of 77 boys received hydrocele repairs from March 2014 to January 2017. The patients were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 consisted of 45 patients who underwent high ligation with hydrocelectomy or unroofing via inguinal incision. Group 2 included 92 patients who received laparoscopic high ligation with or without scrotal aspiration. The surgical complication or recurrence were assessed between the groups. Patient visitations were arranged at 1 week, 1 month, 1 year after surgery. We compared the baseline information and surgical outcomes between the groups. : The median age of patient was 27 months (range 19-65 months) in group 1 and 39 months (range 18-136 months) in group 2. Of the 45 patients in group 1, the hydrocele was right-sided in 30, left-sided in 13, both-sided in 2 cases. Of the 92 patients in group 2, the hydrocele was right-sided in 40, left-sided in 28, both-sided in 24 cases. The mean operative time was 25 and 13 min for group 1 and group 2, respectively. Median follow-up period was 20 months (2-34 months) in group1, 18 months (1-32 months) in group 2. No postoperative hydrocele recurrence was observed in group 1. Two patents in group 2 experienced recurrence due to incomplete enclosing of internal inguinal ring. Among them, 1 patient underwent laparoscopic repair, 1 patient underwent only high ligation through the inguinal incision. Eleven children had postoperative scrotal swelling or hematoma in group1. No complication happened in group 2. Of the group 2, 3 cases had no patent processus vaginalis (PPV) identified at laparoscopy and of them 2 were converted to open surgery through a scrotal incision, 1 was just aspirated. : Most pediatric hydroceles are communicating. Therefore, it was not necessary to remove the hydrocele sac in pediatric hydrocele. The high ligation of PPV is only an effective procedure for pediatric hydroceles. There were two recurrences in group 2. The recurrent hydroceles were treated with only high ligation, again. The cause may have been that the PPV was not completely sealed or the PPV was inadvertently released by the incomplete knot. UP.304, Table 1. Cause of Testicular Loss UP.306,",

Afterwards, the confirmation tests will be carried out with renal ultrasonogram, DMSA renal scan. Urinary Neutrophil Gelatinase-associated Lipocalin (NGAL)/\u03b22-Microglobuline (\u03b22-MG) is an effective test for early detection of proximal tubule injury. We want to recognize the efficacy of urinary NGAL/\u03b22-MG for the differentiation between upper and lower UTIs (urinary tract infections) and early detection of renal injury in febrile infants with UTI. and Methods: From September 2015 to May 2016, among the 163 infants who were diagnosed with the diagnosis of febrile UTI, 86 patients who were tested DMSA renal were enrolled. Prior to antibiotics therapy, all patients were tested uNGAL and \u03b22-MG. DMSA renal scan was carried out within three days. We determined the presence and degree of photon defects in DMSA renal scan. And we compared to the value of the NGAL/\u03b22-MG and analyzed the diagnostic capability of the acute pyelonephritis and renal injury.Results: Among 86 patients, 40 (46.5 %) patients were identified the photon defects in DMSA renal scan. The 26 patients were planar (8/26, 30.8%), and 60 patients were SPECT (32/60, 53.3%). Among them, single defect was observed in 24 cases, multiple defects (more than 2 defects) were observed in 16 cases (2 defects; 12 patients, 3 defects; 3 patients, 4 defects; 1 patients). The mean value of the urinary NGAL was 304.1 (2.1- 1088.6). Urinary NGAL, which had a photon defect, was 374.7 (34.5-1088.6) and 247.1 (2.1-1066.8)  in no photon defect (p = 0.029). The mean value of the uNGAL/uCreatinine (uCr) was 20.5(0.35-105.42). Urinary NGAL/uCr, which had a photon defect, was 19.3(1.92-43.11) and 21.6 (0.35-105.42)  in no photon defect (p=0.573).

Mirabegron was started at median 12.3 (IQR: 7.5-16.0) years. Pre-Mirabegron urodynamic study was performed at median 12.1 (IQR: 7.1-15.8) years. All of them were on anticholinergic medication before Mirabegron treatment. Pre-Mirabegron urodynamic study was performed after washout period of an-Mirabegron, respectively (p=0.385). Among 39 total patients, vesicoureteral reflux was observed in 11 renal units in 7 patients before Mirabegron and 5 renal units in 5 patients after Mirabegron. : Mirabegron showed urodymic efficacy regarding maximal cystometry capacity and compliance in pediatric patients with spina bifida. Although it showed better MCC and compliance when compared with anticholinergics, it was not statistically significant.

Usually, penile metastasis signifies a poor prognosis but little else is known. The aim of this study is to systematically review all available literature on penile metastatic disease in order to gain more information on the presentation and prognosis of this manifestation of metastatic disease. and Methods: We reviewed the literature relating to all case reports, series and reviews about penile metastasis through a systematic Medline search. We identified 63 articles and 69 patients with an age range of 57 to 92 years and a mean follow up of 15.6 months (range 5-30). : Metastases were located on the root (38.8%), the shaft (38.8%) or the glans (22.4%) of the penis. In most cases the diagnosis of penile metastasis was made after the primary cancer had been diagnosed. A single small penile nodule was the most common presentation. Thirty patients with urological metastasis (43%) have a median cancer specific survival of 18 months instead 39 patients with non-urological metastasis (57%) have a median cancer specific survival of 11months. Ten patients presented with malignant priapism (5 from urological metastasis and 5 from non-urological metastasis). Median survival after the diagnosis of penile metastasis was 10 months (range 6-18 months). Patients with priapism from urological tumor have a median cancer specific survival of 30 months the patients with priapism from non-urological tumor have median cancer specific survival of 15 months. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients presenting with priapism and those with metastases from non-urologic tumors have a significantly worse prognosis (age adjusted Log Rank: p=0.037 for priapism vs no priapism and p=0.045 for urologic vs non-urologic).",

NICE guidelines state that those suspected of having urological cancer should be seen within 2 weeks from referral date. Firstly, what is the incidence of urological malignancy among those referred through the two weeks wait referral pathway. Secondly, association between different referral criteria and cancer diagnosis. Finally, the identification and characterisation of inappropriate referrals and way to improve this pathway. and Methods: Retrospective audit data was collected from Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals two week wait urological cancer referral list for the past 12 months. A sample of 250 patients was selected from the first referral date of 2016. : Bladder & renal cancer: Fifty seven percent of the referrals made were for bladder & renal cancer while 26% of cancers diagnosed were bladder/renal. The most number of referrals were due to visible haematuria and 7.6% of these were found to have cancer. Two out of the 7 referrals for palpable renal mass/ renal mass found on ultrasound scan were found to be malignant. Interestingly, there were no cancer diagnoses found in referrals made for 'haematuria with persistent urinary tract infection' and 'unexplained non-visible haematuria' . Prostate cancer: Thirty two percent of referrals made were for prostate while 69% of the cancers diagnosed were prostrate; the majority of urological cancers identified. The majority of referrals were due to raised age-related PSA. The minimum PSA values as set out by the NICE guidelines did not miss any cancers in any given age group. Testicular cancer: Out of the 21 referrals are made and 2 cancers were identified (9.5% detection rate). Penile cancer: Two referrals were made with no cancers identified. There is subjectivity with interpretation of 'ulceration in the glans or prepuce' . : Out of the 250 referrals made via this pathway 17% were cancer diagnoses, excluding the 10% that were lost to follow up.

The objective of this work is to analyse the experience of a tertiary hospital concerning the diagnosis, treatment and survival of patients with penile cancer. January 2006 and June 2016. The risk factors, pathological data, surgeries and adjuvant treatments were evaluated. The average age was 67.3 \u00b1 14 years, with lesions with 3.2 \u00b1 1.7 cm. 3.4% were HIV positive, 16.9% were HPV positive and 44.1% had phimosis. In terms of premalignant lesions, it was found erythroplasia of Queyrat (3.4%), balanitis xerotica obliterans (10.4%) and Bowen disease (1.7%). : The most frequent initial surgery was partial penectomy (67.8%), followed by the radical circumcision (16.9%) and local excision (6.8%). There was a significant correlation between biopsy and surgery specimen report (p <0.001): both reveals squamous cell carcinoma (96.6% vs 93.2%), T3 (38.9%) and T1 (31.5%), well differentiated (61.5%). Eighty-eight percent had negative surgical margins. Inguinal lymphadenectomy has been done in 41% and 8.5% has also performed pelvic lymphadenectomy: 14 \u00b1 10 nodes were excised, being 1.2 \u00b1 2.3 nodes locally invaded by the tumor. Lymphadenectomy was not complete by surgical irresectability in 8.5%. Twenty two percent were submitted to another surgery: partial penectomy (53.8%) and total penectomy (38.5%). Chemotherapy was performed in 13.6% and radiotherapy in 5.1%. 33.9% have developed complications: mainly lymphedema (15.3%) and wound infection (13.6%). Metastasis have been developed in 44.1% mainly nodal (11.9%) and bone (11.9%). The factors that caused statistically significant differences in survival rates Conclusion: The advanced stage of the primary tumor, the presence of systemic metastasis and other pathological changes are factors that negatively influence the disease course.International Experience in the Management of Primary Penile Tumors Involving the Glans: Lessons Learned from A Multi-Center CollaborationIntroduction and Objective: Although management of penile squamous cell carcinoma has favoured penile sparing surgery, the optimal treatment strategy remains unknown for tumors involving the glans penis. We sought to analyse the local recurrence and survival outcomes of penile sparing surgery in patients with penile carcinoma with glans involvement. and Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 364 patients across 5 international tertiary referral centers between 2000 and 2013. All patients had tumors involving the glans penis. Management techniques included glansectomy, wide local excision, or laser ablation. Median follow-up was 40 months (IQR 15-72). : The median age was 62 years (IQR 51-71). 67% (244) had glans only involvement, 29% (107) had glans and prepuce involvement, and 4% (13) had glans and shaft involvement. 23% (82) underwent glansectomy, 34% (123) underwent laser ablation, and 44%",

We assessed the clinical outcomes of penile cancer patients treated with only laser ablation. and Methods: A retrospective review was performed of 160 patients across 5 multi-center tertiary referral centers from 2000 to 2013. All patients underwent penile sparing surgery with only laser ablation for squamous cell carcinoma of the penis. Laser ablation was performed with Neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet or carbon dioxide. Overall and recurrence free survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log rank test. : One hundred and fifty-six patients underwent laser ablation for penile cancer. The median age was 61 (IQR 52-71) years and median follow-up was 60.6 (IQR 32-92) months. The majority of patients were pTa/Tis (55, 35%) or pT1a (60, 39%). Only 20 (13%) had a poorly differentiated grade. The 5-year recurrence free survival was 46%. When stratified by stage, the 5-year local recurrence free survival was pTa/Tis: 53%; pT1a: 40%; pT1b: 33%; pT2: 52%. The inguinal/pelvic nodal recurrence was pTa/Tis: 0%; pT1a: 5%; pT1b: 17%; pT2: 22%. There were no differences among stages with respect to local recurrence free survival (p=0.93) or overall survival (p=0.2). : Laser ablation therapy is safe for appropriately selected patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma that are pT1a or lower.

Rectal GIST only accounts for 5% of GIST population. Progression of the tumor sometimes causes lower urinary tract symptoms such as frequency or urine retention that mimic prostate enlargement. The best management is combination of imatinib and surgical wide excision. and Methods: We reported three cases of rectal GIST with prostate invasion. The patient's' symptom, image, medication, peri-operative condition, pathological report and follow-up result were all recorded and analyzed. : Three patients with mean age of 65 (57-74) years old diagnosed GIST with prostate invasion. The initial complaint was lower urinary tract symptom such as frequency and incomplete sensation. Digital rectal exam found prostate mass in all cases. Elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was found only in one patient (PSA: 9.21) whom later diagnosed prostate adenocarcinoma, Gleason score: 3+4. Different diagnosis method was used: CT-guide biopsy, transanal biopsy, and transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy. The patients received imatinib 400 mg per day for average 6.6 months. Follow-up image study showed average 62.5 percent tumor volume decreased. We performed robotic prostatectomy and anterior rectal wall tumor resection. Estimated blood loss was about 100ml. Average operation time was around 400 minutes. Frozen sections were made during operation due to blurred margin between tumor and normal tissue. Surgical margin was negative in all cases.

They should be informed before surgery that SRS may cause temporary and/or permanent urinary symptoms that may lead to discomfort.The Role of Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation in Treatment of Men with Chronic Pelvic PainKraszewski M, Green L, Nair G Introduction and Objective: Chronic testicular pain / chronic prostatitis is a recognised condition which presents a challenge for urologists and pain specialists. It is a part of wider understood chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS). It is often associated with sexual, emotional and psychological consequences for the patients. Neuromodulation is a recognized form of treatment as per 2016 EAU guidelines on Chronic Pelvic Pain. We have evaluated the efficacy of Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS) in treatment of men diagnosed with with CPPS. and Methods: 18 male patients aged 25-80 (mean age 47.56 years) presented to our department with symptoms suggestive of chronic prostatitis ongoing for 1-20 years. No cause for their symptoms was found on imaging and/or cystoscopy and they did not improve on standard treatments (antibiotics, anticholinergics, alpha-blockers, analgesics and NSAIDs). They subsequently underwent treatment with PTNS (12x 30 min sessions in weekly intervals). Their pre-and post-treatment symptoms were assessed by means of NIH-Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) which focuses on three domains: pain (21 points), urinary symptoms (10 points) and quality of life impact (12 points). SD=2.52). 10/18 of treated patients (vs. 1/18 before treatment) replied to the quality of life question that they would be delighted, pleased or satisfied if they symptoms were to continue for the rest of their life. : Although the evidence is still limited, PTNS appears to be an effective modality of treatment for men with CPPS. Further follow up for those patients is required to evaluate long-term efficacy and larger volume studies need to be undertaken but the results from this cohort are promising.About A New Case of a Seminal Vesicle Cyst: Endoscopic ApproachRebai N, Rekhis A, Masmoudi A, Smaoui W, Touaiti T, Hajslimen M, Mhiri MNDept. of Urology, CHU Habib Bourguiba, Sfax, TunisiaIntroduction and Objective: Seminal vesicle cyst associated with ipsilateral renal agenesis is a congenital malformation. The number of cases in the literature does not exceed 200cases. It was ZIENNER in 1914 who presented the first case. Through a literature review and a new observation, our objective is to determine the etiopathogenic, clinical and paraclinic characteristics of seminal vesicle cysts and to detail the modalities of endoscopic treatment in this type of cyst. and Methods: Mr T. A, 48 years old, consults for symptoms of low obstructive urinary tract associated with erectile dysfunction without ejaculation disorder neither haemospermian or post pain ejaculatory. The TR objectives a mass with smooth surface having a convex shape, an elastic consistency sometimes flaccid, sometimes stretched, masking the left lobe of the prostate; The right lobe is hardly palpable. On ultrasound, the left side of the prostate base is the site of a liquid multilocular formation developing on depends of the left vesiculo-deferential intersection with a moderate hypertrophy of the median prostate lobe. : Uroscanner shows left renal agenesis with a spontaneously hyperdense left lateral-prostatic and retro-vesical formation, multiloculated, with irregular shape, measuring 56x65 mm, not enhancing after injection of contrast product, corresponding to the embryonic vestige of the vesiculo-deferential intersection. Prostatic MRI shows a dilatation of the seminal vesicule and dilated left ejaculatory channel with hypo signal T1, hyper signal T2. An alpha blocker treatment was ineffective. We opted then for transurethral surgery that consisted of cystoscopy and cervicoprostatic incision with transurethrale section of the prostatic base and the left lobe until the capsule. The postoperative was simple with disappearance of micturition disorders with an average follow-up of 19 months.",

Most of the patients (90.2%) had symptoms due to prostatic cancer. A high Gleason score(\u22678), T3-T4 category tumor and distant metastases (bone 34, extra-regional lymph node 19, lung 4, liver 1) were identified in 83.8\uff05, 95.1% and 97.3% of the patients, respectively. The median follow-up period was 37.3 months (range 1-176.4 months). All the patients were treated with androgen deprivation therapy(ADT). Primary ADT consisted of combined androgen blockade(CAB) in 37 cases (90.2%), uncombined luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy in 1 cases (2.4%), and uncombined LHRH antagonist therapy in 3 cases (7.3%). Five-year PSA failure-free survival rate and 5-year overall survival rate were 30% and 50%, respectively.GS; Gleason score, ADT; antiandrogen therapy, RP; radical prostatectomy, RT; radiation therapy, CH; chemotherapy, ENZ; enzalutamide, Ox; surgical castration, LNM: lymph node metastases SD; stable disease, PD; progressive disease, NSIC; no significant interval change, NL; new lesion, TL; target lesion UP.340,Table 1. Summary of Bone Scan and T1-And DW-MR Imaging in Study Cohort (N=14) 37th CONGRESS OF THE SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9 INTERNATIONALE D'UROLOGIE -SIU 2017 ABSTRACT BOOK Conclusion: When the serum PSA level is already above 1000 ng/ml, clinical study reveals T3-T4 tumor and the Gleason score is 8-10, then such a tumor is invariably metastatic. Although many patients had PSA failure and their prognosis was poor, long-term PSA failure-free survival was achieved in some patients. We need to ascertain the precise prognostic marker to ADT.RatioInitial PSA and Pretreatmet PSA in CRPC Are Prognostic Factors in Patients with Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Takeda H, Koga Y, Nakano Y Tosei General Hospital, Seto, Japan Introduction and Objective: Predictive factors of prognosis in pre or post-treated patients with abiraterone acetate (AA) and enzalutamide (ENZ) for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Abiraterone acetate (AA) and enzalutamide (ENZ) are new generation hormonal agents (NHA) which demonstrated a survival gain in patients (pts) with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) pre-or post-treated with docetaxel.Although all patients eventually became resistant to these NHAs, some of them show primary resistance, defined as an early progression within the first 3 months, which leads to an early treatment interruption. In the present analysis, we have tried to identify which factor, if any, may predict primary resistance to AA and ENZ. and Methods: We evaluated a consecutive series of 52 pts, treated in our hospital: 14 received AA (1,000 mg po + prednisone 10 mg po daily) and 38 ENZ (160 mg po daily). For each pt we have recorded the pre-and post-NHA clinical history, the treatment details and outcomes. We have also assessed the ability of a series of 24 selected clinical factors to predict NHAs resistance, through a logistic regression analysis. Ratio initial PSA and pretreatmet PSA in CRPC is defined as cPSA-R. Continuous variables we are categorized by quartiles and chosen for the initial model after a univariate chi-square analysis. : Among the 24 factors, the presence of ALP, Hb and visceral, cPSA-R 10% were predictive of prognosis at the univariate analysis. However, only cPSA-R 10% were confirmed at the multivariate analysis [exp (beta) 0.115; p = 0.007]. : Our results suggest that ratio initial PSA and pretreatment PSA in CRPC are prognostic factors in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer These data should be confirmed in a larger patient population.Factors Predicting Skeletal-Related Events in Patients with Bone Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate CancerTakeda H, Koga Y, Nakano Y Tosei General Hospital, Seto, Japan Introduction and Objective: Skeletal-related events (SREs) are common complications of bone metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). To the authors' knowledge, there are limited data regarding which factors predict SREs. We identified risk factors for SREs in men with bone mCRPC using characteristics commonly available in the medical record. and Methods: In all, 210 patients with prostate cancer awaiting initiation of androgen-deprivation therapy due to metastases were included. Among these men, 70 developed bone metastases during follow-up and represented the study. First occurrence of an SRE was abstracted from the medical records.A stepwise multivariable Cox model was used to select the strongest predictors of time to SRE. BSI was obtained using the BONENAVI version2 \u00ae FUJI film 99m Tc-MDP Results: The median age of the patients at the time of diagnosis of bone mCRPC was 75 years (interquar-The area under the curve for a multivariable model based upon these risk factors was 0.744. : We identified several significant predictors of SREs among men with mCRPC. In particular, men with bone pain&BSI>1 are at high risk of an SRE.If confirmed, future trials should focus on prolonging life and reducing SRE risk in patients with mCRPC with bone pain.",

Prognostic factors tend to include operative PSA, margin status, lymph node involvement and biochemical recurrence. Is pre-operative PSA predictive of these factors in high risk disease? Materials and Methods: A prospective database of 707 chronological RARPs (single centre, single surgeon) was reviewed for high risk disease, pre-operative PSA, positive margin status, lymph node positivity and biochemical recurrence. The overall biochemical free recurrence rate (PSA <0.05 ng/ml) was 94.4%. : Pre operative PSA is an indicator of biochemical recurrence post operatively. There is no association between PSA and margin status or lymph node positivity.Introduction and Objective: Prostate cancer is gradually reaching a very high incidence in Africa, especially Sub-Saharan region. The alarming prevalence in the Sub-Saharan region must be met with effective public health programs to reduce the incidence. Reducing the paucity of database on prostate cancer is the aim of current study by assessing the incidence at Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana. and Methods: All prostate cancer cases recorded from 2009 to 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Subjects from 40 years and above were eligible for screening. Diagnostic and screening tools for prostate cancer at the study site were family history, serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, digital rectal examination, Urological ultrasound scan and histopathology (biopsy). Age, PSA values and year of screening/diagnosis were retrieved from patient folders/archives. Histological findings considered in present study were diagnosis, carcinoma grading, perineural invasion (PNI) and percentage of affected tissues (%TA). : Prostate cancer constituted 236 cases (40.07%) of 589 prostate diseases recorded. The highest annual prevalence was recorded in 2014 with incidence rate of 51 cases (21.6%). The ages ranged from 46 to 101 years, modal age range was 70-79 years (71.7 \u00b1 11.2). The mean PSA of present study was 37.5ng/ml (\u00b168.9) predominantly within the range 11-20.9ng/ml (27.9%). Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma was the dominant grade accounting for 61.4% (145 cases). There was a significant correlation (p=0.001) between grading of prostate cancer and perineural invasion. Only 21.2% graded cancer cases had perineural invasion with >50% affected tissues found in half of them. : There is high incidence rate of prostate cancer in Ghana (40.07%). Ghanaian men between the ages of 60 to 79 years are mostly diagnosed of advanced prostatic carcinoma, most especially moderately differentiated. Reported cases usually showed high %TA and PNI.37th CONGRESS OF THE SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9 INTERNATIONALE D'UROLOGIE -SIU 2017 ABSTRACT BOOK Introduction and Objective:",

In our work we evaluated the disparity between PC diagnosed as Gleason 8 on biopsy and their actual pathology after radical prostatectomy (RP). and Methods: Between 2010-2016, 560 men underwent open RP. 41 men were diagnosed with Gleason 8 pathology on prostate biopsy. Biopsy and RP pathology were compared and Student's t-test, Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used for statistical analysis. : 56.1% (23/41) of clinical Gleason 8 diagnoses on biopsy were downgraded after RP on histopathology analysis. There were 22 specimens downgraded to Gleason 7 (Gleason 3+4 n=12; Gleason 4+3 n = 10) and 1 was downgraded to Gleason 6. Pathology downgrading is significantly associated with lower PSA at biopsy (media 4.47 vs 12.9 ng/mL, p<0.03) and with extracapsular extension (38.1% vs 61.9%, p<0.02). It is strongly associated with lower percentage of positive margins (26.7% vs 73.3%). Seminal vesical invasion, age and clinical staging were not associated with pathology downgrading.",

Time-Series Cohort Descriptive Data Introduction and Objective:Information about how men with prostate cancer perceive their medical care and factors associated with their overall satisfaction with care (OSC) are scarce. Our objective is to assess OSC in men with low-risk prostate cancer, determine factors associated with OSC and whether these differ between treatments. and Methods: All Swedish men, 70 years or younger, diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer in 2008 was invited to this survey (n=1720). In total, 1288 (74.9%) responded. A questionnaire with study-specific questions and EPIC-26 evaluated demographics, concurrent diseases, functional outcomes, experiences at diagnosis and at follow-up visits. One study specific question addressed OSC on a seven-point visual digital scale. Data was analysed using ordinal logistic regression, comparing highest versus lowest levels of exposure variables. : High OSC (6 or 7 on the seven-point visual digital scale) was reported by 959 (74.5%) patients. Participation in decision-making (OR=3.85, CI=2.35-6.30), information given by medical personnel (OR=10.81, CI=7.74-15.08) and quality of information received (OR=7.84, CI=5.42-11.35) was associated with OSC. Higher functional outcome, evaluated by EPIC-26 was weakly associated with OSC (OR=1.34, CI=1.22-1.48). Nurse navigators improved OSC (OR=1.79, CI=1.42-2.25). We found no difference in OSC whether doctors or specialist nurses performed follow-up (OR=0.83, CI=0.65-1.05). There was no difference in variables associated with OSC between treatment groups. Patients who underwent active treatment reported higher OSC (OR=1.36, CI=1.08-1.70), participation in decision-making (OR=2.20, CI=1.72-2.81) and information about treatment (OR=1.78, CI=1.42-2.24) compared to patients in active surveillance. : Overall satisfaction in prostate cancer care is high. Our findings stress the responsibility health care providers have to provide high quality information and to facilitate patients' participation in decision-making. Further development of the nurse navigator role, e.g. during follow-up may improve OSC. There is room for improvement in participation in decision-making and information about treatment for men under active surveillance.",

We explored whether explantation for declining efficacy is associated with symptom severity or other patient characteristics. and Methods: We reviewed patients in our prospective database that had an implantable pulse generator (IPG) placed. Those that were eventually explanted for declining symptoms were propensity matched 1:2 with non-explanted controls on age, gender, lead location, primary indication for implant, and length of follow up. History, baseline voiding diaries, and Interstitial Cystitis Symptom/Problem Index (ICSIPI) and Overactive Bladder symptom severity (OABq ss)/health related quality of life (HRQOL) at baseline and 3 months were compared between groups with Pearson's \u03c72 (Chi square), Fisher's Exact, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. : Fifty-two explanted patients were matched with 104 controls. Explants were performed at years1-6 in 19, 29, 39, 44, 49  and 52, respectively. Most in both groups had overactive bladder with urge incontinence. When compared, a lower proportion in the explanted group reported marked/moderate improvement in symptoms after lead placement and just prior to IPG implant (13/19; 68.5% vs. 58/63; 92.1%; p=0.016). After implant, more explanted patients had a complication (18/52; 34.6% vs. 3/104; 2.9%; p=0.0001). Explanted patients had more reprogrammings within the first year 1 year (median 2 vs. 0.5; p<0.0001). Baseline voiding diaries, and baseline and 3 month ICSIPI scores, did not differ between groups. Although the explanted group overall had better HRQOL scores at baseline, in just those patients that completed both baseline and 3 month measures there were no statistically significant differences at either time point between groups. In addition, the explanted group had fewer with hypertension (40.4% vs. 58.7%, p=0.031), fewer comorbidities (median 1 vs. 2, p=0.026), higher income (p=0.019), and more women on hormone replacement therapy (34.9% vs. 10.2%; p=0.0006) even though the proportions that were postmenopausal were similar. : Explanted patients had more comorbidities, complications, and lower rate of marked/moderate improvement after lead placement.

Patients with malignancy, pregnancy, medical renal disease, compromised renal function, uncontrolled diabetes, contrast allergy and incomplete follow-up were excluded. After obtaining baseline DMSA-renal scintigraphy, sclerosant (either 0.1%-povidine iodine or 1%-silver nitrate) was instilled 8-hourly on affected side. Patients received either 3-, 6-or 9-doses depending on response (clearance of chylous urine and patient's tolerance). DMSA-renal scan was repeated after 2-3 months of RPIS using the same protocol. Discrete variables were compared using Chi square test or Fischer's exact t-test. Continuous variables were compared using independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test. P value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.Results: Of 34 patients, 22 were males with mean age 41.08\u00b116.64 years. Mean followup was 8.94\u00b13.70 months and overall success rate was 85%. Before RPIS, mean differential renal function on unaffected renal unit was 50.76\u00b13.55% (range, 39.0%-57.0%) while that on affected renal unit (side of instillation) was 49.20\u00b13.44% (range, 43.0%-61.0%). After instillation therapy, mean differential renal function of the normal side was 52.26\u00b13.57% while that of affected renal unit was 47.50\u00b13.56% (range, 41.0% -54.0%). No patient had renal function changes of >5% from baseline. In two patients, post-instillation DMSA scan revealed a photopenic area at upper pole suggestive of scar. Complications were noted in 8 patients (either Clavein-Dindo grade I or II).Conclusions: This is first study that explores the role of renal functional imaging following RPIS with DMSA scan. On short-term followup, we noticed that there was slightly decreased relative renal function in most (74%) patients (not clinically significant). However, renal function remained within normal range. Renal function was not affected by RPIS. More studies with larger patient numbers and follow-up are needed.",

We compared the progression-free survival after docetaxel chemotherapy and 2nd line hormone therapy.Results: Docetaxel chemotherapy was administered in average 28 months after first treatment including primary ADT. Median number of 6 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy were done in both group. In ADT group, orchiectomy was performed in 18 patients and LHRH agonist was injected in 10 patients. During docetaxel chemotherapy, PSA progression-free survival was statistically different (6.0 \u00b14.75 months in ADT group versus 4.8 \u00b13.2months in no-ADT group, p=0.024). However, radiologic progression-free survival was not statistically different (5.0 \u00b13.12 months in ADT group vs 5.0 \u00b12.79 months in no-ADT group, p=0.387).Conclusion: In our cohort, a continuous addition of ADT showed the significant benefit in PSA progression-free survival during the docetaxel chemotherapy in CRPC patients.

It shares histological features with lung SCC (SCCl) and presents as an extensive local disease, visceral disease, low PSA levels despite the advanced metastatic disease, rapid progression and unresponsiveness to hormonal blockade (HT). The average time of SCCp development in patients with CaP history is about 18-25 months. The staging is similar to CaP and the evolution implies a regular follow-up by thoracoabdominal-pelvic CT / MRI and bone scintigraphy. SCCp is treated the same way SCCl does. They are both chemosensitive with dim prognosis due to their aggressiveness.",

He didn\u00b4t do HT. Regular semianually follow-up was done, with PSA nadir of 0.77 ng/ml, 5 years after BT (2009) . According to Phoenix criteria, the biochemical failure (PSA 2.77 ng/ml) was declared in August 2014. In May 2014, the patient reported the appearance of several hard, firm and painless penile nodes (0.5 cm in diameter). In September 2014 biopsies of these nodules and of the prostate were made, which showed the same histological result in both: SCCp with penile metastization. A prostatic G8 (4 + 4) focus was also identified at prostate level. CT and Bone Scintigraphy showed multiple scattered adenopathies, hepatic, pulmonary and axial skeletal metastases. In October 2014, he started QT and 3 months later he developed an urethro-rectal fistula.Results: The patient died in March 2015 at 52 years old.Conclusion: SCCp is a rare and aggressive subtype of prostate carcinoma. It doesn\u00b4t usually respond to HT and the progression of the disease is not associated with PSA increases. As SCCl, SCCp is chemosensitive. However, given its rarity, a specific treatment is not standardized.

We also evaluated PSA change rate at 3 months after AA treatment started, and evaluated whether PSA change rate at 3 months can prognose the progression free survival rate with AA treatment.Results: Mean PSA at diagnosis was 90 (0.96-11570) . Mean age at starting AA was 77 (55-92). Mean PSA when starting AA was 18.42 (0.101-4028.07). Sixty-five percent of the patients had metastasis. Ten patients showed grade 3 side effects and 16 patients had to change treatment due to side effects. Evaluation of treatment duration and patient characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Lower serum ALP level and PSA when starting AA showed a longer treatment duration. Comparison of responders and non-responders are showed that the number of former treatment was the strongest factor for responders. When compared by PSA change rate at 3 months, patients who decreased 50% and patients who increased 30% showed a significant difference.Conclusion: Good patient conditions and short former treatment was a factor of long duration with AA.

Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Numerical and categorical variables were assessed using Student's t-test, Mann Whitney U test, Chi-square or Fisher's exact when appropriate. A two-tailed significance level of 0.05 was used for all tests.Results: Among 108 patients with medical hormonal treatment and 51 patients who underwent bilateral orchidectomy, there was no significant difference between their baseline characteristics in terms of age, race, Charlson comorbidity index score and baseline PSA at initial disease presentation. Time to reach nadir-PSA was 7.5 months after initiation of medical hormonal therapy and 6.8 months after bilateral orchidectomy (p=0.077). Median time to reach cas-trate-resistance was 12.1 months in medical therapy group and 17.6 months in surgical group (p=0.087).There is no evidence to suggest that either medical or surgical castration affects the risk of cardiovascular events (p >0.999) or skeletal events (p=0.556).

Since the appearance of drugs such as androgen receptor inhibitors, the treatment of metastatic disease has ceased to suppose the end of following-up these patients. We present the experience of our center in the management of these molecules in elderly patients. . We compared the tumor area with the non-tumor area of the same patient. The samples studied were separated into three groups according to the Gleason grade: Gleason 4 to 6 (n=45), Gleason 7 (n=64) and Gleason 8 to 10 (n=24). The Gleason 7 group was subdivided into two subgroups: 3 + 4 and 4 + 3. We analyzed the following elements of the extracellular matrix: collagen fibers, elastic system, smooth muscle fibers, blood vessels, and nerves. The tumor area and non-tumor area of the TMA (tissue microarray) were photographed. The images were analyzed using the ImageJ software (NIH, USA).",

Protocols that guide PB often differ from one urological unit to another and there is no unified protocol for PB in Nigeria. We present a survey of PB protocols among a cohort of Nigerian urologists aimed to determine and/or highlight any differences in pre-procedural preparation, PB procedure and post-procedural management. The re-introduction of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) into the care process of men with prostate cancer has led to the need for the definition of its utility and limitations in clinical practice.

Of these, less than 50% of patients displayed the target site as the largest core of prostate cancer, but more than 75% of target lesions biopsied were revealed as the location for the highest Gleason grade pathology. Two patients that underwent targeted biopsy did not reveal cancer in any sites. Of the patients that underwent standard template biopsies, prostate cancer (Gleason 6) was revealed in 50% of patients with only one patient displaying higher-grade carcinoma (Gleason 4+3).

Clinical and analytical predictive models were created incorporating PHI .Receptor operative characteristics (ROC) curves, Logistic regression, calibration plots, scatter plots and decision curve analysis were performed to achieve clinical utility of PHI.Results: 72/172 (42%) men were diagnosed of prostate cancer and 33/72 (46%) were diagnosed with high grade disease. PHI score was the most predictive of biopsy outcomes in terms of discriminative ability (AUC=0.79) and added a gain in predictive accuracy of 17%. All models that incorporated PHI worked better in terms of calibration close to 45\u00ba on the slope. In the decision curve analysis for the midrange thresh-old probabilities between 20 and 45%, the model with PHI was superior to other models with the best benefit between 30 to 35% threshold probability, avoiding 82 biopsies, losing only 16 tumors and 7 high grade tumors (figure 1a and 1b and table 1) .Conclusions: PHI score is a more discriminant biomarker, has superior calibration and superior net benefit and provide a higher rate of biopsies avoided thus, it can be useful to make a more informed decision in each patient.",

The radiological studies showed a great tumoral mass (160x90x80mm) occupying the prostate bed with displacement and infiltration of neighboring anatomical structures. Anatomopathological explorations showed undifferentiated round-cells separated by dense fibrous stroma. These neoplastic cells were immunoreactive for cytokeratins (AE1/3, CK7), PSA, Myogenin...confirming the desmoplastic aspect of this tumor.Results: Imatinib 600mg/day was administered to the patient for three months improving his clinical signs together with the stabilization of the tumoral lesions. The patient is subjected to Cisplatin 175 mg/ m2 chemotherapy waiting to assess the feasibility of chemotherapy and ultimately hoped the excision of the tumoral prostatic mass.Conclusion: DSRCT is very invasive with a poor prognosis since patients are succumbing to disease within the first two years of diagnosis. The therapeutic arsenal includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Combining treatment strategies can improve the survival but the overall prognosis remains very poor.",

Traditionally during VCUG, the female patient is asked to void in the supine position after contrast instillation in the bladder. In many cases, the patient is unable to urinate in such position terminating the maneuver without diagnosis. Our hypothesis is that squatting position is the best way to do VCUG in females as it is considered natural voiding position.In this study, we aimed to improve the effectiveness of VCUG and diagnostic accuracy by asking the females to void in the squatting position under fluoroscopy.Materials and Methods: Three female with age range of 48 to 68 years with suspected urethral strictures underwent uroflow and post-void residue assessment. After cleaning and draping the genital region with Betadine, a small feeding tube (6F) is passed through the urethra into the bladder followed by instillation of contrast media. When the urinary bladder is full, the patients were asked to void in the supine position. When the patients failed to void, they were asked to urinate in the squatting position. Images were taken during fluoroscopy. After VCUG, urethrocystoscopy was done to verify the findings of the urethrography. Oral antibiotic was given before procedure.",

These two groups were compared according to their kidney functions, graft and patient survivals, mortality and morbidity, and the frequency of urinary tract infections (UTI).Results: There was normal graft function in 19 of group A and 12 of group B during a mean follow-up of 125 months. The mean serum creatinine in the follow-up was 1.85\u00b10.21, 1.41\u00b10.12 in groups A and B, respectively. Number of episodes of febrile UTI requiring hospitalization was 37 and 9 in groups A and B, respectively. UTI and urosepsis were significantly more frequent in group A than groups B (p<0.05). Graft loss was seen in 8 patients of group A (5 due to chronic rejection and 3 of recurrent pyelonephri-tis) and 4 of group B (all due to chronic rejection). Eleven patients of group A but one patient in group B required clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) for bladder emptying.

The penises of the offspring were dissected and processed for analysis of the total area (A), corpus cavernous area (CC) with and without tunica albuginea (TA), TA, corpus spongiosum (CS), Dorsal artery (DA), lumen and tunica media of DA, nuclear density in the tunica media of AD, deep dorsal vein (DDV) area. We quantified in percentage the connective tissue, smooth muscle, sinusoidal spaces, elastic fibers, cell proliferation, vessels and nerves in CC, CS and dorsal region (DR). Data were expressed as mean and standard deviation, unpaired t-test and significant p <0.05.Results: In VitD-: The areas A (-5.45%; p=0.0083), CC with TA (-7%, p=0.0007) and without TA (-5.7%, p=0.0133), TA (-8.55%; p=0.0001) decreased.

Our patients belong to various socio-professional categories. Fifteen patients had a history of genital infections. Seven men presented acute urethritis presumed to be gonococci. Eight women had recurrent genital candida, 4 of which were associated with trichomonas and 1 with gonococcus and chlamydia. All women denied having sex before marriage, while 13 of the 14 men had multiple partners, two of whom had homo and heterosexual relationships. The complaint was mostly non-sexual, only 5 of our patients presented a sexual reason for consultation. Affective reactions were present in two-thirds of our patients and mental disorders in three-quarters of them while the announcement of the sexual transmissibility of the disease. Anxiety has been found in half of the cases. 11 patients had the sexual disorders often associated or generated by psycho-affective disorders.Conclusion: Genital candylomas are a source of embarrassment, shame and mistrust. Prevention is crucial and requires a sex education program.",

Patients having single radio-opaque proximal ureteral stone >8mm above the level of L3 transverse was only included for the study and were randomized into two groups. Group 1 patients (n = 250) were followed with classical conservative approach and patients in Group 2 (n = 250) additionally received tamsulosin, 0.4 mg/ Results: Out of 500 patients, there were 350 males (70%) and 150 females (30%). Age range was 23-55 years. The two groups were well balanced in terms of baseline patient and stone characteristics. Average stone size was (range 8-1.2 mm) The Stone expulsion rates didn't showed any significant difference between tamsulosin receivers and non-receivers (35% vs 33%). But the time to stone expulsion period was shortened in those receiving tamsulosin (8.4 +/-3.3 vs 11.6 +/-4.1 days). Likewise renal colic episodes during follow-up period were significantly diminished in Group 2 patients (66% vs 36%) and hospitalisation (25% vs 33%).Conclusions: Studies have shown that tamsulosin is a safe and effective drug that enhances spontaneous passage of ureteric stones. But our study tamsulosin was not much effective for stone (>8mm) locate in the proximal ureter (above the level of L3 transverse process).though it was effective in controlling the colic pain and shortening the time period for stone expulsion. Our study suggested that patient with stone size >8mm above the level of L3 transverse process if not responded to tamsulsoin after 5 days, then should go for the definitive treatment.

Absence of ureteric dilation was diagnosed, if the kidney showed no hyrocalicosis or hydronephrosis and the ureter appeared not dilated on US of KUB, IVU or CT of KUB. We studied the anatomy of the renal pelvis in such patients to find out whether the presence of intra-renal pelvis predisposed to the non-dilatation of the pyelo-ureter, even though such ureters contained significant stone burden.Results: Thirty eight patients were found to have significant calculus in their ureters without any dilatation of the calyces or the ureters on radiological imaging. Their mean age was 38.6 years with 36 (94.7%) being males and 2 (5.3%) females. Thirty five (92.1%) and 3 (7.9%) patients had intra-renal pelvis and extra-renal pelvis respectively. The location of the calculus in the ureter was found in the upper third (4 patients, 10.5%), mid-third (1 patient, 2.6%) and lower third (33 patients, 86.8%).Conclusion: There may be a significant calculus in the ureter without dilatation of the renal pelvis, calyces or the ureter if the renal pelvis is intra-renal as opposed to it being extra-renal in location. This may be another rationale to proceed to CT KUB as the radiological imaging of choice for patients presenting with acute flank pain and in whom urolithiasis is highly suspected.",

Majority were mixed stones (71%) predominantly calcium stone (84%). Gender based urine metabolite data analysis suggested that hypercalciuria was predominantly seen in males (p value < 0.001); and hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia and hypomagnesuria were seen predominantly in females (p value <0.001 for each metabolite). Among patients with congenitally abnormal kidney (n=37) most common stones encountered were calcium oxalate stones and most common metabolic abnormality encountered was hyperoxaluria followed by hypercalciuria. Specific metabolic abnormalities were observed with each type of stone. (Table) Conclusion: There was a significant gender based difference in terms of association with metabolic abnormalities. Mixed stones are more common than pure stones. Certain metabolic abnormalities show strong correlation with the predominant stone composition. Stone analysis alone can give us an idea about the probable metabolic defect and thus it may form guideline for simplified metabolic work-up. Stone analysis thus forms an integral part of metabolic evaluation.",

The renal access technique was similar in both studies with nephrostomy tract dilatation carried out to 10-14 F. The lithotripsy was performed using pneumatic lithotripter. A nephrostomy tube or JJ stent was placed only if clinically indicated. The perioperative outcome variables were extracted, analyzed and compared to the multi-center study conducted by Zeng et al. 2016. Independent samples t-test was used to compare perioperative outcome of subjects by their demographic and clinical characteristics. One-sample t-test and one proportion z test were utilised to compare perioperative outcomes between the two studies.

We wanted to see whether this is reflected in the publication trend and did a comprehensive PubMed database search for the 'use of laser in kidney stone intervention' over the last 16-years. There were no language restrictions and all non-English language papers with published English abstracts were also included in our review. While review articles were included, case reports and those papers that did not have a published abstract were excluded from our analysis. Data was divided into two 8-year periods, period-1 (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) and period-2 (2008-2015) .Results: During the last 16-years, a total of 406 papers have been published on lasers for stone surgery, including 363 (89%) English language and 43 Non-English language articles. There seems to be a steep rise in the articles published since 2010 (p<0.001) ( Figure  1 ). When comparing the two time periods, there were 124 papers published in period-1, which had more than doubled (increase of 126%) to 281 papers in period-2 (p<0.02). The number of English/Non-English language articles in period-1 and period-2 were 112/13 and 251/30 articles respectively, suggesting a rise of around 125% and 130% in the study period.Conclusions: Published papers on laser for stone surgery has increased over the last 2-decades confirming it to be a preferred modality of stone fragmentation. This reflects not only an increase of flexible ureteroscopy but also a renewed interest in the minimally invasive percutaneous renal stone surgery both of which use laser as their mode of fragmentation.",

Endoscopic surgery of ureteral calculi is one of the multiple possible treatments of this condition. After completing the fragmentation of the stone, one must consider placing a ureteral stent that warrants urine drainage in case a new obstruction develops from stone fragments or post-instrumentation mucosal edema. The placement of a double loop stent is frequent but may lead to significant morbidity, namely discomfort, pain, infection, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), hematuria and incrustation, which may occur in a big proportion of patients (10-85%). The objective of this work was to compare the post-surgical morbidity associated with the use of two different ureteral stents (single vs. double loop) after endoscopic treatment of ureteral lithiasis.",

All patients had one or more risk factors for IV-CM adverse effect as stated above. All patients were treated on an outpatient basis under analgesia and light sedation if required. The patient prepared the genitalia in an aseptic manner with the supine position on the lithotripsy table. A ureteral catheter was inserted into the ureteral orifice using 17Fr 'cystoscopy and RGU was performed by injecting diluted contrast media. Contrast medium was injected with as little pressure as possible to prevent the stone upward migration. The filling defect area was aligned to the F2 zone and then lithotripsy was done in the same manner as a conventional ESWL. One to two weeks later, CT scan was performed and additional ESWL was performed if a stone was present. Stone free was defined as the absence of residual stones on CT scan.",

The predisposing factors were moderate-severe hydronephrosis, thin renal cortex, prolonged operative duration, hypertension, and preoperative urinary tract infection (UTI). The management strategy varied from conservative management with blood transfusion and antibiotics (n = 22, 55%) to percutaneous drainage (n = 11, 27.5%). Surgical intervention was needed in seven (17.5%) patients. Two of these were emergency angiography of which one proceeded to open nephrectomy. Open surgery with clot removal was done in three patients, nephrostomy for severe hydronephrosis in one patient, and surgery to correct malpositioned stent in one patient. There was one mortality reported, wherein a patient who had postangiography nephrectomy died of multiple organ failure after the intervention.Conclusion: URS related PRH is a rare, but potentially life threatening complication with a small risk of renal loss. Although most cases may be managed conservatively, incidence of PRH can be minimized by control of blood pressure, treatment of preoperative UTI, and reduction in intrarenal pressures and operative time duration.",

Extracorporal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) is more and more replaced by endoscopic procedures like ureteroscopy (URS) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). SWL is still recommended as first line treatment for children with ureteral stones. However, SWL is not promising for stones > 10 mm in diameter, for impacted stones, calcium oxalate monohydrate or cystine stones. In these selected cases ureteroscopy with smaller caliber instruments should be used. With regard to kidney stones the indications for PCNL are similar in adult and pediatric patients (stone diameter > 20mm).",

The stones were removed endoscopically either using ureteroscopy (URS 4.5 F or 6.5/8.5 F), mini-PCNL (mPCNL 15 F) or ultra-mini PCNL (UMP11/13 F) respectively.Results: Endoscopic stone treatment (75x URS, 39x mPCNL/UMP) in children with stone disease, especially complex stones or stones resistant to SWL, is safe and effective. Primary stone-free rate of URS was 93%, of mPCNL/UMP 94%. Second look procedures or retreatment was required in 28.1%. The median stone size was 13.1mm for mPCNL/UMP (6mm -25mm) and 6.2mm for URS (1mm -15mm). The overall mean hospital stay for mPCNL/UMP was 8.0 days (2 -19 days) and for URS 5.9 days (1 -8 days). Complications and complication-rate was comparable to those in adults: three children developed fever (temperature >38.5\u00b0C), one child needed intensive care treatment for 3 days due to hyponatremic hypervolemia post-operatively. We did neither observe severe bleeding nor the need for transfusion after URS or PCNL.Conclusions: Endoscopic stone therapy in pediatric patients should be recommended as first option in complex situations where SWL does not seem to be promising. Children should be referred to specialized stone centers, where special smaller sized scopes and armamentarium are available. Subsequent metabolic evaluation is essential.",

            "text": "Fifty three patients had single stage PCNL. Single stage PCNL involved percutaneous nephrolithotomy with extraction of all stones and management of diverticular neck or cavity or both. Twenty seven of these patients (Gp1) had PCNL, with opening of diverticular neck by cold knife, laser or dilatation and putting of DJ stent with or without PCN tube. Eighteen patients (Gp2) had fulguration of cavity with drainage by PCN tube. Eight patients (Gp3) had PCNL with drainage by PCN tube and no treatment of diverticular neck or cavity. Symptomology, imaging modality, type of procedure, complications and follow-up with success and failures rates of different techniques were studied.Results: Pain (90%) was the most common symptom. IVU was done in 20 cases and CT was done in 33 patients. Mean age was 43 years with 29 females and 24 males. Thirty patients had upper pole diverticulum followed by midpole in 15 and lower pole In percutaneous group (Gp3), two patients had secondary PCN and 1 had partial nephrectomy because of symptoms, and failure of cavity to collapse. Stone clearance was maximum in Gp1 and diverticular obliteration was in Gp 2. Post-operative follow-up was by Ultrasound and Xray KUB or CT scan. Out of 53 patients, 2 patients had pneumothorax, 3 patients had residual stones. Overall, stone free rate of 95% and cavity obliteration of 80% was achieved in percutaneous group.Conclusions: Treatment of caliceal diverticulum involves management of stones and the cavity. Percutaneous management can achieve excellent stone free rate. Single stage PCNL followed by treatment of diverticular neck /cavity fetches good dividends in terms of stone clearance and diverticular cavity obliteration. Laser incision of diverticular neck with stenting after stone clearance is safest of three percutaneous types. Failures are more in patients with no treatment of wall and neck.",

Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL), retrograde intra-renal surgery (RIRS) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) are the most used techniques in the management of kidney stones. The European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines recommends that kidney stones >2cm should be treated with PNL unless other contraindication. EAU also advises that PNL may be a surgical technique used to solve kidney lower pole calculi <2cm whenever other approaches are not feasible. SWL is preferably used for <2cm stones with favourable anatomic characteristics in the upper and middle calyx. RIRS is recommended for smaller stones (<2cm) which can't be solved with other techniques since severe complication (Clavien-Dindo grades III to V) and stone-free rates are less attractive than with the other techniques. Final decision should take in consideration stone-free probability, complication-associated rate and surgeon experience.",

There was no statistical difference between groups regarding age and gender. All clinical cases were reviewed and all of them were treated according to EAU guidelines. Half of the patients were submitted to SWL. Medium stone size was 10,4mm for SWL, 12.4mm for RIRS and 30.7mm for PNL. Stone-free rates were 61.4% for SWL, 72% for RIRs and 77% for PNL without significant differences between groups (p>0.05). Only grade II Clavien-Dindo classification complications were identified during follow-up (19% of SWL, 10% of RIRS and 14% of PNL).Conclusion: ESWL, RIRS and PNL were successful in treating renal lithiasis.

All English language articles reporting on outcomes of BS-URS for urolithiasis were included. Two reviewers independently extracted the data from each study. Data was split into two periods: period 1: 2003-2012 and period 2: 2013-2016, and analyzed using SPSS version 24.Results: A total of 11 studies (491 patients) were identified from a literature search of 148 studies with mean age of 45 years and a male: female ratio of 2:1. Mean operative time was 69 minutes (SD= \u00b115). The initial and final stone free rate (SFR) was 87% and 93% respectively. Post-operative stents were placed in 89% of patients with a mean hospital stay of 1.6 days (SD= \u00b10.5). Overall there was a significant negative association between case volume (procedures per month) and complication rate (p=0.045). Mean hospital stay was significantly longer in period 1 (1.9 days, SD= \u00b10.5) than period 2 (1.3 days, SD= \u00b10.3) and complications were also significantly higher in the period 1 (47%) compared to period 2 (12%) (p<0.001). There were 6 studies examining holmium laser (HL) lithotripsy and 3 examining pneumatic lithotripsy (PL). There were significantly more complications after PL than HL (54.9% vs. 16.7%, p=0.007) and a trend towards longer hospital stay (1.98 vs. 1.21, p=0.041). However, there was no difference in SFR between these two fragmentation modalities.Conclusions: Simultaneous bilateral ureteroscopic treatment of urolithiasis is safe and effective in the contemporary era.

The understanding that smoking causes lung cancer was compared to that of BC, RC and ED using one-sample t tests. Chi-squared tests and logistic regression were used to determine whether participant characteristics affected their knowledge.Results: In this population, 98.2% correctly identified that smoking causes lung cancer, significantly higher than that for BC (27.7%), RC (42.2%) or ED (36.3%). Knowledge of an ED-smoking link was higher in smokers (44.4%: 34.9%, difference 9.5% [95% CI 0.9%,18.3% p=0.030]), and in males (41.3%: 31.9%, difference 9.5% [95% CI 3.3%,15.6% p=0.003]). This may be due, in part, to public health warnings on cigarette packaging and the fact that it is a disease with emotional resonance for young men.Conclusion: Many participants are unaware of the link between smoking and urological disease. Young adults need to be informed about the risks of developing smoking related urological pathology. Education on smoking associated urological disease risk may be an important tool in reducing smoking prevalence. However, education alone will not be enough. 98% of the sample knew that smoking causes lung cancer and still 15% smoke.

Surgeons completed feedback questionnaires assessing the realism, educational impact, acceptability and feasibility of the VR prostatectomy module. All novice surgeons completed a 5.5-hour training programme.Results: Surgeons scored the realism for BDN (mean 3.4/5) and UVA (3.74/5) and the importance of BDN (4.32/5) and UVA (4.6/5) for training highly for this procedural module. It was rated a feasible (3.95/5) and acceptable (4/5) tool for training. Experts performed significantly better than novice group in 6 metrics in the UVA including time (p=0.0005), distance by camera (p=0.0010) and instrument collisions (p=0.0033) as well as task specific metrics such as number of unnecessary needle piercing points (p=0.0463). In novice surgeons, a significant improvement in performance after training was seen for BND in time (p<0.0001), instrument collisions (p=0.0013), total time instruments are out of view (p=0.0137), number of movements of left instrument (p=0.0003) and right instrument (0.0003).

Construct validity was proven between experts and novice. Novice surgeons have shown a significant learning curve over 5.5 hours of training, suggesting this module could be used in a surgical curriculum for acquisition of technical skills.

Six studies assessed the outcome of procedural VR training on a VR simulator, 6 using a porcine model, 1 using fresh frozen cadavers and virtual reality, 5 in the operating room (OR) with real patients and 2 in the OR using models. A statistically significant improvement was seen when comparing procedural VR training groups against a control in 2 studies when assessed in VR, 2 studies when assessed in porcine models and in 4 studies when assessed with live patients in the OR. A number of articles reported that no difference was found between procedural VR training and other modes of simulation training. Some types of simulation were found to be more effective than procedural VR training.Conclusions: Procedural VR training allows surgical trainee to develop key surgical skills and is an effective training tool. Procedural VR training may be more effective for trainees who have already acquired basic surgical skills from another method of simulation. Additional studies investigating both basic and procedural VR simulation may produce evidence for what level of surgeon will gain the most from procedural VR training.

Premature ejaculation is the urological disease with more proven benefits with AD. However, the use of AD as analgesics has acquired a place of appeal in the treatment of interstitial cystitis and chronic pelvic pain, by producing analgesia at supraspinal, spinal and peripheral sites. SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are the AD most studied as analgesics. The wide range of adverse effects of these drugs can be intelligently used to treat some specific diseases (eg premature ejaculation), but we have to keep in mind that they can have deleterious effects at the urological level: gynecomastia, priapism, sexual dysfunction (erectile dysfunction, retrograde ejaculation or anejaculation, decreased libido), urinary incontinence and changes in seminal parameters and fertility. Last but not least, one should not forget the implications of using AD in a particular population -the elderly urological patients.Conclusions: AD are complex drugs. They exert a multiplicity of pharmacological actions that can be used to treat other diseases than depression. Their role in urological diseases is well established, however their importance in pain treatment is becoming a useful weapon. The smart use of their side effects to treat specific diseases should be well balanced with the harmful effects at urological level and which the doctor should always keep in mind. ",

Intravesical instillation of 0.2% aqueous silver nitrate for 15 seconds and 0.25% trypsin solution for 10 min was performed to damage the bladder urothelium, allowing the induction of vesicouteral reflux. Then, 2 x 106 cells/200 mL of UM-UC-3 cells were injected into the bladder of mice, followed by urethral occlusion with a purse string suture for 3 hours. The average bladder capacity of mice is thought to be 50-100 mL. Intravesical instillation of 200 mL cell suspension could facilitate cancer cells to flow upstream to the renal pelvis.Results: Four weeks after the cell instillation, the mice were euthanized and submitted to autopsy. Representatively, one of mice had a huge tumor in the left kidney and a small tumor in the right. Incision along the long axis of the kidneys revealed that most of left kidney was involved in tumor growth and approximately 50% of right kidney was affected. The kidneys were fixed in 10% formaldehyde solution and examined by hematoxylin-eosin staining. There were cancer cells which reached and attached to the urothelium of renal pelvis. Lymphovascular invasion was observed in the section. Non-papillary architecture was main growth pattern of this model. In some sections, there was cancer invasion front which invades the renal parenchyma. Detailed pathological examination showed four out of five mice (80%) developed renal pelvic tumors. One of two small tumors in each bladder was observed whereas no lymph-node involvement and lung metastasis was observed in the mice.Conclusion: This mouse may be a promising orthotopic models for aggressive renal pelvic cancer characterized by invasion to the renal parenchyma and lymphovasclualr involvement.

Masson trichrome staining (MTS) of these specimens was also performed to determine the degree of periurethral fibrosis. Uni-and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze the correlation between several factors and the postoperative continence status.Results: Of the 101 patients, urinary continence was achieved in 37 and 62 at 1 and 3 months after RARP, respectively. Immunohistochemical study revealed that 59, 41, and 56 were positive for TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and MTS, respectively, and the findings on MTS were significantly correlated with those on TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expressions. At 1 month after RARP, the proportions of patients positive for TNF-\u03b1 expression and MTS, but not IL-1\u03b2 expression, in the incontinence group were significantly greater than those in the continence group, while at 3 months after RARP, a significantly greater proportion of patients in the incontinence group were judged to be positive for TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expressions, but not MTS, than the continence group.The following factors were identified as independent predictors of the continence status: preoperatively observed detrusor overactivity and TNF-\u03b1 expression at 1 month after RARP, and TNF-\u03b1 expression at 3 months after RARP.Conclusions: Periurethral inflammation, particularly which evaluated by TNF-\u03b1 staining, could be a useful predictive parameter of the continence status early after RARP.",

Patients received a differentiated therapy depending on the predominant symptoms: voiding or erectile dysfunction or pain. Effectiveness was assessed 3-4 weeks after the start of treatment.Patients of Group I were treated by botulinum toxin type A (BTXA) which was injected into the bladder sphincter or sphincter and detrusor depending on the identified type of disorder. Statisti-cally significant results were achieved for all parameters. Group II received sildenafil (50 mg/day). Obvious improvement was also noted in most cases. Groups III and IV were treated by baclofenum (60 mg/day) -a muscle relaxant of central action. We did not observe any credible effect in group IV in most settings. The table demonstrates dynamics (%) of the main studied parameters after treatment.Conclusion: Understanding and detailing the mechanisms of disorders is a key to successful treatment. A differentiated approach to the therapy of CPPS has led to improvements in more than 90% of men generally. An effort to treat patients with unclear causes of their complaints was unsuccessful. Introduction and Objective: Botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) is an established treatment for neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) refractory to medical management. Its efficacy and safety is supported by level 1a evidence. We report our case series of patients developing unsafe detrusor pressures post intravesical BTX-A treatment by unmasking poor compliance, not previously reported in the literature.",

Bladder management comprised a combination of intermittent catheterisation (IC) and penile sheath collection. Videourodynamics (VUD) pre BTX-A showed evidence of NDO associated with detrusor sphincter dyssenergia with subsequent urinary incontinence. NDO and urinary incontinence symptoms were refractory to anti-muscarinic management and intravesical BTX-A was therefore offered. Post BTX-A VUDs were performed in the 4 patients due to ongoing symptoms.Results: VUDs were performed within 4 months of 200 units BTX-A instillation. Detrusor pressure was noted to rise to >40cmH20 with bladder filling, in keeping with poor compliance and the development of risk to the upper urinary tract. Three patients proceeded to ileocystoplasty and one continued with IC and anti-muscarinic treatment awaiting surgery.Conclusions: This small series highlights a possible dangerous consequence of BTX-A treatment in this select group of patients. Inhibition of detrusor contraction by BTX-A may impede return to safe detrusor pressures normally caused by subsequent urinary incontinence. BTX-A does not treat underlying poor compliance. The use of VUDs is essential in identifying this risk early and allows alternative treatments to be offered.",

We aimed to see how this value correlates with paraclinical investigations during a prospective study.Materials and Methods: During the last 18 months, a total of 48 patients, men and women, with neurogenic bladder of various etiologies were evaluated using a standardized protocol, including ultrasonography with BWT measurement and upper tract evaluation, invasive urodynamics and urinalysis. A statistical analysis was performed using the t-test. Abnormal BWT was considered anything above 3.3 mm in men and 3 mm in women measured on the anterior wall.Results: All the patients in this series had an abnormal BWT as per our definition. Although infection was present in 69% of our patients (33 cases), no statistical correlation could be demosntrated. We observed that the higher the Pdet value is, the higher the BWT in many cases, however no statistical significance could be demonstrated. Also, no statistical correlation could be found between BWT and the presence of reflux or hydroneprosis. Detrusor sphincter dyssinergia (DSD) associated higher values of BWT (p<0.003). Lower bladder compliance is strongly correlated with the increase of BWT (p<0.001).Conclusions: A higher BWT associates a lower bladder compliance and a higher chance the patient has DSD. BWT is not correlated with infection, nor with the Pdet value. There was no correlation between the BWT and the presence of reflux or hydroneprosis.",

Patients required a mean of 5 (2-11) transfusion units before embolization; 4 patients required more blood products after TAE. The mean haemoglobin level before and after TAE was 8.5g/dL and 9.0g/dL, respectively. During the follow-up, there were few complications related to TAE: gluteus necrotic ulcer in 1 patient and gluteus pain in 3 patients. The 3-and 6-month mortality rates were 50% (3 patients) and 66% (4 patients), respectively.Conclusion: Fluoroscopic-guided embolization is a safe and effective method for palliating haematuria in patients with advanced urological cancers.

Post-operative care included: (1) Activity: to encourage early bed-side activity.(2) Hypercapnia: postoperative should be given low flow, intermittent oxygen inhalation to promote CO2 discharge. Patients with fatigue, irritability, slow breathing, facial cyanosis or arrhythmia should be highly concerned.(3) Bleeding: drainage tube and wound exudation should be closely concerned in the first 24 hours. (4) Pain management: effective patient control analgesia (PCA) should be given. (5) Diet nursing: liquid diet in the first 6 hours could be gradually changed to normal diet. Discharge guidance included: (1) Aerobic exercise is appropriate in the first 2 weeks. The amount of activity should be recommended gradually and progressively.(2) Nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided.(3) The details for follow-up schedule should be guided to the patients for contra-lateral renal function and oncological outcomes evaluation.Results: All the patients were successfully performed LESS surgery and discharged from the hospital. No postoperative complication was reported.",

With preoperative psychological care, postoperative care and bed-side observations, the patients Empowering patients to take a more active role in the course of their disease has been shown to increase compliance and quality of life. The objective of this pilot study was to explore an intervention offering self-tracking and health-coaching for better self-management of chronic urological disease. The hypothesis is, firstly, that patients will achieve an increased understanding of their health situation and their own possibilities of influencing this situation. Secondly, the data will help create a greater sense of control.",

One prostate cancer (PCa) patient in active surveillance and one patient with urolithiasis. The PCa patient was equipped with a FLIC bluetooth button and tracked restless legs. The urolithiasis patient was equipped with a smartwatch, tracking pain, fluid-and sugar-intake. The data was used to identify possible underlying factors causing health problems. These insights were used as part of the coaching-process.",

            "text": "The preliminary findings showed that the PCa patient suffered from restless legs which disturbed his sleep every night. He had a prescription of medication against restless legs but was hesitant to use it, so the first step in the coaching session was to learn the importance of a good sleep and the necessity of taking his medication. After adjusting his medication, he achieved a good sleeping pattern, which gave him energy to lead a healthier lifestyle. For the urolithiasis patient it appeared that he had a high intake of sugar in the hours prior to a stone attack. In the coaching session it was discussed, if this could be a way of relieving the pain and it was hypothesized and investigated if high sucker intake could promote stone attacks' .Conclusion: Data-guided health coaching (DGHC) may base on the results from this pilot study have the potential to empower urological patients to better self-management of chronic disease. More studies are needed to explore the intervention further and to define the exact role of DGHC in management of patients with chronic urological disorders. ",
