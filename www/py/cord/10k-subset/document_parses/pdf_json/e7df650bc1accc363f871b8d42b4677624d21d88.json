            "text": "Despite increased efforts in surveillance for influenza viruses in wild birds and domestic poultry, human infections of A(H5N1) highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses continue to occur sporadically. More than 800 cases were reported by the World Health Organization from 2003 to 2015, with a fatality rate of >50% [1] . The majority of these infections were associated with direct or close contact with infected poultry. A(H5N1) viruses are increasingly genetically and antigenically diverse; to date, 40 phylogenetically distinct HA clades of the A(H5N1) virus have been identified [2] . Preexisting population immunity in humans to these viruses is very low [3] , underscoring the broad human susceptibility and pandemic potential of HPAI A(H5N1) viruses. Vaccination is an effective prophylactic public health measure to mitigate pandemic-related morbidity and mortality. However, in the event of a pandemic, timely development and production of vaccines that match the novel pandemic strain could be challenging [4] . Thus, several prepandemic vaccine antigens and adjuvants have been included in the US national stockpile [5, 6] . Given the rapid evolution of A(H5N1) viruses, a potential pandemic strain could still be antigenically distinct from the stockpiled vaccines. Development of effective vaccination strategies utilizing stockpiled vaccines to protect against novel emerging virus infection is crucial for influenza pandemic preparedness.",

This is the first appearance of HPAI H5 viruses in the United States since 2004 [8] and, importantly, the first incursion of the A/ goose/Guangdong/1/96 Eurasian lineage viruses into the United States. The novel HPAI A(H5N1) viruses spread along 3 of the 4 US wild bird migratory flyways, caused significant mortality in domestic poultry, and posed a potential risk to public health [9] . Three subtypes of H5 viruses have been identified in infected birds: A(H5N8), A(H5N2), and A(H5N1). These viruses bear similar hemagglutinin (HA), but different neuraminidases acquired through genetic reassortment with North American low pathogenic avian influenza viruses, and are therefore referred to as H5Nx viruses. Hemagglutinins of these viruses belong to Eurasian lineage clade 2.3.4.4 [2, 9] . Although no human cases associated with the North American H5Nx poultry outbreaks were identified, human diseases with clade 2.3.4.4 H5 avian influenza viruses have occurred in China [10] .",

            "text": "Several clade-specific A(H5N1) vaccine antigens have been included in the prepandemic national stockpiles in the United States. However, the rapid evolution of avian influenza viruses pose challenges for such preparedness strategies based on antigenic match. This is exemplified by the emergence of a novel cluster of H5Nx viruses that caused recent outbreaks in poultry across multiple states in the United States. These clade 2.3.4.4 viruses are antigenically distant from the current stockpiled vaccines. In this study, we demonstrated that despite great antigenic distance, heterologous prime-boost vaccination with clade 1 and adjuvanted clade 2.3.4 stockpiled A(H5N1) vaccines was able to induce cross-reactive antibody responses to A(H5N8) and A(H5N2) viruses. Heterologous prime-boost vaccination utilizing stockpiled vaccines may provide a strategy to broaden the cross-reactive antibody responses to novel emerging A(H5N1) viruses. Inactivated A(H5N1) vaccination typically requires at least 2 doses and the use of adjuvants to achieve sufficient serologic responses in a majority of recipients [15, 16] . Few studies have evaluated the effects of heterologous prime-boost using prepandemic stockpiled A(H5N1) antigens. Most have only been focused on antibody responses to the heterologous H5N1 vaccine components [11, [16] [17] [18] . Data on cross-reactive antibody responses to novel emerging viruses such as H5Nx are lacking. Our study suggested that priming with an unadjuvanted clade 1 vaccine induced immune memory that could be boosted with a single low dose (3.75 \u00b5g) of adjuvanted clade 2.3.4 A/Anhui1 vaccine, generating diverse antibody responses that are cross-reactive to antigenically distant H5Nx viruses. This broader boosting effect was not achieved by homologous prime-boost, even with higher antigen doses (7.5 \u00b5g/dose).",

In addition, we only evaluated 1 antigen concentration (7.5 \u00b5g) from the homologous prime-boost vaccination that represent the optimum vaccine dose with MF59 [11] . It also is noteworthy that the levels of cross-reactive responses to A(H5N8) and A(H5N2) viruses observed in the study are quite modest. Seroconversion was detected by a modified HI assay using horse erythrocytes. Cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies to H5Nx were only observed at around the detection threshold of the MN assays. Higher levels of cross-reactive antibodies may be required to achieve sufficient protection. Several studies suggested that the use of oil-in-water adjuvants such as stockpiled MF59 and ASO3 could broaden the diversity of antibody populations [17, 19] . Thus, an inclusion of an adjuvant in the priming vaccine could potentially enhance the cross-reactive responses.",

Some studies have demonstrated an advantage of longer intervals between the priming and boosting dose, suggesting that allowing B cells to mature may enhance the effect of priming for heterologous antibody responses [12, 18] . In this study, it appeared that the memory B cells induced with A/VN1203 priming persisted for as long as 25 months (mean, 21.7 months) and could be readily recalled upon A/Anhui1 boost to produce cross-reactive antibodies to antigenically distant H5Nx viruses. This provides new evidence to support vaccination strategies using prepandemic stockpiled antigens. In one scenario, at-risk populations could be primed with prepandemic stockpiled antigens in advance, then boosted with antigenically matched pandemic vaccines when it becomes available [20] . However, challenges still reside with the rapid antigenic drift and continued divergence of the A(H5N1) viruses and the limited numbers of antigens that can be stockpiled. The selection of effective priming antigens and the combination of prime-boost vaccine antigens that can provide broad coverage to novel pandemic viruses remained to be explored. Further understanding of the underlying immune mechanisms of prime-boost will help to design better vaccination strategies utilizing stockpiled antigens for pandemic preparedness.",
