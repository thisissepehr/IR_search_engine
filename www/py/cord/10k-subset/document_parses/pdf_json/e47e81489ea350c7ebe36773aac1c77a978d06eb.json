A number of conjugates of glycyrrhizic acid with amino acids and dipeptides possesses meaningful anti-AIDS-1 activity [6, 7] , and is of interest as anti-SARS CoV-agents [8] and inhibitors of Epstein-Barr virus [9] . It was found recently that some amino acid conjugates of glycyrrhizic acid possess significant virus inhibition activity towards pandemic influenza virus \u0410/H1N1/pdm2009 [10, 11] . Earlier we developed methods for the preparation of glycyrrhizic acid conjugates with alkyl and benzyl (4nitrobenzyl) esters of amino acids with the use of Nhydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), or N-hydroxysuccinimide (HOSu) that allowed synthesis of the derivatives of glycyrrhizic acid with two or three amino acid residues or their esters depending on the reaction conditions [4, 5, 12, 13] .",
