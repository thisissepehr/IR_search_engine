            "text": "Background and Aims Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common inflammatory liver condition that may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Risk factors for NASH include a saturated fat diet, altered lipid metabolism, and genetic and epigenetic factors, including microRNAs. Serum levels of cholecystokinin (CCK) are elevated in mice and humans that consume a high-saturated fat diet. CCK receptors (CCK-Rs) have been reported on fibroblasts which when activated can induce fibrosis; however, their role in hepatic fibrosis remains unknown. We hypothesized that elevated levels of CCK acting on the CCK-Rs play a role in the development of NASH and in NASH-associated HCC. Methods We performed a NASH Prevention study and Reversal study in mice fed a saturated fat 75% choline-deficientethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet for 12 or 18 weeks. In each study, half of the mice received untreated drinking water, while the other half received water supplemented with the CCK-R antagonist proglumide. CCK-R expression was evaluated in mouse liver and murine HCC cells. Results CCK receptor antagonist treatment not only prevented NASH but also reversed hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and steatosis and normalized hepatic transaminases after NASH was established. Thirty-five percent of the mice on the CDE diet developed HCC compared with none in the proglumide-treated group. We found that CCK-BR expression was markedly upregulated in mouse CDE liver and HCC cells compared with normal hepatic parenchymal cells, and this expression was epigenetically regulated by microRNA-148a. Conclusion These results support the novel role of CCK receptors in the pathogenesis of NASH and HCC.",

            "text": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is one of the leading causes of liver-related morbidity and mortality in the world, and its incidence has sharply risen since the beginning of the twenty-first century [1] . Obesity and high-fat diets, such as the \"Western diet\" [2] [3] [4] , are primary drivers of this pandemic in both industrialized and developing countries [5] . Day and colleagues proposed a \"two-hit\" theory [6] , suggesting that steatosis plus another factor such as inflammation leads to the development of NASH. While hepatic fibrosis has been determined to be the single best predictor of mortality in NASH, hepatic inflammation is an undeniable accelerator of fibrosis, since only approximately 2% of patients with simple steatosis (without inflammation) develop cirrhosis compared with 25-30% with NASH [7] . This chronic inflammatory state, characteristic of NASH, induces histologic evidence of hepatocyte injury with balloon degeneration and fibrosis, and may lead to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [8, 9] . Today, the fastest growing cause of cancerrelated death is HCC [10] , and with curative therapies available for hepatitis C, NASH-related HCC will soon surpass that of viral hepatitis as the primary indication for orthotopic liver transplantation [2] . Proposed mechanisms for NASHassociated HCC include increased insulin resistance with lipid dysregulation [11] , heightened oxidative stress and lipotoxicity [12] , and an alteration in the gut microbiome [13] . More recently, investigators have identified a relationship between NASH-associated hepatic carcinogenesis and genetic [14] or epigenetic regulators [15] including histone methylation and alterations in microRNAs. Downregulation of microRNA-122 [16] and miR148a [17] occurs in NASH associated with dysregulation of lipid metabolism. Furthermore, obesity can induce histone hypermethylation resulting in the downregulation of miR148a [18] .",

            "text": "Epidemiological studies have shown an association between NASH and HCC with an increased consumption of dietary fat, particularly saturated fats [19] . Saturated fatty acids (FAs) also stimulate release of the gastrointestinal (GI) peptide cholecystokinin (CCK), with a sharp cutoff in FA chain length [20, 21] . Saturated FAs with a chain length > C12 are effective CCK releasers, while C11 or shorter-chain length FAs do not release CCK [21] . Human subjects that consumed a high-fat diet were found to have elevated CCK levels [22] . We previously documented that CCK blood levels were tenfold higher in mice consuming a high-saturated fat diet compared to controls [23, 24] . CCK exerts its effects through the CCK receptor which is a G-protein-coupled receptor [25] . Two classic CCK receptors, the CCK-A receptor (CCK-AR) and the CCK-B receptor (CCK-BR), have been identified [26, 27] . CCK-BRs are over-expressed in several GI cancers including pancreatic cancer [28] , gastric cancer [29] [30] [31] , and colon cancer [29, 32, 33] . Recently, CCK-BRs have also been reported in HCC [34] . We previously showed that miR148a decreases during pancreatic carcinogenesis [35] and is inversely correlated with the expression of the CCK-BR [36] . Studies in gastric cancer have found that miR148a functions as a tumor suppressor targeting the CCK-BR [37] .",

Proglumide is an older drug that was originally developed for peptic ulcer disease [39] and has a known, strong safety profile based on human clinical trials. Apart from their proliferative role on cancer cells, CCK receptors have been identified on pancreatic stellate cells [40] and fibroblasts [41] . Proglumide treatment decreases tumor-associated fibrosis in mouse models of pancreatic cancer [24, 36, 42] . Although CCK receptors have not been reported on hepatic stellate cells, the liver and pancreas develop from endodermal epithelium of the embryonic foregut [43] and have many common features. Therefore, we hypothesized that CCK receptor blockade with proglumide could have a similar effect on hepatic stellate cells as it does on pancreatic stellate cells, thereby preventing or even regressing hepatic fibrosis in NASH.",

New genetically engineered animal models have been established that develop NASH, but most of these models have immune deficiencies [47] . A diet high in saturated fat that causes obesity is frequently used in experimental studies [23, 24, 48] ; unfortunately, with this diet very extended periods (up to a year) are required to develop NASH with mild fibrosis and HCC frequently does not occur even under these protracted diet settings [44] . Most of the dietary animal models develop some fibrosis, but not cirrhosis. Carbon tetrachloride treatment has been used for years as a model of cirrhosis and HCC, but this treatment does not cause steatosis [49] . A special diet that is deficient in choline and supplemented with 0.1% DL-ethionine (CDE diet) has been shown to induce hepatic fibrosis and steatosis more rapidly and exhibits the histologic characteristics of human NASH [50] . This model also is not perfect in that CDE-fed mice typically lose weight compared to control mice; therefore, it does not truly represent the human metabolic syndrome model with obesity. In fact, there are no ideal murine models that simulate the human metabolic syndrome, induce NASH, and lead to HCC. Dietary deficiency of choline results in impaired assembly and secretion of very low-density lipoproteins, and when combined with DL-ethionine, this regimen leads to steatosis, inflammation, periportal fibrosis, and development of HCC [51] .",

We selected this CDE diet, but we used a modified (75%) composition [52] with 25% less ethionine to avoid hemorrhagic pancreatitis which is associated with a 100% CDE diet. We also modified the CDE diet to use lard (high in saturated FAs) as the source of fat and casein as the source of protein since both components stimulate release of CCK. Control mice also received a saturated fat diet with lard but with normal levels of choline and without ethionine in order to induce nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this investigation, we found that CCK receptor blockade not only prevented dietary-induced NASH but also reversed biochemical and histologic alterations of NASH after it was established. Thirty-five percent of the mice on the saturated fat CDE diet developed HCC by week 18, but none of the mice on the CDE diet and proglumide developed HCC, making this anticancer affect the most striking finding of our research.",

AST values were restored to near normal with proglumide therapy in the Prevention study at weeks 12 and 18 in spite of continuation of the CDE diet (Fig. 3a) and proglumide also significantly decreased AST in the Reversal study at week 18 (Fig. 3a, bottom  panel) .

Likewise, total bilirubin levels were elevated in mice fed the CDE/ Reg diet (Fig. 3c) , and the increase in bilirubin was completely prevented by concomitant proglumide therapy at weeks 12 and 18. In the Reversal study, CDE-fed mice treated with proglumide after 12 weeks of the NASHinducing diet experienced normalization of bilirubin levels (Fig. 3c) , and proglumide reversed the hyperbilirubinemia in the Reversal study (Fig. 3c, bottom panel) . Alkaline phosphatase levels increased in mice fed the CDE diet, an effect that was not ameliorated by proglumide in either the Prevention or Reversal studies (Fig. 3d) . Mice on the control diet had normal liver-associated enzymes and bilirubin levels in both the Prevention and Reversal studies. Lipase levels were analyzed in the mice consuming the CDE diet to assure that the diet did not induce pancreatitis.

CCK-BR mRNA expression was significantly increased in the livers of CDEfed mice compared to control mouse livers (Fig. 6a) . CCK-AR mRNA expression decreased in the CDE-fed mice compared to control (Fig. 6a) . Since the CCK-BR expression was significantly upregulated, we then examined the mechanism involved with this increased receptor expression in the mouse livers. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the CCK-BR and the CCK-AR mRNA are both markedly over-expressed in murine Dt81-Hepa1-6 HCC cells compared to normal mouse liver tissue (Fig. 6b) . We then performed gene editing with CRISPR/cas9 to knock out the CCK-BR in these liver cancer cells and confirmed knockout by qRT-PCR compared to wild-type cells (Fig. 6c) . In these CCK-BR-KO Dt81-Hepa1-6 cells, miRNA-148a expression is significantly increased (Fig. 6d) . In order to confirm our findings that CCK-BR expression is epigenetically regulated by miR148a, we then transfected miR148a mimic in the Dt81Hepa1-6 cells and confirmed over-expression compared to transfection with a scrambled control (Fig. 6e) . CCK-BR expression was significantly downregulated in the Dt81Hepa1-6 cells that over-expressed the miR148a (Fig. 6f) , confirming an epigenetic regulatory effect of CCK-BR mRNA expression by miR148a.",

            "text": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis has become a significant health problem globally and is associated with the rising prevalence of HCC. New treatments that are safe, are orally bioavailable, and do not impair hepatic function are desperately needed. Proglumide is an older drug that was originally developed for peptic ulcer disease [39] and has been shown to be safe and orally bioavailable. In this investigation, we demonstrated that oral administration of a CCK receptor antagonist, proglumide, not only prevents NASH in mice fed a CDE diet but can also reverse the biochemical and histologic abnormalities in established NASH. These results support our novel hypothesis that CCK receptors play a role in the development of NASH and HCC. An important finding of our investigation was that therapy with proglumide not only decreased inflammation and steatosis but also decreased fibrosis. In the PIVENS trial, neither vitamin E nor pioglitazone [56] reversed fibrosis; however, a subsequent meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials showed pioglitazone monotherapy had a modest improvement in hepatic fibrosis [57] . Those with diabetes were excluded from the PIVENS trial. We demonstrated that fibrosis was indeed decreased in the livers of the mice treated with proglumide by histologic analysis and also quantification of specific collagens and fibrosis proteins. Type 1 collagen is over-expressed in hepatic fibrosis, easily detected by Masson's trichrome stain, and associated with hepatic stellate cell activation [58] . Type IV collagen [59] is associated with the basement membrane and has previously been used as a marker to demonstrate reversal of hepatic fibrosis after therapy for viral hepatitis [60] . Fibroblast-activated protein (FAP), also called seprase, is the member of dipeptidyl peptidase IV gene family. FAP serves as a tumor promoter and is secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts [61] . The finding of decreased FAP by Western analysis supports the antitumor effect proglumide exhibited in mice consuming the CDE diet. A remarkable finding in this study was that none of the CDE/Prog mice in the Prevention arm and none of the NASH reversal treatment arm developed dysplastic nodules or HCC at week 18 in contrast to 35% of the mice fed the CDE/Reg diet.",

One Fig. 3 Serum liver tests at weeks 12 and 18. a Serum AST was significantly increased in CDE/Reg mice compared to control mice, and AST normalized with proglumide at weeks 12 and 18 and in the Reversal study. b ALT levels increased in mice on the CDE diet compared to the control diet, and proglumide reversed the ALT only after 18 weeks. c Serum bilirubin was increased in the CDE/Reg group compared to controls, and this elevation was reversed with proglumide. d Alkaline phosphatase blood levels were elevated in mice fed the CDE diet compared to the control diet, but proglumide did not decreased alkaline phosphatase \u25c2 reason that proglumide was able to reverse the hyperbilirubinemia in mice on the CDE diet may be because proglumide has been shown to increase bile flow [64] and decrease bile acid concentration in rats. Most likely the elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin in the CDEfed mice were due to drug-induced hepatotoxicity from the ethionine [65] . Although highly potent CCK-AR antagonists can impair gall bladder emptying [66] which may result in acute cholecystitis and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels, no overt cholecystitis was noted in any of the proglumide-treated mice at necropsy. Furthermore, the elevated alkaline phosphatase levels were detected in mice only on the CDE diet including those that had not been treated with proglumide; therefore, this biochemical alteration was most likely drug-induced liver injury (DILI) from the ethionine and not proglumide. Another characteristic that supported evidence of ethionine-related DILI was the histologic appearance of micro-steatosis only in the CDE-fed mice. While all the mice, including the controls, exhibited macro-steatosis related to the high saturated fat in the diet, only the CDE-fed mice had both macro-and micro-steatosis.",

Concomitant CDE with proglumide therapy was able to prevent the weight loss, and these mice had body weights comparable to the control mice. When proglumide was administered later (week 12) in the Reversal study, the animals' body weights did not recover. Although the 6-week period was adequate to reverse most of the histologic and biochemical abnormalities of NASH from the CDE diet, perhaps longer treatment was needed to reverse the body weight and ALT abnormalities. One possible explanation for the observed weight loss and decreased food intake may be attributed to the elevated CCK serum levels we identified in mice fed the saturated fat CDE diet. CCK is known as a satiety hormone, and CCK receptors in the central nervous system have been shown to play a role in satiety and food intake [67] . Although food intake in the CDE-proglumide-treated mice was slightly decreased compared to controls, we did not observe a statistical difference in food intake in the proglumide-treated mice compared to the CDE/Reg-treated mice.

Although miR-148a deficiency has been shown to promote hepatic lipid metabolism and hepatic carcinogenesis [17] , this is the first report demonstrating that miR-148a also negatively regulates expression of the CCK-BR in liver cancer. MiR-148a expression is frequently downregulated in biopsies of HCC patients as well as in mouse and human HCC cell lines [17] . In gastric cancer, miR-148a has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor targeting the CCK-BR and inactivating STAT3 and AKT [37] .
