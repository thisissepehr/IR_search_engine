Recessive genetic models showed their significant independent associations with higher death risks (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-6.02, and aHR 4.85, 95% CI 1.11\u221221.06, respectively).

Likewise, SNPs of the TLR4 gene have been linked to impaired innate immunity against respiratory viruses [22, 23] . CD55 inhibits the formation of C3 and C5 convertases responsible for complement activation and inflammation, mechanisms implicated in fulminant influenza pneumonitis. The SNP of CD55 rs2564978 has been associated (indirectly) with decreased promotor activity and lowered protection level [8, 24, 25] . Results of these SNPs' associations with clinical severity, however, appear to be inconsistent, and likely confounded by patients' ethnicity, clinical characteristics, antiviral treatment, and small sample sizes; further, the impacts on survival had not been examined [17, 20, 21, [25] [26] [27] . Notably, some of these genetic variants are much more prevalent among the East Asian populations, thus potentially exerting stronger impacts than in populations where their frequencies are low (eg, those with European ancestries) [15, 17, 24] . Also, it is unknown if their effects are cumulative, which will have important implications on genetic risk evaluation.",

Avian (H7N9) and pandemic (H1N1 pdm09 ) influenza virus infections were studied. Impacts on survival were examined under different genetic models; effects of important clinical confounders were adjusted in multivariate analyses. Joint effects of the genetic variants were investigated with the use of a genetic risk score. Our data may improve the understanding of the genetic risk for severe influenza, and provide an important basis for future research. METHODS We studied SNPs of the targeted host genes in H7N9 and H1N1 pdm09 influenza cases that were consecutively diagnosed in 4 participating institutes in mainland China (Guangdong, Shanghai, Beijing) and Hong Kong during 3 respective seasonal outbreaks (H7N9, 2013-2015; H1N1 pdm09 , 2011\u22122014; Table 1 footnotes). Virological features, and procedures related to laboratory diagnosis and clinical management of influenza in these medical units (all being urban hospital settings) has been described in detail [2, 5, [28] [29] [30] [31] . Briefly, patients presented with symptoms of acute respiratory tract infections during the seasonal outbreaks were tested for influenza virus infections (ie, prospectively diagnosed) with molecular assays, regardless of perceived severity. The inclusion criteria were: polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed H7N9 or H1N1 pdm09 virus infection, age \u226518 years, and Chinese ethnicity (Chinese populations residing in Hong Kong, Guangdong, Shanghai, and Beijing are mostly of Han ancestry; >95%-99%); there was no exclusion criterion. Patients' original respiratory tract samples collected at presentation for diagnostic purpose, which contained virus-infected epithelial cells, were retrieved for host gene SNP and viral RNA load studies; identical methodologies were used across institutes (see below). Clinical data, including patient characteristics, disease severity, and outcomes, were collected using a standardized research database (to ensure identical definitions of variables), as previously described [5] . All patient identifying information was removed from the dataset, and only anonymous data were used for analysis. Ethics approvals for this study were obtained from the Institution Review Boards (IRB) of all participating institutes.",

No DNase/RNase digestion step was performed [32] . Genotyping of 5 SNPs, including IFITM3 rs12252, CD55 rs2564978, TLR3 rs5743313, and TLR4 rs4986790 and rs4986791, was performed by Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons. In brief, host DNA was subjected to gene-specific PCR amplification using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The PCR primers used are provided in Supplementary material 1 [15, 20, 23, 24] . PCR amplicons (300-600 base-pairs in size) were column-purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), followed by Sanger sequencing in both directions using PCR primers. DNA chromatograms were inspected and genotypes were called manually. With this method, genotyping results were successfully obtained in 90.5%, 88.4%, 84.4%, 87.6%, and 87.6% of cases for IFITM3 rs12252, TLR3 rs5743313, CD55 rs2564978, and TLR4 rs4986790 and rs4986791, respectively. The success rates were not significantly different among the target genes and participating institutes. At the time of writing, a study on IFITM3 SNP was published, reporting a similar genotyping success rate of 87% using archived respiratory tract samples collected from patients with influenza-like illnesses [27] . Genotyping accuracy with respiratory samples was confirmed by the results obtained using paired peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples (n = 10), which showed 100% concordance. The SNP results were tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by the exact test using PLINK (a Bonferroni-corrected P value of >.01 indicated no significant deviation) [33] . To examine for representativeness, the observed allele frequencies in this cohort were compared to the 1000 Genomes general population data on Han Chinese (and East Asians) (www.1000genomes. org/home; last accessed on 18 September 2016) (Supplementary material 2).",

Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to examine independent associations between the genetic variants and death (censored at 30 days from time of presentation), which were tested under the additive, dominant, and recessive genetic models. Multivariate models were constructed to adjust for the effects of confounders, including age, gender, comorbidity, use of neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) treatment, and influenza subtype (see Table 1 footnotes for definitions) [34, 35] . The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were reported for each explanatory variable; an aHR >1 indicated a higher probability of death. The largest test statistic (MAX statistic) among the 3 genetic models was chosen as the best-fitting model; the experiment-wise significance of the MAX statistic was estimated from its empirical distribution under the null hypothesis after performing 10 000 permutations of genotypes of the SNPs (P perm ), to correct for multiple comparisons [36, 37] . Pairwise gene-gene interactions were evaluated by including the main effects, the interaction term (product) of the SNPs, and the covariates in the Cox regression models. In addition, we tested for the joint effect of all significant loci (under corresponding genetic models) on the risk of death by computing a genetic risk score (GRS) for each individual using the simple count method. Assuming a similar and independent effect between loci, the GRS was calculated by summing the score of the risk genotype for each SNP based on the most significant genetic model. The significance of the trend was tested by the Cox regression model, using the GRS as an independent variable with adjustment for clinical confounders [36, 37] . The adjusted survival curve stratified according to the GRS was constructed for graphical presentation. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows v.22 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).",

There was increased death risk with the respective homozygous CC genotype of IFITM3 and TLR3, and the effects were cumulative. Our results provide evidence for genetic risks for severe influenza disease, which may have important public health and clinical implications. Everitt and colleagues [14] had first described over-representation of IFITM3 CC (5.7%), an uncommon genotype in populations of European ancestry (0.3%), among patients hospitalized for H1N1 pdm09 influenza in the United Kingdom (n = 53). Several subsequent studies from Europe reported insignificant associations with severe H1N1 pdm09 infection, but the number of cases detected with the genotype were very small (0.7%\u22122.4%) [17, [25] [26] [27] . In Chinese and East Asian populations, however, the IFITM3 CC genotype is known to be much more prevalent (25%\u221244%); and a study from China had reported its over-representation (69%) among hospitalized patients with H1N1 pdm09 pneumonia (n = 32) [15] . Our study added that this genotype might actually predict a fatal outcome of influenza patients. Its frequency was about 21% higher among the fatal cases (54.5%, vs 33.2% in survivors); the death risk was found to be significantly increased by nearly 3-fold, even after adjustment for clinical confounders. The recessive model for the C-allele was confirmed to be the \"best-fitting\" genetic model [15, 26] . Consistent result was also shown for clinical severity, as indicated by development of acute respiratory failure. The mechanism of how this SNP would affect the disease course is incompletely understood and likely complex. It has been suggested that the C-allele homozygosity can impair IFITM3 function, leading to reduced viral clearance, which, in turn, aggravates host inflammatory responses [14, 15] . Viral load coupled with increased proinflammatory cytokines has been described in patients harboring the CC genotype with progressive H7N9 infections, but the study was small (n = 18) [16] .",

There was over-representation of the TLR3 homozygous CC genotype in fatal infections (93.3%, vs 76.9% among survivors; in European populations its prevalence was lower at 50%\u221265%); and a significant increase in death risk was found in recessive and additive models for the major C-allele after adjustment for confounders. To the best of our knowledge, there was only 1 small-scale study (n = 51) describing a univariate association of TLR3 rs5743313 CT genotype with the risk of developing influenza pneumonia in 18 European children [20] . The apparent discrepant result may be attributable to ethnicity difference, as observed in other diseases linked to this SNP, and/or the patients' age and disease stage [38] . Intriguingly, TLR3 function had been shown to be detrimental to the survival of mice with influenza virusinduced pneumonia despite a lowered viral load, owing to the induction of exuberant inflammatory responses and excessive lung damage [39] . A mechanistic study on how the SNP could have affected TLR3 signaling function, and its impact on different phases of infection is indicated [8, 8, 19, 40] . Consistent with a recent report, we also noted a relationship between CD55 T-allele homozygosity (more common among Asians) and clinical severity (hospitalization), though there was no significant association with survival [24, 25] . The TLR4 loci were shown to be nonpolymorphic in this cohort; seemingly, emerging data have suggested a lack of association between TLR4 SNP and influenza severity, unlike in pediatric respiratory syncytial virus disease [20, 23] .",

Fatality of patients with TLR3 CC plus the IFITM3 CC genotype was 23%, whereas patients with either or none of these risk genotypes had fatality rates of 11% and 3%, respectively. The death risk was shown to be incremental in GRS analysis (aHR 3.5, per risk genotype); the presence of both genotypes conferred an almost 10-fold higher risk than those with neither. These results strongly suggest that a combination of host genetic factors (\"genetic background\") may influence the clinical course and outcomes of influenza, along with known clinical and virologic factors [7, 8, 9, 41, 42] . Our list of candidate genes/SNPs is not exhaustive; as experimental and genome-wide association studies continue to uncover these determinants, more variables/ combinations, including those related to adaptive immunity are expected to be considered in genetic risk evaluation in severe influenza [7, 8, 9, 10, 21, 25, 43, 44] .",

            "text": "Our data have important implications. Owing to their high frequencies in Chinese and East Asian populations, the proportion of disease burden attributable to these genetic variants could be substantial. An earlier study on 83 Chinese influenza patients had put the estimate of the population-attributable risk percentage (PAR%) of IFITM3 CC for severe nonfatal/ fatal infections at 54% (in contrast to 5% in European populations) [15] . We had calculated the PAR% of IFITM3 CC for influenza death with this mostly hospitalized Chinese cohort, which was around 36% (95% CI 10-70%); the combined risk with TLR3 CC was higher (Supplementary material 5). Precise PAR estimation would require a much larger sample size; and within/cross-population epidemiological studies are necessary to verify the plausibility. Interestingly, emerging data seem to suggest significant regional heterogeneity in influenza mortality across continents (Europe, Americas, Asia), even accounting for country income status and comorbidity [45] . The knowledge on genetic risk can better inform public health-care planning, pandemic preparedness, and the development of preventive strategies against avian/pandemic influenza in our region [15, 16, 19 ]. At the individual patient level, we indicate the potential of assessing genetic risk factors, together with virologic parameters in the same respiratory sample, to assist prognostication and treatment decisions (eg, regimen intensification), which warrant exploration [15, 16, 19, 35] . As genetic/ethnic factors can confound outcomes, future clinical trials on influenza therapeutics should consider these variables; our study has provided useful information for their design/planning.",

Notably, early NAI treatment was significantly associated with improved outcomes independent of genotype, age, and comorbidity (Table 3) [3, 5, 6, 35] . Interaction and cumulative effects were examined. Unlike genome-wide association studies, however, our approach had limited the number of candidate genes/SNPs for study, and a more detailed analyses on haplotypes and population substructure are infeasible with this design. The SNPs' effects on protein function, and how this might impact on viral clearance and/ or signaling of proinflammatory responses at different disease stages, would require further elucidation (eg, serial viral load and cytokine/chemokine measurements) [14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 28] . D222G, H275Y, and R292K mutations should have a minimal impact on results because of their reported rarity [25, 28, 29, 31, 35] . The effects on host susceptibility to initial infection (compared with uninfected patients) [14, 15, 20, 26] , vaccine response, and the reasons why these immune-related genetic variants (thus implicated in infective/noninfective inflammatory diseases) are selected and gained prevalence among the Asian populations should warrant investigation [15, 19, 37, 38, 42, 43, 45] .
