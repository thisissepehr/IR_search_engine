            "text": "Fulminant viral hepatitis (FVH) is a devastating and unexplained condition that strikes otherwise healthy individuals during primary infection with common liver-tropic viruses. We report a child who died of FVH upon infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV) at age 11 yr and who was homozygous for a private 40-nucleotide deletion in IL18BP, which encodes the IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP). This mutation is loss-of-function, unlike the variants found in a homozygous state in public databases. We show that human IL-18 and IL-18BP are both secreted mostly by hepatocytes and macrophages in the liver. Moreover, in the absence of IL-18BP, excessive NK cell activation by IL-18 results in uncontrolled killing of human hepatocytes in vitro. Inherited human IL-18BP deficiency thus underlies fulminant HAV hepatitis by unleashing IL-18. These findings provide proofof-principle that FVH can be caused by single-gene inborn errors that selectively disrupt liver-specific immunity. They also show that human IL-18 is toxic to the liver and that IL-18BP is its antidote.",

            "text": "Hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are the most common liver-tropic viruses in humans. HAV and HEV typically cause an acute form of hepatitis, whereas HBV and HCV frequently cause chronic hepatitis, increasing the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Guidotti and Chisari, 2006) . HEV may also cause chronic infection (Guidotti and Chisari, 2006 ; European Association for the Study of the Liver, 2017). In rare cases, primary infections with these viruses, particularly for HAV, HBV, and HEV, can lead to fulminant viral hepatitis (FVH; Liu et al., 2001 ; European Association for the Study of the Liver, 2017). FVH is defined as severe liver destruction in the absence of preexisting liver disease, leading to encephalopathy within 8 wk of the onset of the first symptoms (Liu et al., 2001 ; European Association for the Study of the Liver, 2017). It typically strikes children or young adults who are otherwise healthy, with normal immunity to other viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. The actual prevalence and incidence of FVH worldwide are not precisely known, but previous studies have suggested that FVH develops in \u22640.5% of individuals with symptomatic HAV infection (Lemon et al., 2017) , with an estimated 1.5 million cases worldwide annually (Lemon et al., 2017) . The global incidence of FVH due to HAV has therefore been estimated at \u223c1/1,000,000 per year, corresponding to a probable prevalence of 1/100,000. Patients with FVH have a very poor prognosis, with <25% surviving in the absence of liver transplantation. However, survival rates may reach 80% after liver transplantation (Lemon et al., 2017) . FVH is typically sporadic, as opposed to epidemic, suggesting that it is not caused by a new more virulent viral strain (Fujiwara et al., 2001; Sasb\u00f3n et al., 2010; Ajmera et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "Rare familial cases of FVH have been reported, including two young siblings from a Turkish family, three young brothers from an Iranian family, and two elderly brothers from a Japanese family who developed FVH within weeks of each other following primary HAV infections in their siblings (Durst et al., 2001; Yalniz et al., 2005; Yoshida et al., 2017) . In all three families, several relatives of the patients had presented viral hepatitis with a benign course. Inbred strains of mice display differences in susceptibility to mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3; Wege et al., 1982) . Upon infection with MHV3, fully susceptible strains (e.g., C57Bl/6J) die from FVH, semisusceptible strains (e.g., C3H/St) develop acute and then chronic hepatitis, and fully resistant strains (e.g., A/J) display no signs of liver disease (MacPhee et al., 1985) . These observations suggest that host genetic factors may underlie FVH. The lack of FVH in patients with any of the >350 known primary immunodeficiencies (Picard et al., 2018) suggests that FVH is unlikely to result from inborn errors that broadly disrupt innate and/or adaptive immunity. Instead, previous discoveries that other severe viral diseases striking otherwise healthy individuals, such as epidermodysplasia verruciformis, fulminant EBV disease, herpes simplex encephalitis, severe pulmonary influenza, severe rhinovirus respiratory disease, and severe varicella zoster virus disease, can result from single-gene inborn errors of protective immunity to specific viruses in specific cell types or tissues (Casanova, 2015a,b; Casanova and Abel, 2018) suggest that FVH may result from inborn errors selectively disrupting immunity to hepatitis viruses in the liver. We tested this hypothesis by searching for genetic etiologies of FVH by whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a small cohort of patients.",

WES revealed a high rate of homozygosity among the siblings (5.60-6.51%), indicating that this family was consanguineous. We therefore hypothesized that a genetic etiology for FVH in this family would display autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance with complete penetrance. We thus searched for very rare (minor allele frequency [MAF] <0.001) homozygous nonsynonymous variants present in the patient but not in her two siblings (Table S1) . Six genes had variants meeting these criteria (Table S2) . We prioritized candidate genes for further studies based on (i) the known function of the gene in the liver and/or immunity and (ii) the predicted deleteriousness of the variations. IL18BP, encoding the IL-18 binding protein, was the most plausible disease-causing gene, as (i) it encodes a constitutively secreted, naturally circulating neutralizer of the cytokine IL-18 (Aizawa et al., 1999; Novick et al., 1999) , the mouse orthologue of which is known to be toxic to the liver (Okamura et al., 1995) , and (ii) the patient carried a 40-nt homozygous deletion centered on an intron-exon boundary within this gene.",

This mutation, c.508-19_528del, deletes 19 nt from the fourth and last intron and 21 contiguous nt from the fifth and last exon ( Fig. 1 B) . It is predicted, in silico, to be highly deleterious, with a combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) score of 28.2 (Kircher et al., 2014) , which is above the mutation significance cutoff (MSC) score of 12.2 for IL18BP (Itan et al., 2016; Fig. 1 C) . IL18BP has a gene damage index (GDI) of 2.05 (Itan et al., 2015) , indicating a moderate level of accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations in the general population. Indeed, GnomAD includes only four missense variants (p.V23I, p.R121Q, p.P184L, and p.Q192H) in the homozygous state. Their CADD scores range from 0.001 to 23.3 ( Fig. 1 C) . Two substitutions, p.R121Q and p.Q192H, are common among Africans, with MAFs of 8.23 and 3.11%, respectively, and the patient was also found to be homozygous for p.R121Q. The other two missense variants, p.V23I and p.P184L, have a global MAF <0.1% (Fig. 1 C) . Finally, none of the databases included copy number variations encompassing IL18BP in the homozygous state. Collectively, these findings suggested that homozygosity for the private and probably deleterious c.508-19_528del allele in IL18BP may be the underlying cause of FVH in this patient.",

            "text": "Mutation c.508-19_528del causes aberrant IL18BP mRNA splicing The canonical IL18BP transcript (NM_173042) contains five exons in total, encoding a protein of 194 aa, also annotated as IL-18BPa, with an N-terminal signal peptide (1-30 aa) and an Ig-like domain (31-166 aa) responsible for binding to IL-18 ( Fig. 1 D) . The c.508-19_528del mutation, which encompasses the last 19 nt of intron 4 and the first 21 nt of exon 5 (encoding aa , is predicted to impair the splicing of the last exon, thereby affecting the Ig-like domain and the C-terminal part of IL-18BP ( Fig. 1 D) . We investigated the impact of this deletion on IL18BP expression in available material from the patient and other family members. Leukocyte gDNA and liver tissue sections were the only materials available for the deceased patient. In quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses with different probes detecting various IL-18BPa transcript variants, we found that IL18BP mRNA levels in heterozygous EBV-transformed B cells (EBV-B cells) from a sibling and both parents were \u223c50% lower than those in homozygous WT cells from another sibling and healthy controls (Figs. 2 A and S1 A). This suggested that c.508-19_528del was loss-of-expression at the mRNA level. We then amplified the 39 end of the IL18BP cDNA, to determine whether the c.508-19_528del allele generated novel splice variants in the EBV-B cells of the heterozygous sibling (Figs. 2 B and S1 B). We detected three new polyadenylated transcript variants (M1-M3) that also carried the cis p.R121Q mutation (Fig. 2  C) . We confirmed these findings through the transient expression of IL18BP exons with a 39 terminal exon-trapping vector (pTAG4) in COS7 cells (Fig. S1 , C-E). In particular, M1 and M2 seemed to have no stop codons before the polyadenylation site. However, qPCR on EBV-B cells from WT controls and heterozygous family members showed that all mutant variants were barely detectable and present in much smaller amounts than the WT form ( Fig. 2 D) . These findings confirmed that c.508-19_528del results in a skipping of the initial sequences of exon 5, without leakiness, and the generation of three novel IL18BP transcripts with a shorter terminal exon. Two of these new transcripts have no stop codon, and all three are rapidly degraded. These data suggest that the patient had AR complete IL-18BP deficiency.",

We then analyzed protein production from the four nonsynonymous IL18BP alleles found in the homozygous state in GnomAD (the common variants p.R121Q and p.Q192H and the rare variants p.V23I and p.P184L). The pattern of expression of these variants with a C-terminal 6x-His tag in COS7 cells was similar to that of the WT (Figs. 2 F and S1 G). We investigated the functional impact of all variants by an in vitro IL-18BP bioassay in which human IL-18BP inhibits the IL-12/IL-18-induced production of IFN-\u03b3 by the natural killer (NK)-92 cell line (Kim et al., 2000; Fig. S1 H) . We compared the activity of WT and mutant IL-18BP obtained from the concentrated supernatants of COS7 cells transfected with empty vector, WT, or mutant IL-18BP constructs. All four missense proteins had normal IL-18-inhibiting activity, whereas M1, M2, and M3 did not block IL-18 activity at all (Fig. 2 G) . Similar results were obtained for the mutant constructs (M1-M3) generated with or without the common missense allele (p.R121Q) carried by the patient (Fig. S1 , I-K). Overall, the c.508-19_528del allele encodes barely detectable M1, M2, and M3 isoforms, all of which lack IL-18-neutralizing function, probably due to their altered protein expression, in terms of pattern and molecular weight. These findings indicate that the patient had AR complete IL-18BP deficiency, whereas individuals from the general population carrying homozygous IL18BP variants had normal IL-18BP expression and function. These findings suggest , and four missense alleles from GnomAD (F) in concentrated supernatants from transiently transfected COS7 cells.

We analyzed the expression patterns of IL-18, IL-18BP, and the two chains of IL-18R, IL-18R1 and IL-18RAP, in several human cell lines acting as surrogates of liver-resident cells: Hep3B (hepatocytes), HUVECs (endothelial cells), LX-2 (hepatic stellate cells), SV40 fibroblasts, THP1 (monocytes), NKL (NK cells), Jurkat (T cells), and Raji (B cells) cells. We assessed mRNA and protein levels at baseline and following stimulation with various inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IFN-\u03bb, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-15, IL-18, IL-22, and IL-27 (Figs. S2 and S3). We found that THP1 cells were major producers of IL-18, whereas IL-18 was either present at very low levels or undetectable in other cell types ( . Of note, we did not detect rare alternative splicing forms of IL18BP, namely IL18BPb, IL18BPc, or IL18BPd (Novick et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2000) , in HepG2 (hepatocyte) cells, THP1 cells, or primary human hepatocytes, as previously reported to be absent in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; Veenstra et al., 2002 ; data not shown). Finally, we found that both chains of IL-18R were expressed principally in NKL cells (Fig. S2, E and F; and Fig. S3 ). These observations, consistent with previous reports (Lebel-Binay et al., 2000) , suggest that IL-18 is mostly produced by macrophages in the liver, and that it induces IFN-\u03b3 production, particularly by NK cells, which in turn triggers intrahepatic IL-18BP secretion, mostly from hepatocytes and macrophages. Thus, IL-18BP, which is induced strongly by IFN-\u03b3, can buffer intrahepatic IL-18 activity through negative feedback.",

We thus performed immunohistochemical staining on liver sections from the IL-18BP-deficient patient described in this study, an unrelated patient with FVH due to HAV, and an individual without liver inflammation. Only very small numbers of hepatocytes were detected in the liver tissues of the two FVH patients (Figs. 3 and S4) . However, the IL-18BP-deficient patient and the unrelated FVH patient had higher proportions of T cells (CD3 + , CD4 + , or CD8 + ), perforin-positive cells (attributed to CD8 + T and NK cells), NK cells (CD57 + or NKp46 + ), B cells (CD20 + ), M1 and M2 (CD68 + ) macrophages, and M2 (CD163 + ) macrophages than the control individual ( Figs. 3 and S4) . These observations indicate a massive loss of hepatocytes and inflammatory cell accumulation in the livers of FVH patients. Moreover, the IL-18 staining was abnormally high in the liver tissues of FVH patients. This cytokine was detected in both macrophages and hepatocytes in these patients, whereas it was barely detectable overall and found only in macrophages in healthy liver sections (Figs. 3 and S4). IL-18BP was not detected in liver sections from controls or patients (data not shown; Materials and methods). Collectively, these data suggest that, in baseline conditions, IL-18 is produced mostly by macrophages in the liver, but that hepatocytes also produce IL-18 during viral infection.",

Moreover, IL-18, together with IL-2, enhances the activation and in vitro cytotoxic activity of human peripheral NK cells (Son et al., 2001; Nielsen et al., 2016) . IL-2-stimulated human liver NK cells have also been shown to be strongly cytotoxic, even more so than peripheral blood NK cells, to human HepG2 hepatocytes (Ishiyama et al., 2006) . We therefore generated an in vitro model to test IL-18/IL-18BP-regulated hepatotoxicity through the coculture of HepG2 and NK-92 cells, which display a phenotype similar to liver-resident NK cells in humans (Le Bouteiller et al., 2002) . NK cells activated with IL-18 killed significantly more hepatocytes than unstimulated NK cells at various NK-cell-to-hepatocyte ratios (Fig. S5 , A-C). As expected, IL-18BP completely rescued IL-18-induced NK cell-mediated hepatotoxicity (Fig. S5 , A-C). We also showed that IL-18, together with IL-2, increased in vitro cytotoxicity of PBMCs from healthy donors against HepG2 cells, and that IL-18BP could prevent the IL-18-induced toxicity (Fig. S5 D) . Finally, we infected HepG2 or Huh7.5 hepatocytes with HAV ( Fig. S5 E; Materials and methods). We showed that IL-18-activated NK cells killed both infected and uninfected hepatocytes, and that this cytotoxicity was reversed by the addition of IL-18BP (Fig. 4, A  and B) . Overall, these findings support a model in which the genetically determined absence of IL-18BP in the patient with FVH by HAV leads to uncontrolled IL-18-mediated cytotoxic activity against hepatocytes, involving NK and T cells, the most abundant lymphocytes in the liver, in particular, thereby exacerbating liver destruction (Fig. 4 C ).",

Causality is established on both genetic and mechanistic grounds, meeting the criteria for genetic studies in single patients (Casanova et al., 2014) . In contrast, it is unclear if the two autoimmune phenotypes of the patient, type I diabetes and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, are also due to IL-18BP deficiency. The child had AR complete IL-18BP deficiency, and there are \u22642.5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 such patients in the general population. IL-18 is a pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine that was initially discovered in mouse liver and has been reported to activate NK cells and T cells in addition to its potent IFN-\u03b3-inducing activity (Kaplanski, 2018) . Serum and hepatic concentrations of IL-18 and IFN-\u03b3 were high in patients with various forms of fulminant liver failure (Yumoto et al., 2002; Shinoda et al., 2006) . In particular, serum IL-18 was found to be dramatically elevated in patients with acute hepatitis due to HAV infection (Kim et al., 2018) . Moreover, mouse IL-18 has been shown to induce intrahepatic inflammatory cell recruitment and severe hepatotoxicity in various liver injury models (Tsutsui et al., 2000; Finotto et al., 2004; Kimura et al., 2011) , whereas IL-18BP has been shown to protect against IL-18-mediated fulminant hepatitis in mice (Faggioni et al., 2001; Fantuzzi et al., 2003; Shao et al., 2013) . Our findings indicate that uncontrolled IL-18 activity in humans is toxic to the liver, as previously demonstrated in mice, and that human IL-18BP is a potent liver-protective compound, acting as an antidote to IL-18. Recombinant human IL-18BP (Tadekinig Alfa; AB2 Bio) has been approved for clinical use for indications unrelated to liver conditions and proposed as a treatment for preventing acetaminophen hepatotoxicity (Bachmann et al., 2018) . We provide proof-of-principle that FVH can be caused by single-gene inborn errors of immunity to HAV in the liver. Our findings also reveal the essential functions of IL-18 and IL-18BP in humans. By inference from previous human genetic study of other isolated infections, which are characterized by genetic heterogeneity but physiological homogeneity (Casanova, 2015a,b; Israel et al., 2017; Tangye et al., 2017; de Jong et al., 2018; Hernandez et al., 2018; Mart\u00ednez-Barricarte et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018) , there might be other genetic etiologies of FVH that impair IL-18BP or enhance IL-18 activity. Furthermore, neutralizing endogenous IL-18, particularly with recombinant IL-18BP, might be beneficial to patients with FVH caused by HAV and possibly other viruses.",

Tests for anti-islet cell and antiinsulin autoantibodies were positive, but no anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies were detected (Table S4 ). In 2009, anti-thyroglobulin autoantibodies were detected, but tests for anti-glutaminase, anti-endomysium, and antithyroperoxidase antibodies were negative. Celiac disease was therefore excluded. In 2011, the patient was diagnosed with Hashimoto thyroiditis, and tests for anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies were positive (Table S4 ). The patient was treated with levothyroxine. In 2013, the patient presented with fatigue, nausea, and hepatomegaly. She tested positive for HAV IgM on presentation, consistent with primary HAV infection. Serology and PCR results were negative for HBV (other than the presence of anti-HBs due to prior vaccination), HCV, or HEV. The patient was seropositive for CMV and EBV and negative for HIV and HTLV1 and 2. PCR tests for enterovirus were negative. No liver autoantibodies (anti-NA, anti-SMA, anti-LKM1, anti-LC1, anti-SLA, or anti-mitochondria) were detected, excluding autoimmune hepatitis. The patient had no history of exposure to hepatotoxic drugs, and screening tests for such drugs were negative. Liver function tests were as follows: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 2,181 IU/liter; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 2,582 IU/liter; \u03b3-glutamyl transferase (GGT), 73 IU/liter; total bilirubin, 274 \u03bcmol/liter; conjugated bilirubin, 173 \u03bcmol/ liter; prothrombin time (PT), 67%; and Factor V, 100% (Table S5) . On day 8 of infection, the patient was hospitalized for incoherent speech, jaundice, appetite loss, gingival bleeding, and petechiae. During physical examination at the emergency unit, the patient was unconscious, with icterus, hepatomegaly, and a fever (40\u00b0C). The patient was diagnosed with FVH due to HAV infection. On day 9, liver function tests revealed high levels of cytolysis, with a PT of 14%, factor V levels at 30%, and a Glasgow coma scale score of 8 (Table S5 ). The patient underwent liver transplantation but died a day later of multiple organ failure (day 11). Histological examinations of the native and explanted liver showed 95% hepatocellular necrosis with polymorphic inflammation. The patient had been vaccinated against BCG, Haemophilus influenzae type b, pneumococcus, flu, HBV, and MMR with no adverse effects. She was not tested for immunodeficiency. Her polymorphonuclear cell counts were consistently in the normal range (Table S6 ). Both parents were seropositive for HAV (IgM-negative) and had normal transaminase levels at the time of the patient's illness (data not shown). The patient's two siblings (III.2 and III.3) had IgM antibodies against HAV and were admitted to hospital 2 d after she died, but neither developed FVH. The patient's older brother (III.2), born in 2005, had diarrhea and four vomiting episodes 2 d before hospitalization. On arrival at the hospital, his clinical examination was normal, with no fever, weight loss, icterus, encephalopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly. His laboratory findings on day 1 were as follows: ALT, 42 IU/liter; AST, 44 IU/ liter; GGT, 55 IU/liter; hemoglobin, 14.8 g/dl; total bilirubin, 6 \u03bcmol/liter; C-reactive protein <5; and PT, 100%. Basic metabolic tests gave normal results. The findings on day 2 were as follows: ALT, 35 IU/liter; AST, 36 IU/liter; GGT, 48 IU/liter; total bilirubin, 10 \u03bcmol/liter; and PT, 89%. Acute HAV infection was diagnosed. On day 3, no vomiting or diarrhea was observed. Hepatic data had returned to normal except for GGT (41 IU/liter), PT (100%), and Factor V (93%; Table S5 ).",

Only indel-inframe, indel-frameshift, start-lost, missense, nonsense, stop-lost, and essential splice-site (splice acceptor and splice donor) variants were retained for further analysis. Given the rare occurrence of FVH in children, we excluded common polymorphisms with an AF of \u22650.1% in public databases: EVS, 1000 Genomes, and GnomAD, including variants with an AF \u22650.1% in each ethnic subpopulation (African, Ashkenazi Jewish, Finnish, non-Finnish European, South Asian, East Asian, and Latino) in GnomAD. In silico predictions of the impact of variants were evaluated with the following algorithms: GDI (http://pec630. rockefeller.edu:8080/GDI/; Itan et al., 2015) , CADD (https:// cadd.gs.washington.edu/score; Kircher et al., 2014) , and MSC (http://pec630.rockefeller.edu:8080/MSC/; Itan et al., 2016) .

Total RNA was isolated with a Qiagen RNeasy kit, using EBV-B cells from healthy controls and the healthy siblings and parents of the patient. For qPCR analysis, cDNA samples generated with oligo-dT primer and the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used to determine the relative levels of IL18BP expression, by amplification of the cDNA generated with TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix and various TaqMan probes detecting the transcript variants encoding IL-18BPa: Hs00931914 (probe 1), Hs00931907 (probe 2), Hs00931908 (probe 3), and Hs00934414 (probe 4; Thermo Fisher Scientific). We used an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system with the following program: 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. We calculated qPCR efficiency and the amplification factor for each assay by the standard curve method (Nolan et al., 2006) and used them to determine relative expression levels for IL18BP normalized against endogenous GAPDH (4310884E; Thermo Fisher Scientific) expression in each sample. For relative quantification of the WT and mutant IL18BP transcript variants, we used PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system with the following program: 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 95\u00b0C for 2 min, 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 63\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s (data collection), followed by the melting curve protocol: 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 63\u00b0C for 1 min, 95\u00b0C for 30 s (1% ramp-rate), and 60\u00b0C for 15 s. The primer pairs for each mutant variant (M1, M2, and M3) were designed with the NCBI Primer-BLAST tool (https://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/). The specificity of these primers was assessed by melting curve analysis and confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the qPCR products. Relative copy numbers were determined by the standard curve method with plasmids containing the WT or mutant IL18BP sequences, followed by normalization against endogenous GAPDH (Primer-Bank ID: 378404907c1) levels. The sequences of the SYBR Green qPCR primers are provided in Table S7 . All qPCR experiments were performed in duplicate with two independent RNA preparations.",

Briefly, cDNA was synthesized with an adapter primer (AP-1) and SuperScript II Reverse transcription (Thermo Fisher Scientific) from total RNA isolated from the EBV-B cells of a healthy control and the patients' siblings. The first PCR amplification of 39 partial cDNA ends was performed with a forward primer (F Ex1 ) specific to IL18BP exon 1 and a universal amplification primer (UAP)-1 binding to AP-1. The PCR products were purified and used for nested PCR with an IL18BP-specific primer (F Ex1-2 ) spanning the junction of exons 1 and 2 and an abridged UAP. The final amplicons generated from the WT and heterozygous sibling samples were ligated into the pGEM-T-Easy vector (Promega), and the colonies were sequenced. For in vitro 39 terminal exon-trapping experiments, 1,558-bp DNA fragments starting with a 39-fragment of IL18BP intron 3 (43 bp) were amplified from the gDNA samples of the WT sibling and the patient, with pTAG4-IL18BP forward and reverse primers. These fragments were between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pTAG4 vector. The pTAG4 exon-trapping vector (Krizman and Berget, 1993) was kindly provided by Dr. Anders Lade Nielsen (Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark). COS7 cells were transfected with one WT and one mutant clone in the presence of X-tremeGENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche). After 16 h, total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), treated with DNase (Turbo DNA-free Kit; Invitrogen), and used for cDNA synthesis with the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Life Technologies) and an adapter primer (AP-2; Blechingberg et al., 2007) . The first PCR was performed with a specific primer (F AD1-2 ) spanning the junction of AD exons 1 and 2, and the UAP-2, which binds to AP-2 (Blechingberg et al., 2007) . This reaction was followed by nested PCR with a specific primer (F AD2-Ex4 ) encompassing the junction of AD exon 2 and IL18BP exon 4 and a reverse primer (R UTR ) binding to the end of the IL18BP 39 UTR. The nested PCR products were inserted into the pGEM-T-Easy vector, and the colonies were sequenced. Successful and equivalent cDNA synthesis was confirmed by the amplification by PCR of HPRT1, as the housekeeping gene control. SnapGene was used to analyze the DNA sequences of the clones. All clones carrying PCR artifacts or sequences not matching the IL18BP canonical transcript were excluded from subsequent analyses. Digital images were captured by the Amersham Imager 600 (GE Healthcare, Life Sciences). The primer sequences are provided in Table S7 .",

The forward primer (IL18BP BamHI) included a BamHI site and a Kozak consensus sequence, whereas the reverse primer (IL18BP-His XbaI) contained an in-frame coding sequence for a C-terminal 6x-His tag and an XbaI site. SDM to generate the IL18BP variants present in GnomAD (p.V23I, p.R121Q, and p.P184L) was performed by a modified overlapextension PCR-based method (Shimada, 1996) . IL18BP BamHI/ SDM-reverse primers and SDM-forward/IL18BP-His XbaI primers were used to amplify the mutated IL18BP in two separate reactions, using the pEF-BOS-EX-IL18BP-His WT plasmid as the template. Each PCR product was were purified, and the different products were mixed without primers for overlap-extension PCR. SDM for the p.Q192H allele was performed by one-step PCR with the IL18BP BamHI and Q192H-His-XbaI primers. Novel IL18BP transcript variants (M1, M2, and M3) were generated with the IL18BP BamHI and SDM-reverse primers or the SDM-forward and mutant reverse primers (containing an in-frame coding sequence for a C-terminal 6x-His tag, a stop codon, and an XbaI site) in two separate reactions, using the pEF-BOS-EX-IL18BP-His WT plasmid and control gDNA, respectively, as templates. The M1 and M2 transcripts were cloned including an 18-nt polyadenylation insert upstream of the 6x-His tag, followed by a stop codon. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Native explanted livers are usually fixed in formalin at room temperature for 3-8 d, while most other tissue samples are fixed for 6-72 h. This long immersion in formalin may be responsible for alteration of some epitopes and for increased background signals when performing immunohistochemistry. Moreover, the most efficient kits available for immunohistochemistry include a streptavidin-biotin amplification step. This may also explain the increased background signals during immunohistochemistry staining, as hepatocytes contain endogenous biotin. Although IL-18BP staining was validated on control transfected cell lines, the staining observed in healthy or diseased livers was not significantly different from the staining detected with the diluent without the primary antibody as negative control (unpublished data).

Cells were then permeabilized for 10 min using PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by blocking for 1 h with PBS + 5% goat serum (005-000-121; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells were stained with primary antibodies against HAV (mouse anti-HAV VP1, K2-4F2; Creative Biolabs; mouse anti-HAV, 7E7; Mediagnost) at 1:1,000 overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by staining with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 at 1:1,000 and DAPI at 1:5,000 for 1 h at room temperature. All antibody dilutions were performed in PBS + 5% goat serum. Finally, cells were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 fluorescent microscope, and images were processed with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Total RNA and supernatants harvested from infected HepG2 and Huh7.5 cells were used for expression analysis of IL18 and IL18BP by qPCR and ELISA, as described above; however no mRNA and protein induction of IL18 or IL18BP was detected in HAV-infected HepG2 or Huh7.5 hepatocytes (data not shown).",

(A and B) Coculture of mock-or HAV-infected hepatocytes (HepG2 and Huh7.5 cells) with NK-92 cells pretreated with IL-18, IL-18 + IL-18BP, or IL-18BP. HAV infection efficiencies in HepG2 and Huh7.5 cells were \u223c40% and~100%, respectively (Fig. S5 E;Materials and methods). The relative survival of calcein-AM-stained HepG2 or Huh7.5 cells was calculated based on the measurement of fluorescence retention within cells (A) and the amount of secreted albumin (B). Relative fluorescence and albumin levels were determined by normalization against the mean value for hepatocytes cocultured with NK92 cells without pretreatment (not treated[NT]), set to 100. A decrease in the fluorescence or in albumin levels indicates an increase in NK cell-induced hepatotoxicity. The data shown are the means \u00b1 SEM of three independent experiments performed in quadruplicate (n.s., not significant; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). (C) A proposed model for IL-18BP deficiency underlying FVH. During the course of acute HAV infection in an otherwise healthy individual (left), IL-18 is secreted by macrophages in the liver. This cytokine activates lymphocytes, such as NK cells, inducing IFN-\u03b3 production and cytotoxicity to eliminate HAV-infected cells. IFN-\u03b3 also induces IL-18BP secretion by hepatocytes, macrophages, and other nonparenchymal cells (endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and hepatic stellate cells), to buffer IL-18 activity. However, in the absence of IL-18BP (right), excessive IL-18 activity leads to uncontrolled, massive immune-mediated hepatotoxicity and severe liver injury, as in the IL-18BP-deficient individual with FVH.Belkaya et al.Journal of Experimental Medicine",
