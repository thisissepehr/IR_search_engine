The nonlinear infection rate is used to capture the dynamics of overcrowded infectious networks and high viral loads. We simulate numerically the model for distinct values of the quarantine times.

Nevertheless, this type of quarantine is innefficient, due to the high values of the rate at which new hosts entering the network are patched. Dynamic quarantine methods, based on the principle 'assume guilty before proven innocent' have been proposed to mitigate this problem [14, 9, 12] . This dynamic quarantine method diminishes the negative effect of false alarms, produced by worm anomaly detection systems. A host is quarantined whenever he has a suspicious behavior, and after some time he is released from quarantine. Once a host is quarantined, security assistants should inspect it as soon as possible. False quarantined hosts won't be blocked for a long period, since quarantine is released after some time. This dynamic quarantine method can be built on any worm anomaly detection systems. Other quarantine measures, such as pulse quarantine, have been proposed recently in the literature, due to optimistic results from epidemic models using pulse vaccination [11] . Pulse vaccination allows systems to stabilize at disease-free equilibrium faster than constant vaccination.
