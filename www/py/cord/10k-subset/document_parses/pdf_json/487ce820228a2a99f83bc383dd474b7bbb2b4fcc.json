            "text": "An autoimmune pathogeneses, at least in part, has been postulated for schizophrenia. Susceptibility to autoimmunity is strongly influenced by the genes clustered in the HLA region on chromosome 6, and linkage in a proportion of pedigrees has been reported in nearby markers. There is a negative association between schizophrenia and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease positively associated with HLA-DR4. Wright et al. (1996) postulated that there should therefore be a negative association between the DR4 allele and schizophrenia. In addition, a negative association between schizophrenia and DQB 1\"0602 has been reported in American blacks (Nimgaonkar et al. 1993) , and Chinese males (Zhang et al. 1994) . We attempted to re-examine these findings in 229 familial schizophrenic probands and 248 unrelated controls at the DRB region, and 241 familial schizophrenic probands and 257 unrelated controls at the DQB region using the PCR-SSOP technique. The frequencies of DR4 in patients and controls was respectively 35.8 per cent vs. 35.8 per cent, and the frequencies of DQBI*0602 in patients and controls was respectively 29.5 per cent vs. 27.6 per cent. These findings do not support the initial hypotheses. Some of the discrepancy may be due to study design in that the control frequencies in the Wright et al study were higher than in other samples from the region. It is also possible that the HLA association with schizophrenia is due to linkage disequilibrium with unidentified gene(s) within the HLA region which is less strong in the Irish population, particularly in the case of DQB 1\"0602 as significant results were found. Older people rate transportation as the third most important issue in their lives after health and incomeL Little is known about driving patterns and transportation use of older Irish adults: we report a community survey. The mean age was 72 + 5.4 (range 65-88 yr). Of 134 interviewed: 56 still drove (mean age 71.2 + 4.8), 59 had never driven (72.4 + 5.4) and 19 had stopped driving (72.7 + 6.8). The main reasons given for stopping driving included: Health 32 per cent; expense 26 per cent; traffic 11 per cent. Of the 56 drivers, 12 (21 per cent) were on psychoactive medication. The mean Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) of those driving was 28.2 (range 20-30). Only 1 current driver had a MMSE of less than 23. There were 3 patients with depression (5 per cent) among current drivers, but 16 per cent of former drivers were affected with depression. The number of accidents in 118 driver yrs which were reported was 5 -none of which involved any injury. Current drivers made much less use of public transport. Our results show that the self reported accident rate is low among the elderly. Driving is an important everyday function and health concerns are the major cause of driving cessation in one third of cases. Older drivers who continue to drive make less demands on public transport and appear to suffer from less depression. Health care interventions should therefore be aimed at supporting the older driver 2. Coagulation disturbance is an early event in the clinical course of meningoccal sepsis and low functional levels of the natural anticoagulants usually reflect disease severity. The acquired protein C (PC) deficiency seen in meningoeoccal infections is usually associated with purpura fulminans/septic shock -the lower its level at presentation the grealer the likelihood severe morbidity and mortality. Early replacement of PC may not only limit haemostatic activation, interrupt DIC, and ultimately restore the microcirculation with improvement in organ function but it also is most likely acting as a potent antiinflammatory agent We report 10 children with purpura fulminans related to meningococcemia in whom PC concentrate together with low dose heparin was successfully used early in the course of their disease. No adverse reaction was observed during.infusion or afterwards. In one patient heparin therapy was delayed by 24 hr. Haemofiltration and respiratory support was required in 9 patients during the early phase of their illness. All 10 children are alive with only I having had limb amputation, We believe that PC concentrate is safe to use in children with purpura fulminans secondary tO acquired PC deficiency. Its true efficacy and safety can only be assessed via a double-blind, randomised, controlled multicentre trial.",

PEFR and SaO2 changes were not related suggesting that the fall in SaO2 in some subjects was not due to increased airways obstruction but to increased ventilation perfusion imbalance. It appears advisable to use an oxygen driven nebuliser for salbutamol when this is available. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can impair the immune system both locally and systemically which may facilitate turnout promotion. We investigated the effects Solar Simulated radiation (SSR) on the contact hypersensitivity response (CHS) in irradiated normal and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) patients compared tO their respective unirradiated control groups. Sixteen healthy volunteers and 19 patients with NMSC received 3 times the minimal erythemal dose on buttock skin and then seusitised with Diphencyprone (DPC) within this site. CHS was elicited 1 month later on unirradiated arm skin. Ten unirradiated healthy and 11 NMSC patients were similarly sensitised and challenged. Results show no difference in the challenge concentration to elicit CHS between the 2 unirradiated control groups (p=0.5) but was higher for the irradiated normal compared to the unirradiated normal group (p=0.03) and also higher for the irradiated NMSC group compared to their unirradiated controls (p=0.00 I) signifying reduced sensitivity. This concentration was also higher in the irradiated NMSC patients compared to the irradiated normals (p=0.03)(Mann-Whitney). 2/16 irradiated normals and 11/19 irradiated NMSC patients required a threshold concentration to elicit CHS that was higher than the maximum threshold concentration observed in the control groups suggesting susceptibility to UVR induced immunosuppression in these patients. This trait was significantly greater in the NMSC group, p=0.013 (Fisher's Exact Test). These results show that a single dose of SSR suppresses the CHS in normal and NMSC patients. Because susceptibility to this effect is significantly in the later it would seem to be a risk factor for skin cancer development.",

Free radical mediated low-density lipoprotein(LDL) oxidation may play a causal role in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and this may be inhibited by natural antioxidants contained in LDL. Vitamin E (ct-tocopherol) is the most abundant and active endogenous antioxidant in LDL but the relationship between its content in LDL and the susceptibility of LDL to metal ion-dependent in vitro oxidation is controversial. We investigated plasma and LDL r levels and copper sulphate induced LDL oxidation in 33 middle aged healthy subjects (18 male). LDL was isolated from plasma by ultracentrifugation and the susceptibility to oxidation was determined as the lag phase of the production of conjugated dienes, o~-tocopherol was measured by HPLC~ Linear regression analysis revealed that plasma lipid standardized a-tocopherol level is positively associated with its content in LDL (r=0.54 p<0.05). A weak but significant correlation between the lag phase of diene production and the concentration of a-tocopherol in either plasma or LDL was found (r=0.54 and 0.59, plasma and LDL respectively, p<0.02 for both). The results suggest that copper induced in vitro LDL oxidation, the most commonly employed method for estimating the resistance of LDL to oxidative stress, may be greatly influenced by LDL vitamin E level and the high intake of vitamin E may possibly lower the incidence of atherosclerotic events.",

References Angiotensin II and potassium are the major stimulators of aldosterone (Aldo) production. It is also known that ACTH is a potent stimulator of Aldo production in vitro. To assess the role of ACTH in maintaining Aldo levels in vivo the relationship of Aldo and plasma renin activity (PRA) was examined in 7 ambulatory normal subjects under conditions of normal and undetectable ACTH levels. Blood samples for Aldo and PRA measurement were obtained at 2 hourly intervals for 10 h on a control day and following dexamethasone (Dex), 0.5 mg every 6 h for 24 h. The Aldo/PRA ratio was used as a sensitive indirect index of the responsiveness of aldosterone secretion to adrenal stimulation with angiotensin. Vitamin E, the most important lipophilic antioxidant, protecfs biological materials from free radical mediated oxidation but it is oxidised and loses its antioxidant function. Oestrogen is thought to be antioxidant and may regenerate vitamin E(txtocopherol). We investigated the possibility that oestrogen may inhibit ex vivo low-density lipoprotein(LDL) oxidation by reducing the consumption of ct-tocopherol. We also studied if oral hormone replacement therapy(HRT) containing oestrogen may affect in vitro LDL oxidation. LDL was isolated by ultracentrifugation. In vitro oxidation was induced by adding copper sulphate and determined as the lag phase of conjugated dienes production while in vivo oxidation was determined as the titres of autoantibody to oxidatively modified-LD.L, ct-tocopherol was measured by HPLC. Addition of 17 g-oestradiol at the concentration of 1 to 8 Ixmol/l showed a significant inhibition to oxidation in a dose-dependent manner but the consumption of {x-tocopherol over time was not delayed. In 18 healthy postmenopausal women receiving combined oestrogen/ progestogen HRT for 6 months, neither LDL vitamin E content (234+0.54 vs 2.27_+0.47 nmol/mg LDL, baseline and 6 months, respectively), lag phase (51.2+7.5 vs 52.7+10.2 min.), nor the titres of antibody to oxidised-LDL (1.58_+0.16 vs 1.66+0.17) were altered. The results suggest that although in vitro oestrogen appears to be an effective antioxidant, it does not preserve vitamin E during oxidation and an in vivo antioxidant function was not seen. This lack of antioxidant effect may be due to its extremely low concentration in vivo.",

We report the profile and outcome of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at an Irish regional centre with a primary catchment area of 200,000 for diabetes care. We reviewed 92 consecutive episodes of DKA treated from 1990-96. DKA was defined as blood pH <7.30 and/or serum bicarbonate <15 mmol/l and urine ketostix >++. Patients were routinely admitted to the intensive care unit with a standard protocol (bicarbonate not used). Patient education was reviewed routinely after episodes. The mean age was 39 + 23 years (s.d.) (range 10-83), 57 per cent female. Twelve per cent were newly diagnosed diabetics. Approximate average incidence was 6.7/100,000 per yr. Of previously known diabetics (n=82), 73 per cent had 2 or more episodes in this 7 yr interval.

Thromboembolic events frequently complicate the clinical course of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with Irish Journal of Medical Science this tendency occurring most frequently when the disease is clinically active, or after surgery. Thrombophilia may contribute to this tendency. Activated protein C resistance is the most recently described thrombophilic state and may account for up to 30 10 per cent of patients with thrombophilia. We determined the frequency of a range of thrombophilic abnormalities in an unselected group of patients with IBD attending our clinics, compared to a group of controls. Disease activity was assessed using the Harvey Bradshaw index for patients with Crohn's disease (CD), and the Truelove and Witts grading system for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Levels of protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, activated protein C resistance, fibrinogen and presence of a lupus inhibitor were determined. Twenty-eight patients with IBD were studied (mean age 39.5 yr, range 19-77 yr); 14 with CD (7 men and 7 women). Four patients had active disease. Three patients had a history of thrombotic episodes. Thirty-three controls included 23 men and 10 women (mean age 51.2 yr, range 19-89 yr). Lupus anticoagulant was detected in 7/28 patients in the IBD group (UC = 4, CD = 3) compared to 0/ 33 controls.

Ireland. A commercially available Clo test (| Delta West Pty Ltd) is the commonest endoscopy room test used for diagnosing Helicobacter pylori in gastric biopsies. It has previously been demonstrated that the Clo test is more sensitive if 2 biopsy specimens rather than 1 are used in the assay. An inexpensive rapid urease test (AS Arvind, The Lancet. 704, 1988 March) may also be used in the endoscopy room to diagnose H. pylori in biopsy material. We wished to directly compare this rapid urease test and the Clo test and to assess whether 2 biopsy specimens rather than 1 produce superior results with the Clo test. The effects of haemorrhage and a commonly used antifoaming agent on both tests were also investigated. Multiple biopsies were taken from 111 consecutive patients (mean + SD age: 53 + 19 yr) having an OGD. Further biopsies were also taken in a haemorrhage area adjacent to a previous biopsy and after the administration of antifoaming agent. The results were read every 5 minutes during the first h, every 15 minutes during the second h, every 30 minutes duririg the third and fourth h and at 24 h. At 24 h 51 of 111 Clo tests (46 per cent) containing 2 biopsies were positive and we regarded this as the 'gold standard' for the purpose of this study.

On separate days each drank within 15 minutes three standard drinks (35.5 ml each) of 37.5 per cent vodka (total alcohol content 4.05 units) plus 200 ml GFJ or diet coke. Nicotinic acid (50 or 100 mg) was given 1 h prior to the intake of alcohol in diet coke. Venous blood was collected at 1 and 2 h after finishing the drink and analyzed for alcohol using enzymatic methods (Sigma diagnostics). Mean (mg/100 ml + SEM) blood alcohol when consumed in diet coke was 40.92 + 3.05 & 33.98 + 2.40at 1 & 2 h respectively. When taken in GFJ the values were 31.43 + 2.97 and 32.10 + 2.39 at 1 and 2 h. respectively. One h values were also significantly lower than values attained after the consumption of alcohol in diet coke (p<0.02 paired 't' test). Nicotinic acid on the other hand increased the amount of alcohol present in blood and concentrations after its 50 mg intake were 47.79 + 2.68 and 37.08 + 3.12 at 1 and 2 h. respectively. Following an intake of 100 mg nicotinic acid, the values recorded at 1 and 2 h were 46.55 + 5.50 and 31.43 + 2.97 respectively. While the blood concentration after nicotinic acid consumption was higher from the control value at 1 h of alcohol consumption, there was no difference in the blood concentration obtained after 50 mg and 100 mg of nicotinic acid. These studies suggest that common dietary constituents may have a significant influence on blood alcohol. The extent to which altered HRV parameters merely reflect the strong correlation with the underlying heart rate has not been defined. Heart rate data from 12 volunteers (22:00 to 06:00 h), after oral placebo, celiprolol 200 mg (beta partial agonist) or propranolol 80 mg (beta antagonist), investigated the relationship. All short term variables were linearly correlated but long-term variables exponentially related to the underlying heart rate. Conclusion. HRV increased following propranolol and decreased after celiprolol. The conventional time-domain HRV parameters do not permit an evaluation of whether variability is altered independent of heart rate or is entirely a consequence of the change in heart rate.

There is increasing evidence of ethnic differences in drug response which cannot be explained by differences in drug disposition. To further investigate this we measured the pupillary response (by infra-red photography) to 3 concentrations (low, medium, high) of a constricting (pilocarpine 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 per cent) and dilating (cocaine 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 per cent) agent in 31 Caucasian (Irish), 18 Chinese and 26 Iranian healthy subjects aged 18-26 yr.

In Ireland, in the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme, anti-depressant prescribing is rising by 7 per cent 8 per cent yearly, due mainly to increasing use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In the Eastern Health Board area, during 11 months of 1995, an average of 11,741 anti-depressant prescriptions / month was dispensed (70 per cent to females), tricylic agents (TCAs) comprising 67 per cent, SSRIs 26 per cent and 'others' 7 per cent. Some 1.5 per cent of prescriptions had 2 or more anti-depressants, while hypnotics were coprescribed in 30 per cent, anxiolytics in 30 per cent, antiepileptics in 5 per cent and anti-psychotics in 2 per cent. Some 8895 patients, 25 per cent of all individuals receiving a prescription, were dispensed an anti-depressant on 1 occasion only (TCA 64 per cent, SSRI 32 per cent, others 4 per cent). Of 3030 patients who commenced and continued therapy with TCAs (65 per cent) or SSRIs (35 per cent) between month 3 and 7, only 12 per cent and 15 per cent respectively collected a prescription every month, with little difference among the remainder in the drop-out rate. Some 26 per cent of those on TCAs but just 2 per cent of SSRI patients were continuously on less than 50 per cent of defined daily dose while 32 per cent and 51 per cent respectively were on 50-150 per cent and 2 per cent and 3 per cent were on more than 150 per cent. The remainder had dose changes throughout the period. Single dispensings, poor adherence and low dose TCA use are features of antidepressant prescribing in the GMS which merit further attention. A stratified quota sample of 22 practices in Northern Ireland obtained all prescription data over 2 wk. The principle diagnosis was CHF in 383 patients. The majority were prescribed a diuretic (79.9 per cent), but few received an ACE inhibitor (18.5 per cent). The mean daily dosages were for bumetanide (1.3 mg), frusemide (43.2 mg), captopril (50.3 mg), and l!sinopril (9.2 mg). Eleven CHF patients (2.9 per cent) were co-prescribed a beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist. Concurrent insomnia was common (11.2 per cent) in CHF, with 14.1 per cent co-prescribed a hypnotic drug. CHF was a minor indication (25.3 per cent) for ACE inhibitor compared with the hypertension indication (62.6 per cent). Despite contrary recommendations, 10.3 per cent of CHF patients taking ACE inhibitors received either potassium-sparing diuretic, or potassium supplementation, NSAID's were given for 7.5 per cent of CHF patients taking ACE inhibitors.",

            "text": "Treatment protocols for CHF appear to be poorly implemented in clinical practice. ACE inhibitors were under prescribed, and the dosage prescribed appeared suboptimal. The frequent diagnosis of insomnia in CHF patients may reflect inadequate symptom control; the intercurrent prescription of contra-indicated therapy is a worrying finding. Pharmacoepidemiology studies may assess how prescribing reflects therapeutic advances. Cardiovascular (CVS) and central nervous system (CNS) prescribing in a general hospital was reviewed by recording diagnoses and current drug therapy from charts and cardexs of 578 in-patients. Of 92 patients with stroke, 45 per cent were on anti-platelet agents, 13 per cent anticoagulatcd. Among 38 with atrial fibrillation, 29 per cent were on aspirin, 21 per cent anti-coagulated and 61 per cent on digoxin. Of 34 patients with myocardial infarction, 50 per cent were on aspirin, 12 per cent anti-coagulated, 21 per cent on an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and 12 per cent beta-blocked. Forty patients had heart failure; all were on diuretics, 28 per cent on ACEIs and 45 per cent on digoxin. Of patients on aspirin (114), warfarin (26), digoxin (70) and ACEIs (42), 86 per cent, 92 per cent, 84 per cent and 95 per cent respectively had an indication. Some 119 anti-depressants (61 per cent tricyclics (TCAs), 39 per cent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)) were prescribed to 109 patients, of whom 43 per cent had listed depression/CNS disorder. All SSRIs, but only 28 per cent of TCAs, were prescribed at 100 per cent or more of defined daily dose. Some 69 per cent were on anxiolytics, hypnotics or anti-psychotics concomitantly. Not one of 236 patients on hypnotics had a diagnosis of insomnia. Though the literature supports anti-coagulant, aspirin etc. use, contra-indications/reasons for not using such therapy were rarely documented. In contrast to TCAs, SSRIs were prescribed at optimal dosage. Compared with CVS, diagnostic review of CNS therapy was less likely to reveal an indication. Pharmacoepidemiology studies, in identifying and quantifying such uptake deficits, have potential to help optimise prescribing. The most common medical admitting diagnosis was circulatory [62 per cent] which parallelled the most common Rx -ATC class B & C [38 per cent]. GIT were 7 per cent diagnoses and 18 per cent Rx suggesting symptomatic prescribing as in CNS -7 per cent diagnoses and 16 per cent Rx; in these cases chart review revealed no indication for the Rx. These results suggest trends in types of and reasons for prescribing and we found it a useful means of auditing prescribing practices in a general hospital. Endothelial dysfunction is an important initiating event in the development of atherosclerosis. Impaired endothelial function with advancing age could promote atherosclerosis. The evidence for age related impairment of endothelial function in human studies is contradictory 1,z. The aim of this study was to determine whether endothelial function is altered with age. Sixteen healthy young subjects and 10 healthy older subjects underwent brachial artery cannulation. Acetylcholine (ACh) was infused to assess endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured during drug infusion using venous occlusion plethysmography. Results were Vol. 166, 1997 Supplement No. 5 Irish Journal of Medical Science expressed as change in FBF from baseline (ml 100ml -~ min -~) and analysed using repeated measures analysis of variance with basal blood flow as a covariate. There was no significant difference in response between the groups in response to ACh (p>0.05). In conclusion ageing is not associated with impaired er, tothelial function in healthy subjects. This suggests that advancing age alone does not explain the increased atherosclerosis seen in the elderly. Plantar fasciitis is diagnosed on the basis of heel tenderness localising to the medial tubercle of the calcaneus. Stress fracture of the os calcis and tarsal tunnel syndrome may present identically and cannot be completely differentiated on clinical examination or by plain radiography.

Younger patients were mostly drivers (37 per cent), cyclists (24 per cent) or motorcyclists (16 per cent). Older patients had a higher median Injury Severity Score, p < 0.05, were more likely to be female (p<0.05), involved in RTA's between 9 am-5pm (p<0.01) and have pre-existing medical conditions (p<0.001). The following were significantly increased in older patients (p values): surgical (<0.01), medical (<0.01) and therapist workload (p<0.05), complications (<0.0001), length of stay (<0.01). Less elderly were discharged directly to home (p<0.05). Strategies to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with RTA in the elderly should emphasize a) older pedestrians during daytime hours, b) attention to safety in public transport. Treatment must ensure adequate medical and therapist input to anticipate higher complication rates. A significant number of older medical and surgical patients have multiple diseases and functional impairments such that they require rehabilitation as an integral part of their treatment. As one of the main emphases of The Health Strategy is to provide care in the community where possible we decided to study the interface between hospital and community based rehabilitation services. Since 1980 a service, the District Care Unit (Community Wards) has provided a team consisting of physiotherapist, occupational therapist, team leader, public health nurse and home care attendants to help provide rehabilitation in the community A total of 53 patients were discharged to the District Care Unit in 1994/95 from Age-Related Health Care (an assessment and rehabilitation service for older medical patients). The average length of time taken to be accepted by the DCU was 17.8 days (range 5-30 days) in year 1 and 11.5 days (range 2-20 days) in year 2. Those with the longest delay tended to be discharged between the months of October and February which is the busiest period of referrals from the hospital. Summaries were received on 41 of the patients. Three patients refused assistance from the DCU and 4 patients were rejected as it was felt that they had reached their maximum potential and had no further rehabilitation potential. In average the patients received treatment over a period of 38.5 days (range 14-90 days). There was a very high correlation between a recommendation for physiotherapy in the hospital and in the second assessment by the DCU therapists. Our findings suggest that there is a high concordance between the therapists in the hospital and the community which may imply that second assessment may notbe indicated in all cases. There is a delay of 10-12 working days in starting rehabilitation which needs to be factored into any care plans and may limit the immediacy of the service. Medical staff often fail to detect functional impairment in older patients~: this has implications for accurate diagnosis, treatment and discharge. Functional assessment should be incorporated in clinical assessment'-but can be time-consuming and is not widely used: we propose a simple 5 question screen. We screened 63 patients (ages 67-94 yr, mean 80 yr) within 72 h of admission to an acute geriatric medical ward. The abbreviated mental test score (AMTS), the Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index (BADL) were also used: a BADL < 15/20 indicates significant functional impairment. An AMTS < 7 or > 3 negative answers on our scale had a sensitivity of 83 per cent and a specificity of 70 per cent for functional impairment on admission: corresponding values for functional impairment 1 month prior to admission were 89 per cent and 69 per cent. This simple scale has a high probability of detecting functional impairment, and a study on larger groups may further confirm its utility. The occurrence of swallow disorders (dysphagia) is common in older patients and is well documented in several clinical groupings e.g. acute stroke,progressive neurological diseases, head and neck surgery. However, there is little objective documentation to date to indicate prognosis and outcome for these populations. Outcome quantification is important for service provision and patient advice. This study evaluates and compares the outcome of swallow disorders in overt acute stroke and other presenting conditions. Retrospective analysis of speech and language therapy with videofluoroscopic records for a 12 month period was carried out. For each patient the following was documented:-1. Medical diagnosis. 2. Initial swallow status. 3. Videofluoroscopic assessment findings. 4. Intervention. 5. Functional outcome (measured according to outcome scale rating 1-9 as described by I indicating Nil Orally and 9 indicating a return to pre-morbid diet). Of 104 patients seen, 31 presented with overt acute stroke (OAS); the remaining 73 presented with aetiologies including progressive neurological diseases, respiratory disease, multiple medical problems, cerebral vascular disease, tracheostomy, general surgery. Patients with OAS generally had a good. functional outcome i.e. they mostly returned to pre-morbid feeding status, other groups indicated lower functional outcomes particularly those presenting with multiple medical aetiologies (p<0.05). Awareness of group prognosis can be helpful in therapy, prognosis and health service planning. The proportion of elderly drivers is increasing. For many older people the car is a vital link for maintaining an independent lifestyle. Loneliness, lower life satisfaction and lower activity levels are linked with the loss of driving ability among the elderly. Much of the legislation and literature on the older driver has an over-emphasis on selecting those who should not drive rather than enabling and empowering older drivers. In Ireland, the assessment of the older driver has been non-structured, and the need has been fuelled by the requirement for medical certification of drivers over the age of 70. The Centre for Mobility Enhancement was founded in 1996 to maximise mobility of older drivers. We report on the first 10 patients assessed, using a cascade methodology: doctor + occupational therapist q-_ specialized Driving assessment:",

A collateral history was also obtained whenever possible One hundred and fifty new patients were referred. A CAGE questionnaire was administered to 143 of these patients. Eleven patients screened positive for alcoholism on the CAGE. On obtaining their psychiatric and collateral histories a further 12 patients were found to suffer from alcoholism. In this particular group the CAGE questionnaire was found to have a sensitivity Vol. 166, 1997 Supplement No. 5 for alcoholism of 48 per cent and a specificity of 100 per cent.",

Joint care allowed a comprehensive assessment and initiation of treatment of this patient group. The inclusion of such a unit is a worthwhile consideration in any general hospital psychiatric service. The majority of violent incidents recorded in a drug treatment centre, were of grade l severity; verbal abuse/anti-social behaviour. Incidents occurred between December 1991 and July 1996. Forty-nine per cent of patients involved were HIV positive. This rate did not reflect the seroprevalance of 2 per cent in the clinic population. The clinical records regarding HIV status of 28 patients at the time of the incident, were reviewed. All except 2, were reviewed within 6 months of the incident. There were 22 males and 6 females. Their mean age was 30.1 (range 23-41). Twenty-eight patients were involved in 2 prior incidents and 5 patients in one prior incident. Centre of Disease Control (CDC) stages were stage II -n--15 (55 per cent), stage III-n=9 (33 per cent) and stage IV -n=2 (7.4 per cent). Mean T-helper cell (CD4) count was 543 (range 150-1170). In no case were neurological symptoms or signs elicited nor was CT brain scan indicated. Violent incidents in this HIV positive drug using cohort cannot be attributed to neurological manifestation of the disease. In a confrontational setting this group may feel they have less to lose by violent behaviour. Furthermore, violence may be a function of the risk taking behaviour which initially led to needle sharing and ultimately to the acquisition of HIV. The objectives of this study were to examine prospectively the profile of patients admitted to a medical psychiatric joint care unit, to study their treatment and follow-up and to examine the difficulties associated with the treatment of these patients on a general hospital psychiatric unit.",

A typical profile of the psychiatrically ill shoplifter is that of a young professional woman who is suffering from depression. Shoplifting in the elderly is rarely reported, particularly in elderly men and in those without a dementing illness. We describe a case of shoplifting unusually occurring in a 70 yr old man who exhibited classical features of depression, and low self esteem. Cognitive functioning was normal.

There has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of pregnant opiate addicts in Ireland. Patients who are both opiate dependent and pregnant have an increased risk of medical, psychiatric, obstetrical and neonatal problems. The purpose of this study was to examine a prospective cohort of pregnant opiate dependent females. 60 pregnant opiate dependent clients presented for treatment during the study period. The majority were single, self referred, and had not received previous treatment. Heroin was the main drug of abuse, with 15 per cent using the intravenous route. The mean age was 22.4. Ninety per cent were primigravid and the remaining 10 per cent were multiparous. The average length of gestation at presentation was 27 weeks, with the mean time for recognizing the pregnancy being 18 weeks. Most pregnancies were unplanned and the majority of women had not used contraception. The mean gestation at the initial antenatal visit was 28 weeks. Four per cent of this group were HIV positive and 12 per cent were HCV positive. The mean number of cigarettes smoked was 30 daily. The average dose of methadone used to maintain this group was 35 mg daily. Forty per cent of this group continued to use opiates during the pregnancy. Partners were also opiate dependent in 41 per cent of cases. This growing problem necessitates close liaison between obstetric and drug dependency services. General Practitioner (GP) referral letters vary enormously with regard to quantity and quality of information, and legibility. The purpose of this study was firstly to examine a consecutive series of GP referral letters to a community psychiatric clinic, and secondly to measure the impact of introducing a specialised referral form for GPs. Sixty referral letters were examined in total, 30 letters were selected prior to the introduction of the new referral form and 30 referrals using the new form, following its introduction. Data was coded and analyzed using SPSS. Chisquared statistics were used to assess the significance of change after the introduction of the new process. Results showed that the new referral form was associated with a significant increase in information regarding patients past psychiatric history (p=0.05), previous psychiatric treatment (p=0.001), family psychiatric history (p=0.02), as well as details regarding patients' regular alcohol intake (p=0.05). In the past laboratories have notified certain results obtained to the relevant agencies but this information was generally collected by hand, a process both tedious and time-consuming. With increasing workloads in laboratories this is less easy to achieve and has restricted the current voluntary laboratory-based communicable disease reports in Ireland (such as Virus Alert, lnfoscan, Datainform and LD. Bulletin) to publication no more than 4-5 times a yr.",

Extraction scripts were prepared identifying significant test results and scheduled to extract the appropriate data on a weekly basis. The results were compiled into tabular form and examined in-house for a period of 3 months. In September 1996 the distribution of this weekly datasheet was extended outside the VRL using fax, email and the World Wide Web. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Neisseria meningitidis carriage in a large secondary school and to examine potential risk factors associated with such carriage following 2 cases of meningococcal disease (one type B15 Pl.16) from a single school year (Year II) and 2 cases of meningococcal disease from the same local community (1 type B15 Pl.16). A throat swab was taken from 626 students who completed a questionnaire which enquired about personal and household details, lifestyle and social behaviour and health. Logistic regression was used to determine independently associated with carriage of Neisseria meningitidis. Neisseria meningitidis was cultured from throat swabs of 53 (8.5 per cent), 11 of whom were B15 Pl.16; all B15 Pl.16 carriers were aged over 14. Having more that 2 smokers in the household, being in the same year as the index cases and having received significant bad news in the preceding 3 months were significantly associated with carriage of any strain of Neisseria meningitidis. Two factors were significantly associated with carriage of type B 15 P1.16; being over 14 and being in Year II. Screening results are too late to influence decision making in the acute situation; however examination of disease spread, carrier status of school contacts in clusters and determinants of both may allow patterns to emerge which will assist the management of future similar situations. The 3 databases used for national surveillance of meningococcal disease (statutory notifications, laboratory isolates and Reference Laboratory (RL) isolates) were compared for the years 1991-1995 to estimate the completeness of reporting of laboratory-confirmed meningococcal disease and to estimate trends in laboratory-confirmed notifications versus all notifications of meningococcal disease. The laboratory and RL lists were merged to circumvent dependence of the 2 lists; two-sample capture-recapture methods were then applied to the combined list and the laboratory-confirmed notifications to estimate the number of cases corrected for ascertainment. Over the 5 yr period laboratory-confirmed notifications (n=297) comprised 60.2 per cent of RL isolates (n=493) and 77.7 per cent of laboratory reports (n=382). Fifty per cent of all reported cases of meningococcal disease could be identified in the RL database. Ascertainment rates ranged from 45.3 per cent to 72.4 per cent. The overall case ascertainment rate was calculated as 61.2 per cent, representing a discrepancy of 477 cases. This study demonstrates major discrepancies in the documentation of meningococcal disease by each of the 3 sources of data and an apparent under-reporting of laboratory-confirmed meningococcal disease. Electronic transfer of all laboratory data, after single entry onto laboratory computer, to CDSC would automatically improve reporting by laboratories, without additional data punching workload. Accurate and complete reporting is imperative before meaningful interpretation of national statistics can be undertaken.

Just over half deemed attendance to be urgent/important; associated factors were having heard of prostate cancer, living with a female partner and having a relative with cancer; possession of a GMS card was negatively associated. There is a marked social class gradient in knowledge and willingness to seek medical advice.

Breastfeeding is regarded as being superior to bottlefeeding. Policy documents have been developed to increase the rate of breastfeeding. This study looks at breastfeeding rates in a region and why the uptake is low. Of the 308 women who had a live singleton birth in a 4 week period, data, collected by the Public Health Nurses, were available for 287 (93.2 per cent). The following proportions breastfed: at birth -34.8 per cent, hospital discharge -29.6 per cent, 6 weeks -20.2 per cent, 16 weeks -10.1 per cent. Most of the differences in demographics between breastfeeders and bottlefeeders are explained by social class. Women who breast fed were more likely to have been spoken to about the benefits during pregnancy than were bottlefeeders. Of those who bottlefed, 27 per cent did not want to breastfeed and 18 per cent felt it was too time consuming. Further, 24 per cent were unable to give any benefits for breastfeeding and 9 per cent said there were no benefits. Of those who breastfed, 54 per cent felt that people wanted them out of sight, 22 per cent stopped because of poor supply, 19 per cent because they were tired and 18 per cent because the baby was unhappy. Existing policies to increase breastfeeding rates have either failed or not been implemented. Breastfeeding and the promotion of same needs to become a more attractive issue for mothers.

Within the Eastern Health Board approximately 455,000 drug items are dispensed each month to 144,000 patients (39 per cent of registered GMS patients).

Statins, (particularly pravastatin) were the most widely used, commonly at 10 mg not the 40 mg shown to reduce deaths in clinical trials. Clofibrate is still in use, particularly in the elderly. Recent guidelines (Lancet, 1996, 348: 1251) recommending a statin when the risk of CHD exceeds 3 per cent per year, would apply to 0.4 per cent of females, 5.7 per cent of males, costing s per life year saved. As less than 0.5 per cent are now treated, at sub-optimal dosage and more females than males, it is important that the rise in LLD is directed in the most cost efficient manner.

There was no evidence of meningism, but one brief episode of confusion was noted. In view of the 2 recent spinal anaesthetics and the absence of any other localising signs of infection, we considered the possibility of spinal infection, which, although rare, needed to be ruled out.

The 17 patients (8M, 9F) had the following results expressed as median (range) -24 yrs (1640), latency to sleep; stage one -4.5 mins (2.5 -7.5), stage two -5 mins (3.5 -8.5) stage three -5.5 mins (4 -12), stage four -6 mins (4.5 -15.5).

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is associated with higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Standard ECG-criteria for detection of LVH have poor sensitivity. We compared a 64electrode anterior body surface mapping (BSM) system with the 12-lead ECG for detection of LVH. Thirty-nine patients undergoing routine ECHO for assessment of hypertension or valvular heart disease were recruited. Those with asymmetric septal hypertrophy, LBBB and previous myocardial infarction were excluded. Patients were grouped into those with or without LVH based on M-Mode criteria (Penn-convention) with threshold for LV-mass indexed to body surface-area (men 134g/m 2 and women l l0g/m2). From a 12-lead ECG, voltage criteria for LVH were calculated: Cornell (rAVL+sV3), Sokolow-Lyon (sVl+rV s or rV6), Rodstein (rI+slII), ~QRS voltages and 12-lead product (:QRS voltages x QRS duration). BSMs were recorded from which QRS potentials and isointegral features were obtained. According to ECHO, 24/39 patients had LVH. Cornell ECG criteria correctly determined presence of LVH in 10/24 patients (42 per cent sensitivity, 80 per cent specificity). Inclusion of the other ECG criteria did not improve discrimination. Using multiple logistic regression analysis of BSM, 2 variables were derived (QRS maxima from 2 electrodes high on the left anterior chest, outside standard precordial lead positions) Which correctly determined presence of LVH in 20/ 24 patients (83 per cent sensitivity, 67 per cent specificity). This study demonstrates the superior sensitivity of BSM over the 12lead ECG for detection of LVH. The \"door to needle time\" delay of thrombolysis was assessed before and after the introduction of a decision support computer program (DSCP) for the management of suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The DSCP estimates the chance of AMI and death from AMI from immediately available bedside parameters.

Detection of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with left bundle branch block (LBBB) remains a diagnostic challenge. We thus evaluated the diagnostic potential of body-surface mapping (BSM) which consists of a screen-printed 64-electrode anterior harness and 16-electrode posterior harness applied to the chest wall. Maps are displayed in isointegral or isopotential formats, we recruited 24 patients with chest pain and LBBB, and 23 controls with LBBB but without chest pain. A 12-lead ECG and 80-lead BSM were obtained in all subjects, and cardiac enzymes in those with chest pain. QRS and ST-T isointegral maps and an ST60 isopotential map (60ms after the J point), were derived from each BSM. Seven of the 24 patients had AMI as defined by maximum CK>2x upper normal limit. Only 2/7 fulfilled Sgarbossa's ECG criteria for AMI with LBBB (NEJM. 1996; 334(8): 481-487). BSM analysis showed that in both controls and patients without AMI, loci of maxima and minima typically reversed positions when comparing the QRS isointegral map with the ST-T isointegral and/or ST60 isopotential maps i.e. a vector shift of 180~176",

The data collected was summarised on a computer database. The Saturday echo session was financed by the hospital over a 2 week period, and prospective data collection was continued during this time. Data regarding inpatient waiting times and echoes performed before and during this intervention were compared to determine utility of this approach in reducing inpatient procedure waiting times. Data is presented below. The time-efficiency of the service was high, with inpatient delays due to heavy workload. The introduction of a Saturday session appreciably reduced waiting times for echocardiography. This was evident over a 2 week trial period, so results are almost certainly an underestimation. This has significant financial implications, and implications for patient welfare. As a minimally invasive tool to assess cardiac anatomy and function the use of intra-operative trans-oesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in cardiac surgery is rapidly expanding. Reported complications are rare. A 75 yr old male presented with a diagnosis of post-infarction ventricular septal defect (no history of respiratory or gastrointestinal disease). At operation the Toronto technique was used to close the defect and the result assessed with TEE. Despite good haemodynamics, the postoperative course was complicated by sepsis and pneumonia, with worsening chest radiography, despite aggressive antibiotic therapy. The patient eventually succumbed. Post-mortem examination of the oesophagus revealed an area of ulceration with a fistula leading to the left main bronchus. Instrumentation of the oesophagus is the commonest cause of oesophageal injury ~. Contact pressures at the tip of the TEE probe of up to Vol. 166, 1997 Supplement No. 5 Irish Journal of Medical Science 60 mmHg can be produced 2. Although complications are rare with intra-operative TEE 3, they may be seen more often as the technique becomes more routine. We advise 1) screening patients for a history of oesophageal disease and 2) a high index of suspicion for oesophageal injury in cases of sepsis where oesophageal instrumentation has taken place. Postmenopausal women have a significantly increased incidence of atherosclerotic heart disease. Free radical mediated oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is thought to be the earliest step of atherosclerosis and cigarette smokers have low natural antioxidant levels possibly due to abundant free radicals contained in smoke. We studied natural antioxidant status and the oxidation of LDL in healthy postmenopausal non-smokers (n=12) and smokers (n=8) who were free of medication and antioxidant supplementation. Fasting blood samples were taken from each subject for measurements of plasma ascorbate, red cell a-tocopherol and reduced glutathione (GSH) and LDL o~tocopherol. LDL was isolated by using ultracentrifugation and the ex vivo oxidation was induced by adding copper sulphate and determined as lag phase of the production of conjugated dienes. Although it did not reach statistical significance, LDL ot-tocopherol level appeared higher in postmenopausal nonsmokers (2.35+-0.21 nmol/mg LDL, mean+SD) but lower in smokers (2.15+0.19) in comparison to 11 pre-menopausal nonsmokers (2.26+0.20). Plasma ascorbate (35.4+14.3 vs 49.6+16.5 I.tmol/1, postmenopausal smokers and non-smokers, respectively, p<0.05) and red cell GSH (52.7+21.5 vs 65.4+26.3 mg/dl, p<0.05) were significantly lower in smokers. Significantly shortened lag phase, indicating a higher rate of oxidation, was found in smokers (48.6+_9 vs 54.6+_12 min., p<0.05). These data indicate that there may be an increased risk of oxidatively mediated atherosclerosis in postmenopausal smokers. It may be possible to modify this through antioxidant supplements.",

Our objective was to determine whether hypertensive patients experience poorer sleep quality during 24-hour ABPM than normotensives, due to discomfort secondary to higher cuff inflation pressures. In a case-control; study, 33 hypertensives who had undergone simultaneous ABPM and activity monitoring with a piezoelectric wrist accelerometer were age-matched to 66 normotensive controls. The accelerometer integrated activity scores ranging from 0 to 253 units at 10 second intervals; these data were used to determine sleeptime, waketime and sleep quality. Average daytime BP (162+8/97+10 in hypertensives; 121 +7180+7 in normotensives) and night-time BP (143+ 11/85+9 and 103+9/65+7 respectively), differed significantly (P<0.001). Compared to normotensives, hypertensives exhibited higher mean nocturnal activity scores (2.8+1.9 vs. 1.8_+0.9, P=0.0051), and more nocturnal scores > 1 unit (7.7+4.9 per cent vs. 5.4+2.8 per cent, P=0.014). Hypertensives also exhibited more episodes of nocturnal disturbance (defined as at least 4 consecutive readings > 10 units; 5.6+3.6 vs. 3.7+2.9, P=0.013), and showed less nocturnal \"dip\" in blood pressure compared to normotensives (11.6+4.8 per cent/12.1+4.7 per cent vs. 15.0+6.6 per cent/17.9+7.0 per cent, P<0.005). There was no difference in sleep duration or daytime activity scores between groups. These findings suggest that higher cuff inflation pressures experienced by hypertensive patients are associated with increased nocturnal disturbance and may minimize the fall in blood pressure at night.

Prospective analysis of all patients who underwent instrumental delivery between June '96 -Jan '97. (n=560). All patients who sustained a third degree tear (n=24), were assessed by symptom questionnaire. Parity was a significant factor with 20 per cent of primigravid versus 3 per cent of multigravid patients requiring instrumental delivery, (P<0.001).

The increase in the tHb together with no significant change in rHb are consistent with the notion that surfactant administration is associated with an increase in cerebral arterial blood flow rather than venous stasis. Such an increase may be damaging in infants < 1.5 kg with immature cerebral vascular autoregulation and may predispose to intraventricular haemorrhage. It is recognised that in vivo 'priming' of neutrophils may contribute to their destructive potential in certain disease states including cystic fibrosis (CF). Several studies indicate that, during infection, inflammatory mediators can promote the production of more 'potent' neutrophils (containing higher quantities of elastase) during maturation in the bone marrow. The objective of this study was to assess the potency of circulating CF neutrophils with respect to levels of neutrophil elastase (NE), neutrophil collagenase (NC) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), n=19. CF patients with stable disease and n=19 age and sex matched non-CF controls were recruited to the study. Blood neutrophils were isolated and resuspended at a concentration of 3 X 106 PMN/ml. Results (mean +SEM) are shown in the following Results suggest that pulmonary ECs constitutively express more ICAM-1 than umbilical vein ECs. This would support the argument that endothelial cells from different sources differ in relation to their expression of ICAM-1. To date in vitro studies of transendothelial neutrophil (PMN) migration have used the umbilical vein as a source of human endothelial cells (HUVEC). Evidence of variations in endothelial cell characteristics depending on vascular origin ~ suggests that endothelial cells of pulmonary origin would be more representative than HUVEC in in vitro studies of pulmonary inflammation. The aim of this study was to establish a model of PMN migration across monolayers of pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC). HPAEC were grown to form a confluent m0nolayer on microporous membrane filter inserts coated with human type IV collagen. Migration of PMNs (isolated from human venous blood) across the monolayer in response to n-formylmethionylleucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) was assessed following a 3 h incubation at 37~ Results (Table) indicated that, while ~40 per cent of PMN in control assays adhered to HPAEC monolayers, migration through the monolayer was minimal. On stimulation with flMLP, migration of up to 74 per cent of added PMN was observed at the optimal fMLP concentration of 10-SM. The model described here provides an improved system for in vitro studies of pulmonary inflammation. 3 .5 million), with special reference to the South Western Region of this country (pop. 536,000) and 2. to assess any relationship between the prevalence/incidence of Farmers Lung with climatic factors (obtained from the National Meteorological Office) in South West Ireland between 1983 and 1994. Hospital discharges with a primary diagnosis of Farmers Lung, or a secondary diagnosis were used to assess incidence and prevalence respectively. Percent positive serological results per annum for Farmers Lung antibodies (ie Thermoactinamycetes Vulgaris and Micropolyspora Faeni) in the South West were also used as markers of prevalence. This was called the FL index. Farmers Lung incidence remained constant (0.74 cases per 100,000 pop. in 1983, 0.55 cases in 1994, with a peak number of cases 3.73 in 1986)throughout the 11 years studied, in the South West region. There was a significantly similar relationship between the incidence (p<0.0002) and prevalence (p<0.005) of Farmers Lung in:the South West region when compared with the whole of Ireland. The other epidemiological marker used (FL index) also remained constant at 21 per cent positive in 1983 to 22 per cent positive in 1994. A significant relationship was found between total rainfall (in millimetres) each summer (June-August inclusive) and Farmers Lung incidence and prevalence over the following year (p<0.005). No significant relationship, however, was found between hrs of sunshine during that same period and these indices. The persistence of Farmers Lung in Ireland at a constant level therefore suggests that the working environment and dairy farm practices have remained unchanged. Release of matrixmetalloproteinases (MMPs) by alveolar macrophages (AMs) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of emphysema. To date, however, the identity of these MMPs and whether or not their expression is directly up-regulated in emphysema has not been examined. The aim of this study was to assess MMP gene expression in AMs from emphysema patients. AMs isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens of 10 male emphysema patients (4 smokers; 6 exsmokers) and 10 matched control subjects were analysed for interstitial collagenase, gelatinase A, gelatinase B and macrophage metalloelastase (MME) gene expression using semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Interstitial collagenase was expressed by AMs from all 10 emphysema patients, but only 2 controls (p<0.0005). Similarly, gelatinase B mRNA levels were elevated in AMs from the emphysema group compared to the controls (p<0.0005). In the case of gelatinase A and MME, however, no significant difference in expression was noted between the patient and control groups. These.results suggest that increased synthesis of interstitial collagenase and gelatinase B, but not gelatinase A or MME, by AMs may contribute to the alveolar matrix degradation which characterises emphysema. This work was funded by the Health Research Board. Neutrophil migration involves the sequential rolling of neutrophils (using L-selectin) and firm adhesion to the endothelium (mediated by Mac-l). Neutrophil stimulation triggers shedding of L-selectin and upregulation of the Mac-1 complex (CD18/CDllb). Recent studies suggest circulating neutrophils in patients with acute lung disease may be hyperresponsive to stimuli. The aim of this study was to investigate whether circulating neutrophils from acutely infected cystic fibrosis (CF) patients were similarly hyperresponsive when stimulated with neutrophil agoni sts. Blood samples (n= 13) from 11 acutely infected CF patients (6F, 5M), 16 stable CF patients (8F, 8M) and 15 matched controls (8M, 7F) were analysed for surface expression of L-selectin and Mac-1. While no significant difference in the basal levels of adhesion molecules was observed, upon stimulation with interleukin-8 (I1-8) and n-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMLP), acute CF patients shed significantly less L-selectin than both stable CF patients (p<0.05) and controls (p<0.01). Significantly less L-selectin was also shed by neutrophils from stable CF patients compared to controls (p<0.05). This difference in L-selectin shedding indicates that circulating neutrophils in CF patients have a \"dampened\" response to stimulation with respect to Lselectin, and are less likely to shed this adhesion molecule from their surface upon stimulation, especially during acute infection. The efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation in end stage respiratory disease has been recently demonstrated in a series of controlled trials. However, pulmonary rehabilitation has not become established in the management of COPD in Ireland. We recently established and evaluated the initial benefits of a pulmonary rehabilitation programme.",

We anticipate further studies relating to this. Serotonin receptor and transporter genes are potential candidate genes for mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Drugs, such as Clozapine, which block 5HT2^ receptors are effective in the treatment of schizophrenia. Recently, genetic association studies have demonstrated a higher frequency in schizophrenics of allele 2 of a HpalI polymorphism within the 5HT2A gene. This has also been demonstrated in a European multi-center study consisting of 571 cases and 631 controls. However, there are conflicting findings from American and British samples. In the present study we examine 247 familial schizophrenic cases and 249 general population controls. In contrast to the published findings, a non-significant decrease in the frequency of the genotype 2-2 was observed in the patient population (35.2 per cent v controls 38.9 per cent) which was accompanied by a similar increase in the genotype 1-2 (patients 51 per cent v controls 45.5 per cent). Allele frequencies similarly do not differ between patient and control populations. In conclusion, the Hpa II polymorphism at the 5HT2A receptor is not associated with schizophrenia in the Irish population. It is possible that the reported association were false. In particular the size of the studied Japanese population was small (n=62) and the significance was weak. In addition the European multi-center samples were ethnically heterogeneous. The classical neuropathological features of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are present in all Down's Syndrome (DS) over the age of 35. Possession of an extra copy of chromosome 21 leading to over expression of the amyloid precursor protein is believed to be responsible. Possession of the ApoE e4 allele confers increased risk of AD whereas the ApoE e2 allele is protective. In normal centenarians the frequency of the ApoE e4 allele is reduced, suggesting an effect of ApoE on longevity. We previously reported a similar finding in an elderly DS population. (e4 frequency in DS and controls was 11.5 per cent -v19.2 per cent, Chi square 8.33, p = 0.004). In this study we compare the frequency of ApoE alleles in a group of 31 DS individuals with dementia to 60 age matched DS individuals without dementia. ApoE e2 frequencies were significantly lower in the demented group (0 per cent -v-8.3 per cent, Fisher exact 1-tailed P = 007) and ApoE e4 frequencies were higher (17.7 per cent -v-10.8 per cent) although this did not reach statistical significance. In summary, ApoE e2 is protective against the development of dementia in Down's Syndrome.

Changes in intensity of surface marker expression do not affect phenotypic analysis but may have subtle implications for functional studies. Lymphocytic populations of the female reproductive tract are of particular interest as specific tolerance of the semiallogenic fetus is required for successful pregnancy. The initial aim of this study is to investigate the mononuclear subpopulation in normal non-pregnant endometrium. Endometrial tissue was obtained by sharp curettage from 4 women with regular menstrual cycles, and single cell suspensions suitable for flow cytometry were prepared using chelating and reducing agents. Cell suspensions were then labelled with monoclonal antibodies specific for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56+16. HLA-DR and TCR~,fi Cell yields ranged from 0.8-3.60 x 106 cells/ml, (mean 2.11 x 106 cells/ml). In a lymphocyte gate drawn using FSC/SSC, several populations were identified and expressed as a percentage of the gate: We previously reported a compliance rate of 61 per cent (89 per cent in homosexual males and 24 per cent in IVDU) in HIV positive patients attending St. James's Hospital, Dublin. Poor patient understanding of the prescribed therapy was found to significantly affect compliance. We prospectively studied the effect of introducing aids to compliance in these patients from 1 st January to 30th June 1996. All patients attending the service were counselled by the doctor and pharmacist as to the indication for and potential side effects of the medication. This was reiterated at every subsequent visit. Patients were given medication charts, patient information leaflets and dosettes. To determine the compliance rate, we documented medication prescribed and dispensed to each patient. Patients were interviewed to determine adherence to, ability to recognize and understand the prescribed medication. We report an overall compliance rate of 72 per cent (91 per cent in homosexual males and 35 per cent in IVDU). We suggest that spending time counselling patients and introducing aids to compliance may significantly increase compliance rates particularly in certain patient groups. Hepatitis C virus is now classified into 6 major genotypes, with further subtypes within these.

No HGV was detected in patients with clinical symptoms of hepatitis and this may be attributable to either poor specimen quality, clearance of the virus or that morbidity was due to some other factor. Human tuberculosis remains a leading infectious disease worldwide resulting in 3 million deaths annually. Because of the limitations of the current laboratory based diagnostic methodologies there is a requirement for a rapid assay for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. We describe a PCR based assay (B/ RI C-TRAK TM MTB) that targets the amplification of the 16S/ 23S rRNA intergenic spacer from members of the M. tuberculosis complex in clinical samples. The assay incorporates an internal standard control to monitor the level of PCR inhibition in each specimen. We report on a 2 centre comparative evaluation of B/RI C-TRAK TM MTB assay and the AMPLICOR TM MTB (Roche) assay system. A total of 142 samples were tested, which included a range of clinical specimens (e.g. sputum, BAL, CSF). These results, together with those results obtained by culture and acid fast staining of the specimens will be presented. While the results obtained with the 2 PCR assay systems were comparable, culture remains the most sensitive method for detecting M. tuberculosis in clinical specimens. PCR may represent a more rapid detection method in certain clinical situations and optimisation of sample preparation and amplicon detection will improve the assay sensitivity. Combination anti-retroviral therapy has been shown to be superior to monotherapy in treatment of HIV. The Protease lnhibitors (PIs) are a new class of anti-retroviral agents which act by inhibiting the post translational processing of gag and gag pol polyprotein precursors. This results in the production of non infectious virions. All PIs to date (i.e. Ritonavir, Saquinavir and Indinavir) are both metabolised by, and potent inhibitors of Cytochrome p450 3A4. Therefore therapy with multiple PIs may elevate drug levels and cause toxicity. However PI combinations would be particularly beneficial in those patients with advanced HIV disease who are already heavily anti-retroviral experienced. We performed pharmacokinetic studies on 7 patients; initially on triple therapy including Saquinavir, then on quadruple therapy including Saquinavir and Ritonavir. We found a 30 fold variation in Saquinavir levels in patients on triple therapy. There was also a 20 fold increase in Saquinavir levels in the presence of Ritonavir. Based on this we created a modified dosing regimen of Saquinavir 200 mg od and ritonavir 600 mg bd. We are currently following a cohort of patients on this regimen. All patients have had significant improvement in disease markers without significant toxicity.

In this study the additional use of PFGE established a link between strains which may have been missed if phage typing alone had been employed. Categorisation is based on comparison of the zone of inhibition of growth of the test strain and the zone of inhibition of growth of a control strain around an antibiotic disk. We have conducted a pilot study of the effect of variation in the inoculum used in testing on the size of the zone of inhibition and on the categorisation as S, I or R. Bacterial strains were clinical and type strains of E.coli. Testing was performed in triplicate on Diagnostic Sensitivity Test agar. Antibiotic disks were ampicillin (10ug), co-amoxyclav (30ug), cephradine (30ug), cefotaxime (30ug), ciprofloxacin (5ug) and gentamicin (10ug). The radius of zone diameter was measured to the nearest mm. For all 6 antimicrobials the mean radius of the zone of inhibition of the Vol. 166, 1997 Supplement No. 5 control strain 10418 increased by 2-3 mm as the inoculum density decreased. A similar trend was noted in the test strains. For some strains categorisation varied between S and I with variation in inoculum density. Clostridium difficile is recognised as a causative pathogen of antibiotic associated diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis in humans. Little is known about adherence of this organism to intestinal epithelial cells, the initial step in pathogenesis. In this study we examined adherence of C. diffcile to cells of mouse duodenum, small intestine and colon. Adherence to human colonocytes was also studied. Intestinal epithelial cells were isolated using EDTA, incubated with C. difficile, washed and centrifuged onto slides using a Shandon cytospin. Slides were fixed and stained by Gram's stain and examined microscopically for adherence of bacteria to epithelial cells. Cells from 3 mice and 2 humans were studied. Results were expressed as the number of adhering bacteria/cell +SD C. diffcile bound to mouse intestinal epithelial cells with maximum adherence to colonocytes. The organism also adheres consistently to human colonocytes (table I) . Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a significant pathogen in Irish hospitals since the 1970's.

E.coli strains which produce a cytotoxin, active against cultured Vero cells (Verocytotxoic E.coli) are important human pathogens. Most such strains express a specific lipopolysaccharide O antige n, O 157. These strains are associated with gastroenteritis, haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic uraemic syndrome. The most commonly recognised source of infection is meat, in particular minced beef products. It has recently been suggested that water supplies may also be a source of infection. Water samples from group water schemes and private water supplies in Counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon were examined for the presence of Escherichia coli O157. Three local water sources (Galway public water supply, Galway canal, and the Barna coastal amenity area) were also monitored over a 6 week period. A variety of culture methods for selective culture and detection of sorbitol non-fermenting E.coli strains were used. Sorbitol non-fermenting strains were confirmed as E.coli by API 20E and the O157 antigen detected by latex agglutination. E coli O157 was detected on one occasion in samples from 3 separate public water supplies in rural areas. These findings suggest that domestic water supplies may be a source of infection with E.coli O157 in rural areas. Uroepithelium was cultured from the normal ureters or bladders of 250 normal individuals and 25 cancer bearing individuals to assess individual variation in response to a carcinogen. The cultures were exposed to radiation and left to grow for 14 days, then fixed and stained for growth control. proteins. Extent of growth and of necrosis or apoptosis was also recorded. Three different response sub-types were identified. For each type the low radiation dose response was similar and acute but the groups varied considerably in their ability to induce a survival response to doses above 0.5Gy. Type I was resistant to radiation, induced anti-apoptosis proteins and showed low levels of necrosis. This type accounted for more than 60 per cent of the normal patient, all the smokers and all the tumour bearing individuals. Types 2 and 3 had a sensitive response with high induction of apoptosis and high levels of necrosis at all radiation doses, It is likely that these different response are genetically determined but the sectoring of smokers to type I suggests that environmental factors may be involved in determining response possibly through deregulation of apoptosis control pathways. Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the causative agents of 46 the ubiquitous benign tumours known commonly as warts. Cervical \"high-risk\" types, e.g, HPV16/18 have long been associated with malignant conversion. The association is founded upon the frequent detection of HPV DNA in cancerous lesions, and the ability of oncogenes from \"high-risk\" types to transform cells in culture. Although HPV are the most common virus to infect human skin, they have largely been overlooked as aetiological agents of skin cancer Recent evidence suggests that, in the case of skin cancers, exceptional circumstances such as a genetic predisposition or allograft transplantation (particularly renal or cardiac), may allow viral infection to result in malignancy. The aim of this study is to elucidate the various viral types present in a variety of skin lesions and to correlate viral type with lesion type. Total DNA was extracted from warts and squamous cell carcinomas. Degenerate Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used to amplify a 45CI base pair region of the viraI L1 gene, which was subsequently cloned and sequenced. A homology search of a HPV database revealed that all of the warts were positive for HPV(HPV2/10/and 57 predominantly and one case of HPV17). Of the tumours analysed, all but one demonstrated HPV specific bands after PCR, and the viral types found all belonged to a group generally associated with an inherited genetic disorder (epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV)) and previously shown to be involved in malignant conversion. One novel viral type was discovered which was also related to EV-associated HPV. Alterations in thyroid volume and thyroid peroxidase autoantibody (TPO.Ab) positivity have been demonstrated in breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate if these observations contributed to outcome in breast cancer. Thyroid volume was measured by ultrasound and TPO.Ab by a highly sensitive radioimmunoassay using 0.3 U/ml MRC Standard 65/93 as the upper limit of the reference range. TPO.Ab positivity had a significant protective effect in 145 breast cancer patients available for follow up (median 3.45 years), both in terms of disease-free (56 per cent compared to 73 per cent at 5 yr, relative risk RR=I.91, p=0.032) and overall (80 per cent compared to 91 per cent at 5 yr, RR=3.42, p=0.009) survival. This enhanced survival was not additive to that previously recorded when thyroid volumes were < 9.4ml or >18.8ml.",

Higher resolution, and multiplane images should improve the assessment of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction compared to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). For comparison of both modalities detailed assessment of the LVOT and mitral valve were performed. A total of 35 patients were studied (21 males, mean age was 55+17 yrs), of which 10 (29 per cent) had LVOT obstruction. Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve was clearly seen in all these patients with MTOE in at least 2 views, but in only 5 patients with TI'E. Eccentricity of MR jet was assessed in 2 patients with TTE (posterior) and in all 10 patients with TOE (9 posterior, 1 posterior and central). Coaptation site of mitral valve leaflets was seen in all I 0 patients with TOE, but in only 4 with TI'E.

MR images (1.5T;GE) were obtained using a shoulder coil placed on the abdomen with a heavily T2W FSE (TR/TE: 11,000/272, ETL: 32) sequence, matrix size 256x128, 1 NEX, FOV 20x20 and contiguous 3mm slices. Imaging acquisition took 44s, accomplished in 2 breath holds or by quiet breathing in non breath holders. Images were reformatted and prospectively correlated with ERC/DC with was performed within 24 h.Diagnostic images were obtained in all patients. ERC/DC showed CBD stones in 30 patients, stricture/tumour in 26, and was normal in 44. MRC showed stone disease in 29 patients, stricture/tumour in 27 and was normal in 44. MRC had 2 false negatives and 1 false positive for stone disease.

One protein, t~-I ,4-glucosidase (E.C.3.2.1.20) originates in the epididymis and its measurement may help in the investigation of epididymal dysfunction.Our purpose was to determine if ~-glucosidase could be used to: (a) diagnose the etiology of azoospermia and (b) test for epididymal dysfunction in men in infertile relationships tx-glucosidase was measured (EPISCREEN, MICROM U.K.) in sperm free seminal plasma and recorded as mU/ml.In semen post vasectomy, enzyme levels were very low (12-14 mU/ml). Azoospermic semen ranged from 12-35 mU/ml and 59 per cent of samples had similar levels to the vasectomised group. These patients were diagnosed with blocked ducts, undescended testes and past radiation therapy. The remaining 41 per cent (8 patients) had higher levels, 5 of whom had exposure to chemotherapy. In samples from men in infertile relationships, enzyme activities ranged from 13-70 mU/ml. Ten per cent of specimens had enzyme activities in the vasectomised range.We found no relationship between sperm counts and ct-glucosidase activity.In conclusion, low ct-glucosidase indicates epididymal pathology with possible fertility implications. Low levels in association with azoospermia indicates blocked ducts or permanent epididymal damage. In addition, we propose a lower discriminatory level for ~-glucosidase for the detection of epididymal dysfunction than that indicated by the manufacturer of the reagents. The aim of this study was to compare disease activity in 2 patient groups with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) liver disease. The study population included 15 patients infected with HCV via contaminated anti-D immunoglobulin received in 1977 and 15 patients believed to have acquired HCV infection via blood transfusion. Patients were age matched.Tru-cut biopsy of liver was obtained from each patient using a Menghini needle. Liver tissue was formalin fixed, stained with H&E, Pcrls, PAS_+ diastase, Massons trichrome and reticulin. Liver disease activity was assessed histologically using the International scoring system I which separately assesses and scores necroinflammatory disease activity (grade) and architecture (stage) i.e. semi-quantitative. Accordingly the 2 patient groups were compared for the following parameters: piecemeal necrosis, confluent necrosis, spotty necrosis/ apoptosis, portal inflammation and architecture. Statistical analysis using the non-parametric paired t-test showed a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for piecemeal necrosis (p=0.006) and stage (p=0.001). Although the study population is small, our findings indicate that there is a significant difference in necroinflammatory disease activity and architectural changes between the 2 groups, with greater histological abnormality seen in blood transfusion recipients. We suggest this may be due to differences in viral load at the time of infection, or infection With different viral subtypes in the 2 patient populations.",
