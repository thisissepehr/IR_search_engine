This study adopts a public health ecology approach to systematically understand the relationship between urbanisation, urban environmental change and human health in China. Method Remote sensing image analysis, based on night light data at five different time periods in recent decades, was used to determine changes to the overall urban area. Through a review of the evidence on the relationships between environmental health, urbanisation and health, we advance a pathway framework for explaining urban human health ecology. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to measure the correlation between disease prevalence and urbanisation level, adding a further dimension to a systemic understanding of urban health. Results and conclusions Urban areas have been increasing spatially, but unevenly, in recent decades, with medium and small cities also expanding rapidly in the past decade. Urbanisation and urban expansion result in changes to land use/coverage change, the urban environment and the residents' lifestyle, which result in human health problems. Regions with the highest urbanisation level were more inclined to have a high prevalence of chronic disease in recent decades. An ecological public health approach provides insights into the multiple types of data which need to be routinely collected if human disease is not to become a barrier to social and economic development.",

The current shift in China's population from rural to urban areas is predicted to continue, with nearly 200 million moving over the next decade (Zhu and Jones 2010) . Empirical studies of China show a strong association between economic growth and urban spatial expansion (Lichtenberg and Ding 2009) . Recognising urbanisation's central role in further economic growth and social development, China will continue to give high priority to urbanisation in the coming decades (Chen 2007) .",

China has experienced an epidemiological transition shifting from infectious to chronic diseases in a much shorter time frame than many other countries ). However, the term epidemiological transition is only limited to the cause of death rather than disease burden, which was formulated by Abdel Omran in the 1970s (Abdel 1977) . Typically, chronic diseases have been considered a public health problem only in developed countries and among the elderly (Yach et al. 2004 ). However, research suggests that chronic diseases affect a much higher proportion of people during their prime working years in China as compared with developed countries (He et al. 2005 ). China's epidemiologic transition can be captured through changes in the causes of death in the adult population. For men and women aged 40 years and older, the leading causes have changed quite dramatically since the mid-1950s, when vital statistics for 13 Chinese cities showed the top 3 causes to be diseases of the respiratory system, acute infectious diseases and TB. By 1999-2000, vascular disease and cancer had become the leading causes of death, with the major contributions coming from hypertension, smoking, physical inactivity and underweight. Rates of smoking and physical inactivity were higher among urban residents than rural residents. Underweight was less of an issue in urban areas (He et al. 2005) . These findings indicate the rise in 'new' chronic diseases and the important role the place of residence plays in health outcomes and health transitions. Particularly, urban areas in some developing countries are moving through a nutritional transition towards Western-style diets, dominated by more processed and higher-fat-content foods (Popkin 2003; Popkin and Du 2003) .",

What is needed is an ecological public health approach (Rayner 2009 ) which considers the interactions between the process of urbanisation including its spatial-temporal characteristics, environmental change and human health. Such an approach adopts ecological thinking applying the biological sciences, with attention to natural processes, history and timescales, as well as the broad sweep of sciences devoted to human and social development. It attempts to sidestep the distinction between natural and human ecology and to consider their interdependence.",

Figure 1 shows that the urban area has been increasing and indicates that this growth has been uneven in space. Most of the urban region is distributed in the eastern part of China, especially near the coastal zone. As the heavily populated regions have more intensive economic activities, the proportion of land claimed by human settlements and economic infrastructures in East China has been well above the country average (Chen 2007) . Urban areas have expanded mainly around big cities; however, in the recent decade, medium and small cities have also expanded in space. Accelerated urbanisation with spatial expansion is important for human health for several reasons. China's rapid urbanisation, characterized by large-scale rural-urban migration and radial expansion of urban built-up areas, produces urban villages where people live in houses with high-density, narrow building distance, and poor ventilation and lighting (Liu et al. 2010) . These conditions bring the risk of respiratory disease and injury, as well as facilitating the rapid spread of viruses (WHO-UN Habitat 2010). Furthermore, urban-industrial spread is a major category of human-induced environmental change (McMichael 2009). Rapid urban expansion induces extensive change of land use and coverage. Wetland and arable land reduction are becoming major problems for China (Li et al. 2009 ). Loss of cultivated land places significant pressure on agricultural production, with some believing that accelerated urbanisation and industrialization will decrease cultivated areas to the point where China can no longer feed its people in the next decades. In addition, urbanisation increases the risk of soil pollution through waste disposal and acid deposition derived from urban air pollution (Chen 2007) , further compromising food yields and food quality.",

Accelerated urbanisation along with explosive economic growth has further worsened the shortage of agricultural land over the last two decades (Chen 2007) , with possible consequences for food security and nutritional deficiencies threatening the overall health status of the population.

Before 2000, mortality caused by infections was obviously higher in rural than in urban regions. However, the gap has been decreasing, with the difference between the regions being not significant in 2005 and 2009. This trend indicates that with the economic development during the process of urbanisation, some of the causes of sickness were removed, and this was also true in rural regions. Moreover, after the 2003 SARS epidemic, the Chinese government improved its disease surveillance system. The Ministry of Health built the world's largest Internet-based disease reporting system, called the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention.",

During the recent decades, the urban area in China has increased unevenly in space (Deng and Huang 2004; Sun 2010) . Urbanisation and urban expansion result in urban environment change and residents' lifestyle change, which have major consequences for urban human health. Urbanisation also leads to significant alterations of the physical environment far beyond city limits, resulting in habitat loss, climatic changes, and accumulation and spread of wastes in the atmosphere, hydrosphere and pedosphere (Chen 2007; McMichael 2009 ). Emergently, cooperation among land use, urban planning, environmental protection and health department in China should be made to give a complete solution for a sustainable urbanisation. One issue that should be paid attention to is rural-urban migration because in the past decades, the major source of China's urban growth is rural-urban migration (Zhang and Song 2003) . Living condition is the main concern which has negative effects on the physical and mental health of the migration population. This is especially true for temporary migrants (Hu et al. 2011) . Some recent research indicated that rural-to-urban migration can also drive localised declines in biodiversity (Robson and Berkes 2011) , which will also affect human health directly or indirectly (Wilson 2008) . For these reasons, migrants should be paid special attention for their health status, especially for those living in low-rent urban villages. More importantly, a policy should be made to increase the income of these people and decrease the disparity between migrants and local citizens in health care, education and other public services.",

The proportion of people who are overweight and obese is increasing rapidly in China, especially in the urban areas, whilst undernutrition continues in some areas. Health education is essential for urban citizens, which should give a good direction for health living habits, such as low-salt, low fat-diet and more physical activities through less car use.

Furthermore, emerging new infectious diseases bring more challenges to the current control efforts even when they have been successful. This is illustrated by the ecological interaction of people with animals in China favouring the emergence of new microbial threats , such as SARS, highly pathogenic avian influenza and Streptococcus suis. Rural-urban migration induced more temporal sex partners for both the migrants and the non-migrants, which increased the risk of HIV infection (Hu et al. 2006) .

The percentage of population over 65 years old has been increasing in recent decades, and the transition to an older population will present the health system with major costs. China has 6 million patients with dementia and, with a rapidly ageing population, was estimated to have 1 million new cases every year (Qiu 2007) . Family planning in countries with high birth rates has the potential to reduce poverty and hunger (Cleland et al. 2006) . However, China's one-child policy, introduced in 1979 and implemented for over 30 years, has resulted in an increase in older people and a decrease in younger workers, as well as a sex ratio imbalance (Christensen et al. 2009; Grossi 2005) . It is both urgent and necessary for China to solve its problems related to ageing, both for public health and for sustainable economic and social development. A systemic understanding of urbanisation and human health requires a health system which encompasses both environmental health and human health. This is of great importance because disease prevention is less expensive than pharmaceutical and hospital-based care over the long term, and a healthy population is one of the critical pillars of social and economic development. In this paper, we put forward the types of data which need to be collected as part of any early warning, or monitoring and surveillance, health system. Importantly, it includes a role for disaggregated urban-rural data, which, as the WHO points out, is necessary if governments are to counteract health inequities (WHO and UN Habitat 2010). By adopting an ecological public health approach, we show how making human and environmental health central to policy could lead to fairer and more sustainable urban systems.",
