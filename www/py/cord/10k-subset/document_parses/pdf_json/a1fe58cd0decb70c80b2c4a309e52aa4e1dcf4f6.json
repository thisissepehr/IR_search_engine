Gut microbiota has a significant role in host metabolism and homeostasis [2, 3] . A disturbance in this microbial community, which leads to an unhealthy state, is called dysbiosis [4] . Over the past decade, emerging evidence has demonstrated the role of intestinal dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of various conditions, such as infectious, immune, and metabolic diseases [5] , while it has not been studied extensively in critical illness. An extreme and persistent dysbiosis occurs among critically ill patients, regardless of the heterogeneity of disease. The extreme dysbiosis in patients under critical care is due to the stress of critical illness, multiple antibiotics and additional pharmacological interventions, and highly processed enteral/parenteral nutrition [6, 7] . Dysbiosis in critically ill patients may make them prone to hospital-acquired infections, sepsis, multi-organ failure (MOF), energy homeostasis disturbance, muscle wasting, and cachexia [6, 8, 9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 136, "end": 139, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 215, "end": 218, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 219, "end": 221, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 322, "end": 325, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 512, "end": 515, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 912, "end": 915, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 916, "end": 918, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1107, "end": 1110, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1111, "end": 1113, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1114, "end": 1116, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Gut microbiota, dysbiosis and critical illness"}, {"text": "The majority of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) have had a severe illness, trauma, or major surgery, and accordingly they are unable to manage their nutritional demands. Although nutritional support is a daily practice in the ICU, many patients still suffer from malnutrition due to lack of intake or uptake of nutrients [10] . The prevalence of malnutrition in the ICU within developed and developing countries is reported as 50.8% and 78.1%, respectively [11] . Malnutrition is independently associated with longer ICU stay, more ICU readmissions, and a higher incidence of infections and risk of mortality [11] . A greater degree of malnutrition is also associated with a higher risk of 28-day mortality [12] . Malnutrition further tends toward acute or chronic loss of muscle bulk and function [13] . The gut microbiota and their derived metabolites play an essential role in the absorption, storage, and consumption of energy derived from the diet [14, 15] . Previous studies suggest that modulating gut microbiota by novel therapeutics, such as prebiotics, probiotics, or synbiotics, can have an effect on gastrointestinal tolerance and complications of enteral nutrition, which eventually lead to the regulation of energy intake. Recently, Tuncay et al. showed that enteric formula with prebiotic content in patients under neurocritical care was associated with a significant increase in total feed volume and energy intake and a non-significant tendency to achieve a target dose of nutrition more frequently and earlier [16] . Malik et al. also found that in patients in the ICU, receiving enteral formula supplemented with probiotics led to a faster return of gut function (tolerated feeding of 80% of their estimated required calories for 48 h consecutively) [17] . However, Sanaie et al. demonstrated that daily energy and protein intake in patients receiving probiotic supplements on the ICU were not significantly different from the group receiving placebo [18] . In the critical care setting, diarrhea is the most obvious complication of enteral nutrition (EN), which is associated with the inadequacy of energy and macronutrient intake [16] . Previous systematic reviews have confirmed the significant benefit of probiotics in the reduction of diarrhea in hospital patients overall. But a recent meta-analysis focused on patients in the ICU found no benefit of probiotics in preventing or treating diarrhea [19] . Besides, in the dysbiosis state of critical illness, microbial products that reach distant organs like brain, adipose tissue, and liver, favor the development of immune-mediated diseases and metabolic alterations [20] . Gut microbiota metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) can also influence the immune system and host metabolism, which regulates energy homeostasis [20] . Thus, gut microbiota modulation may be beneficial in the regulation of immune and metabolic responses and energy homeostasis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 331, "end": 335, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 467, "end": 471, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 619, "end": 623, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 717, "end": 721, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 808, "end": 812, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 963, "end": 967, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 968, "end": 971, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1538, "end": 1542, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1545, "end": 1562, "text": "Malik et al. also", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1779, "end": 1783, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1980, "end": 1984, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2161, "end": 2165, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2432, "end": 2436, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2652, "end": 2656, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2816, "end": 2820, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Dysbiosis and energy homeostasis in critical illness"}, {"text": "Muscle wasting, characterized by loss of muscle mass and strength, is associated with negative health outcomes such as functional disability, greater risk of infections, delayed recovery, poor life quality, and mortality [21] .

Gut microbiota influence amino acid bioavailability and are sources of different metabolites, such as conjugated linoleic acid, acetate, and bile acids, which modulate muscle metabolism [8] .
