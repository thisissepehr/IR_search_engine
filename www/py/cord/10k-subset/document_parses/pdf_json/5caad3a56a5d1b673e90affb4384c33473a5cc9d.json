Matched HR and DAP subsamples were created to evaluate the effect of the individual components of the DSI on RRs. In addition, time-course of DSI and interaction between DSI and vasopressor dose (DSI*NE.dose) were compared between survivors and non-survivors from both populations, while ROC curves were used to identify variables predicting mortality. Finally, as exploratory observation, effect of early start of vasopressors was evaluated at each Pre-VPs/DSI quintile from the preliminary cohort.",

Intensive Care (2020) 10:41 pressure (SAP) [1, 2] . Nevertheless, alterations of pulse wave could grossly mirror, in some extend, the underlying mechanisms of acute circulatory failure implied in shock. For example, SAP results particularly important to define cardiogenic shock [2] , hemorrhagic [3] or any type of shock with a hypovolemic component, since at very early stage of these conditions, SAP and pulse pressure (PP) fall while diastolic arterial pressure tends to be sustained. However, hypotension observed during septic shock results from a complex interaction between vasodilation, relative and absolute hypovolemia, myocardial dysfunction, and altered blood flow distribution [4] . In particular, vasodilation resulting from the failure of the vascular smooth muscle to constrict is one of the leading mechanisms associated with hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion in septic shock [5] . In these cases, diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) would better reflect vasodilation than SAP or MAP.",

Thus, detection of low DAP at peripheral vessels should reflect systemic vasodilation as long as aortic valve is competent. However, in general, DAP is not considered for definition of septic shock, and with few exceptions, its relationship with clinical outcomes has not been widely described [7] . Important studies in patients with septic shock define hypotension in terms of MAP and SAP values [8] [9] [10] assuming the pivotal role of MAP [11] or SAP, on organ perfusion [12] [13] [14] , in addition to the prognostic value of sustained low MAP values [15] . Nevertheless, evaluation of the loss of vascular tone through the severity of diastolic hypotension could have profound implications on therapeutic decisions since there are not robust clues to rapidly predict when hypotension will be sustainably corrected with fluid loading. Thus, rapid assessment of severity of vasodilation could influence therapeutic decisions such as the early introduction of vasoactive agents [16] , which theoretically would avoid unnecessary fluid administration while promptly restoring tissue perfusion.",

Acute reductions in arterial pressure are compensated by increased sympathetic activity, although sometimes such compensation becomes maladaptive. This was the original rationale to indexing SAP by heart rate (HR) during hemorrhagic shock and acute critical illness [17, 18] , or indexing MAP by HR to detect myocardial hypoperfusion [19] . Likewise, as DAP depends on vascular tone and the duration of the cardiac cycle [20] , a combination of DAP and HR could reflect the severity of circulatory dysfunction during vasodilatory conditions. Thus, we evaluated the relationships between very early HR:DAP ratios (i.e., the diastolic shock index, or DSI, calculated just before or at the start of vasopressor support) and clinical outcomes in patients with septic shock, hypothesizing that very early DSI values could promptly identify patients at high risk of unfavorable outcomes, while persistence of high DSI during the first hours of resuscitation could reflect more severe cardiovascular dysfunction.",

DAP reflects in part the vascular tone when aortic valve is competent. Nevertheless, the duration of the cardiac cycle, the blood volume ejected to the aorta and the arterial compliance also influence DAP [20] . Thus, under isovolemic conditions and constant arterial compliance, shortening diastolic times are associated with higher DAP while a prolonged diastole leads to an opposite effect [20] . Consequently, simultaneous and opposite variations in DAP and HR could suggest more severe cardiovascular dysfunction, with progressively high HR unable to compensate DAP drops as a consequence of gradual decrease in vascular tone. Supporting this, our data suggest that such progressively opposite changes in HR and DAP represent more severe circulatory dysfunction with proportional increases in the relative risk of death.",

Nevertheless, isolated DAP or HR just before or at start of vasopressors was not clearly related with mortality in the preliminary cohort and ANDROMEDA-SHOCK populations. Figure S2 ). In addition, MAP, SAP and \"systolic shock index\" (or, HR:SAP ratio) were not related with mortality in both populations (Additional file 1: Figures S8, S9) . We hypothesized that although MAP and SAP are used to operatively define septic and another types of shock, initial MAP or SAP does not reflect systemic vasodilation, which is a leading mechanism in septic shock. Although DSI depicted a similar AUC-ROC than SOFA score and initial lactate levels, DSI could add some practical and valuable information about how to intervene the initial hemodynamic condition in sepsis. Progressively high DSI values calculated just before and at the start of vasopressor support were related with gradual increases in the risk of death. Patients in the higher quintiles of pre-VPs/DSI and VPs/DSI required more renal replacement therapy, depicted higher lactate values and also showed slower lactate decreases over the first 8 h of resuscitation. They also required significantly more resuscitation fluids and higher doses of Fig. 1 Relative risk of death at day-90 according to pre-vasopressor diastolic shock index (Pre-VPs/DSI) or vasopressor start (VPs/DSI) partitions in the preliminary and ANDROMEDA SHOCK populations. Diastolic shock index values obtained from just before the start of vasopressor (in preliminary cohort) and at the start vasopressor support (in ANDROMEDA-SHOCK) were partitioned into 5 quantiles (Q1 to Q5). Distribution of heart rate (HR) and diastolic pressure (DAP) (top) and their respective diastolic shock index distribution (middle) are presented through the quantile distribution. Boxplots (top and middle) delineate the interquartile range, the median is shown as a line in the middle of the box, and tails represent the 95% range. Coefficients derived from a logistical regression were used to calculate the cut-off value of the diastolic shock index (DSI) detecting the mean risk of mortality of the entire population at 28 days. This point was used as the reference to calculate the adjusted relative risks, in such a way that a relative risk of 1 represents the mean risk of the respective population (bottom). The mean risk and 95% confidence interval (error bars at the bottom) for each percentile were calculated after multivariate adjustment (Cox proportional-hazards model) for the covariables: age, gender, SOFA score day-1, initial arterial lactate and pH, and resuscitation fluids from VP to 8H. The gray zone represents the 95% confidence interval for the Cox regression (continuous line) across the complete population, assuming the diastolic shock index as a continuous variable. Note that adjusted relative risk of death increases as diastolic shock index also does through the quintile distribution vasopressors as reflected by the product of DSI and dose of norepinephrine (DSI*NE.dose). We hypothesize that persistently higher DSI values reflect a lack of vascular tone requiring progressively higher doses of vasopressors with an inadequate restoration of tissue perfusion. However, the observational nature of our study hinders the direct effect of variations in vasopressor dose or fluid loading on the DSI since the resuscitation maneuvers in each group were guided targeting MAP but not DAP.",

Thus, DAP records obtained at peripheral circulation closely reflect central DAP measurements even during severe inflammatory conditions with increased vasodilation and altered arterial compliance.

Second, we did not include a control group of normal subjects, so recognizing a DSI cutoff to identify abnormality could be misleading. Third, although persistently high DSI values were consistently observed in non-survivors in both the preliminary and ANDROMEDA-SHOCK groups, there are no clues about whether it is possible to intervene DSI course or even whether modifying DSI course might influence clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, this could be an important research question as recent experimental observations suggest that some early therapeutic interventions might modify the time-course of cardiovascular dysfunction in septic shock.
