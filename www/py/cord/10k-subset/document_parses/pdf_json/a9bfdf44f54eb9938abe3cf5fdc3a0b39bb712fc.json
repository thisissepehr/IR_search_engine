Some of these substances are used in the treatment of various types of keratinization disorders. Such compounds cannot substitute for vitamin A; indeed some of them even act as vitamin A antagonists [7, 81. The term 'retinoids' is widely employed for this class of compounds. This practice arose from an earlier proposal [5] to use the name 'retinoids' collectively for both natural forms and synthetic analogues of vitamin A that are capable of preventing the development of cancer. General usage of this term is, however, misleading for two reasons. Firstly, the customary practice gives the name 'retinoids', which has an agreed definition based on chemical structure [3] , to a class of compounds defined by their biological activity. Secondly, many synthetic members of this class of compounds, the so-called 'arotinoids' [91 or 'retinoidal benzoic acid derivatives' [lo] as well as others, are not chemically retinoids. They contain, e.g., aromatic rings replacing either the basic &ionone type ring structure or unsaturated bonds of the tetraene side chain of tire retinoid skeleton (Formula IT).",

The full charges are often omitted from the equations used in routine biochemical presentations. For example an equation of the form ATP + acetate = acetyl phosphate + ADP is commonly used in biochemistry. It makes no attempt to show the full ionization or complexation states or the reactants or to balance charges. It has the advantage that it is written in terms of sums of species and leads directly to the expression for the apparent equilibrium constant K'",

In the above biochemical equation, ATP, ADP and acetyl phosphate are obviously sums of species and, if K' is determined at low pH values, acetate represents the sum of the anion and undissociated acetic acid. Similarly, it has become common to use NAD' and NADH in equations, although both of these are in fact negatively charged at normal physiological pH values, without any attempt to balance charges and hydrogen atoms on other species in the equation. This may make it hard to tell whether a chemical equation or a biochemical equation is intended. In view of such difficulties, the panel has recommended that all indications of charges be removed from biochemical equations and that the full chemical equations, which are written in terms of individual species which may be charged (e.g. H', Mg2+, RCOO-, etc.) should be used for those specific cases where thermodynamic behaviour is to be considered.",
