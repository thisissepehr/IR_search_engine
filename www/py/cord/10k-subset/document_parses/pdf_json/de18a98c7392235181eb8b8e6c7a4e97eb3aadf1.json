[1] The new infl uenza virus of H1N1 strain undergoing triple reassortants contains genes from avian, swine and human viruses. [2, 3] In early April 2009, cases of human infection with 2009 pandemic influenza A virus were identified in Mexico [4] and then in the United States. [5] The World Health Organization (WHO) raised the pandemic level from 5 to 6, the highest level after documentation of human to human transmission of the virus in at least three countries in two of the six world regions defi ned by the WHO. [6, 7] The first case of confirmed infection with the virus in India was documented in May 2009. [8] The Saurashtra region is a western part of Gujarat state in India. In Gujarat state, the fi rst H1N1 positive case was reported in June 2009 [9] and in the Saurashtra region in August 2009. [10] The symptoms of 2009 infl uenza A were expected to be similar to the symptoms of regular human seasonal influenza, including fever, cough, sore throat, and myalgia. [11] This report summarizes the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the 117 children with 2009 infl uenza A virus infection, hospitalized in various hospitals of Rajkot city in the Saurashtra region. The study included the two waves of influenza A: the first wave from September 2009 to February 2010 and the second wave from August 2010 to October 2010.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 90, "end": 93, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 217, "end": 220, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 221, "end": 223, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 333, "end": 336, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 368, "end": 371, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 610, "end": 613, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 614, "end": 616, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 707, "end": 710, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 852, "end": 855, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 901, "end": 905, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1071, "end": 1075, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The central government made preparation, from the fi rst reported case of infl uenza A in May 2009 in India, for the management of infected patients.

The Saurashtra region includes following districts, namely Rajkot, Junagadh, Jamnagar, Porbandar, Surendranagar, Kutch, Bhavnagar and Amreli. Rajkot city is in the center of the above mentioned districts. Due to availability of all treating facilities including intensive and ventilatory support, state government established 80-bed swine fl u isolation wards in PDU Medical College and Civil Hospital in Rajkot city. All the private hospitals having an advanced life-saving support were also involved in admitting and managing such positive patients. [12] The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India issued guidelines for classifi cation of infl uenza A cases during screening for home isolation, testing, treatment, and hospitalization: (1) Type A: patients have mild fever plus cough/sore throat with or without body ache, headache, diarrhea and vomiting; they require no oseltamivir treatment but treatment of symptoms only; no test required for infl uenza A; they should be monitored for the progress of disease and reassessed at 24 to 48 hours. (2) Type B: (i) In addition to the signs and symptoms mentioned in type A, if the patient has high grade fever and severe sore throat, he or she may require home isolation and oseltamivir treatment, but no testing is required for infl uenza A; (ii) In addition to type A signs and symptoms, one who has one or more of the following high-risk conditions shall be treated with oseltamivir: children with mild illness but predisposing risk factors; pregnant women; persons aged 65 years or more; patients with lung diseases, heart disease, liver disease, kidney disease, blood disorders, diabetes, neurological disorders, cancer and HIV/AIDS; patients on long-term steroid therapy; no testing required for influenza A. (3) Type C: in addition to the above signs and symptoms in types A and B, if the child has one or more of the following symptoms and signs: breathlessness, chest pain, drowsiness, fall in blood pressure, sputum mixed with blood, and bluish discoloration of nails; children with influenza like illness who have a severe disease as manifested by red flag signs (somnolence, high and persistent fever, inability to feed well, convulsions, shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing, etc); worsening of underlying chronic conditions; all children in this type require testing, immediate hospitalization and treatment.

We found that the median age of children was 2 years which was lower than that in patients with similar findings reported in Canada (4.8 years), [16] the USA (6 years) [17] and Argentina (10 years). [18] In our study, the median time for hospital stay was 7 days, with a range from less than 1 day to 30 days. It was 4 days (range: 2-7 days) in Canada [19] and 8.1 days (range: 6-16 days) in China. [20] The median time was 5 days from onset of illness to hospital admission or diagnosis of infection in contrast to 4 days in Argentina. [18] In the present study, 97% of the children died 5 days after onset of illness compared with 3 days for influenza related deaths in the USA. [21] Most of 2009 influenza A viruses that have been tested by the CDC of the USA are susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir and also resistant to amantadine and rimantadine. [22] Current interim CDC guidelines for pandemic and seasonal influenza recommend the use of either oseltamivir or zanamivir for hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza and for outpatients who are at high-risk of complications. [23] The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India has recommended the use of oseltamivir in tertiary care centers and district hospitals. In the present study, the infl uenza A infected children received treatment with oseltamivir after hospitalization, but only 11.1% of them were treated within 2 days after onset of the disease, while it was 12% in Argentina [18] and 48.1% in the USA. [17] Initial treatment by general practitioners or pediatricians and delayed referral to central hospitals may explain delayed treatment with oseltamivir for suspected or confirmed influenza A patients. In the USA, treatment with oseltamivir has been recommended for patients with 2009 influenza A infection even more than 48 hours after onset of the disease. The treatment was also recommended for children under 1 year old. [24] The monthly distribution of influenza A infected In the second wave, abrupt cases were seen during the period of August 2010 to October 2010. Low atmospheric temperature in December leads to an increased number of patients infected with influenza A. The infection may last to January and February. By the end of February, no positive cases were reported from the study area, indicating that infl uenza virus is related to cold season as a large number of cases occur in winter during the first wave. [25, 26] The second wave took place from August to October, suggesting that high humidity may promote the spread of infection. Most patients had cough (98.3%) and fever (94.0%) as reported elsewhere. [18, 19, [27] [28] [29] [30] The prevalence (21.4%) of underlying conditions was lower in our study than in the United States (67%) [31] and Argentina (35%).
