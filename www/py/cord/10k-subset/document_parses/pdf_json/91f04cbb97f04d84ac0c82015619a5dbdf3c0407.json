A better definition of demyelinating activity within a plaque can be obtained by studying the structural profile and chemical composition of myelin degradation products within macrophages (27, 36, 40, 45, 78) and examining the expression of inflammatory macrophage activation antigens in the lesions (9,56).

This would imply that immunologically active cells enter the CNS via activated endotheliurn and myelin would be destroyed either as a nonspecific reaction by the release of Iymphokines, or by antigen-specific mechanisms. There are several lines of evidence in support of the primary nature of the inflammatory process in MS. In experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (ME), lymphocyte adherence to postcapillary venules with subsequent migration across the endothelium into the perivascular spaces and CNS parenchyma precedes demyelination (35,65). Perivascular inflammatory infiltrates are typically present in MS lesions in areas of active myelin breakdown. The inflammatory reaction in active MS lesions is associated with local upregulation of immunoregulatory molecules (histocompatibility antigens, cytokines, adhesion molecules, chemokines), suggesting a contributing role for the inflammatory response in the disease.

The upregulation of MHC class I1 expression in active lesions located on pericytes, perivascular macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes (5,28,39,87) is not restricted to immune-mediated conditions. Other diseases not linked to T cell dysfunction such as trauma, infarcts, and neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease), are also associated with class I1 MHC expression (48). Finally, silent plaques lacking a lymphocytic infiltrate can also express abundant class I1 on macrophages (66).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "tion may have preceded inflammation (72)."}, {"text": "Most of our knowledge about MS neuropathology is based upon the study of the late chronic MS lesion characterized by a sharply demarcated area where myelin sheaths are selectively destroyed with relative axonal preservation and dense glial scar formation. In addition to these old sclerotic plaques, there may be active lesions with ongoing myelin destruction. Many different theories have been proposed to explain the process of demyelination in MS. Babinski (4) first described the interaction of debris containing cells with the demyelinating fiber and emphasized the central role of leukocytes in myelin destruction. Marburg (46), on the other hand, described that lysis of myelin is followed by the infiltration of phagocytic cells. He postulated a pathogenetic role for humoral myelinotoxic factors. Based upon ultrastructural studies, several patterns of demyelination have been described: a) Receptor-mediated phagocytosis of myelin (\"pinocytosis vermiformis\"): In this pattern an interaction of \"coated pits and vesicles\" on macrophages with myelin sheaths is found (62) . Macrophages are thought to react with opsonized myelin (52,58) through Fc and complement receptors which are expressed in high density on the macrophage cell surface in active lesions (89). Myelin is then ingested by macrophages through vesicles or tubular channels. This view is supported by the demonstration of IgG deposition at the sites of macrophage/myelin interactions (61). b) Myelin stripping: In this pattern, lymphocytes and macrophages invade myelin sheaths and can be found either between myelin lamellae or between the myelin sheath and axon. Disorganization or vesicular dissolution of myelin is present in the vicinity of the inflammatory cells. Although this is a common pattern seen in some EAE models, it appears to be relatively rare in MS and is found mainly in lesions of acute MS with prominent inflammatory infiltrates (36). c) Vesicular disruption of myelin sheaths: Vesicular transformation of parts of the sheaths or even whole myelin has been found mainly in acute MS cases characterized by very severe and destructive lesions (25, 36, 39) . However, a minor degree has also been described in chronic active MS plaques (34,45). This is a prominent pattern in experimental models of demyelination in which the lesions are mediated by antibody and complement (37). Although it is clear from experimental studies that this pattern of demyelination may occur in vivo, in human autopsy tissue this process may be exaggerated by post mortem autolysis (58). d) Dying back oligodendrogliopathy: The hallmark of this pattern is characterized by pathological alter-ations in the most distal extension of oligodendroglia cell processes. It was initially described in a model of toxic oligodendrogliopathy and demyelination (44) and more recently also reported as a feature of brain biopsies obtained during the early phases of the disease (72,73). This pattern of oligodendrocyte damage has been reported in virus-induced models of demyelination (68). Similar alterations have been observed in MAG deficient mice (unpublished observations). The changes of dying back oligodendrogliopathy may reflect impairment of oligodendrocyte metabolism in MS lesions since myelin gene expression in oligodendrocytes may be downregulated in the face of viral infection, inflammation, as well as in some MS cases (30,32,71). It is not certain whether these alterations invariably lead to oligodendrocyte destruction.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1075, "end": 1079, "text": "(62)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2137, "end": 2141, "text": "(25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2142, "end": 2145, "text": "36,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2146, "end": 2149, "text": "39)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ultrastructural Patterns of Myelin Destruction in M S"}, {"text": "Unfortunately, these ultrastructural studies have been based on very small numbers of cases, and,do not confirm a common mechanism of myelin destruction for all patients.

The matter is less clear with regard to the fate of the oligodendrocyte in early stages of multiple sclerosis. Light microscopic, electron microscopic, and immunocytochemical studies have reported a variable degree of oligodendrocyte preservation in actively demyelinating lesions (3 6,s 8,67). Prineas (5 8,s 9/63) immunocytochemically examined fresh CNS lesions of patients with early MS and observed a striking loss of oligodendrocytes during active disease, fpllowed by recruitment of large numbers of undifferentiated oligodendrocyte progenitors which are thought to repopulate the plaque. The final number of oligodendrocytes within a lesion would be dependent upon the availability of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Raine et a1 (67) and Selmaj (79,81) on the other hand described very high numbers of oligodendrocytes in early active lesions, however these cells were subsequently destroyed with disease progression. The authors suggested that oligodendrocytes survive the initial attack, but are later destroyed via additional immune-mediated mechanisms. Rodriguez (72, 73) proposed that oligodendrocytes may be morphologically preserved in the acute lesion, but these cells do not function properly based on the alteration observed in the inner glial loops, the most distal extension of the oligodendroglial membrane. Therefore, the luxury function of these cells (i.e. myelination) may be disrupted without death to these cells.

The high number of plasma cells found in the CNS of patients with late chronic MS may indicate a pathogenetic role of antibodies in demyelination and oligodendroglial destruction, or may represent a n attempt of these antibodies to promote repair (69). There were however exceptions to the general rule, with two out of seven early multiple sclerosis cases demonstrating a dramatic loss of oligodendrocytes, and three out of thirteen late chronic MS cases revealing lesions with considerable oligodendrocyte preservation. Loss or preservation of oligodendro-cytes did not depend as much on the stage of lesion formation as suggested by previous studies (59, 60, 63) , but rather was a characteristic feature, similar in all lesions or lesioned areas of a given patient.

Since the original studies by Ozawa (56) and Briick (10) were restricted to a small total number of cases, we have initiated a similar study in a very large series of MS cases collected at the Mayo Clinic (n=44), the Institute of Neuropathology in Gottingen (n=22), and the Institute of Neurology in Vienna (n=16). It is based on 82 cases in which brain biopsies from early bouts of the disease were available, 16 autopsy cases of acute MS (46) and 9 cases of chronic active MS. The goal of the study was to exclude that the high variability of oligodendrocyte pathology in the previous studies of Ozawa (56) and Briick (10) were due to sample bias. Demyelinating activity in the lesions was determined on the basis of myelin degradation products in macrophages and the presence of early macrophage activation markers, as summarized in Table 2 . Our preliminary results indicate at least five distinct patterns of lesional pathology to be discriminated: (Figure 1) : As in all other MS lesions, myelin was completely lost in these plaques. Active myelin destruction at the lesional borders was associated with a variable but minor reduction (up to 30%) of oligodendrocytes. DNA fragmentation of oligodendrocytes was rare. Remyelination was rapid and complete. (Figure 2 ) : In these lesions, active demyelination was associated with extensive or complete loss of oligodendrocytes. In the area of active myelin destruction many cells with DNA fragmentation were present that expressed markers for oligodendrocytes (MOG, CNPase, or PLP mRNA). Morphological analysis of dying oligodendrocytes revealed that in some cases cell destruction was mediated by apoptosis, whereas in others, particularly those cases with a high plasma cell density, necrosis was dominant. Inactive plaques showed demyelination, extensive glial scarring, and limited remyelination. In these lesions, similar to the first pattern described above, oligodendrocyte density was high in the areas of active myelin breakdown. Yet towards the plaque center there was a progressive reduction of oligodendrocyte density and dying oligodendrocytes were frequently observed. OIigodendrocyte loss was mediated mainly through apoptosis, although in one case with high plasma cell density, necrosis was noted.

These observations challenge the existing scientific dogma that MS is a disease caused by a single pathogenetic mechanism, and rather suggest that the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to demyelination may be fundamentally distinct in different groups of MS patients. This hypothesis may in part explain the variable clinical picture with respect to the neurologic symptoms, natural history, and degree of disability seen in this disease. Furthermore, genetic studies support the theory that the expression of the disease is under polygenic control. It may be that combinations of different susceptibility genes may ultimately dictate the patient's immunopathogenetic response to the inciting injury, and account for specific subtypes of this complex disease. Whether there is only one versus multiple inciting events cannot be determined. These findings may have implications with respect to the design of future therapeutic strategies in MS. We currently rely upon large placebo-controlled double-blind studies to determine whether a particular therapy is efficacious in patients. This approach does not take into account that a therapy which may be useful in one group of patients may be ineffective or possibly deleterious in another. In addition, the existing criteria used to select patients suitable for a clinical trial may not accurately reflect the specific pathogenetic substrate of the disease.
