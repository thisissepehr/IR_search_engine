Serum H202 scavenging activity was inhibited by addition of sodium azide, a catalase inhibitor. Treatment of rats with the oxygen radical scavenger, dimethylthiourea (DMTU), decreased RBC fragility and lung leak but did not alter increased H2Oz scavenging or catalase activity of serum from rats subjected to skin bum. We conclude that increased serum catalase activity is a consequence of thermal skin injury and that increased serum catalase activity may be a mechanism that modulates HzO2-dependent processes following skin bum.",

            "text": "Although respiratory failure is a frequent and devastating complication in burn patients (1, 2) , the mechanisms underlying its development remain unknown. Several studies have implicated increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide anion (O2--), hydrogen peroxide (H202) , and hydroxyl radical (. OH), in the pathogenesis of lung injury following thermal skin injury (bum) (3) (4) (5) , but potentially protective antioxidant enzyme defenses have not been evaluated following skin burn. Recently, we found that H20 2 scavenging activity and serum catalase activity were increased in patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (6) . Based on these two observations, we hypothesized that H20 2 scavenging activity and catalase activity would increase in serum of rats subjected to skin bum, The results of the present investigation support this premise. Skin Burn Protocol. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (Sasco, Omaha, Nebraska) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg). Subsequently, skin over the dorsal lumbosacral area was shaved and exposed to 70~ (bum) or 30~ (sham) water for 30 sec. The former caused a 30% second-degree burn. Rats remained anesthetized and had their temperature monitored on a wanning blanket until blood or serum collection, which occurred 2 h after thermal injury. Blood and serum were obtained by intracardiac puncture. Some rats received dimethylthiourea (DMTU, 250 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) 1 h prior to thermal injury (7) . Control rats received no treatment and were anesthetized immediately prior to blood and serum acquisition. Values for control and sham-treated rats were similar (P > 0.05) and pooled for comparison to bum treatment.",

            "text": "It is known that thermal skin injury causes acute edematous lung injury, erythrocyte hemolysis, complement activation, lung neutrophil accumulation, as well as increases in serum xanthine oxidase (XO) activity and histamine in rats (4, 5, (11) (12) (13) . Since lung injury following thermal injury is prevented by treatment with antioxidants, neutrophil depletion, or XO inhibition, it has been concluded that thermal injury most likely leads to systemic complement activation, neutrophil activation and accumulation in the lung, and the development of acute lung injury that is related to the increased production of toxic oxygen products by activated blood neutrophils and/or XO. It has also been shown that intravenous treatment with exogenous catalase decreases lung injury in rats subjected to thermal injury. This suggests that exogenous increases in serum catalase may alter the development of lung injury in rats subjected to thermal skin injury. However, the increases in serum catalase that occur naturally are much less than those achieved following treatment with exogenous catalase and obviously are not sufficient to prevent lung injury. Whether the increased endogenous serum catalase activity following skin burn limits lung injury, or any other H202-dependent process, in any way or just occurs as a reflection of thermal injury remains speculative. The mechanism through which DMTU protected from lung leak is unclear but may involve scavenging of oxygen radicals (7).",

In addition, increased levels of serum catalase activity have been observed in patients with ARDS (6) and AIDS (14) . In each case, the source and significance of increased serum catalase activity is unclear. However, increased serum catalase activity appears to effectively predict the development of ARDS in patients wil/h sepsis (6) , and serum catalase activity increases progressively with advancing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (i.e., asymptomatic HIV infect:ion < symptomatic HIV infection < AIDS) (14) . The exact nature and consequences of increased serum catalase activity remain to be determined following .skin burn and with respect to the development of ARDS, AIDS, and other processes that may involve H202. It is conceivable that serum catalase can penetrate nficroenvironments, such as the neutrophil-endothelial cell interface, that are inaccessible to catalase in the RBC (15) . Furthermore, the possibility exists that even small increases in serum catalase can alter H202dependent processes under certain circumstances.",
