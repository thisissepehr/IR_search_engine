Generally, V. parahaemolyticus recovered from the environment and/or seafood is thought to be non-pathogenic and the relationship between environmental isolates and acute diarrhoeal disease is poorly understood. In this study, we explored the virulence potential of environmental V. parahaemolyticus isolated from water, plankton and assorted seafood samples collected from the Indian coast. Results: Twenty-two V. parahaemolyticus isolates from seafood harboured virulence associated genes encoding the thermostable-direct haemolysin (TDH), TDH-related haemolysin (TRH), and Type 3 secretion systems (T3SS) and 95.5% of the toxigenic isolates had pandemic strain attributes (toxRS/new + ). Nine serovars, with pandemic strain traits were newly identified and an O4:K36 tdh \u2212 trh + V. parahaemolyticus bearing pandemic marker gene was recognised for the first time. Results obtained by reverse transcription PCR showed trh, T3SS1 and T3SS2\u03b2 to be functional in the seafood isolates.

H14, and to a lesser extent, K23 rapidly proliferated inside Caco-2 cells (Fig. 3c) . Peak numbers of H14 (450% of initial intracellular CFU) was observed in about 3 h. This number decreased rapidly and intracellular bacteria were still visible at 6 h of infection even though the levels were similar to that detected upon initial enumeration (~100%). Intracellular K23 also peaked at 3 h of infection, but the number of bacteria was lower (220% of initial intracellular cfu) and at the end of 6 h, the numbers declined. The decrease in intracellular bacteria could be attributed to the lysis of eukaryotic cells and subsequent killing in the gentamicin containing medium.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to document the presence of vopZ (VPA1336) in V. parahaemolyticus isolated from seafood.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 194, "end": 198, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 199, "end": 202, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 504, "end": 508, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 823, "end": 827, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 828, "end": 831, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 918, "end": 922, "text": "[35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 923, "end": 926, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1007, "end": 1011, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Majority of the toxigenic isolates (95.5%) had pandemic strain features (toxRS/new + ).

Another striking observation is the appearance of tdh \u2212 trh + isolates carrying the toxRS/ new + pandemic marker. Pandemic strains of V. parahaemolyticus are mostly associated with the tdh gene with few reports of GS-positive trh-containing isolates from clinical cases [23, 37, 38] . Data pertaining to the pandemic status of environmental trh-positive V. parahaemolyticus is lacking. Thus, this study is the first to report the isolation of a new serovar (O4:K36) of tdh \u2212 trh + V. parahaemolyticus from seafood with potential pandemic traits. Currently the pandemic group is defined by the presence of tdh and toxRS/new genes. So, the pandemic status and evolution of the three tdh \u2212 trh + isolates identified in this study should be confirmed employing other genetic markers including genomic islands VPaI-1, VPaI-4 and VPaI-5 that are specific for the pandemic group [39] [40] [41] as well as whole genome sequence analysis.

Further, it was noted that strains with identical serotype and/or genotype had different PFGE profiles, as in the case of tdh + trh \u2212 isolates. Moreover, one of the O1:K25 isolate which was not positive in the GS-PCR, clustered along with the isolates having pandemic strain traits. A similar pattern was observed during molecular typing of V. parahemolyticus isolates in China, where seafood isolates having a varying combination of tdh, trh and toxRS/new genes clustered together with pandemic isolates whereas a tdh + trh \u2212 , toxRS/new + clinical isolate was not genetically related to the pandemic clones [44] . Comparison of MLST datasets of different bacterial species revealed environmental isolates of marine and estuarine V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus have very high homologous recombination rate as they frequently adapt for survival [45] . It was proposed that V. parahaemolyticus may have an epidemic population structure [46] where the isolates undergo frequent genetic recombination resulting in well-adapted clones [47] .

As an initial step, the transcriptional activity of the haemolysin and T3SS2 effector genes were analysed in the selected isolates. While all the clinical strains transcribed both the haemolysin genes, only trh gene was functional in the environmental isolates. The expression results were substantiated by low haemolytic activity of the environmental isolates on human RBC. It is shown that poor expression of tdh gene corresponds to two point mutations in the promoter region (substitution of A to G in the \u2212 35 sequence, G to A at \u2212 3 nucleotide position from the \u2212 10 sequence) [48, 49] . We presume that these mutations may be one of the reasons for the observed reduced transcription. Moreover, we found the isolates carried a single copy of tdh (Additional file 1: Figure S4 ), which is generally responsible for weak and intermediate haemolysis due a weak promoter compared to tdh2 [48] . The existence of a second copy of tdh or mutations in the promoter needs to be further determined. Similarly, the low haemolytic activity of clinical as well as environmental tdh \u2212 trh + isolates was not surprising as both contain the trh2 allele (Additional file 1: Figure S4 ), which exhibit reduced hemolysis, not due to reduced gene expression, rather, owing to the differences in the amino acid molecular conformation and binding capacity of RBC by the trh2 product [50, 51] . Further, the tdh-trh + environmental isolate K23 transcribed the genes vopC, vopA and vopL encoding effectors that promote invasion and modulate host cell behaviour, making it a possible pathogen.

Therefore, cytotoxicity may not be a reliable indicator of pathogenesis. It was also found that the ability to induce cytotoxicity was not dependent on the virulence genes tested. Interestingly, in the present investigation, the cytotoxicity of tdh \u2212 trh + isolate K23 was very low compared to its clinical counterpart with a similar genetic profile. It is well established that T3SSs are responsible for host cell cytotoxic damage, with T3SS1 being the dominant contributor [55] . Perhaps the isolate might have a varied architecture and integrity of T3SS1 gene cluster causing it to assemble a defective translocon and a reduced delivery of T3SS1 effectors responsible for cytotoxicity. It is also possible that the clinical strain might harbour some exclusive genes not present in environmental isolate genome that can induce cytotoxic damage. Meanwhile, the cytotoxicity of the isolates that do not harbour virulence genes was noteworthy.

The ability of the representative tdh-positive (H14) and trh-positive (K23) isolates to invade was followed by survival and replication within the intracellular environment. Further, infection with H14 and K23 caused disruption of tight junctions and re-organisation of actin cytoskeleton, both of which can compromise the epithelial integrity. Recent research classifies V. parahaemolyticus as a facultative intracellular pathogen and T3SS2 effectors, VopC and VopL promote invasion and intracellular survival [56] in addition to inducing dramatic changes in the actin cytoskeleton along with VopV [57] [58] [59] . It was found that in spite of a functional vopC and a weakly transcribed vopL, H14 could still gain access to Caco-2 cell, persist inside and induce changes on tight junctions and actin cytoskeleton. Burdette et al. [60] showed that T3SS1 also causes changes in actin cytoskeleton. The effects seen with the environmental strains may be due to an active T3SS1 albeit the contribution of T3SS2 effectors cannot be ignored, especially with K23, which can emerge as a potential pathogen and elicit a full blown pathogenic response under a favorable environment of host intestine. Moreover, the study detected a non-toxigenic isolate, ME8, from estuarine water exhibiting an invasive phenotype. Perhaps it may be the result of high levels of adhesion rather than active invasion.

Attributing pathogenic potential for environmental isolates is an important aspect of understanding health risks associated with seafood borne V. parahaemolyticus.
