However, the biochemistry of hematophagy has been studied in a few species of direct medical interest and is still underdeveloped in most invertebrates, as in general is the study of venom toxins. In cone snails, leeches, arthropods and snakes, the strong target specificity of venom toxins uniquely aligns them to industrial and academic pursuits (pharmacological applications, pest control etc.) and provides a biochemical tool for studying biological activities including cell signalling and immunological response. Neogastropod snails (cones, oyster drills etc.) are carnivorous and include active predators, scavengers, grazers on sessile invertebrates and hematophagous parasites; most of them use venoms to efficiently feed. It has been hypothesized that trophic innovations were the main drivers of rapid radiation of Neogastropoda in the late Cretaceous. We present here the first molecular characterization of the alimentary secretion of a non-conoidean neogastropod, Colubraria reticulata. Colubrariids successfully feed on the blood of fishes, throughout the secretion into the host of a complex mixture of anaesthetics and anticoagulants. We used a NGS RNA-Seq approach, integrated with differential expression analyses and custom searches for putative secreted feeding-related proteins, to describe in detail the salivary and mid-oesophageal transcriptomes of this Mediterranean vampire snail, with functional and evolutionary insights on major families of bioactive molecules. Results: A remarkably low level of overlap was observed between the gene expression in the two target tissues, which also contained a high percentage of putatively secreted proteins when compared to the whole body. At least 12 families of feeding-related proteins were identified, including: 1) anaesthetics, such as ShK Toxin-containing proteins and turripeptides (ion-channel blockers), Cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs), Adenosine Deaminase (ADA); 2) inhibitors of primary haemostasis, such as novel vWFA domain-containing proteins, the Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 5 (ENPP5) and the wasp Antigen-5; 3) anticoagulants, such as TFPI-like multiple Kunitz-type protease inhibitors, Peptidases S1 (PS1), CAP/ShKT domain-containing proteins, Astacin metalloproteases and Astacin/ShKT domain-containing proteins; 4) additional proteins, such the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE: vasopressive) and the cytolytic Porins. Conclusions: Colubraria feeding physiology seems to involve inhibitors of both primary and secondary haemostasis, anaesthetics, a vasoconstrictive enzyme to reduce feeding time and tissue-degrading proteins such as Porins and Astacins. The complexity of Colubraria venomous cocktail and the divergence from the arsenal of the few neogastropods studied to date (mostly conoideans) suggest that biochemical diversification of neogastropods might be largely underestimated and worth of extensive investigation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Hematophagy arose independently multiple times during metazoan evolution, leading to the appearance of several lineages of vampire animals that exploit hosts' blood, a renewable and nutrient-rich source.

These investigations revealed that hematophagous animals have convergently recruited a series of molecules acting on different physiological stages of host hemostasis, including vasoconstriction, formation of both platelet plugs and fibrin clots and fibrinolysis [3, 5, 7, 9] . Platelet aggregation is the first stage of hemostasis, and is activated by collagen, thrombin, ADP and thromboxane A [9] . Secondary hemostasis, or blood coagulation cascade, consists of a series of enzymatic reaction where coagulation factors (inactive proenzymes) are converted in their active forms, generally proteases, that in turn activate the next proenzyme in the cascade, converging on a final common pathway concluded by thrombin that converts fibrinogen in fibrin clot. Generally speaking, hematophagous animals target the hemostatic system of the host at the level of both primary and secondary hemostasis, producing a number of proteins of different molecular masses, that act interacting with several targets and exert a variety of inhibitory mechanisms [3, 5, 7, 9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 187, "end": 190, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 191, "end": 193, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 270, "end": 273, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 274, "end": 277, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 278, "end": 281, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 591, "end": 594, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 595, "end": 597, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 598, "end": 600, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 601, "end": 603, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 723, "end": 726, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1374, "end": 1377, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1378, "end": 1380, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1381, "end": 1383, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1384, "end": 1386, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Among the less studied hematophagous groups, vampire snails belong to three lineages of Neogastropoda, namely Cancellariidae [10] , Colubrariidae [11] , and Cystiscidae [12, 13] that according to the available phylogenetic framework for neogastropods [14] [15] [16] evolved hematophagy independently (Fig. 1) . Neogastropoda include many familiar molluscs, such as cone snails (Conidae), purple dye snails (Muricidae), mud snails (Nassariidae), olive snails (Olividae), oyster drills (Muricidae), tulip shells (Fasciolariidae), and whelks (Buccinidae). The vast majority of neogastropods are carnivorous, with a degree of predatory activity that varies from actively seeking prey, scavenging, grazing on sessile invertebrates, or hematophagous parasitism. According to the fossil record, the adaptive radiation of neogastropods has been particularly rapid [17] and was accompanied by the diversification of their predatory lifestyles including a number of different trophic strategies. It has been thus hypothesized [17, 18] that evolutionary innovations related to the biochemistry of feeding were the main drivers of the rapid neogastropod radiation in the late Cretaceous, but such innovations have been investigated to date only in a few species of the venomous Conoidea [19] [20] [21] [22] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 125, "end": 129, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 146, "end": 150, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 169, "end": 173, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 174, "end": 177, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 251, "end": 255, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 256, "end": 260, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 261, "end": 265, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 856, "end": 860, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1016, "end": 1020, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1021, "end": 1024, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1279, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1280, "end": 1284, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1285, "end": 1289, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1290, "end": 1294, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 300, "end": 308, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "The buccinoidean family Colubrariidae includes two dozen marine shallow-water species, probably all hematophagous, that inhabit rocky and coral environments in tropical, subtropical and temperate seas. At least six species (25 % of the family) have been documented in a parasitic association with different species of fish, mainly belonging to the family Scaridae [11, 23] . Both females and males are hematophagous: the blood meal is not related to any particular physiological state, and may occur at any time, although in nature is generally observed during the night time [11, 23] . The association is not species-specific, but seem to require a resting or slow moving fish (Modica & Oliverio, unpublished observation) . Colubrariidae use a long and thin proboscis to feed on the blood of fishes [11, 23] (Modica & Oliverio, unpublished observation; Fig. 2 ). Specimens of the genus Colubraria Schumacher, 1817, which accounts for most of the species diversity of colubrariids, can extend their proboscis to a length exceeding three times the shell length. Initially, the extended proboscis contacts the skin of the prey, then, it gains access to the blood vessels of the fish. The radula is extremely minute in Colubraria, so that the genus was considered radula-less until very recently [15] . While a scraping action by such a reduced radula is still possible, the wounds observed in fishes seem to indicate the involvement of bioactive secretions (Fig. 2b) . The snail then apparently takes advantage of the blood pressure of the fish to ingest its meal, congruently with the thin structure of the proboscis that is unlikely to exert an active suction [15] . Experimental observations on different Colubraria species (Modica and Oliverio, unpublished) suggest that adaptation to hematophagy involves the use of anesthetic and anticoagulant compounds. In fact, open wounds on the fish skin, often accompanied by bleeding, are evident on the fish skin after Colubraria detaching (Fig. 2b) . Moreover, the fishes being fed on are generally resting and do not seem to be disturbed by the hematophagous activity of the colubrariid snail. It should be noted that anesthetization is reversible, as the fish usually recovers its full mobility in a few minutes after the snail disengages. This observation, indicating that the anaesthetic compounds used by the snail are not lethal to the prey, is in agreement with field observations that tropical colubrariids usually feed on fish sleeping in crevices of the reef (M. Oliverio unpublished observation, [11, 23] ). Colubraria is a buccinoidean neogastropod, with some remarkable anatomical peculiarities, mainly regarding the structure of the anterior and midposterior oesophagous, described elsewhere for the type species C. muricata [15] . The anatomical structures responsible for anesthetic secretion have not been yet identified, however given the Colubrariidae foregut anatomy (Fig. 2e-f ) anticoagulants are likely produced in the salivary glands. While the absence of accessory salivary glands, gland and valve of Leiblein are features quite common amongst buccinoideans [24] [25] [26] , the glandularization of the posterior portion of the mid-oesophagous is a peculiar derived characteristic of colubrariids [15] , worth of investigation since it may be related to the hematophagous lifestyle and it potentially shares some homology degrees with the toxoglossan venom glands [24] [25] [26] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 364, "end": 368, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 369, "end": 372, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 576, "end": 580, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 581, "end": 584, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 678, "end": 722, "text": "(Modica & Oliverio, unpublished observation)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 800, "end": 804, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 805, "end": 808, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1293, "end": 1297, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1660, "end": 1664, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1725, "end": 1759, "text": "(Modica and Oliverio, unpublished)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2553, "end": 2557, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2558, "end": 2561, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2785, "end": 2789, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3129, "end": 3133, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3134, "end": 3138, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3139, "end": 3143, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3268, "end": 3272, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3435, "end": 3439, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3440, "end": 3444, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3445, "end": 3449, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 854, "end": 860, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1455, "end": 1464, "text": "(Fig. 2b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1985, "end": 1994, "text": "(Fig. 2b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2933, "end": 2943, "text": "(Fig. 2e-f", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "We present here the first molecular characterization of the alimentary secretions of a non-conoidean neogastropod, describing the salivary glands and mid-oesophagous transcriptomes of the hematophagous Mediterranean colubrariid Colubraria reticulata, with functional and evolutionary insights on major classes of bioactive molecules.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "After sequencing and filtering we obtained a final dataset of 220,305,266 filtered reads that were used to build the transcriptome assembly (Additional file 1: Table S1 ).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 160, "end": 168, "text": "Table S1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "General assembly characteristics"}, {"text": "Assembly produced a total of 144,380 contigs longer than 60 bp, ranging from 60 bp to 16,266 bp (median 230 bp); 56 % of the total contigs were longer than 200bp.

The transcriptomic profiles of the two secretory tissues studied are different, with a reduced overlap in the classes of molecules dominating their secretions, and indicate a large degree of specialization, with a significantly higher complexity in the salivary glands. Anticoagulant activities in the saliva, which is secreted both into the prey and along the extremely long anterior oesophagus, can be ascribed to the synergic action of several molecules, with a crucial role possibly played by the vWFA domain-containing proteins, encoded by numerous contigs overexpressed at the highest levels in the salivary subset. The mid-oesophageal transcriptome is apparently less complex than the salivary one and is dominated by transcripts encoding for a turritoxin-like protein and for a two Kunitz-domains protease inhibitor These expression patterns reflect the different physiological roles of the two tissues. We hypothesize that the mid-oesophageal turritoxin is produced when the snail approaches the fish and, as in the case of the venomous cocktail of Conus geographus, it may be involved in the induction of a \"hypnotic\" state in the fish. C. geographus, as other so called net-hunter cone snails, engulfs fish (or even a small school of fishes) with its highly extensible rostrum before stinging. Apparently, when the fish is approached by a cone snail, it remains in an almost hypnotic state until the snail is close enough to engulf it [22] displaying a behavior extremely similar to Colubraria predatory activity. The biochemistry of the induction of \"hypnosis\" has not been investigated to date in Conus. In Colubraria the use of an oesophageal secretion in the external environment could be possible due to the loss of the valve of Leiblein, a structure that in neogastropod separates the mid from the anterior oesophagus and thus from the environment [15, 26] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1695, "end": 1699, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2114, "end": 2118, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2119, "end": 2122, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Physiology of feeding"}, {"text": "Afterwards, when the blood meal is ingested, the main task of the oesophagus would be avoiding blood clotting during its passage through the stomach, where it will be digested.

First, when the proboscis contacts the fish, the snail has to gain access to the blood. The massive secretion of porins, maybe assisted by the metalloproteases, probably elicit a potent cytolytic activity [79, 106] , that associated with the scraping action of the radula allows the snail to open large circular wounds on the fish skin (Fig. 2B) . Unquestionably, an anesthetic activity is crucial to efficiently accomplish blood-feeding in any hematophagous taxa. In Colubraria this anesthetic activity is likely due to the concerted activity of ShKT-containing proteins, especially the CAP-ShKT that act as K channel modulators [78] , and ADA, that may reduce local pain perception by removing adenosine [60] . The anticoagulant action at the site of the wound and in the anterior digestive tract is mediated by the salivary production of a complex mixture of anticoagulant compounds. The vWFA-containing proteins, novel proteins here described for the first time, may act as platelet antiaggregants and target primary hemostasis, throughout a mechanism still to be defined but probably including direct scavenging of thrombocytes. Anti-platelet activity can be assisted by the Antigen-5 protein, via a radical superoxide removal mechanism [92] . ENPP5 can participate to disarrange primary hemostasis, producing Ap4A that reinforce the inhibition of thrombocyte aggregation [100] . Secondary hemostasis may be targeted by the 4 Kunitz domain protein, similar to the tick Rhipicephalus pulchellus Tetralaris, a potent thrombin and TF/FVIIa complex inhibitor [52, 54] , and to TFPI, that modulates factor Xa. Astacins and peptidases S1 also likely contribute to impair hemostasis, as described e.g. in snakes and spiders, due to the fibrinogenolytic activity of astacins [79] , and to the hemorrhagic-anticoagulant activity of PS1 that involves the degradation of several hemostatic factors [97] . Finally, salivary glands produce ACE that owing to its vasopressive activity can increase cardiac frequency in the fish and maximize blood income through the snail foregut, considerably reducing Colubraria feeding time. Vasoconstriction is a defense mechanism that is part of the hemostatic system, and is generally counteracted by hematophagous animals; interestingly, in a \"passive feeder\" such as Colubraria it becomes advantageous to the parasite, explaining the recruitment of ACE enzyme in the venomous cocktail.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 409, "end": 413, "text": "[79,", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 414, "end": 418, "text": "106]", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 834, "end": 838, "text": "[78]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 910, "end": 914, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1446, "end": 1450, "text": "[92]", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 1581, "end": 1586, "text": "[100]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 1764, "end": 1768, "text": "[52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1769, "end": 1772, "text": "54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1976, "end": 1980, "text": "[79]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 2096, "end": 2100, "text": "[97]", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 540, "end": 549, "text": "(Fig. 2B)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Physiology of feeding"}, {"text": "Most hematophagous animals produce a complex mixture of anti hemostatic molecules that act synergistically to impair hemostasis in the host, the natural response to vascular injury aimed to arrest bleeding and based on the triad of platelet aggregation, blood clotting and vasoconstriction.

Primary hemostasis is targeted by several molecules produced in different hematophagous species, that act at various stages, including salivary apyrases, epinephrine and serotonine binding molecules and nitrophorins in several arthropods; lipocalins in Rhodnius prolixus, triatomines and ticks; collagen binding proteins as antiplatelets in mosquitos and leeches; integrin antagonists in ticks and hookworms [6] .

In fact, although hemostasis in fish involves the same mechanisms and factors described in mammals (except for the presence in fish of nucleated thrombocytes instead of anucleated platelets), coagulation time is generally shorter, due to the high levels of coagulation factors contributing to high activity of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathway [116] .
