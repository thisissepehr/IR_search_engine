Due to the fact that subjects in this study belonged to a young and homogeneous group, of particular interest to us was the influence of both burn severity and time factor on the types of microbial isolates. Several multivariate analyses of prospective or retrospective studies have revealed that the degree of burn wounds was a major risk factor for microbial colonization and infection [1, 5, 7, 26] . Compared to \u226419% of TBSA, patients with greater than 20% of TBSA were more than twice (RR 2.09-2.41) likely to be infected at a rate that was five times faster [7] . Several studies revealed that patients with TBSA range greater than 25% or greater than 30% had a high risk of microbial infection, because these patients usually need to use invasive devices for treatment [4, 26] . One report suggested that infection rates rose by an increase in TBSA of burn; they observed infection rates of 18, 30 and 52% in OR odds ratio, CI confidence interval, HR hazards ratio patients with 15-30%, 31-50% and 51-69% of TBSA respectively [5] . In the present study, patients with severe burns cases had the average TBSA of 46.1%; however, infection rates for patients with greater than 50% TBSA rose by 56.8%. Unexpectedly, our data showed the number of isolated GPC were the highest in patients with less than 39% TBSA, and the proportion of isolated GPC showed a downward trend (p = 0.027) with the increase in TBSA extent. However, in terms of overall isolated microorganisms, our data were consistent with previously published reports [1, 5, 7] . We found an upward trend (p < 0.001) in the proportion of overall microbial isolates over time, until the TBSA reached 79%. Afterwards, the trend stabilized followed by a decline. In general, the risk of death of patients with severe burns was relatively high and rapid, so overall isolated microbial maybe thereby reduced. However, our data could not confirm this statement due to death in only one case (70% TBSA).

Another study using multiple analysis revealed that only the third-degree burn (OR 1.10, 95% CI, 1.02-1.19, p = 0.012) was an independent risk factor [23] . Using univariable analysis, our results demonstrated significantly higher likelihood of MDRO infections (1.14-1.79 times) for every 10% increase in the third-degree burn severity. However, when the multiple analyses were used after adjusted TBSA variable, the risk of MDRO was reduced by 47-74%.

The cases had homogeneity including patient age, medical treatment and care, and environmental setting factors. Therefore, our results successfully demonstrated the trends in microbial isolation and important factors that govern the rate of isolation. Second, the dispersion of the patients in different 5 ICUs and burn ward might cause some heterogeneity of the sampling.
