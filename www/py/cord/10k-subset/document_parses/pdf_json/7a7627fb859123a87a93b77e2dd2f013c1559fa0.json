Methods Data from 735 patients undergoing primary liver resection for HCC between 2002 and 2014 were analyzed. Short-and long-term outcomes were compared between the RD group, defined by a preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate of \\45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and the non-RD group. Results Sixty-two patients had RD. The incidence of postoperative pleural effusion (24 vs. 11%; P = 0.007) and major complications (Clavien-Dindo III-V; 31 vs. 15%; P = 0.003) were significantly higher in RD patients. In RD patients with Child-Pugh A, 90-day mortality rate (1.9%) and median survival time (6.11 years) were comparable to that of non-RD patients. In contrast, RD patients with Child-Pugh B had a very high 90-day mortality rate (22.2%), and a significant shorter median survival time compared to non-RD patients (1.19 vs. 4.84 years; P = 0.001). Conclusions Liver resection for Child-Pugh A patients with RD is safe and has comparable oncological outcomes compared to non-RD patients.

The number of patients with RD was significantly smaller than patients without RD, and the results may have been biased because of limited statistical power. Furthermore, the number of Child-Pugh B patients with RD was extremely small (n = 9), which may have affected the statistical significance. Another limitation of this study is the low rate of laparoscopic liver resection (3.0%), which reportedly decreases the rate of postoperative ascites and shortens hospital stay [27] [28] [29] . Thus, our proposal of surgical indication needs validation at centers where laparoscopic liver resections are more frequently performed. The impact of RD on outcomes after liver resection has been reported in eight studies [4] [5] [6] [7] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Of these, four studies deduced that RD itself was not a surgical contraindication, whereas one study suggested the need for careful patient selection. In the present study, we first revealed that preoperative RD had an important impact on the postoperative outcome, especially in Child-Pugh B patients. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the largest single-institution series of liver resections for HCC patients with RD and impaired liver function.
