In epidemiology, further clarifications of epidemiological functions are needed: while host roles may be defined, they are often used loosely, partly because of a lack of clarity on the relationships between a host's function and its epidemiological role. Here we focus on the definition of bridge hosts and their epidemiological consequences. Bridge hosts provide a link through which pathogens can be transmitted from maintenance host populations or communities to receptive populations that people want to protect (i.e., target hosts). A bridge host should (1) be competent for the pathogen or able to mechanically transmit it; and (2) come into direct contact or share habitat with both maintenance and target populations. Demonstration of bridging requires an operational framework that integrates ecological and epidemiological approaches. We illustrate this framework using the example of the transmission of Avian Influenza Viruses across wild bird/poultry interfaces in Africa and discuss a range of other examples that demonstrate the usefulness of our definition for other multi-host systems.

In multihost systems, the role played by each host population in pathogen dynamics is determined by the species' competence for the pathogen (i.e., its receptivity to infection and its capacity to replicate and transmit the pathogen [5] ), its exposure to the pathogen determined by the host ecology/behaviour and its interactions with other host populations (including vectors for vectorborne infections) leading to infectious contacts, and finally, the composition of the host community that will determine the range of inter-host interactions [6] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 279, "end": 282, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 585, "end": 588, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 824, "end": 827, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1137, "end": 1140, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A functional approach to disease ecology"}, {"text": "One of the central questions in disease ecology is that of how the community composition of potential host species relates to the dynamics of pathogen transmission within the host community, as opposed to within a population of a single species.

As defined by Haydon et al. [10] and more recently revised by Viana et al. [9] , a conceptual framework for the role of hosts in epidemiology requires the definition of the target host: \"the population of concern to the observer\" in the geographic area under study (Table 1) .

A maintenance host is a host population (single population) or community/host complex (several sympatric host populations) \"in which the pathogen persists even in the complete absence of transmission from other hosts\" [12] . The maintenance function depends on host density, and on intraand inter-host infectious contacts (i.e., a contact leading to infection amongst other intra-host factors; [14] ). In multihost systems, the notion of a maintenance community in which several populations from different species play a role in the maintenance of the pathogen seems more appropriate than the \"reservoir\" concept [11, 15] for understanding pathogen dynamics. The reservoir concept is still being used in contradictory ways, as discussed by several authors [10] [11] [12] . Haydon et al. [10] extended the definition of reservoir by adding \"source populations\" that may not be involved in the maintenance of the pathogen but rather in the transmission of the pathogen to the target population. Ashford [11] defined a \"liaison host\" as linking the reservoir to another host population, with no explicit reference to target populations. We agree with Ashford [11] that source population should not be included in the definition of the reservoir, as this term is strongly linked to the concept of maintenance and because control of infection in the reservoir would be different if targeted at the maintenance or source populations. For example, aiming at controlling the infection in a maintenance vs. a source population might have different outcomes, since the maintenance host could still re-infect the source population in the latter case. To add to the confusion, Suz\u00e1n et al. [16] presented a new framework to understand patterns in space and time of meta-communities of hosts and parasites. In their first figure they display in red \"reservoir species\" and in orange \"alternative hosts\", together \"maintaining higher infection of prevalence\". Clearly, their concept of \"reservoir\" differs from that of Haydon et al. [10] , who argued that any host involved in the maintenance of the pathogen should be part of the reservoir. The difference in definitions is identical with Plowright et al. [17] : they present domestic horses as potential source populations (defined in the article as \"recipient\" and \"intermediate hosts\") of Hendra viruses for human populations without considering them as part of the reservoir (presented as the bat community). The extensive use of the \"reservoir\" concept under multiple definitions and the lack of consensus around the liaison host and source population concepts (revealed by the scarcity of use of these two last terms in the literature) requires a refined conceptual framework and definitions. Agreeing with others [11, 12] , we thus prefer to use only maintenance host or community, a term that refers better to the dynamic aspect of the functional role than the static notion of a reservoir [6, 18] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 314, "end": 318, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 490, "end": 494, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 709, "end": 713, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 714, "end": 717, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 852, "end": 856, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 857, "end": 861, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 862, "end": 866, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 883, "end": 887, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1097, "end": 1101, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1252, "end": 1256, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1774, "end": 1778, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2115, "end": 2119, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2289, "end": 2293, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2853, "end": 2857, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2858, "end": 2861, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3031, "end": 3034, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3035, "end": 3038, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Transmission function and bridge host"}, {"text": "Although the maintenance-target host relationship and its link with the maintenance function have been properly defined, the function of pathogen transmission to the target host needs a clearer definition. Interspecific pathogen transmission is of crucial importance for infectious disease management. Disease control can target the maintenance host to stop pathogen maintenance and circulation in the ecosystem (i.e. targeting the maintenance function); however, as this option is often unfeasible (for practical or ethical reasons, notably concerning wildlife populations), one could also try to break the transmission pathway that brings the pathogen to the target host. We therefore define the transmission function as the capacity to transmit the pathogen to the target host. This function must be separated from the maintenance function, as the maintenance host does not always have infectious contact with the target host. When it has direct contact with the target host, then the maintenance host is implicated in the maintenance and transmission functions. When it does not, a bridge host (Table 1) can connect (i.e., have infectious contact with) both maintenance and target hosts, \"bridging\" the gap between them. Using this functional definition, the concept of the reservoir as revisited by Haydon et al. [10] and more recently by Viana et al. [9] , does not refer clearly to a single epidemiological function, because it includes maintenance host(s) involved in the maintenance function and potentially in the transmission function as well as non-maintenance population(s) only involved in the transmission function.

According to our definition, a bridge host is involved in the transmission function while not involved in the maintenance function. Two main prerequisites must be fulfilled for a host to qualify as a bridge host. The first prerequisite is that the host must be competent for the pathogen (i.e., must be receptive to infection, permit pathogen replication, and be able to excrete it) without being able to maintain it alone, in which case the host would be considered as a maintenance host; or alternatively, the host should be able to mechanically transport the pathogen [20, 21] . Its competence will influence the capacity of a bridge host to achieve the transmission function: if the bridge host has a short pathogen excretion period, it will be able to transmit the pathogen to a target population only if the time lag between contact with a maintenance and then a target host is shorter than the excretion period, or if the distance between target and maintenance is shorter than the maximum distance that the bridge host can travel during its excretion phase.

Bats, for example, are believed to be the maintenance host for Ebola, and can be sympatric with people; but Ebola transmission from bats to humans is enhanced by the great apes (whose susceptibility to Ebola seems to indicate that they are not maintenance hosts) which feed with bats and are fed upon by humans [22] . It is interesting to note that in all cases, even a R 0 close to zero (approximating a dead-end host) could still be important for the transmission function: the capacity to excrete the pathogen for a few hours, associated with some form of dispersal, may be sufficient for a bridge host to come into contact with the target host and infect it. For pathogens like Ebola, the range of hosts that is classically considered to be important in disease ecology may have to be broadened by including hosts that are able to transmit the pathogen over short time-and space-scales. These hosts are commonly considered as playing no role in pathogen ecology and are called dead-end hosts (e.g., most wild avian hosts for avian influenza virus -AIV -apart from Anseriformes and Charadriiformes).

The following framework used in a recent study [23] and here developed in detail, aims at first gathering/collecting available ecological and epidemiological information; second, at synthesizing this information to provide a priority list of species that act as potential bridge hosts; and finally, at undertaking targeted sampling that can determine the competence of the high priority species and revisit the framed hypotheses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 961, "end": 965, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1015, "end": 1019, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A framework to identify bridge hosts for AIV"}, {"text": "The range of methods available to characterize host competence for AIV and contact patterns between maintenance, potential bridge and target host populations is drawn from the fields of epidemiology and avian ecology ( Table 2) .

Virological surveillance (e.g. polymerase chain reaction -PCR techniques) can provide information about host contacts between potential bridge and maintenance hosts if data are collected close to wetlands where waterfowl communities are known to occur.

However, embracing the functional approach presented here makes sense to look for potential bridge hosts that could link maintenance bats and humans.

As a second example of the utility of the bridge host framework, Nugent [12] offers a comprehensive description of the bTB multi-host system in New Zealand. The cattle industry in New Zealand suffers from continuous spillover of the bTB mycobacterium from the maintenance host, the brush-tailed possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). The control of possum populations by depopulation is mainly implemented in areas around farms that are at high-risk of transmission to cattle, leaving high densities of possums in more distant forest and providing a gradient of bTB prevalence. This apparently efficient strategy is, however, thwarted by three potential bridge hosts (feral pigs Sus scrofa, red deer Cervus elaphus, and feral ferrets Mustela furo) that are involved in transmission (case G in Figure 1 , called \"link-host\" in the article but lacking a more conceptual definition). Infected pigs and deer with large home ranges may leave the forest to die (or be hunted) around farms, providing an opportunity for ferrets to become infected when feeding on carcasses and subsequently infecting cattle or possums. This study is particularly interesting for 3 reasons: (1) the complexity and low probability of the chain of events leading to infection of the target population do not prevent bTB occurrence and the failure of disease control; (2) disease control targeted at the maintenance population prevents the transmission link between the maintenance and target hosts but the transmission pathways built by bridge hosts (case A' in Figure 1 ) reduce the effectiveness of control, proving the importance of considering this epidemiological function and host role; and (3) the plasticity of the roles of host populations in disease epidemiology, which is heavily influenced by the environmental, ecological and anthropological context.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 58, "end": 62, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 308, "end": 312, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 387, "end": 391, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1101, "end": 1109, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1843, "end": 1851, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Bridge hosts and other multi-host systems"}, {"text": "The concepts of transmission function and bridge host contribute to a better understanding of disease ecology in multi-host systems by clarifying the epidemiological processes that are relevant for disease transmission and maintenance.

Bridge hosts can play a pertinent and legitimate role in disease ecology and could become the targets for surveillance and control for some multi-host systems. For example, in some ecosystems, domestic bird populations are rarely in direct contact with wild waterfowl populations but phylogenetic analyses have indicated that most precursors of HPAIV in gallinaceous poultry have originated from wild waterfowl [48] , suggesting that bridge hosts play a role in AIV transmission at the wild/domestic bird interface.

Such an approach will help to guide high-throughput sequencing tools towards key hosts within a given epidemiological context, increasing the efficiency of surveillance and control efforts.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 189, "end": 193, "text": "[58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 194, "end": 197, "text": "59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 337, "end": 341, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "4 Epidemiology and Public Health Unit", "authors": [{"first": "", "middle": [], "last": "Ur Agirs", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "", "middle": [], "last": "Cirad", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "France", "middle": [], "last": "Montpellier", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Cirad-Rp-Pcp", "middle": [], "last": "Ur Agirs", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Zimbabwe", "middle": [], "last": "Harare", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2014, "venue": "Institut Pasteur du Cambodge", "volume": "", "issn": "3", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Contrasting spatial patterns of taxonomic and functional richness offer insights into potential loss of ecosystem services", "authors": [{"first": "G", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Cumming", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["F"], "last": "Child", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2009, "venue": "Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci", "volume": "364", "issn": "", "pages": "1683--1692", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Infectious diseases of humans: dynamics and control", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Anderson", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["M"], "last": "May", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1991, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Causal inference in disease ecology: investigating ecological drivers of disease emergence", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": ["K"], "last": "Plowright", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Sokolow", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Gorman", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": [], "last": "Daszak", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Foley", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2008, "venue": "Front Ecol Environ", "volume": "6", "issn": "", "pages": "420--429", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Experimental infection of North American birds with the New York 1999 strain of West Nile virus", "authors": [{"first": "N", "middle": [], "last": "Komar", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Langevin", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Hinten", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "N", "middle": [], "last": "Nemeth", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": [], "last": "Edwards", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Hettler", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Davis", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Bowen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Bunning", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "Emerg Infect Dis", "volume": "9", "issn": "", "pages": "311--322", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "The ecology of infectious disease: Effects of host diversity and community composition on Lyme disease risk", "authors": [{"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Logiudice", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Ostfeld", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Schmidt", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "F", "middle": [], "last": "Keesing", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "volume": "100", "issn": "", "pages": "567--571", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF7": {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "Epidemiological Interaction at the Wildlife/Livestock/Human Interface: Can We Anticipate Emerging Infectious Diseases in Their Hotspots?
