Solid evidence is accumulating to support these applications.

However, the role of NPPV for most non-COPD causes of respiratory failure remains controversial.",

Wysocki et al. [3] observed a number of years ago that patients with non-COPD causes of acute respiratory failure did poorly with NPPV unless they had hypercapnia as well. More recently, however, a randomized controlled trial by Antonelli et al. [4] reported rapid improvement in oxygenation, reduced need for intubation, fewer infectious complications, shortened lengths of ICU stay, and lower mortality among non-hypercapnic patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. A problem with these studies is that the diagnostic category of \u00aahypoxemic respiratory failure\u00ba is too broad to apply to individual patients. Consequently, more recent studies have focused on some of the individual diagnoses within the larger category.",

Lacking a control group, the authors cannot know how their patients would have fared had they been managed without NPPV. It is not surprising that the patients who required intubation had worse outcomes; every NPPV study published to date has made the same observation.

In addition, the exclusion of COPD patients from the Jolliet study undoubtedly predisposed to a higher intubation rate. On the other hand, the patients with pneumonia and underlying COPD are not the ones in question. Evidence supports the use of NPPV in patients with COPD whether or not they have pneumonia; it is pneumonia patients without COPD, such as those in the Jolliet study, for whom more supportive evidence is needed. Unfortunately, lacking randomized controls, it can only be concluded from the Jolliet study that the need for intubation was extraordinarily high, even among patients who responded favorably initially, and it is unclear that other outcomes were improved by NPPV.",

Pending properly designed trials, it is difficult to conclude on the basis of current evidence that a trial of NPPV is \u00aaroutinely\u00ba warranted, at least in most of these patients. However, a cautious trial could be undertaken in patients who have a higher likelihood of succeeding, i.e., those who are younger and less hypoxemic than the average patient in the Jolliet study. Patients undergoing a trial should be observed closely and intubated without delay if their gas exchange defect or respiratory distress worsens within a few hours of initiation.",
