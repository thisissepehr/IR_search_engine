Mathematical outbreak models require assumptions about contact rates and patterns among students, but the level of temporal granularity required to produce reliable results is unclear. We collected objective contact data from students aged 5-14 at an elementary school and middle school in the state of Utah, USA, and paired those data with a novel, data-based model of influenza transmission in schools. Our simulations produced within-school transmission averages consistent with published estimates. We compared simulated outbreaks over the full resolution dynamic network with simulations on networks with averaged representations of contact timing and duration. For both schools, averaging the timing of contacts over one or two school days caused average outbreak sizes to increase by 1-8%. Averaging both contact timing and pairwise contact durations caused average outbreak sizes to increase by 10% at the middle school and 72% at the elementary school. Averaging contact durations separately across within-class and between-class contacts reduced the increase for the elementary school to 5%.

This contributed to causing transmissions to occur earlier in the school day in S1 simulations (figure 3b). We then used the Mid1, S1 simulation results to plot the expected number of transmissions from initially infected individuals against their own time of infection. Being infected earlier in the school day tended to increase one's probability of infecting others on subsequent days (figure 3c), an effect which holds for every individual day except Friday (figure 3d), because an individual infected on Friday was expected to be past peak infectiousness by the time school returned on Monday. The effect of the day of infection (Monday-Friday) on within-school transmission potential was due to the weekend overlapping with the peak infectiousness of students acquiring infection later in the week, and not due to differences in observed contact patterns on different days of the week. This kind of weekend effect has been shown to play a role in shaping incidence curves during observed influenza outbreaks [35] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1529, "end": 1533, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Dynamic versus static"}, {"text": "The 2 day averaging window of version S2 began to overlap with the distribution of serial intervals (electronic supplementary material, figure S1), the time between infection of and subsequent transmission from an individual.

R 0 values from transmission simulations across four different contact networks, using influenza transmissibility and disease progression time course assumptions derived entirely from data.

Comparison of transmission simulations results by assumed network.

It also can be easily calibrated by adjusting a single parameter for transmissibility. We did so by doubling this value to produce new sets of simulated outbreaks with R 0 . 1 (1.5 and 1.1 for Mid1 and Elem1), which more often consist of larger outbreaks with several generations of transmission and are still reasonable assumptions for a novel strain of influenza with uncertain transmissibility characteristics.

The homogeneous durations were then calculated to determine which duration, if applied to every edge, would produce the correct average probability. These homogeneous durations are not equal to the average contact durations, because the relationship between contact duration and transmission probability is nonlinear. For Elem1, the within-group probabilities and associated durations are substantially larger than those between groups and overall.", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>school\n</td><td>edge category\n</td><td>average transmission probability per edge\n</td><td>homogeneous duration (min per day)\n</td></tr><tr><td>Mid1 </td><td>all </td><td>0.00759 </td><td>1.69\n</td></tr><tr><td>Elem1 </td><td>all </td><td>0.0114 </td><td>2.54\n</td></tr><tr><td>Elem1 </td><td>within grade </td><td>0.0262 </td><td>5.94\n</td></tr><tr><td>Elem1 </td><td>between grade </td><td>0.00170 </td><td>0.37\n</td></tr><tr><td>Elem1 </td><td>within class </td><td>0.0555 </td><td>13.02\n</td></tr><tr><td>Elem1 </td><td>between class </td><td>0.00262 </td><td>0.58\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "Acknowledgements.
