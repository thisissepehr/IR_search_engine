Kazuhiro Abe from Nagoya University, who talked about the transport mechanism of the gastric proton pump, H + ,K + -ATPase, which is responsible for acidifying the gastric juice up to pH 1 and thus an important drug target for treating gastric acid-related diseases. Prof. Abe and his colleagues have solved the crystal structures of the H + ,K + -ATPase in two different conformations (Abe et al. 2018) . In his talk, he presented these cryo-EM structures and discussed the reasons why the pump is able to fulfill the requirements for the generation of a million-fold proton gradient across the membrane. The last speaker was Prof. Hui-Chih Hung from National Chung-Hsing University, who talked about p53 function regulated by PAD4 through protein citrullination. Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4)-catalyzed citrullination has been shown to play an emerging role as a potential cancer therapeutic target (Liu et al. 2017) . Prof. Hung and her group have elucidated that p53 protein can be citrullinated by PAD4 in vitro and in the cell. Structural and functional analysis demonstrated that citrullination has detrimental effects on p53 tetramerization and thus impairs their DNA-binding ability. In her talk, she presented direct evidence of the PAD4-p53 interaction and proposed a potential mechanism of how PAD4 involves in p53 target gene regulation by citrullinating p53.",

The V1 and Vo parts are connected by a central stalk, which is composed of D, F, and d subunits, and two peripheral stalks, which are composed of E and G subunits of V1. ATP hydrolysis induces the rotation of the central stalk (DFd complex) and an attached c ring, which causes ion pumping at the interface between the c ring and a subunit",
