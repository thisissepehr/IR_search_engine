            "text": "Inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. A biological target with regard to the treatment of obesity is the inhibition of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC). ACC is responsible for converting acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA, a step that is vital in fatty acid synthesis. Two isoforms of ACC, ACC1 and ACC2, have been identified in mammals. Acetyl-CoA is metabolized via the citric acid cycle if it is not converted into malonyl-CoA. ACC1 and ACC2 are highly expressed in the liver where fatty acid synthesis and oxidation are important. ACC2, the isoform predominantly present in heart and skeletal tissues, regulates the amount of fatty acid used in \u03b2-oxidation by inhibiting carnitine palmitoyl transferase. Inhibition of both isoforms would decrease the synthesis of new fatty acids and deplete the use of fatty acids stored, thereby resulting in weight loss. 4 Additionally, ACC inhibitors may be used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. 5 ACC inhibition is expected to impact both skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity by rebalancing lipid metabolism associated with insulin resistance pathogenesis. Menhaji-Klotz and coworkers at Pfizer Inc. synthesized many 1,9-diazaspiro [5.5] undecan-2-ones containing a pyrazole ring fused to positions 3 and 4 in two different ways to achieve this ACC inhibition. 5 IC 50 values for ACC inhibition of 67 and 174 nM were measured for compounds 1a and 2, respectively (Fig. 4) . Part of the same group synthesized a library of 125 3,4-pyrazole-fused 1,9-diazaspiro [5.5] undecan-2-ones (compounds 1b-o as representative examples) and tested them for IC 50 values on human recombinant ACC1 and ACC2. The smallest IC 50 for ACC1 and ACC2 found were 3.4 and 1.0 nM, respectively, both exhibited by compound 1b (Fig. 4) . 4 A general trend in dual ACC1/ACC2 inhibition was often encountered among the 125 compounds tested: good ACC1 inhibition was linked to good ACC2 inhibition. 4 The same group elaborated on this study by examining the structure-activity relationship (SAR) for the pyrazole part and the substitution at position 9 of the 1,9-diazaspiro [5.5] undecane. In this study, additional pharmacokinetics were studied along with the IC 50 values for ACC1 and ACC2, such as the lipophilic ligand efficiency (LipE), measured lipophilicity (ElogD), human liver microsomal incubation (HLM), and passive permeability (Papp) in Ralph Russ canine kidney cells. 6 1,9-Diazaspiro [5.5] undecan-2-one 1c (Fig. 4) was selected for a SAR study of the effects of modifying the 3,4-pyrazole-fused moiety. Herein it was found that decreasing the bulk of the substituent at N-2 atom of the pyrazole ring (with respect to t-Bu group) similarly decreased ACC1/ACC2 inhibition. Increasing the bulkiness of this group (tert-pentyl) improved the IC 50 values for both ACC1 and ACC2, but also resulted in an increase in HLM by a factor of 4, which outweighed the small inhibitory advantage. Introducing substitution at the N-1 atom did improve the Papp values, but resulted in too much loss of ACC inhibition. Therefore, the tert-butyl-substituted pyrazole-fused core was used for the further studies.",

            "text": "The SAR with regard to substitution at position 9 of the 1,9-diazaspiro [5.5] undecane core was determined for aroyl substituents containing a bicyclic fused heteroaryl group. Comparisons were made with compound 1c. Compounds 1d,e showed similar ACC inhibition, HLM clearance, and LipE, but only modest improvement of Papp. Compounds 1f,g showed improved Papp, and good ACC inhibition, but LipE values lowered along with higher HLM clearance. The very good ACC1 and ACC2 IC 50 values of compound 1g (7 and 3 nM, respectively) were matched by compound 1h (11 and 5 nM, respectively). Compound 1h was designed on results obtained from compounds 1f,g in the hope of showing a better LipE value, which it did. The downside was the poor Papp value obtained for compound 1h when compared to compound 1g. Compound 1i showed reasonable LipE values and diminished ACC inhibition (74 and 29 nM for ACC1 and ACC2, respectively), but a greatly increased Papp value of 9.7 (\u00d710 -6 cm/s) vs 0.8 for compound 1h. Based on these results, a further SAR study was performed by using isoquinolines and quinolines as . Compounds used for studying the SAR for ACC inhibition with respect to the substitution at position 9 of the 1,9-diazaspiro- [5.5] The Papp values of compounds 1n,o were still lower than those obtained for compounds 1j,k and, in addition, HLM clearance significantly worsened. Compounds 1j,k were chosen for in vivo examination of their pharmacological properties. Compound 1j showed the best pharmacokinetics with an oral bioavailability of 71%, c max 403 ng/ml, AUC 2070 ng\u00b7h/l when administered to rats at 5 mg/kg. An intravenous dose of 1 mg/kg in rats demonstrated a moderate systemic clearance of 29 ml/(min\u00b7kg) and volume of distribution of 1.7 l/kg. Similarly, compound 1k showed lower bioavailability and better clearance and volume of distribution than compound 1j. Different oral dosages of compound 1j were administered to rats in combination with 14 C-labeled acetate precursors of lipids. The conversion of these acetate precursors into their respective lipid products for different dosages is shown in Figure 5 . 6 It became clear from these results that compound 1j could be very effective in decreasing new fatty acid synthesis and, therefore, in treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In a different study performed by Pfizer Inc., ACC inhibitors were explored to treat acne vulgaris. 7 Acne vulgaris is a skin disease caused by increased sebum secretion and manifests when hair follicles become clogged with oil and dead skin cells. 8 Increased production of sebum is linked to both the onset and severity of acne. 9 In addition, 80% of sebum content is made through de novo fatty acid synthesis, which is greatly dependent on ACC. 10 Treatment of humans with an ACC inhibitor may reduce sebum triglyceride content by 66%. 7 In the study carried out by Pfizer Inc., compound 1k showed ACC inhibitor activity. For this compound, human ACC1/ACC2 (hACC1/hACC2) and sebocyte inhibition were measured in a transcreener assay and ACC1/ACC2 inhibition was also determined in a radiometric assay. IC 50 values for the transcreener assay were 14 and 3 nM for hACC1 and hACC2, respectively, and 94 nM for C9302E sebocytes. Only 2 out of 24 compounds from the same study showed better IC 50 values than compound 1k for hACC1/hACC2 inhibition and only one of these also improved on the IC 50 value for the sebocytes. These two compounds had a 4-azaspiro[5.5]undecane core structure (similar to that of 1,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecane with the nitrogen at position 1 replaced by carbon). For the radiometric assay of compound 1k, the IC 50 values obtained were 11 and 4 nM for hACC-1/hACC-2, respectively; values that were in the highest order along with six other compounds. 7 Further in vivo testing was not performed with compound 1k, but its effectiveness as ACC1/ACC2 dual inhibitor is apparent.",

Another study, developed by Poindexter et al., showed that 4,5-benzene-fused 1,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecanes 3a-n ( Fig. 6 ) presented antagonistic activity against neuropeptide Y (NPY). 11 NPY is a 36-amino acid neuropeptide that was found to be one of the most important regulators of feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. NPY is most abundant in the brain and has a high expression in the hypothalamus. 12 Furthermore, NPY is expressed in the spinal cord and most sympathetic nerve fibers, especially around blood vessels. Antagonism of the NPY receptors (NPY Y 1 -Y 5 ) has been related to reduced food-intake in mammals, 11 making NDY antagonists drug candidates for the treatment of obesity. Various studies with mice have shown that especially the NPY Y 1 and NPY Y 5 are important targets for treating obesity. 13 The treatment of obesity by NPY Y 5 antagonism works in two ways. Firstly, it was found that food consumption was lowered by 10% in diet-induced obese mice. Secondly, the chronic treatment with NPY Y 5 antagonists inhibited the reduction of the metabolic rate. This indicated that NPY Y 5 antagonists could be used to prevent decrease in energy expenditure due to dieting or other anti-obesity treatments. 2 It was also shown that the combination of food restriction and administration of an NPY Y 5 antagonist was more successful in giving weight loss than either treatment alone. 2 In developing an approach to treat obesity, it was herein suggested that combination of an NPY Y 5 antagonist and an anti-obesity drug would be effective in treating humans. 2 Furthermore NPY Y 5 antagonism was demonstrated by compounds containing the 1,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecane structural moiety. 2 Characterization of the bioactivity was performed by employing insect cells (BRI-TN-5BI-4) infected with NPY Y 5 -recombinant Baculovirus. The radioligand used was iodine-125 labeled PYY ligand. Herein the IC 50 values of compounds 3a-n were less than 10 \u03bcM, with compounds having an IC 50 of less than 500 nM or less than 100 nM. 11 The results of this binding assay showed that these compounds may be used in treatment of disorders that are characterized by an excess of NPY, including cardiovascular diseases, renal system disorders, cerebral diseases, conditions of pain or nociception, abnormal food intake disorders, inflammation disorders, sleep disturbance, and diabetes. When it comes to the treatment of obesity, compounds 3a-n are expected to have an effective dose in the range of 0.05-1 mg/kg bodyweight if administered parenterally, and of 1-20 mg/kg bodyweight if administered orally.",

MCH mRNA was overexpressed in the hypothalamus of diet-induced obese rats and mice, as well as in leptindeficient ob/ob mice, fasting leptin-deficient ob/ob mice and their control mice, and in leptin-resistant fa/fa Zucker rats. 21 In addition, MCH-R1-knockout mice are lean, hypophagic, hyperactive, have increased metabolic rate and reduced fat mass, and are resistant to diet-induced obesity. 23 MCH also increases the release of NPY, a contributor to feeding behavior as mentioned earlier. 21 This means that inhibition of MCH production or of its MCH-R1 receptor could have direct and indirect effects resulting in treatment of obesity.",

            "text": "Orexin antagonism. The family of diazaspiro[5.5]undecanes, including the 1,9-diazaspiroundecanes, was also used to develop orexin antagonists. Orexins A and B, also known as hypocretins, are small neuropeptides that are produced in discrete neurons of the lateral hypothalamus and that bind to G-protein-coupled receptors. Orexins are recognized as important targets for treating sleep disorders 24 (e.g., narcolepsy and insomnia) and are also considered vital in regulating feeding, metabolism, and energy homeostasis. 25 Orexins may also be involved in psychiatric/neurological disorders like Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, Tourette syndrome, and epilepsy, as well as involvement in cardiovascular diseases, heart and lung diseases, and multiple sorts of pain. 26 In the treatment of sleep disorders, antagonists for both orexin receptors (OX 1 R and OX 2 R) were developed based on the 1,9-and 2,9-diazaspiro [5.5] undecane cores. 27 The aim of this research performed by Hoyer and coworkers was to develop a dual antagonist against OX 1 R and OX 2 R, as well as a selective OX 2 R antagonist to distinguish the effects of both receptors on sleep behavior. The SAR was studied for a number of structures 6a-f with respect to both substitution at positions 1 and 9 ( Fig. 9 ). comorbidities like depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Existing pain therapies, which use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioid agents, calcium channel blockers, and antidepressants, exhibit limited efficacy and a range of side effects, limiting their usefulness in chronic pain treatment. In addition, pain is often multimodal, making the use of monomodal treatment not able to relieve all of the pain. The multimodal activity of the compounds containing the 1,9-diazaspiro [5.5] undecane core against multiple receptors associated with pain or side effects related to pain could make this class of compounds of high interest in new treatments of pain.",

            "text": "The most effective compounds in suppressing pain are the opioids (e.g., morphine), mainly through their activation of the \u03bc opioid receptor. The side effects associated with the use of opioids are also the most severe and can include derangement, hallucination, nausea, constipation, respiratory depression, and addiction. 29, 30 In addition, opioids have not proven useful in the treatment of chronic pain, as demonstrated by morphine. Morphine has only a limited effectiveness against chronic pain of neuropathic or inflammatory origin, opposed to greatly diminishing acute pain. Furthermore a tolerance for morphine is built up in the body, which leads to an increase of dosage to maintain the same pain-suppressing effects. Weaker opioid analgesics, like pentazocine, are less effective at suppressing strong pain and display the same side effects, albeit less intense. 31 Some of the mentioned side effects are associated with an activation of the dopamine D2 receptors. 32 Antagonistic activity against the dopamine D2 receptor has also been linked to reducing the addictive effect of opioid analgetics. 32 Therefore, the possible combination of \u03bc opioid and dopamine D2 antagonistic activity may lead to development of new pain-control agents with reduced or suppressed side effects. 32 Studies with mice have also shown that \u03c3 1 receptor antagonism may also relieve neuropathic pain and address some comorbidities (e.g., anhedonia, a core symptom in depression) related to pain states. 30 The K i values, for both the \u03c3 1 and \u03bc receptors, were determined for compounds 7a-d in a study developed by Virgili-Bernado et al. 33 (Fig. 10 ). Compounds 7b-d showed good dual \u03c3 1 /\u03bc inhibition with K i for both receptors between 100 and 500 nM. Of the compounds with a core of closely related 4-oxa-1,9-diazaspiro [5.5] undecanes, 48 derivatives were tested of which only compounds 7e-g performed better than compounds 7b-d with K i values for both receptors lower than 100 nM. Compound 6a was taken as a starting point. Introduction of small substituents (e.g., methyl groups) on the benzyl group led to compound 6b, which exhibited a more than tenfold increase in inhibition of both OX 1 R and OX 2 R. The lipophilicity of compound 6b was, however, too high and substitution with monoaryl groups (e.g., pyridines) resulted in loss of inhibition potency. The introduction of bicyclicfused aryl substituents led to compounds 6c,d, which showed a similar increase in inhibition for both OX 1 R and OX 2 R, whilst also favorably reducing the lipophilicity. The SAR study was then carried out for substitution at position 9. When testing compounds 6d-f, it was observed that OX 2 R inhibition was maintained in a high range, whereas OX 1 R values greatly varied, leading to more selective OX 2 R antagonists like compound 6e. For compound 6d, an excellent subnanomolar K i was obtained for OX 2 R (pK i 9.34). When examined in vivo such compounds, containing the 1,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecane core, were found ineffective. A high blood clearance and volume distribution were found (188 ml/(min\u00b7kg) and 3.1 l/kg, respectively), along with poor c max (18 nM), AUC (31 nM\u00b7h) and oral bioavailability (5%). The 2,9-diazaspiro [5.5] undecane performed much better in in vivo testing and it was suggested that poor in vivo performance is directly related to the 1,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecane core. 27 \u03c3, \u03bc, and D2 receptors. The treatment of pain in general has always been important because one out of five adults suffer from pain and one out of ten are diagnosed with chronic pain each year. 28 The incidence of pain is only increasing due to population ageing and is often related to Calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonism. The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide that has two forms in humans: \u03b1-CGRP and \u03b2-CGRP. \u03b1-CGRP plays a central role in migraine pathology, migraine being a disease that affects 12% of the population. 34 CGRP and its receptor are widely expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous system by multiple cell types which are involved in the regulation of inflammatory and nociceptive response. 34, 35 Although the compounds developed with the aim of inhibiting CGRP do not exclusively contain the 1,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecane core, even some measure of CGRP inhibition could be useful. This usefulness might be expressed in a multimodal activity against the CGRP among others, possibly giving rise to the improved effectiveness of the diazaspiro compounds when treating, for example, obesity or (chronic) pain. The usefulness of combining compounds that may inhibit CGRP with one or more other compounds to provide more effective remedy against multiple diseases is also recognized. Proposed is the use of such CGRP inhibitors in conjunction with antimigraine agents, potentiators such as caffeine, anti-emetics, ergot alkaloids, beta-adrenergic antagonists, interleukin inhibitors, and gap junction inhibitors. 35 An attempt developed by Chaturvedula and coworkers at finding structures that would effectively inhibit the CGRP receptor focused on many spiro compounds, including the 4,5-benzene-fused 1,9-diazaspiro [5.5] undecan-2-one 8a (Fig. 11 ). 36 IC 50 and EC 50 values of 29 and 15 nM, respectively, were obtained for this compound. The closely related structure 8b, a 4,5-benzene-fused 1,3,9-triazaspiro derivative, gave an even better result in the same study with IC 50 and EC 50 values of 5 and 3 nM, respectively. 36, 36 system, neurogenic inflammation, and smooth muscle contraction. Since an NK1 antagonist may inhibit the binding of substance P to NK1, administration of an NK1 antagonist may prove useful in treatment of these diseases. 38 SR140333, a known inhibitor of NK1 (Fig. 12 ), was examined and had an IC 50 of 0.31 nM for binding NK1. 38 Figure 11 .

[41] [42] [43] [44] [45] Although the cited works were not mainly concerned with the 1,9-diazaspiro [5.5] undecane core, two of such structures (Fig. 14) were examined in their role as tachykinin antagonist (for NK1 and NK2) in bladder contraction in test animals. 45 Herein it was found that fumarate YM-44778 exhibited high binding affinities of pK i 8.08 and 8.55 for binding NK1 and NK2, respectively, transfected in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1). A related fumarate YM-44781 also exhibited high binding affinity in similar conditions, giving pK i 9.09 and 9.94 for NK1 and NK2, respectively. In drug-induced bladder contraction, antagonism of these contractions was observed after administration of YM-44778 and YM-44781 (IC 50 100 and 27 \u03bcg/kg bodyweight, respectively). It was concluded that YM-44781 was a potent NK2 antagonist and that YM-44778 was a nonselective NK1/NK2 antagonist.",

EC 50 values were determined and were found to be between 1 and 10 \u03bcM for both compounds 11a,b. Several 1,5,9-triazaspiro [5.5] undecanes showed better EC 50 values at below 1 \u03bcM concentrations. Allosteric modulators of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 4. Compounds that modulate metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 4 (mGluR4) by allosteric mechanism may also alter glutamate level or glutamatergic signaling or do so instead of allosteric modulation. Glutamate is an amino acid transmitter in the central nervous system. Glutamate is involved in many physiological functions (e.g., learning, memory, sensory perception, motor control, respiration, cardiovascular function), as well as in neurological and psychiatric diseases, caused by an imbalance in glutamatergic neurotransmission. [47] [48] [49] Inhibition of chemokine receptors CXCR3. Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that are involved in immune system cell signaling. 51 Chemokines are bound by chemokine receptors (e.g., CCR1-CCR9, CXCR1-CXCR5), which are G protein-coupled transmembrane receptors. In particular, the CXCR3 chemokine receptor is activated by three chemokines: IP-10, Mig, and I-TAC. 52 CXCR3 is expressed in the T cells, B cells, and NK cells among others. T cells are known to participate in autoimmune diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, type I diabetes), allergic diseases (e.g., bronchial asthma, transplanted organ rejection) and they generate interfusions in immunologic diseases (e.g., psoriasis). Since CXCR3 is involved in migration and accumulation of T cells, inhibition of CXCR3 by an antagonist could be useful in the treatment of the aforementioned diseases. In addition, CXCR3 is expressed in the neoplasm of a malignant B cell system, making a CXCR3 antagonist effective for carcinomatous immunotherapy, metastasis control in particular. All this would make CXCR3 antagonists useful therapeutic agents in treatment, prevention or suppression of carcinoma diseases (e.g., leukemia, cancer metastasis), metabolism-related diseases (e.g., diabetes), infections or diseases with an infection (e.g., AIDS, SARS), allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases, gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease, colitis ulcerosa), respiratory diseases, and neurologic diseases (e.g., infarct, thrombosis). Compounds 12a,b were tested for CXCR3 inhibition 53 (Fig. 17) . Compound 12b presented better results with an IC 50 value of 1.1 \u03bcM. ",

A main mechanism for regulating cyclic nucleotide signaling is phosphodiesterase-catalyzed cyclic nucleotide catabolism. There are 11 families of PDEs, encoded by 21 genes. 59 Each gene can also yield splice variants, which increases the isozyme diversity. PDE families are functionally distinguished based on cyclic nucleotide substrate specificity, mechanisms of regulation, and sensitivity to inhibitors. PDEs are differentially expressed throughout the organism. Depending on the function and localization of the different PDE isozymes, they may serve distinctly in different physiological functions. These functions may mean that selective inhibition of a particular PDE family could result in selective treatment of disorders, possibly with fewer side effects.",

In order to be a successful mimic, a molecule should be able to form a stable radical cation at an ionization potential of 0.45-0.65 V. The 1,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecanes 14a,b were effective at forming such a stable radical cation with redox couples at 0.6 V. A lower amount of these diazaspiro compounds was bound (ca. 25%) to the LDL, which meant that these derivatives were not further examined in this study. Figure 19 .

Further use of the 1,9-diazaspiro [5.5] undecane core can be found as a substituent for other heterocyclic drugs used for treating a variety of disorders. One such disorder is the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 60 A mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at position 790 occurs in about half the patients suffering from this disorder. This T790M mutation replaces a threonine with a methionine. Irreversible inhibition of EGFR T790M kinase was shown to inhibit cell proliferation of cell lines expressing the EGFR T790M mutation and regress tumor volume in mice with EGFR T790M/L858R resistant mutation. To this end, a library of 254 tetrasubstituted pyrazines was developed, one of which contained the diazaspiro moiety (compound 16, Fig. 21 ), but the activity was only reported for selected examples. 61 fatty liver development, insulin resistance, increased fat mass, and abnormal glucose tolerance when fed a high-fat diet. In addition, energy expenditure was accelerated and transplantation of adipose tissue from DGAT1 knockout mice to wild-type mice resistant to obesity induced by a high-fat diet. On the other hand, DGAT1 overexpression in mice resulted in worsening of diabetes mellitus and obesity. These results led to the conclusion that DGAT1 inhibitors could be therapeutic drugs for treatment of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, arteriosclerosis, lipidosis, fatty liver, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and cerebrovascular disease. 65 In a study developed by Liu et al. to treat obesity via the pathway described above, a 1,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecan-2-one moiety was used as substituent on benzimidazole derivatives exemplified by compound 18 (Fig. 23 ). 65 In this study, compound 18 presented an IC 50 In a different study, a library of 3,5-disubstituted 4-(pyridin-3-yl)-1,2,4-triazoles was developed with the aim of finding oxytocin antagonists. This library included three compounds 17a-c ( Fig. 22 ) with the 1,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecan-9-yl group as substituent. 62 Therapeutic use of oxytocin antagonists concentrates also on sexual dysfunctions, particularly premature ejaculation. All the compounds of this study exhibited oxytocin antagonist activity, expressed as a K i value, of less than 1 \u03bcM. 62 Quinoxaline derivatives sometimes containing substitution at the 1,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecane core, could be used as dopamine receptor antagonist, corticosteroid, \u03b22-adregenic agonist, leukotriene modifier, antihistamine, decongestant, antitussive, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The substituted quinoxalines were developed as CRTH 2 inhibitors and can be used for treatment of symptoms and diseases associated with uncontrolled CRTH 2 stimulation, such as the aforementioned. 63 Inhibition of diglyceride acyltransferase. It has been noted that the main cause of obesity is the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TG) in adipose tissue, caused by excessive caloric intake. There are two pathways that synthesize TG: a glycerol pathway in organs and a monoacylglycerol pathway involved in aliphatic acid absorption from the small intestine. The final step in TG synthesis of both these pathways is catalyzed by diglyceride acyltransferases (DGATs). 64 Of the two subtypes, DGAT1 is present in the adipose tissue, the liver, and the small intestine and is involved in lipid absorption in the small intestine, lipid accumulation in the fat cells and in the liver.

Antagonists of H 4 -R or inverse agonists may treat multiple types of pain (e.g., inflammatory pain, chemically induced pain, post-surgery pain, pain from osteoarthritis, and neuropathic pain). In this study, concentration versus response data was analyzed to obtain the compound potency as binding constant (K b ) values for antagonists and inverse agonists and as EC 50 values for partial agonists. All the compounds tested blocked the ability of histamine to increase Ca 2+ concentrations in cells and had K b values between 4 and 1000 nM (not reported for all compounds). One single example of a 1,9-diazaspiro [5.5] undecane derivative (compound 19, Fig. 24 ) was present among them, which contained a [d]-fused pyrimidine ring. 67 Another research looked into developing the histamine H 3 receptor (H 3 -R) inverse agonists. This receptor is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and known to control release of several neurotransmitters (e.g., norepinephrine, serotonin, GABA, dopamine, and acetylcholine). 68 Because of this, it has been suggested that H 3 -R antagonists or inverse agonists could be used to treat disorders related to the central nervous system. In animals antagonism of H 3 -R has been shown to enhance wakefulness, improve attentive and cognitive behaviors, and reduce feeding and body weight. In this study, a substituted urea 20 (Fig. 25) , containing the 4,5-benzene-fused 1,9-diazaspiro- [5.5] undecan-2-one moiety, was examined as one of the possible antagonists. 68 However, compound 20 had an IC 50 value of 783 nM for human H 3 , which was around a 1000fold higher than the best antagonist found in the study.",

Inhibitors of PARP have been demonstrated to prolong the antitumor effects of certain anticancer therapies. PARP inhibitors have also been demonstrated to work in preclinical models of reperfusion injury (stroke, myocardial infection), arthritis, inflammations, and diabetes.

Arrhythmia can occur as complication to cardiac diseases (e.g., myocardial infarction and heart failure) and includes irregular, too fast or too slow heartbeats and may cause a ventricular fibrillation, which could lead to sudden death. 71 Of all the possible antiarrhythmic agents (classes I-V), the class III agents effect potassium levels and selectively prolong the duration of the action potential without a depression of the maximum velocity of the upstroke of the action potential. 72 As such, class III agents are not considered able to cause a myocardial depression or induce arrhythmia like class I agents would be.

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are involved in cell cycle progression. 74 CDK7 is responsible for activation of other CDKs by means of phosphorylation, making it indispensable for any type of cell cycle progression. 75 In particular, CDK7 is a transcription regulator, since it participates in phosphorylation of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II at its carboxy terminal domain. As such, inhibition of CDK7 may be used for treatment of cancer, cardiac hypertrophy, and inhibition of virus replication (e.g., HIV, EBV, HCV).

            "text": "Another specific anticancer approach is the inhibition of MAP kinase signal-integrating kinases (MNKs). One of the functions of MNKs (MNK1 and MNK2) is the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) at serine 209. 77 Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E is dysregulated in cancers (e.g., leukemia, breast and prostate cancer), and its overexpression can cause neoplastic transformation in cells. It is believed that phosphorylation of eIF4E is necessary for its oncogenic activity. Because this phosphorylation is done by MNKs, developing an antagonist for MNKs may prove useful in the treatment of eIF4E dependent cancers. 78 Herein the 1,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecane moiety was used as a substituent attached to a polycyclic aromatic core via position 9 (compounds 26a-c; Fig. 30 ). 78 Compounds 26a-c presented good results in this study inhibiting MNK1 and MNK2 with IC 50 values of <0.1 \u03bcM in all cases. Spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is a protein tyrosine kinase, which is an important mediator for immunoreceptor signaling in Leucine-rich repeat kinase inhibitors. A number of compounds with a 3-(pyridin-4-yl)-1H-indazole core were synthesized and tested for inhibition of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LLRK2). 81 Biochemical in vitro studies have shown that mutant LLRK2 harboring proteins associated with Parkinson's disease have increased kinase activity and decreased GTP hydrolysis. This suggests that LLRK2 inhibitors may block aberrant LLRK2-dependent signaling in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Lewy body dementia). 82 In this study, the IC 50 values for inhibition of LLRK2 were initially tested. A reasonable IC 50 value of 14 nM was found for the 1,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecan-2-one derivative 28 (Fig. 32) . 81 The best IC 50 values were below 0.6 nM. One of the compounds used in this study had a 4,5-benzenefused 1,9-diazaspiro [5.5] undecan-2-one moiety (compound 29; Fig. 33 ). The IC 50 value for compound 29 was good at 31 nM, whereas the best performing compounds had IC 50 values of 10 nM. 83 Depending on what arene-fusion pattern was to be realized a different bond between two of the atoms 1-5 could be formed in the final step of the ring closure, with the exception of the bond between carbons 4 and 5. Substitution at position 9 was sometimes included before ring-closure steps, but in most cases a protected piperidin-4-one was used, allowing derivatization after cyclization. Substitution at position 1 was often included before the final ring-closing step. Besides arene fusion, the most important feature is the presence of a carbonyl at position 2, often found in combination with arene fusion. Substitution on carbons 7, 8, 10, or 11 was rarely found, likely also due to the use of piperidine starting materials that did not contain any such substitution beforehand.",

Compound 32 was then demethylated by the reaction of boron tribromide. Reintroduction of the Boc group (it was undesirably eliminated in the first step), followed by triflation of the phenolic hydroxyl group using PhNTf 2 and subsequent Suzuki coupling 88 with 3-cyanophenylboronic acid yielded the biaryl compound 33. Alkylation of compound 33 at position 1 using methyl 2-bromoacetate afforded acetate 34. Then, acylation of 3,5-dichloroaniline with ester 34 in the presence of NaH in THF gave the corresponding amide. Elimination of the Boc group was achieved by trifluoroacetic acid to afford the free amine at position 9 of CC chemokine receptor type 1 inhibitors. Finally, on the search of CC chemokine receptor type 1 (CCR1) inhibitors, a library of 264 oxepine derivatives was synthesized. Three 4,5-benzene-fused 1,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecanes were attached at position 9 via a propylene linker to two of the oxepine core structures (compounds 30a-f; Fig. 34 ). 85 This library was developed for treating diseases associated with aberrant leukocyte recruitment and/or activation or mediated by chemokines or chemokine receptor function (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis). Inhibition of CCR1 was only determined for selected compounds from the library, excluding those with the diazaspiro substituents. 85 ",

Because of safety concerns with the Curtius reaction on large scale, transformation of compound 45 into compound 46 was optimized in flow. The ring closing reaction to give diazaspiro compound 47 was performed at -42\u00b0C using s-BuLi or t-BuLi in quantitative yield. Further derivatization to synthesize the final ACC inhibitors 1 was performed by Boc deprotection using HCl/dioxane and subsequent amide formation with the corresponding carboxylic acids, propylphosphonic anhydride (T3P), and trimethylamine at room temperature. A similar approach was used to make compound 2 which also showed good ACC inhibition. 5 Another procedure featured a similar synthesis for more ACC inhibitors including different N-pyrazole substitutions, as well as bridging structures (e.g., 8,10-ethano bridge). 4 A different method for the preparation of 3,4-benzenefused 1,9-diazaspiro [5.5] undecanes was developed by Stoyanova et al. This method was used as a one-step procedure with an imine as starting material (instead of a derivative of piperidin-4-one; Scheme 5). 94 Anhydride 48 and ketimine 49 were stirred in 1,2-dichloroethane at room temperature to form diazaspiro compound 50 in excellent yield after filtration and washing with dichloromethane.

The different forms of the 1,9-diazaspiro [5.5] undecane core (1,2-, 2,3-, 3,4-, and 4,5-(hetero)arene-fused and the saturated core structures) have been investigated in a broad range of medicinal applications. As a result, an impressive number of research publications and patents have been published in this field. The vast array of biological properties displayed by this family of compounds opens a door for the development of new therapeutics for a variety of diseases. The synthetic strategies toward these scaffolds are determined by their substitution pattern. It is worth mentioning that most of the synthetic methods start with a 4-substituted piperidine moiety and construct the second piperidine ring from this substitution at position 4. Variable cyclization methods are used for the generation of this spiro linkage, the Pictet-Spengler reaction being the method of choice for the 4,5-arene-fused scaffolds, the most common among these compounds.",
