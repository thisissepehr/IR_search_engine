Parkin translocates from the cytosol to depolarized mitochondria, ubiquitinates outer mitochondrial membrane proteins and induces selective autophagy of the damaged mitochondria (mitophagy). Here, we show that ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15), a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) widely expressed in brain and other organs, opposes Parkin-mediated mitophagy, while a panel of other DUBs and a catalytically inactive version of USP15 do not. Moreover, knockdown of USP15 rescues the mitophagy defect of PD patient fibroblasts with PARK2 mutations and decreased Parkin levels. USP15 does not affect the ubiquitination status of Parkin or Parkin translocation to mitochondria, but counteracts Parkinmediated mitochondrial ubiquitination. Knockdown of the DUB CG8334, the closest homolog of USP15 in Drosophila, largely rescues the mitochondrial and behavioral defects of parkin RNAi flies. These data identify USP15 as an antagonist of Parkin and suggest that USP15 inhibition could be a therapeutic strategy for PD cases caused by reduced Parkin levels.",

The lifetime risk of developing PD is 1.5% (1) . A subset of PD cases are familial. Mutations in PARK2, the gene encoding the cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, are the most frequent cause of autosomal recessive PD, probably through a loss-of-function mechanism (2) . In addition to its role in familial PD, Parkin deficiency may also contribute to the pathogenesis of sporadic PD, as Parkin is progressively inactivated in the aging human brain as a result of posttranslational modifications (3 -6) .",

However, many clinical PARK2 mutations do not completely abolish the E3 ligase activity of Parkin (28) (29) (30) , so that PD patients with PARK2 mutations often have diminished but non-zero Parkin activity levels. We wondered whether USP15 knockdown would promote Parkin function in PARK2 mutant PD patient cells with reduced but non-zero Parkin activity. We used fibroblasts from a PD patient with compound heterozygous PARK2 mutations (c.8_171del/c.535_871del; p.V3EfsX3/ p.G179LfsX) (31) . In protein extracts from control human fibroblasts, Parkin exists as a major 52-kDa full-length species and a minor 42-kDa species that lacks the N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and originates from an internal translation initiation site at codon 80 of the PARK2 gene (32) (Fig. 3A) . Both full-length Parkin and Parkin lacking the UBL domain are capable of inducing mitophagy (25) . In the PARK2 mutant cells, total Parkin protein levels were reduced to 30.3+10.8% of control levels (n \u00bc 3), with complete absence of 52-kDa Parkin and residual expression of the 42-kDa, UBL-lacking Parkin species generated through the internal start site from the c.8_171del mutant allele (Fig. 3A) . In contrast to control fibroblasts, the PARK2 mutant fibroblasts showed little mitochondrial clearance after exposure to CCCP or valinomycin for 48 h (Fig. 3B-E) . Strikingly, however, this mitophagy defect of the PARK2 mutant fibroblasts was rescued by knockdown of USP15 ( Fig. 3F -I). This rescue was reversed by simultaneous RNAi-mediated knockdown of residual Parkin in the mutant fibroblasts (Supplementary Material, Fig. S5H and I).",

To assess whether knockdown of USP15 can also compensate for impaired PINK1 function, we examined fibroblasts from a PD patient with homozygous PINK1 mutations (c.1309 T.G).

We also investigated whether USP15 inhibited the translocation of Parkin from the cytosol to depolarized mitochondria. However, USP15 had no effect on the CCCP-induced translocation of transfected Parkin in HeLa cells ( Fig. 5C and D) . Moreover, subcellular fractionation and western blotting indicated that USP15 did not prevent the CCCP-induced translocation of endogenous Parkin in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5E) . These experiments also showed that a substantial portion of endogenous USP15 in HEK293 cells was present in the mitochondria-enriched fractions in basal conditions (Fig. 5E) , consistent with the immunocytochemical colocalization experiments in neurons (Fig. 4F) ; the amount of USP15 in the mitochondrial fractions did not increase after mitochondrial depolarization (Fig. 5E) .",

An important implication of our data is that inhibition of USP15 may have therapeutic potential for PD cases caused by reduced Parkin levels. Diminished Parkin activity in PD can result from PARK2 mutations (2), but probably also occurs in sporadic forms of PD, as active Parkin becomes progressively depleted in the aging human brain due to oxidative, nitrosative and dopaminergic damage (3 -6) . In PD cases with diminished but non-zero Parkin activity, USP15 inhibition could enable residual Parkin to exert its neuroprotective function more effectively.",

Control 1 was a healthy male born in 1949; control 2 was a healthy female born in 1967; control 3 was a healthy male born in 1944; control 4 was a healthy female born in 1938. The clinical history of the PD patient with compound heterozygous PARK2 mutations, a female born in 1970, has been published (31) . The patient with PINK1 mutations was a female born in 1941 who developed early-onset PD at the age of 38, presenting initially with a right-sided arm and leg tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity. She responded well to levodopa. As the disease progressed, she developed motor fluctuations. Twenty years after disease onset, she required bilateral pallidotomy to treat her severe dyskinesias. She was the eldest of seven children, born to consanguineous parents. She has one other sister who developed PD at the age of 46 years. Her twin brother and sister died in early childhood and another sister and two brothers remain unaffected. PINK1 mutations were identified by DNA extraction from blood using JET Quick Spin Columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (Astral Scientific Australia). The purified DNA was then subjected to a PCR cycle to incorporate the dye labeled terminators (Applied Biosystems, Australia). The PCR conditions were as detailed: 25 cycles at 968C 10 s, 508C 5 s and 608C 4 min. The PCR reactions were then cleaned and final reaction samples were sequenced using an ABI 3730 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Australia). Human fibroblasts were grown in DMEM F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%, Greiner Bio-One), non-essential amino acids (1%) penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ ml) and sodium bicarbonate (0.12%) at 378C in a 5% CO 2 humidified atmosphere.
