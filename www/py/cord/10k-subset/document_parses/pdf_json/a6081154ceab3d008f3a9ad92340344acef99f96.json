Their quality is important for species distribution. The role of cave microclimate as well as other environmental factors influencing the distribution of cave-dwelling species, is poorly known. We tested the significance of cave variables (length, temperature, elevation, occurrence of water) and geographical location for the presence of bats during hibernation and the breeding season in five regions in Romania. To detect species' environmental relationships, we used canonical correspondence analyses for winter bat aggregations and principal components analysis for maternity colonies. We analysed the factors influencing the distribution of bats by using two sets of explanatory variables reflecting cave characteristics and geographical locations. Winter aggregation was divided into three groups: (1) bat species that prefer high temperatures (Rhinolophus euryale, Myotis cappacinii) and hibernate at a low altitude; (2) species ranging from mid-to high elevation and low temperature (Myotis myotis/oxygnathus group); (3) species that hibernate in large, cold cave systems with a constant flow of the water (Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Nyctalus noctula, Barbastella barbastellus). Maternity colonies were divided into those that select either high (rhinolophids) or low temperatures (My. myotis/oxygnathus and Miniopterus schreibersii). The most important factors influencing the distribution of bats are the temperature in caves and their geographical location. This information was combined with IUCN's Red List data as well as with the number of individuals occurring in caves with the aim of identifying the key sites for conservation. The majority of these sites, which also constitute the refuges for vulnerable species, are located in west and south-western Romania. Seven caves provide shelter throughout the year for 122 000 individuals of 14 species.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Bats use caves for hibernation, reproduction, rearing of young and other social events (Kunz, 1982) . In Europe, caves are used regularly or occasionally by 46 bat species (Fauna Europaea, 2004) . One of the most important factors determining the presence of bats in caves is microclimate, both during hibernation (Gaisler, 1970; Harmata, 1973; Kunz, 1982; Speakman & Thomas, 2003) and during reproduction (Racey, Speakman & Swift 1987; Plachter & Plachter, 1988) . Bat species differ in their thermopreferenda and therefore choose different shelters (Nagel & Nagel, 1991) . The microclimate is dependent on the length of the cave, the number of entrances and depth (denivelation -distance between the highest and the deepest place in the cave) as well as the average temperature (Kowalski, 1954) , which in turn is related to latitude, longitude and altitude. The number of bat species using a cave is correlated with its length (Arita, 1996) , density of underground sites in each area (Brunet & Medellin, 2001) and environmental factors, such as geographical location and temperature range (\u0158 eh\u00b4ak, 2006; Ulrich, Sachanowicz & Michalak 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 87, "end": 99, "text": "(Kunz, 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 172, "end": 194, "text": "(Fauna Europaea, 2004)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 314, "end": 329, "text": "(Gaisler, 1970;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 330, "end": 344, "text": "Harmata, 1973;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 345, "end": 356, "text": "Kunz, 1982;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 357, "end": 381, "text": "Speakman & Thomas, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 406, "end": 436, "text": "(Racey, Speakman & Swift 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 437, "end": 463, "text": "Plachter & Plachter, 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 551, "end": 572, "text": "(Nagel & Nagel, 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 780, "end": 796, "text": "(Kowalski, 1954)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 930, "end": 943, "text": "(Arita, 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 988, "end": 1013, "text": "(Brunet & Medellin, 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1093, "end": 1108, "text": "(\u0158 eh\u00b4ak, 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1109, "end": 1145, "text": "Ulrich, Sachanowicz & Michalak 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Romania has a varied landscape with many uplands and mountains, including half the Carpathian range.

Before analysis, log-transformation of data [ln (x+1)] was performed to reduce the influence of extreme values of bat numbers, during both the hibernation and maternity periods. To investigate how the hibernating bat communities changed between regions, we used canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) (ter Braak, 1995; ter Braak & S\u02c7milauer, 2002) . Factors influencing hibernating bats were analysed using two sets of exploratory variables reflecting cave characteristics and geographical locations. Caves were described by four variables: length, temperature, elevation (at the entrance) and presence/absence of water (regular underground stream or lake); geographical location was described by five regions (Apuseni Mountains, Eastern Carpathians, Southern Carpathians, Banat Mountains and Dobrogea Plateau). For maternity colonies, the main gradients of variation were described from principal components analysis (PCA) because environmental data (parameters of caves and regions) were uncorrelated in the CCA analysis (ter Braak, 1995; ter Braak & S\u02c7milauer, 2002) .

The former species were found close to large water reservoirs, and in Romania, they reach the northern border of their distribution (Spitzenberger & von Helversen, 2001) . We identified two important sites in the Danube Valley (Southern Carpathians and Banat Mountains.), both hosting nursery colonies, and another population in Dobrogea. Similar discontinuity is reported in neighbouring southern countries, such as Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece (Han\u00b4ak et al., 2001; Benda et al., 2003; Furman & \u00d6 zg\u00a8ul, 2004) . In winter, only small aggregations of fewer than 10 individuals were found, close to water sources and at a lower altitude in the Danube Valley. Bats probably migrate south and form huge aggregations in Bulgarian caves during wintering (T. Ivanova, pers. comm.). A single large hibernation aggregation of R. euryale in Romania was noticed in Lui Adam Cave with a particularly high temperature during the winter of over 18.0 1C. Thermal conditions of this cave are created by hot springs at 45-55 1C (Decou, Negrea & Negrea 1974) . It seems that the presence of karst is more important for the occurrence of a species. In the entire Balkans, R. euryale is one of the most frequently recorded bats in karstic areas (Krystufek et al., 1992; Benda & Horac\u02c7ek, 1998; Han\u00b4ak et al., 2001) . R. mehelyi also uses warm caves with little temperature fluctuation (Paksuz et al., 2007) . However, the presence of these species is restricted to the Black Sea coast area, with only one known nursery colony, and no known hibernacula.

My. myotis/oxygnathus are the most common species in such roosts in both seasons. These (Pandurska, 1993; Benda et al., 2003) , and for Mi. schreibersii (Benda et al., 2003) . Likewise, also, the temperature within hibernacula for My. myotis (Harmata, 1973) and for Mi. schreibersii (Alcalde & Escala, 2000) is similar. Hibernacula of Mi. schreibersii rarely contain more than a few hundred bats, with one exception: Huda lui Papara cave, which contains large aggregations of up to 33 000 individuals. During the breeding season, both species choose caves with similar microclimates (Rodrigues et al., 2003; Paksuz et al., 2007) , often forming mixed colonies. The fourth group of species are R. hipposideros and R. ferrumequinum, occurring in caves during hibernation, but predominantly using attics during the breeding period. They have similar distribution patterns, but R. hipposideros is less abundant. Hibernaculum temperature is higher for R. hipposideros (Harmata, 1973; Gaisler, 2001 ) than for R. ferrumequinum (Pandurska, 1993) . Both species are widespread, found frequently in caves during the winter months. R. ferrumequinum, one of the most common bat species from Romania, forms the largest known hibernation aggregation of up to 1600 specimens in the Southern Carpathians.

The southwestern karstic regions in Romania have the highest number of bat species (including vulnerable ones) and individuals. Throughout this range, a number of protected areas, national parks and Natura 2000 sites were established. Caves with touristic or scientific value in Romania are often administrated by non-governmental organizations under contract with the Ministry of the Environment. In a few cases, some of these caves are important refuges for bat species. Collaboration between custodians, bat protection societies and environmental protection institutions is crucial at the local and regional level. Often, even when the custodians had approved management plans for caves, they had no financial resources for adequate site protection. Management plans for these areas should include the requirements of bats roosting in caves. These needs should reflect the individual species conservation ecology and the status of the surrounding feeding habitats. Special attention should be paid to those caves that house a very large number of specimens (like Mi. schreibersii) or are the last known refuge for vulnerable species occurring in small numbers (such as R. mehelyi), which are highly sensitive to human disturbance. Similar treatments should be applied to those caves that house Mediterranean species in a small number on the edge of their distribution (R. euryale, My. cappacinii). As a result of direct human pressure, there is a possibility of the disappearance of these species in the mid-term, as was shown by the drastic decline in recent decades of R. mehelyi in Romania. This vulnerable bat formed colonies with 500 individuals in Dobrogea in the middle of the 1970s (\u010c erveny, 1982) , and has shown a rapid decline in recent decades (Grimmberger, 1993; this paper) . Comparing the distributional data for Mi. schreibersii, it is apparent that from 14 colonies or aggregations described in the 1960s (Dumitrescu et al., 1963) , 11 have now disappeared from all regions.
