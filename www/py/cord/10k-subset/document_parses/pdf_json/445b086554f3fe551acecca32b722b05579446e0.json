In this paper, C57BL/6 J mice were intranasally vaccinated with attenuated LI\u0394actAplcB-Rv3875 (\u0394 refers to gene deletion in the bacterial genome) or LI\u0394actAplcB-Rv0129c, the two vaccine candidates that utilize LI as an antigen delivery vector. Bacterial load in the target organs, histological changes in the infected organs, the percentage of specific cytokine-secreting T cells in the lung and spleen, IgG levels in the serum and secretory IgA (SIgA) levles in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were determined at specific days post inoculation (dpi). The results showed that both strains were mainly confined to the lung and were eliminated at 10 dpi. The histological damage caused by the infection in the lung was slight and recovered by day 5. Intranasal vaccination of the mice twice at an interval of 4 weeks notably elicited TB antigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses in the lung and SIgA secretion in the pulmonary mucosa, and significantly enhanced the percentage of double-functional CD8 + t cells (IFN-\u03b3 + TNF-\u03b1 + CD8 + ). To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the used of LI vector vaccines to induce promising lung-localized cellular and humoral immune responses by intranasal vaccination. These data suggest that LI could be a novel and promising live vector to construct an intranasal vaccine against respiratory diseases.",

Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the only licensed vaccine for preventing childhood tuberculous meningitis and military tuberculosis worldwide 1 . However, its efficacy highly varies in adults, ranging from 0% to 80% in different regions 2 . Given that BCG is intradermally delivered, it mainly induces systemic immune responses that depend on T helper type1 (Th1) CD4 + T cell responses 3,4 . Because TB primarily establishes in the lung, vaccines that are capable of inducing respiratory mucosal immunity and pulmonary immune responses will confer better protection against pulmonary TB 5, 6 Listeria monocytogenes (LM) is capable of multiplying in macrophages and thus elicits robust CD4 + and CD8 + T cell-mediated immune responses 7-9 . Over the few past decades, LM has been extensively utilized as a powerful vaccine vector for T cell-mediated immunity, especially for cancer immunotherapy 10-12 . Additionally, LM is a potent inducer of antigen-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) that directly attack intracellular Mice. Six-to eight-week-old female C57BL/6 J mice were purchased from the Animal Centre of Sichuan Province Hospital (Chengdu, China). All mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions throughout the experiments at the Animal Centre of the School of Public Health at Sichuan University. Mouse experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Sichuan University, and the protocols for mouse experiments were approved by this committee as well.",

In this study, we evaluated the biosafety and immunogenicity of intranasal vaccination using two recombinant LI strains, LI\u0394actAplcB-Rv3875 (LI\u0394-Rv3875) and LI\u0394actAplcB-Rv0129c (LI\u0394-Rv0129c) 17 , to verify our hypothesis.

It is not surprising that both strains failed to induce antigen-specific cellular immunity in the spleen because they did not establish a durable infection in the spleen. As we reported previously, when LI invaded the lung via the respiratory tract, the typical infection lesions that resulted seemed isolated and densely packed 18 . This phenomenon can be attributed to the unique feature of ivanolysin O (ILO). ILO expressed by LI has 76~78% homology to listeriolysin O (LLO) 19, 20 , the major virulent protein of LM that functions in lysing the phagosome 21 . However, research has shown that ILO is not as strong as LLO at destroying the double vacuolar membrane, thus resulting in most of the LI being degraded in the phagosome because it is difficult to escape from phagosome to infect adjacent cells 22 . Therefore, LI in the lung is nearly impossible to disseminate to other organs. Furthermore, the LI strain used in this study was attenuated by knocking out the actA and plcB genes, making it more likely to be restricted to the lung tissue. When developing a mucosal vaccine, safety should be the primary concern. There was a report regarding the withdrawal of an inactivated influenza virosome vaccine (NasalFlu) containing an Escherichia coli heat labile toxin adjuvant (ELT) because it caused facial nerve paralysis 23 . This case, together with other similar cases, reminds us of the importance of safety for vaccines. Our results showed that LI\u0394-Rv3875 and LI\u0394-Rv0129c were mostly restricted to the lung and were eliminated at 10 dpi. Additionally, the histological damage in the lungs caused by the strains was slight and recovered by 5 dpi.",

            "text": "The prime-boost immune strategy is considered more effective than single-dose immunization. After the boost, a strong increase in the level of lung cytokines including IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-17A, was observed. IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 orchestrate initial monocyte and granulocyte recruitment and promote the antimicrobial activities of macrophages, which are considered to play critical roles in controlling Mtb infection 24 . IL-17A is mainly produced by Th17 cells that differentiate from CD4 + T cells. It was indicated that mucosal delivery of the tuberculosis vaccine can switch Th1 cells to Th17 cells 25 . Several studies show that IL-17A correlates with protection against TB at an early stage, given that IL-17A is capable of recruiting neutrophils and monocytes to the site of granuloma formation 26, 27 . Intranasal vaccination with BCG triggers Mtb-specific mucosal immune response orchestrated by IL-17A, and thus confers better protection against Mtb challenge 5 . In addition, IL-17-producing CD4 + T cells in the lung are able to increase the production of chemokines to recruit more IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4 + T cells and then restrict bacterial growth after Mtb challenge 26 . Taken together, IL-17 is helpful in controlling TB development. In the current study, the level of specific CD4 + IL-17A in lungs of mice that were primed by the strains was only significantly higher than in na\u00efve mice (Fig. 5e ), but it was strongly enhanced by a subsequent booster. Both strains induced a significantly higher percentage of CD4 + IL-17A than the vector control after boost vaccination (Fig. 6d) , indicating that Mtb-specific CD4 + IL-17A was elicited. Polyfunctional Th1 cells have been suggested to amplify the protection against Mtb infection 28 . Moreover, polyfunctional CD8 + T cells have been proposed as a marker of protective immunity against Mtb 29 . Previous findings indicated that the polyfunctional T cells located in the lung were more effective than those in the spleen in providing protection against Mtb aerosol challenge 30 . Our data showed that both strains generated a high frequency of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 double-positive CD8 T cells in the lung (Fig. 7) . Our results showed that Th1/Th17 and CD8 + T cellular immune responses in the lung were elicited by the recombinant LI strains. Notably, our study suggested that intranasal administration of recombinant LI strains elicited promising pulmonary mucosal SIgA levels but poor IgG levels in the serum. The promising immune response in the pulmonary mucosa was consistent with the observation that the strains were mostly located in the lung after intranasal administration. Other researchers reported similar results. Qiu et al. reported that intranasal vaccination with rLM\u0394actA prfA* induced increased levels of immunogen-specific SIgA at mucosal interfaces but poor systemic IgG 31 . White et al. reported that the anti-vaccinia virus antibody response was not detected in the serum of animals after aerosol vaccination with MVA85A 32 . SIgA is the predominant Ig type in mucosal vaccine immunity. It was demonstrated that IgA-deficient mice were more susceptible to BCG infection 33 . Additionally, the pIgR\u2212/\u2212 mice were more susceptible to mycobacterial infection compared with that of wild-type mice after Mtb infection 34 . These results reflect that SIgA plays an important role in protection against Mtb infection by blocking the entrance of bacilli into the lungs and modulating the pro-inflammatory response against Mtb infection 33 . The notable induction of pulmonary mucosal SIgA levels in this study suggests a promising immunogenicity of such LI-based Mtb delivery systems.",

The lungs were removed and digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase I (Sigma, USA) and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I (Sigma, USA) to harvest lung cell suspensions for cytokine detection. Splenocyte suspensions for cytokine detection were prepared according to a previous study 17 . BAL was collected by making a small incision in the trachea and injecting 1 ml pre-cold phosphate buffer solution (PBS) with an indwelling needle. Then, the BAL supernatant was separated from cells by centrifugation and was frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C for detection of SIgA.",
