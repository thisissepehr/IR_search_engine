Although the earlier study by van Dijk indicates Telehealth is potentially useful for estimating ED visits at the provincial level, only simple cross-correlation was used to measure the strength of the association between calls and visits. No method is proposed to provide an estimate of visits from calls and the callvisit relationship is not examined at the health unit level. The study does not examine the possibility of non-linear relationship between calls and visits. To address this, the performance of five different forecasting methods that use calls to forecast ED visits is compared, including two techniques capable of capturing non-linear relationships between calls and visits.

Due to this limitation and because only one flu season was available to test prediction performance, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about the performance of the various methods or the importance of considering nonlinearity. The use of least-squares to fit coefficients for the models may introduce some bias as the distribution of visit counts may be more Poisson than Gaussian and this may have degraded predictive performance. However, the error introduced by this assumption is likely negligible compared to the error due to unexplained variation. An important assumption made in developing the forecasting models was that the Telehealth calls-ED visits relationship does not change over time: we built a predictive model using approximately the first year of data and then tested it over the second year of data. However, since calling behaviours could change over time, for example in response to factors such as season and promotion of the Telehealth service, this assumption could have been violated. Since data confirming past visits is not available in real-time, models cannot be updated on an ongoing basis. Collection of real-time data through syndromic surveillance systems may address this limitation in the future. It was not possible to account for individuals who made calls in one area but sought care in another. This might have influenced results where geographic boundaries separate a large population from the centre of care used by this population.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The fact that accuracy of ED visit prediction using Telehealth is better for larger health units might be explained by the fact that call-to-visits ratios are much higher for health units with larger populations (correlation coefficient 0.70, p<0.001). The call-to-visits ratio is simply a measure of the number of calls, adjusted for the number of visits. It might be expected that more calls provide more information that allows the number of visits to be predicted. The fact that non-linear methods show improved performance relative to regression only over health units with larger population might also be explained considering the call-to-visits ratio as non-linear methods may provide benefit only when richer call data are available.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Since the first terms selected by FOS included three to four linear terms of the eight terms in the model, it is not surprising that the non-linear methods provided only limited improvements in prediction accuracy. The FOS method works by adding terms one at a time to the model from a pool of candidates, consisting of a set of all possible predictors and their powers and cross-products, on the basis of how much they reduce error in the model accuracy over the training data. An advantage of the FOS method over normal regression is that it can search for terms in the model including power and cross-product (interaction) predictor terms much more quickly than forward, backward, or step-wise selection with regression. The number of candidate predictor variables can be large in time series analysis when the influence of these predictors at multiple lags is considered. For example, the FOS algorithm we used was able to search 28,392 candidates to generate an eight-term model in approximately 17 seconds using a standard laptop com-puter. It should be noted that PCI and FOS performance was better than regression for health units with populations of more than 400,000 (p<0.0001) over both the training and the validation data. Model performance can degrade if over-fitting occurs on the training data, and therefore performance should be examined over both training and validation data when comparing methods.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "It is not surprising that the EWMA and State-Space methods perform worse than the regression, FOS and PCI methods since these methods explicitly (EWMA) or implicitly (state-space -through the use of state variables) use value of past estimates to produce future estimates. Inaccuracies in past predictions can accumulate to impact future predictions. Performance of these methods might be improved should the actual number of past ED visits be available. In this case, FOS could also be augmented to include terms with past ED visits. Finally, the practical difference in the predictions made using different methods should be considered in addition to the statistical significance of the difference in their accuracy in the context of the intended application.
