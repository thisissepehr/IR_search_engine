            "text": "Chromosomal-scaffolding proteins exert DNA structural functions during mitosis, and gene regulatory functions such as RNA splicing/polymerization and DNA replication in interphase, allowing the progression of the cell cycle. Recently, it has been reported that topoisomerases play a key role in DNA repair, suggesting an additional regulatory mechanism of the chromosome structure on DNA metabolism and cell cycle checkpoints. Despite the progress made toward the understanding of the genome organization and expression, few changes have been reported in the chromosome scaffold of malignant cells associated with the cancer phenotype. In a previous work, we reported LFM-1 protein (Licensing Factor Model-1) as a chromosomal-scaffold component transiently associated with mitotic chromosomes in MDCK (Madin Darby canine kidney) epithelial cells (Vega-Salas and Salas 1996) . In this work, we explore LFM-1 expression in human epithelia with contrasting tumorigenicity during the progression of the cell cycle. Although cell metabolic labeling shows synthesis of a common 87-kDa LFM-1 precursor during G 2 -phase in both non-tumorigenic and cancer cells, surprisingly, the post-translational LFM-1 chromosomebound polypeptide displays a different apparent molecular weight and binding to chromosomes in the cancer phenotype. The finding of a highly phosphorylated LFM-1 60-kDa form with abnormal binding to chromosomes in human carcinoma cells suggests a structural/regulatory role(s) of the chromosome-scaffold/matrix in DNA metabolism in cancer-related events of cell proliferation.",

Also, a regulatory role in DNA replication has been proposed, and it is reported that the specific binding of MAR/SAR proteins to DNA affects the nearby gene expression (Dijkwel et al. 1986; Gasser et al. 1989; Wright and Shatten 1990; Zlatanova and van Holde 1992; Hamlin 1992; Pernov et al. 1998) .",

            "text": "In a previous paper, we identified a protein bound to mitotic chromosomes in non-tumorigenic canine kidney cells. We named it LFM-1 (Licensing Factor Model-1) by its resemblance to MCM2-7 proteins, a group of molecules with DNA replication licensing activity. We described a LFM-1 58-kDa polypeptide associated with the chromosomal and nuclear fractions in mitosis and G 1 -phase of cell cycle, and also reported its resistance to extraction procedures (3', 5'-diiodosalicylic acid and high ionic strength), a biochemical operational definition for scaffolding/matrix components. In addition, we described the peripheral and axial distribution of the 58-kDa LFM-1 polypeptide on chromatids and the nuclear localization in G 1 nuclei by standard epifluorescence and confocal microscopy. Although analysis of interphase cells revealed the 58-kDa LFM-1-kDa polypeptide included in G 1 nuclei, and a 87-kDa cytoplasmic polypeptide in G 2 -phase cells (Vega-Salas and Salas 1996) , no relationship among these bands was studied. As a preliminary set of data for this study, the chromosomalscaffolding features were explored and confirmed in human epithelial cells. In the present work, we analyze the synthesis, post-translational processing and subcellular localization of LFM-1 chromosomal-scaffold component in human epithelia with contrasting tumorigenicity. Our results support a group of nuclear proteins with transient cellular translocations during the post-translational processing, strong chromosome binding (Gasser et al. 1986; Hennesy et al. 1990 ) and structural/regulatory functions on DNA metabolism (Hernandez-Verdun and Gautier 1994) during cell proliferation events (Stillman et al. 1988; Dohrman et al. 1992; Blow 1993; Coverley et al. 1993; Brazas and Stillman 1993; Madine et al. 1995) . In addition, our findings show an LFM-1 variant with abnormal mass and binding to chromosomes in the cancer phenotype, but, most importantly, they suggest that the reported structural and functional changes in chromosomalscaffold components may be involved in deregulated cell-cycle events of cancer proliferation.",

Cells in G 1 -phase were obtained by incubation in starvation media (DMEM no-isoleucine, 10% dialyzed horse or fetal calf serum, and 2 mM L-glutamine) for ~36-48 h. Cultures in S-phase were achieved by cell-cycle arrest in G 1 /S-phase with 2.5 mM hydroxyurea/aphidicolin as described by Nishimoto et al. (1981) and release in normal media. Alternatively, we used 400 \u00b5M mimosine in DMEM complete media supplemented with 10% heat inactivated serum for ~12 h (Dijkwel et al. 1991) to obtain cells in S-phase. To synchronize cells in G 2 -phase, the cultures were first arrested in G 1 /S and then released from treatment for different times as per the span of cell-cycle phases determined for each cell line. Thus, MCF-10A were released for 3 h (S) and 8 h (G 2 ); or for 2 h (S) and 5 h (G 2 ) in the case of MCF-7 cells. Synchronization in metaphase was achieved by incubation with 0.06 \u00b5g/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for ~17-24 h (Vega-Salas and Salas 1996) . Before synchronization experiments, MCF10A and MCF-7 (~4\u00d710 4 cells/cm 2 ) were grown on either glass coverslips or plastic roller bottles for 24 or 72 h. To improve the sample homogeneity of collected mitotic cells due to the different attachment of each cell line by nocodazol treatment, we included an additional procedural step of vigorous shake-off of MCF-10A cells, and gentle collection of mitotic MCF-7 cells before the experiments. The success of cell synchrony was determined by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) as described below, and by a number of mitotic images observed under the microscope.",

These preparations contained some prophase nuclei that were included in this study (Fig. 1b, c, g, h) . Approximately 90 prophase nuclei per cell line were examined colocalizing DNA (propidium iodide after RNase treatment, red channel) and LFM-1 epitopes (fluorescein, green channel). Consistent with the images from unfractionated cultures (Fig. 1a, f) , confocal tridimensional images displayed LFM-1 epitopes overlapping the condensing chromosomes in localized nuclear peripheral areas in MCF-10A cells. Despite a grossly conserved nuclear fluorescence pattern of LFM-1 in both cell lines, a faint signal in MCF-7 tumor cells was observed (Fig. 1c, h, arrows) , which was further confirmed by the analysis of the confocal sections (Fig. 1b, g) . Since images in b and g are 0.1-\u00b5m confocal sections, the general reduction of LFM-1 epitopes was evident in both the periphery and axis of the chromatids in cancer cells (Fig. 1b) . Consistent with these findings, isolated mitotic chromosomes from MCF-7 carcinoma cells showed a heterogeneous LFM-1 labeling. The fluorescence ranged from bright/undetectable signal (Fig. 1j , big white arrowheads), including a less common configuration of patchy positive areas clearly contrasting with the homogeneous subcellular distribution observed in non-tumorigenic cells (Fig. 1i) . As a conclusion of these studies, LFM-1 protein displays a notorious heterogeneous and decreased chromosome binding to chromosomes in cancer cells (Fig. 1c , h, yellow signal, white arrowheads).",

The nuclei -referred to hereafter as nuclear fractionand the postnuclear supernatant (membrane pellet) (Mirkovich et al. 1984; Gasser and Laemmli 1987) were processed by SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 2A) . The purified nuclear fraction of MCF-10A cells showed a major 58-kDa and secondary 65-and 87-kDa LFM-1 bands (Fig. 2N , asterisk). In contrast, the equivalent Western blot of MCF-7 nuclei displayed a 60-kDa polypeptide (arrowhead) and similar 65-and 87-kDa minor bands. Because LFM-1 signal detected in the nuclear fraction comprised all LFM-1 polypeptides associated with nuclei and chromosomes during a complete cell cycle, we decided to further discriminate the specific LFM-1 polypeptide(s) bound to chromosomes during M-phase. Accordingly, the pattern of bands from the purified chromosome fraction in M-phase was compared with the one in unsynchronized cultures ( Fig. 2A, N, B, Chr) . As a result, mitotic chromosomes of MCF-10A non-tumorigenic cells displayed a defined unique 58-kDa LFM-1 major band (Fig. 2Chr, asterisk) . In contrast, MCF-7 carcinoma cells showed a major 60-kDa LFM-1 polypeptide (Fig. 2Chr, arrowhead) and modest minor 65-and 87-kDa polypeptides. These observations were extended and confirmed in normal and cancer biopsies from human breast, colon, skin and kidney epithelia. A correlated 58-kDa LFM-1 electrophoretic band was obtained from biopsies of normal epithelia in contrast 197 Fig. 2A , B LFM-1 molecular species associated with the nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) fractions (A) and chromosome fraction (B, Chr) in human non-tumorigenic (MCF-10A) and tumorigenic (MCF-7) cells. Unsynchronized cultures (A) were harvested, fractionated, and the nuclear and cytoplasmic pellet processed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. A 58-kDa LFM-1 band is identified in the nuclear fraction of MCF-10A non-tumorigenic cells (*). MCF-7 carcinoma cells instead display a 60-kDa LFM-1 polypeptide (arrowhead). Cells synchronized in M-phase by nocodazol treatment were homogenized and the chromosomes isolated (Chr). The remaining attached cells to the substrate (in interphase) were then scraped and fractionated to obtain the nuclear pellet (N). A major 58-kDa band is the major LFM-1 polypeptide identified in the chromosome (Chr) fraction of MCF-10A non-tumorigenic cells (*), while a 60-kDa band was detected in mitotic chromosomes of MCF-7 carcinoma cells (arrowhead) (arrows 86, 66, and 56 kDa: molecular weight markers) with a 60-kDa polypeptide in carcinomas from several organs.

As a first approach, MCF-10A and MCF-7 cells were synchronized in G 1 -, S-, and G 2 -phases of the cell cycle, metabolically labeled with [ 35 S]methionine/cysteine, immunoprecipitated with LFM-1 MAb and analyzed by autoradiogram.

No additional bands were detected even with longer pulse labeling, and/or film exposure through a complete cell cycle, supporting the idea that the 87-kDa polypeptide is the unique LFM-1 precursor. In addition, quantification of the [ 35 S]-labeling of LFM-1 87-kDa bands was performed in both phenotypes using Image-Quant software.

However, our results strongly suggest it is unlikely. Cell metabolic labeling showed only one LFM-1 precursor during the entire cell-cycle. If other unspecific polypeptides had been recognized by the LFM-1 antibody, it should have resulted in the appearance of additional bands, which was not the case. In addition, experiments of time-course cell labeling displayed an LFM-1 pattern of bands correlating with the one reported in unsynchronized cultures. These results suggest that the 60-and 58-kDa LFM-1 chromosome polypeptides originate from a common 87-kDa LFM-1 precursor by means of cytoplasmic post-translational phosphorylation processing. Most importantly, they show molecular and functional changes in the 60-kDa post-translational polypeptide in cancer cells. In this regard, a correlation has been reported between modest changes in the molecular weight of proteins and their DNA binding ability after post-translational modifications (Luscher and Eisenman 1992) . Often these modifications involve phosphorylation processes that regulate complementary proteolytic cleavages of the polypeptide chain (Reddy et al. 1991) . Currently, we cannot rule out a change in the primary structure of LFM-1 precursor, nor in the post-translational machinery of cancer cells for the abnormal mass and binding to chromosomes in the cancer phenotype.",

One of them, SWI5, shows a comparable cellcycle temporal translocation: it enters into the nucleus in M-phase (the mitosis in yeast is closed), binds to chromosomes in anaphase, remains nuclear during G 1 -phase (exerting regulatory functions at the onset of start) and is degraded afterwards (Blow 1993; Coverley et al. 1993) . SATB1 (specific A-T binding) is a recently reported nuclear-matrix protein (Dickinson et al. 1992; Yanagisawa et al. 1996; de Belle et al. 1998) . Despite some common features with LFM-1 such as binding to MAR/SAR areas of DNA, and a similar apparent molecular weight, there is no significant sequence homology between these proteins.",

Cancer cells in contrast with non-tumorigenic or normal tissues exhibited only one single (mostly unique) 60-kDa LFM-1 band defectively associated with chromosomes. Consistently, LFM-1 subcellular distribution in nuclear peripheral areas of potential telomere segregation, and decreased chromosome labeling observed in cancer cells, suggest a potential dysfunction in cell-cycle-related events. It is suggestive of the telomeric localization of LFM-1 protein and the data in the literature reporting regulatory functions of telomeres and telomerase activity on cell proliferation (Price 1992; Harley 1992; Jacob et al. 2001) . In this regard, other chromosomal-scaffolding components such as RAP-1, a 116-kDa abundant protein with a role in the control of DNA proliferation (Klein et al. 1992) , also termed TUF (Vignais and Sentenac 1989) , and GRF-1 (Shuey and Parker 1986) , have been reported to be mainly bound to telomeric areas. Also, CAP, a chromosomal auxiliary protein with similar chromosome binding to LFM-1, has been reported to play a role in DNA-bending at specific sites during gene regulation in yeast (Liu- Johnson et al. 1986) , activating genes essential for the initiation of DNA replication (Koepsel and Khan 1986) , and preventing telomere-telomere joining and degradation (Bourgain and Katinka 1991) .",

Malignancyrelated two-dimensional gel spots have been described in a variety of human cancers (Keesee et al. 1994; Getzember and Coffey 1991; Kanuja et al. 1993) . Despite these findings not yet having been assessed for specific cancer-related function(s), the study of these polypeptides may open a new avenue in the understanding of cancer biology and its potential treatment as well. The consistent results reported in this work on LFM-1 in a broad range of human malignancies suggest that 60-kDa LFM-1 polypeptide can be involved in malignant cell proliferation events. It is still hard to ascertain whether LFM-1 differences detected in tumor cells play a role in the malignant phenotype or are just a consequence of defective metabolic pathways or regulatory processes in tumor cells. However, the correlation between LFM-1 60-kDa polypeptide and cancer phenotype leads to the possibility of a dysfunction of chromosomematrix components in the deregulated cancer proliferation. Although the 58-kDa/60-kDa polypeptides could be more relevant to tumor biology (in the case of a potential relationship with similar oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes expressed in tumors), the reported changes in the LFM-1 post-translational polypeptide in cancer cells may shed new insights by suggesting unsuspected structural/ regulatory function(s) in the cancer phenotype.",
