It has become pandemic and with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) clubbed under the MS umbrella, millions of people around the globe have come under its grip. Though obesity and T2D are ubiquitous, there exists a pattern of prevalence based on ethnicity. A recent report has identified demographic transitions, nutrition and lifestyle in the backdrop of genetic predisposition as the chief factors responsible for the rising trend of obesity associated amongst South Asians 1 . Over accumulation of visceral adipose tissue (AT) has been identified as one of the major driving factors towards T2D. Adipose tissue is an important regulator of metabolic homeostasis by virtue of the adipokines (pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory) that it secretes. In obese conditions, the fine-tuned balance between the pro-and anti-inflammatory adipokines gets altered leading to various metabolic disorders 2 . These bioactive peptides act locally and distally to calibrate and fine tune various metabolic pathways. Adiponectin is one such calibrator which is abundantly expressed in white adipose tissue 3 . It circulates in three polymorphic forms, low molecular weight (LMW), moderate molecular weight (MMW) and high molecular weight (HMW). Interestingly, the ratio of plasma HMW adiponectin to total adiponectin is more strongly correlated with plasma glucose levels than any of the forms alone 4 . Adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ/ APM1/GBP28) locus, 3q27, has been strongly associated with a variety of metabolic disorders like-impaired glucose tolerance, obesity, dyslipidemia and T2D 5-7 . Studies undertaken on different ethnic groups have shown positive association of certain SNPs of the adiponectin gene with T2D 3,8-11 .

On the contrary, adiponectin 2 , omentin-1 25 , melatonin 26 and vaspin 27 are known to enhance insulin sensitivity. The normal range of total adiponectin in healthy individuals is reported to be 2-20 \u00b5g/mL 28 . The characteristic short stature of South Asians combined with visceral adiposity leads to an increased weight per area distribution defined by body mass index predisposing those to metabolic diseases 1,29-31 . Genome-wide association studies have shown a close association between adiponectin, ADIPOQ SNPs, fasting hyperglycemia and various metabolic diseases though varying from population to population [32] [33] [34] . Earlier studies have shown promoter \u221211377C/G (rs266729) polymorphism to have a positive association with hypoadiponectinemia and risk of developing T2D 35 and is supported by the findings in J&K population. As opposed to this, we found this SNP not to be associated with T2D or BMI in Gujarat population supporting the work by Schaffler et al. who also reported the absence of transcription factor binding sites at or around this SNP site 36 . However, the GG genotype of \u221211377 C/G (rs266729) did show an association with increased serum triglycerides and LDL-c, and reduced HDL-c in females. In spite of not being associated with T2D, possibly an indirect effect of other SNPs could be the reason for the observed altered association of the \u221211377 C/G (rs266729) with the serum lipid levels.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 177, "end": 179, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 191, "end": 193, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 372, "end": 374, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 932, "end": 936, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 937, "end": 941, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 942, "end": 946, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1102, "end": 1104, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1389, "end": 1391, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Adiponectin gene expression in an adipose tissue is regulated by a 34 bp enhancer located in the first intron 37 .

Though the ENCODE data base doesn't show an overlap of this polymorphism with any cREs or display any cREs within 2 kb; eQTL database GTex shows TG and GG genotypes of +10211T/G (rs17846866) to have significantly reduced levels of plasma adiponectin similar to our findings. Additionally, this SNP is also seen to be associated with increased BMI, FBG, TG, TC and reduced HDL-c.

However, the results from J&K population did not reveal any such association. +45T/G (rs2241766) is a synonymous SNP with a codon change from GGT to GGG. Though studies on Chinese Han population found an association between +45T/G (rs2241766) and insulin resistance 38 ; our results show no association between +45T/G (rs2241766) and T2D as supported by studies on Italian, French and Swedish populations 3, 8, 9 . We report a significant association of +276G/T (rs1501299) with T2D, and serum lipid profile in Gujarat population while no association was found in J&K population. Supporting our data from Gujarat population, similar results were obtained in earlier studies in German 39 , Swedish 40 , Italian Caucasian 41 , French Caucasian 3 and South Indian populations 35 . However, the results of the study by Hara et al. 42 in Japanese subjects were in accordance with the results obtained in J&K population. In Gujarat population, the TT genotype conferred approximately double risk for developing T2D against the GG genotype in +276G/T (rs1501299). Furthermore, +276G/T (rs1501299) is also found to be linked with increased BMI, FBG, TG, and TC, and reduced HDL-c in males. These findings also suggest the association of +276G/T (rs1501299) with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), co-morbidity associated with T2D as supported by Wang et al. 43 . Additionally, we have also found increased levels of TNF\u03b1, Free Fatty Acids (FFA) and resistin in obese patients 17, 44 . Since TNF\u03b1 is shown to be an important regulator of adiponectin multimerization 45 , our observations of increased TNF\u03b1, reduced adiponectin transcript and HMW adiponectin levels in obese patients are self-explanatory. We had also reported a rise in IL1\u03b2 levels in obese diabetic patients 46 , asserting the rise in pro-inflammatory adipokine and drop in anti-inflammatory adipokine in obesity-associated low-grade inflammatory condition. Further, adiponectin levels show sexual dimorphism 47 and our results further confirm this as females in general demonstrated a higher tendency of HMW adiponectin/total adiponectin ratio than males. Also, a significant drop in adiponectin ratio of lean diabetic individuals was observed which was further pronounced in obese diabetic patients. Moreover, the overall plasma HMW adiponectin/total adiponectin ratio tends to be lower in subjects with the homozygous mutant allele for +10211T/G (rs17846866) and +276G/T (rs1501299). In concordance with our findings, adiponectin levels were strongly and inversely associated with diabetes risk 48, 49 . Alongside, we had also reported the prevalence of a significantly high number of angiotensin convertase enzyme (ACE) I/D polymorphism in the same population 50 . The ACE D allele has in particular been shown to be associated with increased angiotensin II 51 which may be further adding to the down regulation of adiponectin. We suggest that the reduced HMW adiponectin in particular is responsible for insulin resistance as, among the adiponectin isoforms, the HMW isoform binds to its receptor with maximum affinity leading to a potent activation of 5\u2032 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Thus, the lowered HMW adiponectin may be partly responsible for developing T2D 52 . The increased level of TG may be due to a decrease in the lipoprotein lipase activity and Very Low-Density Lipoprotein receptor (VLDLr) expression levels, which have been proposed to be modulated by adiponectin 53 . While HDL-c levels and their particle size are inversely correlated with the www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ catabolic rate of apolipoprotein (ApoA-I), a direct role of reduced adiponectin with increased catabolism of the major ApoA-I present in HDL-c has been proposed 54 , explaining how hypoadiponectinemia leads to decreased HDL-c levels. The correlation between hypoadiponectinemia and reduced HDL-c levels, as observed by us further strengthens the hypothesis. To summarize, +10211T/G (rs17846866) and +276G/T (rs1501299) are significantly associated with increased FBG, BMI, TG, TC and reduced HMW adiponectin/total adiponectin ratio. More importantly, the haplotype analysis reveals that individuals with GGTG haplotype in particular show an increased tendency towards obesity induced T2D 55 (Fig. 2) . Thus, we may conclude that adiponectin gene is associated with T2D, nonetheless variation in the susceptibility loci within the gene depends on ethnic variation among different populations. However, further investigations to understand the mechanistic aspects of genetic variants regulating adiponectin levels are warranted in other cohorts.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 160, "end": 163, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 164, "end": 166, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 574, "end": 576, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 577, "end": 579, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 580, "end": 581, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 942, "end": 944, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 984, "end": 998, "text": "Hara et al. 42", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1527, "end": 1529, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1645, "end": 1648, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1649, "end": 1651, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1943, "end": 1945, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2733, "end": 2736, "text": "48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2737, "end": 2739, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2899, "end": 2901, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 3412, "end": 3414, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 3628, "end": 3630, "text": "53", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 4465, "end": 4467, "text": "55", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 4468, "end": 4476, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Reprints and permissions information is available at www.nature.com/reprints.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Data availability"}, {"text": "Publisher's note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Data availability"}, {"text": "Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.
