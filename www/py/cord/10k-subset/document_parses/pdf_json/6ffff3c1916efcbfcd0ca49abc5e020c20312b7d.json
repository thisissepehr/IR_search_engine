Outbreaks cannot be predicted and attempts to trace the disease often have severe economic and social consequences [41] . Faced with this threat, many governments around the world have increased their emphasis on pandemic influenza preparedness and started to develop appropriate plans [34, 42] . As pandemic influenza preparation plans begin to be analyzed, one can first refer back to the SARS outbreak that occurred in many countries across Asia in November of 2002. The supplies of medical masks (e.g. N95 masks) rapidly ran out early in the outbreak [12] . The SARS crisis provides a concrete example of how national and international preparation of medical supply stocks is highly complex and incorporates many different elements, ranging from central government leadership decisions to operational instructions and the flow of information [16] . The experience of the SARS outbreak thus has changed the way many in the medical community view and react to the spread of infectious diseases. According to Coker and Mounier-Jack [24] , investment in preparedness and planning with regard to medical supplies should provide benefits that extend beyond simply influenza pandemic control. Therefore, a strategy for the rapid deployment and delivery of essential medical supplies used for the prevention of influenza transmission and to alleviate the public panic caused by the expected shortage of such supplies needs to be developed [35, 43] . Effective logistics management of influenza preparation plans will not only optimize the response to such a catastrophe, but will also limit the effects of the disease in terms of morbidity, mortality, economic loss, and social disturbance [15, 22] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 63, "end": 66, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 67, "end": 70, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 188, "end": 192, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 359, "end": 363, "text": "[34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 364, "end": 367, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 628, "end": 632, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 919, "end": 923, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1110, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1508, "end": 1512, "text": "[35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1513, "end": 1516, "text": "43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1759, "end": 1763, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1764, "end": 1767, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Unfortunately, the necessary stockpiles usually reside in a multitude of disparate, distributed medical supplies among hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies.

Various scenarios are analyzed to derive the appropriate inventory policy needed under different pandemic influenza outbreaks, and to establish a mechanism of evaluating the stockpiles and requirements in the different phases of the pandemic.
