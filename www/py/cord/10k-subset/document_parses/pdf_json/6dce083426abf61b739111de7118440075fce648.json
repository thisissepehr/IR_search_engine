            "text": "It is unknown whether base excision DNA repair (BER) proteins interact with mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) under oxidation. Here, we explored roles of BER proteins in signaling transduction involving MAPK during hyperoxia. We demonstrated that ERK1/2 phosphorylation in A549 cells was increased in 95% O 2 . p38 activity in A549 cells was also increased by exposure to 95% O 2 . To evaluate regulatory roles of MAPK, we have transduced A549 cells and primary alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECII) to overexpress 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (hOgg1). Overexpression of hOgg1 reduced hyperoxic toxicity in A549 and AECII cells. Furthermore, protection by BER against hyperoxia appeared to involve an upregulation of ERK1/2 and downregulation of p38. These observations demonstrate, for the first time, that reduction of hyperoxic toxicity by BER proteins may be involved with MAPK activity, thereby impacting cell survival. Furthermore, our studies suggest that modulation of MAPK may be used in combination with BER proteins to counteract hyperoxic toxicity.",

However, hyperoxia can also cause severe lung toxicity. This toxicity may be induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS), although the molecular mechanism is not fully understood. 1 Metabolite levels of ROS are easily cleared by antioxidants including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidases or lowmolecular-weight vitamins, 2 but high levels of ROS can damage cellular machinery via several mechanisms including lipid peroxidation, 3 enzyme consumption and ultimately DNA damage. Direct cytotoxicity is a major threat to both lung epithelial and endothelial cells, while DNA lesions can also have detrimental consequences due to genotoxicity or mutagenicity. 4 Although chromosomal damage was indicated in hyperoxia samples a few decades ago, 1 our lab is the first to directly demonstrate that hyperoxia causes lung cell DNAstrand breaks. 5 Alveolar epithelial type I cells are thought to be the primary target of hyperoxic damage; [6] [7] [8] however, latest evidence also reveals that hyperoxia induces DNA damage in alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECII). 9 Thus, DNA repair of epithelial cells is critical to the integrity of lung structure and function.",

            "text": "Hyperoxia, like other oxidations, results mainly in damage to bases and to the phosphodiester backbone of DNA, producing the most common adduct, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxo-dG) . The large parts of these nonbulky adducts are repaired by the base excision repair (BER) mechanism, 5,10 with possible participation from nuclear excision repair. 11 DNA glycosylases, of which there are several types, recognize damaged DNA bases and catalyze hydrolytic cleavage of the N-glycosyl bond linking the base to the sugar. A DNA polymerase then fills the resulting gap. Several glycosylases have been identified with the ability to remove oxidative base damage, including thymine glycol DNA glycosylase, hydroxymethyl uracil glycosylase, and 8-oxo-dG DNA glycosylase. 12 The latter function is exerted by the human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (hOgg1), whose specificity for 8-oxo-dG is when formed in situ in DNA and hence paired opposite C. In Escherichia coli, formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg), a functional homologue of Ogg1 removes the 8-oxo-dG. 13 A second 8-oxodG glycosylase, namely hOgg2, has a specificity for 8-oxo-dG when derived from the nucleotide pool and misincorporated opposite G or A. 14 Hyperoxic toxicity involves multiple signaling activities, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms are not completely understood. Several studies in adult mice and cultured cell lines have now shown that hyperoxia increases expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and its phosphorylation on serine 15. [15] [16] [17] [18] It has been shown that p21 deficient cells Cell Death and Differentiation (2006) 13, [311] [312] [313] [314] [315] [316] [317] [318] [319] [320] [321] [322] [323] succumb to severe toxicity under hyperoxic conditions. 19 It is revealed that chemical toxicity may regulate p53 20 or p21, 21 which are associated with altered expression of hOgg1. However, it is unclear whether hyperoxia can regulate or influence BER. A potential signaling pathway that may help connect activation of BER to G2 arrest involves the mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPK).",

Recently, the MAP kinase pathways have been linked to hyperoxic toxicity in both cell cultures and animal models; 24, 25 hyperoxia primarily activates ERK1/2 but less so p38. 25 Buckley et al. have demonstrated that increased ERK1/2 may correlate with protection against hyperoxic toxicity in rats. 24, 26, 27 p38 MAPK is linked to mismatch repair DNA response via the G2 checkpoint and to resistance to chemotherapeutic DNA-methylating agents. 28 The only study relating BER to cell cycle regulators demonstrates the link of long-patch BER to p21 in mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line. 29 It is unclear whether BER pathway is linked to MAPK under hyperoxia. We explored the possibility that MAPK are involved in BER pathway in response to hyperoxic toxicity. Despite carcinoma originality, A549 cells have been widely used as type II-like cells for mechanistic studies of alveolar epithelial physiological properties and signaling pathways. 30, 31 By transducing stable expression of hOgg1 in alveolar epithelial A549 cells with a retroviral vector as described previously, 32 we report here that overexpression of BER DNA repair proteins can afford protection against hyperoxic toxicity. Further, the protective role of BER against hyperoxia appeared to involve an upregulation of ERK1/2 and downregulation of p38. Primary rat type II cells are also used to confirm the role of BER in hyperoxia.",

This increase in 8oxo-dG was further confirmed in nuclear extracts using Western blotting approach by monoclonal antibodies against 8-oxo-dG (Trevigen, Figure 1d ). While the nuclear extracts were evenly loaded by reprobing with GAPDH and BCA assay, the increase of 8-oxo-dG is approximately three-to four-fold compared with the control. Western blotting using antibodies demonstrates compatible results to the HPLC-ECD method, but is more conveniently performed.

In addition, the selected cell clones expressed high levels of hOgg1, but to varying quantities in different clones. As shown in Figure 2a , clone 2 is a representative of total 35 clones overexpressing EGFP. Expression of hOgg1 was demonstrated by Western blotting detection in seven representatives of total 35 clones (Figure 2b ).

Phosphorylated p38 was quantitatively measured using phospho-ATF-2 Thr71 antibody in A549 cells after immunoprecipitation with immobilized phospho-p38 antibodies (Thr180/Tyr182). The results show that hyperoxia induces a seven-fold increase in p38 activity (determined by densitometry) compared to the control by hyperoxic exposure (Figure 3a ). We then examined whether p38 is altered by enhanced expression of BER DNA repair proteins.

The results demonstrate that p38 inhibitor specifically reduced p38 kinase activity ( Figure 3c ). We then examined whether SB202190 and hOgg1 can have added effect on decrease in p38 activity, our data indicate an apparent synergistic effect between hOgg1 and SB202190. To further assess whether the MAPK is specifically upregulated by hyperoxia, we have used several dominant-negative constructs to transfect the lung cells. An example is the transfection of p38 dominant-negative mutant (p38aFA) using liposome Gene-Porter, we have demonstrated a downregulation of p38 activity, resulting in a reduced effect of hyperoxia-stimulated p38 kinase activity ( Figure 3d ). Transfection efficiency with the dominant constructs was approximately 37%, but neomycin selection achieved over 83% cells expressing the inserted constructs by immunohistochemistry (not shown). Importantly, introduction of dominant-negative mutation (p38aAF) resulted in reduction of apoptosis in A549 cells under hyperoxic exposure for 48 h ( Figure 3e ). The result show that the mitochondrial component staining (CMXRos MitoTracker) appeared in the nuclear compartment along with the Annexin-V staining (apoptotic cells), but no Annexin-V staining in the cell expressing p38aAF. The apoptotic cells were enumerated and transfection with p38aAF construct resulted in less apoptosis compared to the vector control (Po0.05). Similarly, we transfected freshly isolated AECII with p38aAF construct, which demonstrates significant protection against hyperoxia compared to the vector control in the primary isolation ( Figure 3f ). The introduction of p38aAF dominant-negative mutant also reduced the p38 activity compared with the vector control as determined by Western blotting (not shown).",

Using ERK1/2 kinase assay, we demonstrate that ERK1/2 activity was increased by two-fold following hyperoxic treatment of A549 cells (Figure 4a ). AECII cells were isolated and identified by tannic acid staining, cytokeratin 18 and surfactant protein-C immunostaining, and hyperoxia induced approximately two-(48 h) to three-fold (24 h) upregulation in ERK1/2 in primary AECII cells ( Figure 4b ). The data suggest an upregulation of ERK1/2 pathway in both alveolar cell line A549 and primary alveolar cells under a natural response to hyperoxia. Comparing ERK1/2 activity between A549 and AECII cells, the results demonstrate that there was more significant increase of ERK1/2 in A549 cells than that in AECII cells.",

Levels of hOgg1 overexpression were compared in transduced A549 and AECII cells, and the results suggest that A549 cells expressed approximately two-fold hOgg1 than that of AECII cells. We also show that overexpression of hOgg1 markedly induced the activation of ERK1/2 (15-fold against the control, Figure 4c ). Protein loading was controlled using Bio-Rad or BCA protein assay and also normalized by total ERK1/2 proteins. Furthermore, A549 cells overexpressing hOgg1 were associated with decreased hyperoxic toxicity and increased cell survival against vector control cells as determined by a trypan blue exclusion assay (Po0.05, Figure 4f ). We also confirmed the results using the MTT assay showing that proliferation was increased by hOgg1 (not shown). This is consistent with a previous study that demonstrated the protective role of ERK1/2 against hyperoxia. 26 To further confirm the above observations, we used the ERK inhibitor PD98059 to test hyperoxic regulation of ERK1/2 activity. The addition of the chemical inhibitor resulted in significant reduction of ERK1/2 activity in comparison with the controls upon oxygen exposure ( Figure 4e ). However, reduction of ERK1/2 by PD98059 inhibitor significantly increased hyperoxic toxicity and decreased cell survival against control cells as determined by a trypan blue exclusion assay (Po0.05, Figure 4f ). We also confirmed the results using the MTT assay showing that proliferation was decreased by the inhibitor (not shown).

Until very recently, there was no report to demonstrate caspase-mediated apoptosis in animals by hyperoxia. 45 Apoptosis was identified by Vybrant Apoptosis Assay (Molecular Probes), which showed that the apoptosis was reduced by overexpression of hOgg1 (green dye staining apoptotic cells, while red dye staining necrotic cells, Figure 5a ). Control A549 cells expressing vector had 40% apoptotic cells (green color), while transduced cells expressing hOgg1 had virtually no apoptosis (o5%, similar to room air control) by quantitative assessment (Figure 5b ). Our data indicate that overexpression of hOgg1 in A549 cells reduced hyperoxic apoptosis compared with the vector control. hOgg1 may interact with cell survival signaling pathways to reduce hyperoxia-induced apoptosis. To ascertain the results, apop-tosis was determined by Death ELISA assay to measure the nucleosomal DNA fragments and the results showed that overexpression of hOgg1 significantly reduced apoptosis from hyperoxic exposure (Figure 5c ). Other assays such as TUNEL and DNA laddering also demonstrate the similar results (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate the protection role of hOgg1 in lung epithelial cells through attenuating apoptosis, and support our hypothesis that hyperoxia regulates both MAPK and hOgg1.",

We assessed whether hyperoxia can increase levels of p53 or Increase in ERK1/2 MAP kinase activity by overexpressing hOgg1. (a) Activation of ERK1/2 in A549 cells by hyperoxia using ERK1/2 kinase assay. A549 cells were incubated in room air or 95% O 2 for 24 h before immunoprecipitation with phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was measured by pElk-1 antibody using ERK1/2 kinase assay as per the manufacturer's instructions. (b) Activation of ERK1/2 in primary AECII cells by hyperoxia using ERK1/2 kinase assay. AECII cells were incubated in room air or 95% O 2 for 24 h before being assayed as above. (c) ERK1/2 activity was further increased by overexpression of hOgg1 in AECII cells. AECII cells were prepared by the method described previously. 31,59 AECII cells expressing hOgg1 (24 h after transfection) were exposed to hyperoxia for 24 h. ERK1/2 MAPK activity of control and transfected cells was determined as above. (d) Reduction of hyperoxic toxicity correlates with increase of ERK1/2 kinase activity in A549 cells overexpressing hOgg1 (clone 2). Survival of cells overexpressing hOgg1 was determined by a trypan blue exclusion assay compared to the vector control under hyperoxia (48 h) . (e) Blocking of the ERK1/2 activity by specific MEK/ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (Cambiochem) for 30 min before exposure to 95% oxygen. (f) Inhibition of ERK1/2 kinase activity by inhibitor PD98059 aggravated hyperoxic toxicity in A549 cells (48 h) . The results of a trypan blue exclusion assay demonstrated decreased cell survival under hyperoxia compared to the control p21. Despite not being a lung cell line, p21 deficient cell lines (HCT116 p21 \u00c0/\u00c0 ) cells are well-established model of p21 knockout that does not need to further establish and characterize the p21 deficiency. 33 We detected significantly reduced levels of ERK1/2 (half of the control) in HCT116 p21 \u00c0/\u00c0 cells compared with the parental HCT116 cells when exposed to hyperoxia (36 h), suggesting that HCT116 p21 \u00c0/\u00c0 cells were particularly sensitive to hyperoxic toxicity, consistent with previous reports. 19 For the gel, consistent loading of samples was ensured by BCA protein assay (Figure 6a ). In addition, we have found that hyperoxia induced cell cycle arrest, but hOgg1 expression reduced this arrest by flow cytometry (not shown). We then studied p53 and p21 activation in A549 cells in hyperoxia using semiquantitative RT-PCR. The results demonstrate that transcripts of p21 were markedly upregulated by hyperoxia (Figure 6b ) against control (from undetectable to strong band at 24 and 48 h) in a dose-dependent manner. mRNA transcripts of p53 were also increased against the control (increase by four-fold at 48 h; Figure 6b ). Both sets of RT-PCR results were examined by GAPDH as the internal control, which showed no difference in sample loading.",

The results showed that increased phosphorylation at Ser37 (three-fold increase at 48 h 95% oxygen) (Figure 6c ). Ser392 of p53 was also shown a two-fold increase at 12 h 95% oxygen compared with the control (not shown). The above data indicate that both p53 and p21 may be associated with MAPK activity upon hyperoxic toxicity. Since above results also indicate that apoptosis was involved in hyperoxia, thus p21 may have a protective role in hyperoxic DNA damage. Finally, we dissected whether BER affected p21 or p53. Our results indicate that overexpression of BER hOgg1 increased p21 and p53 activity compared with the vector controls. However, p21 induction was not dependent on p53 (data not shown). Taken together, BER proteins may have an interaction with p21 and p53. It is still unclear whether p21 is a result of the upregulated p53. Finally, we have also revealed a three-fold increase in phosphorylation of CDC2 at Thr161 after 48 h 95% exposure (Figure 6d ). Since the CDC2cyclin B heterodimers act to trigger all the major events of mitosis, hyperoxia may induce both death and living signaling in damaged cells. The fate of the cell will eventually be decided by the balance and interaction of the complex signaling pathways, particularly BER and MAPK along with p53 and p21 ( Figure 7 for the hypothetic pathway during hyperoxic injury).",

Our report also reveals an association between MAPK and BER proteins as a response to hyperoxic damage in A549 cells and primary AECII cells. This observation is based on the fact that overexpression of the BER hOgg1 attenuated the hyperoxia toxicity while with altered MAPK activity. This indicates that BER gene products may reduce DNA damage related to MAPK activity. Further experiments suggest that apoptosis was induced while reduction in p38 and increase in ERK1/2 alleviates the toxicity. Previous reports have indicated that oxidative stress can regulate MAPK through mismatch DNA repair pathways. 28 To our knowledge, this study is the first to show such a mechanism by which hyperoxia-induced MAPK activity may be associated with the BER pathway. Our study also suggests that different MAPK may have distinct roles in response to hyperoxic toxicity.",

Besides the conventional method of HPLC-ECD to measure 8-oxo-dG, we have examined the possibility of Western blotting to detect 8-oxo-dG. It is convenient to use Western blotting, and our results showed consistent quantity of 8-oxo-dG determined by the conventional method HPLC-ECD. Repair of 8-oxo-dG is required as this lesion may result in mutations or significant toxicity; for lung cells, the toxicity is of a major concern. DNA repair proteins, especially, BER can effectively repair 8-oxo-dG lesion initiated by hOgg1. hOgg1 can alleviate oxygen-induced DNA damage by removing the modified 8-oxo-dG on the DNA through glycosylase activity. 5 We now show that the DNA glycosylase hOgg1 was able to significantly reduce hyperoxia induced DNA damage and cytoxicity. In addition, hOgg1 overexpression seemingly involves MAPK activity in both cultured cell line A549 and primary AECII cells. MAPK participate in diverse cellular functions including cell proliferation, transformation, and differentiation. 22, 23, 46 MAPK p38a was significantly activated by hyperoxia; inhibition of p38a using dominant-negative construct reduced the toxicity of hyperoxia. However, this study cannot exclude other p38 isoforms that are involved in hyperoxia induced G2 arrest. Furthermore, significant inhibition of p38 demonstrates reduction in apoptosis determined by Vybrant and Death ELISA assays. The medical significance is that perturbation of p38 may be useful tool to reduce hyperoxic toxicity in lung cells.",

BER proteins have not been reported to be directly associated with cell proliferation and cell growth that are the main functions of some MAPK. BER proteins are critical to repairing oxidant DNA lesions, particularly the 8-oxo-dG adduct. However, DNA damage repair might participate in regulation of cell growth or proliferation by interacting with other cell signaling proteins under oxidative stress. hOgg1 is expressed on many cell types, 47 but can be depleted by oxidative damage like chemical carcinogens. 20, 48 Therefore, hOgg1 plays a potential role in homeostasis of the cell; 47 indeed, frequent mutations of hOgg1 are associated with a variety of tumors. [49] [50] [51] Overepxression of hOgg1 has been shown to reduce toxicity of chemotherapeutics or other stresses by several groups. 5, 13, 52 No untowards effects, such as increased apoptosis of the cells, have been found when hOgg1 is overexpressed up to 3 years with retroviral vectors (Wu et al., unpublished) .",

We also demonstrated that p21 deficient cells were more sensitive to hyperoxia treatment associated with a decrease in ERK1/2 activity, consistent with previous observations. 19 Thus, regulation of p21 may be related to ERK1/2 expression and activation, which may be crucial for reducing hyperoxic toxicity.",

After staining with SYBR green dye, samples were visualized and photographed by fluorescent microscopy using an Olympus BX60 Microscope System and Paxit software (MIS, Franklin Park, IL, USA). Tail length was defined as the distance between the leading edge of the nucleus and the end of the tail as arbitrary units (mm). A total of 75 determinations were made for each sample using Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe System Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). The experiments were repeated at least three times.

This result indicates that hyperoxic treatment increased DNA damage compared to the control. After exposure to hyperoxia for 2 days, the average of tail lengths for 75 control cells was 1.270.21 arbitrary units (mm), while 14.871.7 mm in oxygen-treated cells (Po0.01). To further identify the particular DNA adduct, we detected 8-oxo-dG and found a three-fold increase in 8-oxo-dG by 2-day hyperoxicFigure 1Hyperoxic injury to alveolar epithelial A549 cells. A549 cells were incubated in room air or 95% oxygen for 36 h. (a) Morphologic damage assessed using light microscopy ( \u00c2 400). The images demonstrate that hyperoxia altered cellular structure and significantly reduced cell number. (b) DNA strand breaks detected by a comet assay by measuring tail length by confocal fluorescence microscope. The assay demonstrated that average of tail lengths was markedly increased by hyperoxia in the lung cells compared to the control (Po0.001). (c) Induction of 8-oxo-dG in A549 cells following hyperoxia exposure detected by HPLC-ECD. 8-oxo-dG, hallmark of oxidative DNA damage, is represented by arbitrary units (the ratio of oxo-dG to the total amount of dG, 10 5 ).
