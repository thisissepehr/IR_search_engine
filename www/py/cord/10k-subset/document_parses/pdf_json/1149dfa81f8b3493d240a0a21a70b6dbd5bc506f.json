However, little empirical data is available on the health status of and health service access barriers faced by these international migrants. Methods: Foreigners who visited the Guangzhou Municipal Exit-Entry Administration Office to extend their visas were invited to participate in the study. Quantitative data were collected using electronic questionnaire in 13 languages. The participants were characterised by the income level of their country of origin (high-, middle-and low-income countries (HICs, MICs and LICs, respectively)), and the key factors associated with their health status, medical insurance coverage and perceptions of health services in China were examined. Results: Overall, 1146 participants from 119 countries participated in the study, 57.1, 25.1 and 17.8% of whom were from MICs, HICs and LICs, respectively. Over one fifth of the participants experienced health problems while staying in China, and about half had no health insurance. Although the participants from HICs were more likely than those from MICs and LICs to have medical insurance, they were also more likely to have health problems. Furthermore, 43.0, 45.0 and 12.0% of the participants thought that the health services in China were good, fair and poor, respectively. Among the participants, those from HICs were less likely to have positive feedback. Conclusions: Our study is the first to report a quantitative survey of the health status, health insurance coverage, and health service perceptions of a diverse and surging population of international migrants in China.

With such a high frequency of international mobility, the international migrants are more likely to be exposed to individual, social and environmental risks to health [33, 34] , which may subsequently increase their vulnerability to health problems [35, 36] . Moreover, such high mobility could lead to potential risks of disease transmission. For example, both SARS and Zika viruses that recently caused outbreaks of contagious diseases in China and South America were originally carried by international migrants during their trips and led to transmission in local areas [37] [38] [39] .

In the current context of globalisation and the continuing growth of China's economy, more international migrants in China can be expected, and it will undoubtedly warrant a reform of the local health system to adapt to the multi-cultural reality. Such reform will indeed play a positive role in strengthening health diplomacy between China and other partner countries and expand China's contribution to global health development [44, 45] . Therefore, our findings regarding the diverse backgrounds of international migrants in Guangzhou (Guangdong Province), including the 119 countries of origin, the languages they used, and the different socio-economic Variables that were non-significant in univariate logistic regression models of all outcome variables were not listed in the table, namely currently has a job in China, number of years since the first visit to China, and number of fellow townsmen one knew in Guangzhou --: Variables that were non-significant in univariate logistic regression models. + : p < 0.1; * : p < 0.05; ** : p < 0.01; *** : p < 0.001. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with p < 0.05 are presented in bold background, will be the beginning of the understanding of the demands on the health care system. Due to the 'Belt and Road' strategy and 'South-South collaboration' , more international migrants in China are expected in future. More future studies should be conducted to explore the health issues faced by international migrants and to develop pilot innovative interventions to meet their health needs and the requirement for pandemic surveillance.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 199, "end": 203, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 830, "end": 834, "text": "[44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 835, "end": 838, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "International Organization for Migration", "authors": [], "year": 2015, "venue": "International Migration Report", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Shifting tides: Global economic scenarios for 2015-25", "authors": [{"first": "&amp;", "middle": [], "last": "Mckinsey", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "", "middle": [], "last": "Company", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2015, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "International Organization for Migration", "authors": [], "year": 2017, "venue": "International Migration Report", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "The African trading community in Guangzhou: an emerging bridge for Africa-China relations", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Bodomo", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2010, "venue": "China Q", "volume": "203", "issn": "", "pages": "693--707", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "New Express News.

Second, because the study period (January) was right after the Christmas holidays, during the winter holidays for Chinese universities, and before the Chinese New Year, it is likely that many foreigners may have left China for their home countries; therefore, in other months of the year, there could be more international migrants. Thus, caution should be exercised when generalising the findings to the entire international migrant population of China. Third, although confidentiality and privacy were guaranteed during the survey process, reporting bias may still exist as all data were self-reported under the circumstances.
