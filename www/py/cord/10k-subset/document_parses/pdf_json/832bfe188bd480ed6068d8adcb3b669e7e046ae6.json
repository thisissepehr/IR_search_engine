Over the last 15 years, the number of its recognized species has grown from 77 to 106, but knowledge of their interrelationships has not kept pace. Species limits and phylogenetic relationships of this morphologically conservative group remain problematic due both to poor sampling across the Afrotropics and to repeated instances of mitochondrial-nuclear discordance. Recent intensive surveys in East Africa and neighboring regions, coupled with parallel studies by others in West Africa and in Southern Africa, offer a new basis for understanding its evolutionary history. Results: We investigated phylogenetic relationships and intraspecific genetic variation in the Afro-Palearctic clade of Rhinolophidae using broad sampling. We sequenced mitochondrial cytochrome-b (1140 bp) and four independent and informative nuclear introns (2611 bp) for 213 individuals and incorporated sequence data from 210 additional individuals on GenBank that together represent 24 of the 33 currently recognized Afrotropical Rhinolophus species. We addressed the widespread occurrence of mito-nuclear discordance in Rhinolophus by inferring concatenated and species tree phylogenies using only the nuclear data. Well resolved mitochondrial, concatenated nuclear, and species trees revealed phylogenetic relationships and population structure of the Afrotropical species and species groups. Conclusions: Multiple well-supported and deeply divergent lineages were resolved in each of the six African Rhinolophus species groups analyzed, suggesting as many as 12 undescribed cryptic species; these include several instances of sympatry among close relatives. Coalescent lineage delimitation offered support for new undescribed lineages in four of the six African groups in this study. On the other hand, two to five currently recognized species may be invalid based on combined mitochondrial and/or nuclear phylogenetic analyses. Validation of these cryptic lineages as species and formal relegation of current names to synonymy will require integrative taxonomic assessments involving morphology, ecology, acoustics, distribution, and behavior. The resulting phylogenetic framework offers a powerful basis for addressing questions regarding their ecology and evolution.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "We remain in an era of biological discovery [1] , even for supposedly well-known vertebrate groups such as mammals. In the last 15 years alone, the total number of mammal species has grown by fully 20%, while the accumulation of new bat species (26.4%), especially in tropical regions, has grown even faster [2, 3] . The discovery of new bat species in the Afrotropics (Africa south of the Sahara, including Madagascar and continental shelf islands) has paralleled these global trends, buoyed by continuing geographic and taxonomic surveys of bats across the region, a growing number of systematic investigations using molecular phylogenetic and integrative taxonomic approaches, and the use of more powerful and objective means of assessing species boundaries. The species limits of morphologically conservative or cryptic lineages of bats have been greatly clarified by an integrative approach using multi-locus genetic delimitation methods as a starting point for identifying candidate species and then testing them using additional, corroborative data from behavioral, morphological, distributional, and/or ecological information ( [4] , cf.

They have been shown to be conservative in that high delimitation posterior probabilities are consistent indicators of species status ( [15] and references therein). Briefly, methods such as the software BPP [15, 16] infer statistical support for genetic isolation on an evolutionary timescale. However, species delimitation based exclusively on molecular data is controversial. It has been shown that multispecies multilocus coalescent delimitation methods can confound species-level and population-level processes and delimit population structure rather than species when the speciation process is protracted ( [17] but see also, [18, 19] ). However these debates on the status of delimited lineages are resolved, the multispecies coalescent remains a powerful method for inferring the evolutionary independence of lineages that can be subsequently tested with independent data (e.g., morphology, and bioacoustics data in bats) to assess species status in an integrative taxonomy [4] . In this study we carry out lineage delimitation as a foundation for subsequent taxonomic revisions (see [20] ).

They described the new species R. gorongosae on the basis of integrative data that included a suite of morphological variables, but their molecular phylogenetic analyses relied solely on cytochrome-b. Their putative R. gorongosae (DM14815, DM14843) had anomalously long branches (p-distance 7.3 and 7.2% from R. simulator and putative R. rhodesiae, respectively; see their Fig. 2) and nested within R. simulator, which motivated us to re-examine these deeply diverged specimens. In addition, the sister relationship they determined of R. landeri and R. gorongosae (15% p-distance), instead of with alcyone and lobatus [other members of the landeri group; 13], led us to compare this sequence to GenBank accessions using BLASTn. The BLASTn query showed 100% identity of their R. landeri (GenBank accession MG980682, DM12953, Liberia) with Bos taurus. When tissue from this voucher specimen and another (DM12622), also from Liberia, was extracted and new sequence data generated, those individuals were found to nest deeply within the R. blasii clade 1 (Additional file 4). We extracted and sequenced five samples identified as R. gorongosae from the Durban Museum, including DM14815 from [12] , and found them to be 1-1.4% cyt-b diverged from R. simulator and R. rhodesiae. This strongly suggests that the genetic arguments in [12] for the newly described R. gorongosae and for elevation of R. swinnyi rhodesiae to species rank were based on sequencing error (see Additional file 5 for comparison of GenBank sequences versus newly sequenced material). Several studies have demonstrated instances of mitochondrial introgression (i.e. mitochondrial capture) among populations of R. ferrumequinum and R. clivosus [6] ; R. sinicus, R. rouxii, R. pearsonii pearsonii, and R. p. chinensis, restricted to eastern Eurasia (Mao et al.

[12] suggested historical genetic introgression might account for the discrepancy between the morphological disparity of R. simulator and R. rhodesiae and their lack of genetic differentiation (0.6%). However, they did not test this hypothesis with genetic data. In this study, mitochondrial, concatenated nuclear loci, and the species tree (also inferred with nuclear data only) all strongly infer the very close relationship of R. rhodesiae to R. simulator clade 1. Although the cyt-b tree recovers both gorongosae and rhodesiae as paraphyletic, the concatenated nuclear phylogeny recovers them in two separate monophyletic clades (simulator 1 and 2; Fig. 4 ).
