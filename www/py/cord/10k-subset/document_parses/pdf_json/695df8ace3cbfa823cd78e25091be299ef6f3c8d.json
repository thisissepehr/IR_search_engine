We hypothesized that other types of acute lung injury causing ARDS may share the same metabolic alterations. As proof of concept, we have analyzed the metabolomic profiles of patients with and without ARDS induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPP) (ARDS = 13; no ARDS = 17) or IAP (ARDS = 12; no ARDS = 18). Some of the results of these studies have been previously reported in the form of an abstract [2] . Patients with SPP were older (p < 0.05) and presented more often with renal failure (p < 0.05) ( Table-S1 ). Serum samples were obtained within 24 h of presentation to the emergency department, before starting mechanical ventilation, and examined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, as previously described [1, 3] . We quantified 16 characteristic serum metabolites, and statistical significance was determined using a Bonferroni-corrected Student t test, assuming unequal variance, with p < 0.05 considered significant.",
