For influenza alone, the rate of visits to United States EDs during the influenza season was estimated at 6-27 per 1000 children <5 years. 1 Influenza is transmitted from human to human mainly through inhalation of large droplets that are expelled during coughing or sneezing, but also through direct contact with a contagious person or contaminated inanimate objects. 2, 3 Influenza virus may survive on surfaces and transfer to hands and vice versa. 4, 5 Respiratory syncytial virus is primarily transmitted through contact. 6 Both viruses may spread rapidly in closed settings. Compared to adults, children with respiratory viral infections shed higher viral loads and for more days, while at the same time they do not adhere to hygiene measures.

Our data indicate that visiting the ED of a large pediatric hospital during the winter is associated with an extremely low risk for acquisition of a respiratory viral infection, despite the high burden of influenza and RSV cases admitted through the ED. The study was conducted in the largest pediatric ED in Greece, and our results may be generalized to other EDs with similar crowded conditions and waiting hours. Quach et al. 9 also found that a visit to a Canadian pediatric ED did not seem to result to a detectable risk of respiratory infection among children \u00a35 years. Alcohol-based solutions and surgical masks were available for ED visitors in both studies; however, adher-ence of children to infection control measures is questionable. In another study conducted during 1983-1984, it was shown that exposure of young children to an ambulatory pediatric office was not an important cause of respiratory or gastrointestinal infections with an incubation period of \u00a31 week. 11 A likely explanation for these findings is the high baseline risk of respiratory infection in children. In a study using a Monte Carlo stochastic model to analyze the transmission of airborne infections in a hospital waiting area under various occupancy levels, waiting times, and ventilation rates, it was found that the mean probability for acquiring influenza, although relatively small, increased with increasing waiting times and decreasing distance among visitors. 12 Emergency departments in Greek hospitals are typically overcrowded during winter and many parents in our study reported that they moved away from symptomatic patients, a fact that may had an impact on the extremely low rate of transmission of infection. Another explanation is the fact that ill children stayed at their home after their visit to the ED, which most probably protected them from acquisition of an infection. However, in the study conducted in Canada, 9 the risk for onset of a respiratory illness was 17%, similar to others. 13 Climatic differences that may influence the frequency of congregation in closed settings, as well as viral transmission per se, may also play a role.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 116, "end": 118, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 723, "end": 724, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1277, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1749, "end": 1751, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2218, "end": 2219, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2292, "end": 2294, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, a visit to a pediatric ED during winter appears to be associated with an extremely low risk for acquisition of a respiratory viral infection.
