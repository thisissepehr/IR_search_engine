The ongoing outbreak of novel H1N1 2009 infl uenza (swine infl uenza) has caused more than 3,99,232 laboratory confi rmed cases of pandemic infl uenza H1N1 and over 4735 deaths globally. This novel 2009 infl uenza virus designated as H1N1 A/swine/California/04/2009 virus is not zoonotic swine fl u and is transmitted from person to person and has higher transmissibility then that of seasonal infl uenza viruses. In India the novel H1N1 virus infection has been reported from all over the country. A total of 68,919 samples from clinically suspected persons have been tested for infl uenza A H1N1 across the country and 13,330 (18.9%) of them have been found positive with 427 deaths. At the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi India, we tested 1096 clinical samples for the presence of novel H1N1 infl uenza virus and seasonal infl uenza viruses. Of these 1096 samples, 194 samples (17.7%) were positive for novel H1N1 infl uenza virus and 197 samples (18%) were positive for seasonal infl uenza viruses. During outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases accurate and rapid diagnosis is critical for minimizing further spread through timely implementation of appropriate vaccines and antiviral treatment. Since the symptoms of novel H1N1 infl uenza infection are not specifi c, laboratory confi rmation of suspected cases is of prime importance.",

            "text": "The current outbreak of swine infl uenza that originated in Mexico in March 2009 has spread to more than 80 countries causing more than 3,99,232 laboratory confi rmed cases of pandemic infl uenza H1N1 globally and over 4735 deaths reported to World Health Organization (WHO)as of 11 October 2009 [1] . The WHO declared pandemic alert stage 6 on 11 June 2009, indicating an ongoing infl uenza pandemic [2] . The 2009 swine fl u virus designated H1N1 A/swine/California/04/2009 is not zoonotic swine fl u and is not transmitted from pigs to humans, but rather from person to person and has higher transmissibility than seasonal infl uenza viruses [3] . In humans, H1N1 swine fl u presents as an infl uenza-like illness (ILI) with symptoms similar to seasonal infl uenza, i.e. fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, muscle pains, severe headache, however, a considerable proportion of patients reported vomiting or diarrhea which is unusual in seasonal infl uenza [4, 5] . Since these symptoms are not specifi c to swine fl u, early in the pandemic physicians were advised to consider swine infl uenza in the differential diagnosis of patients with acute febrile respiratory illness who had returned from Mexico or been in contact with persons with confi rmed swine fl u [6] . This new strain of H1N1 swine infl uenza has a unique combination of genes from both North American and Eurasian swine lineages that has not been identifi ed previously in either swine or human populations [7] . The virus appears to be a result of reassortment of two swine infl uenza viruses, one from North America and one from Europe with the North American virus itself the product of previous re-assortments, carrying an avian PB2 gene for at least 10 years and a human PB1 gene since 1993. The virus also has genome segments of avian origin. Hence scientists call this novel strain as a \"quadruple reassortant\" virus. The hemagglutinin (HA) gene is similar to that of swine fl u viruses present in pigs in United States since 1999, where as neuraminidase (NA) and matrix (M) genes resemble viruses present in European pigs. Viruses with this genetic makeup have not previously been found in humans or pigs.",

These rapid infl uenza diagnostic tests can provide results within 30 min or less. Hence the results are available in a clinically relevant time period. Diagnostic tests for detection of novel H1N1 infl uenza virus antigen may be of two main types: direct fl uorescent antibody (DFA) tests and rapid enzyme/optical immunoassays or assay for NA enzymatic activity. Direct fl uorescent antibody (DFA) staining of clinical specimens using specifi c monoclonal antibodies against novel H1N1 infl uenza virus antigen can be a reliable and relatively rapid technique for the pandemic novel H1N1 infl uenza virus detection. Studies of DFA detection of infl uenza viruses have shown highly variable results with sensitivities ranging from 40% to 100%. Recent analytical studies indicate that commercially available RIDTs can detect novel infl uenza A (H1N1) virus [17] . In a study Chan et al. showed that the rapid antigen tests they evaluated in their study have comparable sensitivity for detection of novel H1N1 infl uenza and seasonal infl uenza viruses [18] . Data on analytical sensitivity for detection of different viruses does not directly refl ect clinical sensitivity on patient specimens. However, only limited data have been published on the performance of RIDTs compared with RT-PCR for detecting the presence of novel infl uenza A (H1N1) virus in clinical specimens [19] . Compared to RT-PCR, the sensitivity of RIDTs for detecting novel infl uenza A (H1N1) virus infections ranged from 10% to 70%. The sensitivity of RIDTs to detect novel infl uenza A (H1N1) virus is equal to or lower than the sensitivity to detect seasonal infl uenza viruses [17] . Although these rapid tests do not differentiate between novel H1N1 2009 infl uenza virus and seasonal infl uenza A or even between subtypes H1 and H3 but they may provide useful information that might impact patient care. Understanding the limitations of rapid tests is very important to appropriately interpret results for clinical management of the disease [20] .",

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a widely used molecular tool that has been applied to both infl uenza virus detection and subtype characterization of virus isolates. Most infl uenza A PCR assays in use target conserved regions of the M gene and therefore should detect infl uenza A from all established subtypes, including the newly emergent novel H1N1 infl uenza. However, such methods need to be complemented with a rapid subtyping test to distinguish seasonal infl uenza A from novel H1N1 2009 infl uenza virus. Multiplex PCR testing for the detection of respiratory viruses has seen major advances over the past decade resulting in the development of several commercially available tests. These tests can amplify one or more genes from a number of respiratory viruses and detect amplifi ed products using microgene arrays. One such assay the xTAGTM RVP test was developed in 2005 immediately following SARS and H5N1 infl uenza and was designed to detect and type the three infl uenza A subtypes circulating at that time viz. H1, H3 and H5 [21, 22] .",
