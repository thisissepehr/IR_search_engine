However, new studies have provided evidence contradicting these results. Method: A search was performed of the Pubmed, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Virtual Health Library databases for randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluating 28-day mortality in ARDS patients treated with NMBA within 48 h. An English language restriction was applied. Relevant data were extracted and pooled into risk ratios (RR), mean differences (MD), and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effect model. Sensitivity and metaregression analysis were performed. Results: From 2675 studies, we included five RCTs in the analysis, for a total of 1461 patients with a mean PaO 2 / FIO 2 of 104 \u00b1 35 mmHg. The cisatracurium group had the same risk of death at 28 days (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78-1.03; I 2 = 50%, p = 0.12) and 90 days (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.62-1.06; I 2 = 56%, p = 0.06) as the control group (no cisatracurium). The secondary outcomes of mechanical ventilation duration and ventilator-free days were not different between the two groups. Cisatracurium had a significantly lower risk of barotrauma than the control group with no difference in intensive care unit (ICU)-induced weakness. The PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio was higher in the cisatracurium group but not until 48 h. Meta-regression analysis of the baseline PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio, positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) revealed no heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis excluding the trial using high PEEP and light sedation strategy yielded an improvement in all mortality outcomes. Conclusion: NMBA improves oxygenation only after 48 h in moderate, severe ARDS patients and has a lower barotrauma risk without affecting ICU weakness. However, NMBA does not reduce ventilator-free days, duration of mechanical ventilation or, most importantly, the mortality risk regardless of the severity of ARDS.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe diffuse lung injury characterized by significantly impaired oxygenation and lung compliance that frequently leads to mechanical ventilation [1] [2] [3] . ARDS is common, accounting for 10 to 15% of intensive care unit admissions and 200,000 patients a year in the US [4, 5] . In a large observational study, the mortality rate of moderate to severe ARDS was up to 40% [4] . Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) have been proposed during the early course of moderate to severe ARDS especially in those with PaO 2 /FIO 2 < 120 mmHg to improve oxygenation and reduce patient-ventilator dyssynchrony [6] [7] [8] . NMBA facilitates oxygenation in various studies [9] [10] [11] by various mechanisms, including reducing ventilator-induced lung injuries and inhibiting inflammatory cytokines [12, 13] . An early, short-term continuous infusion of cisatracurium, an NMBA, was evaluated in a large multicenter randomized study (ACURASYS trial), and evidence of its survival benefits in ARDS was found in an anticipated post hoc analysis of patients with PaO 2 /FIO 2 < 120 mmHg. NMBA, however, could be associated with muscular weakness and the need of more sedatives [6, 14, 15] . Of note, besides NMBA use, increasing evidence of other supportive treatments for ARDS patients such as sedation, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) strategy, and prone positioning has been developed since major data on NMBA were published [16] [17] [18] . The question of whether NMBA is effective is still unknown. Recently, the largest randomized controlled trial on NMBA in early ARDS patients was published to reassess the effect of an early, short-term continuous infusion of cisatracurium (ROSE trial), and no survival benefit was found [19] .

However, it is noted that this benefit of oxygenation is not observed until 48 h.
