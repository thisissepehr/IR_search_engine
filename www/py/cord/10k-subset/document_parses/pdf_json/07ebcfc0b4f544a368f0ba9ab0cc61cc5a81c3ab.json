The reduction of GFAP-positive astrocytes is also indicative of a drug-induced damage. The axonal injury suggests a toxic-metabolic drug effect, whereas the concomitant activation of microglia is indicative of a long-standing progressive process. The noninflammatory vasculopathy can be considered as the morphological substrate of a disturbed blood-brain barrier. Our findings demonstrate that drugs of abuse initiate a cascade of interacting toxic, vascular, and hypoxic factors that finally result in widespread disturbances within the complex network of central nervous system cell-cell interactions. .",

There was no significant difference in the postmortem interval between both groups. All persons tested negative for HIV-1 infection.

Because this group did not significantly differ from the controls in the pres-Forensic Science, Medicine, and Pathology V2-2 ence of brain edema or signs of increased intracranial pressure, the mechanism of a secondary phenomenon owing to global hypoxia-ischemia cannot explain our findings. Furthermore, the microglial activation selectively in the white matter of polydrug abusers argues against an acute or agonal phenomenon and is indicative of a long-standing progressive process. Based on these findings, it seems likely that drugs of abuse might induce direct toxic-metabolic axonal damage, which might be induced or enhanced by cerebral hypoxia. Besides these direct mechanisms, the activated microglia could increase the axonal damage by the release of cytotoxic substances. The extent of the axonal damage is likely to be underestimated, because \u00df-APP only detects relatively recently damaged axons (26) , whereas the duration of the abuse of drugs often lasts several years. Therefore, in conjunction with the microglial activation, a chronic-progressive process has to be considered, which might be initiated and supported by drugs of abuse. The alterations might be the morphological correlate of the observed demyelination and hyperintense areas seen on magnetic resonance imaging (2, 27, 28) .",

            "text": "Cerebrovascular accidents are frequently seen in the context of drug abuse, but to date there is no consensus about the cause (1,2). As one possible pathogenetic mechanism, a drug-induced vasculitis has been postulated (40) . However, in our study, vasculitic changes could not be observed, so that we cannot confirm the regular occurence of a vasculitis in drug abusers.In a study of AIDS patients, small-vessel thickening, perivascular space dilatation, pigment deposition, vessel wall mineralization, and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrates were seen in 50% of then former drug abusers (41) .It has been shown that cocaine enhances the expression of inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, and chemokines on brain endothelial cells with consequent increase in permeability of the BBB (42, 43) . After chronic cocaine administration, thrombosis, endothelial thickening, vascular wall fibrosis, and rupture of the basement membrane of brain capillaries have been observed in rats (44) . Methamphetamine induced disturbances in cellular redox status and upregulation of inflammatory genes in brain endothelial cells (45) .On neuroimaging, small areas of demyelination, focal perfusion deficits, a reduction of the cerebral glucose metabolism, and hyperintense areas have been described in the brains of drug abusers (3, 27, 28, 46, 47) , but to date there is no consensus about the cause or possible morphological substrates. Our study demonstrated profound alterations in the cerebral microvasculature. There was reactive endothelial cell proliferation, degenerative hyalinotic thickening, and a decrease of the collagen type IV content of the vascular basal lamina. A degeneration of the vascular basal lamina can result in an increased permeability and a reduced electrical resistance of the BBB (48) . Therefore, this noninflammatory vasculopathy can be considered as the morphological substrate of a disturbed BBB and might be associated with the alterations seen on neuroimaging.In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that drugs of abuse initiate a cascade of interacting toxic, vascular and hypoxic factors which finally result in widespread disturbances within the complex network of CNS cell-cell interactions.
