The common disease pathway involves injury to and necrosis of hepatocytes leading to fibrosis of liver parenchyma resulting in loss of liver function. The exact mechanisms at the cellular level are not entirely understood leading to continued studies with an aim to clarify pathogenesis and improve therapeutic options. 1 The liver is a vital organ playing a role in protein synthesis, metabolism of drugs and nutrients, detoxification, and portal venous blood filtering. Any hepatic dysfunction can lead to alterations in these processes. Pathophysiologically, cirrhosis results in a hyperdynamic state including increased cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance. 2 Baseline portal blood flow is reduced due to portal hypertension, and diminished autoregulation can also result in decreased hepatic arterial blood flow. It has also been suggested that arteriovenous shunting and decreased splanchnic blood flow change overall systemic circulation in the setting of cirrhosis. Splanchnic vasodilation causes effective hypovolemia, driving sodium and water retention mediated by the reninangiotensin system. 3 Activation of the renin-angiotensin system causes renal vasoconstriction, making patients susceptible to kidney injury. 3 Due to these physiologic alterations, the cirrhotic liver is far more vulnerable to hypotension or hypoxemia which can both occur in the operative setting. 4 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 205, "end": 206, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 716, "end": 717, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1080, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1521, "end": 1522, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1643, "end": 1644, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1801, "end": 1802, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Symptoms and Pathophysiology"}, {"text": "A patient with cirrhosis can present on a spectrum from undiagnosed to fulminant liver failure, dependent on the severity of the underlying disease.

Contraindications for elective or semi-elective procedures include acute liver failure, fulminant liver failure, acute viral hepatitis, acute alcoholic hepatitis, and ASA class V. 2 Im et al. proposed a preoperative liver assessment (POLA) checklist to serve as a guideline for assessing surgical risk which includes characterization of liver disease, identification of comorbid conditions, history of prior and current hepatic decompensation, evaluation of liver function, coagulopathy, calculation of MELD/CTP, and review of medications. 2 If the decision to pursue surgery in the elective setting is made, preoperative evaluation by anesthesia is essential.

A 65 yo male presents to your outpatient clinic to discuss a symptomatic right inguinal hernia.

On physical exam, he does have a large right inguinal hernia that is easily reducible but also has a fluid wave on abdominal exam. Prior to proceeding with an elective inguinal hernia repair, you should:A. Do nothing more. He is safe for an elective operation. B. Check an ETOH level to ensure he is not actively still drinking but schedule his operation. C. Tell him he will never be a candidate for a hernia repair due to his cirrhosis D. Refer him to a hepatologist for evaluation and medical optimization given he has ascites which is a manifestation of his liver disease 2. A 45 yo female with a known history of cirrhosis presents to your office with complaints consistent with symptomatic cholelithiasis. She is interested in gallbladder removal.
