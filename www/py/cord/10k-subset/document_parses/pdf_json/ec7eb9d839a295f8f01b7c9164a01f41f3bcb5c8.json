Dr Jacqueline Rendall President, the Irish Thoracic Society Ir J Med Sci (2016) 185 (Suppl 9):S439-S508 S445 Background: Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) is increasingly recognised as a distinct clinical entity. As yet however there is no clear consensus as to what defines ACOS. While asthma is characterized by reversible airway obstruction, many asthmatics smoke and may therefore develop emphysema. In this study we aimed to determine the percentage of patients attending an asthma clinic with a definite diagnosis of asthma who had additional radiological features of emphysema on CT imaging. Methods: We examined the last 100 patients attending a dedicated asthma clinic who had CT thorax performed and determined the number with emphysema on CT thorax. Results: Out of 100 patients, 52 were non smokers, 39 were ex-smokers and 9 were active smokers. Five patients out of 100 were found to have radiological evidence of emphysema. One asthmatic with emphysema was an active smoker, 3 were ex-smokers but one patient was a nonsmoker. Two asthmatics demonstrated reversibility on PFTs while three did not show any reversibility. Alpha1-antitrypsin antibodies were negative in all 5 with radiologically proven emphysema. Conclusion: In our asthmatic cohort, almost 5 % had additional evidence of emphysema. Omalizumab is indicated for the treatment of a certain subgroup of atopic asthmatic individuals with symptoms that are refractory to other treatment modalities. Post marketing surveillance on 57,000 patients has revealed an anaphylaxis rate of around 0.2 % with 56 % of these reactions occurring in the first hour post administration. 44 patients were included in this audit after having received omalizumab in our institution between June 2007 and August 2015 for a total of 1,993 treatments.

Interleukin (IL)-33 is an established promoter of type-2 inflammation and is highly relevant in the pathophysiology of allergic asthma.

In this study, we investigated the role of the single nucleotide polymorphism, Toll-like receptor 3 Leu412Phe (TLR3 L412F; rs3775291), as a causative factor in disease progression in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Furthermore, we investigated the impact of TLR3 L412F in bacterial infection in IPF. We established that TLR3 L412F was associated with a significantly greater risk of mortality and an accelerated rate of decline in FVC in IPF patients (1). Additionally, we demonstrated that activation of TLR3 in 412Fheterozygous primary human lung fibroblasts from IPF patients resulted in reduced IFN-b and TLR3 expression, and dysregulated fibroproliferation, respectively, compared with TLR3 wild-type IPF patients. In this study, we additionally investigated the role of TLR3 L412F in disease pathogenesis in IPF in the context of bacterial infection. Specifically, we established the responses of primary human lung fibroblasts from IPF patients to a panel of bacterial TLR agonists. Here, we demonstrate that 412F-heterozygous IPF fibroblasts have attenuated responses to the bacterial TLR agonists, LPS and flagellin. These findings may have implications for increased bacterial load in IPF patients during infection and accelerated disease progression during exacerbations, and provides additional support for TLR3 L412F as a candidate prognostic marker in the treatment of IPF.

Acute allograft rejection is a significant issue after Lung Transplantation and is predictive of future lung function decline. The diagnosis of acute cellular rejection by transbronchial biopsies carries potentially significant risks and morbidity, particularly for aging transplant patients. The aim of this study is to assess if age influences the incidence of acute cellular rejection detected by transbronchial biopsies within the National Lung Transplant Centre. Method: Data regarding patient gender, age, transplant indication, and TBBx results at 3, 6 and 12 months post transplantation was collected from local records and the hospital electronic database, from February 2005 to December 2015. Patients who did not undergo scheduled bronchoscopy or had inadequate sampling were excluded. ANOVA testing was performed to assess the influence of age on acute cellular rejection. Results: 189 (121 M;68 F) patients were included in this study [CF n = 78 (41 %); IPF/NSIP n = 66 (35 %); COPD n = 23 (12 %); alpha 1 n = 14 (8 %), other n = 8 (4 %)]. Age range 15-72.

At 12 months 63 % patients (n = 76) had A0 rejection, 30 % patients (n = 36) had A1 rejection, 5 % patients (n = 6) had A2 rejection, 2 % patients (n = 3) had A3 rejection. Subsequent analysis demonstrated that individuals C60 years had higher rates of acute cellular rejection on TBBx. There was no statistical significance between group means as determined by one way ANOVA analysis. Conclusion: Routine surveillance TBBx remains an important modality in the early identification of acute cellular rejection in lung allograft recipients and this study did not find any association between patient age and severity of acute cellular rejection.

Background: Ivacaftor is the first CFTR potentiator to become available for treating patients with CF with gating mutations. Emerging work has suggested a reduction in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) in sputum culture after treatment with ivacaftor. Recently blood anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa antibodies have been suggested to be more sensitive and specific than respiratory culture for evaluating Pa status. Methods: Anti-Pa Abs titers were measured by ELISA (Mediagnost) in blood from 21 patients with CF with the G551D mutation before commencing ivacaftor and after 1 year of treatment. Clinical data for the cohort was obtained and Pa status as defined by Leeds Criteria based on standard hospital culture data was also compared to antibody status. Results: Significant improvements in lung function and pulmonary exacerbation frequency were observed post-ivacaftor. There was no significant change in Pa status based on anti-Pa ab (p = 0.105) or in antibody titres (protease (p = 0.79), exotoxin-A (p = 0.87), elastase (p = 0.59)) post-ivacaftor.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Severity of Sleep Disordered Breathing Independently Predicts Metabolic"}, {"text": "We report no significant change in anti-Pa antibody titres or category after ivacaftor in a clinically responsive cohort.

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) have issued guidelines regarding appropriate application of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in acute respiratory failure. These state that blood gas analysis (ABG) should be performed immediately prior to initiation of NIV, and at intervals of 1-2 and 4-6 h post initiation. They also state that a plan in the event of failure of NIV should be documented in the medical records. Aim of our audit was to determine to what degree our practice complies with the BTS guidelines, and compared the results with data collected in 2006/2007. We conducted a retrospective review of 50 patients on whom NIV was initiated following Emergency Response Team (ERT) calls from January to November 2015. We correlated patient records with laboratory data on the Key TM Order Communication System to determine whether blood gas analysis had been performed at the appropriate intervals, and examined patient's charts to determine whether a plan in the event of failure of NIV had been documented. While rates of compliance with the BTS guidelines have improved over the past 10 years, they are still less than satisfactory. Rates of documentation of a plan in the event of failure of NIV are poor, and have worsened since 2006/2007. We propose to educate the NCHD and to change our NIV prescription form to highlight the importance of complying with these guidelines, with particular emphasis on plan in the event of failure, and to re-audit our practice following implementation of these changes.

After local ethical approval, a chart review was performed on all patients presented with haemoptysis to the RALC at Cork University hospital in 2011-2012 and a prospective analysis was performed on all patients presenting between 2013-Jan 2016.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF24": {"text": "References: 1.

To assess if dysregulated C3 activation occurs in AATD, C3d levels were measured in plasma of ZZ individuals and healthy (MM) controls by ELISA. C3d levels were also measured on neutrophil membranes isolated from MZ, ZZ and healthy control (MM) individuals using FACS analysis.

We aimed to see if eosinophil count influenced subsequent readmission in patients, accepted onto a COPD outreach programme.We examined 97 patients with data stratified and subsequently analysed in 3 different categories; no readmission, readmission within 30 days and readmission after 30 days. Eosinophil count above 0.4 IU/L was taken as the initial upper limit of normal for peripheral eosinophils.21/91 patients were eosinophilic at presentation. Of the 97 patients, 53 had no readmission (within what time period), 23 were readmitted within 30 days and 21 readmitted after 30 days. The mean eosinophil counts in the 3 different categories were 0. 212 IU/L, 0.226 IU/L, and 0.261 IU/L respectively, with no significant difference between groups. Of the eosinophilic patients, 10 (47.6 %) were readmitted compared to 44.7 % of the non-eosinophilic group of patientsIn conclusion, eosinophil count does not appear to predict treatment failure and subsequent readmission in patients with an exacerbation of COPD managed by a COPD outreach team.9.6 To Understand the Abundance of Hydrogen Voltage-Gated Channel 1 (HVCN1) on Neutrophils of Alpha-One Antitrypsin Deficient Patients P.

Many patients have significant findings requiring further investigation. With a fast turnover of patients and staff, there is a high potential for patients to become lost to follow-up. The aim of our study is to determine the prevalence of significant findings on CT thorax and the rate of radiological and clinical follow-up according to several relevant variables. A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis was conducted of all CT Thorax and High Resolution CT Thorax scans performed in the AMAU from January to June 2015.

Sahadevan, F. Ali, M. Kooblall, J. Faul, L. Cormican Connolly Respiratory Department, Connolly Hospital, Dublin Pleural effusions are common radiographic findings after pulmonary embolism (PE). Sudden increase in right ventricular (RV) pressure theoretically causes RV dysfunction and increased parietal pleural venous pressure leading to effusions. Our aim was to understand significance of pleural effusions after PE. We analysed 50 admissions with PE between August 2014 and August 2015. Median length of stay (LOS) was 7.5 days. 36 % of patients with PE had pleural effusions noted on CTPA (16 % with bilateral effusions). Pleural effusions did not correlate with RV dysfunction noted on CTPA (R 2 = 0) or using echocardiography (R 2 = 0.03).Presence of an effusion after PE was associated with a significantly increased LOS than patients without an effusion, t (47) = -.2.48, p = 0.017. This represented a large-sized effect on LOS, d = 0.92. Effusions had no significant association with increased mortality in 1 year after a PE, p = 0.656. Our data supports the consideration of PE during investigations of an unexplained pleural effusion. Effusions appear to aid prognostication after PE (increased LOS) but exact etiology remains to be clarified. Lack of correlation with non-invasive markers of RV dysfunction supports alternative mechanisms including increased pulmonary interstitial fluid after acute ischemia distal to PE or due to an inflammatory cytokine response.10.8 RenalImpairment related to Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) in Elderly Patients 10.12 From Oral Selexipag to Parenteral Treprostinil; A Two Week Transition Protocol Sarah Devlin, Caitriona Minnock, Diane Moran, Brian McCullagh, Sean Gaine National Pulmonary Hypertension Unit, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF53": {"text": "Follow-up imaging performedFollow-up imaging not performed Trinity Translational Medical Institute, St James's Hospital, Dublin 8; 2 University of Cambridge, London, UK; 3 St James's Hospital, Dublin 8", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF54": {"text": ": 1.

Ireland Domiciliary non-invasive ventilation (NIV) was first introduced in Altnagelvin Area Hospital in 2001. The aim of this study was to assess the numbers of patients on domiciliary NIV, the reasons for commencing NIV and duration of NIV therapy. Results were compared with data from a similar audit in 2009. This was a retrospective chart audit. All patients on domiciliary NIV on the 1st of August 2016 were included. Their age, year of commencement of NIV and reason for commencement were assessed. The findings were compared to 2009. Ninety-one patients are currently on domiciliary NIV compared with 36 in August 2009. Obesity Hypoventilation/Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Overlap (OHS/OSA) remains the most common diagnosis (39 patients). Twenty-one patients had a neuromuscular disorder including motor neurone disease, 21 patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The numbers of patients on domiciliary NIV in this DGH has increased significantly over the past seven years. The reasons for starting NIV are similar to 2009. An increasing number of patients are surviving longer on NIV now compared to 2009 and this audit raises questions about the need to increase support for these individuals at home. Long term planning needs to include increased physiotherapy, respiratory nurse and palliative care support. 11.10 The Reliability of AHI on CPAP Versus AHI on Limited Sleep Study D. Fitzpatrick, E.

BLC is a novel technique which improves diagnostic yield by providing larger biopsies with more alveolated lung and less artefact [1] . Methods: A retrospective review of all BLCs performed in a large tertiary institute over a three-year period (2014-2016 inclusive) was performed. Tissue size, adequacy, complication rate and diagnostic yield were recorded. Results: Ninety procedures were performed on 75 patients. 246 cryobiopsies (2.73 biopsies/case) were obtained, the majority from the RLL (60.6 %) with a mean biopsy widest diameter of 6.1 mm (range 3-22 mm). Alveolated tissue was present in 96.7 % of biopsies. Diagnosis based against MDT gold standard was confirmed using BLC in 84 % of cases; [IPF (47.1 %), HP (19.1 %), EP/COP (8.8 %), sarcoid (7.4 %), vasculitis (5.9 %), NSIP (4.4 %), other (7.4 %)]. The addition of histological information changed the clinic-radiological diagnosis in 13.3 %.Pneumothorax occurred in 16.7 % (15/90) patients undergoing BLC. Three (3.3 %) required chest drain insertion. Moderate bleeding occurred (Grade 2) in 16.7 % (15/90). 7 patients (7.8 %) required admission for complications, with a mean length of stay of 1.3 days. Discussion/Conclusion: Bronchoscopic lung cryobiopsies now compares favorably to surgical lung biopsy (SLB) in aiding diagnosis of diffuse parenchymal lung disease, with our results showing it is safe and reliable. We conducted a retrospective audit of the last 30 patients commenced on oral antifibrotic (OAF) therapy for IPF. The audits main focus was on OAF selection and adherence, patient education and finally clinic attendance and telephone calls. The IPF nurse led clinic (NLC) was established 18 months ago. It is scheduled for every alternate Wednesday with a capacity for 6 patients. The IPF NLC provides support and education for patients, their families and/or carers about their diagnosis, treatments and symptom management.The audit showed patients are educated by the nurse on initiation of treatment and have follow up scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months.Of the 30 patients reviewed, respiratory nurses received 69 phone calls from 21 patients. These calls dealt with general enquiries (n = 12) and management of treatment side effects (n = 9). Fatigue and nausea were the dominant complaints with 5 patients needing additional NLC appointments. Seven patients treatment was discontinued due to ongoing weight loss (n = 1), poor adherence (n = 1), nausea (n = 2), death (n = 2) and lung transplant (n = 1). In total for these 30 patients the NLC conducted 91 clinic based reviews and 69 telephone consultations and is a valuable resource for patients and carers.

Clusters also occurred, as expected, in urban areas i.e. Cork, Galway and Dublin. Cases in Dublin appear to underrepresented. However, this may relate to patients being diagnosed and managed in local hospitals.Current international guidelines recommend that most patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) should be treated with anticoagulation alone, in the absence of haemodynamic instability [1] . Catheter-directed thrombolysis is not recommended for routine use in ''submassive'' PE. Recent published evidence, however, has suggested that there may be a role for this treatment modality in reversing right heart strain in submassive PE, without incurring the increased risk of major bleeding encountered with systemic thrombolysis [2] . Due to the local expertise available in Tallaght hospital, we have recently been performing catheter-directed thrombolysis and thrombectomy, or ''pharmacomechanical'' thrombolysis on select patients with large pulmonary emboli.We reviewed the charts, radiology, and pre and post treatment imaging of all 4 patients with submassive PE who underwent pharmacomechanical thrombolysis in Tallaght hospital between July and November 2015. Outcomes of right ventricular response to treatment, death, development of haemodynamic instability and major and minor bleeding were assessed.All patients had a significant improvement in the degree of right ventricular dilatation post treatment. All patients survived to discharge without development of haemodynamic instability. There were no incidents of major or minor bleeding post treatment.This case series supports recently published evidence that catheter-directed thrombolysis is a safe and effective treatment for submassive PE, and should be considered as an alternative to anticoagulation alone in these high-risk patients. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is defined as mPAP C25 mmHg. We aimed to compare echo and right heart catheterisation (RHC) in patients with possible PH. Studies suggest a correlation of 70-80 % in this clinical context [1] . 215 RHCs were performed in CUH in the last 5 years. 112 of these 215 had a corresponding echo in the preceding 100 days. RVSP was chosen as a reproducible echocardiographic indicator of PH and we used it to measure concordance of echo with RHC for diagnosis and grading of PH. A US grading system was used that was in line with ESC guidelines [2] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 828, "end": 831, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1169, "end": 1172, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2462, "end": 2465, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2811, "end": 2814, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Geographical Distribution of Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia in Ireland"}, {"text": "Of the 67 echos indicating PH, 61 were confirmed on RHC. Severity of PH was graded the same in only 22 of these 61. 84 of the total 112 had PH on RHC. 27.38 % of these had pre-capillary PH. Of the 84 with PH, 23 had normal RVSP, giving echo a sensitivity of 72.61 %. 20 of the 84 had an elevated PCWP without heart failure.Our calculated sensitivity of echo, albeit subject to selection bias, for PH in CUH is similar to international figures. In our cohort the presence of PH on echo appears to strongly predict detection on RHC. TB recurrence is caused by relapsed infection or exogenous reinfection, and differentiation is crucial for public health planning. We sought to establish the proportion of recurrent cases attributable to relapse vs reinfection in Ireland from 1998 to 2015, and identify common characteristics between cases to inform public health policy.Cases were identified through the Irish Mycobacteria Reference Laboratory database, defined as two culture-positive specimens greater than 12 months apart. MIRU-VNTR typing was performed on each specimen pair to classify as relapse or reinfection, and clinical records were reviewed. Of 46 cases, both specimens and clinical records were available for 37 cases. 4 cases (11 %) were due to reinfection, all occurring in foreignborn persons. 33 cases (89 %) were due to relapse with the same strain, of which 22 (67 %) were Irish-born. 2 cases (6 %) had evidence of new resistance mutations. Of 33 relapse cases, adequate compliance with therapy was documented in 12 (36 %), of which 11 (92 %) had cavitation on initial chest radiograph. Poor compliance was documented in 21 (64 %) cases, though only 3 (9 %) had been managed using DOT. Of these 21 cases, 12 (57 %) had a history of alcohol abuse.Relapse is responsible for the majority of recurrent TB seen in Ireland, and poor compliance is a major contributor. Mandatory DOT is warranted to reduce TB recurrence in Ireland. Lymph node TB demonstrates low rates of culture positivity, the gold standard for diagnosis and the cornerstone of Mtb drug sensitivity testing. Recently, resuscitation promoting factor (Rpf) was observed to stimulate Mtb growth in a previously culture-negative mediastinal LN aspirate, suggesting that addition of Rpf to culture media may increase diagnostic sensitivity [1] . We sought to investigate the effect of Rpf on Mtb culture yield in culture-negative LN aspirates, potentially aiding in diagnostic and management challenges.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2316, "end": 2319, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "References"}, {"text": "Specimens from 8 individual cases of suspected TB lymphadenitis were analysed. Work was performed in the Irish Mycobacteria Reference Laboratory Biosafety Level 3 Facility in accordance with standard protocols. All 8 specimens contained AFB at the time of initial sampling. 6 specimens had MTC DNA detected by GeneXpert TM . All specimens were culture-negative up to 84 days using the BACTEC TM MGIT TM 960 system, yet 8 patients had been treated empirically for TB based on clinical suspicion and microscopy/ Genexpert TM results.Culture-negative material was retained at -20\u00b0C and repeat culture performed in the presence of Rpf purified from H37Rv culture supernatant. Median interval time to repeat culture in the presence of Rpf was 7.5 months (range 5-14). All 8 specimens remained culture negative up to 84 days.These data suggest that Rpf-supplemented media does not increase Mtb culture yield from culture-negative LN aspirates. Establishing a potential role in increasing yield from fresh specimens requires further investigation. Introduction: Hepatotoxicity in patients diagnosed with active tuberculosis is the commonest adverse effect of therapy. We sought to analyse trends in liver function in patients diagnosed with active tuberculosis and to determine predictors of hepatotoxicity. Methods: We studied 275 patients with active TB treated at the Mercy University Hospital (Cork, Ireland) from 2009-2014. A retrospective review was undertaken of all patients' laboratory data and patient correspondence to determine predictors of hepatotoxicity.Results: 170 (62 %) male and 105 (38 %) female patients with active tuberculosis with a mean age of 44 years were studied. 58 out of the 275 patients included in our study developed hepatotoxicity. 15 patients (6 %) required their medication to be stopped or altered due to hepatotoxicity. There was a significant difference in age between patients with hepatotoxicity (52.95 years) and those that didn't develop hepatotoxicity (41.33 years) (p = 0.000). Irish born patients were more likely to develop hepatotoxicity (p = 0.025). There was no significant association between hepatotoxicity and drug abuse (p = 0.211), smoking (p = 0.95), cavitation (p = 0.191), disease site (p = 0.224), alcohol use (p = 0.088) or alcohol excess (p = 0.736). Among patients with tuberculosis, peak AST values at week 10 (see Figure 1 ). In patients with very severe hepatotoxicity, AST levels peaked at week 11 (see Figure 2) . Conclusion: Our study shows hepatotoxicity as a consequence of antituberculous therapy is common. Given the late peak in AST values at week 10 in patients treated with antituberculous therapy, the authors advocate that liver function tests should be monitored regularly throughout the course of treatment.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2372, "end": 2380, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2463, "end": 2472, "text": "Figure 2)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Resuscitation-Promoting Factor Does Not Enhance"}, {"text": "A We distributed an online survey to assess the knowledge and training requirements of medical registrars in setting up and adjusting NIV. We used the information gathered to design a training morning covering the basic theoretical knowledge relating to NIV and hands on training with small group case based discussions with a number of different machines for each group.Using anonymous identifiers, we repeated the Survey one week after the training day and compared the respondent's knowledge and confidence levels post training.Prior to the training day 87 % of registrars had not received formal training in NIV. 19 % were not confident and 68 % were somewhat confident in assessing a patient requiring NIV during acute call.It is clear that knowledge and confidence of medical registrars in relation to NIV is lacking and this will impact patient care during acute medical take. We propose that formal training programmes need to be designed and implemented throughout the country to meet this training requirement. Smoking prevalence in Ireland has reduced from 35 % in 1980 to 19.5 % in 2014. This is welcome news. The Healthy Ireland target is to reduce smoking prevalence to less than 5 % by 2025. This study aimed to determine if this reduction in smoking prevalence was matched with a reduction in smoking related mortality and to forecast future trends in smoking related mortality by gender.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "General Respiratory Chairs"}, {"text": "All smoking-related mortality (using the World Health Organisation (WHO) definition were identified using the International classification of diseases (ICD-10-AM) codes. Death rates were standardized by the direct method. Smoking rates by gender were obtained from WHO and the National Tobacco Control Office. Statistical analysis including trend analysis and rate differences were carried in StatsDirect.All smoking-related mortality reduced for males and females with the gender gap narrowing. There was a significant decrease of 3,385 (36.3 %) among males compared to a reduction of 1,638 (24.7 %) among females. This narrowing of smoking related death rates mirrors the narrowing of smoking prevalence between males and females that occurred in recent times. If this trend continues, the profile of smokingrelated mortality in the next decade will be predominantly female.To achieve targets, additional gender specific initiative are required to accelerate the current reduction in smoking prevalence and smoking-related mortality. The Respiratory Assessment Unit (RAU) is a multidisciplinary unit providing comprehensive care to persons with chronic respiratory disease including outreach, pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen clinics and inpatient/outpatient reviews.

Workflows were mapped out. Clinicians consulted with the IT co-coordinator on form design and user-friendliness. Form building was undertaken by the IT co-ordinator, with frequent team collaboration.To date, successful implementation of electronic recording has been achieved across RAU inpatient services and 90 % outpatient services. In 2016 it is anticipated that over 900 inpatient and over 2000 outpatient contacts will be recorded electronically by RAU staff. Due to budgetary constraints, no new hardware was obtained.The project has shown that with local expertise and team working, clinicians have an important role in the design and implementation of an EPR. The final phase of the project will involve the development of forms to implement secure electronic recording of outreach services and is pending the approval of suitable hardware options. This study compares the outcome in severely and mildly acidotic patients in acidotic hypercapneic respiratory failure (AHRF) on a ward based setting. BTS guidelines advise that IMV should be considered in severe AHRF i.e. pH \\ 7.25, particularly if this persists with optimal treatment. This is a prospective observational study including all patients admitted to the respiratory ward using NIV in SJH in the first 6 months of 2015.
