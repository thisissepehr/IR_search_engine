Studies to date have largely reported associations between MMP-8 plasma levels and/or MMP-8 genotypes and clinical outcomes without elaborating the underlying mechanisms. Most of these studies report a similar trend, i.e., higher MMP-8 levels are associated with worse clinical disease. For instance, MMP-8 is not only strongly associated with acute inflammatory states in humans such as ARDS [18] but also states with chronic inflammation and neutrophilia such as cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, periodontal, and chronic skin diseases [19] [20] [21] [22] . For example, MMP-8 levels correlated well with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in a study of patients with ARDS [23] . Alternatively, several functional MMP-8 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been linked to clinical outcomes as well. For instance, our preliminary analysis from the GenIMS study showed that the rs1940475 genotype was associated with 90-day mortality in patients with CAP, and patients homozygous for the A allele had the best outcomes [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 546, "end": 550, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 696, "end": 700, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 701, "end": 705, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 706, "end": 710, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 711, "end": 715, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 830, "end": 834, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1181, "end": 1184, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In this study, we show that subjects with the A allele had higher peak TNF and IL-6 levels after LPS challenge than those homozygous for the G allele, whereas MIP-1 \u03b1 levels were higher in subjects homozygous for the G allele. In addition, subjects with the A allele also showed a stronger clinical response to LPS infusion in terms of drop in MAP and increase in body temperature. As clinical studies have shown a higher pro-inflammatory response to be associated with poorer survival [24] , our findings of higher peak TNF and IL-6 levels in AA homozygous individuals are not consistent with higher survival rates in our preliminary analysis of AA homozygous individuals with CAP [8] . Conversely, patients homozygous for the G allele had the highest peak MIP-1 alpha levels. MIP-1\u03b1 usually parallels TNF and IL-6 response in a TNF independent way [25] . Bronchoalveolar fluid levels of MIP-1 \u03b1 were inversely correlated with lung compliance in a small human cohort of ARDS patients but not associated with outcomes. These preliminary findings warrant further study in larger cohorts. Our study has several limitations. First, although we calculated a sample size of 40 to be sufficient to detect a 40 % difference in peak MIP-1\u03b1 levels between AA and GG genotypes, our study was not adequately powered to assess any differences beyond that; hence, all additional analyses must be viewed as exploratory. Second, while our results suggest an association between peak plasma cytokine levels and MMP-8 genotypes and thus a role for MMP-8 in cytokine regulation, we do not have insight how this affects downstream cell trafficking to actual sites of infection. Hence, additional studies using alternative compartmental models such as inhaled LPS will be helpful to better understand the role of MMP-8 in ALI and pneumonia. Third, we did not measure MMP-8 levels in our healthy volunteers. Fourth, our study was conducted in healthy male volunteers, and thus, our results may not apply to females. Currently, the exact link between MMP-8 genotypes and plasma levels/activity levels is not well understood. While some studies report a clear doseresponse relationship between MMP-8 genotypes and activity levels, we failed to show a significant association in ex vivo incubation experiments (unpublished data). However, our preliminary data suggest that the rs1940475 SNP results in a conformational change of the active site, which makes the enzyme less amenable to activation [9] .
