Thirteen of the volunteers developed detectable levels of nasal wash neutralizing antibody after immunization; local antibody was most commonly found in volunteers who also produced a detectable but less than four-fold rise in serum antibody titre, and who produced nasal washings with relatively high concentrations of protein and secretory IgA. Four weeks after immunization, the vaccinees and a matched group of control subjects were inoculated with attenuated A/England/ 42/72 (MRC-7) virus. Evidence of infection was found in 14 of 23 (61 per cent) of control subjects and in seven of 23 (30 per cent) of immunized volunteers. This result showed a significant protection (P-0.04) against challenge virus infection for volunteers given intranasal vaccine.",

Since influenza vaccines in saline given intranasally selectively stimulated local production of antibody, this method of immunization has been used in a number of studies (WAI~D~A~ et al., 1968; KASEL et al, 1969; WALD1VIA]ff et al., 1970; WAT,DMA~ and COGGI~S, 1972) . However, local immunization with killed influenza vaccines did not stimulate serum antibody production as effectively as parenteral immunization (GWALTNE\u00a5 et al., 1971 ; WALDYrA~ and CocGI~s, 1972; SEOaE et al., 1974) , and it was the titre of serum antibody which related most directly to immunity to influenza (MEIKLESO~N et al., 1952; Ho~so~ et al., 1972) . In addition, parenteral immunization with influenza vaccine has been reported to induce local antibody as efficiently as intranasal immunization (Dow~IE and STUART-I-IA~IS, 1970; I~OS~BA~ et al., 1973 ; S~ORE et al., 1974) .",

Since parenteral immunization induced relatively high titres of serum antibody and levels of nasal wash antibody comparable to those found following intranasal immunization (POTTER et al., 1973 ; SKORE et al., 1974) , the evidence would indicate that parenteral inoculation of vaccine is the preferred method of immunization.

            "text": "The results of challenge infection of volunteers previously immunized with :'Influvae\" showed that seven of 23 vaccinees were infected with the MRC-7 virus; in contrast, 14 of 23 control volunteers were infected with challenge virus. This result indicated a significant level of protection in the immunized group. It can be argued that better protection could have been achieved by parenteral immunization, and in this respect the present vaccine may suffer by comparison with vaccines given by injection. However, the intranasal vaccine produced no reaction in the present study; in contrast, parenteral immunization has been reported to cause local and occasional systemic reaction, particularly in children (QUILLIGAN et al., 1949; DAVENI~ORT et al., 1964) . In comparisons of intranasal and parenteral vaccines, the former were reported to produce significantly less reaction (WALDMAN et al., 1969; WALDMAN and CoGGI~S, 1972) ; in addition, an intranasal vaccine may be more acceptable to the public than parenteral immunization, and for this reason the potential of this method of immunization should be further explored.",
