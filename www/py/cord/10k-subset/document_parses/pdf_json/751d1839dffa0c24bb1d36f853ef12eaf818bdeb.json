[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] These patients often develop mild virus-associated symptoms and occasional bacterial or fungal pneumonic coinfections, but significant numbers of cases develop severe influenza virus-associated lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Risk factors for influenza LRTI include profound lymphopenia, lack of early antiviral treatment and old age. 5, 6 Pathogenesis of severe viral LRTI and ARDS is unclear and may include virus-induced pathology or excessive immunopathology. 7 Impaired influenzaspecific host immune responses are well-established in hematology-oncology patients but surprisingly little is known about the interactions with virus-associated clinical manifestations and outcomes. The recent introduction of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus in the human population with limited preexistent immunity provided the opportunity to evaluate the role of innate and adaptive host immune findings in determining virus-specific symptoms and viral clearance among hematology-oncology patients with prolonged viral excretion.",

Patients or legal representatives signed informed consent for voluntary study participation and confidentiality. Permission was granted for clinical data collection, blood draw of a research specimen and immunologic studies. Exclusion criteria were patients aged o18 years, patients deemed unfit by the treating physician (for example, owing to severe underlying bleeding disorders, religious background including Jehova's witnesses, altered mental or emotional status) and patients or legal representatives not wishing to enter the study. Medical records were reviewed for relevant clinical findings, virusassociated symptoms and outcomes. Respiratory specimens were assessed for A(H1N1)pdm09, neuraminidase gene H275Y mutation encoding oseltamivir resistance and other respiratory viruses using real-time PCR and viral culture. 8 Pulmonary imaging (chest radiography or computed tomography), bronchoalvolar lavage microbiology results and broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment regimens were evaluated to confirm severe A(H1N1)pdm09associated LRTI and ARDS requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and to exclude concomitant infections (viral, bacterial or fungal) and non-infectious cardiopulmonary causes (lung embolism, pneumothorax or congestive cardiac failure).",

Humoral responses were determined against homologous virus and reference A/California/ 007/09 vaccine strain using serum duplicate HI tests, turkey erythrocytes and four hemagglutinin units of virus. Seroconversion was defined as a fourfold rise of HI titers and HI titers \u2a7e 80 were considered seroprotective. White blood cell differential counts were evaluated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation and lymphocyte subsets were quantified by flow cytometry using CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16, CD19 and CD56 fluorochrome-labeled antibodies. 9 Minimum absolute cell count references were defined for granulocytes (500/ mm 3 ), monocytes (100/mm 3 ), lymphocytes (1000/mm 3 ), CD3 + CD4 + (560/mm 3 ) T cells, CD3 + CD8 + (260/mm 3 ) T cells, CD3 \u2212 CD16 + and/or CD56 + nature killer (NK) cells (40/mm 3 ) and CD19 + B cells (60/mm 3 ).

The presence of virus-specific T cells was evaluated by flow cytometry.

Dead cell staining excluded cells with non-specific results. SEB was used as a positive control and to monitor functional integrity of T cells. Functional virus-specific T cells were confirmed by duplicate detection of CD3 + CD4 + CD69 + IFN\u03b3 + or CD3 + CD8 + CD69 + IFN\u03b3 + cells, 9, 11 excluding profound T-cell lymphopenia.

            "text": "The findings from this study confirm that influenza virusinfected hematology-oncology patients develop a wide clinical spectrum ranging from mild 1 to severe respiratory symptoms 2-4 during prolonged viral excretion. Innate and adaptive host immune responses appear to be major determinants of virusassociated outcome and viral clearance. 3, 6, 7 Earlier studies report that undefined lymphopenia increases the risk for prolonged influenza virus excretion 5, 6 and that lymphocyte reconstitution is associated with viral clearance. 3 Our findings show that prolonged viral excretion more specifically correlated with T-cell lymphopenia. It is generally assumed that T cells induce viral clearance, 7 but this has not clearly been demonstrated in human influenza cases. The role of CD8 + T cells has frequently been characterized in influenza animal models but the role of CD4 + T cells remains unclear. 12 We confirm that viral clearance occurs during CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell reconstitution in the presence of functional virusspecific T cells (Figure 2a ). Viral clearance did not occur during profound CD4 + T-cell and CD8 + T-cell lymphopenia (patients 5 and 6) or during profound CD4 + T-cell lymphopenia with a low-level CD8 + T-cell count (patient 2). This observation supports the assumption that both CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses determine complete viral clearance. 12 The wide clinical spectrum among six hematology-oncology patients with prolonged influenza virus excretion prompted an investigation into the protective role of host immune responses and pathogenesis. Mild symptoms (patients 1 and 2) correlated with a low-level presence of CD8 + T cells even during absence of seroprotective HI titers (patient 2). In contrast, severe viral LRTI (patients 3, 4, 5 and 6) manifested during profound CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell lymphopenia and intercurrent absence of ADCC markers even during the presence of seroprotective HI titers (patients 3 and 4). Patients 3 and 4 developed seroprotective HI titers despite transient profound CD4 + T-cell lymphopenia. High virus-specific Ab titers did not prevent the development of severe viral LRTI and ARDS probably due to intercurrent absence of ADCC effector cells. Altogether, these results support the hypothesis that CD8 + T cells independently mediate clinical protection 7, 11 and that ADCC provides additional clinical protection. 13 The pathogenesis of severe influenza LRTI and ARDS remains unclear and is likely multifactorial. Four cases (patients 3, 4, 5 and 6) with (transient) profound T-cell lymphopenia and absence of ADCC markers developed severe virus-associated LRTI and ARDS during innate cell reconstitution. Our findings suggest that profound CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell lymphopenia and (transient) absence of ADCC markers may have provided a window of opportunity for the virus to reach lower alveolar compartments and trigger severe immunopathology by the excessive influx of neutrophils and macrophages. 14 Timely antiviral treatment is therefore important when protective immune responses are still lacking and early IV zanamivir therapy may benefit patients who are most at risk. 15 Study limitations include a small sample size due to the rare occurrence of prolonged influenza virus excretion, which does not permit statistical analysis. Additional limitations include technical difficulties of measuring T-cell and ADCC responses, unblinded clinical and outcome assessments by the clinical investigator and incomplete detection of existing antiviral resistance mutations. Despite these limitations, the study provides new insights into the role of host immune responses in determining influenza infection outcomes. Our findings underline the importance of influenza prevention strategies in hematology-oncology patients and show that vaccine improvements are needed to raise immunogenicity in this vulnerable patient group.",

CD8 + T cells and ADCC markers afford clinical protection and combined CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses mediate viral clearance. Pathogenesis of severe viral LRTI and ARDS is likely the result of virus reaching lower compartments of the lung during a lack of combined T-cell-and ADCC-mediated immunological protection followed by excessive immunopathology triggered by innate cell-mediated responses. More insight into the role of influenza host immune responses can improve the clinical management of infected hematology-oncology patients and may limit the emergence of antiviral-resistant viruses.
