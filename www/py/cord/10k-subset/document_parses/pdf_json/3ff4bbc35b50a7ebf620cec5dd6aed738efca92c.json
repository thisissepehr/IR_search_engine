Aberrant expression of Class II major histocompatibility complex molecules was demonstrated immunohistochemically on insulin secreting B cells in 21 out of 23 patients with recent onset disease and 6 of the patients with more prolonged disease. No such expression was seen on glucagon secreting A cells or somatostatin secreting D cells. Islets where there was marked hyperexpression of Class I major histocompatibility complex molecules on islet endocrine cells were seen in all cases in which residual B cells were present. Ninety-two per cent of insulin containing islets but only 1% of insulin deficient islets exhibited this phenomenon (p<0.001, Chi-squared test). There was evidence to suggest that both these abnormalities of major histocompatibility complex expression preceded insulitis within a given islet. They also appeared to be unique to Type I diabetes, being absent in pancreases of patients with Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, graft-versus-host disease and Coxsackie B viral pancreatitis. The development of autoimmunity to B cells in Type I diabetes may be a \"multistep\" process in which abnormalities of major histocompatibility complex expression on islet endocrine cells are crucial events.",

Secondly, there is a marked genetic component to the risk of acquiring the disease which is linked to Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes (HLA-DP -DQ and -DR in man), Thus, up to 98% of all patients with Type 1 diabetes possess either DR3 or DR4 genes [4] .",

T helper lymphocytes, which will initiate an immune response, only recognise the antigen to which they are directed if it is 'presented' to them by a cell expressing the same Class II MHC as themselves. It has been proposed that the initial event in many organ-specific autoimmune diseases may be aberrant expression of Class II MHC by the target cells [5] . If a cell did not normally express Class II MHC on its surface, then any cell specific auto-antigens it may possess would never have been 'presented' to potentially autoreactive T helper lymphocytes. Thus, even though the latter may exist, there would be no immune response. If, however, the cell were induced to express Class Ii MHC, then it may become a functional antigen presenting cell. It may then \"present\" its particular cell surface antigen to potentially autoreactive T helper lymphocytes, which would then initiate an autoimmune response. This hypothesis is particularly attractive because it encompasses the agent linked to the genetic predisposition to Type 1 diabetes -DR typewith an event on the target cell, i. e. aberrant expression of Class II MHC.",

Expression of Class II MHC products, confined to B cells, was initially reported in a single case of recent onset Type I diabetes where fresh frozen autopsy pancreas was available [9] . Recently, with the advent of the monoclonal antibody TAL-1B5, which is capable of detecting a formalin resistant epitope of the alpha-chain of HLA-D molecules [10, 111 , expression of Class II MHC on B cells was seen in pancreases from 12 patients with Type i diabetes [121.

An indirect way of looking at Class I MHC expression in tissue is to study the distribution of beta-2-microglobulin. This protein, which is coded for by a gene on a different chromosome from that which codes for Class I MHC, associates non-covalently with Class I MHC in the plasma membrane [14] . Thus, in addition to studying Class I MHC expression in the diabetic pancreases, the distribution of beta-2-microglobulin was also examined in an attempt to confirm the results. The distribution of immunoperoxidase staining on formalin fixed pancreas and tonsil using the antiserum AI and the antiserum to beta-2-microglobulin as primary antisera was compared to staining on fresh frozen pancreas and tonsil using the same antisera, and also the mouse monoclonal antibody W6/32 (Sera-Lab, Sussex, UK) which recognises all HLA-A and -B antigens [15] .

Double staining for insulin was done using a subsequent 4-h incubation of the guinea pig anti-insulin anti-serum followed by a 30-rain incubation in rabbit anti-guinea pig immunoglobulins (Dako). Finally, there was a 30 min incubation with fluorescein conjugated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Scottish Antibody Production Unit, Carluke, UK). Repeated washings were done between steps using tris buffered saline. Double staining for Class I and II MHC and other pancreatic hormones utilised the same method up to the development with diaminobenzidine.

Thus, in the islets only the endothelial cells were stained, while in exocrine tissue occasional ducts were positive but acini were generally negative. There was almost undetectable staining for Class I M H C antigens on islet endocrine cells using the antiserum AI. Endothelial cells and nerve fibres were strongly positive, but the exocrine tissues stained relatively weakly (Fig. 2 ). Tables t and 2 give the results of the analysis of islet staining on 3 consecutive serial sections from each case stained for Class I M H C , insulin and Class II M H C respectively. The degree of expression of Class I M H C on islet endocrine cells and the presence or absence of insulin in an islet could be assessed fairly confidently on single sections of tissue stained for the respective antigens. However, aberrant Class II M H C expression on endocrine cells and the presence of an inflammatory infiltrate could be quite focal within an islet, and the presence of these was liable to be underestimated ff only one section from each case was examined. Thus, three cases [8, 12, 19] were chosen for more detailed study on the basis that blocks were available and that the phenomena under investigation were present. For-ty serial sections were cut from one of the several pancreatic blocks available for each case and the middle two sections stained for Class I M H C products and in-sulin respectively. The remaining sections were stained for Class II M H C products. From this, the presence of focal insulitis, or infrequent aberrant expression of Class II MHC on endocrine cells, could be assessed for any islet identified on the middle two sections. The results of this analysis are given in Table 3 . ",

In islets where this was present, there was not only increased cytoplasmic staining but a/so considerable accentuation in the region of the plasma membrane of cells. Class I MHC hyperexpression was present in all 31 patients with residual insulin containing islets. Furthermore, it was found in 2517 out of 2744 such islets (92%) but was only seen in 82 out of 6842 insulin deficient islets (1%, p < 0.001 Chi-squared test) ( Table 1 ). The pattern of staining when two adjacent serial sections were stained with the antisera directed against Class I MHC heavy chain (AI) and beta-2-microglobulin, respectively, was identical. In contrast to the findings with Class II MHC expression, all the endocrine cells in a given insulin containing islet appeared to hyperexpress Class I MHC. This was confirmed by double stains for Class I MHC and the re-spective hormones (Figs.7, 8) . Thus, it appeared that when glucagon secreting A cells and somatostatin secreting D cells were adjacent to B cells in an insulin containing islet in this disease they hyperexpressed Class I MHC, but when they were physically divorced from B cells, in an insulin deficient islet, they ceased to hyperexpress Class I MHC.

The \"whole\" islet study of a single representative block of each case showed that 44% of insulin containing islets were inflammed and insulitis was in fact present in case 12.

However, comparison between the results in Table 1 and Table 3 shows that the frequency of hyperexpression of Class I MHC by insulin containing islets could be accurately estimated from a single section. The explanation for the disparity is that insulitis and aberrant expression of Class II MHC can be quite focal within an islet and that maximum accuracy of the frequency of these phenomena in Type 1 diabetes can only be obtained by study of \"whole\" islets.

Equally, the abnormalities of MHC expression are not thought to be the result of the metabolic derangements of diabetes since they were not seen in the pancreases of patients with Type 2 diabetes or of the two young patients with cystic fibrosis who were diabetic.",

In keeping with this observation has been the demonstration that interferon-gamrna caused isolated B cells from pre-diabetic BB/E rats to express Class II MHC in vitro [24] . B cells from normal Wistar rats did not exhibit this phenomenon in culture. This suggests that there may be a genetic abnormality of control of Class II MHC expression by B cells in these animals. A similar genetic abnormality of control of Class II MHC expression by B cells may be crucial in the pathogenesis of Type 1 diabetes in man. In the human pancreatic isograft study described by Sibley et al. [25] , B cells genetically identical to those of the diabetic twins were destroyed within weeks of transplant by an islet infiltrate which included T lymphocytes. These inflammatory cells would be expected to be secreting interferon-gamma (immunosuppression was not given in 3 of the 4 patients studied). In spite of this, Class II MHC expression was not seen in B cells in the transplanted pancreases. This suggests that interferon-gamma may not be able to cause human B cells to express Class II MHC even when they are genetically identical to those of a patient with Type 1 diabetes.",

The intriguing aspect of the phenomenon of hyperexpression of Class I MHC in insulin containing islets was that A and D cells in these islets also hyperexpressed these molecules. One possible explanation for this finding would be that the B cells in islets in which Class I hyperexpression was observed were secreting a substance which had a paracrine effect on the adjacent A and D cells, causing them also to hyperexpress Class I MHC. Candidates for this role might include interferon-alpha and -beta. Both these interferons have been shown to cause hyperexpression of Class I MHC on pancreatic endocrine cells in vitro [18] . A common stimulus for release of these substances from epithelial and connective tissue cells is viral infection. A B-cell specific, non-cytopathic viral infection could also be a possible candidate for causing aberrant Class II MHC expression by these cells in a genetically predisposed host. Recently it has been shown that rat astrocytes expressed Class II MHC products in vitro following non-infective interaction with a murine neurotropic coronavirus [26] .",
