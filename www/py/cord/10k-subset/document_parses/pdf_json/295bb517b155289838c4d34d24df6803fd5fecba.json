Large amount of immune suppressors taken after the transplant damaged their vitality, Spleen and Kidney even more, deteriorating their weak body resistance. Especially when \"exterior evil\" invaded, they were apt to get ill, inviting all sorts of bacteria (including existing opportunistic disease-causing microbes within the hosts\" bodies) and viruses invading them, which often caused infections on all parts of the body to develop into systemic inflammatory response syndrome, or even severe pyemia <7) . This was one of the main causes of complications and death of post-kidney-transplant patients. Lung infection, which most frequently occurred fell into the category of \"acute febrile disease\" in Chinese medicine system. The first phase of the illness shows lung symptoms of fever, slight adversion to cold, cough and mild thirstiness. In post-kidney-transplant patients, due to the use of immune suppressors, initial lung infection symptoms are not so obvious, as physical signs are concealed. Once fever develops, it is already in the sever phase, and cases with sin-gle exterior signs are rarely observed, just like our studied group which shows there was no case with single signs. Because their Spleen and Stomach were damaged which could not carry, transport and convert retention of water, and so in them may appear listlessness and sticky tongue coating, little or no appetite, epigastric fullness, slimy and greasy feeling in the mouth, etc. Treatment of such signs should concentrate on clearing away heat and toxic materials, as well as invigorating the Spleen to eliminate dampness. Laboratory test showed that \"Pneumonia ]][\" prescription clears away heat and toxic materials by increasing blood neutrophilic granulocyte phagocytic index and blood plasma total complementary level, and enhances the body's ability of fighting infection by strengthening the body resistance and eliminating pathogenic factors ~8) . And that is why we chose \"Pneumonia ]][\" as our baseline principle for our modified recipes.",

Macroscopically, according to TCM diagnosis and treatment on the basis of an overall analysis of the illness and the patient's condition, if the patients show such blood stasis symptoms as petechia, ecchymosi, gargling without the desire to swallow when feeling thirsty, cyanotic lips, dark tongue, etc., showing blood stasis syndomes, herbs that promote blood circulation to dispel blood stasis should be used. When the organic tissues are infected, symptoms of inflammation would be tissue hyperaemia, swollen, and later would turn to effusion, degeneration, necroses, atrophia, hyperplasia and other pathological changes. These are blood stasis symptoms on the microscopic level. Clinical and laboratorial test results showed that patients whose main infection is blood endotoxin syndrome MODS/MSOF had various levels of disturbance in peripheral microcirculation. Especially when clinical signs show low blood platelet, subnormal laboratorial test reading (prothrombin time, activated pactiai thrombopilastin time, TT lengthened, FIB decreased), the patients can be considered microscopically as having blood stasis symptoms of severe infection. The pathologic physiological changes are diffusive intravascular coagulation. This is a more sensitive and reliable indication than blood stasis macroscopic symptoms ~9~ . For this reason, the curative effect could be increased by using herbs that promote blood circulation to dispel blood stasis at the early stage when infected patients were not showing any macroscopic blood stasis. We did use herbs like red sage root before patients showed blood stasis symptom.",
