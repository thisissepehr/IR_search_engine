Some of these include adjusting for individual follow-up time, repeated measurements of multiple outcomes and missing data among others. Furthermore, pre-specifying appropriate analysis becomes difficult as some safety endpoints are unexpected. Although existing guidelines such as CONSORT encourage thorough reporting of adverse events (AEs) in clinical trials, they provide limited details for safety data analysis. The limited guidelines may influence suboptimal analysis by failing to account for some analysis challenges above. A typical example where such challenges exist are trials of anti-malarial drugs for malaria prevention during pregnancy. Lack of proper standardized evaluation of the safety of antimalarial drugs has limited the ability to draw conclusions about safety. Therefore, a systematic review was conducted to establish the current practice in statistical analysis for preventive antimalarial drug safety in pregnancy.",

However, there is scant literature on standardized ways to statistically analyse the safety outcomes in clinical trials. Although there exist some general regulatory guidelines on safety data analysis, such as International Conference on Harmonization which recommend descriptive statistical methods supplemented by confidence intervals [3, 4] , the proposed statistical methods rarely account for the complexity of the collected safety data, e.g., recurrent adverse events (AEs). Effective solutions to statistical analysis of safety data in clinical trials may need to be tailored to specific indications (set of diseases with similar characteristics) since safety data collected are also influenced by the medical condition under study. Absence of standardized guidelines for safety data analysis in specific settings may limit the ability to draw rich conclusions about the safety of the investigational product, based on collected data. Standardized guidelines can simplify integration of safety information from multiple outcomes across RCTs [5] and would ensure optimal use of data in developing the safety profile of the investigational product.",

The safety endpoints may be correlated within patients and over time such that failure to account for this in an analysis may yield biased estimates and false inference. Furthermore, time to occurrence of the safety endpoint may be very informative in profiling the drug safety. Such data present statistical analysis and interpretation challenges due to the complexity in structure [6] .

Occurrence of (even mild) AEs due to a drug would lead to non-adherence, leading to informative censoring. The dropping of the patients from the study generates missing data that may lead to biased results if poorly accounted for. Therefore, safety data analysis accounting for missing data is useful to facilitate identification and characterization of the safety profile of the drug as early as possible. Other analysis challenges include lack of adequate ascertainment and classification of AEs, and limited generalizability of results [9] since some AEs cannot be pre-specified at study design stage.",

One of the special settings in safety data assessment is the use of drugs to prevent adverse outcomes in pregnancy, currently referred to as intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp). For example, the World Health Organization recommends that pregnant women receive routine treatment with anti-malarial drugs to clear any malaria infection that is present and also to prevent infection in the weeks after administration [10] . Recent review indicates that methodological issues in studying antimalarial drugs in pregnancy have prevented firm conclusions on the safety of new anti-malarial drugs in pregnancy [11] . Previous efforts have attempted to standardize safety assessment methodology for antimalarial drug trials in pregnancy, including study designs and data collection [12, 13] . However, literature remains limited in describing the standard practice in the statistical analysis of safety data that are collected on anti-malarial drugs during pregnancy trials.",

The following key variables were extracted from the papers: main author, publication date, study design, study location, main efficacy outcome, sample size, list of safety parameters collected (including laboratory data), nature of safety data collection (i.e., passive or active), list of statistical methods used for respective safety outcomes, how the results were presented, retention rate at the end of the follow up and how missing safety or efficacy data were handled. The primary hypothesis type (as superiority, non-inferiority or equivalence) was defined based on what was reported in the actual manuscript or inferred by the lead author (NP), based on how the study framed the primary hypothesis. Superiority hypotheses aim to show whether treatment is better than control, non-inferiority hypotheses intend to show that one treatment is not worse than the other and equivalence hypotheses intend to show that a given treatment is similar to another for defined characteristics [16] . The statistical methods were classified as descriptive or inferential and univariate or multivariate depending on the purpose and nature of the statistical methods based on previous similar reviews [17, 18] , reviewing statistical methods.",

The results demonstrate that there is limited reporting of statistical analyses of safety data, at the end of the trial, in these published reports. The findings are useful to advance the development of standardized guidelines for safety data statistical analysis in analysis in anti-malarial drugs in pregnancy trials and related fields. Such guidelines will not replace but rather complement the CON-SORT guidelines that are general (i.e., not providing specific statistical methods in analysing harms in RCTs). Based on the authors' knowledge of the available literature, this is the first paper to review statistical methods for safety data in anti-malarial drugs in pregnancy. Descriptive methods were commonly used to summarize safety data. This review found that each clinical trial used at least one descriptive method to summarize safety data. Univariate statistical methods such as Chi square or Fishers exact tests were used in two-thirds of the articles reviewed. Such descriptive statistics and univariate statistical inference ignored useful information such as variability in follow-up time, missing data and correlation (for those trials which had their multiple safety outcomes repeatedly measured). Hence there was inefficient data use during analysis that may lead to a loss of useful information for improved and informative conclusions. Although a third of the reviewed trials attempted to use crude incidence, the analyses failed to adequately account for individual patient follow-up-time and potential confounders.",

Although this aids in providing time-specific drug safety status and easy interpretation, the dichotomized outcome may miss some information on the magnitude of the temporal changes, overtime during the trial. The information loss may lead to reduction in statistical power to detect safety signal if it exists. Valid longitudinal methods (used without restriction on cut-off points) can address the information loss by exploiting potential within-subject correlations for the repeated clinical laboratory measurements [19] [20] [21] . Furthermore, the longitudinal methods can provide the basis for developing improved cut-off points tailored to pregnant women in malaria-specific settings. To ensure improved uptake of such methods, future work needs to strive towards making the results from the longitudinal methods feasibly interpretable to the medical practitioners.",

Adjusting for known prognostic covariates is useful to control for confounding that can be introduced due to imbalance when assessing if treatment is independently associated with safety outcome(s). Of secondary interest, covariate adjustment also preserves type I error [22] . Such adjustment for potential confounders (e.g., age) in safety data analysis are suitable in clinical trials with at least moderate sample size, unlike small sample sizes that lead to unstable estimates. Of specific interest in this review, the Poisson model was more suitable in the context of rare AEs which usually have low event rates [21, 23] . Since Poisson regression assumes a constant rate of occurrence of a rare event, it is not ideal for other multiple transient AEs that were common or recurred and would vary in occurrence overtime [24] . Alternatively, mixed effects models could be considered to characterize the safety events over time since they capture patient-specific effects [25, 26] . Whenever time to AE occurrence information is available, survival analysis models may also be preferred to characterize the time to AE occurrence. For recurrent safety events, that may induce dependence, methods that extend the Cox regression model may be preferred; such models include survival mixed effects models (e.g., frailty models) [4] .",

If per protocol analysis is used to address non-adherence there is potential selection bias since it destroys the balance due to randomization. Although CONSORT recommends ITT, as an alternative for analysis of safety endpoints, non-adherence cannot be explicitly addressed with ITT approach since it ignores dropouts, withdrawal or loss-to-follow up for various reasons including safety concerns; ITT-based inference ignores causal effect of the actual treatment received [27] . Patient withdrawal or dropout due to AEs can induce informative censoring useful in quantifying anti-malarial drug safety. For example, if a patient withdraws due to vomiting after taking an anti-malarial drug, their obstetric efficacy outcomes such as birth weight may appear as missing data. In the context of anti-malarial drug for malaria prevention, even mild AE can lead to drug nonadherence. Since the patient has no disease symptoms, they would judge it less costly for them to discontinue the drug than continue experiencing AEs. Hence, inclusion of information on treatment/trial completion status in relation to anti-malarial safety would enrich development of the safety profile of anti-malarial drug in pregnancy. Although study completion status, anti-malarial drug safety and missing data may be interlinked, missing data received limited attention such that the few trials that considered efficacy missing data did not explicitly explore the potential link. Studying such complex associations requires statistical methods that can appropriately estimate the pathway from the anti-malarial chemoprevention to study completion. Advantageously, methods based on causal inference framework, such as mediation analysis [28] [29] [30] [31] could be adapted/extended to assess the influence of the AEs on non-adherence in RCTs.",

Use of confidence interval aids in interpretation of results by providing a measure of precision. Furthermore, graphical displaying of safety data to aid in summarizing of safety data was inadequate. Graphs on safety data have a greater ability to convey insight about patterns, trends, or anomalies that may signal potential safety issues compared to presentation of such data in tabular form only [32] . For example, the graphs could help to visualize frequency and changes in AEs over time by treatment arm. The graphs could further help in assessing assumptions for some statistical methods.",

Although the statistical approach for safety assessment was mainly on superiority hypotheses (for both the superiority and non-superiority trials), clinical and statistical justification of assessing safety based on superiority hypotheses may be invalid. Superiority hypotheses concentrate on the absence of difference in drug safety effect/risk between or across the treatment arms which may be challenging [16] . For example, when comparing high AE incidences, non-significant difference (when using a superiority hypothesis) would not necessarily translate to a conclusion that a drug is safe and welltolerated since sometimes all compared treatment arms may have high AE incidence. Perhaps, drug safety evaluation should strive to prove that there is no risk beyond a protocol-defined/hypothesized priori clinical safety margin (i.e., no excessive safety risk). Based on the findings in this work, researchers are encouraged to consider defining safety margins in safety assessment of anti-malarial drugs. Since safety is mostly a secondary outcome, it is not straightforward on how to define a non-inferiority margin and the appropriate analysis population. Currently, it is still unclear and debatable how to implement this, such that further research is needed [5] .",
