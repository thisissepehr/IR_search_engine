In addition, virus could be carried by the particles or droplets and widely spread due to particle dispersion. Recalling the global outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and H1N1 flu in 2009, a great concern of infectious disease transmission through airborne particles in building environments and in small enclosed spaces, such as vehicle and airliner cabins, has been raised (Rothman et al., 2006) . Epidemiologic studies (Buonanno et al., 2013) have proven that health risk associated with particulate matters is subject to the exposure dose which could be represented by the pollutant concentrations. Thus, knowledge about the concentration and distribution of particulate matters in indoor environments is crucial to risk assessment and disease prevention associated with particle exposure.",

            "text": "On the other hand, the Eulerian approach, which treats the dispersed particles as a continuous phase, has gained relatively higher reputation in saving computational cost and simulating pollutant concentration, whilst it cannot predict particle motions or provide particle transport tracks. The Eulerian approach comes with different models depending on the integrality of the description of the gas-particle interactions. During the past years, some simplified Eulerian models have been utilized to model gas-particle flows in indoor environments, including the single fluid model by Zhang and Chen (2007) , the mixture model by Zhao et al. (2008) , and the drift-flux model by Chen et al. (2006) and Zhao et al. (2008) . Zhao et al. (2008) found that when compared with the mixture model, the drift-flux model has better accuracy since more mechanisms such as gravitational settling are included in the latter model. In fact, all of the aforementioned Eulerian models are simplified by assuming the gas-particle mixture as a pseudo fluid whose physical properties are calculated based on the local volume or mass fractions of the two phases. Despite a transport equation is solved for a dimensionless transportable scalar representing the particle concentration in some models, it should be noted that only one set of transport equations are solved for the balance of mass, momentum, and energy of the two phases. This drawback actually makes the inter-phase actions between the phases could not be fully described. Therefore, a more comprehensive Eulerian model which is capable of describing the transport of each phase as well as the inter-phase actions is in demand.",

Being different to the aforementioned Eulerian models, the Eulerian-Eulerian model solves two sets of conservation equations governing the balance of mass, momentum, and energy for each phase. Since the macroscopic fields of one phase are not independent of the other phase, the interaction terms which couple the transport of mass, momentum, and energy across the interfaces are solved in the field equations. The Eulerian-Eulerian model is believed to be capable of leading to a more mechanistic modelling of two-phase flows than the simplified Eulerian models. Although the Eulerian-Eulerian model has rarely been utilized to analyse contaminant transport in indoor environments, it has been widely employed in modelling aerosol (Armand et al., 1998) and other gas-particle flows (Chen and Wang, 2014) . It was found that the Eulerian-Eulerian model is not only more cost-efficient, but also more accurate when the particle concentration is relatively high (Chen and Wang, 2014) .",

            "text": "As demonstrated in our previous study (Li et al., 2013) , when an occupant's thermal plume overlaps with its breathing zone, the thermal plume has a significant effect on the characteristics of particle inhalation. Therefore, in order to create a breathing zone affected the thermal plume in this study, a seated female manikin model with detailed body features (available at www.ie.dtu.dk/manikin) was place in the middle of the room with its back towards the inlet. Detailed information about the manikin geometry could be found in S\u00f8rensen and Voigt (2003) . The original manikin was slightly modified in this study to achieve a surface area of 1.50 m 2 . In terms of the ASHRAE handbook (2013a), the heat release rate from a sedentary human body (by both radiation and convection) with that skin area magnitude is around 85 W. As heat transfer by radiation is not taken into account in this study, a convective heat release rate of 45 W was equally applied at the manikin surface, as recommended by Rim and Novoselac (2009) . Particles with a density of 1000 kg/m 3 and different sizes were released from a circular area with diameter of 0.5 m and located 0.5 m upstream of the manikin so that the particle trajectories could be effectively affected by the thermal plume of the manikin, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . It should be noted that the shape and location of the particle injection area are for computational purpose only and they donot stand for any scenario. The selected particle sizes were 0.2, 0.77, and 2.5 \u03bcm, representing ultrafine, fine, and coarse aerosol particles, respectively. The rate of particle release was 0.1 g/s and the injection velocity was 0.15 m/s. In fact, it was found that the particle velocity dropped immediately after being released so that the particle injection velocity just had an invisible effect on the overall particle trajectories or particle concentration distribution. This is because that for particles with such small sizes, their movement is mainly controlled by the airflow due to the low inertial and gravitational effects (Longest et al., 2004) . Furthermore, comparative computations also demonstrated that even the particle injection rate is as high as 0.1 g/s, the normalized particle concentration pattern is free from the effects of particle injection concentration. This means that for CFD simulations of particulate transport in most indoor environments, it is safe to ignore the effects of particle injection concentration on the overall concentration pattern.",

Fine meshes were used around the manikin surface in order to capture the geometric features and the human thermal plume. The grid sensitivity test proved that mesh independence was achieved at 3.4 million cells for the both models. The Re-Normalisation Group (RNG) k-\u03b5 model was chosen for the airflow turbulence because of its successful utilization in the simulations dilute gas-particle flows (Tu and Fletcher, 1995) . To resolve the boundary layer in the near wall regions, the scalable wall function (Ansys, 2011) was used for the air phase in all the models. Particle deposition was not considered in this study. In the E-L model, the particles are assumed to bounce back with the same momentum magnitude after they collide with the solid walls. However, as the particles are treated as a continuous phase in the E-E model, their bouncing behaviour is hard to be modelled (Tu and Fletcher, 1995) . As an approximation, a free-slip boundary condition was applied at the solid walls for the particle phase in the E-E model. The models were solved by the commercial CFD code CFX 14.5 (Ansys Inc.) and convergence was achieved when the RMS residual of the continuity equation dropped down to 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 .",

The thermal buoyancy flow was so strong that it was the major airflow in the room, besides the airflow near the floor which was induced by the ventilating jet. Salmanzadeh et al. (2012) the airflow in a displacement ventilated room containing a seated thermal manikin, and the predicted thermal plume is illustrated in Fig. 2(b) for the purpose of comparison. It was found that this study predicted a very close pattern of the human thermal plume to that by Salmanzadeh et al.

As shown in Fig. 2 , as the uprising airflow detaches the manikin head, it keeps accelerating until it reaches its maximum velocity. Therefore, the highest speed of thermal plume exists at somewhere above the manikin head. As the thermal plume hits the ceiling, it then changes its direction to horizontally spread. This actually contributes to the temperature stratification in a displacement ventilated room. However, due to the difference in the geometry and boundary conditions such as the ventilating jet direction and velocity, as well as the heat flux at the manikin surface, this study predicted a slightly lower buoyancy flow velocity than that by Salmanzadeh et al.

Air velocity distribution along Line 1 could represent the overall airflow field while the air velocity distribution along the short vertical line could represent the local airflow pattern. It was found that the two models gave very close predictions for the air velocity profile. Especially in the breathing zone ( Fig. 3(b) ), the value difference between the E-E model and E-L model was less than 1%. Rim and Novoselac (2009) once investigated experimentally the airflow field and human thermal plume in a displacement ventilated room containing a seated manikin, which had a very similar setup with the model of this study. The measurements revealed that the air velocity in the bulk region was negligibly small (less than 0.05 m/s), which agreed well with the predictions of this study. As shown in Fig. 3(a) , the models predicted almost quiescent air in the bulk region with air velocity less than 0.02 m/s. Rim and Novoselac (2009) also measured the average thermal plume velocity in a circular plane with 0.25 m diameter above the manikin head using 8 velocity sensors. The experimental data was analysed in this study and an average air velocity of 0.215 m/s was obtained and compared to the numerical results, as shown in Fig. 4 . The area-averaged air velocities in the circular region were found to be 0.201 and 0.203 m/s for the E-E and E-L model, respectively. This small difference (less than 5%) is within the uncertainty of the experimental measurement and computational model Rim and Novoselac (2009) and velocity in the circular region (250 mm in diameter) 250 mm above the manikin head.",

It is clear that the E-E model (Fig. 5(a) ) gives a direct prediction to the particle concentration while the E-L model (Fig. 5(b) ) predicts the particle trajectories (0.77 \u03bcm). Despite this, the overall transport or distribution patterns of the particles predicted by the both models are very close. As the particles approach the manikin, they bend their way upwards due to the buoyancy effect of the thermal plume, then after the particles hit the ceiling, they bend their way again into the horizontal direction, which causes the particles spreading all over the room. Locally, it is important to notice that some of the particles which are released at lower height are entrained into the breathing zone by the thermal plume ( Fig. 5(a) ). The particle concentration in the breathing zone is therefore larger than the ambient concentration. This is consistent with a number of experimental observations that the human thermal plume is capable of increasing the exposure risk of the occupants to particulate contaminants by entraining particles from a lower level into the breathing zone (Bjorn and Nielsen, 2002; Rim and Novoselac, 2009 ).",

It was found that the resultant particle concentration is highly sensitive to both the cell size and the particle trajectory number. At first, the cell size needs to be carefully determined so that an appropriate number of particle trajectories are contained in the each cell. Then, for a given cell division scheme, the number of particle trajectories needs to be tested to obtain an acceptable concentration calculation. For the issue of this study, when the computational domain was divided into 100(X) \u00d7 80(Y) \u00d7 50(Z) cells, sensitivity test proved that 50,000 particle trajectories were sufficient for a stable particle concentration since a further increase to 60,000 trajectories just caused a negligible change in the concentration profile along a randomly selected vertical line, as shown in Fig. 6 . In fact, since the stability of the PSI-C Fig. 6 Sensitivity test of particle trajectory number on particle concentration calculation. method and its resultant particle concentration are not only affected by the trajectory number, but also highly impacted by the cell size, when a quantitative index is absent for the assessment of optimal cell size, it is anything but an easy job to obtain a stable solution.

After the particles are released from the injection area, they follow the airflow and move forward. When approaching the manikin, most of the particles bend their way upwards before reaching the manikin while minority of them go around the manikin and then are brought up by the thermal plume. After the particles approach the ceiling, they bend their way and move horizontally and finally to the whole room. This is consistent with the airflow velocity pattern as illustrated in Fig. 2 . A comparison of Fig. 2 and Fig. 7 reveals that the size of the particle plume, which is the region in which the particle concentration is obviously higher than the ambient concentration, is significantly smaller than that of the thermal plume (Fig. 2) in which the air velocity is higher than the ambient air velocity. Furthermore, the particle plume exists mainly upstream of head-top point where it detaches the manikin. This is physically reasonable since the solid manikin behaves as an obstacle against particle movement, most of the particles have to change their way upward and then were brought further by the uprising airflow and finally detach the manikin before reaching the head-top point. On the other hand, the heat-releasing manikin works as a driving force of the thermal plume, which causes uprising airflow exists mainly on the downstream side. Therefore, in the plane cutting through the manikin (Y = 2.25 m), the particle plume was observed to exist mainly upstream of the head top while the thermal plume exists in a wider area. In the plane of Z = 2.50 m, it was found that the particle transport in horizontal directions was successfully predicted by the both models, although the patterns and the local values of particle concentration yielded from different models were slightly different. Figure 7 also demonstrates that the E-E model and the E-L model yield similar overall particle concentration profiles in the room, and they give significantly different particle concentration prediction in some local areas close to the walls. As shown in Fig. 7(b) , several distinct local regions with high particle concentration were predicted by the E-L model, while the E-E model just predicted a smoothly changing concentration distribution near the walls. It is supposed that this is caused by the different methods employed by the models to describe the particle-wall interactions. In the E-L model, the particles are assumed to bounce back after they hit the wall. This actually enables a near-mechanistic description of particle behaviours in the wall boundary layer. It is physically reasonable that due to uprising airflow caused by the thermal plume, particles close to the ceiling would be pushed back again to the ceiling after they bounce back from it, which would cause particle gathering and lead to higher local particle concentration in some local regions. On the other hand, since particles are treated either as a continuous phase in the E-E model, it is hard to realize an accurate modelling of their actual behaviours such as bouncing-back in the boundary layers. In this study, the E-E model actually failed to achieve a mechanistic modelling of particle-wall interactions and the particle movement in the boundary layer. For the purpose of a mechanistic modelling of gas-particle flows using the Eulerian method, Fletcher (1994, 1995) derived a wall boundary condition for the particulate phase, through which the particle-wall interactions such as the momentum exchange between the particles and the solid walls could be included in the particle momentum equation. This mechanistic method is believed to be promising in improving the Eulerian model for gas-particle flows.",

Line 1 and Line 3 penetrate through the whole computational domain horizontally and vertically respectively, and Line 3 is also located in the thermal plume region; therefore, they could be used to verify both the overall and local particle concentration predictions. It seems that the agreement between the two models increases with increasing particle size up to 2.5 \u03bcm. For the overall particle concentration (Figs. 8(a) , 8(c), and 8(e)), the E-E models predicted obviously higher particle concentration in the bulk region, except the E-L model predicted a higher particle concentration in the area above the manikin head. With increasing particle size, the predicting error of particle concentration in the bulk region decreases. However, the E-L model still gave a higher prediction than the E-E model. It is supposed that the peak distribution of particle concentration is caused by the PSI-C algorithm which actually deals with the particle resident time. Comparatively, the particle concentration profiles predicted by the models along Line 3 agree better with each other and the agreement for coarse and fine particles is better than that for ultra-fine particles. This is especially true for regions close to the walls. However, as experimental data is unavailable at this moment to validate the models, it's hard to tell which model behaves better for ultra-fine particles. Further research is still needed.",
