            "text": "Mycobacterium bovis, the bacterium responsible for causing bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle, displays what I call 'microbial performativity'. Like many other lively disease-causing microorganisms, it has an agency which is difficult to contain, and there is a need for fresh thinking on the challenges of dealing with this slippery and indeterminate microbe. As a practising veterinary scientist who side-stepped mid-career into a parallel training in the social sciences to view bTB from an alternative perspective, I create an interdisciplinary coming-together where veterinary science converges with a political ecology of (animal) health influenced by science and technology studies (STS) and social science and humanities scholarship on performativity. This suitably hybridized nexus creates a place to consider the ecologies of a pathogen which could be considered as life out of control. I consider what this means for efforts to eradicate this disease through combining understandings from the published scientific literature with qualitative interview-based fieldwork with farmers, veterinarians and others involved in the statutory bTB eradication programme in a high incidence region of the UK. This study demonstrates the value of life scientists turning to the social sciences to review their familiar professional habitus-challenging assumptions, and offering alternative perspectives on complex problems.",

The disease is present in many parts of the world in both farmed livestock and wildlife reservoirs (Humblet et al. 2009; Hlokwe et al. 2014; Rivi\u00e8re et al. 2014) . Although the majority of the Member States of the European Union (EU) are officially tuberculosis free, some EU countries continue to have endemic bovine disease, with the United Kingdom (UK) heading the list. Multiple risk factors for disease in cattle, badgers and other mammals in the UK have been identified (Broughan et al. 2016 ), but ongoing arguments over whether removing (often known as 'culling') the wildlife reservoir of badgers (Meles meles) in bovine high incidence areas is scientifically and ethically justifiable attract most attention (Woodroffe et al. 2016; Brunton et al. 2017; McCulloch and Reiss 2017) .",

The disease is therefore a well-known zoonosis, but the ongoing potential of M. bovis to infect (and kill) humans in the twenty-first century may be underestimated (Olea-Popelka et al. 2017; World Health Organization 2017) . European Union legislation requires eradication of the disease (Council Directive 77/391/EEC) to facilitate the trade of animals and animal products (Council Directive 64/432/EEC), and the European Commission has previously emphasized that ''EU strategy is not intended primarily to support control programmes but is focused on the achievement of the total eradication of bovine TB'' (European Commission 2013, p. 4 ; emphasis mine). This is not therefore an accommodation or living-with microbes and disease, but an aspiration towards complete removal of the pathogen; killing, not tolerating. Ginn et al. (2014, p. 113) , discussing awkward nonhuman others, suggest that sometimes ''creatures \u2026 die so that others may live''. For bTB, cattle and badgers have been killed in their thousands in the UK to reduce disease incidence over many years. Positive cattle, detected primarily through injecting avian and bovine tuberculin into the neck skin of cattle and measuring comparative immunological responses after 72 h (de la Rua-Domenech et al. 2006) , are compulsorily removed to slaughter with compensation by the State. Badger removal, begun in England in the 1970s to prevent transmission to cattle, continues in some parts of England as part of the national disease eradication strategy (DEFRA 2014; Brunton et al. 2017) .",

            "text": "In one region of the UK-Northern Ireland (N. Ireland)-the bTB eradication programme began in earnest in 1959 with full legislative support (Robinson 2015) , but even with one of the most sophisticated bTB control systems in the world, involving a large cadre of private and state veterinarians carrying out intensive, sustained cattle testing and removal over many years, disease eradication remains elusive. Like Sisyphus in Homer's Odyssey, forever pushing the boulder to the brim of the hill only for it to roll to the bottom again (Homer 1946, p. 155) , bTB just keeps on coming back. Although present in only a minority of herds at any given time [herd incidence 9.61% in 2017 (DAERA 2018) ], dealing with this problem is expensive, and cost the state \u00a3317 M (US$ 449 M) in N. Ireland between 1996 and The bacteria perform, but also cause other actors, both human and more-thanhuman, to perform in tandem, often causing confusion and destabilization, challenging the expertise of the human actors involved in disease control. Particularly relevant here is Schuurman and Franklin's (2015, p. 23 ) notion of ''counterperformance'', namely ''resistance in a situation where it has the potential to disturb the performance or transform it''. Extending conceptually beyond the consideration of counterperformance in animal-human relations takes the social theory of performance and performativity into the realm of the pathobiology and epidemiology of animal infection and disease. Third, the paper also demonstrates the value of natural scientists using STS as a medium to trace and examine ''actors and actions involved across different social worlds'' (Engel 2012, p. 54) . In doing so, they can re-view themselves, their actions, policies, and literatures through a different (socio-political and -cultural) lens, testing long-held assumptions, and offering alternative solutions to complex scientific and socio-technical problems.",

To adapt Hird (2009, p. 26) , ''I am schooled in recognizing my meetings with bacteria as military encounters-invasion.\u2026 defence [and detection] \u2026. That is, the pathogen matrix overwhelmingly defines the parameters of animal meetings-with bacteria''. Despite criticism of framing disease with the language of war, especially following Sontag's Illness as Metaphor essay (1979), my positionality as a former veterinary officer of the state means I struggle to detach myself from viewing the microbe martially as invader and 'non-self' rather than friend or 'self' (Stoller 2012) . It is to be repelled and removed, rather than accepted and accommodated, but, as this paper will demonstrate, there are profound challenges inherent in attempting to discipline microbes (Ingram 2007) , and militaristic framings of disease control are themselves performative, of which more will be said later.",

Austin's focus was on utterances or speech acts which were ''doing something rather than just saying something'' (Austin 1970 (Austin [1961 , p. 235, emphasis in original). The concept has been developed and its scope expanded and widely diversified over the intervening years to be applied across the social sciences (see Thrift and Dewsbury 2000; Loxley 2008; Faulkner 2012) . The key point is that it is not solely words (Austin 1975 (Austin [1962 ) that can be performative, and the emphasis on doing in performativity is the particular concern of this paper. This follows Pickering (1995, p. 21) in bringing ''the performances-the doings-of \u2026 material agency \u2026 to the fore''.

How the horse behaves in response to the exercise of control by the trainer reflects positively or negatively on the expertise of the trainer. Notably, they delineate when the horse performs ''acts of resistance which are inconsequential to the overall performance and those which are capable of destabilising the performance' ' (2015, p. 23) . If the successful performance of statutory disease control involves eradicating a bacterium, then the power of a microbe to disrupt and destabilize not just animal bodies, but also the perceived veterinary and political expertise of the state, is worthy of further investigation.",

In considering these multiplicities, I focus on what the bacterium does, recognizing that ''performativity \u2026 involves the saturation of performances and performers with power'' (Gregson and Rose 2000, p. 441) . This focus provides a way to ''unlock and animate new \u2026 potentialities'' of the nonhuman (Thrift and Dewsbury 2000, p. 411) , and brings to the fore the everyday practices (Thrift, 1997) of a bacterium. This allows us to ''examine the reality of [M. bovis] as an outcome of multiple performances that overlap and depend upon one another'' (Robins 2012, p. 188) . These overlaps are important, for Dewsbury (2000, p. 476 ) posits that ''performativity is about connection. One asks what something does, and how in its doing, or being thus, it connects with other things, digresses boundaries instigating new ones, whilst rejecting, separating, and recomposing others''. I bring performativity into the sphere of agricultural economy, and argue that this study of the entanglement between nature and culture (Harrison et al. 2004 ) and ''nature performed'' (Szerszynski et al. 2003) , draws an under-rated actor from the shadows and into the spotlight. M. bovis, somewhat ironically, is often overlooked and forgotten by the stakeholders charged with, and deeply involved in, efforts to eradicate bTB.",

I argue that, as a living biological organism, M. bovis has a ''vital materiality'' (Gregson et al. 2010) which resonates with Shaw's (2012, p. 613) suggestion that objects are ''force-full''-''smouldering furnaces of affects that are capable of creating, policing, and destroying the very contours of existence''. I do not ascribe intentional agency to the bacterium, but agency nonetheless, an agency which is perhaps akin to the ''small agency'' of Darwin's observations on earthworms: ''Darwin describes the activities of worms as one of many 'small agencies' whose accumulated effects turn out to be quite big'' (Bennett 2010, p. 96) . Or, to follow another line of argument, the ''material semiotics'' of Law and Mol (2010, p. 58 ) allows intentionality and agency to be prised apart, and this bacterium can be regarded as an actor in the bTB network providing it makes ''a perceptible difference''. The key point here is to consider the network of humans and nonhumans collectively, for as Sayes (2014, p. 144 ) aptly puts it, ''nonhumans do not have agency by themselves, if only because they are never by themselves''. Even natural scientists recognize that bacteria and other microorganisms are social beings which form associations (Federle and Bassler 2003; Brown and Buckling 2008) . Latour (2000, p. 116) suggests that ''microbes \u2026 are utterly uninterested in what human scientists have to say about them'', but to re-present M. bovis and re-focus on it as the central actor in bTB, I use the literatures of the natural scientists who research and describe the organism in the field and laboratory, and combine these veterinary literatures with empirical interview material. The interview data come from sixty individual and two focus-group interviews of individuals and groups of cattle farmers, veterinarians (private and state), and scientists involved with bTB in N. Ireland. These interviewees were asked about why they thought the Northern Irish programme had not yet achieved its original objective of eradication of the disease. Some were purposively selected through personal contact networks from my former employments as both private and state veterinarian in N. Ireland, and others through 'snowball' sampling (Noy 2008 ) the contacts of other veterinarians and farmers known to the author or through farming and veterinary gatekeepers. The interviews were semi-structured in format and were recorded with consent between September 2012 and May 2013, before full transcription and analysis using a grounded theory approach (Glaser and Strauss 2008) . The overall aim was to elucidate experiences and knowledge of bTB in both high and low incidence areas within N. Ireland, and from both expert and lay perspectives.",

As Fleck (1979 Fleck ( [1935 ) demonstrates, both 'popular' and 'journal' science can merge to generate scientific fact, and the merit of this approach to gain a range of both overlapping and contradictory opinions has been demonstrated in previous research on infectious diseases (Wallmann 1998; Wright and Nerlich 2006; Washer 2011; Jee et al. 2015) . Performances require an audience, and audiences make observations on what they see and experience in the laboratory and the field. Dewsbury (2000, p. 475) states that ''the potential the performative etches out for refusal, fracture, and torsion is set within specific sites [emphasis in original]''. The agency of M. bovis within animal bodies is particularly relevant in the consideration of bTB, but I begin this section by considering M. bovis' performances in the material 'stuff' in which it lives and moves and has its being outside of the cattle who are the primary hosts of the bacterium, specifically in faeces, nasal secretions, milk and aerosols. We see here an agency of environmental resilience in varying sites and in different forms which distinguishes M. bovis as a difficult-to-kill pathogen, both inside and outside of its mammalian hosts. Moore (1913, p. 99) , in discussing the control of bTB through the early detection and removal of affected cattle, emphasizes that ''tubercle bacteria must not be allowed to escape from any infected individual''. Accepting that 'open' cases will allow bacteria to escape, he goes on to suggest that thorough disinfection of the cattle accommodation was one of the most important factors to consider in the eradication of the disease. Mycobacteria have unique cell walls which make them resistant to most antibiotics, and difficult to kill with chemical disinfectants (Scanlon and Quinn 2000) . The cell wall also protects the bacterium from drying out, and it can survive for periods of weeks or months in the environment, the period dependent on ambient temperatures and exposure to sunlight (Menzies and Neill 2000) . The cell walls of mycobacteria such as M. bovis are incredibly thick, and act as very efficient permeability barriers (Hoffmann et al. 2008 ). This gives the bacterium an aura of indestructibility, acknowledged by this research scientist:",

Infected animals excrete M. bovis in their faeces, possibly due to bacilli from lesions in the lung being swept up the trachea in mucus and swallowed. Schroeder and Cotton (1907) estimated that one diseased cow passed as many as 38 million tubercle bacilli in one day in 13 kg of faeces. Scanlon and Quinn (2000) suggest that M. bovis organisms may survive for up to 6 months in slurry, and this infected slurry may then be spread on land as fertilizer, contaminating pastures as well as slurry storage tanks. Nasal secretions from infected cattle have also been found to contain M. bovis (de Kantor and Roswurm 1978) , and these mucoid secretions are thought to contain the organisms from three months after infection as the animal begins to shed (Neill et al. 1991) . The micro-environment of the bovine nasal cavity is a suitable place for bacterial multiplication: ''It's dark, warm and moist \u2026 it provides a good spot for it to grow'' (Int A33, research scientist). Contaminated faecal ingestion is thought to be a rare source of infection in cattle (Menzies and Neill 2000) , but nasal secretions shared through close bodily encounters may be more important as a means of transmission (Neill et al. 1989; Cassidy et al. 1999) .",

            "text": "In addition to environmental presence linked to cattle excretion, M. bovis is also present in the excretions of other bTB-infected creatures. King et al. (2015) have used qPCR techniques to quantify M. bovis environmental presence in badger faeces, which may act as a source of infection for cattle at pasture. Even the humble earthworm has been demonstrated to ingest and move the bacteria from cattle faecal deposits, and perceivably could infect badgers through ingestion (Barbier et al. 2016) . Deer, another recognized wildlife host of M. bovis, may also contaminate the environment and act as a vehicle of indirect transmission for cattle (Johnson et al. 2008 )-their excretions into the environment are known to contaminate livestock feed and infect cattle in the USA (Palmer et al. 2004) . Moore (1913) stated that there was considerable doubt about whether cattle were more often infected through the respiratory or digestive tracts. Perceived scientific wisdom in the twenty-first century suggests that the most important and significant mobility of M. bovis is its carriage through the air in minute watery droplets of respiratory fluid-aerosol exhaled by diseased animals-coughed up in expulsions from the depths of the lungs. Just like the asbestos disturbed and released in demolition work to produce ''an airborne dance of inextinguishable fibres'' (Gregson et al. 2010 (Gregson et al. , p. 1067 , so the violent eruptions from the bovine respiratory tract release M. bovis in probably its most deadly form. Inhalation of these droplets in the air is thought to be the most common form of transmission of infection between cattle (Pollock and Neill 2002) , and is also considered the main route of infection for badgers . Gannon et al. (2007) demonstrated in a laboratory study that M. bovis is robust in its airborne state, with 94% of bacilli surviving the first 10 min after aerosolization, and they concluded that once airborne, it can survive for prolonged periods. Such is the potency of M. bovis as an agent of disease, that only one colony-forming-unit (CFU), containing 6-10 viable bacilli, is required to initiate successful infection by the respiratory route (Dean et al. 2005) . Many more bacilli are thought to be necessary to initiate bovine infection through ingestion (Menzies and Neill 2000) .",

All of this materiality becomes subject to the legislative biopolitical control of the state if suspected of containing M. bovis-slurry can be stored on farm, and restrictions placed on where it can be spread on pasture; animal accommodation and facilities are required to be cleansed and disinfected; animals are isolated to prevent contact of excretions with others; milk is discarded from infected animals and prevented from entering the food chain. But to adopt true significance and being, to exert its most important effects from its various environmental performativities, the organisms must be inhaled (or ingested) by another animal. The rod-shaped bacterium does indeed have a damaging ''colonising materiality'' (Gregson, 2012 (Gregson, , p. 2016 ) with a wide host range and flexibility, but it produces contrasting views between veterinarians on how dangerous that tendency to colonize may be:",

Unlike Gregson's (2011, p. 151 ) engagements with the dust, fumes and smoke of ship breaking, which enabled her to ''know this corporeally, in the throat, skin and fabric'', the bacteria are carried unseen and without recognition down the trachea and into the depths of the lungs through bronchi and then bronchioles to reach the alveoli. The alveoli are the normal site of gaseous exchange to oxygenate the blood and expel carbon dioxide, but now they become the scene of immunological warfare, as the 'innate' and 'acquired' immune responses of the host seeks to defeat the microbial invader (Pollock and Neill 2002; Gupta et al. 2012 ). The frontline defence from the host are cells called macrophages (literally 'big eaters' from the Greek), and they engulf the bacilli to seek to destroy them. Interplay between cells is sparked by chemical messengers called cytokines as they summon help and enhance the capacity of macrophages to kill the invading nonself. Neutrophils, natural killer cells and more macrophages migrate across the blood vessels to join the attack (Gupta et al. 2012) . Bactericidal gases such as nitrous oxide are released as part of the panoply of host defences. If the initial infection cannot be repelled, the acquired immune response kicks in after a number of days, and T-cells (also known as lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell) are recruited, with these cells forming the basis of immunological memory to providing defence if the invader is encountered again in the future as well as attack in the present (Pollock and Neill 2002) .",

The tuberculin test remains controversial, mistrusted and disliked by farmers and sometimes by veterinarians as well (Enticott 2012) . False positives to the test (unconfirmed at slaughter or in the laboratory) decrease farmers' confidence in the expertise of the vet and the diagnostic process.

Farmers often have anecdotes about such cases: I have seen us testing and getting clear in the test and having 3 cattle\u2026 we tested on a Monday and Tuesday.\u2026 and killed [them] the following week on the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and there was one animal down with bTB each day (Int A7, beef farmer).

Similarly, co-infection with bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is thought to compromise diagnostic tests, and also may potentiate susceptibility and onward transmission of infection through immunosuppression (Monies 2000; Kao et al. 2007 ). It appears that M. bovis is more 'nomad' than 'monad' when it comes to its inter-relations with other microbial species (Attenborough 2010) . Given that infection with both liver fluke and BVDV is widespread in British cattle herds, there is cause for concern, although further investigation is required to elucidate the risks (Byrne et al. 2016 (Byrne et al. , 2017 .",

It is though a blunt instrument of detection, bearing in mind that an animal may only have one small lesion, causing many infected animals to be missed (Corner et al. 1990 ). Even in the laboratory the organism is difficult to detect from tissue samples extracted at slaughter, and Medeiros et al. (2012) suggest the need for a combined approach of multiple laboratory techniques including bacteriology, histopathology, molecular and immunological detection methods to find all infected animals due to the range of stages of infection at presentation. Gallagher and Horwill (1977, p. 155) described bacteriological culture of the organism, and noted that M. bovis was a ''fastidious'' organism which ''grew very poorly'' in the laboratory.

The significance of the badger in the spread of M. bovis in the UK and Ireland, and what to do about it, has caused much controversy both within scientific discourse, and between farmers and veterinarians ('the industry') and sceptical publics. Grant (2009) describes the inability to eradicate bTB from the English and Welsh cattle herds as an ''intractable, long-term policy failure'', and chronicles the succession of government review committees and reports on the subject over decades, particularly on the question of what to do about the badger. The vaccination of badgers against bTB with bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG-a derivative of virulent M. bovis) is one option and is used in some parts of the UK and Ireland as part of a long-term strategy to reduce both badger and cattle incidence (Robinson et al. 2012; Aznar et al. 2018) . Badger culling has been used at various times in England since the early 1970s depending on state policy (McCulloch and Reiss 2017), but is much more politically charged than vaccination. The largest field experiment ever conducted-the Randomized Badger Culling Trial (RBCT)-was led by a specially convened panel of scientists (known as the Independent Scientific Group on bovine TB-ISG) and the trial cost some \u00a349M ($65M) (Cassidy 2015) . This massive expenditure failed to stem the argument at both scientific and policy levels about whether to continue to cull badgers, or to refocus on cattle-to-cattle transmission. Whilst the ISG's final report on the RBCT supported the belief that badgers transmitted bTB to cattle, the overall conclusion was that ''badger culling cannot meaningfully contribute to the control of cattle TB in Britain'' (Bourne et al. 2007, p. 181) . This conclusion provoked a storm of protest, dissent and counter-argument. The British Government's Chief Scientific Officer disagreed with the conclusion that culling was no longer a valid option, stating that ''the removal of badgers could make a significant contribution to the control of cattle TB in those areas of England where there is a high and persistent incidence'' (King 2007) . From Ireland, More et al. (2009) questioned the RBCT evidence which suggested that perturbation of badgers caused by culling increased the risk of cattle further bTB breakdowns. Irish research suggested that badger culling was indeed a valid and effective means of reducing disease incidence in both cattle and badgers, in conflict with the British research conclusions (Olea-Popelka et al. 2009 ). The most recent epidemiological analysis of the current industry-led culling policy in England suggests it may have a beneficial effect on reducing cattle incidence (Brunton et al. 2017) , but the controversy is likely to continue.",

We have seen how the material environmental and bodily performativities of the organism are varied and diffuse, but I would suggest that the epidemiological performances of the bacterium are most surprising of all. Whilst M. bovis is primarily a pathogen of cattle, there are surprising spillovers of infection, exhibiting a much wider potential host range than M. tuberculosis, its human-hosted counterpart (Allen 2017) . For example, in the past decade infection has been reported in the British Isles in a dog (Shrikrishna et al. 2009 ), sheep (van der Burgt et al. 2012 , goats (Daniel et al. 2009 ), alpacas (Connolly et al. 2008) , cats (Roberts et al. 2014) , and in a cluster of humans with no known links to agriculture (Evans et al. 2007 ). In cattle, occasionally most of a herd of cattle is affected, sometimes a cluster within a herd, but, somewhat paradoxically, most of the time only a single animal succumbs to infection (Menzies and Neill 2000) . Transmission has been described as ''an enigma'' (Gannon et al. 2007 ) with ''complexity and unpredictability'' (Khatri et al. 2012 ). It has a mysterious mobility, and bTB is often surprising as an infectious disease; it can appear from nowhere, and leave again as quickly (Robinson 2017b) . In other herds, it lingers for years without remission, but the heterogeneous performances leave farmers confounded by the multiplicity of bTB:",

On the other hand, veterinary scientists and policy makers, with their predominant focus on the biological aspects of bTB as a disease, have only in recent years appreciated the importance of the attitudes and resultant behaviours of the stakeholders involved in bTB eradication programmes. The pressure to make profit in competitive global agribusiness markets and resultant intensification of livestock agriculture, have contributed to the spread of M. bovis through husbandry practices which are less than ideal when it comes to disease eradication. Economic pressures to maximize production efficiency can result in prioritizing other important tasks, and the disciplined focus required to separate pathogenic environmental bacteria from bovines through disinfection, or keeping bovines away from badgers, or from other (potentially bTB-infected) bovines in neighbouring herds, becomes more fuzzy. As a result, the bacteria are enabled to perform in ways which enhance their ability to survive and prosper.",

There is still much that is unknown about the performativity of M. bovis at the scale of the microscopic, and with its endless capacity to surprise, even control is going to remain very challenging indeed. Future research in scientific laboratories might open up new vistas and give hope of brighter days to come. For example, through the development of new diagnostic technologies (Casal et al. 2014 ); further elucidation of complex immune responses to infection (Waters et al. 2016 ); effective vaccine discovery (Buddle et al. 2013) ; and using whole-genome sequencing to more accurately trace the spread between animals and farms (Trewby et al. 2016 ), we may have better tools to tackle the disease in future.",

The aim in doing so is to attempt to keep one step ahead of a remarkably persistent contagion, mindful that these microbes ''adhere to different topologies and comprise non-human mobilities, which frequently do not conform to the territories and networks familiar to humans' geographies'' (Hodgetts and Lorimer 2015, p. 7) . The danger of over-emphasizing respect for the ''radical alterity and unpredictability of organisms [and] their ecologies'' in what Lorimer calls the ''vibrant strand of political ecology'' may result in ''appeals for flourishing and conviviality [which] are vague and contextspecific. They do not offer general ethical frameworks or overarching structural causes'' (Lorimer 2012, p. 604 ). On the other hand, ignoring or underestimating the liveliness and vibrancy of matter (Bennett 2010 ) is also problematic. As Lorimer (2012, p. 606) counterbalances his argument, he affirms that ''targets, icons and action plans are necessary, but they should give scope for non-human dynamics, multispecies deliberation and experimentation and forms of adaptive management''.",

These martial framings acted as useful performative devices to bring the bacterium on stage during interviews. Veterinarians responded enthusiastically to this framing, and it encouraged them to focus on the bacterium, otherwise neglected in conversation. As a result, it was variously described as ''a nasty little sod'' (Int A40), ''wee beastie'' (Int A42), ''very insidious'' (Int A45), and a ''clever little devil'' (Int A47), and the race to beat the 'bad guy' was highlighted in this excerpt:",

Herein lies the problem-the 'war' against bTB in N. Ireland has been ongoing for many years, and hope of 'victory' has been all but lost, with the state blamed for failing to eradicate the disease despite the optimism of yesteryear (Robinson 2015) . Although the state's battle cries may have had an effect during the Foot-and-Mouth disease crisis in 2001 (Wright and Nerlich 2006) , and has been used for other national emergencies such as the Hong Kong SARS crisis of 2003 (Baehr 2006) , the problem is that M. bovis has already penetrated and entrenched its positions across the landscape. It is not a new enemy to be feared and kept out at all costs, but is the enemy within, unseen and largely ignored. Even those who consider it, as our quote above demonstrates, believe that science and the state is effectively struggling to do anything about it. The language of war no longer exerts a useful performative effect when apathy and despair predominate: I don't think it will ever be eradicated. I don't think so. An old vet fifty-plus years ago-my father asked him if bTB would ever be eradicated, and he said: ''No, they will keep it under control, but they will never do away with it'' (Int A36, dairy farmer).",

There is a need to re-focus the politics of bTB to deal with the main protagonist in all of this sorry mess-the bacterium itself. Throughout my interviews with the farmers and veterinarians in N. Ireland the bacterium was the one actor most readily forgotten. Even a research scientist stated half an hour into the interview: ''The one thing I haven't talked about is the organism itself'' (Int A33). Even if we do so, with its ultimately surprising performativities, M. bovis looks like lingering for some time to come, and it is certainly an example of ''material agency'' with the ''negative power to resist or obstruct human projects'', and which must be considered a powerful political agent (Bennett 2007, p. 113 ). The encore is maybe, and certainly not yet. A dose of realism must be injected into the politics, with more recognition of the ''ontological instability of matter'' (Braun 2008, p. 677) . It is not just performance which is 'feral' (Clark 2003; Thrift and Dewsbury 2000, p. 429) , but also this difficult-to-control bacterium. The human actors therefore need to work collaboratively together and stop blaming each other for the failure to completely curb the spread of this ''recalcitrant microbe'' (Latour 2000, p. 116) .",

There are no simple solutions to the complexities of implementation \u2026 but dealing with these complexities requires open, frank discussion'' (Closser 2012, p. 399) . Focusing on the performativities of M. bovis highlights that bTB is multiple, and the bacterium is both object (to which things are done) and subject (which does the doing) (Latimer and Miele 2013) . It is a bacterium whose performances need to be brought front and centre stage once again (Goffman 1990 (Goffman [1959 ). Farmers, veterinarians and policy makers need to consider how farming and veterinary practices can better cope with halting the ongoing spread of, and removing, the unwelcome microbes in their midst. The danger, as Schuurman and Franklin (2015, 32) point out in a different context, is that ''persistent counterperformance holds increased potential to negatively subvert the overall performance-too many incidents of counterperformance result in leakages in the performance, and control is no longer possible''. A policy of continuing to test and kill the microbial hosts, by itself, looks unlikely to achieve eradication: it's time for a rethink which takes the microbes themselves more seriously. To do that, there needs to be a better acknowledgement and understanding of how they (counter) perform at their best.",
