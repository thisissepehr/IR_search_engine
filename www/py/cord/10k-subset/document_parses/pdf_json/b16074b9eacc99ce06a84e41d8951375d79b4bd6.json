While in the high-pendelluft group a high regional ventilation delay value was associated with the presence of pendelluft, some patients in the low-pendelluft group showed high regional ventilation delay values but low pendelluft volumes associated with pendelluft exacerbation in animal studies [31] . Future studies might investigate the occurrence of the pendelluft phenomenon in other patient populations, at different PEEP levels and whether pendelluft is to any extent specific to difficult weaning. Another limitation is that our method is based on off-line measurement of pendelluft volumes after EIT data download and analysis; however, the same process could be easily integrated in the current EIT monitors becoming available at the bedside to set the ventilator properly, possibly reducing pendelluft negative effects. Finally, the presence of pendelluft was not associated with relevant long-term outcomes; our study was certainly not powered to disclose such associations, and we believe that long-term outcomes may be explained only in part by single specific factors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1226, "end": 1230, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 560, "end": 566, "text": "Fig. 7", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In our study, EIT technology disclosed the presence of relevant pendelluft volumes during reduction of PS in a fair amount of patients failing a spontaneous breathing trial.
