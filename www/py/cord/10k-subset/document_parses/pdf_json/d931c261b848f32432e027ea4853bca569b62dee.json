Compounds 17, 24 and 25 showed moderate activity with MIC values of 3\u22c512 \u03bcg/mL against B. subtilis. A comparison of the substitution on benzotriazoylpropanone demonstrated halogen substitution on the benzotriazoylpropanone showed higher antibacterial activity against B. subtilis. This result suggested that the introduction of halogen substituent increased the hydrophobicity of the synthesized compounds and lead to the increase of the antibacterial activity.
