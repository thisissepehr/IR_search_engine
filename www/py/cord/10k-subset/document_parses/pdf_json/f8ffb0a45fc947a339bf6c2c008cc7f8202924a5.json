On the other hand, excessive and inappropriate NO synthesis in inflammation and sepsis has been implicated in vascular abnormalities and cell injury. At least three different NOS isoforms (neuronal/brain [bNOS], inducible [iNOS], and endothelial [eNOS]) have been described, which are all expressed in normal lung tissue. We investigated the cell-specific expression of bNOS, iNOS, and eNOS in perfused control rat lungs and lungs undergoing stimulation with endotoxin in the presence and absence of plasma constituents. Lung immunohistochemistry and quantitative evaluation of staining intensity showed endotoxininduced increase in iNOS expression in particular in bronchial epithelial cells, cells of the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), alveolar macrophages, and vascular smooth muscle cells in a time-and dose-dependent fashion. In endothelial cells, which did not express iNOS at baseline, newly induced iNOS was found in response to endotoxin. In contrast, expression of eNOS was markedly suppressed under endotoxin challenge, particularly in bronchial epithelium, BALT, and alveolar macrophages but also in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. eNOS expression in bronchial smooth muscle cells was not altered. In contrast to iNOS and eNOS, cellular expression of bNOS in epithelial cells, nerve fibers, BALT, and endothelial cells did not change in response to endotoxin. All changes in NOS regulation were found to be independent of plasma constituents. We conclude that endotoxin exerts a profound impact on the cell-specific NOS regulation in a large number of lung cell types. Prominent features include de novo synthesis or up-regulation of iNOS, in contrast to down-regulation of eNOS, which may well contribute to vascular abnormalities, inflammatory sequelae, and loss of physiologic functions in septic lung failure.

Unfortunately, NO inhalation, although initially improving gas exchange, did not lead to sustained improvement of oxygenation compared with conventional therapy in the hitherto performed controlled studies (Michael et al, 1998; Payen, 1998) . Nonvasodilation-related effects of inhaled NO, currently not well understood, have been suggested to explain this finding. Moreover, too little information exists about the regulation of the different NOS isoenzymes, and thus the background of endogenous NO formation in ARDS and septic lung failure is still unclear (Payen, 1998) . Such regulation may apparently include iNOS and enhanced expression of iNOS in several cell types such as epithelial cells (Kobzik et al, 1993; Warner et al, 1995; Watkins et al, 1997) , alveolar macrophages (Kobzik et al, 1993; Tracey et al, 1994) , or endothelial cells (Kobzik et al, 1993; MacNaul and Hutchinson, 1993) , which has been reported in several studies in response to mitogen stimulation. In addition, regulation of eNOS and bNOS may be affected, however, only minimal information about the regulation of these constitutive isoforms in response to LPS or cytokines currently exists.

In a recent study using this technique, cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) was shown to be time-dependently and LPS dosedependently up-regulated in different cells of isolated rat lungs challenged with endotoxin (Ermert et al, 2000b) . Interestingly, several cell types such as vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) of large arteries, endothelial cells, or bronchial smooth muscle cells displayed such Cox-2 up-regulation only in the presence of plasma constituents in the buffer perfusate. This plasma dependence was correlated with the lack of expression of membrane CD14 in these cell types, again demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (Ermert et al, 2000b) .

This was a striking finding of the present investigation, with underlying mechanisms for this type of regulatory response to endotoxin being currently unknown.

Briefly, an image analysis system consisting of a 12-bit cooled CCD camera (Sensys KAF 1400; Photometrics, Tucson, Arizona) mounted on a fully automated Leica DM RXA (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) was used to digitize gray scale images to a Dual-Pentium 200 MHz host computer. Microscope settings were kept constant throughout all measurements (Objective: 40\u03eb oil, Leica PL Fluotar 40\u03eb/0.75). A stabilized 12V tungsten-halogen lamp (100 W) was used for illumination. Microdensitometry was performed with a custom-designed filter for absorbance measurement of the substrate Vector Red (central wave length 525 nm, half-band width 10 nm \u03ee 2 nm) manufactured by Omega Optical, Inc. (Brattleboro, Vermont). Adjustment of all microscope settings was stored and recalled before measurement. Calibration of the measurement system with a reference slide was done before measurement. Gray scale images were digitized to 12-bit accuracy, resulting in an intensity scale ranging from 0 to 4095. Image analysis was performed by means of the image analysis program ImagePro 3.0 (Mediacybernetics, Silver Spring, Maryland). For direct visualization of staining intensity, a pseudocolor scale with 11 colors was chosen, each representing an equal sector of the intensity scale, and applied to the images.
