Total enzyme activity was shown to be significantly, (p < .001) lower in tensor fascia latae, biceps femoris, and soleus muscle obtained from 24-month-old compared with 2-month-old rats. Similarly, values for the active form of enzyme were significantly lower, (p < .001) in all three muscle types of 24-month-old compared with 2-month-old rats. This age-related decline in glycogen synthase activity was not due to a reduction in the affinity of the enzyme for its activator (glucose-6-phosphate) and was independent of the concentration of substrate (UDP-glucose) in the assay system. Because similar age-related changes were seen when enzyme activity was expressed per milligram of muscle protein or per gram of muscle tissue, the fall in enzyme activity was not a simple function of an age-related decline in muscle mass. Glycogen levels also were reduced significantly in tensor fascia latae, biceps femoris, and soleus of 24-monthold rats compared with 2-month-old rats, p < .001.

In an earlier study (Narimiya et al., 1984) we determined the activity of several enzymes involved in regulation of glycogenesis, glycogenolysis, and glycolysis in rat muscle. Although we could document an age-related change in the activity ratio of muscle glycogen synthase, we were concerned about the relevance of our findings for several reasons. First, we only used one muscle, the soleus, for all measurements. Second, we did not extend our study beyond 12 months of age. Third, there was reason to believe that muscle glycogen synthase activity could be assessed by recent methods that were more sensitive (Burant et al., 1984; Guinovart et al., 1979; Kochan et al., 1981 ) than the conventional procedure of Thomas et al. (1968) . Given these considerations, we decided to initiate the current study in which we have determined glycogen synthase activity in three different muscle types: tensor fascia latae (fast-twitch white); biceps femoris (mixed fast-twitch red and fast-twitch white); and soleus (slow-twitch red). In addition, we have used the recently described procedure of Kochan et al. (1981) to determine glycogen synthase activity, which is based on previously reported observations that the assay becomes more sensitive to physiological changes in the state of the enzyme when subsaturating concentrations of UDPglucose are used (Guinovart et al., 1979) . The data to be presented document that glycogen synthase activity was significantly lower in 24-compared with 2-month-old rats. Furthermore, the change noted was qualitatively similar in all three muscle types. Finally, the age-related reduction in glycogen synthase activity was independent of any change in the affinity of the enzyme for its activator, glucoses-phosphate.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 102, "end": 123, "text": "(Reaven et al., 1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 216, "end": 238, "text": "(Goodman et al., 1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 261, "end": 284, "text": "(Narimiya et al., 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 854, "end": 875, "text": "(Burant et al., 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 876, "end": 899, "text": "Guinovart et al., 1979;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 900, "end": 919, "text": "Kochan et al., 1981", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 957, "end": 977, "text": "Thomas et al.

Two-month-old rats of the same strain were obtained from the same source. Rats were housed two to a standard shoebox type (19\" x 10.5\" x 8\") cage and kept in HEPA-filtered laminar flow racks (Lab Products, Inc., Maywood, NJ).

The tensor fasciae latae, which represents a fast-twitch white, low oxidative, high glycogenolytic, high myosin ATPase activity muscle, was cut away and frozen within 1 to 2 s between slabs of dry ice. The slabs of dry ice were placed in plastic bags to prevent CO, penetration into the muscle tissue during freezing. After removal of the tensor fasciae latae from each leg, the biceps femoris muscle in the left leg was prepared for freezing in situ with modified Wollenberg-type clamps cooled in liquid N,. This muscle was selected because it represents a combination of fast-twitch mixed red and white fibers. The red fibers are high oxidative and both fiber types are high glycogenolytic and have high myosin ATPase activity. Before the biceps femoris was actually frozen, however, closed operating scissors were inserted into the back of the thigh to separate the attachments between the muscle on the lateral surface of the leg (biceps femoris) from those muscles on the medial surface of the leg (semitendinous and semimembranous). The scissors were extended forward to open the connective tissue covering the biceps femoris, vastus lateralis, and gluteus maximus. By lifting up on the scissors, an opening was provided and the scissors withdrawn as one tong of the clamp was inserted. The clamp was then closed, and the frozen biceps femoris muscle was excised with the scissors around the sides of the clamp. Immediately thereafter, the soleus was removed and transfered to the slab of dry ice and frozen by applying pressure to one slab. This muscle represents slow-twitch red, intermediate oxidative, low glycogenolytic, low myosin ATPase activity. All muscle samples were stored in liquid N 2 until homogenization was initiated. Prior to homogenization, the biceps femoris was trimmed of fat and connective tissue by slicing with a single edge razor blade. Muscle samples were homogenized with a glass Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer at approximately -2 0 \u00b0C with 2 volumes of buffer A (25 mM KF, 20 mM EDTA, and 60% glycerol pH 7.0), followed by homogenization at 4 \u00b0C with an additional 8 volumes of buffer A without glycerol.

These data were analyzed by 3 (age) x 3 (muscle type) analysis of variance. When this was done, it was apparent that there was a significant effect of both age, F(2, 125) = 122.86, p< .001 and muscle type, F{2, 125) = 32.82, p < .001 on enzyme activity. In addition, significant interaction between the effects of age and muscle type on glycogen synthase was noted, ^(4, 125) = 5.52,/? < .001. If one looks at these data muscle by muscle, it can be seen that enzyme values fell with age in each muscle type. Using Scheffe's multiple comparison test it was shown that the activity of all three muscle types from 12-month-old rats was significantly lower than that of 2-month-old rats {p < .05 to .001). In addition, there was a further decline (p < .001) in the activity of the soleus muscle as rats aged from 12 to 24 months. The fall in enzyme activity of the other two muscle types over this same time span was not significant, however. We also determined glycogen synthase activity at a saturating concentration of UDP-glucose (4.4 mM) in muscle samples from 2-and 24month-old rats. The results of these studies (data not shown) were essentially identical to those discussed above. Finally, it should be emphasized that the effects of age and muscle type on activity of glycogen synthase were similar when expressed per milligram of protein or per gram tissue weight. The data shown in Table 1 were based upon measurements of glycogen synthase activity carried out at one concentration of glucose-6-phosphate (10 mM). In order to gain additional insight into the effects of age on glycogen synthase activity, additional measurements were made over a wide range of glucose-6-phosphate concentrations ( Figure  1 ). When these data were analyzed by 3 (age) X 3 (muscle) X 9 (concentration) analysis of variance, a significant effect of age, F(2, 761) = 452.31, p < .001; muscle type, F(2, 761) = 173.10, p < .001, and concentration of glucose-6 phosphate, F(8, 761) = 561.65, p < .001, on glycogen synthase activity was demonstrated. In addition, there was significant interaction (p < .001) between all three of these variables and enzyme activity justifying the use of Scheffe's multiple comparison test to evaluate the effects of age and substrate concentration on enzyme activity. It is apparent that the effect of age on glycogen synthase activity is glucose-6-phosphate concentration dependent, with enzyme activity of 2-month-old rats being higher in all muscle types at substrate concentrations in excess of 0.1 mM. The decline in activity with age was most dramatic between 2 and 12 months in tensor fascia latae and the biceps femoris, whereas the fall in soleus muscle activity seemed to be more progressive with age.

These data (not shown) were also consistent with the notion that aging did not affect the activation state of muscle glycogen synthase under basal conditions. Results also presented in Table 1 show glycogen levels measured in muscle preparations isolated from 2-, 12-, and 24-month-old rats.

In addition, our results indicate that the age-related reduction in muscle glycogen synthase activity is not due to any change in the affinity of the enzyme for glucose-6-phosphate, but rather to a net decrease in enzyme activity. Finally, the same decline in activity of muscle glycogen synthase activity with age was seen when the measurement was made in the presence of saturating concentrations of UDP-glucose. Thus, we feel it reasonable to conclude that a loss in muscle glycogen synthase activity occurs as rats grow older.

For example, at the descriptive level it is not clear if the changes noted are due to age per se, or to the obesity and physical inactivity that characterize 24-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats maintained under usual laboratory conditions. In either case, the changes in glycogen synthase activity may or may not play any role in the resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake seen in older rats. Furthermore, these observations provide relatively little insight into the mechanism responsible for the age-related decline in glycogen synthase activity. For example, we do not know if the age-related loss of enzyme activity is due to decreased synthesis, enhanced degradation, slow turnover, alteration, or inactivation of enzyme molecules. Nor do we know if the age-related decrease in glycogen synthase activity affects net rate of glycogen synthesis and/or steady-state level of glycogen content of skeletal muscle. Indeed, the only thing that seems clear is that the decrease in enzyme activity was apparent when results were expressed per milligram of protein or per gram of tissue, indicating that the fall in enzyme activity cannot be a simple function of a nonspecific loss of cellular protein content with aging.
