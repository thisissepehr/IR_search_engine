Alignment OT the CrPV protein sequence with those of picornavirus and calicivirus capsid proteins demonstrated that the squenced portion of the insect picornavirus genomc encodes the Gtcrminal part of VP3 and the cntirc VPI. Thus CrPV seems to have a genome organization distinct from that of other picornaviruses but closely resembling that of caliciviruses, with the capsid proteins encoded in the 3' part of the gcnomu. On the other hand, the tentative phylogenetic trees generated from the VP3 alignment revealed grouping of CrPV with hepatitis A virus, a true picornavirus, not wilh caliciviruscs. Thus CrPV may be a picornavirus with a calicivirus-like gcnome organization. Different options for CrPV genomc expression are discussed.",

The RNA is polyadenylated at its 3' end and apparently contains a covalently linked protein (VPg) at its 5' end [2] .

This led to delineation of additional regions of significant similarity in picornavirus VP3 and VP1 (not shown), suggesting that the CrPV sequence might correspond to the C-terminal one-half of VP3 and the entire VPl. Indeed, aligning the entire published CrPV protein sequence with the respective portion of HAV polyprotein yielded an alignment with the convincing score of 10.1 SD. Using this alignment, the CrPV sequence was fitted into the modified alignment of picornavirus capsid proteins based on the results of X-ray analysis of the virions of four virus species [ 14, IS] . Conservation between CrPV and mammalian picornaviruses was much more pronounced in the (putative) VP3 than in VPl; this was not surprising as VP3 is the least diverged of the picornavirus capsid proteins [14] . Inspection of this alignment revealed reasonable sequence conservation in the segments of the putative CrPV capsid proteins aligning with the known structural elements of picornavirus proteins (Fig. 1) . In 84 particular, all /?-strands in the C-end half of the (putative) VP3 proteins and the strands D, E and G in VP1 could be identified more or less confidently. Recently, the sequences of the capsid protein of two caliciviruses have been reported [6, 7, 16] , and a region of similarity with picornavirus VP3 has been delineated in one of them [6, 16] . We added the calicivirus sequences to the picornavirus capsid protein alignment and found that all the sequence elements typical of VP3 indeed appeared to be conserved in the calicivirus proteins (Fig. 1) . On the other hand, very little (if any) sequence similarity could be detected between the calicivirus capsid proteins and the aligned sequences of the picornavirus VPls {not shownj.",

Cleavage at each of them would result in predicted VP1 size of about 240-270 amino acid residues, in good agreement with both the typical values for mammalian picornaviruses (274-302 residues, with the exception of aphthoviruses having large deletions in VP1), and with the eleetrophoretic estimates for CrPV. In common with HAV, CrPV probably bears an extension at the N-terminus of the putative VP1. On the other hand, it appears to lack the C-terminal disordered region found in VPls of all mammalian picornaviruses (Fig. 1) . In the latter, this region appears to constitute the hinge between the structural and non-structural domains or the polyprotein. Thus its absence in CrPV may be related to the alternative genome organization of this virus. Serological cross-reaction between CrPV and encephalomyocarditis virus has been reported [17] .

The dendrogram generated by the clustering procedure separated HAV and CrPV as an outgroup, while grouping together ealiciviruses and other picornaviruses (not shown).

As the assignment of this sequence to the 3' part of virus RNA by King et al. [2] seems to be quite solid, confirmed by direct sequencing of a part of the poly(A) tail, this observation implies a genomic organization for CrPV that is basically different from the picornavirus one. Apparently, CrPV encodes the proteins mediating genome replication and expression in its 5' part, and capsid proteins in the 3' part. This gone arrangement obviously resembled that found for the caliciviruses [7, 16, 18] , as well as for several other groups of positive-strand RNA viruses (reviewed by Strauss and Strauss [19], and Lai [20] ). On the other hand, the results of phylogenetic analysis suggested an evolutionary relationship between CrPV and HAV, which is obviously a 'true' pieomavirus. Also, the classification of CrPV as a picornavirus, not a calicivirus, is supported by the absence of substantial similarity between the VPl-related sequence of CrPV and the calicivirus capsid protein, and by the fact that CrPV produces three capsid protein species, like picot-naviruses, and not one. like caliciviruses. This discrepancy raises the important 'tempo and mode' problem in virus evolution, suggesting that similarities in genome organization do not necessarily mirror the phylogenetic grouping of viruses [21] . Determination of the portion of CrPV genome encoding non-structural proteins will allow a better assessment of the phylogenetic position of this interesting virus.",

            "text": "The first hypothesis, though attractive because of the analogy with caliciviruses, seems to contradict the results of radiolabelling of virus-specific RNA in CrPVinfected sells that has not revealed subgenomic species [3] . The second hypothesis, on the other hand, is not readily compatible with the pactamycin mapping data suggesting that the capsid proteins of CrPV are encoded immediately downstream of the ribosome entry site [23] . The third possibility is apparently consistent with all the available experimental data. Clearly, internal initiation of translation is not a typical expression strategy of eukaryotic positive strand RNA viruses. On the other hand, growing evidence shows that initiation of translation of picornavirus mRNAs occurs internally, and their 5'-non-coding sequences retain the ability to direct initiation when placed downstream of a 5' gene in a genetically engineered mRNA (for review see [24] ). Moreover, artificial dicistronic construct has been recently described, in which EMC virus 5'-non-coding sequence was introduced between the poliovirus genes encoding capsid and nonstructural proteins; strikingly, such RNA produced infectious virus [253. Thus it cannot be ruled out that CrPV is a natural 'monster' with a similar, 'mixed' procaryotic/eucaryotic expression strategy. Further experiments on CrPV genome structure and expression will show whether this rather bold speculation will hold true, or this virus actually XTTERS February 1992 exploits one of the more conventional strategies, whereas some of the available data require reevaluation.",

Alignment of the protein sequence encoded in the 3' portion of CrPV gcnome with those of mammalian picornavirus VP3 and VP1 proteins and a portion of the caliciviruscs capsid protein. The alignment of VP3 and VPI of three groups of mammalian picornaviruscs (cntcro-/rhino-, cordio-and aphthoviruscs) was adapted fram that gcneratcd by Palmenberg [14] by superposition of Rhinol4, Mengo and PoliolM crystal slructures and modified using the FMDV structure of Acharya et al. [IS]. Secondary structure elements (a = a-helix; b = /3-sheet; I = loop) are those conserved between the experimentally defined structures of Rhino 14, Polio1 M, Mcngo and FMDVOI, and arc designated according to Palmcnbcrg[lrl]. The distances between the N-termhi of the picornavirus VP3 and the beginning of the aligned scquencvs are indicated. The cntirc published CrPV squcnce was aligned with that of HAV by program OPTAL and the resulting alignment was fitted manually into that of mammalian picornaviruscs. The nmino acid residues identical or similar to those in the CrPV sequences arc upper case. identical (asterisks) and similar (colons) residues in the CrPV and MAV sequences are denoted; identities and similarities bctwLzn CrPV and either of the two caliciviruscs are analogously designated. The amino acid residues were grouped as follows: G,A; S,T; K.R; D,E,N.Q; I,L,V,M; F.Y.W.",
