Mortality rates tended to be numerically higher in influenza A versus B. In previous studies comparing demographic attributes of patients with influenza A and B, a higher age for patients with influenza A was described although this may vary according to influenza A strains. Patients with H3N2 were shown to be older than influenza B patients while patients with H1N1 tended to be younger than patients with influenza B [21] [22] [23] . A French study by Chagvardieff et al. analyzed patients presenting at an emergency department and similarly to the present results influenza B patients were significantly older [24] . The age difference therefore seems to depend on the study population as well as the dominant influenza A subtype. Unfortunately, no information was available about influenza subtypes in the current population; however, during the season concerned influenza A/H1N1 and influenza B/Yamagata were the dominant subtypes in Austria [25] . It has been shown that patients with influenza A suffered more often from chronic diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes and cardiovascular disorders [22, 27] . Furthermore, patients with influenza A were more likely to be smokers. In patients suffering from influenza B infections chronic kidney disease was more frequent. A non-statistically significant trend towards a higher proportion of atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction and peripheral artery disease in the history of patients with influenza B was observed in this study population, which could be explained by the higher mean age of this group. In this population influenza A patients presented with a higher body temperature and with dyspnea statistically more often. Influenza B infections were associated with vomiting. A Japanese study with adults who consulted a medical center with influenza infections combined gastrointestinal symptom (e.g. nausea, diarrhea, epigastric pain) with one parameter and showed that they are more common in influenza B. Matching the present findings they also showed a higher body temperature in influenza A infected patients [26] . Other studies with a younger population and outpatient treatment did not show any differences in clinical presentation [21, 23] . A study of 2791 hospitalized patients reported a higher rate of ICU admission, ARDS, mechanical ventilation and pneumonia in influenza pdmH1N1 patients compared to H3N2 and influenza B patients although this study included children as well and represented a much younger study population [27] . In this study the rate of ICU admission and respiratory failure was higher in influenza A but this did not reach statistical significance. Pneumonia was the most common complication (24%) and equal in both groups. There was a trend towards a higher proportion of acute kidney injury in the influenza B group, which probably could be attributed to the higher age, higher amount of chronic kidney disease and vomiting as a common symptom in this population. Despite the fact that the influenza A patients were younger, they had a longer median in-hospital stay (8 days vs. 7 days).

Other studies of hospitalized patients described a similar mortality rate (3.7-5.2%) without differences between influenza A and B virus infections [27, 28, 32] . Of the studies one analyzed community and healthcare-acquired influenza infections and described an in-hospital mortality rate of 366 Is there a clinical difference between influenza A and B virus infections in hospitalized patients? K original article 10%. The reason for this discrepancy is not known but may be due to the dominance of H3N2, which caused approximately 60% of the influenza infections in this study [33] . In the present population influenza B accounted for 75% of the infections and most of the influenza A infections were most likely caused by H1N1 [25] . In this study the 90-day mortality increased further to 9.4% with no difference between influenza A and influenza B, which represented a twofold increase in mortality. This was not surprising as there is an increased risk for complications leading to death after influenza infections as previously described [29] . The strength of this study is that it focused on hospitalized patients, so any immediate complications could be tracked, especially pneumonia, acute kidney injury, acute heart failure and death which are of great interest and a potential healthcare burden. In addition, efforts were made to assess mortality in the months after influenza infection. There are several limitations of this study. Almost 75% were infected with influenza B therefore the results may not be generalized to influenza A dominant seasons. The study did not differentiate between H1N1 and H3N2 and analyzed the two strains as one group. The symptoms on admission were not collected via a standardized questionnaire which may explain why mild common influenza-like symptoms, such as sore throat and coryza were underreported, especially in patients presenting with severe symptoms, such as dyspnea to the emergency department.
