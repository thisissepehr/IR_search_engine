Assorted animal models have been used to dissect the mechanisms underlying cardiovascular complications of diabetes and to identify possible therapeutic targets. macrovascular complications have been studied using both rodent and larger animal models, such as rabbits, dogs, pigs and non-human primates; each species has its advantages and pitfalls. For example, although diabetes enhances vascular permeability in rodents 14 , advanced atherosclerosis is absent in this model, largely owing to the highly effective lipid-clearance mechanisms that are found in these species 15 . Rodent models that combine hyperglycaemia with dietary modulation or genetic modifications to induce hyperlipidaemia and promote atherosclerosis have therefore been developed. However, a consequence of combined hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia in some of the well-studied mouse models, such as apolipoprotein E-deficient mice with concurrent type 1 diabetes, is that cholesterol levels are higher in diabetic animals compared with non-diabetic animals 16 . This makes it difficult to assess the relative contributions of glucose and/or lipids in driving the acceleration of atherosclerosis.",

First, to assess the relative roles of hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia, mice lacking the low density lipoprotein receptor (lDlR) were crossed with transgenic mice expressing a viral protein under the control of the insulin promoter. when infected with the virus, the mice developed type 1 diabetes. In diabetic animals that were kept on a cholesterol-free diet, atherosclerosis was accelerated compared with non-diabetic animals, suggesting that hyperglycaemia drove accelerated atherosclerosis. However, when the mice were fed diets that were high in cholesterol (which rendered them diabetic), they developed severe hypertriglyceridaemia and advanced atherosclerosis 17 . These studies suggest that diabetes-associated dyslipidaemia accelerated lesion progression. Recent studies using this model have also shown that induction of type 1 diabetes in lDlR-deficient mice promoted plaque disruption, as measured by intraplaque haemorrhage 18 . Interestingly, plaque disruption was associated with the accumulation of monocytes that expressed s100 calcium-binding protein A9, a marker of inflammation.",

However, although mouse models are suitable for dissecting and validating the specific role of hyperglycaemia in the pathogenesis of accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetes, they have definite shortcomings. For example, despite developing extensive and highly advanced atherosclerosis and intraplaque haemorrhage, current diabetic mouse models fail to reliably display evidence of thrombosis and overt myocardial infarction. By contrast, hyperglycaemic and hyperlipidaemic pigs and non-human primates with long-standing diabetes can have highly advanced lesions that are more similar to those observed in human subjects and, importantly, that might be vulnerable to thrombosis 22,23 . one key component for accurate modelling may be the duration of diabetes, which may require many months to years to generate overt pathology. This has prompted extensive efforts to identify biomarkers of vascular injury in diabetes. endothelial cell dysfunction, manifested as impaired vasodilatory responses to acetyl choline or reduced blood flow in human subjects, could prove useful in assessing the state of disease and, possibly, the effect of therapeutic intervention on vascular stress 24 . studies that illustrate the potential diagnostic and predictive value of endothelial cell biopsy techniques in diabetes may also hold promise as an easily repeatable means to sample the vasculature and assess its inflammatory and thrombotic potential at any time point 9, 25 . Vascular dysfunction contributes to all diabetic complications, and therapeutic approaches that target the vasculature (shown centre in dark pink, where the three areas overlap) show some efficacy against all complications. The kidneys, eyes and nerves could also be targeted by organ-specific approaches. ARI, aldose reductase inhibitor; GAG, glycos aminoglycan; RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation end products; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor. Despite the limitations of the various animal models, these studies have shed light on some of the fundamental mechanisms that contribute to accelerated athero sclerosis in diabetes. when testing potential therapeutic targets, smaller animals could be used to probe mechanisms and to carry out early compound screening with a higher throughput, and larger animals could be subsequently used for the final testing of lead compounds and the validation of the mechanisms that were delineated in the smaller rodent species.",

            "text": "The key to discovering treatments that target cardiovascular disease in individuals with diabetes lies in identifying the molecular species that promote perturbation of the vessel wall. Extensive epidemiological evidence suggests that glucose is one of the key players in this process 26, 27 . Both the direct and indirect consequences of increased blood glucose levels contribute to the pathogenesis of accelerated cardiovascular disease in diabetes. In the macrovasculature, high levels of glucose probably synergize with superimposed stresses that are common to both diabetes and non-diabetic vascular disease, such as raised levels of serum lipids, hypertension and the sequelae of innate ageing processes, to continuously stress vascular cells. such mechanisms lead not only to primary vascular dysfunction, but also to chronic cycles of stress that injure surrounding cells, which are dependent on intact vascular function. As summarized in FIG. 2, excess glucose directly stimulates activation of the polyol pathway 3 and also the activity of mitochondria 28 , protein kinase C (PKC) 29 and NADPH oxidase 30,31 , which results in the production of reactive oxygen species (Ros). Hyperglycaemia also leads to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE), which irrevocably alter the diabetic vasculature, leading to vascular stiffening owing to extensive protein crosslinking 32 . moreover, extracellular AGE also bind and activate the signal transduction receptor RAGE (receptor of AGE). RAGE is a multi-ligand receptor, and its interactions with AGE and non-AGE pro-inflammatory ligands, such as s100-calgranulins and high-mobility group box 1 protein (HmGB1), are potent generators of accelerated vascular inflammation 31,33 . The importance of these pathways has been further suggested by recent studies involving the generation of unique mouse models. For example, the role of RAGE has been examined in both non-diabetic 34 and diabetic 35 mice deficient for the genes that encode apolipoprotein E and RAGE, and these studies have shown that RAGE has a pivotal role in atherosclerosis.",

The insights gained from experimental models such as those described above have led to clinical trials investigating antagonism of the polyol pathway 36 , PKC isoforms (particularly PKC\u03b2 37,38 ), AGE 39,40 and agents that counter the effect of the enhanced generation of Ros caused by high glucose levels, such as benfotiamine 41 . New small molecule ligands that antagonize RAGE and humanized chimeric soluble RAGE are also being tested in early clinical trials (see the 6-month safety and efficacy study of TTP488 in patients with type 2 diabetes and persistent albuminuria). long-term success in treating the blood vessels of patients with diabetes will probably lie in identifying combinations of these therapeutic targets, as it is likely that at distinct times Organ damage can be triggered by both extracellular and intracellular hyperglycaemia. Increased extracellular glucose leads to non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins and subsequent formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE) that interact with the receptor for AGE (RAGE) on the plasma membrane and promote the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased intracellular glucose drives mitochondrial activity, increases the activity of protein kinase C (PKC) and NADPH oxidase and promotes increased flux through the polyol pathway, all of which have many effects on cellular metabolism and phenotype. This figure highlights the consequences of excessive ROS production in the vasculature, where ROS-driven changes in cell phenotype are mediated by a range of signalling pathways and transcription factors. Cells of the kidneys, eyes and nervous system also undergo cell-and organ-specific phenotypic changes as a result of hyperglycaemia-mediated ROS production. ROS production, ROS-unrelated pathogenic consequences of hyperglycaemia and hyperglycaemia-independent mechanisms, such as impaired insulin signalling, are likely to collectively mediate the organ-specific pathologies of diabetic complications. Other pathways that are relevant to diabetic complications but are unrelated to hyperglycaemia per se, such as disruption of the renin-angiotensin system (FIG. 3) , are described in the main text.

The importance of ambient hyperglycaemia per se in macrovascular disease may have to be reconsidered in the context of findings from two recent clinical trials, which explored the effects of tight glycaemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease 55, 56 . However, there are potential caveats to these studies. The lack of a positive effect on cardiovascular mortality in these studies could be related to the short duration of the trials (<5 years) or poor tolerance of the demanding and extensive therapeutic regimens by older subjects with type 2 diabetes and its many complications. It is also possible that irreversible vascular changes, such as advanced glycation 57 or 'hyperglycaemic memory' resulting from previous periods of hyperglycaemia 58 , could also contribute, possibly through epigenetic mechanisms such as glucoseinduced histone modifications that alter vascular gene expression [59] [60] [61] . As the effect of diabetes on plasma lipids and blood pressure could also have a substantial role in atherosclerosis, a therapeutic regimen that incorporates antihypertensive and lipid-lowering agents along with drugs that target the consequences of hyperglycaemia may ultimately prove to be the most effective approach, as recently highlighted in the follow-up of a study trialling this approach 62 .",

This pharmacological approach has been extended by the recent production of the renin inhibitor aliskerin, which also seems to reduce proteinuria, particularly as part of dual therapy with an AT2 antagonist 69 . The most effective approach to blocking the RAs remains controversial, and various strategies are currently being investigated. with greater understanding of the complexity of the RAs and identification of new components of this pathway, such as ACE2, it has become increasingly evident that there is a complex interaction between the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator arms of the RAs 70 .

Glucose and AGE-mediated activation of RAGE 78, 80 , key intracellular signalling molecules such as PKC and mitogen-activated protein kinase, and angiotensin II also have a central role in this disease 79 . Furthermore, certain pro-sclerotic growth factors, such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 77,81 and connective tissue growth factor 82 , seem to promote extracellular matrix accumulation, a cardinal structural feature of the kidney in patients with diabetes. It is also becoming increasingly apparent that metabolic and haemodynamic pathways not only interact through common mediators, such as intracellular signalling molecules and growth factors, but can directly interact with each other. For example, angiotensin II can enhance AGE accumulation in the kidney and AGE can directly modulate expression of key components of the RAs 83 . Thus, it seems that metabolic and haemodynamic stimuli, triggered by the diabetic milieu, interact to amplify injury and perpetuate the progression of renal damage in diabetes (FIG. 3) . (TABLe 1) . These trials are focusing primarily on albuminuria as an index of nephropathy, as well as assessing the decline in renal function. Because diabetic nephropathy takes many years to evolve and only occurs in a minority of subjects, these clinical trials have often been difficult to complete. moreover, the Us Food and Drug Administration currently considers renal impairment, and not proteinuria, as the appropriate renal end point of diabetic nephropathy. This requires studies that often involve more than 1,000 patients and a follow-up of up to 5 years 87, 88 . such studies are difficult to carry out in terms of recruitment and are expensive. It is hoped that surrogate markers such as albuminuria may be accepted for approval by regulatory agencies to register drugs as renoprotective in diabetes 89 , although the finding that some subjects with diabetes develop renal impairment in the absence of albuminuria 90 suggests that serial assessment of urinary albumin excretion may also not be ideal. many research groups are trying to identify alternative biomarkers of renoprotection, and much of this work focuses on urine proteomics 91 . This research is at an early phase, and a biomarker has not yet been established. Ultimately, the goal is to develop more robust strategies for monitoring diabetic nephropathy and in particular to generate a more reliable approach to identifying truly renoprotective regimens that not only decrease albuminuria but also reduce renal morphological injury and preserve renal function.",

Development of retinopathy in many of these models occurs more rapidly than in humans, with early lesions developing within months to years of the onset of diabetes. The severity of retinal disease increases with duration of diabetes, but remains mild compared with that seen in many patients with diabetes. This is due in part to the limited lifespan of laboratory animals. with the exception of occasional contrary claims, diabetes alone has not been found to cause pre-retinal (intravitreal) neovascularization in any animal model 98 . Again, this is probably due in part to insufficient severity of capillary degeneration and other lesions during the limited time over which these models have been studied. No data have yet been generated to suggest that the current animal models are inappropriate reflections of human diabetic retinopathy because they are mechanistically inadequate.

However, these have yet to translate to a successful therapy for diabetic neuro pathy. whether this reflects a complex and interconnected pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy or the unsuitability of conduction defects in diabetic rodents for predicting efficacy in humans remains controversial. A more cautious approach that involves showing efficacy against both functional and structural indices of neuropathy may be warranted. many of the potential therapies that have been investigated to treat diabetic peripheral neuropathy have targeted mechanisms such as vascular dysfunction 147 , oxidative stress 148 and RAGE signalling 149 , all of which are common to all the diabetic complications (FIGs 1,2) . Evidence that impaired neurotrophic support contributes to diabetic peripheral and autonomic neuropathy 150,151 suggests a more organ-specific pathogenic mechanism (FIG. 1) , although some aspects of neurotrophic insufficiency are clearly downstream consequences of hyperglycaemia 152, 153 . several neuroactive proteins and polypeptides have been investigated as replacement therapies to counteract impaired neurotrophic support 150 , but difficulties with delivery routes and systemic effects have impeded clinical development. small molecules that promote endogenous production of neurotrophic factors have also shown some success in diabetic rodents [154] [155] [156] . most recently, gene therapy to facilitate endogenous production of nerve growth factor 157, 158 , hepatocye growth factor 159 , neurotrophin 3 (ReF. 160) or vEGF 161, 162 has been explored.

The use of these models is driven in part by the desire of researchers to accelerate the onset of complications in inexpensive species that are amenable to genetic manipulation. Although current rodent models are useful for identifying the initial pathogenesis of diabetic complications and for studying the effect of potential prophylactic and early interventional therapies, there is persistent uncertainly as to whether investigators are studying mechanisms and drugs that are pertinent to overt pathological damage in humans. Another recurring theme is the difficulty in designing viable clinical trials and identifying which end points should be used as indicators of therapeutic efficacy. It is clear that the regulatory bodies are challenged by conflicting requirements to establish consistent end points which can be used in trials that may take many years to complete, while needing to have the flexibility to adopt new surrogate biomarkers as they are identified and validated by preclinical and clinical studies.",

The example of vEGF, for which inhibitors are being developed to treat diabetic retinopathy 129 and increased expression provoked to treat neuropathy 162 , illustrates the complexities that have to be considered when addressing individual complications within the context of a disease that impairs so many systems. Nevertheless, new animal models, creative drug delivery systems and improvements in clinical trial design and biomarkers will hopefully combine to accelerate the development of therapies for diabetic complications and improve approaches that are already being investigated. A single drug that is effective against all diabetic complications may not be a realistic goal. Therapeutic strategies that incorporate interventions targeting the glucose-mediated pathogenic axis outlined in FIG. 2,  in combination with those that address organ-specific and glucose-independent mechanisms, may provide the most successful approach to drug development in this area.
