            "text": "Recommendation : Major Revision. Yes, suitable if Q1-3 are adequately addressed ROCK enables interstitial movement of T cells along the vasculature of inflamed lungs The authors study CD8 motility in lung slices from mice recovering from LPS-induced lung-injury. There are some nice technical points here and it's a very solid start to something potentially interesting but the analysis of the 'meat' (Figure 7 /8) are too minimal and too many uncertainties remain. I'd be supportive of this for Nat. Comm. based on its potential import but as presented I don't see this as a strong addition to our understanding of migration based on the following queries: Q1: Is this really interstitial motility being studied here or might some of it also be alveolar? This is quite important for interpreting the inhibitor studies but the question starts to appear important earlier in the paper. In Movie S4, the cell appears to crawl away from the marked vasculature. Similarly, the last half of the track for Movie S5 and then the un-tracked cell in Movie S6. Can the authors confirm that this is along a surface (as in 'in' the interstitium) and that the cell hasn't crossed all the way into the agarose within the filled alveolus? How is this accounted for in the analysis. The vascular anti-CD3 only shows that it is not in the vessel but don't distinguish interstitial versus intra-alveolar. Can they provide movies that reinforce that it is the former (or, more difficult, inhale anti-CD3PE and do an 'alveolar' labeling)? To this extent, the data shown in Figure 5 is almost too good (if those movies are representative). Was there some filtering done here to only keep the 'green' segments for Figure 5D . If so, another graph should be generated that shows green versus white segments. Overall, although there is no doubt that some portions of some tracks align with the vascular marking, it may not be possible with this approach to be sure they are not looking at hugging of the inner alveolar wall. The authors should ideally confirm or refute this with data/analysis. Q2: How much of the turning angle analysis is a function of structure? In Figure 3 , the authors attempt to fit the movements to a variety of search patterns. They find that log-normal is the best and that neither Brownian nor Levy behavior is well supported. They also find that turning angle is well correlated but only for the first minute. However, more thought could go into the role of the convolutions of the interstitium in influencing perceived tracks. The correlation of turning angles with short time could merely be a reflection of the structure of the interstitium, no? Given the absence of flow, too, its interesting to consider why cells would ever move in a straight path in the lung unless following a chemokine gradient, perhaps laid down on the inside of the intersititum. (See possible confinement issue remaining with PTX, Q3) Q3: Can the authors provide more robust analysis of the inhibitor results? Beyond the import of Q1 for this, the inhibitor results are the most surprising and potentially important but there are some problems with the setups and interpretation that really lessen my enthusiasm for the paper as presented. First, Figure 7 is baffling. \"A\" shows very limited change in speed (see below about whether PTX block was complete) and \"C\" shows very little change in turning behavior. \"B\" is interpreted as showing a decent change in MSD displacement but the xy intercept was allowed to float for the control and if I am looking at that data, I see a bit of a dampening of MSD (flattening toward the x axis) with time in the control, suggesting maybe that chemokine normally might confine cells. But in general, there needs more exploration of this point to make this clearer. In general, the paper would be stronger if some of the early figures were combined or supplementalized so as to spend more time analyzing this result. What are the effects of this inhibitor and the Rock inhibitor as you move toward the airway? Additionally, the inhibitor quality should be in doubt: For Figure 7, they state they incubate \"the lungs for two hours to ensure effective PTX inhibition\" but shouldn't there be a functional way to show this? It may be that all of the PTX stays trapped at the border of the slide and doesn't effectively diffuse. Given that they have very minimal effects (quite unexpected) I'd expect to see a better assay here. Two experiments come to mind. First, they can reisolate the T cells from the lung slices after PTX addition and do a transwell assay to show they are blocked. Second, they could add a gradient to the lung (CXCL12 impregnated beads) and show responsiveness. Third, they could adopt cells that were only just treated with PTX and watch them later (PTX takes about 30 minutes to deplete the Gai). Note too that there are decent chemokine blocking antibodies available and if there really is a slight slowing but a de-confinement (my interpretation of Fig 7) with chemokine loss, they should be able to add antibodies to the slices as well (anti-CXCL10/12, see above for needed controls). Also, I would think that, unless there are other factors they are proposing here and which would then need to be demonstrated to complete this study, that the Rock inhibitor should phenocopy at least a component of the PTX/chemokine blockade; since we know/they show that this pathway is downstream of the chemokines they are proposing are important. It'd be fine if Rock inhibitor didn't have a phenotype but chemokine did but the reverse in this situation seems odd. I suggest again that they check their PTX efficacy and update that result or provide an alternative explanation for the Rock effect. At present it is otherwise a rather isolated observation that should be advanced (what molecule drives Rock-dependent effects if not chemokine?). Other queries Figure 6 would appear to have limited novelty and could at very least be put in supplemental. The relevance of CD8+ T cells is not well established in lung injury when compared to CD4 T cells. As the authors show CD8s are clearly recruited to the lung in lung injury, but to my knowledge no one has demonstrated that they play an important role in the pathology of ARDS compared to CD4 subsets such as Tregs and Th17s. This may significantly lowers the impact of this study when compared to if it was done on CD4 subsets relevant to ARDS, or if it had first demonstrated a key function for CD8s in ARDS. Can the authors at least provide justification for why this particular biology matters or if CD4s are the same?",

This is quite good data and the only caveat regarding interpretation is in Q1. In Figure 2 , the authors demonstrate variation in speeds, highlighted by differing the integration time. They also show data suggestive of a sinusoidal pattern of migration speeds, suggesting periodic oscillations of fast/slow migration. In Figure 3 , the authors attempt to fit the movements to a variety of search patterns. They find that log-normal is the best and that neither Brownian nor Levy behavior is well supported.

            "text": "In this study, Mrass et al. examined CD8+ effector T cells motility using a LPS-induced acute lung injury model. Following adoptive transfer of polyclonal CD8+T cells activated in vitro into mice treated LPS intranasally. They found that transferred T cells efficiently migrated into lung tissues. Two-photon imaging of explanted lungs up to two hours showed characteristic behaviors of transferred T cells. Computational analysis of manually tracked T cells in lung tissues revealed that lung-infiltrating T cells had a tendency of intermittent repeats of fast/directional and slow/confined migration. The fast/directional migration appeared to associated with the vascular structure. The authors tried to dissect the molecular background to explain lung-infiltrating T cells migration behaviors. Pertussis toxin modestly decreased velocities of lung-infiltrating T cells while the directionality was maintained. In contrast, ROCK inhibitor greatly diminished both velocities and directionality. Based on these findings, the authors speculate that T cells squeezed through preformed tissue channels presumably through a Rho-ROCK-F-actin dependent amoeboid migration. The excellent part of this study is statistical analyses of motility of lung-infiltrating T cells. By comparing appropriately randomized processes, they revealed a tendency of intermittent repeats of fast/directional and slow/confined migration. The experiments using PTX or ROCK inhibitors revealed ROCK-dependent directional migration was dominant whereas inhibition of Gi signaling modestly reduced velocities. Unfortunately, biological processes behind infiltrating T cell behaviors were poorly examined. The authors suggest directional T cell movement along preformed channels associated with the vasculature, which was not characterized in details. It remains unknown that what triggers Rho-ROCK signaling in inflamed lung tissues. The involvement of integrins was not addressed. What is the biological significance of the intermittent T cell migration and what roles CD8+ effector T cells play by doing so in a LPS-induced lung injury model? Although the statistical characterization of T cell migration patterns in inflamed lungs using two-photon microscopy is interesting, data obtained using explanted lungs might include artifacts (altered lung tissue architecture due to loss of air and blood flow, for example), and should be validated by comparing using in vivo imaging methods. Overall, I think that the findings described in this study are potentially interesting, but not enough to advance our conceptual understanding of interstitial migration that was reported before.",

            "text": "Additionally, the inhibitor quality should be in doubt: For Figure 7 , they state they incubate \"the lungs for two hours to ensure effective PTX inhibition\" but shouldn't there be a functional way to show this? It may be that all of the PTX stays trapped at the border of the slide and doesn't effectively diffuse. Given that they have very minimal effects (quite unexpected) I'd expect to see a better assay here. Two experiments come to mind. First, they can reisolate the T cells from the lung slices after PTX addition and do a transwell assay to show they are blocked. Second, they could add a gradient to the lung (CXCL12 impregnated beads) and show responsiveness. Third, they could adopt cells that were only just treated with PTX and watch them later (PTX takes about 30 minutes to deplete the Gai). Note too that there are decent chemokine blocking antibodies available and if there really is a slight slowing but a deconfinement (my interpretation of Fig 7) with chemokine loss, they should be able to add antibodies to the slices as well (anti-CXCL10/12, see above for needed controls). We apologize if our previous description of previous Fig 7 (now Fig 6) was misleading. It is very clear from the speed and MSD data that PTX inhibited T cell speed and displacement at similar levels as previously published in other organs (Harris et al. 2012 , see additional citations in text). In former Fig 7A (now 6A) , speed is decreased by from 2.4 um/min in untreated cells to 2.0 um/min in PTX inhibited cells. More importantly, the motility coefficient of T cells decreased by 50% from untreated to PTX treated T cells (from 6.8um 2 /min to 3.6um 2 /min). In former 7B, displacement shows the slope of the MSD is significantly lower, showing less displacement in the presence of PTX. We have now adjusted the text to reflect this (see page 11). The reviewer is correct that the MSD may be slightly flatter for the control, but we feel that the data is not sufficient to support the conclusion that chemokine confines cells based solely on this analysis.",

In fact, from direct side by side comparisons of T cell motion in lung in Thornton 2012 , the authors state that there are no observed differences between explanted lung slices and intravital imaging in either dendritic cell or T cell behavior (Thornton JEM 2012) . In addition, because of the need for precise T cell tracking in our detailed quantitative analyses, we believe that intravital imaging would introduce additional motion artifacts that would inhibit our ability to track individual T cells. Thus, we believe that our use of explanted lung in tracking T cells is well justified.",

It'd be fine if Rock inhibitor didn't have a phenotype but chemokine did but the reverse in this situation seems odd. I suggest again that they check their PTX efficacy and update that result or provide an alternative explanation for the Rock effect. At present it is otherwise a rather isolated observation that should be advanced (what molecule drives Rock-dependent effects if not chemokine?).",

Although the target for CD8 T cells in the LPS model is unclear, this finding would be meaningful for CD8 T cell functions. The authors showed that spontaneous T-cell migration through 3 um pores was severely reduced by the ROKC inhibitor. This result suggest that Rho-ROCK rather than Gi signaling stimulate confined motility. The authors also showed ERK activation in the same figure (Fig S4C) . This is rather redundant data since it is already known that ERK activity is increased by chemokines. Or is there any evidence that ERK trigger ROCK activation, or ERK inhibitors block T cells motility in the LPS-injured lung? Regarding the explant vs in vivo imaging, the studies of lymph nodes showed these were comparable in interstitial migration. The cited study (Thornton E.E. et al) did not actually compare T cell interstitial migration in sliced lung tissues and in vivo live lung imaging. The results that the straight, fast movement often aligned the vascular structures, as shown in this study, suggest the increased blood flow could affect vascular structures and hence T cell migration behaviors in associated confined space. I feel that this issue might deserve careful side-by-side observation and analysis in LPS-injured models, and the insight of a possible contribution of blood flow to confined T cell motility and intermittent migration as well as clarification of target finding functions would really advance our understanding in inflammatory lung pathology. Overall, as the first round review, I think that the authors' analytical methods are excellent, as also indicated in new simulation study, but biological ones are still limited.",

As suggested by the reviewer, we established a collaboration with a leader in the field of intravital imaging, Dr. Mark Miller of Washington University in St. Louis, who is an author on one of the papers cited by the reviewer (In vivo two-photon imaging reveals monocyte-dependent neutrophil extravasation during pulmonary inflammation. 2010. PNAS). Dr. Miller is one of only a few labs in the world who are performing intravital two photon microscopy in inflamed lung.In collaboration with the Miller group, we have now imaged T cell motility patterns in inflamed lungs of living mice with acute lung injury with intact air exchange and blood flow. We find that intravital imaging of T cell movement in inflamed lung show a similar pattern of intermittent motion as explanted lung in individual T cells (new Figure 4G ) as well as in the full population of T cells that we analyzed (new Figure 4I) . We also find that the difference in speed over longer periods of imaging are maintained (new Figure 4H) . In this revision, we have added new text to the results as well as discussion to reflect our new results (text highlighted in yellow), confirming that intermittent T cell motion occurs in the lung in a physiologically intact model of ALI. Dr. Miller and his group are now co-authors on this revised manuscript to reflect their contribution to intravital imaging. This new intravital imaging results confirm our novel finding that intermittent migration of T cells is physiologically relevant.We have also included a supplemental movie from intravital imaging showing intermittent T cell motion (new Supplemental Movie S4). We have not included control movies demonstrating blood flow from intravital imaging but we are happy to provide additional control movies to the reviewer if requested.We hope that with these additional controls, the editor and reviewer will find our manuscript suitable for publication in Nature Communications. Below is the full reviewer's response to our previous rebuttal for your reference. Thank you, Judy Cannon",

I feel that either approach with reasonable findings would be acceptable. Disappointingly, however, the authors declined none of experiments to address this issue. The assumption that T cell motilities in vivo and ex vivo are comparable based on other organs would be inappropriate, as the lung is a unique organ; the parenchyma is composed of thin alveolar walls with rich air and blood flows. It would be rather counterintuitive that confined T cell motilities are not affected by their pressure. Although dendritic cells in the lung appeared similar ex vivo and in vivo, T cells are much faster (as indicated in this study) and should be studied separately. The experimental method of intravital imaging of the inflamed lungs was first published in 2010. Since then, unique leukocytes and cancer cells motilities were reported, which are often associated with the vasculature (some references are listed below). To my knowledge, the apparatus and methods for intravital lung imaging has been widely known. When it is difficult to get ones, the authors should seek for collaborations. As I mentioned above, the authors should clarify the biological effect on inflamed lungs, alternatively. I think that at least either approach should be taken.Overall, I think that this study is rather analytical as it is (which is excellent), but insufficient for a conceptual advance, since the most findings of this study were already reported in other organs.",

Below is the original comments by reviewer #2. We hope that this satisfies all reviewer requirements for publication in Nature Communications.Reviewer #2 (Remarks to the Author):The revised paper now includes live imaging of T cell migration using 2-P microscopy, which also showed intermittent migration patterns. This information greatly strengthens physiological relevance of the data obtained ex vivo. I recommend the revised paper for publication in Nature Communications.Please also note that we asked reviewer 2 to comment on your response to reviewer 1 from last round, as reviewer 1 report was not particularly informative. Reviewer 2 tells us that your responses to reviewer 1 are satisfactory in most cases, but thinks it would have been better to have provided some Gq inhibitor studies or similar to gain a greater understanding of what regulates ROCK signalling in this context. As such we also ask that you add a clear caveat in discussion outlining that you do not have a clear mechanism of this induction.",
