None of the nine children who 77 responded to questionnaires and who were identified in this report were admitted to the hospital, whereas 26 of 28 respondents in northwest London were hospitalized. Questionnaires for this study were applied uniformly to all children with diarrhea, whereas questionnaires were distributed only to HCV-positive patients in the northwest London study. The two children with a rash are of interest, because infections with many animal caliciviruses cause a vesicular exanthem [29] ; this feature has not yet been noted for HCV infections. Studies with other designs will be required to define the complete spectrum of illness caused by HCV. Finally, ISEM proved to be a sensitive and specific method for confirming ELISA-positive results. By using ELISA-positive specimens from three epidemiological studies, we have had the following experience with the confirmatory assays: ELISA blocking, 26 of 27 confirmed; direct EM, 0 of 27 confirmed; IEM, 12of 17confirmed; and ISEM, 27 of 27 confirmed.
