A prime example is the recent emergence of swine-origin influenza viruses A/H1N1 (S-OIVs) that have transmitted to and spread among humans, resulting in outbreaks. During April 2009, a novel H1N1 virus was detected in unrelated cases of influenzalike illness in California and was subsequently recognized to be the cause of a major outbreak of respiratory disease in Mexico that had been ongoing for some weeks previously [1] . The virus was found to be an H1N1 virus that was genetically and antigenically unrelated to human seasonal influenza viruses and genetically related to viruses circulating in swine [2] [3] [4] . The association of the origins of the current outbreak with the Mexican pig farming region raised immediate suspicions that porcine influenza was involved, and it was soon demonstrated that the nearest relative of the strains isolated in the latest outbreak was the triple reassortant porcine influenza that had caused considerable problems for pig farmers for several years [5] . The new strain is a result of a further reassortment and generated a quadruple reassortant with genome segments traceable to two major lineages of porcine influenza as well as avian and human influenza [6] . The announcement on April 21st 2009 by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding two patients in California infected with a new swine-originated influenza virus prompted the initiation of pandemic flu preparedness plans by public health officials [7] . According to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, the current influenza outbreak is of pandemic character. In response to the outbreak, many schools in Mexico, the US, Japan and other countries were closed in order to stop the spread of S-OIV infection. This reflects the threat that influenza viruses pose and the uncertainty about evolution of a new influenza strain towards a virulent strain. By September 16th, 2009, a total of about 280,000 cases and about 3,200 deaths have been reported worldwide. In the same period of time, about 300,000 children died from malaria and about 600,000 children died of diarrhoeal diseases worldwide [8] . The current H1N1 outbreak ranks low on a global scale; however, three major pandemics in the last century spread fear. Indeed, influenza viruses have the potential to induce one of the highest morbidity and mortality rates of all pathogens. Of the 16 known serotypes of influenza A hemagglutinin, 6 have been isolated from humans at the molecular level, i.e. H1, H2, H3, H5, H7, H9. Out of these six different hemagglutinins, H1, H2 and H3 have been involved in past pandemics [9, 10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 510, "end": 513, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 697, "end": 700, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 701, "end": 704, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 705, "end": 708, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1086, "end": 1089, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1297, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1574, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2223, "end": 2226, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2526, "end": 2527, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2706, "end": 2709, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2710, "end": 2713, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Pandemics have substantial economic impact deriving from the costs of prevention and treatment, work absenteeism and hospitalizations.

Other animal species infected by influenza include pigs, horses and dogs, due to the broad host range of these viruses [11] . Influenza A viruses have segmented, negative-sense RNA genomes and encode 11 proteins, including the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase as well as the virulence factors NS1 (host interferon antagonist) and PB1-F2 (proapoptotic factor). The viruses are grouped according to the expression of 16 hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes and 9 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes [12] . The HA protein has an important role in expressing high pathogenicity in many animal species and mediates the fusion of the viral and host endosomal membranes. Replication and transcription of viral RNAs are carried out by three polymerase subunits PB1, PB2, PA, and the nucleoprotein NP. The NA protein facilitates virus release from infected cells by removing sialic acids from cellular and viral HA and NA proteins. Sialic acid is the receptor for hemagglutinin, humans express sialyl-transferases in mucosal and respiratory tissues resulting in N-glycans with a2,6 linked sialic acids. In avian tissues, another conformation of terminal sialic acid is expressed and N-glycans are linked with a2,3 sialic acid. These different conformations restrict the virus to specific hosts, e.g. avian viruses bind predominantly to receptors expressed on avian tissues. The genomic evolution of influenza A virus is characterized by a complex interplay of mutations, frequent reassortment and periodic selective sweeps. A significant driver of diversity by mutation and immunological selection is the high error rate of the influenza virus RNA polymerase, the lack of any proofreading and the subsequent quasi species nature of influenza viruses, like other RNA viruses, e.g. hepatitis C virus and HIV. The A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 subtypes exhibit different evolutionary dynamics, with diverse lineages circulating in A/H1N1, indicative of weaker antigenic drift [13] . A sink-source model of viral ecology is suggested in which new lineages are seeded from a persistent influenza reservoir, which is hypothesized to be located in the tropics, to sink populations in temperate regions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 192, "end": 196, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 574, "end": 578, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2029, "end": 2033, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Influenza viruses"}, {"text": "In the rare event of a double infection with two different strains of influenza virus in a single host, reassortment of the genome segments might occur, producing a series of completely novel combinations of genome segments in the progeny viruses. Such reassorted strains may be the source of new pandemic influenza variants incorporating hemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase proteins against which hosts may have virtually no immunity. This sudden introduction of completely new serotypes of HA into circulating human viruses is referred to as antigenic shift. Although serotypes H1, H2 and H3 are the only ones known to have been involved in influenza pandemics, molecular evidence exists for the occasional infection of humans with avian viruses containing H5, H7 or H9. The prospect of an antigenic shift involving any of these is of major concern in pandemic surveillance. If an avian virus mutates or reassorts and gains the ability to bind to a2,6 linked sialic acids, it might cross the species barrier and infect humans. Swine tissues express both forms of sialic acid and can be coinfected with human and avian viruses [3] . Thus pigs serve as a melting vessel for human, avian and swine influenza strains. Molecular markers predicting the ability of transmission have not yet been determined. However, low temperature and low humidity are known to be environmental conditions that favour aerosol transmission, explaining the seasonal nature of normal influenza [14] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1127, "end": 1130, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1470, "end": 1474, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Influenza viruses"}, {"text": "Uncomplicated human influenza virus infection causes transient tracheo-bronchitis, corresponding with predominant virus attachment to tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells.

Pigs have been proposed to serve as intermediate hosts where such adaption and reassortment of avian precursors may occur. The recently emerged S-OIVs are detected in many countries and are still spreading. At present, mortality rates associated with S-OIVs infections are comparable to seasonal influenza outbreaks.

A first, mild wave in the spring of 1918 was followed by a second wave in September to November 1918 that resulted in mortality rates of over 2.5%, compared to less than 0.1% typically recorded for influenza outbreaks. A third wave with equally high mortality rates swept around the world in 1919 [1] . The mortality pattern of the Spanish influenza was unusual with high mortality rates for young adults. The morbidity pattern was similar to other pandemics, children under the age of 15 years experienced the highest attack rates. Most patients died of bacterial pneumonia, which may be attributed to the lack of antibiotics, however, many others died due to viral pneumonia. The genomic sequences of this virus have been determined [19] [20] [21] and revealed an avian-like H1N1 virus that contains human-like signature amino acids in several proteins. The Spanish influenza virus lacks a multibasic HA cleavage site [21] , the hallmark of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses that pertains to high pathogenicity in domestic poultry. It is not a marker for high pathogenicity in other than avian hosts or other hosts, e.g. mammals. Different proteins, e.g. PB1-F2 contributed to its virulence and HA and PB2 were critical for transmissibility. The disease was first detected in the USA in prisons and military bases. Troop movements during World War I appear to have been a major cause of its global distribution. Antigenic drift subsequent to the initial antigenic shift is the likely cause for several waves of renewed virulence shown by the virus. Spanish flu illustrates both the potential of influenza for morbidity and mortality, and also the tendency of severe pandemics to occur in several waves as the virus adapts to its new human host.

This outbreak was brought under control with the depopulation of live birds in Hong Kong. After a period of local and sporadic outbreaks, a new outbreak started in 2003. This virus has spread to Europe and Africa. The highly pathogenic H5N1 virus is lethal in chickens and some of these viruses kill waterfowl, the natural reservoir of influenza A viruses. These viruses have fatally infected several mammalian species, e.g. cats. Their continued confirmed transmission to several hundreds of humans resulted in severe respiratory infections with high mortality rates. Human H5N1 infections cause severe pneumonia and lymphopenia. However, sustained human-to-human transmission was not reported. In contrast, S-OIVs seem to spread efficiently among humans but have caused a limited number of fatal infections. H5N1 viruses replicate mainly in the lower respiratory tract of humans. The receptorbinding specificity of human and avian influenza viruses suggests that avian influenza viruses need to acquire the ability to recognize human-type receptors to cause a pandemic. In the 1918, 1957 and 1968 pandemics, the pandemic strains possessed HA of avian origin which recognized human-type receptors. The avian flu virus H5N1 cannot be transmitted efficiently from humans to humans and demonstrates a similar drug resistance profile as the new S-OIV, i.e. resistant to adamantanes and sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors. However this virus contains molecular markers of pathogenicity, e.g. PB1-F2 and a polybasic cleavage site in hemagglutinin, a marker of high pathogenicity in domestic poultry, and might cause rare acute lung injury and death. The relative severity of threat is low due to very low infection rates in humans. A more adapted strain of H5N1 to humans could result in a devastating pandemic.

The divergence between H1 and its nearest serotype neighbour H2 is around 40%, thus the 2009 H1 may be considered as halfway towards a new serotype [11] .

The coding sequence for PB1-F2, the smallest protein of influenza, is a molecular marker of pathogenicity but is not present in all human influenza viruses. However, it is consistently present in viruses of increased virulence in humans, including flu viruses of the three major pandemics from the last century [8] . A second marker that can be assessed by sequences alone is the degree of identity between the viral hemagglutinin of the new strain and of other human influenza strains. Low identity indicates antigenically distinct hemagglutinin structures, suggesting that transmission from human-tohuman will not be blunted by general immunity resulting from exposure to similar viruses. A third molecular marker for pathogenicity of avian influenza viruses is the polybasic cleavage site, a protease site in the viral hemagglutinin that enables an expanded array of host proteases to activate the hemagglutinin and enables the virus to fuse with the host cell [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 406, "end": 410, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 638, "end": 641, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1273, "end": 1276, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1926, "end": 1929, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 884, "end": 892, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Genetics"}, {"text": "At present, there is a 99.9% sequence identity within each gene segment of the S-OIVs strains that have been sequenced.

However, there is little antigenic cross reactivity with contemporary human seasonal H1N1 viruses [37] . This antigenic gap between S-OIVs and contemporary seasonal human H1N1 viruses is due to the fact that human H1N1 viruses have been under consistent immune selection pressure from the herd immunity being built up in humans while similar immune selection pressure was apparently less intense in swine. Interestingly, children and young adults have little or no cross-reacting antibodies to S-OIVs, humans over 60 years of age have cross-reacting antibodies [37] . This may reflect the fact that human H1N1 viruses have continued to diverge from swine influenza viruses over time. H1N1 viruses circulating in humans before the 1950s are more closely related antigenically to classical swine H1N1 and thus to S-OIVs than contemporary human H1N1 viruses.

Oseltamivir-resistant H5N1 viruses have been reported previously, thus new therapeutic approaches that can be rapidly deployed and will address the issue of recurring resistance should be developed. New drugs with antiviral peptides blocking the entry of influenza virus are currently investigated [39] . The occurence of oseltamivir-resistant seasonal influenza virus did not appear to be directly related to the overuse of oseltamivir. Weinstock and Zuccotti [40] described recently, that 67% of H1N1 strains in Norway are oseltamivir-resistant, though the antiviral drug is rarely used there, whereas in Japan, which has the world's highest per capita oseltamivir use, seasonal H1N1 resistance rates are only 3%. Surveillance in Europe revealed significant numbers of seasonal A/H1N1 influenza strains with a 274Y neuraminidase mutation that were highly resistant to oseltamivir [41] . The mutation had no impact on zanamivir susceptibility. Rungrotmongkol et al. [42] used homology modelling on the S-OIV neuraminidase complexed with oseltamivir, and the M2-channel with adamantanes bound. The S-OIV was predicted to be susceptible to oseltamivir, with all important interactions with the binding residues being well conserved. Adamantanes have completely lost their binding with M2 residues which is due to the fact that the new S-OIV strain contains the resistance-associated S31N mutation. The S-OIVs are sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors when tested in vitro in enzymatic assays [7] . Early July the WHO has been informed by health authorities in Denmark, Japan and Hong Kong of the appearance of S-OIVs which are resistant to oseltamivir, based on laboratory testing. These viruses were found in patients who did not have severe disease and all have recovered. The viruses, while resistant to oseltamivir, remain sensitive to zanamivir.

On a national level, it has been estimated that in the United States a pandemic virus whose severity is comparable to that of the 1968 Hong Kong influenza pandemic led to approximately 200,000 deaths and 700,000 hospitalizations, of which roughly 100,000 would require treatment in intensive care unit settings.
