Recently, a combined Shigella-ETEC vaccine (CVD 1208S-122), consisting of an attenuated S. flexneri 2a strain expressing the ETEC colonization factor antigen-1 (CFA/1) and the heat labile-enterotoxin (LTb), has been shown to be safe and immunogenic in guinea pigs 7, 8 . In order to provide stronger evidence of its pre-clinical effects, we evaluated whether CVD 1208S-122 could induce antibody responses and confer protection against diarrhea and weight loss using two murine models of orally administered S. flexneri and ETEC infections in C57BL/6 mice 9,10 . Following antibiotic treatment, these models enable the study of clinical outcomes that mimic human disease in children induced by oral infection and enable the testing of interventions. In this study, we used antibiotic pre-treated nourished mice as they closely mimic the disease most often seen in humans with optimal, self-limited diarrhea and weight decrements as reported 6, 7 .",

Similarly, CFA/I is one of the most common ETEC colonization factors and has been used as a target for ETEC vaccine 11 . LTb is also a common antigen used in the vaccine studies 12 . Overall, the current findings expand our knowledge about the immunogenic potential of these antigens for further vaccine studies. In addition, we observed potential protection by the vector alone (attenuated S. flexneri strain) against ETEC-induced weight loss, which might be explained by heterologous immune response. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is the high similarity (80%) between EatA (from ETEC) and SepA (from S. flexneri), both serine protease autotransporters of the Enterobacteriaceae (SPATE), which can lead to cross-reactivity 13 .",

Interestingly, CFA/Ione of the two ETEC components inserted in the CVD 1208S-122is a major colonization factor in ETEC 14, 15 . However, there is an increasing recognition that a greater variety of colonization factors play a role in colonization and pathogenesis of ETEC infections 16 . More specifically, it is possible that EtpA, an exoprotein adhesin of ETEC, can mediate adherence between flagella and intestinal cells 17 , leading to robust colonization even in vaccinated mice. Further, the protection against ETEC-induced disease outcomes in this model may have been facilitated by anti-LT antibody responses, not measured here. The capacity of CVD 1208S-122 to induce strong serum and mucosal antibody responses against the ETEC antigens expressed in the vaccine was recently reported in guinea pigs 7, 8 and will need to be evaluated in future studies utilizing these mouse models.",
