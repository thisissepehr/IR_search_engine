In contrast to 5-ASA, hydrocortisone was only able to abolish epithelial IL-8 release at 20-fold higher concentrations than are relevant clinically. This is consistent with reports that hydrocortisone only reduces cytokine levels at supratherapeutic concentrations in the respiratory epithe-FIGURE 7. A: Downregulation of NF-B by p65 siRNA reduced IL-8 release in response to representative CD and colon cancer mucosa-associated E. coli isolates HM427 and HM288 (both inhibited by \u03fe80% using Bay 11-7082). All experiments were conducted in triplicate. Significant differences from basal IL-8 release, ***P \u03fd 0.001; and from E. coli-induced IL-8 release, (***)P \u03fd 0.001 (ANOVA). B: Immunoblot showing downregulation of NF-B p65 subunit by siRNA. Equal loading was confirmed using pan actin and ERK2 monoclonal antibodies. p65 downregulation was calculated to be 62 \u03ee 18% (n \u03ed 3; P \u03fd 0.0001, Student's t-test). lium in response to coronoviral infection. 57 Thus, the epithelial cell is the main target cell for 5-ASA therapy, whereas hydrocortisone exerts its effect mainly by acting on other cells such as T cells, 58 monocytes, 59 macrophages, 60 and dendritic cells. 61 It is also consistent with the fact that inhibition of NF-B activation, which is a principal target for corticosteroids, only had a minor effect on epithelial IL-8 response to mucosal E. coli in the current study. The potential role of adhesive and invasive E. coli in colon cancer is intriguing. There are similarities between the biology of sporadic colon cancer and IBD-associated cancer. 37 Epithelial activation of NF-B is critical in the development of inflammation-associated cancer, probably acting via suppression of apoptosis. 62 The adherent and adhesive mucosal E. coli isolates are able to invade colon cancer cell lines in vitro 4 and the present study also suggests that at least some of these bacteria are able to activate NF-B in these colon cancer cells. It is therefore reasonable to speculate that adherence to or invasion of dysplastic epithelial cells by such E. coli could have an important role in determining progression from dysplasia to cancer.",
