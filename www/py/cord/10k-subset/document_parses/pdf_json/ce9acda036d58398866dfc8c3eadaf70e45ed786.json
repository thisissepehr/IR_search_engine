In CKD3-5 and CKD5D, significant decrease in circulating ACE2 activity was observed when compared with CONT, but no differences were found between CKD3-5 and CKD5 when performing paired case-control studies. By multivariate linear regression analysis, male gender and advanced age were identified as independent predictors of ACE2 activity in all groups. Diabetes was identified as independent predictor of ACE2 activity in CKD3-5. Significant increase in the activity of circulating ACE was found in CKD3-5 and CKD5D when compared with CONT and in CKD5D when compared with CKD3-5. By multiple regression analysis, female gender and younger age were identified as independent predictors of ACE activity in CONT and CKD3-5. Diabetes was also identified as an independent predictor of ACE activity in CKD3-5 patients. Conclusions. Circulating ACE2 and ACE activities can be measured in human EDTA-plasma samples with zinc added to recover enzymatic activity. In a CKD population without previous history of CV disease, ACE2 activity from human EDTA-plasma samples directly correlated with the classical CV risk factors namely older age, diabetes and male gender. Our data suggest that circulating ACE2 is altered in CKD patients at risk for CV event.",

Previous studies have found an independent association between lower levels of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the risk of CV disease (death, CV events and hospitalization). This risk is evident at an estimated GFR of <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and increases with an estimated GFR of <45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [2] . The mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of CV disease in CKD are complex and include both traditional and non-traditional CV risk factors [3] . Nonetheless, it is well known that enhanced activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), among others, plays a major role in the progression of cardiac and renal injury [4] .",

AngII increases blood pressure and contributes to cardiac remodelling, fibrosis, inflammation, thrombosis and plaque rupture [6] . In 2000, ACE2, an enzyme that cleaves the C-terminal amino acid of AngII to generate the peptide Ang1-7, was identified [7] . Ang1-7 acts via the Mas receptor to counteract the adverse effects of AngII [8] . Previous experimental studies have reported that downregulation of ACE2 leads to age-dependent development of glomerular mesangial expansion, accelerated progression of glomerulosclerosis, tubular injury, macrophage infiltration and interstitial fibrosis [9] [10] [11] .",

Initial studies in a large cohort were able to detect circulating ACE2 activity in only 7.5% of the subjects, and it was \u223c100-fold lower than ACE [12] . Interestingly, subjects with detectable ACE2 were older than those without and had a higher prevalence of CV disease, diabetes and hypertension suggesting that ACE2 may be upregulated in subjects with CV disease to counteract the adverse effect of AngII. Subsequent studies demonstrated that circulating ACE2 activity could also be detected in healthy subjects [13] and that soluble ACE2 activity increases in heart failure patients, acute myocardial infarction [14] , and correlates with the severity of the heart disease [15] . Circulating ACE2 levels increased in patients with type 1 diabetes and vascular complications [16] . Our group also demonstrated that circulating ACE2 activity can be measured in kidney transplant patients (KT), suggesting that it may be used as a non-invasive marker to understand the role of RAS in KT [17] . Recently, Roberts et al. showed that plasma ACE2 activity was lower in patients undergoing haemodialysis than in pre-dialysis patients with CKD [18] . However, circulating ACE2 activity has not been studied in CKD patients without previous history of CV events. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the levels of circulating ACE2 and ACE activities in CKD patients without any history of CV disease and to determine the factors associated with circulating ACE2 and ACE activities in this population.",

Plasma samples were collected into tubes containing EDTA, a chelating agent of loosely bound metal ions such as Zn 2+ , which acts as a cofactor for carboxypeptidases. As EDTA inhibits ACE2 and ACE activities [22] , zinc chloride (ZnCl 2 ) was added to the plasma samples to avoid its bounding. Briefly, 2 \u00b5L of plasma was incubated with buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 600 mM NaCl, 10 \u00b5M ZnCl 2 , pH 7.5) in the presence of protease inhibitors (100 \u00b5M captopril, 5 \u00b5M amastatin, 5 \u00b5M bestatin and 10 \u00b5M Z-Proprolinal) and in the presence of different concentrations of ZnCl 2 (0, 0.5, 1 and 3 mM) ( Figure 1A ). Samples were incubated with 20 \u00b5M of the quenched fluorescent substrate in reaction buffer (final volume 100 \u00b5L) at 37\u00b0C for 16 h. The optimal concentration of ZnCl 2 for the determination of ACE2 activity was 0.5 mM. ACE2 activity was also calculated in heparin-plasma and serum samples from 21 subjects as previously described [14, 17] . We performed a standard curve of the recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2, Calbiochem) adding increasing quantities of rhACE2 (0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 ng) ( Figure 1C ). In a set of experiments, serum and EDTA-plasma samples were incubated with rhACE2 in the presence or absence of ZnCl 2 . Experiments were carried out in duplicate, and results were expressed as RFU/\u00b5L plasma/hour.",

The chelating agent EDTA completely inhibits tissue ACE2 and soluble secreted ACE2 from chinese hamster ovary cell media activity, by chelating the zinc ion required for the metalloprotease activity [22, 25] . Hence, we made an effort to measure ACE2 activity in EDTA-plasma samples. We demonstrated by adding zinc chloride and subsequently avoiding the EDTA chelating effect that ACE2 and ACE activities could be measured. Roberts et al.

In agreement with Roberts et al., we initially found circulating ACE2 activity decreased in dialysis patients. As expected, measurement of circulating ACE2 pre-and post-dialysis showed no differences (data not shown), demonstrating that the enzyme is not removed by dialysis. One surmises that the haemodialysis itself could not alter the levels of the ACE2 activity in plasma owing to its large molecular size [26] . In our study, dialysis patients were younger than CKD3-5 and control groups. When paired case-control studies were performed, the differences among the CKD groups were not observed, suggesting that the decrease in ACE2 within the dialysis patients may be ascribed to age.

Data from animal models suggest that soluble ACE2 shedding is stimulated by the tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 convertase ADAM17 [27] [28] [29] . It is possible that the increase in ACE2 in males may be related to the increase in ADAM17 shedding. Further studies focused on the ADAM17/ACE2 axis and gender differences are needed to confirm this premise. Many studies have associated circulating ACE2 activity with higher risk of CV disease. Epelman et al. [15] have previously demonstrated that circulating ACE2 activity is elevated in patients with diagnosis of heart failure. In recent studies from our group, we showed that ACE2 activity is up-regulated in the acute phase of ST-elevation myocardial infarction and correlates with the infarct size [14] . Furthermore, KT patients with a previous history of ischaemic heart disease presented increased ACE2 activity [17] . Soro-Paavonen et al. demonstrated that circulating ACE2 increased in patients with diabetes and decreased eGFR or other vascular complications such as CV disease [16] . In concordance, in our study, we demonstrated that ACE2 activity also increases in diabetic CKD patients and it correlates with glycosylated haemoglobin. In mice with experimental diabetes, ACE2 activity increased in the renal cortex and in the circulation, suggesting a potential mechanism to adapt to diabetes-associated AngII overactivity [21, 22] . As circulating ACE2 activity increase starts at an early stage of diabetes and correlates with GFR, the measurement of ACE2 activity may become a new biomarker of CV disease in CKD.",

We have demonstrated that ACE activity correlates with the classical CV risk factors such as male, advanced age and diabetes in CKD3-5. As expected, ACEi therapy was inversely associated with ACE activity in all groups. In concordance with our results, some studies have found lower levels of circulating ACE in subjects with a history of hypertension [12] and higher levels in diabetic patients with renal complications [30] . However, other studies have not found a relationship between circulating ACE and the classical CV risk factors [17, 31, 32] . We surmise that the incongruences observed between studies and populations may be ascribed to the effect of RAS blockade on circulating ACE. For ethical reasons, RAS blockade agents were not stopped for the study.",

In addition, ACE2 activity directly correlated with the classical CV risk factors such as male gender, diabetes and older age. These findings may have therapeutic implications for CV disease and help to delay the progression of CKD. Prospective studies with a shortand long-term follow-up will help us to elucidate the ACE2 role as a biomarker in CKD.",

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitis with renal involvement requires treatment with potentially toxic drugs to reduce morbidity and mortality, and there is a major challenge to determine clinical and histological features predictive of renal prognosis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the use of the 2010 international histological classification for ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis (AAGN) as a predictor of renal outcome when used in conjunction with other prognostic factors. Methods. One hundred and four patients with AAGN treated at our centre were included: 23 were classified as focal, 26 as crescentic, 48 as mixed and 7 as sclerotic. Renal outcomes were based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 1 and 5 years, and on renal survival. Results. By univariate analysis, patients in the focal class had the best renal outcome, those in the sclerotic class the worst outcome, and those in the mixed and crescentic classes had intermediate renal survival. There was no significant difference in outcome between the mixed and crescentic classes. In multivariate models, histological class did not improve model fit or associate with renal outcome after adjusting for established prognostic factors. Lower percentage of normal glomeruli, greater degree of tubular atrophy (TA), MPO-ANCA positivity, increasing age and lower starting eGFR, all correlated with poorer renal outcomes. Conclusions. We conclude that, in our cohort of patients, the international histological classification is predictive of renal outcome in AAGN, but did not appear to be additionally informative over other established prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. However, it may be of value to combine the current histological classification with other established parameters, such as TA and percentage normal glomeruli.Keywords: ANCA, clinical outcome, glomerulonephritis, renal pathology, vasculitis",
