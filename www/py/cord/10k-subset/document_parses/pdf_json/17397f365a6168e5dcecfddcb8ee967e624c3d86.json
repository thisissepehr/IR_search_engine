Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-related pulmonary toxicity has been documented in cancer patients, and experimental models suggest a role for G-CSF in acute lung injury during neutropenia recovery. We reviewed 20 cases of noncardiac acute respiratory failure during G-CSFinduced neutropenia recovery. Half the patients had received hematopoietic stem cell transplants. All patients experienced pulmonary infiltrates during neutropenia followed by respiratory status deterioration coinciding with neutropenia recovery. Neutropenia duration was 10 (4-22) days, and time between respiratory symptoms and the first day with more than 1000 leukocytes/mm 3 was 1 (\u00c00.5 to 2) day. Of the 20 patients, 16 received invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation, including 14 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Five patients died, with refractory ARDS. In patients with pulmonary infiltrates during neutropenia, G-CSF-induced neutropenia recovery carries a risk of respiratory status deterioration with acute lung injury or ARDS. Clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for this diagnosis, which requires eliminating another cause of acute respiratory failure, G-CSF discontinuation and ICU transfer for early supportive management including diagnostic confirmation and noninvasive mechanical ventilation. prognosis; cancer; hematological malignancies Acute respiratory failure is a major cause of morbidity in cancer patients. About 20% of patients with solid tumors or hematological malignancies present with a respiratory complication, 1 and pulmonary disease occurs in about half the patients with neutropenia or bone marrow transplantation. Acute respiratory failure is the main reason for ICU admission in cancer patients; 1-4 the mortality rate ranges from 50 to 80%, and a need for mechanical ventilation is the main predictor of death. 5 However, recent advances including strategies for early diagnosis, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and better knowledge of clinical patterns such as leukemic pulmonary infiltration have translated into improved outcomes. [6] [7] [8] [9] In cancer patients, neutropenia recovery may be associated with a deterioration in oxygenation and exacerbation of pre-existing pulmonary disease. 10 In a previous study, we found that the main risk factor for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during neutropenia recovery was the occurrence of pneumonia during the neutropenic period. 11 Human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is the most important regulatory cytokine capable of stimulating neutrophil production from committed hematopoietic progenitor cells, both in vitro and in vivo. 12, 13 G-CSF is widely used in cancer patients to reduce the duration of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, most notably after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and lymphoma treatments. In this last case, G-CSF allows closer spacing of chemotherapy courses, thereby substantially improving the prognosis. 14, 15 Although G-CSF is generally safe and well tolerated, there have been several reports of acute respiratory failure during G-CSF-induced neutropenia recovery. 16, 17 G-CSF is believed to enhance cytokine production and to activate the oxidative burst within circulating or resident alveolar neutrophils and macrophages. 11, 18 Because early diagnosis and treatment are key determinants of survival in cancer patients with acute respiratory failure related to neutropenia recovery, a careful and close clinical monitoring of respiratory symptoms (respiratory rate, heart rate, and oxygen saturation) must be proposed in this condition. To help clinicians bear in mind the increased risk of acute respiratory failure during G-CSF-induced neutropenia recovery in cancer patients, we describe 20 cases seen in our intensive care unit (ICU) over a 22-month period.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1967, "end": 1968, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2194, "end": 2197, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2198, "end": 2201, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2202, "end": 2205, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2206, "end": 2209, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2357, "end": 2359, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2554, "end": 2556, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2770, "end": 2773, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2774, "end": 2776, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3083, "end": 3086, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3087, "end": 3089, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3247, "end": 3250, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3251, "end": 3253, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3408, "end": 3411, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3412, "end": 3414, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary:"}, {"text": "to the medical ICU of the Saint-Louis Teaching Hospital, Paris, France, between June 1, 2002 and April 1, 2004, were prospectively included.

In all patients, pulmonary infiltrates developed during the neutropenic period and worsened at neutropenia recovery. These cases support published evidence that G-CSF-induced neutropenia recovery carries All 20 patients received cancer chemotherapy agents known to cause pulmonary toxicity. However, none was considered to have chemotherapy-related pulmonary toxicity, and most of the survivors received further cancer chemotherapy without experiencing recurrent pulmonary disorders. However, as previously suggested, 16 G-CSFrelated pulmonary toxicity occurs more frequently in patients who received previously at least three courses of cancer chemotherapy, suggesting that G-CSF enhances alveolar inflammation after repeated endothelial damage by chemotherapy agents. 16, 18, 22 The first pulmonary event in our patients was pulmonary infiltrates during neutropenia without a need for ICU admission. Acute respiratory failure requiring ICU admission occurred later, during neutropenia recovery. Although pathogens were recovered in only half our patients, previous data suggest that G-CSF and neutropenia recovery merely exacerbate previous lung injury, possibly via accumulation of neutrophils in the lungs. 23, 24 However, as previously reported in this entity, macrophages, but not neutrophils, were recovered from BAL fluid, suggesting that acute lung injury during neutropenia recovery may be nosologically similar to ARDS during neutropenia. 25, 26 In a lamb model of experimental lung injury, G-CSF-enhanced alveolar neutrophil functions, increasing both cytokine production and oxidative burst. 27, 28 G-CSF upregulates the production of cytokines that increase alveolar permeability or neutrophil influx, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) a, interleukin (IL) 1b, and IL-8. 29, 30 In vitro studies also found enhanced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by isolated alveolar macrophages obtained during neutropenia recovery from rats that received G-CSF, compared with rats that did not receive G-CSF, providing a possible explanation for lung injury exacerbation during G-CSF-induced neutropenia recovery. 18 Our study has some limitations, however. First, we only report cases of critically ill patients with acute lung injury or ARDS during G-CSF-induced neutropenia recovery, but we do not report the magnitude of the risk. A prospective observation of the incidence and risk factors for respiratory symptoms (whatever the severity) during G-CSF-induced neutropenia recovery is timely. Second, further study should also seek to evaluate biological markers reflecting epithelial and endothelial injury that characterizes the disease, so as to help clinicians easily diagnose ARDS during G-CSF-induced neutropenia recovery. Third, G-CSF has been investigated in large randomized trials in cancer and noncancer patients without any report of pulmonary toxicity. However, these studies were not powered for detecting such pulmonary complications. Moreover, we believe that noncancer patients receiving G-CSF are not expecting to present with pulmonary toxicity since they do not receive cancer chemotherapy. Indeed, without neutropenia recovery, nor chemotherapy-related repeated endothelial injuries, the clinical condition we describe should not occur. Last, we did not demonstrate that G-CSF withdrawal resulted in respiratory improvement. However, G-CSF discontinua- tion is in order after neutropenia recovery, and since G-CSF-related pulmonary toxicity has been reported, all nonmandatory drugs potentially harmful for the lung should be stopped in case of severe respiratory failure. Survival of cancer patients admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure has improved in recent years. In the present study, the 25% mortality rate was far lower than expected in a population of critically ill cancer patients with severe disease, and a high rate of mechanical ventilation. This encouraging survival rate may be related mainly to early G-CSF discontinuation (at acute respiratory failure onset), early diagnosis, and effective early supportive care. This study, together with previous data from animals and humans, strongly suggests the harmful effect of G-CSF in some cancer patients who experience pulmonary infection during neutropenia. G-CSF is widely used in cancer patients and has substantially improved the safety of cancer chemotherapy and the prognosis of many malignancies. This agent is generally safe. Nevertheless, it may exacerbate respiratory disorders related to chemotherapyassociated pulmonary toxicity. The exacerbation occurs during neutropenia recovery. Physicians should be aware of this risk and should exercise great caution when using G-CSF in neutropenic patients with pulmonary involvement.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 144, "end": 147, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 148, "end": 150, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 273, "end": 276, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 277, "end": 279, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 940, "end": 942, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1195, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1196, "end": 1199, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1200, "end": 1202, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1633, "end": 1636, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1637, "end": 1639, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1872, "end": 1875, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1876, "end": 1878, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2027, "end": 2030, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2031, "end": 2033, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2208, "end": 2211, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2212, "end": 2214, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2544, "end": 2546, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In summary, in patients with pulmonary infiltrates during neutropenia, G-CSF-induced neutropenia recovery carries a risk of respiratory deterioration due to acute lung injury or ARDS.
