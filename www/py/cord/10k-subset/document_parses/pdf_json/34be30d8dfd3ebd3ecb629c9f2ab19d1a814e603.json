Each chapter presents aetiology, clinical signs and lesions, effects on the developing foetus, necropsy findings, diagnosis, epidemiology, prevention and control and issues on eradication, international trade and public health. Each chapter is self-contained and provides a useful summary of each disease. This text covers a broad range of subject matter in order to provide a wide appeal. The moderate length of the book has resulted in a brief discussion on each topic. As a result this text is at best an introduction to many viral diseases and principles", "authors": [], "year": null, "venue": "T his book provides both the scientific principles of virology and the practical day-to-day application of theory in dealing with viral diseases of cattle.
