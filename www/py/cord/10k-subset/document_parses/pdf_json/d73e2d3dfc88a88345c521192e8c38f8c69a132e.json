            "text": "Infectious HCV carrying reporter genes have further applications in understanding the HCV life cycle including replication, viral assembly and release. In this study, a full-length 3039bp LacZ gene was inserted into the derivative of JFH1-AM120 to develop an additional reporter virus. The results showed that the recombinant reporter virus JFH1-AM120-LacZ can replicate and produce lower titers of infectious virus. However, insertion of the LacZ gene in the C-terminal region of the NS5A in HCV JFH1-AM120-LacZ decreased viral replication and dramatically impaired the production of infectious viral particles. Moreover, the JFH1-AM120-LacZ reporter virus lost the LacZ gene after serial passage. Nevertheless, the JFH1-AM120-LacZ reporter virus displayed the entire life cycle of HCV, from replication to production of infectious virus, in Huh7.5 cells. This study demonstrates that the NS5A region of HCV JFH1-AM120 has the capacity to accommodate large foreign genes up to 3,039 bp and suggests that other relatively large gene inserts can be accommodated at this site.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family and is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA. It infects approximately 3% of the worldwide population (1, 2) . HCV can cause acute and chronic hepatitis, and lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (3) . Although much progress has been made in developing highly effective HCV antivirals, an effective vaccine has yet to be developed (4, 5) . An internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of HCV drives RNA translation to produce a polyprotein of approximately 3,000 amino acids (aa) that encodes both structural and nonstructural proteins (6) (7) (8) . The development of HCV replicon systems advanced the understanding of HCV replication, viral protein processing and viral-host cell interactions (9, 10 ). An establishment of an infectious HCV cell culture system using a genotype 2a isolate (JFH1 strain) of HCV and Huh-7 cells was a major achievement (11) (12) (13) . In this system, infectious HCV particles are secreted in an envelope glycoproteindependent manner and enable a variety of questions to be answered regarding HCV biology and cell infection. However, virus titers of JFH1 released from infected cells are relatively low and limit some applications of this system. Studies have identified adaptive or compensatory mutations that enhance infectious virus particle production from either wild-type JFH1 or intergenotypic chimeras (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) .",

However, a higher titer of HCV reporter virus was produced after inserting EGFP and Rluc into NS5A C-terminus of an adaptively mutated JFH1 strain designated JFH1-AM120 (18) . In this study, we used the JFH1-AM120 as a vector to explore if infectious reporter virus would be produced following insertion of LacZ gene that was three time larger than Rluc, into the NS5A C-terminus. The result showed that the NS5A region of HCV JFH1-AM120 has the capacity to accommodate large foreign genes up to 3,039 bp and suggests that other relatively large gene inserts can be accommodated at this site.",

RNAs were transcribed from plasmids of JFH1-AM120, JFH1-AM120-EGFP, JFH1-AM120-Rluc and JFH1-AM120-LacZ and were transfected to Huh7.5 cells to determine whether cells transfected with the RNAs from each plasmid expressed HCV proteins and HCV RNA. Three days after RNA transfection of cells, wild-type NS5A (58kd) and the NS5A-EGFP (84kd), NS5A-Rluc (92kd) and NS5A-LacZ (169kd) fusion protein with the predicted molecular mass were detected in cell lysate by western blotting (Fig. 2A) . However, the band of NS5A-LacZ protein was obviously weaker than NS5A and other fusion proteins. The HCV RNAs were also quantified by qPCR. The results showed that HCV RNA amounts (Fig. 2B ) correlated with changes in protein levels by western blotting. These results indicated that the replication level of JFH1-AM120-LacZ was significantly decreased after insertion of LacZ gene into the NS5A C-terminal of JFH1-AM120. However, JFH1-AM120-LacZ can still replicate in Huh7.5 cells even though the LacZ gene is 3039bp in length. Fig. 1 . Schematic representation of HCV constructs used in this study.

Supernatants collected from the cells transfected with RNAs from JFH1-AM120, JFH1-AM120-EGFP and JFH1-AM120-Rluc were used as controls. At three days post-infection, the cells infected with the supernatant of JFH-AM120-LacZ were stained by X-gal and blue color cells were detected, while all of the others were negative. EGFP positive cells were only found in JFH-AM120-EGFP infected cells. JFH1-AM120 and JFH1-AM120-Rluc infected cells expressed NS5A and NS5A-Rluc, as determined by the immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The viral titers are expressed as focus-forming units per milliliter of supernatant (ffu/ml). The titer of JFH1-AM120, JFH1-AM120-EGFP, JFH1-AM120-Rluc and JFH1-AM120-LacZ were 5.5x10 5 ffu/ml, 4.5x10 4 ffu/ml, 4.2x10 4 ffu/ml and 0.98x10 2 ffu/ml, respectively. The viral titers of JFH1-AM120-EGFP and JFH1-AM120-Rluc were about 10 times lower than JFH-AM120, however, the titer of JFH1-AM120-LacZ was dramatically lower (more than 5000 times) compared to JFH-AM120 (Fig.4) . These results demonstrated that the insertion of LacZ in NS5A C-terminal region of JFH1-AM120 significantly impaired the production of infectious viral particles. This result provided direct evidence that long exogenous genes can influence the capability of infectious HCV virus production at difference levels with a gene length dependent manner. Fig. 3 .

The size of the NS5A-WT, NS5A-EGFP and NS5A-Rluc PCR products did not change at P1 and P5. However, the size of NS5A-LacZ PCR product was reverted to the same size of the NS5A-WT product at P5. This PCR product was sequenced and only six nucletitides of the LacZ gene remained, while the other nucleotides of the LacZ gene were absent, providing direct evidence for the loss of the LacZ gene with multiple passaging of cells. On the Fig. 2A and 6B , a weak band of similar size to wild-type NS5A were seen in the LacZ lane. This suggests that the deletion of the LacZ gene may occur early in the first passage.

Our results demonstrate that the LacZ reporter gene can be inserted into the NS5A C-terminus of HCV JFH1-AM120 and will express the predicted NS5A-LacZ fusion protein, which can be detected by western blotting three days after RNA transfection of cells. However, compared to the control vectors of JFH1-AM120, JFH1-AM120-EGFP and JFH1-AM120-Rluc, there was an obvious decrease in the expression of the NS5A fusion protein ( Fig. 2A) . \u03b2-galactosidase was also detected in these cells by several measures (Fig.3 ) and the supernatants of these cells produced infectious virus of JFH1-AM120-LacZ (Fig.4) . However, the infectious virus titer was much lower, 0.98 x10 2 ffu/ml compared to 5.5x10 5 ffu/ml of parent JFH1-AM120 virus. In addition, the titer of infectious HCV JFH1-AM120-LacZ progressively decreased with serial passaging of cells, with the eventual loss of X-gal positive cells (Fig.5) . This observation is consistent with Western blot and NS5A PCR analysis indicating the loss of the LacZ reporter gene (Fig.6) . The reason for the loss of the inserted LacZ reporter gene is unclear. There may be three possible mechanisms on it. First, the HCV genome RNA might have the capability of repairing itself and removing exogenous genes. Second, the HCV NS5A gene has a limit to it's carrying capacity for exogenous genes, and LacZ is too large for stable expression. Third, the combined effects of viral RNA repair, expression stability and replication might result in LacZ depletion in some strains, which could become the dominant strains during subsequent replication process, and this is consistent with the basic principle of natural adaptive mutation selection. 6 . Stability assay of JFH1-AM120-LacZ and controls followed the RNA transfection. (A) Huh7.5 cells were transfected with the RNA of JFH1-AM120-LacZ and controls of JFH1-AM120, JFH1-AM120-EGFP and JFH1-AM120-Rluc and the cells were passaged at every three days for a total of 15 days. The cells of passage 1 ( Fig.2A) and passage 5 were lysed for Western blotting using anti-NS5A and anti-\u03b2-actin bodies as described in Methods.The experiment was performed twice and representative example are shown. (B & C) Detection of HCV RNA. Huh7.5 cells were transfected with the RNA of JFH1-AM120-LacZ and controls of JFH1-AM120, JFH1-AM120-EGFP and JFH1-AM120-Rluc and the cells were passaged at every three days for a total of 15 days. The total RNA was extracted and RT-PCR was performed described as in methods. The PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Experiments were performed two times and a representative experiment is shown (B showed passage 1 st result and C showed passage 5 th result).",

The production of infectious JFH1-AM120-LacZ virions reported here demonstrate that much larger gene inserts can be engineered into the C terminus of NS5A of JFH1-AM120 for other applications and approaches. However, the instability of this reporter virus and the loss of LacZ gene are likely to limit its use. Nevertheless, the fact that a reporter gene up to 3039bp in size can be inserted into the C terminus of NS5A indicates that additional studies can be performed to guide further engineering of JFH1-AM120 in the research of HCV.",

The cells of passage 1 (Fig.2A) and passage 5 were lysed for Western blotting using anti-NS5A and anti-\u03b2-actin bodies as described in Methods.The experiment was performed twice and representative example are shown. (B & C) Detection of HCV RNA. Huh7.5 cells were transfected with the RNA of JFH1-AM120-LacZ and controls of JFH1-AM120, JFH1-AM120-EGFP and JFH1-AM120-Rluc and the cells were passaged at every three days for a total of 15 days. The total RNA was extracted and RT-PCR was performed described as in methods. The PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Experiments were performed two times and a representative experiment is shown (B showed passage 1 st result and C showed passage 5 th result).",
