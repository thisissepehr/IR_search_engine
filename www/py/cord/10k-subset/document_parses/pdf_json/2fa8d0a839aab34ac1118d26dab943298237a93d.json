In this response paper, we join in the discussion by highlighting five issues-progress, paradigms, puzzles, promise, and potential research directions of social indicators research. In terms of progress, while we have accomplished many tasks proposed by Solomon et al. (The quality of life, Sage, London 1980), some of them are yet to be achieved. Regarding research paradigms surrounding social indicators, researchers have primarily used positivistic or post-positivistic orientation to conduct and interpret social indicators research, with relatively fewer studies using interpretive, constructionist or critical theory perspective. There are also several puzzles deserving consideration. These include (a) the use of ''other types of evidence'', particularly qualitative data; (b) evaluation of social programs; (c) feasibility of assessing ''social progress''; (d) choice of social indicators; (e) interpretation of findings; (f) methodological debates; and (g) explanations for social change. Finally, the promise of social indicators research to promote quality of life and potential future research directions of social indicators research are discussed.",

As it is a ''heavy weight'' paper written by two gurus in the field of social indicators, it is a ''must read'' paper by students and researchers in the field of social indicators research.",

I will discuss the progress of the Social Indicator Movement with reference to the tasks that social indicators researchers should accomplish as described by Solomon et al. (1980) . Concerning paradigms of research on social progress, we argue that quality of life research in different paradigms generates different pictures on ''social progress''. Regarding puzzles in social indicators research, we consider several issues, including the role of qualitative data, role of evaluation in social programs, feasibility of assessing social progress, choice of social indicators to be used, interpretations of findings, methodological debates and explanations for social change. We will then examine, how social indicators research findings can inform policy according to its original promise. Finally, future research directions will be highlighted. Solomon et al. (1980) suggested a list of tasks to be undertaken at the initial stage of the Social Indicators Movement. It would be interesting to ask the extent to which such tasks are accomplished after roughly 36 years.",

            "text": "\u2022 Task 1-''Studying objective life conditions and subjective life quality experience and their inter-relationships'' As pointed out by Land and Michalos (2015) , many frameworks for measuring objective life conditions have been developed and numerous studies have been conducted. Similarly, many studies on subjective life quality experience have been conducted. However, studies on the inter-relationships between these two domains seem not to have been the primary focus in the field. Thus, it is important to find ways to align these two domains in future. \u2022 Task 2-''Beyond description of conditions and experiences and to explore relationships amongst interdependent factors'' While models of objective indicators and experiences of life quality have been constructed and tested, more work is needed to explore the ''interdependent'' factors. \u2022 Task 3-''To examine life quality not just on the societal level but also group and individual levels, and investigate their inter-relationships'' While most of the existing studies have examined quality of life at the societal level, there are comparatively fewer studies examining group and individual life quality. There are even fewer studies investigating the inter-relationships amongst quality of life on the different levels. \u2022 Task 4-''To understand how individuals and groups participate to create their life quality'' Most of the related studies focus on quality of life outcomes (social indicators of outcomes) with few studies examining how people create their life quality and the related process. There is a need to focus more on the human agency. \u2022 Task 5-''To treat quality of life as a dynamic process than a static state'' Although objective social indicators are usually collected over time, researchers usually regard the construct as static state. Explanations of the changes are commonly ad hoc in nature. Moreover, longitudinal research on subjective life studies is not common. \u2022 Task 6-''Foster cross-cultural comparisons and encourage institutions and international organizations to collaborate'' There are emerging studies examining crosscultural comparisons but the development is still in its infancy (Shek et al. 2005a; Shek 2010 Shek , 2011 . Collaboration amongst institutions and international organizations is growing but is yet to mature. \u2022 Task 7-''To stimulate quality of life research in places without related research tradition'' We have seen some progress in non-Western contexts, such as studies conducted in Asia (Chua et al. 2010; Ip and Shek 2014) . However, the five illustrative examples given by Land and Michalos are all projects in English speaking communities. \u2022 Task 8-''Reflection and recognition about cultural differences'' This is a neglected aspect in the movement. Social indicators researchers have commonly assumed that the indicators are universally valid, and can be used in different cultures. Even though some social indicators researchers recognize cultural differences, the related reflection is not substantial. \u2022 Task 9-''Promoting inter-disciplinary projects'' We witnessed inter-disciplinary collaboration amongst sociologists, political scientists, social workers, and social policy scholars who were more focused on the ''macro'' aspect of quality of life. However, the link between macro and micro disciplines (such as Psychology) remains to be achieved. For example, epidemiological studies are commonly conducted in psychology, psychiatry or mental health. However, such findings are seldom mentioned in social indicators research. \u2022 Task 10-''Regard biophysical and social environment and their perception as basic elements of quality of life'' Most studies have actually mostly done this. However, the spiritual dimension, despite its importance, is not commonly included in social indicators research. \u2022 Task 11-''Conduct projects that have relevance for decision-makers'' Some studies have attempted to do this, although some social indicators research (particularly those involving ranking of different sites) simply promote understanding without much relevance to decision-makers.",

The choice of research paradigm does not only dictate the research methods but also the interpretations of findings (Neuman and Kreuger 2003) . Hence, it is important to reflect about social indicators research conducted within different paradigms. To be simple, we can regard paradigm as a lens through which we can see and understand the reality, such as social progress. It addresses the issue of ontology (i.e., the nature of reality one assumes, including whether it exists or not), epistemology (i.e., the question of ''how do we know?'') and methodology (i.e., ways through which the reality can be known).",

Positivistic or post-positivistic research on social progress demands the use of social science methods involving deductive logic and precise observations with the research objectives of discovering and testing generalizable nomothetic universal laws, which can predict human behavior. Researchers adopting a positivistic or post-positivistic paradigm typically assume that social reality is stable over time and preexisting regularities can be scientifically studied.

Second, the dualist assumption of the separation between theories and observations of facts is questionable and many researchers argue that ''facts'' are in fact theory-laden (i.e., thinking shaped by some existing preoccupation). Third, the thesis that it is possible to be totally objective may not be tenable because values and facts are value-laden and interdependent.

Instead of relying on hypothetical-deductive models and supposedly ''objective'' observations, the purpose of research is to understand social reality that cannot be fully understood in terms of causal laws. As it is assumed that social reality is fluid and there are no preexisting regularities, individual interpretations and social constructions are important. According to this paradigm, common sense is an important source of understanding and values are indispensable in the research process. In contrast to the positivistic practice of using precise measurement, interpretive and constructionist social scientists commonly use interviews, narrative research, natural observations, qualitative studies, and ethnography. Hence, profiles based on social indicators are regarded as ''naive realism'' because social reality is always fluid and thus beyond the description by static statistical indicators. Statistical models can generate good maps but such maps are without ''blood and flesh'' and ''lived experience'' that cannot help people understand the experience of individuals and social groups.",

For example, according to neo-Marxian thoughts, growth in GDP does not necessarily reflect social progress because the working class is exploited by the capitalists. In fact, because of its dynamic nature, exploitation, inequalities and injustice cannot be fully reflected in statistical measures.

For example, they would understand the subjective experiences of those who have to pay high mortgage or live in places with very bad environment, such as sub-divided flats and ''coffin rooms'' (very small rooms in Hong Kong).",

Obviously, there has been an abundance of statistical studies and statistical series in this area in the past 50 years. Nevertheless, the use of ''other forms of evidence'' such as qualitative data and mixed-methods data to reflect our position and direction is comparatively less widespread. There are several fundamental features of quantitative research (Leung and Shek 2011; Lincoln and Guba 2000; Patton 2002a, b) . Firstly, its philosophical orientation is positivistic or post-positivistic and it assumes that the nature of reality is independent of human consciousness and that it is governed by causal laws. Secondly, it aims at discovering universal laws (i.e. nomothetic emphasis). Thirdly, the knowledge is achieved through ''fact accumulation'' where the facts are presumed to be derived from sense-impressions, which are value-neutral. Fourthly, the role of research is to explain and predict phenomena using measured variables with reliability and validity as quality criteria. Fifthly, quantitative research attempts to confirm theories through testing hypothetical deductive models. Lastly, to ensure the objectivity of a study, quantitative research favors artificial research arrangement where the variables can be controlled.",

Patton (2002c) proposed five sets of criteria for judging the quality and credibility of qualitative research. These include: (a) traditional scientific research criteria (e.g., objectivity of inquirer, correspondence of findings to reality, systematic rigor of research procedures), (b) constructivist criteria (e.g., authenticity, connects and moves the audience, reflexivity), (c) artistic and evocative criteria (e.g., aesthetic quality, creativity, interpretive vitality), (d) critical change criteria (e.g., increase of consciousness about injustice, voices of less powerful group, historical and value contexts); and (e) pragmatic criteria (e.g., utility, feasibility and balanced approach). Patton (2002c) pointed out that ''many researchers mix and match approaches'' (p. 271) and he has ''worked with and mixed criteria from all five frameworks to match particular designs to the needs and interests of specific stakeholders and clients' ' (p. 271-272) .",

According to Datta (1994) , there are five forceful and pragmatic reasons for integrating these two methods: (a) researchers have used both methods for a long time; (b) there are arguments supporting the use of both methods; (c) both methods are supported by funding bodies; (d) both methods and related findings have been used in social policies; and (e) we have learned much from both paradigms. Greene et al. (1989) also noted five reasons to combine quantitative and qualitative methods in a single study. First, mixing methods (especially triangulation) can help to seek convergence of findings. For example, it is possible to show by using statistical data and subjective interviews that ordinary people cannot afford to buy a flat. Second, complementarity mixed methods study is able to bring out different opinions about a phenomenon. For example, while quantitative housing affordability index suggests that housing is not affordable, qualitative interview data can give some indication how paying the high mortgage affects negatively people's lives. Third, researchers can combine qualitative and quantitative methods in a developmental manner where the first method helps to inform the second method. For example, based on the housing affordability index information which suggests that housing is a problem, researchers can then carry out field observations about the lived experiences of people. Fourth, mixed methods research can help to deal with contradictions in findings with the emergence of fresh perspectives (i.e., initiation). For example, researchers can use qualitative methods to understand the contradiction observed in the quantitative data, such as increase in income but decrease in happiness. Finally, mixed methods can be used to add more understanding to a study (i.e., expansion). For example, qualitative research can be carried out to understand the information provided by the housing affordability index.",

Interestingly, two observations can be highlighted on the use of social indicators in the evaluation of social programs. First, comparing with description and monitoring functions of social indicators, the evaluation function of social indicators has been given relatively weaker weight. One possible explanation is that macro social indicators such as indicators at the national level may not be sensitive measures for social programs, which may be more individualistic and community-based. It also takes time for social intervention programs to create outcomes, which can impact on changes in social indicators. Nevertheless, for specific areas such as welfare, security and health, social indicators have been frequently used to reflect the effect of social intervention-poverty rates have been used to reflect the effectiveness of poverty alleviation programs; substance abuse rates have been used to reflect community anti-drug programs; infection diseases rates have been used to reflect flu shot programs.",

According to Patton (2008) , program evaluation is ''the systematic application of research to inform evaluative judgments. It involves the systematic collection of empirical information about the activities, characteristics, and outcomes of programs to make judgments about the program's merit or worth, improve program effectiveness, and/or inform decisions about future programming'' (p. 683, emphasis added).

Hence, static averaged social indicators cannot capture the fluid nature of social reality. For critical theorists, it is possible to chart social progress, but it must be understood in terms of the historical perspective that helps to reveal the underlying contradictions. Moreover, the concept of social progress is a rather philosophical one with an evaluative component attached to it. For example, while we enjoy many benefits of industrialization and urbanization, such as systematic provision of public utilities and affluence of material life, we also witness many problems, such as environmental pollution. Similarly technological advancement has brought us the Internet and smart phones. These technologies have freed many from the traditional working hours, but they have also often brought along increased stress and decreased face-to-face interaction between people. Thus, many skeptics would argue that the costs we have to pay for all these social progresses are much greater than the benefits.

While it is reasonable to gradually refine the indicators and find out whether it would be possible to use same indicators, the existing variations may also simply suggest that different value judgments are attached to different indicators.

First, aggregation would lead to a loss of important information because a composite index can contain only the information that the individual indicators are providing. ''It only presents that information in a form that is more convenient, more clearly understandable, and more amenable to some forms of analysis. But in the process, much useful information may be lost. This loss should be weighed against the gain from avoidance of the trouble of handling a large set of data'' (p. 1199). Chakraborty (2002) further pointed out that ranking in HDI is problematic because ''even for planning purposes, the usefulness of an ordinal ranking of districts is not very clear'' (p. 1200). As the assessment units in HDI are not measured at an individual level, it is impossible to tell how human development attributes are distributed amongst individuals.

Several measures were proposed to improve the quality of the HDI. Klugman et al. (2011) further pointed out several limitations of the HDI. They noted that the HDI was criticized as ''too simplistic, while others who accepted its self-imposed limitations still questioned its choice of indicators and its computational methodology'' (p. 249). There was also a criticism on its lack of conceptual or theoretical basis (p. 259). Regarding the choice of indicators, HDI was criticized as excluding other important aspects of well-being such as equity, social justice, political openness, and happiness. Besides, the choice of indicators was questioned and there were queries on the choice of using equal weights. Although additional measures have been developed Paradigms, Puzzles\u2026 985 Adjusted HDI, the Gender Inequality Index, and the Multidimensional Poverty Index), such measures have not received enough attention from the field. Klugman et al. (2011) further presented three reasons why it is not recommendable for societies to try to maximize the HDI. First, the indicators in HDI are not able to reflect various aspects of human development, and also their weighting is problematic. Second, focus on capability should not be regarded as the overriding concern.

Can we interpret that an increase in divorce rates is an indication of ''negative'' social development? People with religious beliefs may think so. However, radical feminists and those who are committed to liberation of women might interpret it as a good sign for women to liberate themselves. Similarly, can we say that science and technology development brings forth positive social development? With rapid industrialization and urbanization, we witness the global warming effect, which might adversely affect the climate of the earth. In fact, the progress of humans also means worse development or even extinction for non-human species. These examples clearly highlight one important issue surrounding the interpretation of findings of social indicators researchthat value base affects how the findings are interpreted. In future, it would be helpful to further re-think the value choices and priorities in social indicators research.",

First, for cross-sectional studies utilizing social indicators, it is difficult to locate the causal relationships between changes in policies and social indicators outcomes. Because data are collected at a single time point, it would be impossible to ascertain the cause-effect relationship. Second, for longitudinal studies using macro social indicators, explanations may become post hoc in nature, if no a priori models are proposed. Third, as sample size based on social indicators at the national level is small (such as income per capita in different countries and places), multivariate statistical analyses may not necessarily meet the assumptions of multivariate statistics. Fourth, for subjective quality of life studies, it would be easier to propose models because data are usually collected at the individual level. Nevertheless, we also need good theoretical models on the determinants of subjective well-being, which are not commonly seen in the field. In short, we need more effort to formulate models that can account for changes in social indicators across time and place.",

Thus, the problem of whether it is possible to use these findings to make policy and services initiatives arises. There are two observations regarding the potential use of social indicators research. First, application of findings to social intervention appears to be not sufficient. Brown and Corbett (1997) pointed out that social indicators have five basic policy uses where the ''hierarchical typology of uses which incur progressively exacting demands: description, monitoring, setting goals, outcomes-based accountability and evaluation'' (p. iii). According to Noll (2004) , ''while social indicators and social reports have successfully been used as descriptive monitoring tools, their application and use for purposes like setting goals and priorities, or the choice and evaluation of political programs still seems to be problematic and questionable'' (p. 176). Fortunately, they also pointed out that there was a rising trend of using social indicators for policy making particularly in European countries.",

For example, in the area of substance abuse, rise in the substance abuse figures in the last quarter would alert the law enforcement agencies to see whether there are any changes in the supply of or demand for drugs and what additional initiatives should be stepped up. Similarly, rise in suicide rates among the elderly would prompt the Government to re-think about the elderly policies and whether adequate support is given for old people. In the area of health, statistics on infectious diseases would engender quick response from the Government to curb the problem as early as possible. In short, the relevance of social indicators related to social problems may capture greater attention of the Government than social indicators related to the general well-being of the place.

Regarding economic uncertainties, the economic cycle has become short and economic turbulence such as the financial tsunami in 2008 has become more frequent. Besides, vocational uncertainties caused by the use of automation and information technology have reduced the demand for labor and employment opportunities. Concerning political uncertainties, with the lost promise of capitalism and socialism, people in different parts of the world are also losing their confidence in the government. In particular, people lose confidence in those governments where welfare expenses and related debts are huge (e.g., Greece).",

An examination of the current picture shows that social indicators research involves primarily scholars and researchers from the more ''macro'' disciplines, including economics, sociology and political science, although the concept of health-related quality of life is also embraced by psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, occupational therapists, counselors and other allied health professionals on the more ''micro'' level. It is noteworthy that many studies conducted by such ''micro'' researchers have great relevance to social indicators, such as epidemiological studies on mental disorders and surveys on happiness in different patient populations. Hence, how to promote the collaboration between the ''macro'' and ''micro'' researchers would be a challenge. As a start, it would be conceptually stimulating to examine the concept of quality of life and the role of social indicators in different disciplines so that some conceptual integration can be achieved. For example, how we can shape the discourse that epidemiological studies on mental health issues address quality of life issues and that the related findings are regarded as social indicators would be exciting topics for future studies.",
