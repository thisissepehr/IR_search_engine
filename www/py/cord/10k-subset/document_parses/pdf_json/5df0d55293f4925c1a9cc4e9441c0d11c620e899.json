ARDS was induced in 16 healthy pigs (54\u00b14 kg) by repeated saline lung lavage until PaO2 decreased to less than 60 mmHg. After a stabilisation period, the animals were randomly assigned to two groups: CMV: FiO2 = 1.0, VT = 6 ml/kg, and HFOV/av-ECLA: FiO2 = 1.0, frequency = 12-15 Hz. After lung recruitment, the PEEP in the CMV group and the mean airway pressure (mPaw) in the HFOV/av-ECLA group was set 3 cmH2O above the lower inflection point (LIP) of the P/V-curve. Gas exchange and hemodynamic data were determined hourly. After 24 h, mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1-beta, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 in lung tissue was quantified by real time PCR. Histopathologic analysis from the lungs was performed using a four point semi-quantitative severity based scoring system. (1). H2S also exerts a variety of cytoprotective effects in vitro and in vivo (2) . Therefore, we tested the potential cytoprotective effect of infusing the H2S-donor NaHS during porcine thoracic aortic occlusion-induced ischemia/reperfusion(I/R)-injury. METHODS. After random assignment to either NaHS (n=8); 2mg/kgxh started 2 h before and continued until 8 h after aortic occlusion) or vehicle (n=6) anesthetized, ventilated and instrumented pigs underwent 30 min of aortic occlusion using inflatable balloons placed immediately downstream the A.subclavia and upstream the aortic bifurcation. During aortic occlusion, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was maintained between 80-120 % of the baseline levels using continuous i.v. esmolol, nitroglycerine and ATP. During the reperfusion continuous i.v. noradrenaline (NA) was titrated to maintain MAP>80 % of the baseline level. DNA damage in blood samples was evaluated with single cell gel electrophoresis (tail moment in the comet assay). Data are median (range), within group effects over time were analyzed using a Friedman ANOVA on ranks, intergroup differences with an unpaired rank sum test. RESULTS. Infusing NaHS resulted in significantly lower heart rate and cardiac output, while MAP and stroke volume remained unchanged. NaHS significantly reduced the NA requirements needed to achieve the hemodynamic targets, significantly decreased glucose turnover, and completely blunted the I/R-induced DNA damage (see ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 289, "end": 309, "text": ", 1997. 150: 1773-84", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1316, "end": 1319, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONCLUSION."}, {"text": "Septic shock is associated with increased oxidative stress, which in turn depresses mitochondrial activity.

MPaw and PIP were significantly lower in the HFOV/av-ECLA compared with the CMV group (mPaw: 21.4\u00b12 vs. 30.1\u00b14.4 cmH2O; PIP: 24.4\u00b12 vs. 38.4\u00b15.5). After 24 h LIP was significantly reduced in the HFOV/av-ECLA versus the CMV group (LIP: 25.3\u00b15 vs. 21.6\u00b12.3). Beside a lower mRNA expression of TNF-alpha in the upper lobe of the CMV group (deltaCT: -2.9\u00b10.1 vs. -2.3\u00b10.2), no differences of cytokine mRNA expression could be detected between the groups. Histologic analysis showed significantly less signs of inflammation in the dorsal lung regions of the HFOV/av-ECLA compared with the CMV group after 24 h of ventilation (1.3 (1-1.5) vs. 1.8 (1.4-2). CONCLUSION. HFOV/av-ECLA allows a reduction of the mPaw and PIP compared to CMV with low VTs without negative effects on oxygenation. After 24 h histologic signs of lung inflammation were significantly reduced in the dorsal lung regions of the HFOV/av-ECLA animals. The combination of HFOV and av-ECLA may lead to a further reduction of lung injury. GRANT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. Departmental funding.

A. Hameed*, H. S. Mohamed, M. A. Al-Ansari Intensive Care Unit, Salmaniya Medical Complex, Manama, BahrainINTRODUCTION.Central venous catheters (CVCs) are widely used in critically ill patients throughout the world. They permit hemodynamic monitoring and allow reliable access for the administration of fluids,etc(1). CVC placement in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a common practice. Their use is associated with both mechanical and infectious complications.METHODS.This was a retrospective review of all central venous catheter inserted over 4 year's period from October 2002 to December 2006.we studied the infectious and mechanical complication rates of percutaneously placed femoral and non-femoral central venous catheters in critically ill adult patients in retrospective manner in an adult medical, surgical, neuro-surgical ICU over 4 years period from October 2002 to December 2006, the monthly admission to this ICU is 45-50 and average APACHE II is 22 with mortality 17%. Data were collected as part of day-to-day ICU auditing system including APACHE II, Central lines were defined as subclavian, internal jugular, femoral lines. Mechanical complication was defined as a pneumothorax, hematoma, bleeding, line misplacement, or hemothorax and in fectious complications defined as tip colonization.RESULTS.There were 12 mechanical complications and 128 infectious complications total of 1319 CVCs placed (Table 2). Total 1319 CVCs were inserted using Seldinger technique. Forty-two percent of the 1319 central venous catheters placed during this interval were femoral. Noninfectious complications were recognized 1.5 % of femoral catheters and 0.5 % of nonfemoral catheters, out of 464 internal jugular catheters two hematoma were formed in the neck which did not required any intervention or blood transfusion and developed two pneumothorax during subclavian vein catheter insertion out of total 200 subclavian vein catheter inserted and both patient required chest tube, and 9 patients developed hematomas during femoral venous catheter insertion of total 597 femoral catheter inserted out of this 1 was fatal due to ilio-femoral deep vein thrombosis and 3 patients required blood transfusion and 5 patients required pressure bandage, (Table 2). sta.epi.50%,acinet.10 staph.aur.40% Subclavian 28, (10.1%) sta.epi.40%,kleb.11% pseudo10%,E.coli 9% Femoral 88, (15.1%) sta.epi.34%,st.au 26% kleb.9%,acinet 6% IJV = internal jugular vein,C/s = culture and sensitivity,sta.epi. = Staph. epiderm CONCLUSION.

However, A-wave successfully cardioverted after 2 weeks and in 17/21 (81%) of pts in sinus rhythm after 3 months. On the other hand LV function showed compensatory changes from pre to post-cardioversion status i.e. LVEDD decreased from (5.33 versus 5.19, p0.0001), LVESD decreased from (3.67 versus 3.35, p0.0001), and FS increased from (33 versus 36%, p0.001.CONCLUSION.In the view of echo parameters showing regression of cardiac dimensions following cardioversion, the argument of rate versus rhythm control in AF would favor maintaining sinus rhythm. Additionally, favorable effects lessening the chances of blood stasis and reduced potential for LA thrombosis are expected.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.

E. l. Sherif, H. K. h. Nagy Critical Care Department, Cairo University, Guiza, Egypt INTRODUCTION. Recently cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) using biventricular pacing (BVP) emerged as a promising technique to treat heart failure (HF)patients (pts) refractory to drug therapy. Other arguments support the concept that left ventricular pacing (LVP) alone by reversing intra ventricular dyssynchrony may be sufficient to improve LV function and clinical status to the same extent as BVP. We compare the short term clinical & hemdoynamic variables obtained by LVP and BVP in pts with advanced HF. METHODS. 27 pts (19 males & 8 females) with mean age of 51.19+11.1 yrs with severe HF & ventricular dyssynchrony as evidenced by QRS duration >150 ms & intraventricular mechanical delay (IVMD)>60 ms by Tissue Doppler (TDI) were subjected to implantation of a multisite pacing device. All pts. were then randomized into 2 phases (3 months each) of LV and BV pacing in a crossover design. Only 20 pts completed the two phases of the study & at the end of each phase clinical & echo assessment were repeated & compared to baseline data. RESULTS. Compared to baseline, both LVP & BVP caused similar improvement in EF% from 28.7+4.9% to 37.6+6.4% (P<0.001)& 39.1+8%(P<0.001)for LVP & BVP respectively, in mitral regurge area from 6.7+4.9cm2 to 5.2+4.3 cm2 (P=0.005)& 4.4+4.6 cm2 (P< 0.001) for LVP & BVP respectively. Both modes of pacing resulted in reverse remodeling evidenced by reduction of LVEDD from 74.6+10 mm to 71.6+12.1 mm (P=0.012),& 67.2+18 mm (P=0.04)for LVP and BVP respectively & reduction in LVESD from 63.1+10 mm to 59.1+12.2 mm (P=0.007)&57.2+12.5 mm(P=0.001)for LVP & BVP respectively. Both modes resulted in similar increase in the diastolic filling time from 224+78 ms to 282+87 ms(P=0.002)&296+107 ms(P=0.001)for LVP & BVP respectively. Both modes of pacing induced significant reduction of IVMD assessed by TDI from 114+61 ms to 56+28.8 ms (P<0.001) &47.3+28.6 ms(P<0.001)for LVP & BVP respectively. They resulted in almost the same improvement in clinical data: NYHA class from 3.3+0.5 ms to 2.2+0.7 ms (P<0.001) & 1.9+0.6 ms (P<0.001) for LVP & BVP respectively,6 minute walk test from 277+91 m to 358+106 m (P<0.001)&372+95 m(P<0.001) for LVP&BVP respectively&QOL score from 64+12.1 to 35.8+15.2(P<0.001)&33.1+14.8(P<0.001) for LVP & BVP respectively.CONCLUSION.Our data show that, cardiac resynchronization can be achieved by both biventricular as well as pure LV pacing. The latter one could achieve correspondly similar though insignificantly less improvement in EF% and reduction in LV dimensions and MR area. LV pacing can serve as alternative to the costly more complex and more lengthy procedure of BV pacing in patient with refractory HF.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.

Metabolic markers should be preferred as variables indicative of the end-point to initiate and compare different regimes of volume resuscitation in experimental models of hemorrhagic shock. Such metabolic model was used by the authors in an experimental volume replacement investigation (Anesth Analg 2005;101:1785-91). Surprisingly, most hemorrhagic shock models are based on fixed pressure models rather than on metabolic markers. Treating non-lethal hypotensive animals may lead to questionable conclusions.

The direct, in vivo quantitative measurement of the production of superoxide radical, an important parameter of the oxidative load, is difficult due to its low concentration and a short half life (2) . In this study, the effect of H/S and resuscitation on the oxidative state in 4 vital organs (gut, liver, lungs, kidneys) was estimated for the first time by measurement of the production of superoxide radical in vivo, using a new superoxide assay.METHODS. 16 male Wistar rats were divided in two groups (n=8): sham and H/S group. H/S was induced by withdrawal of blood targeting to a mean arterial blood pressure of 30 -40 mmHg, which was maintained for 60 minutes. At the end of the shock period, rats were resuscitated with re-injection of the removed shed blood volume.

The rate of production of superoxide radical increased more in the gut and the liver (P< 0.001 respectively) and to a lesser extent in the lungs (P < 0.05), while kidneys were not affected as well.CONCLUSION. This study demonstrates an increase in oxidative load in the gut, the liver and the lungs after H/S-resuscitation, which was estimated by two different methods. Moreover, and for the first time in a model of H/S, the new superoxide assay directly and more precisely estimates oxidative stress in vivo, since the formation of superoxide radical seems to play a pivotal role in the cataract of reactions that lead to the oxidation of biological structures. These results suggest that predominantly the gut and the liver, and to a lesser extent the lungs, but not the kidneys are the organs primarily affected by H/S in this model. REFERENCE(S). 1.

Referrals to SLT increased by 125% (20 pre-project versus 45 during the project). Pre project, 25% referrals(5) were inappropriate and 20% (4) transferred before asessment. 100% referrals (45) during the project were appropriate and assessed. 60% of pre-project referrals were seen on the day of referral compared to 96% during the project.

Multiple anaesthetic techniques were used by four anaesthetists. 13% arrived on ITU intubated, but extubation followed within 2 to 6 hours.
