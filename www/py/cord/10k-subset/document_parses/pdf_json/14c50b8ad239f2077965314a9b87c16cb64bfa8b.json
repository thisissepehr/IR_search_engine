Analysis of lavage fluid immediately following exposure demonstrated enhanced lactate dehydrogenase activity and decreased numbers of lavageable macrophages but no alterations in albumin content. Similar analyses at one day postexposure demonstrated 282% and 456% increases in albumin content and enhanced numbers of lavageable neutrophils from a control value of 0.01 + 0.01 to 0.27 + 0.10 and 0.78 -+ 0.11 million cells per lung for 2-hr and 4-hr exposures, respectively. The observed increased levels of albumin were also present at 3 days, at which time the number of lavageable neutrophils was not significantly different than control. At both one and 3 days postexposure, lavageable lymphocytes were significantly increased 10-fold from a control value of 0.03 -+ 0.01 million cells per lung. However, the number of lavageable macrophages was unaltered on day 1, but enhanced on day 3, giving values of 0.67 + 0.05 (control), 2.25 + 0.46 (2 hr), and 2.70 +-1.05 (4 hr) million cells per lung. By 8 days both inflammatory cell numbers and albumin levels had returned to control values. Since these data demonstrated different time courses for each inflammatory cell type, this reversible model of acute lung injury should be useful for establishing possible involvement of these cells in processes of lung injury.",

            "text": "Studies of the early cellular events following acute oxidant exposures of the lung are important for understanding the mechanisms leading to irreversible lung injury. Investigators have employed several different approaches to study the nature of this type of injury. Substrates and enzymes have been instilled into the airways to generate reactive oxygen species and peroxidative products of H202 [ 15, 28] . Treatment of lungs with the tumor promoter phorbo[ myristate acetate has been used to cause edema, the infiltration of inflammatory cells [18] , and the development of irreversible interstitial fibrotic lesions [16] . Cytotoxic agents such as paraquat [2, 9] , bleomycin Ill, 32], ozone [1, 6, 8, 12, 14, 22, 31] , and oxygen [17] also lead to similar changes in the lung. Although these model systems have used high levels of the injurious agent in order to establish initial biochemical interactions and models of fibrogenesis, the early events have not been so well defined. The purpose of the present investigation was therefore to develop a model of acute lung injury based on exposure of rats to ozone that more clearly demonstrate some of the early events and cell types involved.",

Although inflammatory cell infiltration has been examined in detail during the first 24 hr after 3-hr exposure of rabbits to 5 ppm ozone [6] , few studies have determined the subsequent time course of events. The present study using rats acutely exposed to ozone therefore examined lung inflammatory cell accumulation immediately following exposure and 1, 3, and 8 days postexposure in order to establish whether resolution of the initial ozone-induced lesions could be demonstrated. Changes in lung inflammatory cell content were correlated with early indicators of tissue injury and with alterations of lung morphology. Rats were exposed for either 2 or 4 hr to 1.8 ppm ozone in order to investigate how the length of exposure might influence the degree of lung damage. The resulting lung inflammatory process was examined by light and electron microscopy and by analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for macrophages, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils). Cellular damage was indicated by changes in lavage fluid lactate dehydrogenase activity [27] . Alterations in vascular permeability were similarly assessed by measurements of lavage fluid albumin [1, 10] .",

The concentration of 1.8 ppm ozone was high enough to cause sufficient damage to the lung so that measurable changes in vascular permeability and inflammatory cell infiltration could be detected. The durations of ozone exposure were also short enough to demonstrate that the oxidant injury was reversible. This model provides a system in which the time courses of the different inflammatory cell infiltration and disappearance from the lung can be clearly defined. Unlike other models of acute lung damage used to determine the role of inflammatory cells in adult respiratory distress syndrome [15, 17, 18, 25, 28] and in the development of interstitial fibrosis [2, 9, 11, 12, 16, 32] , the present system was found to be reversible by 8 days postexposure. This reversibility of injury was indicated by a return to the control number of lavageable inflamma-tory cells and a return to a normal lung structure with no significant accumulation of collagen. This study therefore provides the basis for a sensitive method of examining the mechanisms by which an oxidant-injured lung might get better or worse. Such experiments are not so easily conducted in models that use either large changes in vascular permeability or the development of interstitial fibrosis as experimental end-points. Since this study also demonstrates a way to obtain either a neutrophil or a macrophage-rich lung, it should be possible to separately investigate interactions between these inflammatory cells and alveolar epithelium and components of the extracellular matrix that might occur during the early stages of lung oxidant injury.",

An increased number of lymphocytes was also observed on the first day postexposure. These cells were still present on day 3 but had left the lung by day 8. The changes in the total numbers of lavageable inflammatory cells and the observed increases in vascular permeability measured by albumin content of lavage fluids could be correlated with pathological observations of hypercellularity and edema formation in alveoli at the different times following ozone exposure. Electron microscopy demonstrated the location and ultrastructural alterations of the infiltrating inflammatory cells and the presence of proliferating alveolar type II cells previously associated with the repair of ozone-damaged alveolar epithelium [8] .",

Since no significant increases in lavageable inflammatory cells or in vascular permeability were demonstrated at this time point, the source of enzyme activity was most likely from lung cells damaged by the interaction of ozone with cell membrane lipids [20, 24] and enzyme proteins [19] . Since the numbers of macrophages recovered by lavage were found to be significantly decreased immediately following both 2-and 4-hr ozone exposures, the increased lavage fluid lactate dehydrogenase might also have resulted from ozone-induced damage of the resident macrophage population. The observed decrease in recoverable macrophages and the subsequent increase in lavageable neutrophils 1 day postexposure was consistent with a previous study that reported decreased macrophages and increased heterophils immediately following exposure of rabbit lungs to 5 ppm ozone for 3 hr [6] . The present investigation with rats demonstrated that although neutrophils could readily be identified within the interstitium of lung terminal airways immediately following the ozone exposure, they could not be recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage at this time point.",

Although lavage fluid recovery of radiolabeled albumin following intravenous injection has previously been shown to provide a suitable index of permeability changes [I, 10] , increases in lavage fluid protein have been found to be a more sensitive indicator of the consequences of rat ozone exposure [10] . In the present study, changes in vascular permeability were indicated 1 day following ozone exposure by enhancements oflavage fluid albumin. These data could be correlated with increases in the numbers of lavageable neutrophils and with the duration of the ozone exposures. Since neutrophils can potentially cause oxidative damage by their ability to generate reactive species of oxygen and to release proteolytic enzymes, they might have amplified the original ozone-induced damage during infiltration from the vasculature into the lavageable spaces of the lung [15, 25, 28, 29] .",

It is therefore possible that the increased number of macrophages, which have been shown to generate reactive oxygen species and to release proteinases [13, 23] , might also have been responsible for the observed persistance of lung damage. However, the number of macrophages lavaged from lungs 3 days after both 2-and 4-hr ozone exposures were similar and so did not correlate with the degree of damage indicated by lavage fluid albumin concentrations that were proportional to the length of ozone exposures ( Table 3 , Fig. 4C ). On the other hand, focal areas of consolidation could have prevented efficient lavage of the inflammatory cells at this time point and so result in an underestimation of macrophage content. It should be noted that the observed differences in damage observed between 2-hr and 4-hr ozone-exposed lungs at 3 days postexposure might also be explained by residual proteinases of degenerating neutrophils.",
