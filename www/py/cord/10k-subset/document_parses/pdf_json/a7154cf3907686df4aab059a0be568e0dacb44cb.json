I73T is the most common mutation, accounting for 30 % of all cases reported. Case presentation: We describe three patients carrying the same I73T SPC mutation with very different phenotypes, clinical course (ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to death for respiratory failure) and outcome. Conclusions: The disease mechanisms associated with SP-C mutations suggest that the combination of individual genetic background and environmental factors contribute largely to the wide variability of clinical expression. Infants, children and adults with ILD of unknown etiology should be investigated for SP-C genetic abnormalities.",

            "text": "The Surfactant Protein C gene (SFTPC, ENGS00000168484) encodes a 197 aminoacid apoprotein, subsequently cleaved into the mature Surfactant Protein C (SP-C), which is incorporated together with specific phospholipids and proteins into lamellar bodies in alveolar type 2 cells, then released via regulated exocytosis in the gas-liquid interface of the alveolus, playing a critical role in the modulation of lung mechanics. Lung diseases due to SFTPC mutations are inherited either as autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance or as sporadic disease caused by a de novo single mutation, and were first described in 2001 [1] . These diseases have a broad spectrum of clinical presentations and manifestations, ranging from lethal neonatal respiratory distress syndrome to adult chronic interstitial lung disease (ILD). The cellular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of SFTPC mutation-associated ILD are not completely understood. Very few mutations affecting the mature peptide have been reported in human, most mutations being located in the Cterminus residue of the apoprotein. Mutations located in the BRICHOS domain flanking the C-terminus have been implicated in protein misfolding response and apoptosis. In fact, the proSP-C BRICHOS domain plays an essential chaperone role in preventing the highly hydrophobic mature SP-C peptide to aggregate in the endoplasmic reticulum and cause cell death [2, 3] . Conversely, non-BRICHOS mutations in the C-terminus linker domain (I73T, E66K) interfere with autophagic vacuole formation and maturation, causing a distinct ultrastructural phenotype with large intracytoplasmic vacuoles containing unstructured phospholipids [4, 5] . The g.1286 T > C mutation, leading to a substitution of threonine to isoleucine at codon 73 (I73T), is now recognized as the most common SP-C mutation, accounting for about 30 % of all cases reported [6] [7] [8] [9] . We describe three patients with different clinical presentation, whose common denominator is the I73T mutation.",

She is the second daughter of non-consanguineous healthy parents. Her sister died in the first year with respiratory insufficiency of unidentified etiology. The child was in good general condition. Chest auscultation was unremarkable. Humoral and cellular immunity testing, sweat tests and genetic analysis for cystic fibrosis,, cardiac evaluation, abdominal ultrasound all resulted normal. CT scan confirmed widespread patchy ground glass opacities and subpleural micronodules, with interstitial thickening. Bronchoscopy showed normal airways; bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) showed normal cytology and lipid index, negative bacterial culture, and negative respiratory viral immunofluorescence and PCR tests. SFTPC gene sequencing detected the I73T mutation. Parents, who were both asymptomatic, were not mutation carriers. The genetic findings are difficult to interpret, as parental testing suggests a de novo mutation, but would imply that the sibling died of an unrelated cause. The child was started on hydroxychloroquine 5 mg/kg/day per oral (HCQ). Her cough and dyspnea improved after one week and she was discharged home on room air. Three months after she was still completely asymptomatic, and a repeat chest CT was improved, showing disappearance of the ground glass abnormalities but persistence of micronodules. After six months we observed a complete recovery of the CT findings. At 3 years of age the child is still on treatment, with no respiratory symptoms.",

Bronchoscopy was normal; lung CT showed groundglass attenuations suggestive of ILD. Immunological screening showed a mild IgA and IgG deficiency. Sweat test and cystic fibrosis genetic test were normal. The infant was discharged home after one month, on oxygen and oral methylprednisolone. He was referred to our center at 12 months,of age.

Infection workup was negative. Bronchoscopy showed no airway anomalies but lipid-laden alveolar macrophages were seen on BAL fluid examination, indicating chronic tracheal aspirations.

Despite an initial improvement, the repeat chest CT after 10 pulses showed progression of ILD. At that stage, HCQ was added to methylprednisolone. After 6 months we observed an improvement in SaO2/CO2 nocturnal monitoring, allowing weaning then discontinuation of oxygen therapy and switching to hydrocortisone as a lower potency steroid regimen. At the age of 36 months, since chest CT was stable compared to the previous one, HCQ was replaced by azithromycin given its better safety profile.

In a recently published report, three infants with SP-C deficiency due to an I73T mutation and unusually early respiratory symptoms carried an additional mutation in the ATP binding cassette protein A3 gene (ABCA3), a phospholipid carrier essential for lamellar body formation and surfactant intracellular assembly. ABCA3 deficiency, which typically leads to lethal neonatal-onset respiratory distress syndrome, is transmitted in autosomal recessive mode and heterozygous carriers are unaffected [13] . However, this report suggests that monoallelic mutations in different genes, which would be asymptomatic if isolated, may inflict multiple hits may have cumulative effects on the surfactant synthesis pathway and modify the disease course. We screened the 3 patients in this report for mutations in the SFTPB, ABCA3 and NKX2.1 genes, all associated with lung disease in human, and none were found.",

Genetically modified animal overexpressing a common human mutant pro-SP-C (\u0394exon4, a BRICHOS domain mutation) show an increased rate of alveolar cell death [14] . SP-C deficient mice exposed to RSV have a stronger inflammatory response and more severe interstitial lung disease than controls, and restoration of SP-C expression by transgene therapy has a rescue effect in these animals, which could pave the way to future gene therapy in human [15, 16] . SP-C mutations result in loss of TLR3 modulation, IL-8 induction and paracrine modulation of the CCR2 and CXCR1 chemokine receptors on leukocytes leading to uncontrolled inflammation and fibroblast proliferation. In a recent clinical study by our group, 4 out of 7 cases were revealed by an unusually severe/protracted bronchiolitis episode, and similar observation was reported by others [5, 7] . In this report, cases #2 and 3 confirm this concept.",
