In real networks, the dependency relations between networks are neither identical nor completely random. Thus in this paper, we study the influence of randomness for dependency maps on the robustness of interdependent lattice networks. We introduce approximate entropy(ApEn) as the measure of randomness of the dependency maps. We find that there is critical ApEn c below which the percolation is continuous, but for larger ApEn, it is a first-order transition. With the increment of ApEn, the p c increases until ApEn reaching ApEn 0 c and then remains almost constant. The time scale of the system shows rich properties as ApEn increases. Our results uncover that randomness is one of the important factors that lead to cascading failures of spatially interdependent networks. V C 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.",

Robustness is one of the most important properties for interdependent networks especially spatially interdependent networks, since most of the infrastructure networks are spatially networks. In real interdependent networks, the dependency relationship is not usually random. Thus, we analyze how the randomness of dependency map affects the robustness of interdependent lattices which are used to model the spatially interdependent networks. We found that the randomness of dependency map between networks is quite critical for the robustness of interdependent lattices.",

            "text": "Robustness is one of the most important properties of complex networks and has been widely explored on single networks in the last decade. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] However, complex systems are rarely isolated. The more casual situation is that networks usually interact with other networks such as transportation networks and financial systems. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] In the case of interdependent networks, conclusions are often far different from single networks. In particular, a removal of a very small fraction of nodes can lead to catastrophic failures on the whole network. 14 A theoretical framework based on percolation theory has been established to analyze the resilience of interdependent systems, 9, 15 and much details have been explored. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] The fraction of interdependent nodes is a key factor that will influence the phase transition of the networks. 21, 22 Also, the overlap of links can significantly change the properties of the percolation, and there is a critical point above which the emergence of the mutually connected component is continuous. 20 The presence of degree correlations in multiplex networks can modify drastically the percolation threshold. 18, 19 Most previous models have focused on interdependent random and scale-free networks in which space restrictions are not considered. However, many real-world systems such as power grid networks and computer networks are embedded in two-dimensional space. 23, 24 In interdependent random and scale-free networks, the overlap of links and degree correlations will change the properties of phase transition. Nevertheless, for spatially embedded interdependent networks which are modeled as square lattices, the overlap of links or the degree correlations of nodes lose significance, since their network topologies are identical. The spatially interdependent networks are extremely vulnerable. Any fraction of interdependent nodes will lead to first-order transition. 23 From an identical dependency map to totally random dependency map, the randomness of the dependency map may be one of the most important factors leading to the emergence of discontinuous percolation. In most real interdependent systems, dependencies are neither totally random nor identical. Researches on the resilience of intermediate systems that lie somewhere between these two extremes are of high practical significance and need further exploration.",

We use approximate entropy(ApEn) as the measure of randomness. One of the big challenges here is how to introduce controlled degree of randomness into the system. Therefore, we propose an intermediate model which dependency map between identical map and totally random map. Inspired by the constructing procedure of the Watt-Strogatz small-world model, 25 starting from an identical dependency map, we rewire each dependency link at random with probability q. By increasing q from 0 to 1, the ApEn increases monotonically. Therefore, the traverse of randomness can be generally represented by q. We reveal that there is a critical value q c , below which the percolation transition becomes continuous, whereas for any q > q c , the collapse is discontinuous. Changing the topologies on a single layer, we discover that q c is different for interdependent scale-free networks, Watts-Strogatz networks, and Erd} os-R enyi networks. There is another critical value q 0 c for the function p c VS q, which is different from q c . The percolation threshold p c increases with q when q < q 0 c and remains approximately constant when q > q 0 c . Additionally, we present an analytical method for time scale of cascade failures based on critical p and find that the four topologies display rich transient properties when q changes from 0 to 1. Finally, we analyze the influence of limited dependency length on spatial networks. With the same dependency length, we show that a linearly dependent system is always continuous, but not continuous for some locally randomly dependent system. Our results show that the randomness of dependency may be one of important factors for extreme vulnerability of spatially interdependent systems.",

Therefore, take interdependent square lattices as example, we get simulation data of NOI p c \u00f0q\u00de from systems whose size ranges from N \u00bc 10 2 to N \u00bc 10 6 . It is also true that NOI p c \u00f0q\u00de increases quickly with q when q < q 0 c and then declines very gently when q is greater than q 0 c for interdependent lattice networks. However, the critical value q 0 c converges gradually from a relatively great value to around 0.38 with the increment of system size. The relationship between critical value q 0 c and system size is shown in Table I . Finally, we check locally interdependent networks in which the distance between two interdependent nodes is limited (d r, i.e., jx 1 \u00c0 x 2 j r and y 1 \u00c0 y 2 j r in Reference 27) . For simplicity, we consider one more special condition. Here, we split the whole network into small blocks of size r * r, and dependency links are randomized within each block. We find that there is critical distance r c % 25 under which the percolation is continuous but discontinuous above r c (Fig. 9) . The r c is greater than r 0 c in Ref. 27 because the randomness(approximate entropy) here is lower than that in Ref. 27 with the same distance. The The brown, cyan, red, and blue circles stand for NOI at p c of interdependent square lattices, scale-free networks, Watt-Strogatz networks, and Erd\u20ac os-R enyi networks, respectively. For interdependent random networks and small-world networks, NOI increases monotonously with q. However, for interdependent lattice networks and scale-free networks, there is one critical q 0 c . When q < q 0 c , the NOI increases approximately linearly, and when q ! q 0 c , the NOI starts to decreases. For scale-free networks, k \u00bc 2.7. And in Watts-Strogatz networks, the rewiring probability equals 0.5. The average degree of each network in all the four systems, i.e., hki \u00bc 4. The numerical results are obtained by averaging 100 realizations of networks consisting of N \u00bc 10 4 nodes. corresponding approximate entropy ApEn % 0.923 of r c is approximately equal to ApEn c . Compared with locally random dependency, the linear dependency map is more robust. In linear dependency map in this paper, each node (i, j) in network of size L \u00c2 L is mapped to node \u00f0i \u00fe c mod L; j \u00fe b mod L\u00de, where c and d are integers. In fact, it is also an isometric mapping. In linear dependency map, the distance of dependency link r \u00bc max(c, d). For the linear dependency map, the percolation is always continuous (Fig. 9 ). Although the dependency distance changes strongly, the approximate entropies of those dependency maps are almost equal to 0. So, their percolation properties are nearly the same as percolation on a single lattice. It is thus clear that the randomness may be a more important factor leading to cascade failures than dependency distance. Furthermore, it is possible that the randomness of dependency is related to other metrics of interdependent networks such as dimension. The dimension of networks is a function of the distribution of link lengths. 28 For spatially embedded networks, the dimension is one of the most fundamental quantities to characterize its structure and very likely will influence its percolation property. 28 However, to the best of our knowledge, how interdependency relationships between networks change the dimension of the system has not been figured out so far. In Reference 27, the authors discovered that the dependency length plays a critical role in the percolation transition. However, we find that under linear dependency map, the change of dependency length influences the percolation property little. From the discrepancy of those two situations, it can be inferred that local property of dependency relationship makes a notable difference. And, the local property of dependency will directly influence the local topological inter-similarity between networks. Randomness happens to reflect the local property of dependency (we can see this from the computation steps of approximate entropy in Section Methods). In spatially interdependent embedded networks, the local characteristics of dependency can be more intuitively characterized as the relative length of dependency links. Under linear dependency map, the relative length of dependency links and the approximate entropy of dependency map are nearly 0. No matter how large r is, they change little and remain nearly 0, so the percolation changes little. On the other hand, the smaller the relative length is, the less dimension is changed from that of single network. There should exist some relations between dimension and the randomness of the dependency map.",

The transition from regular to random dependency is one of the keys to extreme vulnerability of spatially interdependent systems. From the proposed intermediate cascade failure model (from regular to random dependency), we find there is a transform from continuous percolation to discontinuous percolation with the randomness variation of the dependency map between two interdependent networks. We emphasize the generic character of our model because the dependency map could influence not only the resilience but also synchronization, disease spreading, and other dynamic processes in interdependent networks. With suitable modification, our model could be applied to understand the dynamical process in most real interdependent systems since the dependency maps between networks are more various and complicated instead of totally random dependency or regular dependency.",

In different dynamic processes, the characteristic time scales of systems vary greatly. For instance, biological systems, social systems, and financial market dynamics have time scale much longer than that of cascade failures of power grid. Our analytic method based on critical p is simple and effective for characterizing the time scale of different systems. Generally, the system which has a shorter time scale demands higher requirements for our responding speed to catastrophe and brings much bigger challenges for us to take mitigation actions than those with longer time scale. Therefore, our method may provide a clue for research on revealing the transient mechanism and mitigation of cascade failures in interdependent networks.",

First, we analyze the situation with totally random dependency maps. After the initial attack, only a fraction p 1 \u00bc p 1 (p) of nodes remains functional.

The green circles, red squares, and blue triangles stand for q \u00bc 0.1, q \u00bc 0.2, and q \u00bc 1.0, respectively. The numerical results are obtained by averaging 100 realizations of networks. For q \u00bc 0.1, the phase transition of the system is second-order since the giant component emerges in multiple size steps (Dp). For q \u00bc 0.2 and q \u00bc 1.0, however, the transition is first-order as the giant component collapses even by removing a very small fraction of nodes.FIG. 5. Percolation threshold p c VS q.

The function of number of iterations (NOI) VS p (Dp \u00bc 10 \u00c02 ) in interdependent lattice networks (q \u00bc 1). The numerical results are obtained by averaging 100 realizations of networks consisting of N \u00bc 10 4 nodes. The vertical red line is the critical line. On the left side of it, the system collapses down (blue circle), while a giant component remains functional on the right side (green circle). There is a sharp divergence of the NOI when p approaches p c . FIG. 8. The change of NOI at p c with q.",
