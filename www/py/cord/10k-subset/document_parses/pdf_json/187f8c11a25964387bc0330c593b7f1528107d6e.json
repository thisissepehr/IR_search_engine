Background Chronic suppurative otitis media is a chronic inflammation of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, with more than 2 weeks of otorrhea. Various studies have shown that both gram-positive and gramnegative bacteria, which differ according to the sites, are responsible for infection of middle ear. The knowledge of the prevailing flora and their susceptibility to antibiotics is an important step for an appropriate treatment Materials and Methods The current study was cross sectional survey involving enrolled 110 patients who consulted ENT Department at KUTH with active chronic suppurative otitis media or its complication, from November 2014 up to January 2015.

Nearly all (99%) of these neonatal deaths occur in low income countries. The aim of this study was to describe the bacterial etiology and the antimicrobial resistance patterns of the isolated bacteria among newborns clinically suspected of having sepsis Materials and Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Mulago national referral hospital in Kampala, Uganda. Venous blood for culture was collected from 305 newborns with clinical signs of sepsis. Validated questionnaires on mobile devices were used to obtain sociodemographic characteristics. An automated blood culture system was used (BD BactecTM) plus other conventional culture methods. Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method was used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing according to clinical laboratory standard institute. mecA PCR was conducted for confirmation of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Results The mean birth weight of the neonates was 3.1 kg (SD 0.6), 32% of them were \u22647 days old and 55% were males. The proportion of patients with a bacterial pathogen known to cause sepsis was 14% (95% CI; 10%-19%). This included 27 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, Escherichia coli (6), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Neisseria spp (1), Enterobacter spp (1) and Citrobacter freundii (1). All the 5 K.pneumoniae isolates, 5/6 E.coli isolates and 26/27 S.aureus isolates were resistant to ampicillin. Resistance to the most commonly used aminoglycoside varied between species in that 6 (22%) of the S. aureus, one of the E. coli and two of the K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to gentamicin. Among the twenty seven S.aureus isolated, 20(74%) were MRSA, 19 (70%) were resistant to erythromycin, 10 (37%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 7 (26%) were resistant to trimethroprim-sulphamethoxazole and 8(30%) displayed erythromycin inducible clindamycin resistance (D-test positive).

Background Sepsis is a global public health problem representing a leading cause of morbidity and mortality and increased costs in many countries [1] . According to a previous study, implementation of a national sepsis program resulted in improved adherence to sepsis bundles in severe sepsis and septic shock patients and was associated with reduced adjusted in-hospital mortality [2] . Another recent study reported that implementation of multidisciplinary emergency department (ED) sepsis bundle was associated with improved time to achieve key therapeutic interventions and a reduction in 30-day mortality [3] . In other study, the use of a sepsis triage screening tool significantly decreased the time to antibiotics in patients presenting to the ED [4] . Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) 2016 recommends that hospitals have a performance improvement program for sepsis [5] . We have newly developed Intelligent Sepsis Management System (i-SMS) which help clinicians to screen, diagnose, and manage septic patients. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of i-SMS on compliance with the SSC bundles and survival outcome in patients with sepsis and septic shock diagnosed in ED.

Conclusions Implementation of i-SMS significantly improved compliance with SSC recommendations among patients with sepsis and septic shock in accordance with Sepsis-3 definitions, but did not improve short-term survival outcome. Background Sepsis is a global public health problem. Despite the advances in modern medicine, more than 5.3 million people die from sepsis annually, with an estimated overall mortality of about 30% [1] [2] [3] . Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can improve survival outcome in patients with sepsis [4] . Despite pre-existing diagnostic criteria for sepsis, early diagnosis is usually challenging due to unknown source of infection and the vague definitions of sepsis syndrome [5] . Creactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) have been widely used to facilitate the diagnosis of sepsis, but the clinical values of these are limited [6, 7] . A recent study reported that IL-6 level is a diagnostic marker of infection and a prognostic marker, in patients with organ dysfunction [8] . Another study showed that PTX-3 discriminates sepsis and septic shock patients from healthy controls in a medical intensive care unit (ICU) setting [9] . However, evidence concerning the clinical value of IL-6 and PTX-3 has been controversial in several studies.

The BALT hyperplasia also was more intense as compared to 6h findings. These results showed a continuing inflammatory process and suggested that a state of an acute inflammatory reaction coexists with apparent clinical normality. In 90 days after sepsis induction, although all animals remained clinically asymptomatic, significant pulmonary lesions were seen, with intense capillaries congestion, broad atelectasis, severe thickening of the alveolar wall, infiltrate of mono and polynuclear cells in most of alveoli, multiple areas with hemorrhage, peri-bronchial leukocyte infiltrates, atherosclerosis, and intense BALT hyperplasia associated to obstruction of bronchioles and multiple areas of atelectasis. These findings demonstrated that healthy-looking animals were concealing a functionally impaired lung structure combined to an intense inflammatory reaction state in course, denoting an impaired lung physiological condition to face with new deleterious stimuli in sepsis survivors.

Conclusions Developing a unified approach and increasing communication between providers generated benefits for patient, practitioners and local health economy.

Background Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. If unimpeded, sepsis can progress to septic shock, characterized by refractory hypotension and unresponsive vasculature (i.e. vasoplegia) resulting in tissue hypoperfusion and eventually organ failure [1] . The overall mortality rate of septic shock is more than 50%. The vascular dysfunction and refractory hypotension in septic shock are caused, at least in part, by excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and dysregulated nitric oxide (NO) production (via inducible NO synthase upregulation and increased scavenging by excess ROS) [2, 3, 4] . Moreover, excess ROS oxidizes and hence damages soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), the downstream mediator of NO, resulting in the impaired organ blood flow [5, 6] . We believe the loss of sGC-mediated vasodilation is a critical determinant of reduced organ blood flow in sepsis. The objective of this study is to assess the state of vascular dysfunction and altered blood flow patterns as sepsis progresses to septic shock. We also sought to assess the effi-cacy of (i) the sGC activator cinaciguat or (ii) the superoxide dismutase mimetic tempol in improving hemodynamics and survival in a murine model of sepsis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1266, "end": 1269, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1608, "end": 1611, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1612, "end": 1614, "text": "3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1615, "end": 1617, "text": "4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1775, "end": 1778, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1779, "end": 1781, "text": "6]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 62, "end": 70, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "The experimental protocols described herein have been approved by the University of Alberta Animal Care and Use Committee in conformance with the FASEB Statement of Principles for the use of Animals in Research and Education.

In both cases, besides antibiotic therapy, crystalloids solutions and vasopressor support to maintain PAM above 65mmHg were necessary. In patient A, the vasopressor requirements were higher at the admission and progressively decreased until its suspension at second day, and the IR-A expression at the beginning was 15,6x and it was progressive decreasing until 1,9x. Patient B required less vasopressor than patient A, but they were necessary for more days.

Conclusions This is the first report of a plausible association between IR-A expression and vasoactive drugs requirements in SS, probably secondary to endothelial dysfunction. The alternative splicing of exon 11 human IR gene generates two isoforms [5] and, while alterations on IR-B expression are associated to metabolic processes, IR-A upregulated expression has been related to alterations on vascular function [6] .
