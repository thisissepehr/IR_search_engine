The performed transbronchial biopsy, BAL cultures, and PCR revealed influenza A, parainfluenza 4 virus, and an invasive aspergillus (IA) fumigatus infection (Fig. 1b) . Serum aspergillus galactomannan antigen levels were 1.5 ng/mL. CTs of the thorax showed progressive bilateral cavities over the following days (Fig. 1c, d) . Despite full intensive care, including antiviral and antifungal treatment, the patient died of the severe ARDS.",
