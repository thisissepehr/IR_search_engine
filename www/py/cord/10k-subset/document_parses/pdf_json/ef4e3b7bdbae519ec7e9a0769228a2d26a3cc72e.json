Biopsy specimens and tissue cultures were taken from the pustular lesions. Pathologic evaluation of skin biopsy showed massive neutrophilic infiltrate in the entire dermis (Fig. 1) . Tissue culture results were negative for bacterial or fungal infection. Based on the clinical course, a diagnosis of sweet syndrome was made. As the patient's fever had not subsided in spite of the administration of antibiotics and steroid, we presumed that the sweet syndrome was caused by the azathioprine and was not due to inflammatory bowel disease. The azathioprine therapy was discontinued. Within 48 hours, the patient's fever abated and her skin lesions improved. Following this improvement, the VOLUME 48 __ DECEMBER 17, 2011 CASE REPORTS prednisolone dose was reduced to 0.4 mg/kg per day without a recurrence of her symptoms.",

A case of acute generalized exantematous pustules induced by azathioprine like our case also has been reported [9] .

Clinical and histopathologic findings supported the drug-induced sweet syndrome and cessation of the drug caused a rapid regression in symptoms.

Bronchoalveolar lavage could be performed in only one patient (patient 3) who grew Pseudomonas species in the lavage fluid. All children were neutropenic at the onset of symptoms.

Patients with hematological malignancies are expected to have more morbidity and mortality due to the already compromised immunity, associated neutropenia, and coexistent bacterial and fungal infections. Usually a diagnosis of bacterial infection is considered in the setting of neutropenic fever and thereafter a fungal infection is considered if fever persists. It is for this reason that the diagnosis of H1N1 infection was not considered initially in our patients. The diagnosis was further delayed due to the radiological features being suggestive of invasive fungal infection in two patients. It is possible that H1N1 could have been a coexistent infection with other usual infections There is paucity of data on the course and outcome of this novel infection in patients with haematological malignancies [4] [5] [6] [7] . Sidi, et al. [7] found in their series of 45 patients of different malignancies that H1N1 was more common in hematological malignancies than solid tumors; however, it was not associated with severe illness or death in any of their patients.

Further, empiric treatment with oseltamivir should be initiated early in these patients as this infection appears to have an adverse outcome either due to its own course or by having an additive effect on an underlying coexistent pulmonary infection.

Magnetic resonance imaging of spine revealed exophytic intramedullary mass lesion from T12 to L1. Peroperatively, the diagnosis was confirmed as abscess.

            "text": "S. stercoralis usually persists and replicates in a host for a decade without symptoms. However when the host becomes immunocompromised, it can lead to fatal conditions like hyper-infection syndrome and disseminated strongyloidiasis. The disease should be suspected in an immunocompromised host who comes from an area endemic for Strongyloides stercoralis. In endemic areas, a prevalence of as high as 40% is observed in general population. However, disseminated strongyloidasis is very rare in immunocompetent host. Clinical manifestations of disseminated strongyloidosis are nonspecific. The onset is usually sudden with generalized abdominal pain, distension and fever, associated with indigestion, vomiting, diarrhea, steatorrhoea, protein losing enteropathy and weight loss. There is remarkable absence of eosinophilia. Steroids may not only affect the host's cellular immunity, but also mimic an endogenous parasitic-derived regulatory hormone. Strongyloides were noticed to produce more eggs in the presence of exogenous steroids. Due to immuno-suppressant therapy, there is a larger proportion of the rhabditiform larvae which mature into the filariform larvae within the host. This leads to a greater larval load and dissemination. It involves widespread dissemination of larvae to extra intestinal organs (CNS, heart, urinary tract, endocrine organs) which are not ordinarily part of parasitic lifecycle. The enteric organisms either carried by the larvae or through intestinal ulcers, cause bacteremia.",

Disseminated strongyloidiasis is defined as larvae migrating to end organs not usually involved in the normal cycle of the parasite, such as brain and skin. The definitive diagnostic test is identification of S. stercoralis larvae in stool examination. Single stool examination has low sensitivity (30%). Hence multiple examinations are recommended. In children with hyper-infection syndrome, larvae may be found in samples from sites of potential larva migration like duodenal aspirate, sputum, BAL fluid, lung biopsy and rarely in small intestine biopsy specimens. Stool microscopy done twice, in this child, during the illness did not reveal the larvae. This child developed left ventricular failure on the last day and there was significant pericardial effusion. The reason for heart failure was presumed to be due to disseminated strongyloidiasis. Myocardial involvement in disseminated strongyloidiasis has been described in literature [7] .

On examination, her weight was 9.5 kg (z score = -2), height was 78 cm (z score = -3), she had matted cervical lymphnodes and discharging sinus over left foot. There was decreased air entry in left infra-axillary and infrascapular region with bronchial breathing and hepatosplenomegaly. Other systems were normal. Mantoux test was positive. Sputum for acid fast bacillus (AFB) was negative on smear. Her X-ray of the feet showed osteomyelitis of left fibula, left talus, left 5th metatarsal and right 5th metatarsal. X-ray spine was normal. CSF examination was normal. Pus from left foot showed AFB on smear.

However, in December 2007, she had still not gained weight, though her fever had subsided and she was able to stand without support and walk with support. Her MRI spine showed destruction of T 4 vertebral body with gibbus formation at T 4 -T 5 level and collapse and destruction of L 5 vertebral body and large prevertebral, paravertebral and anterior epidural abscess. Amikacin was stopped by the patient in Dec 2007 due to pain on injecting. The psoas abscess was drained and sent for culture and sensitivity in Jan 2008. Her culture still grew M.tuberculosis which was resistant to HRZESO. The child was subsequently started on injection kanamycin, linezolid, prothionamide, clofazimine and cycloserine to which she responded and had a weight gain of 2 kg. In September 2008, her MRI spine showed healing at T 4 -T 5 vertebra with reduction in kyphoid deformity. There was no healing at L 4 -L 5 level. She was advised to continue same drugs. Subsequently the child was lost to follow-up.",

She had bilateral inguinal adenopathy with left sided otorrhea, and hepatomegaly. Auscultation revealed decreased air-entry on left side with bilateral crepitations. There was no shift of mediastinum. CT chest showed cavity and consolidation in left lower lobe with confluent centrilobular nodules in left upper lobe and lingula. Her sputum culture report showed resistance to H,R,E,S and O. She was treated with Z, amikacin, moxifloxacin, PAS and ethionamide. The patient was asymptomatic till one month when she developed cervical adenopathy with parotid enlargement that responded to non-steroidal antiinflammatory medicines (NSAIDS). Her chest X-ray showed improvement in the consolidation. By 3 months of therapy, she had no sputum production, her weight had increased to 17 kg. However, at end of 5 months of therapy, she was detected to have bilateral moderate to severe mixed hearing loss at high frequency on audiological evaluation and thus amikacin was omitted. Her remaining ATT were continued and regular screening for adverse effects was done. She is on regular follow up. She underwent left lower lobe lobectomy after 15 months of this therapy and culture from the specimen did not show any growth of acid fast bacillus. The remaining drugs are still being continued.",

On examination his weight was 20 kg and height was 126.0 cm. He had generalized non significant cervical, inguinal and axillary lymph nodes. Systemic examination was normal and mantoux was positive (12 \u00d7 12mm). Chest Xray was normal. Ultrasound of abdomen showed mild hepatomegaly with multiple enlarged mesenteric lymphnodes in right paraumbilical and umbilical regions measuring 7 mm in short axis. He was started on 4 drug ATT with HRZE, which was shifted to consolidation phase of 2 drug ATT after 2 months. He was asymptomatic on follow up and at the end of 9 months of therapy gained 3 kg. However, his ultrasound abdomen showed persistence of lymphnodes and increase in size to 11.2 mm. Thus he was continued on ATT for a longer duration and was stopped after total duration of 10 months. A repeat ultrasound had shown decrease in size of node to 0.5 cm. After 3 months, child again presented with cough for 1 week and abdominal pain. CT abdomen showed 1.3 cm nodes in mesentery, paracaval regions with central hypodense areas. At the same time, parents informed that the grandmother had died due to TB 6 months ago. Thus, he was suspected to have drug resistant TB. Child VOLUME 48 __ DECEMBER 17, 2011 CASE REPORTS underwent abdominal lymphnode biopsy and was started on category 2 of ATT regimen as per WHO consisting of HRZES. Culture after 6 weeks grew M. tuberculosis complex resistant to HRZES, ofloxacin and moxifloxacin., Treatment was started with PAS, amikacin, ethionamide and gatifloxacin. Child had currently completed 15 months of this second line therapy (gatifloxacin was stopped after one year) and asymptomatic. His ultrasound shows complete regression of lymphnodes.",

Childhood TB is usually a paucibacillary TB, thus making the acquisition of drug resistance in previously treated patient less likely, unless the child has been infected by a resistant strain. In our patients, two had contact with an adult suffering from TB who had died. Two of the patients had been on ATT for a year but had no improvement on their therapy suggesting that failure to respond to standard ATT therapy or contact with suspected drug resistance should be considered as a clue to suspect drug resistance in the child.",

This becomes essential as diagnosis of drug resistant TB is difficult in children and prognosis is guarded. In these patients, it is prudent to label it as a partial XDR TB as the resistance pattern is mid-way between MDR-TB and XDR-TB. It is feasible to classify different type of tuberculosis in children in different pattern of resistance for future prognosis and treatment. Although treatment success rates of 40% to 80% have been observed in a number of settings, this remains lower than the 85% to 99% cure rates achievable for drug-susceptible TB [4] .",

We report 3 children with partial XDR TB. Two responded to treatment while one was lost to follow-up. is defined as TB caused by organisms that are resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin, two first-line anti-TB drugs, The emergence of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), defined as MDR-TB that is also resistant to any one of the fluoroquinolones and to at least one of three injectable second-line drugs (amikacin, capreomycin or kanamycin), has been identified in all regions of the world since 2006. Treatment outcomes are significantly worse in XDR-TB patients than in MDR-TB patients [1, 2] . There is no term currently to identify drug resistant TB with either fluoroquinolone resistance or aminoglycoside resistance. Hence we have coined a term as partial XDR TB for these",
