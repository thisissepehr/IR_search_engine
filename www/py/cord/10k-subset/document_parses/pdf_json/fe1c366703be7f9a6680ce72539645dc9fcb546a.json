In this paper, we propose an improved local immunization strategy based on node's clustering which was seldom considered in the existing immunization strategies. The main aim of the proposed strategy is to iteratively immunize the node which has a high connectivity and a low clustering coefficient. To validate the effectiveness of our strategy, we compare it with two typical local immunization strategies on both real and artificial networks with a high degree of clustering. Simulations on these networks demonstrate that the performance of our strategy is superior to that of two typical strategies. The proposed strategy can be regarded as a compromise between computational complexity and immune effect, which can be widely applied in scale-free networks of high clustering, such as social network, technological networks and so on.

Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani [3] found the absence of epidemic threshold in scale-free networks, where virus can spread even when its spreading rate is very small. It implies that the methods by decreasing spreading rate cannot succeed in eradicating the epidemic in heterogeneous populations [4, 5] , but the immunization strategies by vaccinating the nodes can be effective in suppressing the epidemic and have been paid much more attention in recent years.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 179, "end": 182, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 329, "end": 332, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 366, "end": 369, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 630, "end": 633, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 634, "end": 636, "text": "5]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The best known strategy for heterogeneous networks is believed to be targeted immunization [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , such as high degree targeted (HD), high degree adaptive (HDA), high betweenness (HB) targeted strategies and so on. The basic idea of targeted strategies is first to rank the importance of nodes and then remove the nodes from highest importance to lowest until the network becomes disconnected. From the viewpoint of the spreading, Schneider et al. [11] introduced a novel inverse targeting strategy where the importance of nodes is represented by their a e-mail: jianggp@njupt.edu.cn contribution to the disease spreading. This strategy is much more efficient than the HDA strategy and is also as efficient as the HB targeted strategy. Using explosive percolation (EP) paradigm, Clusella et al. [12] proposed explosive immunization (EI) for immunization and targeted destruction of networks. Since in many cases the number of immunization doses is limited or very expensive, the equal-graph-partitioning (EGP) strategy [13] was proposed to fragment a given network with a minimum number of node removals. Indeed, finding the optimal set of influencers is important in both the immunization of networks and the destruction of networks by targeted attacks. Morone and Makse [14] investigated the influence maximization in complex networks through optimal percolation and presented collective influence (CI) algorithm to identify a new class of strategic influencers which outrank the hubs in the network. They compared the results obtained by CI and belief propagation-guided decimation (BPD) [15] algorithm on a single random scale-free network and found \"evidence of the best performance of CI\". Recently a systematic comparative study on the CI and the BPD algorithm was performed by Mugisha and Zhou (the author of BPD) and a slightly adjusted version of the BPD algorithm was applied to the network optimal attack problem [16] . The results of comparison demonstrate that the improved BPD has much better performance than the CI for different types of random networks and real-world networks. Building on the statistical mechanics perspective, Braunstein et al. [17] proposed a very efficient three-stage min-sum (MS) algorithm for solving the dismantling problem. Most of the above strategies require global information about network topology and exhibit clear advantage compared to existing heuristic strategies (such as HDA and HD). However, the global information is always difficult to gather and calculate for large scale networks. That is one reason why local immunization strategy is widely used in practice. For instance, acquaintance immunization [18] requires no knowledge of the node degrees or any other global information and is effective for any broad-scale distributed network. As for acquaintance immunization, the higher-connected nodes are immunized in the scale-free networks. Gallos et al. [19] introduced a purely local immunization strategy which is practically as efficient as the targeted immunization strategy of highest degree nodes. Their strategy consists of selecting a random node and then asking for a neighbor who has more links than himself or more than a given threshold k cut and this neighbor is immunized. However, the performance of this new strategy mainly depends on the selection of given threshold k cut which requires extensive calculations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 91, "end": 94, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 95, "end": 98, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 99, "end": 102, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 103, "end": 106, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 107, "end": 111, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 463, "end": 467, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 810, "end": 814, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1038, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1287, "end": 1291, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1606, "end": 1610, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1940, "end": 1944, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2180, "end": 2184, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2675, "end": 2679, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2929, "end": 2933, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Generally, many optimal immunization strategies [18] [19] [20] [21] on the heterogeneous networks retain the advantage of being purely local and their basic idea is to immunize the nodes with a higher influence. Thus, analyzing the topological characteristics of networks and identifying the most influential nodes in spreading dynamics is of utmost importance to prevent and control epidemics. Centola [22] investigated the spread of health behavior through artificially structured online communities and found that the behavior spreads farther and faster across clustered-lattice networks than across corresponding random networks. It was clear that his experimental results revealed the importance of clustering. From the analysis of the growth of Facebook, Ugander et al. [23] found that the probability of contagion is tightly controlled by the number of connected components in an individual's contact neighborhood, rather than by the actual size of the neighborhood. On the basis of empirical observation, Chen et al. [24] proposed a local ranking method, named ClusterRank, to identify influential nodes in directed networks by taking into account not only the number of neighbors and the neighbors' influences but also the clustering coefficient. In order to identify important people who are linked by strong social ties within an individual's network neighborhood, Backstrom and Kleinberg [25] developed a new measure of tie strength that they term \"dispersion\" characterizing the extent to which two people's mutual friends are not themselves well-connected. This measure of dispersion involves not only the number of mutual friends of two people, but also the network structure on these mutual friends [25] . Moreover, considering both the number and sizes of communities that are directly linked by a node, Zhao and others [26] introduced a new centrality index to identify influential spreaders in a network with the community structure.

The total number of nodes is n = |V |, and the total number of edges is m = |E|. Suppose that a node i has k i neighbors, and at most k i (k i \u2212 1)/2 edges can exist among these neighbors when every neighbor of node i is connected to every other neighbor of i. The clustering coefficient c i of node i denotes the fraction of these allowable edges that actually exist. The clustering coefficient C(G) of a graph G is the average over the clustering coefficients of its nodes. For social networks such as friendship networks, the clustering coefficient has intuitive meanings. The c i reflects the extent to which friends of i are also friends of each other, and the C(G) measures the cliquishness of a typical friendship circle. When the degrees of nodes are the same, the node with a lower clustering coefficient has a more dispersive social circle. In of node b has a particularly close connection. In Figure 1b , the node i and the node j both have six neighbors, but the friends of node i are not very familiar with each other.

The effectiveness of our strategy has been verified through comparing with two typical local immunization strategies on both real-world and scale-free networks with a high level of clustering. In terms of application, the proposed strategy regarded as a compromise between computational complexity and immune effect can be widely applied in social network, technological networks, such as Internet and WWW, where the number of links and the connected user (or hyperlink) categories for a given node are exactly known to the network administrator.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "L.X., G.J. and Y.S. designed research, L.X. and B.S. performed simulations and plotted the figures, L.X., G.J. and Y.S. analyzed the simulation results, L.X. and G.J. wrote the manuscript.
