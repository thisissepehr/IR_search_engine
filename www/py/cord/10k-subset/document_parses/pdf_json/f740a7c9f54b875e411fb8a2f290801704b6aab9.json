It is their function in the inflammatory response however that is of most interest to us in the intensive care setting. Over the last three decades we have gained significant insights into leukocyte activation, recruitment and mediator secretion and the contribution of these agents to both the onset and resolution of sepsis and inflammation. The body relies on the inflammatory response for protection. Leukocytes occupy a pivotal position in this but to maintain these cells in a state of permanent activation would be unsustainable, with widespread microvascular plugging, uncontrolled free radical release and an excessive metabolic demand. Leukocytes thus circulate in a quiescent state and are rapidly activated by invading pathogens and other stimuli. A direct consequence of this protective strategy is that the inflammatory response may be inadequate, with the risk of overwhelming sepsis, or excessive, leading to rampant systemic inflammation and consequent multiple organ damage. It is now becoming apparent however that in addition to leukocytes other cells have important roles both in defence against invading pathogens and in driving malignant inflammation. This review will focus on two new facets of the innate immune system, the Toll family of proteins as the signal transduction element for endotoxin, and the antimicrobial peptides. These exemplify potential damaging and protective response elements but importantly neither are restricted to leukocytes. The capacity of cells and tissues other than the leukocytes to participate and even lead in the inflammatory responses will also be explored. mand with progressive tissue damage and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). A direct consequence of this protective strategy is that the inflammatory response may be either inadequate, with the risk of overwhelming sepsis, or excessive, leading to rampant systemic inflammation [9] . Recently further layers of complexity have been described including the endogenous compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS) protecting against excessive inflammation [7] . Moreover the underlying insult can impair the immune response and aggressive or persisting inflammation can lead to a state of anergy and heightened risk of further infection [10] . To address the role of leukocytes in the inflammatory process and the balance that needs to be struck between an ineffective and an excessive response we need to understand a little about the inflammatory response itself. This also needs to be put into context as the leukocytes are not the only players involved.

Although billions of dollars have been spent on the, as yet, fruitless search for immunomodulatory agents that will effectively damp this response it has become clear that an intact and robust inflammatory response is indeed crucial for survival. Anti-TNF therapy provides an excellent example of how important the normal inflammatory response is as inhibition of TNF-a activity leads to increased not decreased mortality in a number of septic models including caecal ligation and puncture, Listeria, and Candida albicans infections [28\u00b130] . In other diseases such as malaria, TNF-a blockade may be beneficial or harmful depending upon the underlying susceptibility which may be under genetic regulation [31, 32] . This highlights the importance of differentiating between live micro-organisms and non-infectious agents such as LPS when interpreting results from inflammatory models [30] . Furthermore the method whereby neutralising antibodies are delivered may also be critical [33] . This is even more neatly demonstrated by Yersinia enterocolitica infection where this bacterium produces a protein called YopB which directly inhibits host TNF-a production [34] . Inhibition of YopB with an anti-YopB serum increases TNF-a production and reduces bacterial growth again demonstrating the key role of TNF-a in controlling infection.

Similarly prolonged critical illness leads to immune hypo-responsiveness, the cause of which is unclear but can be related to reduced leukocyte responsiveness and monocyte HLA-DR expression has successfully been used as a surrogate marker of this [10]. Boosting leukocyte functional responses by interferon g have been associated with a significant improvement in outcome suggesting that a fully functional leukocyte response throughout the inflammatory response is vital to successful outcome.

The concept that leukocytes could directly damage the host is not new. As so eloquently described by Lewis Thomas \u00aaIt is the information carried by the bacteria that we cannot abide. The Gramnegative bacteria are the best examples of this. They display lipopolysaccharide endotoxin in their walls, and these macromolecules are read by our tissues as the very worst of bad news. When we sense lipopolysaccharide, we are likely to turn on every defence at our disposal\u00ba [43] .

Moreover endothelial cells and mesothelial cells can present antigen while fibroblasts can phagocytose apoptotic cells. Thus consider the peritoneum in the absence of neutrophils and macrophages. Infection can elicit a massive surge of pro-inflammatory cytokines and free radicals, the omentum can wall off and localise infection while mesothelial cells can present antigen to lymphocytes driving an adaptive immune response. Similarly in the lung the endothelial and epithelial cells along with fibroblasts can reproduce much of the classic inflammatory response that we normally associate with the leukocytes. These include many cytokines such as IL-1 and TGFb which are directly implicated in the pathogenesis of ARDS and consequent fibrosis [51] .

The Toll gene was first described for its function in dorsoventral pattern formation in Drosophila, but it also controls the fly's immune response to fungal infection [55] .

LPS induced signalling though Toll leads to activation of NFkB and pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis. Importantly, non-myeloid cells can be activated by LPS in a CD14/LBP dependent fashion and Toll-like receptors are expressed on cells other than peripheral blood leukocytes. There are 5 TLR described in man, It is unknown as yet whether other TLR recognise other major pattern recognition molecules such as peptidoglycan, teichoic acid. Certainly Drosophila, which do not have an adaptive immune response, can elicit relatively specific responses to the major classes of bacteria through innate pattern recognition molecules [56] . Furthermore the TLR are not restricted to the phagocytes, indeed with expression on intestinal cells for example, their distribution is quite broad. This provides multiple cells with the capacity to respond to LPS (and possibly to other major classes of bacterial cell wall proteins). Hence it may well be through innate immune defences such as Toll that cells other than phagocytes participate in the inflammatory response.

The main source of BPI are the phagocytes and BPI inhibits LPS delivery to monocyte CD14 and appears to condense LPS aggregates whilst LBP promotes LPS delivery to monocyte CD14 and disaggregates LPS [62] . LBP does however promote the transfer of LPS into phospholipid micelles and most endotoxin added to blood ends up in the lipoprotein fraction. Moreover lipoprotein depletion increases TNF-a levels and mortality while increased lipoprotein levels improve mortality and this is due at least in part to reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [63] . HDL is the main LPS binding lipoprotein, although some is found in LDL but very little in VLDL/chylomicrons. It seems that with time HDL hands LPS over to LDL which takes it to the liver where it is secreted in the bile. Septic patients often have very low HDL and apo a-1 levels which may increase their sensitivity to LPS. Furthermore increasing HDL through the use of reconstituted rHDL discs decreases TNF-a levels [64] . This is despite an increase in detectable LPS due to retention in the circulation in relatively inaccessible aggregates in HDL. The binding of LPS to cells is far faster however than HDL inactivation, with cell binding occurring within minutes while HDL inactivation occurring over 4 to 24 hours [65] . Reconstituted HDL is a powerful binder and neutraliser of LPS but is similarly slow.
