India's central and state governments have taken the pandemic very seriously and have made several unprecedented and innovative interventions. In the past India had neglected to monitor endemic/seasonal influenza, but the pandemic has raised public awareness to a high level through print and electronic media. This perspective offers a review of information on global evolution of this pandemic.",

Human influenza viruses belong to 3 types, A, B and C. Only type A causes pandemics. It was the 'highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 virus' (HPAI-H5N1) that emerged as pan-zootic in 2003 that alerted the world of an impending pandemic (4, 5) . It infected humans only rarely (6) . In February 2006, it affected poultry farms in the tri-junction region of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. During 2008 and 2009, it infected farm and backyard chicken in several districts in West Bengal, Assam, Tripura and Sikkim (7) . Massive culling within 3 kilometers of infected birds and strict control of importation of chicks and feeds halted the outbreak. No human infection occurred in India (7) . Globally, 442 human infections and 262 deaths (case-fatality 59%) were reported in 15 countries (7) . It does not transmit between humans; hence it did not seed a pandemic. However, anticipating a pandemic, India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) drafted a Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan (PPRP) in 2004 (8) .",

            "text": "Pandemic-09-H1N1 virus caused the pandemic starting in the second quarter of 2009. The world was prepared to face the pandemic since it was anticipated for over one decade. Most countries, including India, had made detailed pandemic preparedness plans well ahead of its actual occurrence. The infection rapidly spread to the whole country within 2-3 months. The national tactics were to slow down its importation through international air travelers and to slow down its spread in cities and major towns. More than 75% of all infected persons were urban dwellers, suggesting that efforts were concentrated in urban communities. In general the illness of pandemic influenza has been similar to endemic/seasonal influenza; however, there is insufficient epidemiological and clinical data on the latter. We hope that the unprecedented experience of managing the pandemic will encourage the Government of India to plan to confront endemic/seasonal influenza more systematically. The pandemic seems to have reached a peak in September/October and has been on the decline since then. Simultaneous host infection with 2 subtypes can lead to the emergence of 'reassortant' viruses with different gene configuration from either parent virus. If the emergent virus carries surface antigens not present in earlier circulating strains, the phenomenon is called as 'antigenic shift'. Since wild birds and swine are frequently infected with several H and N subtypes, antigenic shift is relatively frequent among avian and swine influenza viruses. Host-specificity and transmission efficiency are determined by cellsurface virus receptors. Swine's receptors accept swine, avian and human viruses and serve as 'mixing vessel' for antigenic shift. If shifted virus is capable of efficient human-to-human transmission, the stage is set for pandemic as humans would be immunologically na\u00efve to it. Only a rare antigenic variant may be fit for human infection, thus seeding a pandemic.",

Thereafter it would exhibit antigenic drift; thus more than one drifted variant may co-circulate. H1N1 virus circulated globally from 1918 till 1957 and was replaced by H2N2 virus; in 1968, H3N2 virus replaced H2N2. The seasonal H3N2 viruses that continue to be isolated globally are descendants of the 1968 pandemic virus. In 1977 a descendant of the 1918 pandemic H1N1 virus reappeared in northern hemisphere; it might have been accidentally released from a laboratory (13) . It slowly established circulation globally; subsequently endemic/seasonal viruses in both hemispheres are H3N2 and H1N1.",

Antigenic changes in seasonal H3N2 occur by mutations and genetic recombination between co-circulating viruses of the same subtype (22) .

Reassortment with cocirculating viruses of a different subtype may also occur; the fear is that viruses with greater pathogenicity and efficient transmissibility may thus emerge. Of greatest concern is the possibility of re-assortment with HPAI-H5N1 in domestic poultry/ VOLUME 47 __ . Since P-09-H1N1 binds to URT receptors, it circulates among humans.

Inactivated vaccines may be whole virus or subunit (split) and with or without adjuvant. Over 150 million doses have already been administered. The current FDA-approved vaccine is non-adjuvanted (38) . For children (6 months-10 years), 2 doses and for all above 10, a single dose has been recommended (38) . Adjuvanted vaccines are in use in some European countries. The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety is currently reviewing safety data. In general the safety profile has been excellent; anaphylaxis may occur and the vaccine-provider should be fully prepared to detect early signs/symptoms and to treat immediately and appropriately. Since seasonal virus and pandemic virus are co-circulating in many countries, both vaccines are recommended for simultaneous vaccination in a few countries (39) . There are various recommendations for prioritizing vaccination in different population groups (37, 39) . The P-09-H1N1 virus will replace seasonal H1N1 virus for southern hemisphere winter of 2010 (39) .",
