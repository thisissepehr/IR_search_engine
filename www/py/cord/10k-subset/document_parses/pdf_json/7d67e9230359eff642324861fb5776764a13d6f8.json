Material and Methods: Previously healthy patients admitted for lower airway disease to the PICU between 1991 to 1994 were grouped by year. Age, severity of illness (SI), PICU and hospital length-ofstay (hours), prorated hospital bill, year of admission and patient-specific PICU originated costs (POC) were retrieved. Patient-specific POC was obtained by using the cost-to-charge ratios for each participating department. The costs for radiology, laboratory and electrocardiology were added and expressed as cost for diagnostic tests. Results: Eighty-nine patients fulfilled the admission criteria. There was a decrease of POC through the four year period (p <0.05 r 2 0.04). Two factors were associated with an increase in POC: an increase in the SI (p <0.0001 r 2 0.35) and the presence ofintubation (p = 0.001 ). The decrease through the years remained present even when excluding intubated patients and adjusting for SI (N 79, coef for year = -368, p = 0.038). The decline in costs for diagnostic tests was the most prominent of all areas (p = 0.0004, r 2 0.15); this was 58% of the initial cost. The decrease in POC were paralleled with the ones in hospital lengthof-stay and the prorated hospital bill. Conclusion: The costs for the management of mese previously heaithy patients affectea with Lower airway disease decreased over the study period.

            "text": "We present the results of a prospective population-based audit of paediatric intensive care activity in two comparable communities with markedly different delivery systems. In the Trent region of the UK (4.2 million people), children receive intensive care largely without the supervision of a paediatric intensivist in a variety of hospitals, few of which have designated Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs). Critically ill children otherwise receive intensive care in children's wards, special care baby units (SCBUs) or adult intensive care units. In the Australian State of Victoria (4.5 million people), children receive intensive care almost exclusively in one centre -a PICU staffed by full time paediatric intensivists. The two regions are otherwise demographically comparable. In both groups, data were collected on all children admitted to an intensive care unit between 1/4/94 and 31/3/95 and children who received intensive care (defined by levels of intervention and nurse dependency) in other sites during the same period. Values of each variable at first contact with the ICU, and the highest and lowest values over the first 24 hours were recorded. The principal outcome was survival to discharge from the intensive care unit. Severity of illness was assessed using PIM (Paediatric Index of Mortality) and PRISM. Risk-adjusted mortality was compared using Flora's Z test and logistic regression. The rate of utilisation of intensive care (>1000 admissions in each region) were similar. There was some variation in case mix between the two groups, but crude mortality rates were similar (7.4% in Trent and 6.6% in Victoria). However severity corrected data and other measures of PICU performance were dramatically better in' the centralised delivery system. The substantial excess mortality in the Trent region provides strong evidence for the benefits of centralisation of paediatric intensive care services. There are considerable difficulties in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness oflcare in children presenting with respiratory failure during acute medical illness. Optimal outcomes for such episodes include survival and the shortest length of stay (LOS) in intensive care with negligible risk of readmission. We have tried to determine whether or not the time course of acute severe medical illness with respiratory failure is predictable. Study I (n=1000): A retrospective study of intubated and mechanically ventilated children (>28 days, <17 years) with acute severe medical illness. Measures: Diagnosis, intensive care LOS in calender days, and survival. Results: The underlying diagnosis fell within one of three broad categories: respiratory disease (n=521, mortality 19.2%), central nervous system (CNS) disease (n=342, mortality 38.7%), and systemic inflammation or multisystem (SIMS) disease (n=137, mortality 47.5%. The LOS in survivors was: respiratory -median (interquartile range) 8(4-16) days, CNS 4(3-8) days, \u00a3p,4\u00a3 5(7-g) days. 5:i'~'-+cen diag~,~is-rc!ated-grnnp~ (DRGs) were identified (8 respiratory, 5 CNS, 3 SIMS disease) and each have been characterised by mortality and LOS. Study II (n=300): A prospective study of patients supported by the hypothesis that LOS for the above DRGs was predictable (compared with Study I data). In certain instances attributable causes for variances in LOS were identified: e.g. disease severity, timing ofdrug therapy, and associated disease. With daily paediatric risk of morality scoring within each DRG, four profiles of instability were identified. Discussion: The time course of acute severe medical illness with respiratory failure is predictable and variance may be attributable to specific care or diagnostic factors. We are now developing a means of linking DRG-specific clinical care pathways with an integrated computerised decision support and education facility at the bedside. The objective of this open, prospective study was to assess the relation between basic patient characteristics as well as effectiveness of treatment on the one hand and resource utilization in pediatric intensive care on the other. As universal, non-monetary indicators of resource utilization we used the Therapeutic Intervention Score System (TISS) and length-ofstay (LOS), from which indicators for total resource utilization per admission (TISSTOT) and average daily resource utilization (TISS-MEAN = TISSTOT/LOS) were obtained. Overall 593 admissions, totalling 3130 days, were included. Mortality was 8.4%; non-survivors accounted for 14.1% of overall resource utilization. In non-survivors, both total resource utilization per admission and average daily resource utilization were higher, whereas LOS was not different from survivors'. Severity of illness, surgical status, the presence of substantial chronic comorbidity, emergency admission and transfer from another hospital constituted the major predictive determinants of TISSTOT (r:=0.19) and TISSMEAN (ra=0.45) in multiple regression analysis (p<0.0001). Hence these indicators are appropriate non-monetary measures of resource utilization, a considerable proportion of which are determined by a concise set of basic clinical characteristics. Subsequently we analysed the relation between effectiveness of care and resource utilization by assessing severity of illness corrected mortality in low, medium and high resource users, respectively. These 3 categories were delineated by percer/tiles of resource utilization (< P20, P20-PS0, > Ps0). Despite on average long LOS and high resource utilization in the high risk group, a relatively low standardized mortality was found, probably warranting prolonged intensive treatment in this patient category.",

The records included: age, sex, weight, mechanical ventilation (MV), post-operative condition (P.Op), malnutrition, diagnosis, length of stay, PRISM score and outcome. Student test, Mann-Whitney or Wileoxon were performed for univariate analysis. Fisher Exact test or Chi square for dicotomic variables. Risk group analysis was performed by logistic regression, odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. Results: 650 patients entered the study. Mean age was 47.6 months (DS hh\u00a2# 60) and median 18 months.

            "text": "Background The use of PRISM or other scoring systems in the ICU is of great importance for evaluating the efficacy and efficiency of a particular ICU, The PRISM score was developed and validated in the USA and Europe but has recently been shown to be inaccurate in a South American population, a South African population as well as several European studies. Part of the poor performance of the PRISM score is as a result of differences in the case mix between the reference population and other paediatric ICUs. Since scoring systems should generally be used only in populations similar to the reference population from which the prediction model was developed, a modification of the PRISM score is necessary to improve its discriminatory ability in a wide range of patient groups, Aim To improve the predictive power of the PRISM score in a South African paediatdc ICU population. Patients & Methods We analysed PRISM, demographic and clinical data collected prospectively from 1528 consecutive paediatrie ICU admissions. The prediction of actual mortality by PRISM was evaluated by standard statistical methodology (goodness-of-fit test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis), The components of the PRISM logistic regression equation (PRISM score, operative status and age) and the 14 physiological variables making up the PRISM score in addition 10 new variables analysed (nutritional index, the need for inotropes and institution of mechanical ventilation) were subjected to discriminant analysis to determine their association with outcome. Results The goodness-of-fit test showed a significant failure of PRISM to accurately predict mortality over a wide range of expected mortality (Chi2[8] = 195, p = 0). PRISM underpredicted mortality at lower PRISM scores, but overpredicted mortality in patients with high PRISMs. Similarly ROC anNysis indicated apoor predic~Jve power (Az = 0.73 \u00b1 0.01), with an area under the curve significantly less than that for the PRISM reference population (p = 0), PRISM showed equally poor discriminatory function at all age groups and diagnosfic categories. '~Mth the addition of an index of nutrifional status (proportional weight-far-age), and indicators of early respiratory and cardiovascular failure to the logistic regression formula, and a recalibration of the acute physiological score component, the ROC can be improved to 0.83 \u00b1 0.02, with a good fit described by the goodness-of-fit test (CN218] = 3, p = 0.89). Discussion The PRISM score is not accurate in our patient population has been recalibrated in view of the poor discriminatory function that we have shown. Part of the inaccuracy derives from the different demographic characteristics of our ICU population and a different pattern of diseases. In addition to assessments of acute physiological aberrations, an assessment of nutritional status and early respiratory and cardiovascular failure significantly improve the discriminatory ability of the PRISM score, These parameters have been devised with a view to improving the accuracy of PRISM in our population, while not decreasing its accuracy in ICUs similar to the reference population. In interviewing parents regarding how physicians have communicated bad news, the response I have received is that it has not infrequently been done without appropriate care, understanding and compassion. Personal experience and the lessons learned from parents, chaplains and others who deal extensively with these situations have provided me with an approach that has been supportive, compassionate, and caring. An especially difficult communication situation for the intensivist occurs when the parents have to be informed of the death of their child. For the parent, death is the hardest loss of all -the ultimate unalterable loss. Circumstances surrounding the death are an important consideration (e.g., a fatal crash caused by a drunken driver, a prolonged illness, a suicide, AIDS). Each produces a different grief reaction. The physician needs to inform parents of their child's death sympathetically coming right out with the news and leaving details until later. Allow pauses and time for the paren~ to express sorrow and grief, The best communication may be thoughtful silence and a tender touch. There is disbelief that this happened. It is necessary to repeat oneself. Acknowledgment of the parent's \"feeling terrible\" and the physician's acknowledgment of how terrible he/she feels that the life of the child could not be saved is an important first step in the parent's dealing with this tragic loss.",

In the present study we investigated the effect of intracarotid histamine injection on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, Left internal carotid artery of 30 newborn pigs (4-8 h; 1,180-1,530g; ketamine anesthesia, 10 mg x kg 4) was catheterized through the external branch and different doses of histamine (0, 10 -6, 5xi0 -6, 10 -5, 5x104, 104 M, respectively, in 6 groups of animals; n=5 in each) diluted in 1.0 ml isotonic saline was injected into the vessel through 1 rain. BBB permeability was determined for a small (sodium fluorescein, SF, 376 Da) and a large (Evans blue/albumin, EBA, 67 kDa) tracer (2%, 5 mLxkg 4, 30 rain circulation time for both dyes) concomitantly in frontal, parietal and occipital cortex, hippocampus, and periventrieular white matter both on left and right sides 1 h after the challenge. Then, intravascular dyes were removed by perfusion and BBB permeability for both tracers was quantified by fluorescence spectrophotometry (wavelengths for excitation and emission were 440 nm and 525 nm for SF; and 620 nm and 680 nm for EBA, respectively). Histamine injection, in doses higher than 10 .6 M, significantly (P<0.05; Kruskal-Wallis one way ANOVA on ranks followed by Dunn's test) increased BBB permeability for both tracers in each brain region. Changes in left hemisphere were more intense (P<0.05) than those in right one after the doses of 5xi0 -6 and 10 -5 M in each region, i0 4 M histamine administration induced similar edema in both sides. Increased intracarotid histamine levels resulted in a dose-dependent vasogenic brain edema formation. Histamine might have a pathogenetic role in neonatal hypoxicischemic cerebral injuries.",

H6rnchen In this controlled, prospective study 30 ventilated premature infants with a birth weight < 1250 g were randomized to receive treatment with dexamethasone (DEX) either on day 7 of life or on day 14 of life. DEX was given over 16 days tapering from 0.5 mg/kg/day to 0.1 mg/kg/day. The infants treated with DEX on day 7 of life could be weaned earlier from the ventilator -in median after 14 days (range 10 -34) versus 24 days (range 8 -44) in the [ate treatment group (p = 0.01). The need for supplemental oxygen was shorter in the early treatment group -in median 24 days (range 10 -50) versus 40 days (range 10 -70) (p = 0.2, ns). The incidence of chronic lung disease was lower in the early treatment group -6 of 14 infants (42.9%) versus 10 of 16 patients (62.5%) (ns). To evaluate the long-term efficacy of early DEX treatment we performed a respiratory function test in the age of 3 -6 months using an infant whole body-plethysmograph. The intrathoracic gas volume (ITGV), the airway resistance (R.w) and the airway conductance (Gaw) were measured and no significant differences could be detected between the groups. The frequency of adverse effects due to DEX therapy was found to be without significant differences between the early and the late treatment group. We conclude that early DEX treatment had short-term improvements in pulmonary outcome in our study population, long-term efficacy however, remained unproven. Several factors contribute to the development of chronic lung disease (CLD) in premature infants including structural immaturity of the lung, mechanical ventilation, and oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species are formed during normal cellular metabolism but they are generated in higher concentrations during inflammation or inhalation of high oxygen concentrations. To study the relationship between increased oxidative stress, antioxidants and the development of CLD we examined 102 ventilated premature infants with birth weights below t500g. 32 infants developed severe chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD), defined by radiological signs of CLD and an increased oxygen requirement at a postconceptional age of 36 weeks, and 29 infants had moderate CLD with an increased oxygen requirement on day 28 but not at an age of 36 weeks. Ventilator settings (FiO2, peak inspiratory and mean airway pressure) and the incidence of early-onset-sepsis were significantly higher in the severe CLD group than in infants with moderate CLD or without CLD (n=41) during the first week of life. Plasma concentrations of the two antioxidative substances bilirubin and uric acid (UA) were comparable in all groups during the first days of life. However, on day seven bilirubin and UA were significantly decreased in the plasma of infants with severe and moderate CLD compared to the non CLD group (p<O.001). There was no difference between both CLD groups. In serially obtained tracheal aspirate fluids (TAF) malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured by HPLC as an indicator of lipid peroxidation reflecting oxygen injury of the lung. UA was found in higher concentrations in TAF than bilirubin. UA has been proven to be a potent antioxidant, capable to react especially with hydroxyl radicals and hydrochlerous acid, which play an important role in the induction of lipid peroxidation. Infants with severe CLD had significantly higher MDNUA ratios in TAF from day 5 to 14 compared to the non-CLD group (p<O.01). MDNUA ratios in TAF of infants with moderate CLD were significantly higher from day 7 on but still lower than in the severe CLD group. In addition, the ratio oxidized / reduced glutathione was significantly increased in TAF of infants with CLD compared to infants without CLD between day 5 and 14. The data support the hypothesis that an imbalance of oxidative stress and antioxidant defense contributs to the onset of CLD at the end of the first week of life. Introduction. Rocuronium bromide (Roe), a neuromuscular blocking agent with an onset time dose to that of succinyleholine l'z, has been studied in American Society of Anesthesiologists' Physical Status (ASA) I or II pedlatrie patients under non-critical elective conditions. There is a paucity of studies looking at the pharmacodynamics of Roc under emergent conditions, involving pediatric patients who are ASA III or IV, without the use of adjuvant inhaled anesthetics ~. Methods. With approval of our Committee on Clinical Investigations (IRB), Roe 1.2 mg/kg was administered to 15 ASA III/IV pediatric intensive care patients (age 40 days to 23 months; M:F=8:7) on intravenous sedation. The time to reach 25% a~d 10% of b~elinc tetanie stimulus response was recorded using a R.elaxogra'ph/qMT-100 nerve stimulator/recorder (Datex, Helsiaki). Depth of clinical relaxation at the 25% level was recorded. Results. The time from rapid bolus to 25% was 25.4+12.6 see with a range of 10-50 see; and to 10% was 30.1+17.6 see, with a range of 10-69 see. At the 25% level, excellent clinical relaxation was seen. Conduslon. In critically ill children, use of Roe at 1.2 mg/kg produces rapid onset of neuromuscular blockade and excellent clinical relaxation, such that Roe should be considered for rapid sequence intubation.",

Diagnoses included ARDS (6), postoperative cardiac surgery (7), head trauma (1), and resfrictive lung disease (2). Patients were randomized to PCV (9) or VCV (7). Initial measurements of gas exchange (ABG's) and respiratory mechanics (Ventrak, Novametrix Medical Systems) were obtained after a 20 minute stabilizadon period. Respiratory mechanics included PIP, PEEP, Paw, delivered tidal volume, and Cdyn (Avolume/Apressure). The patients were then crossed over to the alternate mode of ventilation holding delivered tidal volume, PEEP, inspiratory time, minute ventilation, and FiO2 constant. Data were collected after 20 minutes, In each mode the absence of intrinsic PEEP was confirmed. To assure that the measurements were not affected by changes in clinical status, the patients were returned to the initial mode of ventilation and measurements repeated (Final) . Patients were ventilated with a Siemens 900C or SV300.",

Lasch***, Appel**, J.M611er**** and the \"Arbeitsgemeinschaft ARDS im Kindesalter\" Background Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a therapeutic challenge in pediatric intensive care in view of the high mortality, In 1992 about 50 German paediatlic hospitals founded a working group aiming on collaborative clinical research in this field. Aims and methods The aim of both a prospective and retrospective survey conducted in German pediatric intensive care units in 1993 was to accumulate data on the epidemiology, risk factors, natural history and treatment strategies in a large group of pediatric ARDS patients who were treated in the tt~ee year period from 1991 to 1993.All patients had acute bilateral alveolar infiltration of noncardiogenic origin and a pO2~iO2 ratio < 150mmHg. The influence of sex, underlying disease and single organ failure was analyzed using the Fischer's exact test, the influence of additional organ failure on mortality was tested with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszet statistics. Results 112 patients were reported giving an incidence of 7 cases per 1000 admissions to pediatric ICUs. Median age was 24 month. In 43% of the cases, ARDS was associated with a pulmonary, in 39% with a systemic underlying disease. In 20% immunocompetence was impaired. Mortality was 46% and not dependent on age, sex and triggering event. The number of associated organ failures, however, strongly influenced mortalib,. Mortafity in immuno-compromised patients was 8 t %. The Analysis of treatment modalifies employed in the patients revealed a lack of uniform therapeutic strategies. On the other hand, the patients were exposed to interventions not yet supported by controlled trials. Conclusions The observation of the lack of uniform treatment strategies led to the elaboration of recommendations on ventilator therapy and patient monitoring within the working group. The data gathered in this survey provide the basis for the design of prospective multicenter studies urgently needed to evaluate innovative treatment modafities in pediatric ARDS. Recurrent apnea and respiratory failnre due to severe lower respiratory tract disorders such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia are the most common reasons for mechanical ventilation during respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been described as a complication of severe RSV infectionJ In contrast to the low mortality rates associated with RSV infection (< 5 %), mortality rates in the range of 40-70 % have been reported in pediatric patients with ARDS. However, studies on ARDS are usually lumped in respect to causation and the disease course of RSV induced ARDS has not been previously studied.",

            "text": "We examined the lung function abnormalities of 37 infants with RSV induced respiratory failure requiring assisted ventilation, Measurements included respiratory mechanics, maximal expiratory flow-volume curves and lung volumes, ARDS was defined clinically using the criteria which were recently proposed by the American-European Consensus Conference on ARDS~: acute disease onset, PaO2/FiO~ ratio _< 200 mrn Hg, bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph and absence of clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension. We calculated the Murray lung injury scores modified for use in pediatric patients 3 from total respiratory system compliance, radiographic findings, ventilator settings and blood gas results. We identified 10 infants with severe restrictive lung disease that fialfilled the clinical criteria fbr classification as ARDS. All had lung injury scores above 2.5 which is the recommended cut-off for a diagnosis of ARDS, Twenty-seven infants had obstructive disease consistent with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis. The ARDS patients were significantly younger, had a longer time of assisted ventilation (p <0.05) and a greater proportion of infants with preexisting illnesses (p=0.023, Odds ratio =6.67) when compared to the patients with obstructive disease. With the exception of one immunodeficient patient, none of these infants died. Given the low mortality despite a clinical picture of severe lung injury, there is evidence that RSV induced respiratory failure may represent a relatively benign cause of ARDS in pediatric patients, Bachmann An audit of patients with severe acute bypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF) receiving highfrequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) in our unit ( n=32, mortality 75%) revealed that sub-groups with severe underlying disease (n=14, mortality 100%)and those with mu~pie organ failure ( > 2 systems failing, n=7 mortality 100%) accounted for all the deaths beyond the neonatal period. V~ therefore hypothesized that in a modem paedistric intensive care unit (PICU): a) children greater than one month of age with AHRF do not die in the absence of severe, pre-existing disease or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, b) respiratory parameters alone will predict outcome poorly in AHRF. Method Prospect~/e sty/of all adm~ns to our tertiary PICU. Data it, citing the respiratory parameters (oxygena~n index [Ol] , aiveolar-artedal oxygen tension gradient , PaO2/FiO2 ratio) were collected hourly from the bedside charts throughout admission. Patients were included in the study if AHRF was present at admission either None or in combination with other organ dysfun~on. AHRF was defined as the acute (<48hour) onset of respiratory dysfunctk:~l with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio.< 200 for six consecutive hours dunng the first 24 hours of admission (with no evidence of left anal hypertension), X-ray review defined a sub-group of patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) by the presence of bilateral interstitial infiltrates. Results To date 59 children (ages 1-168 months, weight 1.2-70 kg) have been admitted in AHRF. 18 of these also had ARDS. The overall mortality was 23.7% (14/59), and greater in the ARDS group than the non-ARDS group (10t18, 55.5% Vs, 4141, 9.7%, p< O.01) . It was not possible to predict survivors from non-survivors on the basis of the seventy of the respiratory failure alone, The A-aDO2 on the day of admission (best in 24 hours) was not significantly different between survivors and non-survivors: (mean, + sd)(174 mmHg +_108, Vs 304 mmHg _+_156). kdl non-survivors were immunodeficient (n=8), previously extmrnsly premature infants (<28140),(n=3) or suffedng fcom chronic metabolic or gastrointestinal disease (n=3). No previously normal child died. Conclusion The severity of respiratory failure does not allow prediolJon of outcome in our patients. We believe that this reflects that modem PICU is so effective at providing respiratory support that pre-existing pathology alone de~ prognosis. This suggests that an abnormally regulated host response or abnormal persistence of a pathogen may be required to induce lung injury of sufficient severity that the resulting respiratory failure cannot be supported in a modem PICU. Introduction: Postural changes (supine to prone) is a therapeutic intervention that could be useful in children with adult respiratory distress syndrome. Objective: To determine the effects of postural changes in the oxygenation of young children with ARDS. Method,s: A prospective stud3,\" was performed in eleven subjects aged 6 to 120 months (mean=33) with the diagnosis of ARDSreceiving vendlatory support. (mean PEEP and FiO2 of 9 and 0.75 respectively). Postural changes was performed every 8-12 hours, during a period of time ranging from 5 to 16 days. Arterial blood gases were determined before and 30-60 n~n after the postural change, No modification in the mechattical ventilation other that changes in the FiO2 were performed. The oxygenation was determined by the index PaO2/Fi02 (P/F). To study the differences between the oxygenation mean, before and after the postural changes the Wilcoxon test for paired samples was used, Results: 184 changes were performed (104 from supine to prone and 80 from prone to supine). A9% increased P/F ratio was obtained after the change from supine to prune. Although, not all the patients receiving postural changes improved their P/F. Six of them (Group I) showed an improve in the P/F when changed from supine to prone, returning to their base line when positioned from prone to supine. No improvement on the P/F was observed in the remaining 5 subjects (Group II)after postural changes (Table 1) . During the maneuver no complications were observed. Two patients had a pneumothorax, not related with the postural change. Conclusions: Postural changes (supine to prone) is an easy way to improve oxygenation in some children with ARDS.",

            "text": "Eighteen (18) INTRODUCTION: Cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) in children is usually preceded by a deterioration of cardiac or respiratory function due to sepsis, dehydration and hypovolemia. Early recognition of clinical and laboratory signs followed by immediate intervention are essential for prevention of CPA. The purpose of the present study was to identify factors which contributed to high rates of mortality from CPA in patients admitted to a Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (P1CU). METHODS: A prospective study was done of all non-surgical patients with CPA who were admitted to the PICU, Hospital Baca Ortiz, Quito Ecuador from January to October 1995. Clinical and laboratory variables before and after admission to the PICU, time from hospital admission to PICU admission and the Pediatric Risk of Mortality score (PRISM) were recorded on a questionnaire designed specifically for this study. RESULTS: Of the 70 non-surgical patients admitted to the PICU, 14 (20%) were admitted after developing CPA on the general pediatric wards. Mean age was 16 + 19.1 months, with 13 of 14 patients under 20 months of age. Initial diagnoses upon PICU admission included meningitis (n=3), respiratory failure (n=2), congenital heart disease (n=2), severe neurological impairment (n=2), end stage neoplastic disease (n=2), hypovolaemic shock (n=l), peritonitis (n=l) and sepsis (n=l). Mean time from hospital admission to P1CU admission was 16 _+ 19.2 hours. The mean PRISM score upon hospital admission was 30+ 13.7 (score > 20 = > 50% mortality). 79% (11/14) of the patients died. One of the three survivors had severe neurologie injury. Prior to PICU admission, patients experienced tac~,cardia (n=9), hypotension (n=8), neurological deterioration (n=8), respiratory, distress (n=7), oliguria (n=5), bradycardia (n=3), metabolic acidosis (n=7), hyponatremia (n=4), hypokalemia (n=2), hypocalcemia (n=2) and severe hypoglycemia (n=2). There were serious delays from the time of development of clinical and laboratory abnormalities to the time of admission to PICU. CONCLUSION: In the critically ill pediatric patient, rapid recognition of clinical and laboratory signs of deterioration, followed by immediate intervention, are required to prevent end stage shock and CPA. We found serious delays in intervention following development of important premonitory clinical and laboratory abnormalities in patients less than 20 months of age on the general pediatric wards, which Iikely contributed to the dismal 79% mortality rate. Hospitals throughout Ecuador should institute immediate improvements in ctinical supervision, and provide training in paediatric advanced life support (PALS) to decrease excessively high rates of and mortality from CPA. intraosscous access is recommended by the American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatries as a means of rapid access to the vascular system for childhood emergencies. Bone marrow and fat embolism is a concern and has been reported post intraosseous infusion in stable animals but has never been studied in animals subjected to cardiopuimonary resuscitation. We undertook this study to investigate the incidence and magnitude of lat and bone marrow embolism with the use of intraosseous infusion during prolonged cardiopuhaonary resuscitation and after fluid and drug infusion. We hypothesized that there will be no difference in the magnitude of fat embolism between cardiopulmonary resuscitation only and other cxperirnental conditions. Thirty-one (31) piglets were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and instrumented (carotid artery, pulmonary artery and intraosseous earmulas ). The animals then underwent bypoxic cardiac arrest followed by chest compressions with the mechanical thumper (Michigan Insmunents) and mechanical ventilation for a minimum of 45 minutes. The animals were divided in groups: A (n=5) which had no intraosseous, ~'oup B (n=6) had intraosscous with no infi~ion, and groups C (n=6), D (n=6), E (n=8) had intraosseous with infusion of adrenaline, normal saline and sodium bicarbonate, At cessation ofcardiopulmonary resuscitation, representative lung samples were collected fi'om upper and lower lobes of each lung, embedded in OCP and firozen immediately. Ltmg specimens were stained using Oil Red-O dye and observed for fat globules and bone marrow elements. The amount of emboli present was rated as a percentage in relationship to Iung tissue, by a pathologist blinded to the experimental groups. Buffy coat specimens were collected before and at cessation of cardiopuimonary resuscitation, stained with Oil Red-O dye and observed for fat globules. Percentage of fat present were compared using analysis of variance.",

Over 10 years, 43 children aged 10 years and less were examined in the emergency department of Hotel-Dieu de France Hospital for carbohydrate ingestion. 62,8% are boys; age goes from 13 months to 6 years (moan = 2,5years). Kerosene is found in 35,8% of cases; all were admitted (mean = 2,8 days). 79,1% were symptomatic on first examination but 93% of all children presented signs of gastric (58%) or respiratory (69,8%) irritation sometime during their history; 37,2% had neurological signs and 41,9% presented some fever. Leucocytosis is found in 65% of cases; 25,6% of the children received antibiotics. Chest X Ray was abnormal in 48,8% of cases: mainly parahilar infiltrates were found, All children survived; 76,7% with a normal course (1,9 days of hospital stay) whereas those who presented complications (severe pneumonia, coma) stayed in the hospital for 6 days (mean) with short course of assisted ventilation for two of them; long term follow up was not possible. We fonnd Nick's criteria for hospital admission to be of value: -symptomatic children with normal X Ray } 6 to 8 hours monitoring -asymptomatie children with X Ray abnormality } -symptomatic children with X Ray abnormality: Hospital admission -asymptomatic children with normal X Ray : no admission. These criteria would have helped to avoid admission in 8 children and would have allowed a short t2 hours stay for 6 more. We found chest X Ray to be mandatory in carbohydrate ingestion; other tests were not helpful, aside arterial blood gases measurement in case of respiratory involvement; we now also advocate more restriction in antibiotic use. Prevention remains efficient and should be stressed on. Severe liver failure [SLF] is a rare but severe condition in infants. We report our experience. Patients: SLF was defined as liver insufficiency with hepatic encephalopathy and a decrease in the level of factor V to below 25 %. Between 1984 and 1996, 29 infants (mean : 4 mo) were admitted for SLF (neonates excluded). Main causes were metabolic disorders (41.3%) (tyrosinemian=5, hemochromatosis n=2, Reye's syndrome n=2, other n=3), virus-induced FLF (20.6%) and hematologic diseases (13.7%). In 4 cases, the causes remained undetermined. Results: OLT was contraindicated in 12 cases because of multiple organ failure (n=10), or underlying disease. All of them died within 6 days after admission. 7 patients had no indications for OLT, all but one are alive. (1 of them was transplanted later for tyrosinemia and 1 died lately (virus induced-SLF). Among the t0 infants who underwent emergency OLT, 6 are alive and 4 died because of primary non function of the graft. Conclusion: SLF in infants admitted before their first birthday is a severe condition with an overall mortality rate reaching 60%. Inherited metabolic disorders are the first cause of SLF at this age. Contraindications for OLT are frequent because of underlying disease or multiple organ failure. A number of children undergo primary graft failure after liver transplantation. It is unknown if there is any increased morbidity or mortality following retransplantation. This study seeks to explore these issues. Methods: A pediatric intensive care/Iiver transplant database is in formation. Records of all liver transplant patients are reviewed and abstracted. This data is then computerized to allow analysis. This data provides the source for this study. Statistical analysis was performed via Student's t-test where appropriate. Results: Of the 350 patients who have thus far received at our center orthotopic liver ransplants, the records of 112 who underwent 140 transplants form the basis for this review. Twenty-three patients underwent multiple transplants, 19 required one additional, three required 3 organs, and one patient survived after a fourth organ transplant, There was no significant difference in age at first transplant between those who received multiple organs and those who did not (40 vs, 44 months, p=NS). The anesthesia time for the procedure did not significantly increase tbr subsequent transplants (8.3 vs, 7,3 hours), nor did time in the intensive care unit (t6.6 vs. 22.2 days), nor did time on the ventilator (8.4 vs. 15.3 days) Subsequent transplants did not predispose to having more bleeding in the intensive care unit for usage of packed red blood cells or platalets was not significantly altered (299 vs 306 ml and 127 vs 207 ml respectively). Patients who required retransplantatior~ did receive mere fresh frozen plasma (FFP)daring their first transplant than in the subsequent ones (275 vs 81 ec, p < 0.05). However FFP use was not significantly different than patients who did not require retransplant.",

Introduction:Fulminant Hepatic Failure (FHF) is a clinical syndrome, defined by the development of hepatic encefalopathy within 8 weeks from onset of illness in a previously healthy person.By far,the most comun cause of pediatric FHF in all series, is acute viral hepatitis.We report our experiences with the pediatric FHF and ortothopic liver transplantation (OLT) as attemative of treatment. Patients:30 childrens with FHF diagnosis were admitted at the PICU from 1/1/1993 to 1/12/1995.Symptomatic treatment was given to all children and all were put on list for OLT,) following the King's College criterion (Protrombina time,age,atiologies,bilirrubin,and encefalopathy state).",

Conclusions:The FHF is a very severe and frequent disease at PICU. Supportive treatment only is associated with a very poor prognosis and high mortality rate.The most frequent etiology in our country is the HAV. The OLT is applicable in this cases and is a valid alternative of treatment (mortality in our series 41%).The ARI is the most frequent complication during the post opeative period.In Argentina,due the high prevalence of HAV,prevention must be considered the main and only way to avoid this catastrophic illness.- To assess the efficacy of gastric intramucosal pH (pHi) for evaluation of tissular perfusion and prediction of hemodynamic complications m critically ill children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty critically ill children (16 boys and 14 girls) whose age ranged from 3 month and 12 years old were studied. A tonometry catheter was placed in the stomach of all patients at their \u00b0admission in Pediatric ICU. Intramucosal pH measures were made at the admission and each 6-12 hours during the study: a total of 202 determinations were made. The catheter was removed after extubation and/or checking of hemodyrmmic stability of the patient. The intramucosal pH was derived from application of the Henderson-Hasselbaeh formula using the pCO2 value from the tonometer and the arterial bicarbonate. Values of pHi between 7.30 and 7.45 were considered normal. The relationship between pHi and severity of patient measured through PRISM, presence of major (cardiorespiratory arrest, shock) and minor (hypotension, hypovolemia or arrhytlmtias) hemodynamic complications, mortality and stay in the PICU, was analysed.",

            "text": "RESULTS: The admission value of pHi was 7.48 -t-0.15 (range 7.04-7.68). Five patients (16%) had an admission pHi < 7.30. No relationship was found between an admission pHi < 7.30 and a higher incidence of hemodynamic complications. Sixteen patients (53%) showed some values of pHi < 730 during their evolution. Patients with pHi < 7.30 had a higher number of hemodynanuc complications than the rest (p< 0.0001). Every cardiorespiratory arrest (CRA) and shock cases were related to a pHi < 7.30. Patients with major complications (CRA and shock) had a pHi lower (p= 0.03), as well as a higher number of measurements of low phi (p= 0.003) than patients with minor hemodynamie complications. The value of pHi lower than 730 presented a 90% of sensibility and 98% of specificity with regard to hemodymanic complications. There was no relationship between pHi < 7.30 and PRIMS score and stay in PICU. Patients with pHi < 7.20 presented a PRIMS higher than the rest of patients (p< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The pHi value may be an early sign of presence of hem0dyaaimc complications in the critically ill child. We tested the hypothesis that Gastric intramural pH (pHi) can be used as an early sign of failure m weaning pediatric patients because the blood flow from nonvital areas is diverted to meet the increased demands of respiratory muscles. METHODS: 24 children (mean age (4.2_+0.3) years + SD) who were thought by their physicians to be weanable from Mechanical ventilation (MV.). These patients were ventilated on Serve 900C ventilators, receiving ranitidine, and had intestinal tonometer (tonometrics, inc.) 60 minutes before obtaining a sample.. All children were placed on pressure support (PS) at levels judged to overcome the resistance of the endotracheal tube and ventilatory circuit (2 em H.,O). A sample of arterial blood and a sample oftonometer were obtained during VM and weaning (PS). pHi, hemodynamic and respiratory data were recorded during VM and weaning We did not interfere with the primary caretaker's decisions regarding extubation. Patients were considered to be successfully weaned if they were able to sustain spontaneous ventilation for more than 24 hours after extubation. Paired t-test were used to compare the values obtained during mechanical ventilation with those obtained during weaning trials. Unpaired ttest were used to compare values from the group that was successfully weaned (A=I5) with those from the group that were not (B=9). RESULTS: We did not find statistical differences in any of those variables mesured during MV for patients who were successfully weaned(group A) and those who were not (group B). Gastric phi was in group A: 7.35 + 0.03 (VM) and 739 + 0.02 (weaning); in group B: 7.40 _+ 0.04 (VM) and 7.4t _+ 0.02 (weaning). DISCUSSION: Although we did not find differences in gastric pHi during VM, the group A had a lower value than group B because of the number of cardiac patients (70%) and transfusion therapy, in fins group. In group B 75% of patients showed a problem in upper airway (subglottic edema, and enlarged tonsils). We found it after extubation. CONCLUSION: 1) Gastric phi is a good predictor of risk in critically ill patients but maybe because of the small size of the sample, in our study is not of practical value as a predictor of failure in weaning pediatric patients from VM. 2) This test is not a predictor of problems in upper airway~ important etiology of failure weaning in children. Objectives: I-To determine the prognostic value of the gastric intramueesal pHi in mortality and multiple organ dysfunction (SDMO) in critically ill children. 2-To compare this value, with the Pediatrics Risk Index Mortality Score (PRIMS). Methods: Aprospective study was performed with 51 critically illcbildren, aged from 1 mouth to 16 years. The athnittiug diagnosis was: 26 post-surgery (13 neurosurgery, 9 spinal fusion and 4 thoracic or abdominal surgery), 7 sepsis, 6 polytraumatism, 5 adult respiratory distress syndrome and 8 with miscellaneous. All the subjects were monitorized on PICU admission and treated for their underlying condition. Gastric intramucnsal pt{ was measured following the tonometric method, ou admission and every 4-8 hours depending on the patients state. The severity of the clinical condition was evaluated using the the PRIMS, on admission (PRIMS-I) and during the first 24 hours, when the clinical condition deteriorate, the worse score was utilized for the statistical analysis (PRIMS-2). To perform the statistical analysis the subjects were divided in two groups, one with the pHi<7.30and the other with pHi>7.30.Aunivariate analysis (Student's tand Wilcoxon two tailed test, chi-square) and multivariate analysis were used. Results: 12 out of the 51 subjects dyed. Of 14 children developing multiorgan failure (MOF) 9 expired. 50% of the patients admitted to the PICU with sepsis, ARDS and miscellaneous had a pHi < 7.30. In contrast, with 27 % of post-surgical and none of the postqraan~atism. The mortaliry rate, in children with a pHi<7.30was 47% (CI 95%:26.16; 69,04) and 11.76% (CI 95%:4,67; 26.62) in children with phi>7.30 (p=0.011). MOFwas observed in41,18% of children withpHi<7.30v.s, 20.6% with phi >7.30.No relatiouship was observed between the pHi and the score of PRIMS-I and 2. Perforating an unconditional logistic regression analysis, two independent variables have mortality predictive value: the phi and the PRISM-2. (Table I) Following induction of anaesthesia, a laser Doppler probe (Moorsoft Instruments Ltd) was inserted 7cm into the patient's rectum, the probe's special design ensuring that the optical prism lay against the mucosa. Continuous monitoring of rectal mucosal perfusion (\"flux\") was continued throughout the operation. After 10 rain CPB at 35\u00b0C, \"steady state\" readings of nasopharyngeal temperature, mean femoral arterial pressure (MAP) and flux were recorded over a further 5 min before CPBinduced core cooling to 14-24\u00b0C. Steady state was defined as a 5 rain period with no change in core temperatures or MAP. Other 5 rain steady state recordings were taken immediately prior to low flow, immediately prior to rewarming and after rewarming to 35\u00b0C, before initiation of any vasoactive drugs. The CPB flow rate was kept at 100 m l k g -1 min q, the PCV at 25_+3%, the P~CO 2 at 5.3+0.5 kPa and the PrO2 at 20+5 kPa. Results:",

The mean cold flux before (152) and after (159) low flow were both significantly lower (p=0.001) than the mean initial warm CPB flux (211). The mean rewarm CPB flux (127) was significantly lower than all other flux values (p=0.001). There were no siglaificant correlations between MAP and flux except at the first warm CPB period (r=0,33, p=0.04). Conclusions: Although hypothermia significantly reduces rectal mucosal perfusion, rewarming produces an even greater reduction in gut perfusion which, considering that mucosal oxygen constmaption is highest during this time, may prove crucial in the postoperative development of MOF. Therapy aimed at improving gut perfusion during CPB should be directed at the rewanning period in particular. ABSTRACT This work is aimed at establishing a clinical procedure for the diagnosis of Enteritis necroticans (EN), even at the communal level, and to define criteria for diagnosis able to distinguish between acute forms. SUBJECTS AND METHOD : 100 cases admitted at the Institute for Protection of Children's Health dPCH), having characteristic symptoms, were examined clinically, by roentgenography of the abdominal cavity, with the analysis of the blood (total protein, electrolytes, hematocrite) and cultures of intestinal fluid and faeces. Through surgical operations, the pathological lesions were observed and recorded. RESULTS: Common epidemiological features: the average age is 6-8 years old (3-15) ; male/female : 1.85; In 70% of the cases, the disease occurred after a meal rich in protides. The acute toxic form accounted for 15% : severe shock appearing early, with very severe dehydration associated with profoundly decreased blood protein concentration and lowered natriemia as well. The lesions of the small intestine were expanded, all of them were necrotic. In the surgical form (20%), the predominant feature was an obstruction -peritonitis syndrome, the peritoneal fluid showed a characteristic inflammatory reaction. For the rest of cases 65% were the internal form, the shock syndrome was less severe, the abdominal distention was light and disappears gradually, the inflammatory reaction of the peritoneal fluid was not so characteristic. CONCLUSION (INO) is a selective pulmonary vesodilator that is rapidly inactivated compared to intravenous vasodilators. These qualities make INO an attractive agent for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension (PItTN). The efficacy of INO has been studied in persistent fetal circulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and congenital heart disease (CHD). Potential adverse effects oflNO include: nitrogen dioxide (NO0 toxicity, methemoglobinemia, and platelet dysfimction. Our objective was to evaluate the safety of INO in pediatric patients (pts). Methods: Pediatric pts. with PHTN from ARDS or CHD were studied under an established, approved protocol conforming to FDA guidelines tbr an investigational new drug. Informed consent was obtained for each child prior to treatment. 1NO was sequentially titratad from 10 parts per million (ppm) to 20, 40, 60, and 80 ppm at ten minute intervals. Parameters monitored before and during therapy included nitric oxide (NO) and NO~ concentrations (cone.), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and percent methemoglobin (MHG). NO and NOz levels were continuously monitored using an inline Dr~ger electrochemical detection device. ~,Litp was continuously measured with an indwelling arterial catheter. MHG was measured by co-oximetry. A MHG level e 5% or NO2 cone. ~ 5 ppm were considered adverse effects by study criteria. Pretreatment MAP was compared to MAP at 40 and 80 ppm INO using paired t-tests. Ap value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Thirty-two mechanically ventilated children with PHTN (16 with ARDS, 16 with CHD) were studied. Five pts. were treated following cardiopulmonary bypass. Methemoglobin (Met-Hb) levels were routinely measured in two prospective clinical studies on NO inhalation in 25 pediatric patients with pulmonary hypertension following heart surgery with extracorporeal circulation and in 19 pediatric and neonatal ARDS patients, The observed differences between the groups prompted in an in vitro study, Red blood cells (RBC) of 20 patients sampled before and after surgery with and without extracorporeal circulation (ECC), respectively, were incubated with 32 ppm NO for 100 rain, Met-Hb, ATP, and NADHt NADPH concentrations were compared, During therapeutic exposure NO increased Met-Hb from 0.2 -2-_ 0.1 to 1.2 _+ 0.7 % in cardiac surgery patients and from 0.2 \u00b1 0,1 to 0.5 \u00b1 0.4 % in ARDS patients (p < 0.01 ). RBC's having undergone ECC were more susceptible to Met-Hb formation (p< 0,001 ) whereas intracellular coenzymes did not differ neither between the groups (table) nor before and after NO exposure. ECC predisposes to increased methemoglobinemia upon exposure to NO both in vivo and in vitro. Our data suggest a reduced activity of Met-Hb reducing enzymes rather than diminished availability of energetic substrates,",

Anne PMC De Jaegere ~, Frans IM Jacobs 2, Nico GC Laheij 2, John N van den Anker t . Dept. of Paediatrics ~, Central instrumentation 2, Sophia Children's Hospital, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Objective: To investigate the homogeneity of nitric oxide (NO) concentration in a delivery system with a continuous flow ventilator. Design: Bench study, Setting: Biomedical laboratory. Interventions: A nitrogen/nitric oxide (NJNO) gas mixture was injected at three different sites in the patient circuit: just before and just behind the humidifier, and 20 centimetres before the Y-connector. Ventilator flow (12, 15, 20 L/rain), ventilator rate (40 to 110, increments of 10) and compliance of the testlung (0.36; 0.5; 1.0 ml/cm H20) were changed. Carbon dioxide (CO2) instead of N2/NO was injected at the same points in the circuit. Measurements and main results: A) Though the flow ratio of the NJNO and the ventilator gas were kept constant, the NO concentration ([NO]) raised with increasing ventilator rates. The increase in [NO] was up to 40% when the N2/NO injection site was close to the Y-connector of the ventilator circuit. Minimal changes in [NO] were noticed when the N~/NO was mixed to the ventilator gas before the humidifier. B) Analysis of the ventilator flow pattern showed variations at different places in the ventilator circuit. The magnitude cf the P, ow change depended on the meas~:rement site. The closer to the expiratory valve the highest the flow change was. The duration of the flow change was inversely proportional to the adjusted ventilator flow. C) Real time measurements of the CO 2 concentration ([COz]) showed variations during tile respiratory cycle. These [CO2] variations were higher when the CO2 gas was blended closer to the Yconnector. Conclusions: The ventilator flow variations in relation to the fixed side flow of the N2/NO gasmixture result in changes of the inhaled [NO] during the respiratory cycle. The NO concentration during inspiration is always higher then during expiration. This could not be detected with the available monitoring system. To ensure a constant [NO] by blending a NJNO gas balance in a continuous flow ventilator, the site of injection should be as close as possible to the inspiratory outlet. Nitric oxide, a potent and selective pulmonary vasodilator, has recently been successfully used to treat pulmonary hypertension of variable etiology in infants and children. Side-effects and complications in infants are so far not well known. We describe here two cases in which prolonged (5 and-7 days respectively) high-dose (50 -80 ppm) nitric oxide was used to treat refractor~\u00a2 pulmonary hypertension. One patient was a newborn infant with pulmonary hypertension secondary to a large leftsided diaphragmatic hernia. Nitric oxide was begun under conventional ventilation (Babylog 8000) at 7 hours of life with a slight initial improvement in oxygenation. He was then placed on oscillation with the same nitric oxide concentration due to worsening respiratory failure. He died on 5th day of life. Monitored nitric dioxide concentration never exceeded 4 ppm. The other patient was a 3 months old infant with severe pulmonary hypertension due to a complete atrioventricular septal defect. He required high-dose nitric oxide to come off cardiopulmonary bypass after surgical repair of his heart defect. He slowly improved over the week following surgery but developped suddenly respiratory failure due to massive pulmonary hemorrhage and died. Surprisingly, a particular autopsy finding in both infants was a massive acute necrotizing tracheobronchitis. We conclude that nitric oxide is an excellent and sometimes lifesaving treatment of pulmonary hypertension in infants. Tracheobronchitis has not yet been reported as a possible complication of nitric oxide administration. We suggest that caution needs to be taken with prolonged high-dose administration and this possible complication to be looked for at autopsy. Introduction: Permissive hypereapnia (PH) is a beneficial strategy for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to minimize barotrauma by decreasing the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP). Hypercapnia and hypoxia cause pulmonary vasoconstriction, pulmonary artery (PA) hypertension, and, thus, an increased afterload to the right ventricle. This increased afterload may result in increased right ventricular (RV) work load and subsequent RV dysfunction. One therapeutic approach is the use of inhaled nitric oxide (iNn), a selective PA vasodilator. The objectives of this study were to test the hypothesis that in a swine model of ARDS with PH, iNn would improve RV work load and not change intrinsic RV contractility.",

Design: Prospecfive~ randomized, controlled study. Setting: University research laboratory. Subjects: Twelve piglets weighing 9 to 13 kg. Interventions: Acute respiratory failure with pulmonary hypertension was induced by repented lung lavages and a continuous infusion of the stable endoperoxane analogue of thromboxane. Thereafter the animals were randomly assigned either for PLV or conventional mechanical ventilation. Initially perfhiorocarbon liquid (30ml/kg) was instilled into the endotracheal tube over 5 min followed by 5-10ml/kg~. All animals were treated with different concentrations of NO ( 1-10-20 ppm) inhaled in random order. Measurements and results: Continuous monitoring included ECG, CVP, MPAP, MAP, San2 and SvO2 measurements. During PLV PaO2/FiO2 increased significantly from 62_+3.2 mmHg to 193\u00b144 mmHg (p<0.01) within 10 rain, while PaO2]FiO2 remained constant at 61 -+3.3mmHg. Qs/Qt decreased significantly from 48-+4% to 25-+5% (p<0.01) during PLV and did not change during conventional mechanical ventilation. Static pulmonary compliance (Cstat) increased significantly ff~m 0.4R\u00b10.07 to 0.75_+0.03 ml/cmH20/kg (p<0.01) during PLV and decreased slightly from 0.58_+0.08 to 0.46e0.04 ml/cmH20/kg during conventional mechanical ventilation. The infusion of the endoperoxane analogue resulted in a sudden decrease of PaO2/FiO2 from 262_+44 to 106_+8.0 mmHg in the PLV group and from 71\u00b17 to 52+_2.0 mmHg in the control group. Inhaled NO significandy improved oxygenation in both groups (PaO2/FiO2:344_+38 mmHg during PLV and 196+_.56 mmHg during conventional mechanical ventilation). During inhalation of NO MPAP decreased significantly from 57-+2 m 35\u00b12 mmHg (p<0.01) in both groups. There was no significant change in oxygenation and MPAP during inhalation of 1 and 20 ppm NO. Conclusions : PLV significantly improves oxygenation and pulmonary compliance in acute respiratory failure. The additional application of inhaled NO further improves oxygenation and pulmonary hemodynamics when acute respiratory failure is associated with severe pulmonary hypertension. Inhaled NO is very effective in improving oxygenation and pulmonary blood flow even at low doses. The work was supported in part by grants of the Austrian Nationalbank Nr 5545. As in neonates, severe respiratory failure in infants and children can be aggravated by pulmonary hypertension, resulting in further deterioration of oxygenation due to increasing intrapulmonary shunting. We analysed the influence of inhalational nitric oxide (iNO) in treatment, course and outcome of severe ARDS in a pediatric population. Since 1993 20 infants and children (age: 1-107 months) with ARDS and OI > 15 (mean value: 32.5\u00b1 11) underwent a trial with iNO (concentration: 3, 10, 30, 60 and 100 ppm) to prevent further respiratory failure. 11 patients had a significant improvement of their oxygenation (rise of pa09 > 15 mm Hg) for at least 24 hours (responders); mean best ~fficient NO dose: 24.6 ppm. The non-responders had only a short-term improvement or iNO had no effect. In responders and nonresponders there was no significant difference with regard to age, underlying disease, ARDS severity, time on mechanical ventilation, blood gases and ventilator settings before NOtrial, nor was there a different grade of pulmonary hypertension (estimated by echocardiography). The only difference was an higher Ol in the group of the non-responders: 40.9 \u00b1 9.I vs. 25.6 ~ 6.7, p < 0.002. In the group of the 11 respenders there was a secondary deterioration of lung function after I -6 days on iNO in 5 children (transient responders): in these patients, as well as in the group of the non-responders, alternative modalities of treatment (HFOV and/or ECMO) became necessary. 6 children (30 %) died: 2 transient respenders and 4 non-responders. In infants and children with ARDS due to different underlying diseases iNO can acutely lead to a significant improvement of oxygenation in about 50 % of the cases. The right selection of patients for NO therapy and the influence of iNO on the survival rate of ARDS in childhood has to be evaluated in further studies. and Pediatric Cardiology, University of Graz, A-8036 Graz Purpose: After Fontan procedure cardiac output is critically dependent on the pulmonary vascular resistance. Even minor elevations of the pulmonary vascular resistance may significantly decrease cardiac output. Inhaled NO is an effective, selective pulmonary vasodilator in experimental and clinical situations of pulmonary hypertension. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of inhaled NO on oxygenation and pulmonm 3, circulation in children after a bidirectional Glenn-anastomosis (n-~) or a Fontan-like operation (n=9). Material and methods: From June t993 to January 1996 13 children with a mean age of 7.1+~2.1 (SEM) yrs and a mean body weight of 24.3-+5.8 (SEM) kg were treated with inhaled NO after Glenn-or Fontan-like operations. All but one had complex cardiac malformations with single ventricle. All children were mechanically ventilated with an Fin2 >0.75. Inhaled (NO) was applied using a rrdcrdproeessor based system which additionally allowed measurement of NO/NOx using the chemihimniscence method. Methemogtobin concentrations were determined 3 times a day. The major indication for postoperative inhalation of NO was a high (>10mmHg) transpulmonary pressure gradient (TPG--CVP-LAP). Severe myocardial dysfunction of the single ventricle was excluded by echocardiography. Results: The mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 8.1_+2.2 (SEM) days The. mean dose of inhaled NO was 4.4-+0.8 (SEM) ppm, the mean duration of NO-inhalation was 106_+19 (SEM) hours. The mean methemoglobin concentration was 1.2-+0.2 (SEM)%. Hemodynamic data and arterial oxygen saturation before inhaling NO and 15 minutes later are given in Table 1 Acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF) in children occurs in a heterogenous group of diseases with pulmonary pathophysiological processes ranging from reversible physiological intrapulmonary shunting to fixed structural lung damage. We hypothesized that inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), a selective pulmonary vasodilator, might identify those patients with potentially reversible disease, i,e, large response may indicate a greater likelihood ef reversibility and thus survival.",

Tltree out of 6 ECMO patients eventually survived. Conclusions: m our study low-dose of irthaled NO showed a variable effect on oxygenation in newborns with acute respiratory failure. An acute response to NO appeared to be correlated with a better short-term outcome and the avoidance of extracorporeal support in Ecmo candidates. Differently, lack of acute and/or sustained response was associated with death or need for ECMO. Although the nature and severity of the underlying disease or the degree of prematurity may play an important role in these patients, we believe lack of acute response to NO may be an early predictor of bad outcome, prompting toward alternative treatments such as ECMO or liquid ventilation. *Picea S., \u00b0Bartuli A.,\u00b0Dionisi-Vici C., *Dello Strologo L., \u00a7Villani A., \u00a7Bianchi R., ^Salvatori G.,*Rizzoni G, \u00b0Sabetta G. *Div. of Nephrology, \u00b0Div. of Metabolism, \u00a7Intensive Care Unit, ^Div. of Neonatology. \"Bambino Gesfl\" Children Research Hospital. ROME, Italy. Successful prevention of handicaps or death in newborns with ~ depends on rapidity and efficiency of treatment. Poor response to nutritional and/or pharmacological treatment requires extracorporeal removal of NH4. Efficiency and cardiovascular tolerance are often difficult to obtain with peritoneal or hemodialysis in neonates. We report the results of CAVHD in 3 newborns with HC. Methods: vascular access: femoral vessels. Blood flow: 10-35 ml/min, Dialysate flow: 200-500 ml/h. Filter: Amicon Minifilter PlusrM(polysulfone membrane; 0.08 sq.m.). No ultrafiltrate(UF) production, Patients: Case 1 with carbamoytphosphate synthetase deficiency (body weight -bw-: 3.2 kg) showed HC at day 4, A relapse of HC occurred at day 14 due to an infectious event. Case 2 and 3 (bw: 3.0 and 2.8 kg), both affected by propionic aeidemia, showed HC at day 5 and day 7, respectively. Plasma NH4 (~tg/dl) decrease is shown in the Complications: transitory ischemia of arterial cannulation limb and transitory thrombocytopenia occurred in case 1; surgical repairing of artery after CAVt-ID was necessary in case 3; no cardiovascular instability was observed during CAVHD . Outcome,'all patients recovered from HC in less than 1 day: case 1: alive, mild b)Iootonia at 34 mos; case 2: dead after 10 days from CAVHD withdrawal for pulmonary hemorrhage; case 3: alive, normal development at 7 mos. Conclusions: 1) In newborns with HC, CA~q-ID provides good cardiovascular tolerance,high efficiency and quick removal of NH4, even without UF production (i.e. only by diffusion). This allows easier management (no need of fluid and electrolyte balance). 2) Arterial complications seem frequent in neonates treated by CAVHD. Venovenous circulation could overcome this problem.",

Results. Neither diarrhoea or its duration, nor children's age, nor blood nitrogen level, nor anuria or dialysis time had any predictive value for the disease evolution in the acute phase of our patients. Adversely, extra-nenal involvements was accompanied by severe and complicated courses of the disease (p<0,02). The elevation of white cells and PMNs (heyon 20 x 109/i) and PMNs (more than 15 x 109/1) as well as its persistence beyon a week were most frequently observed in complicated forms (p<0,001, p<0,001 and p<0,01, respectively).

Purpose of this study was to evaluate whether this causes a different postoperative gastric mucosal pH (pHi). Methods: We evaluated a series of 35 patients, who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (age: 5 days to 16 years (mean 2,2 yrs), weight: 3.2 to 37kg (mean 10.2 kg). A commercially available tonometer (Tonometics\u00ae) for sigmoidal use in adults was inserted into the stomach after induction of anesthesia. The pHi measurements were done according to manufacturer recommendations We compared three groups of patients: 1) aeyanotic (n=20), among them 9 P with VSD and 5 P with AVSD; 2) cyanotic (n=10): TOF: 6P, TGA: 4P; 3) cyanotic after a Fontan-type procedure (n=5). Phi were measured at PICU arrival and after 6h. Fudhermore we compared lactat levels at these time points. Differences between the groups were evaluated with one way ANOVA on ranks with pairwaise multiple comparisons (Dunn's method). The relationship between CVP and pHi was investigated by regression analysis. Results: The median pHi for groups I, 2 and 3 were 7.28, 7.27 and 7.13 at ardval and 7.30, 7.25 and 7.21 after 6h respectively. At PICU arrival group 3 was significantly (p<0.05) different from groups 1 and 2. There was no significant difference between the latter two groups, After 6h group 1 was different from group 3, there were no other significant differences. The median lactate levels for groups t, 2 and 3 were 2.2, 3,2 and 4.1 at ardval and 1.6, 3.1 and 3.3 after 6h respectively. At PtCU arrival group 3 was significantly (p<0.05) different from group 1, after 6h there were no significant differences. There was a weak negative correlation between cvp and pHi: r= -0.21; p<0.05. Conclusion: Patients after a Fontan-type of procedure have lower pHi than patients after other cardiac surgical procedures, However, this is only in part due to the elevated cvp and venous congestion. Eleven children were investigated 32 months (median) after postoperative MOF. IVIOF was defined as the failure of at least two vital organ systems (kidney, liver, lung, central nervous system) in addition to cardiac insufficiency and high fever. Underlying surgical procedure was repair of Tetralogy of Fallot (n=3), Fontan-(n=7) or Seuning procedure (n=l). All patients fulfilled criteria for MOF in the 3 first postoperative (PO) days. Six patients needed peritoneal or hemodialysis for 31 days (median) during the PO period. One patient showed cerebral infarction due to thromboembolism in the territory of the right internal carotid artery immediately after the operation. The follow-up protocol consisted of extensive investigations of heart-, renalliver-, and lung functions as well as complete neurological and psychological examinations.

Aim of the study: The finding of elevated TSH and decreased T4 in the newborn usually is classified as \"transient hypothyroidism\", thus the elevation of TSH is classified as consequence of the lowered T4. But on the other hand several data sets show that TSH elevation as well as low T4, one independently of the other one, are associated with different kinds of perinatal stress. Each of these laboratory deviations, if not associated with the other value being abnormal too, is generally accepted not to be an indication for treatment. From this we conclude, that more pefinatal stress, as in intensive care neonates, may produce TSH elevation as well as low T4, but only coincidentially, not the TSH elevation being the consequence of low T4, thus not to be classified as \"hypothyroidism\", thus not indicating treatment. If this hypothesis is right, we should find an association of increasing pefinatal stress with an increasing number of neonates from TSH and T4 normal via TSH or T4 abnormal to high TSH and low T4. Method: In the newborn screening program in Germa W we determine primarily TSH, and only in the neonates with elevated TSH, in addition we determine T4. Thus in our study we asked whether we find an association of increasing perinatal stress with an increasing number of neonates from TSH normal via TSH abnormal while T4 normal to high TSH and low T4. Definitions for this study were: TSH elevation = >20 mU/1 (as usual in the German screening programs), T4 lowered = < 6 p_g/dL Perinatal stress score was 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 in dependency of the neonate having stress in none to all of the following three categories: (a) forceps or vacuum extraction or sectio Co) birth weight below 2500 g (c) at the 5th day existence of a relevant neonatal disorder (RDS, ictems gravis, infection/sepsis, vitium cordis with hemodynamic relevance, severe malformation). Results: Our data of 1131 neonates show a high significant association (chi2 = 84, p <0.001) of, on one hand, perinatal stress score 0 with normal TSH, versus, on the other hand, perinatal stress score 2 or 3 with high TSH and low T4. Discussion: Facing the background given above, in the intensive care newborn, the constellation of high TSH and low T4 may be only a coincidential addition of two independent abnormalities. In tbese cases -the high TSH not being the consequence of low T4 -the classification as \"hypothyroidism\" is not justified, thus a therapy not indicated. On the other hand of course there exist rare cases with high TSH as consequence of low T4 thus with hypothyroidism tlms with indication for therapy. Unfortunately we have no criteria, that enable a certain discrimination of these two categories thus in respect to the question of therapy or not. Conclusion: Further research has to be done to learn how to discriminate the coincidential high TSH and low T4 from the causal constellation of high TSH and low T4. Until we have certain discrimination criteria we have to treat both groups of neonates. Few studies have focused on FA composition of surfactant PC in preterm infants before and after surfactant therapy. Methods: Tracheal aspirates were collected in 7 venttlated mfants from birth until extubatlon (27/7_1 /TWk GA, 859.+ 155g BW). After lipid extraction, t.l.c,, and methylation, FAs of PC were quantified by gaschromatography. Intralipid a (53.2 % linoleic acid,18:2\u20226) was started 48h after birth. Results: Six infants developed respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and received Survanta R i00mg/kg (SR), all doses within 18h after birth (Ix S R n=l, 2x S r~ n=3, 3x S R n=2). One child did not develop RDS. In alt patients, the patmitate % in PC was ~ 65% (before Sr<=natural composition), increased to ~ 85% after S R, and remained >80% for i5h after lx S a, 22.3.+I1.8h after 2x, and 38.5.+3.3h after 3 doses. In 4 patients, intubated long enough, the palmitate % decreased with a half-life of 78.7_+42.8h to a new plateau which was still higher than baseline after 1 week. Linoleic acid % was 5.85_+2.3 (with RDS), decreased after S r~ and returned to baseline due to the decrease in patmitate %. Thereafter the linoleic acid % increased linearly with 0.021% per h, in 1 patient even up to 15.1%. Other FAs did not increase after return to baseline. In neonatal medicine the current parameters, arterial oxygen saturation and arterial oxygen pressure, are poor indicators for oxygen delivery and oxygen demand. The purpose of this study was to obtain venous blood samples from the inferior vena cava in stable neonates with respiratory failure and to determine a parameter that reflects more adequately the balance between oxygen delivery and oxygen demand.",

Objective: to compare a method of teicoplanine (Teico) infusion using an electrical syringe-pump with a manual injection. Methods: infusion of Teico was simulated through a standart neonatal I.V. system. The infusion system consisted of an Life Care 4 infusion pump (ABBO'IT Lab.) with its i.v. set for maintenance intravenous fluid (flow < 6 mi/h) connected to a 3-way stopcock. An 1 meter extension tubing (VYGON Lab.) was placed between the stopcock and a neonatal catheter, An another 1 meter tubing (injection tubing) was connected to the stopcock. The volume of the injection circuit was 2.6 ml. Simulations were realised for 2 weights (1 or 3 kg), with a doses of 8 mg/kg and a injected volume of 0,8 ml to 3 ml. Our goal was to perform a complete infusion in 10 minutes. We compare one method of infusion with an electrical syringe-pump with 2 manual methods: A: Teico was infused with a syringe-pump Pilot C (Becton & Dickinson Lab.) according to a protocol using 1) a priming before connecting the syringe to the tubing (for immediate starting of infusion), 2) a programmed volume injected in 5 minutes (the drug volume was greater than the dose prescribed to avoid loss of Teico into the syringe), 3) a 5 ml wash out was performed over 5 minutes with the syringe pump. B: Teico was manually injected in a few seconds in the tubing followed by a 5 ml wash out over 10 minutes. C: idem as B but a Nu Site valve (Medex) was connected to the proximal end of injection tubing to avoid leakage between removal of the Teico syringe and connection of the wash out syringe. During each run, serial samples were collected every ten minutes over a one hour period. The samples were assessed using HPLC method. Results: the amount of drug delivred at 10 minutes was calculated and expressed as a perventage of the total amount of Teico prescribed. Results are a mean of 5 to 8 rons.",

INTRODUCTION Bacterial meningitis is a common cause of admission in the paediatric age group, and one which still carries a high morbidity and mortality. These complications are strongly associated with a delay in antibacterial therapy. A significant proportion of these patients require mechanical ventilation; it is in this particular group of patients that survival is greatly diminished. The identification of risk factors for mechanical ventilation associated with bacterial meninges may help improving survival by shortening the delay to ICU referral. The Paediatdc Risk of Mortality Score (PRISM) is the most widely used scoring system in the paediatric ICU literature; the accuracy of PRISM on predicting outcome in meningitis has been shown to be poor. AIM We aimed to describe our population of patients with bacterial meningitis requiring ventilation, and then to identify predictors of survival. METHODS This study was conducted at the Baragwanath Hospital in South Africa which is an Universityaffiliated institution with end average annual paediathc admission of 4500 patients. Baragwanath ICU admits 250 non-neonatal paediatdc patients per year. A retrospective chart review from January 1991 to December 1995 of 42 consecutive paedistdc ICU admissions with bacterial meningitis was performed. RESULTS Approximately 150 cases of bacterial meningitis are admitted to the general paediatric wards every year; this constitutes \u00b1 3% of all admissions. The mortality of these patients is + 14%. During this time 42 (23M, 19F) patients (7%) were accepted for ICU admission, with a mortality of 42.2%. The median age was 9 months (range 15 days to 17 years). The median delay to hospital admission was 48 hours, and the median delay to ICU admission was a further 4 hours. The median duration of tCU stay was 48 hours (40 for non-survivors, 120 for survivors). The main presenting features were convulsions (34%), altered mental state (40%), fever (50%), respiratory symptoms (24%), headache (18%), and diarrhoea and vomiting (32%). The most common indications for ICU admission were seizures (55%), coma (36%), shock (26%), respiratory failure (29%) and acidosis (21%). In 29% of patients there was a cardiorespirstory arrest prior to admission. The most common organisms in the CSF was pneumococcus (57%), haemophilus influenza (15%) and E coli (12%). The presence of leucopenia (WCC < 5), a low platelat count (<100), acidaemia (pH<7.2), and the need for inotropic support were strongly associated with nonsurvival. Tachycardia and hypotension were not significantly essorJsted with poor outcome, as has been previously reported. DISCUSSION Early diagnosis of meningitis and prompt institution of antibiotic therapy requires a high level of clinical suspicion. Paediatric patients with bacterial meningitis that require mechanical ventilation have a poor prognosis. There is little evidence to suggest that nomsurviva[ can be predicted prior to ICU admission, but a rapid deterioration requiring ventilation and inotrepic support with evidence of severe sepsis (low platelet count, leucopenia) is Nmost invariably associated with a fatal outcome. The long term functional outcome of these patients make this disease even more devastating; the rote of ICU in the management of these patients has yet to be fully estaNished. Objective and study design: A retrospective study was pertbrmed for all patients diagnosed with hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome (HSE) during 1984 to 1994. Soroka Medical Center is the only medical facility in the southern Negev region of Israel serving a population of -400,000 residents, consisting primarily of Jews and Bedouins.",

Approximately 10% of hospitalised infants with respiratory syaacytial virus (RSV) infection require mechanical ventilation. Our general practice is not to use specific antiviral therapy. We have undertaken studies of RSV-infected mechanically ventilated patients without underlying congenital heart disease or immunodeficiency. Study I (n=45): A retrospective review of 45 infants (mean post-conceptual age 48 weeks; median duration of intubation was 8 days (interquartile range 5-11 ). Blinded review of chest x-rays during the first three days of mechanical ventilation revealed a spectrmn of lower respiratory tract findings from marked diffiase consolidation in all zones without hyper-inflation (n=10) to gross hyperinfiation without consolidation (n=5), with the remaining patients have an intermediate picture (n=30). Death occurred only in patients who were at the poles of this continuum (4/10 consolidation and 1/5 hyperinflation).

Mature infants (>-35 weeks gestation and birthweight 2 2 kg) with severe cardiopulmonary failure have been randomized to receive continued care in their referring institution or referral to a designated ECMO centre for further management. We now present the preliminary results which have prompted closure of recruitment to this trial. The final outcome will be assessed as intact survival against death or severe disability at one year of age for all the recruited patients. Patients were categorised by diagnosis such as isolated persistent fetal circulation, secondary persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn or congenital diaphragmatic hernia and by severity of illness at the point of first contact with the clinical coordinators of the trial -judged primarily by the oxygenation index (240 before randomization). 180 patients were randomized (90 in each arm). Hospital outcome data are reported for all patients and 1 year outcomes on t18 (65 survivors). At this stage 26 of the babies allocated to ECMO are known to have died compared to 52 of those allocated to conventional management (RR 0.5; 95% CI 0.35-0.72; P=0.0002). Fewer deaths have been obsea-ved amongst ECMO allocated babies in all the diagnostic categories used. A 28% incidence of disability and impah~nent has been observed amongst survivors. This rate is similar in both groups and the survival advantage is not offset by an increased rate of disability or impairment following allocation to ECMO. We consider that these data combined with those available from other studies provide conclusive evidence that the survival to discharge from hospital is substantially higher in patients allocated to ECMO than in comparable infants not so allocated. Therefore recruitment to this trial has been closed whist awaiting complete one year outcome data.",

Lung mechanics were measured in 35 term infants, mean age 1.5 +_ 0.7 days who were paralysed and ventilated within the first three days of life. Fourteen infants had PPHN with systemic or suprasystemic PAP measured by echocardiography. In these patients, the respiratory system resistance was 29.4% higher (p < 0.001) and compliance 22.4 % lower (p = 0.03) during systemic or suprasystemic PAP compared to when the pulmonary hypertension had resolved. In contrast, there were no changes in resistance in the 14 infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and no pulmonary hypertension or in the seven infants with normal lungs, where two readings were taken 24 hours apart. The changes in lung mechanics interfered with mechanical ventilation, resulting in a 12.5 mmHg rise in PaCO2 (p=0.007) during pulmonary hypertension. Inhalation of nitric oxide 10 PPM resulted in a 16% decrease in respiratory system resistance and an improvement in oxygenation. The bronchial and vascular smooth muscle was increased by 120% in postmortem lung samples from eight infants with PPHN compared to six age matched post-mortem controls with normal lungs (p<0.001). These findings suggest a co-constriction and co-hypertrophy of bronchial and vascular smooth muscle during PPHN. Anatomically the pulmonary vasculature and bronchi lie in close proximity to each other. Thus mediators such as Endothelin-1 released locally may act on both vascular and bronchial smooth muscle to produce the observed vasoconstriction, bronchoconstriction and smooth muscle hypertrophy.",

            "text": "INTRODUCTION An increasing mortality in asthmatic children has been reported. The increased severity of asthmatic illness leads to an increased demand for ICU admission, and a corresponding increased need for mechanical ventilation. Geographic end environmental factors are thought to be partly responsible for differences in disease sevedty throughout the wodd. For this reason, epidemiological studies from diverse areas are important, Risk factors for ICU admission, and for the institution of mechanical ventilation should be identified, to optimise ICU admission criteria and to avoid unnecessary delays in admitting at-risk patients. AIM To document the clinical characteristics of ventilated and non-ventilated asthmatic patients admitted to ICU. METHODS This is a retrospective study of all paediatric asthma ICU admissions from January 1990 to December 1995. RESULTS There were 65 patients admitted to the ICU for acute severe asthma in the study period. The male:female ratio was 33:32, the mean age 76.1 \u2022 57.3 months, the mean PRISM 8.5 4-11.1%, and the mean duration of admission 135 4. 129 hours. There was no seasonal variation in admissions. Only 40% (26/65) patients required mechanical ventilation. In 22% of all patients this was the first presentation with asthma. There were some significant differences between ventilated and non-ventilated patients (see Table) . There was a significantly higher incidence of concomitant and nosocomial pneumonias in the ventilated patients (84.0% vs 21.1%) as well as segmental lung collapse (68.0% vs 26.3%). There were no deaths. DISCUSSION The need of mechanical ventilation significantly increases the morbidity of and duration of ICU stay of asthmatic patients. Younger asthmatic paediatdc patients have a significantly higher risk of ventilation. The need for ventilation is predicted principally from a worsening pCO2 and respiratory acidaemia, which is often independently interpreted by the clinician as respira4ory exhaustion. This study has shown that ICU admission is important in the management of young paediatdc patients with acute severe asthma and respiratgry fa!!ure. ",

This double blinded study was conducted in the Emergency department of Westmead Hospital a university hospital in Sydney, Australia. All children with severe asthma had initial nebuliser therapy (5rag of salbutamol with 4mL of saline). If asthma remained severe 20 minutes later, they were given a dose of intravenous hydrocortisone (5mg/kg) and either normal saline or salbutamol 15microgm/kg intravenously. Frequent nebulised salbutamoi therapy continued during the initial first hour if clinically indicated. Continuous respiratory and haemodynamic monitoring occurred in the first 2 hours. Serum potassium and glucose determinations were made at study commencement and 1 hour after intravenous therapy. Salbutamol determination was made at study commencement. Children remained clinically monitored for the next 22 hours, with their ongoing treatment determined by clinical response. 29 children with severe asthma 12 months to 12 years of age were studied, with 14 given intravenous salbutamol and 15 given intravenous saline. The intravenous satbutamol group (IVSG) showed rapid reduction in asthma severity scale in the first 2 hours, with reduced need for high frequency nebuliser therapy ( _<2 hourly), occurring 8.78 hours.earlier. No clinically significant side-effects were found in either group, although, tremor more frequent in the [VSG. Biochemistry and salbutamol concentrations were similar in both groups.

These diseases have several causes, but most of them (especially asthma and chronic airway disease) have a good response to the administration of B2-adrenergic drugs. Objective: To find the dosis of intravenous terbutaline that is safe, efficient and with minimal adverse effects when used in children admitted to a PICU with acute obstructive lower airway disease and respiratory failure. Material and Methods: We study the records of all children that were admitted to our PICU during the winter of 1995. Only the patients that had respiratory failure and acute lower airway disease and who needed the use of IV terbutaline were selected. The records were divided in two groups: less than 12 months and more than a year old These two groups were compared in the following aspects: the minimal and maximal dosis, and the length of time of use of IV terbutaline, frequency of tachycardia, hypokalemia, and mechanical ventilation. To establish any difference in the two groups we use the T exact test of Fisher and X2, with p< 0.05, Results: During the period of study were admitted 367 patients to the PICU, and 38 (10,3%) of them used of iv terbutaline. The mean age was 14.2 +12.2 month, used iv terbutaline during 7.24 +3.75 days (0.5 to 17 days), the initial rate was 0.55 +0.26p~g/kg/min, and the means of therapeutic dosis was 2.48 +l.181~g/kg/min (ranged from 0.5 to 4.4). Twelve (31.5%) patients had tachycardia art obstacle to the increases in the rate of use of iv terbutaline during any time. Mechanical ventilation was necessary in 22 patients (57.8%) and 11 (28.9%) patients died. The children under 1 year of age used initial dosis of iv terbutaline lower than the children up of 1 year old (0.45 p.g/ kghnin x 0.57 ~tg &g/rain, p<0.001), but without difference in the length of use, the maximal dosis, the rate of mechanical ventilation and tachycardia. The frequency of hypokalemia was most common in the group of children under year of age. Acute respiratory failure during status asthmaticus may require mechanical ventilation. Current therapy includes paralysis, pressure control ventilation (PCV) and permissive hypercapnia to limit pulmonary barotranma and its hemodynamic consequences. Asthmatic children exert a significant amount of respiratory effort during exhalation. With paralysis, this expiratory effort is lost. Unloading the inspiratory work of breathing while maintaining the patient's expiratory eftbrt using pressure support ventilation (PSV), may be beneficial.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Continuous ketamine infusion to mechanically ventilated pediatric patients with refractory broncliospasm results in a significant improvement in oxygenation and dynamic compliance of the chest. Reports of adults with status nsthraaticus document significant morbidity and mortality, whereas studies in children have had more varied results. Different centers report mechanical ventilation (MV) in 10 to 33% of admissions, occurrence of pneumothoraces or paeutuomediastinums in 2 to 11%, and mortality in up to 7% of patients ~'t3. We retrospectively reviewed 113 status asthmaticus admissions to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) between January 1993 and December 1995. Seventy-five of these patients were admitted fr~an the emergency department of CHLA (ER Admit). The mean length of stay in the PICU was 2.1 days and the mean length of stay in the hospital was 4.6 days. Based on 95 patients who had arterial blood analyses, 36 patients had hyperoapnia (pCO2 > 45). All patients received oxygen, inhaled albuterol (Alb), and cortieosteroid therapy. Ninety-five percent of patients also received methylxanthine (MX) therapy. Of the 113 admissions, 12 patients (11%) required MV. Only 4 of these patients were admitted through our emergency department, whereas the remaining 8 patients were intuhated at outside facilities. Twenty-three cases required intr:wenous beta-agonist therapy, either isoproterenol Osop) or terbutaline (Terb). H~ff of the ea.~es re~%wed were complicated with hypokalemia (K+< 3.5). C,', ,~lications ofpoeumothoraces or pneumomediastinums were seen in 10% of ,'r:u~ported patients, but in only 4% of ER Admit patients. Only 2% of these were in mechanic.all, )atients. There were no deaths in the review. Respiratory mechanics measurements 'are useful in mechanically ventilated children to optimize ventilator settings. Nevertheless, the transducers used to measure flow (F) and pressure (P) remain expensive. Objective. To evaluate the performances of piezoelectric P transducers (350 US Dollar) in measuring F and P. Methods. We used a previously described monitoring system measuring respiratory parameters [ 1] . In this study F was obtained by a differential piezoelectric P transducer (_+ 12.7 cmI-I20, Honeywell) whose sensitivity has been reduced to +_ 2 cmH20 by an electronic amplification equipment and P by a piezoelectric P transducer (_+ 7().3 cmHzO, Honeywell) connected to a grid pneumotachymeter &NT) ffleisch 0 or 1 ). Volume (V) (5 to 400 ml) obtained by numeric integration ofF (0.125 to 10 L/rnin ) and P (2 to 70 cmH20) were respectively delivered through a calibrated seringe and an electronical manometer (Pic 400 Premier) and calculated by the computer. Bland and Altman analysis was used for assessment of results bias. Coefficient of repeatability (CR) was estimated by the standard deviation of repeated measurements of the parameters as calculated in a oneway analysis of variance. Results. Mean difference (Mdi 0 between injected V (5 to 50 ml) and measured V using PNT 0 was 0.15 ml, SD = 0.13 ml. Difference and mean V were not correlated. SD of repeated V measurements were not correlated to V. CR was 0.4 ml. Mdif between injected V (25 to 400 ml) and measured V using PNT 1 was 3 lrd, SD = 6 mL SD of repeated V measurements were not correlated to mean V. CR was 6 ml. Mdif between injected P and measured P was 0.3 cmI-I20, SD 0.4 cm H20 SD of repeated P measurements were not correlated to mean P. CR was 0.3 cmH20. Conclusion. Inexpensive piezoelectrical transducers can be used to measure F and P and evaluate respiratory mechanics in ventilated children. Previous studies have already shown the problem of the reproducibility of PFT in preterm ventilated babies. Were studied 10 preterm ventilated babies {mean weight 1128 gr) in the first week of life in clinically stable condition, measuring flow, airway pressure and esophageal pressure simultaneously. Each baby was studied twice with an interval of one hour and each study was done increasing the rate till 60 to inhibit spontaneous breaths. None sedative has been used. Only mechanical breaths were analyzed. Compliance and resistence were calculated with a computer system using the linear regression method. We expressed quantitatively the intrapatient variability as the percentage of variation of tidal volume, compliance and resistence between the two studies in each baby. Then Intraclass correlation coefficient test (ICC) was applied to confirm qualitatively our results (total agreement =1, good reproducibJtity > 0.75). We h~\u00a3ed, an a6Eept~ble ~Efiabirl\u00a2, ~-~r;= '~ . During mechanical ventilation, an air leak (AL) and plateau phase duration (PL) may influence dynamic and static compliance (Cdy and Cst, respectively). This study evaluated the effect of AL and PL on two methods of measuring C.dy and est. Methods. 13 intubated, ventilated patients in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit were evaluated after obtaining Informed consent. Patients were intuhated with a cuffed endotracheal tube and ventilated with a Serve 900(2 ventilator. Cdy and Cst were determined using the Serve andS~rMedics 2600. Objective: evaluate the repercussion in respiratory mechanics and arterial blood gases and the impact of the ventilator adjustments on the auto-PEEP magnitude. Material and Methods: the measurement of the auto-PEEP was performed using an eletronic-pneumatic controlled device with a oclasion valve installed between endotracheal canutla and the ventilator circuit. The d~'ice was connected to a solenoid to detecte the end of inspiratuo phase and thus, the activation of the oclusion valve. The signs of pressure and flow were monitorized using a diferential transducer and it was processed using a PC computer and tMeumoview\u00ae software. The stud3 were divided in 2 phases: phase A. where the ventilator adjustments was performed using the routine of the unit and phase B, where the targets of mechanical ventilation were to minimize the auto-PEEP. Static compliance (Crs) was ineasured by the single-breath occlusion technique, using a mean of ten occlusions for analysis. Passive respiratory resistance measurements and the tidal breathing flow-volume loops were also obtained., while the ventilatory settings were siguificantly reduced soon atier ECMO was started. Before ECMO Crs measured in all patienls was 0.23_+t).03 ml/cmH20/kg (mean_+SEM). For each patient the ECMO course was divided into four periods, proportional to the duration of the treatment, and the best ~alue of Crs in each period was chosen for analysis. As shown on the figure. Crs significantly improved (*p<0,05) from the second half of the ECMO course in the group of patient that finally were successfidly weaned from ECMO. No change ill compliance was measured in the group of patients who failed to respond to the extracorporeal hmg support Our data suggest that compliance measurements during ECMO can be useful togelher with overall clinical evaluation to predict both outcome and duration of cxtracorporeaI support in the neonatal and pediatric population. Objectives: Brain temperature determines the amount of neuronal damage caused by hypoxic insults. Thus measuring brain temperature at standardised conditions is in request. We investigated whether brain temperature of neonates varies with head insulation environmental temperature, body activity and time course. Patients and Methods: We investigated non-invasive brain temperature analogues in 19 healthy prematures tess than two weeks of age in an incubator (gestational age 31.5 + 2.1 wks; x + SD, weight 1653 + 370 g). We measured nasopharyngeal temperature (Tnasoph) by a thermistor placed in the nasopharynx via a feeding tube, zero-Heatflux Temperature (zHT) at the temple by a thermistor and healflux transducer, insulated by two pads, as well as rectal and incubator temperatures. Patient activity was documented by video taping. Measurements were performed during periods of increased insulation 1) by turning the head with its measuring site on to the mattress ( (5) 3 (5) -2 (6) 4 (5) 0 (6) 4 (3) 2.5 2 4(5) 25(10) 20{12) 8(5) 5(10) -2(7) 5 6 38 (22) 112(34)I70 (48)51(27) 20 (18) 5(15) 7.5 3 38 (19) 125(21) t85(29) 120(30) 70(30) 30(20) 10 4 53 (30) 133(28) 182(33) 157(24) 154(34) 110(45) WEB 2170 (lmg/Kg) 5 at 30 rain 3 3 (5) -4 (6) 5 (6) 4 (3) 5 (4) -3 (6) The vehicle had no effect.

Thirteen anesthetized, and ventilated newborn piglets were subjected to repeated saline lung-lavage series while mean systemic arterial pressure (ABP), mean pulmonary arteriat pressure (PAP), mean left atrial pressure (LAP) and mean central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac output and blood flow in the internal carotid artery (ICA) were measured. Systemic vascular resistance (S~), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and cardiac index (CI) were calculated. Sixty minutes after luug-lavage, the adrenaline group (A) (n=6) received adrenaline as a continuous infusion of 1.2 lag/kg/mi, while the control group (C) (n=7) received saline. None of the varlables were changed by saline. However, significant increases in ABP (p<0.0001), PAP (p<0.0001), CI (p<0.001) and SVR (p<0.01) were observed after administration of adrenaline, whiIe PVR and ICA were not modified. Mean\u00b1SD for ABP/PAP (P/A), FVR/SVR (P/S) and CI (ml/mirdkg) were: Ratios of PAP/ABP and PVPJSVR significantly increased following infusion of adrenaline.

We studied the effects of 80 ppm NO and 100% oxygen during heart catheterization in 16 children (age 1 -6 years, median 9 years) with heart defects and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRi) in order to asses the value of NO as a tool of decision making for corrective cardiac surgery. Patients were eligible for testing when they were more than one year old and had a pathologically elevated PVRi in a previous heart catheterization. Intubation, 'anesthesia and muscle paralysis were performed in all patients during testing of pulmonary reagibility. Calculations of pulmonary vascular resistance and flow were based on the Fick method. Response to NO was assumed when PVRi declined more than 30%, 9 of the 16 patients were responders to NO. Effects of NO and oxygen on PVRi, mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) and pulmonary vascular flow (Qp) in all responders are described in the table below. Cardiac surgery was offered to all responders, and 5 of them were successfully operated. Surgery is planned in another 3 patients and parental consent for surgery was not given in one patient. In Ebstein disease, during the first days of life, the ability of right ventricle to propel blood to the pulmonary artery is impaired due to high pulmonary vascular resistances. The flow is mainly directed to left atrium through tricuspid insufficiency, right atrium and foramen ovale. To decrease pulmonary resistances and increase pulmonary blood flow, high frequency oscillations, mechanical ventilation, nitric oxide and prostaglandin are required. After few days, a forward circulation is normally established. We cared two newborns with Ebstein disease where this approach was hindered by a large pulmonary valve insufficiency. Both of them were diagnosed in utero, showing a large tricuspid insufficiency with a non opened pulmonary valve and a ductal left to right shunt. One fetus was hydropic. At birth, blood stream from the ductus arteriosus was directed to the right ventricle through the pulmonary valve insufficiency then to right atrium, left atrium and ventricle, aorta and ductus arteriosus. A low pulmonary blood flow was demonstrated by low mean velocities (10cm/sec). A high reverse flow was seen in descending aorta with a negative flow in the renal artery. Both of these newborns were oliguric because of ductus arteriosus steal. Pulmonary blood flow Doppler evaluation allowed different strategies of ventilation, switching between HFO and conventional ventilation, modulation of PGE1 doses, inhaled pulmonary vasodilators (nitric oxide) and surfactant. The hydropic baby died, the other survived after 3 weeks of intensive care complicated by supraventricular arythmia (WPW).",

Eleven consecutive patients are included. A tri or quaddpolar 6 or 7F temporal transvenous catheter with an interpolar distance of 13 to 22 mm was advanced through the nares and positioned to the point with the largest amplitude of atrial deflection, Surface ECG and a bi or monopolar electregram were recorded simultaneously, selecting filters when needed (5 to 100 MHz). Pacing was performed with a programmable stimulator (Medtronic 5328) beginning with 2 ms and increasing mA to 10 and then increasing up to 9.9 ms. Narula method was selected to diagnose sinusal node disfunction (SND) and overdrive pacing to treat tachyarrhythmias. RESULTS. TP was useful in all the 11 patients and no complications were observed: in 3 patients a SND was diagnosed (one needing a definitive pacemaker), in two patients with Atrial Ratter (ripe 1) sinus rhythm was recovered, in one patient with a postoperative Junctional Ectopic Tachycadia we were able to get atrial synchrony with marked bemodinamic improvement, and 5 patients with Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia sinus rhythm was easily and quickly restored (2 of them recquirad repited episodes of TP until pharmacelogycal levels of antiarrhythmic drugs were raised). Mean age and weight were 31 months and 12.7 kg (one patient had 2.1 kg). There was a close relation between height and depht insertion (r= 0.98). Mean stimulation parameters were 9,1 ms and 13.5 mA. DISCUSSION. In experiencied hands TP is an effective and safe way to treat and diagnose cardiac arrhythmias even in newborns. It should be tried before endovenous pacing is stablished and it is faster than pharmacologycal treatment.",

Between 1986 and 1995 33 neonates, aged 1 -28 days (median 9 d), weight 2.t -4,1 kg (median 3,3 kg) with critical valvar aortic stenosis were dilated by balloon (AoVP) as the first line treatment. 21 patients received Prostaglandin El, 18 needed inotropic drugs and 16 mechanical ventilation. Associated cardiac lesions : Persistent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in 27 patients (restrictive PDA in 8 cases), a mitral regurgitation (MiVR) in 27 cases (15 severe and 12 moderate or mild MiVR), angiographic findings of endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) in 12 patients, mitral stenosis (MiVS) in 8, coarctation of the aorta (CoA) in 2, and finally a small musculary ventricular septum defect (VSD) in I patient. Vascular approach for ballooning : A. axitfaris in 20 cases (61%) a. femoralis in t 0 (30%) and v. femoralis in 3 cases (9%). The median ratio between inflated balloon and aortic valve diameter was 0,99. Dilatation was achieved in all 33 cases. The peak systolic gradient across the aortic valve (pre AoVP) ranged from 0 to 137 mmHg (median 50 mmHg) and was reduced to 0 to 55 mmHg (median 15; gradient reduction is significant (p < 0,01)). Aortic regurgitation (AoVR) was absent or mild in 30, moderate in 2 and severe in 1 patient after AoVP. 23 children survived (actual suwival rate: 70%; early mortalffy: n = 3; late mortality: n = 7). Mid term follow up (0-8,8 years; mean 2,7 years) showed an increase of the systolic peak doppler gradient across the aortic valve (median 41 mmHg) but no increase of AoVR. 10 re-interventions (Re-AoVP: n = 3, commissurotomy: n = 2, mitral valve replacement n = 2, resection of subaortic stenosis: n = 1, resection of coarctation: n = 2,VSD-closura: n = 1 ) were performed in 6 patients. RV contractility and pulmonary vascular mechanics(PVM) in immature animal models are poorly underslood. We developed an acute RV injury model to measure RV contractility and PVM in response to commonly used cateehalamines. Ten anesthetized piglets (9-12kg) were instrumented with micromanometers in the LV, RV, PA, and LA. A pulmonary artery flow probe was placed to measure cardiac output(Qpa). Ultrasonic dimension crystals were sutured to the myocardium and dynamic chamber volumes estimated using shell subtraction methodology. RV injury was induced with 3-7 cryoprobe injuries at -50 to -70\u00b0C for 3-4 minmes each. DA at 10mg/kg/min, DB at 10mg/kg/min, and EP at 0.1 mg/kg/min were infused in random order. RV contractility was evaluated by calculating a load independent measure of contractility, the preload recmitable stroke work(PRSW), during vena caval occlusions. To describe PVM, input resistanceS), characteristic impedance(Z0), total pewer(TP), and efficieacy 03f=QimO\"P) were measured. Measurements were made pre-and post-injury, during infusions, and between infusions. Clyoablation decreased PRSW (22.8_+7.8 to 13.8+4.1, p<0.001). At the end of the experiment, PRSW remained depressed to this level indicating stability of the model. One factor contributing to organ dysfunction for infants undergoing repair of congenital heart defects (CHD) is their \"inflammatory response\" to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). This response is characterized by an increase in cytokine release, complement activation and endothelial injury. Modified ultrafiltration (MUF) is a method for removing tissue water and inflammatory mediators by rapid ultrafiltration followin~ CPB, MUF may acutely improve post-operative end organ function. In this study, we evaluated the effects of MUF on the pulmonary and cerebral function of infants undergoing CPB for repair of CHD. We prosnecrivety randomized 30 infants (.~ 5 mos) to either MUF (n=16) or no MUF (n=14)(Control) following correction for CHD. The study intervals were 1) before CPB, 2) immediately after CPB, and 3) 20minutes after CPB. Pulmonary function was evaluated by measuring dynamic compliance (Cdyn) and airway resistance (Raw). For 13 pts (MUE=6 pts; Control=7 pts) exposed to a period of deep hypothermie circulatory arrest (DHCA), cerebral metabolism (CMRO2) was calculated at each interval using the Xe 133 clearance technique for cerebral blood flow measurements and arterial and jugular bulb saturation measurements to calculate CMRO2. A reduction in CMRO2 has been consistently demonstrated after DHCA. The effects of MUF on Cdyn and on CMRO2 are shown below:",

In those pts exposed to DHCA a trend towards better cerebral metabolic recovery compared to control was demonstrated. This is the first technique applied to infants undergoing DHCA where CMRO2 after CPB was greater than preCPB measm~s. Although this may be beneficial to postoperative hemodynamics, ventilatory management and long-term neurologic recovery, more patients and longer follow up will be necessary to verify such an effect. The effects of conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) on left ventricular (LV). diastolic filling in neonates are not well established. One approach to improve LV filling is the use of CMV to provide a phasic increase in airway pressure {thoracic augmentation). This phasic increase in airway pressure may result in an increase in LV filling similar to that which occurs with CPR. Thoracic augmentation has not been evaluated in neonates with ventricular dysfunction who frequently demonstrate increased heart rates. Attempts to maintain low peak airway pressures during CMV may result in a prolonged inspiratory time that occurs over multiple cardiac cycles. This may alter LV filling in the later cardiac cycles.",

The S-PEE/MEE ratio ranged from 1.04 to 2.07, while the RE/RDA ratio (21.25:4 kcal/kg/day)/(75.85:7 kcal/kg/dny) ranged from only .1 to .5. The PRISM/TISS ratio was not correlated better with MEE than the diagnostic category (r~=.36 vs..38, respectively). The RE was positively correlated withthe MEE (rZ=.65, I)=.07) while negative oarrelatian has been found between MEE and age, mid-arm circumference, triceps skinfotd and the use of vaseactive agents (r~.81, -88, -.67, p<.005 and -.71 resp~lively). Concl.m~: If S-PEE is used for caloric repletion in the stressed oritic~ly fll el~d, these patients will be substantially overfed by as much as 100%. Although PBMR appears to approximate the MEE by \u00b110%, other clinical and nutritional indices should also be ennsidered. Objective: To deter .mine..t.he metabpli.c and.nutritional state of mechanically ventilated intants and children m relatmn wlm severity or msease. Patients and methods: 37 Mechanically ventilated infants and children, median age 7 months (range 3 days to 13years), were studied. Severity of illness was assessed using PRISM, PRISM-II~ and fISS-scores. Oxygen consumption (VO2), energy expenditure (MEE) and respiratory quotient (RQ) were determmed by mdirect calorimetry. Total urinary nitroger(TUN) and creatinine excretion, levels of albumin and CRP were aetermmed in 16 patients. In these patients daily caloric intake and substrate utilization were assessed. They were categorized in subgroups: A partial feeding (recent admission to P1CU); B complete feeding. Results: MEE of the total group (n=37) ",

Patients and methods: records of 37 patients receiving nutritional support during 1993 were reviewed. Aider this first phase, knowledge and understanding of the role of nutrition support was conveyed to the residents through didactic lectures. In a second phase thedata were reevaluated in 35 children who were given nutrition support in 1995. Results: From a total of 425 days ofthempy, the single parenteral route was utilized in 80,5%, the digestive route (tube feeding or oral route) in 19,5%. of this time. A previous nutr~ional assessment was performed in 3 children; no patient had the nutr~on goals set. The nitrogen to nonprotein calories ratio ranged among 1:80 and 1:250. Only 29,7% of the patients had their estimated caloric needs supplied and this goal was achieved only in those patients who were on enteral tube feeding. Patients did not achieved their goals for vitamins. The supply ofoligonleme~s was adequate except the zinc. Nutritional monitoring parameters including weight, serum albumin and serum triglycerides were performed in almost all the patients but without uniformity. The reevaluation ofthase parameters showed adequacy of protein and micronutrients supply; however deficiency in nutritional monitoring and infrequent enteral feeding were still detected. Conclusion: There were lacks in the implementation of nutritional support, which were partially corrected in the 2rid phase of the study, Although the training of residents may have contributed to give them cognitive skills, it didn't changed policies and procedures as desired. We recommend reinforcement of the education program concerning basic nutritional aspects, and the organization ofa multidisciplinary team in charge of coordinating the providing of nutritional support.

The artedal ketone body ratio (AKBR) is established as a valuable tool in the management of adult patients undergoing surgery for severe liver disease.The redox theory emphasises the central role of the liver in preserving homeostasis and the importance of the hepatic mitochonddal redox potential (NAD+/NADH) in monitoring liver function and integrity.The AKBR (plasma acetoacetate/3hydroxybutyrate) is a measure of hepatic mitochonddal redox status, reduced ratios associated with poorer outcome. The venous ketone body ratio (VKBR) is influenced by peripheral ketone utilisation and therefore thought unreliable in assessing hepatic redox Its use has been dismissed as no correlation with the ratio in hepatic venous blood was found. Inspite of this. VKBR is used in the diagnosis of lactic acidoses and respiratory chain defects. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the AKBR and VKBR in a paediatnc intensive care population. 31 children admitted to the paediatdc intensive care unit, with indwelling arterial and central venous lines as part of their routine care, were recruited for the study. The median (range) age was 2.0 years (0-16.6 years) with PRISM score 10 (0-36), Simultaneous AKBR and VKBR were measured. Suppression of ketogenesis was confirmed using a rapid 3-hydroxybutyrate strip test (Ketofilm, Genzyme Diagnostics) pdor to sampling. The median VKBR 0.50 (range 0.13-1.46) was lower than median AKBR 0.56 (range 0.11-1,33), There was good agreement between artedal and venous ratios, Bland-Altman analysis giving a 95% confidence interval for relative bias of -0.13 to -0.03. There was a significant correlation between VKBR and AKBR r 2 0,8271, p,0.001 (intercept 0.02, slope 0,85) Conclusions; Values for AKBR tend to be higher than VKBR, however there is a consistent relationship in critically ill children. In paediatdc patients in whom ketogenesis is suppressed, VKBR may be considered equivalent to AKBR. This simple test may prove to be a useful adjunct in predicting mortality in cdt{cally ill children. To understand the present status of pediatric intensive care in China, we conducted a survey between October and December, 1993, involving 20 hospitals in 14 provinces and municipalities. The results showed that there were totally 41 ICUs for pediatric patients, including 19 pediatric ICUs (PICU), 18 neonatal ICUs (NICU) and 4 pediatric surgical ICUs (SICU), with total of 403 beds. The physicians to bed and nurses to bed ratios were 1:1.5 and 1:0.91 respectively. The average number of equipment per bed was 0.47 ventilator, 0.34 multi-fnnction monitor and 0.47 infusion pump. Very few of the ICUs had portable X-ray machine, biochemical and blood gas analyzers, and hemodialysis machines. The most frequently treated diseases/conditions were pneumonia, intracraniat infections, post-operation and sepsis in PICUs, and neonatal pneumonia, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and sclerema in NICUs. Pneumonia and respiratory failure accounted for 33.29% and 26.50% of all the diseases/conditions treated in the ICUs and the mean case fatality rate of respiratory failure was 24.50%. The results of the survey suggest that there is shortage of tCU beds and modern equipment, and treatment is often delayed due to excessively strict criteria for mechanical ventilation. A set of simple, and nationally acceptable criteria for evaluation of severity and cure of the diseases/conditions is urgently required. The medical reports of 286 children were reviewed and each admission was analysed in terms of age, sex, diagnosis, management within the hosp~al, length of hospital stay and type of poisoning. The youngest age was 23 days and the oldest was 16 years. Hundred and twelve (39.5%) of the children were girls and 174 (60.5%) were boys. The most common (26.5%) reason of admission was intoxication among all of the cases and the greatest group (73.7%) of the poisoned children had ingested medication which was followed by another group of patients (9.2%) who had eaten mushrooms. The peak incidence of drug ingestion was salicylate intoxication (20%). Forty drug poisoninigs were accidental while 16 was intentional. The majority (82.4%) of the cases that committed suicide was between 12 and t7 years old, and the main cause of suicide was being unsuccessful at school.",

Included were all patients who died in the hospital, except those treated in the neonatal ICU (predominantly premature and SGA newborns) and those who died in the emergency room. Among a total of 7179 hospital admissions (excluding the neonatal ICU and emergency room), 99 patients died (1.4%). Of these 99 patients 73 (74%) died in the pediatric ICU, 18 (18%) in the ward and 8 (8%) in the operating room. A chronic underlying disease was present in 66 (67%). Withholding or withdrawal of therapy was implemented in 48 (48%) children, 27 (27%) died due to failed CPR, 20 (20%) were brain dead and 4 (4%) died following a DNR order. Justification for therapeutic restrictions in the 52 patients of the DNR and W/W groups was imminent death in 32 (62%), lack of future relational potential in 12 (23%) and excessive health burden in 8 (15%). Withdrawal or withholding of therapy was carried out by extubation in 46%, vasoactive drugs were stopped in 25 %, and mechanical ventilation was withdrawn in 21%, Analgetics and sedatives were frequently used (in 73% and 79%, respectively). Hence decisions concerning restrictions of treatment are common in pediatric practice, mostly due to imminent death. Patients in which treatment was restricted were characterised by a longer hospital stay, a worse prognosis, a higher frequency of chronic underlying diseases and a lower acute mortality risk. Despite restrictions of intensive therapy, most patients were allowed to die in the pediatric ICU. Background Microalbuminuria (MCA), a subclinical increase in urinary albumin, reflects glomerular and overall vascular permeability 1\"2. An increase in urinary excretion of albumin occurs after burns and trauma. Transcanillary albumin escape rate is also increased in response to elective surgery 3 and in critically ill adult patients 4. We investigated a possible relationship between urinary albumin levels and clinical instability, as measured by Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) scores. Method We studied 26 consecutive patients (median age of 13 months, range 2-100). Patients whith nephropathies or any abnormality of urine analysis were excluded from the analysis. PRISM scores, MCA (mg.1-1) (immunonepbelometric) and urinary creatinine (Cu) (mmol.l -!) (Jaffb) (48 hour collection sample) were determined within 48 hours from admission to the PICU. The MCA/Cu ratio (mg.mmol.1 \"l) was used to correct for urine output variability. Diagnoses included respiratory failure (6), postoperative (5), neurologic (5), sepsis (4), trauma (3) and miscellaneous cases (3). Pearson's correlation was performed to correlate data. Results and Conclusions. Mean PRISM score and MCA/Cu were 16.9 \u00b1 5.9 SD and 1004-39 SD, respectively. A significant correlation was found between MCA/Cu and PRISM scores (R=0.80, p<0.001). Our observations show that, independently of the initial insult, the paediatric unstable patient may have increased capillary permeability, which is correlated with the degree of physiological derangement, as measured by PRISM scores. Microalbuminuria can be rapidly determined since it is routinely used in the management of diabetic patients, it is inexpensive, simple to measure and blood-spearing. Therefore, it might have a role in the clinical assessment of capillary permeability and transcapillary albumin escape Worldwide the demand for paediatric intensive care services exceeds the supply. In developing countries sporadic access to such services alters expectation of care and can lead to children being either mechanically or handventilated in general paediatric wards.",

A predictor of mortality based on simple physiological observations without the need for expensive blood tests and including chronic health status would be a useful tool. The establishment of a paediatric intensive care unit is proposed to redress the balance of care. To assess the performance of the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of Hospital Dona Estef~nia by an international standard score, the authors did a prospective study of 1149 consecutive admissions to the Unit during a period of 29 months. Mean age was 50.63 _+ 54.07 months; mean lengh of stay was 3.16 + 5.59 days. The effectiveness and efficiency were determined by the admission PRISM. Admission efficiency was defined by two criteria: a) mortality risk > 1% or b) the administration of at least one Intensive Care Unit-dependent therapy. The cumulative observed mortality was 5.57% and the expected mortality was 5.97%, with a Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) = 0.933. The overall performance of the PRISM score-based predictive model was found to be good (goodness-of-fit test x2 [5] = 6.387;p=0.271). Of 1149 patients admitted, combining the two criteria (ICUdependent therapy and mortality risk) an admission efficiency of 825 (71.8%) was found, equating to 3263 (89.94%) of 3628 1CU days. CONCLUSION: In our study the assessment of the admission efficiency and of the effectiveness of the Unit was possible by using the PRISM score of admission. There was no significant difference between mean values for OTISS and NTISS)in Level l patients (P=0.12 paired t-test).For level 2 and 3 patients mean value of NTISS was greater than OTISS (P<0.0001). There was a significant correlation between levels using either NTISS or OTISS (mean difference Level 1 and 2, Level 2 and 3, ( P < o.oool). Conclusions: A new TISS has been developed and used in a PICU. Nurses were able to accurately score the interventions on their shift. The assignment of patients to intensive care levels correlates with TISS values allowing a quantitative measure of severity.

Several such lists each serve more than a thousand professionals in more than 30 countries, each distributing a dozen or more messages each day to every subscriber.

Methods: In early January 1996 a pilot electronic survey was sent to a small fraction (N=63) of the memberships of 2 e-mail discussion groups, PICU@its.mew.edu, and NICU-NET@u.washington.edu (the full memberships of both. groups (N=t439 for NICU-NET, N=1045 for PICU) will be surveyed in early February of 1996). Participants were asked for demographic information, experience and skill level relating to e-mail, time spent with the discussion groups, perceived usefulness of different types of discussions, and the ways in which the discussions were used clinically. The pilot study was analyzed for construct validity by correlating an overall assessment question with a summary of the specific questions. Scale reliability was measured by Cronbach's alpha statistic. Results: The pilot survey response rate was 30163 (48%). The majority of respondents were male physicians, with an average age of 39+_5 years, who had completed subspecialty training in intensive care, and were working at a university-affiliated hospital. Most had been using e-malt for more than 6 months, and considered themselves moderately adept in that use. 63% felt that the list helped weekly to keep them informed about current issues and practices in their field(s), and 57% felt that, at least monthly, they used information from the list(s) that was not readily available in medical journals. Overall, 75% agreed that the list improved their professional competency. When asked to compare the value of 6 months of membership on an e-mail discussion group with more traditional educational media, 34% compared it with attending a national conference, and 26% compared it to a journal subscription. Cronbach's alpha was .76, Construct validity testing yielded coeff=.50, p <.05. Conclusior~: Internet-based e-mail discussion groups for health care professionals can be an important part of a strategy for maintaining professional competency. Despite the very low cost of this medium for most, the value is felt to be comparable to that of t~r more expensive forums for education. Further study will include distribution of the full survey in early February of 1996.",

Objectives: To study the characteristics of the muhiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MDS) in children. Methods: A retrospective study with all the children with MDS diagnosed from January 1990 to June 1995 is presented. 173 children fulfilled the Wilkinson criteria (I). In all of them the number of organs affected and the PRIMS score were determined during the first 24 hours. Several groups were performed according to the clinical diagnosis, the hospital of origin and the order of organs affected. Results: The 173 subjects studied were an 8% of the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit admissions. 100 of them expired (58%). No differences in age, sex and weight were observed between the children dying and the survivals. The most common causes of MDS were sepsis, both nosocomial (25%) and medingococcal (I4%) and acute respiratory failure. Sixty-fivepercent of the patients were from the hospital wards and the remaining were directly admitted to the PIGU from the Emergency room. The systems affected were: respiratory (93%), cardiovascular (92%), hematologic (61%), central nervous system (52%), renal (43%) and (hepatic) liver (28%). The organs initially failing were: heart (39%), tung (28%) and central nervous system (18%). The children dying had a larger number of organs with failure than the survivors (3.89 v,s. 3.34, p<0.001).The PRMIS score was higher in the children expiring than in the survivors (22.4 v.s. 17, p <0.001). S.mmary: The MDS is a common pathology in PICU, with a high mortality, The mortality is higher in children with a larger number of organs affected and a higher PRISM score. Sepsis is the most common etiulogy. Methods : From June Ist to July 15th 1995, all patients admitted to the pediatric ICU were included. The score was measured at day 1 (D1) and day 3 (D3) and we used 10 variables. For each organ system, we defined 2 categories : dysfunction or failure, which we respectively confered 1 or 4 points. Results : 56 patients were admitted : 22 newborns, 34 children. 23 were medical and 33 were surgical patients. 36 (64 %) patients had two or more organ failure at the admission, 12 (21,4 %) patients died, which 6 (50 %) in the first 48 hours. The mortality rate was the same for children with two or more organ faiIure at D1 and D3 : 6/36 (16,6 %) at D1, 4/22 (18,2 %) at D3. The mean score is different for children who survived or who died : 8,6 versus 17,9 at D1 ; 10,6 versus 18,2 at 133. When the score is > 15, the mortality rate is significant. ",

Information available early after traumatic brain injury in comatose children provides useful prognostic information on the likelihood of death or devastating injury. A retrospective study of 70 children with the diagnosis of epidural hematoma was made during 1990-1995 period. Ages ranged between 7 days and 17 years (18% less than 1 year, 40% between 1 and 10 years, and 42% older than 10 years), 82% of them were admitted at the PICU. 51% of the cases were due to falls, 35% to road traffic accident and 14% to other causes. On admission GCS was less than 8 in 19% of the cases and more than 14 in 53%. Diagnosis was made during first 4 hours in 63% of patients and delayed more than 12 hours in 28% of them. Neurologic impairment was present at admission in 33% of patients, and delayed in 30%. Even so,27% remained without impairment. Radiological findings at first CT were skull fracture (68%); epidural hematoma localization was: in the right side (63%), frontal area (24%), temporoparietal (66%) and occipital (t0%). Associated lesions were: several (13%) or unilateral (51%) cerebral contusions, diffuse brain oedema (10%), unilateral hemispheric oedema (14%) and 38% showed shifted middle line. Four patients died, half of them during the first 24 hours. 41 fully recovered (58.6%) and 25 have sequelae of different nature :7 were left with severe motor disability (10%); at the follow-up t3 have some degree of neurodisability. Next datas keep correlation with death or neurosurgical impairment: only were significative multiple cerebral contusion (p=0.002) and brain oedema (p=0.05), GCS less than 8 at the admission (p--0.002), shock (p=0.003) and remaining cerebral contusion in control CT correlated with death or diasability at discharge. On the other hand, neither surgical drainage volume nor first or highest levels of ICP (12 cases),nor pupillary abnormalities (10 cases) correlated with worse prognosis. Conclusion: GCS equal or less than 8 an shock are main factors related to worse prognosis, also multiple cerebral contusions in CT and diffuse brain oedema. The results of a modified GCS were compared to outcome and intensive therapy in 78 children (mean age 8,5t4,7 years) with head and associated injuries (53,6% of all cases) of different causes (traffic accidents, falls). The GCS was regularly used inn the course of intensive therapy.

Background: Reconstruction of the heart by three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography provided new information on anatomy of complex congenital heart defects, We assessed the utility of 3D ultrasound in detecting morphological changes in cerebral anatomy in newborns before and after cardiac surgery. Methods: Transfontanel cross-sectional ultrasound, scans were obtained in standardized coronal and median sagittal planes. Subsequently, rotational scanning was used to acquire the multiple sequential crosssections of the brain. For rotational scanning, a conventional 5 MHz transducer was rotated 180 degrees.Scanning took less than one minute and required no sedation, Data was stored in the image processing computer which allowed for off-line three dimensional reconstruction of different brain regions.Twelve infants aged 3 -21 (median 7) days were assessed before and after cardiac surgery, Results: Cavity of lateral ventricle, choroid plexus and the periventricular brain parenchyma could be reconstructed in all. Accurate estimation of size and volume of lateral ventricle, aqueduct, and other ultrasonographic visible pathological brain lesions could be performed. Reconstruction of various brain areas was accomplished in 3-10 minutes. The localisation and extension of severe periventricular hemorrhage which was detected preoperatively in one infants was better visualized than in conventional ultrasonography. Epicortical and subarachnoidal space could be reconstructed in all and allowed detection of hemorrhage in one case which was not detected by conventional ultrasound. Conclusion: 3D reconstruction of different areas of the brain may provide additional quantitative information on size and volume of the internal ventricle and choroid plexus, and better understanding of the topographical aspects and the extension of intra-and periventricular hemorrhage than conventional cross-sectional ultrasound. Introduction: Intracranial cerebral blood has been estimated to be 70% venous, The invasive measurment of venous blood saturation in the jugular bulb provides quantitative information on cerebral oxygen supply and consumption. However, routine oxymetric measurement of blood saturation in the jugular bulb by insertion of a catheter line into the internal jugtdar vein is an invasive procedure which has limited use especially in infants and young children. Thus the aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between the non-invasive spectroscopic measurement of rSO2 and the oxymetric determination of the blood saturation in the jugular bulb in infants and children undergoing routine cardiac catheterization.. Methods: During routine cardiac catheterization 30 infants and children (age 5 day-16 year, median 4,5 year) the rSO2 was measured continuously using a two chanel cerebral oxymeter (INVOS 3100A). The sensor was placed in standardized location at the left temporal head side. After the routine oxymetric blood sampling in the superior vena cava the oxymetric catheter was manupilated into the left jugular bulb. After control of the catheter position simultenuous values of the rSO2 were documented. Results: Over a range of (33-87%) SjO2, a significant linear correlation was found between the spectroscopic measurement of rSO2 and the oxymetric determination of venous blood saturation in the jugular bulb (r=0,83, p<0,001) and the superior vena cava (r=0,65, p<0,05). No significant correlation was found between rSO2 and the arterial blood saturation in the descending aorta and as well as to the standared hemodynamic parameters. Conclusion: Meusurement of rSO2 by MRS may provide continuous non-invasive information on cerebral venous blood saturation and thereby possibly on cerebral oxygen supply and consumption in infants and children. These may be of clinical value particulary during and immediately after heart surgery by means of non-pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass. ",

Guillain-Ba~re syndrome (GBS) is an acute autoimmune reaction, directed primarily toward the myelin encasing the peripheral motor nerves= This reaction causes a delay or block in nerve conduction. The presentation often can be very subtle but is followed by rapid loss of neuromuscular power, leading to acute respiratory distress, resulting from weakness of muscles and aspiration pneumonia. There were 3 boys -4, 8, and I I years old with GBS, treated in our ICU. Two of them due to the respiratory distress were intubated nasotracheally and ventilated mechanically with SERVO-9OOC (Siemens-Elema, Sweden) ventilator. Duration of ventilation was I I and 34 days, respectively. Plasma exchange was performed in all cases. The numbers of plasma exchange sessions were 2-4 in each case. Mean amount of plasma exchanged per session was 28,24 ml/kg. Plasma was substituted with albumin, plasma or saline. The most important aspect of the management of patients with GBS in the ICU involves the airway care, prevention and treatment of aspiration pneumonia and the mechanical ventilation if respiratory distress presents. Endotracheal intubation should be performed whenever there is evidence of retention of pulmonary secretions, refractory to chest physical therapy, weakness of protective reflexes of the airway, leading to aspiration pneumonia and (or) atelecr~sis. Cardiac arrhithmias too, is a main threat to the circulatory stability in GBS. Therapeutic plasmapharesis has been shown to be beneficial, reducing the time for weaning from the ventilator and for achieving independent ambulation. However, plasma exchange is expensive and not without significant risks for the patient. Some authors find that plasmapheresis is not effective for patients with fulminant course of GBS and blocking of nerve conduction. Recent studies have demonstrated that intravenous high-dose immunoglobulin can be equally effective. There were no significant complications associated with plasma exchange. All presented patients survived without residual disability.",

This survey involved patients between 6 months and 6 years of age who had visited due to their first FSE, the Sophia Children's Hospital during the period of january 1981 till december 1991. Patients with a history of neurologic disorders were excluded. 57 Patients were identified, 65% were male. The cause of the fever remained unknown in 51% of the cases. In all case the FSE was generalized and it most frequently occurred at night (47%). The mean age at FSE was t.6 years (0.5-4.7), the mean temperature 39.6\u00b0C (38.5-40\u00b0C). The mean follow up time was 1.7 year. Twelve children (21%) had neurologic sequelea. The neurologic sequelae varied from speech deficit (4 case mild, V2 -1 year delayed; 4 case moderate > 1 year delayed) to severe retardation and epilepsy (4 cases). Speech deficit was detected after a mean period of 6 months (range 0-18), Age, gender, temperature, family history and time of onset were no significant risk factors for neurologic sequelae. Duration of seizure [RR 3.0 (0.8-11.3)] and more than two drugs to treat FSE (RR 5.2 (t.5-18.1) were related to neurologic sequelae. We recommend that FSE children should be followed for at least a year to detect possible speech disorders properly and start early intervention.",

Spain CASE REPORT: The patient was a 2-year-o!d gift transferred to our PIC because of severe respiratory failure. The patient, convaleseem of ehiekenpox, came into contact with horse manure previous afternoon. In the morning, she was lethargy, and irritability, with poor finding, and ~ an episode of coughing, cyanosis and acute respiratory failure after mucous vomiting when she was drinking milk. On admission she had severe respiratory distress, respiratory acidosis, and the Sat 02 was 86%. She was mtubated without difficulty, and was transferred to our P.I.C.U. Physical examination reveals stable hemodynamies, pupils equal, round, reactive to light, normal fandi, and muscle relaxation. Crusted vesicles diseminats~d. Rhonehi over both lungs. Hepatomegaly (+) and splenomegaly (+). ~lhe urine, hematologic, and C.S.F. laboratory findings were normal. C.T. scan of the brain, E.E.G., and EKG. revealed no'abnormalities. Rx chest disclosed a retrocardiac atelectasis. Speci~ts of stool and blood were obtained for cultures and study of C. botul#num toxins. Pending receipt of these results, a broad-speotmm antibiotic and acyctovir was begun. The initial differennal diagnosis consisted of LARYNGOSPASM ASSOCIATED WITH ASPIRAqlON, botulism, and postmfecfious varicella encephalitis. After 15 hours, weatm~ was begun. The neurologic examination showed a low Modified Glasgow Coma ~ale (MGCS), generalized hypotouia and muscle weakness. These data suggested three diagnoses, posfnfecfious encephalitis, residual neuroumsoAar blockade, and excessive doses of sedative and analgesic drugs. After 20 hours she regained skeletal muscle poxver and ufltlcient respiratory effort, the MCGS was acceptable, and blood gases were normal. She was given n~-tigmine and atropine, and her tr~ma was extubated. An acute respiratory failure ocurrs 120 ram. after. Chest radioga'aph disclosed a left inferior lobe atelectasis. After 20 hours weaning begun~and the same episode w~as seen. At this point her mother stated that the girl showed weakness of the eyelids or extraneular muscles. It suggested myasthenic syndrome vs ~-Barr6 syndrome. C. botul#num toxins were negative, chotinesterase level ~as normal. Edrofoinum test ~as positive. Anti-acetyleholine receptor antibodies were negatives. E.M.G. confirmed MYASTHENIA GRAVIS (CONGENITAL vs JUVENILE serenegative). Pyridostigmine was begun and the trachea was extubated without complications. CONCLUSION: Din the differential diagnosis of weamng failure we must consider ~c gravis~ 2)Myasthenia Gravis could resemble encephalitis, because of low OCS, overall if is triggered by viral infection. 3)In some diseases (this case) GCS could not he an aemuate index of mental state.",

The goal of this paper is to review evidence related to hypothesis that the \"waiting\" axons and cells of the transient subplate zone may participate in the structural plasticity of the human cerebral cortex after perinataI brain damage (Kostovic et aL, Metabot Brain Res4:17, t989) and to correlate this phenomenon with different forms and mechanisms of structural plasticity. It is our basic assumption that all lesions occuring during cortical histogenesis will lead to more or less pronounced structural reorganization. Here we show that various components of the subplate zone participate in several forms of the structural \"plastic\" responses in the human cortex: modification of convolutional pattern, changes in size of cytoarchitecturat areas~ columnar reorganization, dendritic and synaptic plasticity. The etiological factors which induce lesions and subsequent plastic changes act via the following pathogenetic mechanisms: * disturbances of radial unit formation (Rakic); * changes in ingrowth of afferent fibres; * changes in the rate of normally occuring reorganisational events, depending on the critical period for a given histogenetic event. In the present study developmental lesions (localized perlventricular leukomalacia and haemorrhages) were demonstrated by ultrasound in live-born infants ranging between 26 to 40 weeks of gestation. In younger infants (24-34 w) who died shortly after birth, examination revealed lesions of the white matter with the preservation of the subplate zone. In infants who died one week of more after the lesion, we have observed localized micropolygyria, cavities, condensed layer VI -subplate zone, and columnations of the cortical plate. These changes are less prominent if the lesion occurs after diminishment of the subplate zone (after 34 w). Since in the fetal cortex the subplate zone serves as predominant source of growing fibers, transient neurons, trophic factors and contains cellular substrata for migration, this zone is the most likely candidate for major types of structural plasticity. In conclusion, cerebral cortex of the low -birthweight infants is more susceptible to the various lesions but shows vigorous structural plasticity and conspicuous functional recovery due to the growing, transiently located neuron at elements. The mortality due to meningoccocal sepsis is high in spite of important progress in emergency and intensive care medicine. During the last decade multiple scoring-systems have been developed in order to establish a therapeutic approach and to evaluate the final outcome of a meningococcal infection. Different clinical and biological data (shock, ecchymosis, peripheral WBC and platelet count, coagulopathy, acidosis, meningism, etc) are taken into consideration and the importance given to these data depends on the scoring-system used. A review of the different scoring-systems is given and a clinical case is presented. We report the case of a 4 year old male, who was transfered to our ICU 12 hours after onset of temperature and skin rash. The parents described a fast deterioration of his condition. The boy presented wide spread ecchymosis, high temperature, no signs of meningism, circulatory insufficiency and shock, coagulopathy and low peripheral WBC and platetet count. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy developed promptly. The Glasgow Meningococcal Septicemia Prognostic Score (GMSS) was used and the obtained score reached the highest level (15/15). This corresponds to a 100% mortality. The patient required mechanical ventilation for 5 days. At admission he received human albumine, fresh frozen plasma, dexamethason, dopamine, dobutamine and a continuous infusion of adrenaline. Antibiotical treatment consisted of ceftdaxone. The evolution was favorable and the infant fully recovered. Retrospectively the GMSS was compared to other meningococcal scoring scales which gave the same mortality (100%). We conclude that the scoring-systems are important to evaluate the seriousness and to assess the therapeutic approach, but they should be used cautiously even when 100% mortality is predicted by several risk evaluations scoring-systems. The aim of this study was to assess the haemodynamic status on admission and the critical care management of children presenting with meningococcat infection. This was a retrospective study of the charts of 46 consecutive admissions.",

Patients and methods. Between May 1989 and March 1995, 34 children with SIP were admitted to our PICU : 6 (17.6%) died and 28 (82.4%) ranged in age from 1 to 185 months (mean : 29) survived, 5 of them (17.8%) with SNLI (defined as the need of a surgical procedure). In survivors, two hemostasis studies (between H0 and H12, and 24 H later) included the determination of coagulation factors (routine tests), protein C (PC : amidolytic activity, Biogenic), total protein S (PS : ELISA, Stago), C4b binding protein (C4bBP : Laurell's technique, Stago), antithrombin3 (AT3 : chomogenic test, Stago), and plasminogen activator inhibitorl (PAIl : chromogenic test, Biopool). Three severity scores were determined at admission : French Group of Pediatric Intensive Care, Gedde-Dahl, and CRP. Statistical analysis used the Wilcoxon's test. Results. At admission (lst sample) severity scores and AT3, PC, PS, C4bBP levels were not different between the group with SNLI and the group without SNLI ; Quick time (22 4-5% vs 35 \u00b1 14% ; p = .025), VtI+X (20 4. 3% vs 30 4-10% ; p = .04I) and PAll (105 4-157 UI/m! vs 580 4. 570 UI/ml ; p = .028) were lower in the group with SNLI.

We present a case of postsepsis bradycardia following severe typhlitis and septic shock in a 12 year old boy with relapse common ALL. Blood and ascitic fluid specimen grew Clostridium species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. At surgery there was a necrotic gangrenous terminal ileum and cecum, requiring ileocecal bowel resection with ileostoma. While clinically recovering from sepsis he developed bradycardia for 120 hours. Extensive diagnositic procedures was given and the heart rate slowly increased to normal range of age. Postsepsis bradycardia in children with hematologic malignancies after an episode of sepsis is self-limiting and after careful differential diagnostics warrants an expectative attitude. Nitrate level is known to be enhanced during sepsis. Serum nitrate is the stable metabolic end-product of endogenous nitric oxide generation. Nitric oxide has demonstrated to be a powerful anti microbial final mediator and also a key molecule driving to the lethality of one of the most common complication of sepsis; the endotoxic shock. Such facts prompted us to investigate the possible diagnostic and/or prognostic value of monitoring serum level in high risk, presumptive and confirmed sepsis patients. Additionally we have explored the usefulness of this mediator as index of therapeutic response. In our study it is demonstrated that there is an important relationship between nitrate level and the occurrence of neonatal sepsis. Septic newborn group showed 6 fold higher nitrate level than that of healthy control group. In addition, the group of patients with high risk of sepsis which finally became septics, exhibited 3 fold higher nitrate level at 24-72 hours before the first symptoms appeared, when compare with those who did not develop sepsis. However in the presumptive sepsis group, there was no difference between the patients which finalIy ,&'ere considered septics and those which not. In all septic cases, after 7 days of a successful therapy with antibiotics, the level of nitrate diminish 3 fold. Our results suggest the utility of monitoring nitrate as index for the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. The potential benefits of exchange transfusion, plasma exchange, and haemofiltration have all been described in children with overwhelming sepsis. However, little hard evidence exists to prove the benefits of any of these techniques. I have treated five patients with plasma exchange (PE), having been asked to see all these patients at a point when it was felt death was inevitable. Two of the patients had staphylococcal, two meningococcal and one enterococcal septicaemia. All patients showed a dramatic haemodynamic improvement following PE with improvement in blood pressure, reduction in inotrope requirement and improvement in tissue perfusion. Three patients survived. One of the patients with staphylococcal sepsis and both of the patients with meningococeal sepsis had developing gangrene of the limbs which showed remarkable reperfusion with PE. In two of the patients measurements of cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) showed ~a reduction in CO and a rise in SVR over the course of a PE despite the reduction or cessation of vasoconstricting inotropes. Many believe haemofiltration is of value in septic shock. A trial with a no treatment limb is difficult to achieve. I believe we now have enough evidence to justify a controlled trial of haemofiltration versus plasma exchange in patients with septic shock and unstable haemodynamic status whilst on inotropic support.

Starting Mean Airway Pressure (MAP) of 19 cm H~O was based OR MAP of the CV, Oscillatory pressure amplitude (dP) Of 47 was, at ii~itial frequency of 7.5 Hz, adjusted ur~til chest wall vibrations were visible, it was required to raise MAP to 26 cm H20 and dP to 66 before optimal lung volume and ventilation were achieved and need for O 2 reduced within hours, This was monitored by frequent blood-gas analysis and chest x-rays. MAP and dP could slowly be reduced, After a good response the first day, gradually 02demand reduced and the patient could be weaned from the ventilation. MAP, dP, Fi02 and Oxygenation index (MAP X Pa0~JFiO 2) are shown in table I. Chest X-ray follow-up showed gradually improving lung features, with marked improvement of aereation. After 10 days HF0-V she could be succesfully detubated when a MAP of 10 cm H20 was acmeved. Results : Sianificant increase in ventilato~ rate and mean airway pressure was noticed after the change to SAVI. No differences in oxygenation, CO 2 partial pressure and systolic, diastolic or mean blood pressure between IMV and SAVI periods were noted. In 6 infants however an improvement in PaO2/P43.Ol/ and decrease in PaCO 2 was observed after the switch to SAVI.",

Material and Methods: it's an electromc-pneumatic eontolled device with an oclusion valve and a pressure monitor installed between endotracheal canulla and the ventilator circuit. The measurements were performed with a sollenoid conected with to the ventilator to detect the end of inspiration phase and the actwation of the oclusion valve. The signs of pressure and flow were moniturized using a difere~rtial transducer and it was processed using a PC computer and a Pneumoviaw\u00ae software. The auto-PEEP also displayed in the ventilator pressure monitor. Results: we submitted 17 children with neuromuscular disease or respiratory distress in this study. The incidence of auto-PEEP was 76%, with variability between 1,5 to 13 cmH20. All the measurements were performed 3 times to verify the precision and the reproduetibility and evaluation of the pressure and flow curves. Conclusion: the device is low cost, easy to use and can be used without the pneumotacograph. The auto-PEEP measurement can be done during mechanical ventilation with time cycled, pressure limited and continuous flow, the most commom ventilator used in pediatric patient. ",

Co) in 24 newborn infants with RDSN of t-IV stages on CMV, CPPV, IMV, and CPAP steps using respirators of various kinds (Stephan-Staxel, Bear-2001, Newport 8rezee, Sechrist). Parameters investigated were: temperature of inspired mixture (T), relative and absolute humidity (RH and AH, respectively), static compliance (C), expired tidital volume (Vte), expired minute volume of ventilation (MVe). The monitor read these parameters in following ranges; RH-from 10 to 100%; AH-up to 55mg/I; MVe-up to 3.0 I/mini Vte-from 3 to 130 ml; T-accurate to 3%; C-from 0.1 to t0 ml/cm H20. Continuous monitoring time ranged from 2 to 96 hours, it was noted, that during this time the monitor and transducers had no malfunctions, and it's using didn't require additional calibration, it was found, that humidifiers MR 498 and MR 410 (Fisher, Paykel) couldn't maintain parameters T and AH continuously (these values varied from 34,3 to 38.2 C and from 37,5 to 47.1 mg/I, respectively, when heating regulator position was unchanged). Changes of parameters C depended clearly on CPPV conditions and RDSN severity (with RDSN of stages I-II C value ranged from 2.4 to 1.2 ml/cm H20; and with stages IIt-tV-from 0.3 to 1.1). tn 6 newborn suffering from RDSN of stages II-ltl and Ill-lV with PIP>25 mbar, Fi02>0,7, PEEP=4-7 mber, C-from 0.3 to 1.2 ml/cm H20, effectivity of Exosurf Therapy was studied. In 4 newborns in 4-12 hours of therapy PIP decreased to 0.3-0.4, and C increased to 1,7-2.4 ml/cm H20. in 2 newborn infants with AaD02>500 mmHg and C from 0,3 to 0.8 mltcm H20 positive effects of Exosurf on lung compliance were not observed. In 3 newborns the monitor had revealed decreased of C (from 3.4-2.9 to 1,8-1.3 ml/cm H20), manifested clinically by pneumothorax. In general, monitor HTM 902 made possible; 1), to estimate the adequacy of CMV-parameters and regimes in newborn infants; 2). to select optimal T and AH values in the respiratory outline in dependence on lung damage severity and infused volume; 3). to reveal RDSN severity; 4), to optimize indications and adequacy of surfactaot therapy; 5). to diagnostieate the air leakage syndrome; 6). to effects to some agents (broncholytics, spasmolytics); 7). to obtain objective indications for IMV/SIMV and CPAP regimes.",

There have been attempts to correlate antenatal or postnatal criteria to mortality: none have been demonstrated to be predictive of lethal PH. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine whether antenatal or early postnatal data could correlate with the findings of post-mortem examinations. Patients and methods: Between July 1990 and July 1994, 32 CDH patients have been antenatally and postnatally managed at our institution. Twentythree infants underwent a post-mortem examination. PH was assessed by using the lung weight to body weight ratio (LW/BW) and the radial alveolar count (RAC). Antenatal results: CDH diagnosis was made at 24 weeks of gestation (wg) (15-37). Twenty-eight patients had a left sided CDH, 3 had a right sided CDH, and one had a bilateral CDH. Herniated organs were stomach None (n=21), or liver alone (n=4), or both stomach and liver (n=5 The patient was a 3-yenr-old girl with chronic renal insufficiency see~ to renal dysptasm, Two months before admission a kidney trar~ptant was performed. One morah later she showed acute graft rejection with serum ereafinine (Cr) level of 0.7 mg%. The rejection was unreslxmsive to an increased steroid dosage, and OKT3 was begun with resolution of the rejection. One week aRer, new rejection episode was seen marestxmsive to an increased steroid dosage, and transp~ ~s performed five days before admission to our PtC. Hemedialysis and Peritoneal dialysis (P.D.) each other day, was indicated (G.R.F.< 10 ml/rnin). Four days before admission T ~ rose to 38\u00b0C. \"lhe diagnosis of opporttmistic pneumoma was made on the basis of tach3,pr',e~ hypoxi~ and diffuse interstitial infiltrates. Senma ~ was positive for cytomegaloviras (CMV), and stool culture for C ALbicans. Pentamidine, ganciclovir (DHPG), arai-CMV gamma globulin, eritromicine and amphotericin B was administered. On admission in our PICU, trachea was mmbated, (A-a) O2 gradient was 600, PaOffFiO~: 65, Lung Injury Score > 3 with PEEP level of 8 cm HzO. She had normal fiver function. During te next days she had fever and developed ARDS. BAL was negative. P.D. was of little efficiency. We adjusted pentanfdine, and DHPG doses for severe renal failure, with supplements after herO, sis, and at~rP.D.. During ~ next days she was afebrile, and the chest became radiologlcally normal.

Majority of the patients were of sepsis (36.2%), CNS disorder (22,2%) followed by respiratory problems (14.6%). It seems therefore that the major indicatiou for ventilation was overwhelming septicemia leading to multiple organ failure, rather than purely respiratory problems.",

In the course of HFO 2 of them were given NO in the concentrations of 5-80 p.p.m., 3 were subjected repeatedly to surfactant replacement therapy (Alveofact). Results: ECMO was needed in no patient, 8 patients survived, 1 patient was disconnected from the ventilator because of brain death in spite of conspicuous improvement of oxygenation and other parameters, Some relevant parameters 48 hours before and 48 hours after starting HFO are given in table 1~ In all the cases, the disconnection from HFO was carried out through the SIMV regimen, never directly to CPAP. Table 1 : The levels of blood gases, oxygenation index (OI), AaDO2,MAP,FiO2 and PaO2/FiO2 ratio 48 hours before and 48 hours after starting HFO. Conclusion: Although none of the patient had to be subjected to pediatric ECMO, HFO should be carried out only in workplaces having the immediate possibility of using this method in the case of HFO failure. Speculation: Should not HFO be used ir pediatric patients with ARDS earlier than aggressive CMV? Can HFO ce considered standard, not experimental method of therapy? Refractory hypoxemia in premature patients is characterized in a persistent elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance, with right to left shunt through the ductus arteriosus and or foramen oval. We report the case of a VLBW patient (GA 27W, BW 1010g) who present a severe hypoxemia related to hyaline membrane disease and a pulmonary and systemic infection to group B streptococcus, refractory to conventional ventilatory support and surfactant therapy, associated to hemodynamic failure falling in ECMO criteria used for term infants. A rescue therapy with HFOV (Sensor Medics 3100A) is decided at 5 h of live, The table resume the patient's evolution before and after HFOV. At 36W of postgestational age the patient present a FiO2 of 0.23 with a chest X ray compatible with a CLD type L At discharge no oxygen requirements was needed and actually he's doing well. CONCLUSION: HFOV, using an adequate alveolar recruitment strategy, was effective in the rescue of a severe hypoxemic respiratory failure with a rapid off of ECMO criteria entry in our VLBW premature patient, During the United Nmioffs embargo ~nst Yugoslavia the prevalence of the ast}nnafic ~acks in c~dldren aratsed.

The application of new therapeutic modalities have increased the survival rates in (ARDS) adult patients. Objective: To study the therapeutic efficacy of new tleamlents in children with ARDS Material and methods: A retros~ctive study was conducted from 1990 to 1995. 17 children with severe ARDS, (lung severity score > 2,5) (R), aged 15 days to 16 years, were included. The diagnosis were as follows: 9 interstitial pneumonitis, 5 non interstitial lung infection, 2 with lung aspiration and 1 with clinical sepsis. 5 patients had different tipes of cancer and 4 to suffer inmunodeficiency disease, The first 8 subjects (Group t) were treated with conventional measures. From October of 1994new therapeutic modalities were introduced, including: less agressive ventilatory support, postural changes (prone to supine) in 9 subjects, administration of corticosteroids in 8 patients, rfitric oxide in 3, pe~ssive hypercapnia and administration of exogeans sarfactant in one, PaO2/FiO2, D(A-a)O2, oxigenation index (OI) and the score of respirator), severity disease were similar in both groups. The two groups evolntiou was compared. Results: -Ten patients died, 6 from group I and 4 from group II (75% v.s.44:4%,NS). -The evolution time, either to exitus or weaning from ventilatory support was higher in group II (22.9 v.s. 13.6days in group I, NS), -The incidence of barotrauma was observed in 12 subjects (70.6%), 6 from group I and 6 from II. Of these patients 75% expired.",

One ml of contrast was hand ventilated into the respiratory tree via their nasotracheal tubes and their anatomy and dynamics demonstrated on radiological screening. Case Descriptions: Three infants who were difficult to ventilate requiring high airway pressures, high PEEP and a significant oxygen requirement had TBGs. The ages ranged from 3 to 9 months. Two cases were complicated by complex cardiac lesions. In all cases there were frequent episodes of desaturation, where hand ventilation proved difficult and various intermittent lobar collapses occurred. Microlaryngobronchoscopies (MLB) performed on the infants by experienced paediatric ENT surgeons failed to identify the airway problems. More than one MLB was frequently done. Concern about introducing contrast into the airways of infants with limited cardiorespiratory reserve combined with an uncertainty about how much extra intbrmafion would be gained often led to a delay in investigation. When performed these fears proved groundless, the anatomy and pathology of the airways were demonstrated in full and the correct therapeutic plan started. In two cases tracheostomy and PEEP producing patency of bronchomalacic segments allowed weaning to low levels of ventitatory support. In one case tracheal reconstruction was undertaken and in the cardiac cases the respiratory component of the ventilatory dependence was fully assessed. At the age of 4 months, a baby boy with a history of minor respiratory problems, was admitted to hospital with an upper airway infection and severe dyspnoea. Shortly after arrival at the ICU he had a total airway obstruction. After intubation there were still difficulties to establish a normal gas exchange, and he was tranferred to the regional PICU. CT scan and bronchoscopy verified a congenital tracheal stenosis affecting the whole trachea except the upper 15 mm below the vocal cords. The diameter was estimated to less than 2 ram. An unsuccessful attempt was made to dilate the extremely rigid stenosis with a balloon. After the procedure he had a respiratory and circulatory arrest, and he was put on ECMO as a bridge to surgical correction. After 4 stable days on ECMO, surgery was performed during ECMO with a tracheal homograft transplantation. Immediately after surgery, ECMO was discontinued. A silastic Dumont type stcnt was inserted inside the homogra~, and a nasotracheal tube was placed inside the stent for assisted intermittent mechanical ventilation. Repeated bronchoscopies were performed to remove granulation tissue and secretions. At 9 months of age, the stem was removed with an endoscopic procedure. However, the trachea was still soft and collapsable, and another silicon stent was placed inside the trachea for another 4 months period, After removal he had some respiratory problems and he was treated with nebulized salbutamol, mcemic epinephrine and steroids. He was discharged from the hospital at 14 months of age and his condition is now stable. This is the first procedure of its kind in Sweden. It was accomplished by international and multidisciplinary collaboration. ECMO may be a bridge to corrective surgery and long time stenting may be necessary in the postoperative period. Post mtubation Laryngitis ( PIL ) is still a frequent complication, occurmg in l -6 % of intubated patients. Inhaled racemic epinephrine has for long been used as an accepted therapy, but this drug is not always available. The authors undertook a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the efficacy of inhaled L-epinephrine(LE) in the treatment of PlU",

Although have had advances in radiologic investigation exams and pulmonary function tests, the direct anatomic visualization of airway is important to the management of many respiratory problems. Objective: Evaluation the respiratory endoscopies performed with a rigid bronchoscope in a pediatric reference hospital. Material and Methods: We study the records of all children that were submitted to respiratory endoscopy under general anesthesia from march 1989 to march 1992. Age, sex, clinical to indicate the procedure, diagnosis and complications of endoscopy were registered. Results: Three hundred and fifty six respiratory endoscopies were performed. The most common indications for endoscopy were strider (52%), suspected foreign body (16%), atelectasis (16%) and difficult tracheal extubation (8%). The most frequent diagnosis were laryngomalacia (36%) and subglottic stenosis (6%) in the glottic and subglottic areas, and foreign body (9%) and tracheomalacia (7%) in the tracheobronchial area. Normal endoscopy was performed in 54 (21%) of the children. Only three slight complications of the endoscopy were observed. Two patients presented bradycardia during the exam, and the third need tracheal intubation due to post-endoscopic subglottic edema. Conclusion: The rigid endoscopy in children is efficient and has no serious complications.",

            "text": "The outcome of the patients was good. No complications were observed. Extraction is recomended in every symptomatic patient. Orphenadrine is an anticholinergic drug mainly used to decrease symptoms of Parkinson disease. Orphenadrine has a peripheral and central effect and overdose can result in athetoid movements, convulsions, cyanosis, coma, arrhythmias, shock and cardiac arrest. Physostigmine is a specific antagonist of the peripheral and central effects and can be a useful antidote. We report the case of a two and a half year old female who was transfered to our ICU for general convulsions. The little girl had, three hours before admission, accidently ingested 400rag of orphenadrinehydrochlodde (Disipal\u00ae), which was her grandmothers anti-parkinson medication. Three hours after ingestion she presented neurological signs: confusion, unstable walking, and periods of aggression. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures appeared who were rebel to administration of multiple anti epileptica but ceased after IV administration of diazepam and endotracheal intubation and ventilation. An episode of ventdcular tachycardia responded well to the IV administration of tidocaine. The levels of orphenaddne in the serum were high at admission (3550pg/L) and were present in the blood up to 96 hours after ingestion. High serum levels are, in the literature, associated to a high mortality rate. Physostigmine was administered three times at a 0.02mg/kg dose in the first 24 hours. We decribe the noted effects of physostigmine on the different symptoms. The patient survived and could leave the ICU after one week. In conclusion: orphenadrine poisoning is a very complicated medical problem associated with high mortality. In severe intoxication, the benefit of physostigmine more than counterbalances its side effects. Objective: To define the optimal volume of dilution for endotracheal (ET) administration of epinephrine (EPI) Design: Prospective, randomized, laboratory comparison of four different volumes of dilution of endotracheal epinephrine (1.2, 5, and 10 ml of saline) Setting Large animal research facility ofa universi~ medical center Subjects and interventions: Epinephrine (0.02 mg/kg) diluted with four different volumes ( 1, 2.5. and I 0 rot) of normal saline was injected into the ET tube of five anesthehzed dogs. Each dog served as its own control and received all four volumes in different sequences at Ieast one week apart. Arterial blood samples for plasma epinephrine concentration and blood gases.were collected before and 0.25, 0.5. 0.75_ 1.2.3, 4. 5. 10, 15.20, 25.30 , and 60 minutes after drug administration. Heart rate and arterial blood pressure were continuously monitored. Measurements and Main Results: Higher volumes of diluent (5 and I0 ml) caused a significant decrease of PaO2, from 147:!:8 tort to 106\u00b1I0 torr, compared to the tower volumes of diluent (1 and 2 ml), from 136\u00b110 torr tu135+_7 torr (p<0.05). These effects persisted for over 30 minutes. Mean plasma epinephrine concentrations significantly increased within 15 seconds following administration for all the volumes of diluent. Mean plasma epinephrine concentrations, maximal epinephrine concentration (Cmax), and the coefficient of absorption (Ka) were higher in the 5 ml and 10 ml groups. The time interval to reach maximal concentration (Tmax) was shorter in the 5 ml and 10 ml groups. Yet these results were not significantly different. Heart rate. systolic and diastolic blood pressures did not differ significantly between the groups throughout the study.",

Objective: To assess the normal ,gastric intramucosal pH ~Hi) by tonometry in healthy children Patients and methods: Twelve healthy children (6 males and 6 females) with age rmaged from 6 months to 12 years scheduled for minor plastic or urologic surgery. Children were previously medicated with midazolam (0.25 mg/kg) and atropine (0.02 mg~) both i.m.. Anaesthetic induction was standardized with 02 -N20 (75%) administered via facial mask and increased halotane concentrations (up to 2%). All patients got an endotraeheal tube after iv. administration of femanile (2 mcg:Jkg) and vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg) or suxametonio (1 mg/kg), Pmaesthesia was maintained with O 2 -N20 (60-75%) and isofluorane (0.5-1%). During surgery, 8 children needed mechanical ventilation and the others maintained spontaneous breathing. EKG, heart rate, blood pressure, and pulse oximetry were moniterized. After anaesthesia, a sigmoid tenometry catheter (Tonometrics, Inc.) was inserted in the stomach of the patients by direct visualization with laryngoscope and Magyll clamps. Children were all maintained normoventilated and with normal cardiorespiratery variables. Cadet's balloon was \u00a3~led with 2.5 ml of saline. Thirty minutes after the insertion 1 rrd was extracted and rejected, just afterwards the remanent 1.5 ml was extracted and immediately analyzed. Simultaneously an arterial gasometry by puncture was performed.

The phi was derived from application of the Henderson-Hassdbach formula using the pCO2 value from the tonometer and the arterial bic~rbonate. All pipets received raaitidiila before sttrgery. Values of pHi above 7,35 and lactate levels between 6 and 15 mg/dl were considered nortrM. The results were statistically anaJ.izated with ANOVA and Bonferroni tests. Results: The phi was normal on pre anhepatic stage (> 7,35) and lactate levels were slightly increased (21, 5 +_ 8, 9 and 19, 5 \u00b15, 9mg/dL NS) .

B~kground : The paediatrie gallbladder diseases generally described are calculous \u00a2hol~Tstitis, cystic duct obstruction, congenital anomaly of the biliary tract, and inflammation. In the neonatal period, noulithogenie gallbladder disease could be also due to erythroblastosis or hyperalimentation. Obieetive : We describe an other type of disease affecting the gallbladder in neonates thought to be related to their vascular vulnerability. Methods : Four patients with abnormal gallbladder ultrasound not related to classical observations were included. We have studied and reviewed the biological and clinical data, the ultrasound findings and their evolutions. Results : Four patients, 30 to 32 ~.k-old neonates ~ffth a birthweight be~,een 1,3 and 1,9 kg, were intubated and under total parenteral nutrition for 10 to 35 days. None of them were symptomatic on repeated clinical evaluations. One newborn developped hypotensien on umbilical bleeding at 3 hours of life. In two cases, signs of cholestasis were discovered : the total bilirubin level has risen to 5 mg/dl; the direct bilirubin level was 1,5 mg/dl while the urina were dark and the ~o~,ls :mcolour~. The c~mplct~ ~crology as a!! the culVare~ remained negative. The ultrasound explorations were atypical : in the four eases, an initial increasing broad and thickness of the wall of the gallbladder with an hyperecbogenie inside content, which was not sludge, was discovered. In three eases the images resolved in ten to fifteen days. In one ease, an asymptomatie thrombosis of the vena portu which remained patent was discovered. In this case, at one month, the ultrasound showed images encountered in chronic ebolecystitis and, at one year, the gallbladder appeared atrophic. None of them underwent surgery. Conelusiou : The gallbladder diseases are multifactorial. Besides the prematurity, the infections, the total parenteral nutrition, the premature neonate is exposed to vascular vulnerability affecting also the gallbladder and this may explain our findings. Progress in prognosis of pts with B-NHL had followed the use of multimodality chemotherapy (CT). With the prolonged survival, there are comlications due to myetosupression & desease process.

Seventeen episodes of NE were observed & only after the first 2 courses of CT (13 of 25 after tst, 53%; 4 of 24 after 2nd, 17%). The symptoms existed 3 to 14 days. WBC ranged from 50 to 600 in l~tl (median, 100). The first signs of NE were directly correlated to the beginning of the neutropenia & the recovery of neutrophils led to the disappearance of abdominal recovery of neutrophils led to the disappearance of abdominal pain. The conservative treatment included gastrointestinal tract decompression, broad spectrum antibiotics initially, volume & electrolyte substitution, nutritional support, correction of acid-base balance, symptomatic treatment. Sixteen pts were treated nonoperatively, 1 died. On autopsy the transmural bowel necrosis due to thrombosis of branches of a.mes.sup, was found. The bowel perforation occurred in one patient, he was undergone laparotomy & hemicolonectomy & survived. We conclude that NE is a frequent complication in neutropenic pts with the st. lII& IV of B-NHL. It occurs after the induction courses of CT. Close observation by surgeons, oncologists & pediatric intensivists is mandatory. Conservative treatment is effective & more preferable until leucopenia resolves. Operation is necessary only for those.with perforation.",

Today intestinal perfusion, hypoperfusion , cell damage caused by reperfusion injury, bacterial and toxin translocation are serious problems in critically ill patients at an ICU. Paediatric intensive care physicians put major concern on intestinal perfusion, which for. instance gains more and more importance, especially in the neonatal period for example as an etiologic factor for necrotizing enterocolitis. We established an animal model, in which we measured intestinal perfusion by NIRS under various invasive and noninvasive conditions. Methods and results will be referred. For preliminary conclusion we propose Near Infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) also as a potent diagnostic tool to determine early intestinal malperfusion in order to prevent lethal outcome. Fm'ther investigations in animals as well in paediatric iritensive care patients should be done to estimate our efforts. Introduction: Following the acute phase of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) starvation of the gut for a period up to 3 weeks is a generally accepted treatment modality in many centres. Objective criteria to refeed these patients are hardly available. Recently the double sugar test has become available as a parameter for (ab)normal gut permeability ~'2. Aim of the study: To evaluate the changes in permeability of the small bowel in patients with NEC and controls before introduction of enteral feeding. Methods: A lactulose! rbarrmose (I/r) test was performed in two groups. Group 1 was studied 2-3 times within a 5-week period of starvation (n=5, mean gest. age 35, range 31-40 weeks). In group 2 seven different control patients were studied (mean gest.age 33, range 28-38 weeks). The test was performed by giving a patient after at least a 4 hour fast 1 ml/kg bodyweight l/r solution and determination of the 1/r ratio in a 4-hour urine sample by chromatography. Results: Objective: To evaluate the prognostic factors in the response to nitric oxide (NO) in children with Acute Respirator/ Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and/or pulmonary hypertension (PHT). Patients and methods: 23 critically ill children received NO inhaled for AnDS and/or PHT treatment. 14 patient before and after cardiac surgery (2 cardiac transplants), 5 with bronchopneu~onia, 2 multiple trauma, 1 sepsis and 1 cardiorespiratory arrest. 15 patients showed /J~DS and 8 PHT, in 4 with associated ARDS.",

Today there are several therapeutic facilities coming up for these infants. ECMO progranunes have been introduced in severul centres as well as improved venlllatory techniques, as high frequency oscillatory ventilatior~ (HFOV), which provides adequate ventilation with less risk for hmg injury.. In 1987, the endothelium derived relaxing factor was identified as nitric oxide (NO), and extensive studies have sho~-a that inhaled NO reduces pnimonm3 o vascular resistance and improves oxygenation in hypoxic infants with pulmona~ hypertension. Material.. From July 1994 to January 1996, we have treated 13 severely hypoxic children with combined ttFOV-NO. Seven were newborn, 3 with CDH, one with MAS, one with IRDS, one with paediatric ARDS due to RSV infection and one with poor oxygenation atler open heart surgery. 6 were between 1 month and 9 years and all had ARDS of differentorigin but one who was hypoxic after open heart surgery. Method: HFOV was given by means of SensorMedics 3100A oscillatory ventilator to 12 patients, and Dr~ger Babylog 8000 was used in one case. Mean airway pwssures varied from 10-34 cm H20. Oscillatory pressures varied from 25-85 cm H20 and ventilatory rates from 6-15 Hz. Fi O2 varied from 0,21 -1,0. NO was administered by NOMIUS classic.

Apart from its vasodilative properties nitric oxide appears to act also in physiologic immune defense. Intracetlular concentrations of NO synthesized by macrophages are in the range of 103 above those produced by vascular endothelium. We investigated the bacteriostatic effect of nitric oxide at concentrations used during inhaled therapy for pulmonary vasodilation in neonates.

            "text": "We conclude that nitric oxide has a selective bacteriostatic effect on some of the most often trachealb, isolated bacteria in premature infants and neonates. This effect appears to be dose-dependant and occurs in the upper range of dosages used with inhaled NO therapy. Further research is required in order to examine the mechanisms of action as well as specific interactions between different strains of bacteria and nitric oxide. The No,Box monitor (Bedfont, Kent, UK) is used to monitor nitric oxide (NO) and nitdc dioxide (NO 2) during NO administration in ventilated neonates. According to the manufacturers specifications the monitor can be applied in cases where airway pressures range from 5 to 50 mbar. We investigated in-vitro the accuracy of the NO monitor in a range of ventilatory conditions. Using a Dr~ger Babylog 8000 we ventilated an artificial lung. NO was administered {800 ppm NO in 100% nitrogen) with a mass flow controller to the inspiratory tube, at a distance of 20 cm from the Y-piece. The NO target value was set to 10 ppm. The ventilator was operated in both CPAP and IPPV modes at different settings. The NO sampling tube was placed on two different locations; in the inspiratory tube dose to the Y-piece; in the expiratory tube haft way between the Y-piece and the ventilator. The NO-monitor was ca)ibrated with 84 ppm NO at 30 mbar. Fig. 1 and 2 show the sensitivity of the NO-monitor for respectively static pressure (CPAP) and pulsatile pressure (IPPV) with the sampling tube located in the inspiratory tube. Fig. 3 shows the resuR for pulsatile pressure with sampling in the expiratory tube. We conclude that the accuracy of the Bedfont NO-monitor is dependent upon airway pressure and sampling site, the latter possibly caused by incomplete mixing, Pressure and NO are linearly related when sampling occured further away from the administration site. Based on this study we suggest to place the sampling tube in the expiratory tube. During neonatal care the clinician should be aware of varying inaccuracies depending on the respiratory pressures. Hypothesis: Availability of therapy with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) decreases ECMO use in patients referred .to a tertiary care hospital for treatment of respiratory, failure unresponsive to conventional therapies. Background: At Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (CHW) treatment for patients who have failed conventional treatment for respiratory failure, sometimes called \"rescue\" therapy, has included ECMO since 1986 and high frequency oscillatory ventilation since 1992. iNO has been in experimental use at CHW since May of I994 and has resulted in the perception of a decreased need for ECMO therapy in those patients referred for rescue therapy. This study was designed to tbst the validity of that perception. Study Type: Retrospective cohort. Methods: The medical records of all 105 patients referred to CHW from 1/lj93 to 4/1/95 for rescue therapy for severe respiratory failure were included in the chart review. Data were collected regarding diagnoses, illness severity, hospital course including interventions and complications, and outcomes. Exclusion criteria w~ere the finding of structural heart disease or congenital diaphragmatic hernia as the basis for hypoxemia. Qualification for iNO treatment included an A-aDO2 -600 or OI ~-40 for two hours or -> 25 for twelve hours and echocardiographic demonstration of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Patients were classified into two groups based on the availability of iNO at the time of their hospitalization. Results: In the time period of the study, 105 patients were referred for possible ECMO therapy. Twelve patients greater than 4 weeks old, 31 with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and 12 with congenital heart disease were excluded from this analysis, leaving 50 patients for study, iNO availability reduced ECMO use from 16 of 34 (47%) patients in the ~iNO unavailable\" group to 2 out of 16 (12.5%) patients in the \"iNO available\" group, p=&026 by Fisher's exact test. The fact that the two groups were composed of patients of similar severity of illness is reflected by comparable rates of ECMO and iNO rescue therapy (47% vs. 56%). Conclusion: By providing an alternative rescue therapy, iNO has reduced the need for ECMO in this group of neonates referred for respiratory failure. Introduction: true hepatnrenal syndrome (HIS) is defined an acute renal failure {ARF) in the presence of severe liver disease without other known causes of renal failure. HRS is frequently seen in the course of hepatic cirrhosis\u2022 In children, cirrhosis is rare; however, ARF can be seen in combination with aseites and liver dysfunction\u2022 We describe 3 patients with hepatic dysfunction and aseites in combination with AR~ and abnormal sodium-water handling, leading to the diagnosis of HRS. Pathophysiology: three factors are considered in the pathogenesis of HR~: I) hepatic dysfunction, 2) deranged hemodynamics, including abnormal blood pressure, reduced effective arterial blood volume and abnormal blood flew distribution, and 3) neuro-humoral dysrsgulatiom, including elevated levels of aldosteron, renin, angiotensin-ll, ADE, vasodilatim 9 nitric oxide and vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-l. The main pathogenetic feature is decreased cortical renal blood flow, decrease of glomerulur filtration rate (GFR), vastly increased sodium retention, uliguria, and azotemia. Treatment: therapy is based on counteracting sodium and fluid retention by highdose aldosteron antagonists and loop diuretics, improving renal perfusion by lowdose dopamin, and strict restriction of fluid and sodium. Interventions as paracenteals of aacites or n peritoneo-systemic shunt are associated with high morbidity and poor outcome in children. Reversal of HEm by conservative measures can only be attained at early stages of HRL Liver transplantation is the only definitive treatment that can reverse ERE at advanced stages. Patients: the described patients developed severe ascites with insidious renal dysfunction and abnormal sodium-water handling during admission at PICU and fullfilled clinical criteria fur HRS. Treated according to the cited principles, all patients showed improvement of GFR, with increased natriuresis and gradual decrease of ascites. Eventually, renal function normalised completly. Conclusion: ERE deserves greater recogmitimn in the PICU population; diagnosis can be suspected on clinical criteria. With this increased awareness, therapy tun be instituted at an early phase, with better prospects for recovery. Positive outcome of HEm depends on early recognition of the clinical picture, understanding of the pathophysiology, and early institution of consistent treatment. MTX is an antimetatxflite widely used as chemotherapeutic agents. High dose iVITX (I to 30~m2) administered as a prolonged intravenous infusion (over 4-42 hours), is often used to treat malignant paediatric diseases. Major complications of this treatment are myelosuppression, orointestinal mucositis, dermatitis and impairment of anal function. We report two cases of MTX overd~age occurred in two children (5-year-old. 14 month-old) t~ted for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. They were treated by CAVH and the MTX bhK~d levels rapidly decreasedavoiding multisystemic involvement. Establishment of alkaline diuresis and monitoring of plasma MTX levels during treatment is essential to prevent nephrotoxicity. However. leuco',cnn rescue may not prevent the development of potentially lethal toxicities in patients with MTX concentrations persistantl} exceeding t0mM. In theses cases, em'ly treatment of MTX intoxication may pm~cnt myelosuppression and reducerenal damage. The goal is to lower the concentration to below 10 mmoLL, at which time rescue agents aleme would be expected to be cllcctive. Respective indications of these remo',at mctNy.:is are still discussed : Hacmt~ialysis t~ eharc(~l haemoperfusion should be prolx',sed for massive and acute intoxication. However, rebound has been reported after combined hcmodialysis and hemoperfusion. Exchange transfusion may be proposed as a treatment for prolonged and moderate intoxication. Peritoneal dialysis is an incflbedve method for remo~ al of MTX. CAVH was used in our ICU. CAVH is a simple method for blood purification and N':dy iluid control. Use of CAVH was never be reported in this indication to our knowledge. Simplicity, rap~d application and gco.l clinical tolerance are the main advantages of this technique. The technique presents ~peclal advantages in terms of low priming volume of extracorporeal circuit, low blood flow, low rate heparinisation. Our results show a decreaseof plasma MTX concentration and a rapid reduction of halfqite of elimination (t5 hours over the period of CAVH). Moreover, we didn't delec~d rebound after stopping prc,xedure. Small size of the I:ratients may present sometime special problems, but these technical problems can be overcome, No severe complication (Needing, inlection) were observed during filtration, In summary, aggressive intravenous fluid hydration and alkaliniaation of the urine coupled with careful monitoring of renal function and plasma MTX concentrations during and al'tcr infusion along with lem~overin rescue has reduced the inNdcace of life-threatening toxicity after highdose MTX. However, some MTX inu>xication still occurred, leading to se~em toxicity, particularly nephrotoxicity. In these cases, we think that CAVH (or CAVHD) is a reliable, rapid method without rcIx~und increase in plasma MTX concentration or important adverses effects compared to other procedure removal.",

Venovenous hemofiltration (VVHF) and hemodiafiltration (VVHDF) were performed with a new neonatal hemo(dia)filter (Miniflow 10, Hospal) on 8 anesthetized rabbits infused with branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) and c~-keto-isocaproate. The BCAA and aketo-isocaproate blood levels were close to those previously observed in neonates with MSUD when extracorporeal blood purification was required. VVHF and VVHDF performances were assessed with two different blood flows (Qb = 8.3 and 16.6 mL/min). VVHDF was performed with 4 dialysate flow rates (Qd = 0,5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 L/h). Thus, each animal was submitted to 10 successive procedures. Within each studied period, clearances of the 3 BCAA were strictly similar. BCAA clearances obtained by VVHF were similar to ultrafiltrate rates (respectively, 0.78 4-0.14 and 1.79 4-0.28 mL/min at high and low Qb ; p < 0.05). The ~x-keto-isocaproate clearances obtained by VVHF were 0.39 4-0.17 and 0.92 4-0.43 mL/min at low and high Qb (not significantly different). Whatever Qd value, the VVHDF procedures always allowed higher BCAA and c~-keto-isocaproate clearances as compared with the corresponding V'~HF period with similar Qb. BCAA clearances obtained by VVHDF with a 0.5 L/h dialysate flow, were 4.1 4-0.5 mlJmin and 5.4 4-0.5 mL/min at Iow and high Qb, respectively. The concurrent a-keto-isocaproate clearances were 2.5 4-,. 0,8 mL/min and 2.9 _+ 1,0 mL/min. At both Qb regimens, BCAA clearances provided by VVHDF were markedly higher than values previously obtained with peritoneal dialysis in human neonates with MSUD. The management of renal failure in the newborn is difficult. When dialysis is instituted peritoneal dialysis (PD) is usually the technique of choice. This is can be problematic and impossible in some patients with pre-existing intra-abdominal pathology. Continuous arterio-venous haemofiltration (CAVH) has been described in infants but sick preterm infants are not able to support the circuit. I have devised a means of having pumped haemofiltration in small/preterm infants (PHIS/PI) and describe its use in nine patients ranging in size from 750 to 3000gms for periods of 1 to 7 days. Vascular access was achieved through 24 or 22 guage cannulae in either a peripheral artery and a central vein or through two central veins. Blood was pumped out using an IVAC 572 infusion pump and through a Gambro FH22 haemofilter. A second IVAC pump was used to remove haemofiltrate from the filter and a third to infuse replacement solution.",

One recovered renal function but died some weeks later from unrelated problems, three survived and recovered renal function and one patient is still on treatment. This system allows a secure means of achieving fluid and electrolyte control in the preterm infant. The use of this technique may allow haemofiltration to become as applicable to preterm infants as it is to older children and adults. Unibrtunately, children often receive no treatment, or inadequate treatment for pain and painful procedures. This prospective, multicentric study focuses on the efficacy, safety and side effects of Novalgin (Metamizol sodium) for this indication. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Novalgin was administered to 56 children, aged between 6-16 years, with acute, postoperative or procedural pain. Novalgin (10-15 mg/kg) was given 6-8 hourly IV or IM respectively, in some cases (15) in combination with opioids (Tramadol 10, Piritramid 3, Butorphanol 2). The pain relief was assessed by six-step Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) from 0 to 5, Vital signs were monitored, the side effects, that occured were recorded. RESULTS: Pain relief was good (VRS less 2) in 53 children -94.6 % of study patients. Novalgin was very well tolerated, only one patient had adverse reaction -hyperpyrexia following intravenous application of the drug. DISCUSSION: Novalgin (Metamizol sodium) is safe and effective drug in the management of acute pain in children with low incidence of side effects.

The observations using the CS (more complex) didnk show differences when compared with the VAS. Effects of age, concurrent administration of other pharmacologic agents, and disease [cardiac(n=31) & pulmonary(n=22)] on the PK & PD of B were evaluated in volume overloaded infants aged 4 days-6 mo (n=53). Single doses of 0.005,0.01,0.015,0.02,0.025, 0,03, 0.035,0.05 & 0.10 mg/kg IV were given over 1-2 min after baseline evaluation. Age was used as a continuous vadable to determine its effects on the variability in the PK & PD of B. Values for PK parameters were compared between patients in cardiac and pulmonary disease groups. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to determine the effects of age, disease and other pharmacologic agents on the variability of bumetanide excretion rate (BER) and PD responses, e.g. urine flow rate (UFR) & electrolyte excretion. CIT, CIR & CINR increased with age (p<0.05) while t,2decreased markedly in the first monthe of life (p<0.05). BER normalized for dose increased with increasing age. Patients with pulmonary disease exhibited significantly greater clearance and shorter t~= (p<0.05) than those with cardiac disease whereas Vd~ was similar in both groups. The administered dose of B was the primary determinant of BER but increasing age also contributed. Penicillin antibiotics decreased BER. Dose response curves for UFR and electrolyte excretion were similar between disease groups. More of the variability in BER and PD responses could be accounted for in the pulmonary group than the cardiac group but this was not statistically significant. Conclusion: The PK of bumetanide were influenced significantly by age and disease. Differences in PK between patients with pulmonary and cardiac disease were primarily due to differences in total clearance. Age and the administered dose of B were positive determinants of BER and PD responses while penicillin antibiotics had a negative impact on both, Once B reached its site of action, no differences in PD responses were detected between disease groups. The pharmacodynamic effects of bumetanide were evaluated in volume overloaded infants (n=56) aged 4 days-6 months. Single doses of 0.005, 0.01,0.015, 0.02, 0,025, 0.03, 0.035, 0.05 & 0.10 mg/kg IV were given over 1-2 rain. Bumetanide concentration in blood (n=l 0) & urine (n=6) samples were quantified by HPLC. Baseline urine samples were collected over 2-4 hours prior to drug administration. Determinations of urine volume, electrolytes (Na \", K +, CI, Ca ++ and Mg++), creatinine and osmolality were performed before and at 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-6 and 6-12 hours after bumetanide dosing. Changes in urine flow rate and electrolyte excretion were plotted as a function of bumetanide excretion rate which was considered the effective dose of the drug. Peak bumetanide excretion rate increased linearly with increasing doses of drug and showed no evidence of approaching a maximum. Time course patterns for urine flow rate and electrolyte excretion were similar for all dosage groups. Urine flow rate and electrolyte excretion increased lineady up to a bumetanide excretion rate of approximately 7 #g/kg/hr and either plateaued (urine flow rate) or declined at bumetanide excretion rates > 10 #g/kg/hr. Bumetanide had no detectable effect on serum electrolyte concentrations, Conclusion: Maximal diuretic responses occurred at a bumetanide excretion rate of about 7 ;~g/kg/hr. Higher bumetanide excretion rates produced no increased diuretic effect. Peak bumetanide excretion rate of about 7 #g/kg/hr corresponded to bumetanide doses of 0.035-0.050 mg/kg.",

Methods: we simulate infusion of Teico with a syrlnge-pump (Pilot C, Becton & Dickinson Lab.) trough d standart neonatal I.V. system. For 2 weights (1 or 3 kg) we used 2 doses of Teico (8 mg and 16 mg/kg) and a dose volume _<4.2 ml. Our goal was to perform a complete infusion in 10 minutes. The infusion system consisted of an Life Care 4 infusion pump (ABBOTT Lab.) with its LV. set for maintenance intravenous fluid (flow _< 6 ml/h) connected to a 3-way stopcock. An 1 meter extension tubing was placed between the stopcock and a neonatal catheter. An another 1 meter tubing (injection tubing) connected the Teicoplanine syringe to the stopc, ock. The volume of the injection circuit (from the syringe to the distal part of the catheter was 2.6 mL 4 methods of injections were assessed: A: Injection of the predetermined volume of Teico in 10 minutes with no wash out. B: Idem as A but the Teico was injected in 5 minutes, followed by a wash out (5 ml / 5 minutes). C: Twice the required volume was introduced in the syringe and the volume to infuse was programed in 5 minutes, followed by a wash out (5 ml/5 minutes). D: ]dem as C but a priming was performed before connecting theTeico syringe to the tubing. During each run, serial samples were collected every ten minutes over a one hour period. The samples were assessed using HPLC method. Results: the amount of drug delivred at 10 minutes were calculated. The results are a mean of 2 to 6 runs and expressed as the percentage of the total amount of Teico prescribed.",

            "text": "Cytokine patterns during and after cardiac surgery in young children. Especially in children, cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) can cause a systemic inflammatory response. This process is thought to be mainly a result of inflammation induced by surgery and exposure of blood to an artificial surface, and of reperfusion injury during weaning of bypass. Complement activation, degranulation of granulocytes, induction of free oxygen radicals, endotoxemia and release of cytokines, are important contributing factors. We studied cytokine patterns before, during and after CPB in young children admitted for complex surgery or for septal defect correction. In the first group, significant amounts of IL-6 and IL-lra could be detected preoperatively. These findings could reflect the already existing hemodynamic dysregutation. In both groups, CPB procedure upregulated the circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6/8, but not IL-1B. At the same time, IL-lra became detectable. Therefore, we suggest that in these patients the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-ira was not induced by the preceding acnvity ot pro-inflammatory cytoidnes. During CPB, we noticed a sharp decline in the capacity of the leucocytes to secrete IL-6/8. The ex-vivo production of IL-lra however, was only slightly attenuated. We conclude that there is a differential regulatory pathway for the induction of IL-6/8 and IL-lra. In addition, we studied the influence of dexamethasone administration on the cytokine pattern. Administration delayed the appearance of IL-6/8 and IL-Ira in the plasma, Interestingly, it did only interfere with the ex-vivo production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The latter supports our hypothesis that production of IL-6/8 and of IL-lra is regulated by two independent pathways, (60%) of 43 pts. 82% ofpts < 12 months of age developed metabolic alkalosis as compared with 38% ofpts > 12 months of age.The infants with metabolic alkalosis received more citrated blood products and furosemide. Following cardiac pulmonary bypass the highest pH-values and BE-values were observed 24-48 hours and 48-72 hours, respectively. II. prospective study: Metabolic alkalosis was registerd in 2t children (70%), 8 of those <12 month (75%) developed metabolic alkalosis and 67% of those elder than 12 monms.Durmg the postoperative course patients younger than 12 months developed the highest pH-and base excess values after 102 and t05 hours, in the subset of the older patients maximum pH and base excess was found after 48 and 81 hours, respectively. In one case the top level ofpH-value exceeded 7.6, the base excess +20 mvalB. Conclusion: Children undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass often develop metabolic alkalosis.In contrast to previous reports, we did not observe an association between metabolic alkalosis and mortality, nor greater frequency of cardiac arrythmias or prolonged mechanical ventilation. In context with decreasing serum lactate levels, our data show positive correlation of metabolic alkalosis with postoperative improvement of liver function.",

Patients with diaphragm paralysis and those who failed W because of upper airway obstruction were excluded. Before patient extubation the following measurements were recorded during spontaneous ventilation (CPAP/T piece) using the CP 100 Neonatal Pulmonary Monitor BICORE (lrvine, CA): total respiratory system static compliance (CSSR) and resistance (RTS), rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI). Maximal inspiratory negative pressure (Pi max) was measured using an unidirectional expiratory valve. Threshold values predicting W success (Ws) were: CSSR > 0.5 ml/cm H20, RTS < 75 cm H20 /L/sec, RSBI 160 and Pi max > -30 cm t120. W failures (Wf) -patient reintubation within the following 48 hs, These values were compared between W success and failures using Fisher exact test. An apriori level of statistical significance was chosen at p < 0.05. 4 considered, an increase in TNF-a levels is observed after cardiac surgery (p<0.001) with a return to previous values after 24 hours (p<0.005). 72 hours after CPB, similar values are observed in groups II and Ill, but there is a further increase in serum TNF-a levels in group I when compared with both other groups (p<0.03). We found no statistically differences in any other moment. There was a significant correlation between serum TNF-o levels determined 72 hours after surgery and CPB duration (p<0,003). Conclusions: CPB in childhood provokes a significant increase in serum TNFa levels, In newborns the inflammatory response is maintained 72 hours after surgery. This enhancement of serum TNF-e levels indicates the existence of a relevant inflammatory response in these patients. Introduction: Cardiac surgery appears to induce a systemic inflammatory response. We have investigated the behaviour of IL-1 I~ and IL-6 before and after cardiac surgery. Patients and methods: We studied serum IL-1 6 and IL-6 levels from 20 children with congenital heart disease (10 boys and 10 girls), aged from 7 days to 14 years, undergoing open heart surgery, before CPB (D We found no statistically differences in the IL-I levels in the different groups and moments. There is a significant increase in IL-6 immediately after surgery (p<0,01) with similar levels 24 hours after CPB and a significant decrease (p<0.01) 72 hours after CPB. Preoperatory IL-6 levels were higher in the groups I and tl than in group I11 (p<0.05). 24 hours after CPB serum IL-6 levels in group 1 were significantly higher when compared with group 111 (p<0.05). Conclusions: CPB in childhood induces a significant transient increase in serum IL-6 levels, strongly relevant in newborns. CPB was not associated to a significant modification in serum IL-1 6 levels. Thus, CPB in childhood induces a dissociated behaviour in the proinflammatory IL-6 and IL-1 & pathways. Obiective, To evaluate the effects of AMG receipt on the clinical condition during the first 12 hours after birth (t2), the morbidity and mortality in immature outborn neonates. Methods. We studied 44 outborn neonates with GA 26 to 29 wks, admitted during the years 1993 to 1995. Eighteen neonates exposed to AMG (GA:27,6+lwks, BW: 1066_+195g) and 26 neonates did not (GA: 27,7_+1wks, BW: 1042_+187g). Results. AMG-exposed neonates compared to those not exposed had lower incidence of Apgar score at 5 min _< 3 (6% vs 35%, p<.05), lower incidence of PH t2 <7.20 (11% vs 48%, p<.05), decrease need of bicarbonate 12 (22% vs 54%, p<.05), lower FIO212 (FiO212min>40: 17% vs 48%, p<.05 and FiO212max >80: 17% vs 52%, p<.05), lower incidence of intubation (67% vs 92%, p<.05), lower requirements of surfactant (50% vs 79%, p<.05) and lower mortality (11% vs 50% p<.01). There were no differences between the two groups for the following parameters: type of delivery, hypothermia hypoglycemia and anemia during admission, hypernatremia, hypotension 12 (MAP<30mmHg), need of dopamine and or plasma 12, incidences of PTX PDA sepsis NEC severe ROP major IVH (plus PVL) and BPD and duration of intubation. Conclusions. The main beneficial effects of AMG receipt on the immature outborn neonates were the decrease of mortality and the decrease of surfactant need. There was no effect of AMG receipt upon other severe morbidity in this high risk group of neonates.",

Mattco -Pavia, Italy latrogenic esophageal perforations (IEP) in preterm and term infants are seldom reported in litteraturc, in association with difficult endotracheal (ET) intubation (with or without stylets), insertion of gastric tube, and pharyngeal suctioning with stiff catheters. Crieopharyngeal muscle spasm caused by instrumentation may also lead m a narrowing of lumen, with increased risk of local injury. We report 4 IEP observed in intubatcd, mechanically ventilated newborn infants (2 male, 2 female, all outborn). A common feature of IEP was inability to pass a nasogastric (NG) tube into the stomach, mimicking e~)phageal atresia.~se 1: birth weight (BW) 185(I g, gestational age (GA) 37 wk, sepsis. Before admission to N1CU, the baby underwent multiple ET inmbations, because of inappropriate securing of ET robe. Bloody secretions in pharynx were observed. The endoscopy showed a large lesion at the end of proximal third of the esophagus, Case 2: BW 1080 g, GA 32 wk, RDS. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed a retrostcrnal air leak: the NG tube was stopped }~etwcen D8 and D9 and soluble contrast was seen in upper mediastinum.Case 3: BW 76(/g, GA 26 wk, RDS.

Surgical intervention is needed in case of mediastinitis or mediastinal abscess: conservative management included broad spectrum antibiotics, total parenteral nutrition, antireflux therapy and, if necessary, drainage of air leaks. Enteral feeding has been stopped lor 15 days and cautiously resumed after radiographic study. [x~cal sequelae and death are uncommon, but IEP occur in newborns with high risk of death due to prematurity and other diseases. In our patients, ET intubation has been performed by experienced personnel: therefore the lack of skills in resu~itative procedures is not always the main factor of IEP. Prevention of IEP requires appropriate materials (ET tubes, laryngoscope blades, suction catheters), and procedures (positioning of the infant with correct neck estension, firm ET placement). Sedation and pain control may help to prevent the muscle spasm. Aggressive treatment has improved the tong-term outcome of extremely low birth weight neonates (ELBW) but it has also increased the chances of iatrogenic lesions. Reviewing the charts of our neonates we observed a high number of vascular injuries. From 1987 to 1994, 2898 neonates were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU); 335 of them were ELBW (11.5%). Studying the charts of these ELBW we observed 9 cases (4 M -5 F) with vascular lesions (2.6%). Mean gestational age of these patients was 28.7 weeks (rain 24-max33). Mean weight at birth was 880g . Mean weight at diagnosis was 1825g (1230-2700). In the same period 10 patients with vascular injuries were reported in the 2563 neonates over 1500g (0.3%). The injuries observed in ELBW group were: 6 arteriovenous fistula (2 bilateral) at femoral,level, 1 carotid lesion and 2 limb ischemic lesions. Aetiology was in 7 cases by venipuncture, in one case umbilical catheter and in the case of carotid lesion a wrong surgical maneuver. No general simptoms were observed. The vessels were repaired with microsurgical technique in six cases: the carotid lesion and five arteriovenous fistula; one case was solved with thrombolitic drugs; an amputation at knee level was required in one case after a long period of medical treatment. The last neonate with an arteriovenous fistula was only observed for parent's will. At follow-up (clinical and by ecodoppler) 7 out of 9 neonates presented normal vascular function without sequelae. From our experience ELBW neonates have more chances than older neonates to develop iatrogenic vascular lesions. We advocate an aggressive microsurgery and/or medical treatment to obtain good results and prevent late sequelae.",

Aim: Retrospective comparison of Alvofact (in 1993) versus Survanta (in 1994) as rescue treatment for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Methods: Both surfactants were given at an initial dose of 100 mg/kg (except for Alvofact 50 mg/kg for mild RDS grade MI). Repeat doses were attowed (Survanta 100 mg/kg, Alvofact 50 mg/kg) up to a maximum of 200 mg/kg, All parameters and outcome criteria were strictly defined beforehand. The initial response (good,mild,no response,relapse) to surfactam therapy was defined on the basis of the decrease in FiO 2. Results: There were no signif. differences in patient population and initial parameters: GA (29.9+_2.2 vs 29A _+2,6 wks), birth weight (t332_+431 vs 1227-+444 g), severity of RDS (grade Ill-IV: 78.6% vs 80.3%), Apgar scores, cord blood gases, initial ventilatory settings. In '93 however, the initial surfactant dose was administered earlier than in '94 (14.4-+ 17.4 vs 6.5_+7.8 hrs postpartum, p= 0.025). Although the average total cumulative dose was equal in '93 and '94 (169.3-+65,8 vs 167.4_+69 .4 mg/kg), more doses of Alvofact were given compared to Survanta {2.3_+1.1 vs 1.7_+0.6, p=O.O01) and more patients in '93 received more than two doses than in '94 (46% vs 18 % of patients).

Introduction: Haemorrhages, particularly intracranial, are major complications experienced in 10-35% of neonates treated with extracorporeal circulation. An induced thrombocytopenia and impaired platelet function play a key role in the increased bleeding tendency observed in these patients. The aim of the present study was to establish a dose-respons curve for the effect of a synthetic protease inhibiting agent, Nafamostat Mesilate (FUT-175), on platelet membrane glycoprotein density and platelet activation during experimental perfusion. Methods: Two identical Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS) circuits were primed with fresh, heparinized human blood and circulated for 24 h. Four different concentrations of FUT-175 (7.12 mg/L blood/h; 14.25 mg/L/h; 14.25 mg/L/h+25% bolus at the start of the perfusion and 2&5mg/L/h+25% bolus) were used in different perfusion experiments. A total of eight paired experiments were performed. Platelet count, plasma betathromboglobulin levels and platelet membrane density of glycoprotein Ib and lib/Ilia were followed as well as plasma concentration of haemoglobin. Results: A protective effect of the agent on platelet count, plasma concentration of BTG and platelet membrane GPIb could be observed during the first 3 hours of the perfusion when a bolus dose was added. No positive effect could be recorded with the two lower doses used. Plasma concentration of haemoglobin was higher in all the FUT-circuits compared to the control circuits. Conclusion: The addition of a bolus dose of FUT-175 at the start of the perfusion seem to induce a protective effect on platelets during the first hours of perfusion. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (EMCO) is a form of invasive cardiopulmonary support that can provide imporary physiologic stabilisation in reversible circulatory failure and or respiratory failure.",

We used a questionnaire incorporating questions on the theory and clinical uses of the pulse oximeter to assess understanding of pulse oximetry in medical and paramedical staff Doctors indicated grade, speciality, pulse oximetry tuition and neonatology experience. 45 doctors, 15 ITU nurses, t9 medical students and 4 physiotherapists completed the questionnaire. Some confusion existed between the principles of pulse oximetry and transcutaneous oxygen measurement. Wide variations in the lowest acceptable saturation in fit children were seen (80-95%), with around 20% of respondents in all groups accepting values of 90% or less. Some potentially serious mistakes were made in the evaluation of oxygen saturations in the clinical scenarios. There were widespread variations in correct responses at all grades of medical staffing. Nurses scored well on more clinically-orientated questions but relatively poorly on theory. Only 15% of doctors (mostly senior grades) had received tuition in putse oximetry. Neonatology rotations appeared to confer little additional knowledge on pulse oximetry. Few doctors and nurses receive tuition in the use of pulse oximetry A significant proportion of nurses and doctors, of all grades, exhibited a lack o{\" understanding of the principles of pulse oximetry. This may result in unsafe use of the equipment and put patients at risk. One can see from the table that blood composition in Uv and Ua differens in some characteristics, and similar in SGP magnitude. Venous-asterlal gradients \"gas functiomals\" between Uv and Ua represent the measure of difference in this characteristics. The gradient cari be positive, zero -order or negative and change both in value and in sign but not reach APO2 (positive) and APCO2 (negative) in absolute significance.Minimization of \"gas functionals\" deviations atom the zero is achieved due to\"mutual replacement acts\" between PO2 and PCO2 in Uv and Ua blood. We suggest that presented tests can be useful in full evaluation of gas exchange in newborns. (PAP) in the context of pulmonary hypertension is oft desired but rarely achieved. inhaled nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to produce this desirable effect, but is relatively difficult to administer or monitor. We wondered whether NP, chemicaIly related to NO but more stable in solution, would produce similar physiologic effects when administered in the convenient modality of nebulization. Methods: 9 piglets were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and surgically instrumented. Systemic blood pressure (BP), PAP, and cardiac output (CO) were monitored continuously. After postoperative stabilization, 0.9% NaC} nebulization was begun, and pulmonary hypertensiorr was induced by reducing FiO2 from 0.30 to 0.07. The piglets were monitored for 15 minutes during this hypoxic phase, Next, without altering FiO2 or ventilator settings, NP (10 mg/ml, dissolved in 0.9% NaCl, flow 4 Ipm) was substitued for 0.9% NaCl in the nebulizer circuit. NP was nebulized for 15 mins. Results: During hypoxia, PaO2 fell from 159 to 29 mm Hg. PAP rose during hypoxia from 14 to 31 torr (p< 0.01). ,^fhile BP and CO did not change significantly. PAP fell during nebulized NP in each piglet, (mean APAP = 31 to 21 torr; p< 0.01; mean reduction of hypoxia-induced rise in PAP = 61%; range: 36 to 78%; p < 0.01). PVR/SVR fell by 28% during NP nebulization (p< 0.01), while BP and CO did not fall significantly (90 to 86 tort; 653 to 636 mLlkg-min), The reduction in PAP began within 2 minutes of the onset of nebulized NP, and appeared to reach a plateau by 15 minutes. No tachyphylaxis to nebulized NP was noted. Nebulized NP did not significantly affect PAP, BP, or CO under normoxic conditions. Conclusions: 1) Like NO, NP selectively reduced hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension without altering systemic BP, 2 ) Unlike NO, NP can be administered by nebulizer, a technique familiar to virtually all health-care providers, and potentially adaptable to both intubated and non-intubated patients. 3 } Nebulized NP may be beneficial in clinical contexts where inhaled NO is impractical.",

By an emergency operation, 500ml of diluted blood were drained. Purulent pericarditis and pleural effusion appeared at the same time but at first tile symptoms of purulent pericarditis were masked by the predominant symptoms of plearal efihsion. After the pleura was drained, its pus was no more, the general state was relatively stabilized but there still were big liver, dyspnea, enlargement of the cardiac silhouette while central venous pressure increased. Purulent pericarditis appeared late. In the first stage (about 2 weeks) there was no suspected sign. Later on gradually appeared such symptoms as dyspnea (during serum transfusion for instance). Central veinous pressure also raised. The heart chest diametre increased at first (up to 60-65%) then decreased (down to below 50% ) but the liver kept on swelling together with the particular changes of electroeaediegramme. Now the pericardium had no more pus but get fibrous (up to 3ram) thus constricting the heart and its main arteries 0ike Pick syndrome). 2.

However, what should be stressed was : the diagnostic values of an electrocardiogram for purulent pericarditis was mainly in the dynamics of their signs: in the first week, the voltage diminished corresponding to a pericardium containing pus, while the ST segment went up then seemed parallel to the fibrosis of the epicardium, the liver swelled, the central velnous pressure increased, the heart/chest dimension ratio decreased, the ST segment went down, the T wave became more flat and inverted. Between 1986 and 1995 23 neonates, aged 2 -23 days (median 5), weight 2,38 -4kg (median 3,28) with critical valvar pulmonary stenosis were scheduled for balloon dilation (PSVP), 19 children (83%) were on PGE1 and 13 (57%) needed mechanical ventilation. After stepwise dilation a final balloon : pulmonary valve (PaV) ratio of 114% (25-150) was achieved, There was a significant correlation (p<0,01) between an adequately sized balloon and freedom of reintervention. Two valves could not be passed, four neonates underwent surgical procedures (brock n = 3, commissurotomy n = 1), two children (10%) died of sepsis. 17/23 patients (73%) were successfully palliated by PSVP in the first month of life. The RV : systemic pressure value fell from 132% (75-231) to 58% (40-87), Complications included 2 transient dysrhythmias, 1 transient hypoxia, 3 vessel occlusions;-1 right ventricular outflow tract perforation. In 16/17 patients follow up data is available. The residual systolic peak doppler gradient over the PaV on the last out patient visit (5-103 months after PSVP) was 10-41 mmHg (median 20). Four children needed repea.ted PSVP 26 to 72 months after the initial intervention.",

            "text": "Conclusion: PSVP of critically ill newborns is possible. The risk of mortality is relatively low. PSVP in neonates with an adequately sized balloon is a challenging alternative to surgical treatment. Post hypoxic-ischemic (HI) reperfusion induces the formation of non protein bound iron (NPBI), leading to production of the reactive hydroxyl radical. It was investigated if the ironchelator deferoxamine (DFO) could reduce free radical production and improve neonatal myocardial performance after HI. Severe HI was produced in 13 newborn lambs and changes from pre-Hl values were measured at 15, 60 and 120 min post-HI for (mean) aortic pressure (mean Pao), cardiac output (CO) and stroke work (SW). Left ventricular (LV) contractility and CO were assessed by measuring LV pressure (tip-manometer) and volume (conductance catheter), using inferior caval vein occlusion to obtain slope (Ees) and intercept of the end systolic PV relationship (V10). NPBI, reduced and oxidized vitamine C ratio (VCred/ox) and lipid peroxidation (MDA) were measured from sinus coronarius blood. 7 Lambs received DFO (10 mg/kg i.v.) immediately post-HI, control lambs (CONT) received a placebo. Results: Mean Pao was stable, CO and SW decreased up to 60 and 40% respectively in CONT as compared to pre-HI. In both DFO-groups CO and SW remained within the normal range. Ees and V10 decreased in all groups post HI, but did not differ between groups. NPBI and MDA were higher at 15 min post HI (p<O.05), VCred/ox was lower at 15 min post-HI (p<O.O5) in CONT as compared to DFO-group, indicating more oxidative stress in CONT. Conclusions: DFO reduced the oxidative stress of the heart and prevented CO and SW to drop, suggesting a positive effect of iron chelation on the myocardium after H{. From 1987 we published reports with analysis of performance of the heart as a whole organ.While analysing the heart performance as a whole, we recognize three block in it located intrapericardially: l.\"atrial\"block -left (LA) and rigth (RA) atriums; 2.\"aorta-pulmonary\" block-aorta 'bulb (A) and pulmonary artery(PA); 3.ventricular \"three-chambered\" block (VB) consisting of: -left (LV) and right (RV) myocardial chambers, both frith blood outflow into \"aorta-pulmonary\" block vessels, and -spongy (venous) myocardial chamber with the blood outflow through coronary sinus (CS) and Thebesiau vein (TV) into \"atrial\" block. The following conceps are introduced for VB functions assessment \"common\" systole and \"common\" diastole of \"three-chambered\" VB. The process of normal \"common\" VB systole: -begins with blood ejection from VB spongy chamber into the \"atrial\" block; -continues with blood outflow from RV and LV into \"aorta-pulmonary\" block wi~ venous minimums -x-coiiapses -~btmation iu \"a~riai\" block; -completes with \"three-chambered\" VB general emptying. At this period the following blood volumes are transferring: -two-from RV and LV(their stroke volumes)into\"aor~o-pulmonary\"block; -two-from \"spongy\" chamber .into \"atrial\" block; -two-from systemic and pulmonary veins into \"atrial\" block during the process of so called \"systolic\" membrane suction (at pulling atrio-ventricular valves into RV and LV chambers as blood ejects out of them). It appears to be the regulation of blood inflow to \"atrial\" block by blond outflow from \"three-chambered\" VB into \"aorto-pulmonary\" block. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and complications of Transpyloric Enteral Nutrition(TEN) in critically ill children Patients and methods~ From June 1994 to January 1996 23 children (I0 boys and 13 girls), aged from 5 days to 11 years (mean l.8 \u00b1 3.4years) were treated with TEN. 18 patients were included after cardiac surgery, 3 with acute respiratory failure, and 2 after cerebral surgery. The indication of TEN was mechanical ventilation in 22 patients and failure of nasogastric nutrition in 1 patient.19 children (82 %) had previously received parenteral nutrition. 8 and I0 FG enteral tubes was inserted into duodenus through nasogastric intubation en 21 patients and by endoscopy in 2 patients. Rx and pH determination were used as methods to control tube situation. 18 children received adapted formula, 7 caseine hidrolisate, and 3 enteral formulas.",

            "text": "(In 5 patients the nutrition formula was changed during TEN). 22 patients were supported with mechanical ventilation during TEN, 17 received midazolamperfussion(range 2 to 15 mcg/kg/min), 15 fentanyl (i -12.5 mcg/kg/h), and 6 vecuronium (0.1 -0.3 mg/kg/h). Resulte: TEN was used during 3 to 73 days (mean 18.3 \u00b1 19.3 days). Mean maximmnvolume ad~iniateredwas 132 \u00b1 47 ml/kg/day (range 34 208) .Patients with midazolam, fentanyl and vecuronitml tolerated TEN similar than children without sedatives. Complications were diarrhoea 1 patient, abdominal distension and/or important gastric fed residuals 2 patients. Pulmonary aspiration or respiratory complications were no registered. TEN was ended in one patient due to diarrhoea, in 18 due to change to oral or nasogastric nutrition, 3 children continue yet with TEN and 1 was discharged of PICUwith TEN. Conolusion: TEN is an useful method of nutritional support in critically Ill children with mechanical ventilation and/or nasogastric intolerance. Introduction: the enteral nutritional support of the critically ill child may reduce the morbidity and mortality by attenuating, the hypermetabolic and catabolic response, decreasing the gut translocation and the septic complications, improving the bowel mucosa integrity and the wound healing. The aim of this study was to show the safety and tolerance of EN. Methods: we enrolled 36 consecutive patients admitted to our Unit from May to December 1995, mean age 3.4 years (range Imonth to I7 years). The PRISM, mechanical ventilation, inotropic use, opiates and other drugs were recorded. The EN was delivered by continuous infusion across a polyuretane tube.We kept the patients head elevated 30 \u00b0, and we used cisapride routinely. The gap betweeen admission and the EN beginning, average time to meet the nutritional objective, EN duration, selected formula, patients outcome and complications were recorded. Results: PRISM groups were 0-1=0 patients; 1-5=1; 5-10=13; 10-15=7; 15-30=12. Two patients with MOF (Multiorgan failure) died. 72% needed mechanical ventilation.The average time elapsed from PICU admission to initiation of EN was 2.1 days (range 1 to 7 ) and the average duration of the EN was 7.3 days (range 3 to t4). The average time to meet the nutritional objective was 2 days (range 1 to 3). The selected formula were: lactose free infant formula in 10 patients, elemental diet in 8, Pediasure in 16 and Jevity in 2. We recorded vomiting in 4 patients, diarrhea in 5 and constipation in 4. None of them forced the EN suspension. We didn't recorded any case of ~spiration or pneumonia. We found no relation between drugs, selected formula and complications. We think that EN may be a safe and well tolerated procedure at the PICU setting. Generation of free radicals in Iipid emulsions used in parenterai nutrition (PN) has been described recently. This seems to be due to high polyunsaturated fatty acid content. We studied lipoperoxidation status and antioxidant parameters presurgically and through the postoperative period (5 days) in a group of twelve children (ranging from 4 months to 12 years of age), who underwent heart surgery and received nutritional support with PN. Malondiaidehyde (MDA), an end product of lipid peroxidation was used as a marker of oxidative stress. It was determined by the Yagi spectrofluorometric method. Antioxidant activity was measured with an assay based on the inhibition of spontaneous autooxidation of a brain homogenate, and vitamin E in serum by the technique of Hansen and Warick. Erythrocyte MDA release fonowing incubation in HzO 2 in vitro was used as a functional measure of tissue vitamin E levels. Data were compared using one-way variance analysis. There was not significant differences in the plasma MDA production among the values obtained before surgery (3 :t: 0.5 nmol/mL), postoperative pre-PN (3.5 +_ 0.6 nmol/mL) and through the course of PN (3.5 5:0.6 nmol/mL). Levels of vitamin E previous to surgery were 5,1 5:1.1 #g/mL and decreased to 3.2 _+ 1.4 #g/mL at 24 hours post-surgery before starting PN. While receiving PN, concentrations of vitamin E increased progressively up to 7 + 4. l #g/mL (p = 0.08). Pre-surgicai plasma antioxidaut activity values (72 :I: 11%) dimiuished in the first postoperative day (56 _+ 9.5%) and then showed a clear increasing tendency, directly correlated with that observed in vitamin E levels. The measurements of the maximal percentage of MDA release of erythrocytes in vitro, showed an inverse relationship with plasma vitamin E levels and with the plasma antioxidant capacity: preoperative 5.8 + 2.4 % and postoperative descending from 20.5 + 14% to 12 _+ 9.5%. Our results indicate that during surgery and within 24 hours postsurgery, a decline in antioxidant defenses occurs, In the postoperative period, while patients are on PN and taldng into account our obtained data: the unaltered MDA values, the rise of plasma vitamin E levels, the recovery of both functional erythrocyte membrane antioxidant protection and the plasma antioxidant activity, they do reflect that during the intravenous administration of lipid infusions, oxidative damage does not occur, probably due to the addition of vitamin E to PN solutions in order to avoid autooxidation of lipid emulsions. Garnitine is one of the essential nutrient in the diet of newborn infants. Mother's milk represents the natural eamitine source for the newborn infants.",

The results of a questionnaire concerning the occurrence of ICU syndrome on a PICU will be presented. Behavioral objectives: At the end of this session the participant will be able to: 1. describe four clinical symptoms of the tCU syndrome, 2. identify major sources of PICU environmental stress, 3. discuss nursing's unique role in helping the child to cope with the ICU syndrome, 4. discuss nursing's unique role in preventing ICU syndrome. Content outline: The ICU syndrome is a situation in which the individual is not able to deal with changes in observation and interpretation of both quantity and of patterns of sensory perceptions. In other words the borders between the inner and outer world becomes unclear for the person. The exact incidence of the ICU syndrome in the critical care setting is unknown, We have limited knowledge of the occurrence of the ICU syndrome in critical ill children. Yet critical ill children in our hospitals sometimes show the symptoms of ICU syndromes. To be able to identify the occurrence of ICU syndrome we developed a questionnaire. The thesis of the questionnaire was: Does the ICU syndrome occur in critical ill children in the age between three and ten, who have been intubated and/or ventilated in a PICU? Eighteen questionnaires have been send out to parents of critical ill children in two hospitals. The response was 90 percent. Conclusions: 1. Most of the children were anxious (n=11), showed regression (n=8) or had sleeping problems (n-lO) during the stay on the PICU. 2. Children showed the same problems after discharge. 3. There is no relationship between environmental factors and symptoms of the tCU syndrome during the stay. 4. There is no relationship between preexistential behavior and symptoms of the ICU syndrome during the stay. Because the lack of a scientific definition for the ICU syndrome in children and good criteria for diagnosis, we were not able to get an answer to our thesis. More research is needed. Continuous Veno Venous Haemofiltration (CVVH) was adopted as a first line renal replacement therapy in our Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) some three years ago. ~/he process of introduction and development of CVVH proved to be an exciting challenge for nurses as indeed it was for the whole multidisciplinary team involved. We have successfully used CVVH in the treatment of over 20 infants and children, weighing between 3-85 kg. The range of conditions treated is ever increasing. To date we have not only used CVVH for patients in renal failure and fluid overload, but also to gain biochemical control in tumour lysis syndrome-and metabolic disorders. Other distinct patient benefits in comparison with more conventional means of renal replacement therapies are that, it is a continuous controlled treatment being extremely effective in creating 'space' for nutrition, which is especially important in the fluid restricted, catabolic patient.",

            "text": "Of paramount importance in providing this level of service is the education and training necessary to impart the skills and knowledge for nurses to become expert practitioners in this field. We now have a teem of highly advanced practitioners who have developed their nursing skills to provide even more holistic care for their patients. This group are embracing new challenges and responding positively to the developing service whilst expanding their knowledge base. This paper will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of CVVH as we have experienced, relating i t to the wide variety of patients we have treated. We wish to share how CVVH has become an accepted role of the PICU nurse and how the service has been successfully implemented. integrated Care Pathways (ICP's) define the optimum course of events in the care of a patient with a specific condition, within a set timescale. Aims and methods: ICP's and Case Management (CM) were introduced to evaluate and improve clinical practice. ICP's were developed for patients undergoing surgery for atrial septal defect (ASD) ventricular septal defect (VSD) and Fallots tetralogy. They were based on the median experiences of the last 31 patients. 108 patients have been managed using ICP's. Results: Analysis of variation from the ICP's shows a reduction in the following potentially avoidable causes of variation: Delay in extubation has been reduced from 29% to 10%, and 31 patients (29%) were extubated earlier than the median. Prolonged stay on the intensive care unit (ICU) has decreased from 13% to 0%, and 24 patients (22%) were discharged to the ward a day earlier than the median. The number of patients receiving inadequate post operative analgesia has decreased from 35% to 15%. Delayed feeding after operation has been reduced from 52% to 28%. Unavoidable delays in extubation and discharge from ICU occurred in 22 patients (20%) because of haemodynamic instability\" or lung problems. CM utilising individualised pathways for these patients has reduced variation in care which can improve patient outcomes.",

This was attributed to the severity of the underlying disease process rather than the effectiveness of CVVH as a renal replacement therapy. Asynchronous defibrillation and synchronized cardioversion deliver direct currents of high amplitude through the chest, to stop ventricular fibrillation or to convert life-threatening arrhythmias. Since the human body is partially conductant, it should be possible that after a brief delay of time, a derivation of this monophasic defibrillation pulse is measurable in regions of the defibrillated body, other than the traject between anodal (\"sternum\") and cathodaI (\"ape~;\") paddles.",

            "text": "One could also estimate that health care personnel in the immediate environment of defibrillatoty shocks, are always at risk to possible electric injury. Accidents might occur when health care personnel do not stand clear from the patient during firing and create an additional electric path from this patient through their own body. Most likely, the nonisolated parts creating a transversal eIectric path, will be the hands of the caretaker. Since defibrillation generates touch voltages up to 5000 V and 60-70 A in veD, short delay's (5 to 10 millisec), the total body resistance during skin to skin or skin to paddle contact, is calculated to be as [ow as 750 ohm (percentile tank 50 for the entire population). An experimental protocol was developed to evaluate the conducted currents during defibrillation. Mature pigs with a weight of 100 up to 150 kg. were used as animal models. The:,, had barbiturate anaesthesia, inotropic support with dobutamine at l 0 micmgrams/kg bodyweight and all had a sinasat rhythm at the begining of the test-rounds. Synchronized defibrillation at 100 J (approx. 0.75 J/kg) and asynchronized -at 360 J (whenever ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia occurred), were attempted, through latero-lateral placed and firmly pressed defibrillation paddles and/or adhesive multi-function electrodes. Gel pads were choosen as contactmedium to cross the skinpaddle barrier. Subdermal electro-myography needle electrodes were put at different parts and regions of the pig's body, but not between the paddles. These electrodes were coupled to a resistance device of 800 ohm and a measuring computer. We measured monophasic and low current pulses up to 0,10 A during the defibrillation burst. Thus conducted currents are high enough to produce accidental electric shocks when additional electric paths are created by the caretaker. \"llaese are usually harmless, but in some \"worst case\" (wet or transpiring hands, rings,...) or in association with defectuous equipment, peak currents might be harmfull, and can produce pain, bums, apnae or cardiac (transient or persistant) arrhythmias.",

This is in accordance with clinical studies, suggesting that our in vitro model does mirror the platelet exhaustion observed in a clinical reality. No significant difference was observed between the two pumps. The purpose of this study was to examine signs of distress exhibited by several patients following the discontinuation of opioids and benzodiazepines (O & B) in a 7-bed pediatric intensive care unit. The authors compiled a list of all cases of possible withdrawal reactions reported by nurses in the study setting over a one-year period. Five cases were selected for study in terms of their wide diversity of relevant circumstances. The 5 cases were examined through a retrospective chart review. Data pertaining to analgesic and sedative administration, along with nurses' reports of behavioral distress, were transcribed and coded. A remarkable pattern of behavioral distress was clearly associated with discontinuation of O & B. Cessation of benzodiazepines was associated with severe distress. These reactions were characterized by various combinations of crying, irritability, tremors, grimacing, gagging, vomiting, or feeding problems. Some of these persisted in spite of large amounts of bolus drug administration. These signs were manifested for 2 to 9 days following cessation of O & B. These findings demonstrate that the rapid weaning of O & B infusions, sometimes following short-term therapy, can cause severe withdrawal reactions. The particular course that a specific patient will follow will likely be modulated by underlying manifestations of \"ICU psychosis\" and unresolved pain and emotional distress.",

The success of an ECMO program is heavily determined by the organizational structure and the daily availability of both well trained nurses and physicians. Until now there is no general guideline to determine the optimal training schedule to set up an ECMO program. Objective: To evaluate the set-up of an ECMO program in an area without direct availability of perfusionists of cardiothoracic surgeons. Description of the progress: During the preparation of the ECMO program which started november 1991, different phases are identified. First phase, acquisition of experience by training abroad of one physician, staff member of the ICU, physician acting as a fellow and one ICU nurse with theprimary task to serve as an ECMO coordinator and train the nursing start. In the second phase 12 animal experiments were performed by 2 paediatric surgeons, 2 staff physicians, 2 fellows and 12 nurses. Third phase, start of the actual ECMO program, priming by one trained nurse and ECMO fellow, daily care of the patient by 2 nurses, 1 ICU nurse taking care of the patient related activities, 1 ECMO trained nurse taking care of the circuit. Fourth phase, transition of the tasks for priming the system from the ECMO fellow to the ECMO nurse and changing daily care for the ECMO patient now including the circuit by 1 trained ICU nurse with special legislation for ECMO. Ongoing training of 6 to 8 nurses working for at least half a year in the ICU. During an ECMO run direct contact between the ECMO nurse and one of the staff members; Patient data: In a 4 year period 52 neonatal ECMO cases were performed with an overall mortality of 74%, ranging from over 95% in meconium aspiration to 45% in congenital diaphragmatic hernia. In 7 other patients pediatric ECMO (age range 1 month -14 months) mortality was 50%. Conclusions: ECMO can be established without perfusionists or cardio surgical back up once a predetermined training schedule is available, resulting in comparable results with the international ECMO registry both for neonatal as well as for pediatric cases. Mechanical ventilation at home makes normal development of the child with chronic respiratory failure possible. The parents must be encouraged to accept the treatment at home; therefore, they should be enabled to take care of their children all by themselves and the continuous professional support has to be offered to them. It must be stressed that the nurse is the link between the diseased child and his family introducing them into the process of the medical care at home. All the equipment needed for the mechanical ventilation of the child at home (ventilator, suction device, pulse oxymeter, oxygen tanks) has to be provided before the child is discharged. It is paid by the national insurance company. The maintainance service workers will make the necessary installations available and they will renew oxygen and compressed air weekly. The ventilation assembly must not interfere with the childs activities. The related dispensary and nursing service should be notified of the child's condition and the list of the required material (suction tubes, cannulas, desinfectants etc.) has to be made. Our experience is so far -from the nursing and medical point of view -satisfactory, however the social status of the parents needs further regulations,",

This conservative treatment consists of daily application of an antibiotic containing powder on the cele which is covered by sterile gauzes. Furthermore the enteral intake is started as soon possible. Objective: To evaluate whether this treatment renders a high risk for serious infections. Patient characteristics: In a 10 year period 23 patients with a giant omphalocele were admitted; mean birth weight 2800g (1500-3990g) mean gestational age 38.5 (33-42 weeks). Overall mortality 6 (19%). 11 patients had to be ventilated for a median duration of t6 days (2,5-164). Results: Patients were discharged at the mean of 68 days following birth (17-260) following complete epithelialization of the omphalocele. Following the initial stabilisation period parents were involved in daily care of all patients even during artificial ventialation. Enteral intake was started at a median of 2 days (1-18).

Diagnosis included TGA / intact ventricular septum (2) (both subiected to rapid arterial switch operation because of unsuitable LV function) and TGA +VSD (2). \"['he EMCO circuit included a Sarns roller 15ump, a Medtronic Minimax plus Hollow fiber oxygenator and tubing (1/4 -1/16 inch) with bioactive surfaces, an arterial canula 10 Fr., 2 venous canulas : right atrial 20 Fr, left atrial 12 Fr., an air oxygen mixer and a Sarns heater. The ACT was kept between 180-200 sec. After the infant was connected to EMCO by the surgical team and the Perfusion Technologist, the patients were being cared for and controlled exclusively by the 1CU nurse assigned to the patient and the physician on call for the ICU, Pump flows of 100-150ml / kg / mln were targeted to insure an adequate urine output, a brisk capillary fill and physiologic left and right atrial pressures. Sodium nitroprusside was used to control systemic hypertension while all other inotropic drugs were discontinued. Inspired oxygen fraction on the ventilator was reduced to 0,25 at a respiratory rate of 10-15 breaths per minute. Body temperature was maintened close to normal. When the heart started to eject again, inspired oxygen was increased to about 0,40. The preparation for weaning from EMCO was done by the ICU nurse: including oxygen fraction and ventilator rate. Weaning from EMCOwas coordinated by the medical / surgical team and the Perfusion Technologist. The duration of EMCO in the 4 patients ranged from 2 to 9 days. Three patients (75%) were saccessflly weaned from EMCO. One of the three died within 24 hours from neurologic complications, unrelated to the EMCO. The other 2 patients ( both with TGA + VSD ) are long term survivors and are doing well. Neither the survivors nor the patients who died bad hemorrhagic complications, despite the fact that 3 of the 4 were placed on EMCO because of failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass.

Overall mortality during PICU stay was 24%, in the postoperative group 16% and in the group with acute multi system failure 36%. The group of MOSF (42) consisted of hematolgic malignancies (22) mortality rate 41%, solid tumors (20) 30%. Respiratory insufficiency was the most common PICU admission (40%) followed by cardiovasculair insufficiency (26%) and encephalopathy (26%). The highest mortality rate was associated with encephatopathy (55%);the mortality of the combination of severe neutropenia in hematologic malignancy requiring ventilation was 52%. For patients with failure of four organ systems and severe neutropenia mortality rate was 64%. In oncologic children with life-threatening conditions and neutropenia timing of PICU admission and supportive therapy (incl G-CSF) must be improved for meaningful recovery during treatment in a PICU.

Bijlmer MDThe aim of the present study was to describe the practice, attitudes and needs of parents for folluw-up support after critical illness or death in children admitted to intensive care. Data were collected by a humanistic counsellor trained in bereavement care using questionnaides and home interviews. Two groups of parents were described, 42 concerning coping with critical illness 24 coping with bereavement. Analysis of data in the criticall illness group demonstrated that 13/42 parents benefitted from the PICU follow-up support while 12/30 strongly missed ongoing support by PICU staff. 12/43 indicated a strong need for meetings with the PICU staff and/or fellow-sufferers. All 24 patients in the bereavement group highly appreciated the provided follow-up meeting with the PICU staff. 10/24 missed folluw-up meetings with other parents. PICU care should therefor include a design for follow-up facilities for parents not only concerning bereavement care, but also follow-up support after critical illness. Arrangements should include individual support by PICU staff as well as parent support groups.

Wilson's disease accounts for 8 % of the cases (n=5). Results: on admission all children (mean : 10 yrs) presented with grade 3 hepatic encephalopathy [HE], hepatomegaly and jaundice. The interval between jaundice and HE was 8 d (2_-16 days). A Kayser-Fteicher ring was present in 4. Laboratory features were as following: ALT 893+406, IU/L, total bilirubin: 1069_+234 pmol/I, factor V: 20+4 % of the normal, Creatininemia: 250+50 mmol/I, ceruloplasmin: 00.7+00.4 g/l. Hemolytic anemia was noted in all cases. Plasmapheresis were performed in all children prior to OLT: no improvement of HE and liver function tests were noted. All patients were registred on the emergency list of OLT. One died awaiting a graft, one died immediatly after OLT (brain herniation ?), one died lately (severe neurological sequelae). Two patients are surviving, one after retransplantion for hepatic artery thrombosis. Conclusion: Wilson's disease may mimick fulminant hepatitis. Plasmapheresis does not modify the clinical course.

Hospital Infantil I= Paz ,M drid ~:~ai n There is little information on the evolution of serum aminoacids in hepatic patients receiving an orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Subjects. We have prospectively studied 32 OLT in 26 pediatric patients. We quantified in serum samples: total aminoaeids (TAA), esentia| aminoacids (EAA), non esential aminoacids (NEAA), branched chain aminoaeids (BCAA) and aromatic aminoaeids (AAA). Serum samples were drawn: before sdrgsry (PreTx), on admission to the PICU after OLT and subsequently on days 1 to 7 after OLT. Results. TAA, EAA and NEAA are increased before OLT in relation to normal controls although the differencs did not reach significance. After OLT, TAA, EAA and NEAA decrease under normal levels on admission (p<O, O001), day I (p<0,0001), day 5 (p<O,O001), day 6 ((p<O,O003) for TAA, (9<0,03) for EAA and (p<0,0001) for NEAA), and day 7 ((p<0,005) for TAA, (p<0,002) for EAA and (p<0,01) for NEAA), BCAA are decreased in hepatic patients before OLT, in relation to normal controls. The BCAA levels remain under normal values along the evolution, with statistical significance on admission (p<0,04), day 1 (p<0,0001), day 3 (p<0,0004), day 5 (p<0,0001) and day 7 (p<O,O03), AAA levels are significantly increased before OLT (p<O,05) and remain high on admisaion (p<0,04), Comments. The decrease in serum aminoacid levels we have found may suggest poor nutritional conditions in our patients, Thus,early parenteral support may play a role after OLT in children.

Objective: To report the first case of Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome lARDS) in children treated with surfactant combined with High Frequency Oscillation (HFO) and Nitric Oxyde, Methods: A former premature infant developed ARDS related to Respiratory Syncitiai Virus (RSV) infection. NO was delivred in the ventilatory circuit of a HN) ventilator (Dafour). As the patient was threatened by hypoxia (SAO2:71%) in spite of HFO and NO combination with high pressures using 100% Fit2, we decided to perform rescue surfactant treatmenL The patient received 200 ing/kg exogenous surfactant (Carosurf% Results: Following surfaetant instillation, marked improvement of oxygenation and ventilator] requirements was observed. FIt 2 could be dramatically reduced from 100% to 40%. Oxygenation index decreased from 35 to 12.5. After a second injection 12 hours aftex the first one, oxygenation index decreased to 5 Conclusion: This children met the US criteria for ECLS.We conclude that surfactant could be an alternative to ECLS for children with ARDS after failure of ttFO and NO. The choice between between surfactant and ECLS should be considered carefully after the morbidity of the procedures, the duration of the therapy and the cost have been weighed. Waiting for a future study comparing these two techniques, surfactant could probably be used in rescue before ECLS after failure of HFO and NO.

The levels of urea and creatinin gradually decresed. Overhydratation with life-threating pulmonary and cerebral edema was indication for CAVH on 10-th hospital day. Duration of CAVH was 144 hours, Peritoneal dialysis was performed for 20 days. Her renal functions improved 3 months later with mild proteinuria and renal tubular acidosis.

The pharmacokinetics of bumetanide were evaluated in volume overloaded infants (n=58) aged 4 days-6 mo. Single doses of 0.005, 0.01,0.015, 0,02, 0.025, 0.03, 0.035, 0.05 & 0.10 mg/kg IV were given over 1-2 min after baseline evaluation (hematologic and serum chemistry studies). Bumetanide concentration in blood (n=10) & urine (n=6) samples were quantified by HPLC. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetics revealed: V~(IJkg) V~,~(L/kg) Ctz(ml/min/kg ) Cla(ml/min/kg ) t~(hrs) 0.39_+0.21 0.29_+0.12 2,74_+1.95 1.10+0.86 2.34_+1.41 Peak serum concentrations occurred at the first post-dose sample (5 minutes) following bumetanide administration in most patients. AUC and peak serum bumetanide concentrations showed linear increases over the 20-fold dose range whereas V~,Vd,,, CIr, CIR and t~/2 were independent of dose. Peak urinary excretion rates of bumetanide increased linearly with increasing doses. The mean percent of bumetanide recovered in the urine flora 0-12 hrs was 40 + 15%. Conclusion: Distribution and elimination kinetics were similar in all patients. Elimination kinetics were first-order over the dose range of 0.005-0.10 mg/kg. Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates (Va~,Vd,,, CIT, CI,,and t,/~) were independent of the dose of bumetanide administered.

Patients: Between Dec 1987 and January 1996, 63 children (mean : 5.5 yr) with FLF were evaluated for OLT. The main causes were viral hepatitis ( 3 0 . 1 % ) and toxin-induced FLF (14.2%). In 21 children (33.3%), the cause of FLF remained undetermined. Children were considered as candidates for OLT only if hepatic encephalopathy was associated with a decrease in the level of factor V to below 25 %. Results: 12 children had no indications for OLT : all recovered. OLT was contraindicated in 7: all died. Conclusion: Emergency OLT is an effective treatment for children with FLF.

Twenty-five children received continuous INO therapy with a mean duration of 105 hours (range of 6.2-661.5 hours). Clinical bleeding problems were not observed in any pts. treated with INO. NeE levels did not exceed 5 ppm. Conclusion: Clinically significant adverse effects from 1NO were not observed, although two asymptomatie pts. had MHG levels ~ 5%. No treatment for elevated MHG levels was required other than decreasing the INO cone. Methemoglobinemia is potentially a greater risk for the neonatal population because they have decreased methemoglobin reductase activity. In the acute setting, INO appears to be a safe form of therapy for pediatric pts. with PHTN from ARDS or CHD in cone. up to 80 ppm.

London Introduction: The Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS) was last revised in 1983. Since many more interventions are now widely used, this TISS underscores the more ill patients and consequently the resource use in toady's intensive care units. Aims: 1. To develop a revised TISS incorporating the additional interventions, 4 Point: Exchange blood transfusion, 3 Point: CSF drains, Cuirass ventilation, Small Particle Aerosol Generator. To use the TISS to validate Intensive Care Levels. Level I: the non iutubated patient, Level 2: the unstable or ventilated patient and Level 3 the ventilated and unstable patient (e.g. MOSF). Patients and Methods: 223 consecutive patients admitted to the PICU were scored using a new proforma developed to include the additional interventions and to improve accuracy of collection of data by nurses. Maximum values for New and Old TISS (NTISS, OTISS) and maximum intensive care leveI was computed for each patient admission. ResuIts: NTISS correlated well with OTISS (R=0.984, y=0.053+1.158).",

C Litalien, A de Jaeger, J Lacroix, MC Guertin. H6pital Salntedustine --3175 Chemin de la Ctte Ste-Catherine, Montrtal, H3T 1C5 (Canada).Objective: To find if the %-IC in BAL is a better diagnostic marker of BNP than quantitative culture of BAL. Design: This meta-analysls compares 2 tests of respiratory secretions collected by BAL, the %-IC and quantitative culture. The method of metaanalysis used, recently described by Moses and Shapiro, takes into account both sensibility and specificity; it allows to compare the ROC curve (Receiver operating characteristic) of 2 tests, the curves being constructed by combining the best global value of selected studies(Stat Med 1993;12:  1293-1316). Data Sources: The relevant litterature was identified through computer searching, references found in published papers and by writing to the authors of original studies. Study Selection: A study was included in the meta-analysis if at least 2 of 3 independant readers consider it as fulfilling the following criteria: prospective study, performed on human beings, published from January 1969 through January 1995, in English or French-language, and estimating the value cf the %-IC and of quantitative culture of a sample of respiratory secretions collected by BAL for the diagnosis of BNP. A study including community-acquired pneumonias was excluded.Measurements and Main Results:This meta-analysis includes 9 studies of the %-IC (633 patients) and 11 studies (435 patients) of quantitative culture. It shows that the %-IC is better than quantitative culture for the diagnosis of BNP, but the difference is not statistically significant.Conclusion:This meta-analysis demonstrates that the %-IC is as reliable as quantitative cultures for the diagnosis of BNP. Using these 2 techniques together could be useful: the %-IC allows an early diagnosis of BNP; thereafter, the culture would identify the responsible(s) organism(s).",

Th\u00a2 aim of the study is to identify the clinical characteristics of infants with apnea and to describe the risk for apnea in young infants (~< 2 months) and prematures (~< 32 weeks) with RSV infection. Patients and methods: 185 infants with RSV infection admitted to the Sophia Children's HospitalRotterdam (1992Rotterdam ( -1995 were included. RSV infections was proven by a positive direct immunofluorescent assay on nasopharyngeal washing. Results: 20,5% (N=38) presented with apnea, 37% of them required mechanical ventilation. Apnea at presentation was not related to gender gestational age, underlying disease state, weight at diagnosis, ctinical features (feeding difficulties, wheezing, retractions, respiratory rate, temperature). Young age (p=0.05), low SaO2 measured by pulsoximetry (p < 0.05) and atelectasis (p < 0.05) were significantly related to apnea. In 92 infants younger than 2 months and/or prematurity ( g: 32 weeks gestationat age) cardiorespiratory registration was performed during 24-48 hours. 18.5 % (N= 17) developed apnea during disease course, 12 Infants presented themselves with apnea. In 5 infants the first apnea was detected during 24-48 hour monitor registration. Two of these require mechanical ventilation.

Mononuclear cells were separated by ficoll-hipaque gradient and assayed for T and B Ly number and Ly subsets (CD4, CD8) by immunofluorescence. The reactivity of the ceils was investigated after mitogen stimulation PHA, Con A, PrA. After the operation and the first postoperative day, the number of T Ly decreased in both groups. The number of T helper cells(CD4) decreased with significance in group A (p<0,05). T supressor cells(CD8) increased in group A (p<0,001).The ratio CD4:CD8 decreased postoperatively without significance. Lymphocyte transformation response to PHA and Con A was depressed in both groups. The older children recovered fully their responsiveness to Con A and PHA 6th day' postoperatively. The small children recovered fully to CuriA, but not to PHA. The postoperaive immunological alterations in children depend on age and severity of operative trauma. The younger children are more sensitive to anaesthesia and operation. Even small trauma induced long duration immunodepression. Conclusion: operative induced immunodepression in children is related with age.DEVELOPMENT OF LOCULATED PLEURAL BLOOD DURING EeLs AND TREATMENT WITH UROKINASE. Montgomery VL.

DESIGN AND METHODS: During 1994/95 we treated 19 neonates (NS) (2.9%), 5 female and 14 male, with PPHNS, born on term, BW=2850-4300 gr, BL=49-55 cm, APGAR 5-9. Data about fetal stress were obtained for 6 NS (31%). The disease was manifested during initial 118 hours of life by eyanosis, tanhypnea, hypoxia. hypercapnia, acidosis, alveoarterial O z gradient (A-a DO2) of 82.6-96.5 kPa, characteristic auscultatory, ECG and x-ray findings. PPHNS was confirmed by ECHO. In 17 NS (89.5%) 100% O 2 breathing for 10 minutes, induced a statistically (T-test) significant increase in pC.,, HbO2 saturation and pH, and a decrease in blood pCO,. RESULTS: 17 NS were treated with 100% O, breathing during 24-96 hrs, while during the next 96-192 hrs O z in the inspired air was decreased to normal values. After 48-96 hrs puhnonary artery (PA) pressure was decreased below the systemic and normalized after 10-14 days of treatment. A-aDO2 was gradually decreased and normalized. There was a correlation between blood gas findings and PA pressure (regression line). Of 2 NS who required mechanical ventilation, one died NS were under followup for 1-18 months aud all had normal findings. CONCLUSION: Although PPHNS Ireatment is conducted dogmatically and according to personal experielwe, it is necessmy to respect the principle of gradual approach, which should be initiated with 100% O z breathing (effective in 89.5~);, of our patieuts).THE INFLUENCE OF NAFAMOSTAT MESILATE ON PLATELETS IN AN EXPERIMENTAL PERFUSIONCIRCUIT Mellqren K, Skogby M, Friberg LG, Wadenvik H, Mellgren G.

C, Kallfelz Department of Pediatric Cardiology Medizinisehe Hochschule In some cases severe pulmonary hypertension (PHT)in childhood is caused by adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or congenital heart disease with left-to-right shunt. Several therapeutic trials have been undertaken to reduce PHT: deep sedation, muscle relaxation, prostacyclin, calcium-antagonist, NO and ECMO. There is good theoretical and experimental evidence to support that magnesium reduces PHT. Ab~a Osba et al treated 7 of 9 new-borns with persistent pulmonary hypertension successfully with magnesium sulphate Two children with VSD, left to right shunt and severe PHT and three children with ARDS were treated with magnesium-aspartate-hydrechlorid. 1-2 mmol / kg magnesium were given slowly intravenously. Serum magnesium concentration was maintained between 2-4 mmol/ 1 ionized and 3-7minor / I total magnesium by continuous intravenous infusion. After six hours four patients had a 50% reduced oxygenation index. Two of them died later with severe Sepsis. One patient with ARDS did not improve.

ITALY Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is a well known cause of cholelithiasis in adult and pediatric age. Aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the incidence of cholelithiasis in the neonates submitted to TPN in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). During 1 year, 46 neonates (28M-18F) were supported by TPN in the hqCU of our hospital; mean gestational age was 31,7 weeks (range 26-39); mean birth weight was 1625g (range 610-3400); mean onset of TPN was on 5th day of life (range 1-25) with a mean duration of 16 days (range 3-60). The administration of hyperalimentation was always by central venous line: in 7 patients PN was associated with minimal oral food. The study stated the first ultrasound and serum examination at the onset ofTPN, a control every 10 days till the end of TPN and a successive \u00a2heck after 1 and 12 months. We used, as control group, 35 infants affected by ,:~yloric stenosis (mean age 45.6 days) in v, hom, during US cxaminatk,a to confi,.,~ the diagnosis, the gallbladder was also studied. Twenty two patients conclude the study, 15 did the examinations till one month after the discharge and 9 patients died. GGT was increased in 26 patients, in 5 of them direct bilirubin was also raised. Thre out of 26 patients with increased GOT had cholelithiasis; one, with both indices raised, had stones. Three with stones were affected by necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). One patient had cholecistectomy during other surgery, 3 are asymptomatic and followed. The control group didn't present any sign of cholelithiasis. The incidence of cholelithiasis in this study is 8.7%. In our experience the association between TPN and NEC is at high risk to develop cholelithiasis, A fbtlow-up US study in all the neonates submitted to TPN is suggested.TOTAL PARENTERAL NUTRITION IN THE COMPLICATED SURGICAL PEDIATRIC PATIENT G. Tota, M. Messina, D. Meucci, G. Buonocore, S. Nocentini Department of Pediatric Surgery -University of Siena -ItalyTotal Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) has become very important in the management of the sick pediatric patient, both medical and surgical, without significant side effects, so allowing the survival of very low birth weight newborn infants and complicated surgical children. Sepsis, trauma and surgery may cause a catabolic derangement of nitrogen balance. The aim of this study was to verify if our TPN experience was able to balance the metabolic state of complicated surgical children. Between January 1985 and January 1996 10 pediatric patients, 5 newborns and 5 children (mean age 5.2 years; range: 20 months -10 years), 6 females and 4 males, were submitted to surgery for abdominal diseases in the Department of Pediatric Surgery of the University of Siena: nine were emergency surgical procedures. The patients were affected by peritonitis in 3 cases, acute appendicitis in 1, familial polyposis in 1, diaphragmatic hernia in 1, multiple bowel atresia in 2, annular pancreas in 1 and bowel malrotation in 1. The patients were submitted again to surgery after a mean period of 12.4 days (range: 4 -21 days). From the first postoperative period till after the second operation each patient received a continuous TPN containing glucose and fat as source of nonprotein calories; only in one case the child began to eat between the 2 operations. Each perioperative period implied an induction phase of TPN followed by progressive introduction of proteic and caloric requirements according to age. The newborns received TPN containing 1.0 -2.5 gr/kg/24 h amino acids (Trophamine 6 %: 9.3 gr N2/1), 80 -100 kcal/kg/24 h as nonprotein calories and 100 -150 ml/kg/24 h as fluid intake. The children received TPN containing 1.0 -1.5 gr/kg/24 h amino acids (Parentamin 10%: 14.5 gr NZ~I), 35 -60 kcal/kg/24 h as nonprotein calories and 80 -100 ml/kg/24 h as fluid intake. Electrolytes, trace elements and vitamins were given according to international standards. The clinical monitoring of all the patients was based on: body weight, arterial pulse, blood pressure, temperature, central venous pressure (CVP), blood and urinary values. Our results show that during the period of TPN each patient mantained an optimal metabolic balance without complications, so confirming the efficacy of this kind of clinical nutrition also in complicated surgical children.

We report the first case of successfull treatment of ARDS after repeated instillation of surfactant.A ten year old boy, weighing 32 kg, presented with hemorragic shock. Biphasic-Positive-Airways-Pressure ventilation was performed (Evita II, Dr~ger, Germany). He had recieved nine units of packed red blood cells and underwent surgical exeresis of two bleeding gastric ulcus. Post-operatively, a cardiac arrest required cardiopulmonary resuscitation for three minutes. Hemodynamic status was subsequently stabilised. The chest-radiograph showed infiltrates of both lungs without signs of cardiac failure. On the third day, the patient became severely hypoxic with a PaO2/FiO 2 ratio of 30. Gas exchange was not improved by high ventilator settings. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and ventilatory rates were 40 cmH~O and 18 breaths/min respectively. Inspiratory:expiratory time was 1:1 and the positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) 8 cmH20. After increasing the PEEP level to 11 cmH20, we instilled over 2 minutes, 80 mg/kg of porcine surfactant (Curosurf, Serene France), in two equal volumes in both main bronchus,The SpO~ rose to 97% within 15 rain, the Fie 2 could be reduced to 0.6. Twenty four hours later, gas exchange worsened again (PaO2/FiO2 ratio 90). We increased the PEEP from 8 to 11 cmH20, and instilled a second dose of surfactant (60 mg/kg). Again, Fie 2 could be reduced within 15 minutes (SpO 2 95; Fie 2 0.6.). The patient was weaned from the ventilator and extubated on the tenth day. Follow-up at four month showed normal lung function.We demonstrate improvement in oxygenation after repeated exogenous surfactant administrations. We assume that in early-stage ARDS, surfactant may potentiate shunt-reducing effect of PEEP as it has been demonstrated in experimental model of ARDS [4] , and allow decrease in Fie2. In case of secondary deterioration, we think that a second dose of surfactant should be administered. 1. Weg JG, Balk RA, Tharratt RS, et al. ,lAMA 1994 : 272: 1433 -8. 2.

The aim of this study was to verify these data: Patients/~lethods: All pts admitted to our multidisciplinary NICU/PICU in 1995 were included if they were in respiratory failure recruiting conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) with PEEP >_ 6 and 'FIG2 -:2 50% or high-frequency oscillation ventilation (HFO) with mean airway pressure _> t8cm H20 for 12 or more houm. Diagnosis, maximal ventilatory parameters, barotrauma, organ/ system failures, mechanism of death and Glasgow Oulcome Scale (GOS) 1 and 6 months after study entry were prospectively collected. Results: 685 patients were admitted to the unit, o1 whom 337 required mechanical ventilation for a mean duration of 4.0 days. Overall mortality was 5%, 22 patients fulfilled study criteria. 17 survivors had GOS 5, 2 pts with preexisting neurological impairment survived with GOS 3. Neonatal diseases included hyaline membrane disease (7), meconium aspiration syndrome (4) and cardiovascular surgery (1), Pediatric diseases included bacterial (1) and viral (5) pneumonia, aspiration (1) and cardiovascular surgery beyond the neonatal period (3). 1990 -1994) . PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cefotaxim was used as a prophylactic agent in 43 patients in life threatening situations (e.g. multitrauma, neurosurgery atc.). More than 85 % children required Cefotaxim for the treatment of severe infections (epiglotitis, meningitis, sepsis, pneumonia mainly in immunodeficient and neutropenic patients) in monotherapy or in the combination with the other antimicrobial agents. RESULTS: Cefotaxim as a prophylactic drug was successful in all 43 cases (100 %). The effectivity of treatment of infections was 82.8 % (313 patients). The change of antibiotic therapy required 9 patients (2.4 %). 40 patients (10.6 %) died, but only in 12 of them (3.2 %) the obduction confirmed infection. CONCLUSION: We conclude that Cefotaxim is very effective and safe antibiotic and represents \"golden standard\" in the treatment of severe infections in childhood. In order to improve nursing quality, we recently adapted nursing care to the \"five nursing functions\" (activities of daily living, accompagnment in crisis, treatment, prevention and research) as described by the Swiss Red Cross in accordance to the new educational guidelines of the European Community, The aim of this study was to document complications of \"treatment nursing function\".Methods: All treatment complications were prospectively collected by the nursing and medical staff. The nursing staff included patient (pt) name, time of occurence and exact description of complication, proposal for prevention and information of parents. The medical staff reported type of complication together with pt information, diagnosis, medication, treatment and interventions, outcome and referral, All complications were discussed in monthly meetings including nursing and medical staff.Results: From January until December 1995, 685 pts were admitted to the PICU/NICU for 3233 nursing days (81% of total bed occupancy). 337 pts needed endotracheal intubation for an average of 4.0 days and 47 pts required nasal CPAP. 26 complications in 21 pts were noted (1 per 26 pI): inadequate check-up of equipment 11; accidental extubation 4 (1 in 85 intubated pts); bedsores 3; false drug dosing 2; wrong drug 2; umbilical bleeding 2; wrong transfusion setup 1; nasal septal necrosis 1). There was no mortality due to these complications.",

However, documentation and evaluation of nursing within all \"five nursing functions\" will be nessecary in order to achieve optimal nursing care. Cardiac output determination by thermodilution, using iced injectate has been shown to be valid and reliable in pediatric patients. It has been demonstrated in adult patients that there is no difference in cardiac output values when using room temperature injectate as compared to iced temperature injectate. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of injectate temperature on cardiac output values in pediatric patients. Our study consisted of sixteen pediatric patients who had oximetric thermodilution catheters in place after cardiac surgery and who had cardiac output determined using both iced and room temperature injectate. With each patient, cardiac output was measured once on the day of surgery and again the following day. In each case cardiac output was measured using both iced and room temperature injectate. Statistical analysis included a two-way, repeated measures analysis of variance for each individual injectate administered and no significant differences were found in cardiac output. No statistically significant differences were found between groups with regard to the order of injectate administration or volume of injectate used (i,e., 3 or 5 cc's). The correlation coefficients between groups for cardiac output measurements at each injectate administration time, and for the average measurements across times, ranged between 0.81 to 0.94 (p < .0005). Preliminary data analysis suggests that cardiac output measurements for children are not effected by the temperature of injectate. A lenghty stay at a Paediatric Intensive Care Unit will always have sideeffects on a child's well-being and will put a high strain on the parents. In order to minimize the side-effects Longterm Intensive Care Unit opened in 1990 at the Childrens' Hospital. Admitted children are all ~ongterm-ill and technically-dependent and the ventilatory support can alter from a tracheostoma to CPAP or Portable Volume Ventilator. Nutritional support is applied by gastrostomies. A homelike atmosphere surrounds the children, they share a dormitory, a living-room and a dining-room The main purpose is to send the child home with or without technical equipment. This can only be implemented by giving structured education (theory and practice) to all categories involved. The multi-disciplinary team consists of one anaesthesiologist, head nurse, clinical specialist, RN nurses, nurses, one habilitation doctor, one social worker and therapists.",

The assessment of pain in children (0-3 yrs) is still difficult, because children of this age have limited language and cognitive skills. To standardize the assessment of postoperative pain and distress in the intensive care unit an observational mstrument was needed that met several criteria. It should be easy to use in daily routine care. be suitable for the i.c. situation, and in children of 0-3 hrs of age. The COMFORT scale, an observational instrument designed to assess distress in infants in i.c. units, met these criteria. To accommodate the use of the COMFORT scale in the i.c. units and in research, nurses should be trained to use the scale. An additional requirement was that the inter-rater reliability should be sufficiently high, (Cohen's kappa > .60). Objectives: 1) To introduce the COMFORT scale in the I.C.U.; 2) to examine whether this instrument can easily, be incorporated into routine care; 3) to investigate the inter-rater retiabtlity. Methods: The COMFORT scale is an 8-item instrument specifically designed for use in pediatric i,c, units and contains both physiological items (heart rate, blood pressure) and behavioral items (e.g., alertness behavior, calmness/agitation, body movement, facial expression respiratory response, muscle tension). The observation period is 2 minutes. The scale is supplemented with an item on crying tbr children who are not mechanically ventilated. Groups of 8 t.c. nurses were trained by means of video's and observations at the wards. After the training, each nurse completed 10 scores with other nurses, after which the Cohen's kappa was computed. When the kappa's for the items met or exceeded our .60 criterium, a new group of nurses was trained. Results: To date, 30 nurses have been trained. Nurses find the COMFORT scale easy\" to administer and a valuable addition to routine care in the i.c. unit. The Cohen's kappa's were higher than .60 for all items that the inter-rater reliability was high.",

Introduction:Children with neuro-muscular disease are believed to have a higher Resting Energy Expenditure (REE), because of their increasedwork of breathing.The influence of nocturnal nasal mask ventilation on energy metabolism and nutritional state of these children has not been studied so far.Objective:l,ls the REE inereased?2.1s there an influence of nasal mask ventilation on the REE?3.What is the nutritional state?4.What is the estimated total energy expenditure(ETE) in relation to the caloric intake? Methods:A pilot study of 4 patients(12-16 years) .The following measurements were performed:l.Anthropometry.2.Bioelectric impedance-3.REE was measured by indirect calorimetry during the day (in bed) with and without nasal mask ventUation,REE was compared with predicted REE according to Schofield(PEE),4.Caloric-intake and activities were recorded during 48 hour before measurement.5.Total energy expenditure was calculated as follows:measured REE x estimated activity factor. Results:tin all children weight for height was too low, <p3.2.AII children had a low % of fat.3.According to the healthy group, REE is not increased.4,Nasal mask ventilation lowered REE in 2 patients, in 1 patient we measured a clear decrease.Conclueion:l.Anthropometry and indirect calorimetry were helpful in evaluating the nutritional state.2.There is no increased REE,in t patient there is clearly effect of nasal mask ventilation.3.When caloric intake was related to REE and level of activity 2 patients had too low caloric intake.4.The influence of nocturnal nasal mask ventilation and nutritional assessment should be evaluated longitudinally. Increasing awareness that the neonate can percept pain and suffer following surgical procedures, has major impact on pain management. In our unit continuous morphine infusion (t0/~g/kg/hr) was introduced from January 1990 as a standard medicatton following surgical procedures. Before 1990 Morphine was given as a bolus (i.m., i.v., rectal) of 100/~g/kg up till four times a day. Repeated gifts of morphine were only gwen following observation by the nurse that the child experienced pain. Aim of the study: To evaluate pain management before and tbllowing introduction of a continuous morphine infusion for postoperative pain in our ICU. Patients and methods: Term born babies with isolated oesophageal atresia and tracheo-oesophageal fistula were included in the study. The total amount of morphine (/~\u00a3/kg/24 hours); number of days morphine was given; duration of artificial ventilation was evaluated in a case control study. RES ULTS: 1985 -1990 1991 -1994 Central venous catheters (CVC) have been increasingly used also at our PICU, University Medical Centre Ljubljana. Besides advantages, the CVC has brought numerous risks of complications; the catheter sepsis occurs most often and can be fatal for the patient. For example, in 1995 we dealt with 400 children aged 0 -12 years or in other words 1.14 CVP per a child treated at our PICU. A specialized unit for preparing parenteral natrition started to function in the University Medical Centre Pharmacy in 1977. After that we equipped a special room for preparing other necessary infusion mixtures and organized a team of nurses -\"catheter nurses\".Their tasks comprise: managing CVCs, replacing and installing infusion systems and mixtures made at pharmacy, preparing drugs and some necessary infusion mixtures in special room, permanent training and co-operation with related disciplines, pharmacy, epidemiology, microbiology, etc. All registered nurses at PICU have been trained for this work. The routine is as follows: in the morningafter the doctor's visit, we first check the CVC and change the dressings; according to the nurse's observations, the doctor decides whether there is a need to remove or replace the CVC. If the catheter site is inflamed, swollen, or purulent, a swab is taken for microbiological culture and the area cleaned. In case of systemic infection signs, CVC has to be replaced, blood culture taken and the infection treated with antibiotics. The dressings are always changed by two TMcatheter nurses together. Afterwards the infusion mixtures for the next 24 hours are prepared for each child. The infusion mixtures which will not be used immediately are kept on +4\u00b0C; before application they are, of course, warmed to at least room temperature. Finally the \"catheter nurse\" supplies the CVC with new infusion mixtures made at our pharmacy. Our observations show that such work requires responsibility and is demanding; but our pemanent care lessens the number of complications. Thus the described scheme fulfilled our expectations.",

A high ratio results in minimum volume work for the right ventricle but is at the expense of important hypoxemia. A low ratio is reflected in minimum hypoxemia but an unfavorable increase in excess ventricular volume work. A resistance ratio of approximately 1 results in an arterial oxygen saturation of 75% -80%, a Qp/Qs of 1, and ventricular volume work only twice normal. This latter physiology appears best for oxygen delivery and systemic perfusion with tolerable volume work. Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the inspired gas is known to increase pulmonary vascular resistance without significantly influencing systemic resistance in the range of 1 to 20 tort partial pressure. Hyperventilation with no CO2 in inspired gas decreases pulmonary vascular resistance. Thus, managing CO2 may be useful to modulate the pulmonary-to-systemic resistance ratio, in the tast 16 months, 20 patients with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome were managed by a Norwood procedur e. 10 patients with endotracheal entubation pre-operatively had CO2 added to inspired gas to modulate the pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio. 17 patients had CO2 added to inspired gas post-operatively. All but 1 patient had characteristically large pulmonaary-to-systemic flow ratio with oxygen saturation mean 90 % preoperatively, even in those patients receiving CO2, CO2 was accompanied by elimination of metabolic acidosis pre-operatively. The most comlnon partial pressure of CO2 added post-operatively was 14 torr. pO2 ranged from 25 mmHg to 40 mmHg. All surviving patients developed a metabolic alkalosis (10 mean) when treated with CO2. There were 4 deaths, one from drug toxicity, one from excessive post-operative hemorrhage, two from sepsis or mocardial insufficiency. Only one patient benefited from catecholamine support which can increase systemic resistance unfaborably. In this experience CO2 was felt to be an important adjunct in some patients pre-operatively and most patients postoperatively to faborably modulate the critically important systemic-topulmonary flow ratio, to maximize oxygen delivery and systemic perfusion, while minimizing excessive right vantricular volume work.",
