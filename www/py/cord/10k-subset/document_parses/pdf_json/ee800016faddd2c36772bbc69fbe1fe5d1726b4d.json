Each case study is structured to detail a country's health biotechnology sector's strengths, defining characteristics (government, research institutes and universities, industry, public perception), challenges to development and conclusions concerning the factors important for success. As far as we are aware, this is the first time such a side-by-side comparison has been made on health biotechnology innovation in developing countries. By analyzing each country's biotechnology sector in this manner, we have identified several factors that appear to encourage successful development and several common challenges that countries share in continuing and sustaining development of healthcare biotechnology.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Although the seven countries studied were at different stages of economic development and had companies of varying degrees of maturity, several factors emerged from our analysis that appear key to the establishment of a successful health biotechnology sector.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Characteristics that define a successful biotech sector"}, {"text": "Focus on local health needs. Despite limited resources the countries studied have found ways to use biotechnology to meet local health needs, even for the poor. For example, South Africa is responding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic by prioritizing research on the disease; it is promoting the development of a vaccine against HIV subtype C, the strain most prevalent in that country (as well as in the rest of Africa and Asia). Egypt, in the face of an acute insulin shortage, has emphasized the development of affordable recombinant insulin to reduce its dependence on expensive imports. It now has a 2-year supply of insulin in storage. Cuba responded to an meningitis outbreak caused by meningococci serotype B by successfully developing the world's first and only meningitis B vaccine. Indian biotechnology companies now produce hepatitis B vaccine at a much lower cost than developed countries. They sell the vaccine within India and to the United Nations Children Foundation (New York).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Characteristics that define a successful biotech sector"}, {"text": "Furthermore, preliminary analysis of scientometric data 1 suggests that some of the seven case study countries publish predominantly in scientific fields relevant to the health problems within their own countries.

Supporting local health biotechnology endeavors is a promising way to encourage the development of health products for developing countries. Success is expressed in many ways. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. In fact there are many different ways of succeeding in health biotechnology. We see success in the development of leading-edge innovations, such as the case of the meningitis B vaccine in Cuba, but most countries have found success in licensing preexisting technology, as was the case for recombinant insulin development in Egypt. The Cuban vaccine project was so effective that the rate of meningitis infection in the country is much lower than it was before the outbreak of the disease in the late 1970s. In Egypt, a capacity to locally produce recombinant insulin allows the country to address diabetes locally and meet health needs of their population.

Both Because success is demonstrated in such diverse ways, rank ordering the countries in terms of their success is not feasible. Furthermore, because health biotechnology is relatively risky, there is no guarantee that these countries will be able to sustain their successes and get both health and economic benefits in the long run. Continued success will depend on many factors, including how well the innovation systems develop and function. What is clear is that countries with strong scientific foundations are well placed to succeed, but economic benefits will likely be linked to how well they can engage and sustain private sector growth and commercialize scientific discoveries as products.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Characteristics that define a successful biotech sector"}, {"text": "Build on educational and health systems. This study points to the importance of good basic education and health systems as building blocks for health biotechnology development.

Table 1 shows the proportion of the population with access to affordable essential drugs. South Korea and Cuba have access to drugs comparable to that in the developed world. In all of the other countries, except for Brazil and India, access to medication is reasonable, indicating that health biotechnology development is not necessarily stifled by the poor access of a country's population to medicine.

All the case studies stress the importance of political will for promoting health biotechnology innovation in developing countries. The governments of most of the seven countries started to pay attention to biotechnology in the 1980s (that is, quite early in the development of the field) and have continued to support its development. India, for example, emphasized health biotechnology in its sixth five year plan, 1980-1987, as a tool to tackle India's underdevelopment and to improve the health of its population. Health biotechnology is a science-intensive field requiring considerable investments of time and money before it is likely to generate benefits.

In South Africa and Cuba, geopolitical conditions played an important role. In South Africa, the health biotechnology sector owes some of its success to decisions made during the apartheid years. The isolation of the country over a long period provided impetus for self-sufficiency and the development of its own research capacity to address its needs. The same applies to Cuba.

Several of the countries in this study have focused their efforts on particular niche areas in health biotechnology. Preventive vaccines have been one of those niche areas. These are particularly attractive because in several cases recombinant vaccines are available where the technology for producing them is relatively simple and can easily be reproduced (see Box 1). In general, they are a much more efficient and cost-effective way of dealing with infectious diseases than drugs, and they can provide long-term immunity. They are very relevant to the health agenda of most developing countries with large, poor populations. South Africa, for example, is focusing on vaccine development for diseases such as hepatitis B and C and HIV/AIDS. Some of the countries in this study have also identified areas that leverage some specific technological strength or other resources they possess. South Korea has stressed microarrays/biochips and bioinformatics to exploit its competitive advantage and local know-how in information and communication technologies. India also has been able to capitalize on its large pool of well-trained English-speaking science and technical experts, as well as its relatively cheaper costs in R&D. The Egyptian Agricultural Genetic Engineering Research Institute's previous successes in agricultural biotechnology are providing the country with a platform for possibly developing a plant-made hepatitis B vaccine.

The case studies have confirmed what the innovation system literature emphasizes [5] [6] [7] , namely that close linkages and active knowledge flows are essential for innovation to take place. By encouraging collaborations and resource sharing among different institutions in its innovation system, Cuba has been able to succeed in health biotechnology, despite its very limited financial resources. Some of the case studies noted that lack of collaboration and linkages among health biotechnology institutions restrained innovation efforts. In China, lack of collaboration prevented its scientists from being the first in the world to sequence the severe acquired respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus. Lack of linkages, especially between universities and industry, has also slowed innovation efforts in Brazil and Egypt. Those countries have succeeded more because of strong individuals who played pioneering roles in their health biotechnology development. Although contributions of 'champion' individuals can never be downplayed, in the long run a systemic approach is likely to be more sustainable. Several of the countries here have embarked on an active policy of encouraging closer collaborations. Promoting clusters in health biotechnology has become a standard policy, and most of the countries in this study have initiated cluster development of some sort. Examples include South Korea's Daeduk Science Town, India's Genome Valley, Cuba's West Havana Scientific Pole and Egypt's Mubarak City for Scientific Research and Technology Applications.
