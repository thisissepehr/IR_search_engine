Th e etiology of the noticed disorder remains unclear. However, ischemic insult to the hepatic tissue might cause the damage to the small bile ducts with consequent obstruction to the bile outfl ow. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy in second reported patient is unlikely because the values of ALT and AST were nearly normal. Furthermore, the bilirubin decreased while the patient was still pregnant. Unconjugated portion of bilirubin was attributed to hemolysis. Completely reversible nature of this phenomenon is comforting even though its pathogenesis and etiology are unknown. Th is kind of severe hyperbilirubinemia is extremely worrisome for every clinician since it usually represents a preterminal event. However, one of our patients gradually and spontaneously recovered, while the other died of refractory respiratory failure after the serum bilirubin concentration was decreasing. Despite only limited experience, it seems that cholestatic pattern of hyperbilirubinemia during ECMO without the proportional elevation of transaminases as markers of hepatic tissue damage and with preserved hepatic synthetic function, represents only transitory disorder in bilirubin metabolism. Furthermore, despite the impressive values of the measured serum bilirubin in our patients, the clinical significance of this phenomenon on the patient's outcome seems to be irrelevant. Severe and unproportional depletion of factor IX of the coagulation cascade was noticed in two patients. Pathogenetic mechanism and etiology of the observed disorder eluded us, but it could be related to the activation of the coagulation cascade by the extracorporeal blood fl ow. However, this mechanism does not explain why other coagulation factors remained within normal limits. Heparin is an indirect thrombin inhibitor which complexes with antithrombin, converting this circulating cofactor from a slow to a rapid inactivator of thrombin, factor Xa, and to a lesser extent, factors XIIa, XIa and IXa. Obviously, the effect of heparin solely does not explain the isolated depletion of factor IX, but it might be a contributing factor for the occurrence of this phenomenon. Factor IX depletion in the fi rst patient was noticed on the same day when the fatal intracranial hemorrhage occurred and on the day the patient was successfully weaned from ECMO support. Af-ter this unfortunate incidence, we routinely measured the concentration of coagulation factors daily. Th e second patient developed severe tracheal hemorrhage when factor IX activity dropped to 11%. After the treatment with purifi ed human factor IX the hemorrhage ceased. Th e two patients described indicate that observed unproportional depletion of factor IX is of possible clinical signifi cance since it might contribute to the severity of hemorrhage in diff erent organ systems during ECMO procedure. Especially because in both patients ACT values were in the desired range, that is between 160 and 180 seconds. Despite, our only limited experience it seems prudent to monitor the activity of all coagulation factors daily while patients receive ECMO support and to treat factor IX depletion if signifi cant hemorrhage occurs or if its value drops below 30% of normal. Th e value of 30% is suffi cient for the postoperative period and thus it might be during the ECMO support as well [4] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3573, "end": 3576, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Th is infl uenza pandemic established ECMO respiratory support as the leading treatment option for refractory ARDS worldwide [1, 2] .
