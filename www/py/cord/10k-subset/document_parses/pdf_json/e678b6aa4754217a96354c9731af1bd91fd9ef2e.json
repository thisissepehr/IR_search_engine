As we have now demonstrated that the rate of sinusitis is related to the severity of the initial URI, increased reporting of milder URIs would be expected to result in a decreased rate of complications. In this study, RSV was detected more frequently at URI events that became complicated by sinusitis, compared to uncomplicated URI visits, suggesting a more prominent pathogenic role for this virus. Although no other studies correlating [13] followed 362 infants from birth to 12 months of age and performed viral PCRs on nasopharyngeal swabs. The development of acute otitis media was associated with increasing age and with infection with RSV, rhinovirus, enterovirus, or bocavirus. Although we did not find an association with the other viruses, it is pertinent that RSV was associated with complications in both studies. RSV is known to elicit a robust immune response in the nose and lower respiratory tract [14] . It is probable that this virus produces more local inflammation in the nasal mucosa, thereby affecting the sinus ostia.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 166, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 221, "end": 225, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 774, "end": 778, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1250, "end": 1254, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Sinusitis as a Complication of Upper Respiratory Infections"}, {"text": "National guidelines for the diagnosis of acute sinusitis have relied on clinical criteria to conclude that a child is experiencing an episode of sinusitis: the persistence of respiratory symptoms for 10 or more days without improvement or the worsening of symptoms after a period of improvement [4, 5] . An important problem related to the clinical diagnosis of sinusitis is that persistent or worsening upper respiratory symptoms may result from the development of a classic, secondary bacterial infection or a second viral infection that is closely spaced to the first. We found that, when using the criteria of persistent or worsening symptoms, 71% of patients had the same or no virus detected on the 10-day nasal sample, supporting the diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis in these patients. However, nearly 30% had a new virus identified, suggesting that sequential viral infections may explain the symptoms. This observation is supported by data from several clinical trials, demonstrating that about one-third of children clinically diagnosed to have sinusitis lack evidence of a bacterial infection [7, 15, 16] . In addition, in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of placebo vs amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in children with clinically diagnosed sinusitis, the non-response rate to the antibacterial was 36%, while the spontaneous cure rate in recipients of the placebo was 32%; each of these correspond closely to the percentage of patients in our study who had sequential viral infections [7] . This is also close to the number of children (20%) who have normal radiographs despite meeting the diagnostic criteria for acute sinusitis [17] . When surveillance samples of nasal wash are examined in asymptomatic children, about 30% will show the presence of a virus [3] . Accordingly, although it is likely, there is no certainty that the virus identified at Day 10 (at the time of diagnosis of acute sinusitis) is the cause of the respiratory symptoms, since asymptomatic detection is common. Furthermore, the identification of a new virus does not preclude the possibility of a dual infection caused by both a virus and bacteria. However, the compelling data show that when a new virus was detected in subjects with sinusitis on Day 10, it was statistically more likely to be adenovirus, influenza, or RSV (rather than rhinovirus), as compared to the viruses identified during surveillance. Furthermore, a virus was identified in 55% of the 31 patients with sinusitis on Day 10, a frequency of detection significantly different than the identification of viruses during surveillance or recovery. To assess the relative role of the bacteria and virus at the 10-day visit, we compared bacterial densities in the nasal washes of children with the same or no virus with those in whom a new virus was identified, using washes from Day 3 and Day 10 for each category and between categories. We found no significant differences in either the bacterial presence or density. Of note, the absence of M. catarrhalis was associated with the acquisition of a new virus. In contrast, Xu et al [18] showed higher rates of colonization with bacterial pathogens in the nasopharynx in otitis media-prone children, compared with those with uncomplicated URIs.
