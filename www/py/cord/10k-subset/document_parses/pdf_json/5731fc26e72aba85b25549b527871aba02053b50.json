Fruit-bats of the genus Pteropus (commonly known as flying-foxes) are the natural host of the virus, and the putative source of infection in horses; infected horses are the source of human infection. Effective treatment is lacking in both horses and humans, and notwithstanding the recent availability of a vaccine for horses, exposure risk mitigation remains an important infection control strategy. This study sought to inform risk mitigation by identifying spatial and environmental risk factors for equine infection using multiple analytical approaches to investigate the relationship between plausible variables and reported Hendra virus infection in horses. Spatial autocorrelation (Global Moran's I) showed significant clustering of equine cases at a distance of 40 km, a distance consistent with the foraging 'footprint' of a flying-fox roost, suggesting the latter as a biologically plausible basis for the clustering. Getis-Ord Gi* analysis identified multiple equine infection hot spots along the eastern Australia coast from far north Queensland to central New South Wales, with the largest extending for nearly 300 km from southern Queensland to northern New South Wales. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) showed the density of P. alecto and P. conspicillatus to have the strongest positive correlation with equine case locations, suggesting these species are more likely a source of infection of Hendra virus for horses than P. poliocephalus or P. scapulatus. The density of horses, climate variables and vegetation variables were not found to be a significant risk factors, but the residuals from the GWR suggest that additional unidentified risk factors exist at the property level.

Similarly, Scanlan et al (2014) modelled the effect of temperature on Hendra virus survival in the environment, finding a good temporal fit with the cumulative annual clustering of spill-overs in the Australian winter [46] . Our finding of a weak positive correlation (0.1460.06) between a higher annual minimum temperature and spill-over is incongruent, and is likely confounded by the northern geographic distribution (higher minimum temperatures) of P. alecto and P. conspicillatus. More broadly, the absence of any identifiable climatic risk factor does not preclude its existence. It might be argued that the period of the current standard 30-yr climate dataset constrained our ability to identify any emerging climatic factors, but more fundamentally there are inherent challenges in terms of which variables to include in an analysis, and on what spatial scale. With a nomadic natural host species able to move hundreds of kilometres in a week, it is entirely plausible that a climatic risk factor might manifest remote to a subsequent spill-over location. Additionally, a climatic risk factor that acts indirectly and/or after a time-lag (for example, annual rainfall on subsequent food resource) poses confronting analytical complexity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 106, "end": 126, "text": "Fogarty et al (2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 220, "end": 224, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 238, "end": 258, "text": "Scanlan et al (2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 445, "end": 449, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The threat of Hendra virus causes particular anxiety and concern for horse owners in eastern Australia because of the very high case fatality rates in infected horses and close contact humans. Despite the recent availability of a vaccine for horses, it remains important that horse owners continue to implement risk management strategies that minimise horse exposure to Hendra virus. Our findings validate anecdotal assessments of a spatial risk component to Hendra virus infection in horses. They indicate that equine incidents are indeed spatially clustered, indicating underlying spatially occurring risk factors, and that multiple equine infection hot spots exist along the eastern Australia coast. Furthermore, we have shown that the density of two related species of flying-fox, P. alecto and P. conspicillatus, has a strong positive correlation with equine case locations.
