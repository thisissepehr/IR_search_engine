However, it failed to achieve fT > 4 \u00b5g/mL > 40 to provide activity against strains susceptible to increased exposure in 33.3 and 39.1% patients on the first and the third days, respectively. Modeling and simulation showed that a bolus dose of 500 mg followed by 3-h EI of meropenem 1500 mg Q8H will achieve this target. A bolus of 500 mg followed by an infusion of 2000 mg would be required to achieve fT > 8 \u00b5g > 40. Targets of fT > 4 \u00b5g/mL = 100 and fT > 8 \u00b5g/mL = 100 may be achievable in two-thirds of patients by increasing the frequency of dosing to six hourly (Q6H).",

            "text": "Meropenem is a broad-spectrum injectable carbapenem commonly used for empirical therapy of severe sepsis or septic shock. Anti-bacterial activity of meropenem is related to the fraction of time (fT) between doses during which the plasma concentration (Cp) is maintained above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the infecting organism [1] . In vitro and in vivo animal models suggest that for the optimal bactericidal activity for carbapenems, the Cp must remain above the MIC for the pathogen for at least 40% of dosing interval (fT > MIC > 40) [2, 3] . Other pharmacokinetic (PK) targets like targeting Cp more than four times of MIC for at least 40% of dosing interval (fT > 4 \u00d7 MIC > 40) and continuous exposure of meropenem above the MIC (fT > MIC = 100 and fT > 4 \u00d7 MIC = 100) have also been suggested. The fT > MIC can be increased by prolonging the duration of infusion for \u03b2-lactams [4] . Extended infusions (EI), with the dose delivered over several hours, and continuous infusions over 24 h have been proposed in place of the usual intermittent infusions given over a few minutes to an hour, to improve the pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

However, this regimen does not achieve fT > 4 \u00b5g/ mL > 40% in one-third of patients. Also, Cp > 4 \u03bcg/mL within 1 h of starting the first dose is not achieved in one-fourth of patients with meropenem EI without a preceding bolus. These findings suggest that the routinely used EI of 1000 mg meropenem may not be adequate for empiric coverage of all non-resistant strains of these Gram-negative bacteria which are susceptible to increased exposure. The PK modeling and simulation showed that a dose of 1500 mg meropenem as a 3-h EI Q8H with a preceding bolus of 500 mg before the first dose would achieve the pharmacokinetic target of fT > 4 \u00b5g/mL > 40% in most of the patients. Pharmacokinetics of meropenem are likely to be altered in patients with severe sepsis compared to healthy volunteers because of infusion of a large volume of fluids and blood products, increased capillary permeability, high cardiac output, augmented renal clearance, or renal hypoperfusion [5] . Therefore, not surprisingly, Vd was found to be higher in our patients than reported in healthy individuals [24] . The implications of our findings are that patients with severe sepsis or septic shock would require higher doses to account for increased Vd. Studies in which an EI was preceded by a bolus of meropenem have shown that the PK goals were achieved in a majority of patients [12, 17, 18] . A bolus dose preceding the EI would increase the Cmax as well as the Cp in the first hour. However, several other studies have shown that an EI without a preceding bolus is equally effective in conditions such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, febrile neutropenia with bacteraemia, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, suspected Gram-negative infections and critically ill patients with septic shock requiring continuous renal replacement therapy [10, 13, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . In most of these studies, Cp remained greater than MIC for a greater fraction of time with the EI of meropenem without a prior bolus, compared to a 1-h infusion administration of meropenem. Our current regimen was based on these studies. However, we observed delayed Cp > 4 \u03bcg/ mL in our patients. Based on our pharmacokinetic modeling, we determined that a bolus of 500 mg of meropenem would achieve Cp of 4 \u03bcg/mL and a bolus of 1500 mg would be sufficient to achieve Cp of 8 \u03bcg/ mL almost immediately.",

Since meropenem is usually initiated in ICU as empirical therapy, it may be highly desirable for the dose to cover most of the organisms including the strains with MIC breakpoints higher than 2 \u00b5g/mL which can be susceptible at an increased exposure. Based on our pharmacokinetic modeling, meropenem at a dose of 1500 mg, rather than 1000 mg, given as an EI with a preceding bolus of 500 mg before the first dose would achieve this therapeutic target. Many authors believe in a more aggressive pharmacodynamic target of fT > MIC = 100% for prolonged or continuous infusions [30] . However, meropenem is known to have post-antibiotic effect (PAE) against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms [31] , particularly when Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms like E. coli and PsA were exposed to the meropenem levels four times the MIC for 2 h [32] .",

An obvious strength of simulation lies in the fact that various scenarios can be simulated using a few patients' data, which could be subsequently validated in a small cohort of patients, thus obviating the need for large dose-ranging studies. This enables optimal therapeutic strategies to be adopted faster in clinical practice. The currently recommended high dose of meropenem (2000 mg Q8H) can achieve fT > 8 \u00b5g/mL > 40 in most of the patients with an EI along with a 500 mg preceding bolus (Supplemental Digital Content- Table 1 ).",

Several authors in the past have used the popPK approach to analyze such data [24, 29] . While popPK is very informative to identify the sources and correlates of variability, the relatively small sample size would have affected the model estimates. Compartment modeling, on the other hand, allows the estimation of the duration of time for which concentrations were above a predefined threshold which was the primary objective of our study. Since a rich sampling strategy was followed in our study, these estimates are likely to be highly accurate. Two recent PopPK studies of meropenem in ICU patients have demonstrated one-compartment pharmacokinetics with first-order elimination which corroborates with the similar pharmacokinetic profile observed in our study [36, 37] .",
