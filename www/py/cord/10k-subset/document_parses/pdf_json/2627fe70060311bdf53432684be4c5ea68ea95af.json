In October 2013, approximately 107 guinea fowl (N. meleagris) and 173 black-bone Silkie chickens (G. gallusdomesticus) were introduced from a farm in Siping City, some of which subsequently sickened and died. More black-bone Silkie chickens than the other types of poultry died. A local veterinarian reported that the cause of death of this batch of birds resulted from air sacculitis and enteritis. Testing for avian influenza virus was not performed. On December 24, 2013, 97 chickens were introduced from a dealer's farm that was sufficiently disinfected, and no deaths occurred in this batch of birds.

Sanger sequencing was performed with an automatic Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Life Technologies, USA) and an Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Deep sequencing was performed using the Ion torrent PGM platform. The library of 200-bp fragments was sequenced with a 318v2 chip. The nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) reads were analyzed with a pipeline process using the CLC Genomics workbench 7.0.4. The human isolate A/Jilin/10117/2014 and A/ Chicken/Jilin/05/2014 were sequenced by Sanger sequencing. The sequences of other viruses isolated from chickens and the poultry farm environment were examined using deep sequencing with the Ion torrent PGM platform to investigate whether potential avian influenza viruses coexisted in the hosts.

The bootstrap method was used to test the phylogeny and was run up to 1,000 times. The time in generations to TMRCA for the eight gene fragments was estimated with the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach in BEAST v1.8 25 using the SRD06 nucleotide substitution model 35 . The uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model was selected for the rate variation among the branches. A Bayesian skyride was used as a prior coalescent tree, and the UPGMA tree was used as the starting tree. For the prior parameter, ucld.mean and ucld.stdev were set as the uniform distributions; the default values of the other parameters were used. The virus isolates without a detailed sampling date were assigned to the middle of the year/month. The MCMC algorithm was run for 5 3 10 7 steps for each dataset, with sampling every 500 steps.
