Many of the low pH buffers that were tested did not harm cell monolayers in vitro. Of the different solutions that were evaluated in tissue culture, citrate was chosen for further study because it is nontoxic, readily kills virus (2-4 log 10 reduction in TCID 50 ), and has a buffering capacity to remain at low pH even after it is diluted 3-fold. The in vitro model of intermittent exposure to a nasal spray suggested that, by interrupting the extracellular spread of virus, low-pH buffers may be able to either prevent or reduce the severity of clinical colds. Because the low-pH buffers lowered the nasal pH for at least 5 min and produced only minor irritation of the nose in healthy volunteers, a small-scale pilot clinical trial was performed using experimental inoculation with HRV16. Experimental inoculation with HRV provides an attractive model to test antiviral compounds because it allows for inoculation with a standardized virus and for detailed kinetic observations of the evolution and resolution of the cold.

One factor was the statistical power of the study. A further possibility is that, despite having an antiviral effect, the solutions caused sensations in the nose that were confused with cold symptoms. Although the AE profile of citrate in the noses of normal volunteers was similar to that of normal saline, it is possible that this effect could be accentuated in the presence of a viral infection. An alternate explanation for the lack of clinical benefit is that a greater reduction in viral replication is needed to achieve efficacy. The 1-log reduction in viral shedding observed in the present trial is similar, however, to that reported in a clinical trial of tremacamra (soluble ICAM-1) [10] and is somewhat greater than that produced by interferon-a 2b or pleconaril [17, 18] . Each of these medications produced a small but significant clinical benefit in previous studies. Topical medications have an additional challenge of delivering medication to the site of infection. Infections with HRV can involve large lower airways in addition to the nasopharynx [19] , and delivery to these locations might be necessary to obtain optimal clinical benefits. Finally, it is possible that the spray enhanced either cellular or neural inflammation; both of these mechanisms have been linked to the pathogenesis of cold symptoms [1, 20] .
