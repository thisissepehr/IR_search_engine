The incidence of CR-BSI among neonates in Hung Vuong Hospital was higher than that of other neonatal care centres in Vietnam. Methods: An 18-month pre-and post-intervention study was conducted over three 6-month periods to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention for CR-BSI and to identify risk factors associated with CR-BSI. During the intervention period, we trained all nurses in the Department of Neonatology on BSI preventive practices, provided auditing and feedback about aseptic technique during catheter care and maintenance, and reorganised preparation of total parenteral nutrition. All neonates with intravenous catheter insertion \u226548 h in the pre-and postintervention period were enrolled. A standardised questionnaire was used to collect data. Blood samples were collected for cultures. We used Poisson regression to calculate rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for CR-BSI incidence rates and logistic regression to identify risk factors associated with CR-BSI. Results: Of 2225 neonates enrolled, 1027 were enrolled in the pre-intervention period, of which 53 CR-BSI cases occurred in 8399 catheter-days, and 1198 were enrolled in the post-intervention period, of which 32 CR-BSI cases occurred in 8324 catheter-days. Incidence rates of CR-BSI significantly decreased after the intervention (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.39-0.94). Days of hospitalisation, episodes of non-catheter-related hospital-acquired infections, and the proportion of deaths significantly decreased after the intervention (p < 0.01). The CR-BSI was associated with days of intravenous catheter (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.08), use of endotracheal intubation (OR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.27-4.06), and intravenous injection (OR = 8.50, 95% CI 1.14-63.4). Conclusions: The interventions significantly decreased the incidence rate of CR-BSI. Regular refresher training and auditing and feedback about aseptic technique during care and maintenance of catheters are critical to reducing CR-BSI.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Intravenous catheter insertion is vital to managing critically ill patients, but it may involve a high risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CR-BSI).

In our study, we detected two cases, both premature neonates who received TPN via a catheter, that were positive for Escherichia vulneris. Hence, the pathogen should be suspected in premature neonates receiving TPN via a catheter.

TPN was a critical risk factor of CR-BSI [9, 11] , but it was not found to be a risk factor in our study, which is consistent with other studies [35, 36] . This could be due to our intervention of relocating TPN preparation from DON to a clean room in DOP and preparing parenteral nutrition under a laminar airflow hood. Birth weight and preterm neonates have not been identified as risk factors in this study or in other studies [9, 35] . Instead, we identified risk factors that included the days of intravenous catheters, intravenous injection, and the use of endotracheal intubation that were consistent with other studies [19, 25, [35] [36] [37] . Although the interventions in the study were shown to be effective, three risk factors are related directly to catheter usage. It is clear that catheter care and other BSI preventive practices should be regularly monitored and good practices should be maintained.
