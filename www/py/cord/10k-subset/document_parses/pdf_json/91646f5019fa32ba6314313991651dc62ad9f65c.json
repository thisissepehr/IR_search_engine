            "text": "We study changes in the bifurcations of seasonally driven compartmental epidemic models, where the transmission rate is modulated temporally. In the presence of periodic modulation of the transmission rate, the dynamics varies from periodic to chaotic. The route to chaos is typically through period doubling bifurcation. There are coexisting attractors for some sets of parameters. However in the presence of quasiperiodic modulation, tori are created in place of periodic orbits and chaos appears via finite torus doublings. Strange nonchaotic attractors (SNAs) are created at the boundary of chaotic and torus dynamics. Multistability is found to be reduced as a function of quasiperiodic modulation strength. It is argued that occurrence of SNAs gives an opportunity of asymptotic predictability of epidemic growth even when the underlying dynamics is strange. Published by AIP Publishing. [http://dx.",

            "text": "Effects of seasonal variation in the spread of infectious diseases have been a subject of immense interest. The inclusion of seasonality in transmission models has helped in explaining spatiotemporal variations in incidence of infectious diseases such as measles. In general, seasonality is modelled by considering periodic modulation of the transmission rate in epidemic models. The periodic modulation was largely inspired by the fact that spread of measles in school going children is governed by the opening and closing of schools. Seasonality can be more complicated than just being periodic. For example, nonperiodic fluctuations (e.g., quasiperiodic ones) in temperature and precipitation due to climate change may have complicated effects on disease incidence. Such nonperiodic modulation in transmission presents the next level of complexity with respect to temporal variability in disease incidence. In this study, we examine the effects of quasiperiodic modulation in the transmission rate in compartmental epidemic models. A generic analysis of the parameter space across different epidemic models is also presented. We discuss the implication of the creation and coexistence of attractors on dynamical behaviour, such as strange nonchaotic attractors.",

            "text": "Seasonal variation in reported cases of infectious diseases, ranging from childhood diseases (e.g., measles, diphtheria, and chickenpox) to infections affecting all ages like influenza, cholera, and mosquito-borne diseases (e.g., malaria and dengue), is common across temperate and tropical geographies. [1] [2] [3] Although there is a growing body of literature [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] investigating the role of external drivers (e.g., rainfall, temperature, etc.) responsible for seasonal fluctuations in disease incidence, a better understanding of the contributions of external (climate-or environment-driven) versus internal (nonlinearity caused by immune responses in disease dynamics itself) factors to the observed seasonality is lacking and clearly forms an active area of research in the field of mathematical modelling and predictive epidemiology of infectious diseases. 6, 7 In typical seasonally forced models of infectious diseases, the transmission rate (i.e., the per capita rate at which a susceptible individual interacts with an infectious individual and acquires a new infection) is modulated in a periodic fashion using a sine or cosine function. [1] [2] [3] 8, 9 (However, see Refs. 7 and 10 for an exception to this rule.) Although periodic forcing in the transmission term helps explain most of the observed seasonality in disease data, external drivers themselves may not be periodic or, at least, may not remain periodic over time. 6, 11, 12 Instead, these external drivers may have anomalies in the amplitude and/or onset of the peaks that occur in different years. Such irregular dynamic behaviour cannot be captured by a simple sinusoidal function. 6 In physics and engineering sciences, there have been extensive studies in forced oscillator systems. Both the nature of dynamics and the bifurcations in nonlinear dynamical systems are significantly modified in the presence of external forcing. 13, 14 If an unforced dynamical system is dissipative, different behaviours can result, 15, 16 and these issues have been investigated over the decades with particular focus on the different dynamical attractors that can be formed, the various transitions that take place, and their potential applications. 13, 15, 16 In these studies, different types of forcing, most notably periodic, quasiperiodic, and random modulations, have been studied.",

            "text": "One of the characteristic features of temporally forced systems is that they possess multiple coexisting attractors: the dynamics sensitively depends on the initial values of state variables. However, when periodic forcing in these systems is replaced by quasiperiodic one (which introduces variability in the forcing strength because of irregularity in the amplitude and timing of the peak of the driving signal), the number of coexisting attracting states of these dissipative systems is reduced or the coexistence disappears altogether. Attracting states specific to quasiperiodically forced systems such as tori, strange nonchaotic attractors (SNAs) are also created. The dynamics on SNAs is characterised with no positive Lyapunov exponents but with an underlying fractal geometry (i.e., it is discontinuous everywhere). [15] [16] [17] Coexistence of multiple attractors or states has also been observed in the dynamics of epidemic models when the transmission rates are periodically forced. 5, 10, 18, 19 Understanding the mechanisms behind the coexistence of multiple attractors in disease systems, and how the infection trajectories move in and out of the multiple attracting states, has important implications for control programmes. 5, 19 Although it is becoming increasingly apparent that the external drivers (e.g., rainfall, temperature, etc.) of seasonality do not vary in regular, periodic fashion, 6, 11, 12 studies in epidemic models investigating the impact of temporal variability in the strength of the external drivers on outbreak patterns and its implication for control are scarce. Consequently, a better understanding of how internal factors (e.g., immunity) of disease dynamics, in association with variable (as opposed to regular/periodic) external forcing, shape up outbreak trajectories is lacking.",

We contrast the resultant behaviours (in terms of bifurcations and the coexistence of attractors) with those observed under periodic forcing. In doing so, we aim to get better insights about the combined role of external versus internal factors that they play in bringing about the seasonality seen in the incidences of infectious diseases. As hinted in the beginning of this paragraph, the models considered here vary in internal feedbacks on disease dynamics in terms of the effect of immune response in regulating the build-up of susceptibles during inter-epidemic periods necessary for fuelling next outbreaks. With quasiperiodic modulation, we capture the impact of the external feedback that may vary over time in its strength (i.e., amplitude) and/or the onset of the peak in the transmission term. The subsequent sections are organized as follows. In Section II, we describe a set of epidemic models with the temporally forced transmission rate. In the section, we also define the measures used to characterize SNA dynamics. In Section III, we discuss the results on the dynamics of the epidemics models with quasiperiodic modulation in the transmission rate vis-a-vis those obtained with periodic modulation. This is followed in Section IV by discussing the implications of our results.",

The infectives meet one of the two outcomes: either they recover from and become immune to the infection or they succumb to the disease and die, and hence removed from the transmission chain. Additionally, we study the effect of human demographics (i.e., the birth and death rates) into the model dynamics. In our study, the newborns join the susceptible compartment, which means we do not consider vertical (i.e., mother to child) transmission, and the per capita births and deaths are taken to be the same to keep the population size constant, with the total host density scaled to 1.",

Here, the condition for infectives to grow gives a threshold for susceptibles S > 1=R 0 \u00f0t\u00de, where R 0 \u00f0t\u00de is the reproductive ratio. 2, 5 Numerical integration of the model Eq. (1) gives information about how S(t) and I(t) change and infection outbreak occurs with time. The dynamics of epidemic models under periodic modulation of the transmission rate (i.e., \u00bc 0; d 6 \u00bc 0) has been a subject of extensive study. [1] [2] [3] By introducing periodic modulation in the transmission rate, infection dynamics displays a repertoire of periodic to chaotic behaviours. The route to chaos is period doubling. In the periodic modulation case, there is infinite period doubling, whereas in quasiperiodic modulation finite doubling of torus before the onset of chaos. 15 The organization of the dynamics in the d \u00c0 parameter space is shown in Fig. 2 . To obtain the parameter space, we choose for each the initial conditions S ic \u00bc 0:1; I ic \u00bc 0:08; R ic \u00bc 1 \u00c0 S ic \u00c0 I ic at d \u00bc 0, and then using the last coordinate values of the orbit obtained as the initial conditions for next d, separated by 0.001. We calculate the largest nonzero Lyapunov exponent (LLE) of the system and choose the color red wherever LLE is positive and the color white whenever it is zero. The SNA dynamics, which occur at the boundary of the regular and chaotic dynamics, are characterized by the green color. Note that the line \u00bc 0 corresponds to the periodic modulation while nonzero lines, each separated by 0.001 from next, represent the quasiperiodic modulation. Fig. 3 shows the coexistence of multiple attractors for the periodic modulation of the transmission rate in terms of forward ( Fig. 3(a) ) and backward ( Fig. 3(b) ) bifurcation diagrams and the corresponding Lyapunov spectra for forward ( Fig. 3(c) ) and backward (Fig. 3(d) ) bifurcations. When the dynamics is in the periodic regime (e.g., for small d), the frequency of oscillations is the same or an integral multiple of the forcing frequency (taken to be unity here). However, when d is increased, chaotic dynamics is achieved via period doubling route. 20 In the chaotic regime, unpredictable episodes of epidemic outbreaks can occur over time. The forward bifurcation and the corresponding Lyapunov spectrum were obtained by choosing a set of the initial conditions at d \u00bc 0 and then using the coordinates of the orbit obtained as the initial conditions for next d, separated by 0.001. A similar procedure was adopted for the backward bifurcation, beginning at d \u00bc 1=\u00f01 \u00fe \u00de and moving towards d \u00bc 0 in steps of 0.001. This procedure of deriving the attractor types is called the continuation of attractor. It ignores the multiple coexisting attractors 5 while traversing in either direction. However, the coexistence is revealed by comparing the attractors constructed by both the forward and backward procedures.",

To obtain the basins, we used the largest nonzero Lyapunov exponent and the mean square displacement (Eq. (7)) as indicators of orbits. These orbits were obtained by varying the initial conditions in the S ic -I ic plane with R ic being determined by the constraint S ic \u00fe I ic \u00fe R ic \u00bc 1. Clearly, the relevant initial conditions in the S ic -I ic plane are limited to a triangular region with its vertices at (0,0) (1,0), and (0,1).

Consequently, it cannot be claimed that the peak in disease incidence would repeat itself periodically in time, as happens in the periodic modulation case. On increasing the values of d, the dynamics changes from torus to chaos via a finite period doubling route. 15 Strange non-chaotic attractors may be observed at the transition boundary between torus and chaos. A typical feature of SNA is that the dynamics are free from sensitive dependence on initial conditions: two trajectories started with slightly different initial conditions synchronize on the SNA 31 but have non-smooth or fractal geometry. This implies that asymptotically predictable pattern of epidemic outbreaks is possible under quasiperiodic forcing. This is because a SNA trajectory has both contracting and expanding subsets of the attractor and for a sufficiently long trajectory the contracting set dominates, rendering the dynamics free from sensitive dependence on initial conditions. The SNAs are observed at the transition boundary of chaotic and regular motions as one varies d, see the green regions in the two dimensional parameter space shown in Fig. 2 . Examples of the typical bifurcation diagram as a function of d for different values of are shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), both containing the forward (black dots) and backward (red dots) bifurcation plots. Although the bifurcation diagrams for the quasiperiodic modulation case are shown, it is important to note that the dynamics occurs on a quasiperiodic torus and the standard bifurcation theory does not apply: n-branch orbits are converted to T n , etc. The corresponding Lyapunov exponent spectra are shown in Figs. 5(c) and 5(d). Orbits are distinguished from each other based on the Lyapunov exponents (see Section II C) and the phase sensitivity parameter described in Eq. (5) . Typical orbits in the torus, SNA, and chaotic regimes are shown in Figs. 6(a)-6(c), their corresponding phase sensitivity parameters in Figs. 6(d)-6(f), while the distribution of finite time largest Lyapunov exponents, P\u00f0k 1 ; t\u00de with t \u00bc 1000, are shown in Figs. 6(g)-6(i).",

We find that multistability disappears after a critical value c is reached. The critical value c is different for different d.

We stop at a value of d at which an SNA is likely to be observed and scan for the other coexisting attractors and their relative basin sizes.

In these limits, the analysis of SIRS and SEIR does not differ from that of the SIR model. Below, therefore, we present results for these two models when j/r is in the regime which makes them distinct from the SIR model in the dspace. 32 In the SIRS model, if the immunity loss rate j is sufficiently high then the chaotic behaviour is reduced to very narrow ranges of d for the periodically modulated case ( \u00bc 0). When quasiperiodic modulation is switched on ( 6 \u00bc 0), the chaotic regions are further reduced, eventually disappearing altogether above a certain as shown in Figs. 9(a)-9(d). In the periodically modulated ( \u00bc 0) SEIR model, we find that as r ! 0 the chaotic region is reduced to narrow ranges of d before finally disappearing below r \u00bc 10 (see Figs. 10(a)-10(c)). Thus, when the latent period is large, even the periodic modulation of the transmission parameter in the SEIR model is not capable of generating complicated dynamics beyond periodic orbits as r ! 0. However, if for some r chaotic dynamics is observed for a finite range of d then, unlike the SIRS model, the introduction of quasiperiodic modulation 6 \u00bc 0 does not eliminate chaotic regions in the dspace.",

Then, taking the opposite limit j ! 1 would imply the individuals are less likely to stay in the recovered state thereby reducing the dimension of the dynamical equations to two with only S and I as effective variables. Similarly, r ! 0 would mean that susceptible individuals never get to the infective state, thus once again reducing the dimension of the dynamical equation to two with only S and E. It is known that only three or higher dimensional autonomous flows display chaotic behaviour. Thus, the result of our numerical experiments that chaotic regions start depleting as soon as we increase j or decrease r is due to the lower dimensional dynamics taking over even for j and sigma being far from that absolute limit.",

This exclusion is increasingly surfacing as a significant element to be considered in disease modelling (see the arguments put forth in Refs. 6 and 7) as we progressively gather empirical evidence that the external driving signals (i.e., rainfall, temperature, etc.) may indeed vary year-to-year 11, 12 and therefore their impact may not be captured by a sinusoidal wave function.",

In physics and engineering sciences, there have been extensive studies in forced oscillator systems using different forcing functions, including quasiperiodic one, and this study is a first attempt, as far as we are aware of, to apply and investigate the effect of quasiperiodic forcing of the transmission terms in epidemic models. The addition of quasiperiodic element in the temporal modulation of the transmission term gradually (as increases) annihilates multistability, leaving behind only one attractor for each parameter set. Additionally, new dynamical states, such as the SNAs, are created which make the dynamics of epidemics asymptotically predictable although they have non-smooth geometry (chaotic states too have non-smooth geometry). However, in the SNA states there can be unpredictability in outbreaks of disease in finite time.",

In addition, the SIR models considered here are simple in comparison to the models of vector-borne or environment-mediated infectious diseases (such as malaria and cholera, respectively). Year-to-year variation in external forcing factors is likely to introduce temporal heterogeneity in the persistence and density of disease vectors or causative agents (e.g., Vibrio cholerae) in the environment, and this effect will be more pronounced in the regions of marginal environmental conditions. 7 Therefore, the dynamics of more complex disease models under quasiperiodic forcing of the transmission rate will be highly relevant.
