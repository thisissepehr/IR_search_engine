Eight (30o70) survived (HF 5/18, PF 3/9). There was no significant difference in the demographic features between the HF group and the PF group and no difference in mortality. The two groups were pooled to assess the effect of commencement of filtration on clinical wellbeing. Arterial blood gases, electrolytes, full blood examination, ventilator settings and doses of inotropes were recorded immediately prior to commencement of filtration and 18 h after commencement. Serum anion gap and osmolality were calculated using conventional formulae. There were no significant changes in the level of cardiorespiratory support, or biochemical markers of severity following commencement of filtration. Platelet count fell 32~ (p = 0.029) but no bleeding was encountered. No severe complications were observed during 1222 h of filtration. No bleeding or infection was observed at the site of cannulation. One child developed haemodynamic instability following commencement of plasmafiltration necessitating abandonment of the procedure.",

            "text": "Continuous haemofiltration might exert beneficial effects in MOSF via a number of mechanisms: correction of uraemia improves platelet and neutrophil function and reversal of overhydration improves cardiac and respiratory function [7] [8] [9] . However, extracorporeal circulations may cause haemodilution, and increase the risk of infection, embolism and bleeding. Exposure of the blood to artificial surfaces can cause the release of inflammatory mediators and platelet consumption; complement-induced pulmonary leukosequestration may cause a deterioration in gas exchange and hypotension. We observed a 32~ drop in platelet count following the connection of new haemofilters but no clinical bleeding occurred. We observed no significant change in the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient or the ventilatory index during the first 18 h following commencement of haemofiltration and no change in the requirements for inotropes. Biochemical markers were unchanged. Plasmafiltration has been proposed as an experimental treatment for severe sepsis [10] because it removes bacterial toxins and inflammatory mediators. However, Parillo cautioned against its use in sepsis where it may remove beneficial host factors such as immunoglobulins, acute phase proteins and anti inflammatory cytokines [/1]. Data from animal models is balanced. Natanson showed a deleterious effect from plasmapheresis in a canine model of septic shock [12] and Muraji showed a beneficial effect in a puppy model [13] . There are a number of clinical reports of favourable results in human sepsis [3, 4, 14] . The majority of these cases were adults. In our retrospective study of children with severe sepsis, we observed no difference in mortality in the group which had received plasma filtration compared with a comparable group receiving continuous haemofiltration alone. However, the patient numbers were small and the indication for the use of plasmafiltration over haemofiltration was not standardised. Therefore conclusions about the relative efficacy of plasmafiltration compared to haemofiltration are not possible from this study.",
