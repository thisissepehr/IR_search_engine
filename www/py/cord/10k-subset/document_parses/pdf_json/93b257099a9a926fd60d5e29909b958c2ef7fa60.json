The differential impact of statin treatment on mortality between seasons could be due to differences in circulating strains, because the predominant influenza A virus subtype in 2007-2008 season was H3N2, whereas influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus predominated during the pandemic period. Age group-specific attack rates among different influenza subtypes can vary, and differences in immune histories by age could have an impact on the different results between the 2007-2008 season and the pandemic. Statins have been found to modulate anti-inflammatory effects [30] ; whether the difference in apparent efficacy of statins between the 2 seasons could be explained by variation in age-specific immune histories or variation in the degree of cytokine dysregulation caused by the different influenza virus subtypes is an area for additional investigation. However, on further examination, the latter association was measurably sensitive to bias and therefore could reflect omissions of covariate measurement rather than an actual relationship between statin treatment and death after influenzaassociated hospitalization. Data from the 2007-2008 season was previously analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression model [23] . Results from that analysis showed that after controlling for demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, vaccination, and antiviral treatment, the use of statins reduced the odds of death (adjusted OR, 0.59; 95% CI, .38-.92). However, a limitation of observational studies is the lack of random treatment assignment, which can result in sizeable differences in the distribution of covariates between treatment groups. We sought to balance the covariates between the statin-treated and untreated groups by using propensity score analysis.

Recent RCT data have been pessimistic regarding the role of statins in modulating inflammatory responses in infectious disease processes.
