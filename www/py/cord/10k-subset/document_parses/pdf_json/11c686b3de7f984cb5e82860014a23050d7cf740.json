In certain animal tumors, such as murine leukemia, sarcoma, and mammary carcinoma, RNA-containing type C and type B virus particles occur in large numbers. Bioassays have irrefutably proved that these virus particles are the causative agents of these tumors.7821. 27,32 I n some other types of experimental tumors, no mature virions appear but there is oncogenic viral DNA incorporated into the genome of the host cell.9 Not only DNA-but also RNA-containing viruses may exist in the neoplastic cells in the form of subviral structures.lG Cell-fusion, heterokaryon formation, and \"rescue\" by a helper virus may be needed for the maturation of the subviral structures into complete ~irions.16.28~29",

            "text": "Most human tumors when examined in the electron microscope or tested in bioassays appear to be devoid of mature virions. Extensive search is required to find a few elusive viruslike particles in human tumors. Herpes, adeno-and reoviruses, as well as elementary bodies of mycoplasma, occasionally occur in human tumors probably as passengers and not -~ as etiologically important agents.1~8~20 Occasionally, type C and related virus-like particles were found in neoplastic tissues deriving from human leukemia, lymphoma, and sarcoma.8J6 T h e number of these particles rapidly diminishes in cells cultured in vitro; thus, these viruslike particles have never been identified as the human counterparts of oncogenic type C viruses of animals. On the contrary, culturing in vitro, particularly of lymphoid cells deriving from human lymphoma and from other lymphoproliferative entities, results in the rapid increase in the amount of a herpes-type ( E p stein-Barr) virus. 22 Very little attention has been paid in the past to the existence of subviral structures in tumor cells of man. Preliminary findings concerning such structures, however, have recently been reported by Stewart36 who observed the occurrence of filamentous structures and budding type Clike virus particles in tissue cultures of human liposarcoma and Hodgkin's disease. I n the latter case, these structures were identified later as ribonucleoprotein strands of simian paramyxovirus 5. 37 Lymphoid cells grown in culture from patients with infectious mononucleosis4 or from idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura32 occasionally contain lattice-like arrangements of short strands which, in cross section, appear as aggregates of small virus-like particles. The viral nature of these latter structures have been questioned; the structures were presented also as cellular elements.2. 3 Thus, merely morphological studies failed to determine in most instances whether the filamentous structures represented viral nucleoprotein strands or cellular material. If the structures are of viral derivation, it remains CANCER Julie 1971 VOI. 27 unresolved whether these structures are components of a passenger virus or of a virus etiologically related to the induction of mesenchymal tumors of man. Thus, the need for a complex study has become evident. Such a study should deal with the occurrence and morphological features of these hypothetically subviral structures, and it should encompass attempts at isolation and identification of these structures as well as bioassays to establish whether the structures possess any oncogenic potency or not. T h e present paper is a preliminary report on morphological observations concerning structures that may be of viral derivation, as found in biopsies and tissue cultures of human tumors of mesenchymal origin.",
