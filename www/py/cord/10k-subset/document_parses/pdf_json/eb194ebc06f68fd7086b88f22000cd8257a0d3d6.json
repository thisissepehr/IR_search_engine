The child had been previously admitted twice for cough and breathing difficulty; first episode at 5 months of age, and another at 9 months of age. He was treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and oxygen; however, the breathing difficulty persisted. He was born by a full term normal delivery at a hospital with a birthweight of 2.5 kg and had normal neonatal transition. He had been exclusively breastfed until 7 months of age and was on a milk-based diet along with breastfeeds thereafter. He was the only child of the non-consanguineous parents. Father was a smoker and there was no history of contact with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). The child had been immunized for age, but BCG scar was absent.",

As the child was one-year-old, causes like developmental disorders, disorders which are related to systemic diseases, diseases of immunocompromised host, diseases of normal hosts, aspiration syndromes and infections need to be discussed (Table II) . ChILD differs from the adult forms of ILDs because here the injury occurs during the development and differentiation of lung and etiology also includes various genetic and metabolic causes [3] .

As the clinical and radiological features suggested an ILD, oral prednisolone was started at a dose of 2 mg/kg for 14 days followed by tapering over next 4 weeks. The infant responded to steroids initially as his respiratory rate and breathing difficulty decreased though the oxygen requirement persisted. However, on the day 20 of steroid tapering, the child developed marked respiratory distress, fever, lethargy, increasing CRP and features of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with platelet count of 27,400/mm 3 . The child was subsequently intubated and given supportive care in the form of platelets and albumin transfusion. The dose of steroids was again hiked up and antibiotics were added. The child also had pre-terminal worsening of liver and renal functions. The endotracheal aspirate culture showed Acinetobacter spp. Child persisted to have severe sepsis with refractory shock and suffered cardiac arrest and could not be revived.",

Lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis is a known feature of HIV. However, HIV serology was negative and multiple gastric lavage samples for acid-fast bacilli staining were not suggestive. TB would still be a strong possibility as it is endemic in India and pediatric TB is usually paucibacillary [6] . Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, either acquired by perinatal transmission or in a setting of primary immunodeficiency (PID), could result in persistent interstitial pneumonia. However, there was no accompanying thrombocytopenia or transaminitis, and CMV serology was negative. PJP could also result in interstitial shadows, but symptoms are usually acute and it occurs in a setting of primary or secondary cellular PID [2] .

The classic triad consists of iron deficiency anemia, alveolar infiltrates on chest radiograph and hemoptysis which may not be present in all children. However, gastric aspirates for hemosiderin-laden macrophages (HLM) done thrice were negative. Adult type idiopathic ILD can also occur in children and this possibility could not be excluded.

Early use of corticosteroids has been advocated by many authors and is considered a mainstream therapy in AIP [7] .
