An antigenic site, specific for the inhibition of infected cell focus was detected with the focus inhibition neutralization test (FINT), in addition to the neutralization related antigenic sites, which were revealed by the ordinary focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT). Suckling mice were given the MAbs by passive transfer followed by lethal Hantaan virus challenge. All neutralizing MAbs detected by either FRNT or FINT protected all mice from lethal infection, confirming the importance of the antigenic sites as a protective antigen. Mice given non-neutralizing MAbs by passive transfer, however, began to die earlier than the control group; mean time to death (18.2 + 2.1 to 21.5 + 2.8 days) being significantly shorter than that of the control group (25.8 \u00b1 1.8, p < 0.01, Mann-Whitney, U probability test). Virus titers in brains of mice which died early, were about 10 times higher than those of control mice. These results indicated the early death phenomenon of mice which was mediated by the antivirus antibody. 272 J. Arikawa et al.",

Interestingly, clone 6D4 to antigenic site Gl-a-2, which had no neutralizing activity in either F R N T or F I N T , protected all the mice from lethal infection. The experiment was repeated and the same result was obtained. The rest of the non-neutralizing clones were divided into two groups depending on the protective activity from lethal infection.

In paramyxoviruses, when the MAb to fusion (F) protein was contained in the agar overlay medium, plaque formation was effectively inhibited comparing to its plaque reduction neutralization activity [31] . The inhibition of plaque formation is considered to be caused by the inhibition of cell to cell spread of virus infection, since the (fusion) F protein mediated the cell to cell fusion but not relate to the virus attachment to cell. We have reported that Hantaan virus has cell fusion activity underthe low pH condition [2] . Therefore, to examine the neutralization mechanism related to the newly recognized antigenic site, attachment blocking activity as well as fusion inhibition activity of clones 8El0 and 1 C6 will be required.",

All the animals transferred with FRNT MAbs either to G1 or G2 protein were completely protected from Hantaan virus challenge because all the mice survived and most of them showed no sero-conversion (Table 2) . These results were consistent with a recent report by Schmaljohn et al. [23] , in which hamsters were passively protected from infection only with MAbs having plaque reduction neutralizing activity. In addition, MAb clone 8El 0, which recognized the antigenic site related to neutralization discovered here, also protected suckling mice against lethal infection, although it did not protect the mice from infection ( Table 2 ). The MAb may retard the spread of viral infection in mice. The fatal outcome of experimentally inoculated mice or rats was strictly dependent on the age of the animals. Complete resistance from lethal Hantaan virus challenge was gained at two weeks of age in mice [9, t 8] and at one week in the rat [37] . Therefore, the delay in viral spread at an early stage of infection may result in survival at a later stage due to age-dependent resistance. These results confirmed the important role of envelope protein as protective antigen.",

Virus titers in the brains of mice that died early 117.5 x 105 to 1.5 x 106FFU/g), were apparently higher than those of control mice (1.2 x 105 FFU/g), although the virus titers in the lungs were similar. Several animal experiments have indicated that the death of challenged mice is closely related to virus titers in brain tissues and virus titers of a lethal threshold are around 105FFU per gram [17, 18, 28] . Recently, the antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of hantavirus infection to Fc-receptor bearing cells such as macrophages, caused by enhanced binding of virus and antibody complex via Fc receptors on the cell has been reported [36] . Since macrophages are susceptible to hantavirus infection and are believed to be responsible for the spread of infection in mice [ 16] , ADE of infection to macrophages is considered a plausible mechanism for the rapid growth of virus in the brain. To examine if the early death presented here is related to high virus titers in the brain, studies on the kinetics of virus growth in various organs of mice with or without antibody transfer are now in progress. Similar phenomena have been reported in mice challenged with yellow fever and JE [5] , Langat [32] and rabies viruses [19] , as well as cat coronavirus [33] , but few reports have discussed the mechanisms involved. Gould et al. [6] reported that enhanced neurovirulence in mice infected with yellow fever virus is not mediated through Fc and complement receptor-bearing macrophages, but that the cytotoxicity to infected brain tissues is caused by antibodies. There were found to be severe pathologic changes in the brain tissue of antibody transferred mice compared with controls, however virus titers in the brain were similar regardless of pre-existing antibody. In the present study, however, the high virus titers in brain tissues without histological changes suggest a different mechanism from that shown in yellow fever virus infection.",
