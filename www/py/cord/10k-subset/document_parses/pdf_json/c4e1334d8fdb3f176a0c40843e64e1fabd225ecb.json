There are few published studies examining diarrhea in children aged <5 years in Iraq. This study aims to investigate the occurrences and epidemiology of selected bacterial (Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp.), viral (adenovirus, norovirus GI and GII, and astrovirus), and parasitic (Entamoeba spp. and Giardia spp.) agents in stool samples from 155 child diarrheal cases enrolled between March and August 2017, in a hospital-based cross-sectional study in Thi-Qar, southeastern Iraq. Using molecular techniques and sequence-based characterization, adenovirus was the most frequently detected enteropathogen (53/155 (34.2%)), followed by Salmonella spp. (23/155 (14.8%)), Entamoeba spp. (21/155 (13.5%)), and Campylobacter spp. (17/155 (10.9%)). Mixed infection with Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. was evident, and the same was revealed between various enteric viruses, particularly adenovirus and norovirus. The most frequent co-infection pattern was between adenovirus and Campylobacter spp., in seven cases (7/155 (4.5%)). Whole-genome sequencing-derived typing data for Salmonella isolates (n = 23) revealed that sequence type 49 was the most prevalent in this sample set (15/23 (65.2%)). To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first report on detection and identification of floR, bla CARB-2 , and mphA antimicrobial resistance genes in Salmonella isolated from children in the Middle East region. Logistic regression analysis pointed to few enteropathogen-specific correlations between child age, household water source, and breastfeeding patterns in relation to the outcome of detection of individual enteropathogens. This study presents the first published molecular investigation of multiple enteropathogens among children <5 years of age in Iraq. Our data provide supporting evidence for planning of childhood diarrhea management programs.

Within the adenovirus F subgenera, serotypes HAdV-40 and HAdV-41 are associated with significant outbreaks of disease in infants and children [7] . Other viruses commonly associated with acute gastroenteritis globally include noroviruses (NoVs) and human astroviruses (HAstVs) [8, 9] . After enteric viruses, bacterial causes are ranked as the second most common cause of diarrhea in developing countries. Campylobacter is a potential etiological agent of bacterial enteritis both in children and adults, and it is second in prevalence to Salmonella and similar to Shigella in many countries [10] . Non-typhoidal Salmonella spp. are among the leading causes of gastroenteritis worldwide, with an increased incidence observed in children less than five years old [11, 12] . Invasive cases of non-typhoidal Salmonella are frequently reported in infants and young children with a higher risk of secondary complications such as bacteremia and meningitis [13] . In addition, the recent increase of multidrug resistance (MDR) among non-typhoidal Salmonella species is a serious problem worldwide, due to the widespread use of traditional antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, raising global public health concern [14] . Next to viral and bacterial causes, amebiasis and giardiasis are among the major intestinal parasitic infections causing childhood diarrhea in many developing countries [15] , and are endemic throughout socio-economically deprived communities [16, 17] . Given the multifactorial nature of diarrheal illnesses, it is suggested that enteric pathogen co-infections play an important role in gastroenteritis; however, research efforts often focus on a small range of species belonging to a few pathogen groups [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .

However, it is important to note that the pan-adenovirus PCR assay used in this study detects all adenovirus serotypes and not just the enteric serotypes F40 and F41 [33] . Nevertheless, WGS analysis of two of the PCR positive samples collected in this study allowed the extraction of complete genomes of HAdV-41 serotypes, providing evidence that this enteric serotype, as expected, is circulating in the study population in Iraq. Also worth highlighting is that our study design may have impacted our observed frequency of enteropathogens, including HAdV.

Interestingly, recent findings from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study [38] indicate that the fraction of severe diarrheal cases in infants attributed to Campylobacter jejuni or Campylobacter coli ranged from 6% in Kenya to 12% in Bangladesh, which is comparable to the present study finding from Iraq. We also conclude, based on logistic regression analysis, that the likelihood of detection of Campylobacter spp. in children from households supplied by pipe water was higher compared to those supplied with reverse osmosis-treated water.

Children can be exposed to multiple pathogens at home, the playground, and daycare [41] . The presence of mixed infections complicates diagnosis of a specific pathogen responsible for the disease and may result in an additive impact, leading to a more severe clinical disease [42] . Our results also point to an intriguing frequency (4.5%) of co-infection between adenovirus and Campylobacter spp. This co-infection pattern should be viewed in parallel with the results of the logistic regression modeling, as our results pointed to higher odds of adenovirus detection in children exclusively bottle-fed (compared to exclusively breastfed), as well as a higher likelihood of PCR detection of Campylobacter spp. in children from households supplied by pipe water (compared to reverse osmosis water). In settings where potable water may be limited or surfaces contaminated, cleaning feeding bottles adequately may be impossible, placing infants at a heightened risk of infectious disease. The role water plays in the epidemiology of adenoviruses and Campylobacter, as well as the potential health risks constituted by these pathogens in water environments, is widely recognized [43] [44] [45] . Adenoviruses are considered the only DNA viral pathogens in the enteric virus group. They are robust viruses which are non-enveloped with a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome and are, thus, more resistant in the environment, including water sources, than other enteric viruses [44] . A recent multi-country study suggests that treatment of drinking water and improved sanitation reduced risk associated with Campylobacter infection [46] .

Three tetracycline resistance genes (tetB, tetA, and tetG) were detected among the sequenced Salmonella isolates. A study in Iran also found a similar pattern, as the same three genes were the most commonly identified in tetracycline-resistant Salmonella from human stool samples [52] .

In the isolates characterized in the present study, bla CARB-2 and floR genes were all associated with S. typhimurium, with one exception of a strain of S. hadar that harbored the bla CARB-2 resistance gene. A similar finding was demonstrated by Randall et al. [55] who also found bla CARB-2 and floR genes to be linked with S. typhimurium isolated from humans and animals. Using WGS, Nair et al.

However, our study data could not conclude a relationship between caregivers' hygienic practices and occurrence of the other frequently detected bacterial and viral pathogens ( Figure 2 ). It is possible that caregivers' hygienic practice is a limited route of exposure, compared to other sanitary and environmental routes, and, hence, it did not reveal a tangible relationship among the present study samples. It is worth noting that it is not uncommon to experience difficulty in establishing statistical relationships between hygiene-related factors and infections that are multifactorial in nature, as is often the case for diarrheal illnesses. For instance, recently concluded randomized controlled trials that tested the efficacy of improvements in drinking water, sanitation, and hand washing (WSH) in low-and middle-income countries found no significant effects on gut markers of environmental enteric dysfunction, growth at 18 months of age, or diarrhea incidence in two out of three sites [57] . Lack of statistical significance of individual studies should not be taken as implying that the totality of evidence supports no effect.
