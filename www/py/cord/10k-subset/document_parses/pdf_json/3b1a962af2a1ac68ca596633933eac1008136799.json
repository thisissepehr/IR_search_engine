In recent years, many attempts have been made to develop some sensible mathematical models for investigating the dynamics and asymptotic behaviors [3] [4] [5] [6] . Mathematical models take into account foremost factors that govern improvement of a disease, such as vaccination, transmission, recovery etc. The most important factor in the epidemic is asymptomatic or unapparent, where the infectious diseases spread incessantly throughout the population without showing symptoms. Individuals with asymptomatic infection are still infectious and supply to the dissemination of the disease from one human to a different [7, 8] .

These infections are very risky for certain association of people such as pregnant women. The asymptomatic situation may not be identified until the patient undergoes medical tests (X-rays or other inquisition). Therefore, some people may remain asymptomatic for a remarkably long period of time and even they also died.

The most frequent vaccination plan is to immunize all individuals, where the spread of various infectious diseases can be prevented by giving vaccination at a regular rate to the susceptible population on pre or post level [10] [11] [12] . The pre-vaccination of susceptible may reduce the level of an epidemic, which was studied by the several researchers [9, 13, 14] . The cohort (or pre-vaccination) is considered in [9] , where a proportion of newly recruited individuals are vaccinated. While the impact of post vaccination is studied by a number of researchers [15, 16] , and obtained that, to eliminate the disease from the population, vaccination rate must be larger than the critical vaccination coverage otherwise the disease persists in the population.

Some factors, such as density and lifestyle of the population could affect the incidence rate openly or circuitously. Many forms of incidence rates are possible. In the conventional epidemic disease models, bilinear incidence rate \u03b2 S I and standard incidence rate \u03b2 SI N have been studied. The bilinear incidence rate is based on the law of mass action and is a tremendous type, which can't elucidate enhanced the sophisticated phenomena of disease conduction [19] [20] [21] . Moreover, the standard incidence rate may be a good approximation if the number of existing partners is huge enough and each one could not make more contacts than is basically reasonable [9, [22] [23] [24] . The saturated incidence rate \u03b2 SI 1+\u03b1 I , which tends to a saturation level when I gets large, where \u03b2 I measures the infection force when the disease is entering a fully susceptible population, and 1 1+\u03b1 I measures the inhibition effect from the behavioral change of susceptible individuals when their number increases or from the crowding effect of the infective individuals [25] . Capasso and Serio introduced a saturation incidence rate \u03b2 SI 1+\u03b2\u03b4 I (\u03b4 > 0) in [26] , for the cholera epidemic model, where the infection force for a very large number of infective may decrease as the number of infective individuals increases. Saturation incidence rate seems more sensible than the bilinear incidence rate because of it includes the behavioral change and crowding effect of the infective individuals and prevents the unboundedness of the contact rate by choosing suitable parameters [15, 27, 28] .

Intuitively, there might be a considerable difference in the respective transmission probabilities from asymptomatic and symptomatic person to susceptible [8] .

Therefore, the parameter c plays a key role in the disease outbreak of the population. But when c is large, the disease eradication becomes a difficult task, since the associated reproduction number R v will be greater than unity and hence the disease will persist in the population. Moreover, the disease spread can be minimized for small value of c. Therefore, the additional compartment, i.e., asymptomatic (A) is meaning full which contains all those individuals, which transmit the infection in the population. Hence, the number of contact of asymptomatic to susceptible c affects the dynamics of the population. Another most effective parameter in the model system (2.1) is b, which gives the number of infectious individuals with symptoms. For example, b = 1 gives c = 0, i.e., there are no such infectious individuals, which can make contact with susceptible. If b = 0, then all the infectious person belongs to the asymptomatic class.
