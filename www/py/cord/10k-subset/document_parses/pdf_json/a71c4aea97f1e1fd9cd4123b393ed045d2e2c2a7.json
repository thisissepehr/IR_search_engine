First, this is a retrospective and monocentric study with a relatively small sample size. Nevertheless, none of the patients were lost to follow-up, and no data are missing from this cohort. Second, the population studied is relatively unusual, with a high rate of sensitized recipients receiving HTx. However, the proportion of sensitized recipients is increasing, possibly because the technological means to detect pfDSA are evolving. Third, the proportion of HTx recipients assisted with postoperative VA-ECMO support is coherent in this study. Due to the rarity of heart grafts and to the graft distribution prioritization programme, the number of primary graft dysfunctions as well as the preoperative severity of recipients is increasing.
