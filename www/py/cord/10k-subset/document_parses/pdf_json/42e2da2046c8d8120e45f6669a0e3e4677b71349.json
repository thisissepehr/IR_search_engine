New approaches to the theoretical description and experimental verification of electromigration behavior of peptides and to methodology of their separations, such as sample preparation, adsorption suppression, and detection, are presented. Novel developments in individual CE and CEC modes are shown and several types of their applications to peptide analysis are presented: conventional qualitative and quantitative analysis, purity control, determination in biomatrices, monitoring of chemical and enzymatical reactions and physical changes, amino acid and sequence analysis, and peptide mapping of proteins. Some examples of micropreparative peptide separations are given and capabilities of CE and CEC techniques to provide important physicochemical characteristics of peptides are demonstrated.",

In the current era of proteomics, the comprehensive analysis of proteome, representing now the main approach to understand the molecular bases of biological processes and diseases, and to discover new biomarkers and drug targets, the importance of peptides even increasing. The reason for this fact is that both the structure and function of many proteins are identified via their peptide fragments generated by their enzymatic hydrolysis [1] [2] [3] . This \"bottom-up\" or \"shotgun\" approach is one of the main directions in the proteome research [4] . In addition, for more detailed understanding of both normal and pathological processes of the living cells, a comprehensive investigation of the whole peptide set of a cell (peptidome), peptidomics, a logical sequel to proteomics, has emerged [5] [6] [7] .

The classical polymer model with k = 1/2 resulted in slightly better correlation within the whole investigated pH range. The plots of q/M r 1/2 against pH of the BGE were used to predict CE separations of the above hormones and also of the opioid peptides (endomorphin 1, dynorphin A, and enkephalin derivatives) [25] using the accurate acidity constants (pK a ) of the present ionogenic groups (obtained in previous work from the CZE measurement of pH dependence of effective mobilities of these or similar peptides) for calculation of peptide charge. The agreement between the predicted and experimental mobilities was very good and the optimum pH for the separation of the analyzed peptides could be predicted from a limited amount of experimental data. Combination of modeling of peptide mobility and CE-MS was shown to be useful also for a fast and simple characterization of the cleavage specificity of new recombinant enzymes as demonstrated by CE-MS separation of peptide fragments obtained from hydrolysis of cytochrome c by recombinant and natural pepsin A [26] . Modeling of peptide mobility using the calculated pK a values of ionogenic groups [27] helped to elucidate the most probable amino acid sequence of peptide fragments generated by pepsin hydrolysis of cytochrome c and in this way to characterize the pepsin cleavage site.",

[28, 29] log m ep q \u00bc \u00c0k log M r (2) have been used to investigate the structure-mobility relationship of gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRHs) and their analogs and fragments [30] . None of the models was found to be quite definitively applicable for the whole set of ten GnRHs differing in size (tetrapeptide to decapeptide) and charge (10.9 to 13.0 elementary charges) which were analyzed in five conventional and isoelectric acidic BGEs, pH 2.18-2.50. Nevertheless, for the dependence of m ep on q/M r k , the highest coefficient of correlation, R = 0.995-0.999, was obtained for k close to 1/2 for all five acidic BGEs. This indicates that the electrophoretic migration of the set of GnRHs can be best described by the classical polymer model and the most probable structure of GnRHs in the acidic BGEs will be a random coil. The advantage of the application of Eq. (2) is that the value of the exponent k of M r in the nonlogarithmic form of this relationship can be easily determined as a slope of the logarithmic dependence. Graphs of the model of Cross and the most suitable classical polymer model are shown in Fig. 1 .",

In this model, the Offord's charge-over-mass term (q/M r 2/3 ) as one descriptor is combined with the corrected steric substituent constant and molar reactivity descriptors to account for the steric effects and bulkiness of the amino acid side chains. The multilinear regression of the data set showed an improved predictive ability of the model over the simple Offord's relationship. Back propagation artificial neural network models resulted in a further significant improvement of predicted mobilities, especially for larger peptides and for peptides with higher charges containing the basic amino acids, His, Lys, and Arg. Linear and nonlinear quantitative structure-property relationship models for prediction of peptide mobilities in CZE were suggested using the linear heuristic method and a nonlinear radial basis function 50 .

A peptide formed by X amino acids is modeled as N = 2X beads with two beads representing each amino acid in the chain. Peptide conformations are randomly generated and the mobility and diffusion coefficients are computed for at least 100 independent conformations. In general, the mobility is found to be dependent only weakly on peptide conformation, which is in agreement with the small differences of correlation coefficients when different values of exponent k of M r are used in the above Eq. (1) of the dependence of peptide mobilities on the shape of their molecules. The precedence of this model is that the input parameters are independent of experimental mobilities. Hence, it is hoped that the model will be useful in the prediction of peptide mobility as well as in using peptide mobilities to extract information about peptide structure, conformation, and charge. In the other approach, the NMR measured translational diffusion constants of 12 amino acids are used for modeling of diffusion and electrophoretic mobilities of peptides composed of these amino acids [36] .",

Using this broad set of experimental data a semiempirical model was developed allowing to predict pK a values for any oligopeptide composed of amino acids with neutral lateral chains. The input parameters of this model are only the number of residues and the pK a of terminal amino acids in their free form. The model can predict the peptide pK a values at a given ionic strength and temperature and can also be used for selection of the optimum pH for the separation of mixtures of peptides the pK a of which are known or could be estimated.

The method allowed injection of broad sample zones in relatively high-conductivity matrices, without deteriorating peak shape, resolution, and separation efficiency, which makes the method suitable for analyses of real samples. The size of the original sample zone was reduced almost 40 times and the peak height of analyzed peptides has increased more than 120 times. In the next study, the technique was further improved and about 550-to 1000fold sensitivity enhancement was achieved in CE-ESI-IT-MS analysis of peptide hormones and tryptic peptides of cytochrome c, demonstrating the suitability of this approach for PMF in protein analysis and proteomics [58] .",

The in-capillary derivatization was achieved via zone-passing mode by introducing successive plugs of sample and NBD-F into an fused-silica (FS) capillary previously equilibrated with an alkaline borate buffer. To prevent NBD-F hydrolysis and to achieve a reliable derivatization, NBD-F was prepared daily in absolute ethanol and a plug of absolute ethanol was introduced between the sample and NBD-F reagent plugs. NBD-F/sample molar ratio above 215, sample/NBD-F plug lengths ratio equal to 2 and increased temperature of 457C for amino acids and 357C for peptides were found to be optimal for high degree of derivatization.

Thus, suppression of adsorption belongs to the challenging issues in CE of peptides. Various strategies used to suppress the peptide and protein adsorption to the FS capillary or microchip wall have been surveyed in the recent review [85] . In addition to the separations performed in extreme low or high pH and in high ionic strength BGEs, different ways of the FS capillary coatings are employed. Dynamic coatings are based on reversible (dynamic) adsorption of small ions or hydrophilic polymers such as cellulose derivatives or synthetic polysaccharides added into the BGE. Static (permanent) modifications of the inner capillary wall involve the formation of a covalent bond between a suitable derivatized coating agent and the silanol groups of the silica, giving rise to an immobilized polymeric coating, or the bond may be noncovalent but yet \"permanent\" resulting from the irreversible physical adsorption of the polymer, e.g., polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or PEG from the aqueous solution to the capillary wall.",

The polymeric coating is formed by multisite electrostatic interaction between silanol groups and the positively charged nitrogen atoms, and hydrogen bonding due to the hydroxyl groups of the polymer. The physically adsorbed polymer resulted in stable coating within a broad pH range, 2-10, even in the presence of organic modifiers (ACN, methanol) and complex biological samples (plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)). The coating procedure was found to be highly reproducible and provided fast (few minutes) and highly efficient separations of basic peptide hormones, e.g., enkephalins, oxytocin, angiotensin, bradykinin, and proteins, such as lysozym, ribonuclease A, a-chymotrypsinogen A, cytochrome c, and myoglobin. In addition to suppression of peptide sorption, the polycationic coating reversed the EOF and generated strong anionic EOF, which ensured relatively fast migration of all peptides, negatively charged, neutral and positively charged to anode. Moreover, the coating is well compatible with ESI-MS detection.",

This bidimensional CE approach provided an excellent resolution of the peptides with high peak capacity by combining the powerful inherent ZE separation mechanism (different electrophoretic mobilities due to different charge/size ratios) with an hydrophobicity-based mechanism consisting in differences of peptide interactions with BGE constituents, perfluorinated carboxylic acids (trifluoroacetic, pentafluoropropionic, heptafluorobutyric) present in high concentrations (up to 400 mM) and adjusted by LiOH to pH 2.0. Thus, simultaneously with a ZE-based separation of the three differently charged groups of peptides, there is a hydrophobically mediated separation of the peptides within these groups, see Fig. 3 .

The hydrophobic pentafluoropropionic acid anion provided best separation of peptides that differ in hydrophobicity of their hydrophobic side chains but high concentration of the hydrophilic phosphate anion was the best for separation of peptides differing in their polar side chains.

One of the few exceptions is the application of capillary ITP (CITP) to the determination of the purity of lecirelin, synthetic analog of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) [108] . In addition to the determination of the purity of this peptide, CITP has been used also for quantitation of anionic counterions of this strongly basic peptide. More frequently, ITP or t-ITP modes are employed as a preconcentration and/ or preseparation step [66, 68, 109] prior to CE analysis of peptides and proteins present at low concentrations and/or in complex mixtures, such as, e.g., for selective enrichment and ultrasensitive identification of trace peptides in proteome analysis using t-ITP/ZE mode coupled to nano-ESI-MS detection [69] and in combination with carrier ampholyte-based CE (CABCE) mode [67] .",

Different ways of pI determination of proteins and peptides by CIEF are presented and critically evaluated in the review [110] .

This system was applied to determination of peptide and protein concentrations using angiotensin II and human tetrasialo-transferrin as the model analytes [114] . The LOD was 0.22 mM, i.e., about ten times lower than that with UV-detection. Human transferrin could be detected with acceptable accuracy and repeatability at physiological concentration levels (0.5-1.2 mg/mL). A 2-D microcolumn platform consisting of online hyphenated CIEF in hydroxypropylcellulose coated capillaries and neutral stearyl-acrylate (C17) monolithic CEC has been used for separation of model mixtures of 15 peptides, 15 proteins, and albumin-depleted human serum [115] .",

In this technique, the capillary is first partially filled with a zone of ligand followed by a sample plug containing receptor and noninteracting standards. After application of a voltage, the receptor and standards flow into the zone of ligand where a dynamic equilibrium is achieved between receptor and ligand. Due to the continued electrophoretic movement, the receptor and standards migrate through the zone of the ligand plug prior to detection. Evaluation of the change in the relative migration time ratio (RMTR) of the receptor, relative to the noninteracting standards, as a function of the concentration of ligand, yields a value for the binding constant, K b .",

The electrophoresis is then carried out in increasing concentrations of receptors, macrocyclic antibiotics, vancomycin, ristocetin, and teicoplanin, in the BGE. Continued electrophoresis results in a shift of migration times of the peptides upon interaction with antibiotic. Analysis of the change in the RMTR of the resultant complexes relative to the noninteracting standards, as a function of the antibiotic concentration gives the K b .

In HPLC experiments, the variation of ACN content in the mobile phase indicated that peptides are mainly separated by RP mechanism. The weak or negative retention factors observed as compared to C18 silica stationary phase suggested the involment of electrostatic repulsion in acidic conditions. Comparison of HPLC and CEC separations showed that (i) ion-exclusion is more pronounced in HPLC, and (ii) a high ACN content in the mobile phase induced for some peptides an increase of retention in CEC, pointing out the existence of a retention mechanism other than partitioning mainly involved in a chromatographic process. These facts demonstrate that the electric field has an important effect on peptide retention in CEC and that chromatographic retention in CEC cannot be simply predicted from the retention observed, even under identical experimental conditions, in HPLC.",

Another mixed-mode n-alkyl methacrylate-based monolith has been used for separation of therapeutic peptides [142] . While the sulfonic acid (SCX) moiety supported the generation of a stable EOF at both acidic and basic pH, the butyl ligands provided the nonpolar sites for chromatographic resolution. Another CEC mode, open tubular CEC (OT-CEC), which is based on the attachment of thin layer stationary phase to the inner capillary wall [143] , is also used for separation of peptides and proteins. Novel type of capillary columns for OT-CEC are based on etched chemically modified FS capillaries. Fabrication, properties, and applications of these columns have been recently reviewed by pioneers of OT-CEC, Pesek et al. [144] . Etching of the inner capillary wall is performed by heating the capillary at temperature of 300-4007C in the presence of ammonium hydrogen difluoride. Etching process substantially (ca. 1000-fold) increases the surface area, which alleviates the relatively low capacity of the bare FS capillary, and creates a surface that is fundamentally different from the bare FS. After the chemical modification of the surface, the bonded organic moiety forms the stationary phase for OT-CEC. Etched FS capillaries chemically modified with N-butylphenyl and cholesterol-10-undecanaoate [145] have been used for OT-CEC separation of two sets of peptides, each having structurally similar amino acid sequences, and the resolving power of the OT-CEC was found to be superior in comparison with gradient RP-HPLC.",

The theoretical peak capacity of this orthogonal CIEF-CEC platform was estimated as more than 50 000. SEC and CE have been on-line coupled via SPME and Tsplit interface, see Fig. 5 . This 3-D system was applied to peptide analysis in biological fluids [152] . The SEC column fractionated the sample by M r ; the low-M r fraction containing peptides is directed to a C18 SPME column, where the peptides are captured and concentrated. The peptides are desorbed from SPME column by 425 nL ACN, and the effluent is introduced into the T-split interface, which hydrodynamically splits (1:40) the flow and in this way it ensures appropriate injection of analytes into the CE system. The system enabled determination of enkephalins in CSF with LODs of about 10 ng/mL and good linearity over 0.25-100 mg/mL range for injection of 20 mL spiked CSF samples.",

A separate photomultiplier tube is used for detection of the fluorescence in each of the three wavelength ranges. With this detector, analytes can be separated and identified not only by their electrophoretic mobilities but also via their multichannel signature consisting of the ratios of relative fluorescence intensities in each wavelength channel. The LODs for neurotransmitters are in the low nanomolar (attomole) range.",

A novel, rugged sheathless CEand CEC-ESI interface, in which an open tubular separation capillary and an electrospray tip are integrated with a Nafion tubing junction, is coupled to MS detector has been developed for CE and CEC separations of amino acids and peptides [178] . A stable electrospray was generated at nanoflow rates by applying a positive electric potential at the Nafion membrane junction. To sustain the stable spray, an EOF to the spray was supported by coating the FS capillary with Lupamin, a high molecular-mass linear positively charged polyvinylamine polymer, which also serves as stationary phase for OT-CEC separation of peptides and proteins.",

MALDI matrices with high acid concentrations afford enhanced tolerance of CZE buffers to be used for introducing peptides to the mass analyzer. The MS detection enables to detect and characterize also the nonpeptidic parts of peptides and proteins, such as nitration [182] and glycosylation [183] ; e.g., sialylated glycopeptides contained in HPLC fractions of tryptic digest of bovine a1-glycoprotein were separated from asialopeptides by CE. CE effluents were deposited directly onto a metallic target and their off-line MALDI-TOF-MS analysis allowed characterization of four glycosylation sites in the glycoprotein. In addititon, MS/MS was used to confirm peptide sequences and glycan content in the glycoforms. MS/MS detection systems are in general applied to determination of amino acid sequence of CE or CEC separated peptides and proteins [184] . A new technique, (CE-MS/MS)(n), in which multiple CE-MS/MS subanalyses (injections followed by analyses) are performed and experimental variables, such as BGE composition and temperature, are manipulated during each CE-MS/MS subanalysis, has been developed in order to maximize amino acid sequence coverage of complex peptide and protein mixture [185] .",

Under the optimized experimental conditions, in 20 mM sodium borate, 4 mM b-CD, pH 9.25 BGE, linear relationships between the peak height and concentrations of the analytes in normal and second-derivative electropherograms were obtained (0.22-45.00 mM). The LODs for GSH and GSSG in normal and second-derivative electropherograms were 0.046 and 0.012 mM and 0.046 and 0.014 mM, respectively. The sensitivity of the method was sufficient for determination of GSH and GSSG in human plasma and tobacco leaves.

A new CZE method has been developed for determination of GSH and GSSG in microdialysis samples [61] . The analysis was performed in reversed EOF mode using cationic surfactant, 0.5 mM TTAB in 100 mM ammonium chloride BGE, pH adjusted by NaOH to 8.4 . A special, on-column preconcentration technique, pH-mediated base stacking, allowed that even medium-sensitive UV-absorption detection at 214 nm was sufficient for detection of GSH and GSSG in liver microdialysates of anesthetized rats with submicromolar detection limits. On the other hand, the content of GSH in must and wines was assayed by CE with LIF detection [206] . Sample preparation involved conjugating of GSH and other potential thiols with monobromo-bimane (MBB) in CHES buffer. The derivatized GSH and other main nonvolatile thiols were separated in 50 mM phosphate BGE and detected by LIF using diode laser with excitation wavelength 410 nm (close to absorption maximum of MBB-GSH adduct, 390 nm) and measuring the emission of thiol MBBderivatives at 482 nm. The method was used for monitoring the changes in the reduced GSH content in white wines during alcoholic fermentation and barrel aging.

Hydrolysis, isomerization and enantiomerization of two aspartyl tripeptides, with isomeric amino acid sequences, Gly-Asp-Phe-NH 2 and Phe-Asp-Gly-NH 2 , incubated at 807C in acidic (pH 2) and basic (pH 10) solutions, was in detail studied by validated CE methods [215] . Most of the degradation products, including those arising from isomerization and enantiomerization of the Asp residues were CE separated in 50 mM sodium phosphate BGE, pH 3.0, see Fig. 9 . Resolution of comigrating isomers was achieved by addition of CD-based chiral selectors into the BGE. For tripeptide derivatives the assays were linear in the range of 0.015-3.0 mmol/L, for some dipeptides and amino acids the linear range was narrower due to their lower UV-absorption. The LODs were in the range 0.005-0.1 mmol/L. At pH 2, the degradation of peptides proceeded via C-terminal deamidation and peptide backbone hydrolysis, whereas isomerization and enatiomerization were observed in combination with deamidation at pH 10.",

In addition, peptide maps can be obtained also as patterns obtained by separation of peptides present in complex biological fluids, such as serum, plasma, or CSF. Due to the high-complexity of peptide maps, namely of large proteins and biofluids, usually multidimensional separations, 2-DE, 2DE-MS, HPLC-CZE, HPLC-MS, CZE-MS, and HPLC-CZE-MS, are necessary for complete resolution of all peptides present in these mixtures (see Section 5.7).",

In commercial devices the autosamplers are used as fraction collectors and the electroelution is sometimes speeded up or completely replaced by hydrodynamic flow introduced at the inlet end of the capillary. Such system has been used, e.g., for micropreparative fractionation of tryptic fragments of b-lactoglobulin A and B [225] . Peptides in collected fractions are later on concentrated by evaporation of the solvent and off-line characterized by (MALDI) MS or by amino acid and sequence analysis, see Section 8.1.4. For the continuous fraction collection in CE it is necessary to use special designs of the capillary outlet for completing the electrical circuit.

In addition, CE and CEC can be used also for monitoring of the physicochemical processes, e.g., conformation changes during unfolding/ folding processes and velocity of chemical reactions and physical changes. CZE in sieving media can provide data on the size of separated analytes. M r of polypeptides and proteins can be estimated from CZE of their complexes with SDS (capillary version of SDS-PAGE) [113, 242] . Stokes radii and effective (net) charges of peptides can be assessed from effective mobilities measured by CZE and from the different relations between peptide mobility and their charge-to-size ratio. Due to the approximative character of all models correlating peptide mobility with their charge/size ratio the calculated values of charge and size (M r ) represent also only approximative characteristics. Combination of CZE measurement of electrophoretic mobilities of protein/polypeptide charge ladders and classical electrophoresis theory has been suggested to provide data for estimation of the effective (net) charge and size of larger (poly)peptides and proteins [41] . Net charge, hydrodynamic size, and shape of peptides were explored through CZE measured effective mobilities and have been explored using the Linderstr\u00f8m-Lang electrophoresis model and its perturbed version [37] .",

For each peptide family, the pK a values were modeled as a function of the number of residues, temperature, and ionic strength. Using this broad set of experimental data a semiempirical model was developed allowing to predict pK a values for any oligopeptide composed of amino acids with neutral lateral chains. The input parameters of this model are only the number of residues and the pK a of terminal amino acids in their free form. The model can predict the peptide pK a values at a given ionic strength and temperature and can also be used for selection of the optimum pH for the separation of mixtures of peptides the pK a of which are known or could be estimated.",

Nowadays, these techniques are regarded as accomplished complements and/or counterparts of other high-performance separation methods, particularly HPLC. Applications of CE and CEC methods to analysis, isolation, and characterization of peptides are further broadening; CE and CEC are being utilized not only as highly efficient and highly sensitive analytical techniques, capable to determine femtomole to zeptomole amounts of peptides in nano-to picoliter sample volumes of complex biological matrices, but also as valuable physicochemical methods, which can provide important physicochemical and biochemical characteristics of peptides, such as their effective mobilities and charges, M r 's, acidity constants of their ionogenic groups, diffusion coefficients, association constants of their complexes, conformation of their molecules, and rate constants of their reactions. Peptides represent an extremely numerous class of vitally important biomolecules. Many of them and a lot of their functions have been recognized but even more have to be revealed and elucidated. For a more detailed understanding of living processes, a comprehensive investigation of a whole peptide set of a cell, organ, or organism (peptidome), i.e., peptidomics, has to be performed. Also the structure and functions of proteins in proteomic studies are mostly identified via their peptide fragments. Hence, undoubtedly, the analysis, purification, and characterization of peptides will belong to the most challenging tasks of CE and CEC methods also in the future. As concerns these techniques themselves, their development will proceed to implementation on microfluidic devices and integration into mTAS, on-line coupled with high-sensitive LIF or MS detection. Multidimensional separation systems based on hyphenation of CE, CEC, LC, and MS techniques will be necessary for analysis of complex peptide and protein mixtures in peptidomics and proteomics.
