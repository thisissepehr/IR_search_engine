The Pepitope server is a web-based tool that aims at predicting discontinuous epitopes based on a set of peptides that were affinity-selected against a monoclonal antibody of interest. The server implements three different algorithms for epitope mapping: PepSurf, Mapitope, and a combination of the two. The rationale behind these algorithms is that the set of peptides mimics the genuine epitope in terms of physicochemical properties and spatial organization. When the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the antigen is known, the information in these peptides can be used to computationally infer the corresponding epitope. A userfriendly web interface and a graphical tool that allows viewing the predicted epitopes were developed. Pepitope can also be applied for inferring other types of protein-protein interactions beyond the immunological context, and as a general tool for aligning linear sequences to a 3D structure.",

Solving the threedimensional (3D) structure of an antibody-antigen complex is the most accurate way to determine an epitope. When such a complex is not available (or cannot be obtained), a customary approach is to map the location of the epitope using a phage display library (Barbas et al., 2001) . In this technology, peptides that bind the antibody of interest with high affinity are selected from a large pool of random peptides. These affinity-selected peptides are assumed to mimic the genuine epitope in terms of their physicochemical properties and spatial organization. Hence, a resemblance of a selected peptide to a linear region of the antigen is often indicative of the genuine epitope location.",

These algorithms were proved successful in predicting discontinuous epitopes based on affinity-selected peptides (Bublil et al., 2006 (Bublil et al., , 2007 Enshell-Seijffers et al., 2003; Mayrose et al., 2007; Tarnovitski et al., 2006) . Furthermore, the combined algorithmic option executes both PepSurf and Mapitope and combines their results into a single epitope prediction. Pepitope enables the alignment of short, hypothetical or synthesized, sequences to a 3D structure and is thus not confined to mapping random peptides derived from phage-display experiments. Pepitope also provides a powerful visualization tool to examine the predicted epitopes and each of the peptide-to-structure alignments. It allows non-expert users to predict epitopes with no previous algorithmic knowledge, yet incorporates advanced options for expert users to fine-tune their predictions.",

Thus, the best alignment of each peptide to antigen residues brought to proximity by folding is obtained. The resulting most significant alignments are then clustered and the epitope location is inferred. The Mapitope algorithm (Bublil et al., 2007) is based on an alternative computational approach in which epitope determinants shared by the entire set of peptides are detected. Specifically, each peptide is first deconvoluted to amino acid pairs. Mapitope then identifies pairs of residues that are significantly overrepresented in the panel of peptides. It then searches for a cluster of these enriched pairs on the antigen 3D structure to obtain predicted epitope regions.",

Using the Contact Map Analysis server (Sobolev et al., 2005) , 19 surface residues of FVIII were identified as comprising the 'genuine epitope' and were used as the benchmark epitope when determining the prediction accuracy. Bo2C11 was used to screen a combinatorial phage-display library resulting in a set of 27 affinity-selected peptides (Villard et al., 2003) . Figure 1 illustrates the main Pepitope output. Pepitope predicts an epitope that significantly overlaps the benchmark epitope. The predicted epitope is comprised of 30 residues, of which 12 are part of the genuine epitope. The 18 remaining predicted residues, although false-positive predictions, are located in Fig. 1 . The epitope prediction obtained by the PepSurf algorithm for the Bo2C11\u00c0FVIII complex (PDB id 1IQD). The FVIII antigen is shown as a space-filled model with the predicted epitope in red. The Bo2C11 antibody Fab fragment is shown as a backbone model.",
