Among the estimated 35,000-50,000 annual cases, approximately 20-30% of patients die and 30-50% of survivors have neurologic or psychiatric sequelae (Solomon, 2003; Fischer et al., 2010) . JEV vaccines are usually made with Nakayama-NIH, Beijing-1, or SA14-14-2 strains. Formalin-inactivated vaccines are produced from the prototype Nakayama and Beijing-1 strains, and a live attenuated vaccine is produced from SA14-14-2. Great strides have been made in recent years toward controlling JEV, spurred by improved and expanded surveillance in endemic countries, increased availability of safe and effective JEV vaccines, and introduction of JEV immunization programs in several countries (Elias et al., 2009; Halstead and Thomas, 2010) . At present, vaccination and surveillance of JEV antibodies in humans are considered very important public health measures (Abe et al., 2003; Jmor et al., 2008) . Methods for measuring antibodies against JEV include hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests, complement-fixation tests, neutralization tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), among others (Lee et al., 1999; Markoff, 2000; Konishi et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2006; Biswas et al., 2009; Ahsan and Gore, 2011) . A new approach for measuring virus-neutralizing antibodies dispenses with the virus completely and uses instead an \"infectious\" vector that expresses viral E protein or E/prM proteins, with or without genes that encode \"reporter\" molecules (Pierson et al., 2006) .

This test is based on the principle that infectious virus can be neutralized by specific antibodies, resulting in a loss of the ability to infect permissive cells (Simoes et al., 2012) . The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is a specific serological test used to identify JEV infection in diagnostic laboratories and to evaluate the neutralizing antibody (NAbs) response of vaccines. The PRNT is the 'gold standard' for detecting and quantifying JEV NAbs (Shyu et al., 1997; Ting et al., 2001; Roehrig et al., 2008) . The NAb test using chick embryo (CE) cells or Vero cells has been adopted for the assessment of antibody in human serum (Abe et al., 2003) , and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of BHK-21 cells for quality testing of JEV vaccines (e.g., using the virus-inactivation test), as well as for estimating potency using the PRNT assay (Hombach et al., 2005) . PRNTs of JEV utilize live, biohazardous JEVs, and require a cell culture facility, considerable technical expertise in growing and titrating JEV plaques, and an appropriate biosafety level laboratory (BSL3) (Johnson et al., 2009; Lobigs et al., 2010) . In order to overcome these shortcomings, we constructed a pseudotyped murine leukemia virus encoding JEV (Nakayama-NIH) E protein and \u03b2-galactosidase (Lee et al., 2009). Using this pseudotyped virus (PV), we developed a simple, rapid, and safe neutralization assay system (JEV-PV) in Vero cells.
