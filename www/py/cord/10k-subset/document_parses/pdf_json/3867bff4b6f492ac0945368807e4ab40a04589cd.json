These and early clinical studies suggest that nutritional therapy with PPIs may similarly assist in restoring homeostasis to gut barrier function in humans experiencing mild or more acute enteropathic symptomatology such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. This meta-analysis evaluated the ability of PPIs to promote weight gain and food intake in weanling animals, primarily piglets, after oral challenge with various enteric pathogens or bacterial toxins. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched from 1980 through August 2012 for specified terms and keywords. Twenty-nine articles retrieved through this process were evaluated; 11 studies including 13 experiments were selected for inclusion in the analysis. The meta-analysis included descriptive analyses and methods for combining P values for the primary endpoint, average daily growth (ADG) at week 1, and secondary endpoints including ADG, average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain to feed ratio (G:F) at weeks 1 and 2 and at the end of study. Primary and secondary endpoint analyses of growth (ADG, ADFI, and G:F) were significant (P < 0.01). The proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) 1b, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor a were significantly lower in animals fed dietary PPIs.

The overall health of animals during weaning is considered to be compromised due to the existence of various stress factors, including immature intestinal enzymes and other digestive secretions, discontinued access to beneficial factors in colostrum and early milk, and developmental changes during maturation of the intestinal microbiota and immune system. Jiang et al. (14) evaluated growth performance in piglets after pair-feeding a diet containing soy protein or PPIs for 24 d. Protein intake was similar among groups, although the rate of weight gain and protein conversion efficiency was significantly higher in the PPI group, especially during early weaning. Pigs fed PPIs had improvements in body weight and protein mass with no difference in fat mass, suggesting a higher efficiency of dietary protein utilization for lean tissue growth. Feeding PPIs reduced the circulating concentrations of urea, arginine, citrulline, and ornithine, suggesting a reduction in the catabolism of amino acids to urea and increased availability of dietary amino acids for lean tissue mass. In addition, there were significant increases in bone mineral content and bone mineral density in PPI-fed pigs compared with soy protein-fed pigs. Pierce et al. (54) conducted several experiments to evaluate the growth and feed intake of weaned piglets fed porcine PPIs, bovine PPIs, or different molecular-weight fractions of PPIs. These investigators reported that both porcine and bovine PPIs enhanced growth rate and feed intake of weaned piglets, whereas the IgG fractions appeared to stimulate growth performance that was comparable to that for intact PPIs and superior to that for the albumin or low-molecular-weight fractions of PPIs. These data suggest that a distinct nutritional role may exist for the IgG-rich fraction of PPIs to support growth performance.

Most studies showed improvements in caloric intake, growth and metabolism, and utilization of feed nutrients after PPI supplementation in healthy piglets. In addition, improvements in weight gain and feed intake in piglets were found to be consistently greater with PPIs than with feeding comparable amounts of other high-quality protein sources (e.g., meat extracts, soy, pea, potato, skimmed milk, whey, and fishmeal).

Although a number of studies that evaluated PPIs in challenged animals were not included in this systematic review, several reported consistent findings that shed light on the potential mechanism of action of PPIs. For example, Corl et al. (44) evaluated PPI-and soy protein-based diets in rotavirus-infected and noninfected weanling piglets to assess effects on acute rotavirus-induced intestinal damage or improved recovery. Infected, PPI-fed piglets maintained growth rates similar to those of noninfected piglets and showed no clinical signs of diarrhea during the first 3 d of infection, whereas soy protein-fed piglets experienced reduced weight gains and diarrhea. Yi et al. (43) did not report 14-d growth data but found that spray-dried plasma (SDP) mitigated villous atrophy and intestinal morphology impairment in weaned piglets after Escherichia coli challenge. In a study reported by Bhandari et al. (59) , piglets fed PPIs and challenged with E. coli had lower diarrhea scores (P < 0.05) and increased survival (P < 0.05) compared with pigs fed a control diet, but they did not show significant improvements in ADG, ADFI, or G:F by day 7 postinfection. P\u00e9rez-Bosque et al. (60) did not study growth but evaluated the potential modulatory effects of dietary spray-dried PPI or ICs on intestinal barrier function in rats after exposure to SEB. In this study, PPI and IC supplementation reduced the effects of SEB on dextran and horseradish peroxidase paracellular flux, suggesting possible maintenance of intestinal permeability to prevent the passage of microbial and food antigens to the interstitial space and inflammation. In a series of other studies, P\u00e9rez-Bosque et al. (48, (61) (62) (63) examined whether PPI and IC supplementation could modulate cytokine expression and inflammatory mediators in rats challenged with SEB. Both PPI and IC diets reduced intestinal water secretion vs. control diets, thus improving nutrient absorption and electrolyte homeostasis (48) . Compared with the control diet, PPIs and ICs also reduced SEB-induced increases in lymphocyte populations with specific functions in inflammatory states. The PPI diet prevented major activation of CD4+ cells induced by SEB, indicating that rats fed PPIs did not develop the same degree of activation of T helper cells, and prevented the SEB-induced increase in the gd-T lymphocytes. Several other studies among those that were excluded from this analysis also showed positive effects of feeding PPIs (41, 45, 46) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 160, "end": 164, "text": "(19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 561, "end": 565, "text": "(44)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1003, "end": 1007, "text": "(43)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1234, "end": 1238, "text": "(59)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2010, "end": 2014, "text": "(48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2015, "end": 2019, "text": "(61)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 2020, "end": 2024, "text": "(62)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 2025, "end": 2029, "text": "(63)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 2304, "end": 2308, "text": "(48)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2811, "end": 2815, "text": "(41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2816, "end": 2819, "text": "45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2820, "end": 2823, "text": "46)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "P\u00e9rez-Bosque et al. (62) also evaluated the potential modulatory effects of diets containing added PPIs or ICs on lamina propria and intraepithelial lymphocytes (diffuse gut-associated lymphoid tissues) in the same model of mild intestinal inflammation induced by intraperitoneal administration of SEB. In lamina propria, SEB increased the cytotoxic lymphocyte populations of gd-T cells by 38%, NK cells by 59%, and the number of activated T lymphocytes by 148%. Both PPIs and ICs significantly decreased the effects of SEB on these lymphocyte subsets. In the epithelium, SEB induced a 117% increase in intraepithelial activated lymphocytes that was also significantly reduced by PPI supplementation (although not IC supplementation). The effects of plasma supplements on intestinal lymphocyte populations suggest that oral PPIs can modulate the degree of activation of diffuse gut-associated lymphoid tissues. In a follow-up study, P\u00e9rez-Bosque et al. (61) found that SDP inhibited the increase in IFN-g, IL-6, and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) induced by SEB. SDP supplementation increased IL-10 and mature TGF-b concentrations in intestinal mucosa from both SEB-challenged and control animals. Both immunoglobulin supplements were effective at preventing the SEBinduced increase in proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory cytokine ratios in Peyer's patches, mucosa, and serum. Other studies reported similar effects of dietary PPIs in terms of decreasing cytokine expression or T cell activation in animal models of colitis (64, 65) .

The administration of SEB significantly reduced D-Glc transport and expression of D-Glc transporters in intestinal brush border membrane vesicles. Dietary spray-dried PPIs increased D-Glc transport by 10% compared with the SEB group. Changes in D-Glc transport due to SEB and to PPIs were correlated with changes in the number of sodium-glucose linked transporter 1 (SGLT1) transporters present in the brush border membrane. It was estimated that PPIs included in the diet increased glucose absorption by 8-9% in rats challenged with SEB during the interdigestive periods.
