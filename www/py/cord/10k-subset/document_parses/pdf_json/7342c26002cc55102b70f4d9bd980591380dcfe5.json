            "text": "The small GTPase Rab5 has been well defined to control the vesicle-mediated plasma membrane protein transport to the endosomal compartment. However, its function in the internalization of vascular endothelial (VE)cadherin, an important component of adherens junctions, and as a result regulating the endothelial cell polarity and barrier function remain unknown. Here, we demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) simulation markedly enhanced the activation and expression of Rab5 in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs), which is accompanied by VE-cadherin internalization. In parallel, LPS challenge also induced abnormal cell polarity and dysfunction of the endothelial barrier in HPMECs. LPS stimulation promoted the translocation of VE-cadherin from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments, and intracellularly expressed VE-cadherin was extensively colocalized with Rab5. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)mediated depletion of Rab5a expression attenuated the disruption of LPS-induced internalization of VE-cadherin and the disorder of cell polarity. Furthermore, knockdown of Rab5 inhibited the vascular endothelial hyperpermeability and protected endothelial barrier function from LPS injury, both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that Rab5 is a critical mediator of LPS-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction, which is likely mediated through regulating VE-cadherin internalization. These findings provide evidence, implicating that Rab5a is a potential therapeutic target for preventing endothelial barrier disruption and vascular inflammation.",

Endothelial permeability is essential for the inflammation pathogenesis underlying many diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2] . Endothelial barrier function is regulated by adherens and tight junctions. The assembly and organization of adherens junctions precede the formation of tight junctions, which have important functions, including the establishment and maintenance of cell-cell adhesion and actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Vascular endothelial (VE)cadherin is an endothelial-specific transmembrane component of adherens junction complexes that plays key roles in the maintenance of vascular integrity [3, 4] , including rearrangement of the cytoskeleton [5] , establishment of cell polarity [6] , and tight junction remodeling [7] .",

The establishment and maintenance of cell polarity are critical to several cell and tissue functions, including cell division, cell migration, neuronal synaptic transmission, epithelial and endothelial barriers, and lumen formation. There are at least four types of cell polarity: anterior-posterior polarity, migratory polarity, apical-basal polarity, and planar cell polarity (PCP) [10] . It has been well established that a cell polarity complex consisting of partitioning defective 3 (PAR-3), PAR-6, and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) plays a crucial role in the development of apical-basal polarity in epithelial cells [11] [12] [13] . In addition, PAR3 and PAR6 associate directly with VE-cadherin to regulate tight junction integrity [14] [15] [16] [17] . Studies have shown that the loss of VE-cadherin causes the mislocalization of PAR3 and abnormal endothelial cell polarity [6] . However, the relationship between cell polarity and VE-cadherin in microvascular cells, especially regarding the regulation of endothelial permeability, remains unclear.",

The activation of Rab5a (Rab5a-GTP) was determined using a pulldown assay, and the expression of Rab5a protein was assessed by Western blot using an anti-Rab5a polyclonal antibody. The activity and expression of Rab5a were significantly increased after LPS challenge for 1, 6, and 12 h (Fig. 1a, b) . The levels of active Rab5a were increased to 1.66-fold, 2.01-fold, and 3.15-fold in the 1, 6, and 12 h group, respectively, compared with the 0 h group (p \\ 0.05, Fig. 1b ). Rab5a expression after 6 h LPS challenge was also augmented by approximately 1.5-fold compared with the 1 h group (p \\ 0.05, Fig. 1a, b) . There was no significant difference in the protein levels of Rab5a following 1 and 12 h of LPS treatment (p [ 0.05). We also found that the activity and expression of Rab5a was increased by other inflammatory agents, including thrombin and TNF-a (Suppl. Figure 1 ). The levels of active and total Rab5a obviously increased to 2.48-and 2.12-fold after stimulation with thrombin for 0.5 h, compared with the control group (Suppl. Figure 1A ). TNF stimulation for 5 min strongly enhanced the activation of Rab5a without altering the total expression of Rab5a, whereas TNF stimulation for 30 and 180 min consistently increased both the activation and the total expression of Rab5a (Suppl. Figure 1B ). We then detected the effect of LPS stimulation on the localization of Rab5a in HPMECs using immunofluorescence methods. The results showed that Rab5 was predominantly localized at the transport vesicles and less at the control cell plasma membrane. After LPS stimulation, the fluorescence intensity of Rab5a was obviously increased in both the cytoplasm and the membranes of HPMECs compared with control cells (Fig. 1c) .

First, we detected the expression of VE-cadherin and F-actin protein after LPS challenge via WB. As shown in Fig. 2a , VE-cadherin was primarily located at the membrane fraction, which was clearly decreased by LPS stimulation. After LPS treatment, VE-cadherin expression in the membrane fraction was decreased by 27.1, 54.1, and 36.3 % after LPS stimulation for 1, 6, and 12 h, respectively. VE-cadherin expression in the membrane fraction was also reduced by 37.1 % in the 6 h group compared to the 1 h group (p \\ 0.05, Fig. 2b ). There was no significant difference in the membrane protein level of VE-cadherin between 1 and 12 h of LPS treatment (p [ 0.05), while the cytosolic levels of VEcadherin was increased to 1.7-fold or 4.4-fold than that in the control group at 1 or 6 h after treatment (p \\ 0.05, Fig. 2c ). In contrast, LPS stimulation did not alter the total amounts of VE-cadherin as well as the expression of F-actin (Fig. 2a) . These results suggest that LPS induces VE-cadherin internalization. Second, we used immunofluorescence microscopy to analyze the LPS-induced morphological changes in HPMECs. HPMEC monolayers were cultured on Transwell inserts and stimulated with 1 lg/ml LPS for 6 h. Under control conditions, VE-cadherin appeared as a continuous line along the interendothelial cell border. Immunostaining for F-actin with rhodamine-phalloidin revealed a predominance of circumferential actin bundles and few stress fibers. After LPS challenge for 6 h, VE-cadherin immunostaining was interrupted and reduced, leading to the formation of intercellular gaps (indicated with arrows, Fig. 2c ). In parallel, LPS-induced F-actin reorganization and intercellular gap formation and increased stress fiber formation (arrows indicate intracellular gaps, and arrowheads indicate stress fibers, Fig. 2d ). These results demonstrate that LPS induces VE-cadherin disassembly and actin cytoskeleton remodeling in endothelial cells, thereby disrupting endothelial barrier integrity.",

We found that neither knockdown nor overexpression of Rab5a had any obvious effects on the total VE-cadherin expression (Fig. 5a) . However, the LPSinduced decrease in the membrane fraction of VE-cadherin was significantly reversed by Rab5a siRNA transfection. The data indicated that the expression of VE-cadherin in the cell membrane was dramatically reduced to 44.1 % of that in the controls, and the cytosolic VE-cadherin levels increased to 77.0 %, in response to LPS-alone treatment (p \\ 0.05, Fig. 5b) . However, pretransfection with Rab5a siRNA followed by LPS treatment could effectively prevent the loss of VE-cadherin from the membrane, which decreased to 75.9 % of that in the control cells; while the cytosolic VEcadherin levels decreased to 46.1 % (p \\ 0.05, compared with the control and LPS-alone groups). VE-cadherin expression in the cell membrane of the Rab5a overexpression plus LPS group was markedly reduced to 61.2 % of that in the controls (p \\ 0.05). Fluorescence imaging analysis was conducted to examine barrier dysfunction in HPMECs, which was characterized by the formation of intercellular gaps (Fig. 5c ). After stimulation with LPS, similar to the aforementioned changes in VE-cadherin, VE-cadherin expression was reduced, leading to the marked intracellular gap formation in the NC siRNA plus LPS group, the NC plasmid plus LPS group, and the Rab5a WT plasmid plus LPS group (indicated with arrows). In comparison, HPMECs transfected with Rab5a siRNA showed minimal effects on the barrier integrity. The area of intercellular gaps was quantified (Fig. 5d ) and shown to be 0.846, 1.377, 1.639, and 2.291 % in the NC siRNA group, Rab5a siRNA group, NC plasmid, and Rab5a WT group, respectively. There was no significant difference compared with the NC siRNA group (p [ 0.05). After LPS treatment, the area of intercellular gaps was increased in all groups. It was 9.979, 4.380, 10.487, and 11.771 % in the NC siRNA plus LPS group, Rab5a siRNA plus LPS group, NC plasmid plus LPS group, and WT Rab5a plus LPS group, respectively. However, pretransfection of Rab5a siRNA before LPS stimulation markedly inhibited the formation of intercellular gaps compared with that of LPS alone (p \\ 0.05). These results suggest that Rab5 siRNA can protect the localization of VE-cadherin from LPS injury in HPMECs.",

There are many mechanisms that regulate VE-cadherin, such as regulating VE-cadherin activity through phosphorylation and managing the amount of VE-cadherin localized at the cell surface [34] [35] [36] [37] . It has been shown that p120-catenin and b-arrestin can directly associate with VE-cadherin and regulate endothelial barrier function. The interaction of p120-catenin and VE-cadherin prevents the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of VE-cadherin and maintains endothelial barrier function, while b-arrestin promotes the internalization of VE-cadherin into clathrin-coated vesicles [35, 36, 38] . In this report, we confirm that LPS induces VE-cadherin internalization and reduces the amount of VEcadherin expression at the plasma membrane [39] . In agreement with previous studies [39] [40] [41] , we also observed that LPS induced actin cytoskeleton reorganization in HPMECs, causing stress fiber and intracellular gap formation and disrupting endothelial barrier function (Fig. 2) . It has been shown that promoting the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of VE-cadherin reduces the available amount of VE-cadherin in the plasma membrane and disrupts endothelial barrier function. As an early endosome marker, Rab5a plays a crucial role in clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Therefore, the mechanism of LPS-induced VEcadherin internalization may be related to the enhanced expression of Rab5a.",

We also found that in the absence of Rab5a, the internalization of VE-cadherin induced by LPS was significantly reduced, as were intercellular gaps. Inhibition of Rab5a also prevented F-actin rearrangement and inhibited stress fiber formation. These Prior to this study, Rab5a was mainly known to regulate the clathrin-dependent internalization of multiple cell surface receptors, such as G protein-coupled receptors [25, 26, 42, 43] . Rab5a was also shown to be involved in cell junction protein endocytosis and recycling. In epithelial cells, calcium depletion leads to a rapid clathrin-dependent internalization of several junctional molecules, including JAM-A, occludin, ZO-1, E-cadherin, and b-catenin, and these internalized junctional markers colocalize with Rab5a [44] . Coyne et al. [29] reported that Rab5a and Rab34 participate in Coxsackie virus invasion by regulating the internalization of occludin in Caco-2 cells. In endothelial cells, Rab5a also regulates the redistribution of JAM-A and claudin-1 localization [27, 28] . It has been reported that Rab5 participates in actin remodeling induced by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) [45] .On the other hand, Andrea Palamidessi et al. [30] have shown that Rab5 activates Rac and actin dynamics. Several studies have injection. Evans blue tracer (40 mg/kg) was injected 24 h after the LPS challenge. The lungs of the mice were harvested 2 h after Evans blue dye injection, and pulmonary transvascular permeability was measured. The data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SE, n = 4. *p \\ 0.05 versus the control group;^p \\ 0.05 versus the NC siRNA plus LPS treatment group. d C57BL/6 mice were injected via the tail vein with NC siRNA or Rab5a siRNA, and 20 mg/kg LPS was injected 5 days after transfection. The mice were killed 24 h after LPS injection. Lung tissue samples were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde, dissected, and subjected to H&E staining (original magnification 9200, 9400). e Mice in the control and Rab5a siRNA groups were injected with 40 mg/kg LPS i.p., and their survival was monitored. Differences in mortality were assessed using the log-rank test. The experiments were performed with ten mice in each of the two groups. *p \\ 0.05 versus the control group found that active Rac in endothelial cells can cause vascular hyperpermeability, and Rac has been shown to be involved in TNF-a-and VEGF-induced increases in vascular permeability [46] [47] [48] [49] . In addition, LPS can induce the activation of Rac in the lungs in vivo, and inhibiting the activation of Rac with the Rac inhibitor NSC23766 alleviates LPS-induced lung injury [50] . Therefore, the mechanism through which Rab5a regulates VE-cadherin localization and actin cytoskeleton organization as demonstrated in this study may involve Rac activation and the subsequent induction of junctional disassembly and cytoskeleton remodeling.",

However, similar investigations have only recently elucidated the molecules controlling endothelial cell polarity. VE-cadherin, cerebral cavernous malformation protein 1 (CCM1), and b1 integrin can regulate endothelial cell polarity via a PAR3-dependent mechanism [6, 55] . Moreover, PAR3 can interact with VEcadherin, JAM-2, and JAM-3 to regulate tight junction stability and endothelial barrier integrity [14, 16, 17, 56] . In addition, the arrangement of the actin cytoskeleton might be implicated in cell polarity [57] . Whitehead et al. [58] reported that CCM2 can limit Rho activation and thereby reduce endothelial cell contractility and vascular permeability. It is possible that CCM2 may also contribute indirectly to the establishment of cell polarity by reshaping the cytoskeleton. All of these findings demonstrate the close relationship between cell polarity and endothelial permeability.",

We initially found that LPS induced VE-cadherin internalization, resulting in the disruption of apical-basal cell polarity and endothelial barrier dysfunction (Figs. 2, 3, 7) . Because knocking down Rab5a expression was able to attenuate LPS-induced VE-cadherin internalization and F-actin remodeling, we investigated whether Rab5a modulated the LPS-induced disruption of cell polarity as well. Our results demonstrated that knocking down Rab5a expression reversed the LPS-induced abnormal cell polarity. It has been shown that Rac1 and Cdc42 regulate cell polarity [59] . As discussed above, Rab5 can induce Rac activation [30] . Therefore, the inflammatory mediator LPS may activate the Rab5a-Rac-VE-cadherin signaling pathway to disrupt endothelial cell polarity and barrier function.",

Consistent with our in vitro results, Rab5a depletion was found to accelerate LPS-induced lung microvascular permeability and inflammation (Fig. 10) . However, previous studies have mainly focused on changes in the active GTP-bound form of Rab5a after stimulation. In our work, we observed that the expression of active and total Rab5a was up-regulated after LPS challenge, and the depletion of Rab5a prevented LPS-induced endothelial barrier function and lung injury. These results are consistent with the findings of Wang et al. [60] who reported that Rab10 expression was increased upon LPS stimulation in both dendritic cells and macrophages, and overexpression of Rab10 in macrophages enhanced LPS-induced acute lung injury. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Rab5a is critical for LPSinduced endothelial hyperpermeability. Because in addition to endothelial cells Rab5a siRNA transfection in vivo may also reduce Rab5a expression in other cells, the mechanisms by which Rab5a regulates endothelial barrier function in vivo needs further investigation.",
