Viruses enter the host cells to replicate. using host synthetic mechanisms, and. thus, are resistant to conventional antibiotics. The human body responds to viral infection by synthesising specific antibodywhich can be used to aid diagnosis. Infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever) commonly affects the 15 to 30 years age group. It may produce severe debility which may last a month or more. Coxsackie virus infection can produce symptoms ofthe common coldbut may also invadeheart muscle and produce myocarditis, a potentially serious disease. Otherviruses also produce a wide spectrum of disease.",

The majority of viruses enter the body via the respiratory tract, then individual cells by penetrating the cell membrane and displacing host control mechanisms. Usually the cell produces many viruses which are then released by either cell lysis or by budding from the cell.

Influenza A produces an upper respiratory tract infection with an associated malaise which is usually quite severe. It tends to occur in pandemics. Influenza Band C have a more sporadic pattern to outbreaks and produce less severe symptoms (see table I ).

However, there may also be more subtle reasons for increased susceptibility to infection. Various forms of stress have been shown to alter immune function. Jemmott et al. (1983) showed in a group of dental students, that levels of secretory IgA in saliva fell during the stress of major examinations. They suggested that the increased adrenaline levels associated with stress may inhibit both humoral 300 and cell-mediated immunity. A direct action of the central nervous system on thymus (Bullock & Moore 1980) or spleen (Williams et al. 1981 ) may modulate the immune system and corticosteroids which are elevated by stress may also be important. Dorian et al. (1981) have shown that lymphocyte response to mitogens is impaired when under stress. Strenuous exercise in mice has been shown to increase susceptibility to Coxsackie B3 infection (Reyes & Lerner 1976) and Douglas & Hanson (1978) have reported an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infection in training athletes. Thomasi et al. (1982) examined secretory IgA levels in Nordic cross-country skiers before and after national cross-country races. They found a significant fall in mucus IgA, one of the main defences of the upper respiratory tract to infection. Thus, either exercise itself, or the emotional stress attached to athletic competition may render the athlete more susceptible to various infectious diseases of the respiratory tract, although this is by no means proven (Simon 1984) .",

In a survey of 78 sudden deaths during, or immediately after, exercise, Jokl and Mclellan (1971) found a history of recent upper respiratory tract infection in 5 out of 78, cardiovascular problems accounting for most of the remainder. It is difficult to prove that intercurrent viral illness increases the risk of death during exercise, but there are numerous anecdotal reports of death in young healthy people who undertake vigorous exercise during an acute viral illness. The predilection of Coxsackie virus for the heart muscle to produce myocarditis or pericarditis (Smith 1966) could explain, by increasing the risk of acute arrhythmias, sudden death in young fit people. Burch (1979) advised that young people who stress themselves with vigorous, prolonged physical exercise during upper respiratory tract infections have an increased risk of developing viral cardiomyopathy, causing irreversible damage to the heart muscle. This illness may have a fatal outcome. Burch (1979) stated that strenuous physical exercise should be avoided for 2 weeks after the infection has resolved. Sutton et al. (1967) described a case of a previously fit 42-year-old patient who undertook a vigorous swimming session while recovering from an upper respiratory tract infection. He subsequently died of heart failure. At postmortem examination, Coxsackie B4 virus was isolated from the myocardium. Pether (1982) described 2 patients who exercised while convalescing from influenza B upper respiratory tract infections. Both contracted bacterial meningitis and one died. Pether suggested that heavy exercise might have been a contributory factor to the increased susceptibility to infection and advised against strenuous exercise for 1 week after a flu-like illness. Jodselson et al. (1980) described a 26-year-old runner who developed acute rhabdomyolysis (acute muscle destruction) following a training run. He required emergency treatment to prevent renal failure developing. He had no symptoms suggestive of recent viral illness, but investigation revealed evidence of acute echovirus 9 infection.",

Despite the occurrence of either local upper respiratory symptoms or even none at all, 301 the virus may be disseminated via the blood stream to many organs. Furthermore, I have already described evidence that infections may run a protracted course. One way in which viruses could affect performance is by a direct effect on skeletal muscle. Friman (1977) tested a group of subjects who had recent viral infections. He assessed isometric strength in the recently infected subjects and in a matched control group. There was a significant reduction (up to 15%) in isometric strength in the infected subjects which had not fully recovered to reference values one month after illness. Astrom et al. (1976) , in a controlled test, examined muscle tissue obtained from patients recovering from recent viral or mycoplasma illnesses. They found significantly reduced muscle enzyme activity (glyceraldehyde phosphate, lactate dehydrogenase, cytochrome oxidase and citrate synthetase) in infected patients. Furthermore, electron microscopy showed focal abnormalities in muscle ultrastructure. These changes had almost completely resolved when muscle biopsy was repeated 3 months after illness. The muscle enzyme changes described were similar to those found in certain muscle diseases with muscle weakness as a main symptom. Electron microscopic appearances were nonspecific, as occurs in most muscle diseases. Excess glycogen stored in abnormal muscle would suggestthat muscle energy utilisation had been altered.",

As a result, they are not affected by conventional antibiotics. There are various humoral and cellmediated mechanisms which aid recovery from viral infections. Various viruses produce well-recognised acute effects but may also be followed by more subtle changes. There are risks of serious complications including death, if strenuous exercise is undertaken during an acute viral infection. Viral infections may present with loss of performance as the only symptom. There are many possible explanations of this loss of form, but there is evidence from several approaches that skeletal muscle function may be altered.",

The development of reliable antiviral IgM antibody assays, high levels of which are evidence of recent infection, should help clarify the situation (Dories & Ter Meulen 1983). Lau (1983) surveyed cardiac and non-cardiac patients and also a normal population for evidence of recent Coxsackie virus infection. Between 30 and 60% of normal subjects had evidence of previous Coxsackie BI-5 infection; 8.6% of non-cardiac patients had evidence of recent Coxsackie infection and 8.9% of non-cardiac patients had evidence of recent Coxsackie infection. Thus, Coxsackie virus infection is a common condition. Postviral fatigue syndrome (or epidemic myalgic encephalomyelitis) is an increasingly recognised condition. It usually occurs after Coxsackie virus infection",
