Here we employed the mouse lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) model, and found that IDO is necessary to achieve the effect of human umbilical cord-derived MSC (hUC-MSC)-based treatment on ALI. Notably, when IDO was deleted or inhibited, the expression of TSG-6 was decreased. This specific IDO-mediated regulation of TSG-6 expression was found to be exerted through its metabolite, kynurenic acid (KYNA), as inhibition of KYNA production led to decreased TSG-6 expression. Importantly, KYNA pretreatment of human MSCs enhanced their therapeutic effect on ALI. Mechanistically, KYNA activates aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which directly binds to the TSG-6 promoter to enhance TSG-6 expression.

Various factors have been demonstrated to mediate MSC-based immunosuppression in both in vivo and in vitro experimental systems [22] . Among them, IDO is pivotal in mediating the suppressive effect of human MSCs on adaptive immune responses, since blockade of IDO expression or its function in human MSCs can disrupt their immunosuppressive function [6, 7] . Yet, little is known about its role of IDO in MSC-based regulation of innate immune response, especially in in vivo settings. To address this, we firstly employed MSCs derived from human umbilical cord (hUC-MSCs; Supplementary Fig. 1 ), and established stable IDO knockdown (IDO-KD) cell line using lentivirus transfection (Fig. 1a) . Next, we employed the LPS-induced ALI model in BALB/c mice through intranasal administration of LPS. These mice showed increased number of total cells and neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid at 48 h after LPS administration (Figs. 1a, b) . Their lung histology also exhibited widespread septal thickening, significant increases in air-space cellularity and exudation, and significant interstitial immune cell infiltration (Fig. 1c ). Using this model we examined the therapeutic effect of control MSCs and IDO-KD MSCs. After pretreatment with IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, MSCs were injected intravenously after LPS administration. As expected, administration of control MSCs resulted in significant alleviation of lung inflammation, as indicated both by cell number in BAL fluid and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of lung tissue sections. In contrast, when IDO-KD MSCs were used, the inflammatory status was unaffected compared to control group, indicating that IDO is important in mediating the therapeutic role of MSCs (Figs. 1a-c). To further confirm the role of IDO on the infiltration of neutrophils, we next performed immunohistological staining for Gr-1, a well-known marker of neutrophils. As expected, decreased neutrophil infiltration was found in control MSC-treated mice, while IDO-KD MSC treatment abolished this effect (Fig. 1d) .

As IDO is critical in the therapeutic effect of MSCs on ALI, we next examined whether this effect is exerted through regulating the expression of any of these molecules. We first checked the expression profile of these factors in IDO-KD cells. We found that TSG-6 production was dramatically inhibited in IDO-KD MSCs on both the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2a) . To exclude any off-target effect, we also performed small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection to knockdown IDO and found that TSG-6 expression was similarly reduced ( Supplementary  Fig. 2 ). These data suggested that IDO could regulate TSG-6 expression in MSCs. Interestingly, when we looked at the expression of other molecules, we found that the expression levels of Ang-1 or KGF were unaffected (Figs. 2b, c), and IL-1R\u03b1 expression was not detectable (data not shown).

After the treatment of exogenous rhTSG-6, we found that ALI was significantly alleviated, as evidenced by reduced number of infiltrated immune cells, specifically neutrophils, in the lung. In contrast, TSG-6-KD MSCs had little therapeutic effect (Figs. 3a-d). These data suggest that IDO expressed by MSCs alleviates ALI through regulating the expression of TSG-6. To further verify the role of TSG-6, we co-inject IDO-KD MSCs with rhTSG-6 to ALI mice, and found that the effect of IDO-KD MSCs was completely rescued by rhTSG-6 ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). To verify whether this relationship between IDO and TSG-6 also exists in other diseases mediated by innate immunity, we next established zymosan-induced peritonitis model, which has been reported to respond to human MSC treatment through secretion of TSG-6 as well [15] . We performed similar treatment and, as expected, the therapeutic effect of control MSCs was impaired in this peritonitis model when the expression of either IDO or TSG-6 was compromised. In addition, not only neutrophil, but also macrophage infiltration was regulated in a similar pattern (Supplementary Fig. 4) .

Furthermore, when we examined the IDO-mediated immunosuppressive effect of MSCs on T cells, we found that, compared to control MSCs, IDO-KD MSCs lost their ability to inhibit T cells as expected, and TSG-6-KD MSCs could still significantly suppress T-cell proliferation in vitro. This confirmed that TSG-6 has no effect on IDO expression and the subsequent suppression of T cells ( Supplementary Fig. 5B ).

Surprisingly, among all these enzymes tested, only kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II), which mediates the catalysis of KYN to KYNA, was found to be highly expressed in hUC-MSCs, indicating that KYN and KYNA might be the main tryptophan metabolites (Fig. 4c) . Indeed, when examining the concentration of all possible tryptophan metabolites in hUC-MSC supernatant by highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC), we found that only KYN and KYNA were abundantly produced (Fig. 4d) . Next, to explore whether any of these two molecules can affect TSG-6 expression by hUC-MSCs, we treated MSCs with KYN or KYNA, and examined the expression TSG-6. We found that only KYNA-treated MSCs exhibited higher levels of TSG-6, compared to untreated controls (Fig. 4e) . The effect of KYNA on TSG-6 expression was further confirmed by the finding that siRNA inhibition of KAT II, resulted in decreased concentration of both KYNA and TSG-6 in the MSC supernatant (Figs. 4f-h).

AhR is one of the most recognized member of the basic helix-loop-helix-PER-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) subgroup of the bHLH superfamily of transcription factors, which is known to be activated by ligands, including dioxin and the IDO-derived metabolites, KYN and KYNA. Upon interaction with ligands, AhR translocates to the nucleus and forms a heterodimer with AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT), which binds to the xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE) sequences, leading to transcription of a wide variety of genes that participate in various cellular processes [28] [29] [30] .

In recent years, small molecule metabolites have been increasingly recognized as playing important roles in gene regulation, which is believed to be an essential mechanism that links gene expression with a cell's metabolic state [31, 32] . However, the molecular mechanisms that relay signals from metabolites in the tissue microenvironment to induce an appropriate gene expression response remain poorly understood. A better understanding of the mechanisms connecting metabolic intermediates to specific gene expression would have important ramifications for disease and development. In the present study, we demonstrate that IDO is critical in controlling TSG-6 expression in inflammatory cytokine-primed human MSCs as demonstrated in vivo in our ALI model and peritonitis model. Such regulation relies on the IDO-catalyzed metabolite, KYNA, rather than KYN, catalyzed by IDO. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that KYNA activates AhR to result in its nuclear translocation, thereby directly promoting TSG-6 expression by binding to its promoter (Fig. 6f) . IDO has long been recognized as a metabolic regulator of the immune responses in both MSCs and other immune cell types [9] . By catalyzing the first and rate-limiting step of tryptophan catabolism along the kynurenine pathway, IDO causes consumption of local tryptophan that is essential for proliferating cells, particularly immune cells [9] .

In addition, KYN has also been demonstrated to promote the differentiation of Tregs and ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [11] . In contrast, although it shares the same receptor AhR [13] , KYNA differs from KYN in several respects. KYNA has little cytotoxicity, and it may exert distinct impacts in different inflammatory context. In one study, KYNA was found to inhibit IL-10 expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages, and exacerbate atherosclerosis progression [31] . While other studies demonstrated that KYNA exerts an immunosuppressive function by modulating the expression of inflammation-associated genes, such as TNF, IL-6, and matrix metalloproteinases [13, 37, 38] .

However, it has been difficult to verify TSG-6mediated immunosuppression of neutrophils by human MSCs in vitro, because we found that cytokine-licensed human MSCs secrete, in addition to TSG-6, a large amount of CXCL8, which would dampen the inhibitory function of TSG-6 on neutrophil migration (data not shown).
