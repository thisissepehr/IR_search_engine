The natural presence of a highly conserved prokaryotic transposable element in diverse sequences of eukaryotic organisms seems highly unlikely and is believed to be a contaminant originating from the E. coli strain DH10B. The evidence to support this assertion is based on the observation that the majority of the IS10R-contaminated eukaryotic sequences detected in the databases were from BAC clones, and the fact that the E. coli DH10B strain is commonly used as a host for BAC libraries. However, more-definitive evidence was provided by hybridization and PCR-based detection of this element in the DH10B stock (obtained from Life Technologies, Inc) used as a host for the P. vulgaris BAC library. The detection of 9-bp direct repeats flanking IS10R in the database entries removes the possibility that sequence contamination could have occurred in silico. In some instances, the contaminated sequences have been annotated with regards to the presence of IS10, but the contaminating sequence has not been filtered out.

This copy is an autonomous mobile element because, in contrast to IS10L, it has a functional transposase . The analysis presented here suggests that IS10R alone is present in the E. coli DH10B strain used in the construction of the P. vulgaris BAC library. This is probably true for the other BAC libraries. The presence of multiple hybridizing fragments on a Southern blot of genomic DNA of untransformed DH10B can be ascribed to the presence of multiple copies of the element in the DH10B genome. Eichenbaum and Livneh (1995) observed that transposition of IS10R was usually accompanied by an increase in the number of fragments that hybridized with the IS10R probe. The proposed mechanism of transposition is based on the fact that IS10R transposition is controlled by dam methylation. It is hypothesized that excision occurs in one of the hemimethylated sister molecules soon after the replication fork passes the IS10 element.

The strong hybridization signal produced by 30G19 can be explained by a polarity effect (Szeverenyi et al. 1996) . It has been reported that transposition of IS elements upstream from ORFs can bring about increased levels of expression. An increased level of expression of CM R could give a selective advantage and result in increased growth and a higher hybridization signal. At the present time, we do not know whether transpositions into the cloned DNA are intermediary stages before the element ends up at the preferred vector site upstream from the chloramphenicol resistance gene. The presence of IS10R within the genome of the host commonly used for BAC libraries presents serious problems. Perhaps the most obvious of them is the detection of false homologies after transposition into the insert, as indicated earlier. However, this problem can be overcome by appropriately filtering BAC sequences before submission. Another problem can be encountered during fingerprinting of BACs when the mutant population(s) increases to a significant level. More troublesome is the potential problem of alterations in the cloned sequences that can vary from short duplications to deletions and inversions Binns 1993 ) and co-integrate formation in RecA + strains (Einchenbaum and Livneh 1995). We have only monitored the fate of a small sample of clones after continuous daily subculturing for a short period of time. A more detailed analysis of BAC clones is needed before the long-range fate of IS10R-contaminated BAC libraries can be ascertained. BAC clones from libraries known to be contaminated with IS10R can still be utilized as long as some properties of this element are taken into account. The rate of transposition of IS10 has been estimated at 10 \u22124 per element per generation (Kleckner et al. 1996) , and transposition of this element is negatively regulated by dam methylation (Roberts et al. 1985) . However, continuous incubation at the stationary phase (Skaliter et al. 1992) , as well as exposure to UV radiation (Eichenbaum and Livneh 1998) , can increase the rate of IS10 transposition. Taking into account the properties of the transposable element during the handling of BAC libraries or individual clones may avoid or ameliorate the negative effects of the element.
