            "text": "In contrast to contamination by microbes and mycoplasma, which can be relatively easily detected, viral contamination present a serious threat because of the difficulty in detecting some viruses and the lack of effective methods of treating infected cell cultures. While some viruses are capable of causing morphological changes to infected cells (e.g. cytopathic effect) which are detectable by microscopy some viral contaminations result in the integration of the viral genome as provirus, this causes no visual evidence, by means of modification of the cellular morphology. Virus production from such cell lines, are potentially dangerous for other cell cultures (in research labs) by cross contaminations, or for operators and patients (in the case of the production of injectable biologicals) because of potential infection. The only way to keep cell cultures for research, development, and the biotech industry virus-free is the prevention of such contaminations. Cell cultures can become contaminated by the following means: firstly, they may already be contaminated as primary cultures (because the source of the cells was already infected), secondly, they were contaminated due to the use of contaminated raw materials, or thirdly, they were contaminated via an animal passage. This overview describes the problems and risks associated with viral contaminations in animal cell culture, describes the origins of these contaminations as well as the most important virsuses associated with viral contaminations in cell culture. In addition, ways to prevent viral contaminations as well as measures undertaken to avoid and assess risks for viral contaminations as performed in the biotech industry are briefly described.",

            "text": "Since the development of viral vaccines, animal cell technology has been used for the production of biologicals for prophylaxis and therapy of humans and animals. As many of these products are injectables, the microbiological safety is of particular importance and is a permanent concern. Whereas microbial contaminations (fungi, yeasts, and bacteria) can be rather easily detected via cultivation methods, the detection of mycoplasma and viruses is more difficult because they are not observable by routine light microscopy. However, fluorescence microscopy, mycoplasma amplification and culture techniques, ELISA and PCR are well developed for determining the extent of mycoplasma contamination. Viral contamination, on the other hand, represents a greater concern because viruses require more complex and frequently need highly sophisticated detection methods (see later). In addition the potential for viruses to cause silent infection of cell culture needs to be addressed, negative results do not always signify that there is no virus contamination. Viral infection can originate from contaminated cell lines, contaminated raw materials, or from a GMP breakdown in the production and purification process (Minor, 1996) leading to a virus-contaminated final product. In addition, although downstream processing is able to eliminate or inactivate certain viruses, not all viruses can be eliminated in such a way because they can be resistant to elimination and/or inactivation steps. Viral infection can be highly pathogenic, and in contrast to microbial infection, there are frequently no effective treatments available, this requires serious consideration to be given to the prevention of contamination. As a result of this everything possible has to be done in order to maintain the entire manufacturing process, and thus the final product, virus-free.",

            "text": "-In contrast to bacterial and fungal contamination, viral contamination cannnot be easily detected, because they cannot be observed by normal light microscopy. It is only when a viral contamination leads to a morphological modification of the cultured cells, such as a cytopathic effect, that a contamination by a virus can be suspected. Silent infection by viruses with no observable morphological modification of the infected cell are clearly of greater concern. -A restricted number of viruses can infect cells and can integrate as a provirus, as in the case of Adeno-Associated virus (AAV), for instance. In this case, the provirus is present, but cannot replicate without the assistance of a helper virus, when one is present both virus species will be produced, together (Mayor and Melnick, 1966; Mayor et al., 1967; Hoggan et al., 1972; Berns et al., 1975) . -Virus contaminated cell cultures represent a risk for the operators, collaborators, patients, as well as for non-contaminated cell cultures. -Cells contaminated with some viruses can show a change to their susceptibility to infection by other viruses. For example some safety testing proto-cols require indicator cells to be used to show the presence of virus, if these are chronically infected by viruses this reduces their susceptibility to other virus species, this in turn, can lead to false negative results, because the virus to be detected can no longer infect the indicator cells. -As a general statement, cell lines contaminated by viruses cannot be treated to become virus free. The result of this is that potentially valuable cell lines will have to be discarded and replaced by new, non-contaminated cells. One of the few exceptions to this rule is the case of Lactate Dehydrogenase virus (LDV). Cultures of cells recovered from a passage in infected animals contain this virus; however, as this virus cannot infect the cells, it will be diluted during subsequent in vitro passaging and thus will be lost (Nicklas et al., 1993; Nakai et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "In order to avoid viral contamination or reduce the incidence it is helpful to know the source of the contamination. Viruses can be introduced by a limited number of different routes and knowing this provides the possibility to avoid infection. The identified routes of infection are: (i) the cells used to produce the production cells are already contaminated by exogenous virus because the cells were already contaminated at source, e.g., the donor animal from which the cells were explanted (see 'Contamination via the cell source'), the pre-culture (in vitro), or the in vivo passage in an animal led to the virus contamination (see 'Passages via virus infected animals'). (ii) Endogenous viruses, such as retroviruses are a particular concern. Several cell lines of biotechnological importance, such as murine hybridomas or Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, contain endogenous retroviruses and can produce retroviral particles during production. In the case of murine retroviruses these can be capable of replication, as observed with hybridoma cells, or which are incapable of replication, as in the case of CHO-cells (see 'Cell lines of biotechnological interest-endogenous retroviruses and other cell associated/latent viruses'). (iii) The cell cultures can be contaminated by viruses which were present in the animal derived materials used in the manipulation or for the growth of the cells. These types of materials include serum or trypsin (see 'Use of contaminated raw materials'). Animal derived raw materials are of particular concern as many different animal viruses can potentially be present originating from the use of infected source animals. Non-animal derived raw materials can also be contaminated by viruses due to contact with virus shed from animals or man from production until its eventual use in the medium of which they are a component. (iv) Finally, errors made by the operator can also result in viral contamination of animal cells (see 'Handling errors of the operator').",

            "text": "Primary cells derived from explants or continuous cell lines immortalised/transformed by viruses can be contaminated by adventitious viruses. Primary cell cultures derived from animal tissues are seldom used for the production of vaccines for humans but are more frequently applied for veterinary use. When the donor animals are already latently infected with viruses the subsequent in vitro cultures of cells derived from these animals may be infected. If such primary cells are then used for the production of viral vaccines, these vaccines are likely to be contaminated with the adventitious virus. In the period between 1954 and 1961, when primary kidney cells from macaque or rhesus monkeys were used for the production of poliovirus vaccine, this vaccine was frequently contaminated by SV40. The source of this virus was from the kidney cells of infected monkeys (Sweet and Hilleman, 1960; Shah and Nathanson, 1976 ) (for details, see 'Passages via viruses infected animals'). Young immunocompetent rhesus or macaque monkeys can readily be infected with SV40 by the oral, intranasal, and subcutaneous routes, and viremia and viruria occur in these animals (Shah et al., 1969) . The use of such animals as source for kidney cells may lead automatically to a SV40 contaminated primary kidney cell culture because the virus may persist in the kidneys in a latent form (Shah et al., 1969) . Similar observations were made with secondary lamb kidney cells, which are widely used for the production of veterinary vaccines. In the case described, an attenuated Aujeczky's Disease viral vaccine was produced on lamb kidney cells. The master virus stock used for the production had become contaminated with the Border Disease virus due to the contamination of the cell culture used for its production. The vaccination of the sows with this vaccine during the first third of their pregnancy led to the infection of the fetuses which led to a disease similar to classical swine fever (Vannier et al., 1988) . Leiter et al. (1978) reported on the establishment of a mouse epithelial pancreatic cell line which was persistently infected by a polyoma virus. The origin of this infection was not completely clear, but it seemed probable that the mouse which was the source of these cells was also the source of the virus.",

Subsequently primary cells, in particular primary monkey kidney cells, were used for the production of this virus. Although the use of such cells was very convenient and the first accepted way to produce a viral vaccine, the source of these cells (the primary monkey kidney cells) was associated with a number of problems particularly with the introduction of a number of viral contaminats. The advantage of the use of primary cells for the vaccine production system was that it was the first in vitro system for the production of viral vaccines, that high titers of viruses could be obtained, and that the system could be scaled up to a reactor stage by using microcarriers . However, it has been recognised that, this system could be prone to contamination originating from the donor animals. The frequency of contaminants may have been due initially because, the animals were caught in the wild with no control of the disease risks with these animals, leading to a high incidence of contaminations by adventitious viruses. Stones (1977) reported that 40-80% of the cultures of kidney cells from Vervet monkeys were positive for adventitious agents. As mentioned, many of the viruses which infect primates are pathogenic for humans, the species barrier is being able to be crossed (Eloit, 1997) .",

In addition, the barrier may only be a quantitative issue (quantity of active virus, e.g. the LD 50 of rabies virus in mice is 10 6 times higher by the oral than by the intracerebral route) and is a question of the route of administration (e.g. the mucous membrane is a rather efficient barrier, however, when a virus is inoculated parenterally, the species barrier is no longer valid). Finally, even in the case of an abortive replication cycle, cell transformation via the expression of early viral genes is still possible, eventually leading to a transformed phenotype of non-permissive cells (e.g., mouse cells are transformed by SV40, which in monkey cells leads only to a lytic cycle, or non-permissive cells transformed by bovine polyomavirus) (Eloit, 1997 (Eloit, , 1999 .",

This virus is latent in these monkeys, but causes fatal disease in man. Twenty cases were fatal and seven had severe sequelae. The second example concerns the contamination by the Marburg virus.

These monkeys had been imported into Germany for vaccine production by using their kidney cells. More details can be found in Peters et al. (1992) .",

            "text": "A further relevant example from the production of poliovirus vaccine is provided by SV40, a polyomavirus which is an extremely common infection of macaques and rhesus monkeys (Shah and Nathanson, 1976) where it persists in the kidneys in a latent form without causing a cytopathic effect (Sweet and Hilleman, 1960) . This virus grows much more slowly than poliovirus and thus an infection might not be observed during the vaccine production. It is estimated that almost everybody who was vaccinated against poliovirus between 1954 and 1961 also recieved viable SV40 together with the poliovirus vaccine. This is true for the live attenuated as well as for the inactivated poliovaccine, because, in the first case, no inactivation step was applied and, in the second case, the formalin inactivation step was insufficient to inactivate SV40 (Sweet and Hilleman, 1960) . Whereas in the case of the live vaccine, the route by mouth is a poor route for infection with SV40 (Sweet and Hilleman, 1960) , others were injected with inactivated poliovaccine together with infectious SV40. A long-term follow-up study with a small number of individuals, as well as the observation that, in spite of the large number of vaccinees (10-30 millions of 98 millions who were vaccinated, or almost 90% of individuals under 20 yr in 1961 (Shah and Nathanson, 1976) ) which are believed to have received infectious SV40, showed no corresponding increase in related cancers (Shah and Nathanson, 1976) . It should be mentioned, however, that (i) DNA-sequences of SV40 have been detected in association with different human tumors and at an higher incidence in mesotheliomas (Horaud, 1997) , (ii) that SV40 isolated from primary monkey kidney cells by Sweet and Hilleman (1960) induced sarcomas in newborn hamsters (Eddy et al., 1961) , and (iii) that SV40 is oncogenic for laboratory rodents (Magrath, 1991) .",

He and his coworkers screened cell lines intended for vaccine production and found that approximately 1% of human embryonic kidney cells and 20% of African green monkey kidney cells produced AAV when infected with helper adenovirus. These results suggested that AAV stayed in an integrated form in the absence of helper virus and that this inapparent infection was a rather frequent natural occurrence. Hoggan et al. (1972) could prove by using Detroit 6 cells that a deliberate infection with AAV in the absence of helper virus led to a latent infection. A superinfection with helper adenovirus led to the induction of AAV replication.",

By using one animal the frequency of SV40 contamination was about 20%.

This signifies that mouse viruses are potential contaminants of these cell lines and their products. These viral contaminants can be divided into two groups; group 1 contains viruses which are also known to cause human diseases or to be able to infect human cells, while group 2 contains other mouse viruses (Table V) (Minor, 1996) . Although Ectromelia virus is listed in group 2, cultures infected with this virus are only processed in the special P4 unit available at the NIH (Hay, 1991) . Ectromelia, a member of the orthopoxviurs group, is a natural pathogen in mice, and is able to replicate in all mouse lymphoma lines, in some hybridoma cell lines, and in BS-C-1 cells (Buller et al., 1987) . Consequently, the ATCC has screened its collection of murine cell lines but no characteristic cytopathic effects have been observed (Hay, 1991) . Moore (1992) listed the mouse viruses which had been detected in production cell banks of hybridomas: LMCV, MVM, Sendai, LDH, and epizootic diarrhea virus of infant mice. The present view is that hybridoma cell lines should be tested for the viruses indicated in Table V , and only those should be used for biotechnological applications which are free of these viruses. The only acceptable viral particles in bulk supernatants from hybridoma cell lines are those of endogenous origin.",

            "text": "The most important cell lines of biotechnological interest, mouse hybridomas and CHO cells, are known to contain endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and are known to produce retroviral particles. ERVs exist in 2 forms, a viral form and a proviral form. Retroviral proviruses are transmitted through germ cells and are present in the genomes of almost all vertebrates thus far studied. Humans possess many ERV genomes related to mammalian C type retroviruses and to A, B and D types of this family of viruses. The presence of ERV-like sequences in a cell line to be used in the production of a biological is a potential cause for concern because of the possibility that the endogenous retrovirus may be activated and result in infectious virus being present. particles (IAP) as well as budding C-type particles (Table VI) . With respect to IAPs, Anderson et al. (1990) demonstrated, that the CHO cells' genome contained approximately 300 copies of viral sequence per haploid genome. No intact open reading frame for gag, pol, or env could be detected in clones of either family (Anderson et al., 1990) . In addition, no infectivity has been associated with A-type retroviruses from CHO cells (Kuff and Lueders, 1988; Adamson, 1998) . CHO cells also produce C-type particles at concentrations of <10 3 -10 6 ml \u22121 . The presence of virus particles was correlated with detectable reversed transcriptase activity (a retrovirus specific enzyme) (Dinowitz et al., 1992) (Table VII) . As for the IAPs, each CHO cell contains between 100 and 300 copies/genome (Dinowitz et al., 1992) . No evidence of infectivity could be detected (Dinowitz et al., 1992; Adamson, 1998) , this may be due to the lack of functional open reading frames, rendering the retroviruses incapable of encoding an intact endonuclease (Dinowitz et al., 1992) .",

Although any component of the culture medium can theoretically by contaminated by viruses, the materials with the highest probability of viral contamination are those derived from animal origin. The classical animal cell culture technology currently makes use of several raw materials of animal or human origin. This is true for the production of viral vaccines for human or veterinary use or many other biological therapeutic. Animal sera as medium additive is the most widespread animal derived material used today. Fetal, new born or adult bovine sera and in some cases also horse sera are used. Trypsin, mainly from pig pancreas, is a very important detachment agent for all adherent cells. Other animal or human derived substances are often used in association with the replacement of serum by serumfree media, but which can eventually also be found as excipients: human albumin, protein hydrolysates (casein, gelatin, etc.), and human transferrin. Other substances of animal origin are some amino acids, which are derived from complete hydrolysis of proteins. However, because of the chemical conditions used in their production, there is less risk than that of materials prepared without this process. Although the use of entirely chemically defined media devoid of any animal derived substance reduces the risk of viral contaminations, it is important to mention that this risk will never be zero.",

The natural prevalence is very high with approximately 80% of cattle being seropositive and 1-2% of these animals being persistently viremic animals due to immune tolerance which occurs after infection of the fetus (Kniazeff, 1973) . The infection rate has been increased by the uncontrolled use of live vaccines and by heterologous vaccines fortituously contaminated with BVDV virus (Kreeft et al., 1990) . Together with Hog Cholera and Border Disease virus of sheep, BVDV constitutes the pestivirus group. Bolin et al. (1991) have studied the frequency of contamination of fetal calf serum with BVDV and reported that 332 of 1608 raw fetal serum samples (20.6%) derived from the abbatoirs were positive for this virus, 224 of these samples (13.9%) contained antibodies against BVDV and 3.1% of the samples (50/1608) were positive for both, BVDV and antibodies against BVDV (Table XI ). They have also tested commercial fetal calf serum for cell culture and detec-ted BVDV in 47% of the samples (90/190): 88 contained non-cytolytic and only two contained cytolytic BVDV isolates. Two percent of these samples (3/190) were positive for Infectious Bovine Rhinothracheitis virus isolates. Wessman and Levings (1999) have reported similar results, indicating that 32 to 68% of fetal bovine serum samples (pooled one liter lots from two bovine fetuses) were rejected for presence of BVDV or antibodies against BVDV, in the period of 1990-1997.",

The question most relevant to the use of fetal calf serum for animal cell culture and animal cell culture technology is: which cells are/were contaminated by BVDV and are the cells from different species as easily contaminated as bovine cells or is there any species barrier. In this context, Bolin et al. (1994) performed a survey of cell lines from the American Type Culture Collection and observed the following contamination status: Using immunocytochemical procedures and PCR amplification, 13 of 41 ATCC cell lines were tested BVDV positive: these cell lines were derived from cattle, sheep, goat, deer, bison, rabbit, and domestic cat. Attemps to experimentally infect 14 different cell lines from animals, which were not found positive in the survey of the ATCC cell lines, led to the result that all swine cell lines (3/3: MPK, ESK-4, and one other) and most rabbit (3 out of 4: Sf 1 Ep, R9AB, RAB-9) and cat cell lines (3 out of 4: CRFK, AK-D, NCE-F161) became infected with BVDV, whereas hamster (BHK-21), human (IMR-90), dog (MDCK), rabbit (SIRC) and cat (Fc3Tg) cells were refractory to BVDV infections. The results concerning monkey cells (LLC MK2) were variable -no clear answer was obtained. Wessman and Levings (1999) reported that the following cell lines could be infected with BVDV: bovine cells (EBK, MDBK, BoTur, primary and continuous kidney cell lines, lung, trachea, and aortic endothe-lium), sheep choroid plexus and lamb kidney cells, monkey kidney cells (Vero and others), mosquito cells, porcine cells (PK-15 and others, testis, minipig kidney cells), goat cells (kidney and oesophagus), cat cells (lung, CRFK, tongue, feline embryo), rabbit kidney cells (RK-13), and others. Harasawa and Mizusawa (1995) published a study on the pestivirus contamination of cell stocks of the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank. Fifteen out of 20 cell lines (75%) were positive using RT-PCR. Whereas bovine cell lines (HH, MDBK, CPA, CPAE, EBTr, Ch1Es) were contaminated with genotypes I, II, and III, cell lines of dog, cat, and primate origin were contaminated with genotype II of BVDV (HeLa, MOLT-4, U937, WI-38, WiDr, CV-1, Vero, MDCK, CRFK). Roehe and Edwards (1994) assessed the ability of 11 pestiviruses from pig, eight from cattle, and five from sheep to replicate in cells of porcine (PK-15), bovine (BT) and ovine (SCP) origin. The pattern of replication in different cell types varied between different isolates of the same virus species.",

Using PCR, 14/20 European serum batches (70%) contained BPyV DNA sequences . A similar frequency of contamination was observed in North American serum batches (Kappler et al., 1996; Van der Noordaa et al., 1999) . There was no correlation between the PCR results and the presence/absence of antibodies against BPyV, however, could show that all PCR-positive sera contained infectious BPyV. IBR or BHV-1. BPyV can infect calf kidney cells, and monkey kidney cells (Vero, BSC-1, CV-1, RITA) but also human embryonic kidney cell cultures (Waldeck and Sauer, 1977; Wognum et al., 1984) . The virus does not seem to replicate in mouse 3T3 cells, nor in the human embryonic lung cell WI-38 (Waldeck and Sauer, 1977) . The BPy virus is known to lead to cell transformation and tumorigenesis, which is induced by the expression of the large-T antigen .",

            "text": "All adherently growing cells have to be detached for passaging from time to time. To facilitate this the enzyme trypsin is frequently used. As for serum, trypsin is an animal derived product, generally from porcine pancreas. Therefore, similar safety criteria as for serum have to be applied for trypsin. A special concern is Porcine Parvovirus (PPV). Latent parvovirus contamination has been found in many permanent human cell lines. The first contamination was observed by Hallauer and Kronauer (1960) when they observed that some control cultures (non-infected with Yellow Fever virus) yielded a different hemagglutinating agent, unrelated to Yellow Fever virus, when subjected to their isotonic, high pH glycine extraction buffer (= physiological stress). Further studies identified this infectious agent as a member of the parvovirus group. Following this, Hallauer et al. (1971) isolated 38 parvoviruses in 43 permanent human cell lines obtained from 19 laboratories. Some cell lines showed signs of degenerescence when arriving into the laboratory of Hallauer, others appeared completely normal. Three different serotypes of parvovirus could be identified, the origin of them is not really known. However, the recovery of the same serotypes from different laboratories suggests a common source, such as a reagent used in cell cultivation. One of the serotypes had been identified as PPV, indicating that the use of contaminated trypsin lots was the probable source of contamination (Fikrig and Tattersall, 1992) . The definite proof that porcine trypsin was the source for cell culture contaminations by PPV was apported by Croghan et al. (1973) , because they detected the same serotype in commercial trypsin lots.",

The circoviridae are very small viruses (non-enveloped, circular single stranded DNA, diameter of 17 nm) and are very resistant against most of the inactivation methods currently used. This group of viruses was found in Japanese patients suffering from non A to G hepatitis, described as TT virus (Nishizawa et al. 1997) , and also found in chickens, where it is described as Chicken Anemia virus (Yuasa et al., 1979) . This virus seems to be ubiquitous in humans because DNA of the TT virus was identified in plasma of 76% of French blood donors (Biagini et al., 2000) . It is evident that such a virus might be a problem when human derived proteins are used, because this it is very resistant against most inactivation methods. Tischer et al. (1982) described a circovirus in pigs, and it has been reported that the swine cell line PK-15 was chronically contaminated by this type of virus. A serological study showed that 20 out of 22 randomly collected pig sera contained specific antibodies against the virus, whereas no specific antibodies could be detected in sera from rabbits, mice, calves, and man, including the laboratory staff working with this virus (Tischer et al., 1982) . The virus exists as 2 subtypes, type 2 porcine circovirus replicates actively in porcine fetuses (Sanchez et al., 2001) and is associated with abortions, reproductive failure and postweaning multisystemic wasting disease in swine (O'Connor et al., 2001; Ellis et al., 2001) , however, it seems that this virus is very porcine specific .",

In contrast, Nettleton and Rweyemamu (1980) and Hughes (1996) reported on a MVM contamination of BHK-21 cells for veterinary vaccine production, which was detected via persistent cell deaths of these cells. It could be shown that the serum batch was the origin of this contamination. It is evident that rigourous testing of raw materials is necessary because of the following: -In the case of the production of recombinant proteins for human use, virus contaminations can only be eliminated with difficulty from the bulk product. Should a virus present in the bulk product be able to be eliminated during downstream processing, the FDA will generally not accept the final product after purification (Burstyn, 1996) . -The problem associated with live attenuated virus vaccines is that these products cannot be treated for virus inactivation because the active ingredient would be inactivated at the same time. Such products require a more extended quality control testing for the raw materials. For instance, new serum batches should be tested for a more extensive range of bovine viruses and in particular for those viruses, which are of relevance for the final application of the product. For instance, in the case of the contamination of a canine vaccine by bluetongue virus which lead to the death of some bitches (Table X) (Wilbur et al., 1994) , the application of a specific test would have avoided this incidence. -In conclusion, the best solution for reducing the risks of viral contaminations is the use of raw materials which are not of animal or human origin, but of plant or microbial origin or produced by chemical synthesis. It is evident that such an approach will not eliminate the risk of viral contaminations, but represents an important step towards risk minimization.",

If a raw material is of animal origin, screening tests should also include the use of cells of the species of origin.

However, such filters only partly reduce the quantity of poliovirus (28-30 nm), and viruses of a size of 25 nm (model particle: Bacteriophage PP7) pass without any significant retention (log titer reduction: <1-8.5, depending on the buffer system used) (Graf et al., 1999) .

As animal derived substances such as serum can be contaminated by adventitious viruses, \u03b3 irradition is, after routine quality control for virus detection, the best method to increase the safety of using serum in the production of animal cell culture derived biologicals. Using PETG (polyethylene terephthalate G copolymer) bottles with 500 ml of frozen serum (-40 \u2022 C) inoculated with model virus (Hanson and Foster, 1997) , validation experiments have been performed to determine the optimal radiation dose to inactivate relevant bovine and porcine viruses, and in parallel to assure that the irradiated serum has still a sufficient growth supporting ability. Plavsic et al. (1999) could show that at a radiation dose of 25 kGy, all tested viruses (Bovine Reovirus, Porcine Parvovirus, Canine Adenovirus, IBR, and BVDV) showed a significant decline in titer. An exposure of 35 kGy led to titers of all viruses tested falling below the detection level (\u22640.5 TCID 50 ml \u22121 ). Even very resistant viruses, such as the Porcine Parvovirus, could be reduced to below the detection level. For all viruses tested the log reduction factor was at least 6.78 (Table XIV) . Willkommen et al. (1999) reported an overview on virus inactivation and removal from serum and serum substitutes. With respect to the efficiency of PPV inactivation by \u03b3 irradition they indicated that even after application of a radiation dose of 40 kGy, a TCID 50 of 5.3 per ml was observed, indicating that the log reduction was only about 2. This difference with data published by Plavsic et al. (1999) might be due to differences in the design of the respective studies. However, with respect to the other viruses tested (BVDV, IBR, PI-3, reovirus 3), no differences in the inactivation doses were observed. It should be mentioned here, that sera are normally irradiated using a dose of 20 to 25 kGy. For veterinary use, the radiation dose has to be 35 kGy.",

Whereas low passage BHK cells, Vero (only slightly), and CHO cells displayed an inverse relationship between growth and radiation dose, high passage BHK cells and the human diploid fibroblasts, WI-38 and MRC-5 -the latter are of special interest for vaccine production and virology -did not display growth decline as a function of radiation dose (Table XV ).

The RTase assay is a general test which will detect the presence of all viruses which contain reverse transcriptase enzyme. The last general test which is normally applied is the, in vivo tests where animals are used to identify the presence of virus. The animals are treated using different inoculation routes (the health of these animals should be monitored and any abnormality should be investigated to establish the cause of the illness). Finally, electron microscopic examination is also a general test which can be used for detecting adventitious viruses in the case of rather high virus loads. More details can be found in the articles by Poiley (1990) , by Werz et al. (1997) , and in the ICH Topic Q5A (1997).",

            "text": "The use of modern biotechnology for the production of biopharmaceuticals allows the treatment of diseases, which could not be treated previously. However, virus infection and replication is an inherent risk during cultivation of mammalian cells. Raw material testing, rigorous characterization of the master and the working cell bank as well as testing of the final bulk product (before downstream processing and virus inactivation steps have been performed) lead to a considerable increase in the viral safety. Although viral contamination might happen during production only preventive measures can be taken in fermentation and product biosynthesis. Thus the downstream processing is an integral part of the manufacturing process and has to be validated in order to assess its potential to eliminate, clear, or inactivate viruses. The downstream processing has two, sometimes contradictory aims: (i) purify the product to the required purity at high recovery using the lowest number of steps possible, and (ii) eventually increase the number of purification steps in order to assure the elimination of potential viral contaminants. The general difficulty resides in the physico-chemical properties of the product. The properties that maintain the beneficial effects of a product are often very similar to those carried by all viruses, in particular when the bioproduct is a live virus (for vaccination or for gene therapy purposes). Therefore only a limited spectrum of techniques can be used for virus inactivation/elimination. To assess the capability of individual process steps to remove viruses these steps have to be tested with live model viruses for which clearing factors can then be calculated. These, so called, viral clearance studies have the objective to demonstrate the capacity of different steps of the purification process to eliminate or inactivate adventitious agents acquired during the production process (contaminated cells, raw materials, process failure, etc.). They are performed via spiking experiments. As viruses vary greatly in properties such as size, resistance to inactivation, type of envelope, type and structure of their genome, the model viruses used for these spiking experiments have to be selected in order to cover the whole spectrum of potentially present viruses. However, in order to assure absence of viral contaminations derived from the producer cell line in the product, the downstream protocol has also to be validated for its capacity to inactivate or eliminte these specific viruses (e.g. retroviruses derived from hybridoma and CHO cells, or EBV derived from human lymphoblastoid cell lines). In general, it is difficult to show more than a five log removal on any given step due to the titers of the model virus used.

In addition, there is no need for such exhaustive testing unless the materials are to be used in the treatment of human patients. However, most of the issues described in the chapters on 'Problems associated with viral contaminations' and on 'Origin of viral contaminations' are valid for everyone working in the field of animal cell culture. The use of validated cell lines, shown to be 'virus-free', is the best choice because cell collections, such as the ATCC (www.atcc.org), perform entrance tests for new cell lines for assuring the absence of mycoplasma, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and cytopathic viruses and can guarantee a certain microbial quality for the delivered cell lines. The German Cell Line Bank (www.dsmz.de) provides cells, most of them have been tested for the absence of HIV-I, HTLV-I and II, EBV, HBV, HCV, and HHV-8 by using PCR or RT-PCR. The absence of retroviruses is proven by performing a reverse transcriptase assay.",

Fortunately due to rigorous testing of the animals used as the source of explants, the production of ascites or the passage of cells, of raw materials, of the cell strains and cell lines in use, and finally of bulk and the final product can prevent potentially dangerous viral contaminations. Existing data demonstrate that contamination of cells and harvests by viruses can occur for products of biotechnology, and while the frequency may be low it is not zero. For instance, routine testing of cell lines of biotech interest revealed a contamination frequency with adventitious viruses of less than 1% (Moore, 1992) . However, the possibility of new emerging viruses and the permanently existing risk of contaminations by adventitious agents and viruses leads to the conclusion that the user of animal cells as well as the producer of biotech products by using animal cells have to be attentive to this possible threat and that they have to assure the absence of adventitious agents/viruses by any mean. Only then, animal cell technology biotech products can be used for the benefit of everyone.",
