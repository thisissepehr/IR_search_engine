Overactivity of RAAS promotes both systemic and regional glomerular capillary hypertension, which could induce hemodynamic injury to the glomerulus, leading to kidney damage and renal fibrosis via profibrotic and proinflammatory pathway. Therefore, the use of RAAS inhibitors (i.e., ACEIs, ARBs, and MRAs) as the optional therapy has been demonstrated to prevent proteinuria, and kidney fibrosis and slow the decline of renal function effectively in the process of kidney disease during the last few decades. Recently, several new components of the RAAS have been discovered, including ACE2 and the corresponding ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas axis, which are also present in the kidney. Besides the classic RAAS inhibitors target the angiotensin-AT1-aldosterone axis, with the expanding knowledge about RAAS, a number of potential therapeutic targets in this system is emerging. Newer agents that are more specific are being developed. The present chapter outlines the insights of the RAAS agents (classic RAAS antagonists/the new RAAS drugs), and discusses its clinical application in the combat of renal fibrosis.",

AngII is considered the most important RAAS peptide and is associated with vasoconstriction and high blood pressure. AngII binds to the type-1 AngII receptor (AT1) in a variety of tissues. Then, aldosterone is stimulated via the AT1 receptor in the adrenal gland, facilitating sodium retention by the kidney when aldosterone binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor. More recently, several new components of the RAAS have been discovered, including ACE2 and the corresponding ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas axis, which are also present in the kidney.",

Mechanically, aliskiren prevents renal disease progression by suppressing both angiotensin I and II in RAAS-activated pathology; moreover, Renke revealed that aliskiren also attenuated oxidative stress and improved the functional status of tubules in nondiabetic nephropathy (Renke et al. 2014) . Collectedly, these results strongly suggest that aliskiren has beneficial effects for renoprotection with or without BP-lowering effects in CKD patients.

Because of the urinary potassium excretion caused by aldosterone, RAAS blockers can cause potassium retention.

Tubulo-interstitial fibrosis and levels of profibrotic and oxidative markers were found to be reduced with aliskiren. The AVOID trial showed that aliskiren might have additional renoprotective effects that are independent of its blood pressure-lowering effects in patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes and nephropathy when added to ARB. Unfortunately, another clinical trial, the ALTI-TUDE trial, due to a lack of apparent benefit and a higher risk of side effects, was prematurely stopped for futility in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, macro-albuminuria, or cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the FDA has given a formal recommendation about aliskiren: it should not be used in association with ARBs or ACEIs as dual therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal disease (Parving et al., 2012) .",

In the kidney, AT2R is mainly localized to renal vessels, glomeruli, and tubules. AT2R activation also opposes the vasoconstrictor actions of AT1R by promoting dilation of the afferent and efferent arterioles. A previous study revealed that the appropriate balance between AT1R and AT2R activation might therefore play a key role in regulating the physiological functions of the renal systems (Ozono et al. 1997) . Mechanistically, the following phenomena might contribute to the renoprotection of AT2R. First, AT2R stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) and inhibits ERK activity, resulting in the reduction in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and growth inhibition. Second, AT2R regulates the production of renal nitric oxide (NO), guanosine cyclic 3 ,5 -monophosphate (cGMP), and bradykinin Abadir et al. 2003; Matavelli and Siragy 2015) , indicating that it could be involved in the induction of vasodilation. In addition, Rompe et al. (2010) showed that targeting AT2R exerted a direct anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation, leading to reduced TNF-\u03b1-mediated IL-6 release from fibroblasts. Together, these data demonstrate that AT2R plays a substantial role in organ inflammation and tissue fibrosis and that its cellular signaling pathways go in opposite directions to those of AT1R.",

Because the structure of renin is highly species specific, vaccination against heterologous renins led to the production of antibodies that produced only incomplete suppression of renin's enzymatic activity. Subsequent advances in human renin purification made it possible to actively immunize marmosets against human renin. Unfortunately, these experiments also revealed that the renin vaccine led to the onset of various autoimmune diseases that emerged as a major concern for any immunotherapy directed at endogenous RAAS components (Gradman and Pinto 2008) .",

It is well documented that smaller molecules will be less likely to stimulate autoimmune diseases. In animal models, AngI vaccines between two carriers, tetanus toxoid (TT) (PMD-2850) and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) (PMD3117), induced equivalent immune responses and inhibition of the pressor effects of exogenous AngI. In a phase IIa clinical trial, three or four injections of the angiotensin I vaccine PMD3117 resulted in antibody production with titers peaking 64 days after protocol initiation and no evidence of autoimmune disease. The results revealed that PMD3117 could block the RAAS system. Therefore, a new formulation of PMD3117 has been developed. Confirmation of safety is the priority, and renoprotection should be addressed by further clinical assessment in phase IIb and phase III trials (Gardiner et al. 2000; Downham et al. 2003; Do et al. 2010) .",

In 2007, Cytos Biotechnology developed an AngII-specific vaccine (CYT006-AngQb) composed of an AngII peptide with an N-terminal Cys-Gly-Gly extension that is covalently coupled to virus-like particles (VLP) derived from the coat protein of the bacteriophage Qb. Amb\u00fchl PM showed that VLP (AngQb) reduces blood pressure in SHR to levels obtained with an ACE inhibitor and is well tolerated in humans. Therefore, vaccination against angiotensin II has the potential to become a useful antihypertensive treatment that provides long-lasting effects and improves patient compliance (Ambuhl et al. 2007) . Some studies reported that SHR exhibited an SBP decrease of 17 mmHg after immunization with a peptide-based vaccine made of a seven-amino acid sequence (AFHYESR) from the second extracellular loop of rat AT-1A receptor (ATR12181), which alleviated cardiac hypertrophy and attenuation of kidney injuries. There were no signs of autoimmune diseases in the biopsied sections of kidney. Because Freund's adjuvant is not safe for use in humans, the next phase of the study will focus on the use of ATR12181 in combination with VLP in human subjects (Zhu et al. 2006) .",

The synthesis of inactive Ang 1-9 from AngI and the catabolism of AngII to produce Ang 1-7 are the main functions of ACE2 (Nishiyama et al. 2002; Tikellis et al. 2004 ). There may be two mechanisms to explain the beneficial effect of ACE2 in vascular diseases. First, ACE2 reduced the AngII interaction with AT1R by inducing AngII degradation; second, ACE2 reduced vasoconstric-tion, water retention, and reactive oxygen stress by increasing Ang1-7 synthesis (Clarke and Turner 2012) . Zhong et al. found that daily treatment with recombinant human ACE2 (hrACE2) reduced the AngII-induced pressor response and normalized renal AngII levels and oxidative stress, which indicated that human ACE2 prevented AngII-mediated renal oxidative stress, inflammation, and tubulo-interstitial fibrosis in animal models (Zhong et al. 2011 ). Oudit GY found that treatment with hrACE2 attenuated diabetic kidney injury in the Akita mouse in association with a reduction in blood pressure and a decrease in NADPH oxidase activity (Oudit et al. 2010 ). Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that the ACE/ACE2 ratio regulates the production and accumulation of AngII and that ACE2 deficiency leads to increased AngII concentrations (Ye et al. 2004; Wakahara et al. 2007 ).",

AT4R has a broad distribution and is found in a range of tissues, including the adrenal gland, kidney, lung, and heart. AT4R was generally found to be more abundant than AT1R in mammalian kidneys, whereas the Ang1-7 receptor was not detected in mammalian kidneys. Rats subjected to various chronic treatments were found to preferentially present decreased kidney AT4R density (furosemide, puromycin aminonucleoside, and nitro-L-arginine methylester), decreased kidney AT1R density (bilateral ureteral obstruction), or increased kidney AT1R distribution in the inner medulla (water diuresis). These results suggest that AT4R can be expressed in several renal cells within the normal kidney. Furthermore, many animal models of renal dysfunction and injury have been identified that selectively alter kidney AT4R density and may potentially aid in elucidating the role of this novel angiotensin receptor system in renal function (Handa et al. 2001) .",

After 4 months of ischemia-reperfusion, finerenone fully prevented the transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease (kidney dysfunction, increased proteinuria and tubular dilation, extensive tubule-interstitial fibrosis, and an increase in kidney TGF-\u03b2 and collagen I mRNA). Moreover, Barrera-Chimal J's lab (Barrera-Chimal et al. 2018 ) also reported that finerenone efficiently prevented IR-induced increases in plasma creatinine, urea, and proteinuria levels, as well as the expression of TGF-\u03b2 as an indicator of kidney fibrosis, which means that finerenone protected against the transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease. Furthermore, they found that MR deficiency in myeloid cells protected against chronic dysfunction and fibrosis induced by ischemia-reperfusion.

However, the combination use of ACEI and ARB may have synergistic or addictive effects. A meta-analysis found that a combination of ACEI and ARB resulted in a clinically significant reduction in proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease and diabetic nephropathy regardless of BP changes (Doulton and Macgregor 2005) . Another systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the combination of an ACEI and an ARB in patients with chronic proteinuric renal disease. This finding indicated that the combination of ACEI and ARB therapy in patients with chronic proteinuric renal disease was safe, without clinically meaningful changes in serum potassium levels or glomerular filtration rates. Combination therapy was also associated with a significant decrease in proteinuria, at least in the short term (MacKinnon et al. 2006 ). However, Schmerbach et al. (2012) observed the effect of ACEI/ARB combination therapy in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats on a salt-rich diet. Renal glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis were decreased by monotherapy (telmisartan or ramipril), whereas combination treatment (telmisartan and ramipril) failed to have a significant effect. In the ONTARGET trial, the combination therapy of ramipril plus telmisartan was compared to monotherapy in patients with DM and high cardiovascular risk. There was no difference in the composite primary outcome of death or hospitalization for cardiovascular disease, but combination therapy was associated with significantly more hypotension, syncopes, and a faster rate of decline in renal function compared to monotherapy. The ONTARGET trial also showed that dual RAAS blockade led to worsening of kidney function (Mann et al. 2008) . As with ONTARGET, the VA NEPHRON D Trial, targeting patients with T2DM, compared combination therapy of losartan and lisinopril to monotherapy with losartan. Due to excess adverse events in the combination arm of ACEI and ARB, mostly acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia, the trial was prematurely stopped (Fried et al. 2013 ).",

Eplerenone is also effective in resistant hypertension in association with ACEI or ARB. The demonstrated better tolerability of eplerenone over spironolactone could make the use of eplerenone more desirable, but the indication for hypertension is not recognized except in the presence of intolerance to spironolactone (Marquez et al. 2015) . Mehdi et al. (2009) published a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that included 81 patients with diabetes, hypertension, and albuminuria (UAE > 300 mg/g). Patients who were treated with lisinopril 80 mg were randomized to placebo, losartan 100 mg or spironolactone 25 mg daily for 48 weeks. The results revealed that compared with placebo, the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio decreased by 34.0% in the spironolactone group and by 16.8% in the losartan group. However, the serum potassium level was significantly higher with the addition of either spironolactone or losartan, which indicated that the addition of spironolactone, but not losartan, to a regimen including a maximal dose of an ACEI generated better renoprotection in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Epstein et al. published similar RCT results in 2006 (Epstein et al. 2006 .

            "text": "For years, a large number of experimental and clinical trials have shown that the traditional RAAS blocker (ACEI/ARB/MAR) could delay the development of renal fibrosis and chronic kidney disease, but the effect was limited. Improvements in RAAS blockade beyond the effects of ACEIs and ARBs will be challenging, but studies in this area are abundant. Some new nonpeptide drugs that modify RAAS activity to combat renal fibrosis have been developed, including several novel agonists (such as AT2R agonists and MAS1 agonists) and antagonists (such as AT4R inhibitors) of the RAAS, some of which have entered clinical applications and some of which are still in the stage of clinical trials. Furthermore, with the development of new technology, new blockers of the RAAS have been developed, such as human recombinant ACE2 and vaccines against renin, AngI or AngII, which may be more specific. However, large multicenter randomized controlled studies are needed to evaluate the beneficial effects and to explore the efficacy and safety of these new blockers of the RAAS.",
