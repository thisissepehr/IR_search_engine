            "text": "Background: Pneumonia is the leading risk factor of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is increasing studies in patients with pneumonia to reveal that coinfection with viral and bacterial infection can lead to poorer outcomes than no coinfection. This study evaluated the role of coinfection identified through bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) examination on the outcomes of pneumonia-related ARDS. Methods: We performed a prospective observational study at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from October 2012 to May 2015. Adult patients were included if they met the Berlin definition of ARDS. The indications for BAL were clinically suspected pneumonia-related ARDS and no definite microbial sample identified from tracheal aspirate or sputum. The presence of microbial pathogens and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Results: Of the 19,936 patients screened, 902 (4.5%) fulfilled the Berlin definition of ARDS. Of these patients, 255 (22.7%) had pneumonia-related ARDS and were included for analysis. A total of 142 (55.7%) patients were identified to have a microbial pathogen through BAL and were classified into three groups: a virus-only group (n \u00bc 41 [28.9%]), no virus group (n \u00bc 60 [42.2%]), and coinfection group (n \u00bc 41 [28.9%]). ARDS severity did not differ significantly between the groups (P \u00bc 0.43). The hospital mortality rates were 53.7% in virus-only identified group, 63.3% in no virus identified group, and 80.5% in coinfection identified group. The coinfection group had significantly higher mortality than virus-only group (80.5% vs. 53.7%; P \u00bc 0.01). Conclusion: In patients with pneumonia-related ARDS, the BAL pathogen-positive patients had a trend of higher mortality rate than pathogen-negative patients. Coinfection with a virus and another pathogen was associated with increased hospital mortality in pneumonia-related ARDS patients.",

Pneumonia was suspected clinically if the following two or more criteria were fulfilled: new airspace opacity on a chest radiograph; body temperature >38.38C or <36.08C, white blood count >12,000/mm 3 or <4,000/mm 3 , or >10% bandemia; and a positive microbial culture. The site for BAL sampling was selected on the basis of the most recent chest X-ray or high-resolution computer tomography of the chest (if available). BAL was performed using a fibrobronchoscope by introducing 200 mL of a sterile, warm saline solution into a bronchial subsegment and aspirating it back in four 50-mL aliquots. The BAL samples were analyzed in the hospital's microbiology and pathology laboratories for the presence of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in accordance with normal practice. The bacteria analyzed included aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, legionella, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and mycobacteria. Urinary antigen testing was performed for the detection of S pneumoniae and L pneumophila (BinaxNOW, Alere, Scarborough, USA). The fungal analysis involved candida culture, an aspergillosis antigen and culture, and P jirovecii testing. The BAL samples were subjected to Giemsa and Gomori methenamine silver staining and qualitative pneumocystis DNA analysis by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for P jirovecii. Viral identification from BAL samples was performed using PCR and viral culture: reverse-transcription PCR for influenza viruses A and B, shell vial culture for cytomegalovirus (CMV), and viral culture for herpes simplex virus (HSV), parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and enterovirus. BAL culture results were deemed positive when at minimum one microorganism grew to a concentration of >10 4 colony-forming units per milliliter. We collected the samples of all the ARDS patients who had received BAL for microbial examination during the study period for analysis.",

Community-acquired pneumonia is the most frequent cause of ARDS and no specific bacterium has been identified to be solely responsible for pneumonia-induced ARDS (8) . Although fungi are not the common cause of ARDS, some fungal pathogens such as P jirovecii and Aspergillus fumigatus may be responsible for ARDS in immunocompromised patients (21) . In this study, the most common pathogen identified through BAL was P jirovecii (47.2%) and not a bacterium. This may be due to the patient-selection criteria and the methodological procedures used in this study. First, the indication for BAL in these pneumonia-related ARDS patients was a negative tracheal aspirate or sputum culture. Because the most common bacterial pathogens, such as S pneumonia and Haemophilus influenza, might be more readily identified from the tracheal aspirate or sputum culture of ARDS patients, they would have been excluded from this study according to the selection criteria. Second, P jirovecii was detected through BAL by using either PCR or conventional staining in this study. Studies have reported that PCR detection of P jirovecii DNA provides greater sensitivity for diagnosis compared with conventional staining (a sensitivity value of 98.3% [95% confidence interval: 91.3%\u00c099.7%]) (22, 23) . P jirovecii detection through BAL in ARDS patients has clinical implications and is worth further investigation; early identification and proper therapy can alter the patient outcome.",

The fraction of ICU mortality attributable to CMV reactivation was 23% by day 30, which translates into an absolute increasing mortality of 4.4%. The CMV reactivation rate was 27% in these 271 ARDS patients. In the present study, CMV was the most common virus detected through BAL and was identified in 51 (35.9%) patients. The exact implication of CMV detection in the lower respiratory tract is still debated. In future studies, evaluating the efficacy of therapy directed against CMV in ARDS patients is crucial. This study has some limitations. First, the study was performed at a single tertiary referral center, which may limit the generalization of the results. It is critical to recognize the variability of pathogenic pneumonia species among different ICUs within a hospital, different hospitals, and different areas and countries. Such local epidemiologic information helps us understand and select the appropriate antimicrobial treatment for the specific clinical setting. Second, our study included patients with pneumonia-related ARDS who had negative results on tracheal aspirate or sputum culture and then received BAL for pathogen surveys. Thus, we did not study patients who had positive sputum culture results. Although quantitative BAL has a higher diagnostic yield in pathogen identification, it entails potential risks and ethical concerns in severe hypoxemic patients. In practice, it is not possible to perform BAL in all patients with pneumonia-related ARDS. Third, all of the patients had received empiric antimicrobial agents before BAL; some patients might have had false-negative results regarding bacterial culture, and consequently, the percentage of patients infected by other pathogens might have been overestimated. Fourth, the sensitivity and specificity of the available diagnostic methods used in this study are concerning. Although we performed quantitative BAL to increase the diagnostic yield in pathogen identification, it is possible to have false-negative results; for example, we did not uniformly use multiplex RT-PCR and serology study to detect respiratory viruses and some bacteria. Finally, the moderately small sample size may have influenced the statistical analysis and cannot represent the entire pneumonia-related ARDS population. Despite the limited number of study patients, this is one of the largest studies with BAL sampling of pneumonia-related ARDS patients thus far reported.",
