A weak binding between serum albumin and Gd-BOPTA/Dimeg has been identified (4) as the cause of the elevated relaxivity and the binding affinity has been estimated to be 15 mM in aqueous solutions of serum albumin based on the change in r l (3). This increase in relaxivity may be used to advantage in imaging tissue with a high blood content or pathologic lesions (i.e., tumors or infarcted tissue) which contain large quantities of interstitial albumin since these zones may exhibit increased enhancement after Gd-BOPTA/Dimeg administration versus that from other available contrast media. Some of the main characteristics of reperfused infarcted myocardium are an expanded extracellular volume compared with normal myocardium, increased interstitial serum albumin content, increased interstitial fluid pressure, and the presence of cells with damaged membranes. The major pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the increase in interstitial fluid pressure are the accumulation of plasma proteins and impaired function of the lymphatic system. Accordingly, the following study was conducted to quantify changes in R1 of blood, normal myocardium and reperfused infarcted myocardium after administration Gd-BOPTAIDimeg and to compare with results obtained after administering the same doses of Gd-DTPA.

It was also important to avoid error from T, decreases that accompany contrast media and confound TI calculation from signal intensity change in individual images. Consequently, the compromise solution used in the current study was to estimate the inversion recovery null point, which is insensitive to T, error and greatly reduces the temporal error caused by the effects of clearance on the inversion recovery profile. Temporal misregistration for zones with different T, values is still present because null intensity was not observed at the same time for each region. This error was not large because observation of null intensity for the region with smallest T , (reperfused infarction) was always within 60 s of that for the region with greatest T, (usually normal myocardium).

The expected AR1 ratio would be 0.5 to 0.7 rather than 0.4 if the ratio of local relaxivities, rlmyo/rlblood, is unity. The true cause of this discrepancy is unknown, but possible explanations might be that (a) values obtained from sacrificed animals, as in radioisotope experiments, may be higher than in living animals since the myocardial blood volume can increase appreciably depending upon the manner of sacrifice; and (b) the AR1 method may give an erroneously low value because r l myo is limited by water exchange between intracellular and extracellular spaces. While it is true that departure from monoexponential relaxation is not usually apparent after quite high doses of Gd-DTPA, the local r l would be reduced appreciably before compartmentalization is evident as biexponential relaxation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "3.0-"}, {"text": "In reperfused infarction the AR1 ratio value was constant with time after administration of Gd-DTPA and was independent of dose, therefore it is likely that kin, kout >> kc. If the r l ratio is unity, then the apparent fECV is 0.6 x 1.63 0.98, indicating that virtually all of the myocardial cellular volume in the injury zone is within the distribution volume of the contrast agent, probably indicating lethal cell membrane damage. This finding is important because it suggests a method for quantifying the necrotic cell fraction within the infarcted territory which may be less than 100% (12) in less severe injury.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 590, "end": 594, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "3.0-"}, {"text": "The results obtained with Gd-BOPTA/Dimeg are more difficult to rationalize. It was true that generally greater AR1 values were noted in the blood pool after administering Gd-BOPTA/Dimeg as compared with Gd-DTPA (2.46 2 0.4 versus 1.88 ? 0.2), in accord with the known effect of serum albumin on r l in blood, but increases were also noted in AR1 values of myocardium (0.96 2 0.2 versus 0.72 c 0.1). Thus, a significant difference between AR1 ratio values was not obtained. However, one would expect that AR1 of myocardium would be dominated by Gd-BOPTA/Dimeg in the interstitium rather than by that in the myocardial blood because (a) the interstitial volume is larger than the blood volume and (b) limited transcapillary exchange of water would reduce the access of most of the tissue water, that in the cellular spaces, to the intravascular compartment. Since there is very little albumin present in interstitium of normal myocardium, rlblood is expected to be greater than r l myocardium which in turn should cause lower ARlmyo/ARlblood values than obtained with Gd-DTPA. Why was this expected lowering of the AR1 ratio only found at a dose of 0.2 mmol/kg and not at the lower doses? We can only speculate that transcapillary exchange of water is sufficiently fast that at the lower doses the higher relaxation rate in the tissue blood penetrates into the extravascular Compartment. This is not a very satisfactory explanation because when the agent was cleared from the blood after the higher dose, the AR1 ratio did not increase toward the value observed at the lower doses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "3.0-"}, {"text": "In reperfused infarcted myocardium, the AR1 ratio exhibited an initial rise to a constant high value suggesting an approach to equilibrium phase distribution. The AR1 value in the constant portion was much higher than noted for Gd-DTPA. If we assume that equilibrium dis-tribution exists in this portion of the curve, then the fECV-r1 ratio product (i.e., right hand side of Eq. 151) is approximately 2.7 x 0.6 = 1.62. Obviously, the fECV cannot be greater than 1.0 forcing the rlmyo/rlblood ratio to at least a value of 1.6. This value for r1 ratio cannot be explained solely on the basis of serum albumin accumulation in the reperfused infarcted tissue. Albumin concentration in the extravascular compartment cannot be higher than in plasma since plasma is its only source. Thus, the ratio of relaxivities of Gd-BOPTA/ Dimeg in tissue to that in blood should not exceed unity unless there is a change in bound-site relaxation rate (meaning relaxation rate of water ligated to gadolinium) or a change in fraction of Gd-BOPTA/Dimeg that is bound to protein. Since myocardial intracellular proteins are available for interaction with Gd-BOPTA in the damaged territory, it seems most sensible to ascribe the apparent elevation of Gd-BOPTAIDimeg relaxivity in the tissue to an increased fraction of bound Gd-BOPTA/ Dimeg in this region.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "3.0-"}, {"text": "The important findings of this study were that (a) when administered at similar dose levels, Gd-BOPTA/Dimeg causes greater increases in R 1 than provided by Gd-DTPA consistent with its known larger r l relaxivity of the former agent in solutions containing serum albumin. This effect is particularly important in reperfused infarcted myocardium where plasma proteins are known to accumulate and greater potential contrast between reperfused infarction and normal myocardium would be available for ?\",-weighted imaging; (b) AR1 values were greatest in reperfused infarcted myocardium, less in chamber blood, and least in normal myocardium throughout the observation, and the agent was cleared efficiently from all myocardial regions indicating that the contrast agent is not sequestered in reperfused myocardial infarction for this preparation; (c) the ratio of AR1 values in tissue to that in blood were consistent with a Gd-DTPA distribution volume containing 24% of myocardial water (including myocardial blood volume) in normal or uninjured myocardium and nearly 100% in hearts subjected to reperfused infarction.

Notice that animals that received Gd-BOPTNDimeg exhibit significantly larger values for this ratio than animals that received Gd-DTPA, indicating that Gd-BOPTNDimeg would provide greater contrast between normal and reperfused infarcted regions on T,-weighted MRI.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "Clearance Half-Time Values (min) for Gd-DTPA and Gd-BOPTNDimeg", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>na </td><td>LV blood </td><td>Normal myocardium </td><td>Reperfused infarcted mvocardium </td></tr><tr><td>Gd-DTPA 0.05 mmol/kg </td><td>5 </td><td>1 8 + 3 </td><td>1 6 2 3 </td><td>21 ?
