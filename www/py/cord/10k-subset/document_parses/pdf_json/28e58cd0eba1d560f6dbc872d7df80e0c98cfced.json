These are highly polymorphic peptide receptors selecting and presenting endogenously derived epitopes to circulating CTLs. The polymorphism of the MHC effectively individualizes the immune response of each member of the species. We have recently developed efficient methods to generate recombinant human MHC-I (also known as human leukocyte antigen class I, HLA-I) molecules, accompanying peptide-binding assays and predictors, and HLA tetramers for specific CTL staining and manipulation. This has enabled a complete mapping of all HLA-I specificities (\"the Human MHC Project\"). Here, we demonstrate that these approaches can be applied to other species. We systematically transferred domains of the frequently expressed swine MHC-I molecule, SLA-1*0401, onto a HLA-I molecule (HLA-A*11:01), thereby generating recombinant human/swine chimeric MHC-I molecules as well as the intact SLA-1*0401 molecule. Biochemical peptide-binding assays and positional scanning combinatorial peptide libraries were used to analyze the peptidebinding motifs of these molecules. A pan-specific predictor of peptide-MHC-I binding, NetMHCpan, which was originally developed to cover the binding specificities of all known HLA-I molecules, was successfully used to predict the specificities of the SLA-1*0401 molecule as well as the porcine/human chimeric MHC-I molecules.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "These data indicate that it is possible to extend the biochemical and bioinformatics tools of the Human MHC Project to other vertebrate species.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules are found in all vertebrate animals where they play a crucial role in generating specific cellular immune responses against viruses and other intracellular pathogens.

In humans, more than 3,400 different human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules have been registered (as of January 2011), and this number is currently growing rapidly as more efficient HLA typing techniques are employed worldwide. The polymorphism of the MHC-I molecule is concentrated in and around the peptide-binding groove, where it determines the peptide-binding specificity. Due to this polymorphism, it is highly unlikely that any two individuals will share the same set of HLA-I molecules thereby presenting the same peptides and generating T cell responses of the same specificities-something, that otherwise would give microorganisms a strong evolutionary chance of escape. Rather, this polymorphism can be seen as diversifying peptide presentation thereby individualizing T cell responses and reducing the risk that escape variants of microorganisms might evolve.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In 1999, we proposed that all human MHC specificities should be mapped (\"the Human MHC Project\") as a preamble for the application of MHC information and technologies in humans (Buus 1999) .

The fusion proteins were extracted into 8 M urea (without any reducing agents), purified by ion exchange, hydrophobic and gel filtration chromatography (all conducted in 8 M urea, without any reducing agents) (Fig. 3 shows SDS-PAGE of the purified SLA-1*0401 after gel filtration), concentrated, and stored in urea at \u221220\u00b0C.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 215, "end": 239, "text": "(Ostergaard et al. 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 240, "end": 258, "text": "Ferre et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1121, "end": 1128, "text": "(Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1425, "end": 1432, "text": "(Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Generation of chimeric MHC class I molecules"}, {"text": "Testing a chimeric molecule consisting of a SLA-1*0401 stalk and a HLA-A*11:01 peptide-binding platform-comparing human versus porcine \u03b2 2 m To test the proximal immunoglobulin-like membrane attaching SLA stalk, we generated recombinant porcine \u03b2 2 m and a chimeric human/porcine MHC-I heavy chain molecule where the \u03b1 1 \u03b1 2 were derived from the human HLA-A*11:01, and the \u03b1 3 was derived from the porcine SLA-1*0401.

We applied NetMHCpan to our peptide repository of about 10,000 peptides, which over the past decade have been selected to scan infectious agents (e.g., SARS and influenza, Sylvester-Hvid et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2010) , improve coverage of MHC-I specificities (e.g., Buus et al. 2003; Christensen et al. 2003) , etc. We extracted 29 peptides as predicted binders to either the SLA-1*0401, the HPP, or the PHP human/porcine chimeric class I molecules (some of the peptides were predicted to bind to two or even all three of these molecules).

Figure 7 shows a specificity tree clustering of the SLA-1*0401 molecule compared to prevalent representatives of the 12 common HLA supertypes that NetMHCpan originally intended to cover . By this token, SLA-1*0401 most closely resembles that of HLA-A*01:01. The limited PSCPL analysis of the chimeric MHC-I molecules revealed strong P9 signals with specificities that seemed to be determined by the origin of the \u03b1 1 domain: the HPP chimera showed an HLA-A*11:01-like P9 specificity, whereas the PHP chimera showed a SLA-1*0401/HLA-A*01:01-like specificity. Since the NetMHCpan predictor successfully captured these chimeric specificities (see above), we reasoned that the predictor might also be used to perform in silico dissection of these specificities and used the P9 specificity as an example of such an in silico analysis. The NetMHCpan predictor considers a pseudo-sequence consisting of 34 polymorphic positions, which contain residues that are within 4.0 \u00c5 of the atoms of bound nonamer peptides (Nielsen et al. 2007 ). Of the 34 positions of the pseudosequence, 10 delineates the P9 binding pocket; however, only 3 of these, positions 74, 77, and 97, differ between SLA-1*0401 and HLA-A*11:01. To explore the effect of these three residues, we performed in silico experiments where we examined single substitutions Y74D, G77D, and S97I (the letter before the position number indicates the SLA-A*0401 single letter residue, whereas the letter after indicates the HLA-A*11:01 residue) as well as the corresponding triple substitution (YGS-DDI). As described above, PSSMs were generated for each of the in silico molecules followed by a specificity tree clustering (including SLA-A*0401, HLA-A*01:01, and HLA-A*11:01). Figure 8 shows this tree along with the sequence logo plots showing the predicted binding specificity of each in silico MHC-I molecule. Albeit the Y74D and G77D single substitutions showing some of the positively charged P9 peptide residue preference of HLA-A*11:01, they still clustered with HLA-A*01:01. In contrast, the in silico (YGS-DDI) triple substitution clustered with the HLA-A*11:01. This suggests that the NetMHCpan method is capable of defining the residues of the F pocket that determine the specificity of position 9.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 135, "end": 156, "text": "Nielsen et al.

However, due to the extreme polymorphism of the MHCs, any attempt to address the specificity of the entire MHC system is a significant experimental undertaking. During the past decade, we have established a series of technologies to support a general solution of human MHC class I and II specificities. For MHC-I, this includes (1) a highly efficient E. coli expression system for production of recombinant human and mouse MHC-I molecules (both heavy chain and light chain (\u03b2 2 m) molecules) Ostergaard et al. 2001) , (2) a purification system for obtaining the highly active pre-oxidized MHC-I heavy chain species (Ferre et al. 2003) , (3) a high-throughput homogenous peptide-MHC-I binding assay for obtaining large data sets on peptide-MHC-I interactions (Harndahl et al. 2009 ), (4) a positional scanning combinatorial peptide library approach for a robust and unbiased analysis of the specificity of any MHC-I molecule (Stryhn et al. 1996) , (5) an immunobioinformatics approach to generate predictors of the peptide-MHC-I interaction, NetMHCpan, that allows predictions to be made for any human MHC-I molecules, HLA-I, even those that have not yet been covered by existing data set (Hoof et al. 2009; Nielsen et al. 2007) , and finally (6) we have demonstrated that pre-oxidized MHC-I molecules can be used to generate MHC-I tetramers in a simple \"one-pot, mix-and-read\" manner (Leisner et al. 2008) . Here, we propose that the next goal should be to extend the overall approach to MHC-I molecules of other species of interest. Mouse and rats have been extensively studied in the past, but much less reagents and information have accrued for the MHC-I molecules of other species. Here, we have used an important livestock animal, the pig, as a model system and demonstrated that it indeed is possible to transfer the original human approach to other species. Before attempting to generate a recombinant version of the entire porcine SLA-1*0401 molecule, we grafted the more conserved membrane-proximal \"stalk\" (the immunoglobulin-like class I heavy chain \u03b1 3 and \u03b2 2 m domains) of porcine SLA-1*0401 onto the peptide-binding domain of HLA-A*11:01 generating a chimeric human/ porcine MHC-I molecule. This chimeric molecule retained the peptide-binding specificity of the HLA-A*11:01 molecule, and it clearly demonstrated that the recombinant porcine stalk was functional and, by inference, also properly folded. It also suggests that the peptide-binding specificity of the distal domains do not crucially depend upon the identity of the proximal stalk. Further, comparing the ability of human and porcine \u03b2 2 m to support MHC-I complex formation using either a human or a porcine MHC-I stalk, we demonstrated that every combination (porcine \u03b2 2 m/human-\u03b1 3 , porcine \u03b2 2 m/porcine-\u03b1 3 , human \u03b2 2 m/human-\u03b1 3 , and human \u03b2 2 m/porcine-\u03b1 3 ) showed al- most the same heavy chain dose titration with identical half-saturations. These results illustrate the ability for porcine and human \u03b2 2 m to support complex formation of SLA molecules and vice versa and suggest evolutionary that the stalk is quite conserved. Next, we generated the entire SLA-1*0401 heavy chain and succeeded in generating complexes using human \u03b2 2 m as the light chain and PCSPL as peptide donors. The latter solved the a priori problem of not knowing which peptides would be needed to support proper folding of SLA-1*0401, and it did so in an unbiased manner. Furthermore, this approach is highly efficient since it readily establishes a complete matrix representing the amino acid preference for each amino acid and each position of a nonamer peptide. The specificity of SLA-1*0401 shows two primary anchors: one in positions 9 with a preference for aromatic amino acids and another in position 3 with a preference for negatively charged amino acids. In addition, the SLA-1*0401 features a secondary anchor in position 2 with hydrophobic or polar amino acid preferences.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 173, "end": 183, "text": "Buus 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 184, "end": 207, "text": "Lauemoller et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 702, "end": 725, "text": "Ostergaard et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 825, "end": 844, "text": "(Ferre et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 968, "end": 989, "text": "(Harndahl et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1134, "end": 1154, "text": "(Stryhn et al. 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1398, "end": 1416, "text": "(Hoof et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1417, "end": 1437, "text": "Nielsen et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1594, "end": 1615, "text": "(Leisner et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 159, "end": 166, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "An alternative approach to solve the problem of identifying peptides that support folding of MHC-I molecules of so far unknown specificity is to use our recently developed panspecific predictor, NetMHCpan.

This result was also obvious from an inspection of the PSCPL analysis of the SLA-1*0401. The PSCPL analysis of the P9 specificity of the SLA-1*0401 and the two chimeric molecules suggested that the P9 specificity primarily was determined by the \u03b1 1 domain. This contention was further strengthened by a NetMHCpan-driven in silico analysis of the residues delineating the F pocket, which interacts with P9. This suggests that NetMHCpan can be used to design and interpret detailed experiments addressing the structurefunction relationship of peptide-MHC-I interaction. In the case of SLA-1*0401, NetMHCpan suggests that Y74, G77, and S97 play a prominent role in defining the P9 F pocket. Whereas the NetMHCpan readily captured the P9 anchor residue of SLA-1*0401, it did not capture the P3 anchor (at least not in the 2.4 version).
