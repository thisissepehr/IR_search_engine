Furthermore, heliox diminished the decrease in compliance compared to baseline in LPS-treated animals. In contrast to our hypothesis, heliox did not allow for a reduction in minute volume ventilation during lung-protective mechanical ventilation. Moreover, heliox ventilation showed no effect on neither gas exchange or on lung inflammation. Thereby, our results are somewhat in contrast to studies investigating heliox ventilation in pediatric models as well as to findings in our own animal model of ventilator-induced lung injury, where heliox improved CO 2 removal [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . There may be several explanations for the absence of a beneficial effect of heliox in our model. Within our study design, we strictly regulated tidal volumes at 6 ml/kg. This study design was chosen to reduce confounders, influencing our results. With this design, we believe that any measured effect of heliox on lung injury could be ascribed to heliox only and not to a difference in tidal volumes. This distinction is important, because as a result of a more laminar flow pattern compared to oxygen-in-air ventilation, the mechanism by which heliox improves CO 2 removal might be by an increased tidal volume delivery. In line with this, it was shown that during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in an animal ARDS model, heliox did not alter gas exchange if tidal volume was kept constant [23] . If the findings would also be applicable during protective mechanical ventilation, based on the characteristics of heliox, we hypothesized a decrease in inspiratory pressures needed to generate a set tidal volume, as found before [12] . However, our effects on inspiratory and driving pressures, as well as the compliance, were only modest. Since we cannot exclude that heliox may be beneficial by allowing a further reduction of tidal volumes, which was shown before to increase protection in ARDS [24] [25] [26] , the choice for strictly keeping tidal volumes at 6 ml/kg in these experiments limits the interpretation of our results.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 760, "end": 764, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 765, "end": 769, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 770, "end": 774, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 775, "end": 779, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 780, "end": 784, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1585, "end": 1589, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1822, "end": 1826, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2091, "end": 2095, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2096, "end": 2100, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2101, "end": 2105, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "An alternative explanation for the differences with previous studies may be related to differences in ventilation modes.
