Perennial species are poorly adapted to fire in this system, and post-fire shifts in species composition have been substantial but variable across community types. To generalize across a range of conditions, we investigated whether simple life-history traits could predict how species responded to fire. Further, we classified species into plant functional types (PFTs) based on combinations of life-history traits and evaluated whether these groups exhibited a consistent fire-response. Six life-history traits varied significantly between burned and unburned areas in short (up to 4 years) or long-term (up to 52 years) post-fire datasets, including growth form, lifespan, seed size, seed dispersal, height, and leaf longevity. Forbs and grasses consistently increased in abundance after fire, while cacti were reduced and woody species exhibited a variable response. Woody species were classified into three PFTs based on combinations of lifehistory traits. Species in Group 1 increased in abundance after fire and were characterized by short lifespans, small, wind-dispersed seeds, low height, and deciduous leaves. Species in Group 2 were reduced by fire and distinguished from Group 1 by longer lifespans and evergreen leaves. Group 3 species, which also decreased after fire, were characterized by long lifespans, large non-wind dispersed seeds, and taller heights. Our results show that PFTs based on life-history traits can reliably predict the responses of most species to fire in the Mojave Desert. Dominant, long-lived species of this region possess a combination of traits limiting their ability to recover, presenting a clear example of how a novel disturbance regime may shift selective environmental pressures to favor alternative life-history strategies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "3046", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Fire acts as an evolutionary filter in vegetation communities, favoring species with traits that allow them to survive burn injury or to successfully reproduce in postfire environments (Bond and Keeley 2005; Pausas et al. 2006) .

In fire-prone environments, studies have found support for Egler's (1954) initial floristic composition (IFC) model, which stipulates that most species present during a successional sequence re-establish shortly after disturbance, with minimal dispersal and subsequent establishment of new species (Wilson et al. 1992; Barbour et al. 1999) . Subsequent shifts in species composition reflect the differential growth rates, competitive abilities, and longevities of component species.

However, the proportion of species resprouting after fire is greater at the upper end of precipitation and productivity gradients, while obligate seeders are more abundant in areas with low precipitation (Clarke et al. 2005; Pausas and Bradstock 2007; Nano and Clarke 2011) . In the Mojave Desert, where average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 130 mm in valley bottoms (Redmond 2009 ), resprouting is physiologically limited and dependent upon fire intensity and postfire climatic conditions (Brooks and Minnich 2006; Abella 2009; DeFalco et al. 2010) .

Finally, we defined three broad classes for the lifespan trait (Table 2 ) and based estimates on observational or empirical studies (e.g., Bowers et al. 1995) or information from databases (USDA Fire Effects Information System, http://www.feis-crs.org/beta).

Indeed, this trait alone could serve as a general predictor for the short-term (1-4 years) responses of most species to fire. Forbs and grasses were consistently more abundant in burned areas across both time scales of our analysis, whereas cacti were consistently reduced by fire. Only woody species exhibited a variable response that warranted classification into separate PFTs. The predictive value of growth form as a disturbanceresponse trait likely results from its influence on a variety of factors, including resistance and resilience to physical damage, growth rate, and generation time (Lavorel et al. 2007) . For example, cacti are typically fire-killed due to tissue desiccation (Esque et al. 2004) , produce large seeds with limited dispersal ability, and have episodic recruitment patterns with narrow climatic requirements for successful seedling establishment (God \u0131nez-Alvarez et al. 2003) . Several studies have suggested that PFT approaches should be hierarchically structured within major growth forms (Lavorel et al. 1997; Pausas and Lavorel 2003) , and this assertion is supported by our analysis. Although growth form has high predictive value as a trait, the specific responses we detected may not be generalizable to other fire-prone environments or disturbance types. For example, woody species in fire-prone Mediterranean shrublands are able to regenerate shortly after fire through both seeding and resprouting , in stark contrast to Mojave Desert species. On average, the fire responses of PFT groups we identified for woody species were consistent with predictions based on life-history theory and with the IFC model. For example, woody species in Group 3 were characterized by long lifespans and large seeds, traits that reflect a slow life-history with greater investment toward individual survival (Grime 1977; Adler et al. 2014) . In contrast, Group 1 species had small, wind-dispersed seeds, short lifespans, and deciduous leavestraits thought to reflect investments in fecundity and growth (Franco and Silvertown 2004; Adler et al. 2014) . Species in Group 2, though low in number (n = 5), were intermediate, with some traits linked to investments in fecundity (medium-sized, wind-dispersed seeds) and others linked to investment in survival (evergreen leaves, long lifespan; Adler et al. 2014) . Life-history theory suggests that investments in growth and fecundity increase a species ability to respond to disturbance (Grime 1977) , and thus our results (Group 1 species were favored by fire, Group 2 and 3 species were reduced) are largely consistent with this prediction. Our finding that species with greater longevity were slowest to recover is also consistent with the IFC model, which predicts that differences in species longevities will shape successional trajectories (Egler 1954; Wilson et al. 1992) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 728, "end": 749, "text": "(Lavorel et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 823, "end": 842, "text": "(Esque et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1038, "text": "(God \u0131nez-Alvarez et al. 2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1154, "end": 1175, "text": "(Lavorel et al. 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1200, "text": "Pausas and Lavorel 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1963, "end": 1975, "text": "(Grime 1977;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1976, "end": 1994, "text": "Adler et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2158, "end": 2186, "text": "(Franco and Silvertown 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2187, "end": 2205, "text": "Adler et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2444, "end": 2462, "text": "Adler et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2588, "end": 2600, "text": "(Grime 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2947, "end": 2959, "text": "(Egler 1954;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2960, "end": 2979, "text": "Wilson et al. 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 120, "end": 129, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "It is also important to consider ecological mechanisms beyond links to life-history through which the traits we considered may have influenced species responses to fire. A variety of interrelated factors influence the \"regeneration niche\" in arid environments, or the ability of species to regenerate via seed.

Much of the reproductive potential for these species is therefore stored in aboveground canopies, which may be eliminated by a single fire. In contrast, small seeds compose a large fraction of desert seed banks (Guo et al. 1999) and are able to sift deeper into the soil and survive peak fire temperatures (Brooks 2002; Esque et al. 2010 ). Short-lived and small-seeded desert species also produce seedlings more frequently than do long-lived species, indicating less exacting climatic requirements for germination (Goldberg and Turner 1986) .

First, we were unable to account for intraspecific variability in species traits, which may be as important as interspecific variability in influencing species responses to fire (Dantas et al. 2012) . Secondly, some traits had to be represented through ordinal classes (e.g., height, seed size) rather than with a continuous approach because traits for many species in the Mojave Desert have not been quantitatively measured across a variety of conditions. Both of these limitations may have reduced the accuracy of our PFT approach with respect to our study system, while the second may reduce its generality to other contexts. We also were unable to incorporate information concerning such factors as fire intensity, fire season, topography, and postfire climatic conditions when developing our PFT model, although variation in these factors could conceivably alter the way in which traits influence species' responses to fire. For example, wildfires in the Mojave Desert may range from surface to crown fires depending on annual fuel buildup (Brooks and Minnich 2006) , and this variation in fire intensity could change how woody species of different heights are affected. Similarly, postfire climatic conditions may influence survival rates of scorched vegetation and newly emerged seedlings (DeFalco et al. 2010) . Despite these limitations, our PFT approach was able to predict how the majority of species responded to fire, indicating its generality to a wide range of contexts.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 237, "end": 257, "text": "(Dantas et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1104, "end": 1129, "text": "(Brooks and Minnich 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1376, "text": "(DeFalco et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Fire is becoming a recurrent disturbance in the Mojave Desert driven by an invasive grass/fire feedback cycle (D'Antonio and Vitousek 1992; Brooks and Esque 2002; Brooks et al. 2004) , with once-burned areas becoming more likely to reburn (Brooks and Matchett 2006) . Changes to regional climates expected over the next century may exacerbate this cycle, particularly more frequent shifts between moist El Ni\u00f1o climatic phases that promote annual fuel buildup and subsequent dry La Ni\u00f1a phases that promote fire (McCabe et al. 2004; Allen and Soden 2008) .
