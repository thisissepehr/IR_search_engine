Of the 36 fungi, there are 26 group 1 fungi that indicate water damage and 10 group 2 species that are often found in homes even without water damage, which primarily come from outdoors. 15 Home-exposure estimates to fungi were based on a scale called the Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI), which uses a mathematical formula to convert the concentrations of the 36 fungi into a single number, its ERMI value. This ERMI value describes the water damage and fungal growth in homes based on a comparison with a random national sampling of homes. 15 The aim of this study was to measure and compare the quantity of 36 fungi in patients' sinuses and vacuum cleaner bag dust samples from the homes of these same individuals.

Subjects were recruited for the study in two broad groups: patients with CRS and control subjects without CRS. Patients with CRS had a history of chronic sinusitis symptoms for >3 months. All patients had nasal endoscopic evidence of CRS or nasal polyposis on physical examination. All patients with sinusitis had evidence of CRS on computed tomography examination. Patients, therefore, met criteria for defining the diagnosis of chromic rhinosinusitis based on 2007 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery published guidelines as well as other consensus recommendations. 16, 17 Control subjects were undergoing nasal endoscopy as part of a general otolaryngology examination and had no complaints pertaining to acute rhinosinusitis or CRS. All patients in the control group had other clinical complaints that warranted fiberoptic examination of the nose and throat. Their nasal endoscopy showed no evidence of sinus disease. Four of the patients who underwent surgery for their CRS volunteered to have their sinuses resampled about 6 months to 2 years after their first sampling.",

Surgical alteration of the sinus environment of the four high-fungal CRS patients may explain the reduction in the fungal populations. Many of these seven fungi are generated from outdoor sources like plants and soil (therefore called group 2), and avoidance would be nearly impossible.
