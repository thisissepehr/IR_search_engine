Moenkemeyer and colleagues suggested that GBV-C inhibit host cell apoptosis and consequently maintain chronic GBV-C infection. In agreement with our study, Fas/CD95 expression on T cells were not significantly different in patients receiving ART and degree of Fas/CD95-expressing lymphocytes was comparable between GBV-C co-infected and GBV-C infected 39 .

CD14 ++ CD16 \u2212 classical monocytes presented high phagocytic activity and they are critical for initial inflammatory responses while CD14 ++ CD16 + intermediate monocytes are associated with inflammatory response, and CD14 + CD16 ++ non-classical are considered as patrolling monocytes 21 . Monocyte activation has been reported during DENV and HIV infections and they are associated with disease pathogenesis 22, 40 . Our results demonstrated significant changes of monocyte subsets during DENV and DENV/HIV coinfection. As demonstrated previously 41,42 , we found that in the acute DENV infection, CD14 ++ CD16 \u2212 classical monocytes www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ were significantly decreased while intermediate were increased. Similarly, an expansion of intermediate monocytes and a reduction of classical monocytes during coinfection were found. Monocytes play important roles in the innate and adaptive response and are key players in mediating anti-DENV immune responses. They are the main target cells of DENV infection and after activation produce pro-inflammatory mediators involved in dengue severity 11 . Perturbations of monocyte subsets were also found in treated HIV patients 43, 44 . In agreement we observed that some HIV treated individuals presented increased percentages of intermediate and non-classical monocytes suggesting chronic immune monocyte activation despite virus suppression after ART. More importantly, we report, for the first time (to our knowledge) that DENV/HIV coinfected patients showed increased frequencies of CD14 ++ CD16 + intermediate monocytes. Interestingly we found that, in the context of DENV infection, the MFI of Bcl-2 on CD14 ++ CD16 \u2212 classical monocytes were significantly lower as compared to DENV/HIV coinfection. Activation of apoptosis pathway by DENV infected target cells have been described previously 11 . Our group and others have previously shown that DENV is capable of apoptosis induction in infected monocytes by extrinsic and intrinsic pathways 12, 45 . Is unknown whether apoptosis could occur as directed mechanism of viral dissemination and evasion or simply represents an appropriate host response to limit virus replication. More recently, it was demonstrated that a pro-survival protein, Bcl-xl, is involved in the survival of DENV, Zika virus (ZIKV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) HuH7 infected cells. Suzuki and colleagues proposed that Flavivirus infection induces delayed cell apoptosis and consequently virus spread to neighboring cells leading to higher viral loads and disease severity. Bcl-xL inhibition accelerates apoptosis leading to enhanced viral clearance through macrophage phagocytosis 46 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 517, "end": 519, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 641, "end": 644, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 645, "end": 647, "text": "40", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1378, "end": 1380, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1461, "end": 1463, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2129, "end": 2131, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2279, "end": 2282, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2283, "end": 2285, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2949, "end": 2951, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Screening of 35 apoptosis-related proteins expression on PBMCs of study groups showed upregulation of pro caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 3 in DENV monoinfected group.

However, other regulatory molecules might be involved in apoptosis of activated cells during infection.
