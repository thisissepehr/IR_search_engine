The 10 cysteine residues were changed to serine residues using site-directed mutagenesis. None of the cysteine mutant F proteins reacted with a monoclonal antibody specific for the mature conformation of the F protein, but eight of ten mutants reacted with an immature conformation-specific monoclonal antibody. The transport of these mutant proteins to the cell surface was drastically reduced. All of the cysteine mutant F proteins remained sensitive to endoglycosidase H (endo H) for 3 h after their synthesis. Moreover, cell surface transport of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein co-expressed with each of these cysteine mutant F proteins was also reduced. These results suggest that all cysteine residues participate in the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds, that co-translational disulfide bond formation is crucial to the correct folding and intracellular transport of the F protein, and that interaction of the F and HN proteins takes place intracellulary.",

The HN protein exhibits both the hemagglutinating and the neuraminidase activities, while the F protein has been shown to be involved in virus penetration, hemolysis and cell fusion (for reviews, see Refs. 1 and 2). The F protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor, F o , which is cleaved by proteases to form the biologically active protein consisting of the disulfide-linked subunits Fi and F 2 . The N-terminal portion of the Fi subunit is very hydrophobic, a feature which is highly conserved among paramyxovirus F proteins, and is suggested to mediate fusion of the virus envelope with the target membrane as well as cell fusion resulting in the syncytium formation.",

This suggests that these cysteine residues play important structural and functional roles. Two cysteine residues are present in the signal peptide and are not likely to participate in intramolecular disulfide bonds of the mature protein. The Cl cysteine is in the F 2 subunit, and the remaining 9 cysteine residues are in the Fi subunit. Eight of the 9 cysteine residues are clustered in a narrow region near the transmembrane domain.",

It is suggested that only native disulfide bonds are found in the principal folding intermediates and that disulfide bond formation plays an integral role in the folding. The mechanisms of folding, oligomeric assembly, and sorting of viral membrane proteins have been characterized in recent years (for review, see Ref. 4) . To date, the roles of individual cysteine residues in the folding of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) (5) and measles virus (6) have been reported. On the other hand, the roles of individual cysteine residues of paramyxovirus F proteins have not been characterized and remain largely unknown. Intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds are essential components of the structure of the majority of proteins, and it is of great interest to understand their functions. Roles of disulfide bonds that have been suggested to include (i) aiding in protein folding and maturation and (ii) maintenance of stability and solubility. Two general approaches, in vivo reduction using reducing reagents (7) (8) (9) (10) and site-directed mutagenesis to substitute each of the cysteine residues with other amino acids (5, 6, (11) (12) (13) (14) , have been used to study the functional role of disulfide bond formation within cells.",

            "text": "Expression of the Cysteine Mutant F Proteins-The F protein of the Z strain of Sendai virus possesses 12 cysteine residues. The first and second cysteine residues are present in the signal peptide while the rest are distributed across the entire ectodomain of the protein. The signal peptide is cleaved in the ER, and thus the remaining 10 cysteine residues are present in the mature F protein. The relative locations of these cysteine residues are highly conserved among paramyxovirus F proteins, and these cysteines are likely to participate in intramolecular disulfide bonds in the mature protein. To examine the processing of the intramolecular disulfide bonds and their contribution to the structure of the F protein, site-directed mutagenesis using PCR was used to substitute each cysteine residue by a serine residue to prevent the formation of disulfide bonds. Ten expression plasmids of the cysteine mutant F proteins, named FC1S to FC10S, were prepared as shown in Fig. 1 . Recombinant plasmids were introduced into COS cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (22) , and the cells were incubated for 48 h. Transfected cells were labeled with [ 35 S]methionine and [ 35 S] cysteine for 10 min, chased for 1 h, then lysed in RIPA buffer. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-F antiserum and analyzed by 9% SDS-PAGE under reducing ( Fig. 2A) or nonreducing (Fig. 2B) conditions. In Fig. 2A , pSRD-F transfected cells gave one main band (lane 3) with mobility corresponding to the uncleaved form of F, or F o , synthesized in Sendai virusinfected COS cells as reported previously (16) . The 10 cysteine mutant-transfected cells also gave one main band corresponding to the uncleaved F o protein. A minor band of about 60 kDa was also detected in all cells transfected with recombinant plasmids (lanes 3-13), and this seems to be nonspecifically degraded F proteins or unglycosylated F proteins, because the unglycosylated F proteins and immature F proteins could be detected by the antiserum used here, which was raised against the unglycosylated F proteins expressed in E. coli. The cysteine mutant pSRD-FC1S ( Fig. 2A, lane 4) transfected cells gave three bands, one main band corresponding to the F o protein, the common minor band (60 kDa), and another higher molecular weight species of F protein. The alteration of the cysteine residue of the F 2 subunit to a serine residue introduced a new glycosylation site in this protein sequence. Thus, the higher molecular weight species seems to be the F protein utilizing the additional new glycosylation site. Approximately equal levels of most of the F proteins in the cells transfected with the above plasmids were detected by Western blot analysis (data not shown). This showed that these 10 cysteine mutant F proteins were efficiently expressed at almost the same level as wild-type F protein in pSRD-F transfected cells and were relatively stable.",

            "text": "Under nonreducing conditions, formation of disulfide bonds in a protein should allow it to assume a more compact form and to migrate faster on SDS-PAGE than unfolded forms without disulfide bonds, as reported by Machamer et al. (27) . As shown in Fig. 2B , the compact and unfolded forms of monomer F proteins and aggregates were detected with the mutants as well as the wild-type F protein. The compact form migrated as a 60 kDa band and the unfolded form migrated as a 66 kDa band, which is similar to the molecular mass of the reduced form of F protein as shown in Fig. 2A . Most of the wild-type F protein migrated as the compact form (lane 3). On the other hand, the relative amount of the unfolded form of the each 10 cysteine mutant F proteins was increased, and the ratio of the compact form to unfolded form was roughly 1 as determined by densitometry (lanes [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . This indicated that all cysteine residues contributed to make the compact form. No obvious oligomeric form of F proteins was detected in the mutant or wild-type F protein-expressing cells. This implied that F protein does not form disulfide-linked oligomers. Although the aggregates disappeared from the top of the gel when the radiolabeled cell lysates were reduced by boiling in 5% 2-mercaptoethanol before SDS-PAGE, treatment with thiol alkylation reagents such as iodoacetamide (IAA) or iV-ethylmaleimide (NEM) had little effect on the formation of the aggregates. In preliminary experiments, we did not detect such aggregates in Sendai virus-infected cells analyzed under nonreducing conditions. These observations indicated that these aggregates were formed before sample preparation and that other viral factors might be required for efficient folding of F protein.",

In preliminary experiments, f-921 detected intracellular F proteins but not cell surface-transported F proteins. MAb f-236 recognized both F o and Fj in the immunoprecipitation, but specifically recognized F o in Western blot analysis (unpublished data). MAb f-49 recognized the mature form of F protein (24) . Thus, these MAbs bind independent epitopes. As shown in Fig. 3 , only the wild-type F protein was precipitated with anti-mature conformation MAb f-49 (panel A, lane 3), the wild-type F protein and a small amount of FC2S protein were precipitated with MAb f-236 (panel B, lanes 3 and 5), and the wild-type F protein and most of the cysteine mutant F proteins, except for the FC5S and FC6S proteins, were precipitated with MAb f-921 (panel C, lanes 3-7 and 10-13). These data indicated that loss of any one of the cysteine residues of the F protein had dramatic effects on the immunoreactivity to anti mature MAbs and that all of the cysteine mutant F proteins were blocked at some stage in their maturation.",

            "text": "Cell Surface Transport of Cysteine Mutant F Proteins-To examine the expression of cysteine mutant F proteins in the cells and their transport to the cell surface, the cells were fixed with acetone or paraformaldehyde and examined by indirect immunofluorescence staining using anti-F antiserum. To detect subcellular localization, the cells expressing wild-type and cysteine mutant F proteins were fixed with acetone, then examined by indirect immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 4 , panels A, C, E, G, I, K, and M). We expected that a pair of cysteine mutants which had altered cysteine residues involving the same disulfide bond might show the same expression phenotype. Recent results by Iwata et al. (15) identified specific disulfide bonds between Cl and C2, C3 and C4, and C5 and C6, while CIO appears to be linked to C7, C8, or C9. Thus, only the 5 cysteine mutants FC1S, FC3S, FC5S, FC7S, and FC8S were shown in Fig. 4 . The COS cells transfected with vector plasmid pSRD showed no fluorescence (panel A), whereas the cells transfected with pSRD-F (panel C), pSRD-FClS (panel E), pSRD-FC3S (panel G), pSRD-FC5S (panel I), pSRD-FC7S (panel K), and pSRD-FC8S (panel M) displayed a bright staining pattern, and the frequency of positive cells was estimated to be 5-10% of total cells in each case. As shown in panel C, the cells expressing wild-type F protein displayed internal staining throughout the cytoplasmic reticulum as well as in the juxtanuclear region. On the other hand, the cysteine mutant-expressing cells showed an intracellular staining pattern limited to a reticular perinuclear structure (panels E, G, I, K, and M). This indicates that cysteine mutant F proteins were efficiently expressed in these cells. To detect whether the expressed proteins were transported to the cell surface, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde instead of acetone, then examined by indirect immunofluorescence staining. The cells transfected with pSRD-F displayed a staining pattern on the cell surface (panel B), whereas the surface fluorescence of the cells transfected with the cysteine mutant F plasmids was clearly much less intense than that of cells expressing wild-type F protein (panels D, F, H, J, and L). This indicates that the wild-type F protein was properly transported to the cell surface, but these cysteine mutant F proteins were not transported to the cell surface.",

The F protein is synthesized on the rough ER, then glycosylated in a well-defined sequence in the ER and Golgi apparatus in the process of transport to the cell surface. High mannose-type sugar chains of the glycoprotein in the ER and the cis-Golgi compartments are sensitive to digestion with endoglycosidase H (endo H), while sugar chains once trimmed and further processed in the medial and trans-Golgi compartments are not. We therefore determined the critical state in the transport process of the cysteine mutant F proteins by testing endo H sensitivity of the sugar chains. To follow the process of maturation of glycoproteins, the transfected cells were labeled with [ 35 S]methionine and [ 35 S] cysteine for 10 min at 48 h after transfection. After being chased for 3 h, cells were lysed and the lysates were analyzed after immunoprecipitation with anti-F followed by endo H digestion, as described in \"MATERIALS AND METHODS.\" As shown in pSRD-FClS-transfected cells was partially glycosylated F protein modified at a novel glycosylation motif generated by the mutagenesis. Because the antiserum used in this study reacts efficiently with immature F protein, relatively large amounts of endo H-sensitive species of F proteins were detected even in the cells expressing wild-type F protein.

When mutations are made in either one of a pair of cysteines that are normally linked in a mature structure, the phenotype of the mutant proteins is often similar. In our study, two species of F proteins were detected in the cysteine mutant F proteins under nonreducing conditions: folded F protein and unfolded F protein. This indicated that formation of incorrect disulfide bonds led to rapid unfolding or rearrangement of disulfide bonds. As shown in Fig. 3 , almost all cysteine mutants exhibited a drastic decrease in reactivity to the mature conformation specific MAb f-49. This result showed that cysteine residues contribute to the whole protein structure through disulfide bridging, even though they are fairly distant from each other in the primary amino acid sequence. MAb f-921 could not immunoprecipitate FC5S and FC6S proteins but could immunoprecipitate the rest of the mutants. This implied that the epitope of f-921 is present in the loop formed by the C5 and C6 disulfide bond, and the antigenic site is exposed when the F protein is inside the cells, but buried when the F protein is expressed on the cell surface. FC2S showed only slight reactivity to MAb f-236. These data indicated that f-236 and f-921 may recognize cysteine-rich domains and supported the idea that the cysteine-rich domain in the bunched structure of paramyxovirus F proteins is recognized by MAbs (29) .",

It seems that type I transmembrane proteins more strictly require disulfide bond formation than do type II proteins in order to exit from the ER.",

Thus, we examined the effect of co-expression of HN on cell surface expression of cysteine mutant F proteins. Although the expression of both proteins was detected at roughly equal levels by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5B) , cell surface expression of cysteine mutant F proteins was not detected, and a decrease of cell surface expression of HN protein was observed (Fig. 5A) . These observations are in accord with the down-regulation of the human parainfiuenza type 3 (HPIV3) HN protein cell surface expression by the mutant F protein containing an intracellular retention signal (30) . Recently, many reports have shown a direct interaction of paramyxovirus F and HN proteins (31) (32) (33) (34) . However, the cell surface expression of F and HN proteins is reported to occur at different rates because of the different degrees of association with BiP (35) . Thus, decrease of cell surface expression of HN protein in the cysteine mutants coexpressing cells may be caused not only by direct interactions of the F and HN proteins but also by indirect interaction affected by binding of molecular chaperons such as BiP or calnexin.",

On the other hand, all cysteine mutant F proteins remained sensitive to digestion with endo H even after a chase of 3 h [Fig. 6, lanes 2( + ), 3( + ), 4( + ), 5( + ), 6( + ), 7( + ), 8( + ), 9( + ), 10( + ), and 11 (+) ]. Although two species of F proteins were found in the cells transfected with pSRD-FClS, the migration patterns were similar to other cysteine mutants after endo H digestion [Fig. 6, lane 2( + )]. This indicated that the higher molecular weight species of F protein detected inFig. 5. Co-expression of HN and wild-type or cysteine mutant F proteins.
