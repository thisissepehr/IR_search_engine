In this work, we used gene expression and virus growth data from influenza-infected mice to determine how moderate and deadly influenza viruses may invoke unique inflammatory responses and the role these responses play in disease pathology. We found that the relationship between virus growth and the inflammatory response for all viruses tested can be characterized by ultrasensitive response in which the inflammatory response is gated until a threshold concentration of virus is exceeded in the lung after which strong inflammatory gene expression and cytokine production occurs. This finding challenges the notion that deadly influenza viruses invoke unique cytokine and inflammatory responses and provides additional evidence that pathology is regulated by virus load, albeit in a highly nonlinear fashion. These findings suggests immunomodulatory treatments could focus on altering inflammatory response dynamics to improve disease pathology.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Ultrasensitive Mechanism Regulates Influenza-Induced Inflammation PLOS Pathogens |", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Influenza viruses present major challenges to public health, evident by the 2009 influenza pandemic. Highly pathogenic influenza virus infections generally coincide with early, high levels of inflammatory cytokines that some studies have suggested may be regulated in a strain-dependent manner. However, a comprehensive characterization of the complex dynamics of the inflammatory response induced by virulent influenza strains is lacking. Here, we applied gene co-expression and nonlinear regression analysis to time-course, microarray data developed from influenza-infected mouse lung to create mathematical models of the host inflammatory response. We found that the dynamics of inflammation-associated gene expression are regulated by an ultrasensitive-like mechanism in which low levels of virus induce minimal gene expression but expression is strongly induced once a threshold virus titer is exceeded. Cytokine assays confirmed that the production of several key inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1, exhibit ultrasensitive behavior. A systematic exploration of the pathways regulating the inflammatoryassociated gene response suggests that the molecular origins of this ultrasensitive response mechanism lie within the branch of the Toll-like receptor pathway that regulates STAT1 phosphorylation. This study provides the first evidence of an ultrasensitive mechanism regulating influenza virus-induced inflammation in whole lungs and provides insight into how different virus strains can induce distinct temporal inflammation response profiles.

PRR ligation triggers innate immune responses and leads to the induction of inflammatory and antiviral gene expression, which together function to limit pathogen growth, activate the adaptive immune response, and ultimately resolve the infection [1, 2] . Precise regulation of PRR-mediated signaling is necessary to both avoid inadvertent tissue damage in response to non-pathogenic stimuli, and to prevent immunopathology resulting from excessive expression of inflammatory molecules. In essence, the ideal inflammatory response must exhibit a balance between appropriate activation against a genuine threat and self-limiting behavior once that threat has been controlled.

While the H1N1-infected lung tissue did not exceed an average peak virus titer of 10 7.4 PFU/g (peak titer occurs at 48 hpi in Fig 4A) , we observed increased transcriptional activity in H1N1-infected mouse lung tissues after this time point, suggesting either that the actual peak virus titer occurred between 48 hpi and the subsequent time point (60 hpi), or that the model-predicted threshold was slightly over-approximated.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 165, "end": 169, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 184, "end": 188, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 394, "end": 398, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 421, "end": 425, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 203, "end": 210, "text": "Fig 4B,", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 646, "end": 653, "text": "Fig 4C)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1105, "end": 1135, "text": "S2 Fig for additional details)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1642, "end": 1649, "text": "Fig 4A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Inflammation-associated gene expression is regulated by an ultrasensitive mechanism"}, {"text": "We next sought to validate the threshold model by attempting to predict cytokine-associated gene expression in influenza virus-infected lung when only the virus titers are known. For this, we selected the H5N1 virus, which has previously been associated with an excessive illustration of an ultrasensitive response to increasing stimulus. In our model, the response is the change in inflammatory-associated gene expression and the stimulus is the lung virus titers. A segmented linear model (SLM) can approximate key aspects of the ultrasensitive response. In this study, the response is gene expression and the stimulus is the concentration of virus in the lung (c) The mathematical definition of an SLM. Below some threshold virus titer (Thr), the scaled eigengene (SE) is approximated by a linear model that is a function of the log of the virus titer, the slope (a 1 ), and the intercept (b 1 ). After the threshold virus titer is reached, the slope and intercept parameters change (a 2 and b 2 ) to describe the SE after activation. The parameters were fit to the data shown in panel (a) and used to predict the N1 SE in newly infected mice. (d) shows a comparison of the H5N1 N1 eigengene from an infection at a dose of 10 5 PFU (as shown in Fig 3) and an infection at a dose of 10 3 PFU. Panel (e) compares the predicted scaled eigengene based on the SLM versus the measured eigengene behavior in mice infected with 10 3 PFU of the H5N1 virus. Panel (f) shows gene expression changes for selected constituent genes of the N1 module as a function of virus titer. cytokine response [10] . We infected mice with 10 3 PFU of the H5N1 virus (a 100-fold reduced dose compared with that used in the experiments to fit the model), determined lung virus titers at the same time points used for the initial experiment (S3 Fig), and then evaluated the segmented linear model's ability to predict cytokine-associated gene expression. First, we confirmed that the original transcripts assigned to the N1 module were again co-expressed, and thus we used the same transcripts originally assigned to the N1 module to determine the eigengene (see S4 Fig for an analysis of the conservation of the N1 module between the two experiments). In this experiment, as expected, the peak average virus titer (10 9.3\u00b10.21 PFU/g) for the 10 3 PFU dose was delayed compared with that for the 10 5 PFU dose (S3 Fig, compare to Fig 1) . Moreover, the SDE exhibited an 18-h delay in activation and a 42-h delay in peak expression compared with the 10 5 PFU N1 eigengene (Fig 4D) . Importantly, based on the virus titers alone, the fitted segmented linear model accurately predicted N1-like SDE behavior (R 2 = 0.71 for all time points and R 2 = 0.87 for time points up to peak expression; Fig 4E and S5 Fig), and this could be further demonstrated at the individual gene level for specific N1-associated transcripts (e.g., Herc6, Stat1 and Irf7; Fig 4F) . These observations provide strong evidence that activation of inflammatory-associated gene expression is dictated by a specific virus concentration in infected tissue, and further suggest the novel possibility that the pulmonary innate inflammatory response has a nonlinear, ultrasensitive-like activation profile that promotes tolerance to low concentrations of virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1587, "end": 1591, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1248, "end": 1254, "text": "Fig 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1819, "end": 1824, "text": "Fig),", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2137, "end": 2150, "text": "S4 Fig for an", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 2388, "end": 2410, "text": "Fig, compare to Fig 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2545, "end": 2553, "text": "(Fig 4D)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 2764, "end": 2783, "text": "Fig 4E and S5 Fig),", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 2921, "end": 2928, "text": "Fig 4F)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Inflammation-associated gene expression is regulated by an ultrasensitive mechanism"}, {"text": "The dynamics of key inflammatory cytokines are consistent with an ultrasensitive response", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Inflammation-associated gene expression is regulated by an ultrasensitive mechanism"}, {"text": "Although transcriptional activation of IFN-stimulated and inflammatory gene expression is a reasonable measure of the effects of inflammation response stimulation, we reasoned that a bona fide ultrasensitive mechanism that regulates this response should be reflected in other aspects of the associated signaling pathway(s). Indeed, of the 17 cytokines associated with the N1 module, 15-including key inflammatory proteins, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)-were significantly correlated with the N1 module eigengene (Pearson's \u03c10.5; FDR-adjusted P-value < 0.01; see S6 Table) . In addition, when the protein expression levels of these 15 cytokines were plotted against the corresponding titer data, we observed dynamics similar to that of the inflammatory-associated N1 gene module. Initially, protein expression was low but strongly increased only after the virus titers exceeded the threshold of~10 8 PFU/gram determined in the gene regulation model (Fig 5A) . In contrast, most of the protein levels of the other measured cytokines with transcripts that were not assigned to the N1 module did not show any obvious relationship to the proposed threshold response (S6 Fig). The only major exceptions were LIF, RANTES, and IL18 (S6 Fig). LIF's gene transcript was not annotated on the arrays whereas IL18's transcript was not identified as differentially expressed and therefore was not included in the clustering study. The RANTES transcript was included in the clustering study and assigned by the WGCNA algorithm to N2 although the transcript's correlation to the N1 eigengene suggests it could also have been assigned to the N1 module (Pearson correlation = 0.84 and 0.89 to the N1 and N2 eigengene, respectively). Some proteins appeared to conform to the threshold model in pH1N1-infected, but not H1N1-or H5N1-infected, mice. These may be cytokines that have strain-dependent responses and do not conform to the model. Overall, changes in N1-associated cytokine protein levels in influenza virus-infected mouse lungs were consistent with the proposed virus-titer regulated threshold-mechanism underlying the IFN-mediated response. Threshold-like behavior is observed on upstream and downstream components of the IFN signaling pathway. (a) Lung tissues from the same infected mice used for the original gene expression analysis were subjected to cytokine array analysis. Thirty-two cytokine protein concentrations were measured and log scaled (data points lower than the limit of detection for each protein were set to 0.001 to allow scaling), and the average fold change relative to uninfected, time-matched lung samples was determined. The heat map illustrates protein expression values for the 17 cytokines that had transcripts assigned to the N1 module (a blue-to-yellow scale shows expression levels, as indicated by the color key at the top of the panel; time points in which the change in the cytokine levels were not significant [FDR-adjust P < 0.05] were set to zero); of these, 15 exhibited expression profiles that were highly significantly correlated with the corresponding transcript and the N1 module eigengene (Pearson's \u03c1 0.4 and FDR < 0.01; eotaxin and TNF-\u03b1 were the only two that did not exhibit a significant, direct correlation). Non-N1 cytokines are shown in S6 (Fig 5B) . For the H1N1 data, significant levels of pSTAT1 were observed at 36 hpi which-as noted previously-corresponds to the time immediately after the virus titers in H1N1-infected mice reached their peak (see previous discussion). On the other hand, significant increases in phosphorylated IRF3 (pIRF3) were observed only in pH1N1 and H5N1 infections, whereas significant increases in IFN-\u03b2 were observed only in the H5N1 infection. Changes in the levels of IFN-\u03b2 and pIRF3 occurred after significant increases in pSTAT1 and IFN-\u03b1 occurred. As such, the change in the percentage of pSTAT1 was more closely correlated to the N1 eigengene than was that of pIRF3 (correlation = 0.77\u00b10.06 and 0.67\u00b10.09 respectively), and significant increases in pSTAT1 corresponded to time points at which the mean virus titer exceeded the threshold level identified in the gene expression analysis (~10 7.78 PFU/g). The greater correlation of IFN\u03b1 and STAT1 activation to the inflammation-associated, N1 module's gene expression dynamics and the enrichment of the N1 module for the IRF7 binding sequence (Table 1) suggest that the primary driver of the threshold-regulated, inflammatory gene response originates along the IRF7 !

Characterization of key aspects of the inflammatory response, such as the onset and peak inflammatory gene expression, require a high temporal resolution of the virus growth and host response dynamics; an experimental design that was unique to our study.

The conserved rate of activation implies that the immune response detects the virus concentration but not the virus growth rate; suggesting the innate immune response is naturally limited in its ability to respond to high growth influenza viruses. Additionally, studies in knockout mice indicate that type I IFN-associated pathways are essential for protection during primary infection [42] and that earlier initiation of these pathways coincides with increased survival in mice infected with highly pathogenic isolates [43] . In combination with these studies, the findings here suggest a novel means of protecting high risk groups by treating them with compounds that target the molecular mechanisms responsible for the threshold behavior. Lowering the threshold required to induce the cytokine response may be a means of providing protection from severe influenza infection. Since these compounds would target host proteins, such treatments would be effective against various influenza virus strains.

The eigengene is the first principle component (equivalently the first eigenvector) of a matrix of gene expression data. In clustered data in which all genes are highly correlated (as in the case of WGCNA), the eigengene is a scaled approximation of how gene expression changes for all genes in a module (i.e. cluster) across experimental conditions. The eigengene of module N1 is shown in (a) for the 56 experimental conditions considered in this study (4 infection conditions and 14 time points). Each point represents data from a single animal in each experimental condition (3 animals per condition except for H5N1-infected animals at 3 hpi which had 2; total of 167 samples). While the eigengene illustrates the changes in gene expression of module member genes, it is difficult to interpret the changes with respect to the control data. We therefore scaled the eigengene by subtracting from time-matched data the average of the eigengene from mock-infected animals and then dividing by the highest average eigengene for any experimental condition. The scaled difference of the eigengene (SDE) is shown in (b). The SDE now represents the fraction of greatest gene expression (i.e., the fraction of the largest log fold change in gene expression observed between all time-matched, infected-to-control samples). For example, the SDE peaks in experimental condition 50 (H5N1-infected animals at 30 hpi), corresponding to the condition in which the log fold change was greatest for N1 member genes (see Fig 3) . The SDE for pH1N1-infected animals at day 3 pi (condition 40) is~0.5. We would expect the log fold change to be approximately half of that observed in H5N1-infected animals at 30 hpi (see the heatmaps in Fig 3) . For completeness, we overlay the mean (lines) and the standard deviation To create the segmented linear model to describe the relationship between the N1 module eigengene and the virus titer data, we selected all titer data that occurred prior to and included the peak of the eigengene and then scaled the data such that the eigengene was bound between [0,1]. The model was then fit to the scaled data. Panel (a) shows the time points selected as training data from each infection data set (indicated by the orange dots); and panel (b) shows the number of data points available for different ranges of the virus titer (top) and the segmented model's fit to the training data (bottom). In panel (c), we used the residuals (i.e., the difference between the predicted values and the actual values) to compare the SLM's accuracy to that of a simple linear model. The line is the running average and the shaded region is the 95% confidence interval of the mean. The mean of the residuals of the segmented model was always near zero for the full range of virus titers and, thus, is a better fit than the linear model. Two procedures were applied to determine whether the N1 genes that we identified as co-expressed in the original clustering analysis were also co-expressed in tissue from mice infected with 10 3 PFU of H5N1 virus. (a) Compares the correlation between all 1,021 N1 gene transcripts and the eigengene (referred to as the kME) in the original gene expression data (10 5 PFU infection conditions (referred to as '10 5 PFU')) and the 10 3 PFU infection condition (referred to as '10 3 PFU'). More than 90% of the genes exhibited a kME > 0.9. (b) The WGCNA algorithm was repeated with all differentially expressed genes (FDR-adjusted P-value < 0.01 and fold change > 2 for at least 1 time point) from the 10 3 PFU H5N1 virus infection, and then the Fisher's exact test was used to identify modules enriched for N1 genes. Of the modules in the newly constructed co-expression network, only one module was enriched with the N1 transcripts. Specifically, of the 826 genes originally assigned to N1, 528 (Benjimini-Hochberg-adjusted P-value < 2.2E-16) were differentially expressed and assigned to the same module in the 10 3 PFU infection condition, as illustrated by the Venn diagram. . The H5N1-10 3 PFU eigengene was constructed using the same set of probes assigned to the N1 module from the 10 5 PFU infection condition and scaled to between [0,1]; and then the segmented linear model trained to the 10 5 PFU H1N1, pH1N1, and H5N1 data was used to predict H5N1-10 3 PFU scaled eigengene values. Panel (a) shows a comparison of the predicted (black) and actual (pink arrows depicting the temporal evolution of the gene response) eigengenes, with error bars illustrating the standard deviation of the eigengene and of the log 10 of the virus titer. Panel (b) shows how the prediction residuals are distributed over time. For each time point, individual data points (black points) are shown, as well as the average (red points) and standard deviation (gray bars). The greatest deviations occurred at d5 and d7, which was expected as the model was designed only to predict the onset of gene activation and the peak gene expression (peak of the eigengene). On days 5 and 7 post-infection, both the virus titers and gene expression has already peaked and are declining. Panel (c) shows how the prediction residuals are distributed across the spectrum of observed virus titers, as compared to a linear model directly fit to the H5N1-10 3 PFU N1 eigengene. Individual residuals are indicated by points, and the running average and the 95% confidence intervals are shown by the colored lines and the gray shading, respectively. As for the 10 5 PFU infection condition, the segmented model performed well across the entire virus titer spectrum, and was significantly better than a linear model fitted directly to the data. (TIF) S6 Fig. Protein concentrations of non-N1 module cytokines. As described in the Fig 5 leg end, cytokine concentrations were assayed in the lungs of mice infected with 10 5 PFU of H1N1, pH1N1, and H5N1 and compared with those in lung tissues from mock-infected animals. This heat map illustrates protein expression values for non-N1-associated cytokines (14 cytokine expression profiles are shown; IL-12(p70)(78) was not detected at any time point and is not included), with a blue-to-yellow scale indicating expression levels (see the key to the right of the panel). The module to which the protein's mRNA transcript was assigned during clustering is shown on the right hand side of the heat map (proteins whose gene transcripts were not DE are labeled 'NA'), and the average virus titers are shown below the heat map (red indicates that titers exceeded the threshold concentration predicted by the segmented linear model). While IL-18 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) exhibited protein expression patterns consistent with N1 module behavior, the transcripts mapping to these proteins were not differentially expressed and were excluded from the co-expression network construction. (TIF) S7 Fig. Virus titer and immunoblot data from an additional infection experiment with 10 5 PFU of H1N1, pH1N1, or H5N1 virus. As described in the Fig 5 legend (panel b) , an additional set of mice was infected with 10 5 PFU of H1N1, pH1N1, or H5N1 virus to determine total and phosphorylated levels of transcription factors by means of immunoblotting. Here, virus titers (with standard deviation indicated by gray bars) for each infection condition are shown in panel (a), and immunoblot results are shown in panels (b) and (c). For immunoblot analyses, relative protein concentrations were determined by calculating the ratio of the gray intensity of the measured protein (I\u03baB\u03b1, total IRF7, total IRF3 ['IRF3'], phosphorylated IRF3 [pIRF3'], total STAT1 ['STAT1'], and phosphorylated STAT1 ['pSTAT1']) relative to the gray intensity of actin (i.e., the loading control; referred to as the relative signal intensity, RSI) in each tissue sample. A linear model was used to compare the mean RSI of each protein at each time point to the mean RSI measured in uninfected animals (referred to as 'na\u00efve'), and a significant difference was defined as having a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. The mean RSI of total IRF3, IRF7, and I\u03baB\u03b1 did not significantly deviate from the na\u00efve data, but pSTAT1, pIRF3 and total STAT1 significantly differed from the na\u00efve data at several time points (signifi- The intramodular correlation (kME or correlation between each transcript and the eigengene) can be used to assess clustering quality. We show boxplots to illustrate the distribution of the kMEs for all transcripts belonging to the N1 and N2 modules. (TIF) S11 Fig. Applying signed co-expression network analysis also clusters the N1 kME+ transcripts. The N1 module presented in this work was identified by developing an unsigned co-expression network and then focusing on the kME-and kME+. Therefore, the N1 kME+ set of genes should also cluster when developing a signed co-expression network. We confirmed this by repeating the WGCNA procedure for signed network (power = 14) . Of the N1 kME+ transcripts, 93.2% were assigned to the same cluster in the signed co-expression network (the new module is referred to as N1signed). Furthermore, 90.9% if the N1signed transcripts were N1 kME+ transcripts. We then confirmed that the same eigengene dynamics were observed. The scaled difference of the eigengene (SDE) of the N1signed module is shown versus time (a) and versus virus titers (b). (TIF) S1 File.
