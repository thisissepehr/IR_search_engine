In other words, healthcare services are products generated in a production process that uses healthcare inputs in the form of labour, capital, and other intermediaries. The most efficient healthcare provider will use the least amount of inputs to provide a given number of healthcare services. The efficient frontiers are constructed based on the fundamental assumption that healthcare providers, like other manufacturing agents, can reduce or increase their inputs depending on their particular demand for healthcare services. However, this assumption in healthcare production function may not hold, for two reasons. First, the demand for healthcare services cannot always be predicted with enough accuracy, and, as a result, healthcare providers are bound to operate with excess capacity. Second, the presence of excess capacity suggests that healthcare providers cannot readily alter their level of inputs in the pursuit of greater efficiency, leading to rigidities in the adjustment of healthcare inputs. Several studies [5] [6] [7] [8] show that there is a substantial excess inpatient capacity among hospitals, with one study by the American Hospital Association [9] approximating the occupancy rates to be as low as 63% in American hospitals. Moreover, given the highly regulated operating environment and the prevalence of public finances as a key source of healthcare services in most developed countries [4], healthcare providers are often required to maintain a reserve or standby capacity to meet unforeseen health needs [5, 10]; for example, the recent COVID-19 pandemic.",
