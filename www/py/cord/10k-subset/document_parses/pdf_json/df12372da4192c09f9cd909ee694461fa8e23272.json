The role of enterovirus interference has been investigated most intensively, in part, because of known interference between Sabin types 1-3. Although the effect of concurrent enteric infection with NPEV on the immune response to OPV has been studied extensively, no published studies investigated the impact of other enteric viruses that may be prevalent in young children in developing coun-tries. The 4 enteric virus types we studied account for most cases of viral gastroenteritis in children worldwide [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . Testing for common bacterial enteropathogens was included to identify any interference by these infections on the immunogenicity of OPV. As expected, rates of concurrent enteric infection in this population were high. However, evidence of interference by enteric viral and bacterial pathogens was found only with the second dose of Sabin types 1 and 2. These pathogens did not affect the immunogenicity of the first OPV dose, and the overall effect was minimal, because the seroresponses to types 1 and 2 were high after the first dose. Simultaneous testing for multiple viral and bacterial organisms allowed us to demonstrate that interference with Sabin vaccine virus replication is not related to specific pathogens and is associated with the presence of 1 or more enteric pathogens. The finding that this interference occurs only after the second dose of Sabin types 1 and 2 suggests that decreased shedding of the vaccine strains after the second OPV dose allows the replication of other enteric pathogens to alter immunogenicity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 201, "end": 204, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 205, "end": 208, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 209, "end": 212, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 213, "end": 217, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 218, "end": 222, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 223, "end": 227, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 228, "end": 232, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 233, "end": 237, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 238, "end": 241, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 750, "end": 754, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 755, "end": 759, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 760, "end": 764, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 765, "end": 769, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 770, "end": 774, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 775, "end": 779, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 780, "end": 784, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our observations that the baseline rate of concurrent enteric infections at the time of OPV administration was high, that a variety of pathogens affected the immunogenicity ofOPV, and that concurrent infections occurred throughout the study period suggest that timing the administration of OPV to particular seasons will not likely result in improved responses to OPV.

Improving seroconversion to poliovirus type 3 should result in decreased breakthrough poliomyelitis in highly vaccinated populations. Data from this and other recent studies demonstrate that the most important goal of vaccine programs for infants in developing areas is to increase seroresponse to Sabin type 3 [41, 44] . Our study indicates that this objective can best be accomplished by increasing the Sabin type 3 component of the OPV formulation. Fecal shedding of Sabin type 3 increased after the second OPV dose and was associated with significant improvement in seroresponse to Sabin type 3. Fecal shedding of Sabin type 3 was inversely proportional to shedding of Sabin types 1 and 2, suggesting that interference by Sabin types 1 and 2 accounted for decreased seroresponses to Sabin type 3 after the first OPV dose.

In developing countries, OPV is usually administered in 4 doses at intervals of 4-6 weeks, beginning at birth. Previous evaluations of OPV have assessed variables that might affect immuno-genicity, especially of Sabin type 3: absolute potency of Sabin types 1-3, relative proportions of the 3 strains in the vaccine preparation, age at first vaccine dose, and the interval between doses and the number of doses in the primary series [32] . The enhanced OPV formulation containing Sabin types 1-3 in ratios of 10:1:6 is the only revised formulation that has been associated with improved immunogenicity. The Sabin type 3 dose in the enhanced OPV formulation is twice that of the standard OPV formulation and is given in a preparation with 10 6 , lOS, and 6 X lOS TCID so of Sabin types 1-3. The initial experience with enhanced OPV, reported by Patriarca et al. [41] in 1988 among Brazilian infants, demonstrated a significant increase in seroconversion rates for Sabin type 3 compared with standard OPV. In 1990, the Global Advisory Group of the Expanded Programme on Immunization recommended the use of the enhanced OPV formulation in developing countries [45] . However, a recent study in Brazil and Gambia that compared 4 OPV formulations (including the standard 10:1:3 and enhanced 10:1:6) administered to infants beginning at birth or before age 6 weeks showed no improvement in the immunogenicity of Sabin type 3; lower seroconversion rates to both standard and enhanced formulations were associated with the presence of passively acquired antibodies to all 3 vaccine serotypes [44] . The infants were younger than participants in the first Brazilian study and in our study and were more likely to have preexisting poliovirus antibodies. The fact that preexisting poliovirus antibodies did not account for poor vaccine responses in our study population can be attributed to beginning vaccination at ages 6 weeks to 6 months.

These concurrent enteric infections are highly prevalent regardless of season. Vaccination of infants at older ages reduced the effect of passively acquired poliovirus antibodies.
