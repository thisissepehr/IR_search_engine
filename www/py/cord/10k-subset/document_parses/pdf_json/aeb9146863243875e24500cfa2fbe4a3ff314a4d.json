            "text": "in the ambulatory setting. Patients themselves do not always mention their symptoms, because they are afraid of getting medication or distracting their oncologist from the anticancer treatment. Professionals do not always recognize symptoms because they do not systematically monitor them. Symptom assessment commonly takes place retrospectively, relaying on patient recall. As a result, adequate adjustments of symptom management are often delayed, resulting in symptom burden and less than optimal care and quality of life. The relevance of this problem is reinforced by the fact that cancer treatments are increasingly provided in the ambulatory setting. Patients stay at home for most of the time and they have to take a more active role themselves in monitoring and communication about their symptoms. They should be able to recognize symptoms in a timely manner and they need to know what to do. The internet offers the possibility to monitor patient-related symptoms in real-time and the opportunity to enhance patients' self-management skills. Various eHealth applications exist to monitor patients' symptoms, or to enhance the mutual communication between patients and health care professionals. However, it is hard to implement such systems in daily practice. It is important to know patients' opinions about eHealth applications, what are the barriers and facilitators of patients regarding the use of eHealth to monitor their symptoms when they are at home.",

Aapro M. Biosimilars in oncology: much ado about nothing? Ann Oncol. 29 (1) Biosimilars in Supportive Care Biosimilars have been used in the supportive care of cancer patients since 2007, beginning with the introduction of the biosimilar haematopoietic growth factors epoetin and filgrastim and followed more recently by biosimilar infliximab, used for the treatment of immunotherapy-induced colitis. These products have been shown to improve access to safe and effective supportive care at a lower cost, delivering budgetary savings which can be invested in innovative new cancer treatments. In spite of this, there are differences in the uptake of biosimilars around the world due to challenges such as lack of product availability, funding arrangements or clinician acceptability. This session will reflect on the UK experience of biosimilar adoption in the supportive care setting, compared to the findings of a recent survey conducted by the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners (ISOPP) on biosimilar implementation practice worldwide. Current guidelines on the use of biosimilars Biosimilars present a necessary opportunity for physicians, patients, payers and healthcare systems. With the emergence of biosimilars worldwide, guidelines are much needed to ensure the proper usage of these group of drugs. There are many guidelines available at the moment, namely the European Medicines Agency (EMA) which has as overarching guidelines on biosimilars. These guidelines outline the quality, non-clinical and clinical data requirements specific to biosimilar drugs. The World Health Organisation (WHO) also has guidelines on biosimilars, which provide globally acceptable principles for licensing biotherapeutic products and can be adopted as a whole or partially by National Regulatory Agencies worldwide. The British Oncology Pharmacy Association (BOPA) has a position statement for the use of monoclonal antibodies. The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) also has a position paper for biosimilars. Many countries have biosimilar guidelines which includes the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia and many countries in Asia and South America. According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), once a biosimilar has been approved by the FDA, patients and health care providers can be assured of the safety and effectiveness of the biosimilar, just as they would for the reference product.",

A cancer diagnosis while attending school may disrupt schoolwork and alter the student's readiness for employment and for choosing an occupation. It also impacts first-time job seeking. Even when young adult survivors hold a job, their cancer diagnosis may affect continuation of work and further career development. Work is also an area in which healthcare providers cannot act as 'specialists.' Support for AYA survivors who want to work should be comprehensive and multi-level; various stakeholderssuch as family, school, workplace, and governmental administration-should work in co-operation, and healthcare providers need to act in co-operation with these stakeholders.

The techniques used to plan and deliver radiation therapy have evolved dramatically since the mid-1990s, benefiting from rapid parallel developments in radiologic imaging and computational capacity and algorithms. Modern radiation therapy is typically delivered based on a highly precise, volumetrically calculated, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plan. Head and neck cancer, because of the sensitive anatomic structures that are usually located in very close proximity to tumor targets, is a special case that demands exceptionally complex radiation planning and delivery. Excellent functional outcomes are a major goal in addition to cancer cure. The development of patient-reported outcomes and functional assessments capable of cataloguing the effects of radiation therapy more accurately are important to better understand the effects of treatment. Major national and international consortia have made concerted efforts to assess and reduce of the toxicity of head and neck cancer radiation therapy. Practical efforts have included standardization of dose prescriptions and target delineation guidelines across groups. There has also been substantial clinical trial development to support evolving approaches such as novel systemic therapies, novel sequencing of therapies, or personalization of therapeutic intensity based on validated biomarkers. Promising recent technical developments include planning based on positron-emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the increasingly sophisticated investigation of proton therapy and other particle therapies.",

Additionally, circadian disruption may contribute to increased symptom burden. Sleep-wake disruptions (e.g., insomnia), reduced quality of life, glucose dysregulation, lowered immunity, and cardiac symptoms are among many that are linked or associated with disrupted circadian rhythm in cancer patients.

Burnout is epidemic among pediatric oncology. The emotional impact of caring for children with cancer can be overwhelming for both their families as well as their medical professionals. Juggling the care of your ill patients with the needs of your own children can be challenging and exhausting. How do we recognize compassion fatigue and burnout in the carers of our patients, in our colleagues and in ourselves? For both informal carers' and professionals, burnout and fatigue have far-reaching impacts on the quality of patient care, physical health and the wellbeing of our families. How can we preserve true wellness for our patients, their loved ones, ourselves and our own families? How can we balance the demands of our career with the needs of our family?

Dr. Michael Kearney states: \"There is within medical and nursing education a growing body of opinion which challenges an educational approach that fosters the knowledge and skills of students, while ignoring their personal experience and attitudes as narrow and limited, resulting in patient care that may be efficient but is ultimately de-humanized and de-humanizing. At the core of this view is the proposal that there is a direct link between who we are as individuals and the quality of our work as professionals.\" What creative ways can we find to integrate our inner selves and our professional selves, so that we do not \"burn out?\" How do we maintain a sense of passion for our work and compassion for those we care for? As part of this panel I will discuss the idea of \"poetic medicine\" as a means to access our feelings and re-kindle our hope and purpose in our work. Soaring rates of burnout and emotional exhaustion reported by healthcare professionals have captured the attention of administrators, educators and leaders of physician groups. In this presentation we will review organizational and structural elements identified as major contributors, and focus on innovative approaches being implemented to mitigate professional stress.",

As part of a Cancer Care Ontario province wide strategy, tobacco screening and cessation programs for cancer survivors have been implemented across all major cancer centres in Ontario since 2014. During this process, we have identified multiple myths related to tobacco cessation interventions and identified professional perceptions related to tobacco cessation for cancer survivors. In this session we will review some of the specific challenges of the oncology setting including timing of discussions, achieving institutional support and motivation towards change among front-line staff, clinicians and policy makers. We also discuss about the opt-out approach that has been implemented by cancer centres to help encourage patients to take part in cessation programs being offered and the impact this strategy has had on tobacco screening and referral rates. Specific strategies that have helped with local implementation including using a multi-disciplinary approach will be reviewed during the session.

Background Continued smoking after a cancer diagnosis is associated with poorer outcomes.

Despite this, many patients (>65%) perceived tobacco as harmful on quality-of-life, fatigue and survival and these risk perceptions were associated with tobacco cessation after diagnosis. Most patients (>95%) felt tobacco should be assessed at the first visit, were comfortable with being assessed and felt it was important for healthcare providers to be aware of their tobacco use. Patients exposed SHS were less likely (aOR 2-8) to quit smoking after a cancer diagnosis; most patients who quit, did so during the peri-diagnosis period.

These treatments are associated with toxicities which stem from increased activity within T cell lineage similar to that observed in autoimmunity. These immune-related toxicities can affect virtually any organ system and are potentially fatal. The timing of the onset of the adverse events is dependent on the organ system affected and can be delayed significantly after initiation or completion of therapy. The critical first step in the emergency management of immune-related toxicities is their recognition. The increasing indications for, and usage of, checkpoint inhibitors means that more patients on these therapies will present to emergency settings. Determining if these patients have an immunerelated toxicity requires careful clinical workup and necessitates education of health care professionals working in acute care settings. Early recognition and intervention can reduce the duration and severity of the complications. This necessitates that consideration is given to the models of acute care utilised in the emergency management of patients on checkpoint inhibitors. Guidelines for the acute management of immune-related toxicities have been developed and published. The basics of treatment are to withhold the checkpoint inhibitor, supportive treatment of the organ system affected and potentially the use of immune modulating medications, such as corticosteroid therapy. This presentation will consider the emergency management of immune-related toxicities, the clinical workup of acute presentations in patients on checkpoint inhibitors and the challenges of ensuring safe care for these patients in various emergency oncology models. \\r\\r \\r\\r \\r\\r",

Bass 1 1 Hospital for Special Surgery/Weill Cornell Medicine, Rheumatology, New York, USA Rheumatological side effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (CI) occur in only 5-10% of treated patients but can be 1. refractory, requiring long-term immunosuppression (e.g. CI-associated arthritis), or 2. life-threatening (e.g. CI-associated myositis). Half of patients with CI-associated joint pain have a condition identical to rheumatoid arthritis (\"RA-phenotype\") with positive rheumatoid factor and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (CCP) in 60%, and a high prevalence of the RA-associated HLA-DRB1 \"shared epitope\". The remaining patients with CI-associated joint pain have a large-joint inflammatory arthritis (\u00b1 tenosynovitis), polymyalgia rheumatica, or arthralgia without arthritis. Early treatment of high-grade \"RA phenotype\" CIarthritis with TNF inhibitors can help to minimize long term exposure to high-dose corticosteroids. CI-associated myositis can take an aggressive course requiring treatment with high dose corticosteroids, IVIG and mycophenolate mofetil. Anti-striated muscle antibodies are sometimes found in these patients, but myositis-specific auto-antibodies are not usually present. Cancer patients who have an underlying rheumatic disease can be treated with CI. Half of them will experience a flare of their underlying disease, and a third will experience de novo immune related adverse events (IRAE), but their overall rate of IRAE is not increased. Anti-rheumatic drugs should be held at the time of CI-initiation in order to maximize cancer responses.",

Why? First there are no placebocontrolled trials which seems to be an unethical approach but in fact enrichment enrollment with randomized withdrawal trials (allowing for rescue) have been done for chronic pain with a SMD 0f -0.42 (p<0.0001) (NNT 6) 2 . Cancer pain trials suffer largely from imprecision due to small numbers of participants per trial and outcomes which may not have clinical relevance such as mean differences in pain severity, pain intensity reductions of 30 and 50%. The Cochrane Reviews use no more than mild pain at 14 days which has clinical relevance because of time frame. Metaanalysis often included < 10 trials, missing data was accounted for by either including completers only or by LOCF rather than BOCF which biases responses. Many trials have > 10% missing data. Non-statistical differences were interpreted as \"non-inferiority\" where the absences of statistical differences do not mean there are not differences. Despite low quality evidence, 95 % of patients should have no more than mild pain at 14 days with 1 out of 10 discontinuing their opioid for adverse effects 1 . This lecture will review the evidence for individual opioids and make recommendations regarding trial design. ",

Current concerns about the opioid epidemic are well-founded in the wider society but lessons from other patient populations cannot automatically be applied to cancer. Experiences in various cancer sub-populations, e.g. postoperative pain, cannot be applied to metastatic disease. Good documentation is essential to protect physicians from excess regulatory zeal. There is frequent confusion between the concepts of Opioid Dependency and Opioid Addiction. Pseudo-Addiction refers to ineffective pain management leading to drug-seeking behavior as a rational response to distress. Clinicians should know the criteria for Opioid Use Disorder and Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome. Opioid management in established addiction is often complicated by simultaneous alcohol, benzodiazepine or cannabinoid use/abuse. Opioids have significant gastrointestinal and neuropsychological effects which must be considered in addition to the pain. It is also important to remember that not all pain in cancer patients is due to the cancer. Buprenorphine, methadone, naloxone, naltrexone and lofexidine are important drugs in management. They are effective and safe in expert hands. Addiction as a clinical problem occurs only in a minority of cancer patients (family members can be more problematic).",

The majority of survivors are aged 70 years or over and the vast majority have coexisting illnesses. Unfortunately, current models of post-treatment care are suboptimal. Survivors report significant unmet needs, including for improved symptom management, and greater levels of information and support across physical, psychosocial and practical domains. A new approach to follow-up care is needed to better meet the needs of survivors while also dealing with the challenges of provider shortages and increasing healthcare costs. Models of post-treatment care should address the holistic healthcare needs of survivors through provision of optimal cancerspecific follow up, management of comorbid conditions, and general preventive health care. Over a decade ago, the Institute of Medicine made recommendations for improved survivorship care that include surveillance and prevention of recurrence, new cancers and late and long-term effects, as well as interventions for the various issues that cancer survivors may experience. Survivors should be provided with a treatment summary and a plan for follow up, and care should be coordinated between specialists and primary care providers to ensure that survivors' needs are met. Care needs to move from a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to one that is more personalised, better utilises primary care and other available services, and supports self-management. There is growing evidence that such models are feasible, can improve patient outcomes and reduce costs.",

Watts 1 1 Mercy Health, Osteoporosis and Bone Health Services, Cincinnati, USA Consequences of fractures due to osteoporosis may be self evident but are often underappreciated. Many fractures are painful. Most limit function of the area involved, temporarily in some cases, life-long in others. Affected patients may need help with activities of daily living (eating, dressing, continence/ toileting, transferring, and ambulation). Not so obvious are the psychosocial complications: anxiety (fear of falling, avoiding crowds), withdrawal from social activities (how long before the next pain medication), diminished self worth (feeling non-productive), anxiety and depression. These complications can lead to a cycle of deconditioning, solitude, and depression (and depression further increases the risk of fracture). It is important to recognize and try to deal with these issues when they are present. Some cancer treatments are known to increase bone loss and fracture risk (e.g., aromatase inhibitors, androgen deprivation therapy). Cancer does not protect against osteoporosis; even if treatment for cancer doesn't cause bone loss, cancer patients may already be at high risk of fracture. These psychosocial consequences of osteoporosis must add to the burden of cancer treatment and cancer survival. The good news: effective measures/countermeasures are available to prevent bone loss and reduce fracture risk. By preventing fractures, functional and psychosocial consequences can be avoided. ",

In particular, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a representative side effect, and control over it has an important role in the progress of drug therapy afterwards. Olanzapine, together with a marked antiemetic effect, could help smooth progress of cancer drug therapy. Discrepancies between the various antiemetic guidelines included the addition of dexamethasone to moderate risk antiemetic regimens, the prophylactic treatment of RINV in low risk categories, and the appropriate treatment for breakthrough emesis. The guidelines were in agreement that high risk RT regimens should be treated prophylactically with a serotonin receptor antagonist. For patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy and RT, all guidelines recommended that antiemetic treatment be prescribed according to the emetic risk associated with the patients' chemotherapy regimens. The most dissension between guidelines occurred in the low and moderate risk categories. Low and minimal risk recommendations were based on low level evidence and informal consensus. Conclusions RINV is a frequent and distressing side effect of RT. Further research is needed to establish effective antiemetic guidelines and ensure optimal treatment outcomes.",

Celiac plexus neurolysis is a procedure often performed to provide relief to patients suffering from pain related to upper abdominal cancer. However, various studies have reported conflicting results about its effect. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of celiac plexus neurolysis on upper abdominal cancer pain. Methods Medical records of patients who underwent celiac plexus neurolysis for upper abdominal cancer at the hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The change in pain among patients after the procedure was evaluated with the numeric rating scale (NRS), and the use of opioid analgesics before and after the procedure, as well as complications from the procedure were investigated. Results A total of 99 patients underwent celiac plexus neurolysis for abdominal cancer pain. The NRS scores at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-procedure were significantly reduced compared to before the procedure (p < 0.05). The post-procedural use of opioid analgesics was also significantly decreased (p < 0.05). Mild adverse events (moderate diarrhea and mild hypotension) were frequent (n = 28); no serious complications were reported and no procedure-related deaths were observed. Conclusions Celiac plexus neurolysis resulted in a decrease in pain and in the use of opioid analgesics in patients experiencing upper abdominal cancer pain, and serious complications after the procedure were rare. These results provide evidence that celiac plexus neurolysis may be useful in the treatment of abdominal cancer pain in a clinical setting.",

The assessment of breakthrough pain was conducted by surveying patients who use narcotic analgesics to control cancer pain. Clinical characteristics, assessment and management of cancer pain and breakthrough pain, physician's knowledge about breakthrough pain, and barrier questionnaire were assessed. Results 956 cancer patients participated in the study. Patients undergoing chemotherapy were 666 (69.67%). The prevalence of breakthrough pain among cancer patients was 73.33%.

We observed statistically and clinically significant improvement (means) for anxiety (-2.3\u00b11.5), drowsiness (-2.1\u00b12.2), depression (-2.1\u00b11.9), nausea (-2.0\u00b12.4), fatigue (-1.9\u00b11.5), pain (-1.8\u00b11.4), shortness of breath (-1.4\u00b12.2), appetite (-1.1\u00b11.7); and for all ESAS subscales (all p's<0.02). Highest clinical response rates were observed for anxiety (92%), depression (91%), and pain (89%). Conclusions A single, live, tailored music therapy intervention as part of an integrative oncology inpatient consultation service contributed to significant improvement in global, physical and psychosocial distress. A randomized controlled trial is justified. ",

Moreover, there is no support system or followup care for survivors. To address this issue there is the need for information, support and education to the general public.",

Methods Albino male mice (4 week old, n=16) were rendered lymphoma by intraperitoneally introducing DAUDI cells (1 million cells/animal, single-injection) . A batch of lymphoma animal group were supplemented orally with rose-anthocyanins (50mg/kg bw/d, daily, n=8) for all 30 days. A group of animals received only rose-anthocyanins (n=8). Animals were observed for body weight and pain symptoms for 30 days. Terminally the animals were euthanized, peritoneal zones were collected for histopathological studies while blood was assessed for cancer markers. Results Mice exposed to DAUDI cells demonstrated a slight but significant increase in the body weight gained. There were no lumps found on peritoneal tissue while neoplasmic blood vessels were apparent. New blood vessels with excessive branching are suggestive of carcinogenesis caused by the DAUDI cells. DAUDI treated mice receiving the roseanthocyanins showed remarkable recovery against angiogenesis while showing improved pain response. Blood markers for inflammatory response and different lymphocyte patterns were also ameliorated with rose-anthocyanins among DAUDI mice.",

Results A total of 1224 patients were included in this study. The PCA and EFA identified the same two symptom clusters before the start of RT: 1) pain, tiredness, nausea, drowsiness, appetite, and dyspnea; 2) depression, anxiety, and wellbeing ( Table 1 ). The HCA further split the symptoms into three clusters (Table 2) . Wellbeing, depression, and anxiety consistently clustered together. Among the ESAS scores collected during and after RT, each statistical method identified different symptom clusters. For the symptom clusters experienced during RT, the following symptoms were always in the same cluster: wellbeing, depression, and anxiety; nausea and appetite; drowsiness and dyspnea. Following RT, depression and anxiety consistently clustered together, with nausea and appetite in the other cluster.",

HFNC has been proposed as a palliative measure for managing breathlessness in patients near end of life who wish to forgo intubation. HFNC delivery in non-hospital settings is limited. Initiating HFNC may preclude patients from fulfilling wishes to die at home and may limit the use of hospice. Methods This is a retrospective chart review of all patients admitted to a large, urban academic medical center in 2016 who used HFNC. Results 286 patients with orders for HFNC were included. Patients were an average of 60.6 years old, >70% of patients were members of racial or ethnic minority groups, and 51.4% were male. Despite having a high risk of mortality (average age-adjusted Charleson Comorbidity Index = 5.8), only 34 (11.8%) had a DNR order during that admission and 47 (16.4%) received a palliative care consult. Length of stay was prolonged (mean = 23.2 days, median = 15.4 days). Hospital mortality rate was 23.4%. Less than half of patients (130,45.5%) were discharged home. Few were referred for hospice (10,3.5%). Conclusions Although many patients were able to discharge home after initiating HFNC in the hospital, hospital mortality was high, and few received hospice or palliative care services. The use of HFNC may delay or limit the receipt of hospice and palliative care services. This finding should be further investigated and barriers to provision of HFNC in the home should be addressed to provide optimal care for patients at end of life. ",

The Numerical rating scale (NRS) score for cough and dyspnea, before and after the intervention were noted. A need for an escalation or reduction in level of care was also noted Results The mean NRS score for dyspnea (n=84) reduced from 7.5 (4-9) (before procedure) to 2.5(2-6) after intervention. (p<0.01) The mean NRS score for Cough (n=68) also reduced from 6.5 (4-8) (before procedure) to 4 (3-7) after intervention (p<0.01).

Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) has bad prognosis compared to other subtypes. Patients often want to know how long they have left to live and it's the first question patients ask after diagnosis.

Methods A 3-day opioid education course on prescribing long-term opioids for CNMP was attended by 220 health professionals. The topics included opioid pharmacology; opioid prescribing techniques; risks and side effects of opioid therapy; and current recommendations of recent opioid guidelines.

Students experienced first-hand clinical exposure in class with guided, step-by-step teaching material to translate clinical knowledge into practice. Beside IVR, we also had case studies in paper format. We invited the students to conduct user feedback surveys to compare their learning experience on both paper and IVR.",

In short, technical problem was the major issue we encounteredas there was only one full set of IVR equipment with remote control in the classroom. Most of the students had to use their smartphone and provided headset to experience the IVR cases. Conclusions IVR in pharmacy education is still new in Hong Kong. It has potential to be developed into other therapeutic areas including supportive care in cancer management. However, proper guidance, hardware and software improvement, and clear instruction are required for in class deployment of IVR.",

Methods This paper discusses the need for inter-national information echange to enhance monitoring of palliative care education systems. Results A broad range of valiated indicators of palliative care education systems and policies is urgently needed to support the effective monitoring of palliative care educational programmes in sub Saharan Africa. However, palliative care education system diagnoses differ widely in their objectives, scope, methodology and use. Much could be done to addresss gaps and reduce overlap among diagnosic instruments. Sharing experienes between countries and promoting policy dialoque based on broadly comparable qualitative information on palliative care education systems, will facilitate effective decision making. While a global and / or regional framework for reviewing palliative care education systems and policies might be desirable, in practice a regional or sub regional approach is more feasible. Many regions have common palliative care education contexts and can structure reviews to better reflect their their shared values, objectives and challenges.",

Clinicians need to evaluate breast cancer patients with fatigue's social support. Anemia frequently occurs in patients undergoing chemotherapy; fatigue is a common symptom, and substantially impacts QoL. We evaluated the correlation between QoL and fatigue in cancer patients treated with biosimilar epoetin alfa (Sandoz) for CIA. Methods CIROCO was a non-interventional, prospective study conducted in France. Patients had solid tumours or haematological malignancies, \u22652 cycles of chemotherapy after inclusion and received biosimilar epoetin alfa for CIA. Data were collected on day of inclusion (T0) and after 2-3 (follow-up; T1) and 4-6 (end of follow-up; T2) chemotherapy cycles. Fatigue was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS, range 0-10), and QoL with the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Results 854 patients were included in the Full Analysis Set: solid tumors, n=678; hematological malignancies, n=176.

After addressing goals of care with her family, the decision was made to proceed with radical wide excision of the tumor with repair with a cervicofacial flap. Excisional biopsy showed moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma invasive to subcutis without any lymphovascular invasion.

To link the model to clinical practices, folinic acid (0.0005-50 \u03bcg/mL) was added in combination with MTX. To evaluate the effects of short-chain fatty acids in the organoid model, different concentrations of butyrate (0.25-2mM) were added for 96 hours. Results MTX (100-1000 ng/ml) treatment resulted in reduced cell metabolic activity and citrulline levels (p<0.001). However, recovery after 96 hours was only observed with a MTX dose of 100 ng/ml, showing that 100 ng/ml is the optimal concentration in this model. Folinic acid treatment was able to restore organoid function when applied simultaneously or/up to 24 hours after treatment.

The prevalence of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in cancer survivors is as high as 60%. CIPN is the most common and severe adverse drug reaction associated with neurotoxic chemotherapy. No pharmacologic interventions are available to prevent CIPN. A critical barrier to the development of efficacious interventions is the lack of understanding of the mechanisms underlying CIPN. Neuroinflammation (NI) is associated with development and maintenance of CIPN. In this pilot study, we evaluated for differences in perturbations in NI-related pathways between breast cancer survivors with and without PIPN. Methods GE in peripheral blood was assayed using RNA-seq. We evaluated for perturbations in NI-related pathways between survivors who received paclitaxel and did (n=25) and did not (n=25) develop PIPN.",

Median time from finishing chemotherapy to duloxetine initiation was 6 months. Fifty-seven (57%) patients discontinued duloxetine, due to intolerable side effects (37%) or lack of efficacy (20%). Most frequently reported adverse events were cognitive (26%), gastrointestinal (14%) and genitourinary (9%). Men more frequently discontinued duloxetine due to perception of lack of efficacy (35.7% vs 8.6% p=0.001).

The purpose of this 2-group, double-blind, randomized controlled trial is to test the feasibility, satisfaction, and preliminary efficacy of a computerized home-based cognitive training program compared to attention control in breast cancer survivors (BCS). Methods Methods: A total of 68 eligible BCS will be randomized to computerized cognitive training or attention control. A blinded and trained tester will perform data collection and neuropsychological testing at two time points: baseline prior to intervention (T1) and immediately after the 10-week cognitive training -program (+/-7 days) (T2). Feasibility and satisfaction will be assessed through objective indicators (study adherence, completion rate) and selfreport (facilitators, barriers, and perceived satisfaction) and cognitive performance will be assessed through objective neuropsychological tests. Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and a general linear mixed model (GLMM). Simple main effects analyses will be used to follow up statistically significant interactions.",

This coupling stimulates neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) activity. Increasing concentrations of NPY increases food intake and decreases energy expenditure, while AgRP acts as an antagonist to anorexigenic melanocortin receptors. As with ghrelin, anamorelin binds to the ghrelin receptor, leading to the downstream expression of NPY and AgRP, thus leading to appetite stimulation. Cannabis, particularly delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, acts on the CB1 cannabinoid receptor to stimulate appetite, partly through the modulation of ghrelin production. Ghrelin levels increase and Peptide YY (PYY) levels, an anorexigenic peptide released by gastrointestinal mucosa, decrease after smoking cannabis in HIV patients.

Emerging studies suggest that extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a key role in cell-to-cell signaling, genetic material exchange between cells, and contain heat shock proteins (HSPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). HSPs directly modulate immune responses and miRNAs regulate gene expression, immune cell differentiation, and proliferation. Thus, EVs may fill the gap in understanding the etiology of symptoms. To our knowledge, there have been no reviews on the role of EVs in symptoms. The purpose of this review is to investigate the association of EVs with symptoms.",

Introduction BRCA1 and BRCA2 aid in non-homologous DNA repair, and germline mutations in these two tumour-suppressor genes account for a majority of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. This often leads to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC). HBOC is commonly characterized by a family history of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and to a lesser extent, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and melanoma. De novo pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are rare. In the literature, to date, twelve BRCA1 (including the present) and six BRCA2 de novo pathogenic variants have been published (Table 1) .

Tobacco Use Screening rates became a performance metric to drive implementation and were reviewed quarterly with leadership. During 2014/15, just over 50% of cancer patients were screened for tobacco use. Efforts to improve performance included transitioning to the 3As (Ask, Advise, Act) model, monitoring \"Accepted a Referral\" rates as a performance metric, and use of an \"opt-out\" approach to referrals (where tobacco users are automatically referred unless they refuse).

A challenge for clinicians, consumers, and researchers is keeping up and ensuring that the best, most up-to-date evidence underpins diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and end-of-life care. Scoping reviews are a new, purpose-built approach for handling evidence from different sources, study designs, and perspectives. They can integrate knowledge from expert and consumer viewpoints with results from randomized controlled trials as well as qualitative research. Methods Different evidence synthesis methodologies have been developed over the years resulting in an expanding repertoire of approaches. One recent approach is the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The PRISMA-ScR was developed through a multi-stage process involving survey and Delphi methods and repeated consultation, debate, and testing with multi-disciplinary groups.",

Methods 196 breast (77%) and 59 gynecologic (23%) cancer patients and survivors were recruited in-clinic (14% declined). Participants completed questionnaires on SM usage (designed for this study), QOL (FACT-G), social support (Duke FSSQ), and distress . Results SM users (76%) were younger (mean=53, SD=12) than non-users (24%; mean=58, SD=12; p=.023). There was no difference for overall QOL, social support, or distress between users and nonusers. Reasons for use were \"for social support\" (35%), \"when I feel lonely\" (26%), and \"for coping\" (18%); followed by \"to gather health information\" (14%) and to \"share my cancer diagnosis\" (13.5%). Pearson correlations showed that patients more likely to use social media when feeling lonely had lower QOL (p<.001), less social support (p<.001), and more distress (p=.001). Those who reported using SM for coping also had lower QOL and less social support (all p-values<.05). Higher use of SM for social support was correlated with having less social support (p=.016).

OBJECTIVES: Primary objective: assess the feasibility of a NPW program for individuals with non-small cell lung (NSCLC), prostate, colorectal, and endometrial cancer. Secondary objective: determine the effects of NPW on physical function and healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL). Methods Eight-week multi-centred randomized controlled feasibility study: NPW (supervised and independent NPW sessions) or control (usual daily routine). The Thabane four-criterion framework (2010) assessed feasibility (Process, Resources, Management, Scientific) . Descriptive and nonparametric comparative statistics assessed effects of NPW over time and between groups. Results N=8 were recruited, mean age 67 years. The study was feasible with recommended modifications: 1) recruit participants at hospital cancer centres; 2) individualize NPW and integrate behavioural change techniques; 3) use pedometers or accelerometers to measure physical activity levels; 4) organize NPW NSCLC programs alongside programs for other chronic respiratory diseases. Compared to baseline, the NPW group had a significant improvement in the 30-s chair stand test (median 10.5 to 14.3, p<0.05) and decreased thigh circumference (median right thigh: 49.4 to 48.5cm; left thigh: 49.0 to 46.3cm, p<0.05) . There were no significant improvements between groups, though there was a trend toward improved physical activity and HRQoL Conclusions Examining the effects of NPW on individuals diagnosed with cancer is feasible with modifications, and may improve physical function.

Still controversial the reason why the acral site is the most frequent affected area. It is most frequently linked with capecitabine treatment, but a large number of other chemotherapeutic agents have been reported. In its pathogenesis, a fundamental role is played by a conspicuous overexpression of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) due to the toxic damage of basal keratinocytes, followed by an increased production of prostaglandins and free radicals, with maintenance of the inflammatory process.

Results Median age was 59 years (range 43-67 years). 89 (67%) patients had at least one cardiovascular risk factor. At baseline, IIEF-5 mean score was 19 (SD, 2.6). Patients with 2 and more IMDC risk factors (39%) had a lower IIEF-5 mean score (14; SD, 3.3). 99 (75%) patients reported a negative change in their sexual life since the start of the targeted therapy. 35 (27%) patients had no sexual activity. After the first treatment cycle/month IIEF-5 mean score reduced to 8 (SD, 1.9), which was statistically significant (P<0.001). The IIEF-5 scores were not associated with a type of anticancer treatment (P>0.05). Conclusions Prospective evaluation in a large cohort of patients with mRCC revealed mild ED (19/25) in the treatment-naive male population and severe ED (8/25) after the first cycle/month of the first-line therapy. Significant decrease in erectile function should be considered as a potential adverse event in male patients undergoing treatment of mRCC with targeted agents",

Yet, evidenced-based CIPN assessment and management guidelines/strategies are often poorly implemented into practice. The purpose of this analysis is to explore clinicians' CIPN assessment and management documentation patterns when providing care to patients receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy. Methods Data for this analysis originate from the usual care period (Period-I) of a two-period, pre/posttest study. Patients receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy for gastrointestinal or breast malignancies or multiple myeloma completed standardized CIPN surveys (e.g., Patient Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Numbness/Tingling items [PRO-CTCAE], 0-10 worst CIPN pain intensity) prior to three consecutive clinician appointments. At the third appointment, clinicians' documentation of CIPN assessment (e.g., numbness/tingling/pain) and management (e.g., chemotherapy dose modification, medicine) were abstracted from the medical record. Results Eighty-one patients and 45 clinicians were recruited. At the third appointment, 44/63 (69.8%) patients self-reported mild CIPN or worse (PRO-CTCAE numbness/tingling severity\u22651/4).

In previous research, pulmonary function and physical function in surgically treated MPM patients have not been evaluated in detail. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship pulmonary function and physical function of MPM patients following pleurectomy/decortication (P/D). Methods The subjects were 22 MPM patients (20 men) who completed P/D between December 2013 and March 2015. Pulmonary function assessed with forced expiratory vital capacity (FVC). Physical function were evaluated body weight (BW), knee extensor muscle strength, handgrip and 6-minutes walking distance (6MWD). The correlation between pulmonary function and physical function were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient.",

Methods The Cannabis Pilot Project (CPP) accepted McGill University Health Centre cancer patients already receiving supportive care but referred to the CPP because they did not achieve adequate symptom relief. This study examines the efficacy of cannabis treatment for pain relief using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) scale. An interdisciplinaryteam was established to systematically assess patients, prescribe and monitor cannabis treatments. Results Sixty-five patients have been enrolled (mean age 61 years; 52% female) in the CPP over seven months. The comparison between baseline, first (n=45) and second (n= 27) follow-up showed that 41% of patients vs 50% improved for worst pain (BPI 5.56 vs 4.39 vs 3.76, p-value 0.030), 41% vs 59% for average pain (BPI 3.93 vs 3.26 vs 2.72), 46% vs 45% for interference pain (BPI 4.05 vs 2.19 vs 2.80).

Our phase I clinical trial proved that IVC simultaneously with modulated electrohyperthermia (mEHT) were safe for non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Methods A randomised phase II controlled trial was performed to compare supportive care with and without IVC + mEHT concomitant treatment (In the active arm: patients were allocated into 1 g/kg d, 1.2 g/kg d, 1.5 g/kg d dosage groups simultaneously with mEHT, three times a week for 25 treatments in total) on quality of life(QOL), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in advanced Chinese NSCLC patients. Subsequently, 97 patients were analysed at the data cut-off (17th July, 2018).ResultsAfter a median follow up of 10 months, both the PFS and OS were significantly improved by IVC + mEHT compared to control (PFS: 3 month vs. 2 months, P<0.05; OS: 12 months vs. 8 months, P<0.05). The average scores for the functioning scales increased continuously, so that the QoL improved in the active arm despite the advanced stage of the disease(P<0.05). Both interleukin-6 and c-reactive protein were significantly decrease after treatments in active arm in comparison with control arm (P<0.05). Conclusions IVC + mEHT treatment significantly improves QoL, prolongs PFS and OS, and moderates cancer-related inflammation, and so is a feasible treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC. This trial is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT02655913).eP591 PATIENTS' EXERCISE ABILITIES AND PREFERENCES IN THE COMMUNITY PALLIATIVE CARE SETTING IntroductionThere is limited information about palliative care patients' preferences for exercise despite its known benefits. We aim to describe the exercise abilities and preferences of patients with the ultimate aim to develop an exercise program. Methods A convenience sample of community patients from Sacred Heart Health Service, Sydney, was approached to complete a cross-sectional paper or electronic survey. The following information was collected: demographics, diagnosis, current physical activity and their preferences include types of activity and setting. Patients were approached either in the clinic or at home.ResultsBetween May 2017-April 2018, 44 (17 Male: 27 Female) completed questionnaires was collected. The patient's median age was 71 years. The majority (84%) of patients had cancer as their main disease. Most patients (77%) were seen in the outpatient clinic. Most patients (59%) reported exercising at least once a week with 23% patients reporting that they exercise everyday. Of those who exercised, most people (39%) exercised between 15-29 minutes each session. Walking was the most common (66%) type of exercise patients were currently undertaking. Most patients (73%) preferred to exercise alone, with 41% of patients preferring to exercise unsupervised. About half of them (53%) would prefer to exercise at home. The top three barriers to exercise were related tiredness (57%), pain (55%), and dysnpoea (37%).ConclusionsPalliative care patients are able and interested in participating in physical activity. In this study, patients are interested in exercising alone and at home. Adequate symptom control may increase patients' interest and abilities to exercise.eP592 EXERCISE IN CANCER SURVIVORS CENTER FOR INTEGRATED REHABILITATION OF CANCER PATIENTS (CIRE) ILLUMINATES THE ROLE THAT EXERCISE AND SUPPORTIVE CARE CAN PLAY FOR CANCER SURVIVORS L.

We aimed to compare disease-specific functional deficits and symptoms of colon (CC) and rectal cancer (RC) survivors 5-16 years post-diagnosis, stratified by age at diagnosis and by gender.MethodsWe used cross-sectional data from the population-based CAncEr Survivorship -A multi-Regional (CAESAR) study in collaboration with five population-based German cancer registries. Respondents completed the disease-specific European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life colorectal cancer module (EORTC QLQ-CR29). Age at diagnosis was categorized as <50, 50-59, 60-69, and \u226570 years. Least square mean HRQOL scores, derived from linear regression, were adjusted for demographic and clinical variables, where appropriate.ResultsThe sample comprised 697 CC and 479 RC survivors. In general, CC and RC survivors diagnosed <50 years of age reported lower functioning and higher symptom burden when compared with survivors diagnosed at an older age. When stratified by gender, female CC survivors tended to report more concerns with hair loss but less sexual problems when compared with male CC survivors of same age. Female RC survivors in all age groups tended to report lower levels of sexual interest than male RC survivors of same age.ConclusionsOur results suggest that supportive care for CRC survivors to improve their self-management of symptoms should be adapted according to cancer type, age at diagnosis, and gender.eP594 ACUTE INPATIENT REHABILITATION OUTCOMES OF CANCER PATIENTS WITH LEPTOMENINGEAL DISEASE J.

However, little is known about depression in (very) long-term survivors. Study objectives were to compare the prevalence of depressive symptoms (1) in BC survivors vs. female general population controls,(2)  in disease-free survivors vs. survivors with progression,(3)  to test for determinants of depression in BC survivors. Methods 3045 BC survivors (5-16 years post-diagnosis, mean age 65 years), and 1005 cancer-free controls (mean age 59 years) were recruited in German multi-regional population-based studies. Depression was assessed via Geriatric Depression Scale, short form (GDS-15). Prevalence differences between subgroups were assessed via multiple regression, controlling for age and education. Proportional odds logistic regression was used to assess determinants of depression in BC survivors. Results A GDS-15 score suggestive of mild or severe depression (cut-off: \u22655) was found in 31.3% of BC survivors and in 25.0% of cancer-free controls (p=0.0002), a score suggestive of severe depression (cut-off: >10) in 5.5% of BC survivors and 4.3% of controls (p=0.1780). At age 30-49 and 70-79 years, prevalence of mild/severe depression was significantly higher in BC survivors than controls. BC survivors with progression showed significantly higher prevalence of mild/severe depression than disease-free survivors and controls. Age, education, progression, and partnership were significant predictors of depression in BC survivors. Conclusions Long-term BC survivors report slightly but significantly higher depression prevalence than controls, which can be explained by disease progression. Clinicians should refer survivors to psychological care when needed, especially in the case of a progression.eP599 T R A N S L AT I O N O F A S T R E S S M A N A G E M E N T INTERVENTION FOR RURAL SPANISH-SPEAKING LATINA BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: THE NUEVO AMANECER-RURAL TRIAL IntroductionWe describe the process of adapting and testing a stress management program, Nuevo Amanecer-Rural, for rural Spanish-speaking Latina breast cancer survivors, including methods for conducting the RCT (study design, measures, baseline characteristics) in rural communities.MethodsWe used formative research and applied a novel translation model to engage community members in the adaptation of the original Nuevo Amanecer program and design of the study for rural settings. We tracked recruitment and assessed baseline demographics and outcomes via interviewer-administered surveys.ResultsBased on community members' input, program adaptations included: simplifying language, adding visuals, developing stress management videos, and expanding from 8 to 10 sessions to increase skills practice and healthy lifestyles information. We trained community recruiters to enroll, collect biospecimens, and randomize women to intervention or wait-list control groups. We trained breast cancer survivors to deliver the 10-week in-person Nuevo Amanecer-Rural program. Of 231 women approached, 24% refused, 10% were ineligible, and 66% were randomized (76 to program, 77 to control). Participants' mean age was 54.8 years (range 28-88); 81% had < high school education; and 48% reported financial hardship in the past year. Baseline FACT-B mean scores were: Conclusions Using a translational model designed specifically for implementation of community-based behavioral trials to reduce disparities enhanced congruence with community contexts and recruitment and retention.eP600 SUPPORTIVE CARE PRIORITIES OF LOW-INCOME LATINA BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS IN LOS ANGELES A. Sleight 1 , F. Clark 2 , C. Vigen 2 , H. Macdonald 3 , K. Lyons 4 Introduction Low-income Latina breast cancer survivors are disproportionately at risk for poor health outcomes. Supportive care services can reduce health disparities and increase quality of life. However, little is known about the supportive care needs of this population. This study investigated the supportive care needs of a sample of lowincome Latina breast cancer survivors.Methods 99 Spanish-speaking breast cancer survivors who self-identified as Latina and reported an income below the U.S. Census Bureau lowincome threshold were recruited from the oncology clinic of a major public safety net hospital. Eligible participants completed the Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS-SF34) and a demographic questionnaire. Results 92% of respondents had unmet needs. The majority of frequentlyreported unmet needs involved 1) access to and delivery of healthrelated information, and 2) physical function. These findings appear to contrast with those of other studies of supportive care needs in heterogeneous cancer survivors, most of which indicate describe a high prevalence of psychological concerns as most urgent.ConclusionsParticipants espoused information-related needs with a higher frequency than many other samples of cancer survivors. This study population may also require a particularly high level of assistance with overcoming participation restrictions. Further research is needed to understand these discrepancies and to address unmet needs across all domains.eP601 MENOS4 TRIAL: TRAINING NURSES TO DELIVER CBT FOR MENOPAUSAL HOT FLUSHES AFTER BREAST CANCER IS EFFECTIVE FOR HOT FLUSHES AND ENHANCING QUALITY OF LIFE D.

It is known that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is effective for the alleviation of hot flushes. Breast care nurses (BCNs) are well placed to deliver this intervention, but it is not known whether they will be able to do this effectively within the NHS setting. This study assessed whether BCNs can be trained to effectively deliver a CBT intervention to alleviate HFNS in women with breast cancer. Methods Multi-centre phase III RCT in UK women experiencing troublesome HFNS after breast cancer, comparing 6-session group CBT versus treatment-as-usual (TAU). Nurses were trained in a two-day workshop with manual and materials provided. The primary outcome was the HFNS problem rating scale (max 10) at 26-weeks. Secondary outcomes included HF incidence, PSQI (sleep), PHQ-9 (depression) and GAD-7(anxiety). Results 127 women completed the study (61 CBT, 66 TAU): mean age 54yrs, 96% white British. At 26-weeks mean HFNS dropped by 3.0 in CBT and by 0.8 in TAU (mixed model adjusted difference [95% CI,p]: -1.",

Sano 3 , H. Hohri 3 , M. Liu 2IntroductionAsian/Asian American breast cancer survivors report poorer psychological well-being compared with Whites. Little is known about whether this disparity begins during treatment or in survivorship. This study examines distress, emotion regulation, and quality of life (QOL) in newly diagnosed Non-Hispanic, Asian/Asian American breast cancer patients compared to Non-Hispanic, Whites. Methods From a large, prospective study of women with Stage 0-III breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, we examined data from 119 selfidentified White (n = 87) or Asian/Asian-American (n = 32) women. Participants completed distress (CAD), emotion regulation (DERS), and cancer-related quality of life (EORTC QLQ-30) questionnaires.ResultsConsistent with literature on breast cancer survivors, significant correlations were found between more distress symptoms, greater difficulties in emotional regulation, and lower QOL among all patients undergoing chemotherapy. Moreover, Asian/Asian American patients experienced lower overall QOL (t(117) = 2.50, p = .014), more difficulties in regulating their emotions (t(117) = -3.03, p = .003), and higher distress (t(117) = -2.13, p = .035) compared to Whites. Asian/Asian Americans (Mean = 46.25, SD = 8.62) were younger than Whites (Mean = 51.32, SD = 11.48); t(117) = 2.27, p = .025. However, age was not correlated with any of the measures evaluated.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that more distress, greater difficulties in emotional regulation, and worse QOL occur during chemotherapy, and are more prominent in Asian/Asian American breast cancer patients. Further research should replicate the findings in a larger sample and discern factors explaining these reported differences in psychosocial distress in Asian/ Asian Americans compared to Whites.eP605 S U RV I VO R S H I P I N T H E C O M M U N I T Y S E T T I N G : DEVELOPING A MODEL FOR CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENTD.K.

Yang 1 Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Rehabilitation Medicine, Seongnamsi, Republic of KoreaIntroductionTo examine the impact of an individually inpatient rehabilitation on functional improvement among patients with diagnosed advanced cancer Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of newly diagnosed patients with advanced cancer between 2012 and 2017. Total 3832 data for newly diagnosed patients with advanced cancer were examined; of these patients, 331 underwent inpatient rehabilitation and 3501 did not undergo inpatient rehabilitation. At baseline and after 2 weeks Overall functional improvement were evaluated by Functional ambulation category (FAC). Type of cancer, site of metastasis, age, sex, dosage of intervention, baseline functional level were collected from medical records and adjusted on the ANCOVA analysis. Results A total of 331 patients (8.6%) who underwent inpatient rehabilitation improved in functional status from admission to discharge, with the highest gain observed in mobility (FAC; 2.09 \u00b1 1.87 vs 2.37 \u00b1 1.87, p<0.001). After adjusting the covariates, we found statistical functional improvement (R2=0.904, p<0.001). Among the patients who underwent inpatient rehabilitation, better baseline FAC (F value = 3240.2; p<.001) and more days of intervention (F value = 7.7; p=0.006) were significantly associated with greater functional improvement.ConclusionsPatients who undergo inpatient rehabilitation demonstrate significant functional improvements, primarily in the mobility domain.",

M\u00f8ller 3 1 Copenhagen University Hospital-Rigshospitalet, UCSF University Hospitals Center for Health Research and Center for Integrated Rehabilitation of Cancer patients CIRE, Copenhagen, DenmarkIntroductionFew exercise studies have measured the symptom burden of pre-diagnosed sedentary colorectal cancer patients. Research on this high-risk population is needed to clarify whether pedometer interventions might have a positive effect on sustainable change of behavioral lifestyle and may reduce the patients' symptoms during treatment. The objective was to examine the impact of two 12-weeks instructed pedometer interventions (low to moderate intensity versus progressive intensity) on symptom burden in sedentary patients with colorectal cancer during adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods Colorectal cancer patients receiving chemotherapy screened for selfreported physical activity level below national guidelines (< 150 min/ week moderate physical activity, and at least 20 minutes of strenuous physical activity 2/weekly) were randomized to: a) 12 weeks homebased low intensity pedometer intervention + counseling; b) 6 weeks pedometer intervention with interval walk + 6 weeks hospital-based intervention + counseling. The counseling included motivational elements, exploration of barriers, and symptom management. The patients completed The MD Andersen symptom Inventory (13-item symptom assessment) and EORTC QLQ-CIPN2044 (20-item symptom assessment) questionnaire weekly during the 12-week intervention.ResultsPatient cases (n=20) will be presented focusing on: Pedometer adherence rate (90%), daily pedometer data over 12 weeks (average steps >6000), DXA scan (increase muscle mass 1 kg, decrease fat 2%), physical activity level and symptom burden (prevalence, level, clusters) e.g. peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, pain, disturbed sleep and remembering.ConclusionsPreliminary results from both interventions indicate that the patients' symptom burden does not influence the adherence rate, despite challenges to recruit patients.eP619 SAFETY AND FEASIBILITY OF EXTENDING INTERVAL FLUSHING EVERY 3 MONTHS FOR MAINTENANCE OF CHEMOPORT IN COLORECTAL CANCER PATIENTS AFTER COMPLETION OF CURATIVE INTENDED TREATMENTS S.B. Oh 1 , K. Park 1 , J.J. Kim 1 , S.Y. Oh 1 Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine, Yangsan, Republic of KoreaIntroductionColorectal cancer (CRC) patients treated with curative surgery undergo 5-FU based chemotherapy using chemoport (CP) in case of high-risk of recurrence. The manufacturer recommends monthly flushing for maintain CP, however the time interval lacks scientific evidence. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the extended maintenance intervals is safe and feasible. Methods A retrospective cohort was conducted in CRC patients who underwent curative intended surgery and perioperative chemotherapy using CP between 2010 and 2017. Patient were enrolled if CP was maintained at least 6 months with 3-month interval flushing using heparin, while patient who were recurred within 1 month, removed CP within 6 months without definitive causes, or violation of flushing interval were excluded. The primary end points were the functional CP maintenance rate. Results A total of 214 CRC patients underwent curative intended treatments. Among them, 6 patients (early recurrence within 1 month) and 54 patients (violation of flushing interval) were excluded, finally 154 patients were analyzed. Mean flushing interval was 98.4 days (95% CI, 96.2 -100.6; range, 60-120). At the Dec 2018, 35 patients kept the CP, 92 were planned removal, and 24 were reused the CP, while two patients had to unexpectedly remove due to CP site infection and pain. Thus, the functional CP maintenance rate was 98.7% (152/154).ConclusionsOur study demonstrated that 3-month interval flushing is safe and feasible in CRC patients. Extended time interval up to 3 months might be considered because it is compatible with CRC surveillance visit schedules and convenient for patients.eP620 ROLE OF GROUP THERAPY IN IMPROVING PERCEIVED BENEFITS AND MOTIVATION TO EXERCISE AMONG ADULTS UNDERGOING CANCER THERAPIES D.P.

Bloomberg Faculty of Nursing, Toronto, CanadaIntroduction Substantial evidence describing cancer survivors' unmet physical, psychological and social needs has prompted growing attention to the delivery of supportive care in survivorship. Surveillance, follow-up, symptom management, and self-management support are significant components of survivorship care that may overcome unmet needs and promote survivors' well-being. However, a variety of factors including access, navigation, continuity of information, and the structure of interventions, may influence the uptake of care by cancer survivors, thereby limiting the potential positive impact of these services. In this study, we critically examine how survivors' preferences for accessing supportive care are reflected in clinical practice guidelines and evidence informing survivorship care. Methods This analysis draws on an environmental scan of clinical practice guidelines, a review of evidence regarding survivors' preferences for accessing supportive care after treatment, and case exemplars from our in-depth interviews with survivors of hematological and colorectal cancers.ResultsBased on a qualitative analysis, we identify strengths and tensions with respect to how survivors' preferences are integrated in the design of survivorship care. Major themes from the environmental scan and literature review focus on the location of the services, the involvement of various health care providers, the role of peer support, and the use of technology. These themes and their implications for survivors' quality of life are further highlighted through the case exemplars.ConclusionsConsidering survivors' preferences in the design of survivorship care is essential to ensure responsiveness to their needs. Practice, research, and policy recommendations for ensuring the patient-focused design of survivorship care will be proposed.eP622 REPORTS OF ASSISTANCE WITH ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING: ADVANCED CANCER PATIENT AND SPOUSE CAREGIVER CONCORDANCE A. Otto 1 , D. Ketcher 1 , M. Reblin 1 Moffitt Cancer Center, Health Outcomes & Behavior, Tampa, USAIntroductionLittle research exists on patient-proxy (dis)agreement about functional status/activities of daily living (ADLs) in cancer populations. Most existing work focuses on dementia patients or older adults, or on proxies other than family caregivers (e.g., medical providers). The goal of this study was to describe patient-caregiver concordance of reported ADLs and instrumental IADLs (IADLs) in the context of advanced cancer. Methods Participants were 88 patients with stage III/IV GI/thoracic cancer and their spouse-caregivers. Participants completed questionnaires assessing patient independence/caregiver assistance to patients (yes/no) in 8 ADLs and 7 IADLs, relationship satisfaction, and caregiver burden. ResultsTable 1displays participant demographics. Patient and caregiver reports of ADL assistance were positively correlated, but not all IADL reports were correlated (Table 2). Caregivers reported that patients needed assistance in significantly more activities than the number reported by patients (p=.042). On average, dyads disagreed more about IADLs (24.2%, SD=20.7) than ADLs (9.5%, SD=13.1). Older patient age was associated with greater ADL disagreement (B=.008, p=.017). Greater caregiver burden (B=-.011, p=.022) and greater patient relationship satisfaction (B=-.009, p=.028) were associated with lower disagreement about activities.",

Conclusions Memory, physical and mental health side effects were the most commonly reported unmet needs amongst a group of diverse and underserved respondents. Access to treatment education, complementary care and access to support group were top three services/ information requested. Our findings have important implications for optimizing survivorship care programs/survivorship care interventions for underserved patients.eP628 EFFECTS OF A HOME-BASED EXERCISE PROGRAM ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND MUSCULAR STRENGTH IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER IntroductionCancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a persistent tiredness and a daily lack of energy commonly experienced in patients with breast cancer (BC). Due to CRF, BC patients have reduced ability to perform daily activities, become less active, and ultimately lose muscular strength. Exercise increases muscular strength and may alleviate CRF. This study assessed effects of exercise on CRF and muscular strength in BC patients.MethodsNinety BC patients (55.5\u00b19.6 years, 79% white, 48% and 46% under radiation or hormone therapy) were randomized into a 6-week Exercise for Cancer Patients (EXCAP) program or standard care (Control). EXCAP is a home-based exercise program combining aerobic walking and resistance band training. The Brief Fatigue Inventory was used to assess overall CRF and the interference of CRF with daily activities and a 7-10 repetition maximum chest press and leg extension strength test was performed to assess muscular strength at pre-and post-intervention.ResultsThe EXCAP group significantly improved overall (-0.9\u00b10.3, p=0.01) and interference of CRF(-1.1\u00b10.3, p<0.01) from pre-to post-intervention while the Control group did not. The EXCAP group had significantly greater improvements in overall(-1.3\u00b10.4, p<0.01) and interference of CRF(-1.3\u00b10.4, p<0.01) than the Control group. The EXCAP group also significantly increased upper-(3.9\u00b11.4, p<0.01) and lower-body strength (6.4\u00b11.3, p<0.01) from pre-to post-intervention while the control group did not. The EXCAP group had significantly greater increase in lowerbody strength than the Control group (4.5\u00b11.7, p=0.01).ConclusionsExercise combining aerobic walking and resistance band training helped alleviate CRF and increase muscular strength in BC patients.",

Campbell 1 , S. Belcher 2 , Y.J. Lee 3 , M. Roberge 3 , T. Thomas 4 , H.University of Pittsburgh Schools of Nursing and Health/Rehab Sciences, Acute/Tertiary Care and Occupational Therapy, Allison Park, USAIntroductionThe prevalence of social role disability, or SRD (e.g. difficulty participating in employment, social relationships) among cancer survivors is not known. In this analysis we 1) identify the prevalence of SRD and 2) identify factors associated with SRD among a sample of U.S. adult cancer survivors. Methods Secondary analysis of 2010 cross-sectional LIVESTRONG survey data. Guided by the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, six SRD domains (accessing the community, interpersonal relationships, sexual relationships, school, employment) were constructed from relevant survey items. We calculated associations among sociodemographic, clinical, and treatment-related symptoms using logistic regression, with presence of SRD in any domain as the dependent variable.ResultsRespondents (N = 4,286) were aged 18 to 94 years (mean/SD 49.06/14.38) and predominantly white (85.8%). Breast cancer (26.8%) was the most prevalent cancer type, followed by hematologic malignancies (13.4%). Median time since diagnosis was 4 years. Half the sample (50.4%) endorsed SRD in one or more domains. The most frequently endorsed domain was sexual relationships (29%), followed by accessing the community (25.7%), employment (17.9%), and interpersonal relationships (8.1%). Predictors of SRD included: more recent diagnosis (p < .05); breast, colorectal, prostate, or gynecologic cancer (p <.01); history of chemotherapy or radiation treatments (p<.01); cognitive complaints, mood disturbances, sleep problems, fatigue, pain, dizziness, and personal appearance concerns (all p<.001).ConclusionsMany cancer survivors experience cancer-related SRD. Cognitive and affective symptoms, pain, fatigue, sleep problems, dizziness, and personal appearance concerns are strong predictors of SRD and present actionable intervention targets for survivorship care.eP632 P E R C E I V E D N E E D S O F Y O U N G A D U LT C A N C E R SURVIVORSY.H.

Young adult cancer patients are 185 ages under 39 years. Data were analyzed using Pearson's chi-square or ANOVA and multivariate logistic regression analysis.ResultsIn every types of perceived needs, young adult cancer patients are higher demands than the older counterparts. In multivariable analyses young adult cancer patients reported a significantly higher level of overall perceived needs to their older counterparts. (OR 2.85, P=0.00, 95% CI 1.91-4.24) Conclusions Young adult cancer patients demonstrated the high demand for perceived needs from overall needs to informational, emotional, about hospital and doctor, physical, familal, spiritual and social needs. Likely NCCN guideline for Adolescents and Young adult cancer patients, young cancer patients' needs could be specifically targeted for management and interventions in Korea.eP633 BARRIERS TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN CANCER PATIENTS.A. Ng 1 , M. Vidal 1 , E. Bruera 1 1 UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Palliative Rehabilitation and Integrative Medicine, Houston, USAIntroductionThe American College of Sports Medicine exercise guidelines for cancer survivors encourage a combination of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity and two to three weekly sessions of strength training. Barriers to these guidelines exists for the majority of the population while cancer survivors face more symptoms of fatigue and side effects from treatments. Methods After obtaining IRB approval, 200 patients were enrolled in the outpatient supportive care and rehabilitation clinic. Patients were asked to complete surveys reporting their physical activity using the Stanford Patient Education Research Center Exercise Behaviors Survey, their barriers to physical activity with a barrier scale, and their symptom assessment using the ESAS-FS.ResultsIn all patients, those who adhered to the physical activity guideline of >150 minutes had less barriers to physical activity, 2.4 versus 4.2 barriers, respectively (p<0.0001). Females were less likely to adhere to recommended guideline of 150 minutes a week of physical activity (p=0.03).",

Cardiovascular diseases(CVD) are the leading causes of death in Korea and globally. In addition to lowering the risk of CVD, the use of statin led to an overall reduction in cancer mortality in recent observational studies. We investigated the current dyslipidemia management status in CS with reference to new guidelines.MethodsThe study is a cross-sectional analysis of 1,460 CS aged from 40 to 75 years who participated in Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys(KNHANES) from 2007 to 2016. The dyslipidemia management status among CS according to new American College of cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines and Korean Coronary Heart Disease risk score (KRS) guidelines was assessed.ResultsThe rate of treatment for dyslipidemia was 8.5% for males, 13.8% for females, and 11.9% overall. Among those CS who were not receiving treatment for dyslipidemia, 59.6% of males, 34.2% of females, and 43.9% of total CS would have been eligible for statin therapy under the new ACC/AHA and KRS guidelines.

Its prevention could be done through vaccination against HPV and and treatment of precancerous lesions detected through visual inspections of the cervix, an alternative screening approach suitable for low income countries. We estimated the prevalence of these lesions in a less deserved area of the country. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey targeting women aged 23-50 years within Bouss\u00e9 health district area between June and July 2014. Trained data capturers collected information regarding their knowledge, attitude and practice toward cervical cancer in 5 settings of Bouss\u00e9 health district (Bouss\u00e9, Laye, Niou, Toeghin and Sourgoubila). Midwives backed by a gynecologist were in charge of screening for cervical cancer and to treat positive cases by Loup electrosurgical procedures (LEEP).ResultsOverall 418 women have been screened. Half of them has never heard about cervical cancer. About one third of them knew at least of risk factor of CC and at least one preventive measure. Nine percent of them has already been screened for CC. Overall 5% of the women were VIA/ VILI positive and all of them accepted to be treated by LEEP.ConclusionsWomen' knowledge about CC in Bouss\u00e9 health district was poor, with a limited practice of screening. It s necessary for decision makers to strengthen sensitization on CC and to provide screening at an affordable cost in rural areas.eP642 OVERCOMING LIMITATIONS OF PHYSICAL, SOCIAL, AND SEXUAL FUNCTION ON EXERCISE AMONG MEN WITH PROSTATE CANCER: A META-ANALYSIS Y.Y.
