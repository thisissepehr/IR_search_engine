This figure suggests that effective disease control procedures were employed by the adoption centres, as infectious disease (excluding those caused by retroviroses) was reported to be the cause of death of 6.2% (16/259) cats registered with 15 French veterinary practices . The figures are, therefore, encouraging as the potential for infectious disease spread will have been much greater for the adoption centre cats in our study than for the population of domestic cats in Lacheretz et al's study. However, it is possible that a higher mortality rate might have been reported if the study had included a 12-month data collection period rather than a 6-month period (Januarye June), as more kittens with an associated increased risk of mortality, would have been likely to have been included in the dataset.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 205, "end": 214, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 341, "end": 349, "text": "(Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The age of the cat at the time of admission was significantly associated with the risk of mortality.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Compared with the reference category of cats aged 0e7 weeks, cats aged over 7 years were nearly five times more likely to die whilst at the adoption centre. In contrast, cats between 8 weeks and 1 year of age were nearly seven times less likely to die and cats aged more than 1 year and less than or equal to 3 years old were nearly four times less likely to die than cats aged 0e7 weeks of age. These findings were as anticipated, as they reflect the increased risks associated with old age and previously identified risks associated with birth and the neonatal period (Scott and Peltz 1978 , Lawler and Monti 1984 , Sparkes et al 2006 . Excluding kittens that died before reaching 6 weeks of age, the approximate median age of cats that died naturally was 3 years and 3 months compared with a median age of 8 years and 1 month for cats that had been euthanased. These figures are likely to reflect veterinarians being more likely to recommend euthanasia for older cats in poor health compared with younger cats in poor health. Indeed, further examination of the data revealed that the median age of cats that were euthanased following admission to the adoption centres in poor heath was 8 years compared to a median of 1 year for cats that were not euthanased following their admission in poor health. Cats admitted to the rescue centres unneutered were nearly three times more likely to die whilst in the care of the adoption centre (AC) than cats that were neutered at the time of admission. The multivariable model (Table 3) included the variable of age at admission; therefore, the risk associated with the neutered status of the cat is independent of the age of the cat. Although a link between neutered status and FIV is well recognised, cats that had tested positive for FIV had been removed from the dataset. Euthanasia of FIV-positive cats thus does not explain the association between neutered status and mortality observed in this dataset (based on cats that had either tested negative for FIV or had not been tested for FIV). The reason for the association between neutered status and the risk of mortality is thus unclear; however, a link between neutered status and other infectious diseases may exist. Further examination of the data provided some support for this hypothesis as the neutered status of the cat was significantly (P < 0.001) associated with the cause of death (infectious disease excluding FIV/non-infectious disease), with unneutered cats accounting for 86.1% (31/36) and 54.2% (110/203) of cats that had been reported to have died as a result of infectious diseases (other than FIV) and non-infectious diseases, respectively (data not shown). Unneutered cats may also be more likely than neutered cats to roam and thus be at an increased risk from poisoning or trauma-related injuries resulting from road traffic accidents; however, no cases of poisoning and few trauma-related (n \u00bc 8) deaths were recorded in this study. In contrast, road accidents and poisoning were reported by Moreau et al (2002) to be the most common causes of accidental deaths in cats, accounting for 41% and 40% of cases, respectively. Cats that were born at an adoption centre were three-and-a-half times more likely to die whilst in the centre's care than cats that were previously stray, feral or had been relinquished by an owner. This association emphasises the high risk associated with birth and the early neonatal period, particularly as the age of the cat at the time of admission to CP and the length of time that the cat spent in CP have already been adjusted for by the multivariable model, thus controlling for potential confounding by age.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 570, "end": 591, "text": "(Scott and Peltz 1978", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 592, "end": 615, "text": ", Lawler and Monti 1984", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 616, "end": 636, "text": ", Sparkes et al 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3015, "end": 3034, "text": "Moreau et al (2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1520, "end": 1529, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The number of days that the cat had been housed at the adoption centre was significantly (P < 0.001) associated with the risk of mortality. The highest risk of mortality was associated with cats that had been housed by CP for 3 days or less. However, the association between time at the adoption centre and the risk of mortality was independent of variables included in the multivariable model, including the age of the cat, the birth location (at CP or elsewhere) and the health of the cat at the time of admission. In addition, FIV-positive and FeLV-positive cats that were euthanased during the first few days following admission to an adoption centre were removed from the dataset prior to multivariable analysis, thus not explaining the observed association between time spent at CP and the risk of mortality. Therefore, other factors not examined in this study may explain this association. It is possible that although the poor health of some cats might not have been apparent at the time of relinquishment, the initial veterinary examination would have revealed the need for euthanasia. However, it is also possible that some owners might take cats in need of euthanasia to CP rather than to their veterinary surgeon, in an attempt to reduce the cost and emotional distress associated with euthanasia. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that 27% of cats that died or were euthanased within the first 3 days of admission to the centre (excluding kittens that were born at CP), were relinquished by owners rather than admitted as stray or feral cats. It is also possible that some of the stray/feral cats were also 'owned' cats, but whose owners would not admit to ownership at the time of relinquishment, in an attempt to reduce any guilt associated with passing on the responsibility of euthanasia to an adoption centre.
