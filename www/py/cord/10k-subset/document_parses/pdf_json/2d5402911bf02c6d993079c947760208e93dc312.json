One hundred and four patients (15-96 years) with laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 infection seen at the Emergency Department from July to December 2009 who underwent chest radiographs were studied. Radiographs were evaluated for consolidation, ground-glass opacities, interstitial patterns, distribution, and extent of findings. Eighty-seven (83.7%) of the patients were managed in the ward, and 17 (16.3%) patients eventually required admission to the ICU. All patients admitted to the ICU showed abnormalities on the initial radiograph. The presence of consolidation, multifocal, diffuse, and bilateral involvement on the initial radiograph was associated with a statistically higher risk of requiring ICU admission (p<0.001). There were no significant differences regarding age, sex, and presence of underlying comorbidities. Evolution to ARDS was found in eight cases that necessitated ICU care. All of them had on the initial radiograph patchy multifocal consolidations (p<0.001) with bilateral lesions in six cases. A higher number of lung zones involved and consolidation on the initial chest radiograph as well as a rapid progression of the radiological abnormalities were identified in patients requiring ICU admission and development of ARDS.

Chest CT (lung window) reveals widespread ground-glass opacities and small perihilar and peripheral foci of parenchymal consolidation in lower lobes prominent peribronchial marking in a substantial minority in the subgroup of patients that did not precise ICU admission. This pattern, which is rare on other series of adult patients with pH1N1 infection, may be explained by the inclusion of very young patients, between 14 and 20 years in our cohort. It has been attributed to age-related differences in immunity [10] . In our study, the most common radiological pattern on admission to the ED in patients eventually requiring intensive care measures was bilateral multifocal patchy consolidation. Diffuse lung involvement was found in 25% of these patients. These findings are consistent with those inferred from the literature in the subgroups of sickest patients [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] 18] . In the largest series, Aviram et al. [18] reported that extensive lung involvement as expressed by multizonal and bilateral peripheral opacities on the initial radiograph was associated with adverse prognosis. One difference is, however, the lower prevalence of GGO in our series compared with other reports in which there were a higher number of patients studied with CT.
