There is a great discrepancy between what we know and what we can do. There are many reasons for this. A major one is that science must simplify/reduce the variables in experimentation and then generalize in terms of a specific factor or effect, whereas patients are complex with variables that we do not yet understand completely. This powerful science is now teaching us about the genetic diversity in both susceptibility and outcome of disease, and the diversity in life experiences and anti-gen exposures. Clinicians have tried to lump together and treat in a similar way many diverse human diseases. This has not worked well. Pancreatitis and perforated diverticulitis both produce inflammation and sepsis, but they are different processes and may both lead to multiple organ failure. This lumping together has contributed to the failure of so-called magic bullets. There are new contributors to organ damage. Gender, lifestyle and prior disease differences also complicate the care of patients. Despite this, we are slowly and gradually improving the care of our surgical patients by careful pre-, intra-and postoperative support and better, simpler and safer operations.",

            "text": "A classic example of this phenomenon is demonstrated by the presentation of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine to Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad [1] . These scientists demonstrated that vascular endothelial cells form nitric oxide (NO) through nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which in turn stimulates cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) synthesis in the underlying vascular smooth muscle causing relaxation or vasodilatation. This exciting contribution opened up the entire world of NO and its many biologic functions. It is an important mechanism whose activities are still being mapped out. This led to the study of excess vasodilatation in septic shock, which was thought to be due to the overproduction of NO. Many animal and clinical studies suggested that this phenomenon was occurring. It was then proposed that a NOS inhibitor would help prevent this problem of excess vasodilatation and decreased blood flow in septic shock [2, 3] . Many trials and experiments of NOS inhibitors were performed in animals and patients. However, in a recent issue of Critical Care Medicine, Grover et al. [4] reported that the randomized, double-blind clinical trial of an NOS inhibitor was discontinued due to increased mortality and adverse outcomes in patients who received the drug. There is now a moratorium against the clinical use of such agents until more is learned about them. Here, then, is an example of a Nobel Prize being awarded for the study of endothelial A.E. Baue ( \u2709 ) cell-produced NO on the one hand, and the concept of excess vasodilatation in septic shock, the hypothesis that this was due to NO and a clinical trial blocking NO that increased mortality on the other. Some would say that a specific NOS, such as inducible NOS, would have more promise.",

We do not look, act or respond alike. Our genetic differences dictate how we will respond to injury, an operation, infection or stress. Genetic studies are now beginning to describe these extensive genomic differences. Sir William Osler once said, \"As no two faces, so no two cases are alike in all respects, and unfortunately it is not only the disease itself which is so varied but the subjects themselves have peculiarities which modify its action\" [6] . 2. Our experiences in life are all different -our exposure to antigens, prior illness and injury; our immune history; and our group experiences. We are not genetically pure animals living in the same cage for our lifetimes before an insult occurs. There is also much evidence for these powerful and complex acquired differences and exposures. 3. We have tried to lump together and treat human abnormalities according to symptoms and signs rather than to the basic causes of their diseases -we have tried to treat inflammation, sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) rather than what caused them; perforated diverticulitis is not acute pancreatitis and neither are ventilator-associated pneumonia and appendicitis.",

            "text": "Next, a word about MOF, its meaning and its relationship to these complexities. In 1975, I wrote an editorial entitled \"Multiple, Progressive or Sequential Systems Failure: A Syndrome of the 1970s\" [8] . In it, I described three examples of patients that I observed who developed multiple organ problems. One patient had acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Another had a colon resection and developed an anastomotic leak leading to peritonitis. A third was a patient of mine in whom I had performed a double valve replacement (aortic and mitral valves); the patient had an extremely low cardiac output for the next 6 weeks or so and died. I reviewed the clinical course of these patients and then the autopsy findings. In one patient, for example, the autopsy indicated bronchopneumonia, necrotizing bacterial arteritis, hyaline membranes in the lung, healed and acute renal infarcts and acute tubular necrosis in the kidneys, hemorrhagic foci in the gut, pseudomembranous enterocolitis in the colon, and massive acute central lobular necrosis of the liver. Thus, in this patient there was pathologic evidence of severe multiple organ dysfunction and/or failure. This led to the development of the concept of MOF. During a sabbatical in Munich, Germany, I worked with Dr Eugen Faist. Together we reviewed the experience at the Klinikum Grosshadern, Ludwigs Maximillians Universit\u00e4t of the problem of MOF after injury. This was reported by Faist at a meeting of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma in Colorado Springs, USA [9] . In 433 consecutive patients with multiple injuries, 50 patients had single organ failure (SOF) and 34 had MOF. Mortality for MOF patients was 56%. There were 78 deaths overall (18%). Faist described two patterns: a rapid single-phase pattern of development of MOF due to trauma and shock; and a delayed second-phase MOF due to trauma, shock and then sepsis. The temporal sequence of events of organ failure was the lung first, then the clotting system, the kidney and the liver, with sepsis ultimately being the cause of death in a number of patients. Definitions of failure of each organ system were also given. For example, cardiovascular failure was defined as the presence of one or more of the following: (a) a heart rate of <54/min; (b) mean arterial pressure of <49 mmHg; (c) occurrence of ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation; (d) pH<7.24 with a PaCO 2 of <49 mmHg.",

MOF occurred in 128 patients (2.1%), primarily after emergency operations and in high-risk patients. However, 78% of these MOF patients died. Mortality in all patients was 4.7%.

SIRS has been used as the entry criteria in some studies. It is no wonder that they have failed to improve 28-day mortality, which is the usual endpoint for success. I do not believe that there is a single treatment or agent which will help all or many different complex disease processes in patients. 2. Redundancy and overlap of mediators: there is considerable overlap of the activities of cytokines and other mediators. 3. There is no single factor that acts as the lethal activator. 4. The timing of treatment is extremely important. In experimental studies in animals, pretreatment before the insult will help. Obviously, this cannot be performed for injured, sick or septic patients. 5. There is the problem of modulation of an essential biologic function -inflammation. Can we control inflammation without doing harm to the host? That is a real question that has not been resolved. 6. Is there immune deficiency or immune excess? Perhaps both occur. T-cell immune deficiency occurs after injury, whereas immune excess of the non-specific immune system such as neutrophil activation may be harmful. Thus, both may be at work. How do we sort out which is most important and which should be treated or blocked?",

Some have proposed that physiologic improvement in a critically ill patient should be used as an endpoint for a clinical trial rather than 28-day mortality. The problem with this is, what if there is some physiologic improvement such as ventilation function but the patient dies anyway. What difference does it make? Goldfarb [36] described investigations into the polydeterminate nature of sepsis. He stated that, \"A fundamental concept of modern pharmacology is: for each pathologic condition (disease) a single pharmaceutical can be found to correct 444 I believe we must go back to the suggestions of Stehbens [37, 38] . He stated that, \"Treatment of a disease, when based on symptoms or clinical manifestations is at best palliative and nonspecific.\" All of us use or give therapy based on symptoms or clinical manifestations. When we get a cold or the flu, we may take aspirin or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent. This is for palliation, to help us feel better, but it will not alter the basic disease process. Only specific treatment of a disease will improve the mortality and alter the disease process. How do you treat an injury severity score (ISS) of 26, an Apache III score of 30, SIRS, MOF, the sepsis syndrome, or a consensus conference definition of a human state. It is impossible to treat such abnormalities. Fortunately, some of the gurus of critical care agree that it is time for a reevaluation of these definitions [39] .",

A TNF2 allele is strongly associated with death from septic shock [44] and another TNFb gene is associated with sepsis in trauma patients [45] . 2. There are differences in preoperative, pre-illness immunity and prior immune history. An example of this was described by Bennett-Guererro et al. [46] , who measured the endotoxin core antibody Endocab. A low preoperative level of Endocab in patients undergoing cardiac operations predicted an adverse outcome, whereas high levels suggesting previous expo-sure to either gram-negative bacteria or endotoxin predicted an improved outcome.

Also present are discordant super family gene expression, a gene promoter polymorphism and receptor antagonist polymorphism and, of course, cytokine microsatellites [57] . An example was described by Sh et al. [7] . The association of TNF microsatellites with outcome in sepsis indicated that TNF-6 and TNF-1 levels increase in septic patients; however, TNF-10 increased in non-survivors [44, 45] . There is a tremendous disparity between scientific knowledge about endotoxin and the clinical usefulness of that knowledge. There is nothing at the present time that seems clinically useful about the knowledge on endotoxin. We know that it is present in the walls of gramnegative organisms. We know that it does all sorts of bad things when it is injected into animals and people, but we still have no information about what it does in various sick patients and what we might do about it. New developments may help [58] .",

There remains the contrast between molecular biology and minimal surgery and the disparity between them [112] . Minimal surgery has certainly contributed to better patient care. There are other procedures on the horizon such as the measurement of hemodynamic patterns during high-risk elective operations, as performed by Shoemaker et al. [113] . They found that lethal circulatory dysfunction may occur during the operation. During an operation, non-survivors were found to have a decreasing cardiac index and stroke index and stroke work, a decrease in oxygen delivery, and a decrease in oxygen consumption [114] . Identifying these factors during surgery may allow immediate corrective measures. We found, for example, that using oxygen consumption and delivery as endpoints for resuscitation in critically ill patients is not particularly helpful. Oxygen parameters are more useful as predictors of outcome than as endpoints for resuscitation [115] . We have known for many years that surgical and injured patients must increase oxygen transport, cardiac index and oxygen consumption to survive.",

Now we are learning that regularity and stability are more characteristic of the beginning of disease. For example, injection of endotoxin into normal human volunteers increased cardiac regularity [122] . Godin and Buchman stated that \"a nonlinear system is one whose behavior is not a simple sum or multiples of the inputs to the system. Chaos is irregular behavior of some deterministic, nonlinear systems\" [123] . They proposed a theory of uncoupling of biologic oscillators to progress from SIRS to MODS. Biologic systems are always coupling and uncoupling (multiple stable states). Disease is a failure to recouple. Thus, the physiologic states described by Siegel et al. [124] may be a better way to describe and treat human problems. In the meantime, we have much to learn about how non-linear integrative biology will help us to solve clinical problems.",

At this meeting, basic scientists presented the results of their exciting research into molecular biology on the leading edge of scientific knowledge. Clinical investigators presented their equally exciting findings about sick, injured and septic patients. Some of the experiences presented will help us to take better care of our patients. All of these studies are very worthwhile; however, there is a widening gap between our knowledge of human biology, our understanding of it, and our ability to help patients. Why is this? 1 449",
