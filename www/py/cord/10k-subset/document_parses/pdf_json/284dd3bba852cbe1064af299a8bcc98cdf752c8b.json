The past decade has seen some considerable advances in the diagnosis and treatment of CNS infections, despite some major challenges, such as the emergence of novel pathogens, the spread of existing pathogens to new geographical areas as a result of travel and climate change, and moresevere outbreaks caused by existing pathogens becoming more virulent, and increasing numbers of immunocompromised people. As organizers of the G ordon Res e arch Conferences on Infections of t he Ner vous Sys tem in 2013 and 2015, we have had the opportunity to closely follow the advances made in the prevention and treatment of CNS infections. Despite these advances, many unmet challenges remain, including the rise of resistance to the antimalarial drug artemisin in patients with severe cerebral malaria, which has increased morbidity and mortality, re-emergence of arbovirusinduced CNS disease, limited treatment options for cryptococcal meningitis, and failure of the Japanese encephalitis vaccine, to name a few.",

Less attention has been given to potentially fatal nervous system invasion by neurotropic viruses, parasites or mycobacteria; encephalitides caused by these pathogens are more common in developing than developed countries, and are an important health issue in resourcepoor regions, because many of the survivors are left with disability that reduces healthrelated quality of life and causes a great socioeconomic burden. The epidemiological changes that have occurred in recent years have placed greater importance on recently emerged pathogens, such as the Nipah and Chikungunya viruses across Asia, and West Nile virus across the Americas. 1 Meanwhile, enterovirus 71, has continued to cause mass outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease across Asia, which is associated with neurological complications that can manifest as meningitis or severe brainstem encephalitis. 2 These neurological complications can, via hitherto unknown mechanisms, lead to cardiovascular collapse and death. 2 Enterovirus 71 has even been described by some as the 'new polio' , because it belongs to the same enterovirus group IV as poliovirus, and can cause acute flaccid paralysis that mimics poliomyelitis. No antiviral agent or vaccine against enterovirus 71 is currently available.",

Chikungunya infections are characterized by fever, headache, rashes, and debilitating arthralgia that can continue for years after infection. Atypical manifestations have also been described, and include neurological symptoms that range from simple and complex febrile seizures to meningeal syndrome, acute encephalopathy, diplopia, aphasia, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and encephalitis. 3 After its first reported appearance in 1952, the virus re-emerged in the Indian Ocean islands in 2005-2006, and several outbreaks of Chikungunya infection have occurred since late 2013, particularly in the Caribbean islands and the Americas, but also in several countries in Africa and Southern Europe. Increased global travel, evolution of the virus and adaptation of mosquito vectors have all been suggested as contributing factors to the spread of the virus to new geographical areas. 3 No vaccination or treatment for Chikungunya virus exists, and avoiding mosquito bites is currently the only way to prevent the disease.",

Outbreaks of new influenza strains, such as H5N1, have also highlighted the potential of such viruses to cause neurological disease. 4 In recent years, the number of immunocompromised individuals who are particularly susceptible to CNS infection has increased owing to the HIV epidemic and increased use of immunosuppressive treatments, for example to induce immune tolerance after organ transplantation or to treat autoimmune disorders. Neurologists should be particularly aware of the risk of CNS infection in patients who are immunocompromised, because many neurological disorders are treated with immunosuppressive therapies.

Despite these advances, the proportion of patients with CNS infections who are misdiagnosed remains stubbornly high. 6 Treatment of some brain infections, including acute bacterial meningitis and tuberculous meningitis, has improved over the past decade owing to a better understanding of the clinical features and the ways in which they contribute to poor outcomes. 7 Moreover, the mechanism of corticosteroids in the treatment of some of these conditions has been better defined: the benefit of dexamethasone has been demonstrated in adults with acute bacterial meningitis in most developed countries, as has its ability to reduce the incidence and severity of hearing loss in pneumococcal disease. However, the drug is often of no benefit to adults or children in developing, tropical countries, perhaps because patients in these countries are more likely to have untreated HIV. 8 In Vietnamese adults with tuberculous meningitis, dexamethasone reduced mortality and is now used for most patients with this condition.",
