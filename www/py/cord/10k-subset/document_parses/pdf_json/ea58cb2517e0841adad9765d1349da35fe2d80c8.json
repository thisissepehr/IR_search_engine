[2] [3] [4] Recent data indicate that the warning signs of a leak after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can be difficult to detect; tachycardia and tachypnea may be the most useful clinical indicators. 5 Importantly, when these signs are combined with a clinical suspicion for infection, the patient meets the Society of Critical Care Medicine/American College of Chest Physicians criteria for sepsis syndrome; if acute organ dysfunction is present, the patient can be diagnosed as SSS. 6 It has become evident that by early recognition of the disease and implementing a rapid, coordinated, comprehensive approach, the critical care team can reduce mortality in sepsis. 7 Recent landmark studies associated with improved outcomes in SSS include", "cite_spans": [{"start": 166, "end": 167, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 352, "end": 355, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 356, "end": 359, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 360, "end": 363, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 547, "end": 548, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 832, "end": 833, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1015, "end": 1016, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "the use of lower tidal volumes in patients who develop the pulmonary manifestation of sepsis, 8 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 9 and of low-dose glucocorticoids in those patients with SSS and evidence of partial adrenal insufficiency. 10 Although there is mounting evidence that the use of pulmonary artery catheters per se may not lead to improved outcomes in the critically ill, 11 a recent important study documented that with early, aggressive, protocol-guided goal-directed therapy, in-hospital sepsis mortality could be decreased by 34%. 12 In spite of these advances in the management of SSS, it has been difficult to find a pharmacotherapeutic agent that can successfully target the sepsis cascade itself. The current theory is that in SSS, three major biological pathways, the inflammatory, coagulation, and fibrinolytic cascade, fail to respond to normal homeostatic factors. The closely-linked inflammatory and coagulation cascades are hyperactive, while the fibrinolytic cascade is inhibited. 13 Examples of agents where there was great hope for efficacy but mortality benefit could not be proven in SSS, include antibody against TNF-a, high dose glucocorticoids and, in a recent study, the anticoagulant antithrombin III. 14 Activated protein C (APC), drotrecogin alfa (activated), was felt to be a potential therapeutic agent for SSS, as it combines anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory and profibrinolytic properties. 15, 16 Its efficacy was proven in a recent large multicenter randomized controlled trial (PROWESS, Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis) of over 1,600 patients (27% post-surgical). In this study, the overall 28-day mortality in patients with SSS was reduced by nearly 20%. 17 The entrance criteria (Table 1) for the PROWESS trial were quite strict. For example, although the accepted definition of sepsis is infection plus 2 or more SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome, Table 1 ) criteria, 6 a patient was required to have 3 of 4 SIRS criteria to be entered into the PROWESS trial. The standard definitions for acute organ dysfunction were used; the patient could have the organ dysfunction for no longer than 24 hours. Once they were enrolled in the study, another 24 hours could elapse before starting the drug. Thus, there could be a maximum of 48 hours of acute sepsis-induced organ dysfunction before initiation of the APC infusion. The PROWESS trial included patients with SSS, whether or not they were at high risk of death as determined by their APACHE II score. The exclusion criteria in the PROWESS trial were also rather stringent ( Table 2 ). The ones that are most relevant to the bariatric surgeon include: surgery within 12 hours of infusion, active postoperative bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 weeks before study, known hypercoagulable condition, history of bone marrow, lung, liver, pancreas or small-bowel transplantation and chronic renal fail-ure requiring dialysis as well as acute pancreatitis.

Some examples include the APACHE II, MODS (Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score), 27 SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment), 28 SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiology Score) II, 29 and LODS (Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score) systems. 30 The APACHE II score was used in the PROWESS trial (as it has been used in most Critical Care trials) to demonstrate that the group who received the intervention was approximately as ill as the control group. This somewhat cumbersome scoring system takes into account vital signs, oxygenation, acid-base and electrolyte status as well as white-cell count, hematocrit, mental status, patient age and history of chronic illness (http://www.sfar.org/scores2/apache22.html). As part of their approval process, the FDA performed a retrospective post hoc analysis of the data, and found that although the mortality for the entire population decreased from 31% to 25% with the use of the drug, if the data was broken down by APACHE II score, the group of patients with an APACHE II score of <25 received no benefit from the drug, while mortality decreased from 44% to 31% if the APACHE II score was 25. This led to the FDA approval of the drug for patients with SSS and a high risk of death as evidenced by an elevated APACHE II score. Many considered this to be a controversial move as there was no precedent for using such a scoring system to select patients for novel therapies. 31 In addition, the APACHE II score can be very dynamic with interobserver and intraobserver variability as high as 10 to 20%. 32 The SOFA scoring system was used by Vincent et al 33 in their analysis of secondary endpoints of the PROWESS trial data. This system grades organ dysfunction from 0 (no dysfunction) to 4 (severe dysfunction) and does this for each of five systems (cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hematologic, and hepatic).
