            "text": "Individuals display variable ability to fight infections, as well as variable susceptibility to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Evidence that has accumulated since the 1950s suggests that such heterogeneity partly reflects differences in the genetic make-up of the human host [1] [2] [3] . Particularly in the past decade, genetic studies have provided numerous examples of genes accounting for differences in susceptibility to rare or common infectious diseases. The advent of new technologies, such as DNA microarrays and next-generation sequencing, has greatly accelerated the field of human genetics, making it possible to evaluate the contribution of genetic diversity to differences in immunity to infection at the level of the entire genome. For example, recent studies have revealed the power of whole-exome sequencing for dissecting the immunological mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of severe, rare infectious diseases [4] [5] [6] . Likewise, some genome-wide association studies on viral, bacterial and parasitic infections have increased knowledge on the genetic basis of susceptibility to common infectious diseases at the population level 3, 7 . Although these studies have provided the proof-of-concept that increased susceptibility to infectious diseases may result from various types of inborn errors of immunity, only a few cases are fully understood at the genetic level 1 .",

Here, we do not attempt to review these topics, but instead focus on how humans have adapted to the pressure imposed by microorganisms through variation in their genomes. Among the different types of adaptation, those affecting immune function are among the most dynamic because the counter-evolution of pathogens drives the need for continuous adaptive change (BOX 1) . It is precisely because of this strong and ever-renewing demand for adaptation that genes in the immune system acquire unique and clear signatures of natural selection.",

Thus, innate immunity-associated genes provide an excellent model for the study of the selective pressure that is exerted by microorganisms on the host genome. The innate immune systems of plants, invertebrates and vertebrates involve genes that can be classified into various groups on the basis of their function in immune surveillance, signal transduction or effector response to microorganisms [13] [14] [15] [16] , and these genes have evolved under the constant environmental pressure of microorganisms. In addition, in vertebrates, innate immunity precedes and shapes adaptive immune responses, so variations in vertebrate innate immunity genes may have important consequences for the quantity and quality of downstream B and T cell responses. Thus, the crucial roles of the proteins encoded by innate immunity genes make them ideal targets of natural selection and valuable tools for population genetics studies.",

Selection often maintains the prototype gene by eliminating mutations that compromise organism fitness, as most mutations are more likely to perturb rather than improve protein function. The process by which deleterious mutations are culled from the population is called purifying selection or negative selection and is the most pervasive form of selection acting on genomes. At the population level, genes tend to carry the same number of synonymous mutations (no amino acid change) and non-synonymous mutations (amino acid change), despite the fact that random mutagenesis actually generates nearly twice as many non-synonymous changes. The reduced number of non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) observed as compared with the non-synonymous mutation rate indicates the elimination of many non-synonymous mutations through purifying selection 20 .",

It is also possible that variants have an advantage when rare in the population (frequencydependent selection) or that heterozygotes for a specific mutation have the highest fitness (heterozygote advantage). These two situations give rise to balancing selection 22 : a selective regime that maintains variation in the population. A prime example of balancing selection is provided by the MHC region, in which high levels of polymorphism are preserved through various mechanisms, including sexual selection and pathogen diversity [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

It has been speculated that still-unidentified intracellular receptors may be able to sense unmethylated CpGs of RNA viruses. This has proven to be the case for DNA viruses, wherein unmethylated CpG DNA of the virus can be detected by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) 143 . Interestingly, the 1918 H1N1 influenza strain had a much higher CpG content than other human-adapted influenza strains, and this might have triggered an exceptionally strong, aberrant immune response, known as a cytokine storm, in H1N1-infected patients 144 , killing up to 50 million people worldwide. Deaths from the SARS epidemic in 2003 (REF. 145) and from H5N1 bird flu 146 are likely to have involved cytokine storms, as both diseases are characterized by the high mortality of young, otherwise healthy people. Further studies of host-pathogen co-evolution in humans that include a wider range of pathogens and take advantage of whole-genome sequencing technologies will undoubtedly contribute to our understanding of the biology and genetics of infectious disease, and they may have important epidemiological implications in the context of emerging and re-emerging diseases.

In humans, several receptor families are involved in the cellular arm of innate immunity, including the membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), and the cytosolic RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and other DNA sensors [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . In addition, complement receptors and ficolins are circulating proteins that constitute the humoral arm of innate immunity 44 . Following ligand binding, receptors induce the activation of distinct signalling pathways that involve adaptor molecules, which mediate signalling, and effector molecules, such as interferons (IFNs) or antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are required for the eradication of pathogens or danger signals. Blue circles indicate neutral polymorphisms. a | Purifying selection removes deleterious alleles (indicated by black circles) from the population. The pace at which deleterious mutations are purged from the population depends on their effect on host survival, which can range from lethal (immediately removed from the population) to mildly deleterious (tolerated but kept at low population frequencies). These mutations tend to be associated with rare, severe disorders (for example, Mendelian susceptibility to infection at the individual level). b | Positive selection increases the frequency of an advantageous mutation (indicated by a red circle) in the population. Advantageous mutations can be fixed (completed selective sweep) or polymorphic (ongoing selective sweep; not shown) in the population. Positively selected mutations are often associated with common traits (for example, higher resistance to infection at the population level), which present complex modes of inheritance. c | Balancing selection maintains polymorphism in the population as a result of heterozygote advantage and frequency-dependent advantage (not shown).

These tests, as well as the Hudson-Kreitman-Aguad\u00e9 (HKA) test, also use information from divergence data between species (for example, human versus chimpanzee). Tests based on the allele frequency spectrum, such as Tajima's D, Fu and Li's D and F, and Fay and Wu's H tests, detect more recent selective events (<250,000 years) and are powerful for detecting completed or quasi-completed selective sweeps, but they are highly sensitive to demographic factors. Tests based on differences between populations, such as F ST , which examines the variation in allele frequencies between human populations, are powerful for detecting selective differences among populations, especially those that occurred after the out-of-Africa dispersals (<60,000 years). In addition, these tests can detect rapid, strong changes in selective pressures between closely related populations but are sensitive to demographic factors (especially bottlenecks). Lastly, tests based on haplotype length and homozygosity, such as the long-range haplotype (LRH), integrated haplotype score (iHS), linkage disequilibrium decay (LDD) and cross population extended haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH) tests, are very powerful in the detection of very recent events of positive selection (<30,000 years) and are relatively robust to demographic factors, but they are sensitive to strong variation (that is, the presence of hotspots) in recombination along the genome. The list of statistical methods presented here is not exhaustive, and they have been extensively reviewed elsewhere (see REFS 10, 19 and specific references therein).",

These two TLRs contain the highest number of positively selected codons, several of which are involved in ligand binding or in interaction with the TLR4 coreceptor MD2 (also known as LY96) 51 . This high interspecies divergence suggests that the presence or absence of pathogens that are sensed by TLR1 and TLR4 may be one of the most important variants in the ecological niches of the different primate species.",

However, most intraspecific studies thus far converge towards the opposite conclusion: TLRs, taken as a set, have mainly evolved under the action of purifying selection 46, 47, 49, 51 , which highlights their indispensability. More precisely, intracellular TLRs evolve under the strongest purifying selection (FIG. 2) , and neither nonsense nor damaging missense mutations are tolerated at these genes 46 . By contrast, the selective constraints on cellsurface TLRs are much more relaxed, and these TLRs present high levels of genetic and functional diversity across populations 46, 54 . In the human population, up to 23% of individuals have damaging missense mutations and up to 16% present a nonsense mutation in at least one cell-surface TLR 46,50 , suggesting higher redundancy. The case of TLR5 -the receptor of flagellin -is particularly extreme, as the R392X nonsense variant, which has a dominant-negative effect 55 , is present at high frequencies (up to 23%) in Europeans and South Asians 46, 50 . This suggests that TLR5 is not crucial for immunity to infection against at least some flagellated bacteria, and that accessory mechanisms of flagellin recognition, such as those involving the cytosolic receptor Ice protease-activating factor (IPAF; also known as NLRC4) 56 , may provide sufficient protection.",

However, it is tempting to speculate that such an evolutionary relaxation might also indicate that pathogens recognized by cell-surface TLRs have imposed a milder burden on humans than on other primates.

Cell-surface TLRs detect microbial molecules, such as bacterial cell-surface lipopolysaccharides or flagellin, which are usually very distinct from host molecules. By contrast, intracellular TLRs principally sense nucleic acids, such as double-stranded RNA of viruses or the unmethylated CpG islands of bacterial and viral DNA. Although these microbial nucleic acids can be distinguished from host nucleic acids on the basis of specific chemical modifications 58 , there is still the risk that intracellular TLRs could be stimulated 'inappropriately' by self-derived nucleic acids, which may lead to autoimmunity [59] [60] [61] [62] .

It seems therefore that signalling genes display more signs of positive selection than do microbial sensors, although several genes provide exceptions to this rule 149 .

The three RLR members, retinoic acid-inducible gene I protein (RIG-I; also known as DDX58), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5; also known as IFIH1) and LGP2 (also known as DHX58), detect viral RNA and induce inflammatory cytokines and type I and type III IFNs 41 . RIG-I and MDA5 sense directly viral molecules, whereas LGP2 acts as a regulator of RIG-I and MDA5 signalling. The NLR proteins, which have a structure that closely resembles that of the resistance proteins (also known as R proteins) in plants 16 , are encoded by a family of 22 genes, which include the 14 members of the large NACHT, LRR and pyrin domain-containing protein (NALP) subfamily (NALP1-NALP14), the five nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing (NOD) proteins (NOD1, NOD2, NLR family CARD domain containing 3 (NLRC3), NLRC5 and NLR family member X1 (NLRX1)) and other proteins, such as MHC class II transactivator (CIITA), IPAF and NLR family, apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) 40, 42 .

TLR1  TLR4  TLR4  TLR10  TLR2 Some population genetics studies have proposed that balancing selection has driven MBL2 diversity 47, 72 , but others have failed to detect any evidence of selection favouring the increased frequency of deficiency alleles 73, 76 . Indeed, when analysing larger population data sets, the pattern of MBL2 variation appears to be consistent with neutral evolution 73 . These population genetics observations provide novel insights that inform the long-standing and highly controversial debate as to whether MBL is protective, deleterious or both, and they suggest instead that the immunological mechanisms triggered by this lectin are largely redundant. So, other molecules or pathways, such as the ficolins or the C1q-dependent classical pathway, may compensate for MBL deficiency.

MYD88 has a pan-adaptor role 77 , so a strong constraint is expected, but TRIF has also evolved under strong purifying selection despite not functioning as a pan-adaptor. TRIF is involved in signalling downstream of TLR3 and TLR4 (REF. 77 ), and of these two only TLR3 evolves under purifying selection 46 . Indeed, clinical genetic studies have revealed that rare mutations affecting the TLR3-TRIF pathway underlie herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis in childhood 45, 80, 81 . This suggests that the entire pathway activated by TLR3 in a TRIFdependent manner is non-redundant in host defence, at least against HSV-1 (REFS 45, 78) . Together with immunological, clinical and epidemiological approaches, future population genetics studies aiming to dissect the selective signatures at the level of entire signalling pathways will allow us to further delineate the most critical mechanisms involved in innate immunity to infection.",

An interesting example of increased functional diversity is provided by the human \u03b2-defensin gene DEFB1, which has evolved under the action of longterm balancing selection 91 , a process that is thought to be extremely rare outside the MHC genes. The balancing selective event has been localized to the promoter region of DEFB1, where increased functional variation (through heterozygosity) appears to have conferred a selective advantage, possibly against severe sepsis 91, 92 .

The blue segment corresponds to the proportion of chromosomes carrying neither non-synonymous nor nonsense polymorphisms.

A schematic representation of the signalling pathways activated by the interaction of type I, type II and type III IFNs with their corresponding receptors is also presented. b | Type III IFNs are the only group of IFNs that have evolved under the action of positive selection, specifically in European and Asian populations. The scheme shows the distribution of the genetic variants under positive selection across the genomic region in which the three type III IFN genes are located. Note that one of the positively selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the interleukin-28B (IL28B) region (SNP -3180A>G, rs12979860) has been recently found to lay within the newly discovered IFNL4 gene, which is located upstream of IL28B 123 . Highlighted mutations result in amino acid changes, whereas the rest are non-coding SNPs. Signatures of positive selection were detected in Asia for the variants in IL28A and IL28B, and in both Asia and Europe for that in IL29. Figure is modified from REF. 84 .

Moreover, the fact that selective constraints acting on RLRs are weaker than those acting on endosomal TLRs 46,51,65 , even though both types of receptors detect nucleic acids, might reflect some degree of redundancy for RLR-mediated antiviral immunity. Similarly, the weaker constraints acting on most NOD, IPAF and CIITA subfamily members and cellsurface TLRs with respect to NALPs 46,64 suggest greater redundancy in the pathways triggered by the former molecules in response to microbial products and stress signals (FIG. 2) . Extreme cases of redundancy are provided by molecules such as MBL or TLR5, for which the frequency of loss-of-function alleles can increase in the population by genetic drift 46, 50, 73, 76 . This contrasts with other situations in which gene loss has conferred an advantage to the host. For example, the increased frequencies of loss-offunction alleles of DARC (which encodes Duffy antigen/ chemokine receptor) or CASP12 (which encodes inactive caspase 12) is a result of positive selection that is likely to be due to their protective effects against Plasmodium vivax infection and sepsis, respectively 93, 94 .",

These positive selection events can be ancient and shared by all humans. Such is the case for the adaptor MYD88 (REF. 78 ): a functional change in this protein may have favoured the survival of the entire human species. The human MYD88 differs from its primate orthologue by a single amino acid substitution (H80Q), which might represent the target of selection 48, 78 . This variant is located within the DEATH domain, which is crucial for downstream protein-protein interactions, and mutations in this domain have been associated with defective immunity to infection 95, 96 . Conversely, other events of positive selection seem to be more recent and restricted to specific populations, such as those detected at some RLRs, NLRs, TIR-containing adaptors and type III IFNs [63] [64] [65] 78, 79, 84 . So, the advantage conferred by such events is more dependent on environmental variables, possibly related to exposure to pathogens. For example, a variant in MDA5 (R460H) has been targeted by positive selection in Europeans and Asians 63,65 , suggesting an advantage to host defence that could be related to the sensing of particular RNA viruses by this sensor. Population genetics thus helps us to differentiate between genes with a high degree of redundancy and genes that are essential and non-redundant. The identification of essential genes is particularly important for molecules with poorly described functions, such as most NALPs, as this helps to prioritize which genes should be studied from an immunological standpoint.",

            "text": "Does the evolution of innate immunity genes and their signatures of selection reflect a quest for improved host defence against pathogenic microorganisms? The answer is yes, but not exclusively. It is obvious that pathogens are likely to be a major force exerting pressure on host genes 26, 97 . However, we coexist with millions of symbiotic, generally non-pathogenic microorganisms, and these can also be recognized by innate immunity receptors [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] . Furthermore, these receptors are not only involved in the mere sensing of microorganisms but also in functions that ensure tissue development and tissue homeostasis, including inflammatory control, autophagy and apoptosis. For example, some TLRs appear to be involved in central nervous system development, and some NALPs seem to have roles in intestinal homeostasis, early development and reproduction 40, 103, 104 . Moreover, innate receptors, including TLRs and RLRs, have also been implicated in autoimmune pathogenesis 60, 61, [105] [106] [107] . In light of this, the traditional view of pathogens as the only force driving the evolution of immunity genes may be too simplistic, as non-infection-related factors may have further contributed to the patterns of selection observed at these genes. For example, given the increasing range of functions attributed to NALP3, which acts as both a microbial sensor and a regulator of intestinal homeostasis 40,104 , its extreme conservation may not only attest to a major role in controlling infection but also reflect the evolutionary equilibrium reached by the host to maintain a peaceful coexistence with the symbiotic microbiota.",

Specifically, positively selected variants in TLR1, MDA5, CIITA or NALP1 (REFS 46, (63) (64) (65) have been associated with infectious, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases 106, [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] . Likewise, variation in type III IFNs, including five SNPs in IL28B (also known as IFNL3), two in IL28A (also known as IFNL2) and one in IL29 (also known as IFNL1), has been targeted by positive selection 84 (FIG. 3b) . Interestingly, the positively selected SNPs in the IL28B region, one of which now lies within the newly discovered IFNL4 gene 123 , have been associated with spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and a better response to treatment for chronic HCV infection [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] . This suggests that the nature of the selective advantage conferred by these IFNs is increased resistance to viral infection. Collectively, the overlap between the positive selection events detected at some genes and their association with susceptibility to complex disease provides an important proof-of-concept for the added, predictive value of population genetics. This is particularly important for evaluating the potential implications in human disease of other, as-yet-uncharacterized variants targeted by positive selection.",

Similarly, positive selection has increased the frequency of the V1059M mutation in NALP1 among Europeans 64 , despite also increasing the frequency of the linked L155H NALP1 mutation, which is associated with autoimmune disorders including Addison's disease, type 1 diabetes and vitiligo 118, 129 . Likewise, DEFB1 haplotypes that have been proposed to be maintained by balancing selection because they confer protection against sepsis 91, 92 seem to predispose to asthma and atopy 130 . Although further clinical and epidemiological genetics work is needed, these examples provide additional evidence in favour of the hygiene hypothesis, according to which the current increased incidence of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders may result, at least partially, from past events of selection that increased host resistance to infection 128 .",

At the gene level, the diversity of NOD2 is largely consistent with neutrality 64 , but some NOD2 Crohn's diseaserisk alleles have been proposed to be maintained in the European population by balancing or recent positive selection 131, 133 , although this remains highly controversial.

The evolutionary dissection of innate immunity genes allows us to rank them with respect to their biological relevance and also informs us about their respective contribution to immunity-related disorders. However, immune systems do not evolve one gene at a time; instead, selective pressures are likely to affect multiple interacting genes, resulting in polygenic adaptation 134 . Furthermore, such pressures can be numerous and related to various diseases simultaneously, as in the case of NOD2 alleles. Thus, genes in functional networks might show coordinated signatures of selection, as recently proposed for a group of antibacterial innate immunity genes (that is, some TLR pathways), in which the position of each gene in the network conditions its evolvability and therefore its adaptability 135 . The recent advent of whole-genome sequencing data sets from human populations provides us with tools to test these hypotheses and also enables the analysis of additional families of innate immunity molecules, including CLRs, cytosolic DNA sensors, chemokines and members of the TNF family. For this, improved statistical methods for detecting epistatic interactions or selection in gene networks are needed.",

However, selection can also target non-coding regions of the genome, such as regulatory elements 136 . For example, changes in gene expression levels can indeed constitute a target for adaptive evolution, as illustrated by the fact that polymorphisms in regulatory elements (that is, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)) are enriched for signs of positive selection 137 . Furthermore, regulatory variation is increasingly documented as being associated with phenotypic variation, both benign and disease-associated 136, 138, 139 . Multidisciplinary approaches (such as those used by the ENCODE Consortium 136 ) that combine whole-genome sequencing data, expression and proteomic profiles, chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation marks from different cell types challenged with different immune stimuli should facilitate an unbiased assessment of the immunological mechanisms favouring our past and present survival in the natural setting.",

Indeed, the extent to which host genetic diversity drives, or co-evolves with, changes in the microbiota remains to be explored in much further detail. Similarly, detailed genotype-to-phenotype studies of large population cohorts from different ethnic backgrounds and exposed to different environments will help us to delineate the relative contribution of the modern environment to the present-day natural variation of immune responses. Notably, the change in dietary habits and the use of domesticated animals since the advent of agriculture 10,000 years ago (which is an instant in evolutionary time), life in large cities and the extended use of modern antibiotics have radically altered our exposure to microorganisms. As our immune systems evolved in a totally different context of diet and microbial exposure, interaction of our genetic make-up with these new environmental factors may lead to phenotypes associated with disease states, such as inappropriate inflammatory responses or autoimmunity. So, the integration of all these data into a population genetics framework will help us to identify immunological mechanisms with adaptive or maladaptive roles in the immunity of modern human populations.",

Genes that have undergone purifying selection are shown in red, and those that have evolved under weaker selective constraints are shown in blue. Genes for which no significant evidence of a selective constraint was observed are shown in grey. Colours reflect the intensity of the selective constraints on amino acid-altering variation, as obtained by the McDonald-Kreitman Poisson random field method McDonald-Kretiman Poisson random field method (omega and gamma)31 (BOX 2). Genes presenting robust signatures of positive selection in all humans are outlined with a thick black line, whereas genes presenting robust signatures of positive selection that are restricted to specific human populations are outlined with a dashed black line. Endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs) show signs of stronger purifying selection than do cell-surface TLRs. Myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MYD88) is the TLR adaptor molecule that has evolved under the strongest purifying selection, which indicates its central role as a pan-adaptor molecule. Furthermore, all adaptors have been targeted by positive selection, either in the entire human lineage (MYD88 and sterile alpha and TIR motif-containing protein (SARM)) or in specific human populations (TIR domain-containing adapter molecule 1 (TRIF), TIR domain-containing adapter molecule 2 (TRAM) and Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domaincontaining adapter protein (MAL)), suggesting advantages in terms of immunity that are shared by all humans or that are due to geographically restricted microbial exposure, respectively. Purifying selection has driven the evolution of most NACHT, LRR and pyrin domain-containing proteins (NALPs), whereas other cytosolic microbial sensors, such as the NOD-like receptors (NLRs), Ice protease-activating factor (IPAF) and MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) and most NOD subfamily members, as well as the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), have evolved under weaker constraints.
