Methods Retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients with CAP caused by S. pneumoniae who were admitted to the 32-bed medico-surgical ICU of a community and referral university hospital between 2002 and 2011. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on variables available at admission. Results Among the 77 adult patients with severe CAP caused by S. pneumoniae who required ICU management, 12 patients died (observed mortality rate 15.6 %). Univariate analysis indicated that septic shock and low C-reactive protein (CRP) values at admission were associated with an increased risk of death. In a multivariate model, after adjustment for age and gender, septic shock [odds ratio (OR), confidence interval 95 %; 4.96, 1.11-22.25; p = 0.036], and CRP (OR 0.99, E. Charbonney and P.

Interestingly, our data showed that among patients with CAP caused by S. pneumoniae that required ICU management, the presence of septic shock and a low initial serum CRP level at admission correlated with a fatal outcome. This finding is unexpected and counterintuitive. Most clinicians would consider a priori that low CRP values may be associated with a less severe systemic inflammation response, which should reflect a better prognosis. However, data from animal studies suggest an association between CRP values and survival. In mice, administration of CRP within a few hours of a S. pneumoniae challenge led to a reduction in the concentration of bacteria in the blood, and consecutively lessened the severity of the infection [19, 20] . Over the study period, PCT values were only available for a small number of patients, precluding any conclusion about the absence of difference between survivors and non-survivors. Several aspects may limit the interpretation of our data. We retrospectively analyzed a small cohort of patients admitted over one decade. Nevertheless, these patients can be considered as a homogenous cohort of severely ill patients requiring ICU management in an institution where the ratio between ICU and intermediate care beds is 1-3.

However, community-acquired pneumonia is characterized by an undefined and highly variable time between onset of the disease, clinical manifestations, and hospital admission. As such, the precise interval of time between onset of the disease and the first antibiotic administration is hard to determine, although highly relevant. This observation is only valid in the specific stetting of patients with severe pneumonia requiring ICU management. Our results should be considered as preliminary, but should be of sufficient interest to justify confirmation in larger cohorts of patients. An eventual confirmation of a significant correlation between low initial CRP values and fatal outcomes may be used to stratify patients with severe CAP caused by S. pneumoniae. Indeed, progressive ICU shortages (e.g., ICUrelated costs, shortages of ICU physician, and nurses) may be responsible for the early ICU discharge of patients that are perceived to be at low risk of death, such as those with severe infection and a good perceived prognosis.",

Each score was included in a separate multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for gender, CRP and septic shock, adding age in the analysis with SOFA. When age is included, as a categorical variable (age group >65 vs \u226465), SOFA (OR 1.6; CI 95 % 1.18-2.23, P = 0.030) remained significant to predict mortality. Outcome prediction at time of admission Severity scores include the worst values of a high number of physiological variables and can only be computed after 24 h, so they were not included in this analysis. After adjustment for age and gender, septic shock (OR 4.96; CI 95 % 1.11-22.25, P = 0.036) and a low CRP value (OR 0.99; CI 95 % 0.98-099, P = 0.034) predicted death. When age was included as categorical variable (age >65 vs \u226465), septic shock (OR 5.42; CI 95 % 1.18-24.9, P = 0.030), and a low CRP value (OR 0.99; CI 95 % 0.98-099, P = 0.023) remained significant. Among the 20 patients (26 %) for whom PCT measurements within 24 h of admission were available, the median PCT value was 20.8 ng/ml (IQ: 4.4-40.4). No statistical difference was found between survivors (14 patients, median 7.4 ng/ml (IQR: 3.5-55.1) and non-survivors (6 patients, median 36.5 ng/ml (IQR 16.3-40.4) (P = 0.35; Mann-Whitney).",
