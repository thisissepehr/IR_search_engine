Nineteen (86%) of 22 eligible studies agreed to participate. Through in-depth semistructured interviews, participants provided retention strategies based on themes identified from previous literature reviews.

Other features of these successful teams included selecting appropriate individuals with responsibility for participant contact and providing intensive training and support on study protocols, including retention techniques. In recruiting research staff for cohort retention activities, study teams often screened applicants for experience, communication skills, cultural-competence and specialized knowledge of the population (e.g. Spanish-speaking, domestic violence advocate).

Two studies involving victims of intimate partner violence arranged for a safe meeting place and transportation as well as childcare [15, 21] . In many of the studies, parking and transportation were reimbursed. Studies also used financial compensation as a retention strategy, with amounts ranging from $10 for 1 h of survey response to $200 for a full day of data collection with invasive testing. To help keep participants engaged throughout the study's follow-up period, studies employed various methods. For instance, studies sent regular newsletters and cards for holidays, birthdays and even condolences. Many studies sent reminder letters about the study and upcoming visits at regular intervals. Lastly, many teams sought to develop strong staff-participant relationships by having the same staff throughout the follow-up period, which created long-standing relationships (e.g., decade-long) between study staff and participants.

Recognizing this pattern after the initial interviews, we added interview questions to explore the lack of written protocols to delineate retention strategies. Interviews revealed that existing study protocols were not detailed regarding techniques to locate and retain participants or were out of date. Since strategies were frequently adapted to reflect new or revised retention strategies tailored to individual participant's circumstances, with many of the changes verbally discussed during team meetings, revised retention strategies were noted but not updated in the actual protocol. Notably, principal investigators (PIs) and study coordinators agreed that IRB review and approval is an important process and that they developed study protocols recognizing IRB and ethical issues. In some studies, retention protocols submitted to the IRB included general principles for follow-up, rather than a detailed protocol, due to concern that a detailed protocol would require frequent IRB submissions with amendments and not be practicable to implement. Moreover, there were conflicting perceptions regarding whether or not the IRB would be supportive of cohort retention approaches that include internet or social media searches and persistence when trying to locate hard-to-find participants.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Protocols do not reflect the many details of retention strategies employed"}, {"text": "The 19 studies with high cohort retention evaluated via in-depth interviews were heterogeneous in terms of design, sample size, target population and length of follow up.

However, this study does provide further insight through the thematic analysis of in-depth interviews. These studies had research staff members who are specialized, persistent and collaborate well to accomplish their retention goals teams. They utilized personalized approaches and tailored retention strategies specific to participants in the study cohorts. This tailoring of strategies that are not formally documented in written form is an iterative process based largely on the experience and persistence of study coordinators.

The present study suggests the importance of having a well-functioning research team that is organized, persistent, adaptable, and innovative. Prior studies focused on financial incentives to recruit and retain participants, finding a positive correlation between magnitude of incentive and retention rates [4, 5] . In our study, the use of financial incentives varied, yet all studies had high rates of retention, suggesting that participants also respond to additional strategies, such as facilitating visits and emphasizing other potential benefits of participating in the study. The in-depth interviews from this study confirm prior empirical analyses that demonstrated that achieving high retention rates requires use of multiple retention strategies and often many contact attempts by highly skilled staff [4, 22] . However, it is not clear which strategies are the most effective for study teams with limited budgets to implement. Though budget allocation for retention-specific activities was not assessed, most of these high retention studies were federally funded and adequately resourced; 15 of 19 studies had personnel that were trained and specialized, contributing to the high retention.

Maintaining updated retention protocols may be valuable for staff training and for maintaining high retention rates throughout the study, especially in the event of staff turnover. In addition, social media is in constant evolution and investigators should consider using technologies available to provide high quality longitudinal data. A recent article examined feasibility of using websites and social media for recruitment and demonstrated that a young female urban population is more likely to respond to these methods than traditional methods such as flyers and health fairs [23] .

In addition, ethical regulation and oversight of studies has great variation within large academic centers, between institutions, and globally. In addition, IRB policies continue to evolve, particularly in response to new strategies such as digital and social media-based approaches for participant contact.

This study's strength is the novelty of using in-depth interviews to obtain unpublished data from research teams to explore successful retention strategies for following large cohorts for at least one year. Moreover, a heterogeneous mix of high retention studies were included, with varying cohort sizes (205-2528 participants) and types of study population, including a national cohort study (ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study -ALTOS) that enrolled over 900 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors from more than 40 sites [17, 19] . However, this study also has potential limitations. First, only studies with \u2265200 participants and retention rates \u226580% were considered; thereby, potentially limiting the comprehensiveness and generalizability of the data collected. However, all retention strategies from a prior systematic review [4] were exemplified through the interviews, offering some replication of findings. Future studies may examine how studies with low retention have used retention strategies and if practical resources can support study teams to improve retention rates. Also, in this study a convenience sample of studies were screened for eligibility from only one institution; hence additional retention strategies may be uncovered if conducted with a larger number of studies from other research centers. Social, cultural and regulatory body acceptance of the retention strategies described may vary by institution and internationally. As these retention strategies are used outside of the US, additional cultural tailoring of retention strategies may be required and should be studied empirically. Finally, the design of our study allowed us to identify strategies that were used together with a high degree of success. However, since these research teams applied multiple strategies we were not able to identify which individual strategies were superior. Given our insights regarding the need to tailor strategies to the context of the target population and other study factors, it is possible that each strategy identified could be implemented and yet retention goals still may not be met in a given study.

Details include preferred name(s), email address. Locating participants Includes a template to log each contact attempt made to participants or their proxies as well as a checklist of search tools for difficult to find research participants. Examples of tools include: \u2022 Ideas and tools on how to locate participants \u2022 Template for detailed documentation of any contact attempts, which is useful for internal communication among research staff but also to track what worked and did not work in the last follow-up visit Follow-up protocols Examples of protocols to facilitate in-person and/or phone visits, and procedures outlining escalating efforts to reach participants.
