Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that this polymorphism increases the production of IL-8. Lee et al. [39] have described that the rs4073 T allele possessed a transcriptional activity twofold to fivefold stronger than the rs4073 A allele, which contributed to the high IL-8 amount as described. Additionally, it has been shown that the IL8 promoter DNA sequence around the position-251 was conformed to the binding motif of C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein) [41, 42] . Then, this functional effect might be related to the fact that the nuclear factors such as C/EBP and GATA bind with high affinity to the IL-8 transcription regulatory sites in the presence of the T allele. However, experimental results suggest that the differences in IL-8 expression are not linked directly to the rs4073 polymorphism [36] . Therefore, other SNPs could be implicated in the transcriptional and translational activities.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 833, "end": 837, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 952, "end": 956, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1313, "end": 1317, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1318, "end": 1321, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1659, "end": 1663, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "For the rs2227306, our findings were consistent to report results in asthma and rheumatoid arthritis [7, 43] .

Hacking et al. [19] observed that C/EBP b preferentially bound in the presence of the rs2227306 T allele in respiratory epithelial cells. C/EBP b has an important role in the regulation of inflammation, and its binding to the regulatory region in the IL8 gene increases significantly the transcription [20, 44] . In our study, the frequency of the less frequent haplotype AT was significantly associated with low asthma childhood risk in our population (P \\ 0.0004).
