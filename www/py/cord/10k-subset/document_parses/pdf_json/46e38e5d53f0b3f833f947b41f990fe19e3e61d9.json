            "text": "Several therapeutic substances, including peptides, have been used in attempts to inhibit or modify transplant arteriosclerosis. One of these synthetic peptides is angiopeptin. It is a stable and long-acting octapeptide, an analogue to somatostatin, with the amino acid sequence: D-Nal-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Thr-NH 2. It has been shown that angiopeptin has an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in rat carotid artery explants [36] and that it also inhibits DNA synthesis in SMCs after balloon angioplasty of the aorta in rabbits [2] . The postulated inhibitory effects of angiopeptin on immune cells are poorly investigated in contrast to the related peptide somatostatin. It is clear that somatostatin inhibits the proliferation of lymphocytes and their natural killer activity [1, 26] . It also inhibits the growth of malignant cells in both established cell lines [27, 34] and primary cultures [4, 24, 35] . Binding sites for somatostatin have been demonstrated in both lymphocytes and monocytes [3, 31] . Definite information on the immunomodulatory effect of angiopeptin is not available [13] . In accelerated transplant arteriosclerosis, it is clear that angiopeptin has an inhibitory effect on myointimal proliferation [13] , but the mechanisms is only partially known. In the development of CVR and spontaneous arteriosclerosis, several growth factors and their receptors, e.g., platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and its receptors, may play an important role [9, 28] . It is known that macrophages can produce PDGF and, thus, stimulate the proliferation of intimal cells [29] . Furthermore, the expression of PDGF receptors may be modified or upregulated by a variety of factors, e.g., transforming growth factor-fi (TGF-fl) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [33] . This suggests an attractive hypothesis, namely, that the inhibitory effect of angiopeptin on myointimal proliferation is caused by the synthesis of growth factors [7] and cytokines secreted by activated lymphocytes and monocytes. Since TGF-fl inhibits proliferation of mesenchymal as well as immune cells and stimulates angiogenesis and the production of matrix proteins [30] , it may be of particular interest in a pathogenetic mechanism of transplant arteriosclerosis.",

Hence, it was possible to separate the influence of immunological factors from that of nonimmunological factors. The purpose of this study was to analyze and characterize the effects of angiopeptin on aortic transplant grafts with regard to the intimal and medial changes, infiltration of inflammatory and noninflammatory cells, and the production of TGF-fl s and PDGE",

The abdominal aorta of each recipient rat was freed just below the renal arteries to the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta. Clamps were then placed on the abdominal aorta at these sites before excising a 10 to 15-ramlong portion for transplantation from each donor rat, as described previously [20] . Portions of allogeneic grafts were stored at 4~ for 1 h in a histidine-buffered preservation solution (Frddin solution) [14] and those of syngeneic grafts for 4 h. Each graft was immediately implanted orthotopically and was anastomosed from the renal arteries to the caudal abdominal aorta using a 9-0 nylon suture (S & T Neuhausen am Rheinfall, Switzerland). The aortic damps were then removed and patency of the new vascular con~ nection was confirmed. After 8 weeks, the rats were anesthetized and the grafts excised. From each recipient rat, 10 to 15-mm-long nontransplanted portions of the thoracic and the abdominal aorta were harvested to serve as negative controls for image analysis and immunohistochemical stains. Each transplanted and nontransplanted portion was divided into two parts, one of which was frozen in a mixture of cold isopentane and dry ice and stored at -70 ~ until processed for immunohistochemistry. The other part was fixed in 4 % buffered formaldehyde at room temperature and embedded in paraffin.

After transplantation of the grafts, immediate treatment with angiopeptin is essential since SMC migration and proliferation occurs within 8 h of vascular injury [11] . For these reasons, infusion of angiopeptin, 100 ~tg/kg per day, (Henri Beaufour Institute, Washington, D. C., USA), was administered continuously to recipient rats by mini-osmotic pumps (Alzet-model 2ML4, Alza Corporation, Palo Alto, Calif., USA) located subcutaneously in the dorsal region (administration 1). In addition, 8 of each 16 allogeneic and 16 syngeneic grafts were immersed in angiopeptin (50 ~g/ml) in the preservation solution before transplantation. Thereafter, rats received angiopeptin treatment by mini-osmotic pumps, as described above (administration 2). The pumps were replaced under anesthesia after 4 weeks.",

Angiopeptin was added to the preservation solution, thus allowing angiopeptin to affect grafts immediately after their excision and also during the ischemic period. This was tested in half of the grafts. However, this procedure had no superior effect on intireal proliferation in comparison to rats receiving angiopeptin by mini-osmotic pumps alone.

            "text": "In our study, angiopeptin did not inhibit intimal thickening in the allogeneic grafts. This lack of effect could be explained by the fact that angiopeptin may have no immunomodulatory effect on immune cells as no additional immunosuppressive regimen was used. Thus, angiopeptin could not reverse the intimal thickening caused by the combination of immunological and inflammatory mechanisms on the driving proliferative forces in the allogeneic grafts. In other models of allogeneic transplantation, angiopeptin was reported to be beneficial. Angiopeptin treatment reduced the development of transplant atherosclerosis in coronary arteries in an allogeneic heart transplantation model both in rabbits [12] and in rats [10] . In both of these models, however, the animals were treated with cyclosporin A immunosuppression. In contrast, Mennander et al. found that angiopeptin reduced both the number of SMCs and the intimal thickening without immunosuppression in an allogeneic aortic graft model. Compared with our results this difference may be explained by the different inbred rat strains used [from WF (AGB a-RT1 u) donors to DA (AGB4-RT1 a) recipients]. However, in their model, the beneficial effect of angiopeptin did not last longer than 3 months in spite of continuous medication, thus leading to final results comparable to ours [22] . We have observed that the media is thinner in the allogeneic grafts than in the syngeneic grafts. The reason for this, as observed by other investigators as well, is probably migration of SMCs [11, 17, 25] and/or medial necrosis due to cytotoxic effects of cell mediators in the allogeneic immunological reaction [20, 21].",

            "text": "9 The CVR-like changes in the syngeneic grafts were induced by the ischemia/reperfusion injury in our model. We were able to demonstrate a beneficial effect of angiopeptin in this syngeneic group. Ischemia/reperfusion injury in grafts has been recognized as crucial for graft outcome [5] . The relevance of this type of injury to the long-term survival of the transplant has recently been studied and the results are still controversial [18, 40] . Previously, with our model, however, a positive correlation between the duration of ischemia and intimal thickening was noted in the syngeneic grafts but not in the allogeneic grafts [38] . Based on our earlier results, the syngeneic grafts were exposed to a prolonged ischemia of 4 h. This syngeneic model represents nonimmunologically induced transplant arteriosclerosis. Angiopeptin may have its main inhibitory effect on cells other than immune cells, such as SMCs and/or en-dothelial cells. It has been proposed that endothelial cells secrete factors that inhibit SMC proliferation in a paracrine fashion. In the absence of these factors, the SMCs may respond to chemotactic and mitogenic signals. It has been suggested that angiopeptin is functionally related to this \"paracrine inhibitor\" [17] . Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how angiopeptin inhibits accelerated arteriosclerosis following vascular injury. These include inhibition of growth factors such as PDGE insulin-like growth factor-i, and epidermal growth factor, and inhibition of the proliferation and migration of SMCs [17] . In the same aortic transplant model, it was found that the expression of PDGF and TGF-fl increases after transplantation (J. Waltenberger et al., unpublished data). The expression of PDGF and TGF-fi s was only studied in the syngeneic grafts, since the inhibitory effects of angiopeptin were morphometrically seen only in the syngeneic grafts. We did not observe any differences in the expression of PDGF-B chain, PDGF c~-receptors, TGF-fi~, TGF-fi3 , or LTBP in control or angiopeptin-treated syngeneic grafts after 8 weeks. However, one cannot exclude the possibility that the expression of these growth factors increased in an earlier phase of transplant arteriosclerosis.",

Immunosuppressive treatment may be required in allograft recipients for angiopeptin to have an inhibitory effect on intimal thickening. Angiopeptin may counteract ischemia/reperfusion-induced chronic vascular rejection and, thus, benefit the long-term survival of transplanted organs.",
