Despite the fact that most EIDs originate in wildlife, few studies account for the population, community, or ecosystem ecology of the host, reservoir, or vector.

            "text": "Definitions of One Health have varied among different authors and institutions, but a defining central tenet is that a One Health approach brings a holistic understanding of health. This broader view includes human medicine, veterinary medicine, and an understanding of the ecological context of health (which we call 'Ecohealth'). To date, One Health approaches have tended to focus on closer collaboration among veterinarians and medical professionals, but remain unclear about how ecological approaches could be applied or how they might benefit public health and disease control. In this chapter, we review ecological concepts, and discuss their relevance to health, with an emphasis on infectious diseases, notably emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). Nearly two-thirds of EIDs are zoonotic, and a majority of those (72 %) originate in wildlife (Anderson et al. 2004; Cleaveland et al. 2001; Daszak 2000) . Diseases are considered 'emerging' if they are identified as occurring in a new geographic area, expanding their incidence rapidly, displaying novel genetic code, or moving into humans for the first time. The most important are pandemics, those that become established in humans and spread internationally. Pandemics tend to be zoonotic, foodborne, or antimicrobial resistant pathogens, and their emergence and spread is overwhelmingly a result of changes in human demography (e.g. travel, population growth), behavior (e.g. drug use), economic activity (e.g. agricultural intensification), or anthropogenic changes to the environment (e.g. land-use change, climate change) (Weiss and McMichael 2004; Jones et al. 2008) . The interactions among these underlying drivers and the dynamics of pathogens in wildlife, livestock, and people are a key focus of studies of the ecology of infectious diseases.",

Population ecology is the study of the population dynamics of a species with relevant metrics of density, natality, mortality, immigration, and emigration (Hall 1988; Murray 1999) . Population dynamics are generated through competition, predation, parasitism, and the distribution of species. Community ecology describes the clustering of populations of species into communities and the processes that dictate composition and diversity. Pertinent community metrics are similarity, continuity, species, and genetic diversity. Ecosystem ecology is the study of biotic and abiotic components of ecological systems, their biophysical interactions, and the flow of energy and materials (Lindeman 1942; Odum 1969; Cook 1977) . The metrics for ecosystems include state, rates, and productivity. Ecosystems provide the framework for organization of species and resource compartments, and modulate rates and dynamics of functions, processes, and services.",

Rarely are they stable or at Fig. 1 Diagram illustrating the ecosystem components described in the text: a node is a population of organisms; edges are links between nodes in a community; and the overall environment including abiotic components is the ecosystem matrix. Nodes are structured vertically into trophic levels and horizontally along an environmental gradient equilibrium, as described by static representations of food chains, trophic guilds, and species dominance. Moreover, they demonstrate non-equilibrium dynamics in a mosaic of patches shifting among stable states when disturbed.

Studying the population dynamics of disease hosts and vectors clearly is important if zoonotic disease emergence is to be understood, but populations need to be studied in the context of edges defining their interactions with other nodes. Indeed, a community approach to disease emergence can reveal important nodes and interactions that differ from those identified in population analyses. For example, some nodes, such as keystone species, may be disproportionally important to the system due to strong connectivity or high centrality. Superspreaders are highly connected and rapidly disseminate disease through a network. Identifying and monitoring the keystone species, superspreaders, and nodes that regulate host and vector abundance is important in disease prevention and control.",

Thus, it is difficult to draw meaningful comparisons among food webs. What is required is a method that generalizes models and captures topological position and functional importance of networks without a food web-specific bias (Olff et al. 2009 ).

Ecosystems provide services such as sequestering toxins in wetlands and sediments, but these processes often are fragile and their disruption results in system-wide impacts. Nutrient enrichment, or eutrophication, of lakes has been directly correlated with prevalence of aquatic disease agents (Johnson and Carpenter 2008) .

For example, minor disturbances from deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon exposed frontier effects, whereby cases of infectious disease peaked with human encroachment, but re-stabilized as humans and pathogens adapted (Olson 2010) . It is difficult to anticipate consequences of ecosystem encroachment since the dynamics are highly variable and outcomes unpredictable. However, in this case the system exhibited altered contact and transmission rates, as well as improved habitat for malaria vectors. Genetic diversity dictates adaptability. We should anticipate widespread physiological, morphological, and behavioral adaptations with land-use change, and inevitable consequences for disease emergence. Geography and landscapes have long been known to play a critical role in disease, indeed the earliest disease maps by Finke and Humboldt date from the Early Victorian Period (Tylianakis et al. 2007 ). Hence, we can anticipate that landscape changes will fundamentally alter existing ecosystem networks. Changes at the landscape level, such as isolation due to habitat fragmentation, counter the trend of more highly connected systems. However, an increase in isolated systems may lead to increased genetic drift and introduce new vulnerabilities from founder effects and genetic bottlenecks. These refugia and biological corridors become hotspots for disease transmission as organisms are crowded out of the human landscape and stressed by reduced resource availability.",

The system has never achieved equilibrium and cannot be explained either by top-down control of moose abundance by wolf predation or bottom-up control of wolf abundance by moose availability (Vucetich et al. 2011) . Moreover, the system exhibits both influences, with episodic disturbances from disease and climate. The introduction of parvovirus by a domestic dog caused the wolf population to crash in 1980. Subsequently, the moose population exploded which impacted balsam fir, their winter food. Consequently, in 1996 the moose population crashed during a harsh winter. Moose are mega-herbivores (Owen-Smith 1988) that grow sufficiently large to escape predation from wolves, so wolves are only able to prey on the young and infirm. The moose are vulnerable to ticks, which contributes to poor body condition and makes them more vulnerable to wolf predation. Ultimately, the dynamics of an invasive disease agent influenced community structure, as did predation, resource availability, parasitism, abiotic conditions, and genetic diversity. These events challenged the certainty of predictive models of population dynamics and community structure. This case study illustrates the difficulty of modeling EIDs in relation to ecosystem dynamics.",

In Malaysia, NiV first emerged in pig farms close to fruit bat habitats. It was hypothesized that the intensive nature of the farms were the trigger for its emergence (Chua et al. 2000 ). An alternative hypothesis was that bats brought the virus into the country from nearby Sumatra following forest fires there during a severe El Nino event (Chua et al. 2002) . A collaborative group including wildlife biologists, veterinarians, virologists, mathematical modelers, physicians, and epidemiologists collected and analyzed data on the hunting of bats, pig population dynamics at the index farm, large-scale movement of fruit bats and the capacity of the virus to survive in urine, saliva, and fruit juices (Pulliam et al. 2011) . This work was able to demonstrate that the continued presence of bats in the index farm region, and the particular dynamics of intensive production allowed the virus to invade the pig farm, produce a partially immune population of pigs, then re-invade to create a long-term exposure of pig workers, and the large-scale outbreak observed (Pulliam et al. 2011) .",

Subsequent investigations involved wildlife biologists who used infrared cameras to confirm contamination in the field (Khan et al. 2011) , and conducted longitudinal surveillance of bat populations to examine whether seasonal patterns exist that could be used to estimate risk. These studies demonstrate the value of analyzing wildlife reservoir ecology in tandem with epidemiological and specific disease investigations. Such an approach will become increasingly important, given the disproportionate rise in EIDs originating from wildlife over the last few decades (Jones et al. 2008) .",
