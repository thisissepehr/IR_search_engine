Persistence of PVB19 in asymptomatic individuals has been reported in skin, synovium, myocardium and bone marrow. A higher level of PVB19 DNA has been observed in various tissues from cases of disease than in controls. Simultaneously, equal detection of PVB19 DNA has been shown in both cases and controls. Thus, it has become fundamental to study PVB19 DNA persistence in tissues that are unaffected by disease. This will help to better understand PVB19 DNA persistence in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and its possible pathogenic role in various diseases. A total of 70 adult autopsies were included and divided into seropositive (SP) and seronegative (SN) groups based on PVB19 IgG. Nested PCR for PVB19 DNA was carried out in myocardium, liver, kidney, and bone marrow. Of the 70 patients, 60 % belonged to the SP group and 40 % to the SN group. Seropositivity ranged from 50 % in the 12 to 20 year old group to 66.7 % in the 61 to 80 year old group.

The virus targets the erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow by binding to the globoside GB4, also known as blood group P antigen.

PVB19 is also known to be involved in diseases such as myocarditis, cardiomyopathy and rheumatoid arthritis. It has emerged as one of the most commonly encountered viral pathogens of dilated cardiomyopathy, which appears to be a late sequela of acute viral myocarditis [7, 11] . Recently PVB 19 has been linked to hepatitis [28] , proliferative glomerulonephritis, and dermatological diseases such as gloves and socks syndrome [31] . According to recent studies, the association of PVB19 with various diseases has been shown by the presence of viral DNA in the affected tissues. However, because PVB19 is a ubiquitous virus, its genome has been reported to be present in some control samples as well [5, 23] . Considering this, the question arises whether myocardial persistence of the PVB19 genome is merely an epiphenomenon or an indication of a latent persistence of the virus, which can then be activated in some individuals by still unknown factors. Recent PCR-based studies have shown that PVB19 DNA may persist in the bone marrow of individuals with serologically documented past PVB19 infection without leading to overt manifestations. Several reports have suggested a pathogenic role for PVB19 in the development of acute hepatitis [9, 10, 13, 30] and fulminant liver failure of unknown pathology [19] . However, whether PVB19 is a pathogenic agent of fulminant liver failure and non-A-E hepatitis or a risk factor accelerating liver dysfunction due to other agents, or alternatively, a bystander with no influence on liver pathology, is still unresolved [29] . Several investigators have attempted to characterize the potential association between PVB19 infection and glomerular disease [18, 27] , although PVB19 DNA has also been detected in seemingly normal control kidneys.

We also analyzed the sera of these patients for a correlation with serostatus, as there are limited data on the seroprevalence of PVB19. We found seropositivity of 60 % (42/70) for PVB19 IgG antibody. This falls in the range of seroprevalence rates of various population-based studies done in India as well as across the globe [1, 22] . The seroprevalence/positivity rate of PVB19 IgG antibody in adults ranged from a minimum of 37.3 % seen in Malaysia [20] to a maximum of 72 % reported in Germany [22] . However, a study by Abraham et al. from South India found a seroprevalence rate of 70 % among 226 patients [1] . The relatively low seropositivity in our study may be attributed to the small sample size (n = 70) as compared to the previous studies. The variation in the seropositivity status in our study and the previous studies from different geographical regions may be due to the usage of different commercial ELISA kits for PVB19 IgG detection. We used a enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Novatec, GmBH), which utilizes parvovirus B19 recombinant antigen for detecting virus-specific IgG, whereas PVB19 IgG ELISA kits used in previous studies have employed VP1-VP2 or NS1 epitopes to determine seropositivity [1, 20, 22] . Thus, the different PVB19 antigens used in the ELISA kits and their sensitivity and specificity might be responsible for differences in seropositivity rates in different studies. We observed that the degree of persistence of PVB19 DNA in the myocardium of asymptomatic individuals was not significant. Also there was no significant relationship between PVB19 DNA persistence and age, sex, underlying disease, or PVB19 serostatus. There is only one autopsybased study [23] that showed a significant difference in the persistence of PVB19 DNA between SP and SN cases. In that study, the investigators found high persistence of PVB19 DNA in SP cases (46/48; 96 %) compared to SN cases (0/21). We carried out nested PCR in 25 cases from the SP group and 10 from the SN group in myocardial tissue. Of these 35 cases, PVB19 DNA was detected in 9 (36 %) of the SP group and in 3 (30 %) of the SN group, which was much lower than what has been reported previously. The difference between the SP and SN groups was not statistically significant. This could be due to a variation in the sample size and epidemiological distribution of the virus. Similar to the previous studies, we amplified the NS1 region of PVB19, which is a conserved region and hence widely used for PVB19 genome detection [3, 6, 9, 19] .
