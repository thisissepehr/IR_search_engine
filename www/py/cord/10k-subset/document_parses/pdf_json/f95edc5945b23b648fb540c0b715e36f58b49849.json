One important precursor currently used for the production of Relenza, an antiviral product from GlaxoSmithKline, is N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc). This substance has a considerably high market price despite efforts to develop cost-reducing (biotechnological) production processes. Hypocrea jecorina (Trichoderma reesei) is a saprophyte noted for its abundant secretion of hydrolytic enzymes and its potential to degrade chitin to its monomer N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). Chitin is considered the second most abundant biomass available on earth and therefore an attractive raw material. Results: In this study, we introduced two enzymes from bacterial origin into Hypocrea, which convert GlcNAc into NeuNAc via N-acetylmannosamine. This enabled the fungus to produce NeuNAc from the cheap starting material chitin in liquid culture. Furthermore, we expressed the two recombinant enzymes as GST-fusion proteins and developed an enzyme assay for monitoring their enzymatic functionality. Finally, we demonstrated that Hypocrea does not metabolize NeuNAc and that no NeuNAc-uptake by the fungus occurs, which are important prerequisites for a potential production strategy. Conclusions: This study is a proof of concept for the possibility to engineer in a filamentous fungus a bacterial enzyme cascade, which is fully functional. Furthermore, it provides the basis for the development of a process for NeuNAc production as well as a general prospective design for production processes that use saprophytes as whole-cell catalysts.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "NeuNAc is the most prevalent exponent of sialic acids [1] . In mammals, sialic acids are usually found as terminal residues of glycol conjugates on the outermost cell surface. As a result of their location and their negative carboxylate functionality, sialic acids play important roles in mediating cellular recognition and adhesion processes [2] and in the infection cycles of severe viral diseases, such as influenza viruses A and B [3] . In these cases, de novo-synthesized viral particles attach to their respective sialic acids at the cell surface. Neuraminidase (sialidase) activity is needed for the propagation of the virus in the host. Consequently, sialic acid derivatives are successfully applied in the therapy of such virus-related diseases. One well-known product that functions as a neuraminidase inhibitor is Relenza. Its active pharmaceutical ingredient is Zanamivir, which is a direct derivative of the NeuNAc precursor [4] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 54, "end": 57, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 343, "end": 346, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 435, "end": 438, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 938, "end": 941, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Traditionally, NeuNAc is prepared through extraction from natural sources, such as bird nests, milk, or eggs [5] , through the hydrolysis of colominic acid (a homopolymer of NeuNAc) in a culture broth of Escherichia coli K1 [6] , or through chemical synthesis [7] .

The estimated annual biosynthesis of chitin is more than 10 11 tons in marine waters alone [15] . Unlike cellulose, the other dominant biopolymer, chitin can serve as a source for both carbon and nitrogen (C:N = 8:1) [16] . This property suggests that chitin is an optimal resource for the production of NeuNAc (C:N = 11:1) because no additional nitrogen would need to be applied as it would be if glucose or cellulose were used as raw material. Chitin is found in the exoskeletons of arthropods, such as crustaceans (including crab, lobster, and shrimp) and insects (including ants and beetles), the cell walls of fungi, the radula of mollusks, and the beaks of cephalopods (including squid and octopi). This polymer is composed of \u03b2-(1,4)-linked units of the amino sugar N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) that is currently produced using hydrolysis of deproteinized and demineralized crustacean shells [17] . Chitinolytic enzymes from fungi of the genus Hypocrea have been extensively studied for decades [18] . More recently, the chitinolytic enzyme system of H. jecorina has been studied using genome-wide analysis [19, 20] . Unlike their bacterial counterparts (e.g., Serratia marcescens [21] ), Hypocrea chitinolytic preparations have a high ratio of exochitinase to endochitinase activity and almost exclusively release monomeric GlcNAc from chitin [22] , which is another advantageous aspect of chitin compared to cellulose. Nevertheless, this raw material has not been adequately used. Therefore, the basic premise of this study was to exploit the potential of a saprophytic fungus to degrade the cheap biowaste chitin to its monomer GlcNAc and to further metabolize this product to NeuNAc.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 73, "end": 77, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 137, "end": 142, "text": "10 11", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 171, "end": 175, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 297, "end": 301, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 979, "end": 983, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1082, "end": 1086, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1194, "end": 1198, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1202, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1272, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1431, "end": 1435, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Engineering a NeuNAc synthesis pathway into Hypocrea", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results and Discussion"}, {"text": "The biosynthesis of NeuNAc begins with the formation of N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) from GlcNAc or UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc).

The second step involves the condensation of either ManNAc (in bacteria) or Mac-NAc-6P (in mammals) with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to give NeuNAc or NeuNAc-9P, respectively. In mammals, NeuNAc-9P is then dephosphorylated to generate NeuNAc (see Figure 1 ). Hypocrea naturally degrades chitin almost exclusively to GlcNAc [22] . Therefore, the challenge was to engineer a pathway to convert GlcNAc to NeuNAc via ManNAc, which would enable the use of Hypocrea as a whole-cell catalyst.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 540, "end": 544, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 464, "end": 472, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Results and Discussion"}, {"text": "Lee and coworkers found that whole-cell extracts of several photobacteria could convert GlcNAc to ManNAc [13] .

CH1 (E.C. 5.1.3.8), which was used in the present study as a Hypocrea codon-optimized gene. For the second step (the condensation of ManNAc to NeuNAc), the currently used enzyme-catalyzed processes use a lyase, which requires an excess of pyruvate. Use of this incurs high downstream processing costs. Therefore, we used the NeuNAc synthase (EC 2.5.1.56) from Campylobacter jejuni [23] in the Hyprocrea process. This enzymatic step entails the use of PEP instead of pyruvate, which in the intended in vivo process is supplied by the fungus, thereby leading to an irreversible and more efficient reaction towards NeuNAc [24] . Moreover, the need for an excess of pyruvate becomes obsolete, and the resulting downstream process is significantly simplified. Similar to the GlcNAc 2-epimerase, the coding sequence for the NeuNAc synthase was codon-optimized for the usage in Hypocrea. The synthetic pathway is presented in Figure 1 .
