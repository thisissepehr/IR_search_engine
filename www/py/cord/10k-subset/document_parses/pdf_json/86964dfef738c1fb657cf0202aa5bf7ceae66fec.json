            "text": "Rotavirus (RV) is a major foodborne pathogen. For RV prevention and control, it is a key to uncover the interaction mechanism between virus and its receptors. However, it is hard to specially purify the viral receptors, including histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). Previously, the protruding domain protein (P protein) of human norovirus (genotype II.4) was displayed on the surface of Escherichia coli, and it specifically recognized and captured the viral ligands. In order to further verify the feasibility of the system, P protein was replaced by VP8* of RV (G9P[8]) in this study. In the system, VP8* could be correctly released by thrombin treatment with antigenicity retaining, which was confirmed by Western blot and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays. Type A HBGAs from porcine gastric mucin (PGM) were recognized and captured by this system. From saliva mixture, the captured viral receptor bound with displayed VP8* was confirmed positive with monoclonal antibody against type A HBGAs. It indicated that the target ligands could be easily separated from the complex matrix. These results demonstrate that the bacterial surface display system will be an effective platform to explore viral receptors/ligands from cell lines or food matrix.",

The RV genome consists of 11 segmental genes encoding a total of 6 structural proteins (VP1-4, VP6, VP7) and 6 non-structural proteins (NSP1-6) (Nakagomi and Nakagomi 2009 ). VP4, an outer capsid protein, is cleaved by a protease to VP5* and VP8* (Patton et al. 1993) , of which VP8* is mainly involved in receptor recognition (M\u00e9ndez et al. 1999) . Studies have shown that VP8* recognizes sialic acid, which helps the virion to anchor to the cell surface, thereby mediating virus invasion into host cells (Sugiyama et al. 2004) . Therefore, VP8* is the primary mediator of interaction between RV and host cell surface receptors.",

HBGAs play important roles in RV infection. Through the saliva-and oligosaccharide-based binding assays, HBGAs were recognized by RV VP8*, which was genotype-dependent (Huang et al. 2012) . HBGAs can also be used as a polysaccharide receptor of some pathogenic microorganisms such as HuNoVs, RV and Helicobacter Pylori, which are related to the susceptibility of some infectious diseases (Harrington et al. 2004; Huang et al. 2012; Ilver et al. 1998) . Barb\u00e9 et al. (2018) reported that most VP8* from P[8] strains are more likely to bind to type Lewis b HBGA than to type A HBGA. However, other researchers also demonstrated that Lewis b and H type-1 HBGA were not involved in the recognition of common human rotaviruses (B\u00f6hm et al. 2015) . Therefore, the exactly interactions between different genotypes of rotavirus and HBGAs are still unclear. Our lab is focusing on the study of the ligands/receptors that involved in the specially recognition of HuNoVs. We proposed that the substances that recognized by MAbs of HBGAs were some HBGAs-like substances instead of HBGAs. We have identified a HBGAs-like oligosaccharide (m/z: 1042, H2N2F2), separated from romaine lettuce extract and PGM, was involved in specific binding to HuNoVs particles with the help of bacterial surface display system. The structure of this oligosaccharide is a chimera of type A and Lewis a HBGA, which also contained the active structure of type H HBGA. We have demonstrated a completely new theory that the receptor for HuNoVs is not limited to HBGAs, but is indeed composed of HBGAs-like similar composition (data under review).",

After incubation and treatment by thrombin, the VP8*-receptor complex could be easily collected by low-speed centrifugation. The thrombin-released complex could be recognized by MAb (BG2) for type A HBGAs. It is consistent with the results we reported before that HuNoVs bacterial surface display system was able to capture and easily isolate viral receptors. The capacity to specifically enrich and purify receptors/ligands of expressed protein with this system has been further verified. To make clear the composition of the receptors/ ligands (including HBGAs), we are excavating the viral receptors from the MA 104 cell lines by using the developed VP8* cell surface display system. We believe that this system can be applied to other viral proteins and it is helpful for the discovery and identification of receptors of other pathogens.",
