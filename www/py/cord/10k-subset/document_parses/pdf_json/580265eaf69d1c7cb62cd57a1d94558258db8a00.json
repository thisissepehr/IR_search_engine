Further, the polar side-chains are divided into three main groups: uncharged polar, positively charged, or basic side-chains, and negatively charged or acidic side-chains. Within any single group, there are considerable variations in the size, shape and properties of the side-chains. Peptides containing ionizable (acidic and basic) side-chains have a characteristic isoelectric point (pI) and the overall net charge and polarity of a peptide in aqueous solution will vary with pH. Thus, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, as well as the number of charged groups present, become important factors in the separation of peptides. Intrinsic amino acid side-chain hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity coefficients have been recently published (10), and these reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC derived values at pH 2.0 and pH 7.0 are shown in Table 1 . \"Intrinsic\" implies the maximum possible hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of side-chains in the absence of nearestneighbor or conformational effects that would decrease the full expression of the side-chain hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity when the side-chain is in a polypeptide chain. Such a scale is the fundamental starting point for determining the parameters that affect side-chain hydrophobicity for quantifying such effects in peptides and proteins (e.g., the quantitative evaluation of the contribution of a specific amino side-chain to ligand-protein and protein-protein interactions and to protein folding and stability) and in aiding the development of protocols for optimum separation of polypeptides.

However, such columns have still proven useful in the early stages of a peptide purification protocol (i.e., in the early stages of a multi-step purification protocol) or for peptide/protein separations (2,17,31-34) . The introduction of a size-exclusion column designed specifically for peptide separations (molecular weight range 100-7000) has raised the profile of this HPLC mode for peptide analysis in recent years (35). HPLC have been employed for peptide and protein separations, negatively charged and positively charged solutes, respectively, being retained by these ion-exchange modes. Common anion-exchange packings consist of primary, secondary, and tertiary (weak AEX) or quaternary amine (strong AEX) groups adsorbed or covalently bound to a support. These positively charged packings will interact with acidic (negatively charged) peptide residues (aspartic and glutamic acid above \u223cpH 4.0), as well as the negatively charged C-terminal -carboxyl group. Common cation-exchange packings consist of carboxyl (weak CEX) or sulfonate (strong CEX) groups bound to a support matrix. These negatively charged packings will interact with the basic (positively charged) residues (histidine, pH < 6 0; arginine, pH < 12 0, and lysine, pH < 10 0), as well as the positively charged N-terminal -amino group. Should a choice need to be made concerning the type of ion-exchange column for general peptide applications, a strong cation-exchange column is recommended. The utility of such a column lies in its ability to retain its negatively charged character in the acidic and neutral pH range, which is due to the strongly acidic sulfonate functionality characteristic of such a packing. Most peptides are soluble at low pH, where the side-chain carboxyl groups of acidic residues (glutamic acid, aspartic acid) and the free C-terminal -carboxyl group are protonated (i.e., uncharged), thus emphasizing any basic, positively charged character of the peptides.

Thus, HILIC/CEX combines the most advantageous aspects of two widely different separation mechanisms, i.e., a separation based on hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity differences between peptides overlaid on a separation based on net charge (19-30). Characteristic of HILIC/CEX separations is the presence of a high organic modifier concentration (generally, acetonitrile) to promote hydrophilic interactions between the solute and the hydrophilic/charged cation-exchange stationary phase. Peptides are then eluted from the column with a salt gradient. Generally, peptides are eluted in groups of peptides in order of increasing net positive charge.

In Fig. 4 , similarly charged species are not necessarily eluted at similar times: the 50-residue peptide (+5; Fig. 4A) is not retained as long as the 11-residue +3 and +4 peptides (Fig. 4B) ; the 40-residue peptide (+4; Fig. 4A ) is eluted prior to the 11-residue +3 peptide (Fig. 4B ). 4. The comparative retention behavior of the peptides of different chain length and charge density is linearized by an elution time vs net charge/1nN plot (N = number of residues) (Fig. 4C) . This simple linearization approach is important for the prediction of peptide retention behavior where the net charge is known.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 836, "end": 845, "text": "In Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 942, "end": 955, "text": "(+5; Fig. 4A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 1017, "end": 1026, "text": "(Fig. 4B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 1052, "end": 1064, "text": "(+4; Fig. 4A", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 1112, "end": 1120, "text": "(Fig. 4B", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 1304, "end": 1313, "text": "(Fig. 4C)", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}], "section": "Monitoring of Peptide Chain Length Effects on CEX Using Synthetic Peptide Standards"}, {"text": "In the authors' experience, the best approach to most analytical peptide separations is to employ aqueous TFA to TFA/CH 3 CN linear gradients (pH 2.0) at room temperature. Peptide resolution can be optimized by varying the steepness of the acetonitrile gradient (generally, 0.5-2.0% CH 3 CN/min) and the volatility of TFA eliminates the need for subsequent sample desalting. TFA is also effective in separating complex peptide mixtures because of its ionpairing properties. Peptides are charged molecules at most pH values and the presence of different counterions will influence their chromatographic behavior. Thus, anionic counterions (e.g., TFA \u2212 , phosphate) will interact with the protonated basic (i.e., positively charged) residues of a peptide. In comparison, a cationic counterion (e.g., trimethylammonium, triethylammonium, tetrabutylammonium) will show an affinity for ionized carboxyl (i.e., negatively charged) groups. Recently, we determined the optimum TFA concentration for peptide separations to be 0.2-0.25% TFA, significantly higher than the traditionally employed concentration range of 0.05-0.1% (71). Table 4. 2. The peptides are eluted from a Kromasil C 18 column (Column 5 on Instrument 1) at pH 2.0 by a linear AB gradient (0.25% CH 3 CN/min) at a flow-rate of 0.3 mL/min and a temperature of 25 C, where eluent A is 20 mM aqueous TFA, pH 2.0 containing 2% acetonitrile, and eluent B is 20 mM TFA in CH 3 CN (Fig. 5A) . Some \"wetting\" of the stationary phase, particularly highly hydrophobic and high-liganddensity phases such as the Kromasil C 18 packing, is occasionally required to ensure reproducible results. 3. These same peptides are eluted from a Zorbax XDB-C 8 column (Column 6) at pH 7.0 by a linear AB gradient (0.25% CH 3 CN/min) at a flow-rate of 0.3 mL/min and a temperature of 25 C, where eluent A is 10 mM aqueous NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.0 and eluent B is eluent A containing 50% CH 3 CN, both eluents also containing 50 mM NaCl (Fig. 5B ). 4. The resulting intrinsic hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity coefficients are reported in Table 1 as t R (Gly) values, where t R (Gly) denotes the change in retention time relative to the Gly-substituted peptide. These coefficients are independent of pH, buffer conditions, ion-pairing reagents, or whether a C 8 or C 18 column was used for 17 (uncharged) side-chains and are dependent on pH, buffer conditions, and ion-pairing reagents for potentially charged side-chains (Orn, Lys, His, Arg, Asp and Glu) (Fig. 5C) . For a detailed discussion of the importance of these side-chain hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity coefficients in the peptide and protein field, together with validation of these values, see our recent publication (10). 5 . The correlation of the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity values for the 17 uncharged side-chains at pH 2.0 and pH 7.0 was excellent as expected R = 0 998 (10). The relative hydrophobicities of the acidic side-chains (Asp and Glu) decrease with an increase in pH due to deprotonation (ionization) of these side-chains at pH 7.0 (the pK a of these side-chains is \u223c4.0), that is, they become negatively charged and more hydrophilic. In contrast, the His side-chain is essentially deprotonated at pH 7.0 (pK a \u223c6.0) and thus no longer positively charged, i.e., its hydrophobicity increases dramatically. The dramatic increase in the hydrophobicity of the Arg side-chain with the change in pH from 2.0 to 7.0 is due to differences in effectiveness of the counterions TFA and H 2 PO \u22122 4 anions to neutralize the positive charge of the Arg side-chain at pH 2.0 and pH 7.0, respectively. The H 2 PO \u22122 4 anion more effectively neutralizes the positive charge at pH 7.0, thus increasing the relative hydrophobicity of the Arg side-chain. In the case of the alkyl amino groups on the side-chains of Orn and Lys, the increase in hydrophilicity (decrease in hydrophobicity) at pH 7.0 relative to pH 2.0 is again due to differences in the effectiveness of these two anions to ion-pair with these side-chains. The side-chains of Lys and Orn more effectively ion-pair with the TFA anion (hydrophobic ion-pairing reagent) than the H 2 PO \u22122 4 ; thus, these side-chains are more hydrophobic at pH 2.0 than pH 7.0. The physicochemical properties of the guanidinium group of Arg and the alkyl amino groups of Lys and Orn are quite different. These results clearly demonstrate that Arg and Lys side-chains, although both positively charged at pH 2.0 and pH 7.0, behave differently with buffer anions, which affects their hydrophilicities/hydrophobicities differently. Thus, Arg and Lys residues on the surface of proteins should not be considered equivalent at neutral pH.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2708, "end": 2709, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2780, "end": 2792, "text": "17 uncharged", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1124, "end": 1132, "text": "Table 4.", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}, {"start": 1434, "end": 1443, "text": "(Fig. 5A)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1965, "end": 1973, "text": "(Fig. 5B", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2063, "end": 2070, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 2480, "end": 2489, "text": "(Fig. 5C)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Reversed-Phase HPLC"}, {"text": "1.

As noted above (Subheading 3.4.1.) , a mixture of 27 peptides is designed as synthetic proteomic peptide standards. These peptides are comprised of three groups of nine 10-residue peptides (with net charges of +1, +2, and +3 for all nine peptides within a group), the hydrophobicity of the nine peptides within a group varying only subtly between adjacent peptides. The sequences and characteristics of the peptide standards are shown and described in Table 6 and under Subheading 3.4.1. Figure 12 shows the RP-HPLC separation of the peptide standards on a Zorbax SB300-C 8 column (Column 8 on Instrument 1) obtained by a linear AB gradient (0.5% CH 3 CN/min) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min and a temperature of 70 C, where eluent A is 20 mM aqueous TFA, pH 2.0, and eluent B is 20 mM TFA in 80% (v/v) aqueous CH 3 CN. 3. The conditions for RP-HPLC (an efficient ion-pairing reagent, relatively shallow gradient, high temperature, small packing particle size of 3.5 m) are designed to optimize the separation. However, despite the reasonably satisfactory analytical elution profile, just 13 out of 27 peptides are well resolved. It is unlikely that this unidimensional approach to the separation of the peptides can be optimized further to achieve complete (or even near complete) resolution of all 27 peptides. 4. Figure 13 shows the separation of the 27 peptides by CE in analogous conditions to that of RP-HPLC (i.e., with aqueous TFA as the background electrolyte [BGE] in the absence or presence of CH 3 CN, albeit in the absence of a hydrophobic surface (uncoated capillary). Fig. 13 : uncoated capillary (Capillary 1 on Instrument 4); BGE of 10 mM aqueous TFA, adjusted to pH 2.0 with LiOH, with or without 25% (v/v) CH 3 CN; applied voltage, 25 kV (direct polarity) with 5-min voltage ramp; temperature, 15 C; UV absorption at 195 nm. 6. As shown in Fig. 13 , both in the absence (top panel) and presence (bottom panel) of 25% CH 3 CN, the peptides are separated according to their charge-to-mass ratio (capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) mechanism), each peak representing nine co-migrated peptides. The mobility of these three groups of peptides is according to net charge, i.e., as expected, the +3 group migrates faster than the +2 group, which migrates faster than the +1 group. 7. Figure 13 represents a unidimensional CE separation, where peptide separation is achieved/optimized via a single peptide property (charge) and via a single charge-based mechanism (CZE). This laboratory believes that the introduction of a hydrophobicity-based mechanism, to produce a bidimensional separation, would enable an effective peptide separation. Fig. 14 , an excellent separation of the 27 peptides is now achieved, with increasing ion-pairing reagent hydrophobicity (TFA < PFPA < HFBA) resulting in improved resolution. 10. These separations represent bidimensional separations: peptides of the same length but different nominal charge are separated in order of decreasing charge (i.e., +3 peptides migrate the earliest and +1 peptides migrate the last) according to a CZE mechanism; within each group of peptides, the peptides are separated in order of increasing hydrophobicity according to a hydrophobically mediated mechanism introduced by the anionic ion-pairing reagent, i.e., within each charged group of peptides, the most hydrophobic peptide is eluted last and the most hydrophilic peptide is eluted first., analogous to that seen in RP-HPLC (Fig. 7) . 11. This novel CE approach has been termed ion-interaction (II)CZE and is clearly superior to RP-HPLC (Fig. 12) for separation of these peptide standards. This CE approach also exhibits a much larger peak capacity than RP-HPLC, as seen by the large distance between the +2 and +1 peptide groups, where peptides of different charge-to-mass ratios could be located. 12. It should be noted that only one pair of peptides with identical charge-to-mass ratios (denoted 1e/1f) was not resolved in the presence of 0.4 M HFBA. However, two other peptide pairs with identical charge-to-mass ratios (one pair in each of the +2 and +3 peptides; 2e/2f and 3e/3f, respectively) are resolved under these conditions, a significant achievement when one considers that such separations were hitherto believed impossible. 13. Interestingly, as noted previously (Subheading 3.4.1.) , the best overall resolution of the peptides within each group is achieved by HILIC/CEX. The high peak capacity of the II-CZE and HILIC/CEX approaches, coupled with their excellent resolution capabilities, again highlight their useful complementarity (and often superior separative effectiveness) to the ubiquitous RP-HPLC mode.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1469, "end": 1474, "text": "[BGE]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 18, "end": 37, "text": "(Subheading 3.4.1.)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 455, "end": 462, "text": "Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF7"}, {"start": 491, "end": 500, "text": "Figure 12", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1316, "end": 1325, "text": "Figure 13", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1583, "end": 1590, "text": "Fig. 13", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1859, "end": 1866, "text": "Fig. 13", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2298, "end": 2307, "text": "Figure 13", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2653, "end": 2660, "text": "Fig. 14", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 3459, "end": 3467, "text": "(Fig. 7)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3572, "end": 3581, "text": "(Fig. 12)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 4313, "end": 4332, "text": "(Subheading 3.4.1.)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Capillary Electrophoresis"}, {"text": "The excellent resolving power and separation time of RP-HPLC, coupled with the availability of volatile mobile phases, has made this HPLC mode the favored method for preparative separations of peptides. Also, most researchers would likely wish to carry out both analytical and preparative peptide separations on analytical equipment and columns no longer than 250 mm and no larger diameters than 10 mm ID, avoiding the prohibitively expense scale-up costs in terms of equipment, larger columns and solvent consumption. It has long been a goal of this laboratory to develop novel one-step purification schemes to avoid loss of product yield frequently a feature of multistep protocols (e.g., SEC followed by IEX and RP-HPLC). 4. The synthetic crude peptide is applied (100 mg and 200 mg sample amounts) to a Zorbax SB300-C 8 semipreparative RP-HPLC column (Column 9 on Instrument 3). A linear AB gradient (1% CH 3 CN/min for 30 min, followed by 0.1% CH 3 CN/min for 150 min, followed by 1% CH 3 CN/min for 30 min) at a flow rate of 2 mL/min and room temperature, where eluent A is 0.2% aqueous TFA, pH 2, and eluent B is 0.2% TFA in CH 3 CN. To design the gradient method, a \"rule of thumb\" has been developed. The researcher determines the percentage acetonitrile required to elute the peptide of interest by running the crude peptide on an analytical column at 1% CH 3 CN per min. In the present case, the peptide of interest is eluted at 42% CH 3 CN. To establish the percentage CH 3 CN at which the 0.1% CH 3 CN gradient begins, the rule of thumb is to start 12% below that required to elute the peptide in the 1% gradient run. Thus, the gradient for the preparative run is 0 to 30% acetonitrile at 1% acetonitrile/min (30% is 12% below 42%), then begin the gradient of 0.1% CH 3 CN per min for 150 min (increase of 15% CH 3 CN) followed by 1% CH 3 CN per min for 30 min to wash the remaining hydrophobic impurities off the column. 5. Fractions are collected every 2 min and fraction analysis carried out under the same conditions described for Fig. 15 . Fractions are repooled as hydrophilic impurities, pure product and hydrophobic impurities (Fig. 16A, B , and C, respectively). These three pools are then lyophilized, redissolved in water (10 mL) and reanalyzed by RP-HPLC (5 L sample volumes; same conditions as described for Fig. 15 ). 6. Figure 16 shows the excellent product purity and yield obtained by this slow gradient approach to purification of the 200-mg sample load (Fig. 16B) . Very little product is found in the hydrophilic fraction (Fig. 16A ) and hydrophobic fraction (Fig. 16C) . 7. Figure 17 illustrates fraction analyses of adjacent fractions at the beginning and end of product appearance for both the 100 mg (top panels) and 200 mg (bottom panels) sample amounts. Note that only one fraction for each sample amount contained overlapping product and hydrophilic impurities (Fr. 63 and Fr. 54 for 100-mg and 200-mg runs, respectively) or overlapping product and hydrophobic impurities (Fr. 75 and Fr. 71 for 100-mg and 200-mg runs, respectively), underlying the effectiveness of this slow gradient approach for resolution of desired peptide product from even closely structurally related synthetic impurities. 8. It should be noted that the greater the sample load, the sooner the appearance of desired peptide product eluted from the column, i.e., Fr. 54 for a 200-mg load vs Fr. 63 for a 100-mg load. In addition, the larger the load, the greater the number of fractions needed for product elution (13 fractions for the 100 mg load and 18 fractions for the 200-mg load). 9.

However, for larger scale applications, where it is of particular importance to maximize, for cost purposes, yield of purified material per gram of RP-HPLC stationary phase, we wish to direct readers to our novel preparative approach termed sample displacement chromatography (SDC), characterized by the major separation process generally taking place in the absence of organic modifier concomitant with optimum utilization of RP-HPLC column capacity (85-89).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Alternative Preparative RP-HPLC Purification Approaches on Analytical Columns and Instrumentation"}, {"text": "3.6.3.1. One-Step SDC of Peptides 1. Conventional reversed-phase SDC is conceived as a novel purification approach on high-performance analytical columns and instrumentation, where the only variable is sample load, i.e., without the addition of organic modifier or displacer (the latter being characteristic of traditional displacement chromatography (90)) to the mobile phase (85-89). 2. Because peptides favor an adsorption-desorption mechanism of interaction with a hydrophobic stationary phase, under normal analytical load conditions an organic modifier is typically required for their elution from a reversed-phase column. However, when such a column is subjected to high loading of a peptide mixture dissolved in a 100% aqueous mobile phase, e.g., 0.1% aqueous TFA, there is competition by the sample components for the adsorption sites on the reversed-phase sorbent, resulting in solute-solute displacement during washing with 100% aqueous mobile phase. A more hydrophobic peptide component competes more successfully for these sites than a less hydrophobic component, which is thus displaced ahead of the more hydrophobic solute, i.e., the sample components acts as their own displacers. 3. The SDC approach is thus simply an application of the well established general principles of displacement chromatography without the need for a separate displacer. This mode of operation, a hybrid scheme of frontal chromatography followed by elution, is characterized by a marked reduction in solvent consumption, minimal elution volumes, and the collection of fewer fractions for product isolation than in conventional RP-HPLC, with consequence reductions in time and handling. 4. Several successful SDC separations have been reported (85-89), including the purification of a therapeutically important synthetic peptide representing part of the sequence of luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) (88). 5. SDC has also been adapted to modular solid-phase extraction (SPE) technology for development of a rapid, simple and cost-effective procedure for the efficient and parallel purification of multiple peptide mixtures (91). 6 . An interesting application of anion-exchange chromatography in sample displacement mode for protein purification has also been reported (92).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2131, "end": 2132, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Alternative Preparative RP-HPLC Purification Approaches on Analytical Columns and Instrumentation"}, {"text": "Step SDC of Peptides 1.

Although highly pure TEA can be readily purchased, the authors' laboratory has regularly used lesser-grade reagent (following distillation over ninhydrin, where necessary) with no discernible problems. 2. Occasionally, it has been necessary to remove UV-absorbing contaminants from reagent-grade NaClO 4 by passing a stock solution of the salt through a preparative (e.g., 1 cm ID) RP-HPLC column (following filtration through a 0.22-m filter). 3. The unusually high concentration of acetonitrile (40%) is required to eliminate nonideal behavior because of the considerable hydrophobic characteristics of the column packing. Other CEX packings are available that are hydrophilic and require considerably less acetonitrile or no acetonitrile in the mobile phase. In general, it is preferable to have each HPLC mode utilize just a single mechanism, i.e., ion-exchange mechanism only, in the absence of any nonspecific hydrophobic interactions which could complicate interpretation of results. 4. Fifty percent of all -helices in proteins are amphipathic (77). 5 . In a similar manner to the effect of the hydrophobic environment characteristic of RP-HPLC in inducing helical structure in potential -helical peptides, the presence of a high concentration (70% in this case) of organic modifier in HILIC/CEX will also induce such structure.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1061, "end": 1062, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Notes"}]}
