            "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI)-triggered pulmonary injury has been associated with high mortality, despite advances in drug treatment and supportive therapy. Remarkable progress has been made in attenuating the inflammatory injury associated with ALI using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based cell and gene therapy. However, to date, the benefits of interleukin-35 (IL-35)-modified MSCs in ALI intervention have not been investigated. In the present study, adult male C57BL/6 mice randomly received intravenous infusion of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) constitutively expressing IL-35 (IL-35-GFP-ADSCs) or GFP (GFP-ADSCs) via retrovirus-mediated transduction (8 \u00d7 10 5 cells per mice) or isotonic saline 7 days before ALI modeling to investigate the effect and related mechanism. ALI was performed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhalation for 24 h. Normal mice served as the sham group. The results indicated that compared with GFP-ADSCs, IL-35-modified ADSCs significantly increased cellular and pulmonary IL-10 and IL-35 production. Pretreatment with IL-35-ADSCs markedly reduced body weight loss, pulmonary wet/dry weight ratio and pathological injury. The PO 2 was rescued to normal levels in mice that received IL-35-ADSCs. IL-35-ADSCs infusion apparently inhibited IL-6 release, protein leakage and MPO activity but greatly elevated IL-35 level in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Splenic regulatory T cells in IL-35-ADSCs-pretreated mice got effective increase. Moreover, IL-35-ADSCs pretreatment remarkably inhibited neutrophil and macrophage infiltration and greatly decreased IL-6, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression. In conclusion, pretreatment with IL-35-engineered ADSCs provided effective protection against LPSinduced ALI through suppression of pulmonary inflammation and, thus, might be a promising strategy to improve outcomes after ALI. The enhanced paracrine and immunosuppressive capacity of IL-35-ADSCs might contribute to their beneficial effects. However, further studies are needed to illuminate the detailed mechanism.",

Modification of certain anti-inflammatory genes, such as IL-10 (Wang et al. 2018a) , nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) (Zhang et al. 2018b ) and heme oxygenase (HO-1) (Chen et al. 2019) , can further enhance the immunosuppressive potential of MSCs and achieve better outcomes in ALI intervention.

Cells were routinely cultured in high-glucose DMEM (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA) and 5000 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin (PS, Gibco, USA). Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) were isolated from 6-week-old mice as described previously (Yao et al. 2015) . In brief, cells from adipose tissues near the groin and epididymis were adherently cultured in \u03b1MEM (Gibco, USA) containing 20% FBS and 5000 U/mL PS. The culture medium was replaced every three days until the cell confluence reached approximately 90%. The 3rd passage cells identified by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) after staining of surface markers were used for gene modification. Briefly, about 1 \u00d7 10 5 ADSCs per sample were resuspended in 50-\u03bcL PBS and incubated with 2-\u03bcL phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antibodies CD29 and CD44 (eBioscience, USA), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated CD45 (eBioscience, USA) and CD90.1 (eBioscience, USA) antibodies separately for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C in the dark. Then, the cell suspension was centrifuged and subsequently washed with PBS and fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The staining positive cells were detected by a flow cytometer (BD FACS Calibur, USA) and cells without any label served as negative control. Data were analyzed by FlowJo software (version 7.6.1, USA).",

One day before transfection, HEK293T cells were plated, and the cell fusion rate was approximately 80% after 24 h. HEK293T cells were transfected using FuGENE \u00ae HD Transfection Regent (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specifically, the retroviral vector pMSCV-IL-35-GFP or pMSCV-GFP combined with another two helper plasmids and FuGENE were dissolved in equal volume of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, USA) medium, respectively. Then, the plasmids and transfection reagent were mixed for 20 min at room temperature. The mixture was evenly added to HEK293T cells maintained in 5-mL Opti-MEM medium and incubated in 5% CO 2 at 37 \u00b0C. After 6 h, another 5-mL fresh DMEM medium containing 10% FBS was supplemented and the cells were continued to be cultured for 48 h. The supernatant rich in retrovirus particles was collected, followed by centrifugation at 1500\u00d7g for 10 min and filtering through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter. Then, the filtrates were condensed at 10:1 ratio using a 100-kDa evaporating column (Millipore, USA). ADSCs at the 3rd passage were exposed to 1-mL of concentrated IL-35-GFP or GFP virus in 2-mL of medium for 6 h in 10-cm cell culture dishes in the presence of 8 \u03bcg/mL polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and were expanded to the 4th passage. The transfection efficiency of ADSCs modified by IL-35 (IL-35-ADSCs) or GFP (GFP-ADSCs) and the exogenous gene expression were determined via FACS and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) before cell injection. In addition, the culture medium of IL-35-ADSCs and GFP-ADSCs was collected 48 h post transfection to detect the concentration of IL-10.",

The level of both the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-35 and IL-10 was apparently elevated in IL-35-ADSCs, suggesting heightened paracrine action. Since intravenously delivered MSCs tend to be arrested in the lungs during circulation and have the ability to migrate and home to sites suffering injury (Soliman et al. 2018; Tian et al. 2015) , pretreatment with IL-35-ADSCs might confer better protection to the lungs. Here, we first studied the protective effect of systemically pre-infused IL-35-ADSCs on the acute phase of LPS-induced ALI animals (Fig. 2a) .",

Mice in the saline + LPS group exhibited typical symptoms of ALI, including weight loss, a significant increase in pulmonary wet/dry weight ratio, damaged ventilation function and severe pathological injury (Fig. 2b-d) . ADSCs pretreatment relieved these manifestations to different degrees. Compared with GFP-ADSCs treatment, mice that received IL-35-AD-SCs showed a markedly reduced pulmonary wet/dry weight ratio (Fig. 2b) and BALF protein content (Fig. 3c) , suggesting well-controlled pulmonary edema and protein leakage. The PO 2 in IL-35-ADSCs-treated mice reached normal levels and was much higher than that in GFP-ADSCs + LPS mice (Fig. 2c) . Alveolar hemorrhage, fluid exudation and inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs were also noticeably attenuated (Fig. 2d) . The pulmonary level of IL-10 and IL-35 both showed a significant increase 24 h post ALI exposure (Fig. 3a) . As reliable biomarkers of ALI animals or patients, pulmonary IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were also most effectively inhibited in mice that received IL-35-ADSCs (Fig. 5a) . Similar to the H&E staining results, many more MPO + neutrophils and CD68 + macrophages could be observed in the lungs from saline + LPS mice, and ADSCs injection effectively inhibited these infiltrates (Fig. 6a) . Lungs treated with IL-35-ADSCs exhibited significantly decreased neutrophil and macrophage accumulation compared with that in GFP-ADSCs + LPS group lungs (Fig. 6b ). In addition, IL-35-ADSCs infusion greatly suppressed TLR4 expression compared with that in GFP-ADSC-treated mice (Fig. 7) . These data indicate that IL-35-ADSCs pretreatment effectively attenuated local inflammation in LPS-challenged lungs.",

Compared with GFP-ADSCs + LPS group mice, the number of splenic CD4 + CD25 + Tregs was remarkably amplified in IL-35-ADSCs-treated mice, primarily due to the elevated IL-35 level (Fig. 4) . It has been reported that Th17 cells-mediated inflammation also participate in the inflammatory process of ALI, and the unbalanced Tregs/Th17 cells often exist in ALI animals or patients Zhang et al. 2016) . Reversed Tregs/Th17 cells contribute to amelioration of the damage induced by ALI. The Th17 cells was not detected here, but we have found that IL-35 upregulation significantly increased CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + Treg cells and reduced IL-17A + Th17 cells of the spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis models ). The growth of Tregs might also facilitate the ALI inhibition.",
