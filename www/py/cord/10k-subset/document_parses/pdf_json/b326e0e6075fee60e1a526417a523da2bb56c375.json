Viral infections are a major cause of exacerbations of asthma in children, but the association is less clear in adult asthmatics. Bacteria and bacterial produets, conversely, are mainly associated with other COPD than asthma, e.g. chronic bronchitis. During the past decade it has been shown that release of mediators and neurotransmitters are of key importanee in these inflammatory diseases. It is therefore possible that mieroorganisms play a role in these events in the airways. The pathophysiological mechanisms, which are only partially known, are reviewed in the following. We will not focus on the clinical investigations, since these have been discussed extensively elsewhere (3, 30, 40, 46, 81, 87) .",

Welliver et al. (98) found IgE-antibody specific for respiratory syncytia! virus (RSV) in nasal secretions from children infected with this virus. Children with clinical evidence of airway obstruction showed higher titers of RSVspecific IgE, and had higher concentrations of histamine in the nasal secretions; the presence of high IgE titers was likewise strongly associated with decreased arterial oxygen saturations. In children with respiratory ilJncss caused by parainfluenza virus infection virus-specific IgE was similarly demonstrated in nasopharyngeal secretions, and the titers were higher in the groups with croup, wheezing or a combination, compared to the patients with upper respiratory illness alone (99) . A similar diflerentiation was also obtained for histamine since il was detecled significantly more often and in higher concentrations in secretions from the first mentioned groups. This is interesting since both RSV and parainfluenza virus cause respiratory syndromes peculiar to children, i.e. bronchiolitis and croup. These data point to the pos-sibiUty of production of virus-specific IgE antibody during respiratory tract infections, and via IgEmediated mediator release the microorganisms might be responsible for the respiratory symptoms.",

In patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) the cells from the AIDS patients responded to both HIV and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I, whereas no response was obtained in control cells from normal individuals, which points to the possibility of type I allergic reactions directed against these viruses in AIDS patients (72-74). Basophils from normal individuals do not release histamine when stimulated with live or inactivated viruses as HSV type I, adenovirus type 1, rhinovirus or inlluenza A virus (12, 18, 47) . This was also the case when cells from patients with intrinsic or allergic asthma were challenged with infiuenza A virus (22). However, some paramyxoviruses, such as RSV, parainfluenza type 1 (Seiidai) and type 3 viruses seem capable of releasing histamine from basophils through a nonimmunological mechanism (79), although the elTect of RSV could not be confirmed by Chonmaitree (18). Further, //; viiro studies including human epithelial cells and neutrophils, respectively, indicate that RSV via complement activation (90) or via complexes of RSV and antibody (35) should be able to stimulate cells to the release of various mediators, such as histamine, products of arachidonic acid metabolism and oxygen radicals.",

(47) who examined the effect of virus on IgE-mediated histamine release from peripheral blood leukocytes from normal individuals. Preincubation of the cells with cither adenovirus, infiuenza A virus, or HSV type I, enhanced the basophil hislamine release triggered by anti-IgE. This effect was obtained by live as well as inactivated viruses. It was necessary to preincubate the cells with virus for at least 8 h to obtain the effect, and it seemed that interferon was responsible for the potentiation found in these long-term experiments. Production of interferon was thus observed during the preincubation, and the effect of the virus could be mimicked by interferon. This is interesting since inlerferon is found in nasal secretions from infants with viral respiratory tract infections (42, 64). The potentiation was confirmed in a study by Busse (12), which also demonstrated that virus potentiates mediator release triggered by IgE-dependent as well as nonimmunological (calcium ionophore A23187) mechanisms. However, virus which causes no production of interferon (rhinovirus type lA), was also able to enhance Ihe anti-JgE-induced hislaniine release, thus suggesting that other, unknown factors are responsible for the potentiating effect of virus (18).",

            "text": "A more direct effect of virus on the cells was examined in short-term experiments where the leukocytes were exposed to virus and specific antigen (or anti-IgE) for 40 min. In these studies influenza A virus enhanced basophil histamine release triggered by IgE-mediated reactions (22). Potentiation was thus obtained both when cells from normal individuals were stimulated with anti-IgE, and when cells from asthma patients allergic to house dust mite, grass pollen, birch pollen or cat dander were challenged with their specific antigen. It seems doubtful whether a production of interferon could be responsible for the potentiating effect of virus in these shortterm experiments, since such a production requires several hours (47). However, infiuenza A virus appeared to act by means of its surface neuraminidase, since the enhancing efiect was mimicked by isolated neuraminidase and was abolished by a neuramini-dase inhibitor (22) or by monoclonal antibodies directed against the viral neuraminidase (20). One possible explanation for this potentiating efiect is an enzymatic efiect of the viral neuraminidase; this enzyme is known to cleave off sialic acid from cell membranes (80) thereby causing enhanced cellular responses (37, 44) including basx^phil histamine release (53, 54). In fact, increased concentrations of sialic acid have been found in sputum and serum from asthma patients during exacerbation due to upper respiratory tract infections (89). On the other hand, the viral neuraminidase is a glycoprotein containing carbohydrates, such as galactose and Nacetylglucosamine (29), and these free carbohydrates were able to abolish the potentiating effect of the virus (26). Therefore, it seems more likely that these carbohydrate residues are responsible for the potentiation by interacting with binding sites on the basophil cell membrane. The change in the cell response induced by infiuenza A virus comprised both an increased maximum release of histamine, an increased cell sensitivity and a lowering of the threshold to the cell stimulus (27). An increased sensitivity to the allergen is probably more important in asthma than an increased maximum mediator release, since the former was more strongly correlated to the severity of the disease as measured by bronchial provocation with the relevant allergen (65).",

Thus, an exaggerated cholinergic refiex response might be the basis for virus-induced bronehoconstriction and increase in airway reactivity to histamine, since pretreatment with atropine of normal subjects with colds prevented these symptoms (33). It was suggested that the reversible airway epithelial damage caused by viral infections exposed afierent nerve endings and accentuated the afferent portion of the refiex arc. However, Buckner et al. (8) demonstrated that the efierent arm of the vagal refiex is increased, sinee electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve caused greater bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs infected with parainfiuenza virus than in uninfected animals. The mechanism might be due to increased acetylcholin release from the parasympathetic nerve terminals caused by a loss of negative feedback control by viral damage of presynaptic MT muscarinic receptors (49).",

Buckner showed that infection with parainfiuenza 3 virus blocked the ability of a Pagonist to inhibit antigen-induced contraction of guinea pig isolated airway smooth muscle (7), demonstrating that the P-adrenergic function was depressed by the virus.

Microorganisms may stimulate mast cells in the epithelium to release histamine, which disrupts the epithelial tight junctions leading to entrance of insulting particles (68). This theory was supported by experiments with human bronchoalveolar cells demonstrating such a mediator release (21), and Hogg and associates have shown that in animals both histamine and antigen challenge can increase the airways' mucosal permeability by disruption of epithelial tight junetions (4,45). Further, it is well known that i'lifection with RSV, infiuenza virus or parainfluenza virus results in destruction of the airways epithelium (13, 16, 87) . Based on studies in animals it has been found that viral damage of the airways epithelium leads to a loss of neutral endopeptidase (48, 49) . Substance P and other tachykinins released from afferent nerves in the lung are normally broken down by this enzyme and the accumulation of these neuropeptides with bronchoconstrictor effects should therefore lead to an enhanced contractile response of the airway smooth musele (49). An impaired mueociliary clearance appears in subjects with infiuenza (14), naturally acquired common colds (71), or by infection with Mycop/asma pneumoniae (15). The impairment is usually reversible within months. Infections with common respiratory viruses have been shown to be assoeiated with cilia with abnormal microtubular patterns, loss of eiliated cells (16,71), and depressed mucociliary clearance (14, 100). Further, infiuenza A virus via its neuraminidase lowers the viscosity of the mucous film in the respiratory tract thus promoting the spread of virus (50). Respiratory viruses such as Sendai virus enhance basophil chemotaxis /// vifro, and this effect might be due to virus-indueed production of interferon (60). It is not known whether a similar efiect on migration of infiammatory cells in the airways plays a role during viral infection.",

These cells comprise pulmonary mast cells obtained by either bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (21) or enzymic dispersion of lung tissue (19), tonsillar mast cells (19) and mast cells from nasal mucosa (1). The studies included non-atopic patients without asthma. Whole formalin-killed bacteria were used and it seems that the histamine release response to Staphyhcoccus aureus {S. cnireus) was higher in epitheiiai mast cells obtained by BAL than in mast cells from the lung parenchyma. Also bacterial antigens from, for instance, S. cnireus, H. influenzae and Branlmmella calarrhalis induce histamine release from human BAL-cells (6). Further, S. aureus whole bacteria were found to induce synthesis of leukotriene B4 from BAL-cells (21). Asthmatic subjects are expected to release more histamine than normal subjects since an increase in mast cells and histamine content has been observed in the bronchial mucous membrane (62) and in the lavage fluid (36, 97) , and the cells might show an enhanced response to the stimuli, which has been demonstrated in connection with anti- IgE (36, 61) . The mediator release triggered by bacteria in epithelial cells might be of importance for the exacerbation of COPD in respiratory tract infections, since histamine is assumed to increase the epithelial permeability with entrance of allergens and other insulting particles (45, 68), and since leukotriene B4 as a strong chemotactic agent has the potential to facilitate airway inflammation.",

            "text": "However, bacteria can also trigger histamine release by a non-immunological mechanism verified by release from both intact cells and cells stripped of surface-imtnunoglobulins (67). The non-immunological mechanism was studied mostly in connection with S. aureus, and it was found to operate in the majority of persons tested. These subjects included allergies suffering from hay fever and asthma, children with intrinsic asthma, and normal individuals (25, 34, 51) . We suspect that the non-immunological mechanism is a sugar-Iectin mediated reaction. This means that sugars on the bacterial cell wall interact with lectins on the basophil cell membrane leading to histamine release (51, 52). The new mechanism may be of importance for our understanding of the role of bacteria in asthma and infectious diseases, since a subject does not need to be sensitized to bacteria in order to induce histamine release. It is also remarkable that this mechanism causes a synergistic enhancement of allergic histamine release. The in vitro experiments comprise cells obtained from house dust mite or grass pollen allergic patients. A low histamine release was obtained when the cells were stimulated with small amounts of specific allergen, and this was also the case on challenge with small amounts of bacteria to which the patient was not sensitized. However, the combination of bacteria and specific allergen caused a high mediator release, exceeding the additive effect (67). Also bacterial components such as peptidoglycan, teichoic acid and endotoxins from H. influenzae, E. coli and Salmonella bacteria can aggravate allergic mediator release (23, 67, 91). It is possible that the capability of bacteria and endotoxin to enhance mediator release depends on microbial sugar residues interacting with binding sites on the basophil cell membrane, since the free carbohydrates (galactose and N-acetylglucosamine) abolish the potentiating effect (24). Thus it seems that bacteria by their enhancing effect as well as their stimulatory effect may contribute to the exacerbation of airway diseases during infections. This is important since oral intake of galactose has been shown to abolish the potentiating effect in ex vivo experiments (unpublished results). The clinical effect of such carbohydrate therapy is, however, not known, but the total lack of adverse reactions makes this an interesting new therapeutic principle.",

Bacteria can induce mediator release not only by the allergic (IgEdependent) mechanism but also by a nonimmunologic mechanism, which indicates that a person does not need to be sensitized to bacteria to release histamine. An enhancement of mediator release can be obtained by both viruses and bacteria. Mediator release or an enhancement of allergic mediator release by microorganisms or their products may play an important role, since the microorganisms can stimulate superficially lying epithelial mast cells to release histamine, which can disrupt the epithelial tight junctions. This will allow a subsequent stimulation of various submucosal cells and nerve endings by inhaled allergens, virus and bacteria. A vicious circle leading to hyperreactivity and bronchoconstriction can thereby be initiated.",
