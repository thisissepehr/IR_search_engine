Nevertheless, detailed knowledge in the complex molecular mechanisms is missing and impedes efficient therapeutic treatment. Mouse models of sepsis are frequently used to study molecular mechanisms. However, controversies emerged in respect to limitations in the transferability of results to human biology. Humanized model systems could help to address this issue. Objectives: We aimed to develop a reliable human in vitro organoid model of the human liver sinusoid for studies of sepsis related liver dysfunction on the cellular level. Methods: Microfluidically supported Biochip act as scaffold for an in vitro organoid model of the human liver sinusoid, composed of vascular and hepatocyte cell layers integrating non-parenchymal cells closely reflecting tissue architecture, ultimately enabling physiological cross communication in a bio-inspired fashion. Inflammationrelated liver dysfunction was mimicked by stimulation with various agonists of toll-like receptors. Results: TLR-stimulation induced a release of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines and diminished expression of endothelial VEcadherin,hepatic MRP-2 transporter and apolipoprotein B (ApoB), resulting in an inflammation-related endothelial barrier disruption and hepatocellular dysfunction in the liver organoid. However, interaction of the liver organoid with human monocytes attenuated inflammationrelated cell responses and restored MRP-2 transporter activity, ApoB expression and albumin/urea production. The cellular events observed in the liver organoid closely resemble pathophysiological responses in the well-established sepsis model of peritoneal contamination and infection (PCI) in mice and clinical observations in human sepsis. Conclusions: We conclude that this human liver organoid model is a valuable tool for studies of sepsis-related liver dysfunction and subsequent immune cell-related tissue repair/remodeling processes. It is a suitable experimental tool to improve study options on pathophysiological mechanisms of sepsis-related liver failure and the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Chronic critical illness from sepsis is not associated with a dysfunctional response to T cell receptor stimulation hyperinflammation and protracted immune suppression. The exact origin of a long-term suppression of adaptive immunity in sepsis survivors, however, remains an issue of debate owing to the scarceness of data from humans. Objectives: To assess the long-term consequences of sepsis on T-cell function in chronic critically ill (CCI) patients with persistent organ dysfunction. Methods: Blood was drawn from twelve CCI patients (age: 67 years) receiving mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy in a long-term care hospital with a history of severe sepsis formerly treated for 37.8 (18-78) days in an external acute care hospital. Control blood was derived from gender/age matched healthy volunteers. CD4/CD8 T-cells were purified via automated magnetic selection within 6 h of blood draw. Purified T-cells were subjected to fluorescence sorter-based phenotyping. The response of CD4/CD8 T-cells to a collection of TCR stimuli was assessed at the level of TCR-signaling, activation marker expression, cytokine production and proliferation. Results: CCI patients featured granulocytosis and low, albeit not lymphopenic, T-cell numbers with normal levels of CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) regulatory T-cells compared to controls. T-cells from CCI patients showed a higher basal level of activation and stronger expression of the inhibitory surface receptor PD-1 compared to controls. However, CD4/CD8 T-cells exhibited no apparent defects in their response to TCR/co-receptor challenge at the level of proximal TCR-signaling (activation/phosphorylation of PLCgamma, Erk, Akt, LAT), activation marker upregulation (CD69, CD25, CD154), cytokine production or expansion. Conclusions: Severe sepsis patients with CCI feature signs of immune suppression but their T-cells are not compromised in their response to TCR stimulation. Potential future immune-modulatory therapies in CCI patients should target other bottlenecks of the immune response.

The experimental studies in the rat brain revealed a deranged neurotransmitter profile during septic delirium. Glutamatergic synapses, essential in learning and memory, undergo use-dependent changes in synaptic strength, referred to as plasticity. Permanent strengthening of synapses after a brief stimulus, termed long-term potentiation (LTP), was discovered in the hippocampus, and here it has been most thoroughly studied. Cholinergic neurotransmission plays an important role in regulating the cognitive functions of the brain. It acts as a signal-to-noise ratio modulator of sensory and cognitive inputs. The irregularities in brain functions give rise to the symptoms of delirium, including disorganised thinking and disturbances of attention and consciousness, which in turn might affect learning and memory. Possible mechanisms for cholinergic deficiency include impairment of synaptic functions of acetylcholine. Imbalances in the cholinergic system during sepsis might therefore play an extensive role in the septic delirium. Objectives: The pathogenesis of septic encephalopathy is multifactorial and the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Septic encephalopathy remains the clinical diagnosis of exclusion with high mortality rate. Methods: By using MRI imaging we identified functional changes in the hippocampal region of patients with severe sepsis and septic encephalopathy. This finding was further supported by the experimental recordings in the rat brains of lipopolysacharride (LPS) treated rats by using electrophysiological patch clamp technic. Results: Critically ill ICU patients, diagnosed with septic delirium using the CAM-ICU and ICDSC methods underwent diagnostic MRI scans. The serial MRI analysis revealed increased signal intensity in the hippocampal region in diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI MRI). We used endotoxemia model to induce sepsis in the rats. Electrophysiological analysis of the hippocampal neurons in LPS treated rats showed impaired LTP in the excitatory synapses, as compared to controls. Application of physostigmine, a blood-brain barrier permeable cholinesterase inhibitor, resulted in a partial recovery of LTP in the hippocampal synapses of LPS treated rats. Conclusions: The patients with septic delirium show functional changes in the hippocampus. Furthermore, we show that endotoxemia affects synaptic plasticity in the rat hippocampus, suggesting the involvement of this brain region in the pathophysiology of septic delirium. Moreover, the effect of the cholinergic neurotransmission onto the induction and maintenance of synaptic plasticity in the rat hippocampus during endotoxemia suggests that cholinergic neurotransmission might play a critical role in septic encephalopathy. Introduction: Sepsis is one of the most frequent causes of death in intensive care units. Initiated by a bacterial infection it is characterized by a systemic inflammation. Life-threatening consequences are not only immune and metabolic dysfunctions but also arterial hypotension along with vasodilation. The situation is further worsened by the fact that application of vasoconstrictive substances barely has a stabilizing effect on blood pressure of septic patients. There are indications that vascular hypo-reactivity is due to an altered expression of vasoactive receptors in both endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and that this might be mediated by sepsis-related pro-inflammatory cytokines. Objectives: The aim of this study is to analyze the influence of sepsis-relevant cytokines on the expression profile of vasoactive receptors of vascular cells. Methods: Primary mouse endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells (mEC/mVSMC) as well as the human cell lines TIME and HITB5 were investigated. Cells were treated with a mixture of the cytokines TNF-\u00b1, IL-1 2 and IFN-3 . In a time series cells were stimulated for 1/4/8/16/24 h using a mixture containing 100 ng/ml of each cytokine. In a concentration series cells were stimulated for 24 h using a mixture containing 0.1/1/10/100 ng/ml of each cytokine. The expression of the AT1 and AT2 receptors (AT1R/AT2R), MAS receptor, ACE1, ACE2, ATRAP, ATIP, the adrenergic receptors \u00b11a, \u00b11b, \u00b11d, 2 2 (Adra1a, 1b, 1d, Adrb2), the vasopressin receptor 1a (Avpr1a) and the endothelin receptors A and B (Ednra/Ednrb) was determined using quantitative Real-time PCR.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Infection 2015"}, {"text": "Results: Endothelial cells (mEC, TIME) were positive for AT1R, ACE1, ATRAP, ATIP, Adra1b, Adra1d, Adrb2, Ednra and Ednrb. Smooth muscle cells (mVSMC, HITB5) were positive for AT1R, ACE1, ACE2, ATRAP, ATIP, Adra1b, Adra1d, Adrb2, Avpr1a, Ednra and Ednrb. Cytokine-stimulation of mVSMCs resulted in an expression modification of all detectable components of the vasoregulatory system. Remarkably, all vasoconstrictive elements were significantly down-regulated due to cytokine challenge. At this, for AT1R and ACE1 a dependency of time and concentration was found, i.e. down-regulation increased with increasing incubation time and cytokine concentration. In further investigations the impact of sepsis-related cytokines on vasoactive receptor expression will be analyzed also for mEC, TIME and HITB5. Conclusions: Our data verifies that the cell models used are well suited for the parallel analysis of cytokine-mediated shifts in vasoactive receptor expression profiles in both the murine and the human system. Our data further provide evidence that the limited effectiveness of vasoconstrictive substances observed in clinical sepsis treatment might be due to a diminished expression of their corresponding receptors, and that this effect might be mediated by the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u00b1, IL-1 2 and IFN-3 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Infection 2015"}, {"text": "Regulation of endothelial Tie2 expression and functional relevance in a murine sepsis model Introduction: Among vascular receptor tyrosine kinases, Tie2 exhibits the unusual property of being highly activated during quiescence, giving rise to the idea that Tie2 maintains the adult vasculature. In sepsis, the Tie2 antagonist Angiopoietin-2 is dramatically elevated thereby deactivating protective Tie2 signaling. Objectives: To investigate the influence of sepsis on the total receptor expression and its functional consequences. Methods: Tie2 expression analysis via qPCR and Western Bot in murine lungs [after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and LPS] and in vitro in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) after stimulation with sepsis mediators. Functional analysis: survival in Tie2 heterozygote (\u00b1) versus wildtype (+/+) mice and after experimental Tie2 suppression via specific in vivo siRNA; fluorescent immunohistochemistry; evans blue permeability assay; in vitro permeability in real-time via transendothelial electrical resistance (electric cell-substrate impedance sensing, ECIS). Results: Tie2 mRNA and protein is rapidly suppressed in septic murine lungs and in TNFa stimulated HUVECs. This phenomenon attenuates basal barrier function, renders the endothelium hypo-responsive to its protective ligand Angiopoietin-1, and sensitizes endothelium to inflammatory triggers of permeability. Forced reduction of Tie2 in otherwise healthy adult animals (via siRNA) reduces downstream kinase signaling, attenuates the barrier effector protein, VE-cadherin, and induces vascular leakage changes that recapitulate key features of acutely inflamed blood vessels.

Secondary bacterial infections caused by pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) can increase the severity of IAV infections, resulting in higher pathogen load accompanied with higher morbidity and mortality. Currently only rare anti-infective strategies against both pathogens are available. In different studies we have identified virus-supportive cellular functions as potential targets for antiviral intervention. Among these, the cellular IKK/NF-8B signalling pathway was shown to regulate the viral ribonucleoprotein export out of the nucleus. Inhibition of NF-8B signalling results in reduced expression of cytokines, chemokines, and pro-apoptotic factors and subsequent inhibition of caspase activation and block of caspase-mediated nuclear export of viral ribonucleoproteins. In consequence, the production of progeny viruses is reduced. Objectives: The aim of the present study is to investigate the role of IAV supportive cellular factors as potential targets for anti-infective therapy. Here we examined the anti-pathogen potential of the NF-8B inhibitor LG-ASA against IAV and/or S. aureus infection. Methods: We established in vitro and in vivo co-infection models using serial infection with IAV and S. aureus. The effect of LG-ASA was determined on viral and bacterial load and inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, survival of co-infected mice was examined in presence and absence of LG-ASA. Results: Our data indicate that targeting NF-8B signaling by LG-ASA inhibits IAV replication and intracellular bacterial load upon singular as well as co-infection.

Functional Characterization of Tef1 and Dectin-2 mediated immune modulation by candida albicans Methods: ELISA, Immunoprecipitation, Western Blot, SPR (Biacore), BLITZ, FACs, Confocal microscopy Results: Tef1 binds to Dectin-2 in a calcium independent manner and binding is dose-dependent. Tef1-Dectin-2 complexes are identified by immunoprecipitation with Tef1 anti-serum and when the complexes were separated by SDS-Page both components were identified by western blotting. Tef1 binding to Dectin-2 was inhibited with Tef1 anti-serum, as evaluated by flow cytometry. Tef1 and Dectin-2 colocalize on the surface of human dendritic cells and similarly Dectin-2 binds to and co-localizes with Tef1 on the surface of candida yeast cells as shown by confocal microscopy. Tef1 binds to human dendritic cells via Dectin-2 and induces secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-10. This effect is dose-dependent. Also, Tef1 induced IL-10 expression by dendritic cells is inhibited when Dectin-2 is blocked with Dectin-2 antibody. Interestingly, Tef1 does not induce secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF \u00b1 and IFN-y. In addition, Tef1, when added to human dendritic cells, down regulates surface expression of the maturation marker CD83 and of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86. Thus, Tef1 is a new ligand for human Dectin-2 and Tef1 upon binding to dendritic cells via Dectin-2, modulates host immune system by inducing anti-inflammatory IL-10 expression. Conclusions: To our knowledge, Tef1 is the first C. albicans protein identified which binds to human pattern recognition receptor Dectin-2. This binding results in host immune suppression via Tef1 induced IL-10 in dendritic cells. Introduction: Candida albicans is able to infect virtually all organs during systemic infections. Both, fungal colonization and host immune response contribute to pathogenesis and organ damage and can ultimately lead to sepsis with high mortality rates. However, in mice the outcome of infection is organ specific. While C. albicans is gradually cleared from liver and spleen, infection progresses in the kidneys due to a delayed, but prolonged influx of neutrophils, accompanied by a strong cytokine response. The mechanisms underlying these tissue-specific differing immunological factors are not known. Objectives: We hypothesized that both organ-specific host determinants and fungal factors contribute to the organ-specific outcome. In this project, we aim to identify and characterize fungal factors which are responsible for the organ-specific host responses and the immunopathology in the kidneys. Methods: We performed in vivo host-pathogen co-transcriptome analyses using C. albicans DNA microarrays and mouse bead arrays to identify niche-and organ-specific expression of genes. An optimized RNA isolation protocol for both fungal and mouse RNA was established to isolate good quality RNA in sufficient amounts to analyze (1) C. albicans genes expressed in mouse kidneys and (2) mouse genes expressed in kidneys, spleens and livers after 12, 24 and 72 h of infection. Results: Results from expression profiling of C. albicans at early time points demonstrated increased expression of genes involved pathogenesis, filamentous growth, iron homeostasis, biofilm formation, hyphal cell wall integrity and plasma membrane organization. As expected, the greatest change in C. albicans gene expression was observed 12 h after infection. Notably, the most prominent upregulated genes of C. albicans after 12 and 24 h infection were surface antigens such as Hyr1, Cht2, Hwp1 and Csa1 and genes involved in iron homeostasis such as CFL2, FTR2 and FRP1. Our data also suggest novel genes, such as COI1 which encodes a secreted protein of unknown function, which might be involved in C. albicans organ specificity. Conclusions: In depth bioinformatical analyses of C. albicans and mouse gene expression data are currently in progress. The combination of transcriptome analyses and network modeling will allow us to detect genes which are both infection-associated and niche-specific and which contribute to the different and organ-specific pathogenesis. the kidney. As infection progresses, a distinct production of proinflammatory cytokines and progressive accumulation of immune cells are contributing to renal pathology. In contrast, the proinflammatory response in liver and spleen regresses over time. The molecular mechanisms of these different organ responses are not yet understood. Objectives: We aimed to identify C. albicans factors that influence the organ-specific epithelial cytokine response which contribute to organ-specific outcomes in the disease. Methods: We used a large-scale screening approach, where we analyzed a collection of 1100 C. albicans knock-out mutants for their ability to damage human oral, intestinal and renal epithelial cells and examined the host cell response by quantification of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. The phenotypical characterization of selected C. albicans mutants included analysis of the interaction with different human epithelial cell lines, fungal morphology, growth properties and stress resistance under various conditions. Results: In general, production of cytokines upon infection correlated with the level of Candida-induced cell damage. However, we also identified mutants with normal damage potential but reduced cytokine responses, suggesting that fungal factors indeed modulate the immune response. From sixty mutants in which damage potential and cytokine response appeared uncoupled in the initial screen or which induced cell type-specific host responses, six genes of interest were selected for the construction of homozygous deletion mutants for further investigations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Infection 2015"}, {"text": "Conclusions: In summary, by using a large-scale screening approach we identified several candidate genes that might modulate epithelial cell responses to infection and might thus contribute to the organspecific host responses observed in vivo. Introduction: The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is a multifunctional receptor which is activated by its natural ligand C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12). CXCR4 seems to be part of the lipopolysaccharide sensing complex, suggesting that an intervention with CXCR4 agonists or antagonists could result in reduced TLR4 signaling. However, the role of the CXCR4 and the influence of different CXCR4 ligands in inflammatory diseases are still contradictious. Objectives: Therefore, we aimed to characterize the systemic effects of CXCR4 activation in severe systemic inflammation and to evaluate its impact on endotoxin induced organ damages by applying a sublethal LPS dose in mice. Methods: The plasma stable CXCL12 analogue CTCE-0214D was synthesized and administered subcutaneously shortly before LPS treatment. 24 h following LPS administration, mice were sacrificed and blood was obtained for TNF alpha, IFN gamma and blood glucose evaluation. Additionally, histopathological changes and oxidative stress in the liver and spleen were assessed and liver biotransformation capacity was determined. Finally, CXCR4, CXCL12 and TLR4 expression patterns in liver, spleen and thymus tissue as well as the presence of different markers for oxidative stress and apoptosis were evaluated by means of immunohistochemistry. Results: CTCE-0214D improved health status and distinctly reduced the LPS mediated effects on TNF alpha, IFN gamma and blood glucose levels by approximately 35, 50 or 70 %, respectively. It attenuated oxidative stress in the liver and spleen tissue and enhanced liver biotransformation capacity unambiguously. CTCE-0214D diminished the LPS induced expression of CXCR4, CXCL12, TLR4, NF-8B, cleaved caspase-3 and gp91 phox, whereas heme oxygenase 1 expression and activity were induced above average. Furthermore, TUNEL staining revealed anti-apoptotic effects of CTCE-0214D in all organs. Conclusions: CXCR4 is undoubtedly involved in inflammation. Its activation was accompanied with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and cytoprotective effects as CTCE-0214D attenuated TLR4 signaling induced heme oxygenase 1 activity and mitigated apoptosis. Thus, the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis seems to be a promising target in the treatment of acute systemic inflammation, especially when accompanied by a hepatic dysfunction and an excessive production of free radicals.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Infection 2015"}, {"text": "Blockade of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 with AMD3100 in endotoxemia is associated with deleterious effects in vivo Introduction: The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is a multifunctional receptor which is activated by its natural ligand C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12). Although a blockade of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis revealed beneficial outcomes in chronic inflammatory diseases, its importance in acute inflammatory diseases remains contradictious and not well characterized. Objectives: Therefore, we aimed to investigate the impact of a CXCR4 blockade on endotoxemia by applying a sublethal LPS dose in mice. Methods: The selective CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 was administered intraperitoneally shortly after LPS treatment. 24 h after LPS administration, the clinical severity score, the body temperature and the body weight of the animals were determined. Afterwards, the mice were sacrificed and serum TNF alpha as well as IFN gamma levels were measured. Furthermore, the oxidative stress in the brain, liver, lung and kidney tissue was assessed. In addition, the biotransformation capacity of the liver was evaluated and finally, the expression of gp91 phox as well as heme oxygenase 1 in the spleen and liver were determined by means of immunohistochemistry. Results: The mice of the AMD3100 plus LPS treatment group displayed a significantly impaired general condition, a reduced body temperature and a decreased body weight in comparison to the control and the LPS treated animals, respectively. TNF alpha levels were significantly increased by more than 200 or 35 % when compared to the control or to the LPS group, respectively, whereas IFN gamma levels were elevated by about 11 % in comparison to mice which had received LPS only. In all investigated organs, but especially in the liver and in the kidney, co-administration of AMD3100 and LPS caused massive oxidative stress. Furthermore, the protein contents and the activities of several CYP enzymes in the liver were significantly reduced. Immunohistochemistry revealed gp91 phox to occur above average, whereas heme oxygenase 1 expression was distinctly decreased. Conclusions: Our results indicate that a blockade of the CXCR4 in endotoxemia is disadvantageous and even worsens the disease. Coadministration of AMD3100 and LPS impaired the health status of the animals, caused massive oxidative stress and diminished the biotransformation capacity.

Introduction: The application of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) for volume resuscitation is controversially discussed. We have recently shown that a vascular perfusion with HES alone impairs endothelial and epithelial barrier integrity as well as metabolic function of the intestine. Objectives: Here we investigated whether Albumin containing HES solutions are superior to HES alone in regard to the above mentioned parameters and evaluated the underlying mechanisms. Methods: An isolated perfused model of the mouse small intestine was employed to investigate the effects of the following substances clinically employed in fluid substitution: (1) 3 % Albumin (Alb; N = 6), (2) 3 % HES (HES; N = 6) or (3) 1.5 % HES/1.5 % Albumin (HES/Alb; N = 6). Intestinal metabolic functions (galactose uptake, lactate-to-pyruvate ratio), morphology (histological analyses), fluid shifts between the compartments (quantification of vascular and luminal effluents) and endothelial as well as epithelial barrier permeability [FITC-dextran translocation and quantification of intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP)] were evaluated. Cellular mechanisms were investigated by quantification of Erk1/2, Akt, Stat5 phosphorylation, protein expression of claudin-3 as well as caspase3/ 7 activity. Results: Galactose uptake was significantly reduced over time in the HES perfusion group (P \\ 0.001 vs Alb). Luminal and lymphatic flow rates were increased (P \\ 0.001 vs Alb), while vascular flow was significantly decreased (P \\ 0.001 vs Alb), pointing towards a fluid shift from the vascular to the luminal and lymphatic compartments during HES perfusion. These results were confirmed by measurements of the FITC-dextran translocation from the vascular to the luminal compartment and quantification of I-FABP in the luminal effluent, which showed a 20-fold increase of FITC-dextran transfer (P \\ 0.001 vs Alb) and a by trend elevated amount of I-FABP in the HES group. Supplementing the HES perfusion buffer with Albumin (HES/Alb) reversed all adverse effects of HES (P \\ 0.05 vs HES), restored barrier integrity to baseline levels (P \\ 0.05 vs HES) and even improved metabolic function of the intestine (P \\ 0.001 vs HES; P \\ 0.05 vs Alb). Perfusion with HES/ Alb resulted in a significantly increased phosphorylation of the prosurvival kinases Akt and Erk1/2 (P \\ 0.001 vs HES), but did not change phosphorylation of Stat5, protein expression of claudin-3 or caspase3/7 activity. Conclusions: Albumin supplementation abrogates the adverse effects of HES in the intestine and underlying mechanism may function via phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Infection 2015"}, {"text": "Setup of the perfusion model and experimental time frame.

While mice models are generally considered the gold standard for mimicking human infections, alternative infection hosts are used ever more frequently. However, non-mammalian models are still seen critically due to their physiological differences to humans and other mammals. Objectives: Our aim was to establish the suitability of an invertebrate infection model Toll pathway-deficient Drosophila melanogaster for fungal virulence factor screenings, and compare it to the established murine model. To this end, we used a recently created library of deletion mutants of Candida glabrata [1] , an important fungal pathogen of humans and the second most frequent cause of disseminated candidiasis. Methods: Using two virulence indices, one based on the mean survival time of flies after infection, and the other on relative fungal burdens in different mice organs, we tested several hundred C. glabrata mutants for their virulence potential in both models. Results: Our results indicate that overall, reduced mean survival times of flies can largely predict a significant decrease in organ burden in mice, especially the liver [2]. Importantly, the predictive power of fruit fly survival is much better than in vitro growth rates alone. Hypo-and hyper-virulence of individual mutants are largely in agreement in both models. For example, early steps in N-glycosylation are required in both, flies and mice. Some specific differences were found, among others, for mutants defective in the oxidative stress response or polarized growth. Conclusions: Overall, the Drosophila model has proven to be a suitable host to detect to a large extent mutants which will likely lead to a reduced organ burden in mice. With this system, large-scale prescreens for virulence factors are possible, which would be ethically, financially, and practically challenging with a vertebrate host. Mutants leading to reduced or increased fly survival times can then be characterized in more detail by individual testing in suitable murine models, reducing the total number of mice required in these experiments. Despite several studies focusing on common similarities amongst pathogens no extensive efforts have been applied on the opposite. Objectives: Discriminating the causes of the disease enables improving treatment procedures, and in particular the investigation for improved differential diagnosis of sepsis induced by fungi and bacteria is a central task in biomedical research. Methods: We performed gene expression analysis of human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) in culture challenged with C. albicans and M. tuberculosis generated elsewhere. We identified several pathways that are strikingly upregulated in PBMCs during an infection by C. albicans in comparison to M. tuberculosis. Results: Pathways such as Natural Killer Cell mediated toxicity, Proteasome and Antigen processing and presentation as well as several pro-inflammatory cytokines are uniquely affected by this fungus and should be investigated further. Further, a regulatory model has been developed that enables investigating the regulation of these pathways. Conclusions: Besides gaining a better understanding on the human immune response specific to these pathogen entities, our results are promising to pave the way for the ultimate goal, for rapid pathogen identification. Introduction: In the polymicrobial sepsis mouse model following cecal ligation and puncture, PPARgamma contributes to T cell depletion and concomitant immune paralysis, consequently impairing mouse survival. Objectives: Translating these data to the human situation, we propose that the level of PPAR 3 expression in T cells of septic patients correlates with the outcome after sepsis. Methods: To test this hypothesis, we analyzed by qPCR, PPAR 3 mRNA expression in enriched CD3 + T cells derived from blood of n = 17 septic patients. Blood was drawn starting on the day of sepsis diagnosis (=day 0) and then consecutively on days 1, 2, 4 and 14 after the initial diagnosis. CD3 + T cell count was determined by FACS analysis in parallel. T cells of nine healthy donors were included as control. Results: PPAR 3 mRNA expression was significantly increased in all samples derived from septic patients compared to healthy donors. A maximum of PPAR 3 expression was observed on the day of sepsis diagnosis (day 0). In contrast, the number of CD3 + T cells was significantly decreased in septic patients compared to healthy controls. There was a minimum of T cell count on day 1 after sepsis diagnosis. To determine whether there is a correlation between sepsis survival and low T cell number paired with high T cell specific PPAR 3 expression, we arbitrarily set two limits: first, we included only patients with a PPAR 3 expression in T cells higher than 7.000 copies/ 25 ng, where five out of six patients died during the ICU stay. Secondly, we selected patients with a T cell count below 100 T cells per ll blood, where five out of eight patients died. Among all 16 sepsis patients, four fulfilled the criteria for both arbitrary groups, high PPAR 3 and low T cell count, and all four patients subsequently died, confirming the relevance of the markers for outcome. Conclusions: From these data, we suggest that correlating high PPAR 3 expression in T cells with the absolute T cell number in blood of septic patients may constitute a new prognostic marker for sepsis progression and bad outcome. Introduction: The abdominal sepsis was and still remains one of the most actual problems in the abdominal surgery.

The endothelial barrier is sealed by tight and adherens junctions, in which the vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin is the major transmembrane adhesion molecule and thus represents a crucial determinant of endothelial barrier integrity. It is increasingly recognized that the shedding of membrane proteins is mediated by specific disintegrins and metalloproteinases (ADAMs). Objectives: We tested the hypothesis that the formation of endothelium-derived soluble VE-cadherin fragments (sVE-cadherin) is involved in inflammation-induced endothelial barrier disruption and that ADAM10-mediated shedding is critically involved. Methods: The concentration of sVE-cadherin in cell culture supernatants was measured by an ELISA-based system and Western Blot following incubation of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells with tumor necrosis factor-\u00b1 (TNF-\u00b1) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To investigate the influence of ADAM10 we used the specific inhibitor GI254023X. Mass spectrometry of the resulting VE-cadherin fragments following incubation of recombinant VE-cadherin (rVE-cadherin) with ADAM10 was used to identify possible cleavage sites. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to test for effects of sVE-cadherin on VE-cadherin-mediated adhesion Finally, blood samples of septic patients were collected. Results: Incubation with TNF-\u00b1 or LPS showed endothelial barier disruption which correlated with increased sVE-cadherin in supernatants in a time-dependent manner. Application of GI254023X attenuated inflammation-induced formation of sVE-cadherin. Digestion of rVE-cadherin with ADAM10 led to the formation of sVEcadherin at 90 and 110 kDa which correlated with several cleavage sites of the extracellular domain of VE-cadherin. AFM demonstrated that sVE-cadherin blocked VE-cadherin binding. Accordingly application of sVE-cadherin to HDMEC led to endothelial disruption. Serum levels of sVE-cadherin were significantly increased in septic patients with loss of microvascular barrier functions. Conclusions: Taken together, formation of sVE-cadherin is closely associated and contributes to inflammation-induced breakdown of endothelial barrier by inhibition of VE-cadherin binding.

Introduction: Septic shock is a leading cause of death in intensive care units. The liver plays a major role in host defense mechanisms during infection, and it is one of the first organs damaged by sepsis. In particular cholestasis, the condition where bile cannot flow from the liver to the duodenum, is a common complication in patients with bacterial infection and sepsis. As a consequence, septic patients with liver dysfunction show hyperbilirubinaemia and poor outcome. The experimental observations that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) represent important mediators in the signaling cascade leading to the initiation of the in ammatory response have suggested the involvement of these enzymes in sepsis-related disorders. Of note, the only class IB member, PI3Kgamma, has an important role in controlling multiple immune processes and is considered a particularly promising target for adjunctive treatment of systemic inflammation. Although PI3Kgamma is known to be mainly expressed in inflammatory cells, this PI3K has been also found involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced cholestasis, regulating pseudovilli internalization and bile transport proteins retrieval.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "054"}, {"text": "Objectives: Until now, no effective treatment for septic liver dysfunction is known.

Results: PI3Kgamma kinase-dependent and -independent functions were investigated in vitro. Our results show that PI3Kgamma kinase activity is activated by the bacterial chemotactic peptide fMLP as well as by the complement factor C5a. In particular, cell stimulation with these inflammatory mediators led to the direct phosphorylation of Akt, and this effect was blocked by genetic and pharmacological inhibition of PI3Kgamma.

We further revealed that the cardiac contractility was transiently impaired in mice kept at 30\u00b0C with complete recovery after 7 days, whereas animals of the COOL group developed a pronounced and prolonged myocardial dysfunction with reduced contractility compared to the NORM group. The reduced contractility of the COOL group was further confirmed by a reduced b adrenergic and Ca ++ -dependent contractile activity of cardiomyocytes (including ryanodine receptor and phosphalamban) derived from mice kept at 26\u00b0C. In addition, evaluation of cardiac tissue harvested from mice of the COOL group displayed a higher level of inflammatory response confirmed by increased neutrophils invasion and iNOS expression with enhanced nitrotyrosine formation.

Sub-acute endotoxemia was induced by a continuous intravenous infusion of LPS (0.5 mg LPS/kg * h) over a period of 300 min. MLT (3 9 3 mg/kg 9 15 min) was applied intravenously as three 15-min infusion directly before and 120 and 240 min after starting LPS administration.

Blood samples were taken from the femoral artery catheter every hour to analyze the kinetic of clot formation by thromboelastometry, to determine the amount of platelets per thousand erythrocytes and to measure the concentration of cell-free hemoglobin. Results: The continuous infusion of LPS led initially to a hypercoagulable state, which was expressed in the analysis of thromboelastometry by a significant reduction of clotting time. In the subsequent course of sub-acute endotoxemia, a significant increase of clotting time and clot formation time as well as a significant decrease of a-angle, maximum clot firmness and area under the curve were detected, which indicated a hypocoagulable state. Simultaneously, a decrease in platelet count and a release of cellfree hemoglobin could be observed during manifestation of subacute endotoxemia. The additional administration of MLT did not diminish the LPS-induced alterations in the parameters of thromboelastometry, but reduced significantly the LPS-induced decrease in platelet count and release of cell-free hemoglobin.

Conclusions: These results indicate that the administration of MLT does not diminish LPS-induced DIC during sub-acute endotoxemia.

Our study revealed that the number of transcribed genes decreased significantly during the acute phase of sepsis and that 1269 genes had a loss of expressed exons and did not recover that number until day 21. Pathway analysis revealed particularly androgen and estrogen metabolism to be significantly affected. From this pathway, we investigated 3-2-Hydroxysteroid-Dehydrogenases which showed remarkable exon loss. Western blots using specific antibodies confirmed their expression in liver rat samples. Conclusions: At the acute phase of sepsis a loss of the variety of expressed genes occurred and a substantial number of genes showed a loss in their expressed exon number. The majority of genes recovered until day 21. However, several genes did not recover. Particularly, genes coding for enzymes of androgen and estrogen metabolism remained affected. This is interesting in respect to PTSD, as it was shown that soldiers with PTSD and comorbid conditions (major depressive disorder or alcohol dependence) had higher testosterone levels compared to controls [4] . Such an association post sepsis could be caused by compromised steroid biosynthesis we found in our septic rodents. Further studies need to be performed to investigate this interplay between alternative splicing and such enzymatic effects.

Methods: Via Ficoll density centrifugation and a subsequent CD14+ separation (autoMACS, Miltenyi) monocytes of five healthy male donors were isolated from venous blood. After an overnight resting, monocytes were stimulated with A. fumigatus, N. meningitidis or S. aureus. RNA was isolated after 3 and 6 h and microarray technology was used to determine differentially expressed genes (FDR \\ 0.05, Fold Change [1.5) in response to all pathogens. Results: Results of the microarray analysis showed that the transcriptional patterns of monocytes cluster Aspergillus or bacteria specific. The data revealed a comprehensive pathogen-independent core program of gene expression induced by all three pathogens. Within this group we mainly detected genes encoding chemokines (e.g. CXCL5, CCL7), pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF, IL6, IL8) or surface markers for activation or adhesion (CD40, CD44). A. fumigatus induced a strong specific response on genes corresponding to the MAPK-signaling pathway (e.g. MAP2K1, MAP4K3, MRAS), the TNF-receptor superfamily (e.g. TNFSF14, TNFRSF10D, TNFRSF12A) and protein processing (e.g. HSPA7, HSPA1L). In contrast, the bacterial pathogens shared a large number of differentially expressed genes encoding chemokines (e.g., CXCL11, CXCL13), cytokines (e.g. Il19, Il16) or transcription factors of the Jak-STAT signaling pathway (STAT1, STAT2). Conclusions: The characteristic transcriptional differences in the immune response of monocytes against these pathogens can be used as a basis for further studies to aid the diagnosis of sepsis and to characterise a pathogen specific immune response. Introduction: For several years now, sphingolipids such as sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide (Cer) have been known to be not only components of the cell membrane, but also important signaling molecules. While the S1P-Cer rheostat is essential for the regulation of cell survival vs. apoptosis, S1P has also been shown to play a central role in immune cell egress.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 729, "end": 734, "text": "[1.5)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Infection 2015"}, {"text": "Objectives: This study aims to investigate the regulation of sphingolipids in experimental sepsis.

This suggests S1P to be a promising target in sepsis research. Methods: Experimental sepsis was induced in WT C57BL/6J mice using the peritoneal contamination and infection (PCI) model by injection of 0.75-1 ll/g of a human stool suspension. Lipid levels were measured using a LC/MS/MS approach with following m/ z transitions: S1P 380/264; C16-Cer 538/264; C24-Cer 650/264. Realtime quantitative PCR was done with TaqMan primers and probes.

In addition to S1P, ceramide levels were analyzed showing a shift in the ratio of C16-Cer to C24-Cer towards the short chain ceramides during sepsis progression. Conclusions: The altered S1P levels in plasma and liver indicate that S1P is redistributed from plasma to liver in early sepsis. The upregulation of SphK1 and S1PR3 has also been reported in astrocytes under pro-inflammatory conditions (1) , which confirms our results. The reaction to an inflammatory event like sepsis is also mirrored in the ceramide levels. The C16-ceramide, which is known to be proapoptotic, is upregulated after sepsis induction while C24-ceramide is downregulated. C24-ceramide and its producing enzyme, ceramide synthase 2, have been shown to be essential for liver function (2). Altogether our results indicate an involvement of S1P and ceramides in this experimental sepsis model. Introduction: Candida species are one of the most common causes of invasive fungal infections.

Methods: C. albicans SC 5314 were grown overnight at 30\u00b0C in YPD and then transferred into RPMI medium. Cultures were then incubated either at 30\u00b0C (yeast) or 37\u00b0C (hyphae). After 3.5 h fungi were fixed and Raman spectroscopy was performed. In addition, intermediate morphological forms were analyzed by investigating samples of seven time points from 0 to 2.5 h. Statistical analysis followed, as well as false color images were generated. Results: Using principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis a clear separation based on spectroscopic fingerprint could be detected between yeast and hyphae. The most apparent changes were found in bands around 1259, 1340 and 1458 cm -1 representing amide III (proteins), nucleic acids and CH deformation (proteins/lipids), respectively. Our statistical model discriminated already after 30 min between yeast form of C. albicans and fungi developing into hyphae. Displaying similar Raman spectra in the same color yielded false color images of the cell in which the nuclei were clearly visible. Conclusions: Even when differences are not yet noticeable in morphology, elongating fungal cells can be spectroscopically separated from yeast cells, but also from fully elongated hyphae. A change in nucleic acid and protein composition of yeast and hyphae could be due to a different nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. Here, we also showed that imaging of C. albicans yeast and hyphae is possible without labeling the cells using Raman spectroscopy.

Introduction: In the last decades substantial problems in animal sepsis research remained unsolved. Methods for severity assessment and stratification were insufficient to predict sufficiently imminent death during sepsis. While a loss of body weight (BW) or determination of clinical severity score (CSS) are commonly used, new methods as echocardiography or monitoring of blood parameters such as IL-6 are complex and invasive. We developed a continuous, automatic, non-contact temperature monitoring (TEMP) approach, to assess severity, to predict risk for imminent and to function as an active or passive alert. Objectives: Validation of TEMP profiles to phenotype upcoming non-survivors in polymicrobial sepsis was used as a model for PS. 6-8 weeks after PCI-induction animals were subjected to multidimensional behavioral test to analyze basic health parameters, locomotion, anxiety-related behavior, and spatial learning. Synaptic function and plasticity of these animals were analyzed in acute hippocampal brain slices via field potential recording and induction of long-term potentiation in the Schaffercollateral CA1 pathway. Spine morphology was examined using golgi-cox staining. Effects of environmental enrichment on cognitive impairment were tested in mice after PCI. Results: We found no obvious abnormalities in surviving mice after recovery of 6 weeks by a standard phenotypic screen. Animals of the PCI group showed significant reduced capabilities in learning the location of the hidden platform in the Morris water maze in comparison to sham treated animals. Further, mice after PCI had increased level of fear-related behavior. Synaptic plasticity in the Schaffercollateral CA1 pathway was impaired and spine density was reduced in the PCI-group. Environmental enrichment had a beneficial effect on spatial learning. Conclusions: Mice subjected to PCI show reduced learning performance and increased anxiety-related behavior 6 weeks after faeces injection resembling cognitive impairments in human sepsis survivors. Impaired long-term potentiation and decreased spine density points toward severely afflicted synaptic plasticity after sepsis. Further studies will focus on genetic and pharmacological strategies to interfere with defective synaptic plasticity pathways to finally alleviate cognitive impairment.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S24"}, {"text": "Infection 2015", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "107"}, {"text": "Genetic predisposition for aerobic exercise capacity does not influence sepsis survival", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "107"}, {"text": "LG (3), Britton SL (3) Introduction: Sepsis is the major cause for mortality in the critically ill and mitochondrial function allows distinguishing between survivors and non-survivors.

Complicated bacteremia can quickly lead to septic shock, meningitis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis and other metastatic complications. Staphylococcus aureus, P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae are the most common bacteria responsible for nosocomial bacteremia. Severity of outcome for bacteremic patients is correlated to both the bacterial load and duration of bacteremia. (Kirkbright 2011; Fowler 2003) Drug resistance is currently a major threat to world health, and it is estimated that worldwide healthcare costs may exceed $20 billion with an additional lost productivity cost as high as $35 billion/year. Poor antibiotic stewardship is a contributing factor to the emergence of drug resistance, as up to 50 % of prescribed antibiotics are either not needed or improperly prescribed. An emerging therapeutic strategy to combat bacteremia, viremia, and fungemia, is to remove circulating pathogens with a sorption hemoperfusion device. Our strategy relies on natural mechanisms that bacterial adhesins use in their initial attachment to endothelial tissue during colonization of their human hosts, and subsequent pathogenesis. Engineering high-area surfaces with specific biomimetic binding sites, creates an extracorporeal affinity adsorption media that can quickly remove pathogens from whole blood, while also providing a very antithrombogenic, compatible blood-contacting surface. Specifically, we have modified, small biocompatible polymer beads with covalent, endpoint-attached heparin to target circulating pathogens, toxins, and cytokines present in bacteremic or viremic whole blood. Heparin is a well-known analog of Heparan Sulfate (HS). A large number of bacteria, bacterial toxins, viruses, parasites, and fungi utilize HS segments on syndecans as an attachment site to subvert the immune system. Objectives: In this study, we investigated the ability of covalently end-point-attached heparin on ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) beads to remove both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant bacteria. The bacteria tested include CRE E. coli, CRE K. pneumoniae, ESBL K. pneumonia and MRSA. In addition, the simultaneous binding and removal of CRE and MRSA was studied to determine whether a heparin-functional adsorption media might also be able to treat polymicrobial infections, or whether different bacteria competitively bind to heparin. The rate of removal of bacteria must also be rapid, and adequate capacity should be provided in order to create a practical therapeutic sorbent hemoperfusion device. Methods: Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene beads were modified using pharmaceutical grade heparin. Immobilization of heparin onto the beads was performed as described by Larm et al. (Larm 1983) The resulting PE-beads, with covalent end-point attached heparin, were then sterilized with ethylenoxide (ETO) and outgassed. The sterilized beads (0.6 g) were packaged in 2.5 ml test filter syringes (Mobicol, Germany) with 90-micron top and bottom retaining plates. A total of three filter syringes were prepared for each pathogen. The microbiology testing was performed at Antimicrobial Test Laboratories, Round Rock, Texas, USA (ATL). For this study, the removal of high concentrations of bacteria suspended in defibrinated horse blood (Hemostat Laboratories) was evaluated. The bacteria were cultured using standard methods and diluted in the horse blood. The targeted CFU/mL concentration was typical of that used for antimicrobial drug testing and ranged between 1.0E + 05 and S26 Abstracts (2015) 43:S1-S73 770603. An aliquot of blood with a bacterial concentration of *106 CFU/mL was then passed through the filter syringe by gravity flow (N = 3), collected, and analyzed. Additional aliquots (N = 3) were saved to enumerate the starting concentration. The starting aliquots and filtrates were neutralized and enumerated simultaneously, and reduction in bacterial numbers determined (CFU/ml). For the polymicrobial binding study, MRSA and CRE K. pneumoniae were independently cultured as outlined above. Both bacteria were then diluted into a single sample of defibrinated horse blood. Aliquots were then either passed through the filter syringes (N = 3) or retained for starting concentration (N = 3) analysis as described above. Results: Depending on the starting concentration, up to 99.9 % of the challenge bacteria binds to the adsorption media. The percent reduction for MRSA, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, CRE E. coli, and CRE K. pneumoniae, and ESBL is shown in Table 1 . A single gram of the particulate adsorption media is shown to have a binding capacity of over 2 million CFU for E. coli. Simultaneous polymicrobial binding data of MRSA and CRE K. pneumoniae is consistent with binding that is not competitive, which suggests a different heparin binding sequence for each bacteria. When the heparinized media were challenged simultaneously with both MRSA and CRE K. pneumoniae, 83 % of the MRSA was removed and 46 % of the CRE K. pneumoniae was removed. This equates to the capacity of 5.6E + 05 CFU/ g for MRSA and 3.2E + 05 CFU/g for CRE K. pneumoniae. Conclusions: Here we report a potential new strategy for the treatment of BSI, even when caused by the most drug-resistant pathogens. This strategy should also be useful in treating polymicrobial infections as it appears that there is a lack of competitive binding among different bacterial species. This broad-spectrum sorbent hemoperfusion technology may be effective in quickly reducing the bacterial load in blood and thus potentially reducing or preventing morbidity and mortality associated with metastatic infections, sepsis and septic shock. The data demonstrate that an affinity adsorption hemoperfusion device could be used to remove a high concentration of circulating drug-resistant bacteria in blood and thereby become an effective adjunctive or alternative to antibiotic therapy.

Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, is one of the most important human pathogens associated with hospital and community-acquired infections. Testing its susceptibility to antibiotic treatment (AST) is a classic, time and resource consuming exercise for clinical microbiological laboratories. As in particular in the diagnosis of sepsis time to antimicrobial therapy is an independent predictor for death, rapid AST is life saving. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) has drastically changed the perception of innovative technologies as potential accelerators for AST.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "107"}, {"text": "Objectives: The aim of this work is to develop criteria and algorithms for evaluating and testing the effectiveness and speed of antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) with mobile optical fluid scanning and imaging devices (OFSID) with a potential for point-of-care-testing applications (POCT). Methods: To proof the principle feasibility of rapid AST, employing optical fluid scanning and imaging devices (OFSID), a commercially marketed device was tested on routine MRSA and MSSA strains with various initial inoculations. A total of 11,856 measurements were taken, involving various broths for microdilution with decreasing opacity and partial filtering to vary the media used for inoculation. Evaluation of bacterial activity was performed by parallel inoculation and incubation on agar plates. Results: The optical fluid scanning and imaging devices (OFSID) used for rapid AST essentially rely on opacity (turbidity) measurement, microscopic analysis and forward scattering to scan bacteria and estimate bacterial growth in fluids. The growth curves depicted by the OFSID may illustrate a device's principle capacity to distinguish bacterial growth from its potential antibiotic inhibition in time. Bacterial concentration data and bacterial growth values so far provided are, however, largely guess-estimates rather than precise measurement results and their precision varies according to the initial inoculation and fluid (broth) of the microdilution. Mass increase (growth in size) of the bacteria is hardly distinguished from their growth in number. The growth curves depicted by the OFSID allow for ideas on factors which influence bacterial growth, such as the initial inoculation, broth characteristics and antibiotic resistance factors of the bacterium. The variance of current OFSID measurements, however, does not-as of today-allow for a valid screening of 50 + bacterial strains to classify them according to the measured growth characteristics.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "107"}, {"text": "Conclusions: Fast results from AST using OFSID and relying on routine blood samples for diagnosing sepsis caused by MRSA depend on treating the sample (red blood cell depletion) and concentrating the pathogen prior to analysing it. Once a pathogen is analysed, a variety of algorithms, based for example on contrast segmentation and extraction of surface area (SESA), improve measurement results. Opacity (turbidity) assisted optical measurements have the highest level of confidence in the 10 7 and 10 8 cfu/ml range, when-in its upper end-MRSA populations reach an opacity (OD at 650 nm) of 0.5 in a standard MH broth. As in classical AST, there is an optimisation exercise (speed vs. accuracy) in rapid AST relying on OFSID. In a binary classifier system the trade-off and cost ratio between true positive and false negative AST results needs to be defined by the human OFSID operator prior to selecting the detecting range and to calculating and depicting cut-off values, e.g. through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and its illustrative curves. The present focus of OFSID development is tuned on mathematical optimisation and on establishing bio-information databases, which portray the growth characteristics of pathogens. Introduction: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) was discovered to be a cell surface receptor on both blood neutrophils and mature moncytes/macrophages. Its expression is upregulated in the presence of bacteria and fungi, whereas it is only weakly expressed in noninfectious disorders such as vasculitis or psoriasis.

The corresponding AUC of the MEDS score was 0.91; sensitivity 61 %, specificity 100 %. Simultaneous assessment of PSEP and MEDS score revealed an increased AUC of 0.95 with elevated sensitivity of 85 %, specificity 100 %. 24 patients died and 35 patients reached the combined endpoint during 30 day follow up. The number of deaths and combined endpoints were 7 (9.5 %)/11 (14.9 %), 14 (41.2 %)/19 (55.9 %) and 3 (50 %)/5 (83.3 %) in sepsis (n = 74), severe sepsis (n = 34) and septic shock (n = 6), respectively. 30-day mortality was 19.5 %, ranging from 10.3 % in the 1st to 32.1 % in the 4th quartile of PSEP. The course of PSEP levels during the first 72 h was associated with the effectiveness of treatment and outcome. Conclusions: PSEP demonstrated a strong relationship with disease severity and outcome and showed high diagnostic accuracy for differentiation between SIRS and sepsis and sepsis severity grades as well as for outcome prediction. The diagnostic and prognostic performance could be improved by the simultaneous assessment with the MEDS score. The course of PSEP during the first 72 h was related to patient's outcome.

For controls, blood from volunteering hospital personnel was included (n = 20). S1P concentrations in serum were measured by mass spectrometry and various blood parameters determined by routine assays. SOFA score was used to describe severity of the disease. Results: All three groups of patients had significantly (P \\ 0.001) lower serum S1P concentrations than controls (mean 580 nmol/L, SEM 24 nmol/L). The lowest S1P concentrations was found in the septic shock group compared to patients with severe sepsis and sepsis. S1P levels were positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and red blood cell count (RBC) and negatively correlated with: procalcitonin, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein and lactate. In a multivariate linear regression model S1P concentrations were significantly associated with SOFA score (P \\ 0.001).

Serum or plasma antibody binding to extracellular proteins of the eleven most common sepsis pathogens was quantified using ELISA or a Simple Western Assay (ProteinSimple). Dynamics in antibody binding were assessed in 49 sepsis patients at screening, diagnosis and during the course of sepsis as well as in twelve healthy subjects at comparable time points. Results: In healthy subjects, basal anti-bacterial IgG levels were highly variable, both between individuals and between the bacterial species. However, in each individual, these IgG levels were stable over at least 2 months. In contrast, sepsis patients frequently exhibited dynamic antibody profiles in the course of the disease. An increase of specific IgG could be detected in 39 % of patients with a microbiological diagnosis (14/36). Notably, also in one-third of sepsis patients without microbial identification of the pathogen (4/13) there was an increase of IgG binding to at least one of the tested bacterial species. In ten cases this increase was selective for one or two bacterial species, and this was in agreement with the microbiological diagnosis where available. However, in cases with an intraabdominal infection focus, an antibody response to more than one bacterial species was often observed. Conclusions: In sepsis patients the immune system reacts specifically to the invasive pathogen. Hence, kinetic studies of the antibody response to multiple bacterial antigens may complement the microbiological sepsis diagnosis. Introduction: In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, need for mechanical ventilation and refractory hypercapnia, pumpless veno-arterial interventional lung assist (iLA) devices are used as part of a lung-protective ventilation strategy. Delayed antimicrobial therapy increases the mortality in this group of high-risk patients in case of sepsis. Besides clinical signs and symptoms, treatment is based on the kinetics of biomarkers, like Procalcitonin (PCT).

Introduction: Global activation of the immune system controversially called Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) occurs after a variety of different sterile and infectious insults like sepsis or trauma. The response is initially triggered by the presence of damage or pathogen associated molecular patterns, which bind to a heterogeneous and evolutionary conserved class of pattern recognition receptors, leading to the activation of innate immune cells at first and delayed to a compensatory phase of impaired immunity. One of these sensors is the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), a multi-ligand receptor recognizing different metabolic and inflammatory ligands.

Conclusions: We demonstrated that cfDNA as well as exRNA levels were elevated in septic patients within the first 24 h compared to postsurgical patients and healthy subjects.

Septic patients were identified by the following ICD-10 abstraction strategies for sepsis and severe sepsis applied to patients primary and secondary discharge diagnoses: (1) Conclusions: Existing ICD coding strategies differ in their accuracy of identifying patients with sepsis and severe sepsis in administrative data. Explicit coding strategies are limited in their sensitivity, but have a better positive prediction than implicit coding strategies. Current estimates on sepsis cases in Germany based on clinical sepsis codes (R codes) are likely to underestimate the true sepsis incidence. Introduction: Guidelines recommend that two or more sets of blood cultures (BC) are taken as soon as possible in severe sepsis or septic shock. If 3 sets are taken, probability of isolation of pathogens rises beyond 90 % and resistograms allow tailoring anti-infective therapy, thus sparing unwanted effects, development of antimicrobial resistance, and costs. Yet, accordance to these recommendations is low. As part of the intervention of the Medical Education for Sepsis Source Control and Antibiotics-trial (MEDUSA, ClinicalTrials.gov-Identifier NCT01187134, a German-wide, prospective, cluster-randomized, multicenter trial with 39 participating ICUs), the number of blood cultures taken was benchmarked and provided as feedback to each center. One of the MEDUSA-trial centers, the German Armed Forces Hospital Berlin, had focussed on a 3-sets-strategy in the 6 months prior to the first MEDUSA-trial feedback, trying to raise sets of BC taken from 2 to 3, using various communication strategies (e.g. official announcements, seminars, morning rounds, intranet, and mail). Nevertheless, the first benchmark revealed a rate of 0 % of 3 BC taken from patients with severe sepsis and septic shock (with [60 % of cases with 2 sets).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "104"}, {"text": "Abstracts (2015) 43:S1-S73", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S40"}, {"text": "Objectives: We report the effects of an improvement measure implemented in one center of the MEDUSA-trial after a structured analysis of a systematic error.

Methods: In a retrospective analysis we compared blood cultures which were incubated and analyzed in an external microbiological laboratory (2010) (2011) (2012) to blood cultures that were incubated on site, close to the patient directly at an intensive care unit (ICU) (2013) (2014) (2015) . Blood cultures were incubated in an automated continuous monitoring blood culture system for 6 days. When organism growth was detected by fluorescence, an alarm sound signaled a positive blood culture. Only positive blood cultures were transported to the external microbiological laboratory for further processing and analysis. Blood cultures which remained in the incubator for 6 days without growth-detection were classified negative and were discarded. Time to positivity (TTP) and time to first available antimicrobial susceptibility results (TTR) were analyzed separately for the 'laboratory-group' and for the 'close-topatient-group'. Introduction: A decreased monocytic expression of HLA-DRA (mHLA-DR) measured by flow cytometry is currently the best marker for acute changes of the innate immune response during sepsis (1). However, flow cytometry is a time-sensitive technology which is not generally available for routine use. Using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR), good agreement could be shown between surface expression and mRNA levels (2 Conclusions: Using qPCR for measuring HLA-DRA mRNA shows results in line with flow cytometry in patients with SIRS and severe sepsis. Moreover, mRNA activity is strongly associated with a proven functional assay of the innate immune response (ex vivo LPS whole blood stimulation). Future interventional studies aimed at the immune response during sepsis should make use of these methods for optimizing target groups on a basis of biological plausibility and effectiveness of the intervention ( Introduction: Procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are two biomarkers most commonly used for the diagnosis of sepsis.

This paradigm should be the focal point of further sepsis quality improvement activities. Introduction: Probably the most widely used antibiotic for empirical treatment of infections in cancer patients (pts.) is piperacillin-tazobactam (PipTaz). The fixed combination is well tolerated and has an efficacy of approximately 50 % in febrile neutropenia. One reason for this low rate of efficacy may be underdosing-a phenomenon which has been postulated for critically ill pts. but has not been investigated in cancer pts. yet. Objectives: Plasma levels should be higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the most important pathogen (Pseudomonas spp.). Some authors argue it should be 4xMIC or at least 4xMIC for 50 % of the time. Methods: In this diagnostic study, cancer pts. who received empirical treatment with PipTaz (3 9 4.5 g/day) were included after written informed consent. For pharmacokinetic measurements PipTaz plasma levels of 6 patients were determined before and at defined time intervals (0.5, 1.0, 1,5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0 and 8.0 h after infusion). Moreover for 58 patients plasma levels were measured immediately before infusion (trough levels) and 4 h after the infusion (equivalent to 50 % of time). Measurements were performed by using tandem mass spectrometry. Clinical data are documented prospectively. In Jena, the MIC of Pseudomonas spp. lies at 16 mg/l with 4xMIC = 64 mg/l. Results: Pharmacokinetic measurements showed a rapid decline in PipTaz plasma levels after infusion (calculated plasma half-time 0.78 h). In the main part of the study 58 pts. were analysed (36 male, median age 66 years, 26/58 solid tumors, 18/58 leukemia and 14/58 lymphoma/myeloma). PipTaz was administered because of pneumonia (32/58), fever of unknown origin (14/58), gastrointestinal infection (5/ 58), urinary tract infection (4/58) or central line infection (3/58) . Median glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 87 (interquartile range (IQR) 68-96) ml/min. Serum levels of PipTaz were as follows: median trough level was 5.2 (IQR 1.8-22.2) mg/l, median level after 4 h was 46.2 (IQR 19.9-92.0) mg/l. PipTaz levels at both time points showed a negative correlation with GFR (r = -0.43, p = 0.001 for trough levels and r = -0.39, p = 0.003 for levels after 4 h). Twentythree pts. achieved a level [64 mg/l after 4 h and there was a trend towards fewer modifications of antibiotic treatment in this group (6/ 23 vs. 17/35, p = 0.1) . Conclusions: A significant proportion of cancer patients receiving PipTaz may be underdosed which seems to be particularly the case in pts. with good renal function. Changes in the antibiotic treatment regime occur more often when plasma levels are \\64 mg/l after 4 h. Further investigations are warranted to confirm the clinical value of therapeutic drug monitoring and dose-adjustment of beta-lactam antibiotics in this setting.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2071, "end": 2077, "text": "(3/58)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2614, "end": 2640, "text": "(6/ 23 vs. 17/35, p = 0.1)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Infection 2015"}, {"text": "Abstracts (2015) ", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S50"}, {"text": "In several studies and in in vitro data is demonstrated that the additional treatment with an extracorporal cytokine adsorption filter (CytoSorb \u00d2 ) may be helpful in patients with septic multiple organ failure due to increased blood cytokine levels by effective removal of toxic cytokine levels (1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12) .

Methods: We systematically searched Medline via PubMed and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) from 2009 to 2014. We included observational and intervention studies published in English or German evaluating the economic impact of interventions preventing the four most frequent HAIs (urinary tract infections, surgical wound infections, pneumonia, and primary bloodstream infections). Characteristics and results of the included articles were extracted using a standardized data collection form. Study and reporting quality were evaluated using SIGN and CHEERS checklists. All costs were adjusted to 2013 US$. Savingsto-cost ratios and difference values with interquartile ranges (IQRs) per month were calculated, and the effects of study characteristics on the cost-benefit results were analyzed. Results: Our search returned 2067 articles, of which 27 met the inclusion criteria. Most interventions aimed to prevent NIs by reducing person-to-person transmission (n = 7, 25.9 %), primarily by hand decontamination. The median savings-to-cost ratio across all studies reporting both costs and savings values was US $7.0 (IQR 4.2, 30.9), and the median net global saving was US $13,179 (IQR 5106, 65,850) per month. Smaller hospitals (\\500 beds compared with larger hospitals) with shorter intervention durations (B12 months compared with longer durations) exhibited higher savings-to-cost ratios. Higher savings-to-cost ratios were observed in studies that focused on pneumonia prevention compared with prevention programs focusing on other infections. The studies reporting quality was low. Only 14 articles reported more than half of CHEERS items appropriately. Similarly, an assessment of methodological quality found that only four studies (14.8 %) were considered high quality. Conclusions: Prevention programs for nosocomial infections have very positive cost-benefit ratios. Improved reporting quality in health economics publications is required. Introduction: Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of morbidity. The diagnosis is difficult due to nonspecific signs and symptoms. Biochemical markers suitable for differentiation between infected and non-infected newborns, diagnosis of sepsis, assessment of disease severity and monitoring of antibiotic therapy could be helpful in the patient management. Presepsin (PSEP) serves as mediator of the response to lipopolysaccharid from infectious agent. First studies have shown promising results in adult sepsis. Objectives: We thought to examine the diagnostic and prognostic validity of the point-of-care (POC) assay PATHFAST TM Presepsin (LSI Medience Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) in neonatal and pediatric sepsis and to evaluate the prognostic validity and clinical response of PSEP to therapeutic measures and outcome. The results should be compared with the established sepsis marker procalcitonin (PCT), the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Additionally, the reference interval of PSEP should be established in dependence from the age in newborns and children.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction:"}, {"text": "Methods: 91 hospitalized neonates and children (32 females; 59 males) aged 3 days to 211 (median 21) month were included. 41 individuals receiving antibiotic therapy (median age 2.5, IQR 0.3-44 months) were assigned to the patient group.

They are of interest for use as prognostic biomarkers in sepsis and as diagnostic tools in order to differentiate sepsis from sterile systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Objectives: Therefore we investigated the influence of cfDNA and exRNA on coagulation in septic patients and in patients after major abdominal surgery. Methods: 15 septic, 10 postsurgical patients and 10 healthy subjects were included in this study. For the septic and postsurgical collective, blood was collected at onset, after 24, 72 and 168 h. Real-time PCR was performed in order to quantify cfDNA of the 2 -globulin-gene and exRNA encoding for 2 -actine. General hemostasis parameters, thrombelastography and thrombaggregatometry were also conducted.Results: Septic patients did show elevated plasma cfDNA and exRNA levels in comparison to postsurgical patients suffering from SIRS (cfDNA: onset p = 0.012, 24 h p = 0.035, RNA: onset p = 0.004, 24 h p \\ 0.001) and healthy probands (cfDNA: all point of times p \\ 0.001; exRNA onset p = 0.019).

Results: In our particular animal model a surface temperature d 29.2\u00b0C was found as cut off value to predict mortality 12 h prior to death with AUC of 0.95 (Sens. 86; Spec. 98 %). Also, a relative drop of TEMP e 9 % from basal values predicts mortality 12 h before death (AUC 0.92; 70; 98 %).

TEMP is moderately correlated with CSS (r = -0.53; p \\ 0.05), but not with loss of BW (r = 0.09; p [ 0.05). TEMP allows identification of a pro-survival phenotype at an early time point (21 h) and with higher precision compared to either CSS or BW. Additionally, monitoring by TEMP is performed continuously and not at predefined arbitrary time points, free of additional stress and manipulation. Conclusions: Our results underline that continuous infrared monitoring is a powerful, non-invasive, highly reproducible, cost and timesaving tool to stratify mice undergoing sepsis of different severities in accordance to 3R.

However, the incidence rate of sepsis in the German pre-hospital emergency setting is unkown.Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of sepsis in the German pre-hospital emergency setting. Methods: After institutional review board approval, pre-hospital and clinical data of n = 1915 consecutive patients, admitted from May 2010 to April 2011 to the Jena University Hospital by emergency physicians were retrospectively analysed for the presence of sepsis, AMI or stroke. Sepsis diagnosis was based on consensus criteria and validated by an experienced intensivist. Clinical data was compared between patients with sepsis and those with AMI or stroke. Results: Sepsis was diagnosed in 154 (8 %) of the patients in comparison to 133 (6.9 %) with AMI or 96 (5 %) with stroke. Sepsis was present in 3.6 %, severe sepsis in 3.4 % and septic shock in 1 %. Patients with sepsis had a higher hospital mortality (19.5 %) than those with AMI (11.3 %) or stroke (18.8 %).

In Poland mortality of patients with severe sepsis remains hight and is about 50 %. Early recognition and timely interventions are very important for the outcome of septic patients. Postoperative septic complications are easy to diagnose and implement septic bundles. Patients with severe sepsis and septic shock are admitted and treated in the ICU. There are about 1000 patients with severe sepsis treated in the ICU every year in Poland. The mortality of patients with postoperative sepsis complication is the lowest compare to all patients with severe sepsis and septic shock Objectives: The analysis of diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of postoperative severe septic complications in patients with renal stones admitted to the multidisciplinary third referece ICU. Methods: Fifty-six patients were included to our study. Prospective analysis of patients with severe septic complications (SSC). Analysis comprise inflammatory reaction, pathogen, therapeutic intervention and the outcome.Results: Postoperative severe septic complications (SSC) which required ICU admission were diagnosed in 56 patients (35 women and 21 men)-this was 1.1 % of all patients who underwent endourological procedures in years 2009-2014. Severe sepsis occurred in 17 patients (30 %) and septic shock was diagnosed in 39 patients (70 %).The 86 % of patients had more than three organ failures. The mechanical ventilation support required 41.07 % of them, 23.2 % renal replacement therapy. Hospital mortality was 10.7 %. The most common etiological agents isolated from blood and urine were Gramnegative rods: Escherichia coli, Protheus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The empirical antibiotic therapy was successful in 95 % of patients. On admission day mean procalcitonine (PCT) blood concentration was 49.8 ng/ml. Mean APACHE score was 20.89 SOFA on admission was 9.8; mean SAPS II 40.9 and mean TISS score on admission was 31.6. Average length of stay in the ICU was 7.1 days. Conclusions: 1. Postoperative SSC complications may have severe clinical course and require multidisciplinary medical care. 2. Hospital mortality in this group is low about 10.7 %.Relevance of mycoses for morbidity and mortality in septic shock A prospective, single-center, observational study", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF47": {"text": "All patients with surgical SC during the intervention period of the MEDUSA trial (Medical Education for Sepsis Source Control and Antibiotics, ClinicalTrials.gov-Identifier NCT01187134, a German-wide, prospective, cluster-randomized, multi-center trial with 39 participating ICUs; July 2011 to June 2013) were analyzed in a preplanned subgroup analysis. TTSC was measured from the time of first documented sepsis-related organ failure to the time of first procedure. Success of source control was assessed by the local investigators. Results: Of a total of 4138 patients included in the MEDUSA trial, 1610 received surgical SC. In 221 patients source control was assessed as unsuccessful. Successful compared to unsuccessful SC was associated with longer time to SC (median [IQR] hours:4.33  [0.67, 18.9] and 1.35[-1.67, 8.3], pd 0.001) and with a higher risk of death within 28 days(3.00 [-0.59, 12.74] and 1.38[-1.72, 8.01], pd 0.001). Unsuccessful SC was associated with higher mortality (59 vs. 26 %, pd 0.001).

When time and adequacy were both considered as predictors, time had a non-significant effect (OR = 1.36, p = 0.064) and adequacy a significant effect (OR = 4.12, pd 0.001). Conclusions: Both success of SC as well as its timing have an impact on survival. Patients with a high TTSC are less likely to experience a successful SC. Our data suggest that TTSC should rather aim at 6 than 12 h.Acknowledgement: Financial support by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) via the Integrated Research and Treatment Center, Center for Sepsis Control and Care (CSCC, FKZ 01EO1002) is highly acknowledged.

Furthermore, the continuation of beta-blocker therapy may prevent further complications. Future studies in a randomized, controlled design are needed to verify these findings.Transfusion practice in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock was not affected by cardiac comorbidities: a retrospective study Klages C (1), Fuchs C (1), Scheer C (1), Kuhn SO(1), Vollmer M (2), Hahnenkamp K (1), Gr\u00fcndling M (1) (1) Department of Anaesthesiology, University Hospital Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany, (2) Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany. Introduction: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are frequently given to patients with sepsis or septic shock. Recently, a more liberal patient blood management was associated with negative effects in critically ill patients (Holst et al., NEJM). Several results suggest that the impact of RBC transfusions on mortality varies, dependent on the presence of cardiac comorbidity (Dejam et. al, Critical Care Medicine).Objectives: The aim of this retrospective study was to find differences in clinical transfusion practices in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock with and without cardiac comorbidities. Methods: We investigated 447 intensive care unit patients (2010-2013) with severe sepsis or septic shock who received RBC transfusion. We compared 4 groups: Group 1: patients without cardiac comorbidities before sepsis Group 2: patients with cardiac comorbidities before sepsis (myocardial infarction) Group 3: patients with cardiac comorbidities before sepsis (heart insufficiency, NYHA III IV)", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF51": {"text": "Predictors of 28-days-mortality", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Raw odds ratio\n</td><td>Adjusted odds ratio\n</td><td>P value (Wald's test)\n</td></tr><tr><td>Age </td><td>1.03 </td><td>1.03 </td><td>B0.001\n</td></tr><tr><td>SOFA total </td><td>1.27 </td><td>1.11 </td><td>0.001\n</td></tr><tr><td>SAPS2 </td><td>1.04 </td><td>1.02 </td><td>0.003\n</td></tr><tr><td>Time to antibiotics </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>0.313\n</td></tr><tr><td>Initial Lactate (mmol/L) </td><td>1.17 </td><td>1.12 </td><td>B0.001\n</td></tr><tr><td>Thrombocytes (G/l) </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>0.056\n</td></tr><tr><td>Time to source control[ 6 h </td><td>1.46 </td><td>1.36 </td><td>0.064\n</td></tr><tr><td>Source control unsuccessful </td><td>4.1 </td><td>4.12 </td><td>B0.001\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF52": {"text": "Introduction: Clinical registries are valuable tools for assessing long term benefits of medical applications.

monitoring temporal trends in occurrence and resistance of pathogens. To date, there are only few population-based studies available which focus on bloodstream infections. One of these studies has recently been established for the German Federal state of Thuringia connecting both hospitals and microbiological laboratories within an electronic registry for immediate integration and evaluation of blood culture (BC) findings (AlertsNet, www.alertsnet.de). The registry includes microbiological results and clinical data of patients with clinically relevant positive BCs as well as institutional variables (e.g. case severity indices) of the participating centers. Objectives: The aim of the current analysis is to provide initial findings from this registry. Methods: Demographic and clinical data from all patients with microbiological evidence of a bloodstream infection in the time from May 2014 to May 2015 have been obtained from participating hospitals and have been linked to BC results collected via an automated electronic blood culture (BC) registry. Information on underlying causes as well as on disease progression was analyzed using measures of descriptive statistics. Risk factors for death were determined using logistic regression models. Results: In total, 812 patients (60.0 % male) with a median age of 71 (IQR: 59-79) years were included in this study. Of these, 60.8 % suffered from a nosocomial bloodstream infection, while the remaining 39.2 % were infected outside the hospital setting. Patients showed a clear heterogeneity of disease progression in the 96 h after BC sampling, ranging from sepsis without organ dysfunction (50.8 %) to severe sepsis (37.0 %) and septic shock (22.2 %). The overall case fatality rate was 23.3 %. Risk factors for death include the need for central lines (OR 3.10, mechanical ventilation (OR 6.73, ) and pneumonia being the primary focus of the bloodstream infection (OR 1.88, 95 % 1.31-2.69). Conclusions: Conclusions: AlertsNet provides data on patients with a wide clinical range of bloodstream infections. Risk factors for a fatal disease outcome known from other studies could be replicated underlining the internal validity of AlertsNet.

To date, there are only few population-based studies available which focus on bloodstream infections. One of these studies has recently been established for the German Federal state of Thuringia connecting hospitals and microbiological laboratories within an electronic registry for immediate integration and evaluation of BC findings (AlertsNet, www.alertsnet.de). The registry includes microbiological test results, clinical data and detailed information on anti-infective treatment as well as institutional variables (e.g. case severity indices) from all patients with clinically relevant positive BCs at the participating centers.Objectives: The aim of the current analysis is to provide initial findings from this registry. Methods: Data from all patients with clinically relevant positive BCs, including daily updated information on anti-infective treatment as well as microbiological data on pathogens and resistance profiles, have been collected via an electronic blood culture (BC) registry from May 2014 to May 2015 and were analyzed using standard measures of descriptive statistics. Results: A total of 945 episodes of bloodstream infections in 812 patients were included in this study. In 306 (32.4 %) of the 945 episodes, empirical anti-infective treatment (with one to six different drugs) had been already administered when the first BC set was taken. Most frequently used regimens were piperacillin/tazobactam (30.7 %), ciprofloxacin (20.9 %), meropenem (14.7 %) and vancomycin (7.5 %). In the majority of episodes (57.4 %), anti-infective therapy was initiated after BC sampling; adaption of anti-infective therapy according to culture results was necessary at least once after BC sampling in 68.8 % of episodes where treatment was initiated after BC sampling, but in 98.4 % of episodes with therapy already in place when the first BC was taken (p \\ 0.001). Conclusions: The first 12 months of data collection in AlertsNet showed the study s potential for monitoring and evaluating treatment decisions in the context of increasing levels of antimicrobial resistance. Future analyses will allow giving pathogen-and resistancespecific information on initial therapy and treatment algorithms in a population-based setting which will be used for developing interventions in order to improve treatment of patients with bloodstream infections.Introduction: An effective antibiotic treatment is a crucial factor for treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock. To improve anti-infective cure it is important to keep the free drug concentration of time-dependent antibiotics like beta-lactam antibiotics above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for a maximal amount of time (Dickinson et al. 2011; Kumar et al. 2009 ). Extended and continuous infusion, respectively, are adapted to maintain serum drug concentration above the MIC. Results: We found no underdosing in group 6 in comparison to group 1 (14.1 % underdosing, p \\ 0.05), to group 3 (38.2 %, p \\ 0.01) and to group 5 (33.3 %, p \\ 0.01). Significant less underdosing has been observed in patients who received a bolus-loading dose (group 1, 2) compared to patients who received no bolus-loading dose (group 3, 4) (14.1 % vs. 38.2 %, p \\ 0.01; 29.3 % vs. 58.1 %, p \\ 0.01).Conclusions: This study demonstrates significant differences between dosing regimens. Continuous infusion and initial bolus-loading dose seem to achieve the lowest number of underdosages. However, it is mandatory to consider that this study included only 45 dosage profiles and there are a lot of other factors that influence the serum concentration. Yet, this study reveals that the implementation of a routine therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) will be very useful in order to optimize individual Meropenem dosing. Introduction: Purpura fulminans is a rare life-threatening condition which is characterized by disseminated thrombosis in dermal and systemic microcirculation, cutaneous hemorrhages with progressing necrosis and multiple organ failure. Sepsis-associated Purpura fulminans (SAPF) is associated with a mortality of up to 50 % and long term morbidity including amputation, skin graft transplantation and neurological sequelae. Epidemiological data on SAPF is scarce and evidencebased treatment guidelines have not been established yet. While restoration of the balance in the coagulation cascade is a declared therapeutic goal, evaluations of the efficacy of different therapeutic approaches in randomized clinical trials are still missing. Due to the rarity of the disease, the heterogeneity of patients and the short-term inclusion window, prospective randomized, placebo-controlled trials seem to be not feasible, although there is a pronounced need of systematic data collection and evaluation covering several aspects of SAPF. Methods: A prospective multicenter European registry of SAPF (NCT02238795) has been established in the first quarter of 2015. Participating centers will collect for the first time systematic information on the etiology, clinical course, biomarkers, treatment, morbidity and mortality of SAPF. Participating centers enter data on a safe website ( http://www.sapfire-registry.org) via web application on the servers of the Centre for Clinical Studies (ZKS) at the University Hospital Jena in the study management software ''OpenClinica \u00d2 ''. The software fully complies with regulatory requirements (GCP, 21 CFR Part 11). Results: Data accumulated by the SAPFIREregistry will be periodically evaluated and disseminated. Retrospective analysis of own data and regular access to aggregated information collected by other centers will enable the participants to monitor and update care quality standards. Conclusions: In many countries, medical registries are an established quality assurance tool, unlike controlled clinical trials, which have always tight selection criteria. Especially with rare acute diseases Introduction: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) and associated remote organ dysfunction (severe sepsis and septic shock) are among the most important causes of death in developed countries and significantly contribute to morbidity and health care costs. BSIs may arise in community-based patients or may complicate the patients course admitted to hospital as nosocomial infections. A number of nationwide initiatives exist that are concerned with registering and reporting selected blood culture pathogens and resistance rates (http:// www.rivm.nl/earss/). However, the approaches taken to date have not been representative of the population and are not directly used to improve health care. Objectives: To sustain and expand a population-based surveillance and warning system for the assessment of diagnosis, risk factors, treatment, and outcomes of hospitalized patients with BSIs among 2.2 Mio inhabitants in Thuringia. Methods: BC results are transferred from microbiological labs to an electronic blood culture registry (EBCR) via a secured network (VPN). Microbiological findings are analyzed and a request for clinical data is sent to the hospital in case of positive BC results. Clinical data are documented into a web-based case report form. Selected microbial blood culture isolates will be transferred to the CSCC Biobank. According to the publicly reported Quality Reports of Thuringian hospitals from 2011, currently 22,244 hospital beds are available for a total population of 2.2 Million. Excluding sending institutions with a low pretest probability for BSIs, a total number of 14,650 hospital beds (66 %) in about 37 hospitals or 5.35 Mio bed days per year in total have to be surveyed. 19 associated microbiological laboratories have to be connected. Figure: Data flow within the AlertsNet network Results: AlertsNet (www.alertsnet.de) started in July 2013. To date, 26 hospitals (and 7 in-patient rehabilitation centers) have signed contracts for commissioned data processing, which covers already 70 % of the eligible hospitals. Conclusions: Population-based data will be achieved within the next 3 years.
