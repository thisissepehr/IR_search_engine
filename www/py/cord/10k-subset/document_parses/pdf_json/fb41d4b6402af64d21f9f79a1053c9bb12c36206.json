Furthermore, the mean ratio of Tregs to all CD4? cells in the blood of our patients was twofold lower than in the cohort of Hein et al. [25] and did not correlate with the SAPS score. Thus, ratios of Tregs to all CD4? cells in patients with ARDS, even when evoked by pneumonia, appear to differ from those with sepsis. Furthermore, our results indicate that in patients with ARDS Treg cell measurements in the blood are not representative for those in the alveolar space.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 331, "end": 335, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our investigation also demonstrates that the microbiologic etiology of pneumonia-evoked ARDS did not influence the Tregs to CD4? ratio since the mean ratio in patients with bacterial and H1N1-evoked pneumonia was not different.

Unrecognized selection bias, inherent even to prospective studies, cannot be excluded. Moreover, although all ARDS patients were treated with a rather standardized multimodal regimen, due to the multifactor nature of this disorder, we cannot exclude that unknown potentially confounding factors exist. Furthermore, enrolled patients represent a selected cohort of ARDS patients since only those with ARDS evoked by CAP were included. Thus, results may not be representative for ARDS of other origin. In addition, the fact that patients taken as controls suffered from solid tumors may be problematic and could have altered the ratios of Tregs to all CD4? cells in some lung healthy controls. However, the controls were free of lung, cardiac, infectious, or allergic disease, and BAL for cell isolation was performed immediately following induction of anesthesia assuming that these BALs approximate the BAL of healthy subjects. Furthermore, using a control group with normal lungs may not take into account potential alveolar cell responses to mechanical stress independent of those resulting from CAP-evoked ARDS alone. On the other hand, mechanical ventilation in patients without pneumonia and/or ARDS is unlikely to evoke alveolar cell stress and damage unless deliberately ventilated with large tidal volumes. Thus, a control group looking at effects of cellular stress evoked by mechanical ventilation only is hard to find.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Nevertheless, although the study cohort may be considered small and the control group may not be ideal, multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed the ratio of Tregs to all CD4? cells to be an important and strong independent risk factor for 30-day mortality.
