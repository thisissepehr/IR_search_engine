Antibody to the coat protein, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), is known to neutralize viral infectivity and to contribute to the formation of the immune complexes which produce many of the extrahepatic manifestations of this disease [43, 57] . There is no evidence, however, that antibody to HBsAg is pathogenetically involved in HBV induced hepatocellular injury. Based on observations in other systems, it has been postulated [20] that anti-HBsAg might regulate HBsAg expression at the hepatocyte surface and perhaps viral genome expression as well, but this remains entirely conjectural at present. A second major antibody response is directed to the core antigen of the virus (HBcAg). The persistence of this response is one of the most sensitive serologic markers of continued hepatitis B virus replication, but it has not been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular injury. An independent group of antibody responses directed to various poorly defined normal hepatocellular antigens [47, 62] has also been identified. However, because the precise nature of the antigen is not known and because similar antibodies are found in patients with an assortment of other liver diseases, the primary pathogenetic involvement of this antigenantibody system in viral hepatitis B is in doubt. Finally, it is reasonable to question the importance of the humoral arm of the immune response in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular injury since both acute and chronic hepatitis are seen in patients with agammaglobulinemia [44] .",

In this regard, it is notable that defects in suppressor cell function putatively involved in maintenance of immunologic tolerance have been identified in patients with viral hepatitis [22, 46] .

HBV may infect the hepatocyte either directly or perhaps via a processing step involving the Kupffer cell which has been shown to play a role in the natural resistance to virus infections [70] . One the HBV genome is integrated into the host chromosomes, hepatocellular metabolism of normal immunoregulatory molecules is disturbed resulting in a complex imbalance, the net effect of which is the partial loss of normal suppressor cell function. This, in turn, leads to the expression of an assortment of auto-immune phenomena including the emergence and expression of autoreactive clones specific for hepatocyte membrane antigens. The ensuing cytolytic process results in the release of normally intracellular proteins that have immunosuppressive properties which down-regulate the cytotoxic effector cells locally within the liver. Normal genetic variation in the hepatocellular content of such immunoregulatory molecules may be responsible for the variable duration and intensity of this virus induced, immunologically mediated disease.",

Most investigators have observed a decrease in the number of E rosette forming T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of patients with AVH and CAH [19] , with no change in the B lymphocyte population. Since the number of peripheral blood lymphocytes capable of binding neuraminidase treated sheep red blood cells (another specific T cell marker) is normal in hepatitis B [33] reduced E rosette formation is thought to reflect a functional alteration rather than a quantitative depletion of peripheral blood T cells in this disease. Stimulation of DNA synthesis by polyclonal activators such as phytohemaglutinin (PHA) is another measure of T lymphocyte reactivity. PHA responsiveness is reduced in both acute and chronic viral hepatitis, it returns to normal with recovery [l] and remains normal in the healthy carrier state. These observations have prompted some investigators to suggest that the ultimate outcome of HBV infection may depend on the functional integrity of the T lymphocyte population. Because these systems are modulated by assorted cellular and molecular immunoregulatory events, the functional integrity of regulatory as well as effector cell populations may determine the course of HBV related disease.",

In acute hepatitis, Tavassolie et al. and Chisari et al. [22] have demonstrated decreased mitogen inducible suppressor cell activity while Hodgson et al. [46] did not. However, in Hodgson's group, three patients with acute hepatitis who were studied before the peak rise in serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) displayed reduced suppressor cell activity which returned to normal with resolution of the disease [46] . We [15, 22] have demonstrated that monocyte/mediated suppressor cell and mitogen induced (T cell) suppressor cell activity are decreased in acute and chronic hepatitis but return to normal with recovery. As in Hodgson's study, no correlation was observed between suppressor dysfunction and disease activity.

            "text": "The exact mechanisms responsible for suppressor cell dysfunction are unclear. However, Tavassolie et al. [86] have demonstrated that a factor present in the sera of patients with acute and chronic active liver disease inhibits the function of normal suppressor T cells in vitro. Additionally, we have observed (Fig. 2 ) that serum from patients with acute viral hepatitis B inhibits monocyte mediated suppressor cell activity. In a study of 48 hepatitis patients and 10 normal controls monocyte suppressor activity was reduced to 60% of reference levels when the assay was performed in the presence of 20% patient's serum. In contrast, normal control serum had no effect on suppressor cell function (F. V. Chisari, -unpublished observations). Thus, it is possible that at least a portion of the defects in suppressor cell activity in viral hepatitis may be due to abnormalities of the network of the immunoregulatory molecules normally present in serum. Since many of these molecules are synthesized in the liver [20] , it is conceivable that virus-induced alterations in hepatocellular metabolism may initiate the loss of suppressor cell function by virtue of the induction of circulating inhibitors. Precedent for this hypothesis exists and will be discussed and developed in depth in a later section.",

Several such studies have been performed using peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with hepatitis B viral infection as effectors against a variety of surrogate hepatocyte target [3, 21, 31, 37, 51, [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] . The inability to culture adult human hepatocytes has necessitated the use of other target cells [4, 10, 38] in these assay systems: for example, isolated rabbit hepatocytes, autologous human hepatocytes, a human liver derived continuous cell line (Chang) , the HBV producing PLC-PRF/5 cell line, the liver specific protein containing SK-HEP 1 hepatoma cell line, hepatitis B surface antigen coated avian red blood ceils, and liver specific protein coated pigeon red blood cells. In most of these assay systems, chromium-labeled target cells are employed. However, because unacceptably high levels of spontaneous cell death occur in human autologous hepatocytes, chromium release assays have not been feasible and, therefore, other parameters (adherence to plastic) have been employed to examine target cell viability in these studies [23, 31, 32, 37, 94] .",

Two maj or antigens have been implicated as possible candidates. The hepatitis virus or some component of it is a suitable candidate if deposited on the surface of the infected hepatocyte and, therefore, accessible to the immune system.

Excess hepatitis B surface protein circulates as 22 nanometer particles with spherical and filamentous morphology. An internal viral core antigen, HBcAg, is found almost exclusively within hepatocyte nuclei. HBcAg is assembled into 27 nanometer particles in the nucleus from whence it moves to the cytoplasm where it is enveloped with surface protein and is transported into the vascular compartment where it circulates as a 44 nanometer Dane particle. The e antigens [-59 ] are a group of poorly delineated molecules which were initially suggested to represent antibodies of restricted heterogeneity that bind Dane particles. Ncurath and Strick [74] have proposed that the antigenic determinants of e represent idiotypic determinants of what may be an lgG4 immunoglobulin and thus anti-e would then represent anti-idiotype antibody. Other workers have provided compelling evidence that HBeAg is a structural component of the viral core [69] . Nonetheless, the e antigen complex has not been identified at the cell surface and it is, therefore, unlikely that e is a viable target antigen in this system. HBsAg is expressed at the cell surface during the acute phase of type B viral hepatitis. In more chronic forms, it appears to be confined primarily to the cytoplasm and is not often expressed at the cell membrane [2] . Unlike HBsAg, which is characteristically located within hepatocyte cytoplasm and at the cell surface where it is accessible as a potential target antigen, the core antigen has never been identified on the hepatocyte surface and is only rarely present in the cytoplasm [75] . Therefore, HBcAg is probably not a potential target antigen in this disease. Since Warnatz et al. [-93] and Alberti et al. [3] have demonstrated cellular cytotoxicity to HBsAg coated target cells in patients with CAH, this or some other related, hitherto unknown viral antigen might be a pathogenetically important target in this disease. Of great interest is the reported progression of HBsAg positive acute hepatitis to HBsAg negative chronic hepatitis [78] in which currently identifiable antigens cannot be implicated. Such evidence suggests that host determined antigens may prove to be of paramount importance as pathogenetic determinants regardless of the HBsAg status of the patient.",

Among these the most likely candidate is liver specific protein (LSP), a hepatocyte membrane lipoprotein [7, 14] , which has been demonstrated by immunofluorescence on the surface of rabbit and human hepatocytes. The potential importance of LSP was initially demonstrated by Meyer Zum Buschenfelde [62] and colleagues who chronically immunized rabbits with human LPS. Following an intensive sequence of injections, the rabbits developed histologic evidence of chronic active hepatitis [64] which correlated very well with parameters of cellular immunity to both human and rabbit LSP. More recently, several investigators have detected antibodies to LPS [49] in the serum of patients with HBsAg positive acute and chronic hepatitis. Cellular sensitization to liver specific antigens also occurs in viral hepatitis and has been demonstrated in patients with acute and chronic hepatitis, but most notably it disappears with recovery [55, 65, 84] . Thus, sensitization to LSP appears better correlated with hepatocellular injury than sensitization to HBsAg which persists after recovery. The loss of sensitization also correlates in separate studies with recovery of normal suppressor cell function and suggests that sensitization to LSP may have an autoimmune basis (Table 4 ). In cytoxicity studies using rabbit or autologous human hepatocytes as targets, nearly all patients displayed LSP specific cytotoxic effector cell activity during the acute and chronic phases of viral hepatitis which disappeared coincident with recovery as above, further supporting the auto-immune hypothesis.",

Vogten et al. [90] recently described a phagocytic cytotoxic effector cell for pigeon red blood cells coated with liver specific lipoprotein (LPS) in patients with chronic active hepatitis. Alberti and colleagues [-3] found cytolytic T lymphocytes specific for hepatitis B surface antigen in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell population in patients with acute and chronic hepatitis. However, the significance of these observations is unclear because, in spite of the apparent antigen specificity in these systems, the expression of antigens chemically coupled to xenogeneic cells from irrelevant organs certainly differs from their natural expression in autologous or allogeneic hepatocytes. Cytolytically active non-T cells specific for rabbit hepatocytes have been described in patients with chronic active hepatitis [-23, 31, 94] . Additionally, rat hepatocyte targets have been shown to be susceptible to injury by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with chronic active hepatitis [39] .

By so doing, we hope to determine whether one or both surface proteins are relevant antigens in hepatitis B virus induced hepatocellular injury. Chang cells (which lack LSP and HBsAg) were used as specificity controls and also for comparison with the published reports of others. Spontaneous and mitogen induced cytotoxic effector cell activity towards human hepatocyte cell lines which naturally express surface membrane LSP and HBsAg were not observably increased in any patient group in our study. This was surprising in view of published reports that patients with hepatitis B virus associated chronic active liver disease possess phagocytic cytotoxic effector cells active against LSP coated pigeon red blood cells in patients with acute and chronic HBV infections [-90 ] and cytotoxic T cells specific for HBsAg coupled to chicken red cells [3] . This discrepancy is not easily explained except on the basis of the nature of the target cells used in the different studies. Conceivably, prior biochemical purification and conjugation of HBsAg and LSP to non-mammalian cell surface membranes may have exposed antigenic determinants not present on the HBsAg and LSP positive targets used in the present study. Whether a cytotoxic response to such altered antigens is relevant to the putative pathophysiologic response in vivo is not known. Alternatively, although serologically detectable LSP and HBsAg determinants exist on the human hepatoma cell lines we employed, it is conceivable that these molecules express serologically undetectable lymphocyte defined antigens which are either buried in the target cell membrane or genetically deleted from these cell lines.",

First, contrary to our hypothesis, hepatocyte injury in the course of viral hepatitis may not result from cellular immune effector mechanisms. However, lacking proof of another cause, we consider this interpretation premature. Second, cellular immune mechanisms may be operative but the specific effector cell either does not circulate or is preferentially removed from the peripheral blood compartment by binding to hepatocyte surface antigens. Although this interpretation is testable by examining the cytotoxic effect or capability of intrahepatic lymphoid cells, substantial technical difficulties make the execution of these experiments impractical at present. Therefore, this approach is restricted to animal model systems with the assumption that the pathogenetic mechanisms are similar in human and animal species. Third, cellular immune mechanisms may be operative but the target cells employed in the current studies do not express the target antigens recognized in vivo. Alternatively, the relevant antigens may have been present on these target cells but certain biologic requirements for the expression of a cytotoxic response to these antigens may not have been fulfilled in our assay systems including the expression of a latent, antigenspecific cytotoxic response. In this respect, the observations of Zinkernagel and Doherty [-95] demonstrating that effector and target cells must share certain histocompatibility antigens as a prerequisite for the expression of a virus specific cytotoxic effector cell response are particularly germane [26] .",

It inhibits E rosette formation in an active metabolic fashion and does not merely interfere with the binding of the T lymphocyte and the sheep red blood cell on a steric hindrance basis. Thus, RIF represents a prototype abnormality in the molecular immunoregulatory system which occurs in patients with viral hepatitis. Other abnormalities are likewise known to occur in this disease: a variety of major structural abnormalities in the plasma lipoproteins have been reported in viral hepatitis and other liver diseases [81] and alpha fetoprotein levels increase in association with hepatocyte regeneration in hepatitis [82] . It is reasonable to postulate, therefore, that certain manifestations of lymphocyte dysfunction observed in patients with viral hepatitis might be related to either hepatic induction of new abnormal regulatory molecules such as RIF or the quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in the hepatic metabolism of other normal molecules. The net effect of altered immunologic reactivity would then depend on the selective induction of specific abnormalities in the biosynthesis of individual immunoregulatory molecules and one would expect these to vary from patient to patient.",

The reticuloendothelial system, and in particular the intrahepatic fixed macrophages (Kupfer cells), may conceivably play a pivotal role in removal of infectious virions from the circulation before they gain access to hepatocytes. Indeed, it is likely that in most instances of HBV infection the reticuloendothelial system adequately destroys the virus and protects the hepatocyte from viral parasitization and subsequent disease. This suggestion is compatible with the relatively high frequency of subclinical or inapparent hepatitis B virus infection in most human populations. If the viral inoculum is sufficiently large to overwhelm the reticuloendothelial system or if the macrophage is unable to adequately neutralize the virus, then hepatocyte infection and disease may follow.",

Hepatocellular injury may result from cellular attack systems which are specific for surface membrane autoantigens such as LSP or for viral antigens if and when they are expressed at the hepatocyte surface. The specific cytolytic effector systems which may be responsible for hepatocytolysis cannot currently be identified. Indeed, the specific target antigen is unknown and the requirements for effective cytolytic activity in vivo are unclear. If T cell mediated cytotoxicity is important in this process, the tenets of the genetic restriction hypothesis would have to be fulfilled. Identification of this pathogenetically important phenomenon with in vitro assay systems must therefore await the development of a target cell which expresses both the relevant target antigens and shares the necessary histocompatibility loci with the effector cells.",

Since the biosynthesis of many of these molecules depends upon normal hepatocellular function and since qualitative and quantitative abnormalities of the molecular immunoregulatory system are known to occur during viral hepatitis (e. g. RIF), it is reasonable to postulate that viral genome incorporation into hepatocyte chromosomes results in dysfunctional immunoregulatory metabolism and secondary inhibition of normal suppressor cell function. Indeed we have shown (Fig. 2 ) that molecules which inhibit suppressor monocyte activity are detectable in the circulation of patients with acute viral hepatitis. Conceivably, they might allow the emergence of a normally suppressed cellular immune response to host or viral antigens on the hepatocyte surface resulting in hepatocellular injury.",
