Case presentation: A 47-year-old patient started presenting a prodromic period with fever, dyspnea, cough and head ache. This clinical presentation was followed by a rapid respiratory, hemodynamic and renal failure leading to admission in the ICU. Biological exams revealed an increased haematocrit level with a paradoxical low protein level. Echocardiographic and hemodynamic monitoring showed a normal left ventricular function with low filling pressures, an elevated extravascular lung water index and pulmonary vascular permeability index.

All other biological tests including the dosage of hepatic, muscular and cardiac enzymes were normal on admission. Chest X-Ray showed bilateral alveolar infiltrates and bilateral pleural effusion. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal and homogeneous left ventricular contractility with low filling pressures, with an aortic Velocity Time Integral (VTI) of 10 cm (normal: 18-25 cm), a normal right heart function with Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) at 14 mm (normal: 15-20 mm), and a small pericardial effusion. Hemodynamic monitoring using transpulmonary thermodilution (PiCCO system; Pulsion Medical Systems SE, Feldkirchen, Germany) showed a cardiac output (CO) of 4.2 l/min (normal: 4-8 l/min), a global end diastolic volume index (GEDVI) of 610 ml/m 2 (normal: 680-800 ml/m 2 ), an extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) of 26.7 ml/kg (normal: 3-7 ml/kg), and a pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) of 6.3 (normal: 1.0-3.0). Chest computed tomography showed vessels enlargement, peribronchial cuffing, bilateral Kerley lines, alveolar edema, and abundant right pleural effusion needing pleural drainage. The protein level in the pleural fluid was 43 g/l and the microbiological culture was sterile. The viral investigations (IgM and RT-PCR in the blood) confirmed an acute infection by Hantavirus. The complete RNA coding sequence of the S RNA segment (GenBank accession no. MG785209) was also generated and compared with those of the other 5 previous hantavirus cases from French Guiana using a Bayesian approach. This S RNA sequences showed a nucleotide identity of 95.9 to 99.5% with the five other previously described sequences of the Maripa virus belonging to the Rio Mamor\u00e9 clade. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred from alignment with 1308 nt of the S segment [4] . Laboratory testing concerning other infectious agents (bacteria, fungal or parasite) were negative.",

Disruption of cell junctions, with combination of cell retraction process, lead to the loss of the vascular endothelium barrier function. In such conditions, fluids and proteins infusion are ineffective because of the immediate leakage to the interstitial space with a worsening of the respiratory failure without any efficacy on the hemodynamic state. This mechanism is similar to that reported by Clarkson in 1960 and is explained by a plasma leakage [6] which was also described in arbovirus infections where the diagnosis was based on thoraco-abdominal sonography and scanography [7] [8] [9] .",

Some evidence suggest that hantavirus disease pathogenesis is immunologically mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and other immune cells in target organs producing inflammatory cytokines. Overall, three hypotheses have been reported to explain the mechanism of increased capillary permeability involved in hantavirus infection: a) the attack of infected endothelial cells by virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), b) TNF-\u03b1 production by infected monocyte/macrophages and finally c) the direct effect of the virus on the endothelial cell functions [5, 10] . Bradykinin, a potent inflammatory and vasoactive nonapeptide generated by kallikrein at the sites of tissue injury is supposed to be the key mediator of the vascular leakage resulting from hantavirus infection. It acts by disrupting inter-endothelial junctions and causes changes in vascular tone. Two patients with severe capillary leak syndrome caused by a Puumala hantavirus infection were successfully treated with a bradykinin receptor antagonist [11, 12] . Experimental data demonstrating the plasma kallikrein-kinin system activation during hantavirus infection were also reported [13] . In the same way, the intensity of the inflammatory syndrome was correlated to the importance of the capillary leakage and to the level of thrombocytopenia [14] .",

These data were based on the examination of postmortem tissue from human HPS cases [15] . However, in our case, myocardial dysfunction was neither observed during echocardiography and nor during PICCO investigation. Any inotropic agent support has been needed. In addition, Troponine levels were normal despite severe shock. Consequently, we think that Maripa virus is more responsible for HPS rather than HCPS. Such a finding is important as it raises the question about the effectiveness of extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients presenting Maripa Virus infection with severe shock.",

The severity of the disease may be explained by a dysregulated inflammatory and immune reaction causing a severe capillary leakage without cardiac involvement.
