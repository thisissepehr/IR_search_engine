Most often these rates must be estimated from longitudinal field data, which are costly and time-consuming to conduct. Consequently, measures to reduce cost like increased sampling intervals or subsampling of the population are implemented. To assess the impact of such measures we implement two different SIS models to simulate disease transmission: A simple closed population model and a realistic dairy herd including population dynamics. We analyze the accuracy of different methods for estimating the transmission rate. We use data from the two simulation models and vary the sampling intervals and the size of the population sampled. We devise two new methods to determine transmission rate, and compare these to the frequently used Poisson regression method in both epidemic and endemic situations. For most tested scenarios these new methods perform similar or better than Poisson regression, especially in the case of long sampling intervals. We conclude that transmission rate estimates are easily biased, which is important to take into account when using these rates in simulation models.",

In these models, transmission rates are used to describe the flow of individuals in a population going from a susceptible state to an infected state, and it is important to obtain a realistic estimate of the transmission rates in order to create a useful and realistic simulation models for decision support 11-13 . Accurate estimation of this rate is important because it can have a major influence on model predictions and conclusions (e.g. refs 11,14 ). The rate may have different names depending on the specific mathematical representation of transfer between susceptible and disease states, e.g. infection rate, transmission coefficient and transmission rate. This key parameter is difficult to estimate for most host-pathogen models because natural processes are stochastic, and transmission events are influenced by other parameters than what can be included in a transmission model 1,15 . Thus, large datasets are often needed to reach a good estimate.",

This can be the case for instance if animals must be caught prior to sampling, if the population is large, or if the test for disease is expensive 17 . In such situations subsampling can be a convenient method, but the precision of the estimate can be jeopardized by sampling fewer individuals. We wanted to quantify this in the present study.",

On top of that, data from biological systems most often contains noise that may impact the estimated rate. Numerous studies have estimated the transmission rate from field data 11, 16, 19 . However, few studies have evaluated how precise the estimated transmission rates actually are. O'Dea et al. 20 recently used Poisson regression to estimate the transmission rate and showed that the precision of the estimate increased with the number of outbreaks used for estimation. Cook et al. 21 used Bayesian inference to show that it is important to take spatial population heterogeneity into account when estimating transmission rates.

Most of these studies have used Poisson regression to estimate the transmission rate from real life data, although a few also used negative binomial regression. A challenge of estimating transmission rates is that a low rate can result in very low numbers of or no new infections per time period, which can prevent the use of regression procedures with a log-link.

The SIScom model was created by merging the transmission framework for intramammary infection created by Halasa et al. 14 with the iCull simulation model described by Kirkeby et al. 28 . Briefly, the iCull model simulates a dairy herd with 200 cows and after a 3 year burn in period the SIScom model is started. We recorded data during a single simulated year. In the model, all cows are simulated realistically where they typically calve and lactate for around 350 days. Then they are dried off in about 56 days and then they calve again. The farmer takes weekly decisions on culling, choosing the lowest producing cows for slaughter. Individuals can also be culled due to diseases like infection. Individuals are only culled when new heifers, raised in the herd, enter the lactation stage. Thus the number of individuals is kept fairly stable. The transmission framework was adopted from Halasa et al. 14 , simulating intramammary infections (IMI). Susceptible individuals can be infected with IMI and enter a subclinical or a clinical stage. Infections in subclinical individuals can flare up, and the infection in clinical individuals can be subclinical again (remission). Finally, infected individuals can recover from disease and be susceptible again. The disease spread is analogue to the differential equations:",
