Because of its obvious importance for the production of progeny virus, the budding process may provide an effective target for anti-viral therapy. Defects in viral budding have also been implicated in altered viral pathogene~is('-~). In the mammalian cell, viruses can bud from the nuclear membrane (herpesviruses), into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (flavi-and hepadnaviruses), into the pre-Golgi compartment (coronaviruses and poxviruses), into the Golgi (bunyaviruses) or at the plasma membrane (PMt). This review will focus on budding at the PM. Viruses that bud at the PM include arena-, alpha-, rhabdo-, paramyxo-, orthomyxo-and retroviruses. Very little is known about arenavirus budding, and therefore we will restrict our discussion to the other virus groups.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The budding and maturation process involves the interaction of many components. Viral capsid proteins bind to the nucleic acid of the virus, forming the nucleocapsid (NC). The NC may interact directly with viral transmembrane (TM) proteins, or with viral matrix proteins lining the inner leaflet of the membrane. Binding of matrix proteins to the membrane may be catalyzed by covalent addition of lipids to the pro-TAbbreviations: PM, plasma membrane; NC, nucleocapsid; TM, transmembrane; BHK, baby hamster kidney; RNP, ribonucleocapsid; GPI, glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol; MA, membrane. teins and/or by interaction with TM proteins. Ultimately, the PM bends around the viral core, pinching off an enveloped viral particle, and releasing it into the extracellular medium. Although release of core-containing particles can, in some cases, occur in the absence of TM envelope (spike) proteins, inclusion of spikes in the virion is required for making the particle infectious. In addition to core-spike interactions, lateral interactions between spike components in the plane of the membrane may play an important role in the life cycle of the viruses. Such lateral interactions may serve to facilitate the budding process by catalyzing patch formation (i.e. the formation of aggregates of budding components, including lipids and proteins), and by formation of multiple presentation motifs for binding to the core. The lateral interactions also ensure that correct combinations of spike proteins for assembly and infectivity are formed. Viral budding may not be a simple task, since in most cases virion membrane curvature is extensive, leading to large differences in surface areas of the inner and outer leaflet of the virion envelope (e.g. the outer leaflet of the alphavirus envelope is 40% larger than the inner leaflet). Another complexity is how the viral bud rapidly and accurately pinches off from the PM. Recent data suggest that virus release is dependent on the state (composition, fluidity, etc) of the membrane, which may be modulated by viral and host proteins. The lipid content also seems to play a role in these processes. While the viruses which bud from the PM utilize different strategies for budding, the basic principles of assembly and release seem to be universal.

The viral envelope also has a T=4 icosahedral symmetry, containing 240 copies each of the spike proteins E l and E2 which, in three pairs of E2E1 heterodimers, form 80 spike structure^(^$^).

Within this repeat, substitution of the Tyr residue by Phe or Trp results in reversions selected at a rapid rate, suggesting a Tyr requirement for optimal budding (12) . The Leu residue in position +2 from the Tyr is also important for budding(l37l4). A hydrophobic pocket on the capsid protein is involved in binding the Tyr and Leu residues of the E2 tai1 (13, 15) .

Until recently, the prevailing belief was that preformed cytoplasmic NCs are precursors in budding. More recent results, however, indicate that another pathway may be used as well. When the spike binding pocket was mutated to block entry of the E2 tail Tyr side-chain, C became deficient in stable cytoplasmic NC formation. Nevertheless, this did not abolish budding of virus, which still occurred with substantial efficiency (15) . Other studies, in which mutations within the central region of C were generated, also yielded variants which were deficient in stable cytoplasmic NC formation but nevertheless could bud quite e f f i~i e n t l y (~~, '~) . Recent X-ray data of C protein crystals have provided a possible explanation for these observations (13) .

Mutation of this motif in the middle region of C results in aggregation of the C protein. Thus, mutation of either the arm or the arm (spike) binding pocket results in inability to form NCs, but does not abolish budding. This suggests that binding of the arm serves some assembly function, and implies that budding, even for wild-type virus, may occur by two pathways using either preassembled or co-assembled NCs. While NC-spike interactions seem to be defined for alphaviruses, the role of the small 6K TM protein is still an enigma. This palmitylated protein is transported to the PM in complex with the E2E1 heterodimer but little of the 6K is incorporated into new virions. However, when the gene encoding 6K is deleted from the genome, virus budding is reduced by as much as 100-fold, and NCs accumulate underneath the PM suggesting that an initial interaction with the spike has occurred(lg). The few virions produced from the 6K deletion appear to be of wild-type size and shape, and properties such as binding to new cells, entry and fusion appear to be unaltered (20 less marked in cells with a more fluid (less viscous) membrane such as insect cells (20), where the sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine contents are low (go/, and 14% respectively) compared to the PM of mammalian cells (e.g. 25% and 27%, respectively in BHK cells), and where the cholesterol to lipid ratio is very low (1 :6) compared to that in BHK cells (1:l). Mutation of 6K, which abolishes palmitylation, leads to impaired envelopment and production of multicored virions (21 ), suggesting that lack of palmityl groups obstruct bending of the membrane and/or vesicle fission. Another potential mode of action of 6K is related to its ability to increase membrane permeability for ions (22) . Indeed, wild-type virus growing in cells which are in medium of low ionic strength mimic the 6K deletion mutant phenotype. In such cases, NCs accumulate underneath the membrane; this block in virus release can be rapidly reversed by change to isotonic medium(4). Thus, 6K may function to keep the cytosolic and medium ion concentrations in balance, thereby allowing greater flexibility for the membrane to pinch off virus particles.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 602, "end": 606, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 932, "end": 936, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3375, "end": 3378, "text": "(20", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4070, "end": 4074, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1201, "end": 1207, "text": "Fig 2)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "The alphaviruses"}, {"text": "The negative strand rhabdo-, paramyxo-and orthomyxo- viruses appear to utilize similar budding strategies.

One possible explanation for these apparently conflicting results could be the formation of membrane patches induced by G (and M) rather than protein protein interactions. VSV virions are known to harbor a different lipid composition from its host membrane. G-and M-induced patching results in formation of microdomains which, compared to normal PM distribution, have a high phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, cholesterol and sphingomyelin content and are low in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine content (35) . The G and M proteins alter the lateral distribution of these lipids, suggesting that enrichment is part of the budding process. While expression of either M or G separately results in formation of lipid patches, co-expression of both proteins has a synergistic effect leading to greater condensation of the patch (35) . M exists in both a phosphorylated and unphosphorylated form but, when it is locked into the phosphorylated state (by reducing Ca2+-levels), normal patch formation is abolished and M becomes dispersed in the membrane (36) .
