Virus particles were isolated from the supernatant, purified by gradient centrifugation and sedimentation steps, and the radiolabelled viral proteins were analysed by SDS gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography ( Figure 1A ). In vivo labelling with [ 35 S]methionine marked all viral structural proteins ( Figure 1A , lane 1), whereas only the glycoprotein was radiolabelled when D-[6-3 H]glucosamine was used ( Figure 1, lane 2) . Starting from tissue culture supernatant of -2.5 x 10 8 infected cells, metabolically labelled with 2 mCi D-[6-3 H]glucosamine, viral glycoprotein comprising 2 x 10 6 c.p.m. was obtained. For determination of the radioactive sugar constituents, aliquots were hydrolysed and the monosaccharides released were identified by co-chromatography with monosaccharide standards in high-pH anion-exchange (HPAE)-HPLC. The results demonstrated that the [ 3 H]glucosamine-labelled viral glycoprotein contained radiolabelled N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine and galactose in a ratio of -9.8:1.35:1, indicating that small amounts of [6-3 H]glucosamine have been metabolized (Kiley et al., 1988) . Owing to the experimental conditions, the viral polypeptide VP24 is not visible. (B) Reactivity of sialic aad-specific MAA agglutinin to filovirus glycoproteins.

In order to analyse for the presence of sialic acid substituents, the same assay was performed using Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA) and Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA). MAA recognizes sialic acid linked (a2-3) to galactose in N-and 0-glycans, whereas SNA recognizes sialic acid linked (a2-6) to galactose. For comparison, the respective glycoproteins of two related filoviruses (Ebola and Reston virus), propagated in the same cell line, were also tested. In contrast to SNA, which did not react with any of the three glycoproteins (data not shown), MAA bound to Ebola and Reston virus, but not to Marburg virus glycoprotein ( Figure IB) . Binding of the lectin was abolished after treatment of the glycoproteins with sialidase, demonstrating the carbohydrate-specific reaction of MAA. Thus, Ebola and Reston virus glycoproteins obviously comprise (a2-3)-linked sialic acid, whereas Marburg virus glycoprotein seems to lack sialic acid substituents.",

The minor glycan fraction Fl was not analysed further, whereas fraction F2 glycans were reduced and subjected to anionexchange HPLC. The result revealed that the vast majority of radioactivity (94.2%) eluted at the position of neutral sugar chains ( Figure 3A ). Treatment of the trace amounts of charged material with sialidase from Vibrio cholerae did not change the elution position of these compounds, excluding the presence of sialylated oligosaccharides.

Thus, it can be concluded that fraction H2 contained the two glycans depicted in Table HI. Fraction H3 (3.7 mol%) contained solely Man 8 GlcNAcOH species.

For exoglycosidase studies, the two constituents were separated prior to digestion with /3-galactosidase. Analysis of the reaction products revealed the release of two and three galactose residues, respectively. Subsequent treatment with /3-N-acetylhexosaminidase using standard amounts of enzyme (see Materials and methods) resulted in the removal of zero or one N-acetylglucosamine residue. Only small amounts of the fragment eluting at 14.1 glucose units could be converted to a product co-eluting at 8.2 glucose units with authentic standard Man 3 GlcNAc(Fuc)GlcNAcOH (cf . Table II) . Using a 10-fold higher concentration of the enzyme, however, both components yielded the fucosylated core fragment eluting at 8.2 glucose units. In agreement with data reported by Yamashita et al. (1983a) it may, therefore, be assumed that the majority of fraction F21 glycans carry a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residue (GlcNAc-9) at Man-3. This assumption is corroborated by methylation data revealing the presence of terminal N-acetylglucosamine and 3,4,6-trisubstituted mannose in addition to terminal fucose, terminal galactose, 2-substituted as well as traces of 2,4-and 3,6-disubstituted mannose, 4-substituted N-acetylglucosamine and 4,6-disubstituted N-acetylglucosaminitol residues (see Table I ). Taken together, the data obtained indicate the presence of fucosylated biantennary species carrying a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residue (major component), as well as triantennary glycans (minor components), about half of which are similarly substituted by GlcNAc-9. Obviously, the latter species represented a contamination by F22 glycans (see below).",

Since F22 species represented a major glycan fraction of Marburg virus glycoprotein, these oligosaccharides could be further studied by LSIMS. As shown in Figure 6A -C, the analysis revealed a quasi-molecular ion ([M+H] + ) at m/z 2932 consistent with a sugar composition of Hex^HexNAc5dHexHex-NAcOH where Hex is hexose, HexNAc is A/-acetylhexosamine, HexNAcOH is jV-acetylhexosaminitol and dHex is deoxyhexose. In addition, characteristic fragment ions were observed at m/z 228 (HexNAc + minus methanol), 260 (HexNAc + ), 432 (HexHexNAc + minus methanol), 464 (HexHexNAc + ) and 450/2465 (fission of the chitobiose unit). LSIMS further revealed a significant amount of undermethylated products, which are commonly observed when glycans with bisecting JV-acetylglucosamine residues are subjected to permethylation (R.Geyer, unpublished observation). Methylation analysis revealed the presence of terminal fucose, terminal galactose, 2-substituted, 2,4-disubstituted and 3,4,6-trisubstituted mannose, terminal and 4-substituted A^-acetylglucosamine and 4,6-disubstituted /V-acetylglucosaminitol. Thus, fraction F22 species can be assumed to comprise the triantennary structure proposed in Table HI. Fraction F23 glycans (2.3 mol%) were identified as fucosylated tetraantennary species. Sequential digestion with /3-galactosidase and jS-A^-acetylhexosaminidase resulted in the liberation of four galactose and four N-acetylglucosamine residues, respectively. As shown below, the resulting fragment eluting at 8.2 glucose units again represented the fucosylated pentasaccharide core structure. Methylation analysis revealed the presence of 2,4-, 2,6-and 3,6-disubstituted mannose residues, and the absence of 3,4,6-trisubstituted mannose and terminal N-acetylglucosamine, demonstrating that this fraction represented tetraantennary glycans without bisecting N-acetylglucosamine.",

Furthermore, in that study the reaction of peanut agglutinin with this glycoprotein was not extinguished by treatment with 0-glycosidase. Similar results were now obtained in the case of tryptic peptides. Only about half the amount of disaccharide present could be released by repeated enzyme treatment, whereas the remaining half had to be liberated by reductive |3-elimination.

The virus was propagated in E6 cells, a cloned line of Vero cells (ATCC CRL 1586), as follows. E6 cells were infected with Marburg virus, strain Musoke, at a multiplicity of infection of 10~2 plaque-forming units/cell. Following an adsorption period of 30 min at 37\u00b0C, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's medium containing 2% fetal calf serum. In vivo radioactive labelling of viral proteins was performed 5 days post-infection. The maintenance medium was removed and the cell monolayers were washed twice with glucose-deficient Dulbecco's medium containing 1.8 g fructose/1 (for labelling with [ 3 H]glucosamine) or methionine-deficient medium (for labelling with [\"SJmethionine). Cells were incubated in deficiency medium for 2 h. The incubation was continued for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C in the specific nutrient-deficient Dulbecco's medium to which radioactive nutrients were added as follows: 20 jiCi/ml of D-[6-3 H]glucosamine or 20 fiCi/ml of [\"Slmethionine (Amersham Buchler, Braunschweig, FRG). Isolation and purification of the virus were as described previously (Feldmann etai., 1991; MQhlberger etai., 1992) . Briefly, culture fluid was clarified by centrifijgation at 6000 g (Minifuge RF, Heraeus, FRG) for 15 min at 4\u00b0C and virus particles were isolated by centrifugation in a SW28 rotor through a 20% sucrose cushion in TNE buffer (0.01 M Tris HC1, pH 7.4; 0.15 M NaCl; 2 mM EDTA) at 113 000# for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in TNE buffer and the virus particles were purified by gradient centrifugation in a SW28 rotor using a gradient of 0-40% (w/v) potassium tartrate, 30-0% glycerol in TNE buffer at 160 000 g for 16 h at 4\u00b0C. The virus band was isolated, diluted 1 in TNE buffer, pelleted by centrifugation in a SW41 rotor at 210 000 g for 30 min at 4\"C and resuspended in TNE buffer. The virus was disintegrated by adding SDS up to a final concentration of 1%. For carbohydrate structure analysis the glycoprotein, metabolically labelled with [6-3 H]glucosamine, was precipitated with acetone in order to remove salts and detergents, and redissolved in buffer for proteolytic digestion.",

Within each mass range, 5 {m/z 160-1000) or 9 (m/z 2000-^tOOO) scans were accumulated. Spectra of methylated O4 glycans were recorded at constant magnetic field solely within the mass range of m/z 920-990 (10 s/scan) using the array detector of the instrument. In this case, 20 scans were accumulated. In all experiments, data were acquired with a DEC 2100 data system and 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol (Aldnch, Steinheim, FRG) was used as matrix.",
