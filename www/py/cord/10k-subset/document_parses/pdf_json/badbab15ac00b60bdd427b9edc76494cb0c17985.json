Methods: Between March 1997 and November 2001, 277 consecutive minimally invasive procedures were performed for various nontrauma surgical emergencies. The indications for operation were nonspecific abdominal pain in 129 cases (46%), peritonitis in 64 cases (23%), small bowel obstruction in 52 cases (19%), complications after previous surgery or invasive procedures in 24 cases (9%), and sepsis of unknown origin in 8 cases (3%). Results: Laparoscopy obtained a correct diagnosis in 98.6% of the cases. In 207 patients (75%), the procedure was completed laparoscopically. An additional 35 patients (12.5%) required a target incision. The remaining 35 patients (12.5%) underwent formal laparotomy. The morbidity rate was 5.8%.
