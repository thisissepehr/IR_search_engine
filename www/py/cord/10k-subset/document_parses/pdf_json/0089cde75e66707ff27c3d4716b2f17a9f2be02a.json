These new heptad-repeats differ from those previously reported in other viruses because of the presence of all the hydrophobic amino acids in positions a or d, and because they are not predicted to form coiled coils by current methods and thus they have not been detected previously in any rhabdoviruses. The two or three heptad-repeat regions were the only parts of the glycoprotein with at least three successive heptad-repeats in all the rhabdoviral sequences studied and had low sequence variability among the members of each of the rhabdoviral genus but show no sequence similarity among the different genus. All these newly detected heptad repeats were in the vicinity of some of the higher hydrophobic regions in each of the rhabdovirus genera studied and were found mostly, but not always, outside the extra amino acid sequences that occur in the longer insect or plant rhabdovirus glycoprotein G. The correspondence of position and structure of these heptad-repeats among all the rhabdoviruses suggests its participation in common function(s), most probably related to viral fusion with cellular membranes.",

The presence of these repeats has been described in sequences of glycoproteins from many enveloped viruses, such as paramyxovirus, retrovirus, coronavirus, and influenza (2) , and is related to regions of high hydrophobicity or to viral fusion (3, 4) . Even though heptad-repeats with a propensity to form coiled coils had not been found previously in any rhabdoviruses (5), we searched for possible heptad-repeats in glycopro-tein G sequences of rhabdoviruses after finding that a phospholipid binding region of the viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHSV) rhabdovirus, a rhabdovirus affecting salmonid fish, had a heptad-repeat structure that included more hydrophobic aa than those defined earlier by Lupas [6] .",

The newly defined hydrophobic heptad-repeat sequences were searched with the program PSEARCH. Amino acids with -AG values >-0.4 kcal/mol for transfer of the aa side chain from water to ethanol were used as hydrophobic aa (single-letter code aa, W, F, Y, I, L, L, V, M, A, H, T) (14) . The subsequence used to search was (hydrophobic aa) XX (hydrophobic aa) XXX, repeated two times (with X indicating any aa). Then the positions at which more than two heptad-repeats were found successively arranged in the sequence of the glycoprotein G were selected (Table 2).

            "text": "The total number of aa in glycoprotein G varied from 507 to 526 aa for most of the rhabdoviruses, except for BEFV and SYNV, which had 623 and 628 aa, respectively (Table 1) . At least two regions in which hydrophobic aa were found in the a-d positions of heptads successively arranged (repeated) three or more times were located in all the rhabdoviral glycoprotein G sequences selected by computer search (Fig. 1) . No attention was paid to the aa compositions of the rest of the positions (b, c, e, f, or g) within the heptads, contrary to the prediction method by using the program COIL (1), which associates a probability with each aa in every heptad position (being the aa in a-d, for example, mainly = F, Y, I, L, V, M, and A, because those aa were the ones with the highest probability of being found in known coiled coils in protein structures). Therefore, the occurrence of hydrophobic a-d heptad-repeats of the kind defined in this work (aa in the a-d positions of the heptad-repeats = F, Y, I, L, V, M, A, + W, H, T, aa in the single-letter code) is not by itself an indicator of a coiled-coil structure. We thought to include aa W, H, and T as new candidates for the a or d positions because of the appearance of these aa in the a or d positions of the heptads in a phospholipid binding domain in VHSV (6) . Prior reported analysis of the VSV glycoprotein G sequence using the method of Lupas, while looking for the presence of at least four successive hep-Heptad Repeats in Rhabdoviruses 109 tad repeats (with the shortest peptides still exhibiting a stable coiled-coil structure in solution) failed to identify any predicted coiled-coil domains (1,2,5). Even on shortening the length of the aa window to three heptad-repeats in the program COIL, there were no coiled-coil regions predicted with a high enough probability in any of the rhabdoviral sequences shown in Table l . The two regions in at least three successive heptads found in most of the rhabdoviral sequences studied were situated around aa 100-150 (amino terminal) and around aa 350 (carboxy terminal). In contrast, the location of the heptadrepeats in the proteins of 20 envelope viruses reported previously was found in only one region situated either around aa 150 (near the aminoterminal aa) or around aa 400-500 (near the carboxy-terminal aa), but not in both positions simultaneously for each individual viral protein (I). VHSV and Sigma rhabdoviruses showed still another carboxy-terminal heptad-repeat region situated between aa 377-400 and 416-443, respectively (Fig. 1) . The carboxy-terminal heptadrepeats of rabies and vesiculoviruses, and the second carboxy-terminal heptad-repeat of VHSV and Sigma rhabdoviruses, contained one of the putative glycosylation positions. All of the heptad-repeats lay outside and around an internal core of glycoprotein G where seven cysteines (at around aa 170-300) were highly conserved (maximal alignment with a minority of gaps) in all the rhabdoviruses (Fig. I) .",

The search procedure allows any of the I0 hydrophobic aa (14) in each specified position a or d, and might detect chance runs of aa unrelated to coiled-coil structures, particularly if these include a genuine alpha helix. The presence of numerous helix-breaking proline residues scattered through the newly found heptadrepeats (Table 2 ) is a major factor arguing against the existence of these structures as alpha helixes. Several lines of indirect evidence suggest that the new heptad-repeats situated in the aminoterminal region of glycoprotein G or in the regions situated around them could somehow be related to rhabdoviral membrane fusion with host membranes, neutralization, and/or phospholipid binding. For instance, the presence of a fusion-defective mutant of VSV in aa 117 first indicated that the adjacent region (aa 118-136) could be involved in the membrane fusion activity of VSV glycoprotein G. Site-directed mutagenesis finally identified the sequence of aa 123-137 of VSV glycoprotein G as a putative fusogenic peptide involved in low-pH-induced membrane fusion (5, 17) . These VSV fusiondefective mutants map immediately before the amino-terminal new heptad-repeat (aa 134-161 for most VSV studied) of VSV (Table 2) Table 1 were obtained with the program SOAP from PCGene (Intelligenetics). The profiles from the different isolates or serotypes from VHSV, rabies, VSV-NJ, and VSV-Indiana were superimposed and the figures obtained are shown. The vertical arrows indicate the position of the highest hydrophobic peaks, whereas horizontal bars show the position of the heptad-repeats. The y axis shows the hydrophobic scales, and the X axis shows the amino-terminaL position of the amino acids of rhabdovirus glycoprotein G. and 409-419, only the positions 300-360 also maps nearby another of the new heptad-repeatrich region aa 332-356 in VSV-NJ or aa 328-369 in VSV-Ind. Analogous to influenza hemagglutinin, in which pH-dependent coiled coiling of heptad-repeats exposes the upstream fusion peptide (4) and because fusion of rhabdoviruses also has a low-pH dependence, causing exposure of unidentified hydrophobic aa region(s) (7, 8, 12) , the new rhabdovirus heptad-repeats identified in this work could also be related to rhabdoviral fusion. On the other hand, some rabies monoclonal antibody-resistant (MAR) mutants have been mapped in aa 330-338 and aa 342-343, both inside the aa 330-360 new rabies heptad-repeats (10, (18) (19) (20) .",

That work extended the wellknown observation of phospholipid interactions of mammalian rhabdoviruses (VSV and rabies) to fish rhabdoviruses. Study of the 15-mer phospholipid-binding peptide sequence (p106, aa 99-113) identified by pepscan showed that p106 was at the carboxy-terminal part of an a-d hydrophobic new heptad repeat with a predicted cx-helix structure (1,2,4) and led to the design of a synthetic peptide (p2) that, by containing P106 and the heptad repeat, increased the specific activity of phospholipids binding about 10-fold (6) . The sequence of p2 in VHSV 07.71 (22) was totally conserved in the sequence of glycoprotein G of the other VHSV sequence reported to date (23) ( Table 2 ). P2 (aa 82-109) was inside a region of 5 a-d hydrophobic new heptad repeats (aa 68-102). Whether or not this highly conserved domain and/or its nearby regions may be related to membrane fusion (2) induced by glycoprotein G of VHSV is not known at present. However, there is a similar pH dependence of VHSV in phospholipid (6) binding and membrane fusion (1i).",
