Patients and methods From January 2010 to January 2014, a total of 350 patients, who required the use of large amounts of hormones, were enrolled into the study. These patients were followed up every three months after starting the hormone therapy. A total of 62 cases were screened, among which nine cases were asymptomatic. Furthermore, 38 patients were diagnosed as stage I and were given low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and vasodilator drugs. Moreover, 22 cases were diagnosed as stage IIa/b and underwent core decompression. In addition, two cases were diagnosed as stage IIc and underwent pedicled bone transplantation. During the follow-up period, ARCO staging was used for radiological evaluation, the HHS score was applied to evaluate for clinical efficacy, and SPSS 22.0 statistical software was used for the data analysis. Results A total of 60 patients were followed up for 24 months. Among these patients, 38 patients were diagnosed with ARCO stage I and underwent systematic therapy. No progress was found in 29 cases (76.3%). Furthermore, three cases progressed to stage IIb (7.8%), four cases progressed to stage IIc (10.5%), two cases progressed to stage III and IV, respectively (2.6%), and 16 cases (80%) did not progress after core decompression. In the 16 cases at stage IIa and four cases at stage IIb, and four cases (20%) progressed in stage III. The HHS score of stage I was 80.42 \u00b1 3.25 before follow-up, while the HHS score was 86.46 \u00b1 8.54 after follow-up, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the HHS score of patients with stage IIa/b was 70.38 \u00b1 4.62 before follow-up, while the HHS score was 80.28 \u00b1 6.72 after follow-up, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01). Conclusion MRI remains as the most effective method for the non-invasive diagnosis of osteonecrosis, at present. Enhanced MRI may be able to detect early osteonecrosis, but further research is needed. Drug treatment and core decompression can achieve satisfactory results at the early stage.",

The former is mainly caused by hip trauma (femoral neck fracture, joint dislocation, etc.), while the latter is mainly caused by the application of corticosteroids, heavy drinking, and decompression sickness. Hormonal osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH) refers to the pathological process that results from the death of femoral head active ingredients (osteocytes, myeloid haematopoietic cells, and adipocytes) caused by high doses of hormones. SONFH accounts for the top incidences of non-invasive necrosis [1] .",

Once the collapse of the femoral head appears (subchondral fracture and positive crescent sign), the course of the disease is difficult to reverse. Within a few years, the majority of patients will develop severe osteoarthritis and will require artificial joint replacement. SONFH mainly occurs in middle-aged and young individuals [3] , but the long-term effect of artificial joint replacement remains difficult to predict. Therefore, it is particularly important to search for effective treatments for keeping one's own joints. The premise of good treatment is to obtain early diagnosis and intervention. With the gradual deepening of the understanding of the disease, in recent years, our hospital targeted to strengthen the early diagnosis and intervention of SONFH.",

            "text": "DSA has been used in clinical practice for many years. It can clearly display the femoral head feeding artery, which can provide guidance in the clinical treatment. The main feeding artery supplying the femoral head is the supporting artery on the femoral neck that originates from the medial femoral artery (or from the inferior gluteal artery). The DSA technique can clearly reveal the blood supply of the circumflex femoral head artery and the artery of the supporting artery after ONFH [13] . The IIa/b stage is the venous stasis period. DSA revealed the prolonged intravenous phase and intravenous perfusion, and that no stenosis or occlusion was present in the input artery. The stasis can lead to increased intravenous pressure, while for the pathological changes in the femoral head in osteonecrosis, increased intraosseous pressure is one of the main causes of osteonecrosis [14] . Ficat et al. [15] measured a large amount of intramedullary pressure and found that the upper limit of normal femoral head pressure was 4.01 kPa, which was considered as an early indication of ONFH. Core decompression surgery is a simple, less traumatic surgery. Its efficiency is approximately 60-65% for five to ten years. Even if the long-term poor effect does not increase the difficulty of joint replacement, most scholars consider that core decompression has a certain effect in relieving hip pain, which can delay total hip arthroplasty. The effective rate in the present treatment at ARCO stage IIa/b was 80%, with core decompression, which was higher than that in the literature. This was probably because the investigators strictly complied with the surgical indications. In addition, the short follow-up time and small number of cases may be one of the reasons, and the IIc stage is the artery ischemia period. The DSA revealed the prolonged average perfusion time, arterial slender, and the prolonged microvascular phase and venous phase, with no significant delayed drainage. It was found that the core decompression effect of this period was poor. Hence, surgery of the pedicle bone graft was chosen, which has advantages with the independent arteriovenous system, without microscopic anastomosis and blood vessels around the lesion, allowing it to establish contact with the reconstruction in blood in the femoral head. Due to good disease education and timely treatment, most of the patients did not develop to the IIc period. The follow-up result was good for two cases of bone graft. However, due to the sample size, the present study did not conduct an analysis.",

Early diagnosis and treatment can reduce the suffering of patients and reduce social costs. Chinese medicine treatment for osteonecrosis has been continuously performed for many years. The investigators are presently exploring the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of osteonecrosis, with the expectation that treating at the early stages of osteonecrosis can reverse the disease. Simple core decompression surgical intervention for stage IIa/b is important for delaying the progression of the disease. Pedicled bone transplantation for IIc and IIIa is a worthwhile approach [16] , while IV may have to be performed, in order to improve the quality of life for joint replacement surgery.",
