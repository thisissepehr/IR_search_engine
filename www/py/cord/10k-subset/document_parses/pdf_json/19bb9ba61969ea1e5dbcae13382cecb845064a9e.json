Setting: Two intensive care units, university hospital and county hospital, respectively. Patients: Twenty-two critically ill patients in the intensive care unit. Interventions: Albumin synthesis was measured twice in each patient, with a 5-day interval. The patients in the control group (n = 11) received standard intensive care unit (ICU) treatment between measurements, whereas those in the GH group (n = 11) also received 0.3 U/kg daily of human recombinant GH. Measurements and results: Albumin synthesis was measured by labeling with l-[ 2 H 5 ]phenylalanine. In the control group, the fractional synthe-sis rate (FSR) of albumin was 16.3 4.1 %/day (mean and SD) in the first measurement and 15.7 4.2 %/day 5 days later (NS), whereas in the GH group the corresponding values were 17.0 4.7 %/day and 16.7 5.5 %/day (NS). The calculated absolute synthesis rates of albumin, based on FSR and intravascular albumin mass, also showed no effect of GH. Conclusion: Albumin synthesis rates were consistently higher in the two groups of critically ill patients than previously reported values in healthy subjects. However, GH treatment for 5 days neither stimulated nor inhibited albumin synthesis rates in these critically ill patients.",

            "text": "Growth hormone (GH) has been shown to reduce net protein loss in critical illness, such as burns [12, 13] , and trauma and sepsis [14, 15] . Although GH preserves liver protein synthesis in conjunction with elective laparoscopic surgery [16] , and also stimulates albumin synthesis in the healthy human [17, 18] , GH given to severely traumatized subjects does not reprioritize liver protein synthesis from the acute phase response, as assessed by plasma protein concentrations [19] . As GH treatment has been suggested for the treatment of the critically ill to reduce the effects of catabolism, there is a need to characterize better its effects on human liver protein metabolism in this group of patients. Despite the stimulation of albumin synthesis in healthy subjects, in the critically ill it is possible that positive effects of GH on protein metabolism in the whole body and, in particular, in skeletal muscle, might result in negative effects on liver protein metabolism, e.g. by depriving the liver of substrates for its vital metabolic processes. It may be speculated that such a mechanism may have contributed to the result of a recent study, where GH treatment was shown to be associated with increased mortality and morbidity in critically ill patients [20] . The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of a 5-day GH treatment on albumin synthesis in one group of critically ill patients, and compare with the results from one group not receiving GH.",

The patients were admitted to the ICU following trauma, surgical complications and/or severe infections and had developed multiple organ failure during the course of the illness. The patients were randomized into two comparable groups regarding gender, age, weight, height and body mass index (BMI), and were scored according to acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) on admission to the ICU (Table 1 ) [21] . The patients in the two groups were investigated after similar lengths of stay in the ICU, and their outcomes in terms of survival were similar. Prior to each measurement of albumin synthesis, bilateral antecubital venous lines were inserted, one of which was used for blood sampling and the other for injection of l-[ 2 H 5 ]phenylalanine 45 mg/kg, 15 MPE in the first measurement and 30 MPE in the second, performed 5 days later. During the intervening period, 11 of the patients (GH group) received 0.3 U/kg each day of growth hormone as a subcutaneous injection. The patients in the control group received no GH treatment. During the treatment period, the patients received all other treatment as required by their medical condition, including mechanical ventilation, sedation, diuretics, and antibiotics. Thus, all patients were ventilator-dependent at the first sampling occasion, except for two patients in the control group and one patient in the GH group. When required, the patients were sedated with midazolam or propofol. All the patients received low molecular weight heparin as prophylaxis against thrombosis. All the patients received nutrition, aiming at a calorie supply of 20\u00b130 kcal/kg/day and a nitrogen supply of 0.1\u00b10.2 g/kg/ day. As much as possible of the nutrition was provided enterally, and the remainder parenterally. In the control group, one of the patients at the first sampling occasion, and four patients at the second, received more than 25 % of the nutritional supply enterally. In the GH group, none of the patients received any enteral nutrition at the first sampling occasion, but two patients did at the second (65 and 75 % of the total calorie supply, respectively). The parenteral nutrition, which was provided as continuous intravenous solutions, consisted of a mixture of Intralipid 200 mg/ml, Glukos 100\u00b1200 mg/ml and Vamin-Glukos (Pharmacia Upjohn, Stockholm, Sweden), providing non-protein calories in equal amounts. The enteral solution was provided for 10 h (if < 700 ml was provided per 24 h) or 20 h (if > 700 ml/24 h) (Prenutrison/Nutrison, Nutricia, Zoetermeer, Holland). At the time of measurement, the patients were all hemodynamically stable, and were investigated after the initial (fluid) resuscitation had been completed.",

We previously demonstrated that plasma phenylalanine enrichment closely approximates the enrichment within the liver in healthy humans when a flooding amount of l-[ 2 H 5 ]phenylalanine is given [16] . In our present study, albumin in plasma samples was extracted from 9 % trichloroacetic acid-precipitated protein fraction by differential solubility in absolute ethanol [24] . The purity of the albumin fraction was checked with matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry (Finnigan Laser mat 2000, Finnigan, Hemel Hempstead, England) showing that a single peak with molecular weight 67,450 kDa had been isolated. Also, in a previous study of albumin synthesis in critically ill patients, it was shown by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) that the separation of albumin by the ethanol technique used here provided pure and reproducible preparations [11] , suitable for gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Thereafter, the protein precipitate was suspended in 0.3 M NaOH and reprecipitated in 5 % PCA. Following washing with 2 % PCA, albumin was hydrolyzed in 6 M HCl for 24 h at 110 C. The HCl was removed by evaporation in vacuo, and the hydrolysate used for the measurement of isotopic enrichment. Samples of plasma for the determination of free phenylalanine enrichment were treated with 8 % sulfosalicylic acid to precipitate protein. The amino acid-containing supernatants were purified in cation exchange columns (Biorad AG, 50W-X8, (H + ) form, 100\u00b1200 mesh) and eluted from columns with 4 M NH 4 OH. The samples were then dried in vacuo.",

Furthermore, the mean value for albumin FSR of approximately 16 %/day found in both groups studied was consistently higher than in other investigations of albumin synthesis in healthy individuals, where mean values of approximately 6\u00b19 %/day have been found ( Fig. 1 ) [23, 25] . The present results are in accord with previous findings in critically ill patients [3, 11] , where increased albumin synthesis rates were found. It is notable that the albumin synthesis rates in these critically ill patients approach the rates found in nephrotic patients (mean value approximately 18 %/day), who also have very low plasma albumin concentrations [26] , suggesting that the elevation is an attempt to compensate for the low concentration. However, even though GH is capable of stimulating albumin synthesis and increasing the level of albumin mRNA in healthy individuals [17, 18] , provision of GH in pharmacological doses to these intensive care unit patients did not increase albumin FSR above the level observed in the control group (Fig. 1) . It is therefore a reasonable hypothesis that albumin synthesis in the critically ill patients is not stimulated by GH because it is already stimulated maximally, presumably by the low albumin concentration. However, the result from this study may also be looked upon from the other point of view, that GH provision does not entail negative effects on albumin synthesis in these patients, as a result of hepatic substrate depletion secondary to the retention of nitrogen in the periphery, found previously in the critically ill [14, 15] . Therefore, it seems less plausible that such a mechanism may have contributed to the increased mortality observed in critically ill patients in association with GH treatment [20] , at least where albumin synthesis is concerned. Despite the findings that GH reduces net protein loss in the critically ill [14, 15] , there are other studies in which GH treatment has not been shown to reduce protein catabolism, and might even be associated with increased mortality [20, 27, 28] . This discrepancy may be attributed to the difficulties encountered in standardizing these patients. For example, it is crucial to characterize the patients who are investigated, i.e. the degree of acute illness, for which the APACHE II score is a valuable tool, even though it may not be used as a prognostic marker for the individual patient. Also, the time factor seems to be of importance, i.e. when in relation to the catabolic insult the study is performed [27] . Furthermore, there have been reports that indicate an even more pronounced GH resistance in hypercatabolic patients in the ICU than after elective surgery [29] , indicating that the dose of GH might be important.",

The isotopically labeled amino acid is provided either for several hours as a constant infusion or as a short-term injection (the so-called \u00aaflooding\u00ba technique), and the duration of the periods of measurement differ correspondingly. Even though there has been considerable debate over the years as to which of the two methods is the more appropriate for measuring protein synthesis [30, 31] , it may be said that the specific conditions of a given experiment should decide which method should be employed [32] . Thus, even though the constant infusion method is considered more appropriate for measurements of whole body protein turnover and synthesis of proteins with slow turnover rates during 841 steady state conditions, the difficulty in obtaining a correct assessment of the true precursor pool for protein synthesis (i.e. aminoacyl-tRNA), using surrogate measures of plasma and tissue fluid enrichments, remains a problem [32, 33] . On the other hand, an important question concerning the flooding technique is whether the large dose of tracee amino acid alters protein synthesis.",

Still, the results presented by Smith et al. raise concern over the use of the flooding technique, even though this concern seems less applicable when short periods of measurement are used [32] .

Although the concentration of albumin was low in the present study, it did not fall further during the 5day period of study, implying that both synthesis and degradation of albumin were elevated. This study, there-fore, confirms the results from previous investigations, that albumin synthesis is increased in critical illness [3, 10, 11] , not the opposite, as commonly believed (Fig. 1) . The reason for the low plasma albumin concentration in critically ill patients, which develops very early in the illness, is more likely to be due to an increase in vascular permeability. This has the potential to change plasma albumin very rapidly and to a greater extent than changes in synthesis and degradation, occurring at a rate of up to several times higher than synthesis (and presumably degradation) in critical illness [38, 39] .",

Possibly more importantly, no inhibition of albumin synthesis was observed, which may indicate that GH treatment was not associated with negative effects on liver protein metabolism in critical illness.",
