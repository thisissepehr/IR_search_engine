It is essential that clinicians understand these processes and the impact on nutrient metabolism [4] . In 1942, Cuthbertson described two distinct metabolic phases during acute illness-the 'ebb' or early shock phase, followed by the 'flow' or catabolic phase [6] . In brief, the 'ebb' phase is characterised by haemodynamic instability and hormonal changes (including insulin resistance) in order to prioritise the delivery of energy substrates to vital tissues [6, 7] . This survival mechanism results in endogenous glucose production as well as lower energy expenditure compared to pre-injury [4] . The 'flow' phase involves the breakdown of tissue (including lean muscle tissue) in order to provide substrates to cover the immediate needs for the 'fight or flight' response and to reduce the risk of bleeding and infection [4] . More recently, a third, anabolic recovery phase has been described [3] . It is during this recovery phase when resynthesis of lost tissue can take place and the body may be more metabolically able to process delivered nutrients [3, 4] . Currently, there is no known clinical marker to identify when an individual shifts from one phase of critical illness to another. For the purposes of this review which aims to provide practical recommendations, we have adapted the terminology from the 2019 European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN) critical care guideline to describe the different stages of critical illness: ICU day 1-2 (acute early phase), ICU day 3-7 (acute late phase), and after ICU day 7 (recovery phase) [2] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 282, "end": 285, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 286, "end": 288, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 388, "end": 391, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 550, "end": 553, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 753, "end": 756, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 757, "end": 759, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 886, "end": 889, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1117, "end": 1120, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1190, "end": 1193, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1351, "end": 1354, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1357, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1858, "end": 1861, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "While it is considered that nutrition may be more physiologically available and hence more important in the later phase of illness, due to the average intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), the majority of nutrition trials have provided nutrition interventions in the acute phases of illness (regardless of the intended trial intervention period). Traditionally, it was thought that aggressive nutrition in the early stages of critical illness may improve clinical outcomes. However, evidence from recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs) does not support this, finding no benefit or harm with early nutrition delivery [8] [9] [10] [11] . An explanation for this may be because a substantial amount of energy was provided in a period of critical illness where energy expenditure is decreased and endogenous production is enhanced [4] . Specifically, harm was observed in The Early Parenteral Nutrition Completing Enteral Nutrition in Adult Critically ill Patients (EPaNIC) trial, the largest nutrition trial in critical illness [10] . In a study of 4640 mixed ICU patients (n = 2818 (61%) cardiac surgery patients) who were eligible to receive EN, late initiation of PN (started on day 8 of the ICU stay) led to an increase in the proportion of patients discharged alive and earlier from ICU and hospital (hazard ratio (HR) 1.06; 95% CI 1.00-1.13; p = 0.04 for both) when compared to PN commenced within 48 h of ICU admission [10] . Late initiation PN also led to a reduction in infectious complications (22.8% vs 26.2%, p = 0.008), cholestasis, duration of mechanical ventilation (MV), duration of renal replacement therapy, and health care costs [10] . Most recently, results from the largest enteral nutrition (EN) trial, The Augmented versus Routine approach to Giving Energy Trial (TARGET), support the theory that augmented energy delivery in the early phase of illness does not improve clinical outcomes compared to standard care [8] . This pragmatic prospective RCT of 3957 patients assessed 90-day mortality with augmented energy delivery (based on a predictive estimate of 1 ml/kg ideal body weight for height per day), compared to routine care [8] . Energy delivery was 50% higher in the intervention group (~30 kcal/kg ideal body weight/day) over the median 6-day nutrition delivery period (and approximated clinician estimated energy aims) but did not impact mortality or any secondary clinical outcomes [8] . However, it must be noted this study included a very 'general' (or unselected) population and that overfeeding may have occurred. Further post hoc work may increase the understanding and clinical implications of these results. Lack of benefit has also been observed with hypocaloric (low energy and adequate protein) and trophic (low energy and protein) feeding strategies compared to standard care, also provided early in critical illness and for short periods [9, 12] . The results of these trials support the hypothesis that for mixed ICU patients, nutrition interventions in the acute early and acute late phase of critical illness may not impact clinical outcomes and may cause harm in some groups. Therefore, less than 100% of energy expenditure should be targeted in this period due to endogenous glucose production. It remains unknown whether nutrition interventions continued for longer, impact functional recovery and quality of life [3] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 630, "end": 633, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 634, "end": 637, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 638, "end": 642, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 643, "end": 647, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 841, "end": 844, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1039, "end": 1043, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1437, "end": 1441, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1659, "end": 1663, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1948, "end": 1951, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2166, "end": 2169, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2428, "end": 2431, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2896, "end": 2899, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2900, "end": 2903, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3378, "end": 3381, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "There are currently four international clinical practice guidelines available to inform the nutrition management of critically ill patients [1, 2, 13, 14] .

Resting energy expenditure (REE) can be estimated via VCO 2 (carbon dioxide production) from the ventilator and the rewritten Weir formula (REE = VCO 2 \u00d7 8.19) or using VO 2 (oxygen consumption) from a pulmonary artery catheter via the Fick method [19] [20] [21] [22] . A recent study in 84 critically ill patients reported a higher level of agreement between energy requirements estimated by the VCO 2 method and measured REE compared to other predictive equations [20] . There are methodological limitations to note with this method: an assumed normal respiratory quotient (RQ) of 0.85 is used, which is the RQ of most nutritional products (with RQ = VCO 2 /VO 2 , normally ranging between Supplemental PN-when all nutritional requirements are unable to be met by EN (i.e. due to intolerance, fasting) c Canadian Clinical Practice Guidelines, level of bias for included RCTs: Level 1 = randomisation was concealed, outcome adjudication was blinded, and an intention to treat analysis was performed.

Despite the guideline recommendations, only three single-centre RCTs have investigated the impact of delivering energy according to a measured energy expenditure (via indirect calorimetry) compared to energy delivery using a 25-kcal/kg/day estimate (standard care) on clinical outcomes. The first, published in 2011, included 130 patients and observed a trend towards reduced hospital mortality (primary outcome) in the intervention group using intention to treat (ITT) analysis (n = 21/65, 32.3%, vs 31/65, 47.7%, p = 0.058) [25] .

However, in a post hoc analysis, a longer median (interquartile range) ICU LOS was observed in the intervention group (8 (5-25) vs 7 (4-12) days, p = 0.03) [11] . Lastly, in a pilot study (n = 40), no statistically significant differences were observed between groups in the primary outcome of change in bioelectrical impedance phase angle (related to nutritional status and prognosis) from baseline to ICU discharge [26] .

For this reason, RCT evidence attempting to investigate if patients who may be malnourished respond differently to nutrition is limited to subgroup analysis in patients with differing BMI categories or nutrition risk scores [10, 12, 67] . To date, no benefit has been observed when more or less nutrition is provided in these subgroups although the numbers included are often small. Further, BMI is a poor surrogate measure for malnutrition, and commonly used nutrition risk scores have not been well validated, which limits any conclusions on how nutrition therapy may affect outcomes in this vulnerable subgroup [2] .

Where possible, clinicians should use local hospital guidelines or the recent GLIM criteria, combined with clinical judgement to diagnose malnutrition.
