In mammalian cells, the investigation of bacterial infections has been an important source of knowledge for the mechanistic principles underlying selective types of autophagy (Fig. 1A) . Selective degradation of pathogens by autophagy, also defined as xe-nophagy, was initially described for the intracellular elimination of Group A Streptococcus [2] . Another extensively studied model for xenophagy is the infection of Salmonella. After escaping into the cytosol from phagosomes, Salmonella becomes rapidly ubiquitinated and is sequestered into autophagosomes. These observations have prompted several groups to investigate the proteins that are responsible to target (ubiquitinated) bacteria, but also other pathogens into autophagosomes. These so-called autophagy receptors, which include nuclear dot protein 52 kDa (NDP52), p62 and OPTINEURIN (OPTN), have been identified and characterized by various laboratories [3] [4] [5] . Although several autophagy receptors recognize the same bacterium, their function is not redundant but rather cooperative in restricting bacterial growth. The key feature of these autophagy receptors is that they can simultaneously bind ubiquitin and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). Thereby, they effectively mediate the sequestration of ubiquitinated bacteria into autophagosomes. These principles of xenophagy have also been shown to be valid for other selective types of autophagy, which permit the disposal of protein aggregates, mitochondria or mid body ring (Fig. 1A) [1]. A common factor that connects different selective forms of autophagy is the Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). TBK1 can phosphorylate multiple autophagy receptors (e.g. OPTN, p62, NDP52) and thereby enhances their binding to LC3.

Interestingly, GALECTIN3 also detects membranes of damaged lysosomes and acts as a signal for autophagy-mediated turnover of these organelles (Fig. 1A ) [9] .",

            "text": "The study of microbes, in particular of bacteria, has al-so been valuable to acquire knowledge about the mechanism that leads to the assembly of the ATG machinery during selective types of autophagy (Fig. 1A) . During bulk autophagy, the ATG machinery assembles by following a distinct sequential hierarchy to initiate the autophagosome formation [10] . Kageyama and colleagues have revealed that upon induction of the formation of autophagosomes that target invading Salmonella, the functional groups composing the ATG machinery act in parallel axes, rather than sequentially [11] . In particular, although LC3 recruit- ment and lipidation in close proximity of the bacteria requires the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16 complex, this localization is independent of ATG9 or phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) generation. Nonetheless, components of the LC3 conjugation system as well as ATG9 and FIP200, a subunit of the ULK kinase complex, are all required for suppression of Salmonella growth because they are all necessary for the autophagosome biogenesis. In line with these observations, Kageyama and colleagues also observed that ATG9 associates to the invading bacteria prior to LC3. This model has been strengthened by a recent study showing that the formation of an autophagosome in close proximity of Salmonella is also modulated by activated TBK1. TBK1 is recruited to the ubiquitinated bacteria by different redundant mechanisms. This event is required for the localization of WIPI2, a PI3P-binding ATG protein, to the nascent autophagosome but not for the recruitment of LC3 [12] . Similar findings were reported for the selective degradation of mitochondria where components of the ULK complex and ATG9 are recruited to the mitochondria earlier than LC3 and in a manner that does not require autophagy receptors [13] . These findings imply that the assembly mechanism of the ATG machinery (in particular LC3 recruitment) and the principles underlying autophagosome biogenesis initialization are different between selective and non-selective autophagy.",

It has recently been shown that the release of Mycobacterium from amoebas in a non-lytic fashion is mediated by a so-called ejectosome. Although the ATG machinery is not required for the generation of the ejectosome, it is crucial to maintain plasma membrane integrity during this Mycobacterium exit from host cells [14] . Autophagy-mediated secretion is not only important for bacteria release from host cells but also for the egression of specific viruses. Influenza virus is an example of a virus where optimal cell release depends on ATG proteins. Influenza M2 protein binds LC3 and thereby directs autophagosomes to the plasma membrane where they are required for the filamentous budding and the stability of the virions [15] . Another example is the release of picornaviral particles. In addition to employ a lytic mechanism, the virions gain access to the extracellular milieu through a non-lytic release that depends on the ATG machinery and autophagosomelike vesicles [16, 17] . Importantly, autophagy-mediated secretion has now been shown to be important for the extracellular export of endogenous factors such as cytokines, protein aggregates and organelles during developmental processes [18] .",

The most well-known of these unconventional functions is probably the LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) [20] . During LAP, the single membrane of phagosomes is modified to enhance lysosomal degradation of phagocytosed material, such as bacteria. This modification is characterized by the recruitment of LC3 through its covalent conjugation to the phosphatidylethanolamine present in the phagosomal membranes and it appears to require all ATG proteins except those that are part of the ULK kinase complex. LAP is triggered by infections by a variety of pathogens, including Burkholderia pseudomallei, Leishmania major and fungi, through the stimulation of pattern recognition receptors including specific Toll-like receptors [20, 21] . In addition to this role in innate immunity, LAP is also involved in processing and facilitating antigen loading onto major histocompatibility complex class II during infections contributing to adaptive immunity and plays a role in the clearance of dead cells by macrophages [22, 23] .",

MHV and EAV induce the formation double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) in host cells, which act as replicative platforms. DMVs were initially believed to be autophagosomes because of their double-membrane morphology. However, it has been shown that these structures are still formed in absence of ATG5 and ATG7 even if they are positive for LC3 [26] . A study from our laboratory [24] revealed that in agreement with these observations, nonlipidated LC3 localizes to DMVs and that virus replication is inhibited by LC3 depletion. Interestingly, we also showed that MHV-induced DMVs are derived from EDEMosomes, endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles required for the regulated removal of two factors involved in the ER quality control, i.e. EDEM1 and OS-9, which are also positive for non-lipidated LC3.",
