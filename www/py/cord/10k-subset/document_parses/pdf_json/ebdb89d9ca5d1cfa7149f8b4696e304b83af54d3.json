Identification of patients at risk for infection is based on each patient's type of oral microbial colonization and the presence of latent viral infections. Systemic and local resistance to infection will be decisive, and in many patients the risk can be estimated from the expected myelosuppressive effect of anticancer treatment. Diagnosis of infection is often based on clinical findings together with the results of microbiological investigations. Biopsies could be useful, but can seldom be obtained. Blood samples are mandatory for isolation of microorganisms involved in systemic infections in myelosuppressed patients. Prevention of infection requires both local and systemic measures. Elimination of the risk of a breach in the first line of defence is urgent, and the maintenance of mucosal integrity is important. Monitoring microbial colonization is common, as is the institution of antiviral prophylaxis in patients with increased anti-HSV IgG (ELISA 1 10 000). Antifungal prophylaxis, to avoid colonization and superinfection, should be instituted in patients with low neutrophil counts. Gastrointestinal prophylaxis with quinolones is also commonly used in these patient groups. Treatment of oral infections in cancer patients should include systemic antimicrobial agents in most cases. Special attention should be directed to oral infections in neutropenic (~0.5!l0 9 /l)",

            "text": "The oropharyngeal region comprises many ecologically different environments for the bacteria, and the oropharyngeal microflora is complex, consisting of more than 300 different bacterial species, 70% of which are anaerobes, streptococci and Gram-negative anaerobic rods. Staphylococci and, especially, anaerobic Gramnegative rods, such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas species are less frequent. Candida albicans is isolated in 10-80% of normal healthy individuals, but usually in low numbers. Disease or antibiotic-induced ecological changes can lead to colonization with nonendogenous microorganisms [13] . In healthy persons these colonizing microorganisms seldom cause problems, but in seriously diseased patients, such as those suffering from cancer, they may cause superinfection, local infections, such as stomatitis, or systemic infections, such as septicaemia. The patient's defence mechanisms may be impaired by cancer treatment or by the disease itself, leaving the patient susceptible to infection. In certain patients the deficiencies of the defence mechanisms are of a localized type, as seen in patients undergoing radiotherapy to the oral cavity and pharyngeal area. These patients generally suffer from problems related to an impaired function of the first line of defence. Thus, not only the break in the mucosal lining, but also the decreased amounts of saliva and secretory IgA make these patients more liable to bacterial and fungal localized infections. They generally have a normal function of the secondary line of defence, and the infection can consequently be limited to the oral cavity in most cases. On the other hand, in patients who have a significantly weakened second line of defence because of myelosuppression, localized infections may spread; translocation of microorganisms from the oral cavity into the circulation may ensue, with consequent septicaemia [3] .",

With physiological, pathological or ecological disturbances of the oral cavity and the gastrointestinal tract, changes in the microflora can be found. The most common cause of disturbances is the administration of antibiotics. The microorganisms in the oral cavity, for example, can be influenced by antibiotics because of the direct effect during intake of peroral formulas, and because of secretion of antibiotics from the mucosal lining and gingival crevices or of secretion of an antibiotic in the saliva. The influence of antibiotics on the normal microflora cannot be estimated from pharmacokinetic data and knowledge of antimicrobial susceptibility alone, but must be studied under clinical circumstances. A number of studies on the effects of various antimicrobial agents have shown that the risk of a new colonization of the oral cavity is related to the effect of the antibiotic on the anaerobic microflora. Thus, agents that induce marked suppression of anaerobic microorganisms promote colonization of the oral cavity by Gram-negative enteric microorganisms as well as by fungal species, mainly Candida spp. [12] . Agents that induce colonization are second-and third-generation cephalosporins, ampicillin in combination with beta lactamase inhibitors, clindamycin and erythromycin. Agents that have a less pronounced tendency to induce colonization are phenoxymethylpenicillin and metronidazole.",

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV) infections are rarely life threatening, but may cause severe oral ulcerations and significant breakdown in the first line of defence. In BMT patients with serological evidence of an earlier HSV infection, up to 80% are likely to have an HSV-reactivated infection if prophylaxis is not instituted [10] . If viral prophylaxis is instituted with acyclovir (for example), reactivation can be avoided in most cases. The risk of reactivation is highest in patients with an HSV IgG titre of 1 10,000 (ELISA) [6] . Prophylaxis can in many cases be limited to this highrisk group. Prevention of reactivation of HSV will also decrease the risk of a break in the first line of defence and may thus, also decrease the risk of bacterial translocation from the oral cavity and the subsequent risk of viridans streptococcal septicaemia [14] .",

In the group of patients that are severely myelosuppressed reactivation of HSV is a common finding and one of the most frequent reasons for disruption of the oral mucosa.

The risk of infection is depending on the number of neutrophilic leucocytes (PMN cells) in blood. If PMN cells are less than 0.5!10 9 /l the risk of infection is clearly increased and when the number is less than 0.1!10 9 /l the risk rises dramatically. In selected patient groups with pronounced myelosuppression, such as BMT patients, viridans streptococci from the oral cavity are the leading cause of bacteraemia [17] . In 500 allogeneic BMT patients at Huddinge University Hospital, 164 patients had at least one positive blood culture. In the vast majority of them Gram-positive organisms were recovered (89%), while Gram-negative organisms were only present in 4%. Gram-negative bacteraemia was more dangerous: 3 of 7 patients affected died as a direct consequence of this, while 8 of 164 died of bacteraemia caused by Gram-positive microorganisms. The most common bacterial species were viridans streptococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). The viridans streptococci have their normal habitat in the oral cavity, while CNS reside on the skin. Viridans streptococci enter the circulation through disruption of the oral mucosal membrane, while CNS usually enters along indwelling catheters penetrating the skin. In both these cases a break in the first line of defence is obviously a prerequisite for infection. A prolonged aplastic period increases the risk of infection. The use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF) shortens the aplastic period and may decrease the risk of septicaemia [17] .",

In many patients it is not possible to perform dental extractions or biopsies, for example, because of low numbers of platelets or PMN cells. Therapy is thus limited to antimicrobial treatment in many patients, which is based on clinical findings and microbiological analyses if present. Dental infections should be treated with intravenous penicillin or aminopenicillins. Combinations with metronidazole ensure an effect against penicillin-resistant anaerobes also. During recent years it has been ob-served that viridans streptococci can become highly resistant to penicillins. In bacteraemic neutropenic patients the rate of highly resistant streptococci (MIC 1 4 mg/l) increased from zero in 1987 to 17 episodes per 1000 admissions 5 years later [1] . Macrolides are generally unsuitable alternatives to penicillin. Vancomycin, ofloxacin and teicoplanin are generally active against penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci [5] .",

The diagnosis is made from the clinical findings together with results of microbiological investigations. In the treatment of localized infections in immunocompetent patients fluconazole is generally the drug of choice for therapy. In the myelosuppressed patient, in contrast, invasive oral fungal infections may cause dissemination of microorganisms, with subsequent systemic infection. The diagnosis of invasive fungal infections is difficult, since blood cultures and antigen and serological tests are usually negative or have a low specificity. In transplant recipients treated with cyclosporin, which has a synergistic nephrotoxic effect with amphotericin B [15] , even low doses of amphotericin B can induce acute toxic side effects. In these patients liposomal amphotericin B should be considered, since the toxicity is considerably lower [19] .",
