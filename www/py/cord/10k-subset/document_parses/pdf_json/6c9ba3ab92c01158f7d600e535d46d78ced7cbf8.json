The persistent or the regenerated vagal innervation of the parietal cell area was mapped out by neutral red excretion elicited by electrical stimulation of either the thoracic or the cervical vagal nerves [2] . Results: One year after vagotomy no increase in insulin response could be demonstrated in the TV and SGV groups, but a gradual increase to about 50 % of prevagotomy output occured in all PCV dogs. Reliable neutral red experiments were performed in 2 TV, 6 SGV and 4 PCV dogs. The stimmulated neutral red excretion was scanty to the same extent at the cardia region in all three groups, but a distinct antralfundic border was outlined in all 4 PCV dogs. The border was, however, only suggested in one of the SGV dogs. Conclusion: PCV including denervation of 1 cm distal of the antral-fundic border do not prevent a functional important reinnervation of the distal part of the parietal cell area. No important reinnervation seems to occur at the cardia region after any of the three vagotomy procedures. 1 and insulin (0.2 ugkg -1) i.v. bolus; after uni-and then bilateral truncal vagotomy. Each study was 120 minutes and blood was taken at 1, 3, 5, 7 and then 10 min intervals. Gastric acid was measured by autobiuret titration. Plasma was stored at -20\u00b0C until assayed for PP by RIA using an antibody sensitive to 3 fmol ml-1. Results are expressed as mean total increment _+ SE. Significance: p < 0.01\". Bombesin-stimulated gastric acid secretion was not significantly altered by vagotomy (p < 0.05), whereas that stimulated by insulin was significantly inhibited by bilateral truncal vagotomy (p < 0.01). Bilateral and right hemi-vagotomy significantly inhibited PP release by bombesin (17 < 0.01), however; only bilateral truncal vagotomy significantly inhibited PP release by insulin (p < 0.01). These results suggest that the measurement of PP release by insulin or bombesin is a sensitive index of vagal integrity and that bombesin-released PP may specifically delineate the integrity of the right vagus. Since the measurement of gastric acid secretion after operation is both uncomfortable and often difficult to interpret, the value of a simple blood test to determine vagal integrity may be of considerable clinical relevance. Glucose (G) or oleate (O) empty more slowly from the stomach than 0.15M NaC1 (S). This chemoregulation may be achieved by resistance beyond the proximal stomach [1] . We sougth to define the site of this resistance. Expt. 1: Gastric emptying of S and 600 mM G was measured in 5 dogs with intestinal cannulas 45 cm distal to the pylorus while gastric pressure was maintained at 10, 18 or 26 cm H20 with a barostat. The dogs were studied either with an uninterrupted intestinal stream or with duodenal effluent diverted through a second barostat prior to its return downstream. Since the latter ensured a constant pressure at the ligament of Treitz, any observed effects on emptying could not be due to resistance further distally. Expt. 2: Emptying of S, G, and 40 mM oleate emulsion was measurd in 5 dogs without cannulas after control antroduodenal transection and after antrectomy while gastric pressure was controlled at 11, 17 and 23 cm H20. Emptying rates expressed as the average of the volumes emptied at the 3 pressures.",

            "text": "Under both conditions in Expt. 1 emptying rose with pressure yet S emptied faster than G. Thus a major site of chemoselective resistance to emptying of liquids lies proximal to the ligament of Treitz. After antrectomy S and O emptied faster than before, however, the differences between saline and nutrients were maintained. Resistance, therefore, does not reside in the antrum or pylorus and clearly the duodenum is implicated. Gastric emptying of liquids may be abnormally rapid in DU. This abnormality my be due to a selective loss of inhibition in response to acid since previous studies [1] have demonstrated rapid emptying of acid solutions but normal emptying of glucose and fat. Previous investigations, however, used meals of only one concentration, so differences between DUs and normals (N) may have been minimized by selection of a supra-maximal inhibitory dose. Furthermore intragastric pH was not maintained constant so emptying could have been slowed by higher rates of acidification in DU. We therefore studied emptying of graded concentrations of citric acid, glucose and oleate in 500 ml meals. Gastric volumes were measured by the George technique in DUs and N at 5 rain intervals for 30 min after ingestion. Gastric pH was maintained constant by intragastric titration (3.0 for acid; 7.0 for nutrients). Subjects received one type of meal on separate days and the doses were randomly administered. Dose dependent inhibition of emptying in response to acid and nutrients occured in N and DU, but emptying was faster in DU (p<0.05). With glucose and acid the difference occured within 0-5 min whereas with fat the difference occurred between 5-30 min. Thus (1) DUs do not have a selective loss of inhibition of emptying in response to acid, and (2) the mechanisms which control emptying of fat and which are disturbed in DU differ from those which control emptying of glucose and acid. 1 Gross RA, Isenberg JI, Hogan D, Samloff IM (1978) The effect of fat on meal-stimulated duodenal acid load, duodenal pepsin load and serum gastrin in duodenal ulcer and normal subjects. A means of reducing the requirement for postoperative nasogastric intubation would be advantageous. We report the effect of cimetidine on postoperative nasogastric aspirates. Thirty patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic surgery or colonic resection were entered into a double blind randomised study, receiving cimetidine 200 mg 4 hourly or placebo (saline) by continuous intravenous infusion from the morning of the first postoperative day. Volumes of 4 hourly aspirates were recorded and pH and (H \u00f7) of samples measured. Nasogastric tube removal accorded to standard clinical practice. It has been shown, that the duodenum has a better ability to resist acid than jejunum or ileum. This resistance was attributed to alkaline secretion (a.s.) of the mucosa, because pancreatic and bile secretion were excluded. Recent in vitro studies demonstrated an energy dependent HCO3-transport (Flemstroem 1980 Am J Physiol G 239: 198). We were interested in studying the role of blood flow (bf) in the production of alkali in an in vivo preparation. min. Three groups of animals were studied: I) Controis with normovolemia for 120 min.

There has been considerable controversy as to the nature of the offending agent in the etiology in reflux oesophagitis in man. In rat studies, surgically induced reflux oesophagitis was shown to be correlated with the presence of active trypsin in the reflucting juice. Reflux of bile and gastric juice with a pH of 4 did not induce oesophagitis. Even short periods of oesophagitis (1-6 weeks) showed an increasing amount ofpanmural fibrosis which even further increased after a reflux abolishing Roux-Y operation.

One group was intact control animals not radiated. Another was intact animals radiated. In Group 3 a Roux Y cholecystojejunostomy was constructed and the bile duct ligated. Thus one limb contained bile, the other pancreatic juice. In Group 4 a blind Roux Y was constructed such that one limb was empty of contents and the other contained both bile and pancreatic juice. Each animal was subjected to a single dose of 1600 rads via an abdominal port and sacrificed four days later. The severity of injury was judged by counting the number of surviving crypts per circumference. Damage was further evaluated by histologic criteria -mucosal loss, edema, inflammation, hypervascularity and loss of mucus. The maximum histologlc grading score on this scale was 20. The microscopist was ,,blinded\" as to the origin of each tissue section. For histologic grading all radiated groups were significantly different from control (p<0.02) and from one another (/r<0.05) except pancreatic juice vs. empty. Intestine devoid of contents sustains a mild, but significant radiation injury. The presence of pancreatic juice enhances the damage. Pure bile makes for yet more severe injury but still significantly less than normal whole intestinal contents which contain both bile and pancreatic juice. The main problem facing patients with ulcerative colitis after mucosal proctectomy and ileo-anal anastomosis is severe frequency of bowel action. Our hypothesis was that either an artificial valve [1] or reversed ileal loop might improve intestinal absorption and slow transit. We tested it in dogs after colectomy and low ileo-rectal anastomosis (IRA).",

Lower pressures were found after CA, probably due to the older age of the patients in this group [3] . Normal anal canal length, the integritiy of the striated sphincter and in most cases preservation of the recto-anal reflex contribute to satisfactory continence following peranal anastomoses. Perineal descent is found in patients with idiopathic faecal incontinence (IFI) and patients presenting with symptoms of the descending perineum syndrome (DPS), who have no incontinence. Manometric, radiological and neurophysiological studies were performed in 17 patients with IFI, all of whom leaked during rectal infusion of 1500 ml saline, 18 patients with DPS, who were continent of rectally infused saline, and 14 matched controls. Both patient groups exhibited similar degrees of perineal descent below the pubococcygeal line of straining (IFI, -5.1___2.1 cm; DPS, -5.9 + 1.7 cm) compared with controis (-2.4__+ 1.5 cm;p<0.005 in both cases), and similar prolongation of both the latency of the cutaneoanal reflex (IFI, 13___5 ms; DPS, 16+6 ms; controls, 9+4 ms;/,<0.005 in both cases), and motor unit potential duration (IFI, 9.1___2.6 ms; DPS, 8.4___2.0 ms, control, 6.7+1.5 ms; p<0.01 in both cases). Moreover, both groups had an abnormal ano-rectal angle (/,<0.005), though this was more obtuse in IFI than DPS (120___21 \u00b0 vs 107___ 15\u00b0;p<0.05). However, while patients with IFI had lower sphincter pressures than normal (basal; 39___17 vs 81___29 cm water; /7<0.005; squeeze, 96___18 vs 208___84 cm water; /7<0.001), and required a lower rectal volume to inhibit sphincter tone for more than one minute (32 + 18 vs 76___29 ml; p<0.00l), these values were normal in patients with DPS (basal; 87___ 30 cm water; squeeze, 198_+90 cm water; rectal volume, 52___46 ml). These findings suggest that perineal descent and neuropathy are not necessarily associated with incontinence if sphincter pressures remain normal. Aminoacids administered either enterally or intravenously stimulate gastric secretion in both dog and man. It has been suggested that absorption of amino acids from the gut into the circulation might contribute to the intestinal phase of gastric secretion. The mechanism of this stimulation by amino acids remains uncertain but in an earlier communication we reported the direct action on the parietal cell of phenylalanine, glutamine and alanine [1] . In the present study using (14C) aminopyrine uptake as an index of dispersed parietal cell secretory function, the interaction between histamine and individual amino acids and the effect of the histamine H2-receptor blocker ranitidine (10-4 molar) on these interactions have been examined. Results (percentage of maximal stimulation produced by 10-4 molar histamine)",

In order to assess the optimal conditions for segmental pancreatic graft viability the following experiment was conducted. The duct obliterated splenic lobe of the canine pancreas was autotransplanted by end to side fashion to the femoral vessels (n = 10). The graft was lodged in a subcutaneous pocket. A month later total pancreatectomy was completed. The dogs were supplemented with pancreatic enzymes (Viokase). Mean survival was 42___ 12 days. Deaths were due to hyperglycemia when grafts lysed from local infection and thrombosis. In the second experimental group (n= 10) the autografts were anastomosed to the iliac vessels and placed intraperitoneally followed by total pancreatectomy one month later. Construction of a distal splenic arterio-venous fistula increased blood flow from 31.4 cc/min to 108 cc/min. The pancreatic duct was obliterated with neoprene (n=4) silastic (n=3) or left open (n=3). Three dogs died one month to four months due to graft fibrosis and failure. Seven dogs had been followed from four months up to seven months when sacrificed. All were normoglycemic. Mean K values for IVGTT were 1.5. The normoglycemic dogs had mean plasma concentrations of amino acids similar to healthy controls. A two to threefold elevation was observed in pancreatectomized diabetic dogs for plasma leucine, isoleucine and valine. Immunoreactivity of pancreatic polypeptide was measured by radioimmunoassay with an antibody raised against the human hormone by RE. Chance, Lilly Research Laboratories. Mean plasma levels rose form 256--+28 S.E. pg/ml to over 1000 pg/ml following protein meal (20g ground lean beef/kg) in all normal control dogs (n=4), and to levels in the range of 390 to over 1000 pg/ml in the same dogs following infusion ofbombesin (1 pg/kg/ h) for 15 min. Mean basal levels were lower (42___ 2.2 S.E. pg/ml) in dogs with autotransplants and did not increase significantly during any stimulatory test. The levels of pancreatic polypeptide did not distinguish between viable and failing grafts. In successful grafts histology showed fibrosis of the exocrine component. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of clusters of functional islet cells in the six-month implants. A and B cells were common. D cells were much less frequent. Release of secretion granules into the perivascular connective tissue space was observed. The results indicate that vascularized segmental pancreatic graft comprising 25 % to 30 % of the pancreatic mass maintains normal carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Graft survival was extended by intraperitoneal location and creation od distal splenic A-V fistula, but chronic graft fibrosis occurred regardless of the method of pancreatic duct treatment. The results further suggest the necessity of an intact vagal innervation for the physiological or pharmacological stimulation of pancreatic polypeptide release from thendocrine pancreas which is otherwise apparently functional. Besides, these considerations rule out pancreatic polypeptide levels as a useful marker for evaluation of pancreas graft. Polyisoprene ductal occlusion allows segmental pancreatic transplantation in man with satisfactory early islet cell function. However acute rejection remains a problem as the diagnosis, based on hyperglycaemia and glycosuria, represents a late manifestation of rejection. Although llqndiumlabelled platelets have been used in the diagnosis of renal rejection [1] , their use in pancreas transplants has not been studied. ~ In 6 patients, autologous llqn-labelled platelets were injected on the second, sixth and tenth days following combined renal and pancreatic transplantation. Graft radioactivity was expressed as the ratio of counts from the pancreas over a reference area on daily gamma images for 14 days.",

These are failure of current systems to replenish the ischemically injured organ, to reliably extend the period of organ preservation and to definitely determine organ viability. Previous studies have documented the value of electrochemical redox control in rejuvenation of the ischemically injured kidney during perfusion preservation. This study was undertaken to develop the cost effective technique applicable to current organ preservation systems, to test the reliability of redox measurement in prediction of organ viability and to determine the ability ofredox maintenance to safely extend the period of organ preservation. A disposable cell has been developed using Reticulated Vitreous Carbon as an electrode which is driven by a potentiostat powered by a nine volt transistor battery. Short term preservation studies using ischemically injured dog kidneys (60 rain in-situ warm ischemia) were auto transplanted after 24 h of pulsatile preservation to determine the optimum redox level of the hypothermic kidney. This was determined to be a -20 mv vs the standard calomel electrode. Twenty-one adult mongrel dogs were equally divided into three groups. Pulsatile perfusion preservation was extended to four days in Group A with redox level monitored only. Group B was treated with electrochemical reduction for four days and Group C for six days. Three of seven dogs survived in Group A following auto transplantation and immediate contralateral nephrectomy. The kidneys of all survivors were able to bring perfusate redox potential under control and maintain this level throughout the preservation period. Six of seven dogs in Group B survived with a mean posttransplant peak Serum Creatinine of 4.5 rag/100 ml. In Group C four of seven kidneys supported life immediately. All redox controlled kidneys made copious amounts of urine. Our data indicate that perfusate potential may be either monitored as a reliable index of organ viability or controlled to allow extended safe preservation. Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) has been shown to be an effective agent in combination with increased doses of steroids in reversing renal allograft rejection. Since it is frequently undesirable to employ raised doses of steroids, the following study evaluated the effect of 15-21 i.v. daily doses of horse ATG alone without additional steroids, on 2nd-5th rejection episodes in 10 recipients of cadaveric renal allografts (28 rejections: 25 biopsy-proven) detected within 3-18 mos. of transplantation. Of 28 rejection episodes, 25 were successfully reversed, with return of serum creatinine to pre-rejection levels in 18 episodes (7 patients). Three patients had primarily humoral rejections and returned to dialysis 2-4 mos. after treatment of the last rejection. Levels of circulating horse immunoglobulins were obtained in all 10 patients during and follwing administration of ATG. Recurrent rejections (3rd-5th) following last treatment with ATG (3-11 mos.) were seen in 5/10 patients. All 5 patients had rapid immune eliminiation of ATG (1/2 life 2-4 days) as compared to the 5 patients who had no more than 2 rejection episodes (1/2 life 6-14 days). ATG without additional steroids is an effective agent for reversal of multiple renal allograft rejections which by biopsy are primarily cell-mediated. To be effective, heterologous ATG must be given in adequate total doses and/or from appropriate heterologous source, to prevent rapid immune elimination by the recipient. The use of ATG alone for treatment of recurrent allograft rejections is particularly recommended for its steroidsparing effect in treatment of multiple rejections and for those patients at high risk from steroid side effects.",

Suppressor cells were not found in the lymphocyte preparations from the blood and lymph nodes of appropriate controls. From clinical and experimental studies it is known that blood transfusions may have immunosupressive as well as immunostimulating consequences. The effect of transfusions on graft survival has been extensively studied by our group in the BN to WAG rat model. In this donor-host combination it was found that a donor specific pre-transplant blood transfusion could lead to a marked prolongation of heart and kidney graft survival, whereas the similar pretreatment resulted in accelerated rejection of BN skin allografts. This specific model was used to investigate the influence of a single BN transfusion on the growth of 2 different syngeneic transplantable tumors in WAG rats. The first tumor was a radiation induced basal cell carcinoma of the Skin (T 1), the second tumor was a chemically induced adenocarcinoma of the duodenum (T 2). The antigenicity of both tumors was assessed in vivo, using classical challenge-protection experiments. It was observed that T I exhibited strong immunogenetic properties, whereas T 2 was only weakly immunogenic. The doubling time ofT I was 2.5 days, the doubling-time of the adenocarcinoma was 14 days. Intravenous inoculation of isolated T 1 cells led to development of lung nodules which could be counted after 14 days. WAG rats were injected i.e. with 1 ml of BN blood or syngeneic blood (controls) at 7-14 days before tumor challenge. T l was given in two different ways: a) sc. implantation of+2x2 mm pieces, b) i.e. injection of 106 isolated tumor cells. T 2 was implanted sc. only. Each experimental group consisted of 8 animals. For T 1 it was found that allogeneic blood transfusions caused a slight (but not significant) inhibition of subcutaneous tumor growth. However, in the T 1 lung-metastasis model it was observed that a single BN blood transfusion led to a 50 % reduction of nodules, counted at 3 weeks after inoculation. This reduction in number and size of nodules was highly significant (p<0.01). For tumor T 2, the BN blood transfusions evoked a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of the sc. implanted tumor. At 8 weeks after implantation all tumors in the control group had grown to a diameter of 10-16 rnm (average diameter 12.2 ram). In the group pretreated with BN blood, only 3 of 8 tumors were palpable at that time (average diamter 4 mm). For T 1 it was further investigated whether a single BN transfusion, given one week after i.e. tumor cell inoculation, would have any influence on tumor growth. No significant effect on number or size of the lung nodules could be noticed, if anything, the transfusion appeared to have a stimulatory effect.",

This observation may have important clinical implications. We report here the serial study of circulating immune complexes (CIC) in two human tumor systems, colorectal cancer and gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). CIC were assayed by antigen nonspecific insolubilization induced by 3.75 % polyethylene glycol (PEG) and monitored as A OD45o changes by spectrophotometry. All 11 of the serially studied colorectal cancer patients presented with elevated CIC levels (mean = 610 + 396 zt OD450) as compared to our standard CIC level for pooled normal human sera (202--+_4 AOD450, p<0.05). Initial values in these patients range from 304 to 1407 A OD450 with no correlation to tumor load, site of presentation, or subsequent clinical course. In 6/7 patients who underwent ,,curative\" resection of primary or metastatic colorectal cancers, serial CIC elevations occured only when antigen excess (measured by simultaneous carci-noembryonic antigen [CEA] assay) decreased. Immunoglobulin components of fractionated CIC showed predominantly IgA subclass. In 30 GTN patients followed with serial CIC and simultaneous human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) assay, only those patients documented to enter hCG remission after molar evacuation showed significant elevation of CIC. Chromatographic fractionation of peak CIC in one such patient defined three irnmunoglobulin containing fractions showing immunoreactivity to one of four paternal HLA haplotypes (AW32). One ,,antigen\" fraction (<25.000 MW) from this complex completely inhibited reference anti-AW32 binding. As in the colorectal cancer patients, these data show that CIC rise only when antigen excess decreases (reflected in the GTN patients by hCG normalization). In addition, some GTN patients may react to immunogenic paternal HLA haplotypes as part of their response to molar pregnancy. DFMO, an enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), reduces tumor polyamine levels, inhibits growth of EMT6 sarcomas and hepatomas in experimental animals, and induces remission in human leukemia. A renal adenocarcinoma (RA) cell suspension, or a 1 mm segment ofWilms' (WM) tumor was transplanted intrarenally into Balb/C mice (n--105) or subcutaneously into Wistar-Furth rats (n=80) respectively. DFMO (2 %) in drinking water was administered to half the animals in each group throughout the experiment. At 28 days RA tumors in DFMO-fed mice weighed 72 % less than tumors in control animals (p<0.001); WM tumor weight at 28 days was not affected by DFMO feeding. The mean number of lung metastases in DFMO-fed R.A-bearing mice was 0.1 and in RA-bearing control mice was 1.4 (p<0.001). DFMO caused 72-75 % inactivation of tumor ODC, reduced RA putrescine levels by 710/o (p<0.001), reduced WM putrescine levels by 65% (d7<0.01), reduced WM spermidine levels by 58% (p<0.001) and increased WM spermine levels by 37% (p<0.01). DFMO feeding did not alter DNA content of RA or WM tumors. Although final carcass weight was similar in all animals, DFMO feeding progressively reduced total body weight (TBW) of mice, but not rats, until at day 20 the TBW of DFMO-fed mice was 10.5% less than tumor-bearing control mice (p<0.01).

Perfusate samples were evaluated at 5 rain intervals and concentrations of 5-HT, SP, motilin were measured by RIA's developed in our laboratory. After two 5-min basal periods, the supradiaphragmatic sectioned vagus nerves were stimulated electrically (10V, 5m s, 10Hz). The output from the loop in ng/5 min (5-HT) and pg/5 rain (SP and MT) was: introduced into the jejunum of conscious dogs through an external small bowel fistula. The gut was perfused at 5 ml min-1 with a physiological electrolyte solution containing the non-absorbable marker polyethylene glycol (mol. wt. 4000; 5 g 1-1); water and electrolyte absorption and transit time (TT) were measured during intravenous (I.V.) administration of each peptide, and during preceding and succeeding I.V. control infusions of 0.15M NaCI. Separate studies showed jejunal absorption and TT to be constant over prolonged periods during I.V. NaC1 administration. Bombesin (10 pmol kg-lmin-1) and neurotensin (1 pmol kg-~min 1) significantly reduced jejunal water absorption; bombesin and enkephalin (0.5 nmol kag-1rain-1) significantly prolonged TT; and enkephalin encreased water absorption (/7<0.05 in all cases). Measurement of plasma neurotensin during I.V. infusion indicated that physiological blood levels were not exceeded during these studies. Conclusion: A number of peptides may be involved in the regulation of small bowel function. The effect of neurotensin on jejunal water transport provides a possible mechanism linking raised blood neurotensin levels with intestinal intraluminal fluid accumulation in the dumping syndrome. In order to establish Whether this release was under adrenergic control, 4 cats had cervical ganglionectomies. Using the same electrical paramenters, stimulation of the cut cervical vagus nerves resulted in identical 5-HT responses as above. In 4 additional cats atropine administration (lmg/kg IV) totally abolished the 5-HT responses to vagal nerve stimulation.",

This release appears to be under cholinergic control. Since diabetes mellitus is markedly improved immediately after jejunoileal bypass before significant weight loss, but only gradually and often incompletely changed after gastric bypass, it seemed appropriate to investigate the effects of intestinal exclusion on experimental diabetes. Studies were performed on alloxan diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats. Two days after jejunal exclusion (JE) in 8 rats (resection of proximal 1/3 of small intestine), fasting blood sugars (FBS) decreased 580, from 344 to 146mg/dl, and averaged 164 mg/dl at 3 weeks. After ileal exclusion (IE) in 7 rats (resection of distal 1/3 of small intestine), FBS fell 39% in 2 days, from 250 to 153 mg/dl, but increased 40% above preoperative levels to 350 mg/ dl at 3 weeks. Sham operated rats responded similarly to IE rats. After alloxan and operations, all groups lost weight, but only JE rats began to increase weight at a normal rate. Increased water intake, polyuria (140 ml/24 h), and glycosuria (2756 rag/all), were present in IE rats; JE rats were normal (urinary output <20 ml/24 h, and urinary glucose 36 mg/dl). Oral glucose tolerance tests (GTT) were extremely abnormal in IE rats, similar to those in non-operated alloxan rats, while GTT curves in JE rats were similar to normal animals, with some elevation at 30, 60 and 120 min. Serum insulin levels remained low in all alloxan treated rats after jejunal exclusion. Possible mechanisms, currently under study, relate to carbohydrate malabsorption and changes in enteric chemical mediators. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the changes in somatostatin release and somatostatin-containing cells of the pancreas and stomach of the streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic rat after the amelioration of diabetes by whole pancreatic transplantation. Highly inbred Lewis rats were divided into three groups: (1) normal rats, (2) STZinduced diabetic rats and (3) transplanted rats. Diabetes was induced by the administration of STZ (60 mg/kg). On the seventh day after STZ treatment, pancreatic transplantation was performed. Four weeks after the transplantation, in vivo and in vitro, studies were performed. Pancreatic D cells and gastric somatostatin-containing cells were stained with antibody enzyme method. Studies in vivo showed marked improvement of the impaired arginine-induced insulin release by the transplantation. Studies in vitro employing isolated perfused rat pancreas and stomach revealed following results: Mean basal pancreatic somatostatin release in normal, diabetic and transplanted rats were 12___3, 24-t-7, and 17__+4 pg/ml, respectively. Total amount of pancreatic somatostatin release in each group during arginine stimulation (19.2. mM) were 946--+200, 2321___266, and 1013-+126 pg/15 min, respectively. Significantly higher somatostatin release was obtained from the diabetic pancreas, which was, however, reduced to normal after the whole pancreatic transplantation. On the other hand, insulin release from the diabetic pancreas was severly impaired and pancreatic transplantation had not effect on insulin release from the host pancreas in the transplanted rats. As to the glucagon release, there was not significant difference among them. Mean basal gastric somatostatin release in normal, diabetic and transplanted rats were 179-t-5, 173___5, and 135 + 5 pg/ml, respectively. There was no significant difference between normal and diabetic rats, though the significant decreased value was obtained in the transplanted rats. (vs. normal;/7<0.01, and diabetes; /7<0.01). On the other hand, glucagon-stimulated peak values in these groups were 498_ 36, 662___47, and 412+25pg/ml, respectively. Glucagon-stimulated gastric somatostatin release in diabetic rats was significantly increased, but reduced to normal value by pancreatic transplantation. Also, a number of pancreatic D cells and gastric somatostatin-containing cells were markedly increased on the diabetic rats. On the other hand, a number of these cells in the transplanted rats were descreased to normal levels.",

From these results, it is suggested that pancreatic and gastric somatostation are regulated by circulation and/or metablic of nutrients. Doppler velocity recordings are widely used for the non-invasive diagnosis of carotid arterial disease. Although detailed analysis of carotid Doppler spectral information has been suggested as a method for improving diagnostic sensitivity, the accuracy of the relationship between the Doppler recording and the true instantaneous velocity profile has not been established. The Purpose of this study is to determine if a CW Doppler velocitymeter can accurately transduce the true instantaneous blood flow velocity information. Methods: A pulsatile flow model has been constructed in which it is possible to record the instantaneous Doppler spectrum and simultaneously photograph and measure the true velocity profile. A computer controlled pump generates a carotid waveform in tubes without stenoses and with, symmetrical stenoses. Flow is visualized using the photochromic dye tracer technique. A short burst of UV light from a laser is passed across the tube. A narrow band of the fluid turns blue, its movement is photographed, and the instantaneous velocity profile determined every 10 msec throughout the pulse cycle. At the same time, the instantaneous Doppler spectral information is recorded by a frequency analyzer. The Results follow. For pulsatile laminar flow, the Doppler spectrum correctly recorded the true velocity spectrum, including the instant/~neous maximum velocity and mean velocity. For disturbed flow, it was not possible to show the same direct relationship between the Doppler spectral recordings and the blood flow velocity. In Conclusion Doppler velocitymeters accurately transduce velocity information when flow is laminar but when flow is disturbed there is not a direct relationship between Doppler recordings and the true velocity profile. Consequently, one should be cautious in attempting to relate Doppler measurements of disturbed flow directly to the true changes in the velocity pattern. Early failure of arterial reconstruction may originate in poor patient selection. In aorto-iliac stenosis (AIS) selection for operation relies upon clinical examination of the femoral pulse and radiology. Since single plane arteriography is inadequate for accurate definition ofiliac stenosis [1, 2] , this paper compares clinical examination, Doppler ankle systolic pressure (ASPI) and femoral signal analysis (Laplace Transform Damping, LTD, and Pulsatility Index, PI) [3] with biplanar contrast studies. i At biplanar angiography 66 of 102 ischaemic lower limbs had AIS with diameter reduction from 25-84 %, Of the remainder, 25 were normal (<25 % stenosis) and 11 were ,,occluded\" ('_--850/0). Nearly two thirds (61%) of limbs with a clinically normal femoral pulse had identifiable arteriographic stenosis (~-__.250/0), Upstream abnormality was predicted incorrectly in 15 % and the overall accuracy of clinical examination was 67 %, both for detecting stenosis and predicting its severtiy. ASPI (median 0.61; 95% Confidence ,Limits 0.3-1.0) and PI (5.4; 2.3-0.05) although correlated with stenosis (ASPIr = 0.65; p = 0.05, PIr = 0.62; p=0.05 Variance analysis for linear regression), did not aid the clinician further (accuracy 62 %). However LTD (0.72; 0.37-1.0) was well correlated (r=0.76, p=0.001) and did improve assessment ofiliac stenosis (accuracy 84 %).",

Stepwise regression analysis showed the computed flow values to be independent of probevessel angle, depth and lumen diameter for vessels greater than 2.5 mm in diameter. These results suggest that this pulsed Doppler instrument has the versatility and accuracy essential for diagnostic flow measurements in the main conducting arteries of the neck and limbs and in vascular bypass grafts. In the assessment of patients undergoing carotid artery surgery, many laboratory methods are available in addition to angiography. In a series of 210 patients experience has been gained with the use of EEG, TC 99m isotope scanning, OPG, CT scanning and Doppler. In a 10 year follow up over 85% of patients had a satisfactory outcome. An early mortality of 2% in the beginning of the series has been eliminated due to improved selection. In this report the application of multi-gated pulsed Doppler techniques is reported. This allows a non invasive measurement of mean volume flow in the common carotid artery with a method reproducibility of + 5 %. Mean volume flow in 50 undiseased arteries (25 subjects mean age 46 years) was found to be 536\u00b1 104 (S.D.) ml/min. From this a lower range for normal flow of 300 ml per minute (2 x S.D.) was selected. 30 patients were investigated before surgery and a follow up examination was performed at a mean interval of 4V2 months post operatively. 3 Groups were defined. Group A >300 ml/min; Group B 200-300 ml/min; Group C <200 ml/min, Of 14 arteries in Group A before surgery, 11 remained in the Group and 3 dropped to Group B.

Data base material consisting of history, physical examination, laboratory data, angiography, and operative findings in 199 patients undergoing femoral-popliteal bypass grafting was entered into a computer programmed for stepwise logistic regression analysis. The computer identified and ranked 24 factors that influenced outcome. The top five factors (other than technical problems) included quantity of runoff, previous ipsilateral femoral-popliteal bypass, preoperative prediction of potential amputation level, concurrent proximal vascular reconstruction, and the location for distal graft anastomosis. Having established the computer data base, it is now possible to enter information from new patients into the computer which will weigh all factors and indicate the likelihood of surgical success. In addition, tables can be generated which will look at simple combinations of variables to predict patency. For example, in a patient about to undergo a primary femoral-popliteal bypass with no anticipated technical problems, the likelihood of success as a function of runoff and preoperative amputation level is as follows: Irreversibility of shock and ischemic injury is generally considered a consequence of extensive cellular injury. To study the role of intravascular coagulation in shock, 56 rats were bled to a mean arterial pressure of 50 mm Hg for 3 hrs or 25% uptake of shed blood, whichever occured first.

The high levels of enkephalins in the adrenolumbar vein indicate that the adrenal gland is the main source of these peptides in the circulation. In addition toil-END, the ENK seem to play a role in the pathogenesis of shock as well. At our present state of knowledge, however, it is difficult to design a coherent concept of mechanisms involved. This shows that CP treated cells bound nearly as much [125t]-ACTH analog as control cells but there was very little specific binding to SP treated cells. Low concentrations of ACTH effectively displaced the ACTH analog whereas exposure of adrenocortical cells to SP resulted in a significant decrease in ACTH receptors. This suggests that SP has a factor(s) that binds to ACTH receptors of adrenocortical ceils which may adversely affect the stress response of shock. F-43 has been proposed as superior to other asanguinous fluids due to increased oxygen carrying capacity. Evaluation to date has been largely uncontrolled and at extremes of hemodilution (Hct. <2 %) rarely seen clinically. Near infrared spectrophotometric monitoring of brain cytochrome a, a3 redox state, a sensitive indicator ofintramitochondrial oxygen availability, offers a unique opportunity to contrast F-43 with balanced salt-albumin (BSA) and whole blood saline (WBS) as a resuscitative regimen in a clinically relevant model. Fifteen rats were subjected to 30 minutes of hypoxia (FIO2 = 7,5%) and hemorrhagic hypotension (MAP = 30 mmHC), then randomly allocated to one of three groups and resuscitated by FIO2 = 100% and infusion of either F-43, BSA, or WBS. Cytochrome a, a3 redox state was monitored continuously at 813 run. Thirty additional rats were sacrificed at baseline, end shock and 20 and 120 minutes post resuscitation for cerebral cortical ATP and lactate assay. Despite hematocrits as low as 15 % in the BSA and F-43 groups, there were no significant differences /7<0.05 between groups in the parameters of oxygen sufficiency; ATP, lactate, and cytochrome a, a3 redox state. We assume differences in cardiac output compensated for differences in arterial oxygen content. On this basis we suggest perfluorochemical utilization should be limited to situations in which hematocrits are <15 % and when cardiac reserve is limited. Metabolites of the prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 (PGH2) affect both vascular tone and platelet aggregation and thereby may influence blood flow. We, therefore, determined the metabolites formed from PGH2 by microsomes isolated from human saphenous vein used for aortocoronary bypass surgery. In the absence of reduced glutathione (GSH), the enzymatic metabolism of 14C-PGH2 produced only prostacyclin (PGI2) as measured by the formation of its stable breakdown product 6-keto-PGFla. The amount of PGI2 formed varied from 10-50% of the substrate depending upon the microsomal protein and PGH2 concentrations. In addition, the nonenzymatic breakdown of PGH2 resulted in the formation of PGF2a, PGE2, PGD2 and heptadecatrienoic acid (HHT). There was no formation of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) as measured by the absence of its stable breakdown product TXB2. In the presence ofGSH, a required cofactor for microsomal PGE2 isomerase activity, the formation of PGE2 was augmented 2 fold (up to 35 % of the substrate) indicating enzymatic for-mation of PGE2. The GSH either did not alter or augmented (less than 1 fold) the formation of PGI2. The increased formation of PGE2 in the presence of GSH was at the expense of decreased nonenzymatic breakdown of PGH2 to PGF2a, PGD2 and HHT. These data suggest that prostacyclin synthetase activity may serve to protect the vessel graft from platelet aggregation and/or vessel spasms and may possibly serve as an indicator of graft viability. Thrombosis is a frequent cause of early arterial bypass graft failure and platelets are known to be major determinants ofthrombus formation on arterial surfaces. PGI2 and flbriolytic activators from the vascular wall counteract intravascular thrombosis. The aim of this work was to study the effect of arterial grafting on the aforementioned mechanisms.",

Upon removal, the grafts were checked for patency and sections from the proximal and distal anastomoses and midgraft were obtained for determination of PGI2 production (RIA) fibrinolysis activators activity (histochemical method) and for light and scanning electron microscopy. Sections from the femoral arteries were also obtained. The results of PGI2 generation are expressed in ng/ml/cm% All grafts showed fibrinolytic activity in the adventitia but 4 grafts in group II also showed fibrinolytic activity in the intima. Early neointimal fibrous hyperplasia (NFH) characterized by proliferation of smooth muscle cells was present in group II. The, occluded grafts showed organizing thrombus material and inflammatory cells and the patent ones showed fibrin and scattered inflammatory cells. In groups I and III, SEM revealed numerous platelets and RBC's incorporated into a proteinaceous material overlying the anastomoses and in some specimens obvious thrombus material was present. In group II, the anastomotic areas were covered with large endothelial cells, nonetheless, some areas were denuded and small thrombi were occasionally noticed. In conclusion: 1. Anastomotic sites create a strong stimulus for thrombus formation despite a high production of PGI2. This suggests that antithrombotic therapy may be necessary to prevent early failures. 2. HUVG develop the capacity to produce PGI2 and fibrinolytic activators and 3. although the etiology of NFH remains obscure, the decreased levels of PGI2 in group II suggest that exhaustion of PGI2 generation from the endothelium might occur leading to proliferation of smooth muscle cells (NFH). These cells will in turn supply PGI2 if a persistent stimulus exists.",

The present study was designed to evaluate this effect in vivo.

The optimal dosage of aspirin as a fibrinolytic agent requires further study. The terminal vascular bed of malignant tumors is characterized by a lack of organization, differentiation and sufficient developement of nutritional capillaries. As a result, malignant tumors reveal consistently small regions of low or even no perfusion. Pre-vious data in a melanoma indicate that due to the rarefication of capillaries, the full impact of tumor treatment \u00b1st diminished by an elevated microvascu lar resistance, which could significantly affect the impact of tumor therapy. Since the improvement of the blood's fluidity has been shown as one therapeutic modality to increase significantly the capillary blood flow, it was assumed that this measure might enhance the accessibility of tumor tissue for bloodborne drugs. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of the improvement,of microcirculatory flow on tumor growth and tissue oxygenation. Moreover, the response of the melanoma to chemotherapy was evaluated when isovolemic hemodilution was employed in conjunction with chemotherapy.",

Intravital microscopy, however, revealed petechial bleeding and localized, interstitial edema which compressed a small number of capillaries. By contrast, the tumor's diameter remained at app. 3 mm for a period of ten days with chemotherapy alone (3 animals). In one of the animals, a complete stop in the melanoma microcirculation was seen within four hours after infusion of DTIC followed by a significant decrease of tumor diameter. When chemotherapy was initiated in hemodiluted animals, neither retardation of tumor developement nor vascular obstruction was observed (5 animals). Conclusion: Capillary blood flow of the melanoma can be enhanced by hemodilution thus diminishing tissue hypoxia. This measure, however, was associat-ed with an increase in melanoma diameter of 30%. At the present, we investigate whether, in hemodiluted animals, a reduction of tumor size can be obtained with a higher dose of DTIC. ). However, the etiology of stress hyperglucagonemia in the immobilized rat is only poorly defined. Since during restraint stress, catecholamines (CA) are elevated and stimulation ofglucagon by CA is accepted (Woods SC D Jr [1974] Physiol Rev. 54: 596), we decided to study by surgical means the the relative contribution to glucagonemia of different sources of CA, i.e. peripheral sympathetic nervous system and adrenal medulla. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley gastric fistula rats (n=74), weight approx. 250 g, were subjected to either sham-op or various sympathectomies [microsurgical splanchnicotomy = S-SX; chemical sympathectomy = C-SX (150 mg/kg 6-OH-dopamine ip two days prior to the experiment); adrenal demedullation = AMX; combinations: S-SX + AMX; C-SX + AMX]. Gastric acid secretory trials (duration 8 h), preceded by a 24 h fasting period were carried out 6-7 days following the operation. At the start of the experiment an intraperitoneal polyethylene tube, was inserted into the abdominal cavity of the rats, allowing a constant infusion of physiological saline (4 ml/ kg/h). In addition, stress was performed by pairwise restraint of the extremities and small electric shock waves applied by a tail electrode. At the end of the experiment, blood was drawn from the vena portae and the abdominal aorta for plasma and serum. Hormones (glucagon, insulin) were measured by radioimmunoassay, glucose enzymatically, volume was read to the next 0.1 ml, acidity by microtitration. Results (see table) : Volume and acidity are not changed by the various sympathectomies, when 179 compared to the sham group. The same is true for acid secretion, except in S-SX + AMX, where it is elevated. Glucagon in peripheral plasma is elevated in C-SX, AMX and C-SX + AMX. In the portal vein, glucagon is dccreased in S-SX + AMX (408___99 pg/ ml) and elevated in C-SX + AMX (2625___405 pg/ml) when compared with sham rats (930--.195 pg/ml). The portal/aortal glucagon ratio is significantly decreased only in C-SX and AMX (1.7--+0.9, 1.7--.1.0, resp.) when compared with sham (3.8--_ 2.1). Insulin is increased only in AMX, glucose decreased in AMX, S-SX + AMX and C-SX + AMX, insulin and glucose are unchanged in the other groups.",

Stress hyperglucagonemia in the rat is confirmed (levels during zero stress 30-180 pg/ml) and also the rise in insulin following removal ofadrenomedullary CA (but not other sympathectomy); 2. The blood glucose fall (AMX; S-SX + AMX; C-SX + AMX) is not uniformly paralleled by hyperglucagonemia, but in the case of AMX it may be secondary to relative stress hypoglycemia owing to removal of adrenal medullary CA or reactive insulin release; 3. Mechanism underlying the increased systemic glucagon despite partial (C-SX; AMX) or total (C-SX + AMX) sympathectomy are yet unknown. 4. During stress the enterogastrone component of hyperglucagonemia may be of minor importance. EVLW showed good agreement with gravimetric lung water determinations. Significant lung water accumulation was produced by pressure elevations over 20 mmHg. Reductions in plasma oncotic pressure significantly increased transvascular fluxes at each level of pressure elevation. However, fluid accumulation was not significantly greater during hypoproteinemia. We conclude that a 40-50% reduction in plasma oncotic pressure does not contribute to increased high pressure edema because the lymphatic safety factor is augmented. This phenomenon may explain the well tolerated state of hypoproteinemia in patients after hemorrhagic shock. Computerized gamma scintigraphy is a new technique for the analysis of albumin flux in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The objectives of this study were to obtain normal control values and to determine the method's validity in patients with cardiogenic vs. permeability pulmonary edema. Methods: Following 10 mCi99mTechnetium-human serum albumin, lung :heart radioactivity ratios were determined. This ratio remains constant unless there is a leak o falbumin, when a rising ratio is seen, called the ,,slope index\" (SI). SI's were determined in 5 control individuals who had :> 50 % left ventricular ej ection fraction and < 7s pulmonary circulation. Thirtythree studies were obtained in 27 patients using a portable gamma camera. Fourteen patients had clinical evidence of ARDS. Results: Studies were considered positive if the SI was 2 S.D. > control mean ( -0.4___0.5 x 10-3 units/ min). Among 15 positive studies, all had diffuse air space disease on chest radiographs. Their average pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) was 14.6_+4.6 mmHg. The average artertial: alveolar oxygen tension ratio (a/A)O2 was 0.31+--0.15 on 10.8 cm H20 PEEP, which were both significantly (p<0.01) different from patients with normal SI's. Positive SI's were present from 24 hours to 6 days following the apparent onset of ARDS in 6 patients. Recovery of gas exchange was associated with normal SI's on repeat studies in 4 patients. Of 6 patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, 5 had negative studies (18-29 mmHg PCWP) and I a positive study (40 mmHg PCWP). Conclusion: Gamma scintigraphy was a sensitive, non-invasive tool for the detection of a pathological increase in pulmonary protein flux, which was usually normal in cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Positive scintigraphy was associated with significantly impaired gas exchange. The method documented that the leak of albumin in ARDS may last for days but resolves with recovery.",

There was a significant decrease of particles around the operating site (60 % less, at 80 cm and 30 % less, at 2 meters). In vivo: the bleeding was weighted around 50% less than with conventional coagulation. Thermocoagulation did not delay or disturb the healing of the patella after wire synthesis. The in vitro nucleation time of cholesterol crystals from gallbladder bile of patients with gallstones is more rapid than that from normal persons, (Holan RT [1979] Gastroenterology 77: 611). This study determined whether this was due to a gallbladder or liver defect and wether the defect was the addition of a nucleating factor or the deletion of an antinucleating factor. Hepatic and gallbladder bile were gathered at surgery in stone patients and gallbladder bile in patients with a normal biliary tract. After ultracentrifugation, the isotropic phase was observed daily by polarizing microscopy until cholesterol crystals appeared. In gallstone patients, the nucleation time of gallbladder bile was significantly more rapid, 2.5 days+0.9 SEM, than that of hepatic bile 7.9+2.1 days, although hepatic bile was significantly more saturated with cholesterol [cholesterol saturation index (CSI), 2.12_+0.36], than gallbladder bile, (CSI, 1.31_+ 0.12). Thus the characteristic short nucleation time of stone formers is due to an alteration in bile after it enters the gallbladder. To determine whether the gallbladder defect was due to addition of a nucleating factor or the deletion of an antinucleating factor, isotropic phases of normal gallbladder bile and that from stone formers were mixed and nucleation time determined. Mixtures of up to 95 % normal bile had pathological nucleation times demonstrating that the defect is the addition of a nucleating factor by the gallbladder, and that this factor is potent. The rate of formation ofgaUstone precursor crystals in bile, although faster in gallstone patients than in controls, is unrelated to the degree of cholesterol supersaturation [1] , implying that other factors are involved. Two competing factors seem likely; (a) secondary seed crystals in bile may trigger and accelerate gallstone crystal formation from supersaturated solution; (b) \"Poisons\" in bile may retard or inhibit crystal growth.",

The shockwaves are generated externally by underwater discharge of a condensor with sparking electrodes which are localized in a focus o fan elliptic cavity. For treatment the renal concrement must be positioned exactly in the second, virtual focus opposite to the elliptic cavity. Since then, altogether 126 patients were subjected to this form of treatment in our institute by the colleagues of the department of urology at the University of Munich. 90% of the patients got rid of their concrements within a few days, in 8.5 % small remnants remained in the renal pelvis, and in 1.5% (2 cases) additional surgery became necessary.

For this purpose, human gallbladder concrements of different composition (bilirubin, cholesterol) were implanted into the gallbladder of dogs for exposure to shockwave treatment after wound healing. Under in vitro-conditions the biliary concrements could be crushed into any size desired, irrespective of their composition, while only in 8 out of 10 experiments this was accomplished under in vivo-conditions. Blockage of the biliaiy duct after shockwave exposure was never observed. Concrements which were experimentally implanted into the bile duct could be visualized without difficulties by contrast medium. Here, destruction by shockwaves was accomplished as well. Currently experiments are conducted to dissolve remnants of biliary concrements after treatment by administration of desoxycholic acid. Precise positioning of the gallbladder concrements in the second virtual focus is a problem which has not been satisfactorily solved so far, because the concrements cannot be visualized by conventional X-ray techniques. Alternatively it is attempted to employ ultrasound, or visualization by retrograde injection of Xray contrast medium through a catheter. In experimental animals, we leave a T-formed drain in the gallbladder for injection of contrast medium. In animal experiments conducted so far, histological or clinical evidence for tissue damage has not been obtained, as is the case with shockwave treatment of kidney stones. We are convinced that treatment of biliary concrements by shockwave exposure can be employed under clinical conditions in the near future. Exploration of the common bile duct (CBD) for calculi, particularly in the presence of obstructive jaundice, is a procedure with considerable mortality and 183 morbidity. To avoid the problem of retained stones, choledochoduodenostomy and transduodenal sphincteroplasty have been recommended, but have their own complications. This morbidity might be reduced by removal of CBD calculi prior to surgery. Endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) allows this. A review of 123 cases of ES performed for calculi indicated that this was a safe (complications 8% no deaths) and reliable procedure (85 % success rate). A study was conducted of patients with known CBD stones who had either preliminary ES followed by operation at a later date (Group I) or operation alone (Group II). This study showed a lower morbidity in Group I. A prospective randomised controlled study has begun on the basis of these findings and the data from both studies are shown in the Table. These results suggest that pre-operative endoscopic sphincterotomy my reduce the morbidity of CBD stones.",

Of 2.172 sphincter SC, recorded in 18 animals, 775 (36%) were not associated with duodenal acitivity, whereas 1.397 of 1400 (99.8 %) duodenal SC were accompanied by synchronous BS activity. This supports the hypothesis that the rabbit's BS can contract independently of the duodenum but that duodenal contraction is usually accompanied by simultaneous contraction of the BS.",

Phasic activity of the spincter may influence bile flow through the choledochoduodenal junction. Natural blood coagulation finally results in the formation of Fibrin, which is one of the most important components of hemostasis in the human organism and thus provides the basis of all reparative procedures that are part of wound healing. It stands to reason to utilize the properties of fibrin for hemostasis during surgery and for joining severed tissue. First attempts of this kind were made at the beginning of this century. But only after greater insight had been gained into the coagulation proc-185 ess and the manufacturing techniques of blood derivatives had become more sophisticated, the essential breakthrough was made. A biological adhesive system has been developed, which consists of highly concentrated fibrinogen, thrombin and clotting factor XIII. This tissue sealant is completely resorbable and of high adhesive property. Further advantages are elasticity of consistence and excellent tissue compatibility.",

            "text": "In conclusion pancreatic blood flow shows a biphasic, concentration-related, response shortly after intoxication. This response appears to be peculiar to the pancreas and does not occur in other viscera. We recently showed that acute ethanol (E) and/or aspirin (A) ingestion increased the permeability of the pancreatic duct to large molecules, this suggested that pancreatic enzymes might leak from the duct into the parenchyma, causing pancreatic disease. This is a new concept in the study ot he pathophysiology of this organ (to be presented at AGA, May, 1982, Plenary Session). In the present experiments wie studied the effects of chronic E/A ingestion on pancreatic function in dogs. Methods: 6 dogs were fitted with duodenal and gastric cannulas. After recovery, baseline secretory sutdies were performed by cannulating the pancreatic duct and collecting pancreatic juice during secretin infusion (0.1 (submax) or 2.0 U/kg-hr. (maximal) IV). At least 2 studies were performed in each dog at each dose. After baseline studies, 3 dogs (Group E) were given daily intragastric ethanol (2 gm/kg-day). 3 dogs (Group A/E) were given E and A (100 mg/kgday). After 36-48 weeks, secretory studies were repeated. Results: All dogs gained weight (x = 1.28 kg). The pancreases appeared normal by light microscopy. Drug treatment increased volume and HCO3 output by 47 and 67%, respectively, in Group E, submax secretin, but decreased them by 29 and 34 % in Group A/E animals. (p=0.0001 vs. predrug values and Group E vs. A/E values). Drug treatment decreased volume and HCO3 output in both Groups by 5-10\u00b0/c (p=0.0001) after maximal secretin stimulus. (Manova test for all statistical analyses). Conclusions: Consumption of E alone increased volume and HCO 3 output after submaximal and decreased them after a maximal secretin stimulus. This confirms the work of Sarles. Consumption of E and A reduced volume an I-ICO3 output after secretin at both doses. Thus chronic A ingestion further impaired pancreatic function in these animals. Since only a small proportion of chronic alcoholics develop clinically significant pancreatic disease, an aggravating \"cofactor\" may be operating in this group. Chronic ASA ingestion, not uncommon in alcoholics, may represent such a cofactor. The development of diabetes mellitus in pancreatic cancer is well known but the standard oral glucose tolerance test is not recognised as a useful diagnostic indicator. Glucose homeostasis, insulin and C-peptide secretion in response to intravenous glucagon were studied prospectively in patients with suspected pancreatic cancer and assessed as to their diagnostic value. 34 fasting patients were given glucagon, 1 m.g., i.v., and serial measurements of blood glucose, plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations made for 60 min. Subsequently it was shown that 12 patients had pancreatic cancer and the remainder constituted a control group. There was not significant difference in the rise in blood glucose between the groups after glucagon. The mean plasma insulin concentrations rose rapidly in both groups peaking between 2 and 5 rain but the values were sginificantly lower in the pancreatic cancer group (P<0.01 at 5 min: P<0.001 at 15 min: P<0.01 at 60 min). A similar pattern was observed with C-peptide. In patients with obstructive jaundice the plasma insulin response was a better discriminator of pancreatic cancer. We conclude that abnormal pancreatic beta cell funktion exists in patients with pancreatic carcinoma, detectable before any change in glucose homeostasis, particularly in patients with obstructive jaundice. The glucagon stimulation test may have a useful role in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. T-suppressor cells (T~) have previously been implicated as mediators of graft surival in baboons tolerant to their renal grafts [1] . In addition, it seems that T-helper cells (Th) are also affected by totallymphoid irradiation in that they are unable to provide help in mitogen-induced T-cell responses or pokeweed mitogen induced immunoglobulin synthesis in Bcells. In this study the evolution of T~ and Th is followed in baboons undergoing graft rejection at different rates. Peripheral blood was collected from the animals at weekly intervals after renal transplantation, defibrinated and the lymphoid cells isolated by flotation on Ficol Hypaque. The T-lymphocyte fraction was purified by filtration through a column packed with nylon wool. Th, Ts and total T-cells were enumerated using monoclonal antibodies OKT4, 8 and 11 respectively (Ortho). The Th/Ts rations reported were taken immediately before a rapid rise in serum creatinine occurred. In longlived baboons who maintained normal creatinine values, a mean of the ratios over the last month was used. B rats are Produced by sublethal (750 Rad) X-irradiation of thymectomized animals, reconstituted with bone marrow from syngeneic, thymectomized, thoracic duct drained donors. In these Lew rats, (Lew x BN)F1 cardiac allografts survice indefinitely (>100 days); unmodified Lew rats acutely reject such allografts (8-+ 1 days). In this study, we have tried to restore the processes of acute rejection in B recipients. Graft survival appeared independent of blocking factors or suppressor cells, as transfer of serum or lymphocytes from B recipients into syngeneic normal animals failed to increase survival of test allografts, placed subsequently. Similarly, immunogenicity of long surviving grafts was unchanged; such grafts functioning >100 days and retransplanted into normal animals were rejected acutely. Adoptive transfer of 108 unseparated spleen cells (SL) from nonimmune syngeneic animals produced slow rejection (28--+5 days) in B rats; 108 sensitized SLwas somewhat more effective (22_+ 1 day). Transfer of 2 x 107 syngeneic peritoneal exudate (PE) cells plus 108 sensitized SL caused acute rejection in 50 % orB recipients (11 _ 1 days), the remainder experiencing rejection at c 3 weeks. PE cells harvested from rats injected ip with thioglycollate 3 days previously, were primarily macrophages/adherent cells, as the cells used were that fraction sticking to plastic dishes and removed with lidocaine (purity >90 %). In vitro, B rat macrophages were abnormal, having only 50 % of capacity of normal macrophages to promote production of interleukin 2 (IL2) when co-cultured with purified T lymphocytes. However, B recipients experienced acute graft rejection (10-+ 1 days) after transfer of 108 sensitized SL plus semipurified IL2, thus bypassing the above defect. Addition oflL2 to the T cell (purity >95\u00b0/0) equivalent of 108 SL (purified over Degalan bead columns coated with rabbit antirat lgG, nonadherent fraction) failed to reestablish acute rejection (17-+7 days), while further addition of B lymphocytes (Degalan bead adherent fraction, purity >90%) or macrophages was uninfluential (16___2 days and 16___3 days, respectively). Transfer of IL-2 alone never produced rejection. Acute rejection can be re-established, however, by increasing the number ofT lymphocytes (108, transferred concomitantly with IL2). Thus, the state of unresponsiveness in B rats can be reversed in vivo by adoptive transfer of particular cellular elements in the presence of growth factors; increased graft survival seems dependent ultimately upon IL-2 production by sensitized T cells, presumably T helper cells. The relative inability of B rat macrophages to promote production of IL-2 by T cells may be primarily responsible for the immunological deficit of the B rat. One of the most intriguing findings ofCyclosporin A (CyA) immunosuppression is that in some species a short course of treatment will produce very prolonged allograft survival. We have tested the ability of CyA to prolong the survival ofvascularized heart, kidney and pancreas allografts by direct comparison in a DA (RT1 a) to LEW (RT1 ~) rat allograft model. Accessory abdominal heart and orthotopic left kidney transplantation were performed using standard microsurgical techniques. In renal transplantation the left kidney was removed at the time of transplantation, the remaining right kidney 5 days thereaf- ter. Streptozotocin-diabetic animals received ductligated pancreas whole organ grafts isolated on the portal vein and a segment of the aorta giving offthe coeliac axis and the superior mesenteric artery. Rejection was taken as complete stop of palpable pulsations in heart transplantation, the day of death in renal transplantation and recurrance of hyperglycemia above 14 mmol/1 in pancreas transplantation, respectively. Cyclosporin A 15 mg/kg body weight, dissolved in olive oil, was administered intramuscularly for 14 days starting with the day of transplantation. In all instances functional demonstration of rejection was confirmed by histological examination. Cyclosporin A is effective to prolong the survival of vascularized heart, kidney and pancreas allografts. While CyA is administered none of the grafts has been rejected. However, following withdrawal of the drug pancreas grafts are rejected within 14 days and heart grafts within 33 days. None of the kidney grafts has been rejected so far.",

The venous allograft still remains an attractive alternative for the reconstruction of small caliber vessels. However, when the venous graft is introduced to a non-histocompatible host, rejection and early occlusion is the rule. This study evaluates the use of Cyclosporin A (CyA) as a graft pretreatment, or systemic immunosuppressant for venous allografts. In addi-tion, cryopreservation techniques for pretreated venous allografts was investigated. 45 adult mongrel dogs, weighing between 12 and 24 kg, were used as recipients for donor jugular vein segments (5-6 cm) which had been excised and flushed with 100 cc of plasma protein fraction (PPF) at 4\u00b0C. These venous allografts were anastamosed end-to-end into a carotid artery of the recipients. The animals were divided into five groups as follows: Group I (n=6) received untreated venous allografts without subsequent immunosuppression, Group II (n = 5) was the same as Group I with minimal immunosuppression (azathioprine 2.5 mg/kg/day). In Group III (n= 10) the animals were transplanted with venous grafts stored in 25 cc of plasma protein fraction (PPF) containing Cy A (50 mg/1) at 4 \u00b0 C for 24 hours, immunosuppression was as in Group II. In Group 1V (n=9) the animals received allografts that had been cryopreserved in a 15% DMSO solution at -196 \u00b0 C for 25-35 days and then the animals had azathioprine as in Group II. In Group V (n= 15) venous allografts recipients were treated with systemic CyA (20 mg/kg/day x 2 weeks, followed by 15 mg/kg/day x 2 weeks) as the only immunosuppression. The patency of the allografts was evaluated at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 weeks post transplantation. Patency results at one month showed that azathioprine alone failed to improve the patency rate (Gr. I and II = 0% patency). CyA graft pretreatment, however, significantly improved the one month patency (Gr. III = 57%). In addition, cryopreservation appeared to enhance the graft pretreatment effect of CyA (Gr. IV; one month patency = 85.7%) of the allografts. Finally, Systemic CyA proved very effective in preventing rejection and occlusion (Gr. V; one month patency = 100 %). Grafts that remained patent for a initial critical period of 4-6 weeks, all showed long term patency. The effect of CyA in preventing graft rejection was further documented by histiological studies of the allografts which showed a marked cellular infiltration and degenerative changes in all the grafts of the control group as compared to minimal or no cell infiltration in the patent grafts of the treatment groups. In summary, it appears that CyA used as a graft pretreatment with minimal immunosuppression of the recipient, in conjunction with cryopreservation or given systemically as the sole immunosuppressant can significantly improve the survival of venous allografts. In our previous reports, it was shown that isolated hepatocytes transplanted into the splenic parenchyma of syngeneic rats, proliferated markedly and recomposed the hepatic tissue. This experimental system provided a new model to elucidate the mechanism of hepatic regeneration which could not be obtained in in vitro cell culture experiments. In the present paper, fetal hepatic tissue instead of isolated adult rat hepatocytes were transplanted into the rat spleen. We document briefly long-term morphological observations on the transplanted fetal hepatic tissue with special reference to proliferation of the hepatocytes and bile ducts. Materials andMethods:Wistar rats were mated in our laboratory for a fetal liver source. Gestation day 0 was when a plug or sperm were observed in the vaginal smear. Fetuses used were of 18 to 20 days gestation. About ten fetal livers which were obtained from one maternal rat, were minced with scissors. The liver fragments were washed three times with saline solution. Transplantation was carried out by direct injection into the spleens of syngeneic adult rats using a 15 gauge needle. Half of the liver fragments obtained from one maternal rat were innoculated into the spleen of one animal. A total of approximately 30 rats with transplanted liver fragments were killed 1, 3, 7, 14 and 30 days and then every two to three months until one year after transplantation. The spleens removed were stained by H.E., PAS and silver nitrate for histological examination. Results: Fetal livers exhibited no lobular architecture or hepatic cord structure. The very sparse cytoplasm of the hepatocytes and many hemopoetic cells among the hepatocytes were characteristically found only in the fetuses. One week after transplantation, the survived hepatocytes revealed almost the same morphological features as in fetal liver except for the presence of several proliferated bile ducts around the hepatocytes. Two weeks later, the hepatocytes formed apparent hepatic cord structures and the extoplasm of each hepatocyte increased abunduntly and became acidophilic as seen in normal neonatal hepatocytes. Hemopoetic cells disappeared. Four weeks later, hepatocytes began to proliferate sporadically among the markedly proliferated bile ducts, Groups of survived hepatocytes with cord structure were very similar to a neonatal liver except for the lack of the Glisson's area. Two or three months later, proliferation of the hepatocytes became prominent. There seemed to be no interrelationship between proliferated hepatocytes and bile ducts. One year after transplantation, a white nodule was observed on the spleen macroscopically and it consisted of numerous bile ducts and hepatocytes with or without cord structure on histology. Summary: 1. Fetal hepatocytes transplanted into the spleen, differentiated to almost normal neonatal hepatocytes two weeks after transplantation. 2.",

            "text": "Hepatocytes began to proliferate about 4 weeks after transplantation. 3. Three days after transplantation, proliferation of bile ducts was already observed independent of the transplanted hepatic tissue. 4. When comparing the difference in proliferation between fetal hepatic tissue and isolated hepatocyte transplantation, marked proliferation of the bile ducts in fetal hepatic tissue was observed and fetal hepatocytes proliferated more rapidly, while there were no proliferated bile ducts in isolated hepatocyte transplantation. Pretransplant splenectomy (Sx) has been of disputed benefit since its introduction two decades ago. 220 of 315 patients with first cadaver transplants treated at our institution between Dec. 1968 and Dec. 1981 have had pretransplant Sx. At six monts, Sx patients had 10% better kidney survival, but this benefit was lost shortly after 1 year and by 5 and 10 years was 10% and 15% worse in Sx patients. Patient survival for Sx and no Sx was identical for the first year but was 10% and 20% worse by 5 and 10 years respectively in Sx patients. Thus, the early improvement in kidney survival was more than offset by a late high mortality. A rational basis for selecting patients who might benefit most from pretansplant splenectomy is urgently needed. Since July, 1978, 34 patients ages 16-45 have received first cadaver transplants after having been tested for reactivity to DNCB. Nine of 20 DNCB negative patients had splenectomy as did 6 of 14 DNCB positive patients. Kidney survival at 1 year for DNCB negative patients without Sx was 79%; for DNCB negative with Sx, 29%; for DNCB positive without Sx, 21%; for DNCB positive with Sx, 62%. Rejection was the sole cause for kidneyloss in DNCB positive patients without Sx. However, 5 of 9 DNCB negative patients with splenectomy died, primarily of septic complications. Since 1978 survival of Sx patients has been 60% compared to 95% in non Sx patients (p<0.04). Sx appears to be beneficial in DNCB positive patients but has an adverse effect in DNCB negative patients because of an increased susceptibility to fatal infections. Prior blood transfusion improves renal graft survival [1] . Plasma from uraemic patients suppresses the in vitro responses of normal lymphocytes to antigen (plasma suppressive activity, PSA) and this effect is mainly attributable to the plasma protein macroglobulin (a2M) [2] . The aims of the present study were: a) to identify changes in PSA and a2M concentration in uraemic subjects following primary blood transfusion. b) to correlate the PSA of transfused renal transplant recipients with subsequent graft survival. a) Ten potential transplant recipients were studied before and after their first blood transfusion. Following blood transfusions the PSA increased significantly (p<0.01) reaching a maximum at two months. There was no significant change in the plasma a2M concentration over the same period.",

However, the incidence of uncontrolled local disease at death was higher in the WP group overall. Stress as well as dietary fatty acids have been shown to prolong allograft survival in rats [1] . Poly unsaturated fatty acids (linoleic acid, arachnoidic acid) have been reported to depress immune response [2] . Depressed immune response was suggested to correlate with a higher incidence of spontaneous tumor [3] as well as with an increased growth rate of inoculated tumors [4] . The objective of this study was to elucidate the effect of two environmental factors i.e. chronic stress (change in light/dark pattern) and diets low and high in linoleic acid on immune response and growth of transplantable tumors in BN rats. Immune response: Four experimental groups (n >10) were used in immune response studies. Group I: high linoleic acid dietl; group I1: low linoleic diet 2, group III: L/D shift weekly, normal diet and group IV: controls on normal diet, normal lighting. Seven weeks after the start of the experiment the immune response was measured. The results showed that corticosterone levels were slightly increased in all experimental groups, although only the high linoleic group showed statistic significant difference with the control group. Cellular immune response (Con A stimulation and Popliteal Node Assay) was decreased in all experimental groups compaired to controls. Transplantable tumors: 1 x 106 leukemia cells were injected i.v. and pieces of 1 mm 3 of an spontaneous adrenal cortical carcinoma, a urethral squamous cell carcinoma and a round cell cervix sarcoma were implanted subcutaneously. All tumors were inoculated in groups of 10 animals each. Spleen weight as a measure of leukemia growth was high in the control group and low in the experimental group. The same pattern was seen in the growth of the subcutaneously implanted adrenal cortical carcinomas. Both the urethral squamous cell carcinoma and the round cell cervix sarcoma, being non-immunogenic, did not show any difference in growth. So far, it can be concluded, that the immunosuppression as induced by mild chronic stress or dietary fatty acids does not lead to enhanced tumor growth. In contrary, the results of both leukemia and adrenal cortical carcinoma show a possible reserve effect. Little is known of the derivation or content of human breast cysts. Recent reports have shown wide variations in the content of steroid hormones, particularly dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHAS) [1, 2] . No explanation for this is apparent. To confirm the large variation in DHAS concentrations and to further define the contents of cyst fluids, 100 cysts from 85 patients have been analysed for DHAS, sodium and potassium. DHAS concentrations ranged from 1.5-1155 pmol/1. Both sodium and potassium content also varied widely (sodium 30-200 pmol/1 and potassium 3-158 ~umol/1). There was a significant direct correlation between the content of potassium and DHAS in cyst fluid (p<0.001) and a significant negative correlation with sodium content (/7<0.001). Three separate subpopulations of cysts could be identified according to the sodium and potassium content and these were, predominantly potassium cysts (47), predominantly sodium cysts (44) and mixed cationic cysts (9). The median DHAS concentration of the potassium cysts was 215 pmol/1 similar to the levels found in human breast secretions [3]. In contrast the median concentration of DHAS in the predominantly sodium cysts was 14 pmol/1 and significantly different (p<0.0005), with many of these cysts having DHAS concentrations in the same range as those found in plasma. The remaining mixed cysts had a median DHAS concentration intermediate between the two main groups. It may be that the variation in cationic content and DHAS concentration in these two major subpopula-tions of human breast cysts represents either, derivation from two different sources, namely breast secretions and plasma or marked differences in the secretory activity of the epithelium lining these two groups of cysts. There is no uniform agreement on the correct management of patients with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). It is widely considered that in ILC there is an increased risk of developing a contra-lateral carcinoma and the major controversy surrounds the management of the second breast. The survival of patients with ILC was significantly better than that of IDC fp<:0.025). SIX patients had bilateral carcinomata at diagnosis and a further 14 developed a contra-lateral carcinoma during the period of follow-up (10 to 21 years). Survival data showed poor survival for patients with simultaneous bilateral disease, but no difference in survival for patients with metachronous bilateral or unilateral disease. This suggests that the later development of a second carcinoma does not necessarily reduce the probability of survival for patients with ILC.",

Vascular endoscopy could be one of the invaluable methods to examine, diagnose and treat the patients requiring aortic, caval and other major vascular surgery. (3) produced endothelial injury and a local increase in shear stress in 14 cynomolgus monkeys by suture plicating and constricting the aorta and then feeding an atherogenic diet for 6 months. Our findings reveal that carotid plaques localize on the outer wall of the internal carotid (plaque thickness 0.7--+0.1 mm) which is an area of low flow velocity ( -4___ 1 cm/s at RE 800) and shear stress (0-+2 dynes/cm 2) and not at the flow divider (thickness 0.1___0.1 mm, p<0.01) which is an area of high flow velocity (81---3 cm/s) and shear (161-+48 dynes/cm2). Distal to the carotid bulb, velocity and shear increased on the outer wall and little or no plaque was observed. In experimental coarctations, no endothelial damage was observed (SEM and TEM) within the high-shear coarct channel and the channel was noted to be free ofatherosclerotic plaque despite the development of extensive diet-induced lesions proximally and distally. Thus, high flow velocity and shear stress do not appear to produce endothelial damage in vivo. In addition, plaques were minimal in high shear areas in the human carotid bifurcation and high shear appears to have an inhibitory effect on experimental plaque formation. These data contradict previous investigations implicating high shear stress in plaque pathogenesis. In contrast, host aortic endothelium (AE) fails to cover large VP by pannus ingrowth even over much longer times. To see if IAES succeeds because of inherent differences in growth potential between AE and VE, we used AE to seed 8 cm x 6 mm diameter Dacron velour infrarenal VP in dogs. An average of 4 x 105 cells obtained by trypsin/collagenase digestion of the bypassed aortic segment was used to seed each VP by a 4 step preclotting method. The identity of AE was confirmed by stains for Factor VIII antigen. Viability of seeded AE was verified by growth of subaliquots in tissue culture. Six weeks after surgery central segments of AEseeded (n = 9) and control unseeded (n = 9) VP were compared by light and scanning electron microscopy using an endothelial coverage score range of -1 (for fibrin/platelet thrombi) to +1 (for confluent endothelial coverage). AE-seeded VP had a score of+0.89 ___ 0.33 (mean___ SD) versus. -0.67___ 0.70 for controls (P<0.001). In addition to endothelial coverage, the subluminal smooth muscle and intramural vasa vasorum previously reported in VE-seeded VP were also seen in AE-seeded VP. Since AE and VE seeding give identical results, the success of IAES with VE cannot be due to inherent biological differences in mitotic potential between AE and VE. IAES must instead achieve additional endothelial growth either through a) the action of the proteolytic enzymes used for cell harvest or b) mitogenic stimuli to nonconfluent cells at the edges of seeded cell clusters on the VP. Further improvement of the efficiency of IAES to allow use of less harvested vein per cm 2 of VP should come from enhancing one or both of these effects. Pyrolytic carbon is a crystalline form of carbon that has been extensively used in the construction of cardiac and bone prostheses. Since it has also been suggested that pyrolytic carbon will prevent thrombosis from occuring in vascular prostheses, the aim of the present study performed in dogs was to test the immediate blood compatibility of this material and to evaluate its biocompatibility when inserted as vascular substitute. After pryolysis of a gazeous hydrocarbon, the carbone crystalite was deposited on a knitted textile surface or tube. Its surface examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was rough and porous to a depth of 40p. This material was tested 1 \u00b0) for immediate hemocompatibility as inserts within the vascular lumen (aorta and inferior vena cava). The specimens were examined sequentially by SEM and histology at 10, 20, 30, 180 s and 10 min after reestablishment of the blood flow, 2 \u00b0 ) for long term biocompatibility as vascular cylinders (7 mm ID) inserted either in the aorta or inferior vena cava or as intraatrial (left or right) implants.",

Platelet aggregates of limited extent were only observed on intravenous implants. Plasmatic protein deposition, an early event on polymeric vascular material was not observed. After 30 s a fibrino-erythrocytic membrane recovers completely the material. Except in the case of intravenous insert, no thrombosis developed at the contact of intraarterial or intracardiac implant. After 15 days it was completely recovered by a 5-7 fibrocellular layer consisting of large myofibroblasts with microfilaments, newly synthetized collagen and elastin. The blood interface was of fibrous nature. At one month by SEM, endotheliallike cells developed in a mosaic-like pattern, characterized by transmission E.M., by microvillous projections, numerous pinocytic vesicles and intercellular tight junctions. This endothelial-like cell lining was complete 2 months after implantation. Their immunocytochemical properties are now under investigation using specific anti-dog Factor VIII-RAG sera.

Therefore, we have investigated the strength and extensibility of rat skin wounds at different levels (superficial-deep) of the epidermis (0.03 mm), dermis (1.8-2.2 mm) and m. panniculus carneous (0.6-1.5 mm), average thickness is indicated. 10, 20 and 60 day old standardized skin wounds from the dorsal region of rats have been used.

Simultaneously, the strips were transluminated and the breaking pattern was studied by taking photographs of the wound specimens during the mechanical testing (30-35 photographs of each specimen). The photographs were marked on the load-strain curve by means of a connection between camera and x-y-recorder. From the load-strain curves the maximum load and the failure energy were calculated.",

A new method for testing the mechanical properties of the tissue of incision wounds at various levels (superficial-deep) is presented. The superficial layer of an incision wound contributes a major part of the strength of the wound and is more extensible than the deep layers. These results may explain the clinical observations. The effect on wound healing of different kinds of vitamins is worth investigating, since the efficiency of Vitamin C has been dearly demonstrated. The possible action of Vitamin Bs-whose trophic effect on skin is well known -has been experimentally studied on skin and aponeurosis healing after a standard laparotomy. Materials and Methods: Experiments were carried out on 42 five months old rabbits which were randomly divided into three groups: in group I, 18 animals served as controls (3 animals in sequence of 5 days from the 5th to the 30th post-operative day), group II, 12 animals injected with Vit B5 (25 mg/kg of body weight/24 h) and group III, 12 animals injected with a placebo (2 animals in sequence of 5 days for each group). In each case four samples were tested of skin and aponeurosis for determinating tensile strength, directly recorded with an original technic [1] : this new apparatus allowed us to obtain simultaneously two dynamic parameters, the healing tensile strength and stretching of the scar. Results: 1. No significant difference was found between controls (Group I) and the placebo group (Group III) both for resistance of skin and the aponeurosis. 2. As far as Vitamin B5 treated animals were concerned (Group II) there was no significant difference regarding skin resistance when compared with the other two groups. 3. Inversely aponeurosis resistance become significantly greater when measured on the 20th (p<0.050), 25th (/r<0.025) and 30th (p<0.050) post-operative day. In 17 mongrel dogs (7x 15 cm cranial based rectus abdominis) MC and corresponding RP flaps were raised. In group I (9 dogs) skin BF was determined from the clearance curve for ~33Xenon injected intradermally and measured with a computer-linked gamma camera. In group II (8 dogs) subcutaneous PrO2 was determined by a recently developed method using a silastic tonometer, subcutaneously implanted. The PrO 2 inside the tonometer was measured in infused saline, by a platinum oxygen needle electrode and a silver/silver Chloride reference electrode. B F and PtO2 were measured before and after the flaps were raised and on postoperative days (POD) 1, 3, 6 and 15. PtO2 were taken at 6 various inspiratoric oxygen levels (F~O2) ranging from 21% (air) to 100 % oxygen. Intact areas lateral to the flaps and in flap regions prior to surgery served as controls. Immediately after surgery BF in the MC increased while in the RP flaps was 24 %, 23 % and 31% of the flow in the MC flaps, in lateral intact area and in the preoperative areas (P<0.001). During POD 1-2 BF in the RP flaps increased to the preoperative level, but not to the increased levels found in the MC flaps and the lateral intact areas. By POD 6 there were no differences in BF between the two types of flaps and the lateral areas, but all were higher than corresponding preoperative values (/'<0.005). Tissue oxygen tension showed a dramatic fall POD 1, 3 and 6 in the RP flaps for all FIO2, and for all days the values were lower than the preoperative level (P<0.001). One RP developed POD 3 distal necrosis and the PrO 2 was then 0 even with a FIO2 of 100%. The MC flap showed an increased PrO2 on the operative day but at POD 3 the values were slightly lower than the preoperative level, but POD 1, 3 and 6 the values for all FIO2 were higher than for RP flaps (P<0,005). At POD 15 the PrO2 reached preoperative level for RP as well as MC flaps. Lateral intact areas showed comparable changes to that observed in the MC flaps.",

Normal volunteers and patients with angiographically documented arterial occlusions were studied in a 101/4\" bore Oxford Research Systems TMR-32 spectrometer at rest and after exercising each limb separately. Normal resting values ofPCr/P iwere >10 and the NMR Index = P/(P~+PCr) was 0.07_+0.03 (S.D.). Limbs with femoral arterial occlusions whose ankle systolic pressure index was <0.5 had NMR Index which was significantly elevated above norreals (0.18 + 0.09p<0.01) indicating a failure of metabolic compensation for reduced bloodflow and oxygen delivery, although ATP concentration was norreal. Exercise produced a five-fold rise in NMR Index in both normal and diseased legs. Spectra were taken over one minute intervals during the recovery period and in normal limbs returned to resting values within 2 rain. The recovery period was considerably slower in the diseased limbs indicating abnormal mitochondrial oxygen delivery and impaired mitochondrial formation of ATP. These data demonstrate the feasibility of using 31PNMR to non-invasively probe the biochemical abnormalities of energy metabolism in patients with peripheral vascular disease. The incidence of urinary calculous disease (UCD) in the South African Black population is very low in comparison with the White population group. No biochemical differences in serum nor urine account for this discrepancy and no other measurable parameters have demonstrated any difference between the two groups. Urinary particulate activity measurements have demonstrated differences between normal persons and those with UCD who are otherwise biochemically similar, and it would therefore seem rational to expect such measurements to demonstrate differences between the two population groups. Urinary particulate activity was measured in the urin of 100 normal Whites and 100 normal Blacks, the two groups being matched for age, height and weight, and monitored under normal dietary hydrational and environmental conditions. The three parameters of particulate nucleation, growth and aggregation were measured and the two groups compared.",

The usual reciprocal relationship between glucose and ketone utilisation during feeding and fasting has not been demonstrated~in sepsis. Preliminary experiments in a hindlimb model support the hypothesis 201 that during infection amino acid release from muscle is not affected by ketone levels. We have developed a technique for measuring the total body carbon of the living subject which is suitable for measuring the critically-ill as well as the ambulatory patient. By combining this measurement with that of total body nitrogen and calcium [1] an estimate of total body fat is derived. Measurement at the beginning and end of a given period enables the changes in total body protein and fat to be obtained, as well as the patient's energy expenditure if energy intake is also known. The method is a radiation technique. The supine patient is irradiated laterally with a horizontal beam of fast neutrons and the resulting gamma rays from the body are detected by a radiation detector placed unterneath the subject. The nuclear reaction employed is the inelastic scattering of fast neutrons by the carbon nuclei of the body with the emitted gamma rays having an energy of 4.43MeVI In the initial application, measures of total body fat obtained using the technique were compared with those derived from skinfold thicknesses in six volunteers: there was no significant differences between the two measurements, (see table) . The method is being employed in studying the changes in total body protein and fat, and the energy requirements of surgical patients receiving nutrition. In order to investigate the mechanism of this effect, normal monocytes were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min (with intralipid 40/A/ml) and their function assessed by three different techniques (chemotaxis, phagocytosis and chemiluminescence). All three methods showed impairment of function following exposure to intralipid. In order to try and prevent this potentially damaging effect, heparin was added to the various in vitro tests and found to cause marked impairment of phagocytosis. (P<0.01) To assess its effect in vivo, 11 volunteers were given 5,000 units of subcutaneous heparin 2 h prior to intravenous intralipid (as above). Although the use of heparin did not affect either immunological function, it completely prevented the fall of monocyte chemotaxis following intralipid alone. These findings suggest that monocyte function may be impaired by the presence ofintracellular lipid particles. The use of S.C. heparin may help to alleviate this problem and could, therefore, be beneficial to ill and often septic patients requiring intravenous nutrition. To investigate the effect of elevated glucocorticoids of stress and trauma on peripheral glutamine metabolism, 0.44 mg/kg BW Dexamethasone was injected daily intramuscularely in adult mongroel dogs over a period of 2 weeks. At least 3 weeks prior to the experiments catheters were placed into the animal's abdominal aorta (2) and caval vein (1) in order to measure A-V differences and hindquarter blood flow. During Dexamethasone treatment nitrogen balances were negative, -7.1-4-1 g N per day, whereas slightly positive N-balances were observed during the control period (3.1 +__ 1.7 g N/day). Muscle glutarnine concentrations declined constantly from 22.1 +2.3 mmol/1 intracellular water to 10.0-4-1.2 by 56% within two weeks. Whole blood arterial and venous plasma concentrations remained constant. To test the hypothesis of increased peripheral glutamine utilisation or decreased glutamine formation, the activities of Glutaminase and Glutamine Synthetase were measured in a muscle homogenate obtained before and 8 days after Dexamethasone treatment. Both enzyme activities were found to be unchanged. Hindquarter glutamine efflux increased from 20.3+22.6 pmol/min in the control state to 80.0+24.1 during Dexamethasone treatment indicating a 4 fold muscle glutamine output. This increased glutamine output was enirely due to increased A-V differences and despite decreased hindquaarter blood flow during Dexamethasone. It is concluded that Dexamethasone reproduces the metabolic response of trauma and sepsis in terms of negative nitrogen balance and muscle glutamine depletion. Muscle glutamine is shifted from peripheral tissues to visceral organs with muscle compensating for visceral demands rather than skeletal muscle being the primary target of corticoid action. It has been suggested that there is abnormal glucose utilisation in malnourished patients and that this may explain the adverse clinical sequelae of high rates of glucose infusion during intravenous feeding. We have investigated the hypothesis that there is a depression of the key enzymes of glucose oxidation in the muscle of malnourished patients which is due to an alteration of muscle fibre type proportions. 14 malnourished patients (P) (9M,5F 56+12 yrs) Our results demonstrate that there is a positive correlation between preoperative CP and stage of cancer 0' =34.4+-3.88x; r=0.62;/9<0.001). Nevertheless before surgery there is no difference between CP values in the two groups considered (g.c.= 46.2___9.7 mg %;p.u. =44.4----9.0 mg%), but after surgical trauma CP presents a positive response in patients with p.u. (mean increase +14.9 %), whereas it acts as a negative AP protein in g.c. patients (mean decrease 5-60/0) (P<0.02). Moreover malnourished g.c. patients present a reduction of CP values ( -10 %) which is greater than g.c. patients with albumin >3.5 g% ( -1.5%); this difference is not statistically significant. Cancer patients undergoing palliative (n=10) or radical surgical procedure (n=31) show parallel decrease of preoperative CP ( -6%), the first group presenting higher preoperative values in relation to the tumor diffusion.",

This study reveals decreased concentrations of nearly all AA in liver tissue of septic patients (exception: Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, Cystathionine). 2. The significantly decreased concentrations of the gluconeogenetic AA (Thr, Ser, Ala) indicate that the gluconeogenetic capacity of the liver is not exhausted through an increased uptake of those AA as shown earlier by Wilmore et al.

The principle factors precipitating postoperative multiple organ failure were sepsis, hypotension and injury to the liver. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that hepatic failure, which has a high mortality rate, is linked to the marked decrease in energy charge. In order to evaluate the possible presence of metabolic blocks, the changes in the ratio of acetoacetate to fl-hydroxybutyrate (ketone body ratio), which reflects the hepatic mitochondrial redox potential, were analyzed in relation to energy charge in hepatectomized, jaundiced, hemorrhagic-shokked and septic animals, as well as patients with postoperative multiple organ failure. Experimental: 1. In hepatectomized rabbits, mitochondrial phosphorylative activity increased to 170 % of the control and the energy charge level decreased from the normal level of 0.87 to 0.76 at 24 h after hepatectomy (/7<0.001). Afterward, these values returned to preoperative levels within a week. The ketone body ratio in arterial blood was positively correlated with hepatic energy charge (r=0.696, p~0.01).",

The hepatic energy charge fell from 0.87 to 0.73 at 48 h postoperatively with a maximum incidence of mortality. Moreover, changes in the blood ketone body ratio were positively correlated with the hepatic energy charge (r= 0.844,/~0.01). The decrease in the blood ketone body ratio was attributed to the restricted mitochondrial reoxidation of NADH due to an inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. 3. In hemorrhagic-shocked rabbit with a mean arterial blood pressure of 40mmHg, the changes in the blood ketone body ratio were correlated with hepatic energy charge (r=0.772, p<0.01). 4. In septic pigs subjected to the ligation and perforation of the cecum, the hepatic energy charge level decreased gradually from 0.86 to 0.80 and the mitochondrial phosphorylative activity was enhanced to 150% of controls in the hyperdynamic state. In the hypodynamic state, the hepatic energy charge level fell drastically 0.69 concomitant with the decrease in mitochondrial phosphorylative activity and blood ketone body ratio. From these results, the blood ketone body ratio may be regarded as a reliable indicator for assessing the degree of decreased energy charge. Clinical: Changes in the blood ketone body ratio were measured in 55 patients who underwent major surgery such as hepatectomy. These patients were classified into 4 groups according to the postoperative changes in blood ketone body ratio: Group A without decrease to below 0.7, Group B with transient decrease to 0.4, Group C with progressive decrease to below 0.4 and Group D with terminal decrease to below 0.25. All 35 Group A and B patients tolerated the operation well. By contrast, the 20 Group C patients showed multiple organ failure with 85 % mortality rate, which involved pulmonary failure (70%), hepatic failure (70%), gastrointestinal bleeding (30%), renal failure (600/0), cerebral failure (70%) and coagulopathy (65%). All patients who transitioned to the terminal stage of Group D died of cardiogenic decompensation. In 5 patients of Group C, the decreased blood ketone body ratio was restored with the amelioration of clinical symptoms after ex vivo pig or baboon liver crosshemodialysis and 3 patients of them were later discharged. Evidence presented indicates that the decreased blood ketone body ratio has a direct bearing on multiple organ failure.",

Although two patients showed immediate, marked improvement in mentation, all three died of intraabdominal hemorrhage in the first few postoperative days in spite of prolonged attempts to achieve hemostasis and maximum blood product support. Three conclusions can be drawn from this limited experience: 1. Total shunt procedures which are anatomically suitable for subsequent conversion to a selective configuration or for hepatic limb arterialization should be favored over those not offering such potential; 2. at a time of election, restoration of hepatopedal portal flow can be accomplished in patients with side-to-side portacaval or hemodynamically equivalent shunts with considerable benefit; and 3. similar procedures in patients with fulminant liver failure are unlikely to succeed. Peritoneal-venous (LeVeen) shunts are associated with a significant incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (D.I.C.). This study identifies a site of origin, a pathogenic mechanism, and the hemostatic pathway which accounts for the thrombogenicity of human ascites. 500 ml of peritoneal fluid were removed percutaneously from individuals with malignant and cirrhotic ascites. Ficoll-Hypaque column chromatography and ultracentrifugation were utilized to prepare four fractions: cellular; a low speed cell-free fluid; a high speed supernatant; and the precipitate from the high speed centrifugation. The cellular fraction from both types demonstrated an ability to shorten a one stage clotting time by 60 % relative to saline and endotoxin controls. Similarly, low speed cell-free fluid shortened the clotting time of pooled normal plasma by 61%; was also effective in factor VIII (required for intrinsic pathway of coagulation) deficient plasma; but had no effect on factor VII (required for extrinsic pathway of coagulation) deficient plasma or platelet aggregation and release. The high speed supernatant was demonstrably less thrombogenic. The resuspended precipitate shortened the clotting time of pooled normal plasman by 67 % and of factor VIII deficient plasma from infinity to 99 s. In contrast, this material was ineffective on factor VII deficient plasma. We conclude that the thrombotic potential of human ascites derives from peritoneal cells, either leucocytes or malignant cells. Consistently, the thrombotic factor exists in suspension and is thromboplastin-like in its behavior, operating through the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. Thus, a site of origin and a pathway of activity for the thrombotic agent in human ascites is identified.",

The optimum method of restoring the ability to swallow in patients with unresectable carcinoma of the oesophagus remains controversial. This study evaluates the palliative potential of pulsion intubation versus retrostemal gastric bypass of the excluded oesophagus in unresectable carcinoma of the upper thoracic segment (20-32 cm from the incisor teeth). Patients and Methods: 71 patients were prospectively randomised for treatment by pulsion intubation (37 patients) or gastric bypass (34 patients). Non-resectability was indicated by (1) tumour lengths greater than 6 cm, (2) tracheal or bronchial invasion, (3) disrant dissemination, (4) mediastinal invasion. The operative mortality, morbidity, palliation of dysphagia and postoperative nutritional status was compared in the two groups. Results: Mortality: Intubation resulted in 2 deaths, a mortality rate of 5,4%. Gastric bypass resulted in 3 deaths, a mortality rate of 8,8 %. Complications: Intubation was complicated by respiratory infection (8), tube migration (1), respiratory obstruction (1), oesophageal perforation (1), bleeding (1). Gastric bypass was complicated by chest infection (9), pneumothorax (3), wound infection (5), subphrenic abscess (1), anastomotic leak (4), pulmonary embolism (1), purulent neck discharge (3). Ability to swallow: Palliation of dysphagia was achieved in 92 % of patients following intubation and 91% of patients following bypass. Postoperative nutritional status: Improvement in nutritional status was more rapid following intubation. Conclusion: Pulsion intubation is the preferred palliative procedure because of fewer complications and lesser degree of postoperative catabolism. The current technique for investigating the response of vascular prosthetic materials to infection is by challenge with a sub-lethal dose of bacteria, usually an intravenous infusion of 108 organisms in an animal model. This large bacterial innoculum, however, obscures any difference in the infectibility of prostheses that may be inherent in the material, its incorporation into host tissues, or its resistance to infection. We have developed a sensitive method for determining the susceptibility to infection of vascular prostheses based on calculation of the number of bacteria required to infect a specific prosthesis in 50% of trials (IDs0). Following implantation of the prosthesis to be tested in the canine infra-renal aorta, a dose-response curve was generated by the intravenous injection of known innocula of S. aureus (at log intervals from 102 to 108 bacteria). At six weeks the prosthesis was harvested and cultured to document infection with S. aureus. A characteristic sigmoid curve resulted from which the IDs0 was determined. To test this method, a comparison was made between commercial human umbilical vein grafts (HUVG) and HUVG impregnated with silver sulfadiazine in 35 dogs. Although both prostheses were infected by the standard 108 innoculum, a greater than tenfold increase in the resistance to infection by the treated HUVG (<102 to 101) was demonstrated in the dose-response curves. Since the number of bacteria in a postimplant bacteremia rarely exceeds 102 organisms/ml, such differences in infectibility are clinically significant. IDs0 determination provides a sensitive, reproducible method for quantitating resistance to infection in vascular protheses. Prosthetic infection following reconstructive vascular operations is an infrequent but often fatal complication which generally persists until the graft is removed. It is accepted that infection arises from operative contamination, bacteraemic seeding and abscesses or viscus eroding into the graft. This study investigates the role played by distal sepsis on groin grafts.",

Carcinoma as an indication for operation and preoperative malnutrition are considered to be high risk factors. The subject of this study was to measure the influence of malignant tumor growth at a distant site on woundhealing in colon and skin, and to find a correlation between the influence of the nutritional state of the experimental animal, and the influence of malignant tumorgrowth on woundhealing. We also tried to find ways to compensate the possible unfavourable influence a malignant tumor might have on woundhealing. The study was performed in rats, the tumor used was a rhabdomyosarcoma, transplanted subcutaneously in the rats right flank. Parameters for woundhealing were tensile strength of the skin-incision, and bursting pressure of a colonic anastomosis. Six groups of rats were studied, each rat undergoing a standardized colonic operation after two or four weeks. The groups consisted of: control animals (20); tumorbearing animals (20), without tumor removal; malnutrltioned animals (20); tumorbearing animals receiving intravenous hyperalimentation (20), without tumor removal; animals undergoing tumor removal and colonic operation in one session (10); animals undergoing the colonic operation two weeks after tumor removal (10). Woundhealing was negatively influenced in an early stage of tumorgrowth (F<0.05). Four weeks of tumor growth did not impair woundhealing to a greater degree than two weeks. Laboratory determinations showed no deviations. Malnutrition, leading to less weight gain than in control and tumor bearing animals took much longer to influence woundhealing than tumor pearing. This is in accordance with publications by Irvin and Hunt (1974), Devereux et al (1979) and Garattini and Guaitani (1981) , which led us to the conclusion that the negative effect of tumor bearing on woundhealing was not solely the result of anorexia. Hyperalimentation in tumorbearing rats resulted in undisturbed woundhealing, despite the fact that hyperalimentation as practised by us (with amino-acids and carbohydrates) stimulated tumorgrowth. We concluded from these experiments that tumorgrowth caused a metabolic chaos in the animal, which in turn led to a disturbance in woundhealing. Intravenous hyperalimentation could apparently compensate this. Woundhealing in rats operated in one session was significantly more disturbed than woundhealing in rats operated in one session was significantly more disturbed than woundhealing in rats operated in two sessions (p<0.05). Irvin an Hunt (1974) have demonstrated however that extraabdominal trauma had no influence on colonic healing. This led to the conclusion that the diminished woundhealing found in rats operated in one session was an effect of the tumor. Obviously this influence is not instantly removed with tumor excision. This study offers a theoretical foundation for the clinical observation that in operations for colonic carcinoma with a substantial operative trauma, the anastomosis needs extra protection and/or needs to be performed in a second session. The aorta of the Blotchy mouse undergoes dilatation during adult life, resulting in the formation of fusiform aortic aneurysms. The mutation is X-linked, so only the males are affected. We have found a shift in the fluorescent spectrum of insoluble, hydrolyzed, dermal collagen in these mice; suggesting the presence of an abnormal crosslinkage compound. The purpose of this report is to describe additional studies carried out on the soluble collagen fraction in these animals, which lend support to the hypothesis of a crosslinkage abnormality.",

In this study we determined the critical ischemic time for the development of an arrhythmogenic potential. EGG and bipolar electrograms were recorded from the His bundle, ventricular endocardium and epicardium in twelve anesthetized dogs. Short bursts ofventricular pacing (3 beats; 240-420 beats/min) were used to induce ventricular arrhythmias before and after lidocaine administration (2, 4, 6 mg/kg). Previously, lidocaine has been shown to exacerbate conduction delay in ischemic myocardium leading to reentrant ventricular arrhythmias. In the control state, ventricular pacing with or without lidocaine induced either no response or single or repetitive ventricular responses. Sustained ventricular tachycardia was never evoked in the control studies. In six dogs, after 20 min of left anterior descending coronary artery ligation and reperfusion, ventricular pacing with and without lidocaine produced sustained ventricular tachycardia in one animal. In another six dogs, after 30 rain ofligation and reperfusion, one dog showed sustained vertricular tachycardia in response to ventricular pacing alone. The other 5 showed sustaine~l vertricular tachycardia after ventricular pacing with lidocaine. Sustained ventricular tachycardia averaged 400/min and degenerated into ventricular fibrillation within 1-2 rain. In conclusion 20-30 min of ischemia appears to be the critical period for development of malignant arrhythmogenic potential in the canine heart. Administration of lidocaine during this critical period enhances the inducibility of cardiac arrhythmias, which may have clinical relevance in the management of acute myocardial infarction. Untreated coronary artery air embolism in the experiments without ECC (group I) resulted in a transmural myocardial ischemia with a mortality rate of 28 % In contrast there were no death in the experiment when extracorporeal circulation was used (group II to V). The best therapeutic effect with regard to the reversibility of temporary myocard ischemia following coronary artery air embolism was achieved by increasc of the postembolic perfusion pressure (group V), a finding being significantly different (p<0.05) to groups I through IV. Also volume depletion of the left ventricle on ECC (group II) resulted in a faster regression of the left ventricular hypothermic area compared to group I (p<:0.05). The application of Dipyridamole (group III) and St.Thomas cardioplegic solution (group IV) was not able to produce a significant therapeutic effect.",

To transfer these experimental findings into clinical application is suggested because of its practicability and convenience. Transmural biopsies were obtained before and 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 min after ACC for biochemical and structural analysis. Myocardial temperature (T) ph (MpH), and pCO2) were measured continously with a thermistor, a new pH electrode, and a mass spectrometer respectively. In Group I (n=8) ACC was under normothermia. In Group II mean T was reduced to 19\u00b0C by the administration of cold potassium cardioplegia immediately after ACC and consecutively every 30 min. MpH at the end of ACC reached 5.39-t-0.08 Group I) and 6.49___0.13 (Group II) (/7<0.001); PmCO2 rose from 41___4 to 234_+13 mmHg in Group I and did not change in Group II. Tissue content of ATP decreases by 51% Group I) and by 14\u00b0/0 (Group II) (F<0.001); tissue creatine phosphate fell by 98 % (Group I) and by 48 % (Group II) (p<0.001). Changes in ATP and creatine phosphate as well as in tissue glucose and glycogen related ton concomitant changes in pH. The degree of ischemic damage assessed histologically by a mean ischemic score was 2.5+--0.06 in Group I and 0.75_+ 0.19 in Grup II (p<0.01). Irreversible structural demage assessed by electron microscopy occurred in Group I 60-90 min after ACC and was associated with a MpH below 6.2. No such damage was observed in Group II. We conclude: 1. irreversible damage during normothermic arrest occurs considerably later than has been reported for regional ischemia in the beating heart; 2. during 2 h of ACC cold potassium cardioplegia does not completely protect against ID when mean T is 19\u00b0C; and 3. on-line oaeasurement of MpH reflects the inadequacy of' MP more accurately than do either PmCO2 or T and thus, provides a useful potential method for intraoperative monitoring of MP.

Measured osmolality varied from 305 to 500 mosmol/kg.

Eight dogs had two hours of MI after perfusion with 200 ml CB containing K, 30 meq/L and D, 200/zg/kg. Six dogs received the same treatment as the previous group except that D was increased to 1600/zg/kg for all four perfusions. Baseline studies were repeated after 60 min ofreperfusion without the use of Ca ~ or inotropic agents. Heart rate, peak systolic pressure, Vc\u00a2, V~,~x, peak + dp/dt, peak -dp/dt, dp/dt over common peak isovolumic pressure, left ventricular compliance, stiffness and elasticity and great water were unchanged from control. Coronary vascular resistance was unchanged in groups one and two but declined in group 3. Creatine phosphate returned to control but ATP, ADP and the adenosine pool were depressed. Ultrastructure was well preserved. In 16/24 dogs defibrillation was not required whereas 48/48 dogs with CBK and 13/13 with CBD required defibrillation. These data suggest that D is a worthwhile addition to CBK. Early one-stage repair of some congenital vascular anomalies might be accompleshed readily if the material used for grafts grew along with the reconstructed tissues. We have evaluated the capacity of tubular grafts constructed from anterior rectus sheath to serve as growing segmental replacements of the descending thoracic aorta of puppies (age 9 weeks). Grafts measuring 3 cm in length were placed in 17 animals; 10 were implanted with attention to tissue preservation (live grafts) while 7 received grafts subjected to prior freezing and thawing in order to kill the donor tissue cells (devitalized grafts). Grafts were measured initially and at sacrifice 1, 2 or 3 months later. Each months 3 animals with live grafts and 2 with devitalized grafts were sacrificed. No aneurysmal dilatations or grafts ruptures were observed in any of the specimens. By 3 months, the live grafts had increased 26.9-1-1% in length and 27.3___ 3 % in diameter, while length and diameter of the devitalized grafts showed minimal growth (2.1___20/o and 5.3___5o/o respectively). During the same period the length of the thoracic aorta increased 4.5___5% in the live graft group and 41.1___ 8 % in the devitalized graft group. Grafts were lined by endothelium and organized into 3 transmural zones. The thickness of each zone in the live grafts remained static from 1 to 3 months, whereas thickness of the middle and outer zones in the devitalized grafts increased 4 to 6 fold. In living grafts the layers consisted principally of newly formed fibrocellular tissue; the rectus sheath was reduced to a atrophic fibrous band. By contrast, the rectus sheath remained prominent in the devitalized graft specimens. Cellularity (cells/field) of the live grafts was much greater than that of the devitalized grafts (ratio 15.9___3 : 6.0-----2). A newly formed, fibrocellular layered structure replaces the rectus sheath in the live grafts. These findings indicate that rectus sheath grafts are capable of growth in the young animal, providing that at implantation the tissue is well preserved. It is well known that durability of Valvular Bioprostheses (VBP) depends mainly on the structure of constituent biomaterial and long-term preservation of the Collagen network. To our knowledge, no studies on ultrastructure of tissues currently used for VBP has been reported so far after a long time of chemical preservation. The presentation of a new anysotropic tissue, Xenogenic Cervical Duramater (XCD), with a Collagen Tridimensional Network, and a comparative study of Scanning (SEM) and Transmission (TEM) Electron Microscopy of Bovine Pericardium (BP), Human Duramater (HD) and Procine Aortic-Cusp (PAo) represent the purpose of the present communication.",

Pulmonary valve insertion seems indicated in these patients at it lowers peak pulmonary artery pressure and thus reduces compression effects on the trachea and bronchi. As well, when PVI was used right heart failure was not noted postoperatively. Although in experimental acute myocardial ischemia intraaortic balloon pumping (IABP) appears to increase regional contractility of ischemic segments of the left ventricle by increasing the collateral flow, evidence for this effect of IABP in patients with refreactory myocardial ischemia is not available. This study was done to analyze the effect of LABP on global and segmental left ventricular performance in patients with refractory, acute myocardial ischemia using gated blood pool scanning with Tc-99 albium tracer. Eight patients were studied on-and-off IABP prior to and following coronary bypass surgery. Left ventricular (LV) wall motion analysis was undertaken and both cardiac output (CO) and left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP) were determined from thermistor-tipped pulmonary artery catheters. When placed on IABP, mean preoperative global ejection fraction (GEF) increased (0.264-0.05 (OFF) to 0.354-0.05 (ON); P<0.01) abut no changes in CO or LVFP were observed. When comparisons were made praend postoperatively, CO increased after operation (P<0.05), due chiefly to an increase in heart rate (824-6 to 1074-8 beats/rain; P<0.01), but GEF was unchanged whether or not IABP was on. Only segmental wall motion analysis pre-and postoperatively revealed that IABP increased regional ejection fraction (REF) and contraction velocity by 50% (mean) in the angiographically determined regions of myocardial ischemia and these regional changes were maximal during the last one-third of the LV contraction cycle. It appears that REF is a more sensitive indicator of changes in LV performance than CO and GEF in these patients. Further, this study indicates that IABP does increase the regional wall contracility in the ischemic areas of the myocardium in man. The use of aspirin (ASA) to inhibit platelet thromboxane synthesis (TBX2) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been advocated to reduce the potential for graft occlusion. However, ASA in conventional doses also inhibits the venous synthesis of prostacyclin (PGI2) a potent anti-thrombotic factor, and may contribute to excessive surgical bleeding. To investigate the relationship between ASA dose, blood loss and inhibition of venous synthesis of PGI2, 27 patients undergoing CABG were studied. Control patients (no ASA) were compared to those receiving 80 or 325 mg. ASA as a single dose 8-16 hours prior to surgery. Production of PGI2 by saphenous vein specimens removed at the time of surgery was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) of 6-keto PGF~a following incubation with 25 uM Na arachidonate. Blood loss was assessed by chest tube drainage and transfusion requirement in the perioperative period. Serum TBX2 was measured by RIA following ASA ingestion.

After 20, 40 and 80 days of healing complete load deformation curves were determined on strips perpendicular to the incision line after the sutures were cut. Collagen distribution was measured as hydroxyproline in strips parallel to the incision line. Wound tissue continued to gain strength up to 80 days of healing (breaking energy significantly increased in all tissues from 20 to 80 days of healing). No such increase was found for wounds tested togetherwith adjacent tissue, because the \"point of maximum weakness\" had moved laterally from the incision line with healing time.

Samples are counted on a well scintillator counter and when a sample of high radioactivity is obtained, localisation is assessed both by the length of tube passed and by instilling dilute barium down the Miller-Abbot tube underfluoroscopic control. This method has been used successfully in five patients which were subsequently treated surgically with localised resection resulting in cessation of bleeding.

Conclusion: 1. Thrombocytopenia is not a typical feature of boomslang coagulopathy. 2. The demonstration of soluble monomer complexes is blood samples (positive ristocetin test) appears to be an early and consistent indication of intravascular coagulation. 3. Despite unequivocal evidence of advanced consumption, platelet function seems to be maintained, thus preventing complete heamostatic failure. 4. Support for this view is found in the clinical observation that bleeding is essentially mild and late in onset. 5. Thrombelastographic hyperretractility the \"spinning top\" appearance is a constant feature and is probably mediated via the platelets. 6. Although D.

In most cases artificial ventricles are driven pneumatically with the advantage of easy handling and the disadvantages of regulation problems, high weight and volume of the driving units and the danger of air embolism in the case of membrane rupture. The driving unit developed at Innsbruck Universiy consists of a microprocessor-controlled electromagnet driving a pump that functions as a safety chamber (SK). Force transmission to the artificial ventricle (ellipsoid heart-EH) is effected hydraulically. Thus there is a fixed connection between armature stroke and membrane movement in the EH. The armature position is measured by the microprocessor by means of a position sensor with programmable switch-over points determining the change from systole to diastole so that Idling and beat volumes, respectively, of the EH can be programmed.",

Mechanically assisted circulation is indicated in patients with cardiac failure after open heart operations. The clinical experiments show that left ventricular assist devices are capable only in a few cases to maintain full circulation. The limiting factor is the additional right heart failure syndrome. In patients with postoperative cardiac failure, a distinction must be made between isolated left heart failure and total heart failure. In patients with total heart failurebased on diffuse coronary sclerosis or on an increased pulmonary resistance -left ventricular assistance alone is not effective and right ventricular support is desired. Therefore, a simple, quick and safe biventricular assist device is necessary. With the biventricular bypass it is possible to maintain complete circulation in cases of cardiac insufficiency. For a successful outcome in patients with low cardiac output after cardiopulmonary bypass, the E-BVAD was evaluated in animal experiments (with 9 calves in 4 acute and 5 survival experiments) in cardiac failure situations.

The realtionship between acute pancreatitis (AP) and the enzyme and hormone level in blood and gastric and duodenal juices is the factor that had driven us to do this experiment that would complete the study of the physiopathology of this illness. Material and Methods. We used eight 5-year-old dogs. A) Production of two antiperistaltic fistula in the Mann and Bullman way; one gastric and the other duodenal (first part). 1. Blockage of the gastric and duodenal compartments: by the gastric fstula we introduced one Foley's bucket with closed point and inflatable globe to block the pylorus. By means of the duodenal fistula we introduced another Foley's bucket into the duodenum. Once inflated, the ball blocks the first duodenal portion. 2. Juice extraction: By adjacent openings in the gastric bucket blocking the pylorum, we extracted the gastric juice separately. With another thin Foley's bucket, that was introduced by the duodenal fistula near the already blocked one, to block the third part of duodenum when the globes inflates. B) Production of AP: 15 days after the first surgical operation, by the Morandeira method with intraparenchymal injection of a mixture of autologous bile and olive oil. Results. One of the animals died on the fifth day after the first operation. + No animal died spontaneously after the second operation. They were killed on the 4th day. In each one acute necrotizing pancreatitis could be verified. + The radiograph showed that the gastric and duodenal compartments were sealed. -It was easy to separately extract blood and gastric and duodenal juices. Conclusion. We believe that this method is complete, simple, with good results and very useful for the study of the physiopathology of AP. Liver samples were taken form 18 patients operated for cholelithiasis and common bile duct obstruction by gallstones or pancreatic tumour. Early evident histoenzymatic deficiency was found even without jaundice or liver structural lesions.

For normal functioning of a kidney transplant over a long period of time we carried out an experimental study. The purpose of the study was the investigation of operative reinnervation possibilities and its influence upon the functional state of a transplanted kidney. For the kidney reinnervation Kirpatovski's method for suturing perivascular fascial tissue flaps of anastomosed vessels with branches of vegetative plexus nervosus on them was used. Experiments were carried out on 175 mongrel dogs, both male and female. In the first group of experiments a kidney was transplanted into the pelvis while the opposite kidney was preserved or ablated. In the second group the kidney autotransplanted into pelvis was reirmerved by the described method with preserving the contralateral kidney in part of the animals and ablating the kidney in the rest of them. The third, fourth and fifth were control groups. In the third group the kidney was denerved, in the fourth it was denerved and reinnerved by the mentioned method, in the fifth group unilateral nephrectomy was performed. After the operation the animals, in different periods of time (from 3 days to 2 years), were studied by isotopic renography and by scanning kidney's by JBl-hippuran and neohydrin-Hg 2\u00b03 intravenous injections. Results of the isotopic renography were estimated qualitatively and quantitatively by universal renographic index (Hirakawa-Corcoran, 1963). Results of the experiments indicate that autotransplantation and denervation of a kidney without its reinnervation were followed by lowering of a kidney vascularisation and its secretory and excretory functions. During the first 2 or 3 months after the operation a tendency to improvement of the kidney function took place; later those functions gradually oppressed and the renographic index lowered down to 13.9+__2.1, 16.6+--.5.5 (p<0.001) respectively according to the groups. After operative reirmervation of a kidney autotransplant and denervation of a kidney without its transplantation gradual improvement of separate functions of the kidney took place: in 1 or 2 months the kidney circulation was restored; in 2 or 4, and in 4 or 6 months respectively, secretory and excretory functions of the kidney restored; renographic index reached its norm after 4 or 6 months and remained stable during 2 years (according to the groups 54.9+___5.5, 52.3-1-4.3, p>0.05 respectively). Thus, the operative reirmervation of a kidney prevented depression of its functions and provided its normal functioning during a long period of time. Introduction of fine needle aspiration cytology in renal transplantation gives the possibility not only to distinguish acute tabular necrosis, arterial and venous obstruction and viral infection from acute rejection, FNC also seems to allow judgement of the effectiveness of various types ofimmunosuppressive therapy during rejection episodes. Method: After sterile fine needle biopsy the cytological evaluation of the aspirate was performed on cytocentrifuged smears after staining the cells by the method of May-Grtinwald-Giemsa. Thus normal and \"activated\" mononuclear cell populations as well as parenchymal cells such as tabular and endothelial cells and their pathological changes could easily be recognized. The white blood cell types in FNC were compared with those of the peripheral blood. The difference in number due to the graft invading cells was expressed as \"increment\". the findings of FNC were correlated with clinical signs and serum creatinine values.",

In all cortisone and azathioprine resistant cases where ALG was used in order to suppress inflammation during rejection episodes it reduced not only the peripheral white blood cells, but also within 12 h after start of ALG therapy the number of in situ cells. Beside reduction of inflammatory cells typical changes in shape of the nucleus and density of chromatine in up to 10 % of the lymphocytes and granulocytes could be detected.

Without preservation in normothermia oligo-anuric ARF is observed at the border of ischemic tolerance (15-20 min; 36\u00b0C). The obligo-anuric ARF is dependend on ischemia which will result in necrosis of the kidney after 45 rain and 36\u00b0C ischemic temperature.

Chemotaxis of peripheral blood mononuclear phagocytes, however, has not been studied to any great extent. We have therefore investigated a method for quantifying chemotaxis by mononuclear phagocytes. Mononuclear phagocytes were purified from peripheral blood by centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque and a discontinuous percol gradient. Chemotaxis was quantified by the 'under-agarose method'. Mononuclear phagocytes were allowed to migrate towards the chemotactic agent zymosan activated serum (ZAS), and the control non-chemotactic agent Eagles medium.

This method may therefore represent a means of investigating an important role of these cells in disease states. The intrathoracic pressure rises when a person exhales into a manometer to such an extent that finally the venous blood-flow to the heart stops. It is supposed that this venous stop flow pressure (VSFP), measured by an ultrasound device, is equal to the central venous pressure. In a prospective clinical trial by two independant examiners in 97 % of the cases (n= 100) the correlation was within 5 cm H20. Therefore, the central venous pressure (CVP) can be measured non-invasively with an ultrasound device. We have previously reported that opiate receptor blockade with naloxone (NAL) significantly improves cardiovascular function and survival in canine hemorrhagic shock [1, 2] . Since species differences do exist, we investigated the effects of NAL in cynomulgus monkeys anesthetized with N20/O2. Blood was withdrawn to achieve a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 45 mmHG (t---0) which was maintained until t= 1 h when the reservoir was clamped and the animals treated with either NAL at 2 mg/kg bolus plus 2 mg/kg.h infusion I.V. or 0.9% NaC1 in equivalent volumes. There were no significant differences between NAL (n=5) and CON (n=5) in MAP, left ventricular contractility (LV dp/dt max, mmHg.10Vs), and survival; the NAL animals, however, were acidotic (PHa 7.24-----0.09) and colder (37.95-0.3\u00b0C) than CON (7.42+__0.02, 38.5-+-0.1). MAP responses to NAL were proportional to pH a Complications of vascular bypass grafts, especiallyin the femoro-popliteal region are common. The most frequent of these by far is occlusion. Other late complications iclude leaking and false aneurysm formation at the anastomotic site, dilatation of the graft material and stenosis ofanastomotic sites.

They are subject to more restrictions, ethical, statistical and practical, and may require longer or even remarkably long times.

Ratios of Th/Ts ranged from 1.27-3,50 with a mean -+ SE of 2.44___0.58. Group 2 (n=6) animals were treated with 10-30 mg Cyclosporin A/kg/ day according to the schedule described in the accompanying paper, and survived from 22-40 days. The rations in this group were similar to that of Group 1 ranging from 1.02-3.00 with a mean of 1.84___ 0.30. Group 3 (n= 7) baboons had no immunosuppression apart from 600 rads fractionated TLI, and survived from 25-40 days. Their Th/Ts ratios ranged from 0.30-0.91 (mean 0.69-+0.14) with one exception (1.35). Group 4 (n=7) consisted of longlived baboons (42->62 days) treated with 600 rad TLI. The TJTs ratio was <1.00 in all animals with a mean (0.59___0.08), marginally lower than Group 3. The results suggest that there may be a correlation between the rejection rate and Th/Ts ratios.

Flaps, 3 x 15 cm, were dorsally or ventrally based on the sides of young swine and yielded a predictable degree of necrosis. Nitroglycerin paste was applied to treated flaps immediately postoperatively and for four succeeding days. In a parallel series of experiments animals were treated with parenteral isoxsuprine (Vasodilan\u00ae), 1 mg/kg/ day, for a similar period to test the effectiveness of this agent.The surviving flap areas were expressed as a percentage of the original flap area. Areas were calculated by weighing templates cut from photocopies of tracings of the flaps made on clear plastic sheets. The nitroglycerin paste treated dorsally based flaps survived to an average of 125 % of the control values, regardless of the weight of the animal and the thickness of the flap (p<0.01). Ventrally based flaps showed even greater enhanced survival, surviving to 176 % of the ventrally based controlvalues (p<0.001). The results demonstrate that topical nitroglycerin paste, when applied immediately postoperatively, will enhance survival of an ischemic flap. This salutary effect can be increased by orienting the flap base below the level of the flap itself. Postoperative parenteral isoxsuprine failed to increase flap survival. 99 Phosphorus Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (31 PNMR) Studies of Muscle Energy Metabolism in Peripheral Vascular Disease H.D.

Following a 6-h substrate fast, 9 (GP I) nonseptic and 7 (GP II) septic (+blood culture s shock) patients received I mg/kg of a 10% fat emulsion over a 4-h period during which serial central and peripheral arterial and venous samples were obtained at baseline (B), 4H and 24H to measure glucose (GL), lactate (LA), alanlne (AL), glycerol (GLY),fl-hydroxybutryc acid (BH), glucagon (GLA), and insulin (IN). Results: 1. Alanlne and lactate release among septic patients (GP II) was significantly (P<0.01) depressed at a time 24 h of maximum ketogenesis; 2. the change in alanine and lactate levels seen in the septic group were associated with a significant decline in glucagon and a rise in glycerol. Conclusion: In the septic patient, the accelerated ketogenesis and glycerol release seen after fat infusion is beneficial in reducing lactate and alanine levels despite high glucagon and low insulin levels.",

Nine patients had gallstones with associated cholecystitis but no evidence of pancreatic disease, and choledocholithiasis in only one case. Three patients had acute pancreatitis and no gallstones were found. The remaining patient had a negativ laparotomy/cholangiogram. The early results of this study highlight the difficulty in determining the presence or absence of gallstones during the acute attack and suggest that proven cholelithiasis in such patients indicates that uncomplicated cholecystitis is more likely than gallstone pancreatitis.Antibiotic Prevention in Biliary Tract SurgeryU.F. Gruber, R. Elke, H. Gerber, M. Trippel and M. Widmer Department of Surgery, University of Basel, Kantonsspital, 4031 Basel, SwitzerlandIt is clearly established that the incidence of wound infections in biliary tract surgery is reduced by means of short term prevention with antibiotics, probably also with single dose prevention. However, it is unclear whether bacterial complications other than wound infections, like chest and urinary tract infec-tions, can also be reduced. We have therefore carried out a prospective, controlled, double-blind, randomised multicentre trial including the following 12 Swiss hospitals: Kantonsspital Aarau, Spital Altst[itten, Kantonsspital Baden, Kantonsspital Basel, Regionalspital Biel, Spital Davos, Kantonsspital Liestal, Kantonsspital Olten, St~idtisches Krankenhans Rorschach, Biirgerspital Solothurn, Kreisspital Thusis and Stadtspital Triemli Ztirich. Patients and methods: All patients above 16 years undergoing any type of operation upon the biliary tract are included. Excluded are those receiving antibiotics in the 48 h preceding surgery. A single dose of 5 g mezlocillin is given immediately after induction of anesthesia as a short-term infusion, the control group receiving a placebo. The treating surgeon is free in the postoperative administration of antibiotics. All patients are controlled for all types of infectious complications on the 6th postoperative day and at discharge. The total amount of antibiotics given postoperatively is also registered. Results: 359 patients have been admitted to the trial, 25 however were wrongly admitted since they had received antibiotics already or were not operated upon. From-the remaining 324 patients 165 belonged to the placebo and \"159 to the mezlocillin group. As a computer analysis shows, the 2 groups are strictly comparable regarding age, sex distribution, type and duration of operation, number of emergencies, number and type of drains used, duration ofpre-and postoperative hospitalisation, experience of surgeon, incidence of diabetes, cancer, jaundice and common duct stones as well as radiolgic findings and histology of specimens. 2 patients in each group had to be reoperated. 2 in the placebo and 1 in the mezlocillin group died. The incidence of wound infection is 16 in the control and 6 in the treated group (p<:0.05). The number of other infectious complications does not differ significantly. Patients operated for acute cholecystitis needed significantly less antibiotics in the postoperative period when they had mezlocillin prevention.",

Casamitjana Microsurgery Unit, School of Medicine, Casanova, 143 Barcelona, SpainRecent studies[1,2, 3]  have reported that hypocalcemia of parathyroidectomized rats could be completly corrected by portocaval shunt. It has been suggested that portocaval shunt releases a factor into the systemic circulation which acts in a manner very similar to parathyroid hormone. The present study' was designed to localize the splanchnic organ producing this substance. In this investigation selective visceral caval shunt were done in the Sprague-Dawley rat, mesocaval shunt (MCS) and portocaval shunt (PCS). The rats (200-250g) were divided into 6 groups of 7-10 Animals. Group I, control. Group II underwent parathyroidectomy (PT). Group III underwent end-to-side portocaval shunt (PCS). Group IV underwent mesocaval shunt (MCS) shunting the intestinal venous blood coming through the superior mesenteric vein while preserving the splenic, pancreatic and gastric venous flow to the liver. The anastomosis was accomplished between the mesenteric vein (after ligation the middle pancreatico-duodenal vein and the inferior pancreatico-duoduodenal vein) and the segment ofvena cava comprised between the two renal veins. Group V, (PT + PCS). Group VI, (PT q-MCS). All rats were fed a regular diet containing 2% calcium and 0.9% phosphorus and water ad libidum. Serum calcium, phosphorus, protein and hol'mones T4 and PTH were measured at frequent intervals (1,3 weeks after surgery). In group VI (PT + MCS) serum calcium was assayed also one day and three days after MCS.Results: Group II (PT) were hypocalcemic and hyperphosphatemic throughout the remaining three weeks of the study. Group III (PCS) had at 1 week a decrease of calcium in relation to controls (P<0.001) but above PT animals. Group IV (MCS) had normal calcium and phosphorus values. Of interest is the fact that except for 1 week in PCS parathyroidectomized rats at three weeks in this group and at 1 week and 3 weeks in PT + MCS exhibeted not only an increase to normal serum calcium values but their serum phosphorus concentrations were normal as well. In the MCS parathyroidectomized rats an early fall of the serum calcium concentration occurred which did not differ from that of PT rats without the shunt. However soon after, at three days, the serum calcium began to rise. By one week the calcium values became normal and thereafter could not be distinguished statistically from in PCS parathyroidectcrmized animals at three weeks.Conclusions: Our studies confirm the theses of previous investigators that PCS can correct within three weeks the hypocalcemia which occurs in PT rat. Our study demonstrates however the fact that in PT rats the serum calium values return to normal within a week period after MCS. We believe that the single most important finding in this study is the demonstration that the diversion of blood from the intestin is necessary to obtain a normal serum calcium in PT animals. It suggests the intestin as a source of a portal factor which is similar in action to parathyroid hor-",

Bonoldi Istituto di Patologia Chirurgica, Istituto di Medicina Legale dell 'Universita di Pavia, ItalyAccidental or intentional intoxication by drugs and poisons is an important and growing medical problem; moreover endogenous toxis substances have been implicated in the ethiology of several medical conditions (i.e. hepatic and renal failure). Among the various forms of therapy of the acutely intoxicated patients, dialysis play a major role for this direct action. Various types of membranes have been tested in their ability to clear blood from toxis substances in dialysis devices; nevertheless no communications have been reported regarding silicone rubber membranes. Phisico-chemical properties of silicone rubber are quite different from those of the membranes commonly used in dialysis and suggest that many plasma soluble substances with high vapour tension would pass through this membrane more easily. Purpose of this study is to assess the possible role of silicone rubber membranes in the extraction of ammonia and ethanol. A diffusion chambre was assembled that realized diffusion through a silicone rubber membrane between two static aqueous phases at different temperature. The diffusion of ethanol (aqueous solution 4 g/l) was determined in 6 experiences, lasting 12 h, at 2 different temperatures: 3 exp. at ll\u00b0C and 3 at 24\u00b0C. Diffusion of ammonia (borate buffer, pH 9.3, aqueous solution ofNH4C11 g/l)was determined in 9 experiences, lasting 12 h, at 3 different temperatures: 3 exp. at ll\u00b0C 3 at 24\u00b0C and 3 at 37\u00b0C. Samples for ethanol and ammonia concentrations were taken from inside and outside the diffusion chambre at 0.4, 8 and 12 h. At the end of each experience the integrity of the membrane was tested with a substance not diffusible (Bromosulphonphtalein). Ethanol mean transmembrane flow (g/mVh) was 0.0044 at ll\u00b0C. Transfer coefficient (m/h) was 0.0198 at ll\u00b0C and 0.0351 at 24\u00b0C; resistence (h/m) was 52,41 at ll\u00b0C and 28.41 at 24\u00b0C. Ammonia mean transmembrane flow (um/mVh) was 0.266 at ll\u00b0C, 0.887 at 24\u00b0C and 3.676 at 37\u00b0C. Transfer coefficient (m/h) was 0.00713 at 11\u00b0C. 0.0128 at 24\u00b0C and 0.0269 at 37\u00b0C; resistence (h/m) was 140.08 at ll\u00b0C, 77.7 at 24\u00b0C and 36.17 at 37\u00b0C. The obtained data confirm that substances with high vapour tension can pass through silicone rubber membrane, accordingly with the theoretical premises. Diffusion has been satisfying for ethanol and for ammonia; better results could be certainly obtained in aqueous phases in motion than in dialysis devices.Magnetic-Hydraulic SafetyDriving Unit for Artificial Ventricles N.

In following infections were recorded: wound, respiratory tract, thrombophlebitis, indwelling intravenous catheter, unidentified origin fever (>38 \u00b0C lasting more than 3 days) (FUO) and miscellaneous. Incidences: 310 patients (41%) had postoperative septic complications. Wound infection was recorded in 145 patients (19.1%), respiratory tract infection in 105 (13 %), urinary tract infection in 100 (13 %), FUO in 55 (7.2%) thrombophlebitis in 18 (2.3 %) and miscellaneous infections in 49 (6.4o/0). Predisposing factors: Wound infections were 53/413 (12.8 %) in clean operations, 41/215 (22.7 %) in potentially contaminated, 19/65 (29%) in contaminated and 24/65 (36.9o/0) in dirty.Wound infections were diagnosed later (mean 9th day) in clean than in dirty operations (mean 5th day) (P<0.05). A statistically significant correlation was found between wound infection and leght of preoperative hospital stay: from 5.4% in patients operated on within 0-6 days to 42.8% for patients operated after 28 days or more (P<0.001). No correlation was found between wound infection and age. Urinary infections were more frequent when the patients were catheterized at least once in the postoperative period (34 % vs 11%). A statistically significant correlation was found between the incidence of respiratory infections and duration of anaesthesia (3.2 %----<60 min, 120/0>60<120 min, 270/0>120 min;/~0.05). Bacterology: 181 out of 295 cultures gave positive results (61%): aerobes were isolated in 129 samples (490/0); mixed aerobes and anaerobe in 29 (9.8o/0); anaerobes in 23 (7.7 %). Bacteroides Fr. was the commonest isolated anaerobe in all types of sample except hemocultures were propionibacterium aches was the most frequent. A statistically significant correlation was found between the incidence of recvery of anaerobes and intraoperative contamination (7.4 % in clean operations, 13.5 % in potentially contaminated, 12.5% in contaminated and 20.8% in dirty; P<0.05).In wound infections the most frequent aerobes were staphylococcus in clean and E. coli in contaiminated operations. Costs: mean postoperative hospital stay of patients with septic complications was 15 days, whereas patients with no postoperative sepsis were discharged after an average of 10 days (P<0.05). Mean daily cost in our hospital was extimated $100; accordingly, the mean postoperative hospital stay of patients with sepsis costs $1500 vs $1000 of that o~ the patients without postoperative infections. Overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis/infection has been accepted the highest risk with more than 50 percent mortality due to Pneumococcus species. However, E. coli, Pseudomonas and Staph. aureus have been reported a deadful threat to the splenectomized individual also. Pneumococcal challenge after splenectomy in animal experiment and after partial salvage has been well examined. Staph. aureus-challenge has not been tried after splenic repair, so far. Material and method: A total of 150 NMRI-mice (18-20 g) have been subjected to: 1 sham-operation, 2 splenectomy, 3 peritoneal splenosis, 4 controls as non-operated group.The technique was similar to the one performed in 90 rabbits, prior reported. 6 weeks postoperatively, the mice were exposed to intraperitoneal injection of Staph.aureus concentrations of 101\u00b0c/ml down to 104c/ml. The peritoneal cavity of mice has a high resistance to Staph.aureus, as only No. 36835 proved lethal. Results: Whereas the macroscopic view post mortem seemed promissing, showing almost total salvage of the splenic particles 6 weeks postoperatively bacterial challenge with Staph.aureus was contradictory: 3 x 10 s c/ml was survived by all splenectomized mice, by only 25percent of the splenosis micecand by none of the sham and nonoperated mice. Due to the small number of only 48 mice within this mice-pathologenic Staph. aureus species, we may not draw definite conclusions. As for one, the intraperitoneal application may not be the natural way of septicemia. On the other hand, splenic remnants may not be as effective in the protection of Staph.aureus-sepsis as in a pneumococcal challenge. Therefore, further studies with Staph.aureus species in other animals and by other application route will be needed! Studies of the coagulant effects of boomslang (Dispholidus typus) venom have indicated that the coagulant effect was mainly due to its ability to activate prothrombin. It also activates prethrombin I, factor X and possible factor IX as well [1] . Although boomslang envenomation is said to represent a classic model of disseminated intravascular coagulation, certain features are worthy of critical thought. The coagulation profile of a nine year old lad, who was admitted to the H.F. Verwoerd-Hospital, 48 h after a reputed boomslang bite, provided the impetus to explore the in vivo effect ofcurde. D. typusvenom on the thrombelastographic and other haemostatic changes in the chacma beboon. Methods: 0.0005 mg, 0.0015rag and 0.05mg respectively of crude. D. typus venom were injected subcutaneously in 3 adult baboons. Serial determinations of the flow parameters were done over 3-6 days. Thrombelastography on whole blood an platelet This report presents the ten year survey of liver mitochondria analized in 385 patients.1. Two mechanisms were of major importance in the augmentation of mitochondrial ability to synthesize ATP: a) the enhancement of ATP-generating capacity per unit of respiratory assemblies and b) the increase in respiratory enzyme contents. Those compensatory mechanisms were functional within a certain range of contents in cytochrome A (0.5-1.5 nmol/mg protein, normal; 0.8). Hepatic insufficiency was observed in patients with cytochrome A contents less than 0.5 or more than 1.5.2. In all patients with cytochrome A of 0.7-1.0 nmol/mg, the blood glucose level after an oral glucose load (50g) returned toward normal within 2 h (parabolic Pattern). In 25 patients with cytochrome A of more than 1.5, the blood glucose level did not return toward normal within 2 h (linear pattern). Parabolic and linear patterns were intermingled in the patients with cytochrome A form 1.0 to 1.5.In this report, we will emphasize the importance of preoperative OGTT and measurement of cytochrome A contents during operation for the prediction of operative prognosis, better than any other currently used index of liver function, in the patients receiving major surgery such as hepatectomy or operation for esophageal varices in severe cirrhosis. The reticulo-endothelial system (RES) has largely been ignored in studies of liver regeneration. In this study, the RES was \"blocked\" with colloidal carbon, or was stimulated with olive oil or with glucan. Indices of liver regeneration were the Thymidine kinase acitivtiy (TK) and the number of mitotic figures (MI) in liver biopsies. Fibronectin was measured as a putative index of Kupffer cell function.Four animals in each group were sacrified at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 h after sham-operation or 68% partial hepatectomy (PH). Group 1: carbon suspension (Pelikan Ink, Wagner) 16 mg/100 g rat single injection pre-operative; Group 2: olive oil (10 % in 5 % dextrose water + 0.1% Tween 20) 0.25 ml/20 g rat single injection pre-operative; Group 3: as group 2 given at intervals of 24 h; Group 4: glucan 1.0 rag/ 100 g rat pre-op, and at intervals of 24 h.Results: Glucan or a single dose of oil increased TK in PH and sham-operated rats but did not influence M.I. Carbon inhibited MI but did not influence TK. Fibronectin levels were increased in sham-operated and PH rats after daily oil or glucan.In conclusion, no administration enhanced both TK and Mi but stimulation of the RES with glucan or oil did increase fibronectin levels in both sham and PH rats. It appears that the RES does not have a role in liver regeneration as assessed above, but fibronectin appears to have been an indicator of RES activity. Anatomical abnormalities of the gallbladder include multiseptate and bilobed organs, and the more common transverse septate variant. Patients with the latter type often have typical biliary symptoms which are thought to be caused initially by raised intracystic pressure and subsequently by inflammation and calculi formation in the distal lobe [1] .This study evaluate~ the long term effects of SIBP on hepatic lipid and fibrous tissue accumulation. Liver was obtained at the time of abdominal operation from 6 normal weight patients, 18 morbidly obese patients (mean body weight 163+21 kg) and 27 patients 4 or more years (mean 69-+ 19 months) postoperative from SIBP. From wedge liver biopsies hepatic total lipid, triglyceride, cholesterol, phospholipid and protein contents were determined as well as the activities of acetyl CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase. Histologic evaluation of needle biopsies of the liver was used to quantitatively estimate the amount of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis present.There was also a significant histopathologic increase in hepatic fibrosis present in the liver tissue from SIBP patients when compared to hepatic fibrosis in liver from obese patients as well as when compared to liver specimens obtained from the SIBP patients at the time of their SIBP. The effect of reversal of the SIBP on hepatic fat content and fibrosis was determined by transcutaneous liver biopsy 6-22 mos. following take down of SIBP. Post-reversal histologic quantitation of hepatic fibrosis and inflammation was significantly decreased from pre-reversal values and the improvement was greater in patients who lost weight. Patients year after SIBP have persistent hepatic steatosis with hepatic fibrosis and inflammation. Improvement in these parameters may be anticipated following reconstruction of the intestinal tract particularly if weight loss is maintained. The aim of this paper is to study the metabolic effects of gastric bypass in dogs. We used dogs weighing between 21 and 25 kg. The animals were divided into three groups: A) five dogs without surgical operation (control); B) six dogs with a fundoj ejunal bypass, and C) six dogs with a gastroplasty. In group B and C the exclusion was 9/10 of the stomach. In all of the animals and groups were determined: cholesterol , live r function tests, calcium, magnesium-and electrolyte levels, the body weight evolution and the Apparent-Digestibility Coefficient (ADC) of fat, protein, minerals and glucosides for a type of diet. The composition of this diet in dry substance was: fat 35.4%, protein 35.2%, glucosides 26.5% and minerals 2.9%. These analyses were determined five times during the twelve months of control. The animals were kept in individual metabolism cages which allow feces and urine to be gathered separately as well as the food consumed to be controlled. The cages were housed in a room thermoregulated at 18 \u00b0C\u00b12. The cholesterol, calcium, magnesium and electrolyte levels were normal during the twelve months of control in the three groups. The liver function tests were normal in all groups with the exception of serum aspartate transaminase initially deteriored in group B. The body weight evolution was significantly diminished in groups B and C compared with the control group (p<0.002 and p<0.002). The results of ADC expressed in % \u00b1 SD were.By 15roviding a functional gastric capacity of less than 100 ml and consequently a forced reduction in food intake the gastric bypass produces an effective loss of weigth. Our results suggest that the gastric bypass can be considered as an effective and safe alternative to intestinal bypass for treatment of morbidly obese subjects who have failed nonsurgical treatment; however, a great and deeper research is necessary to discover the possible side effects of 227 gastric bypass surgery; then its ultimate benefits will be fully understood. There was no operative mortality. The percent of the excess weight lost following the two operations is shown and compared with weight lost following gastric bypass. It is concluded that: 1. Complications occured more often following gastroplasty, 25.5 % compared with 10.4 % of the patients treated by gastrogastrostomy. 2. The amount of excess weith lost was greater after gastroplasty, a mean of 61% for 30 patients followed for two years, than after gastrogastrostomy, a mean Of 41% for 13 patients followed for two years. 3. Because of the incidence of stomal obstruction requiring reoperation following gastroplasty, 14.8 % compared with 1.4% after gastrogastrostomy, is our preferred operation. 4. To improve weight loss after gastrogastrostomy the TA-55 is now used instead of the TA-90 stapling instrument. The proximal gastric pouch is reduced in size to 20-25 ml and the stoma made smaller to 9 ram. An artifical esophagus was made of silicone rubber tube covered with a Dacron mesh. A segment of thoracic esophagus of 16 dogs was replaced with this graft using three different types ofamastomosis, i.e., overlayer end-to-end anastomosis, two layer end-toend anastomosis both using a flanged tube, and monolayer end-to-end anastomosis with noflange tube. Seven of 16 dogs (44%) survived more than 12 months without complications, and 4 of them more than 6 years. In 6 of 7 of the prolonged survivors, extrusion of the graft was recognized in the 3rd to 6th month after operation. Esophageal stenosis increased slightly up to the 6th month after extrusion of the graft, but it did not further advance until sacrifice. In these dogs, mucosal regeneration of the neoesophagus was complete with muscle layers and mucous glands in the submucosa recognized microscopically. Proximal esophagus from the replaced portion was apparently dilatated more than that of the distal portion. There was no definite difference between the anastomotic techniques with regard to complication or prognosis. These results suggest a possibility for clinical trials.",

            "text": "Paper withdrawn 171 Attempts to reduce nephrovascular hypertension by surgical techniques deviating renal venous blood and renin directly to the hepatic filter are at present discouraging. Experimental data with portocaval transposition are contradictory, due mostly to the use of heterogeneous biological models (mongrel dogs) and collateral circulation developement. Renal to portal vein end-to-side (ETS) and end-to-end (ETE) anastomoses in the rat were therefore tested as possible experimental models. We observed that even after right kidney decapsulation, collateral vein circulation develops through the periureteral plexus, particularly after ETS shunts, one month after surgery. Nevertheless, collateral cirulation in the male rat can be prevented by ligature and cutting offthis plexus near the kidney. In the female rat instead, collateral circulation is still possible. In fact, newly formed pericapsular veins join the right kidney to the right ovaric vein and therefore preventive ligature and eradication of these vessels is also necessary. In conclusion, both models (ETE-ETS shunt) appear feasible in the rat, and reliable for studies dealing with nephrovascular hypertension and hepatic metabolism of renin. The handling of the exocrine system is one of the main problems inpancreas transplantation. One trial to overcome this problem consists of the occlusion of the pancreatic duct system. A the theoretical disadvantage is the induction of a secretion oedema which may lead to blood flow disturbance followed by venous thrombosis. The aim of the present experiments was to study the effect of an anti-oedematous drug (cumarin and rutin sulphate (Venalot \u00ae) on the blood flow of autologous segmental pancreatic transplantation was tested by chosing the cervical region of the dog as the site of grafting. Material and Methods: 10 dogs weighting 20-30 kg were used. These dogs were divided into two groups (control group, n=5; treated group, n=5, Venalot \u00ae dose: 1 rag, cumarin/kg/b.w.).

This conditioned graft was transplanted at the neck of the same dog, performing the anastomoses between the carotid and the splenic vessels. The blood flow of the pancreatic graft was measured with radioactively labelled microsperes of 15/~m immediately after, as well as 4 days after grafting. The developing oedema of the graft was estimated by weight gain, histological and electron microscopic investigation. Residual exocrine function of the graft was measured by determining the serum lipase and amylase levels.Results: The autotransplantation of an segmental pancreatic graft to the neck of a dog is a feasable and technically easy surgical procedure, without major Venalot -treated dogs local complications. In the \u00ae there was a higher weight increase of the graft in comparison to the controls. As tested so far there was no difference in the behaviour of the I~lood flow of the grafts in both experimental groups. There was a significant increase of serum amylase and lipase values in the Venalot\u00ae-trea'ted group. Conclusion: The technique of cervical segmental pancreatic transplantation in dogs is recommended in cases where immunological monitoring (aspiration cytology, biopsies) is the aim of the study (good access to needles). The technique of microspheres injection is a useful method for the examination of the blood flow in segmental pancreatic grafts in dogs. The prolamine-induced secretion-oedema of ductoccluded pancreatic grafts is resistant to Venalot \u00aetreatment. Graft pretreatment has been used in various organs to prolong aUograft survival. We have recently demonstrated that graft pretreatment of canine renal allografts with Cyclosporin A (Ca A) led to improved animal and graft survival. Our present study assesses the effect ofCy A as a graft pretreatment on pancreatic islet cell allografts. Pancreases were removed from unrelated donor mongrel dogs and placed in iced saline (4\u00b0C) after the collagenase digestion. The tissue fragments were washed once more and then another 5 mg Cy A was added to the preparation prior to intrasplenic injection of the islet cell allografts. Three groups were studied: Group I (n= 15) served as pancreatectomized non-transplanted controls, Group II (n = 15) received a non-pretreated islet cell allograft after total pancreatectomy and Group III (n= 10) received a Cy A graft pretreated islet cell transplant after total pancreatectomy. All animals were given minimal immunosuppression with azathioprine (5 rng/kg/day x 3, followed by 2,5 mg/kg/ day). Blood glucose values were monitored to determine engraftment and subsequent rejection. Hyperglycemia was considered when plasma glucose values rose above 150 mg/dl. All pancreatectomized controls (Group I) became hyperglycemic by the first post-operative day. Non-pretreated islet cell allografts in Group II had variable function and became hyperglycemic between one and nine days after transplantation. Only five of ten animals in Group III, receiving Cy a pretreated islet cells, became hyperglycemic levels greater than 90 days and one died of unknown causes immediately after transplantation. The following table presents the animal survival data for the 90 day follow-up period.Although the exact mechanism of action is not known, this study indicates that Cy A graft pretreatmerit can be beneficial in prolonging pancreatic islet cell allograft survival, Further studies will optimize the use ofCy A in this application and hopefully contribute to the improvement of pancreatic islet cell transplantation. Grafting of vascularised organs has become a standard procedure in surgical research. However, only few data of the fate oforthotopicliver transplantation in the rat are available, probably because of the difficult ~iargery involved. This communication gives an account of the outcome of 40 liver allografts and 16 liver isografts in four inbred strains of rat. The following groups of allo and isografts are formed; the survival time is given in days postoperatively.The technical details of the operative procedure of orthotopic liver transplantation in the rat are described elsewhere (Eur Surg Res 13:236 (1981). The distribution of death among allallograft groups show 3 blocks of survivors. The first block includes animals surviving up to 30 days. Acute rejection and infection are the diagnosed causes of death in this compartment. The second block includes animals surviving up to 110 days. In the grafts, which belong to this compartment a intrahepatic bile duct proliferation is a frequent and dominant histological feature. Because of the development of identical lesions in isograft surviving the same periode and the induction of this lesions by common bile duct ligation experiments, chronic rejection is excludet as the cause of death. The third block includes all so called long-term survivors, in which the structure of the grafts are remarkably well preserved and very few abnormalities are present. The occurence of fatal acute rejection and long-term survival in each allograft group demonstrates, that the fate of the orthotopically transplanted livers in not dependent upon ",
