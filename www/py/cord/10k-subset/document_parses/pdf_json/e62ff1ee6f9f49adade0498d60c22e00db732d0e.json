Since the first ISPPD was held in 1998, substantial progress has been made to control pneumococcal disease, for instance, more than half of surviving infants (78.6 million) from 143 countries now have access to the life-saving pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV). The 11th ISPPD (ISPPD-11) was held in Melbourne, Australia in April 2018 and the proceedings of the symposium are captured in this report. Twenty years on from the first ISPPD, there remain many challenges and unanswered questions such as the continued disparity in disease incidence in Indigenous populations, the slow roll-out of PCV in some regions such as Asia, the persisting burden of disease in adults, serotype replacement and diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia. ISPPD-11 also put the spotlight on cutting-edge science including metagenomic, transcriptomic, microscopy, medical imaging and mathematical modelling approaches. ISPPD-11 was highly diverse, bringing together 1184 delegates from 86 countries, representing various fields including academia, primary healthcare, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, policymakers and public health.",

The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was licensed and introduced in 2000, markedly reducing the incidence of IPD caused by vaccine serotypes [2] [3] [4] . In 2000, an estimated 14.5 million total illnesses and 735,000 childhood deaths were attributed to the pneumococcus [5] , which placed this Gram positive bacterium among the most important killers of children under 5 years of age. As of 2018, the 10-valent (PCV10) and 13-valent (PCV13) formulations of PCV had replaced the 7-valent version in 2011 and have now been introduced in 143 countries globally, with 58% (78.6 million) of infants having access to these life-saving vaccines [6] . Between 2000 and 2015, there was an estimated 51% decline in pneumococcal deaths among children less than 5 years old [7] .",

Areas of focus were; access to PCVs, continued disparity in disease incidence in Indigenous populations, burden of disease in adults and serotype replacement. Appropriately, the program for ISPPD-11 put the spotlight on Indigenous communities in the region and around the globe who still face unacceptably high rates of IPD, other pneumococcal diseases and their sequelae. For example, the slow roll-out of PCV in some regions such as Asia and the high burden of IPD in adults where PCV impact has been modest in some regions [8] . ISPPD-11 also brought the very latest scientific innovations in the field including in metagenomics, transcriptomics, microscopy, medical imaging and mathematical modelling.

Alternatively, two primary doses plus a booster given between the age of 9 and 15 months is also recommended [12] . There is interest in understanding the optimal number of PCV doses and the timing of the doses [13] while balancing cost and program sustainability. The potential benefits of a booster-containing regimen are being evaluated in many studies in low-and middleincome countries (LMIC) and results from Nepal and Vietnam are highlighted here. A study of 2 different 2 + 1 PCV10 schedules in Nepal (either 6, 14 weeks plus a booster prior to 1 year or 6, 10 weeks plus a booster dose given before 1 year of age, produced comparable antibody responses in Nepali infants following the booster, although antibody levels after the primary series were lower in the 6 + 10 week age groups [14] . Comparison of a PCV10 3-dose primary series (2, 3, 4 months) was found to produce slightly higher serotype specific antibody concentrations than a 2-dose primary schedule (2 and 4 months). However, following a booster given at 9 months, the 2 + 1 schedule produced significantly higher antibody levels, potentially demonstrating an advantage of the 2 + 1 schedule in this setting [15] . When comparing PCV13 and PCV10 using the 2 + 1 schedule, PCV13 produced higher antibody titers than PCV10 for most serotypes post-primary series, while similar levels were seen for both vaccines at 9 months pre-booster and following the booster [15] .",

Suzuki and colleagues [24] found that effectiveness of 23vPPV against pneumococcal pneumonia was 27% but wanes over time and with increasing age at vaccination. Macintyre and colleagues conducted a randomized control trial (RCT) among hospitalized elderly Australians who were recruited to receive either 23vPPV alone or PCV7 and 23vPPV [25] . They found substantial waning of immunity between 12 and 60 months post vaccination for all serotypes using the opsonophagocytic assay (OPA). The clinical implications of this waning immunity remain unclear.",

Questions remain regarding the cost effectiveness of rolling out PCV13 for adults with existing immunization programs [28] . The final decisions will largely depend on the herd immunity conferred by infant immunization programs and the lower cost of 23vPPV compared to PCV13. For example, in 2019, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) downgraded the universal recommendation for PCV13 use for adults >65years and decisions to administer PCV13 will now be based on shared clinical decision-making. The updated recommendation was supported by the finding that herd immunity from PCV13 infant immunizations made a more significant impact than vaccinating adults in the US [29] .",

This discordance does not infer \"incorrect\" diagnosis, but rather highlights the limitations of different diagnostic standards and the importance of considering these limitations in research and practice. Mahomed and colleagues [52] presented a computer aided diagnostic algorithm for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation for childhood pneumonia. Using expanded data from the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study South African site, the algorithm had 70% sensitivity and 72% specificity (compared to expert radiology opinion). Given the challenges of interpretation of CXRs in children this is promising, especially as there is capacity to further improve the diagnostic algorithm. Improvement in measurement of hypoxemia in children was described by Boyd and colleagues [53] .

SpIDnet demonstrated an even more dramatic 84% increase in non-PCV serotypes following PCV implementation across Europe [61] . The United Kingdom (UK) has seen declines in IPD and PCV13-type IPD, offset by significant increases in non-PCV13 serotypes, particularly since 2013 [62] . The incidence of IPD caused by non-PCV13 serotype IPD has doubled, with serotypes 8, 12F and 9N responsible for > 40% of IPD cases in 2016/17. Nearly complete replacement disease has been observed in adults in the UK. Another interesting aspect of replacement in the UK is that early replacement was largely due to serotypes with a low case:carrier ratio prior to PCV13 introduction. However, the replacement under the pressure of PCV13 has been different, characterized more by serotypes with a greater case: carrier ratio. In South Africa, non-PCV13 serotypes increased by nearly a third, with serotypes 8 and 35B being the dominant serotypes following PCV13 implementation [27] .",

There is a need for protection against a broader breadth of serotypes, but interest in noncapsular pneumococcal vaccines has declined while evidence of the limitations of PCVs is growing stronger. The pathway to licensure is considered a key barrier to the development of new pneumococcal vaccines, particularly protein vaccines, as there are no known correlates of protection. Thus, engagement with regulators is needed, to develop new approaches for evaluating and licensing vaccines that account for potential ecological effects. Expanded valency PCVs may suffer from \"GMC creep\" whereby serotype-specific IgG responses may decrease as more serotypes are added to the vaccine. It is unknown when this becomes clinically significant. Additional questions arise given the fact that much of the pneumococcal disease burden resides in adults, but most work in vaccine development is focused on pediatric vaccines. Should we be making a different PCV for adults targeting serotypes causing IPD in adults? Should we be evaluating new vaccines initially in adults rather than children?",

This finding is consistent with data reported from animal model studies of pneumococcal coinfections with RSV [98] , Trichuris muris [99] , and influenza virus [100] . Further investigation into RSVpneumococcal coinfection showed that inflammatory markers and overall disease were also enhanced, but that epithelial integrity was maintained [98] . Like influenzapneumococcal coinfections [96, [100] [101] [102] alveolar macrophages during T. muris infection exhibit reduced killing capacity [99] . In T. muris-pneumococcal coinfection, increased carriage and dissemination of pneumococci into the lungs was also observed [99] . Pneumococcal serotypes were found to be more diverse in mixed-infections [103] .",
