[1] regarding the increased rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolation in the intensive care unit (ICU) during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong. The SARS outbreak in Singapore, which lasted from 4 March 2003 to 11 May 2003, also led to the adoption of heightened infection-control measures, including mandatory universal use of personal protective equipment (PPE) consisting of disposable long-sleeved gowns, gloves, goggles, and N95 masks by health care workers for all patient contacts. Compulsory training on the proper donning and discarding of PPE was instituted, and compliance with hand washing was re-inforced. Observers were employed to ensure that these measures were followed by the ward staff. In addition, all patients with undifferentiated fever were nursed in single isolation rooms until the cause of their fever was ascertained. Whereas the data reported by Yap et al. [1] was confined to the ICU, we studied the effect of these measures on hospital-wide nosocomial MRSA infection and bacteremia rates in the National University Hospital, a 1000bed teaching facility in Singapore.",

[1] , our findings seem to suggest that the universal use of gloves and gowns did not produce the expected decrease in the rate of nosocomial cross-infection [2, 3] . Although protective to health care workers, inanimate objects (such as gloves and gowns) have been implicated as reservoirs of MRSA [4, 5] . In addition, although we were able to document a marked improvement in hand hygiene compliance, we were unable to show expected reductions in the rate of nosocomial infection [6, 7] . We suspect that despite-or perhaps because of-the increased emphasis on hand hygiene, compliance with glove change between patient contacts was reduced, and this may have led to increased transmission of multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens on the gloved hands of health care workers [5] . Another possible explanation for the paradoxical increase in MRSA rates during the SARS outbreak could be the shunting of limited infection-control resources to SARS case surveillance and epidemiology and away from mainstream infection-control activities, thus compromising the effectiveness of baseline control measures against nosocomial infections.",

Second, the heavy use of antimicrobials active against gram-negative organisms could have promoted the overgrowth of MRSA.

An alternative explanation for the significant increase in the rate of MRSA acquisition may be a viral-bacterial interaction between SARS-CoV and S. aureus, leading to an explosive airborne dispersal of S. aureus and a very efficient transmission of MRSA from colonized to noncolonized patients (the \"cloud phenomenon\"). This phenomenon was described by Eichenwald et al. [2] , who showed that newborn infants who are nasally colonized with S. aureus produce significant airborne S. aureus dispersal and become highly contagious after infection with a respiratory virus. These babies caused explosive outbreaks of S. aureus infection in nurseries. Because they were literally surrounded by clouds of bacteria, they were called \"cloud babies\" [2] . We have recently shown that the same mechanism also occurs in certain adult nasal S. aureus carriers (\"cloud adults\") [3] [4] [5] . Reports in the literature describe single health care workers nasally colonized with S. aureus who originated nosocomial S. aureus epidemics while experiencing a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. This confirms that \"cloud adults\" can cause outbreaks [3, 6, 7] . Our data also indicate that clothing contaminated with S. aureus can amplify the dispersal of these bacteria into the air [4, 5] , in agreement with previous observations [8, 9] .",
