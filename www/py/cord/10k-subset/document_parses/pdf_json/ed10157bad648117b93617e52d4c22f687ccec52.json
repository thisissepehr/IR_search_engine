A novel T-cell-receptor (TCR)-like singlechain variable fragment (scFv) antibody specific for the T-cell epitope consisting of the WT1/HLA-A2 complex was isolated from a human scFv phage library. This scFv was affinity-matured by mutagenesis combined with yeast display and structurally analyzed using a homology model. This monovalent scFv showed a 100-fold affinity improvement (dissociation constant (K D ) = 3 nM) and exquisite specificity towards its targeted epitope or HLA-A2 + /WT1 + tumor cells. Bivalent scFv-huIgG1-Fc fusion protein demonstrated an even higher avidity (K D = 2 pM) binding to the T-cell epitope and to tumor targets and was capable of mediating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or tumor lysis by chimeric antigen receptor-expressing human T-or NK-92-MItransfected cells. This antibody demonstrated specific and potent cytotoxicity in vivo towards WT1-positive leukemia xenograft that was HLA-A2 restricted. In summary, T-cell epitopes can provide novel targets for antibody-based therapeutics.

In cancer, virusspecific or tumor-specific peptide/MHC complexes represent a unique class of cell surface targets for immunotherapy, with promise in vaccine research, 3 adoptive cell therapy 4 and, more recently, TCR-like antibodies. 5, 6 Although soluble TCRs have been successfully developed to target T-cell epitope on tumors, their inherent low affinity has limited their potential as therapeutics. 7 Even more importantly, the low density of MHC molecules and of the individual displayed peptides put further constraints on low-affinity TCRs. 8 Attempts to affinity mature TCRs were sometimes hampered by crossreactivity. 9, 10 Monoclonal antibodies are now an accepted modality in cancer treatment. Yet, most of these antibodies have targeted surface antigens whose repertoire on solid tumors is limited. TCR-like antibodies, with high affinity and controlled specificity, could be ideal therapeutics. 5, 11 To this end, several TCRlike antibodies targeting peptides derived from viral or tumor antigens in the context of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A1 or HLA-A2 have been reported.

yeast display selection. (a) Sorting of yeast mutant library. Yeast library was labeled with mouse anti-c-myc antibody followed by fluorescent goat anti-mouse antibody, as well as biotinylated HLA-A2-WT1 monomer followed by fluorescent streptavidin (SA). During the three FACS selections, yeast cells were stained with decreasing concentrations of biotinylated HLA-A2-WT1 monomer at 100 \u03bcg/ml (sort 1), 33 \u03bcg/ml (sort 2) and 10 \u03bcg/ml (sort 3), respectively. Each time, the brightest 0.1-0.3% cells were selected. (b) The binding and specificity of selected scFv-displayed yeast cell. Yeast cells from the third round selection (the first row) or parental Clone45 (the second row) were stained with biotinylated HLA-A2-WT1 monomer (first column) followed by fluorescent SA.

The y axis represents the monomer or tetramer binding. San Diego, CA, USA) or Pymol (Schrodinger LLC, New York, NY, USA). A homology model of the anti-WT1-HLA-A2 scFv antibody was built using pdb structure of the anti-SARS scFv antibody from pdb 2GHW as a template (68% sequence identity). Each CDR loop was then refined using additional homologous templates shown in parentheses: L1 (2BX5, 1RZI, 2UZI), L2 (2VH5, 2UZI, 2BX5), L3 (2BX5, 3NCJ, 2FGW), H1 (2QQN, 1H3P, 3QOS), H2 (2QQN, 3SKJ, 3SOB), and H3 (1MRD, 1MRE, 1MRC). The final model underwent 2 nanoseconds of molecular dynamics simulation to reach a low-energy conformation for use in docking simulations. Docking simulations were run using the energy-minimized homology model of ZDOCK with anti-WT1-HLA-A2 scFv and the crystal structure of HLA-A2-WT1-RMF (pdb 3HPJ).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "ELISA of scFv variants and Q2L scFv-Fc against HLA-A2-peptide monomers. (a) Three scFvs (S3.1, S3.3 and S3.6) from the FACS sorting and parental Clone45 scFv were serially diluted and tested for binding to wells coated with HLA-A2-WT1 (RMFPNAPYL) monomer. (b) Q1L (single mutation), Q2L (double mutations) and S3.3 scFvs were serially diluted and added to wells coated with HLA-A2-WT1 (RMFPNAPYL) monomer. (c) The S3.1, S3.3, S3.6, Q2L, parental scFvs and Q2L scFv-Fc were serially diluted and added to wells coated with WT1 peptide (RMFPNAPYL), three types of HLA-A2-WT1 monomers and four irrelevant HLA-A2 monomers.

When highest affinity clones from the final round of sorting were sequenced, four recurrent scFv sequences (S3.1, S3.3, S3.6 and S3.22) were identified.
