Methods : Prospective study of patient demographics, PRISM III scores, diagnoses, treatment, morbidity and mortality of all PICU admissions. Results : 948 children were admitted to the PICU. Mean age was 41.48 months. Male to female ratio was 2.95:1. Mean PRISM III score on admission was 18.50. Diagnoses included respiratory (19.7%), cardiac (9.7%), neurological (17.9%), infectious (12.5%), trauma (11.7%), other surgical (8.8%).196 children (20.68%) required mechanical ventilation. Average duration of ventilation was 6.39 days. 27 children (30.7 children/1000 admissions) had acute respiratory distress syndrome. Gross mortality was 6.7% (59 patients). PRISMIII adjusted mortality was directly proportional to PRISMIII scores. 49.5% of nonsurvivors had multiorgan failure. Average length of PICU stay was 4.52 +/-2.6 days. Complications Commonly encountered were atelectasis (6.37%), accidental extubation (2%), and pneumothorax (0.9%). Incidence of nosocomial infections was 16.86%. Conclusion : Our data appears to be similar with regards to PRISMIII scores and adjusted mortality, length of the PICU stay, and duration of ventilation, to previously published western data. Multiorgan failure remains a major cause of death. As expected, Dengue and malaria were common. Incidence of nosocomial infections was somewhat high. Interestingly, more boys got admitted to the PICU as compared to girls. Clearly more studies are required to assess the overall outcomes of critically ill children in India.

Due to rapid growth in population and, general lack of education and health awareness, inability to adequately control infectious diseases is a major public health issue.

During the three years of study p e r i o d the n u m b e r of admissions to our PICU also gradually increased from 270 in first year to 368 in third year. Currently the PICU admissions average 450 to 500 per annum. Information regarding status of PICUs in various states is largely unpublished. Only a few major centers run by state medical colleges have tertiary level PICUs, in addition to even fewer privately run tertiary level institutions.Various previously published studies have reported significant variability between PICUs in age, percentage of surgical or trauma patients, morbidity, and mortality. 1619 Although many scoring systems exist for different illnesses for assessing severity. 7,8,19-23 a foolproof qualitative and unbiased assessment of severity of illness is difficult, and controversy continues regarding the accuracy of prediction of mortality due to significantly different mortality rates reported in different studies. 2~,22",

This is somewhat higher than that reported in literature from developed countries, expected to be 5 to 15 %,2s but similar to that of other developing countries. 29,3~ A relatively high rate of nosocomial infections could be related to factors such as personal hygiene, noncompliance of PICU visitation policies and infection control measures such as strict hand washing before and after patient contact. Authors acknowledge the limitation of this study as being representative for only a subgroup of hospitals catering to a relatively higher socioeconomic group, rather than rural areas of India or even medical school (university) affiliated city hospitals run by various state governments.
