Methods: An adult manikin was connected to a dual-chamber model lung, which was driven by a critical care ventilator to simulate spontaneous breathing. A HFNC system was utilized with temperature at 37\u00b0C while gas flow at 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 L/min. Inspiration synchronized and continuous aerosol generation were compared at different positions (at the inlet of humidifier vs close to patient). One milliliter of albuterol (2.5 mg/mL) was used in each run (n = 3). Collection filter was placed at the trachea and was removed after each run. Drug was eluted from the filter and assayed with UV spectrophotometry (276 nm). Results: When nebulizer was placed close to patient, inhaled dose was higher with inspiration synchronized than continuous aerosol generation at all gas flows (p = 0.05) except at 5 L/min. When placed at the inlet of humidifier, compared to continuous, inspiration synchronized aerosol generated higher inhaled dose with gas flow set below 50% of patient inspiratory flow [23.9 (20.6, 28.3)% vs 18.1 (16.7, 19.6)%, p < 0.001], but lower inhaled dose with gas flow set above 50% of patient inspiratory flow [3.5 (2.2, 9.3)% vs 9.9 (8.2, 16.4)%, p = 0.001]. Regardless of breathing pattern, continuous aerosol delivered greater inhaled dose with nebulizer placed at humidifier than close to patient at all gas flows except at 5 L/min. Conclusion: When the HFNC gas flow was set higher than 50% of patient inspiratory flow, no significant advantage was found in inspiration synchronized over continuous aerosol. However, inspiration synchronized aerosol generated 30% more inhaled dose than continuous with gas flow set below 50% of patient inspiratory flow, regardless of nebulizer placement.

This continuous production causes the waste of aerosolized medication during patient expiratory phase, which is up to three times longer than the inspiratory phase. Because of this drawback, VMN is commonly placed distal from the patient, making the circuit and humidifier chamber act as a reservoir to contain the aerosol generated during expiratory phase, resulting in more aerosol available to the patient [9] .

", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "When continuous nebulizer is placed close to patient, little to no aerosol could be stored considering the small volume of nasal cannula; thus, aerosol is largely wasted during exhalation. Inspiration synchronized aerosol generates higher inhaled dose by reducing the waste during exhalation; this explains our findings with nebulizer placed close to patient, which agreed with the finding that higher inhaled dose with breath actuated jet nebulizer than continuous jet nebulizer when it was placed at the Y-piece during invasive ventilation [10] . Moreover, Michotte et al. found higher inhaled dose with inspiration synchronized VMN than continuous VMN during noninvasive ventilation, particularly when nebulizer was placed between the single-limb ventilator and exhalation port; the waste of aerosol was more significant with continuous VMN than inspiration synchronized VMN [11] . In Golshahi et al.'s study, they used similar breathing parameters during quiet breathing (Vt 500 ml, RR 15) but only investigated one gas flow (20 L/min), with nebulizer placed close to patient; they also found higher inhaled dose at nostril level with inspiration synchronized than continuous aerosol [19] . However, we found one exception that with gas flow at 5 L/min, inhaled dose was higher with continuous than inspiration synchronized aerosol, which might be explained by the significant reduction of the washing out effects due to the extremely low flow, resulting in reservoir of aerosol during exhalation for continuous aerosol. In contrast, because of the low flow rate to carry aerosol, aerosol generated at the inspiratory phase might not be able to fully reach the trachea yet before exhalation [20, 21] . Due to the concerns of the aerosol waste during exhalation, continuous VMN was found to generate higher inhaled dose when placed at the inlet of humidifier, using the circuit and humidifier chamber as reservoir during exhalation. However, the reservoir advantages were predominantly with high gas flow, specifically with GF:IF > 0.5. This finding agreed with the results in our previous pediatric study [14] . With GF:IF < 0.5, the reservoir benefits were attenuated; this might be explained by the gravitational sedimentation effects, which increased as the aerosol stayed longer in the circuit and chamber due to the low flow [21, 22] . The optimal period that the aerosol stays in the circuit and chamber to generate the best inhaled dose needs to balance the reservoir benefits and the gravitational sedimentation effects, depending on the reservoir volume and the speed of the transporting gas [21, 22] . As the reservoir volume of adult HFNC system is a constant (~1000 mL in adult circuit), this optimal point depends on the transporting gas, including the HFNC gas flow and patient inspiratory flow. From our previous adult in vitro study [13] and this study, using the same adult HFNC system, we found the highest inhaled dose was generated when the GF:IF was around 0.5. The rationale of this number needs more mathematical efforts to explore in the future, but this phenomenon was also seen in both in vitro and in vivo studies with neonatal invasive ventilation that with appropriate reservoir volume and transporting gas flow, continuous VMN even the expiratory actuated VMN could generate higher inhaled dose than inspiratory actuated VMN with inappropriate reservoir volume or transporting gas flow [23, 24] . Similarly, Berlinski et al. speculated that there was an optimal bias flow setting to carry aerosol with continuous VMN placed at the inlet of humidifier during invasive ventilation [21] . In contrast, when inspiration synchronized VMN is placed at the inlet of humidifier, aerosol generated in the inhalation phase might be largely wasted, as patient might already start exhalation when the gas carries aerosol to patient. This asynchrony might be more prominent with high gas flow, which explains our finding that continuous aerosol generated higher inhaled dose than inspiration synchronized aerosol when the VMN was placed at the inlet of humidifier and with high gas flow. However, when gas flow was reduced to < 50% of patient inspiratory flow, this waste was significantly reduced. Instead, aerosol starts to be stored in the system as a bolus before the next inhalation; patient inhales the bolus of aerosol during the next inhalation [22] . Similar to continuous VMN, longer stay with lower transporting flow may cause more gravitational sedimentation; thus, the optimal stay period depends on the HFNC gas flow and patient inspiratory flow, which was found to be approximately 0.5.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 542, "end": 546, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 878, "end": 882, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1188, "end": 1192, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1695, "end": 1699, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1700, "end": 1703, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2109, "end": 2113, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2334, "end": 2338, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2339, "end": 2342, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2605, "end": 2609, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2610, "end": 2613, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2853, "end": 2857, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3420, "end": 3424, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3425, "end": 3428, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3613, "end": 3617, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 4374, "end": 4378, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Comparison of inspiration synchronized vs continuous VMN placed at different position"}, {"text": "In all, when GF:IF was > 0.5, placing inspiration synchronized VMN close to patient generated higher inhaled dose than that at the inlet of humidifier (p = 0.010); this inhaled dose was comparable to that with continuous VMN at its best position (inlet of humidifier) (p = 0.31).
