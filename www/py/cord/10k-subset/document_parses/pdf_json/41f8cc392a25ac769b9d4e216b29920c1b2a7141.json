Oxygen has been used in the treatment of pneumonia for a large part of the last century. However, the recognition of pulmonary oxygen toxicity as a problem has been relatively recent. Toxicity is related to the concentration of oxygen and length of exposure. Oxygen causes tracheobronchial irritation, reduced mucociliary function (even in healthy volunteers exposed to 90-95% oxygen for three hours 37 ) and, eventually, adsorption atelectasis, decreased vital capacity and changes similar to adult-type respiratory distress syndrome 38 . The biochemical basis is considered to be due to damage to tissues through the production of reactive oxygen species. For these reasons it is recommended that inspired oxygen concentration (FiO 2 ) should be carefully titrated against SpO 2 . However, oxygen toxicity has wider consequences, beyond the pulmonary system with animal models showing reduction coronary blood flow.

NPC requires the lowest oxygen flow rates, thus providing more reliable FiO 2 , but need careful insertion as, if misplaced, it could lead to gastric dilation or accidental dislodgement into the trachea. With NPs, a flow rate of 1-2 L/min in a child aged >4 months should provide a FiO 2 of 30-35%; however, this varies with inspiratory flow, weight and degree to which the child breathes through their mouth 51 . These are important logistical issues for optimising oxygen delivery. The most widely used method of non-invasive oxygen support is nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which has been investigated as an alternative strategy for endotracheal respiratory support in order to reduce to complications of mechanical ventilation in infants and preterm infants 52 .

Heated, humidified, high-flow (such as AirVO 2 TM ), deliver blended oxygen air at flow rates over 1 L/min through bi-nasal cannula which smaller than those of NCPAP and with prongs positioned to sit just inside the nares and do not provide a seal.

Options for supportive care in hospitals without access to mechanical ventilation are limited. At present, there is uncertainty as to what the best cutoff threshold for cost-effective oxygen delivery is and whether the addition of high flow is safe and results in improved outcome. Since hypoxaemia is so common and treatment costs and practicalities for optimal delivery of oxygen are complex, the COAST trial will contribute substantial new knowledge in this area. The COAST trial was proposed and discussed at the launch meeting of ISARIC in Annecy, July 2012. The meeting brought together many leading researchers and clinical trialists in severe respiratory illnesses with representation from international agencies, such as the WHO. The proposal had wide support as it was anticipated that the trial would result in refinements to the current WHO recommendations and provide robust evidence to support the targeting of oxygen to those with the greatest need and averting unnecessary consumption in financially constrained hospitals. The pragmatic nature of COAST and locations chosen will mean that the results of the trial will be immediately generalisable. The successful conduct of the FEAST Trial acts as a pilot for the conduct of COAST. The proposed high flow oxygen delivery device is in current use in South Africa, and feasibility testing and staff training in the COAST sites will occur before trial commencement.

As oxygen cylinders are expensive to maintain (and frequently faulty) as the source of oxygen, the WHO's preferred option is oxygen concentrators.

Only 44% reported uninterrupted oxygen supplies, 24% possessed a functioning oxygen concentrator and 35% had reliable power (Belle et al 2010; Page 5). Furthermore, most hospitals do not use pulse oximetry to target oxygen therapy, relying on clinical signs of pneumonia -which are very non-specific and thus only identify few children with hypoxaemia (Page 4). Thus, usual care is poorly targeted oxygen therapy with unreliable supplies of oxygen. The vast majority of hospitals have no access to intensive care outside of private health facilities and very few have access to CPAP or high flow/AirVO (these are largely donor driven).

The technical advisory group identified the following research low quality evidence gaps: 'clinical studies comparing outcomes when oxygen is given at different thresholds' and 'large-scale effectiveness trials of improved oxygen systems on outcomes from pneumonia'.

We do not believe that we have provided an imbalanced case for the need for a trial. A substantial section of the introduction provides substantial evidence of poor implementation and challenges faced by health services. However, even if these challenges were addressed with oxygen systems being prioritised there remains a scientific question about the role of oxygen as a life-saving drug. The data provided from the FEAST trial (control arm) and KEMRI Wellcome Trust Programme Kilifi Admission Cohort (all unselected admissions) who were all had access to oxygen and routine medications to treat underlying infections (provided by external funding) provided the data on which our sample size was calculated. These underpinned the need for a trial -even in context of a clinical trial (with very close monitoring), outcome in children with hypoxaemia was unsatisfactory (Pages 7-9).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Study Design"}, {"text": "Selecting a higher threshold for investigation (<92% rather than <90%) enables the trial to investigate whether, if oxygen therapy is beneficial, the WHO threshold should be revised to 2 investigate whether, if oxygen therapy is beneficial, the WHO threshold should be revised to include targeting a higher threshold (which is compatible with international recommendations). Logically, following on from this argument, if we had targeted < 90% and the COAST trial confirms that oxygen is life-saving then a future trial to examine whether it should be targeted to children with saturations 90-91% would require a massive trial, with little hope of securing funding.

The 48-hour endpoint was selected since it captures ~ 85% of the mortality of the COAST participants and therefore strategies to improve outcome should focus on the high risk period; where the majority of impact of a life-saving therapy is likely to occur. Currently, the standard of care is not to give high flow/AirVO therapy and, pragmatically, using high flow/AirVO over days or weeks following admission would limit the availability of the machine, and therefore the numbers that could be recruited, with little potential for added improvement in mortality. If the COAST trial were to show that AirVO therapy improved outcome at 48 hours, we would also have captured important data on the 28 day outcome of all children, which may lead to refinements in guidelines in future implementation trials (balancing efficacy over cost-effectiveness).
