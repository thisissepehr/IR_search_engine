Incidence of prematurity is increasing in the United States. 1 Respiratory distress syndrome remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants, especially in the extremely low birth weight infants <1000 g. 2 The incidence of RDS is inversely proportional to gestational age. With the increasing use of prenatal steroids, the incidence as well as the severity of RDS has decreased by nearly 50% over the last few years. 3, 4 Respiratory distress syndrome occurs in approximately 50% of preterm infants born at <30 weeks gestation, but only in about 25% of those born X30 weeks. Surfactant therapy has been shown to reduce the combined outcomes of death and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants with RDS. 5, 6 Surfactant therapy for respiratory distress syndrome Natural, modified surfactants derived from animal sources, and synthetic surfactants that are protein free, have been evaluated extensively. Exogenous synthetic surfactants studied include colfosceril palmitate (Exosurf s , (GlaxoSmithKlein, Research Triangle, NC, USA, no longer in market)), pumactant, turfsurf, and lucinactant (Surfaxin s , Discovery Laboratories, Warrington, PA, USA). Of these four synthetic surfactants, the first three are no longer available for clinical use and lucinactant is pending approval from the FDA as of 2005. Several different natural, modified surfactant preparations have been studied. They differ in composition, onset of response, and duration of action, dosing volume, and the need for additional doses. Fifteen trials 7-20 comparing natural vs synthetic surfactants (Table 1) , 21 and seven studies comparing different natural surfactants have been published (Table 2) . 21 Multiple, randomized, controlled trials have consistently shown better clinical outcomes during the acute phase of RDS, and improved survival with natural surfactants than with synthetic surfactants that lack surfactant-associated proteins, especially, surfactant protein-B (SP-B).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 278, "end": 279, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 441, "end": 442, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 654, "end": 656, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 657, "end": 658, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 953, "end": 955, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 956, "end": 957, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1831, "end": 1833, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1924, "end": 1926, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1819, "end": 1828, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1912, "end": 1921, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Bloom et al. 22 compared beractant vs calfactant in the prophylactic treatment of RDS in infants <1250 g.

Since 1999, there have been six trials [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] evaluating the outcome of early surfactant therapy followed by extubation to NCPAP (Table 3) . Overall, these reports demonstrated decreased duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay, and decreased need for additional doses of surfactant. In a recent study by the Texas Neonatal Research Group, 35 rescue surfactant therapy in the more, mature preterm population (birth weight X1250 g) with mild to moderate RDS not requiring mechanical ventilation showed no benefits following routine elective intubation for surfactant administration when compared to expectant management with intubation and surfactant treatment as clinically indicated. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of early surfactant therapy followed by extubation to NCPAP or nasal ventilation on the incidence of BPD. Use of NCPAP with or without surfactant therapy was shown to be consistently associated with a lower incidence of classical as well as the newly defined 'physiological' BPD. 36 Surfactant therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is not an uncommon cause of respiratory failure in near-term and term newborns admitted to neonatal intensive care units. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is often secondary to meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), congenital pneumonia, sepsis-induced ARDS, viral pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage and partial or complete deficiency of SP-B. In these conditions, surfactant inactivation or dysfunction has been shown to be a major factor. Major mechanisms of surfactant inactivation in ARDS include decreased synthesis and secretion of surfactant by the type II pneumocytes, decrease in surface active small aggregates of surfactant in the alveoli, and direct inhibition of surfactant function by substances like meconium, blood, serum proteins or proteinaceous edema fluid. 37 Exogenous surfactant therapy has been shown to be beneficial 70% of the time in patients with ARDS. 38 In a randomized, controlled trial using beractant in forty newborns with MAS, Findley et al. 39 demonstrated a significant reduction in the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. Lotze et al. 40 performed a large, multicenter study in 328 term newborns with ARDS secondary to MAS, sepsis-induced ARDS or persistent pulmonary hypertension. They showed a significant reduction in the need for ECMO in patients with MAS and sepsis-related ARDS. They also showed that surfactant therapy was more beneficial when used early and in patients with an oxygenation index of <23. In a meta-analysis of data from these two studies, relative risk for ECMO therapy was significantly reduced to 0.64 (95% confidence intervals 0.46, 0.91). 41 Eight, non-randomized studies using different surfactants have also been reported. Most of these studies used bolus surfactant therapy in an attempt to overcome the inactivation of endogenous surfactant. Three of the studies used either saline lavage followed by surfactant therapy or lavage using a dilute surfactant solution. In all these studies, there was improvement in oxygenation following surfactant therapy. No adverse effects were reported. In a multicenter study, Wiswell et al. 42 examined the use of surfactant lavage for MAS using lucinactant, a synthetic surfactant. Although it was potentially safe and effective, lucinactant failed to show a significant advantage with surfactant lavage. The researchers were able to recruit only 15 patients in the surfactant group and seven patients served as controls.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 235, "end": 239, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 240, "end": 244, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 245, "end": 249, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 250, "end": 254, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 255, "end": 259, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 260, "end": 264, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 572, "end": 574, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1248, "end": 1250, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2127, "end": 2129, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2230, "end": 2232, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2326, "end": 2328, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2447, "end": 2449, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2979, "end": 2981, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 3472, "end": 3474, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 348, "end": 357, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Surfactant therapy and nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP)"}, {"text": "In preterm infants with group B streptococcal pneumonia, different surfactant preparations have been shown to be effective. 38 Newborns with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) have been shown to have surfactant abnormalities.

Furthermore, early rescue (<30 min of age) surfactant therapy, followed by rapid extubation to NCPAP or nasal ventilation should be considered to minimize lung injury and BPD. In nearterm or term newborns with ARDS secondary to MAS, sepsis induced ARDS, aspiration pneumonia, bacterial or viral pneumonia, and in patients with pulmonary hemorrhage, surfactant therapy appears to be beneficial. A dose of 50 to 100 mg/ kg administered at 6 to 12 h intervals may be appropriate. Surfactant containing higher amounts of saturated phosphatidyl choline and SP-B, such as poractant alfa, may be preferable over other surfactants. However, no randomized trials comparing different surfactants in ARDS have been reported. Bolus instillation of surfactant or mini-saline lavage using 3 to 5 ml/kg, followed by bolus surfactant therapy appears to be well tolerated and effective in near-term and term newborns with ARDS.
