B lymphocytes preferentially maintain EBV genome in a nonreplicating, latent form. 18 In the normal host, primary infection results in a transient lymphoproliferative disorder commonly known as infectious mononucleosis. The immune response to EBV is both humoral and cellular. The humoral response is useful for the diagnosis of EBV initial infection and antibodies to EBV proteins have neutralizing properties. These antibodies may also render infected individuals immune to further infection with exogenously transmitted virus, although this is likely aided by further cellular immune-mediated responses as well. 19, 20 Control of EBV-infected B-cell proliferation is largely mediated through natural killer, CD4 \u00fe , and CD8 \u00fe cytotoxic T cells. 21 After recovery, HLA-restricted cytotoxic T cells play an important role in controlling EBV reactivation. 22 Cytotoxic T cells undergo antigen-driven polyclonal expansion of up to 30% of cells. Resting memory B cells form the reservoir through which the virus persists throughout life in its host. In the immunocompromised host, suppression by cytotoxic lymphocytes is hampered or unavailable, leading to unchecked replication of B lymphocytes. This replication can behave in a malignant fashion, either leading to invasive polyclonal B-cell hyperplasia or to a monoclonal proliferation of lymphomatous B cells. 23 EBV-LPD is well recognized as a consequence of immunosuppressive therapy after solid organ transplantation. 24 The first reports of post-BMT EBV-LPD were in leukemic patients who received allogeneic transplants; these patients had developed graft-versus-host disease treated with anti-T-cell monoclonal antibodies, 25 once more leading to severely decreased ability to curb EBV-transformed Table 2 Patients treated on CHP-594 and CHP-667 studies   Study  Neuroblastoma  Ewing sarcoma  Other sarcoma  Total  Unselected PBSC  CD34+ PBSCT  EBV-LPD   594  97  23  8  128  47  81  2  667  22  6  0  28  1  27  3  Both studies  119  29  8  156  48  108  5  EBV-LPD  5  0  0  5  0  5   Table 3 Lymphocyte recovery post stem cell transplantation (/ml blood) cells.

Our experience suggests that early diagnosis followed by prompt initiation of rituximab therapy may successfully manage EBV-LPD. The current Children's Oncology Group phase III study A3973 will answer the question of whether purging tumor cells from PBSC products impacts the outcome in children with neuroblastoma. If purging does improve EFS, then the use of CD34 selection in the setting of tandem PBSCT may best be pursued with strategies to improve immune reconstitution, such as a plan to return T cells to the patient. 40 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 814, "end": 816, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title":
