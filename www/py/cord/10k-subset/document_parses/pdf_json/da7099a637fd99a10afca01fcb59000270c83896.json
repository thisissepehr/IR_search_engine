Infectious diseases remain the third leading cause of death in the United States. 1 Pharmacists with specialized infectious diseases training have become an integral part of many health care facilities, as they can optimize the management of health care resources and help reduce the spread of antimicrobial resistance. The role of the infectious diseases clinical pharmacist in improving health outcomes has been well documented, 2,3 and the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America guidelines for developing an institutional program to enhance antimicrobial stewardship recognize the clinical pharmacist with training in infectious diseases as a core member of a multidisciplinary antimicrobial stewardship team. 4 What is an infectious diseases pharmacy residency? An infectious diseases pharmacy residency is designed to prepare graduates to participate as \"integral members of interdisciplinary teams car-ing for patients with infectious diseases, assuming responsibility for their pharmaceutical care.\" 5 Because infectious diseases pharmacy residency programs are specialty or postgraduate year 2 (PGY2) residency programs, they are designed to build on the competencies established in postgraduate year 1 (PGY1) residency training and produce a well-rounded practitioner to care for patients with infectious diseases. Recent changes in the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) standards require that PGY2 resident applicants have completed a PGY1 residency program. 6 Infectious diseases pharmacy residency educational outcomes, goals, and instructional objectives have also changed significantly since 1998, when the goals and objectives were last revised. These changes were based on expectations as to where infectious pharmacy practice is moving in the future and the Institute of Medicine report entitled Health Professions Education: A Bridge to Quality, which cited competencies that should be shared by all health care professionals. 5 Infectious diseases pharmacy residents receive training for at least 12 months. The core competencies ensure that residents have adequate knowledge of infectious diseases and their treatment and can make patientspecific decisions using evidencebased therapeutic regimens and optimal dosing and can monitor the safety and efficacy of the selected treatment. Residents also develop leadership skills to make formulary decisions for antiinfectives, conduct research related to infectious diseases (including medication-use evaluations), educate other health care professionals on infectious disease top-",

Other learning experiences may include working in an ambulatory care AIDS clinic, a bone marrow transplantation service, an infection control service, an infectious diseases consultation service serving pediatric patients, an inpatient AIDS service, or a medical oncology and hematology service.
