The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an adaptive mechanism to refold unfolded and misfolded proteins in the ER. Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), a representative ER chaperone, confers protection against stressors by mediating this refolding. However, if ER stress is not resolved by adaptive UPR signaling, ER stress-dependent apoptotic signaling pathways are activated, such as phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and induction of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP) 24, 25 . Therefore, the ER stress response is implicated in several diseases, such as cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and lung diseases 24, 26 . Recent studies showed that LPS induced increases in various ER stress markers in the lung, and inhibition of ER stress ameliorated LPS-induced lung inflammation 27, 28 .

As shown in Figs 3 and 4, carnosine administration inhibited LPS-induced neutrophilic inflammation. Furthermore, as shown in Figs 5 and 6, carnosine administration inhibited the LPS-dependent ER stress response. ROS are reportedly thought to induce neutrophilic inflammation and the ER stress response 19, 24, 26, 36 . For example, extracellular superoxide induces NETs, and treatment with diphenyleneiodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, inhibits this NETs induction 40 . Regarding ER stress, cigarette smoke extract induces the apoptosis of bronchial epithelial cells through a superoxide anion-triggered signaling pathway mediated by protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase-eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha kinase (PERK-eIF2a, one of the ER stress sensors) 41 . We showed that carnosine administration suppressed the LPS-dependent ROS increase in lung tissue (Fig. 2) . Considering these results, we suggest that carnosine suppressed both neutrophilic inflammation and the ER stress response by suppressing LPS-dependent ROS increases.",

Moreover, mechanical ventilation (MV), a life-saving intervention for ARDS patients, also causes ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), which increases mortality 43 . ROS have been shown to play a major role in sepsis and VILI in both clinical and animal models. In contrast, carnosine administration clearly suppressed the LPS-dependent ROS increase (Fig. 2) . Although we have not examined the effects of carnosine in mice subjected to CLP or MV, we assume that carnosine administration may have preventive effects against CLP-or MV-induced lung injury by suppressing the associated ROS increases. Considering the clinical application of carnosine, it is important to examine the effect of carnosine after the onset of lung injury, and the effect of carnosine on prognosis. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S3 , even when carnosine was administered after LPS, carnosine suppressed the LPS-induced increase in the number of neutrophils and the protein concentration in BALF. Intratracheal administration of LPS and hydrochloric acid, a newly reported ARDS-related model 44 , as shown in Supplementary Fig. S4 , this was lethal to mice, but carnosine administration increased their survival rate (P = 0.036). These results support our view that carnosine has the beneficial effects for preventing ARDS development.",

For example, Cu/Zn-SOD or lecithinized Cu/Zn-SOD administration is also protective in ARDS-related animal models 48, 49 . The new vitamin E derivative, ETS-GS, protected against CLP-induced systemic inflammation in rats 50 . Early administration of lipoic acid provided protective effects against LPS-induced oxidative stress in the lung 51 . Moreover, simvastatin reduced LPS-induced lung injury by decreasing neutrophil recruitment and radical formation 52 . Some investigations suggested beneficial effects of statins therapy in patients with sepsis and ARDS 53,54 , although stains have not been approved for this use. Therefore, it is necessary to compare the protective effects of carnosine against LPS-induced lung injury with those of other antioxidant molecules. Furthermore, combination effects of other antioxidants with carnosine have been reported in other organs. For example, carnosine plus vitamin E treatment more strongly suppressed LPS-induced liver injury compared with carnosine or vitamin E alone 55 . Moreover, \u03b1 -lipoic acid and carnosine supplementation increased antioxidant activity in the serum, liver and skin of rats 56 . Examining combination effects of other antioxidants with carnosine in the LPS-induced lung injury model would be highly worthwhile.",

We used an imaging system (Lumazone in vivo imaging system; Shoshin Em, Okazaki, Japan), which contains a chamber equipped with an electron-multiplying CCD camera. Mice were intravenously administered with the luminescent probe, L-012, in saline (75 mg/kg). At 5 min after the L-012 injection, mice were euthanized and the lungs were rapidly dissected and imaged (5 min exposure). All data were analyzed using SlideBook 6 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc., Denver, CO).",

Mice were orally administered with carnosine (Car; 100 mg/kg) or saline (Vehicle), immediately before and 24 h after LPS administration. Sections of pulmonary tissue were prepared 48 h after LPS administration. Sections were subjected to the TUNEL assay and DAPI staining (scale bar, 100 \u03bc m) (a). The numbers of TUNEL-positive cells were counted (b). A549 cells were incubated with menadione (Mena, 4 \u03bc M) for 24 h in the presence of the indicated concentrations (mM) of carnosine (Car). Viable cell numbers were determined using a WST-based cell counting kit (c) or CellTiter-Glo \u00ae 2.0 (d). Values are mean \u00b1 S.E.M.; ** or ## P < 0.01 (b: *, vs Control; #, vs Vehicle, c,d: # vs menadione). Scientific RepoRts | 7:42813 | DOI: 10.1038/srep42813",
