This comparison was based upon the electrophoretic analysis of T1 oligonucleotides from single-stranded, full-leng~,h R, NA isolated from cytoplasmic nucleoeapsids. Although all viruses have oligonucleotides in common, each isolate generated a unique pattern of oligonucleotides. However, no group of oligonucleotides was observed which would allow a differentiation between viruses isolated from acute infections and those isolated from CNS diseases; indicating that probably all measles viruses differ in their nueleotide sequence, regardless of origin.",

            "text": "Measles virus is an ubiquitous and highly contagious agent which infects man and also primates in close contact with man. The disease usually occurs during childhood, and normally causes a relatively mild stereotyped infection. In a few cases, a more serious complication can arise which may include acute encephalitis. In addition to this disorder another CNS disease (subaeute selerosing panencephalitis --SSPE) has been associated with measles virus infection (1--3) . This association has led to many studies on the possible biochemical and antigenic differences betweea measles and SSPE viruses. Several reports demonstrate differences in etectrophoretic mobility between the proteins of measles and SSPE viruses, especially between the P and M proteins (4--6) however the variation found between SSPE and measles isolates was of the same order as that found among the measles isolates themselves (5) . Furthermore, little or no difference has been found in the antigenieity of these viruses when assayed by neutrali-zation, haemolysin inhibition, haemagglutination inhibition (7) . Moreover, all major virus-specific polypeptides from either measles of SSPE viruses can be precipitated equally well by either homologous or heterologous r a b b i t sera (8) . However, b y using short-term i m m u n i z a t i o n schedules with purified protein, antigenic differences were reported between the M protein of one SSPE isolate a n d one measles isolate (9) . I n addition, recent, studies using monoclonal antibodies against measles virus haemagglutinin have demonstrated antigenic differences between several measles and SSPE isolates (10) , b u t no characteristics, specific for SSPE isolates were observed. I n addition a t t e m p t s have been made to analyse the sequence homology between the RNAs of measles and SSPE viruses. YI~H (11) and HALL a n d TE]~ MEULEN (12) reported only 60 and 90 per cent homology respectively between I~NAs from measles and SSPE isolates.",

I t was not possible to co-electrophorese the digests of two or more isolates for this comparison, as the large n u m b e r of oligonueleotides in one gel would preclude an accurate analysis of the p a t t e r n thus obtained. As seen in Fig. 2 , the a p p a r e n t m o l a r i t y of the larger oligonueleotides is not uniform. This is assumed to be either the result of the co-migration of 2 or more oligonucleotides or an effect of the seconda~\" structure of the oligonucleotides affecting the relative efficiency of the kinase reaction. Similar observations have been noted when the genomes of several R N A viruses were analysed b y this method (2I). Also the mobility and relative concentration of the smaller oligonueleotides differs in some aspects from t h a t obtained from in vivo labelled I~NA molecules. I t is presumed t h a t this loss of small oligonucleotides from the digest occured during the ethanol precipitation step, and is also a result of the decrease in the concentration of bisaerylamide in the second dimension of P A G E , which was introduced in order to facilitate the drying of the gels. However, these observations were judged not to affect the v a l i d i t y of the conclusions as identical results were obtained from duplicate or triplicate preparations from each isolate; and identical p a t t e r n s were also obtained when R N A s from different passage numbers of the same isolate were compared. Table 2 summarizes the main differences and similarities between the various isolates examined. Thus it can be demonstrated that all isolates examined show clear differences, even though they appear virtually identical when examined by classical serology. Although 8 oligonucleotides were common to all isolates examined, none were found to be specific for SSPE isolates or for measles isolates. Similarly none were found to be characteristic for all isolates from cases of encephalitis. If the total number of characteristic changes (i.e. the sum of the oligonueleotides shown to be specific for an isolate and the oligonucleotides specifically absent in an isolate) observed in individual isolates are compared, no clear distinctions can be made between isolates from acute cases of measles acute encephalitis or SSPE. In addition, when the LEC isolate of SSPE was compared to either the Edmonston strain of measles vaccine (J. 1~. SWEPHENSO~ and V. TER MEULEN, unpublished observations) or to another isolate from acute measles, WOODFOLK (22) , again no clear differences were found in the oligonucleotide maps to distinguish SSPE isolates from measles isolates.",

However, as such material can contain significant amounts of cellular ribosomal RNA, messenger RNA and DNA, a purification scheme was devised to minimise the possibility of contamination from these cellular components. The nueteoeapsids were therefore purified by eentrifugation under conditions which ensured that all ribosomes, ribosomal subunits, messenger RNP, and nuclei were pelleted, while the viral nucleocapsids remained suspended at the sucrose interface. Nueleocapsid RNA prepared from such material contained no detectable amounts of ribosomal or transfer RNA when centrifugated on a sucrose gradient and scanned at 0.D260. In addition, when in vitro-labelled oligonucleotides from nucleoeapsid RNA were compared to those oligonucleotides from 28 S ribosomal RNA, no similarities were observed (data not shown). Thus indicating that no contaminating 28S ribosomal I~NA could be detected in RNA isolated from viral nueleocapsids. Furthermore, 48S nucleocapsid RNA did not bind to oligo dT cellulose nor was it capable of stimulating protein synthesis when added to a nuclease-trcated cell-free system from rabbit reticulocytes. A further complication of using infected cell material is that a significant proportion of the nucleocapsid RNA consists of subgenomic species (18, 19) . These species appear to have been successfully removed by sedimentation on sucrose gradients. Also in infected cells, both positive and negative strands are necessary for the replication of paramyxoviruses (20) , and can contaminate preparations of 48S I%NA from infected cells. These positive strands have been removed b y allowing the R N A to self hybridize and then separating the excess single-strands b y differential ethanol precipitation.
