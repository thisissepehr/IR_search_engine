These markers have been demonstrated to be promising for identifying cultivars and determining the purity of genetic strains of pea. Genetic relationships between strains, cultivars, and mutants of pea have been studied. The role of molecular markers in molecular genetic mapping and localizing the genes of commercially important characters of pea has been shown. The possibility of the use of molecular markers for studying somaclonal variation and detecting mutagenic factors in plants during long-term spaceflights is considered. The prospects of using DNA markers for understanding the organization and variability of higher plant genomes are discussed.",

This method is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with arbitrary single primers nine to ten nitrous bases in length with a predominantly G/C composition (60-80%) and relatively low annealing temperatures. Usually, RAPD primers yield three to fifteen amplification products [3] . The DNA regions amplified by the RAPD method are scattered over the genome; most of them are repetitive nucleotide sequences [2] . This method has the advantage of technical simplicity and rapidness. It requires neither information on the DNA sequence nor large initial amounts of DNA [4, 5] . The method does not use radioactive substances, is inexpensive, and can be automated [6] .",

The amplified DNA fragments are located within a relatively small region between two microsatellite sequences. The repetitive units comprise one to five nucleotide pairs. The method does not require preliminary information on the DNA sequence analyzed [7, 8] . The PCR using ISSR primers yields a set of intermicrosatellite DNA fragments of various lengths. The ISSR analysis has as high a resolution as the RAPD method while ensuring better reproducibility of the spectrum (since the primer is longer and complementary to the microsatellite region).

It had a resolution of 12.6 cM and a total length of 1262 cM (Fig. 3) . About 46% of the intervals of this map were shorter than 10 cM, and only 17% were longer than 25 cM. This map of linkage groups of the pea genome contains no fewer molecular markers than the maps constructed previously, and permits localizing new loci determining important qualitative and quantitative characters of pea. Some of the markers that we mapped were previously used by other authors [38, 39] ; therefore, we compared the genetic map obtained in this study with versions published earlier [41, 42] .",

The set of markers of this type is highly reproducible; hence, it can serve as a universal system for localizing new genes that can be used in any laboratory. If necessary, all cases of nucleotide substitution can be detected in automated systems for rapid genotyping by the microarray method [43] . To date, nine new CAPS markers have been created and localized. They have been integrated into the genetic linkage map along with ten markers from the study [40] (the polymorphism of the strains used with respect to these markers was described for the first time in [31] ). The development of the set of CAPS markers for localizing genes throughout linkage group III has been almost completed (unpublished data). The information on all CAPS markers, including the table of their allelic states in different strains and cultivars, is inputted into a database, which facilitates the exchange of information between research groups. The development of genetic maps of pea saturated with markers serves as the basis for planning applied studies on the genetics and breeding of important cultivated plants. The use of molecular markers for fine genetic mapping of pea chromosomes makes it possible to combine molecular and genetic maps and approach cloning and sequencing of individual genes of pea determining its commercially valuable characters.",

In this method, mixtures of DNAs obtained from several representatives of segregating plant populations are used as matrices for RAPD analysis. To create two such mixtures, DNAs from several plants phenotypically differing in one binary character and homozygous for the locus determining this character are used; therefore, these mixture differ from each other only with respect to the genomic region studied. Therefore, all polymorphic products revealed by RAPD analysis must pertain to the DNA region linked to the gene studied.
