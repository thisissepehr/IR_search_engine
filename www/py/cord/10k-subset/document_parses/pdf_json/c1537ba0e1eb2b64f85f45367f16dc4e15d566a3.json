Using a genome-wide screening strategy, we identified the plasma membrane calcium ATPase isoform 2 (PMCA2) as a potential downstream target of the CaR. We show that PMCA2 expression in the mouse mammary gland increases during lactation and that PMCA2 is localized solely to the apical plasma membrane of mammary epithelial cells. In milk from deafwaddler mice, which have mutations in the gene encoding PMCA2, calcium concentrations were reduced, confirming its importance in calcium transport into milk. Furthermore, in cultured primary and EpH4 mouse mammary epithelial cells, CaR stimulation up-regulated calcium-dependent ATPase ac-tivity in plasma membrane preparations. By small interfering RNA-mediated gene knockdown of PMCA2, we show that PMCA2 accounts for the preponderance of calcium-ATPase activity. We also show that reduction of CaR expression with small interfering RNA eliminates the ability of extracellular calcium to elicit an increase in calcium-dependent ATPase activity in EpH4 cell membranes. These results demonstrate that activation of the CaR increases PMCA2 activity in mouse mammary epithelial cells, providing a mechanism for the regulation of transepithelial calcium transport by calcium in the lactating mouse mammary gland.

To supply enough calcium in milk, mammary epithelial cells (MECs) must transport large amounts against a steep concentration gradient over an extended time period. Furthermore, despite the large throughput of calcium, MECs must maintain low cytoplasmic free calcium concentrations to avoid toxicity. There is no paracellular passage of calcium into milk (1, 2) . Rather, it is secreted from MECs through a transepithelial process. Little is known about the entry of calcium into MECs, although it has been suggested that a stretch-activated channel may be involved (2, 3) . Once in the epithelial cell, calcium has been thought to be pumped into the Golgi in an ATP-dependent fashion, where it becomes associated with caseins, citrate, phosphate, and other calcium-binding molecules (1, 2) . The majority of milk calcium is bound to caseins (1), phosphoproteins that form large, highly organized macromolecular micelles in the presence of calcium (4) . Therefore, the widely held view has been that calcium enters milk through the secretory pathway primarily contained within casein micelles and that little or no free calcium is transported directly across the apical membrane (1, 5) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 489, "end": 492, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 493, "end": 495, "text": "2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 700, "end": 703, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 704, "end": 706, "text": "3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 918, "end": 921, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 922, "end": 924, "text": "2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1082, "end": 1085, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1313, "end": 1316, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1317, "end": 1319, "text": "5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "There is relatively little information regarding the identity of specific molecules responsible for calcium transport in MECs.

Therefore, the Ca-dependent ATPase activity we observed in the plasma membrane preparations reflects PMCA function. As shown in Fig. 7 , A and B, increasing the extracellular calcium concentration from 0.1 to 1 or 10 mm significantly increased Ca-ATPase activity in both primary MECs and EpH4 cells. Ca-ATPase activity also increased significantly in response to gadolinium, a CaR agonist (25) , suggesting that the CaR is responsible for the extracellular calcium-induced increase in Ca-ATPase activity. We next sought to confirm that the Ca-ATPase activity that we measured in the plasma membranes of mammary cells was due to PMCA2 by knocking down its expression with oligonucleotide siRNAs. We were able to transfect EpH4 cells with fluorescently labeled siRNAs at a high efficiency (Fig. 7C) . However, we could not efficiently transfect primary cultures of mouse MECs with siRNAs. Therefore, subsequent knockdown experiments were performed only in EpH4 cells.

To confirm that the CaR mediated the regulation of PMCA2 activity by extracellular calcium in these cells, we also employed siRNAs specific to the CaR to knock down its expression by 80% (Fig. 7D ).

Little PMCA2 is expressed in the nulliparous mammary gland, but mRNA levels increase by over 100-fold in the lactating gland, matching the timing for the greatly increased demand for calcium transport capacity. The mammary gland expresses only PMCA2w splice variants, which are predicted to traffic to the apical rather than the basolateral membranes of MECs. We confirmed the apical location of PMCA2 by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, suggesting that calcium is actively pumped across the apical membrane. PMCA2 is clearly necessary for calcium transport into milk, because loss-of-function mutations in the Atp2b2 gene in the two deaf-waddler strains deplete milk calcium. Complete loss of function of PMCA2 in the Dfw-2J strain causes a 70% reduction in calcium content.

Given their results, the results of our genomic survey and our finding of a reduction in milk calcium in two additional, independent genetic models of loss of PMCA2 function, it can be concluded with some certainty that PMCA2 is responsible for transporting the majority of calcium found in milk. Furthermore, our immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy studies clearly establish that PMCA2 is found in the apical membrane of mammary cells. Importantly, we did not find evidence for significant amounts of PMCA2 concentrated within the Golgi or secretory vesicle membranes. Therefore, most of the calcium entering milk must do so directly from the cytoplasm across the apical membrane and not through the secretory pathway as previously believed (1, 40) . Some calcium does enter the Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and secretory vesicles to participate in casein micelle formation, because SERCAs and SPCAs are expressed within the lactating gland (10, 12) , and deletion of PMCA2 does not eliminate all calcium transport in either the PMCA2 \u03ea/\u03ea (13) or Dfw-2J mice. However, transit of calcium through the secretory pathway is quantitatively less important than apical transport, and we suggest a new working model of calcium transport into milk as illustrated in Fig. 8 . The nature of the calcium entry thorough the basolateral membrane remains unclear, although as mentioned before, prior evidence implicates a stretch-activated calcium channel (2, 3).

Second, it has previously been reported that Na/Ca exchange is not important to transepithelial calcium transport in MECs (5), and expression of NCX1 (Slc8a1) did not increase during lactation in our microarray data. Finally, in the intestine, kidney, and salivary gland, calbindins serve to limit the free intracellular calcium in transit through the cytoplasm (41) . However, calbindin expression in MECs does not increase during lactation (Table 2) , raising the question as to how free calcium is sequestered within MECs and how it reaches PMCA2 on the apical surface. Calcium is likely removed from the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi through the actions of SERCA2, SPCA1, and SPCA2 (10, 12) . In pancreatic acinar cells, it has been suggested that after being pumped from the cytoplasm by SERCAs, calcium can transit or tunnel though the endoplasmic reticulum network from the basal surface of the cell to the apical surface.

Mechanisms leading to calcium entry through the basolateral membrane are unknown but may involve the action of a stretch-activated calcium channel. Once inside the cell, calcium is pumped into the ER by SERCAs or the Golgi by SPCAs or is bound by cytosolic calcium-binding proteins. Some calcium transits through the secretory pathway, takes part in casein micelle formation, and is secreted into milk by exocytosis. However, the majority of calcium moves to the apical plasma membrane where it is pumped directly into milk from the cytoplasm by PMCA2bw. Calcium may reach the apical surface of the cell by traveling through the cytoplasm bound to buffering proteins, or it may transit the endoplasmic reticulum and be released back into the cytoplasm in proximity to PMCA2bw. Once it crosses the apical membrane, calcium then equilibrates with caseins, phosphate, and citrate, so that ionized calcium represents only 10 -30% of total milk calcium.
