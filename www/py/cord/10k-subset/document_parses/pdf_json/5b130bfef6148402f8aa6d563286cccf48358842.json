Recently two procedures have been developed to recover the time-dependent transmission function, \u03b2(t), for classical disease models given the disease incidence data. We first review the \u03b2(t) recovery procedures and give the resulting formulas, using both methods, for the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and susceptible-exposedinfected-recovered (SEIR) models. We present a modification of one procedure, which is then shown to be identical to the other. Second, we explore several technical issues that appear when implementing the procedure for the SIR model; these are important when generating the time-dependent transmission function for real-world disease data. Third, we extend the recovery method to heterogeneous populations modeled with a certain SIR-type model with multiple time-dependent transmission functions. Finally, we apply the \u03b2(t) recovery procedure to data from the 2002-2003 influenza season and for the six seasons from 2002-2003 through 2007-2008, for both one population class and for two age classes. We discuss the consequences of the technical conditions of the procedure applied to the influenza data. We show that the method is robust in the heterogeneous cases, producing comparable results under two different hypotheses.

The procedure should be explored for more models, including for heterogenous populations. General conditions should be found for which classes of models the procedure applies to and which it does not. Second, we have provided graphs on the time to failure of Conditions 1 and 2 for the verifiable example using the SIR model (Fig. 2) . The resulting \"time to failure\" graphs are intriguing and deserve further study. And third, further work needs to be done with real-world infection data.
