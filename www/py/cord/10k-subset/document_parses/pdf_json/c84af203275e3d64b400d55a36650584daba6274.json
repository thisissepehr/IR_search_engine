The common causes can be classified into three classes: infection; autoimmune disease (giant cell myocarditis, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Churg-Strauss syndrome, and mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome) and drug hypersensitivity; and poisons or toxic drug effects. Infections cause the majority of cases of myocarditis with the most common pathogens being viruses, including enteroviruses (especially Coxsackie B virus), adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and influenza virus. There are usually three clinical stages of myocarditis: the acute phase, subacute phase, and chronic phase. The acute phase lasts for 3-5 days, during which active viral replication and invasion severely damage the myocardium. Immunological reaction plays a major role in the subacute phase, and only a few patients eventually enter the chronic phase. In this phase, patients may suffer from chronic, persistent, but sudden aggravated inflammatory reactions as well as decreased contractility, myocardial fibrosis, and cardiomegaly (Caforio et al., 2013; Fung et al., 2016; Pollack et al., 2015) .

All these complications can result in a high mortality rate at the early stage of the disease (Ginsberg and Parrillo, 2013; Gupta et al., 2008; Maisch et al., 2014; McCarthy et al., 2000) . Viral infection may be the most common cause of fulminant myocarditis, while other causes such as autoimmune diseases, hypersensitivity, or drug-induced fulminant myocarditis are rare. However, no distinguishing histological and pathological difference can be found between fulminant myocarditis and common viral myocarditis. Thus, fulminant myocarditis can be considered to be a clinical rather than a pathophysiological diagnosis. It is thought that when acute myocarditis shows a rapid onset and dramatically accelerated progress and a situation arises where patients with severe heart failure, hypotension, or cardiogenic shock must receive positive inotropic drugs and vasoactive agents or mechanical circulation assist device to maintain or save life, the condition may be called fulminant myocarditis. It is noteworthy that although fulminant myocarditis has a high early mortality, if patients can survive through the acute phase, they will have a good long-term prognosis, similar to healthy persons (McCarthy et al., 2000) . An 11-year follow-up study revealed that patients suffering from fulminant myocarditis have higher survival rates than those with common myocarditis (93% vs. 45%), and there was no difference in long-term survival between patients with fulminant myocarditis and healthy people (McCarthy et al., 2000) . This suggests that patients who suffer from fulminant myocarditis are often healthy young adults. Besides, fulminant myocarditis has a higher incidence rate during the winter and spring seasons. Although fulminant myocarditis has a higher prevalence rate among young adults and children, it can attack people at any age with no difference between genders. Prolonged tiredness or exhaustion may contribute to its occurrence.

Among detectable viruses, the most common are Coxsackie B virus, adenovirus, and influenza virus. Contemporary rates of infection with influenza virus, especially highly-pathogenic strains, are very high. The pathophysiology of myocardial injury includes direct damage by the virus and damage caused by the immune reaction and cytokines. Direct damage is more common in newborns, while, in contrast, immunogenic injury is the major factor in adults.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 219, "end": 241, "text": "(Caforio et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 242, "end": 262, "text": "Maisch et al., 2014;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 263, "end": 284, "text": "Pollack et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathophysiology of fulminant myocarditis"}, {"text": "(1) Direct injury: Intracellular viral replication in the myocardium and other tissues, results in degeneration, necrosis, and dysfunction.

Cytokines will also be released from myocardium and damage other cells and organs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mechanisms of myocardial injury"}, {"text": "(2) Immunogenic injury: On the one hand, cytokines re-leased from cells injured by viral infection will cause inflammatory edema. On the other hand, due to the recruitment effects of cytokines, inflammatory cells such as mononuclear macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils will infiltrate the matrix. The myocardium thus is damaged as a result of the ensuing cytotoxic and antigen-antibody reaction. In response to viral infection, the cellular and humoral immune response will stimulate infiltrative inflammatory and tissue cells to release a substantial cascade of cytokines, such as interleukin-1 or -6 (IL-1; IL-6), endothelial adhesion molecules, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) among others. These cytokines will damage the myocardium as well as other tissues. In addition, the cytokines activate leukocytes to form complexes with platelets, which will cause the formation of thrombus, diffuse intravascular coagulation, and stimulate leukocyte migration to tissues. Direct viral injury of the myocardium in fulminant myocarditis is indeed severe; however, abnormal activation of the immune system and excessive macrophage polarization and accumulation in tissues or organs can cause indirect injury and is an important pathophysiological of rapid progression. It must be kept in mind that fulminant myocarditis does not only center around myocardial injury; viral invasion, cytokine release, and the immune reaction but can also cause multiple organ lesions throughout the body. Fulminant myocarditis is a systemic disease that mainly affects the myocardium and cardiac reactions are the most noticeable. The heart will suffer predominantly, and this is the cause of hemodynamic dysfunction and death. Therefore, pump dysfunction due to heart lesions determines the severity and high mortality of fulminant myocarditis. The use of a cardiac pump and mechanical circulation support, such as intraaortic balloons (IABP), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), decides the final outcome in patients. Meanwhile, protective and replacement treatment targeted at other impaired organs, such as hemodialysis and respirator assisted ventilation, are important in helping patients survive through the acute phase of fulminant myocarditis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mechanisms of myocardial injury"}, {"text": "Myocardial edema, apoptosis, necrosis, and inflammatory cell infiltration are the major pathological changes observed in fulminant myocarditis. According to the different types of infiltrating cells, we can classify fulminant myocarditis into neutrophilic, lymphatic, acidophilic, or giant cell myocarditis. It is thought that extensive myocardial necrosis and over 50 infiltrated inflammatory cells per millimeter squared of myocardium can be observed in fulminant myocarditis. However, the relationship between pathological changes and severity of clinic manifestation is not linear. Some patients may have severe clinical manifestations but do not display corresponding pathological changes. Therefore, fulminant myocarditis is more likely a clinical diagnosis. In addition, another important feature of fulminant myocarditis is that while it exhibits a quite severe manifestation during the acute phase, patients who successfully survive this phase will have a good outcome.

Different types of arrhythmia may also occur and threaten patients' lives. Respiratory, liver, and kidney failure may further worsen patients' conditions.

Symptoms of shock such as skin clamminess, pallor, cyanosis, patch pattern changes of the skin, and even disturbances of consciousness can also be present. A few patients will have fainting episodes, syncope, or sudden death. Importantly, among the three basic determinants of cardiac output (CO; myocardium contractility, preload, and afterload), failure of heart pump function is responsible for hypotension in patients with fulminant myocarditis (e.g., those with cardiogenic shock) while blood volume and vascular resistance are only minor factors. Since patients with fulminant myocarditis usually have no underlying cardiac diseases, their heart sizes are usually normal, and they simply suffer from a marked diffuse decrease in myocardial contractility and a reduction in the cardiac ejection fraction. The importance of the severity of myocardium injury to hypotension and cardiac shock is often ignored.

Dysfunctions of these organs are partly secondary to cardiac injury (shock), but viral invasion and immunological injury play important roles.

Recently, a multicenter controlled study of 41 acute myocarditis patients carried out in Japan indicated that large doses of IVIG (1-2 g kg -1 for 2 days) can clearly improve one-month mortality rates (20.0% in treatment group vs. 34.6% in control group, P<0.01). Furthermore, circulating cytokines such as TNF and IL-6 also decreased significantly (P<0.01) (Kishimoto et al., 2014) .

Treatment with IVIG should be administered in sufficient doses as early as possible. A retrospective analysis published in 2015 did not report a survival benefit for IVIG use in hospitalized fulminant myocarditis (Isogai et al., 2015) . However, on closer examination we find that patients in the treatment group did not receive a sufficiently high dose of IVIG (2 g kg -1 ), which may be the reason for the poor outcomes. In addition, the patients who received IVIG after mechanical circulatory support were included, but those who did not need mechanical circulatory support were excluded. The need for mechanical circulatory support would indicate that the patients were in a critical condition. Thus, administration of IVIG at this time may be too late and incapable of producing positive results.

When the balloon is inflated at diastole, it occupies space in the aorta allowing it to increase diastole pressure and increase infusion to the heart, brain, and other tissues. The balloon will deflate just before systole, which lowers the pressure in the aorta, reducing the afterload and work of the heart and increasing stroke volume (SV), forward circulation, and systemic perfusion. The use of IABP in patients with shock can elevate blood pressure, reduce the dose or avoid the use of vasopressor drugs, and help patients survive the acute phase.

Therefore, very critical patients, especially those who suffer from cardiac shock, those whose cardiac index is less than 2 L min -1 m -2 , or those whose blood lactic acid is over 2 mmol L -1 can gain more benefit from ECMO. Our experience also demonstrates that the use of ECMO combined with IABP at an early stage of illness can efficiently save patients' lives (Hu et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2016) . ECMO was first developed in the 1970s. Its mechanism employs a closed system to oxygenate the circulation outside of the body. After dozens of years of improvement, ECMO has evolved into a portable mechanical supportive equipment which is convenient to use, does not need surgery, and can provide long-time life support. The ECMO system mainly consists of three elements: first, a pipe system that draws blood out of circulation and then transfuses it back into circulation; second, a pump (artificial heart) that circulates the blood quickly through the pipe; third, a closed membrane oxygenator that oxygenates the blood (membrane lung). There are several adjunctive pieces of equipment such as thermostatic water tank, the oxygen providing pipe, and several monitoring systems.

CRRT uses a blood pump to drive blood from the vein through a filter and then back into the body.

Its functions usually include (i) eliminating different kinds of small molecule toxins and water-soluble inflammatory mediators through convection, diffusion, and absorption, and thereby attenuating inflammatory reactions and organ injuries; (ii) rectifying water-electrolyte and acid-base disturbance, lowering blood temperature, and maintaining homeostasis; (iii) effectively ameliorating tissue edema and improving oxygen delivery and organ functions; and (iv) providing enough liquid intake to enable treatment with other necessary drugs and parenteral nutrition.

Circulation failure and shock are not contraindications to CRRT; on the contrary, they are signs of critical illness that necessitates CRRTs. A comparative study between CRRT and diuretic drugs in the treatment of acute heart failure carried out in the United States demonstrated that CRRT can significantly decrease body weight, shorten time spent in the CCU, increase CO and SV, reduce pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and lower 30-day mortality rate (Badawy and Fahmy, 2012) . Studies also reveal that compared with diuretic drugs, CRRT does not significantly interfere with hemodynamic indexes such as heart rate, blood pressure, right atrium pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and pulmonary vascular resistance. Immunoadsorption (IA) therapy is a novel hemopurification technique developed over the past 15 years. Its mechanism combines a ligand (a highly-specific antigen, antibody, or materials with a specific physical or chemical affinity) and a carrier (absorption materials) on an adsorbent reagent or adsorption column. These adsorbent reagents can selectively or specifically eliminate circulating to purify the blood and inhibit disease progression. Since cellular and humoral immunity are involved in the pathophysiological progress of fulminant myocarditis, IA is useful since it selectively targets pathogens and cytokines in plasma. Although there is still a lack of large-scale evidence-based clinical trials, results from small sample clinical studies show that IA therapy can improve heart function, clinical state, indexes of hemodynamics such as cardiac output and stroke volume, systemic vascular resistance, exercise tolerance, and can reduce the levels of NT-proBNP, which are used to evaluate the severity of heart failure (Felix et al., 2015; Jensen and Marchant, 2016) .

Drugs can then be administered if electric cardioversion does not work or arrhythmias reappear after cardioversion. Amiodarone can usually be administered IV with careful consideration of blood pressure. If the arrhythmias cannot be terminated, the first objective should be stabilizing hemodynamics and improving the overall condition.

After successfully correcting arrhythmias, prevention of reoccurrence should be the main objective. (iii) Actively improve cardiac function and rectify hypotension. Deal with disturbances of homeostasis such as electrolyte disturbance and acid-base equilibrium disorders. (iv) Fulminant myocarditis is usually complicated with cardiac dysfunction, cardiac shock, and low perfusion of tissues and organs. Therefore, patients with tachyarrhythmia may not tolerate the negative inotropic effect of negative chronotropic drugs such as beta blockers and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Instead, amiodarone should be given through continuous IV pumping, but quick IV injection should be avoided. Patients with atrial fibrillation with a fast ventricular rate can be given digitalis to control the excessively fast ventricular rate. (v) Patients with bradycardia should be implanted with a temporary pacemaker. If temporary pacemakers are not available, drugs such as isoprenaline or atropine can be used to increase the heart rate. Care must be taken when giving isoprenaline because of its arrhythmogenic effects. (vi) Since most patients can recover successfully, permanent pacemaker implantation is not recommended in patients with bradycardia during the acute phase.
