Epidemics of self-limited infections by adenovirus (especially serotype 4) have been reported from time to time in military recruits. Severe adenovirus infections causing significant morbidity and mortality are well described in immunocompromised patients but are extremely rare in healthy immunocompetent adults [1] . Among the known 51 serotypes of human adenoviruses, serotypes 3 and 7 account for most of these severe infections. Such infections first gained attention during the epidemics of the 1960s and early 1970s in military trainees, when no vaccine was available [2, 3] . Occurrence of such infections among the military recruits dropped significantly with the introduction of a vaccine in 1971. However, severe adenovirus infections among immunocompetent adults raised concern when Ryan et al. reported related deaths in two military recruits in 2001 [4] . Sporadic cases of severe infection have been reported from the community as well [5, 6] .",

Adenovirus serology and serotyping were not performed. Droplet precautions were observed to prevent infection of the caring staff. Ophthalmological evaluation revealed hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. The systemic empirical antibiotics were withdrawn and supportive measures for respiratory and renal failure continued with continuous monitoring of vitals and serum biochemical panels. No antiviral therapy was used. Inotropes and vasopressors were gradually withdrawn.

We defined severe adenovirus pneumonia if associated with respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support at any point during the course of illness and immunocompetent adults as individuals with no acquired or congenital immunodeficiency state with or without associated premorbid conditions. We identified 14 cases. Seven of these cases occurred in epidemics among Fig. 1 Photograph of the patient showing bilateral hemorrhagic conjunctivitis military recruits and a mental health care center and the remaining seven were reported from the community. Table 1 summarizes age, sex, presenting complaints, physical findings, radiological findings, and outcome of each patient. Adenovirus serotype (wherever performed), time to ventilation, and time to death from onset of illness are also included when available. The majority of the patients (8/12, 66.66%) were males and the mean age was 32.75 years (range: 19-56 years). Most patients had no premorbid conditions. Respiratory symptoms were present in all patients; three had associated diarrhea. Radiograph of the chest revealed focal or diffuse infiltrate or consolidation. Serotyping was done in six patients: three had serotype 7, three had serotype 3, and one had both serotypes 4 and 7. Mean time from onset of symptoms to admission to ICU for respiratory failure was 7.5 days (range: 2-17 days). Of the 14 patients identified, 8 (57.14%) died due to worsening respiratory failure. Three of the deceased patients had associated renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) and one had meningitis. An antiviral agent (cidofovir) was used in one patient. Most of these patients developed hypotension during the course of their disease and six of these progressed to fluid-resistant shock.",

            "text": "Our review suggests that most patients have upper respiratory symptoms prior to the onset of respiratory distress and progression to respiratory failure is unpredictable, occurring over hours to days. The presence of flu-like symptoms, diarrhea, and conjunctival infection may be a clue to the viral etiology of the illness. Hemorrhagic conjunctivitis was present in only one of the identified patients; when present it is strongly associated with adenovirus infection. However, it may not be apparent early in the course of the disease as is illustrated in our case. The majority of such patients are febrile and tachycardic at presentation. Chest auscultation may be normal or may reveal localized or bilateral rales, rhonchi, or signs of consolidation. Fluid responsive hypotension and a transient drop in leukocyte count (relative leukopenia and lymphopenia) are common during the course of illness. Initial chest X-ray may be normal but reveal focal reticulonodular infiltrate or a lobar consolidation with the progression of the infection. Lobar consolidation is rare in other types of viral pneumonia [5] [6] [7] [8] . The majority of patients with severe adenovirus infection died due to respiratory failure and shock. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, renal failure, and fluid-resistant shock are also common causes of death and should be always looked for in such patients. Meningitis is a rare but fatal complication of severe adenoviral pneumonia. The whole clinical scenario may be mistaken for bacterial sepsis. Whenever considered, the diagnosis of adenovirus infection is established by isolating the virus on cultures or detecting viral particles on fluorescence antibody testing from material obtained from nasopharyngeal and tracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage, or lung biopsy. A fourfold or more rise in adenovirus-specific antibody titers during the course of illness suggest acute infection and alternatively establishes the diagnosis. Treatment of severe adenovirus infection is supportive and no antiviral agent has been shown to alter the unpredictable course of the disease. Cidofovir and intravenous immunoglobulin have been used with some success in patients with liver and bone marrow transplant [10] . In our review, it was used in only one patient who did not survive. It appears that severe adenovirus infections even in immunocompetent patients are associated with high mortality and morbidity. The spectrum of presentation and characteristics of severe adenovirus infections could be affected by publication bias.",

            "text": "Adenovirus produces cytolysis which accounts for tissue damage and subsequent dysfunction of the affected organs. It also induces interleukin 8 (IL-8) production, which causes a severe systemic inflammatory response causing systemic vasodilatation and triggers DIC. Damage to pulmonary capillaries also contributes to respiratory failure. Cellular immunity is important in viral infection in general. Hence, severe adenovirus infections are common in patients with defective or deficient T-cell immunity such as those with allogenic stem cell transplantation, solid organ transplants, and HIV infection. Infants and young children also are at risk of severe adenovirus infections due to immature T-cell function. Why severe adenovirus infection should occur in immunocompetent individuals is not well understood at this point in time. A unique interplay between viral factors (virulence) and host factors (genes) have been well described in adenovirus infections. Virulent strains of adenovirus (serotypes 3 and 7, etc.) in a genetically susceptible host impair cytokine, T-cell function, and expression of major histocompatibility complex expression [11, 12] . However, the relationship between virulence and genotype needs to be explored. To conclude, the clinical scenario of severe adenovirus pneumonia resembles severe bacterial pneumonia and the two may be indistinguishable on clinical and radiological grounds. Diagnosis of adenovirus infection should be always considered in patients with severe pneumonia with negative cultures and failure to respond to antibiotics. Since this can rapidly progress to respiratory failure, the diagnosis should be looked for early in the course to avoid unnecessary drugs and to apply aggressive supportive measures in the ICU setting which might improve outcome in such patients. More work needs to be done to identify viral determinants and genetic factors triggering severe adenovirus infection in immunocompetent individuals and to better understand the pathophysiology and immunology of such infections. We also need to identify subsets of patients with severe adenovirus who could benefit from antiviral drugs.",
