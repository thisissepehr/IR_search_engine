Methods Retrospective review of case sheets was done. One hundred ten patients with invasive meningococcal disease were included for the study. Results Of the total patients, 61.8 % were boys and 38.2 % were girls (boy to girl ratio01.62:1). The average age of presentation was 8.48 \u00b1 5.09 y. Meningococcal meningitis was seen in 61.8 % of cases, meningococcemia in 20 % and 18.2 % had both. Fever was the most common manifestation (100 %) followed by meningeal signs (78.2 %), headache (56.4 %), vomiting (53.6 %), shock (38.2 %), low Glasgow coma scale (GCS) (25.5 %), purpura and rashes (23.6 %), seizures (9.1 %), abdominal symptoms (4.5 %), irritability and excessive crying (4.5 %) and bulging anterior fontanalle (23 %) in those below 18 mo of age.

Shock is endotoxin mediated and due to factors such as widespread capillary leak, loss of vasomotor tone and maldistribution of intravascular volume, impaired myocardial function and impaired cellular function. Early recognition of shock is crucial for early intervention and improved outcome [13] . Tachycardia may be the only sign present in the early phase of the disease and is enough to mandate fluid resuscitation. Circulatory management aims to maintain tissue perfusion and oxygenation. Repeated fluid boluses with 20 ml/kg of isotonic saline are to be given initially till shock resolves. In case shock persists after 60 ml/kg of fluid, central venous pressure (CVP) line is inserted and fluid resuscitation continued with addition of dopamine and/or dobutamine. Some children require as high as 100-200 ml/kg of fluid resuscitation but such patients also require mechanical ventilation. About 13.6 % of the index cases required inotropic support either alone or in combination for an average duration of 24-72 h. Some studies have shown that 4.5 % albumin is more useful as a resuscitating fluid [14] . Albumin is routinely used in the UK with significant reduction in mortality in the last 20 y (decrease up to 2 %) in patients with meningococcal disease and albumin use may play a role along with other factors [15] .
