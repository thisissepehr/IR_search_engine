The model we use is a data driven [1, 2, 3] global stochastic epidemic model, based on a metapopulation approach. Based on real demographic and mobility data, it considers the world population subdivided into geographic census areas defined around transportation hubs and connected by mobility fluxes, thus defining a subpopulation network. Within each subpopulation, a compartmental structure models the disease spread among individuals. Individuals can move from one subpopulation to another, along the mobility network: in this way, an outbreak originated in a seed subpopulation can lead to a global scale epidemic. This global epidemic and mobility (GLEaM) model can simulate human transmissible disease, and also allows the implementation of a wide range of intervention strategies -including vaccinations, antiviral treatment and travel restrictions -that can be temporally and geographically dependent, to model the different measures adopted by countries in response to an ongoing pandemic. The GLEaM model architecture integrates three different data layers: (i) the population layer, (ii) the transportation mobility layer and (iii) the epidemic layer. In the following we provide a description of the main materials and methods used in each layer.",

Since the coordinates of each cell and those of the airports in the World Airport Network are known, the distance between the cells and the airports can be calculated. We have performed a Voronoi-like tessellation of from country to country. For example, most European countries adhere to a practice that ranks administrative divisions in terms of geocoding for statistical purposes, the so called Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) . Most countries in the European Union are partitioned into three NUTS levels which usually range from states to provinces. The commuting data at this level of resolution is therefore strongly coarse-grained. In order to have a higher geographical resolution of the commuting datasets that could match the resolution scale of our geographical census areas, we looked for smaller local administrative units (LAU) in Europe. The US or Canada report commuting at the level of counties. However, even within a single country the actual extension, shape, and population of the administrative divisions are usually a consequence of historical reasons and can be strongly heterogeneous.",

            "text": "The epidemic model within each subpopulation considers a compartmental approach specific for the disease under study [10] . Each individual is assigned to a given disease state at each moment in time. Individuals transition from compartment to compartment by acquiring the infection or progressing along its multiple states. The number of individuals that transition between any two compartments is calculated using a chain binomial distribution whose rates are informed by the epidemic parameters. All the stochastic processes modeling the transitions of individuals in the different compartments and their mobility are mathematically defined through individual based stochastic chain binomial and multinomial processes [11, 12] to preserve the discrete and stochastic nature of the processes. Individuals are discrete but indistinguishable as no additional structure of the population (like e.g. households, workplaces) is considered. The GLEaM can include age structure and has been used for a side-by-side comparison with a stochastic agentbased model [13] . The specific compartmental structure of the disease is reported in the main text. Smallpox natural history is subdivided into three different stages, Latent, Prodromal and Rash. Upon infection, individuals spend an extended period of at least L d days incubating the infection in the Latent compartment, after which they progress with rate into the prodromal state. The Prodromal period, with an average duration of \u03b3 \u22121 days is characterized by fever and flu-like symptoms before finally displaying the typical liquid filled blisters that characterize smallpox rash. Rash, typically lasts I d days and is eventually followed by a late rash period after which recovery/death at a rate \u00b5 occurs. The relative infectiousness associated to the prodromal period and the different rash stages changes considerably in the literature [14, 15, 16] . The basic reproductive number R 0 gauging the transmissibility of the virus is a parameter of the model by acting on the transmissibility of the various stages of the disease. We have considered according to recent work [17, 18, 19, 20] that the prodromal period contributes 10%of the disease transmissibility and that during the late rash period the infectiousness of individuals is reduced by 90% because of the severity of the disease that leads to isolation and identification of the cases. The spreading rate of the disease is governed by the basic reproduction number R 0 tha is a function of the parameters defining the natural history of the disease [10] . In our case the basic reproduction number reads as:",

Although transitions are assumed to be stochastic, by setting a rate of 1 we are in effect forcing every individual in compartment L 1 to transition to compartment L 2 at the end of the 1 day, thus moving them along the chain for a fixed amount of time. Individuals enter the chain at L 1 by transitioning from the Susceptible compartment upon coming in contact with an infectious person and transition out of L d at a rate \u03b5 on to the next stage of the disease. This formulation is not only conceptually simple, but it also allows for the tracking of individuals along the multiple compartments and the easy determination of how many people were exposed 1, 2, etc... days before. Another key feature of our model is the mobility of individuals. It is therefore extremely important to associate the different stages of the disease with different mobility and travel capabilities. In particular, only a fraction pt of individuals in the prodromal period are allowed to travel. Prodromal individuals capable of traveling are still allowed to travel with probability pr for Id days upon their progression to the rash stage [20] .",

Briefly, GLEaM is implemented in a modular way, where each module performs a specific function and can be added or removed according to the user\u00d5s needs. The compartmental model and the epidemic parameters are defined in a configuration text file that is loaded at the program start. Subsequently, the program loads three data input files: the population database, the short-range mobility network and the long-range mobility network. During each time step, that represents a full day, the following modules are called in sequence: the air travel, the compartment transitions where the force of infection takes into account both the infection dynamics and the short-range movement of individuals, and the partial aggregation of the results at the desired level of geographic resolution. After the last time step, the program generates the final output, which can be further processed for analysis (see Fig.2 ). Custom scripts are then employed to generate the statistics and visualizations required for our analysis. A detailed explanation of the simulation framework can be seen in [3, 21] .
