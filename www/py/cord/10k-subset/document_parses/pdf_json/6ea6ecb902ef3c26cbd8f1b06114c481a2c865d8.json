The latter were similar to those of control muscles with respect to receptor diamter, capsule thickness, and axial tissue content (Figure 1 ). The usual mean population of 4 intrafusal fibres per receptor was observed in spindles of 3 of the 5 dystrophic gastrocnemins and 4 of the 5 dystrophic soleus muscles. In those instances in which there were fewer intrafusal fibres per spindle (mean 3.5 to 3.8), the deficit was most evident in the subaponeurotic receptors. The latter normally exhibit greater variability in appearance and have a greater susceptibility to distortion by the histological procedure, particularly in the fibrotic dystrophic muscles. Although the mean diameters of nuclear-bag (10 ~m) and nuclear-chain fibres (6.5 ~zm) of control and dystrophic muscles were similar, the range of the latter was slightly narrower",

Moreover, since ~-MPT and p-CPA have been reported to have somewhat specific synthesis blocking properties for catecholamines ~3 and 5-hydroxytryptamine ~4, :5 respectively, we can conclude that the endogenous monoamine localized is most probably 5-HT. These results therefore confirm and extend our fluorescence histochemical findings 8,, which revealed the presence, above the ependymal cells, of a yellow fluorescence which took the form of small spots or a thin spotted layer. Although from the present electron microscopic examination of the brain regions investigated it cannot be excluded that in addition some nerve terminals other those storing 5-HT exist, it seems very probable that the majority of the supraepeudymal nerves in these regions are indoleaminergic.",
