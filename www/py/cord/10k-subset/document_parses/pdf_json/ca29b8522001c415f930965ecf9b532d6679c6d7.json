The two regions of the world with highest mortality rate for gastric cancer are Asia and Latin America accounting for almost two thirds of all gastric cancer deaths 2 . Within the US, ethnic minorities, e.g., Asians, Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans, experience an incidence almost twice as high as non-Hispanic Whites 3 . Some Asian countries, such as Japan, have nation-wide screening programs for early detection of gastric cancer, whereas most other high-risk countries, such as Latin American countries, do not have such programs, nor does the US for ethnic minorities 4-6 . Although Helicobacter pylori (HP) is an established cause of gastric cancer 7 , eradication of HP in general asymptomatic populations has not been advised, because of the large number of persons already infected in high risk populations (>90%), high reinfection rates in endemic areas 8 , antibiotic resistance, high cost of the treatment 9 and the increased risk of esophageal cancer associated with HP-negative/eradicated individuals 10-12 . Thus, new strategies for gastric cancer prevention are warranted and may help reduce health disparities, mainly in the most affected and underdeveloped regions of the world 13 . All considered identification of new HP variants potentially useful to predict gastric cancer risk will be invaluable not only for vaccine development, but also to target antibiotic treatment to high-risk individuals. HP has a remarkably high level of genetic diversity due to recombination rates higher than in any other known bacterial species 7,14,15 . A number of HP virulence factors have been identified, but it is now clearly established that cagA and the cytotoxin-associated gene pathogenicity island (cagPAI) play a central role in the pathogenesis of HP-associated diseases 16, 17 . The cagPAI consists of a 40 kb chromosomal DNA and is present in approximately 95% of East Asian isolates, compared to 60% of low-risk Western isolates 18-21 . These genes encode cytotoxins and components of the type IV secretion system (T4SS) that acts as a molecular syringe injecting bacterial macromolecules into host cell cytosol 19 . This ultimately leads to sustained IL-8 production, inflammation, proliferation and morphological changes of gastric epithelial cells which underlie HP-induced gastric premalignant and malignant pathologies 19 . However, the presence of cagA (a marker of cagPAI) does not predict clinical outcomes in high-risk populations since the majority of HP are cagA positive strains, and among the infected subject less than 3% develop gastric cancer.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1891, "end": 1894, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1895, "end": 1897, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "CagPAI contains 31 open reading frames, named cag1 to cag26 or cagA to cagZ and cag\u03b1 to cag\u03b6, or by locus name of the HP 26695 or HP J99 strains genomes 22 .

We isolated HP in 92 of these patients and sequenced them, however 18 were dropped due to poor quality or because they did not carry the cagPAI. Samples included in the following analysis were therefore 74 HP clinical isolates from 74 individuals recruited in Colombia (N = 37) and Mexico (N = 37, nine of which have been already sequenced with the 454 technology for 5 genes 28 ). Thirty-seven of these subjects had non-atrophic or atrophic gastritis, 21 intestinal metaplasia (IM) and 16 distal gastric cancer (GC). Table 4 shows pertinent characteristics of the population. For Mexican samples, all the patients signed an informed consent and the study was approved by ethical committees of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) and General Hospital of the Secretaria de Salud (SS), Mexico City, Mexico 28 . For Colombia, the clinical studies where patients were originally recruited were approved by the Ethical and Research Committee of the Instituto Nacional de Cancerolog\u00eda, and all the patients signed an informed consent.

Raw sequences with Phred score >30 were analyzed with FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) to further assess quality.

A consensus sequence was determined for cagA (HP0547), cagC (HP0546), cagE (HP0544), cagF (HP0543), cagI (HP0540), cagL (HP0539), c-terminal sequence of cagY (HP0527) (339 nucleotides at the 3' end of the genes encoding for the last carboxyl terminal 113 amino acids of CagY, cagYc) 28 , cagX (HP0528), cag\u03b3 (HP0523), and single nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertions and deletions were identified for each gene. For the analysis of cagA gene an additional strategy was used to better analyze the EPIYA and CM motifs (C-MET motif mediate CagA multimerization and membrane targeting) 30, 31 . Illumina reads of the cagA gene were extracted and realigned by the \"de novo assemble\" option of the same software. To exclude potential artifacts in sequencing and to enrich variants with clinical relevance, we selected a total of 520 non-synonymous variants with at least 7.5% frequency in the HP isolates we included in the analysis or with a minimum of 5 isolates with the variant allele. A Bonferroni-corrected threshold (P = 0.05/520 = 9.6\u00d710 \u22125 ) was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. The variant alleles were determined using strain 26695 as reference. When more than one variant resulted in substitution of the same amino acid, we also analyzed the frequencies of the combined amino acid variant. We used non-atrophic gastritis as the control group to compare frequencies of variants in IM and GC groups or a combined group with the two pathologies, and genotypes at a given locus were dichotomized, a selected variant vs. all other genotypes. P-values for differences in allelic frequencies between the control and IM/GC combined or separately were determined by the Fisher's exact test (2-sided) . We also computed odds ratios (OR) 95% confidence interval (CI) for these gastric pathologies using logit estimators to obtain the CI even for the variants with zero frequencies in any category. For the variants that showed an unadjusted Fisher P-value of <0.05, we further tested linear trends of their frequencies across the three histological groups, control, IM and GC, using Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test.
