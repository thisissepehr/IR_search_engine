In this analysis, blame is construed as a vehicle of meaning through which the lay public makes sense of an epidemic, and through which certain classes of people become ''figures of blame''. Data was collected from Twitter and Facebook using key word extraction, then categorized thematically. Our findings indicate an overall proximate blame tendency: blame was typically cast on ''near-by'' figures, namely national governments, and less so on ''distant'' figures, such as generalized figures of otherness (''Africans'', global health authorities, global elites). Our results also suggest an evolution of online blame. In the early stage of the epidemic, blame directed at the affected populations was more prominent. However, during the peak of the outbreak, the increasingly perceived threat of inter-continental spread was accompanied by a progressively proximal blame tendency, directed at figures with whom the social media users had pre-existing biopolitical frustrations.

Secondly, social media has been analyzed to explore the online content visualized by users in order to better understand the information that they consume, but usually without consideration for the manner in which this is received and appreciated (Basch et al. 2015; Bragazzi et al. 2017) . Thirdly, some researchers have explored rumors and misinformation circulating on social media, and highlighted the importance for public health authorities to analyze such conversations and counteract the spread of false information by acting as moderators (Yang, Horneffer, and DiLisio 2013; Nagpal et al. 2015; Sharma et al. 2017) . The fourth category of research, in which this study is situated, considers social media analyses to be useful tools to assess perceptions about public health issues and explores the users' understanding of epidemics, in order to better grasp their concerns, preoccupations and sentiments (Miller et al. 2017; Nielsen et al. 2017 ) and adjust the online communication strategies targeting this public.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 281, "end": 299, "text": "(Chou et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 300, "end": 329, "text": "Elkin, Topal and Gurkan 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 330, "end": 352, "text": "Schomberg et al. 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 353, "end": 376, "text": "Sinnenberg et al. 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 377, "end": 393, "text": "Woo et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 643, "end": 662, "text": "(Basch et al. 2015;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 663, "end": 684, "text": "Bragazzi et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 944, "end": 979, "text": "(Yang, Horneffer, and DiLisio 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 980, "end": 999, "text": "Nagpal et al. 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1000, "end": 1019, "text": "Sharma et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1311, "end": 1331, "text": "(Miller et al. 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1332, "end": 1351, "text": "Nielsen et al. 2017", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In the context of the recent Ebola epidemic, most studies were located in the first and third categories.

Secondly, some studies also analyzed social media to better understand reasons for misinterpretation of the Ebola disease, with a focus on misconceptions and false information circulating during the Ebola epidemic (Alnemer et al. 2015; Jin et al. 2014; Oyeyemi, Gabarron, and Wynn 2014) . As such, to the best of our knowledge, previous studies have not analyzed social media users' general understanding of the recent Ebola epidemic. While important, current studies forgo the qualitative meaning invested in the outbreak by the users. We argue that public health authorities should carry out research on social media users' understanding of epidemics, in order to improve the design and calibration of communication strategies to their targeted audiences (Sastry and Dutta 2017) . Thus, in this paper, we aim to contribute to current literature on Ebola and social media by analyzing the attribution and evolving dynamics of online blame, which we conceptualize as a specific part in the process of sense-making of the outbreak. As we will show, externalized figures were more prominent in social media conversations at the beginning of the epidemic. However, as the epidemic progressed and the perceived risk of international propagation increased, blame progressively shifted towards increasingly localized figures. Ultimately, the results of this study highlight a localized dynamic of blame: national governments and neighbouring immigrants are the ones mostly held responsible for the propagation of the Ebola epidemic, which, as we will show, can provide a heightened sense of power, but also feelings of bitterness.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 251, "end": 289, "text": "Cult Med Psychiatry (2020) 44:56-79 57", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 317, "end": 338, "text": "(Liaquat et al. 2016;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 339, "end": 396, "text": "Rodriguez-Morales, Casta\u00f1eda-Hern\u00e1ndez and Mcgregor 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 613, "end": 634, "text": "(Alnemer et al. 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 635, "end": 651, "text": "Jin et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 652, "end": 685, "text": "Oyeyemi, Gabarron, and Wynn 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1156, "end": 1179, "text": "(Sastry and Dutta 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Dynamics of blame are often present during epidemics, as the public attempts to make sense of the event by scrutinizing human actions that could have led to the propagation of the disease (Farmer 2006) .

However, public health authorities are not sufficiently informed about the conversations circulating on social media, primarily utilizing social media as one-way channels to distribute information (Fung et al. 2016; Thackeray et al. 2012) . Our research confirms the pertinence to public health authorities of monitoring and analyzing social media conversations, especially those articulated around blame, because they can inform us about the meaning invested in an epidemic event by the users.

Previous research (Chandler et al. 2015; Richards 2016) has shown that the strategy of simply disseminating biomedical knowledge (symptoms, transmission and at-risk practices) on Ebola-and, by extension, on other epidemics of infectious and contagious diseases-is insufficient to lead to behavioural change and heightened community mobilization in public health efforts. Communication strategies in times of epidemics should not be limited to the correction of biomedical misinformation on the disease, but also take into account national and local politics, perceptions and frustrations (notably those regarding borders) at play in the understanding of the epidemic. Moreover, due to the temporal evolution of the figures of blame, as indicated in our study, real-time and on-going analysis of social media conversations are important to tailor online communication efforts to the users' perceptions. On one hand, this can allow for better calibrated communication campaigns that respond to the public's perception of risk (Smith 2006) , and that address fears or distrust (Rousseau et al. 2013; Sharfstein 2015) in ways that promote social cohesion and community mobilization (Laverack and Manoncourt 2016; Omaswa, Okware and Kiguli-Malwadde 2015; Pronyk et al. 2016) . On the other hand, it may also reassure community stakeholders who question official responses, by showing that their concerns are shared by the population. In this sense, beyond direct usefulness, by giving a voice to unheard voices, it may help to support a much-needed societal dialogue in adverse times.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 197, "end": 219, "text": "(Chandler et al. 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 220, "end": 234, "text": "Richards 2016)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1203, "end": 1215, "text": "(Smith 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1253, "end": 1275, "text": "(Rousseau et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1276, "end": 1292, "text": "Sharfstein 2015)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1357, "end": 1387, "text": "(Laverack and Manoncourt 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1388, "end": 1428, "text": "Omaswa, Okware and Kiguli-Malwadde 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1429, "end": 1448, "text": "Pronyk et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Ebola at the Borders: Newspaper Representations and the Politics of Border Control", "authors": [{"first": "Sudeepa", "middle": [], "last": "Abeysinghe", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2016, "venue": "Third World Quarterly", "volume": "37", "issn": "3", "pages": "452--467", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Are Health-Related Tweets Evidence Based?
