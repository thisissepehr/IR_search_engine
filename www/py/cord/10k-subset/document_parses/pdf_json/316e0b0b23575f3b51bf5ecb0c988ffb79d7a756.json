Concentrated umbilical cord blood cells were administered in a dose of 250 millions cells (4 injections at 1-week intervals). The control group received placebo. In both groups, reduction of depressive disorders and the decrease in hypothymia severity were observed. Infusions of cell concentrate contributed to delayed correction of treatment resistance and reduced the severity of depression to moderate. In the main group, signifi cant, persistent, and long-term positive dynamics was observed in the cognitive sphere. The therapeutic potential of umbilical cord blood cell concentrate can be used to overcome treatment resistance formed in depressive patients.",

The patients are preoccupied with negative (\"heavy\", \"sluggish\" in their self-description) perceptions of worthlessness, their hopelessness situation, and circumstances that led to the current thorns. According S. Nolen-Hoeksema [20] , \"tautological fi xation on the fact of depression\" reduces cognitive potential and contributes to its chronization. This point is related to the cognitive paradigm of depression [14] , according to which the affective disorder involves attention, cognitive regulation, realization of own coping strategies, and interaction between different levels of cognitive processes. Similar integrative model of depression in the context of the cognitive-emotional interactions is shared by authors of more recent studies [21] .",

Cortisol concentrations in patients of the control group fl uctuated during the study, which can be associated with changes in clinical symptoms (e.g. SARS experienced during this period). Due to this and because of small number of patients in the control group, no statistical relationships were revealed; however, it should be noted that blood cortisol concentrations at the start and end of the study approached the upper limit of normal. The initial levels of TNF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, and IL-6 in the main and control groups were also within the normal limits and did not differ signifi cantly. During the study, the levels of cytokines in the main group increased (except IL-1\u03b2, reference value <5 pg/liter) and in case of TNF, this increase reached statistical signifi cance in 1.5 and 3 months after start of treatment (Fig. 4) , which can be explained by the release of these substances from UCBC into circulation.",

The latter is realized through paracrine effects of neurotrophic factors released by cells and manifests at the clinical level by metabolic (nootropic) and psychostimulating effect increasing the possibility of positive response to basic psychopharmacotherapy.
