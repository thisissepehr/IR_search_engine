The insertion is all or none: in one study the (I)/(D) frequency ratio was 44:56. The deletion (D) allele of the ACE gene lacks the sequence that is present in the insertion (I) allele. The D allele is associated with a higher plasma and tissue ACE activity. The DD genotype is positively correlated with plasma ACE activity and numerous attempts have been made to search for associations between the DD genotype and specific cardiovascular diseases, but the conclusions remain controversial 29 . The association of allele I with athletic performance is equally controversial. Some studies have shown that this polymorphism is associated with endurance performance, whereas others have shown the D allele to be associated with that of elite shortdistance athletes 30,31 . notable differences in hydrophobicity and charge are observed in the lid-like structure comprising helices \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b13 (using tACE nomenclature; FIG. 2 ). This part of the structure seems to affect the substrate specificity of the N-or C-domain, as tACE mutants which had this region replaced by the corresponding N-domain sequence showed a preference for N-domain substrates 43 (Z. L. Woodman et al., unpublished data). Second, the Zn 2+ -binding site with the canonical HEXXH motif is conserved. Third, it has been shown that the C-domain has greater chloride dependence than the N-domain, both in terms of substrate hydrolysis and inhibitor binding 19, 24 . From the model we can predict that Arg186 (a key residue for binding one of the two chloride ions in tACE) is replaced by His164 in the N-domain. So, in the N-domain only one chloride-ion-binding pocket is plausible, involving Arg500 and Tyr202. Fourth, positioning of the lisinopril molecule in the active site of the N-domain model revealed that the full complement of structurally conserved residues was found as observed in the tACE structure, confirming that the N-domain of somatic ACE could also bind lisinopril with similar affinity, as previously reported 24, 44 . Fifth, the S 2 sub-site is formed by Asn494 and Thr496, which replace a serine and a valine, respectively, in the C-domain. Furthermore, the asparagine occurs in an N-GLYCOSYLATION SEQUON (NVT) that is unique to the N-domain; the attachment of any glycan to this residue would occlude the S 2 pocket. This, in part, might explain how the bulky aromatic ring of the benzamido group in keto-ACE (an ACE inhibitor; see FIG. 5a) is accommodated by the S 2 site in the C-domain (tACE), making keto-ACE more C-domain selective. Sixth, the ACE inhibitor RXP407 has an N-acetyl group that confers a certain degree of N-domain specificity 22 . The model of RXP407 and the N-domain reveals two residues, Arg381 and Tyr369, that form van der Waals interactions with the N-acetyl carbonyl/methyl groups (FIG. 5d) . However, a glutamate and phenylalanine are substituted for these two residues in the C-domain and might exert repulsive forces in the binding of the inhibitor to the C-domain active site.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 145, "end": 147, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 642, "end": 644, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1300, "end": 1302, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1576, "end": 1579, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1580, "end": 1582, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2150, "end": 2153, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2154, "end": 2156, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2789, "end": 2791, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1069, "end": 1075, "text": "FIG. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2950, "end": 2959, "text": "(FIG. 5d)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Crystal structure of tACE"}, {"text": "Homology modelling of ACE2 using the atomic coordinates of the tACE structure revealed differences in the ligand-binding pockets of the two homologues that account for their substrate and inhibitor selectivity 105 .

This represents an elongation of the side chain of residue 281, which causes steric conflict with the P 2 \u2032 residue of lisinopril when it is docked in the active site of the ACE2 model.

In fact, the aperture of the channel opening is approximately 3 \u00c5 in diameter, which is too small for most peptide substrates, indicating that tACE must undergo some conformational change, possibly associated with its unique chloride ion activation, for the substrate to enter the channel. From the structure of the lisinopril-tACE complex (FIG. 4) it is evident that the phenyl ring of the inhibitor interacts with the S 1 sub-site in the active site, the lysine with the S 1 \u2032 sub-site, and the proline occupies the S 2 \u2032 sub-site. The carboxyl group, located between the phenylpropyl group and the lysine, binds to the Zn 2+ in the active site and also forms a hydrogen bond with the side-chain carboxylate of Glu384.

For instance, it is unknown whether chloride binding and dissociation result in significant movement of the N-terminal 'lid' formed by helices \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b13, and thereby restrict substrate access 5 . Even more importantly, the physical orientation of the N-and C-domains in somatic ACE is unknown, as is whether there is any significant degree of domain interaction or cooperativity.

These are important tools in structural proteomics and to some extent have eliminated the scepticism about the feasibility and value of the structure-based approach. In particular, high-throughput structure-based drug design using protein crystallography has become a very attractive proposition for the pharmaceutical industry. Many examples exist today in which a combination of the three-dimensional structure of the target protein, computer-aided drug design (in silico or virtual screening), and a rational approach using highthroughput screening have produced important lead compounds that are now being evaluated in clinical trials (for recent reviews see REFS 1, 2, 103, 104) .

Trandolaprilat contains a C-terminal hexahydroindoline group, which also indicates that a bulky P 2 \u2032 group confers C-selectivity. This is confirmed by results from radioligand-binding studies, which indicated that both perindoprilat and quinaprilat, which contain hexahydroindoline and tetrahydroisoquinoline groups, respectively, in the P 2 \u2032 position, were 45-180-fold more C-selective 102 . Similarly, the highly C-selective tetrapeptide RXPA380 also contains a bulky methylindole group in the P 2 \u2032 position.

The bradykinin potentiating peptides (BPPs) confirm the conclusion regarding the P 2 group: BPPa, BPPb, BPPc and BPP2 all end with the sequence Ile-Pro-Pro, yet only BPPc is unselective.
