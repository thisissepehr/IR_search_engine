Results: In 15 out of 18 patients IFN\u03b3 treatment was associated with an increase of median HLA-DR expression from 2666 [IQ 1547; 4991] to 12,451 [IQ 4166; 19,707], while the absolute number of lymphocyte subpopulations were not affected, except for the decrease number of NK cells 94.5 [23; 136] to 32.5 [13; 90.8] (0.0625)].

The clear trend of NK cell decrease in our case series may result from a migration into infected tissue or from a reduction in NK cell generation. Being poorly reported, this observation made in a small size cohort should be cautiously interpreted.

All cohort except 1 patient improved enough to be discharged from ICU. This observation suggests that IFN\u03b3 is most clinically effective if the suppressed immune response is present for a longer period and is associated with new infections. We hypothesized that the duration more than the depth of mHLA-DR downregulation is relevant for the clinician to detect the risk of new infections. This aspect should be verified in a larger population. As reported previously, the IFN\u03b3 treatment was well tolerated in our 20 patients with no clearly attributable severe side effects. The monitoring of HLA-DR expression on circulating monocytes appears adequate to follow the immunological efficacy of the compound, a relatively cheap immune monitoring exam to facilitate the clinical decision making.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This case series has important limitations, mostly related to its observational nature and the compassionate use of the drug. First, the 20 collected cases are too limited to draw definitive conclusions about the clinical Fig. 5 schematic representation of the targeted population potentially selected to perform randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The baseline mHLA-DR expression has to be measured during the first 4-5 days post-admission. Patients remaining in intensive care (ICU) after 5 days have sequential mHLA-DR measurements to evaluate the trend of evolution. Both a low mHLA-DR level or a flat/negative trend associated with symptoms of infection despite adequate treatment, leads to consider the use of IFN\u03b3 and could be randomized benefit of this treatment. However, grouping together the case reports and the other case series results in at least 50 reported cases treated by IFN\u03b3. Overall, an excellent tolerance was reported using a 100 mcg daily in adult. It is still essential to determine the doseresponse relationship, and the tolerance of potential repetitive treatment to complete the safety profile of the compound. Despite the small number of cases, it is remarkable that mHLA-DR significantly increased following the first injection and went down again rapidly after treatment cessation. Second, macrophage or monocyte polarization (M1 or M2) has not been tested in our cases, which hampered the understanding of reprogramming mechanisms and its impact on monocytemacrophage polarization.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 222, "end": 228, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Sepsis induces suppression of the immune system, associated with susceptibility to secondary infections and impaired clinical outcome.
