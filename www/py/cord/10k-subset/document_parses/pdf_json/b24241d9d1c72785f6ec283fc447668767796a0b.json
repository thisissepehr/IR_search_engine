            "text": "Increasingly in paediatric intensive care, as in the adult sphere, the intensivist's focus is increasingly guided towards not only reducing mortality but also to ensuring that survival is morbidity-free. Baghurst et al. [1] reported on the applicability of sequential control charts for monitoring of the quality of paediatric intensive care using risk-adjusted probabilities of death estimated by the Paediatric Index of Mortality version 2 (PIM2). A total of 10,710 patient records submitted to the Australia and New Zealand Paediatric Intensive Care registry from 8 PICU's were used in the report. During the 2-year monitoring period the investigators demonstrated that their methodology was able to detect one 'alarm' for poor PICU performance and one 'alarm' for better than expected PICU performance. In their paper, the authors present a detailed description of sequential analysis methodologies and describe their potential prospective use as tools for monitoring the performance of intensive care units. They caution that 'alarms' for poor or excessively good performance are arbitrarily set and are not necessarily indicative of 'real' problems. Alarms should, however, act as triggers for investigation to ascertain whether the data is sound and if so whether true clinical over or underperformance exists. Numa et al. [2] undertook a study to determine whether outcomes were influenced by time of admission to an Australian tertiary paediatric intensive care unit without 24 h per day in-house intensivist cover. Evening, night and weekend cover by staff intensivists was provided mainly by telephone with discretionary return to hospital to support resident paediatric staff. The authors found that a lack of in-house intensivist was not associated with any increase in riskadjusted mortality or increased length of stay. They attribute these findings to a combination of relatively experienced junior staff and the effectiveness of telephone backup and discretionary attendance from intensivists after hours. Two studies in 2008 looked at the quality of survival of children after undergoing intensive care. In a case-control study, Elison et al. [3] reported on a detailed neuropsychological follow-up of 16 children, with mean age 9.44 \u00b1 2.85 years, tested a mean of 4.8 \u00b1 1.4 months following hospital discharge. They detected the presence of impaired memory and attention in children following acute illness and links between memory anomalies and emotional/behavioural problems. These findings, if replicated in a larger study, are very important to children and their parents and teachers. Knoester et al. [4] also reported on early neurocognitive sequelae of intensive care but in addition reported information on physical outcomes. They determined that 69% of children had detectable physical sequelae 3 months after PICU discharge. Whilst 30% of sequelae were attributed to previously unknown illness, 39% were acquired of which 8% were related to complications of PICU procedures. Finally, in the area of patient safety and quality, Burmester et al. [5] reported on the apparent benefit of the introduction of a structured prescription education programme and standardised prescription template in a paediatric cardiac ICU. The total number of prescription errors fell from a baseline of 16.8% of prescriptions to 4.8% after the implementation of the measures and this was associated with a small but statistically significant reduction in the incidence of Adverse Drug Events. Weight-based variations in drug dosing are often quoted as a factor in the known high incidence of drug errors in paediatric practice. Disappointingly, tenfold miscalculations which are particularly common and dangerous in children if the decimal point is misplaced during calculations showed no improvement with the studied interventions. This report highlights the need for regular ongoing education in critical care units which typically have high prescription volumes and often see high turnover of staff, particularly 'junior' prescribers such as resident medical staff.",

[6] who reported a prospective observational study across 15 Italian paediatric intensive care units conducted over a period of 1 year. During the study 2,741 children were admitted to the participating PICU's. The incidence of severe sepsis was 1.6% and that of septic shock 2.1%, with associated mortalities of 17.7 and 50.8%, respectively. In March 2008 the Journal published a landmark paper from de Oliveira et al. [7] . They studied children with septic shock who were resuscitated according to ACCM/PALS guidelines [8] with or without ScvO2 goal-directed therapy. In this randomised controlled trial, there was a significant difference in mortality rate with use of ACCM/ PALS haemodynamic support guidelines for septic shock between patients with or without ScvO 2 guided therapy. Patients who received therapies directed to the goal of ScvO 2 [ 70% were given more fluid, red blood cells and inotropic support after the initial resuscitation, with a resulting 3.3-fold reduction in mortality. This study supports the incorporation goal-directed therapy using the endpoint of a ScvO 2 C 70% within ACCM/PALS guidelines the use of which provided a significant beneficial impact on the outcome of children and adolescents with septic shock in this study. Recently the use of vasopressin and vasopressin analogues, potent vasoconstrictors, has been reported in the management of vasodilatory shock in children. Jerath reported a retrospective study of the use of vasopressin in a series of 157 children in a multidisciplinary PICU. Haemodynamics appear to have been favourably influenced, but the authors noted adverse effects on renal function and lower platelet counts associated with vasopressin use. Yildizdas et al. [9] performed a randomised non-blinded comparison of the use of the vasopressin analogue terlipressin in a group of 58 children with refractory septic shock. Although terlipressin had no beneficial effect on mortality rate in this study, its use was associated with increased mean arterial pressure, improved oxygenation, decreased length of stay in the PICU and had a beneficial effect on survival time among nonsurvivors. Despite these interesting early reports, the place of vasopressin and its analogues in the management of shock states in children is not yet established. Until blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled studies are conducted in children with septic shock and in other shock states which compare the use of vasopressin-like drugs to standard treatments such as noradrenaline, their use should be considered only a rescue therapy of last resort.",

Simultaneous recordings were obtained. In children in whom neuromuscular blockade was not being used, correlation between the four methods was moderate or good. However, only BIS and AEP were found to be potentially reliable in those children who were both sedated and subject to neuromuscular blockade. The authors concluded that their results support the finding that the clinical scales do not evaluate the level of sedation accurately in critically ill children with neuromuscular relaxation, leading to a higher risk of over or undersedation. They suggest that in these children, BIS and the AEP index methods may provide a better assessment of the level of sedation. However, they caution that lack of correlation between these two methods in children with neuromuscular relaxation and the absence of a reference method to evaluate sedation in the relaxed patient means that their results must be interpreted carefully.

            "text": "Performing optimal cardiovascular monitoring in critically ill children is a considerable challenge. The Journal published four papers in 2008 which address various aspects of this challenging field. Durand et al. [14] investigated whether the measurement of respiratory variations in aortic blood flow velocity (D V peak Ao), systolic arterial (D SAP) pressure and pulse pressure (D PP) could accurately predict fluid responsiveness in ventilated children. Standardised volume challenges were given to 26 children with preserved ventricular function. Aortic blood flow was analysed by transthoracic pulsed Doppler. Whilst a positive correlation was found between D V peak Ao and volume expansion-induced gain in stroke volume, measurements of D SAP pressure and D PP were of little value in predicting responses to fluid augmentation in ventilated children. In a preliminary study, Knirsch et al. [15] compared the measurement of cardiac output using the Ultrasound Cardiac Output Monitor (USCOM) with pulmonary artery catheterderived thermodilution cardiac output in a group of 24 children undergoing cardiac catheterization. The main finding was that cardiac output measured with USCOM did not reliably represent absolute values measured by pulmonary artery catheter thermodilution, with a mean percentage error higher than 30%. The limitations of transthoracic pulsed Doppler cardiac output measurement in comparison to cardiac output measurement by the thermodilution technique has been recognized [16] . A number of user-dependent technical factors have been shown to influence ultrasound-derived measurements in other studies in a variety of situations. In addition, possible inaccuracy in algorithm-derived aortic valve diameter used in calculation for cardiac output from flow can introduce systematic error. Many of these limitations are negated if serial measurements are used to derive trends in aortic flow rather algorithm-derived 'absolute' cardiac outputs. Frey et al. [17] brought clarity to the interpretation of aspects of the photoplethysmographic wave which is displayed by most pulse oximeters. They demonstrate that it may be used to derive additional haemodynamic information in some selected situations when, for instance, arterial blood pressure monitoring is not available. The advantages of this method are its widespread use, non-invasiveness and continuity. The authors suggest that haemodynamic deterioration, whether suddenly occurring or slowly evolving over time, may be detected by this method. There is only minimal reference to photoplethysmography monitoring in the paediatric literature.",

Their results demonstrated that N-proBNP was superior to troponin I in reflecting clinical and echocardiographic postoperative recovery. Furthermore the authors suggest that preoperative N-proBNP reflected postoperative myocardial functional capacity, thus potentially helping in the early identification of patients who are at risk of chronic cardiac dysfunction. Another biomarker, plasma angiopoetin-2 (Angpt-2), a vascular growth factor, was found by Giuliano et al. [19] to independently predict cardiac ICU length of stay in a series of 48 children palliative or corrective cardiac surgery. The angiopoietins are a family of vascular growth factors that are necessary for both developmental and pathological angiogenesis. ANGPT-2 promotes increased vascular permeability and inflammation and has been shown to be increased in adults with congestive heart failure and the acute coronary syndrome. The authors conclude that ANGPT-2 appears to be an important biomarker of adverse outcome following CPB. Further studies pertaining to the role of angpt-2 in the pathophysiology of capillary leak syndrome following CPB are warranted. At a more practical level, the study reported by Ross-Russell et al.",

[21] addressed the question of whether the D allele of the I/D polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene is associated with increased susceptibility to acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF) in critically ill children. Previous reports have linked the D allele of the ACE gene to susceptibity for ARDS in critically ill adults and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in pre-term infants. In a single centre prospective study, AHRF developed in 13.9% of 216 critically ill children. There was no significant difference in the frequency of the D allele between patient groups with and without AHRF. The authors suggest that this may suggest differences in the pathogenesis of paediatric AHRF and adult ARDS. Phospholipases A2 is an enzyme widely distributed in the body and was the focus of a report from De Luca et al. [22] . The enzyme is primarily involved in the turnover of membrane phospholipids and lipid digestion. In addition phospholipase A2 is involved in inflammation pathways through the formation of eicosanoids and other inflammatory mediators. In the lungs the secretory form of the enzyme (sPLA2) is produced mainly by alveolar macrophages and secreted into the alveoli. sPLA2 has been shown to be involved in lung inflammation and surfactant degradation and it may play a role for sPLA2 in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). De Luca et al. provide evidence that sPLA2 is present in high concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from neonates with pneumonia and hyaline membrane disease. In this study, sPLA2 levels correlated negatively with dynamic compliance and positively with indices of poorer oxygenation. It appears therefore that the enzyme plays a role in the pathogenesis of respiratory failure in neonates.",

Berner and colleagues [25] adopted a different strategy, successfully using high frequency oscillatory ventilation whilst allowing spontaneous breathing in a group of 9 infants with RSV. These two strategies are essentially delivering physiologically similar therapy, maintaining spontaneous ventilation and relying on CPAP to maintain lung volume and reduce the work of breathing. The suggestion that CPAP is clinically effective in RSV bronchiolitis possibly through reduced work of breathing in babies with RSV bronchiolitis was first made by Beasley addressed similar issues in two related papers investigating the mechanics of breathing in children with severe croup and the effect of nebulization of epinephrine on measures of airway obstruction [30] . Respiratory mechanics were studies in 20 infants with severe croup. Patients were found to maintain minute ventilation by means of large increases in mean intrathoracic pressure required to overcome inspiratory flow limitation. Nebulised epinephrine was found to result in short-lived improvement in some but not all patients with croup. Both inspiratory and expiratory airway resistance fell in patients responding to nebulised epinephrine.

[31] reported a series of 124 children categorised as receiving 'paediatric extra-corporeal life support' in a single institution from the inception of their ECLS programme in July 1992 until December 2005. Clinical selection criteria operated during the study were those of severe respiratory failure failing to respond to conventional management and in whom recovery was believed to be reasonably possible. Survival to hospital discharge was 62 with 59% surviving to 1 year. Severity of pulmonary dysfunction pre-ECMO and the presence of shock predicted higher risk of mortality. Kneyber et al. [32] raise the important question of whether we know the true incidence of the acute respiratory distress syndrome in children, or whether it is under-recognised. They retrospectively reviewed 533 mechanically ventilated children admitted to two regional Dutch paediatric ICU's. Chest radiographs were screened for the presence of bilateral infiltrates, PaO2/FiO2 ratios calculated and left ventricular dysfunction ruled out by echocardiography. Forty-one (7.7%) of children met criteria for ARDS giving a population-based incidence of ARDS of 2.2 per 100,000 per year. The incidence of paediatric ARDS is low compared to adults, but the authors suggest that many cases of ARDS are categorised by their underlying diseases such as viral infections, leading to significant underreporting of ARDS. This may be particularly important when planning randomised -controlled trials, as significant underestimation of the effected population could lead to erroneous trial designs or abandonment of trials at the planning stage due to perceived difficulty in recruiting subjects in a timely and cost-effective manner. Bachmann et al. [33] investigated the level of adoption of paediatric ventilation technologies from the participants at two international conferences. The authors used the approach of Rogers' which addresses both differences among individuals and characteristics of the innovation [34] . The authors concluded that whilst evidence of outcomes is the most relevant factor for assessment of potentially beneficial technologies, other factors that encourage adoption of mediocre technologies, or that retard adoption of potentially beneficial technologies, must be understood and acknowledged.",

Universal requirements for ethical research are on one hand the respect of subject's autonomy and on the other the protection against harm (the risk-benefit ratio). Respect of autonomy for a child under 18 implies that investigators, whenever possible, seek his-her assent, besides the parental authorization. Protection is achieved via a drastic limitation of the risks children can be exposed during a trial: in the US, the threshold is a ''minimal risk'' for healthy children and a ''minor increase over minimal risk'' for diseased ones. Then, Dr Truog proposes a threestep approach of evaluation of paediatric research protocols. The basic concept here is the so-called ''component analysis'': the research protocol has to be broken in several components, those part of standard care and those which are necessary for research, in addition to care. Each of these components are separately analysed in terms of risk/benefit balance. However, appreciation of ''minimal risk'' is always debatable, and it is the essential role of the Research Ethics Committee (RECs, or IRBs in the US) to define it on a case to case basis.",

[36] review a few recent randomized clinical trials performed on severely ill patients (the ARMA trial comparing a low and a lage Vt in ARDS, the trial assessing the effect of growth hormone in ICU patients and the TRICC trial, on the level of blood transfusion, also in ICU patients) and emphasise the crucial importance of the control group. They convincingly show that most of the controversies which followed the publication of some of them stemmed from the inappropriate design of control groups. A well designed control group has two main functions: the first one is to protect the patients enrolled in the trial, and the second is to guarantee the external validity of the conclusions of the research. If the new therapy is to replace the existing standard, it has to have been tested against this standard. Authors' recommendations are that a control group should not be historical, needs to represent current care and should be enrolled along with the new treatment group. Of course, in all large trials involving severely ill patients, a DSMB will monitor safety by comparing the intervention group to this control group. Special difficulties are commonplace in critical care research: patients populations are frequently heterogeneous, syndromes are dealt with, instead of diseases (septic shock, ARDS.), many treatments are delivered with titration: Vt, PEEP, catecholamines, blood transfusion, making the design of a control group extraordinary arduous (one size does no fit all.).",

This study has demonstrated a large gradient from Northern to Southern regions in Europe as to the end of life decisions in ICUs. It was certainly tempting to see whether physician's values could explain these discrepancies. Clearly, the lesser degree of end of life decisions in the South corresponds to more paternalistic views, as expressed by a more frequently cited ''unresponsiveness to therapy'', a lesser degree of documentation of their decisions and also a lesser consideration for patients' ''best interest''. However, all investigators, irrespectively of their location, gave a low priority to patient or family request. The authors conclude that ''.there is room (in Europe) for greater engagement with patients and their families to promote patient autonomy in the end of life decision-making process''! End of life decisions are influenced by the religious affiliation of physicians, despite the delimitation of religion from ''acculturation'' is not always clear-cut. This was another important demonstration by the Ethicus study [40] . Bul\u00f6w et al. [41] review the world's major religions' points of view on end of life decisions in the ICU. The Jewish perspective gives a fascinating insight into a new Israeli law which deals with the prohibition by Halacha of withdrawing mechanical ventilation. Surprisingly enough, the Islamic perspective is not far from the catholic tradition (the moral of intention, for instance), but the authors take the precaution to indicate that in different countries, ''recognized religious scholars'' may have the last word.",

It is good news to learn that the Court of Justice of Madrid finally cleared the physicians involved in the ''Legan\u00e9s case'' [46] from any wrongdoing. A very interesting initiative, which should be replicated elsewhere, is the choice of end of life decisions as an indicator of good quality of care by the Spanish society of critical Care, the SEMICYUC. Servillo and Striano [47] tell us how in Italy, as in Spain, end-of-life care gives fierce debates, further enhanced by the strong influence of the Catholic Church in such matters. Dr Riccio, an anaesthetist involved in the Welby case has also been relaxed by justice. The debate is now focused on the introduction in the Italian law of ''advanced directives''. As in other countries where laws are mute on end of life decisions, the role of professional societies (the SIAARTI in Italy) is crucial in guiding physicians and in protecting them occasionally.",

Erectile dysfunction was found to contribute in 27% of men younger than 40 years and 51% of men 40 years or older. Age, being single, Injury Severity Score, and depression were associated with a poor sexual function.

As for all severity of illness systems, external validation studies are needed to proof the prognostic performance in settings different than the one the score has been developed from. Ledoux et al. [49] undertook a prospective study in their institution to evaluate the performance of SAPS 3 and to compare it to two other systems, namely APACHE II and SAPS II. They included 802 consecutively to the ICU admitted patients over an 8month period. With respect to discrimination, APACHE II performed worse than SAPS II and SAPS 3 models. Calibration was unsatisfactory again for APACHE II and for the general SAPS 3 model, whereas it was satisfactory for SAPS II and the SAPS 3 model with the Central European equation. The authors concluded, that the SAPS 3 admission score and its model for Central and Western Europe was more discriminative and better calibrated than APACHE II, but it was not significantly better than the SAPS II. Since this study presents as a single centre study with a low patient number, the results have to be viewed with caution. Multicenter studies with higher patient numbers are required to determine the prognostic ability of a risk-adjustment system. Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) has only in the past decade received attention as a potential source of problems for critically ill patients. Several recent studies have highlighted the possible impact of increased intra-abdominal pressure on renal function. Dalfino et al. [50] studied the relationship between IAH and acute renal failure (ARF) in critically ill patients. They included all patients who were consecutively admitted during a 6-month period. IAH was defined as a IAP [ = 12 mmHg in at least two consecutive measurements performed at 24-h intervals. ARF was defined according to the failure class of the RIFLE criteria. Almost a third of their patients developed IAH. ARF developed in 19% of their patients, with a significant difference between the two groups: 43.2% in the IAH versus 8.1% in the non-IAH group (P \\ 0.05). Shock and low abdominal perfusion pressure were predictive factors for the development of ARF. A cut-off point of 12 mmHg had the best predictive power for the development of ARF. Although raw hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with IAH, risk-adjusted mortality rate was not different between the two groups. The authors concluded, that IAH is clearly an independent and strong predictor for the development of ARF. However, the contribution of impaired systemic hemodynamics should also be taken into account.",

They interviewed 149 patients who required [36 h of mechanical ventilation 2 months after ICU discharge. Eighty patients were also interviewed at 6 months. ICU recall was greater for events occurring at the end of critical illness; however, 18% of subjects had amnesia for the entire ICU course. Posttraumatic stress disorder prevalence was 17% at 2 months and 15% at 6 months. Recall of a delirious memory during critical illness was associated with more severe posttraumatic stress symptoms. Neither ICU recall nor posttraumatic stress symptoms were associated with the intensity of sedative administration during mechanical ventilation. Posttraumatic stress symptoms were lowest in patients either the most awake during mechanical ventilation or the least awake. In a prospective, randomised, single-blinded, controlled study, R\u00f6hm et al. [63] compared sevoflurane and propofol in terms of recovery times from sedation. A total of 70 patients after elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery received either sevoflurane (n = 35) or propofol (n = 35) for short-term postoperative sedation in the ICU. Mean extubation times from termination of sedation (the primary outcome) were significantly shorter with sevoflurane than with propofol (22 vs. 151 min). The length of ICU stay was comparable in both groups, but hospital length of stay was significantly shorter in the sevoflurane group. Costs for sedation per patient were similar in both groups. Suchyta et al. [64] compared mortality and discharge disposition in critically ill patients with and without drug or alcohol dependence and patients with and without psychiatric disorders. They found that patients with drug or alcohol dependence were at higher risk for ICU admission compared to the general population. However, the prevalence of psychiatric disorders was significantly lower than in the general population. Drug or alcohol dependence predicted shorter hospital length of stay. In a retrospective review of patient records over 2 years in 20 French city hospitals Lapostolle et al. [65] evaluated 838 patients with an elevated serum digitalis concentration (digoxin [ 1.95 ng/ml or digitoxin [ 23 ng/ml), following chronic or acute exposure. Of these, 67 (8%) had received antidotal therapy with Fab fragments. Five independent factors were associated with the use of antidotal therapy: acute overdose (OR 15.74), Fab fragment availability in the hospital (11.06), serum potassium (1.81), and heart rate (0.96). Mortality was significantly lower in Fab-treated (6%, 4/ 67) than untreated patients (15%, 117/770). The authors concluded that antidotal therapy is underused in patients with an elevated digitalis concentration and the use of identical criteria for antidotal treatment after acute and chronic poisoning should help optimize outcomes.",

In the past decade, the use of CO gas in pre-clinical experimental models of disease has produced some remarkable data indicating that its therapeutic delivery to mammals could alleviate inflammatory processes and cardiovascular disorders. However, the inherent toxic nature of CO cannot be ignored, knowing that inhalation of uncontrolled amounts of this gas can ultimately lead to serious systemic complications and neuronal derangements. From a clinical perspective, a key question is whether a safe and therapeutically effective threshold of CO can be reached locally in organs and tissues without delivering potentially toxic amounts through the lung. The advent of CO-releasing molecules (CO-RMs), a group of compounds capable of carrying and liberating controlled quantities of CO in cellular systems, could be a plausible alternative in the attempt to overcome the limitations of CO gas. Although in its infancy and far from being used for clinical applications, the CO-RMs technology is supported by very encouraging biological results. ",
