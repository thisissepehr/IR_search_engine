In the mouse, only the genes coding for IFN-l2 and -l3 are present. Unlike mouse and human type I IFNs (IFN-a/b), which exhibit strong species specificity, type III IFNs were reported to act in a cross-specific manner. We reexamined the cross-specificity and observed that mouse and human IFN-l exhibit some species specificity, although much less than type I IFNs. Mouse IFN-l3 displayed clear species specificity, being 25-fold less active in human cells than the closely related mouse IFN-l2. This specificity likely depends on amino acids in a helices A and F that diverged from other IFN-l sequences. Human IFN-l4, in contrast, retained high activity in mouse cells. We next developed a firefly luciferase-based reporter cell line, named Fawa-l-luc, to detect IFN-l in biological fluids with high specificity and sensitivity. Fawa-l-luc cells, derived from mouse epithelial cells that are responsive to IFN-l, were made nonresponsive to type I IFNs by inactivation of the Ifnar2 gene and strongly responsive to IFN-l by overexpression of the mouse IFNLR1. This bioassay was as sensitive as a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in detecting mouse IFN-l in cell culture supernatant, as well as in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage samples of virus-infected mice. The assay also enabled the sensitive detection of human IFN-l activity, including that of the divergent IFN-l4 with a bias, however, due to variable activity of IFN-l subtypes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "T ype I and III interferons (IFNs) are typically produced in response to viral infection, and these cytokines induce an antiviral state in target cells (Isaacs and Lindenmann 1957; Kotenko and others 2003; Sheppard and others 2003) . Type I IFNs consist of 13 IFN-a subtypes and IFN-b, -o (human) , and -z (mouse) -e and -k.

A fourth IFN-l subtype (IFN-l4) is present in a part of the human population, depending on a dinucleotide frameshift polymorphism upstream of the IFNL3 gene, which creates or disrupts the open reading frame (ORF) encoding IFN-l4 (Prokunina-Olsson and others 2013) .
