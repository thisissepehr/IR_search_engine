It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The incidence of LCOS after surgery is high in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). Therefore, determining the risk factors of LCOS has clinical significance for the management of CHD. This study aimed to analyze the risk factors of LCOS. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of children with CHD who underwent cardiac surgery at Shanghai Children's Medical Center between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2017. Demographic characteristics and baseline data were extracted from the health data resource center of the hospital, which integrates clinical routine data including medical records, diagnoses, orders, surgeries, laboratory tests, imaging, nursing, and other subsystems. Logistic regressions were performed to analyze the risk factors of LCOS. Results: Overall, 8660 infants with CHD were included, and 864 (9.98%) had LCOS after surgery.

This difference was attributed to the probable difference in age. Neonatal myocardium is physiologically immature [18] [19] [20] [21] and every procedure affects the incidence of LCOS differently [22] .

During routine hypothermic CPB, the heart is damaged by hypothermia, ischemiareperfusion, or hyperkalemia, which is associated with an excess risk of postoperative LCOS and severe arrhythmia [24] . Yau et al. found that during hypothermic CPB, the myocardium acquires energy through anaerobic metabolism, leading to the accumulation of lactic acid. After reperfusion, aerobic metabolism cannot be resumed immediately in cardiomyocytes owing to low temperature, but still anaerobic metabolism can occur for a short period. Whereas, patients with mild hypothermia CPB are less affected [25] . The study found that the inflammatory response mediated by CPB caused pulmonary vascular endothelial damage, which changed the pulmonary vascular reactivity. These cause excessive thromboxane production and reduced endogenous nitric oxide production, which can lead to pulmonary vasoconstriction and formation of pulmonary microthrombus. Further, these changes could induce pulmonary vascular resistance, which increases after CPB [26] . Then, the right ventricular afterload increases, which is significantly associated with right ventricular dysfunction and LCOS. Obesity or high BMI is a common factor associated with poor prognosis. A propensity score-matched analysis found that obese (BMI, \u226530 kg/m 2 ) patients who underwent surgery for type A acute aortic dissection had higher postoperative mortality rates. Moreover, a previous report stated that obesity was significantly associated with increased risk of LCOS and other postoperative morbidities [27] . However, in our study, there was no significant correlation between BMI and LCOS risk after cardiac surgery in CHD children. This correlation is different from the results of the abovementioned study on adults and we ascertain that the 'obesity paradox' may explain this inconsistency.

Circulation temperature, myocardial preservation using HTK, and usage of residual shunt after surgery were independent risk predictors for LCOS.
