Seventy-four patients with hematological malignancies with HLA-matched (77%) and mismatched (23%) donors were analyzed in this study. Thirty-four patients (45%) were considered as high risk patients. Sixty-eight patients received standard conditioning regimens with Bu/Cy or TBI/Cy. Six patients received an intensified conditioning regimen with the addition of etoposide, thiotepa or melphalan. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of prednisolone, cyclosporine and methotrexate. Groups were matched for patient, donor, transplant characteristics and HLA compatibility. Peripheral blood stem cell collection led to the collection of a higher number of CD34 + and CD3 + cells in comparison to bone marrow collection. Leukocyte engraftment in the PBSCT group occurred in 14 days (median; range 6-26 days) and in the BMT group in 19 days (range 9-29 days; P \u03fd 0.02). The time of platelet engraftment did not differ significantly. The incidence of grades II-lV acute GVHD in the group of HLA-identical patients was 35% in the PBSCT group and 25% in the BMT group (P \u03fd 0.33, log-rank). However, there was a significant difference (P \u03fd 0.05, logrank) in incidence and time to onset of acute GVHD II-IV comparing all patients, including the 17 mismatched transplants. Disease-free survival was 51% (19 patients) with a median of 352 days and 59% (21 patients) with a median of 760 days for PBSC and BMT transplants, respectively. In conclusion, our results indicate that allogeneic PBSCT led to significantly faster leukocyte engraftment but is associated with a higher incidence and more rapid onset of severe acute GVHD comparing all patients, including the 17 mismatched transplants. However, the incidence of severe acute GVHD in HLAidentical patients was not different between the PBSCT and BMT groups.

Firstly, rapid engraftment could be demonstrated in patients with PBSC transplants in comparison to those with BMT. 3, 4 This might reasonably be expected to reduce infection and bleeding risk. Thus, published reports have indicated that PBSCT is associated with a reduced need for antibiotics, shortened hospital stays and lower 200-day mortality. 5 Moreover, reports have also suggested that immunological recovery is more rapid following allogeneic PBSC transplants. 6 Typical PBSC products contain three to four times more CD34 + cells and up to 20 times higher T cell levels than do typical marrow products. 7 Therefore, the main concern with allogeneic PBSC transplantation is graft-versushost disease (GVHD). Reports to date, however, have not identified an increased incidence or severity of acute GVHD following PBSCT. 8 On the other hand, increased incidence and severity of chronic GVHD have been reported by some groups. 9, 10 The results of the first randomized trial comparing allogeneic PBSCT and BMT presented at the ASH meeting in 1999 confirmed no difference in incidence of aGVHD and a tendency to higher incidence of chronic GVHD in patients transplanted with mobilized peripheral stem cells. 11 It should be noted that this trial showed a higher mortality rate in patients transplanted with bone marrow stem cells and a significantly higher overall survival for PBSCT patients. This important message should be confirmed in other randomized trials. For instance, other authors 12 presented the results of a randomized trial comparing allogeneic BMT and PBSCT from related donors. The incidence of GVHD was equivalent in the two groups (48% vs 57%), the incidence of extensive chronic GVHD was significantly higher in the PBSCT group (77%) than in the BMT group (27%) and no difference of overall survival could be demonstrated (at 1 year 67% and 59%, respectively). The higher number of T cells may also induce a more potent GVL effect. PBSCT may be advantageous for allogeneic donors. 13, 14 Only 3-7% of donors experienced complications 15 from stimulation by G-CSF but no general anesthesia was necessary. The procedure is carried out in an outpatient setting. Nevertheless, one concern has been the ethics of using unrelated donors Bone Marrow Transplantation to mobilize PBSC, although the side-effects after administration of G-CSF to normal donors are tolerable after several years of follow-up. Thus, in the last 2 years only a few patients who received PBSCT from unrelated donors have been reported. We started unrelated allogeneic PBSC transplants in 1995 and 37 patients have been transplanted in our department. We report our experience with allogeneic PBSCT in comparison to BMT in a matched pair analysis.

Thirtyseven patients received PBSCT from unrelated donors from 1996 up to May 1999 and 37 patients received BMT. Ringden et al 23 also reported a significantly faster neutrophil engraftment in the PBSCT group. It should be noted that the patients in BMT group were not treated with G-CSF post-transplantation, which may influence the difference in neutrophil recovery between BMT and PBSCT. The use of G-CSF after transplantation is not the practice in our center because of the effect on residual leukemia which could not be excluded. 5 However, the incidence of infections was not different in the two study groups, probably as a consequence of the small number of patients with documented infections in both groups. Nevertheless, the overall number of documented infectious complications and death from severe infections was lower in the PBSCT group. Time to platelet engraftment did not differ in the two groups, which contrasted with the experience of other studies in related settings. 2, 3 Recently, Blaise et al 24 reported in a randomized trial that PBSCT resulted in quicker neutrophil and platelet recovery than does BMT from sibling donors. However, a higher occurrence of chronic GVHD was observed. The main finding in this study is the significantly higher incidence and shorter time of onset of severe acute GVHD in patients who received PBSCT. The rate of acute GVHD observed after allogeneic PBSCT from HLA-identical siblings has been reported to be similar to BMT. 25 In a recently published multicenter analysis 26 we demonstrated a trend to a higher incidence of severe acute GVHD in the PBSC group compared to the BM group (30% vs 20%). The results in our recent analysis of transplants from unrelated HLA-identical donors 26 corresponds with the published data, 27 especially with the results of prospective, randomized trials in transplants from related donors presented at the meeting of ASH last year. 11, 12 Including the data from transplants of HLA-non-identical unrelated donors might introduce differences due to matching mistakes. The number of patients with donors who were not HLA identical was 10 in the PBSCT group and seven in the BM group. Another reason for the higher incidence of acute GVHD might be the number of high risk patients. In the PBSCT group it was somewhat higher in comparison to the BMT group (20 vs 14) . In addition, the CMV positivity of patients prior to transplantation was known to be a risk factor for acute GVHD. CMV positivity was not matched, so there were significant differences between the two groups (the number of negative patients was 14 in the PBSCT and 23 in the BMT group, respectively). It should also be noted that the CD34 + as well as CD3 + cell differential is significantly higher in PBSC grafts in comparison to BM grafts, and may partly explain the higher incidence of acute GVHD in PBSCT group. The impact of G-CSF on T cell functions as well as on alloreactivity for both GVH and GVL effects is still unclear and needs further investigation. 28, 29 The incidence of chronic GVHD in the PBSCT and BMT groups was not different (58% and 42%, respectively). With regard to overall survival, relapse and relapse-free survival, there was no difference between outcome in patients receiving PBSCT compared with the BMT group. However, it should be noted that the end survival and DFS in the BMT group showed a trend to be better probably due to the slightly worse TRM in the BMT group. This is in agreement with the experience in the HLA-identical siblings as well as in the unrelated setting. 2, 3, 26, 27 The follow-up of our patients was short and the data need to be re-evaluated with time. We conclude that PBSCT from unrelated donors is a safe procedure and results in faster neutrophil engraftment than BMT. The eventual disadvantages for the donors need several years follow-up in order to answer different questions raised with regard to the treatment with G-CSF. However, according to the data published to date, 30, 31 it appears that G-CSF treatment and PBSC collection have an acceptable short-and long-term safety profile in normal donors. Thus, for donors the benefits are obvious, but for recipients the benefits are less so. The incidence of acute GVHD in HLA-identical PBSC transplants was not higher than in BM transplant patients. Finally, the results of this study provide evidence that PBSCT from unrelated HLA-compatible donors can be safely administered as an alternative to BMT. However, the use of PBSCT from HLA-mismatched donors needs further investigation and follow-up with regard to acute and chronic GVHD. On the other hand, the important antileukemic effect of chronic GVHD should not be neglected. We propose to use PBSC as a source for unrelated donors providing that these donors are HLA identical, identified by using serological for class I and genomic for class II HLA typing. With regard to PBSC from HLA-mismatched donors further investigations and follow-up are needed in order to answer the question on the incidence of acute as well as chronic GVHD. In conclusion, we believe that PBSCT by using HLA-mismatched unrelated donor is feasible and safe in a carefully selected patient population.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 702, "end": 703, "text": "5",
