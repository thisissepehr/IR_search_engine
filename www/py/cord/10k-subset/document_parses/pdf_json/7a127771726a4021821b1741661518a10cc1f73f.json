Clinical features at this age are atypical and may be confused with more common illnesses such as bronchiolitis. All were very dicult to manage. Ventilation was required for apnoeas in \u00aeve cases, seizures in two or respiratory failure in two. Complications included hypotension in seven cases, pulmonary hypertension in one, pneumothoraces in two, seizures in \u00aeve and co-infection in \u00aeve. Two cases were referred for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and six died. Infection was con\u00aermed either at post mortem or by culture from pernasal swabs. The mother or other close family members were symptomatic at the time and thought to be the source of infection. Conclusion The nine cases suggest a signi\u00aecant resurgence of the infection, which may be fatal in early life. If reporting continues to increase, the immunisation schedule will need to be reviewed and secondary transmission prevented where possible, to protect this vulnerable pre-immunisation group.",

All presented with a history of poor feeding and cough. The cough was described as paroxysmal in \u00aeve cases. Additional symptoms included apnoeas (\u00aeve cases), fever (four cases), vomiting (two cases) and seizures (three cases). Typically cough, anorexia and poor feeding were noticed \u00aerst, suggesting an upper or lower respiratory tract infection. Fever and or vomiting were cause for further concern in these very young infants. Increased respiratory distress, apnoeas and seizures quickly followed, leading to admission and eventually intubation, which was required very shortly after presentation in two cases. Presenting during the bronchiolitis season, the \u00aerst four cases seen were initially thought to be bronchiolitis or bronchopneumonia and were treated as such, with oxygen and\u00afuids to maintain hydration. In case 3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was isolated early on from the admission nasopharyngeal aspirate. However, all infants received broad spectrum antibiotics either because of their age, the severity of their symptoms or their negative RSV status. Pernasal swabs were not considered in the \u00aerst three cases. The total white cell count and total lymphocyte count were very high in all cases. The percentage of neutrophils was greater than lymphocytes in \u00aeve cases.",

All cases required ventilation with high pressures and desaturations were common. Thick tenacious secretions were a constant feature and were very dicult to manage. Co-infection was found in four cases and may have contributed to their poor respiratory status. Their Xrays showed hyperin\u00afation and collapse consolidation. In two infants pneumothoraces developed. In seven cases, inotropic support was necessary. Case 8 had signi\u00aecant problems with pulmonary hypertension and suprasystemic right ventricular pressures, despite the use of pulmonary vasodilators.

Diagnosis was made only at post mortem in three of our cases because of short illnesses characterised by rapid clinical deterioration. The typical features of mid childhood, which clinicians remember, are not the same as those in the non-immunised very young infant, in whom diagnosis may be delayed. Pertussis was not the \u00aerst diagnosis considered at presentation in the \u00aerst of our cases, particularly during a bronchiolitis epidemic. The symptoms reported did suggest possible respiratory infection; bronchiolitis or bronchopneumonia being most likely. However, the important dierentiating symptom of a paroxysmal cough was reported in only \u00aeve of the nine cases and should not be considered as pathognomic in infancy. No patients developed an inspiratory whoop. Apnoeas secondary to respiratory infection are common in this age group but seizures are unusual in this context. They should serve as a useful diagnostic clue, as they are a signi\u00aecant and well recognised complication of pertussis encephalopathy. The total white cell counts and lymphocyte counts were very high in all of these severe cases and were useful indicators of probable pertussis. We found that the percentage of neutrophils may be greater than that for lymphocytes. In the later cases the above features were recognised immediately as neonatal pertussis, allowing earlier con\u00aermation of the presence of pertussis from pernasal swabs.",

Five patients had seizures, suggesting encephalopathy, and \u00aeve had evidence of respiratory co-infection. The possible source of the pertussis infection is shown in Table 1 . These close family members all had recent illnesses with a prolonged cough. In case 3 the contacts (two cousins) had been noti\u00aeed as probable pertussis cases. Unfortunately, even when pertussis was considered in the contact family members, no pernasal swabs were taken. Reporting has increased recently despite good current local and national vaccination uptake [8] . However protection is temporary and Bordetella pertussis continues to circulate, often silently [6] amongst those who have been vaccinated. In addition there is now a cohort of young adults whose parents declined vaccination because of concerns about possible adverse eects (encephalopathy), who are susceptible to primary infection and may pass infection on to their own infants. With the help of our local public health laboratory service we attempted to trace the immunisation records of the parents thought to be contacts. Unfortunately we were unable to \u00aend documentary evidence of their immunisations.",

It is unclear why so many severe cases have occurred in such a small area, although a smaller group has been reported in the London area [8] . The susceptible infant may be at increasing risk from an increasing population of unprotected adults or poorly protected siblings. If this series is followed by others, or by increased reporting in other age groups then, methods of improving protection to the susceptible infant must be reconsidered. The importance of maintaining high vaccination rates at the earliest possible age cannot be overstated [3] . However, neonatal vaccination does not provide adequate protection [1] . Furthermore, it has been suggested that the change to an accelerated programme of vaccination in the UK (2, 3 and 4 months) may be responsible for the increase in cases [8] by leading to shorter immunity in siblings. The vulnerable newborn, may be at risk from all family members in whom pertussis has been forgotten or not been considered likely. If newer acellular vaccines are acceptable, then boosting in early childhood and adolescence may help reduce secondary transmission of pertussis to newborn babies [7] . These cases serve to remind us that pertussis continues to circulate and how dicult to manage it can be when spread to young infants, in whom it may be fatal.",
