            "text": "HIV-related stigma has been associated with worse health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among people living with HIV (PLWH). Little is known about how different types of HIV-related stigma (i.e., anticipatory, internalized, or enacted HIVrelated stigma) influence HRQoL and whether these relationships differ by gender. The sample included 912 PLWH aged 18 years or older enrolling in HIV care at four health facilities in Tanzania. HRQoL was assessed with the life satisfaction and overall function subscales of the HIV/AIDS-Targeted Quality of Life (HAT-QoL) instrument. Sex-stratified multivariable logistic regression modeled the association of anticipatory, internalized, and enacted HIV-related stigma on poor HRQoL. Across all participants, the mean life satisfaction score was 63.4 (IQR: 43.8, 81.3) and the mean overall function score was 72.0 (IQR: 58.3, 91.7). Mean HRQoL scores were significantly higher for women compared to men for overall function (5.1 points higher) and life satisfaction (4.3 points higher). Fourteen percent of respondents reported recent enacted HIV-related stigma and 13% reported recent medium or high levels of internalized stigma. In multivariable models, high internalized and high anticipatory stigma were significantly associated with higher odds of poor life satisfaction and poor overall function in both men and women. Psychosocial interventions to prevent or reduce the impact of internalized and anticipatory stigma may improve HRQoL among persons in HIV care. Future research should longitudinally examine mechanisms between HIV-related stigma, poor HRQoL, and HIV care outcomes.",

This policy, often referred to as Treat All, is informed by evidence that earlier HIV treatment is associated with improved outcomes across the HIV care continuum and reduced HIV transmission [2] [3] [4] [5] . In recent years, as access to ART has expanded, due in part to the implementation and scale-up of Treat All policies, HIV-related morbidity and mortality have decreased and life expectancy among PLWH has increased [6, 7] . In many settings, treatment of HIV has shifted to a chronic care model of disease management [8] . Given these shifts in the treatment and clinical outcomes among PLWH, greater attention is needed to their health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and potentially modifiable factors that influence HRQoL among PLWH.",

            "text": "HIV-related stigma is common among PLWH and associated with poor HRQoL [14] [15] [16] . HIV-related stigma can take many forms including anticipatory stigma, internalized stigma, and enacted stigma. Anticipatory stigma concerns individuals' expectations of experiencing enacted HIVrelated stigma as a result of being HIV-positive. Enacted HIV-related stigma involves experiencing stigmatizing behaviors or negative treatment due to one's HIV status. Internalized HIV-related stigma occurs when an individual adopts stigmatizing beliefs about PLWH and applies these stigmatizing beliefs to themselves. In the framework of the relationship between HIV-related stigma and the health and well-being of PLWH [17] , Earnshaw and Chaudoir posit that different dimensions of HIV-related stigma may differentially impact health-related outcomes, including HRQoL, and emphasize the importance of understanding the relationship between HIV-related stigma and quality of life disaggregated by type of stigma and type of well-being measure assessed [17] . Despite consistent findings that HIV-related stigma is associated with worse HRQoL, understanding of how different dimensions of stigma (e.g., internalized, anticipated, or enacted) are related to different components of HRQoL, remains limited, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, which continues to bear a disproportionate burden of the HIV epidemic. A more nuanced understanding of the relationship between HIV-related stigma and HRQoL is warranted.",

            "text": "Previous research has found differences in how men and women living with HIV perceive and experience HIVrelated stigma [13, 18, 19] . For example, among PLWH in the United States, HIV disclosure concerns were associated with increased health-related worries among women, but not among men living with HIV [20] . Among PLWH in China, women living with HIV endorsed significantly higher internalized HIV-related stigma compared to men [21] . Gendered experiences of HIV-related stigma may be informed by differences in the social and economic position of men and women across societies and by the social construction of both stigma and gender across settings. Previous research has found that women living with HIV often indicate concerns about the real or anticipated social and relational impact of HIV-related stigma in their lives and the lives of their children or other family members, including social rejection, isolation, and violence [22] . Research with women living with HIV in the U.S. found that women's decision-making around HIV disclosure prioritized protecting social relationships and minimizing potential negative social effects of disclosure [22] . Given these gendered differences in experiences of HIV-related stigma, the relationship between HIV-related stigma and HRQoL may be meaningfully different for men and women living with HIV. However, little is known regarding whether the relationship between types of HIV-related stigma and types of HRQoL differs by gender. It is important to understand to what extent HIV-related stigma and HRQoL function differently among men and women. The objectives of this analysis were (1) to examine the relationship between three dimensions of HIV-related stigma (anticipatory, internalized, and enacted stigma) and two components of HRQoL (overall function and life satisfaction) and (2) to assess whether these relationships differ by gender.",

However, the directionality of this relationship has varied across studies. Similar to current findings, studies with individuals initiating ART in Ethiopia and with individuals testing HIV-positive in Kenya found that HRQoL was higher among women than men [13, 28] . However, another study with ART patients in Ethiopia found that men reported significantly higher quality of life compared to women [29] . The mechanisms through which gender influences HRQoL across settings and populations warrant further investigation. High levels of anticipatory stigma were significantly associated with poor overall function and poor life satisfaction among both women and men. The authors were unable to identify previous research on the relationship between anticipatory HIV-related stigma and HRQoL from sub-Saharan Africa. However, among PLWH in Sweden, anticipatory stigma, measured by concerns about public attitudes, was significantly associated with poor physical HRQoL [30] . In this same study, though, concern regarding disclosure of one's HIV status, another component of anticipatory HIVrelated stigma, was not significantly associated with worse HRQoL [30] . Among PLWH in the United States, disclosure concerns were significantly associated with poor HRQoL among men and women [20] . Future research should examine to what extent the relationship between anticipatory stigma and HRQoL varies by the component of anticipatory stigma assessed (e.g., disclosure concerns, concerns about public attitudes). Factors that mediate or moderate the relationship between anticipatory stigma and HRQoL should also be examined, including whether such mediating or moderating factors differ by gender. For example, effective coping strategies or greater social support may reduce the impact of anticipatory stigma on poor HRQoL while maladaptive coping mechanisms, limited social support, or social isolation may have a synergistic effect on the relationship between anticipatory stigma and HRQoL. Greater understanding of the relationship between anticipatory stigma and HRQoL can lead to the identification of potential intervention targets to mitigate the impact of anticipatory stigma on HRQoL and improve the quality of life of PLWH. Such research is particularly needed with PLWH in sub-Saharan Africa where the prevalence and impact of HIV-related stigma remain high [31] [32] [33] .",

While research into the relationship between internalized HIV-related stigma and HRQoL in sub-Saharan Africa remains limited, a study of PLWH in Spain similarly found that internalized stigma was associated with worse HRQoL [34] . This study also found that the relationship between internalized stigma and HRQoL was mediated by group identity, suggesting that interventions to foster social cohesion and increase social support may be a promising strategy to mitigate the negative impact of internalized stigma on HRQoL [34] . Peer support interventions may be particularly effective at reducing the prevalence and impact of internalized HIV-related stigma, particularly as a longitudinal study with PLWH in Uganda found that internalized stigma was associated with subsequent low levels of social support [35] . However, findings related to the relationship of peer support and HIV treatment outcomes remain equivocal [36] [37] [38] . Internalized stigma has been consistently associated with poor mental health, including depressive symptoms and poor emotional well-being. Examination of the extent to which psychological distress mediates the relationship between internalized HIV-related stigma and poor HRQoL and whether this relationship differs by gender is warranted. Evidence-based mental health interventions for PLWH should consider incorporating components to reduce and manage internalized HIV-related stigma and adapted interventions should be implemented and evaluated.",

However, enacted stigma was significantly associated with poor life satisfaction among women. Previous research into the relationship between enacted HIV-related stigma and HRQoL remains equivocal. Among PLWH in Spain, enacted stigma was significantly associated with worse HRQoL [34] . However, no significant relationship between enacted stigma and HRQoL was found when examined among PLWH in Sweden [30] . Neither study examined the relationship between enacted stigma and HRQoL separately by gender. However, research with women living with HIV in the United States found that women were particularly concerned about the negative social consequences of HIV-related stigma [22] . Similarly, research in South Africa found that the level of HIV-related stigma reported by one's community, operationalized as the percent of people in a village endorsing HIV-related stigma, was negatively associated with HIV testing among women, but not men [39] . Gender differences in the relationship between enacted stigma and HRQoL may be influenced by differences in the social positioning and socialization of women compared to men. If women place greater emphasis on preserving social relationships, women may be more negatively impacted by stigmatizing views and behaviors of community members compared to men. Additional research into the relationship between gender, enacted stigma, and HRQoL is needed.",

Future work should assess this relationship across the care continuum and examine whether there are critical points (e.g., diagnosis, disclosure) at which PLWH are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of stigma and poor HRQoL. Additionally, given the cross-sectional nature of our study, temporality of the relationship between HIV-related stigma and HRQoL could not be established. It is possible that people with poor HRQoL are more sensitive to experiences of HIV-related stigma. Longitudinal research is needed to better understand pathways between HIV-related stigma and HRQoL. Further, data were collected from individuals at four HIV clinics in Tanzania. As such, results cannot be generalized to PLWH in other settings or PLWH not engaged in care. As both HIV-related stigma and HRQoL may pose barriers to engagement in care, the relationship between HIV-related stigma and HRQoL may be meaningfully different among PLWH not engaged in care. In addition, anticipatory stigma items in this study did not assess anticipatory stigma specifically in a health care setting or from health care workers. Future research should examine anticipatory stigma specifically in relation to health care settings. Finally, this analysis examined two aspects of HRQoL. Future work should examine the relationship between HIV-related stigma and other components of HRQoL.",

More research is needed to understand to what extent the mechanisms between these types of stigma and HRQoL differ by gender and whether gender-specific anticipatory and internalized stigma reduction intervention strategies are warranted.
