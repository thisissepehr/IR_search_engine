A common misperception is that Ebola virus spreads through air, Lacking knowledge regarding the transmission route of Ebola (and other diseases with similar severity and propensity to spread) is pivotal, as adequate knowledge provides the basis for the general public, risk groups and HCW to understand the rationale for the measures national authorities take. Insufficient knowledge may cause misunderstandings and anxiety, especially with respect to travellers and HCW, who return from affected areas and need to be able to have access to public facilities in daily life [26] . This is the reason why the control measures and their communication strategies are comprehensively described in disease specific guidelines and national preparedness plans [27] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 576, "end": 580, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 581, "end": 585, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 586, "end": 590, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1237, "end": 1241, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1416, "end": 1420, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Knowledge"}, {"text": "The Dutch authorities have adopted the policy to actively monitor temperature in high risk contacts instead of applying home quarantine, which restricts the individual freedom of movement.

To understand and endorse the measures, appropriate knowledge about Ebola transmission is needed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Knowledge"}, {"text": "We observed a discrepancy with regard to knowledge among the two study groups. As we expected, a higher level of knowledge among HCW is significantly associated with lower levels of perceived fear and lower levels of perceived susceptibility. On the contrary however, having intermediate or high levels of knowledge was significantly related to higher levels of perceived fear and a need for additional information of the general public. These results thus suggest two important aspects: 1) while authorities believe it is important that the general public has (some level of) knowledge with regard to Ebola in order to promote adequate preventive behaviour, this may unintentionally lead to higher levels of perceived fear and an additional need for information, and 2) HCW appear to benefit from higher levels of knowledge. These findings highlight the relevance of specifically tailoring the information to pre-defined target groups and enhancing the relevance of the information presented [26, 28] . They also show that authorities and communication specialists need to focus their efforts in maintaining the delicate balance between too much and just enough information.

Although perceived severity was high, the perceived susceptibility to Ebola and perceived fear of Ebola among both groups was low. However, when specifically looking at the different HCW, our results show that nurses and ambulance staff have a significantly higher level of perceived fear and perceived susceptibility in comparison to physicians. One possible explanation for this difference may be related to the fact that nurses and ambulance staff are likely to be the first ones to get in contact with a (suspected) Ebola patient and generally have more physical contact with the patient.
