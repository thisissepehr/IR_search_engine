We conducted a systematic review of outbreak investigation reports, extracted individual incubation data and summary estimates, tested for heterogeneity, classified studies into subgroups with limited heterogeneity, and undertook a meta-analysis to identify factors that may contribute to the distribution of the pathogen's incubation period. Twenty-eight studies were identified for inclusion in the review (1 of which included information on 2 outbreaks), and the resulting I 2 value was 77%, indicating high heterogeneity.

We observed that in studies in which all clinical outcomes were reported, including HUS, a longer mean incubation period was recorded than in other studies; however, we did not identify a significant association between HUS and the length of incubation period, as also reported by Werber et al (22) . We suspect that some of the heterogeneity we observed in the incubation-period distribution across outbreaks may be explained by the differences in the case definitions. Reporting with more specific case definitions and even separation of results across cases on the basis of different symptoms is thus an example of a feature of standard reporting that could promote better evidence synthesis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 251, "end": 262, "text": "Razzaq (35)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 709, "end": 713, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Even with detailed and standardized reporting of outbreaks, there are limitations to using the published literature to study factors associated with incubation time. For these questions, individual patient data allowing analysis of host factors such as premorbidity, ongoing medications, and dose are required, as well as outbreak-level characteristics such as mode of transmission and pathogen characteristics. This raises questions on how best to capture, store, and make accessible data from individual outbreaks in a way that will allow joint analysis and align with the increasing trend toward individual-patient data meta-analysis in the synthesis of randomized, controlled trial evidence.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The studies included in our review were predominantly outbreak reports for which incubation period was not the main goal of investigation and the population studied were cases being investigated as part of the outbreak. Therefore, there is little possibility of encountering publication bias or selection bias due to the reported incubation period. Furthermore, we found no evidence of small-study effect. Although focusing on sharing information on incubation period protected against publication bias, it no doubt contributed to the exclusion of studies, with the majority of studies we identified not meeting the quality assessment criteria for reporting of incubation period. Extracting individual data involved using an online data-extraction tool and a manual process of selecting each data point, which is open to human error and could alter the reported incubation period. However, these errors are likely to be small. Results, therefore, are not likely to be substantially biased, although they are based on a restricted number of studies in which usable data were reported.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, we confirmed in this review of studies that the STEC incubation period varied across outbreaks, and we identified several subgroups, some of which had incubation periods far longer than expected, based on standard estimates. We identified age and attack rate as factors that may influence the distribution of incubation period. However, there was insufficient information to explain the relationship between these factors and incubation period or to study the impact of many individual patient-level factors on incubation period. Our work highlights the opportunities afforded for information synthesis across outbreaks to support evidence-based practice and the challenges to be overcome to optimize reporting and ultimately support combined analysis across outbreaks if the full potential of these natural experiments is to be exploited.
