However, it is unknown whether increased TIPE2 is protective against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. In the current study, we aimed to investigate whether increased TIPE2 can exert protective effects in a mouse model of ALI induced by LPS. Methods We administered TIPE2 adeno-associated virus (AAV-TIPE2) intratracheally into the lungs of mice. Three weeks later, ALI was induced by intratracheal injection of LPS into BALB/c mice. Twenty-four hours later, lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was acquired to analyse cells and protein, arterial blood was collected for arterial blood gas analysis and the determination of pro-inflammatory factor levels, and lung issues were collected for histologic examination, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), TUNEL staining, wet/dry (W/D) weight ratio analysis, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity analysis and blot analysis of protein expression. Results We found that TIPE2 overexpression markedly mitigated LPS-induced lung injury, which was evaluated by the deterioration of histopathology, histologic scores, the W/D weight ratio, and total protein expression in the BALF. Moreover, TIPE2 overexpression markedly attenuated lung inflammation, as evidenced by the downregulation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in the BALF, lung MPO activity, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the serum. Moreover, TIPE2 overexpression not only dramatically prevented LPS-induced pulmonary cell apoptosis in mice but also blocked LPS-activated JNK phosphorylation and NF-\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation. Conclusions Our study shows that the increased expression of AAV-mediated TIPE2 in the lungs of mice inhibits acute inflammation and apoptosis and suppresses the activation of NF-\u03baB and JNK in a murine model of ALI.",

After binding with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), LPS induces the activation of downstream signalling pathways responsible for the infiltration of inflammatory cells (i.e., neutrophils) into the lungs and the production of proinflammatory cytokines [8] . The binding of LPS to TLR4 also induces I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation and degradation, promotes the nuclear translocation and activation of NF-\u03baB, and subsequently leads to the excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [e.g., tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6] [9] . Moreover, LPS can activate JNK, a member of the MAPK family. Activated JNK can phosphorylate numerous mitochondrial proteins, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl [10, 11] . Subsequently, cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria, which leads to the activation of death signals [12] . JNK activation is essential for LPS-induced macrophage apoptosis during sepsis [13] .",

To analyse the cell numbers, 100 \u03bcl of BALF was centrifuged onto slides by a Cytospin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). After the slides were dried, the cells were fixed and stained using Wright Stain solution (32857, Sigma, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The number of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) was classified by a laboratory technologist blinded to the experimental design to determine the percentage of neutrophils. The frozen BALF supernatant was thawed and thoroughly mixed, and the total protein concentration was determined by the BCA (bicinchoninic acid) method.",

Thus, identifying novel therapeutic treatments for ALI is urgently needed. In the current study, we found that TIPE2 overexpression attenuated LPS-induced ALI in mice via its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. First, TIPE2 overexpression significantly improved LPS-induced lung injury, as evidenced by changes in histopathology, the lung W/D weight ratio, BALF protein concentration, and arterial blood gas. Second, TIPE2 overexpression decreased inflammatory cell infiltration into the lungs and pulmonary cell apoptosis. Third, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum of LPS-challenged mice were reduced by AAV-TIPE2 treatment. Fourth, TIPE2 overexpression inhibited LPS-induced NF-\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation and JNK phosphorylation in the lungs. Finally, TIPE2 overexpression prevented lung cell apoptosis by downregulating the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-8) and upregulating the expression of an anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2) in the lungs of LPS-challenged mice.

JNK, a member of the MAPK family, is critical for LPS-induced apoptosis in macrophages [13] . LPS triggers JNK phosphorylation, which subsequently mediates the phosphorylation of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2/Bcl-xL) and upregulates proapoptotic Bax. When the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio is elevated, the mitochondrial membrane potential changes, causing the release of cytochrome C into the cytosol from the mitochondria [29] and resulting in the activation of caspase-9 and then caspase-3 to induce apoptosis [30] . Several previous studies have shown that TIPE2 contains a death effector domain (DED) and that the overexpression of TIPE2 is associated with enhanced survival and the inhibition of caspasemediated apoptosis through the inhibition of the activities of the apoptotic enzymes caspase-8 and caspase-3 [31] [32] [33] . In addition, the depletion of TIPE2 enhances cell death [34, 35] . In the current study, we found that AAV-TIPE2 administration remarkably inhibited the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3) and JNK phosphorylation and restored the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. These findings suggest that epithelial TIPE2 drives the protective effects against LPS-induced injury and that the inhibitory effect of TIPE2 overexpression on LPS-induced cell apoptosis may be attributed to its suppression of JNK activation.",
