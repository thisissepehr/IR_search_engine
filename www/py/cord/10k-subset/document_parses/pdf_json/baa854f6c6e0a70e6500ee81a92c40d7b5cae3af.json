This reaction has been shown to proceed by a two-step mechanism where the intron catalyzes transesterification reactions at specific phosphodiester bonds, with conservation of the total number of bonds [1]. Self-splicing requires only an exogenous guanosine co-factor, and no external energy source. One prediction of this mechanism is that the reaction should be readily reversible. A related reaction, cyclization of the excised intron RNA, was previously shown to be reversible [2]. We have demonstrated that the self-splicing reaction of the",

            "text": "The sequences immediately upstream of the 5' splice site have been shown to pair with sequences in the intron during self-splicing, and this pairing is required for activity. The same sequences are also involved in another hairpin in the spliced ribosomal RNA, which is the natural site of the Tetrahymena Group I intron. We have constructed a number of variants where the wild-type hairpin is either strengthened or destabilized, and tested them in both forward and reverse splicing reactions. The ability to form a stable hairpin in the flanking exon sequences lowers the rates of both the forward and reverse reactions. Thus, at least in vitro, the pairing within the exon sequences competes with pairing of the 5' exon and the intron which is necessary for catalysis. A refolding of the RNA following excision of the intron may serve to shift the equilibrium in favor of the normal spliced products. Recent efforts in our laboratory have concentrated on optimizing ribozyme design for increased activity in vitro and testing activity in vivo. We are currently assessing both in vitro and in vivo ribozyme activity directed against cat m R N A and two pathogenic RNA targets. The two pathogen model systems are the 6000nt ssRNA genome of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and the 371 nt circular ssRNA of citrus exocortis viroid. In vitro kinetic studies indicate that the secondary structure of the target RNA greatly influences ribozyme activity. Studies will also be discussed which describe the in vivo activity of ribozymes directed against cat mRNA and TMV infection in transgenic plants.",

The Fv and F,u fragments can be purified to homogeneity in a single step by hapten affinity chromatography.

As a model system, we used the particularly well studied phosphorylcholine binding antibody McPC603. Most importantly, the crystal structure of its Fab fragment with [2] and without [3] bound hapten is known. The genes encoding the variable domains (Vn and VL) had been obtained by DNA synthesis.

Fv fragments are very difficult to prepare proteolytically and had, before the availability of this expression system, not been characterized in detail. Since they constitute the smallest antigen binding fragment and since they are promising models for structural studies as well as in cancer diagnostics and therapy, it is essential to have a complete understanding of their physical properties. The association constant between the Vn and VL domains was determined by crosslinking and fluorescence experiments. We found that VL dimerizes with itself with an association constant similar to that of the heterodimer, but VH does not. The binding of the hapten favors the association to the correct Fv fragment and stabilizes the Fv fragment at low concentrations. The dissociation of the two chains also limits their stability at physiological temperatures. From the knowledge of the structure, altered proteins were constructed that are up to 60-fold more stable against irreversible denaturation. These stable variants are covalently crosslinked by an engineered intermolecular disulfide-bond, by a connecting peptide linker or by glutaraldehyde [5] . Such small and stable fragments with full binding activity might extend the range of applications of antibodies in biotechnology and medicine.",

            "text": "One of the essential features of enzyme catalysis is a structural complementarity of the protein to the transition state of the reaction. Antibodies raised against stable analogs of the transition state have previously been shown to have catalytic function in certain instances. We have now shown that the recombinant Fv fragment of McPC603 possesses catalytic activity toward the hydrolysis of a carbonate ester. The kinetic rate constants were determined. This made it possible to carry out a systematic investigation of this catalysis by site directed mutagenesis, binding studies, kinetics and crystallography to get further insight into the structural requirements of an efficient catalytic antibody. The presence of leukocyte elastase (HLE) in the serum, released from damaged or overloaded leukocytes, with its high unspecific proteolytic activity, is considered to be one of the main factors effecting mortality in septic shock syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure (MOF) after polytrauma and burns shock. The shock syndrome is accompanied by loss of factors required for haemostasis (disseminated intravascular coagulation; DIC), activation of complement, and increased vasodilation and vaso-permeability. In emphysema and rheumatoid arthritis low levels of HLE inhibitors and high levels of proteolytic activities have been implicated. Elastase activity has also recently been implicated in local hormone release during inflammation. The natural inhibition of elastase is complicated by the inactivation of alpha-l-antitrypsin by oxygen, and also by oxygen radicals created by lysosomal oxidases. On this basis it is considered that a strong, highly specific elastase inhibitor could function as an effective therapeutic agent for the syndromes mentioned above, and in particular reduce mortality associated with ARDS, MOF, septic and burns shock. The validity of various animal models in testing this hypothesis will be discussed.",

Model structures were developed on the basis of known structures of analogous inhibitors and proteases. Computer aided protein design (CAPD) was used to model the structure of human leukocyte elastase and human PSTI from the known structures of porcine pancreatic elastase (36% homology) and porcine PSTI (67% homology) [5] . Models of the protease/inhibitor complexes were used to select variants which should give the highest affinity (and specificity; via modelling chymotrypsin complexes) for human elastase. This was of particular value in view of the astronomical number of possible variants, even when confined to the approximately ten residues postulated as being directly involved in direct contact between protease and inhibitor. Crystal structures of PSTIvariant/protease complexes not allow a critical evaluation of the modelling process. A vector pMAMPF, which allows sequencing, site specific mutagenesis, product synthesis and secretion in E. coli, without subcloning steps, simplifies the genetic segment of the design cycle. This production system also had the added advantage that product was produced in the medium in active form and as such could be used directly for analysis of inhibitory parameters, without renaturation steps.",
