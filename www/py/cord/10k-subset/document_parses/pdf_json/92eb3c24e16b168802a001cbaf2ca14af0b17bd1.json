The choice of which measures to use frequently depends on costs-the cost of illness and the cost of risk mitigation. The cost of illness is determined by the likelihood that people will become infected if they make contact with an infectious individual, together with the cost of treatment and loss of earnings if they do become infected. The cost of risk mitigation is the resources sacrificed to reduce risk by some amount. Diseases that are perceived to be highly infectious and life-threatening warrant greater private risk mitigation effort than diseases that are perceived to be only moderately infectious and with few symptoms (Sanchez 2001; Leroy et al. 2005; Team 2014 ). Diseases that are novel, and therefore uncertain in their effects, warrant greater private risk mitigation effort than diseases that are more familiar (Taylor et al. 2001; Presanis et al. 2009; Rubin et al. 2009 ). It follows that private risk mitigation efforts might be expected to evolve over the course of an epidemic as information improves.

Vaccination, in such cases, is said to be an impure public good. It confers benefits on the individual, but also on those with whom the individual interacts (Sandler et al. 2002) . On the other hand, people avoiding infection now by sequestering themselves may simply delay the moment at which they become infected and infectious and hence may unwittingly prolong an epidemic . Private diseaserisk mitigation, in this case, is an impure public bad. In providing benefits to the individual, it imposes costs on society. Because people cannot capture any wider benefits they confer, and are not confronted by any wider costs they impose, they have little incentive to take those benefits and costs into account when making their decisions. The public good (bad) is therefore under-provided (over-provided).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 492, "end": 513, "text": "(Sandler et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The general response of public health authorities to the under-provision of private disease risk mitigation is the adoption of social distancing measures that include quarantines, travel restrictions, and school closures.

Since private disease risk mitigation efforts reflect the costs of illness and illness avoidance, interventions that change those costs are also among the options available to public health authorities . In this paper, we consider policy instruments that close the gap between the socially and privately optimal levels of disease risk mitigation. Such policy instruments align the socially and privately efficient solutions by aligning the social and private cost of diseaserisk mitigation. We assume private disease-risk mitigation strategies similar to Morin et al. (2015) and consider a control that operates on the cost of illness. This has parallels with the health belief model originally developed in the 1950s, which supposes that private health-risk mitigation depends on beliefs about the likelihood and consequences of contracting disease, the efficacy and costs of the proposed action, and the decision makers' capacity to implement the action (Rosenstock 1974) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 829, "end": 848, "text": "Morin et al.

It is the product of the probability that an event will occur and the cost of the event if it does occur. The two most common approaches to the management of disease risk are mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation implies an action that reduces the probability that the individual will fall ill. Adaptation implies an action that has no effect on the probability that the individual will fall ill, but reduces the cost of illness. The probability that an infection will occur, cbP SI (/(t)), depends on three things: contact volume c, the probability that contact results in infection b, and the probability that contacts are with infectious individuals P SI (/(t)), a function of mitigation effort /(t). We treat the first two of these parametrically, although we acknowledge that they may be affected by, respectively, strategies to quarantine infectious individuals or to reduce activity levels , and strategies such as prophylaxis or vaccination (Weycker et al. 2005) . We focus instead on the probability that contact will be made with infectious individuals. It was shown in Fenichel et al. (2013) that despite travel restrictions during the H1N1 swine flu outbreak, individuals did not cancel travel plans (reduce contact volume) so much as alter the timing of their travel.

The only information available to individuals is the expression of symptoms in either themselves or others.

We suppose that all individuals who do not show symptoms-because they have either not become ill, are asymptomatically ill or have recovered from illness-are treated equally by others. The use of the affinity framework allows three factors to determine the volume of contact between groups of like individuals: (1) the size of each group, (2) the nominal activity level or disease-free contact rate of each group and 3) the relative affinity/disaffinity between groups. In what follows, we treat the affinity/disaffinity between groups as endogenous to the epidemiological system. Susceptible individuals, or at least individuals who believe themselves to be susceptible, choose the people with whom they mix in order to alter the probability that they will encounter infectious individuals and subsequently become ill themselves. In the most general case, people who believe themselves to be susceptible at some time are taken to include all those who have been free of symptoms up to that time. This includes those who are actually susceptible, those who are asymptomatically infectious and those who are recovered but have never had symptoms. We hold the nominal level of activity (the contact rate) constant throughout the course of the epidemic and take it to be equal for all individuals. This makes it possible to consider only the effect of changes in mixing preferences. See Fenichel et al.

The main difference between the approach here and previous use of affinity models is that we treat the elements / ij (t) of the affinity matrix are private choice variables. They may be interpreted as the effort that the representative individual in disease state i makes to avoid individuals in disease state j, if / ij (t) < 0, or to associate with individuals in disease state j, if / ij (t) > 0. If the representative individual in every disease state i makes no effort to avoid individuals in disease state j, and vice versa, then / ij (t) = 0. We then have classic proportionate mixing. We take zero elements in the affinity matrix to be evidence of 'avoidance-neutrality.' That is, they show the representative individual to be neutral about a pairing event with someone from another disease class. By contrast, negative (positive) elements reflect the desire of the representative individual in one disease state to avoid (seek out) individuals in other disease state. Avoidance, / ij (t) < 0, can result from individuals in both states wishing to avoid one another; individuals in one state wishing to avoid individuals in other states who may be neutral to the pairing; or individuals in one state wishing to avoid individuals in other states more strongly than those individuals favor the pairing. Similarly, engagement results from individuals in both states favoring the pairing; individuals in one state seeking out individuals in other states who may be neutral to the pairing; or individuals in one state wishing to engage with individuals in other states more strongly than those individuals wish to avoid the pairing. This is a similar measure to that used in models of assortative mating (Karlin 1979 ) and selective mixing (Hyman and Li 1997) and is a form of a contact kernel (Gurarie and Ovaskainen 2013) .

Which is the more cost-effective in any real application would depend on the effort needed to achieve the desired epidemiological effect and the relative cost of effort in each case.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Within the SIR model, each individual has perfect information on their infection state and all relevant information on others (infectious or not). The other three models each introduce error due to the existence of asymptomatic classes. They also introduce changes in disease dynamics that affect the socially optimal level of risk mitigation. Whether it is socially optimal to intervene in ways that increase or decrease private disease risk mitigation depends on the effect of mitigation on the time profile of infections. The point has already been made that mitigation reduces peak prevalence but also prolongs epidemics. When the additional cost of the longer (and potentially fatter) tail of an epidemic outweighs the benefits offered by a reduction in peak prevalence, the PHA will intervene to reduce private risk mitigation-and vice versa (as shown in Fig. 5) .The advantages of instruments that operate on the cost of illness are that they can be put in place in advance of an outbreak and that they operate automatically. Diseasespecific insurance or treatment costs, for example, can be established in advance but only influence private decisions when an outbreak occurs. We have not considered particular instruments in this paper and note only that the effect of each depends on how it would impact the relative costs and benefits of mitigation actions. There is a range of cost-based instruments that could be applied to diseases whose properties are well understood. The instruments that should be applied to specific diseases are those expected to cost effectively close the gap between socially and privately optimal disease risk mitigation. While we consider only policy instruments determined in advance of an epidemic-i.e., that correspond to the known properties of known diseases-we acknowledge that this would not be reasonable in the case of novel or emerging infectious diseases. There is less scope for the use of incentives of this type in such cases, but it would be worth considering how the choice of r D might evolve during the course of an epidemic in future work.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 861, "end": 868, "text": "Fig. 5)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Finally, it is worth noting that any intervention of this kind in a real-epidemiological-economic environmental would have distributional consequences. It would make some people better off and some people worse off. We have abstracted from any distributional consequences in this paper by treating all individuals in each disease class as homogeneous, and by assuming that the payoff to contact is the same for everybody. Implementation of a policy instrument of this kind in a real system would, however, need to take account of the distributional goals of the society concerned. Infectious diseases are a comparatively small part of the burden of disease in highincome countries, but still the largest part of the disease burden in low-income countries. This is precisely where distributional issues are of greatest concern and where individuals are least able to bear the cost of disease-risk avoidance.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Participation of senior citizens in the swine flu inoculation program: An analysis of health belief model variables in preventive health behavior", "authors": [{"first": "W", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Aho", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1979, "venue": "Journal of Gerontology", "volume": "34", "issn": "", "pages": "201--208", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Measured voluntary avoidance behaviour during the 2009 A/H1N1 epidemic", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Bayham", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "N", "middle": ["V"], "last": "Kuminoff", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Q", "middle": [], "last": "Gunn", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": ["P"], "last": "Fenichel", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2015, "venue": "Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences", "volume": "282", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Toward a unified theory of sexual mixing and pair formation", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Blythe", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Castillo-Chavez", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Palmer", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Cheng", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1991, "venue": "Mathematical biosciences", "volume": "107", "issn": "", "pages": "379--405", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Empirical evidence for the effect of airline travel on inter-regional influenza spread in the United States", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Brownstein", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Wolfe", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": ["D"], "last": "Mandl", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2006, "venue": "PLoS Med", "volume": "3", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Interaction, pair formation and force of infection terms in sexually transmitted diseases.
