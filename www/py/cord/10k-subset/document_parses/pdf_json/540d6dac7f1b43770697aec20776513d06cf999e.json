Data from animal studies on pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses suggested that resistant strains have either reduced transmissibility or similar fitness and transmissibility compared with sensitive strains. 130-132 The reasons for the differences in observations are unclear, but may be related to the use of different virus strains in these studies, or the low number of animals used. The possibility of natural emergence of compensatory mutations or compensated resistance mutations to neuraminidase inhibitors warrants continued close surveillance of sequence evolution in influenza viruses.SAFETYSafety in Adults and Adolescents Established in Controlled Clinical TrialsCumulative safety and tolerability data for oseltamivir use in adults and adolescents in randomized controlled trials come from 4592 study participants exposed to oseltamivir, 2647of whom received it as treatment and 1945 of whom received it for influenza prophylaxis. Clinical trial experience in children and other groups is described below (see Safety in Special Populations). In treatment studies, the most frequently reported AEs were nausea, vomiting, and headache. The majority of these events were reported on a single occasion, usually on the first or second treatment day, and resolved spontaneously within 1-2 days without the need to stop treatment. In prophylaxis studies, the safety profile was similar, despite a longer duration of dosing: nausea, vomiting, headache, and pain were the most frequently reported AEs (Table 5). Other AEs were reported in \u22651% of oseltamivir recipients in the treatment and prophylaxis studies, but at a similar or lower incidence compared with placebo recipients. These included many symptoms and complications that are typical of influenza infection, including nasal congestion, cough, sore throat, muscular or joint pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, and dizziness, as well as infections (such as bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infections), dysmenorrhea, and insomnia (Roche, data on file).Post-Marketing SurveillanceOther AEs in people receiving oseltamivir have been identified from spontaneous reports received during post-marketing use.Hypersensitivity reactions, many of which were allergic skin reactions, such as dermatitis, eczema, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported.6,7,133 Hepatitis and elevated liver enzymes have also been reported in patients with ILI receiving oseltamivir, and cases of gastrointestinal bleeding. . In the first report, torsades de pointes (a form of ventricular tachycardia) occurred in two women who had been previously treated with sotalol for arrhythmias and were given oseltamivir for confirmed or suspected influenza; in one of these women, the causative relationship was doubtable, occurring 6 days after treatment finished, although prolongation of the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) was observed during the treatment course.134 In the second report, two women treated with oseltamivir for suspected pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza developed bradycardia.135 The results of a retrospective cohort study, however, suggest that the risk of recurrent adverse cardiovascular outcomes such as heart failure and sudden cardiac death in patients with existing cardiovascular disease is lower in those treated with oseltamivir than those not treated,136 and a similar benefit has been shown with respect to stroke and transient ischemic attacks. 137 An expert review of data from preclinical and clinical studies, published literature, and spontaneous reports in the Roche Drug Safety database indicates no association between oseltamivir treatment and cardiac arrhythmias, other cardiac disorders, or sudden death in adults or children, and no increased susceptibility to cardiac events in Japanese individuals (Hoffmann-La Roche, data on file).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF7": {"text": "and adolescents. These have included convulsions as well as delirium-like symptoms, such as altered consciousness, confusion, abnormal behavior, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, and nightmares, and in some cases, have resulted in accidental injury. Although NPAEs were described in patients with influenza infection before the introduction of oseltamivir, 138-140 reports of such events during 2005-2006, principally in Japanese patients, suggested that they were associated with oseltamivir treatment. 141 In January 2008, the US product label was changed following guidance from the Pediatric Advisory Committee of the US Food and Drugs Administration; the changes included a description of neuropsychiatric symptoms that can occur during influenza infection, irrespective of drug therapy, and noted the uncertain causality of such symptoms. The new labeling also notes that symptoms can appear abruptly and that \"injurious behavior\" includes fatal outcomes. Similar labeling changes were recommended for other antiviral influenza medications. In 2008, Roche published an assessment of influenza-associated NPAEs in patients who had received oseltamivir. 103 The article included a wide range of evaluations aimed at assessing the prevalence and genesis of such events. It included post-marketing surveillance of spontaneously reported AEs, prospective clinical trial data, and results of large retrospective observational studies based on US health claims data. This was supplemented by results of pharmacokinetic studies in humans and animals, analysis of possible genetic factors, and pharmacodynamic interactions with neurotransmitter and transport mechanisms and metabolic pathways. The article concluded that the data then available did not indicate that oseltamivir administration increased the risk of NPAEs in influenza patients, and no mechanism through which oseltamivir or its metabolites could cause or aggravate such events could be identified, although a contribution from the drug could not be conclusively ruled out at that stage. 103 More recently, an additional analysis of a large patients claims database produced results consistent with those summarized in the review by Toovey et al., 103 showing that influenza patients treated with oseltamivir had a lower risk of NPAEs than patients who receive no antiviral treatment. 142 In early 2010, a new comprehensive safety evaluation on oseltamivir was performed, to determine whether any new safety signals emerged during the period when pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was the dominant strain, and to assess tolerability and safety in the patient sub-populations that had been underexposed to oseltamivir up to that point. 143 This evaluation compared reports of AEs in the US and Japan during the first 8 months of the 2009 influenza pandemic (May 1-December 31, 2009) with post-marketing reports during the pre-pandemic period, ie, before May 1, 2009. The analysis did not indicate that any new safety signals emergedduring the pandemic period, and also showed that NPAEs were significantly less common (crude reporting rates per million exposures) during the pandemic than the pre-pandemic period.143", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF8": {"text": "since been substantially expanded as a result of the increased use of oseltamivir during the 2009-2010 pandemic.

Early clinical trials in patients with mild disease showed that treatment could lessen symptom severity, shorten illness duration, and reduce the risk of complications, and that preventative use could protect against illness, but recent studies in seriously ill patients have demonstrated its value in avoiding more severe outcomes, including death; the latter evidence includes experience in avian H5N1 influenza and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza. Natural resistance to oseltamivir in the H1N1 seasonal virus strain emerged in 2007, but this strain virtually disappeared after the arrival of the novel H1N1 strain that caused the 2009 pandemic. Drug-induced resistance remains very rare, and oseltamivir has proved to be well tolerated by all population groups. New research now under way will provide more information on the efficacy and safety profile of oseltamivir in vulnerable population groups, such as very young infants and immunocompromised patients, as well as in severely ill patients in the ICU setting. Some studies will investigate resistance in more detail, and others will assess the effectiveness of highdose treatment regimens, particularly in patients with avian H5N1 influenza. Despite WHO having declared in August 2010 that the 2009 influenza pandemic outbreak has ended and the post-pandemic stage has started, influenza will remain a serious challenge for healthcare professionals. New emergencies are inevitable, including the possible evolution of avian H5N1 and other influenza viruses into strains with more efficient human-to-human transmissibility. The threat from influenza has evolved in the 10 years since the arrival of oseltamivir, and it is certain that the threat will continue to evolve in the future.

The evaluation of safety during the 2009 pandemic outbreak did not reveal any new safety signals in 189 elderly patients exposed to oseltamivir.143 H5N1 viruses can give rise to a severe influenza that may not respond to standard antiviral treatment regimens, and the efficacy of extended treatment courses and higher daily doses for influenza treatment is being tested in current clinical trials. An indication of how higher oseltamivir doses might be tolerated is provided by a study in which 194 healthy volunteers received doses of 225 and 450 mg twice daily for 5 days; no evidence of drug accumulation was found, and although nausea, vomiting, and dizziness were more common at the higher doses than standard dose, tolerability was good, with no adverse safety findings. 156I.V. AdministrationIn January 2010, the EMA CHMP announced that an i.v. presentation of oseltamivir could be used on compassionate use grounds for the treatment of critically ill patients with influenza infection who do not respond to, or cannot be given, neuraminidase inhibitor treatment either orally or by inhalation. As ofFebruary 2011, approximately 50 treatment packs had been issued. Roche-sponsored clinical studies are ongoing to establish the safety and tolerability of intravenously administered oseltamivir in infected infants aged 0-1 years (NCT01053663), children aged 1-12 years (NCT01033734), and adults and adolescents aged \u226513 years (NCT01050257).For the 10 years during which oseltamivir has been available, several studies have been performed to evaluate the pharmacoeconomics of the drug in a range of patient populations. These have mostly measured the costeffectiveness or cost-benefit of oseltamivir as an influenza treatment, compared with interventions such as vaccination and \"usual care\" regimens (simple analgesics and cough remedies), and occasional reviews of the accumulating evidence base have helped to assess the range of economic benefits that can be achieved. 157-159 The review of oseltamivir and zanamivir by Lynd et al. 158 showed that the former was cost-saving from a societal perspective and cost-effective from a healthcareonly perspective, but the authors highlighted the variability in methods and assumptions used in the studies which were reviewed, and how this limited the scope of the conclusions. The systematic review of 2008 by Postma and colleagues took a different viewpoint, by measuring how cost-effective oseltamivir was relative to usual influenza care regimens. The authors discovered limitations in some of the analytical methods used and the range of assumptions made -for example, most papers that the authors selected failed to describe clearly how altering the disease valuation (willingnessto-pay value) affected the results of the study's analyses, and although most papers in the review assessed economic benefit by using decision models, the important assumptions behind the models varied widely, such as the expected rate of confirmed influenza in individuals presenting with ILI, and the amount of work-time lost to illness. Nevertheless, the authors found that oseltamivir treatment was cost-effective relative to usual care in the four population groups studied (adults and adolescents, children >15 years of age, elderly patients, and those in high-risk groups). 159 Decision models continue to be the basis for economic analysis in some more recent studies. One group who assessed cost-effectiveness of oseltamivir used as PEP from the United Kingdom (UK) healthcare payer's perspective showed that the intervention would be costeffective compared with a usual-care treatment strategy if SARs in household contacts were \u22658%. 160 Other groups have examined costeffectiveness in the treatment setting. An analysis that compared oseltamivir treatment for ILI with usual care in the Netherlands focused on patients at elevated risk of serious complications from influenza infection; the study found that, from the societal perspective, oseltamivir was cost-saving for chronically ill adults (of any age) and cost-effective (\u20ac1759 per life-year gained) for otherwise healthy elderly patients. 161 A US group used a decision-analysis model to confirm the findings of the 2008 Postma et al. 159 review, ie, that treatment of ILI with oseltamivir was costeffective compared with usual care in highrisk adults, healthy adults, elderly adults, and children, from both the societal and healthcare payer perspectives. 162 Notably, the authors analysis assumed that treatment would be ineffective if given later than 48 hours after symptom onset or in individuals infected with virus resistant to oseltamivir. A recent study on the cost-effectiveness of oseltamivir treatment in Japan also investigated the effects of emerging resistance on economic benefit. The authors found that, from a healthcare payer's perspective, the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was US$3320 and, from a societal perspective (considering the cost of lost work time), oseltamivir was dominant; however, if the incidence of resistant virus exceeded 27%, oseltamivir was no longer dominant. Allowing for the emergence of resistance and other uncertainties, the authors calculated an 80% probability that the drug would be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay level of US$50,000/year. 163 Most recently, the economic benefits of antiviral therapies have been evaluated in the setting of pandemic mitigation. Before and during the 2009 pandemic, pandemic response strategies attracted much attention, but as with the simpler cost-effectiveness question above, the relative benefits of each mitigation measure depended closely on assumptions about, for example, the virulence of the pandemic virus and how quickly and widely the pandemic would spread. The most commonly evaluated mitigation measures to date are treatment and/or prophylaxis with stockpiled antivirals, vaccination, school closures, and travel restrictions. In a review of 12 studies on this topic by Lugner and Postma, 164 five studies that specifically evaluated stockpiling of antiviral drugs showed that this measure would be cost-effective assuming it was used to treat symptomatic individuals, and could also be cost-effective if used for prophylaxis in some scenarios. This review also discussed the merits of dynamic models, ie, those that measure disease transmission, in relation to static or decision-tree models for valuation assessments, and concluded that dynamic models produce a more valid estimate of cost-effectiveness. One of the studies reviewed by Lugner and Postma that used this approach (a stochastic transmission model) to evaluate a range of mitigation measures, fully accounting for the cost of stockpiling and delivery of antivirals, was the analysis by Sander et al.165 This study demonstrated that full targeted antiviral prophylaxis (FTAP), ie, coverage of household contacts as well as 60% of work and school contacts, was the most effective single strategy, slightly outperforming pre-vaccination and more restricted antiviral prophylaxis measures -FTAP reduced the number of cases by 54% at a cost of $127 to society.165", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF13": {"text": "Davies BE, Aceves Baldo P, Brewster M.
