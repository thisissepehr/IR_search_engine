Though the incidence of VLBW infants has remained stable in the United States at approximately 1.4%,(1) infants with VLBW account for upwards of 35% of all birth-related hospital costs. (2, 3) Studies have demonstrated substantial costs associated with prematurity-related morbidities, with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) being the most prevalent, affecting an estimated 22-45% of VLBW infants in the United States. (4) (5) (6) BPD may be the most expensive individual morbidity in VLBW infants, with reports of costs for initial hospitalization over two times higher than those without BPD. (6, 7) While the pathophysiology of BPD itself initially is lung-related, infants with a diagnosis of BPD are at increased risk for late-onset sepsis, longer hospital length-of-stay (LOS), cerebral palsy, long-term neurodevelopmental difficulties, long term pulmonary morbidities as well as socioeconomic effects on the family and support system. (8) (9) (10) Infants with BPD are more than twice as likely to be re-admitted to the hospital during the first year of life, (11) and the health and financial impact of having BPD are profound and extend far beyond the initial birth hospitalization. (9) Though BPD rates have remained largely stagnant, there is evidence that quality improvement projects can successfully reduce BPD. (12) In addition, there are clinical interventions that have been shown to help decrease BPD, including vitamin A, surfactant, caffeine, postnatal corticosteroids, breast milk and different ventilation strategies, including non-invasive ventilation. (13) (14) (15) (16) Some of these interventions (e.g. breast milk (15) , caffeine (17) ) are even cost-saving. A comprehensive understanding of the economic burden of BPD more broadly and beyond the birth hospitalization will help inform future research on potential cost effectiveness of quality improvement efforts and interventions to reduce BPD.

First, infants with BPD tend to have more comorbidities and complications compared to those without and this is likely reflected in the increased median length of stay of over a month for the birth hospitalization (103 days vs 66.5 days). While length of stay is an important contributor to the increased hospitalization cost of BPD, infants with BPD also used resources more intensely as reflected by their higher median cost per day compared to those infants without BPD ($3470/day vs $2575/day).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "As the development of BPD itself is multifactorial and the causal pathway arguably contains many factors, we also did a subanalysis comparing VLBW infants without any comorbidities to VLBW infants with only BPD and no other comorbidities (as in, we excluded all infants with NEC, ROP, IVH, late onset sepsis). In this subanalysis, infants with BPD alone still had an initial hospitalization cost of over $100,000 more than VLBW infants without any morbidities. Therefore, BPD is likely an independent risk factor for significantly higher hospitalization costs during the first year of life. Similar difference in costs between infants with and without BPD has been reported by Patel et al who found median costs of birth hospitalization in an infant with BPD as $269,004 vs $117,078 in infants without BPD and by Russell et al who found that BPD was the single costliest morbidity.(7, 15) These prior studies, however, have focused on birth hospitalization alone.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In this study, infants with BPD required re-hospitalization at significantly higher rates and had a longer length of stay as well as cost per day during the re-hospitalization. While these numbers demonstrate the significant economic impact of having BPD, our study also confirms the burden of prematurity in general, with approximately 19% of all VLBW infants re-hospitalized regardless of BPD diagnosis highlighting the significant healthcare utilization by premature infants beyond hospitalizations. Our rates of rehospitalization are lower than a previously reported study in infants < 33 weeks GA born in 1995-1999 that found hospitalization rates to be 49% vs 23% in the first year of life for infants with BPD vs no BPD.(11) And while it is known that the burden of readmissions is high, there is still a difference in reported numbers of readmission in extremely premature infants ranging from 27 to 49% in the first 12-18 months of life.(18) These differences may be reflective of a change in admission criteria, cohort characteristics, or outpatient preventative measures over the past 20 years.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "As a field, we are always looking for opportunities to reduce morbidity and mortality in the VLBW population, and thus reduce associated costs. With respect to BPD, the majority of studies have demonstrated that BPD rates have remained fairly stagnant during the past few decades. (19) While in search of the latest therapy to help reduce the rates of BPD, we must acknowledge there is variation in BPD rates across hospitals ranging from approximately 18% to 73% of VLBW infants which suggests that there is an opportunity for improvement within the current available therapies.(5) The large variation in BPD rates in similar populations suggests that there are opportunities to directly study not only what might reduce the variation and rates of BPD, but perhaps also what cost-effective strategies may be employed to treat infants with BPD. The use of early CPAP for preterm infants is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Fetus and Newborn, citing benefits from randomized controlled trials of decreased death or BPD, reduction in mechanical ventilation days, and reduction in postnatal corticosteroid therapy. (20) Our study did find that infants without BPD were significantly more likely to have any initial resuscitation with CPAP and a trial of CPAP prior to intubation (Table 2) . While this may be due to some underlying patient differences, there have been a handful of published quality improvement projects that successfully showed reduction in BPD at their centers through potentially better practice bundles which often include initial CPAP use in the delivery room. (12, (21) (22) (23) Other potential strategies that may reduce BPD but were not captured in our study include optimization of respiratory support strategies (such as volume targeted ventilation), use of mother's own milk, and routine administration of caffeine. (24) The best prevention strategy for BPD would be prevention of prematurity itself. However, the rates of VLBW infants have remained similar over the last several years, especially as Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) resuscitation and survival have increased. Furthermore, maternal morbidities appear to be increasing. In particular, the rate of maternal obesity has risen steeply with 1 out of 4 mothers in our cohort having a body-mass-index (BMI) of 30 or greater. Implementing strategies to reduce BPD may be a pressing need, as maternal obesity is significantly associated with an increased risk of prematurity as well as development of BPD specifically. (25) (26) (27) Thus a focus on prevention strategies in and outside of the NICU is even more critical. With a national estimated incidence of 15,000 infants with BPD(10), a 10% reduction in rates of BPD could roughly reduce health care costs by $150 million U.S. dollars annually in hospital facility costs associated with the first year of life alone. While some of those savings can be re-invested into quality improvement work related to BPD prevention, other can be used towards other programming and harm reduction as related to prematurity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 281, "end": 285, "text": "(19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1142, "end": 1146, "text": "(20)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1610, "end": 1614, "text": "(12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1615, "end": 1619, "text": "(21)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1620, "end": 1624, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1625, "end": 1629, "text": "(23)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1872, "end": 1876, "text": "(24)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2536, "end": 2540, "text": "(25)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2541, "end": 2545, "text": "(26)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2546, "end": 2550, "text": "(27)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1306, "end": 1315, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This study utilized a comprehensive population-based cohort with a large number of patients.
