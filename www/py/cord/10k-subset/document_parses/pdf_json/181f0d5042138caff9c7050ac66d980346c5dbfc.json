Inhalational anthrax is usually fatal if treatment is delayed [1] . The lethality of anthrax is primarily the result of the effects of anthrax toxin, which has 3 components: a receptor-binding protein known as \"protective antigen\" (PA) and 2 catalytic proteins known as \"lethal factor\" (LF) and \"edema factor\" (EF). Entry of the toxins into the cell is initiated by rapid binding of the 83-kDa PA to the cellular receptor, whereupon a furinlike protease cleaves the bound PA into an N-ter-minal 20-kDa protein (PA20) and a C-terminal 63-kDa protein (PA63) [2] . There is spontaneous oligomerization of PA63 into an antigenically distinct heptameric ring that can no longer be displaced from the cellular receptor. The heptamer binds up to 3 molecules of LF or EF. The resulting complexes enter the cell by endocytosis, and a conformational change induced by low pH results in the release of bound LF and EF into the cytosol. Several steps in this process could be targets for antibodies; for example, antibodies to PA might block receptor binding, oligomerization, or binding of LF and EF, and antibodies to LF and EF might prevent their binding to PA.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 116, "end": 119, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 610, "end": 613, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Passive immunization with polyclonal antibodies protects laboratory animals from the effects of anthrax toxins [3, 4] .

In ELISA, competition was also observed between 14B7 and W2 but not between 2D3 and W2 (figure 4). 14B7 binds to the site responsible for binding to the cellular receptor, whereas 2D3 does not compete with 14B7 and binds to a distinct binding site [16] .

However, the locations of these putative epitopes have not been precisely defined. For example, the epitope recognized by murine MAb 14B7 was suggested to be between Asp-671 and Ile-721, on the basis of the differential binding of 14B7 to different PA fragments generated through C-terminal deletions [16] . Because N-terminally deleted PA fragments were not tested, the epi-tope mapping for 14B7 could be incomplete. The previous observation that a PA fragment corresponding to aa 624-735 did not compete with PA for binding to the cell receptor [38] suggests that the region between aa 624 and aa 735 was not sufficient to generate the receptor recognition site.

Although production of an efficient anthrax vaccine is an ultimate goal, the benefits of vaccination can be expected only if a large proportion of the population at risk is immunized. The low incidence of anthrax suggests that large-scale vaccination may not be the most efficient means of controlling this disease. In contrast, passive administration of neutralizing human or chimpanzee MAb to a subject at risk for anthrax or exposed to anthrax could provide immediate efficacy for emergency prophylaxis against or treatment of anthrax. This finding is supported by a recent study [27] , which indicated that passive immunization with affinity-improved, humanized murine MAb 14B7 against PA (ETI-204) could efficiently protect rabbits before or after challenge with aerosolized Bacillus anthracis spores. However, humanized murine MAbs may retain some antigenic components of the original murine sequences and may elicit antibodies to the MAb in humans. Human-and chimpanzeederived MAbs would not be expected to have this problem, because the sequences of chimpanzee immunoglobulin genes are virtually identical to those of humans [8] [9] [10] 40] .
