For the safety of health personnel from droplet-transmitted infections, continuous National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-approved (N95) respirator use showed superior protection than targeted N95 respirator use, surgical mask use, or usual mask-wearing practices [11] . In a set of personal protection guidelines for health personnel responding to the COVID-19 epidemic published by Chinese physicians, it was recommended that personal protective equipment of various levels should be used as appropriate in multiple distinct zones. Those guidelines also indicated the specific devices that health personnel should use [12] . Therefore, ensuring an adequate supply of these devices is essential for the safety of health personnel. Antiseptic or safety techniques are dealt with in undergraduate coursework at medical schools and schools for other health professionals. For example, training on reducing the rates of needlestick or sharp injuries is necessary [13] . If health personnel follow the principles of safety and antiseptic techniques, the risk of nosocomial viral infections from patients will be lowered. For example, the methods to collect the specimen from the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and sputum were presented in Supplement 1.",
