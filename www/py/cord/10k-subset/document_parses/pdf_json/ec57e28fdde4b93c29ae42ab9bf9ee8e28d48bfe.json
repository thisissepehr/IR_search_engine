The major antigen demonstrated was a protein with a molecular weight of 31,000; this protein produced a serological response, usually strong, in almost all persons capable of an immune response to acute infection. Other important antigens were found at the molecular weights of 27,000,28,000, and 56,000. Although these results involve only a single human strain (WB), we have shown [12, 13] that other strains of G. lamblia isolated both from humans and from domestic and wild animals (sheep, dog, beaver, muskrat) in one geo-139 graphic area (Alberta) are antigenically very similar. These data support our use of a single strain as an antigen in this study. Moreover, all of these strains of a lamblia possess a protein antigen with a molecular weight of 31,000. Crossley and Holberton [14] characterized the disc cytoskeleton proteins of G. lamblia and founei that 20llJo of the organelle protein was madc up of a doublet they named \"giardin,\" which was found to have a moleCUlar weight of 30,000. Our surface-labeling experiment demonstrated the presence of a doublet that we measured to be at a molecular weight of 31,000-33,000. It would be expected that the major antigen in natural human infection would be a surface-labeled protein, and this expectation suggests that the protein at a molecular weight of 31,000 in 11 of our 12 normal patients is in fact giardin.

The polypeptides with molecular weights of 55,000 and 53,000 comigrated with bovine brain tubulin and are probably G. lamblia tubulin, a component of both flagellar axonemes and the attachment disc. Our surface-labeling experiment confirmed the presence of a major surface protein with a molecular weight of 55,000. Nine of the sera from normal patients and one serum from a patient with a congenital 19A deficiency contained antibody to an antigen with a molecular weight of 55,000. The response was, however, much weaker than it was to the protein with a molecular weight of 31,000. Again, surface proteins would be expected to produce a characteristic immune response, so it is possible that the protein with a molecular weight of 55,000 to which our patients responded may be G. lamblia tubulin.",

Monoclonal antibodies specific for the protein with a molecular weight of 82,000 adsorbed to fixed or liye parasites and indicated the surface location of the Protein. Our surface-labeling experiment confirmed the presence of this protein; however, none of our patients' sera reacted to it, a result suggesting that it is not a major antigen in natur?il human infection.",

            "text": "In summary, the major G. lamblia antigen recognized during human infection was a surface-exposed protein with a molecular weight of 31,000. This antigen, which may well be the disc component giardm described by earlier workers [14] , may be an important epidemiological marker for giardiasis. Further studies on larger numbers of patients will, however, be necessary to determine the course of time for developing this antibody and its persistence in the convalescent period. of the extreme difficulty with isolation and propagation in tissue culture, the candidate human enteric CVs (HECVs) have not been adequately characterized. Recently, we reported the possible implication of HECV strains in acute infantile gastroenteritis [5] . By immune electron microscopy (IEM) these strains appeared to be antigenically related to human coronavirus (HCV) OC43, a known respiratory pathogenic virus, but further characterization of the HECV strains was hampered by failure to isolate and propagate them in tissue culture. Beards et al. [6] described other fringed pleomorphic viral particles detected by electron microscopy in stools from children and adults with diarrhea. These viral particles were morphologically more similar to toroviruses of the Berne-Breda group (to which they were shown by IEM to be antigenically related) than to typical CVs. In this report, we attempted further characterization of two HECV strains purified from stools",
