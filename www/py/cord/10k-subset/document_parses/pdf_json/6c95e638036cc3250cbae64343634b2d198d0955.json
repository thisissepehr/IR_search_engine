Time(h) Fig. 1 Tissue concentrations of BW683C determined by gasliquid chromatography, Tissue homogenate (1 ml) was mixed with 0.5 ml ethylene glycol/water/2 M citric acid (2: 2: 1) and 5 ml hexane, The mixture was shaken for 30 min and centrifuged, The hexane layer was collected and mixed with 1 ml of a mixture of ethylene glycol/1 M Na 2 C0 3 (1: 9), shaken again and centrifuged, The upper layer was collected, dried in a stream of N 2 and the residue was dissolved in a small volume of toluene. Preliminary studies were carried out on the absorption and tissue distribution of 4',6-dichloroflavan in rats after its administration at 5 mg per kg by gavage as a suspension of finely ground particles in aqueous methylcellulose. Samples of plasma and selected tissues were collected at intervals up to 7 .5 h after dosing, and unchanged compound was determined by analysis of tissue extracts by gas-liquid chromatography with electron capture detection or by specific ion monitoring using a mass spectrometer. Highest concentrations were found in liver (Fig.  1) ; peak concentrations of -7.3 \u00b5M, some 350 times the IC 90 , were observed at 0.5 h, and these declined rapidly. Concentrations of compound well in excess of the IC 9 o value were also detected in plasma, lung, brain and adipose tissue, and the time of peak compound concentrations in lung samples seemed to occur between 2 and 4 h after dosing; compound concentrations in excess of the IC 90 level could still be found in lung 7.5 h after dosing. These results indicate that 4',6-dichloroflavan is adequately absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and that compound concentrations well above those required for maximum antiviral activity in vitro can be attained at doses as low as 5 mg per kg. The apparent persistence of this compound implies that infrequent administration may suffice to maintain effective antiviral concentrations in vivo.

BW683C showed no evidence of mutagenicity when tested in the presence or absence of a liver microsome preparation by the method of Ames 11.

We show here that these abnormal properties result from a mutation in the gene for the regulatory polypeptide chain of ATCase. We believe this to be the first report of a mutation in the gene for this regulatory chain.ATCase catalyses the first reaction specific to pyrimidine biosynthesis, the formation of N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate from L-aspartate and carbamoylphosphate. In E. coli, ATCase activity is modulated by feedback inhibition by CTP, the end product of the pyrimidine pathway, and activation by ATP, product of the parallel purine pathway 1 \u2022 Because E.coli ATCase exhibits the various types of regulatory interactions characteristic of allosteric proteins, it has been considered a model system and has become the most extensively investigated regulatory enzyme 2 \u2022 3\u2022 It differs, however, from most other allosteric proteins in that its catalytic and regulatory functions can be physically separated. Native ATCase, with a molecular weight (MW) of 300,000, consists of two trimeric subunits which possess catalytic activity but are insensitive to the allosteric effectors and three dimeric subunits which are catalytically inactive but bear the effector binding sites 4 -6\u2022 Thus, the completely different catalytic (C) and regulatory (R) chains (respective MWs 34,000 and 17,000) form a 2C 3 : 3R 2 structure. Zn 2 + ions, one per regulatory chain, are required to stabilize this quaternary structure 7 -9.The zinc-binding domains on the regulatory subunits participate in the R: C bonding domains essential for the allosteric interactions 10 . The gene pyrB coding for the catalytic chain of A TCase lies at 96 min on the E. coli chromosome 11 \u00b7 12 , but the localization of the gene for the regulatory chain has been hampered by the failure to obtain mutations affecting this gene.
