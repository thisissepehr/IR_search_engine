Of special interest is the clearly defined contour of the soft body. Because of the slight rotation, the outlines of the left and right sides of the carcass differ markedly. On the left side, the dense and rather long-haired pelage extends from the muzzle to the rump; long vibrissae and parts of the external ear are also visible. The outline of the right side, however, is formed by a thin, sparsely haired, and laterally expanded membrane which is spread out between the neck, wrist, ankle and proximal tail vertebrae. The boundary between the membranous skin and the compact, densely haired body is particularly obvious in front of the foreleg. The outline along the trunk is straight and parallel to the long axis of the body. We conclude that the membrane acted as a patagium and Eomys quercyi was a glider (Fig. 4) . Its preservation in a dorsoventral position results obviously from the presence of the gliding membranes. This discovery contradicts the supposition, based on the distribution and abundance of extant gliders, that the evolution of gliding and the occupation of the gliding niche were linked to rich tropical-forest ecosystems and that particular tropical vegetation structures figured prominently in this connection 9 \u00b7w. Glissant locomotion has developed by parallel evolution in four rodent families. Among extant rodents, these are flying squirrels and scaly-tailed flying squirrels. The patagia are supported in many forms by cartilaginous struts or calcars, which originate from the carpus in sciurids and from the olecranon process in anomalurids. Presumably, Eomys quercyi, like anomalurids, had a long strut from the elbow; a rod extends from the right olecranon of the Enspel specimen and seems to represent the medially displaced calcar. Flying squirrels are characterized by the elongation of the distal elements of the forelimbs (ratio of radius: humerus= 0.99-1.13 (ref. 11), which is not found in either Anomalurus (0.90) or E. quercyi (0.85). The dormouse family also includes a glider: its living members are non-gliding, mainly arboreal animals, the sole glissant species being Glirulus aff. lissiensis Hugueney & Mein, 1965 from the late Miocene of the Ardeche, France 12 \u2022 The fossil dormouse is similar to E. quercyi from Enspel in the dorsoventral position of the carcass and the imprint of the patagium.
