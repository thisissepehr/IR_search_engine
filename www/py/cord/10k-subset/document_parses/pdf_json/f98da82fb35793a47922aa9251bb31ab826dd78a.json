            "text": "The process of inferring phylogenetic trees from molecular sequences almost always starts with a multiple alignment of these sequences but can also be based on methods that do not involve multiple sequence alignment. Very little is known about the accuracy with which such alignment-free methods recover the correct phylogeny or about the potential for increasing their accuracy. We conducted a large-scale comparison of ten alignment-free methods, among them one new approach that does not calculate distances and a faster variant of our pattern-based approach; all distance-based alignment-free methods are freely available from http://www.bioinformatics.org.au (as Python package decaf-tpy). We show that most methods exhibit a higher overall reconstruction accuracy in the presence of high among-site rate variation. Under all conditions that we considered, variants of the pattern-based approach were significantly better than the other alignment-free methods. The new pattern-based variant achieved a speed-up of an order of magnitude in the distance calculation step, accompanied by a small loss of tree reconstruction accuracy. A method of Bayesian inference from /c-mers did not improve on classical alignment-free (and distance-based) methods but may still offer other advantages due to its Bayesian nature. We found the optimal word length k of word-based methods to be stable across various data sets, and we provide parameter ranges for two different alphabets. The influence of these alphabets was analyzed to reveal a trade-off in reconstruction accuracy between long and short branches. We have mapped the phylogenetic accuracy for many alignment-free methods, among them several recently introduced ones, and increased our understanding of their behavior in response to biologically important parameters. In all experiments, the pattern-based approach emerged as superior, at the expense of higher resource consumption. Nonetheless, no alignment-free method that we examined recovers the correct phylogeny as accurately as does an approach based on maximum-likelihood distance estimates of multiply aligned sequences.

A large number of studies (many of which are cited in Hall, 2005, and Ogden and Rosenberg, 2006) indicate that under a wide range of biologically relevant situations, suboptimality of the MSA diminishes the accuracy of the resulting tree. The sensitivity of this relationship can differ depending on the shape of the tree, branch length, inference method, and other factors (Ogden and Rosenberg, 2006) .",

Frequently, these involve two steps: the calculation of a matrix of pairwise distances among unaligned molecular sequences, followed by generation of a tree using a distance-based method such as neighborjoining (Saitou and Nei, 1987) . The fundamental difference from alignment-based methods obviously lies in the first step; ie., how pairwise distances in the underlying distance matrix are constituted. As MSA is NPhard (Wang and Jiang, 1994) and most good heuristics are computationally expensive, there is intrinsic value in exploring polynomial-time alternatives.",

            "text": "In nonphylogenetic contexts, alignment-free methods are employed in tasks as diverse as sequence classification, database search, and detection of regulatory sequences; the literature on these applications is small but is growing at an increasing rate. Underlying principles and techniques together with applications are re-viewed by Vinga and Almeida (2003) . In stark contrast to the plethora of studies investigating the accuracy of alignment-based tree reconstruction, surprisingly little is known about the accuracy of alignment-free methods, due to an almost complete absence of systematic and comprehensive large-scale studies from this field. In the context of phylogenetics, studies that introduce a new method have usually characterized its accuracy by comparing at most a handful reconstructed trees to \"standard\" trees derived from alignments, focusing on the clustering of subgroups and the placement of taxa instead of emphasizing numerical results (even though studies may otherwise be large-scale: Li et al., 2001; Otu and Sayood, 2003; Stuart et al., 2002a Stuart et al., , 2002b Berry, 2003,2004; Qi et al., 2004; Chu et al., 2004; Hao and Qi, 2004; Yu and Anh, 2004; Yang et al., 2005; Mantaci et al., 2005) . This makes it difficult to extract useful generalizations from this literature, especially considering that data sets vary from paper to paper. A notable exception is the work of Ulitsky et al. (2006) , who compared their average common substring (ACS) approach favorably to three other alignment-free methods on a data set of 75 species, using a tree topology metric due to Robinson and Foulds (1981) ; furthermore, they validated their ACS approach on (a) mitochondrial genomes and proteomes from 34 mammals, (b) 191 proteomes, and (c) a forest from 1865 viral genomes. Recently, we took a first step toward a more systematic and comprehensive comparison of alignment-free approaches in molecular phylogenetic inference (Hohl et al., 2006) , inferring trees by several methods and across a range of phylogenetic distances and calculating their topological distance from corresponding reference trees that were either samples drawn from tree distributions or based on structurally informed, manually curated multiple sequence alignments.",

In a first step, maximal patterns are discovered in unaligned sequences using TEIRESIAS (Rigoutsos and Floratos, 1998) with parameters L = 4, W = 16, and K = 2 (Hohl et al., 2006) ; patterns occurring more than once in any sequence are removed.

We now present a variant (d PBSIM ) that utilizes the BLOSUM62 similarity matrix to speed up distance calculation. We transform a similarity matrix S into a distance matrix D (Taylor and Jones, 1993) : D I; = S n + Su -2S, ; .

However, because the number of possible /c-mers grows exponentially with k, and most fc-mers will not be present in any sequence when k is large, we record presence/absence data only for those fc-mers that appear in at least one sequence. This practice introduces a data aquisition bias; fortunately, MRBAYES implements models that correct for just such an aquisition bias: this correction is achieved by setting the lset coding=noabsencesites option. Felsenstein (1992) developed a model for binary states (the binary model in MRBAYES), originally for restriction site presence/absence data. Lewis (2001) generalized this model to include > 2 states (the standard discrete model in MRBAYES). We use the latter one with two (binary) states. It features an instantaneous rate matrix Q with two stationary state frequencies that model the rate of word gain and word loss. Using this model, it is not possible to estimate unequal stationary state frequencies (they are assumed to be equal), but we can allow the state frequencies to vary over sites, and hence set the symmetric Dirichlet hyperprior (prset symdirihyperpr=exponential(1.0)). The discrete approximation of the Dirichlet distribution uses five categories (default in MRBAYES). We place a uniform prior on topology, and an unconstrained exponential prior on branch lengths with mean 0.1 (default in MRBAYES). We denote this binary encoding of /c-mers by B-bin, and we analyze its convergence and the extent of its burn-in phase at the very end of Results and Discussion.",

A simple way to achieve independence is to take words that occur at position a +bk where a e [1, k] and b takes on values > 0 (subject to sequence-length constraints). This process discards much data and thus seems a reasonable approach only for sufficiently long sequences, (b) fc-mer loss is coupled to fc-mer gain. Generally, as sequence change reduces the count for one word, the count for another word will be increased. The number of distinct fc-mers that are gained or lost as a result of a single sequence change increases with k, and thus the departure of the actual data from our assumption of independent gain and loss is expected to become more apparent for longer words. However, k is relatively small in all of our analyses. Comparison of Figure 1 for B-bin with corresponding figures for other word-based methods suggests that both of these violations have only minor influence in this setting, and statistical analysis will reveal that the best performing parameterizations of B-bin (which exhibit rather short words) and other word-based methods are indistinguishable. To analyze the degree to which the data and the model (mis)match, it is possible to generate data (here, distributions of binary states) under the model and then see how they (dis)agree with actual data. This self-consistency check is known as posterior predictive checking (Gelman et al., 2004) .",

We created a control data set with a sequence length of 1000 amino acids; the main difference from the data by Hohl et al. (2006) is the use of twice as many taxa. In addition to that, we created sequences of 1000 amino acids under a model featuring high among-site rate variation (ASRV; the shape parameter of the continous gamma distribution was a = 0.5), and we created sequences of only 300 amino acids (without the presence of ASRV).",

Methods are ordered according to their rank sums ^R . The Friedman test statistic is F R = 4758.1 (P < 10\" 10 ).

The remaining 22,432 trimmed alignments formed the basis for a Bayesian phylogenetic inference using MRBAYES, resulting in as many consensus trees determined by the extended 50% majority rule and complete with PPs for all bipartions. Parameters in this Bayesian analysis were uniform priors on topology, branch length e (0.0,10.0], and model of sequence change (five models were considered). ASRV was modeled by a four-category discrete approximation to the continuous gamma distribution, uniformly distributed e [0.1, 50.01, and with automatic estimation of the shape parameter a.

For each word-based method, we show the best performing word length k for alphabet AA and for alphabet CE (method d w accepts only k = 1 when using conventional similarity matrices, and we test it only on AA). We find that the value of parameter k for each combination of method and alphabet is stable across all three data sets.

The methods are the ML distance estimate based on correct alignments, rf ML (rank 1); the best performing pattern-based method, d PB (rank 2); the best performing word-based method and the best per-forming alignment-free method not based on words; the best performing composition distance, d c (rank 20); the W-metric, d w (rank 22). Note that the two methods ranking 6th and 20th span an interval that encompasses most methods. Hence, these two methods serve to summarize and visualize the performance of all methods thus \"contained.\" Comparing Figure 2a with b we see the extent to which most alignment-free methods (apart from d w ) show increased phylogenetic accuracy, corresponding to a reduced RF distance in the presence of high among-site rate variation (especially for medium to high phylogenetic distances). Notice also how the curve for d PB closely follows that of d ML (Figure 2b ).",

There are four putative orthologs reference sets, labeled \"few-short\" (F-S), \"few-long\" (F-L), \"manyshort\" (M-S), and \"many-long\" (M-L), where few/many indicates the number of taxa, and short/long indicates the DPB distance. As with the synthetic data sets, we tested alignment-free methods on alphabets AA and CE and varied the parameter k of word-based methods. Neighbor-joining or consensus trees were compared to reference trees using two measures of tree topology as explained below. Table 3 shows the accuracy of alignment-free methods as measured by the normalized false-negative count (FN) for all four putative orthologs reference sets. For ease of presentation, the actual numerical values obtained by FN are multiplied by a factor of 10 and rounded to three decimal places. We included all methods apart from d w ; d w would show up as the worst method, similarly as in the previous section. For word-based methods, we analyzed how their accuracy depends on parameter k and included the best performing word length for each alphabet as judged by their rank over all four reference sets when comparing all parametrizations of all methods. The ranks were calculated from the average accuracy on each set: this avoids bias due to different set sizes. Similarly, Table A2 shows the accuracy as measured by DPB. This measure considers one phylogenetic branch in each set of sequences; we present the total number of unrecovered branches for each reference set and indicate the maximal possible number by showing the size of each reference set. We used the same word lengths as in Table 3 ; optimizing parameter k for DPB yields mostly identical values. The notable exception is d p where the optimal word length for CE is k = 5. This would result in d p with CE obtaining rank 8 as opposed to 16.5 for k = 4. Method d c with A A is ranked slightly higher overall when k = 3 instead of k = 4; however, this difference is inconsequential when considering only the best word lengths as in Table A2 .",

Also apparent from Tables 3 and A2 is that the best performing variant of method B-bin does not improve on previously established, distance-based methods. Overall, we find that the general conclusions drawn from synthetic data about the performance of alignment-free methods relative to each other also hold for empirical data.

Encoding sequences with alphabet CE improves the reconstruction accuracy of long branches over the use of original sequences. At the same time, alphabet CE negatively affects the reconstruction accuracy of short branches. To see this, consider how the impact on reconstruction accuracy is picked up by the two measures. The FN count treats each branch equally, whereas the DPB count is an extreme form of a weighted variant of FN. One branch receives weight 1 (the deep phylogenetic branch of interest; see Methods), whereas all other branches contribute nothing by setting their weight to 0. Thus, for a given reference set, improvements under measure DPB reflect a better ability to correctly reconstruct branches that separate various phyla and divisions. The data show that under measure FN, alphabet AA is better than CE in three out of four cases, whereas the situation is reversed under measure DPB: alphabet CE yields lower rank sums than AA in three out of four cases. Exceptions to the overall behavior are found for reference sets with few taxa. The lower number of taxa, and hence branches, means that any influence of the alphabet on phylogenetic accuracy for certain data, as reflected in a particular measure, will show up more strongly. On reference set F-S, measure DPB shows lower rank sums for AA and higher rank sums for CE sequences relative to the overall levels. This agrees with the hypothesis that for small branch lengths, alphabet AA is the better choice than CE. On reference set F-L, measure FN yields lower rank sums for alphabet CE than for AA relative to the overall levels. Thus, the improvement in reconstruction accuracy provided by encoding sequences with CE is evident even when we consider all branches, as this reference set is dominated by long branches.",

Additionally, sequence similarity influences running time, although to a lesser degree for the range of phylogenetic distances represented by reference sets 1 and 7 of the synthetic data sets and presence/absence of ASRV considered here. For these reference sets, consisting of 100 sequence sets each, and hence 100 computations of distances, we show the average running time of a single computation in seconds. Under otherwise identical conditions, reducing the sequence length from 1000 to 300 amino acids reduces computation time for alphabet CE from 101.3 to 8.76 and from 72.5 to 6.48 (sets 1 and 7) . Similarly for alphabet AA, computation time is reduced from 25.3 to 5.47 and from 7.80 to 1.09. These numbers also show the effect of alphabet choice on running time: using CE instead of AA increases time by as much as a factor of 9.3. Furthermore, running time and phylogenetic distance are inversely correlated. The short-sequences data exhibit the largest sensitivity to phylogenetic distance: for AA-encoded sequences, reducing phylogenetic distance increases time by a factor of 5.0. In the presence of high ASRV, computation time increases somewhat with respect to the control data to 113.9 and 87.4 for CE and to 26.4 and 11.5 for AA. Table 4 shows the duration of the distance calculation step: it is apparent that, as before, using alphabet CE instead of AA increases running time by an order of magnitude. Unlike before, however, the presence of ASRV and a change in phylogenetic distance leads to changes in running time (under both alphabets) that are not easily summarized. The absolute time (in seconds) for method d PB ' ML varies from 864 to 1172 for CE sequences of length 1000 and can be as low as 3.24 for AA sequences of length 300. When we calculate distances using variant d PB ' SIM , we find that we obtain speed-ups of 8.3 to 16.8. This is an order of magnitude faster and brings the absolute time down to between 63.4 and 103.6 for CE sequences of length 1000; it can yield computation times as short as 0.39 s for AA sequences of 300 amino acids. It seems quite likely that a further speed-up can be achieved through a reimplementation of d PB~SIM : variant d PB ' ML spends most of its computation time in the optimized C implementation of PROTDIST, whereas d PB ' SIM , on the other hand, is written entirely in Python and thus leaves room for an additional performance gain.",

In our test setup, it did not improve on classical alignment-free (and distance-based) methods. This result seems surprising, and we offer two possible explanations: (a) It could be the case that the phylogenetic accuracy of Bayesian inference from /c-mers is limited to what we measured simply because there is only limited phylogenetic information in the distribution of /c-mers among a set of sequences. To overcome this limitation, one would need take into account different data sources. The pattern-based approach would then be an example where relying on other data-e.g., changes of amino acids in patterns-leads to increased phylogenetic accuracy, (b) It could be that utilizing the additional information inherent in the /c-mer count yields increased phylogenetic accuracy. Multiple states, be they unordered or ordered, would then be appropriate in the Bayesian inference. Even if it turns out that the phylogenetic accuracy cannot be improved, Bayesian inference from /c-mers may still offer advantages over other approaches building on /c-mers. For example, it is possible to make use of the posterior probabilities obtained for bipartitions, construct a credible set that contains the 95% most likely trees, and obtain an ML estimate of branch lengths in the same step. None of these properties was exploited in the testing framework described in this paper.",

We obtained the total rank sum of the best performing variants of all methods for each alphabet and under each measure. We first tested whether we could pool the rank sums across the four reference sets. The x 2 test for heterogeneity yields x 2 = 8.315 (P = 0.040, df = 3); this result is a borderline case and dependent on the significance level: at a = 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis of homogeneity and conclude that we cannot pool the heterogeneous data. However, at the more stringent a = 0.01 level, we cannot reject homogeneity and are allowed to pool the individual tests. For AA sequences, the pooled rank sums increase; i.e., worsen from 395.0 under measure FN to 452.5 under measure DPB. For CE sequences, they decrease; i.e., improve from 445.0 (FN) to 387.5 (DPB). The pooled results are distributed x 2 = 7.601 (corrected for continuity, P = 0.006, df = 1). Thus we conclude that the difference in pooled rank sums is statistically significant. Generally, as measured by FN, using the original sequences (alphabet AA) is beneficial for most alignment-free methods including B-bin (but not d PB ' ML ; cf. Tables 3 and A2). Considering DPB only, encoding sequences using alphabet CE improves ranks summed over all methods. More precisely, 6 out of 10 methods including B-bin are ranked higher using CE than AA. Note that the difference between pooled AA and CE rank sums is less under measure FN than under DPB. Though not all methods profit from CE under measure DPB, those that do do so more strongly than methods profiting from AA under measure FN. In other words, under measure FN and for each method, use of AA leads to less improvement (as measured by pooled rank sums) over the use of CE than CE improves over AA under DPB. Also note that the average of pooled CE rank sums is lower; i.e. better than the average for AA. Finally, we remark that if we optimized the word lengths for DPB separately, this would yield pooled rank sums that show a bigger difference between AA and CE; i.e., CE performs better at 380.5, and conversely AA performs worse at 459.5.",
