A local paracrine brain RAS has been associated with several brain disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Classically, angiotensin II (Ang II) is the main RAS effector peptide and acts through two major receptors: Ang II type 1 and 2 (AT1 and AT2) receptors. It has been shown that enhanced activation of the Ang II/AT1 axis exacerbates dopaminergic cell death. Several new components of the RAS have more recently been discovered. However, the role of new Ang 1-7/Mas receptor RAS component was not investigated in the brain and particularly in the dopaminergic system. In the present study, we observed Mas receptor labeling in dopaminergic neurons and glial cells in rat mesencephalic primary cultures; substantia nigra of rats, monkeys, and humans; and human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells derived from healthy controls and sporadic PD patients. The present data support a neuroprotective role of the Ang 1-7/Mas receptor axis in the dopaminergic system. We observed that this axis is downregulated with aging, which may contribute to the aging-related vulnerability to neurodegeneration. We have also identified an intracellular Ang 1-7/Mas axis that modulates mitochondrial and nuclear levels of superoxide. The present data suggest that nuclear RAS receptors regulate the adequate balance between the detrimental and the protective arms of the cell RAS. The results further support that the brain RAS should be taken into account for the design of new therapeutic strategies for PD.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "It is now known that in addition to the classical hormonal (tissue-to-tissue) renin-angiotensin system (RAS), there are a paracrine (cell-to-cell) and an intracrine (intracellular/nuclear) RAS. Over the last two decades, all components of the classic RAS have been identified in the brain. Initially, the brain RAS was associated with brain areas involved in the central control of blood pressure. More recently, several studies have shown local RAS in many brain regions and their involvement in several brain disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). We have revealed the presence of a local RAS in the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum of rodents and primates, including humans [1] [2] [3] . Classically, angiotensin II (Ang II) is the main RAS effector peptide and acts through two major receptors: Ang II type 1 and 2 (AT1 and AT2) receptors [4] [5] [6] . Ang II is formed by the action of renin and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) on the precursor glycoprotein angiotensinogen. In several animal models of parkinsonism, we have investigated the possible role of the brain RAS in dopaminergic degeneration, and we have demonstrated that enhanced activation of the Ang II/AT1 axis exacerbates dopaminergic cell death [7, 8] . Other studies Maria A. Costa-Besada and Rita Valenzuela contributed equally to this work. also support the involvement of brain RAS in dopaminergic degeneration [9] [10] [11] .

Ang 1-7 is a hectapeptide which is formed from angiotensin I (Ang I) or Ang II by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The seven-transmembrane G proteincouple receptor Mas is the main receptor for Ang 1-7 [13] . Recently, two different RAS arms have been postulated: a detrimental (i.e., pro-oxidative, pro-inflammatory) arm constituted by the Ang II/AT1 axis and the (Pro)renin/PRR axis and a protective axis constituted by the Ang II/AT2 axis and the Ang 1-7/Mas receptor axis [14, 15] . A few years ago, we described for the first time PRR in nigral dopaminergic neurons and microglial cells in rats, monkeys and humans [1, 2, 16] . However, nothing is known about the protective axis Ang 1-7/Mas receptor in the dopaminergic system. Moreover, we have recently observed the existence of a functional intracrine RAS, in mitochondria and nuclei from rat ventral mesencephalon and dopaminergic cell cultures [17, 18] . However, the possible existence and functional role of an intracellular Ang 1-7/Mas axis remains to be investigated. In the present study, we investigated the presence of major components of the Ang 1-7/Mas receptor axis in the dopaminergic system of different animal and cellular models, including human SN and humaninduced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).

Furthermore, we confirmed the presence of Mas receptors in dopaminergic neurons from monkey and human SN. We also observed the presence of Mas receptors in human iPSCs derived from healthy controls and sporadic PD patients. The results confirm those observed in the human nigra.

Extracellular AII induces activation of the membrane the AT1-Nox2 axis, leading to the generation of intracellular superoxide and oxidative stress (red arrows) [3, 8, 33] . Extracellular AII also induces the internalization of the AII-AT1 receptor complex to the nucleus (green arrows; 18). Internalized and intracellularly produced AII is transformed by ACE2 into A1-7, which acts on MasR. Activation of nuclear AT1 receptors induces an increase in nuclear NOX4/superoxide levels, which are known to regulate gene expression, and triggers a number of mechanisms that protect cells against oxidative stress (green arrows; 18). These protective mechanisms include (i) an increase in the expression of AT2 receptor mRNA, which leads to an increase in the levels of protective AT2 receptors that traffic to different cell structures such as mitochondria and cell membrane, inducing a compensatory increase in the RAS protective arm (i.e., AII/AT2); and (ii) an increase in angiotensinogen, renin, and prorenin/renin receptor mRNA, which leads to an increase in the synthesis of intracellular AII to act on intracellular AT2 receptors and MasR (via ACE2/A1-7).

Mitochondrial AT2 receptors are much more abundant than AT1, increase after treatment of cells with oxidative stress inducers, and induce, via nitric oxide, a decrease in mitochondrial respiration [17] . The present data show the presence of Mas receptors in isolated mitochondria from the rat nigral region. However, the expression of this receptor in mitochondria was lower than that observed in the whole cell homogenate. Interestingly, the Ang 1-7-forming enzyme ACE2 was much more abundant at the mitochondrial level than in the whole cell homogenate, suggesting an additional role for this enzyme in the mitochondria. Both ACE (the Ang II forming enzyme) and ACE2 have several substrates that give them multiplicity of functions. The new RAS member alamandine has been shown to be formed by ACE2 from angiotensin A and to act through a Mas-related gene receptor (MrgD) [49] . Another possibility is that Ang 1-7, which is more abundant than Ang II at the mitochondrial level, acts via other mitochondrial receptors (i.e., in addition to Mas receptors). Interestingly, mitochondrial AT2 receptors, which are the most abundant Ang II receptors in mitochondria, have been shown to bind Ang 1-7 in the cardiovascular system [50] .

In isolated mitochondria, the activation of AT1 mitochondrial receptors produces Nox4derived superoxide [17] . It is known that increased mitochondrial ROS results in mitochondrial DNA damage and oxidation of mitochondrial proteins, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial-derived ROS also reach the cytoplasm and contribute to cellular dysfunction.
