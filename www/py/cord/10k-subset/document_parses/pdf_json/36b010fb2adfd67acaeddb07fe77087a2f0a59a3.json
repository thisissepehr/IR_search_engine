            "text": "Drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) has become an increasingly serious public health problem and has complicated tuberculosis (TB) treatment. Levofloxacin (LOF) is an ideal anti-tuberculosis drug in clinical applications. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of LOF-resistant M. tuberculosis in TB treatment have not been revealed. Our study performed transcriptome and methylome sequencing to investigate the potential biological characteristics of LOF resistance in M. tuberculosis H37Rv. In the transcriptome analysis, 953 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified; 514 and 439 DEGs were significantly downregulated and upregulated in the LOF-resistant group and control group, respectively. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that 97 pathways were enriched in this study. In the methylome analysis, 239 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were identified; 150 and 89 DMGs were hypomethylated and hypermethylated in the LOF-resistant group and control group, respectively. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that 74 pathways were enriched in this study. The overlap study suggested that 25 genes were obtained. It was notable that nine genes expressed downregulated mRNA and upregulated methylated levels, including pgi, fadE4, php, cyp132, pckA, rpmB1, pfkB, acg, and ctpF, especially cyp132, pckA, and pfkB, which were vital in LOF-resistant M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The overlapping genes between transcriptome and methylome could be essential for studying the molecular mechanisms of LOF-resistant M. tuberculosis H37Rv. These results may provide informative evidence for TB treatment with LOF.",

According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, there were 10 million new cases of TB and 1.3 million deaths as a result of TB in 2017. In India, China, and Indonesia, the total number of people with TB accounts for 44% of the cases worldwide. In China, about 889,000 TB cases were reported, accounting for 9% of the cases worldwide (WHO 2018) . Therefore, the prevention of TB remains an urgent task. In recent years, the global TB epidemic has declined. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) refers to TB that is resistant to two or more anti-TB drugs, such as rifampicin and isoniazid (Seung et al. 2015) . The clinical abuse of anti-TB drugs has led to an increasing number of drug-resistant strains. Moreover, the failure rate of MDR-TB treatment is significantly higher than that at which susceptible bacteria are infected with TB (Ormerod 2005) . As such, the development and testing of new drugs are direly needed to enable more timely and effective treatment of MDR-TB.",

LOF plays an important role in inhibiting the activity of the M. tuberculosis gyrase, which severely blocks the replication process of DNA. Therefore, this drug could effectively promote DNA degradation and kill bacteria in a short period time (Collin et al. 2011) . The bactericidal activity of this molecule against intracellular and extracellular M. tuberculosis could be more than twice that of ofloxacin (McGregor et al. 2008) . In recent years, it has been clinically proposed that LOF can directly inhibit the metabolism of Mycolic acid in mycobacteria (Ghimire et al. 2016 ). Thus, it plays a therapeutic role in treating TB. In clinical practice, LOF is an ideal anti-TB drug without any cross-resistance in combination with other clinically applied anti-TB drugs (Richeldi et al. 2002) . However, evidence of the detailed molecular mechanisms of LOF resistance in TB is still insufficient.",

There is evidence that DNA methylation modifications are closely associated with a variety of diseases (Robertson 2005) , including tumorigenesis, infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, chronic diseases, and blood diseases (Ramos et al. 2011; Saleem et al. 2015; Zhuang et al. 2012) . Moreover, previous studies have highlighted occurrence of DNA methylation remodeling in dendritic cells upon infection with M. tuberculosis (Pacis et al. 2019 (Pacis et al. , 2015 . In addition, researchers have focused on the relationship between drug resistance and the M. tuberculosis complex (MTC) (Madsen et al. 2005; Phunpruch et al. 2013) . For example, Phunpruch et al. suggested that the methylation pattern in Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis) could be used to understand the resistance toward lincosamides and erythromycin (Phunpruch et al. 2013) . Therefore, we speculate that DNA methylation may be closely related to LOF resistance in the M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain.",

Therefore, the G0 strain was further cultured in LJ medium at 37 \u00b0C for 4 weeks with 2.0 \u03bcg/mL LOF (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The drug-resistant strain was named the G1 generation. The same steps were repeated until G4 strains obtained, which satisfied the criteria provided by the WHO. Subsequently, three more generations of the drug-resistant G4 strains and the wild-type M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain were cultured under identical conditions (LJ medium at 37 \u00b0C for 4 weeks per generation).

An Illumina sequencing library was constructed using a paired-end sequencing strategy. In brief, library preparation includes three main steps: end repair, \"A\" base addition, and methylated-adapter ligation. The size distribution of the library was examined with 2% agarose gel. A MinElute PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, USA) was used to recover DNA by columns using a 20 \u00b5l elution buffer. Bisulfite conversion was performed using an EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (ZYMO, USA). Bisulfite-treated products were amplified by a 50 \u00b5l PCR reaction system, which contained 10 \u00b5l-treated DNA, 1 \u00b5l 10 mM dNTP, 1 \u00b5l PCR primer A, 1 \u00b5l PCR primer B, 5 \u00b5l 10 \u00d7 master mix buffer, 0.5 \u00b5l JumpStartTM Taq DNA polymerase, and 31.5 \u00b5l water.

LOF has been proven effective in treating TB, which has been the subject of clinical trials to improve dosage amounts (Tiberi et al. 2018) . According to the results obtained by Ghimire et al., there are several advantages of using LOF to treat MDR-TB. First, the concentration of LOF in tissues, such as sputum, bronchial mucosa, and lung tissue, could exceed that in the blood. Second, LOF could easily kill M. tuberculosis in macrophages. Third, continuous delivery of this drug has no accumulation tendency (Ghimire et al. 2016) . Therefore, LOF could be an optimal drug for MDR-TB treatments and thus is in phase II trials (NTC01918397).

This result suggests that LOF resistance affects the change of internal regulation networks in M. tuberculosis H37Rv.

Therefore, we have focused on genes with downregulated mRNA expressions and upregulated methylation levels in both the LOF-resistant and control groups.

            "text": "In M. tuberculosis H37Rv, pgi (Rv0946c) encodes a protein belonging to glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, which catalyzes the interconversion of d-glucopyranose 6-phosphate and \u03b2-d-fructofuranose 6-phosphate. This process is an essential step of the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways. Apart from its enzymatic functions, pgi (Rv0946c) also has a number of other functions, including being an autocrine motility factor (AMF), a neuroleukin (NLK) agent, a serine proteinase inhibitor, and a differentiation and maturation mediator. As in most organisms, pgi (Rv0946c) is essential for the survival of M. tuberculosis in macrophages . Furthermore, a previous study demonstrated that cyp132 (Rv1394c) plays a crucial role in Rv1395's regulator function in cytochrome Analysis of protein-protein interaction networks of nine hypermethylated genes. The protein interaction networks for nine differentially methylated genes between the LOF-resistant group and control group. LOF levofloxacin; red, hypermethylated genes; green, hypomethylated genes; blue, other interacting proteins P450 regulation in M. tuberculosis (Recchi et al. 2003) . Recchi et al. (2003) suggested that Rv1395 could bind to two adjacent sites located between two divergent genes: a cytochrome P450 gene-cyp132 (Rv1394c) and the Rv1395 gene itself. Rv1395 could induce the expression of the cytochrome P450 gene (cyp132) and repress its own transcription. Previous studies of metabolism in M. tuberculosis suggested that pckA (Rv0211) in M. tuberculosis can be related to anaplerotic and gluconeogenic routes. This suggests that pckA (Rv0211) might be related to the regulation of metabolic adaptations of central metabolism in various environments of M. tuberculosis (Beste et al. 2011; Watanabe et al. 2011) . Moreover, as a member of the DOS regulator, the expression of pfkB (Rv2029c) is upregulated in hypoxia conditions and macrophages (Shi et al. 2016) . The results of the mutation screening revealed that pfkB (Rv2029c) is not related to M. tuberculosis growth in vitro or in vivo (Phong et al. 2013; . A previous study revealed that this gene encodes 6-phosphate fructokinase (pfkB), which is involved in the conversion of sugar 1-p into sugar 1,6-P (Phong et al. 2013) . Recently, this protein was identified as a potential vaccine candidate (Zvi et al. 2008 ). Therefore, pfkB (Rv2029c) is potentially essential in vaccine development in M. tuberculosis treatment. Combined with the network of protein-protein interaction, we can also confirm that the hypermethylated genes cyp132 (Rv1394c), pckA (Rv0211), and pfkB (Rv2029c) were essential in M. tuberculosis H37Rv with LOF resistance. The above genes were both enriched in biosynthesis of antibiotics (mtu01130) and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (mtu01110) pathways in the LOF-resistant M. tuberculosis H37Rv group, which could be essential for the future study of M. tuberculosis treatment. In summary, multiple molecular mechanisms could facilitate in understanding the LOF-resistant mechanisms of M. tuberculosis H37Rv when mediated by methylation. Each of the genes identified in this study could be essential for future treatments of MDR-TB.",

A total of 239 genes were differentially methylated (LOF-resistant group/control group), metabolic pathways (mtu01100) was also the most enriched in the KEGG pathway analysis. A total of 25 genes were overlapping between the transcriptome and methylome datasets, which may be the potential core genes of LOF function in M. tuberculosis. There were nine genes with downregulated mRNA expression and hypermethylation levels in the fadE4, php, cyp132, pckA, rpmB1, pfkB, acg, and ctpF; in particular, cyp132, pckA,  and pfkB deserve more in-depth study. The overlapping genes between transcriptome and methylome could be essential for studying the molecular mechanisms of LOFresistant M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The above results could provide informative evidence for TB treatment using LOF.",
