Furthermore, a very recent German study, focusing on surgical intensive care patients, described a longer duration of mechanical ventilation in patients with unfavorable socioeconomic characteristics, such as a high number of people per household [23] . In the USA, when solely analyzing a geographically limited area, namely, Baltimore, and when dichotomizing the neighborhoods by median income level, the authors showed an association between lower household income communities and higher rates of death from sepsis [24] . Likewise, a nationwide cohort analysis study demonstrated that patients with sepsis who lived in the lowest median income quartile had a higher risk of mortality compared to residents of the highest income quartile after adjustment for the severity of illness [25] . This finding could be due to a late stage diagnosis in minority and low income groups, as was also reported in cancer patients in the USA [26] . Globally, when analyzing a large multinational study that covered 50 different countries, the authors found a high national income per capita in intensive care patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with this high national income per capita also being associated with an increased survival [27] . As a result of our study design, the patients without insurance were excluded, and no further investigations regarding insurance status were made. However, excluding patients without health insurance might have created a selection bias and could also be one reason why no differences were found. Indeed, an Australian study found a reduced in-hospital mortality for ICU patients with a compensable status of insurance, although postdischarge ICU patients were not studied [28] . According to those studies, socioeconomic status influences outcomes in the critically ill, which is consistent with our results based on the social questionnaire. Hence, the deprivation index likely only focuses on a relevant portion of socioeconomic status. Another aspect that could reduce the ability to show differences in outcomes among different socioeconomic status groups, as defined by the FDep, is the fact that the greatest portion of our study sample was derived from the Paris Urban Unit. As differences among outcome parameters for both groups remained unchanged, the FDep seems reliable in this context. However, this could be investigated in future studies by using other indexes (e.g., the French European Deprivation Index, FEDI).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 640, "end": 644, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 847, "end": 851, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1006, "end": 1010, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1260, "end": 1264, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1531, "end": 1535, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1798, "end": 1802, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1943, "end": 1947, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2259, "end": 2263, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2738, "end": 2742, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The only statistically significant difference between the socially nondeprived and deprived survivors of critical illness was in the physical component scale at 1 year after ICU discharge. Likewise, with regard to financial resources, the low annual income group had significantly lower scores for the physical component scale and the mental component scale, with gradual increases observed with greater earnings. It remains unclear whether this difference was due to a lack of physical activity, a lack of support from cohabiting partners and family or limited access, or a lack of compliance, when it concerned followup consultations with the family doctor, or whether it is connected to the lower self-reported baseline quality of life in the socially deprived individuals. The 2017 OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) Health at a Glance [29] statistics emphasized the differences in health perception based on income, with 80% of \"good\" self-reported health being present in the fifth quintile (the highest income group) and less than 60% being present in the lowest income group. Additionally, in all OECD countries (including France), except for New Zealand, Canada, and Australia, men were more likely to report being in good health [29] .

First, the observational nature of the data and the lack of a control group hindered confirmation of causality and specific interactions of socioeconomic status on the outcomes. Second, we had no data on several variables that have a major impact on the reported results (i.e., patient compliance and overall behavior [e.g., a readiness to assume risk] and socioeconomic status after hospital discharge), some of which could be compared to the status prior to ICU admission. Additionally, the causes of death after ICU discharge are not known in the FROG-ICU cohort. Third, for all of the presented scores, a baseline status would provide further valuable information for the interpretation of our results. Fourth, instead of comparing our results with the normal French population, it would be interesting to compare the baseline status of hospitalized patients in general and of intensive care patients in particular. Fifth, the unverified answers to the social questionnaire and the rather low percentage of completed overall questionnaires could have biased the results. Sixth, the FDep has not been validated in critical care settings to date. Seventh, our study mostly included hospitals from urban areas and not from \"rural\" or \"quasi-rural\" areas (fewer than 10,000 inhabitants); therefore, an aggregation bias could be assumed. As previously described by other authors, it is not fully clear if the gradient described by the FDep truly represents the differences between rural and urban areas. For example, when the FEDI or the Townsend index was used, opposite gradients were observed with deprivation when related to the degree of urbanicity [17] . Therefore, our study did not have a primary focus on explaining the gradient between the urban and rural areas; rather, this study assessed the association between socioeconomic status (using FDep) and outcomes. However, being aware of the aggregational bias and possible gradient between the rural and urbanized geographical regions, we excluded the Paris cohort, as described for the crosschecking analysis. Eighth, the entire study population belonged to the same country, which makes it difficult to extrapolate the results to ICUs in other countries and with other ethnicities. However, the findings of this \"real-world\" European registry are easier to translate to the general ICU population. Additionally, not all of these limitations are major issues, and the results of our study are unexpected and warrant further exploration in clinical research settings.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1709, "end": 1713, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Limitations of the study"}, {"text": "The present study showed no association between 1-year mortality and social deprivation evaluated by the French Deprivation Index. However, long-term physical recovery appeared to be poorer in the socially deprived ICU survivors. In addition, prolonged psychiatric symptoms are common and affect an already vulnerable and slowly recovering patient group. Hence, interventions that occur after ICU discharge should target physical function. Moreover, regular postdischarge screenings for anxiety, depression, or PTSD-like symptoms, as well as an outpatient program with a low threshold for appointments, should be provided for ICU patients. As critical illness survivors still have more physical and psychological impairments, a lower quality of life, and higher mortality rates than the general population, additional barriers that are created by socioeconomic status should be further investigated, although the best index for determining the differences in health after ICU care remains to be determined.
