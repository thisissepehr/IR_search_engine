In addition, with varying principal scale entities (grain, extent, and focus) the results of studies will differ (see Gurevitch et al., 2002) . In studies of macroecological processes, extent and focus are the most important components (Blackburn & Gaston, 2002) . Species relationships are features that can be compared in samples across different scales. When the objective of a study moves from the analysis of single-species patterns to the analysis of species assemblages across scales, a further difficulty is data inconsistency. In most cases, the available data sets at the different scales will differ in species composition. This is mainly because at broader scales more species are involved than at finer scales, but also because the effort of data sampling at smaller scales often forces the researcher to focus on a restricted number of species. One way to overcome this difficulty is to use the smallest subset of species for which information is consistent across all scales. However, this type of data-set truncation has the disadvantage that changing species relationships with scale are ignored. For example, if at the finest scale only woodland species have been sampled and the data set is restricted to this set, no change of species co-occurrences between forest and grassland species will be detectable. We have employed both the approach of a fixed subset of species and the use of species groups of variable species composition across scales.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 118, "end": 141, "text": "Pearson & Dawson, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 262, "end": 285, "text": "Gurevitch et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 380, "end": 406, "text": "(Blackburn & Gaston, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "It has already been demonstrated that inter-specific associations defined by species groups can be compared across scales (Bruelheide & Chytr\u00fd, 2000; Ku\u017eelov\u00e1 & Chytr\u00fd, 2004) . In general, species of the same species group share similar ecological and spatial requirements at a given scale. Species groups that emerge at different scales (here termed spatially stable species groups) might be particularly useful for scaling data. The spatially stable species groups that display the same pattern at different scales are likely to depend on the same environmental factors at each scale, including climate, topography, land use, soil conditions, and biotic interactions. If the co-occurrence of species is incidental at a particular scale (e.g. one species might depend on particular chemical soil conditions while another might depend on a favourable microclimate), this co-occurrence will disappear at a different scale, as environmental factors do not co-vary consistently across scales (Pearson & Dawson, 2003) . Conversely, all species of a spatially stable species group can be expected to depend on the same principal environmental factor at a particular scale. In other words, the relative importance of environmental factors at a particular scale should be similar for all species in a spatially stable species group. In contrast, the different species composition of a species group at a different scale should reflect differences in the relative importance of environmental variables between these scales, resulting in different scaledomains (see Wiens, 1989) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 122, "end": 149, "text": "(Bruelheide & Chytr\u00fd, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 150, "end": 174, "text": "Ku\u017eelov\u00e1 & Chytr\u00fd, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 989, "end": 1013, "text": "(Pearson & Dawson, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1557, "end": 1569, "text": "Wiens, 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "There are many data sets in which information on the occurrence of plant species or vegetation samples are stored digitally. Floristic data sets have the advantage that they rely on systematic sampling with a defined extent and grain.

There is a need for methods that can provide estimates of the completeness of floristic surveys, for example for detecting overlooked species or for reducing sampling effort. Such methods might use information on species relationships from a different source, that is, from vegetation data. At present, around one million vegetation records exist (Ewald, 2001) . These data have the disadvantage that they were collected using different sampling designs and for different purposes (e.g. Mucina et al., 2001) . Their main purpose is to describe vegetation at the regional scale, for example for assessing conservation status, risk assessment, or preparation of vegetation maps. Another goal is to produce a broad-scale classification from vegetation plots (relev\u00e9s) of different regions, i.e. to follow a bottom-up approach.

In our study, this is the case with coniferous forest plantations, which cover nearly half of the study area, and with degraded meadows either transformed from desiccated wetlands or from abandoned fields. However, the inclusion of additional species-poor relev\u00e9s from these habitats would not significantly influence the criterion of species groups as this method is not sensitive to dataset enlargement by relev\u00e9s that contain species that are otherwise absent or rare in the data set (Bruelheide & Chytr\u00fd, 2000) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 310, "end": 335, "text": "(Chytr\u00fd & Rafajov\u00e1, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 825, "end": 852, "text": "(Bruelheide & Chytr\u00fd, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Biases in the data sets"}, {"text": "A further consequence of a preferential sampling bias is the existence of over-sampled, clumped areas embedded in an under-sampled matrix.

Nevertheless, these cores are distributed relatively regularly throughout the region and they also cover all main vegetation types (see Materials and methods). The bias mentioned might have influenced the species composition of the two most frequent groups (the VaccMyrt and PlanLanc groups), as these were formed by ubiquitous species occurring either in forests or on open-land.

However, this is a problem mainly in the PlanLanc group (over 90% of its species are not present in the MD) and in the VaccMyrt group (all species are absent in the MD). For this reason it is not possible to form these groups in the MD. On the other hand, there are nine other groups in which all species (e.g. the ArunDioi group) or almost all species (e.g. the CallVulg group) are present in all three data sets. In addition, a different size of a species group does not necessarily result in a different selection of plots in which the species groups are present, as our assignment criteria involve a minimum number of species that depends on the total species number of the species group (Bruelheide & Jandt, 1995; Bruelheide, 2000) . Without this feature (i.e. with a fixed minimum number of species), the correspondence of plot assignment would have been much lower between data sets (i.e. between scales). Even with similar numbers of species, the species groups vary in species composition. On the one hand, this is a result of the bias in data sets mentioned above; on the other hand, this difference is inevitable even in balanced data sets, as relative frequency of species varies with scale (Kunin, 1998) . It is an advantage of the COCKTAIL method that different species compositions of groups can be handled by the optimization procedure. The different sizes of the relev\u00e9s included in the FD might also influence the classification results (Chytr\u00fd, 2001) , but no analysis was carried out on how relev\u00e9 size influences the formation of species groups by the COCKTAIL method.

The ecologically specialized group contains mostly species occurring in specialized (extra-zonal) habitats in the study area (such as wet meadows, calcareous beech forests on rendzinas, ravine forests; see Table 1 ). Such species are also characterized by more extreme indicator values according to Ellenberg et al. (2001) . Specialized species occur in the same habitats at the fine scale, and as these habitats are rare also at the broader scale, the species tend to co-occur at all scales. This explains why the species groups of extra-zonal habitats are spatially stable compared with those of common habitats, such as fringe vegetation, ruderal habitats, and mesophilous meadows.

They also found better transferability of species groups that had a central position along the major environmental gradients existing at the regional scale. However, this is not the case in our study. For example, the PlanLanc group has low transferability although it occupies a central ecological position in our study.
