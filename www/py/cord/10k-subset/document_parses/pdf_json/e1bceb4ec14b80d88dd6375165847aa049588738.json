It has been reported that miRNAs are involved in host-virus interaction, but evidence that cellular miRNAs promote virus replication has been limited. Here, we found that miR-23a promoted the replication of human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in HeLa cells, as demonstrated by a plaque-formation assay and quantitative real-time PCR. Furthermore, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), an innate antiviral molecule, is targeted by miR-23a to facilitate viral replication. MiR-23a binds to the 39UTR of IRF1 and down-regulates its expression. Suppression of IRF1 expression reduced RSAD2 gene expression, augmenting HSV-1 replication. Ectopic expression of IRF1 abrogated the promotion of HSV-1 replication induced by miR-23a. Notably, IRF1 contributes to innate antiviral immunity by binding to IRF-response elements to regulate the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and apoptosis, revealing a complex interaction between miR-23a and HSV-1. MiR-23a thus contributes to HSV-1 replication through the regulation of the IRF1mediated antiviral signal pathway, which suggests that miR-23a may represent a promising target for antiviral treatments.",

The gene-silencing effect triggered by miRNAs may serve major function at two levels to modulate host-virus interactions [4] [5] [6] .

The global prevalence of HSV-1 is approximately 90%. HSV-1 can establish lifelong persistent infection (latency). In response to a variety of stimuli, the virus can periodically reactivate to resume replication. The interactions of HSV-1 and its host cells, including miRNA regulation, contribute to the establishment of HSV-1 infection [11] . For example, HSV-1 uses viral miRNAs to down-regulate the immediate-early transactivators ICP0 and ICP4 in latently infected cells, most likely stabilizing the latent state [12] . Additionally, herpes simplex virus IE63 (ICP27) protein interacts with spliceosome-associated protein 145 and inhibits splicing to inhibit pre-mRNA processing during HSV-1 infections [13] . However, few studies focus on the regulation of cellular miRNAs [14] .",

Dysregulation of miR-23a has been found in various human cancers, including tumors occurring in the breast, colon, and lung; gastric cancers; hepatocellular carcinoma; and acute myeloid leukemia [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . miR-23a regulates cell functions through modulation of target genes, such as transcription factor HOXB4 and metallothionein 2A [24, 25] . Recently, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), which is involved in innate antiviral immunity, inflammation, and the pro-apoptotic pathway, was identified as a target of miR-23a to regulate cells growth and apoptosis in gastric adenocarcinoma [26] . We hypothesized that miR-23a may modulate viral-host interaction through IRF1. In this study, we found that miR-23a modulated the IRF1-mediated pathway to facilitate HSV-1 replication in HeLa cells, revealing that miRNAs play an important role in virushost interaction during viral infection.",

Conversely, blocking miR-23a produced smaller plaques compared to the control vector (Fig. 1C) . Then, we analyzed the concentration of viral progeny by a standard plaque assay. The results indicated that expression of miR-23a promoted viral replication, whereas down-regulation of miR-23a reduced or completely reversed the provirus effect (Fig. 1D) . To further verify the role of miR-23a in virus replication, we quantified the concentration of infectious viruses in the supernatant. As in viral titers in cell, over-expression miR-23a showed the most viral replication (Fig. 1E) . Thus, miR-23a may promote infection at the cellular level. miR-23a also increased the number of cells infected, as shown by the level of fluorescence, while blocking miR-23a had the opposite effect (Fig. 1F) .

As shown in Fig. 2B , the intensity of EGFP fluorescence in cells transfected with the wide type reporter vector was lower compared to the control group at 48 h post-transfection, suggesting that miR-23a may target IRF1 and specifically suppress its expression by binding to 39 UTR. Conversely, knockdown of miR-23a by anti-miR-23a enhanced EGFP expression (  Fig. 2B) . However, when the miR-23a binding site in the EGFP-IRF1 39 UTR reporter vector was mutated (EGFP-IRF1 39 UTR mutant), neither overexpression nor blocking of miR-23a affect the intensity of EGFP fluorescence (Fig. 2C) .

Fig. 6A showed that IRF1 significantly enhanced RSAD2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, ectopic expression of miR-23a caused the amount of RSAD2 mRNA and protein to decrease by about 40% and 30%, respectively (Fig. 6A ). Next, we first constructed a RSAD2 expression vector (Myc-RSAD2), and verified the efficiency of the vector by Western blot (Fig. 6B) . Plaque-formation assay and viral-titer assay to further explore the role of RSAD2 in HSV-1 replication was positive. (Fig. 6C, D) .

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, occurs in response to various stimuli, including virus infection. Viruses can modulate apoptotic pathways to enhance survival of the infected cell. For HSV-1, apoptosis is triggered by the transcription of immediateearly genes, such as ICP0 during infection [48] . And miRNA-dependent regulation generally involves a complex network.

            "text": "But the mechanism responsible for the IRF1 suppressing HSV-1 replication is unclear. It is well known that IRF1 can stimulate both IFN I and IFN III system [49, 50] . Moreover, IRFI can activate many ISGs in an IFN-independent manner [51] . So both IFN system and IFN-independent pathway may be involved in anti-viral effect of IRF1 against HSV-1. Next, we choose RSAD2 or viperin for its recently reported effect on VSV. And as one of ISGs, it can be induced by both IFN-dependent pathway and directly by IRF1 [35] . Compared the result of fig. 3E and Fig. 6D , we can see that RSAD2 may partially account for the suppressing effect on HSV-1 by IRF1, although the anti-viral role of RSAD2 in IRF1 suppressing HSV-1 needs further investigation. Surprisingly, our finding was inconsistent with a recent study which showed that ectopically expressed RSAD2 could not inhibit the replication of wild type HSV-1 in HEK293T cells [52] . This may be due to different MOI used and different detection time, and more importantly, the replication cycle of HSV-1 in HeLa cells may be not the same as in HEK293T cells. The specific reason was under investigation. For the regulation of RSAD2 expression by IRF1, both IFN system and IFN-independent pathway may be involved, which needs further validation. Thus, IRF1 may suppress HSV replication partially by up-regulation of RSAD2 in both IFN-dependent and IFNindependent manner. We will explore the specific mechanism in the future.",

This model shows the probable pathways by which miR-23a can promote viral replication, which is involved in the down-regulation of RSAD2, an anti-viral gene. However, whether HSV-1 infection could induce miR-23a expression and miR-23a has a similar function during infection with other viruses remain a subject for future study.",
