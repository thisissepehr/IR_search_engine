GiHUS may not present the typical signs of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS); therefore, the diagnosis can often be delayed. Creatinine increase and uncontrolled hypertension or worsening of a pre-existing hypertension may be the only signs for early detection of HUS [4, 5] . Unfortunately, there is not a reliable approach for GiHUS even if an immediate discontinuation of gemcitabine is the common initial step [6] . Several therapies, including high-dose corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, antihypertensive drugs, and rituximab, have been employed in the treatment of GiHUS with different results [4, 7, 8] . Al Ustwani et al. reported the use of eculizumab in GiHUS after failure in clinical improvement with other therapies [4] . The outcome was a resolution of the microangiopathic hemolysis and thrombocytopenia. Despite significant improvement in renal function, the creatinine level remained above its average values. Thus, eculizumab appeared to be a well-tolerated, safe and effective treatment for GiHUS [4] .",

A brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a mass in his posterior fossa causing hydrocephalus; therefore, he underwent an endoscopic third ventriculocisternostomy. Two days later a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan confirmed the presence of a lesion in his posterior fossa associated to spinal nodules (C4, C6, C7). Therefore he underwent a gross total resection with good motor function recovery. The histopathological diagnosis was classic medulloblastoma. An analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed positive cytology for neoplastic cells. He started a chemotherapy program with two courses of high-dose regimen and autologous stem cell rescue after an induction phase, according to the Italian protocol for infants with high-grade central nervous system (CNS) tumors [9] . At the end of treatment a MRI scan showed complete remission and the CSF cytology was negative for neoplastic cells. The child began the follow-up when after only 4 months a MRI scan showed contrast enhancement at cerebellum and spinal cord (C1 to C3, D11), which was consistent with disease progression. Therefore, he underwent a second-line therapy with weekly vinorelbine 30 mg/m 2 and craniospinal hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy with a total dose of 31.2 Gy on the craniospinal axis (bi-fractionated, 1.3 Gy/fraction), a boost dose of 59.7 Gy (bi-fractionated, 1.5 Gy/fraction) on his posterior fossa, and a boost dose of 9 Gy on cervical C1 to C3 and dorsal D11 levels (1.4 Gy/fraction) [10] . The MRI evaluation after radiotherapy showed a good response and he started maintenance chemotherapy with gemcitabine-oxaliplatin cycles (750 mg/m 2 and 75 mg/m 2 respectively, reducing the doses to 75% of the total) every 21 days for a total of five courses, which lasted 12 weeks.",

A second chest X-ray showed a diffuse interstitiopathy and an initial right costophrenic effusion (Fig. 1) . Empirical antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin and teicoplanin was started. Blood cultures were negative. Captopril and furosemide were administered because of the appearance of high blood pressure and initial acute renal failure. Anemia and thrombocytopenia persisted with a worsening of his pulmonary and renal impairment at each transfusion. Therefore, hypothesizing a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), he was no longer transfused. After an event of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit of our hospital. He was subjected to renal ultra-filtration and high-flow oxygen and therapy with amine in combination with broad spectrum antibiotics and antifungals. Serology results for viruses, bacteria, and fungi were negative. Several tests were carried out on blood samples and bronchoalveolar lavage. Finally, polymerase chain reaction for cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Klebsiella, pneumococcus, Staphylococcus, and pneumocystosis were also negative. The involvement of lung (ARDS) and kidney (renal failure treated with dialysis), the hypertension associated with hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, and the undetectable haptoglobin made us suspect an antibody-mediated microangiopathy. His disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS 13), activity was normal. The dosage of the complement proteins C3 and C4 was within normal limits. Thus, he was treated with defibrotide, four cycles of rituximab with a transient response, Fig. 1 A chest X-ray scan showing bilateral diffuse acute distress respiratory syndrome at Intensive Care Unit admission immunoglobulins, and plasma exchange. Considering his persistent poor clinical condition, with suspicion of a complement-mediated microangiopathy, he started a therapy with eculizumab at a dosage of 600 mg every 3 weeks for a total of seven infusions. He was previously vaccinated for meningococcus and started antibiotic prophylaxis. His neurological status considerably improved within 48 hours after the first infusion, then we observed an improvement in his general clinical condition and of the laboratory disease activity markers; he was rapidly dismissed from the Intensive Care Unit (Figs. 2 and 3) . He continued the follow-up showing a gradual improvement in his clinical condition: he no longer showed any respiratory symptoms and he recovered his kidney function progressively, reducing the frequency of dialysis sessions until he did not need it anymore. On the neurological side, his neurocognitive functioning gradually improved; his interaction and speech improved. In fact we observed an increase in platelets and red cells count and sufficiently stable levels.",

Afterwards he developed an acute respiratory syndrome associated with transfusion of platelets and red cells.

He had a good recovery after eculizumab with a dosage of 600 mg (as suggested for aHUS in patients >40 kg of weight) confirming the suspicion of a complement-mediated microangiopathy. Unfortunately, we were not able to study eculizumab levels and the complement activity, which could have helped us to assess whether our patient needed a dosage adjustment. As, according to Jodele et al., achieving therapeutic drug levels or complement blockade seemed to be related to therapeutic success; furthermore, they suggested that children with HSCT-TMA require higher eculizumab dosing or more frequent drug administrations, to reach and maintain therapeutic eculizumab levels, compared with the dosing regimen currently recommended for children with aHUS [3] . Our patient showed a rapid response after the first infusion and a gradual increase of renal function after the following doses and we were able to stop eculizumab infusion, since we achieved the remission of the TMA. We monitored the disease, and started another eculizumab infusion when we suspected a recurrence, which we observed 5 months after remission of TMA and last infusion of eculizumab.",

In children were reported cardiovascular effects (edema related to heart failure), neurologic effects (drowsiness, paresthesia), gastrointestinal and genitourinary symptoms (diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, stomatitis, hepatic toxicity ematuria, proteinuria, renal failure), respiratory symptoms (bronchospasm, dyspnea, flu-like symptoms) and fever. TMA was reported as a rare but dangerous adverse event [11] . The incidence of GiHUS has been reported to be however low: between 0.015 and 2.2% [1, 4, 5] . Literature data only concern adult patients treated with gemcitabine for different types of cancer such as non-small cell lung, ovarian, metastatic breast, gastric, and pancreatic cancers [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] 12] . At present no specific risk factors in developing GiHUS have been identified due to the small number of cases and to the heterogeneity and complexity of the patients with chronic and serious disease. The median time between initiation of gemcitabine chemotherapy and onset of GiHUS was 7.4 months [5] . Our pediatric patient developed GiHUS 5 months after the beginning of gemcitabine treatment. No clear dose-response relationship between gemcitabine treatment and development of GiHUS was described: the median cumulative dose is 20 g/m 2 with a broad range from 2.45 to 48 g/m 2 [5] .",

It is noteworthy that the excess in complement activation is related to severe thrombophilia. Complement activation could aggravate in the setting of complement regulatory defects and further contribute to thrombotic occlusions in the microvasculature and even macrovasculature [19, 20] .
