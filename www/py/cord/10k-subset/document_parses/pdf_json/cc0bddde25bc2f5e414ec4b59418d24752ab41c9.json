Before the era of genome wide association studies (GWAS), hunting for genetic factors produced a handful of genes such as CAPN10, TCF7L2, PPARG and KCNJ11 6, 7 . The association of TCF7L2, PPARG and KCNJ11 with T2DM have been observed in several populations and both PPARG and KCNJ11 proteins are targets of currently used T2DM drugs 7 . The GWAS era including meta-analysis enabled uncovering of numerous genes and their variants associated with T2DM. Yet these variants apparently are able to explain only about 20-30% of heritable component 8 . Re-sequencing is now emerging to enable comprehensive variants discovery with its identified potential not offered by imputation and chip based fine-mapping approaches 8 . These efforts can get further challenged by gene environment interactions whereby phenotypic effects for given genotypes likely vary 9 . Diet and physical activity are most considered among environmental factors. Dietary components could affect directly (through interaction with targets) and indirectly (through interaction with gut microbiome).

Below, we describe the highlights of the results of trends of genes in each T2DM complication (Supplementary Table 6 Cardiovascular. In the case of cardiovascular disease, out of 172 genes there are 31 genes studied in a single year. The gene ACVR1C (activin A receptor type 1C) studied in 2015 with high BWI value 1547.5 is a member of TGF-beta receptors and is reportedly correlated in expression with pathogenic risk of T2DM as well as cardiovascular diseases.

The gene PON1 (paraoxonase 1), an anti-inflammatory high density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated enzyme, has been shown to decrease in diabetic patients 40, 41 , and its low concentration and enzymatic activity could be independent predictor of cardiovascular events in diabetic patients 42 .

DHCR7 was recently investigated for its role in T2DM to influence subclinical atherosclerosis using Mendelian randomization approach and carotid artery intima-media thickness (cIMT) measurements 47 . Strawbridge et al. observed rs3829251 (DHCR7) influenced the progression of atherosclerosis in T2DM patients. Glycation of B2M may contribute to the risk of diabetes associated complications.

Genes IRAK4, HDAC9, ACSL1 and APPL159 are recently reported as atherosclerosis causing genes in T2DM patients. 59 genes were reportedly being investigated in multiple years for their role in atherosclerosis, for example the genes ABCA1, PON1, MTHFR, PLTP, PPAR, TNFRSF11B (OPG), FABP4, and IL18 are being studied for several years since 1997 with varying emphasis. ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1) was noted as atheroprotective protein 49 in that it protects against the formation of atherosclerosis and macrophage ABCA1 protects arteries from promoting atherosclerosis lesions 50 . Polymorphism or genetic aberrations in ABCA1 gene can be associated with severity of atherosclerosis 51 . Sartippour et al. (2000) evaluated the in vitro and ex vivo effect of high glucose concentrations on macrophage PPAR (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) mRNA expression 52 and observed that dysregulation of macrophage PPAR expression in T2DM alters arterial lipid metabolism and inflammatory response and might contribute to the accelerated atherosclerosis in T2DM. Upregulation of FABP4 (fatty acid binding protein 4) further enhances the macrophage lipid accumulation by advanced glycation end products (AGE), which further accelerates formation of foam cells and development of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients 53 . Nakamura et al. studied whether serum level of IL-18 (Interleukin 18) is a common predictor of nephropathy and atherosclerosis in T2DM patients. They observed that serum and urinary level of IL-18 were significantly elevated in T2DM patients compared to controls thereby indicating that serum levels of IL-18 could be a predictor for these complications 54 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Nephropathy.

The GOs unique to cardiovascular complications are: circulatory system process, blood circulation, lipid localization, lipid transport, lipid binding. The cardiovascular complications arise due to misbalanced lipid levels in the blood and are considered to be responsible to affect blood vessels; Coronary heart disease (CHD) occurs when arteries supplying blood to the heart muscle becomes blocked. Therefore, blood circulation and lipid transport significantly affect cardiovascular functions.
