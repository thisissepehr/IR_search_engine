Polioencephalomyelitis triggered by infection with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) in immunosuppressed mice that are co-infected with a retrovirus is a direct consequence of lytic infection of motor neurons in the spinal cord. 1 Similar pathologies may also follow indirect tissue destruction, mediated by immune mechanisms initially directed against the invading virus. For example, the lethal neurological disease induced by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is a consequence of killing of virallyinfected cells by LCMV-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes (reviewed in Ref. 2). Many virally-induced autoimmune diseases may also result from either cross-reactivity between viral and self-epitopes or spreading of an antiviral response to self-antigens. Finally, pathologies may be caused by nonspecific bystander effects of infections, like cytokine secretion. Here, we report how LDV may exacerbate autoantibody-mediated diseases through such a mechanism. Special emphasis is put on the role of gammainterferon (IFN-\u03b3) production on the outcome of concomitant autoantibody-mediated autoimmune diseases such as hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenic purpura.",

Like many other viruses, LDV induces an inflammatory response, with a burst of cytokines from infected cells and/or cells of the innate immune system that include interleukins 6, 4 12, 5 15 and 18 (unpublished results). However, because of its restricted tropism and its peculiar viremia kinetics, this cytokine production is observed both very early and very transiently after viral inoculation. As a probable consequence of this first volley of cytokine secretion, natural killer (NK) cells are strongly activated one to four days after LDV infection. 6 This NK cell activation leads to increased lytic activity against potential target cells. It results also in an enhanced production of gammainterferon (IFN-\u03b3). Treatment of mice with anti-asialoGM1 antibody clearly demonstrated that NK cells were responsible for this IFN-\u03b3 secretion, whereas anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies had no effect on this cytokine response. 6 However, preliminary data obtained in mice deficient for this cell subpopulation suggested that NK/T cells play also probably an important role in LDV-induced IFN-\u03b3 production (unpublished results).",

Indeed, ex vivo phagocytosis of autoantibodycoated erythrocytes was more efficient with macrophages derived from LDV acutely infected mice than from uninfected animals. 10 Moreover, LDV-enhanced, antibodymediated thrombocytopenia was inhibited by treatment with total immunoglobulins that block Fc-receptor-mediated phagocytosis of opsonized cells. 7, 8, 12 Finally, LDV-infected mice were treated with clodronate-containing liposomes that destroy phagocytic macrophages in vivo 13 and thus prevent autoimmune diseases that occur through this mechanism. 14 This treatment prevented LDV-enhanced autoantibody-mediated autoimmune disease, 7,8 as well as LDV-induced increase of ex vivo macrophage phagocytosis of opsonized red cells (Figure 1 ). Together, these results indicate that the pathogenic effect of LDV infection involves enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages.",

Other pathologies may similarly result from the IFN-\u03b3 secretion that follows infection with viruses including LDV.
