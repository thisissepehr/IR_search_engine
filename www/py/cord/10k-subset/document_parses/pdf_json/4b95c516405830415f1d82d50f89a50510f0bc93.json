Two strains which proved to be too virulent in human volunteers regularly caused damage to the ciliated epithelium and viruses grew to high titre. Two strains which proved to be attenuated for volunteers did not cause appreciable damage, although they replicated to low titre in the epithelium. Similar results were obtained with influenza A virus attenuated by passage in the presence of horse sera. The method may be of value for detecting virulent live influenza vaccine candidates without risking severe illness in volunteers.",

This method, which is the most rapid means of producing attenuated influenza strains to date, results in a spectrum of both attenuated and virulent clones as judged by their effects in human volunteers. Unfortunately, virulence cannot be predicted by laboratory tests such as yield in eggs, mouse virulence, and growth at high temperatures and volunteer tests are slow and difficult to quantitate. This method might occasionally result in the production of new phenotypes with characteristics not seen in either parent and a recombinant more virulent than the virulent parent strain could be produced (KILBOVR~S,, 1969) . For these reasons we wished to find a new in vitro marker of influenza virus virulence. This paper describes a method using the ciliated epithelium of human foetal tracheal organ culture. ",

This paper reports further results and a number of important points of technique. There appears also to be some variability in the susceptibility of different tracheas. The data were pooled for this report, but nevertheless each individual experiment ranked the viruses in the same order; however, we think it is important to include the virulent and attenuated parent in each test as controls. Using the technique described, there was a clear correlation between free growth in organ culture, damage to cells and the ability to produce disease in man. We do not know whether this correlation would hold with tracheas from other species, if not, there could be difficulty using the test because of lack of an adequate supply of suitable human tracheal cultures (SHAAFF, BOSWELL and MUFSON, 1971) .",

The basic pathology of the disease is damage of the tracheal cells by the virus and since the laboratory adapted strain, A/PR 8/34, does not cause disease in humans, we did not expect it to damage the eiliated epithelium from man. Nevertheless, the cultures were infected whereas the volunteers often were not. Conversely, recently isolated influenza A strains cause clinical influenza and would be expected to destroy eiliated epitholium.",
