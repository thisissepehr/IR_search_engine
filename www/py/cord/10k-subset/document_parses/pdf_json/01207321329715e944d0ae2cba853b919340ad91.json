In adult cartilage, COMP is preferentially located in the superficial territorial matrix (6) . The function of COMP is not known, but it has been suggested that it binds cells (refs. 12 and 13, and HeinegHrd D, Halasz K: personal communication). Thus, COMP may have both structural and metabolic functions in the tissue and could play a role in the interaction between the chondrocyte and the extracellular matrix. COMP is released during the turnover of cartilage and has been quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in both serum and synovial fluid from patients with various joint diseases (14) . In RA, high serum levels of COMP in the early stages of the disease seem to indicate rapid progression of large joint destruction (15) . High serum levels are also observed during progression of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee (16, 17) .",

            "text": "An attractive way of elucidating the relevance of quantifying serum COMP levels for evaluating cartilage involvement in arthritis is to apply serum measurements in an experimental arthritis system, where the course of arthritis can be closely monitored. There are several arthritis models that are commonly used, both in the mouse and in the rat. In a majority of the models, arthritis is triggered by immunization with cartilage protein (18) (19) (20) (21) ) directing the specificity of the immune response to the joint cartilage and perhaps also shifting the destructive process in a predetermined way. In rats, arthritis can also be induced with a single injection of the synthetic oil pristane (22) . Two weeks after such injections, arthritis appears in the peripheral joints. The joint is infiltrated with inflammatory cells that form a pannus tissue, and the inflammation leads to erosions of the bone and cartilage. As in RA, the joint inflammation is chronic. Four months after induction, massive cellular infiltration is still present, and cartilage and bone are severely eroded. It has previously been shown that elevated serum levels of COMP are seen during the early erosive stage of pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) in the DA rat (22) .",

In healthy young rats, we found high serum concentrations of COMP, which rapidly decreased during growth. This finding is consistent with observations in growing children. It was found that in infants, there were high serum concentrations of aggrecan core protein epitopes and COMP (23) , which decreased gradually, but most markedly, after puberty. For the epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody 5-D-4 in keratan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan side chain of aggrecan, a somewhat similar pattern is seen; however, the initial levels are low, which reflects the delayed expression of this aggrecan epitope (ref. 24 fragments released during growth differs from that of fragments released during arthritis; that is, in growing individuals, the release of newly synthesized molecules that are not incorporated in the matrix may be expected, whereas in RA or PIA, the release of structural molecules is more likely. However, at the current state of the technology, where a polyclonal antiserum is used, only quantitative changes can be detected. Since COMP is not exclusively found in articular cartilage, the influence of extraarticular sources-both cartilage and tendons as well as synovial tissue-on serum levels of COMP should be borne in mind when interpreting changes in concentrations. However, the synovial capsule of RA and OA patients contains COMP concentrations that are at least 100 times lower than the concentration in articular cartilage (Saxne T et al: unpublished observations), and increased serum concentrations are not seen during tendinitis in horses (2.5). Interestingly, we found different levels of COMP in the different strains of rats tested, which indicates that the metabolism of COMP is genetically determined. This observation should be further explored. It might be one reason for the interindividual variation in serum levels in apparently healthy people as well as for the remarkably low intraindividual variation of serum COMP levels found in healthy persons monitored over several years as well as in RA patients with a stable disease course monitored over time (26) .",

This shows that experimentally induced, well-defined arthritis developing initially with a similar clinical appearance may involve different pathologic mechanisms in the joint, and that increased serum levels of COMP are not merely a result of joint inflammation, but mirror a specific pathologic process in the cartilage involved in chronic erosive arthritis. This is consistent with observations in RA, in which high serum levels of COMP have been found in patients who subsequently developed severe damage of the large joints that required arthroplastic surgery (1.5).
