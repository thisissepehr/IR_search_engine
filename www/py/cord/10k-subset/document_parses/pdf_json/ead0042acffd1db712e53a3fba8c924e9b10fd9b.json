In this work we employ the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to investigate the adsorption of RNA onto positively charged spherical viral shells and examine the conditions when GSDA does not apply and SCFT has to be used to obtain a reliable solution. We find that there are two regimes in which GSDA does work. First, when the genomic RNA length is long enough compared to the capsid radius, and second, when the interaction between the genome and capsid is so strong that the genome is basically localized next to the wall. We find that for the case in which RNA is more or less distributed uniformly in the shell, regardless of the length of RNA, GSDA is not a good approximation. We observe that as the polymer-shell interaction becomes stronger, the energy gap between the ground state and first excited state increases and thus GSDA becomes a better approximation. We also present our results corresponding to the genome persistence length obtained through the tangent-tangent correlation length and show that it is zero in case of GSDA but is equal to the inverse of the energy gap when using SCFT.",

The difficulty emerges from the considerable number of variables in the system including the genome charge density, the persistence length, the surface geometry and the charge density of surface charges. The adsorption of genome to the inner wall of capsid, the interplay between long-range electrostatic and short-range excluded volume interactions and the issue of chain connectivity make the understanding of the problem quite challenging. The presence of salt makes the adsorption process even more complicated. The salt ions can screen the electrostatic interaction between the charges and modify the persistence length of the genome leading to a change in the profile of the genome in the capsid.",

In this paper, we investigate the validity of the ground state dominance approximation (GSDA) in different regimes as a function of salt concentration, genome charge density and surface charge density. Note that viral RNA is relatively long compared to the capsid inner radius. For example for many plant viruses, RNA is about 3000 nucleotides while the inner capsid radius is around 10 nm [28] . While it is well-known that GSDA works well for long chains [29] , in many recent virus assembly experiments short pieces of RNA have been systematically employed, to study the impact of genome length on the virus stability and formation [30] . Thus the time is ripe to explore the conditions under which GSDA does not apply and self consistent field theory has to be solved to obtain the correct solution. Comparing the solutions of the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) and GSDA shows that GSDA is less accurate when the interaction of genome with the capsid wall is weak even if the genome is long.",

We assume that positive charges on the capsid are uniformly distributed. The coulombic interaction does usually overwhelm other forces responsible for the adsorption of chain to the wall, so instead of applying the Robin boundary condition (equation (32) ) as in section 3.1, we use the Dirichlet boundary condition (q(R, s) = 0) for monomer density by assuming the V ext is infinity beyond the capsid wall. The physical basis for this assumption is that the RNA monomer has stiffness, and the excluded volume interaction between the capsid wall and the RNA is such that the density of RNA could never sit at the wall.",

To this end, we investigate this transition point where the wall attraction becomes so weak that depletion shows up, corresponding to the disappearance of the genome peaks in graphs of figures 2(a), (b) and also figures 4(a), (b). We calculate the excess genome at the wall by integrating the genome peak area, which is proportional to adsorbed monomers. Then we investigate the impact of the salt concentration and surface charge density on the adsorption-depletion transition. The resulting phase diagram is illustrated in figure 3 . The white shade in the figure corresponds to the maximum adsorption. As the color gets darker, less genome is adsorbed to the wall. In the darkest region there is no adsorption. The line separating the darkest region indicates the onset of the depletion transition. Figure 4 describes the genome profile details for two different cases. For a fixed salt concentration but varying surface charge density (\u03c3 = 0\u22120.4e nm \u22122 ) we observe that the peak next to the wall slowly disappears as the capsid charge density decreases and most of the genome becomes localized at the center, figure 4(a) . Similar behavior is displayed in figure 4 (b) for a fixed surface charge density but various salt concentrations. Figures 4(a) and (b) together tell us that the higher salt concentration, or the lower surface density charge, causes genome to stay away from the capsid wall and to localize toward the center, constructing the region where GSDA is not valid any more.",
