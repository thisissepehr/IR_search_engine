However, their ability to provide ecologically relevant information remains controversial. One of the major problems is understanding whether the measured responses are determined by stress factors or lie within the natural variability range. In a previous work, the natural variability of enzymatic levels in invertebrates sampled in pristine rivers was proven to be relevant across both space and time. In the present study, the experimental design was improved by considering different life stages of the selected taxa and by measuring more environmental parameters. The experimental design considered sampling sites in 2 different rivers, 8 sampling dates covering the whole seasonal cycle, 4 species from 3 different taxonomic groups (Plecoptera, Perla grandis; Ephemeroptera, Baetis alpinus and Epeorus alpicula; Tricoptera, Hydropsyche pellucidula), different life stages for each species, and 4 enzymes (acetylcholinesterase, glutathione S-transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and catalase). Biomarker levels were related to environmental (physicochemical) parameters to verify any kind of dependence. Data were statistically elaborated using hierarchical multilevel Bayesian models. Natural variability was found to be relevant across both space and time. The results of the present study proved that care should be paid when interpreting biomarker results. Further research is needed to better understand the dependence of the natural variability on environmental parameters.

However, finding some precise rules between the parameters characterizing the site and time variability and the biomarker variability was not possible.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION"}, {"text": "Obviously, site and time characteristics are determined by a combination of parameters. Some of these are environmental factors that have been described only in part in the present study. Ecologically relevant factors, such as food availability, competition, and other ecological interactions, should be better investigated. Moreover, intrinsic biological factors of the species considered may also be relevant. For example, genetic variability of different populations may play a relevant role even at sampling sites relatively close, considering the strong isolating factors present in the mountain environment. In this regard, the observed variability has been divided into a part explained by chemical and physical parameters characterizing the basic hydrochemistry of the selected sites and a residual part interpretable as an irreducible amount of natural variability. More detailed studies accounting for additional chemical characteristics (e.g., naturally occurring metals and metalloids) or more complex ecological conditions (type and amount of food available, habitat structure, etc.) could be helpful for better explaining the role of the site and time variables. Some experimental evidence in the literature confirms that the variability of enzymatic parameters across time and/or space is often not only explained by stress factors [12, 13, 24, 25] . Unfortunately, studies addressing the natural variability of biochemical parameters are very scarce, and most of them were related to marine biota [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Cravo et al. [25] , measuring several biomarkers (including AChE and GST) in the marine clam Ruditapes decussates, concluded that natural variability may act as a confounding factor and must be carefully accounted for in ecotoxicological studies. In freshwater ecosystems, Berra et al. [22] studied the environmental variability of a pool of enzymes across a wide range of taxa, taking into account seasonal and spatial variability. The focus of their work was on the different enzymatic response among taxa; however, spatial and temporal variations were also recorded within the same taxon. Schmidt et al. [27] studied the temporal variation of a pool of biomarkers in mussels sampled at 1 pristine site in Ireland. Significant fluctuations in biomarker levels, observed among seasons, have been explained by the authors as naturally linked to the reproductive cycle or to limited food availability.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1347, "end": 1351, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1352, "end": 1355, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1356, "end": 1359, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1360, "end": 1363, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1513, "end": 1517, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1518, "end": 1522, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1523, "end": 1527, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1528, "end": 1532, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1533, "end": 1537, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1538, "end": 1542, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1558, "end": 1562, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1831, "end": 1835, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2152, "end": 2156, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION"}, {"text": "Changes of environmental conditions such as temperature or salinity may have an influence on enzymatic levels [28, 29] , especially when coupled with exposure to a chemical stressor [30, 31] .
