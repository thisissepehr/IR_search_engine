Nasopharyngeal specimens were cultured for both bacteria and viruses; antigens for influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus were sought by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); serum antibodies to viral respiratory pathogens were determined. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci grew from the throat specimens of 39 of the 507 patients (8%) or 38 of 334 patients (11%) who had clinical diagnoses of pharyngitis. Thirty-three cases of influenza A, 20 cases of influenza B, and seven cases of parainfluenza infections were diagnosed. Bacteria were cultured from the nasopharyngeal secretions of 284 patients (56%). In contrast to pharyngeal culture, commensal mixed flora were rarely found in nasopharyngeal culture. Nasopharyngeal culture of bacteria usually considered to be respiratory pathogens was significantly associated with the presence of leukocytes. Streptococcuspneumoniae (odds ratio 6.0, 95% confidence interval 2.6-14.2), Moraxella catarrhalts (odds ratio 12.9, 95% confidence interval 3.1-79.5), and Hemophtlus tnfluenzae (odds ratio 3.0, 95% confidence interval 1.2-7.4) were all associated with the presence of leukocytes.

Results are summarized in Table 4 . History of runny nose (p = 0.002) and rhinitis on physical examination (p = 0.02) occurred significantly more frequently in patients with an increased number of leukocytes in the nasopharyngeal secretions. There was no association with several clinical parameters that might alter the nasopharyngeal flora and therefore increase the number of leukocytes in nasopharyngeal secretions. These include age, history of tobacco abuse, duration of illness prior to seeking medical attention, history of sinusitis, asthma or chronic bronchitis, and clinical diagnosis of sinusitis or otitis media. Multivariate analysis did not change the interpretation of the data (not shown).",

Furthermore, the presence of epithe- lial cells was inversely correlated with the recovery of leukocytes, suggesting that the absence of leukocytes and bacteria was not due to a sampling error.

The immune response of adults may be more swift and effective than that of children, neutralizing the viral antigen and making diagnosis by this method more difficult.
