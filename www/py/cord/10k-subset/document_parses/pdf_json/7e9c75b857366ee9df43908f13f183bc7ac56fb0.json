            "text": "Thy-1 depletion and integrin \u03b23 upregulation-mediated PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway activation inhibits lung fibroblast autophagy in lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary fibrosis Abstract Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced autophagy inhibition in lung fibroblasts is closely associated with the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K-Akt-mTOR) pathway. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that LPS activated the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and inhibited lung fibroblast autophagy by depleting thymocyte differentiation antigen-1 (Thy-1) and upregulating integrin \u03b23 (Itgb3). Challenge of the human lung fibroblast MRC-5 cell line with LPS resulted in significant upregulation of integrin \u03b23, activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and inhibition of autophagy, which could be abolished by integrin \u03b23 silencing by specific shRNA or treatment with the integrin \u03b23 inhibitor cilengitide. Meanwhile, LPS could inhibit Thy-1 expression accompanied with PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway activation and lung fibroblast autophagy inhibition; these effects could be prevented by Thy-1 overexpression. Meanwhile, Thy-1 downregulation with Thy-1 shRNA could mimic the effects of LPS, inducing the activation of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and inhibiting lung fibroblast autophagy. Furthermore, protein immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that LPS reduced the binding of Thy-1 to integrin \u03b23. Thy-1 downregulation, integrin \u03b23 upregulation and autophagy inhibition were also detected in a mouse model of LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis, which could be prohibited by intratracheal injection of Thy-1 overexpressing adeno-associated virus (AAV) or intraperitoneal injection of the integrin \u03b23 inhibitor cilengitide. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that Thy-1 depletion and integrin \u03b23 upregulation are involved in LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and may serve as potential therapeutic targets for pulmonary fibrosis.",

Integrin \u03b23 is the main integrin heterodimer on the surface of lung fibroblasts [17] . Previous studies have shown a protective role for integrin \u03b23 in lung disease, e.g., programmed cell death prevention in lung fibroblasts in response to transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) stimulation with activation of survival signals during TGF-\u03b21 stimulation [18] . However, little is known regarding the role of integrin \u03b23 in sepsisinduced pulmonary fibrosis. Multiple studies suggested that integrins are involved in the regulation of autophagy by activating its downstream PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, thereby controlling lung fibroblast viability and migration [17, 19] . Therefore, we hypothesized that in LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis, LPS may activate the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and inhibit lung fibroblast autophagy by downregulating Thy-1 and upregulating integrin \u03b23.",

            "text": "Autophagy is an important defense mechanism for cells, and plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis [22, 23] . The PI3K-Akt pathway targeting mTOR mediates many physiological functions such as cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis, and also constitutes an important signaling pathway regulating autophagy [24, 25] . Studies have shown that the PI3K-Akt pathway controlling mTOR expression negatively regulates autophagy in cells Values are mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3). *p < 0.05 vs. control group; **p < 0.01 vs. control group; # p < 0.05 vs. LPS group; ## p < 0.05 vs. LPS group stimulated by factors such as starvation and hypoxia [26, 27] . Our previous study demonstrated that LPS activates the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and inhibits autophagy in lung fibroblasts [9] . However, the mechanism by which LPS induces PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway activation remains unclear. Fig. 7 Thy-1 overexpression prevents LPS-induced autophagy inhibition and LPSinduced pulmonary fibrosis. Male C57BL/6J mice aged 6-8 weeks (n = 6/group) were treated intratracheally with AAV6-CMV-Thy-1 (5 \u00d7 10 10 vg/mouse) or vector AAV, as shown in (a). Mice were treated with vector-AAV or Thy-1 + -AAV, and Thy-1 mRNA levels were assessed (b). Western blot was performed to detect the expression levels of Thy-1, LC3, P62 (c) and \u03b1-SMA (d) in the lung tissue. The severity of collagen deposition was measured by assessing hydroxyproline and collagen amounts (e). The severity of pulmonary fibrosis was determined by hematoxylineosin (H&E) staining; collagen deposition was assessed by Masson's trichrome staining, and \u03b1-SMA expression in the lung tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry (magnification, \u00d7200) (f). Values are mean \u00b1 SD (n = 6). *p < 0.05 vs. control group; **p < 0.01 vs. control group; # p < 0.05 vs. LPS group; ## p < 0.05 vs. LPS group Thy-1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface glycoprotein expressed on fibroblast subpopulations and various cell types, including thymocytes, T cells, and nerve cells [28] . As a membrane-bound glycoprotein, Thy-1 is also an important regulator of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, activates intracellular signaling pathways, and affects a variety of cellular functions such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [29, 30] . Thy-1 is inversely associated with phenotypic characteristics in fibrosis and considered a \"fibrosis suppressor gene\" [31] . Several studies have suggested that the absence of Thy-1 in lung fibroblasts correlates with pulmonary fibrosis [32, 33] , Fig. 8 Integrin \u03b23 inhibition prevents LPS-induced autophagy inhibition and LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Male C57BL/6J mice aged 6-8 weeks (n = 6/group) were pretreated with cilengitide (2 mg/kg), followed by LPS (5 mg/kg) administration for consecutive 5 days. Western blot was performed to detect the expression levels of integrin \u03b23, LC3, P62 (a) and \u03b1-SMA (b) in the lung tissue. The severity of collagen deposition was measured by assessing hydroxyproline and collagen amounts (c). The severity of pulmonary fibrosis was determined by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining; collagen deposition was revealed by Masson's trichrome staining, and \u03b1-SMA expression in the lung tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry (magnification, \u00d7200) (d). Values are mean \u00b1 SD (n = 6). *p < 0.05 vs. control group; **p < 0.01 vs. control group; # p < 0.05 vs. LPS group; ## p < 0.05 vs. LPS group and our previous study revealed that Thy-1-related lung fibroblast phenotype transformation is essential for LPSinduced lung fibroblast proliferation. Integrin \u03b23 is an important adhesion molecule [34] involved in cell proliferation, survival and cancer metastasis. It has been suggested that integrin \u03b23 may be a viable anti-fibrotic target in various fibrotic diseases. In bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, integrin \u03b23 expression is particularly enhanced in mesenchymal stromal cells. In normal Thy-1(+) lung fibroblasts, Thy-1 interacts with integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 to inhibit collagen-induced cell activation [31, 32] . Meanwhile, studies have confirmed that loss of Thy-1 expression leads to the activation of integrin \u03b23 and the downstream FAK/ PI3K/ Rac1 signaling pathway [35, 36] . As shown above, LPS induced Thy-1 depletion and integrin \u03b23 upregulation played an important role in LPS-induced PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway activation and lung fibroblast autophagy inhibition and pulmonary fibrosis.",

            "text": "According to previous study, the interaction between Thy-1 and integrin \u03b23 can affect the actvation of integrin \u03b23 [37] . Referring to a previous research [38] , we used Co-IP to analyze the interaction of Thy-1 and integrin \u03b23. Our results revealed a strong interaction between Thy-1 and integrin \u03b23 in lung fibroblasts, which decreased significantly after LPS challenge. Subsequently, we applied flow cytometry to detect PAC-1, a marker of integrin \u03b23 activation, in lung fibroblasts [39, 40] . The results showed that LPS challenge led to enhanced activation of integrin \u03b23 in lung fibroblasts. integrin \u03b23 has been reported to be upstream of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway in various cell types. Because integrin receptors do not possess a catalytic activity, the signaling pathway induced by integrin activation must be transmitted into cells through activation of integrin-associated proteins such as PI3K and FAK. This indicates PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling or similar pathways may be activated when integrin \u03b23 is overexpressed. Studies have shown that integrin \u03b23 upregulation inhibits the autophagic process in cardiomyocytes by activating Akt [41] , suggesting that the expression status of integrin may affect cell autophagy.",
