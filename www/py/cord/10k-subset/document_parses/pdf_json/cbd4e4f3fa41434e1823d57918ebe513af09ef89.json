A systemic or holistic approach to securing the infrastructure systems that underpin an urban center is required. New York City (NYC), for example, is not only an obvious target of terrorism; it is also a major urban center, with all the attendant complexities of people, processes, products, physical structures and institutions.

Nevertheless, the public expects that the accidental hazards can and should be fixed as they are man-made; on the other hand, natural hazards are considered to be acts of God whose negative effects can only, at best, be mitigated.

For example, the Federal Bureau of Investigations' recent $170 million effort to establish a Virtual Case File of interview reports throughout the Bureau has been somewhat of a failure, partially due to the fact that agents are reluctant to share their notes for fear of security breaches.

For a new type of disruption, prediction is necessary to first ascertain the potential nature of the disruption in all its dimensionalities, together with a level of confidence or accuracy regarding the prediction; this would then provide the reason for and the scope of a preparation plan. Thus, prediction details the likelihood, as well as the who, when, what and where, of a disruption. Based on this input, especially the likelihood statistic, appropriate preparation steps can be taken. Moreover, prediction should not only be about the first order impact of a disruption but also about higher-order impacts.

At present, the U. S. employs an alert system based on five colors ranging from green, the least dangerous, to red, or high alert.

The scheme is too aggregated and is applicable to the entire nation at any point in time. Perhaps a more refined and understandable scheme might be in terms of a terrorist threat index (TTI), much like the Dow Jones Index for stocks and the Consumer Price Index for inflation. TTI could range from, say, 0 to 100, with 100 corresponding to the highest level of alert. Additionally, a gradation of index values should be allowed; thus, for the 9/11 example, the NYC Wall Street area would have had TTI values in the 90s, areas in New Jersey would have had values in the 80s, and upstate New York would have had values in the 70s.

For example, many natural disasters and accidental tragedies are a result of a series of events that signal an impending catastrophe.

To minimize potential errors that may occur, multiple systems are being deployed; for example, foreign visitors to the U. S. must now provide prints of both index fingers and a picture of their face at the port of entry. Another approach suggested by Burnes et al. (2003) is an integrated system whereby, say, the wavelet transforms of both the fingerprints and the facial image are judiciously combined in the wavelet domain and then used for both verification and identification purposes.

Of course, data are just that -data.

The Rand Corporation (Davis et al., 2004) undertook a 2002 survey and found that law enforcement agencies which perceived the risk of a terrorist attack to be higher for their jurisdiction were more likely to undertake steps to improve their corresponding response preparedness. It also found that law enforcement considers the most likely threats to be chemical, biological, or conventional-explosives attacks. Indeed, following 9/11, large cities, especially New York City (NYC), are becoming better prepared, if not coordinated.

In such a situation, it is not just about speeding up the models and their solution algorithms; indeed, steady state models become irrelevant in a real-time environment.

Santos and his colleagues have contributed extensively to this area: they (Santos, 1996) have employed linear potential functions to approximate solutions to decision problems cast as Bayesian networks; they (Santos and Young, 1999) have formulated uncertain temporal reasoning without the use of Markov models and yet have been able to elegantly cope with the resultant combinatorial overhead; and they (Santos et al., 2003) have developed a seminal way of incrementally updating Bayesian knowledge bases. These efforts are closely aligned with evolutionary models, also known as genetic algorithms that work in a manner similar to biological evolution or natural selection. The algorithms are based on a seminal paper by Holland (1962) that posited a logical theory for adaptive systems. However, these algorithms did not become a viable tool until computers became powerful enough to start with equations that offer potential solutions, then mutate them repeatedly in an evolutionary manner until a solution emerges that best fit the observed data. Today, evolutionary algorithms have been employed to coordinate airport operations, to develop assembly line schedules, to enhance autonomous operations in unmanned aircrafts, and to determine sniper locations while on patrol in Iraq. The question remains: could such adaptive models help urban centers detect and respond to a major disruption? Certainly, adaptive models are better suited to dealing with changing situations and threats than the more traditional descriptive or prescriptive models.
