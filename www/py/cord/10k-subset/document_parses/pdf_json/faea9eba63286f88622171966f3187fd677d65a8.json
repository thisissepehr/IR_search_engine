            "text": "Introduction: Frequently fractures of modern sport disciplines are fractures of the clavicle. Most of them are uncomplicated and still treated without operation. Therefore there is a lack of bigger studies about the treatment of clavicle fractures by elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN). Nevertheless this method becomes more and more popular, especially for young and active people. Intention of this investigation was to analyze risks and results of this method to check the indication for operative treatment of simple fractures in this group of patients. Material and Methods: This study is a retrospective analysis of 33 patients whose fractures of the clavicle were treated by intramedullary nailing. Crucial for the decision for operation was the individual request of the patient after information of the relative indication. Included were 26 patients with fractures of the middle third, 4 fractures of the lateral third and 3 fractures with concomitant shoulder injuries from 2004 to 2008 . The duration of operation, intraoperative radioactive loading and complications were analyzed from the medical file. The functional outcome was measured by the CONSTANT-Score. The anatomical reduction was proved by measuring the difference of the length of both clavicles (3 -48 month after operation). Results: The average duration for the middle third was 66 min (22-163), for the lateral third 73 (59-100) minutes and for fractures with concomitant injuries 65 min . The mean radioactive surface dose was 1,19 cGy/cm 2 . Four complications (12%) cause revision operations: one secondary dislocation which leads to pseudarthrosis and two imminent penetrations of the medial end of the nail. One patient had developed a painful pseudobursa due to lateral penetration of the nail. Additional there were two prematurely nail extractions because of medial irritation of the soft tissue. Altogether we documented complications in 18% of the operations. Overall an open reduction was necessary in 37%. After healing there has been no significant shortening of the fractured clavicle in comparison of both sides. The CONSTANT-Score showed good postoperative results (average: 96, median: 100, lowest 75/100). Conclusion: ESIN with titan nails is an alternative method of treatment with good results. Nevertheless we documented complications in 18%. In the literature complication rates from 4 -31% has been described. The complication rate of ESIN seems to be comparable to the conservative treatment. In our opinion the relevant intraoperative radioactive dose is an often underestimated factor. The operation time is often longer than thought before starting and often an open reduction is necessary. Because of these reasons the conservative therapy should still be the standard. ESIN can be an alternative especially for young athletic ambitious patients after a detailed information about the risks. Disclosure: No significant relationships. Introduction: The optimal management of clavicle fractures is still controversial, although the nonoperative treatment remains the standard in most fractures. Recent studies have reported a higher nonunion rate and unsatisfactory functional results after nonoperative treatment. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in the primary operative management of displaced midshaft fractures. However, no treatment-consensus exists at this moment. The goal of the present study was to compare plate fixation with nonoperative treatment of displaced midshaft clavicle fractures in adults with a minimum of 24 weeks follow-up. Material and Methods: In a multi-center prospective clinical trial patients with a fully displaced midshaft clavicle fracture were included within one week after the injury. After a standard information procedure, patients were asked if they wanted to have a operative or a nonoperative treatment. Outcome analysis included standard clinical follow-up, the Constant shoulder score, the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score and complication rate at 6 and 24 weeks after the injury. Results: Between January 2008 and October 2009 a total of 93 patients were included: 41 patients were treated operatively (90.2% men, mean age 41.5 years) and 52 patients were treated nonoperatively (82.7% men, mean age 40.9 years). Constant and DASH scores were significantly higher in the operative group compared with the nonoperative group at 6 weeks (92 vs 78 and 13.1 vs 26.5). There was no significant difference at 24 weeks (97 vs 95 and 5.6 vs 6.4). In both groups two patients developed pseudartrosis, all four required surgery. In the nonoperative group symptomatic malunion was more frequent: twelve patients at 24 weeks (23.0%) versus none in the operative group. Other complications in the operative group were mostly hardware related: pain and irritation requiring plate removal after consolidation in four patients (9.8%), two broken plates due to the earlier mentioned pseudartrosis (4.9%), one early outbreak of the plate (2.4%) and one woundinfection (2.4%). Furthermore, patients with heavy professional work activities returned to their jobs at an average of three weeks after injury in the operative group compared with seven weeks in the conservative group. At 24 weeks after the injury, the patients in the operative group were more satisfied compared to those in the nonoperative group (56% vs 46%). Conclusion: Operative fixation of a displaced midshaft clavicle fracture results in improved functional outcome at 6 weeks after injury and in a higher satisfaction rate at 24 weeks. This study shows that patients with heavy jobs restarted their professional activities sooner if they were treated operatively. Furthermore, higher satisfaction with the appearance of the shoulder may be a reason for surgery. Introduction: The unstable shoulder girdle with a fracture of the clavicle (floating shoulder, ipsilateral serial rib fractures) is a classical indication for a plate osteosynthesis of the clavicle. Despite a relatively high complication rate (5-30%), such as implant failure, non-union and refracture after implant removal, open reduction and internal plate fixation (ORIF) has been the gold standard for many years. This open procedure with direct reduction maneuvres might be blamed for at least some of the complications due to iatrogenic damage of the blood supply of the fracture fragments. Our hypothesis is that a closed method with indirect reduction might reduce some of the complications. The goal of our study was to test the practicability of the MIPOtechnique in clavicle fractures in unstable shoulder girdles. Material and Methods: Between 2001 and 2009 we included, out of internally fixed 130 shaft fractures in total (66x plate, 64x elastic nail), 18 patients with either a floating shoulder (n = 8) or a clavicle fracture in combination with ipsilateral serial rib fractures (n = 10), in this study. Operative technique: A locking compression plate (LCP) 3.5 with 10-12 holes was anatomically shaped to the anterior (-caudal) contour of the contralateral clavicle and then inserted percutaneously from lateral to medial using a short incision at the anterior border of the lateral end of the clavicle. Using mainly indirect maneuvres, the fracture was reduced and then fixed in a pure bridging technique never using interfragmentary lag screws. Free unloaded ROM was allowed immediately after the operation with full loading 6-12 weeks later. Follow-up examination was performed 1 to 4 years later with clinical (DASH-score, shoulder function, length measurement) and radiological (fracture healing, length measurement) examination.",

            "text": "Results: 17/18 fractures healed without complications. Clinical and radiological length measurement showed no significant differences to the contralateral side (range: +5 mm to -5 mm). In all patients a very good functional result was achieved with an average DASH score of 4.2 (0-18). One implant failure occured two years after the initial trauma in a road workman. At reoperation only a partial consolidation of the original fracture was observed. Restabilization and bone grafting led to an uneventful healing. Conclusion: The MIPO technique is feasible even in clavicle fractures and can lead to good functional and cosmetic results. The advantage might be its low invasiveness which better preserves the vascular supply of the fracture fragments. However it is technically demanding mainly due to the small size of the fractured bone. Therefore in our opinion it requires a surgeon experienced in the MIPO technique of treating fractures of larger bones as tibia and femur. Introduction: There are some reports on the difficulties of removing the locking compression plate in clavicle fractures, due to problems of removing the self tapping locking screws. We retrospectively investigated if this was also the case in our institution in removal of LCP plate of the clavicle and if this was incidential or becoming a trend.",

This was caused by a total of 17 self tapping locking screws. In all 17 cases jamming of the screwheads in the plate was found to be the reason. There was ''cold welding'' between the threaded head of the locking screw and the locking plate. For removal four different strategies were used. In two screws the head was drilled off and the plate removed and subsequent the rest off the screw removed with forceps. Five times the plate was bend around the screw and by rotating the plate (helicopter) both were taken out. In eight screws the recess of the head of the screws were enlarged and a conical extraction screwbit 3.5 was used to remove the screws. Two times a combination of cutting the plate and helicopter tecnique was used succesfull. In comparison the fifty-one 3.5 mm selftapping cortical screws were removed without any problem.",

However in one-third of the patients removal of locking compression plates and especially the 3.5 mm self tapping locking screws from the clavicle, becomes an increasingly challenging procedure. We find this an unacceptably high percentage. number of mri studies it was possible to describe the intraarticular disc. Until now there was no in vivo verifying of one of these MRI protocols. The introduction of a high resolution MRI protocol using a superficial coil (3D WATS and T2FFE) that has been developped in an ex-vivo model allows the visualisation of the intra-articular structures. The aim of this study is to ascertain the significance of the mentioned MRI protocol and the applicability in the clinical practice in a limited patients cohort with instability of the AC-Joint. The MRI findings are compared to the arthroscopic findings. Material and Methods: In a one year period 16 patients with chronic acromioclavicular-joint dislocation Rockwood Type II and III were seen in the outpatient clinic The major symptom was pain followed by loss of power. Inclusion criteria where a history of more than three month the exclusion of subacromial pathologies, age over 18 and the indication for arthroscopic revision of the ac-joint. The radiological examiner was blinded to the clinical findings. The MRI-scan was performed on both sides. At the time of the operation the surgeon was blinded to the MRI reading. The surgical procedure was performed by arthroscopy in beach chair position. The surgical findings have been documented by video and also in a descriptive manner. The examination was performed on a 1.0 T MRI-system . Results: Throughout the radiological examination, in 9/13 patients a rupture of the intra-articular disc was suspected. In 3/13 cases degenerative alterations were described. In one case the reading was negative (e.g. ,,no rupture of the intra-articular disc''). During the surgical examination 12/13 patients showed ruptures of the intraarticular disc. In one patient no signs of macroscopical disintegration of the disc could be detected. In the case with negative radiologiocal reading, the disc was verified as intact during surgery. In all other cases the disc was disintegrated, including those with the radiological reading ''alterations without clear signs of rupture''. The significance of the described MRI protocol was 75%. ",

However, a large number of patients present with colonic obstruction requiring acute surgery before the diagnosis is known, or before the set date for elective surgery. Previous studies have shown a worse outcome for patients who undergo surgery in the acute setting compared to patients in scheduled care. The aim was to establish characteristics and prognosis in patients with acute obstructing colon cancer compared to patients who underwent elective colon cancer surgery. Material and Methods: All patients diagnosed with colon cancer during 2000-06 in the Linkoping area were identified through the Swedish colorectal cancer register (n = 438). A retrospective analysis of patients with colonic obstruction (n = 88) was done using various criteria from the medical records. Exclusion criteria were acute surgery due to reason other than obstruction (n = 57), non-surgical treatment (n = 44), other diagnosis (n = 13), or missing medical records (n = 11 Conclusion: Acute surgery due to colonic obstruction of colon cancer is common. Tumor stage seems to be more advanced in patients with obstructing disease than in patients scheduled for elective surgery and consequently the rate of complications is higher and the outcome is worse. However, when stratified for different TNM-stages, the worse outcome in 2-year survival for patients with acute obstructing colonic cancer still remains. The explanation for this difference is to be elucidated in further studies. Disclosure: No significant relationships.",

Introduction: Anterior knee pain is one of the most frequent complication of tibial nailing. Its aetiology remains unclear, potentially being a multifactorial event. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate if anterior knee pain has any negative influence on: bone healing(the hypothesis is if the patient has anterior knee pain he or she will not put weight on the affected leg and this will not stimulate the bone healing), ability to return to work and quality of live. Material and Methods: 3 European level 1 trauma center was involved in this study. Methods: between januari 2003 and December 2004, 102 patients with a tibia fracture was admitted to the trauma departments We used a standard T2 tibia nail(Stryker) with the possibility of proximal and distal fixation with 3 screws The approach was trans or parapatellar. Results: At 4-6 weeks, 4 months, 12 months follow-up we had 11, 13, 14 patients with anterior knee painThe VAS decreased from 3,1 to 2,3, bone healing was 100% and for 70% of patients it was possible to do their previous full time job after 12 months. The quality of life (walking up and down stairs normally without any help, putting on shoes and socks, sitting/standing from a chair, total weight bearing,) was improving. Conclusion: We conclude that anterior knee pain in this study is mild, that the two different method of patellar tendon approach(trans or paratendinous approach) have no relevance and it does not have a negative influence on bone healing, ability to return to work and the quality of live.",

The mean distraction rate was 1.6 mm (range 0.8-1.8 mm) for the femur and 1.3 mm (range 1.25-1.3 mm) for the tibia. The necessary pressure to advance the distraction in the tibia was average of 27 Bar (range 20 -42 Bar), to distract the femur, 46 Bar (range 28 -82 Bar). Results: Bone healing index for tibia 1.1 and femur 0.7 months/cm distraction. Implant failure five cases; Infections three cases. Nonunion of the distraction site or docking site four cases. We did not encounter major stiffness of the adjacent joints. Conclusion: Although the presented technique is a semi-closed distraction procedure, we find this system appealing because of it simplicity in use, low cost and the ability to immediate weight bearing. Introduction: Bone transport for treatment of segmental bone defects as a salvage procedure is related to a high complication rate. Posttraumatic soft tissue problems and callus insufficiency are to be dealed with especially in posttraumatic conditions. The Ilizarov Ringfixator allows a stable external bone fixation enabling full weight bearing. In bone defect reconstruction bone transport is commonly used. A major problem is the skin cutting wires for bone fixation. A new method of the cable transport with intramedullary cable passing avoids skin cutting thus reducing skin problems. Material and Methods: 15 Patients with a metaphyseal and diaphyseal bone defect of the tibia after open trauma and posttraumatic infection were treated with debridement, bone resection and soft tissue coverage by local and free flaps. After soft tissue healing the monolateral external fixation was replaced in each patient by a four ring ilizarov fixator with a proximal percutaneous tibia osteotomy. For bone transport a flexible cable was placed around the distal part of the segment and passed intramedullarly through the distal segment out of the tibia and onto the Ilizarov fixator and the transport clickers. The bone segment was transported after a delay of 7 days anterograd by the intramedullar placed cable one mm per day.",

The one patient with early consolidation was treated by a second osteotomy; the two patients with insufficiency were augmented during the docking operation with iliac bone graft. Conclusion: The intramedullar cable transport is a new modification of the bone transport with the ilizarov ringfixator.

Introduction: Tetanus is an acute disease caused by a neurotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium Tetani, characterised by generalised rigidity, muscle spasm and fatality. Open orthopaedic injuries are at particular risk of developing infection from tetanus spores found in the environment. The UK Department of Health has established guidelines for the prevention of tetanus infection. We assessed the adherence of these guidelines on the initial pre-operative management of tetanus prone open orthopaedic injuries in trauma patients admitted for surgery. Material and Methods: A retrospective case note review was conducted on 53 patients admitted to the orthopaedic department for intervention with a tetanus prone wound between February 2009 and June 2009. Tetanus prone injuries included open fractures, soft tissue injury requiring surgical intervention that is delayed for > 6 h, wounds with significant devitalised tissue, wounds in contact with soil and open injuries containing foreign bodies. We assessed to what extent these patients had their immunisation status ascertained, application of wound irrigation and appropriate dressing, correct tetanus prophylactic cover (tetanus toxoid booster versus human tetanus immunoglobulin) and appropriate administration of antibiotics. Results: Of the 53 patients included in the study, 32 (60%) of patients were considered to have a 'high risk' tetanus prone injury and 21 (40%) patients were deemed as having a 'low risk' clean wound based on the nature and extent of injury. Performance within the high risk category showed that 59% of patients had their tetanus immunisation status ascertained, 72% correctly received wound irrigation and betadine dressing, 75% of patients were appropriately given prophylactic antibiotics. Only 9% of patients with a high risk tetanus prone wound received tetanus immunoglobulin and 72% of patients were given a tetanus toxoid booster as a method for prophylaxis. Conclusion: Our study showed that a large proportion of patients correctly received supportive wound care and antibiotics. We also demonstrated that patients with open tetanus prone orthopaedic injuries are not adequately receiving correct tetanus immunoglobulin as the indicated prophylaxis. A large number of patients were given tetanus toxoid instead, which does not protect immunity early enough to cover the acute injury period, thus posing a major risk of developing a devastating and largely preventable infection. The orthopaedic and trauma doctor attending these patients must adhere closely to the correct initiation of simple measures in the management of tetanus prone orthopaedic wounds. All patients were irrigated and debrided, before the application of VAC system. Required debridements were maintained during VAC therapy. Time elapse between the injury time and VAC application time was 5 days on the average (min 0, max 10). When the granulation tissue became sufficient to cover the bone, these wounds have been closed secondarily with several methods. Time elapse between the start of VAC and wound closure or formation of sufficient granulation tissue for grafting was 12 days on the average (min 8, max 17).",

VAC alone does not suffice for wound closure. Expectation in this therapy is to obtain ideal granulation tissue and to prevent infection development via appropriate wound care. The greatest disadvantage of VAC therapy at the time being is its high economic cost. Introduction: Surgical haemostasis in trauma patients can be difficult and hazardous. Commercial products are promoted to accomplish this task at a reasonable cost. In this study we compared the effectiveness of two topical gelatin-based haemostatic agents, Floseal\u00d2 and Surgiflo\u00d2 in a porcine liver trauma model. Material and Methods: We compared the activity of Floseal\u00d2 (with human or bovine thrombin), Surgiflo\u00d2 and Surgiflo\u00d2 with added bovine thrombin in two porcine models. One anesthetised piglet mimicked ''normal'' conditions, while the other was kept in a status of hypotension, hypothermia and haemodilution, necessitating inotropic support (''critically ill''). Laparotomy was performed, after which we inflicted five identical stab wounds on each liver lobe. Each wound was treated with one of the four agents, while one wound was kept as a control. Haemostasis was evaluated clinically. After euthanizing the piglets, the pathologist performed a macroscopic, microscopic and electron microscopic evaluation, blinded for which agent was used in which wound. Results: Clinically, Surgiflo\u00d2 was able to produce a clot in some of its applications in the healthy piglet (''normal'' conditions), which was not the case in the critically ill animal, not even with the added thrombin. Floseal\u00d2 induced clotting in every wound. Both microscopic (hematoxylin and eosin and Mallory stain) and electron microscopic examination of the stab wounds confirmed that Floseal\u00d2 created a stable and dense agglomerate of gelatin and fibrin, firmly attached to the adjacent liver tissue, whereas with Surgiflo\u00d2, the gelatin contained more air bubbles, there was a lot less fibrin included in the clot and the clot was not strongly adherent to liver tissue.",

The indicators of tissue perfusion such as pH and BE seems to be more reliable and sensitive prognostic parameter than hemodynamic instability evaluated by blood pressure and heart rate, in selecting the patients needing surgical control of hemorrhage. A moderate IAH in young patients able to tolerate an increased intra-abdominal pressure, can allow a mechanical compression of the injured parenchyma achieving the arrest of hemorrhage, and extend the indications for NOM in selected hemodynamically unstable patients, without signs of severe tissue hypoperfusion. Material and Methods: Our case describes a 51 year old male who fell 7 m and landed on the right side of his torso dislocating a rib through the diaphragm, causing a transecting grade 5 liver injury to liver lobes IV and VII, the right hepatic artery and a lesion of the retrohepatic vena cava (VC). The patient presented alert, hemodynamically stable with normal breath sounds. CT scan showed right sided hemothorax and a grade 5 liver injury. A right sided chest tube drained 600 ml of blood. The patient became unstable and was transferred to the OR. Profuse haemorrhage from the liver was encountered and massive blood transfusion protocol was initiated. The right hepatic artery showed to be injured and was ligated. Pringles manoeuvre and packing of the liver were not enough to control the bleeding. An injury to the retrohepatic VC was suspected and manual compression was not sufficient to gain control.

The incidence of pulmonary failure increases in patients with an Abbreviated Injury Scale thorax \u2021 3 (AIS) and they are more likely to face poor outcome. Thus, the aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that patients sustaining significant thoracic trauma (AIS thorax \u2021 3) in combination with a relevant liver injury (AIS liver \u2021 3) are more likely to develop pulmonary failure when compared to patients which sustained thoracic trauma without additional liver injury. Material and Methods: Records of multiple trauma patients documented in the Trauma Registry of the German Society for Trauma Surgery were analyzed using uni-and multivariate analyses. Patients were subdivided into four groups according to their liver and thoracic injury: group 1 (AIS thorax < 3; AIS liver < 3); group 2 (AIS thorax \u2021 3; AIS liver < 3), group 3 (AIS thorax < 3; AIS liver \u2021 3) and group 4 (AIS thorax \u2021 3; AIS liver \u2021 3). Potential relevant variables were subjected to univariate analysis between groups using the chi square test to predict the probability for pulmonary failure rate. Subsequently, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed, employing pulmonary failure as the dependent variable. Differences at the level of p < 0.01 were considered statistically significant. Results: 12,585 patients with a mean age of 40.8 \u00b1 10.7 years and a mean ISS of 28.6 \u00b1 11.1 points fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in this study. The overall rate of pulmonary failure was 21 \u00b1 40%. 12% of the patients in group 1, 26% in group 2 and 16% in group 3 developed pulmonary failure. The largest proportion of patients (36%) who developed pulmonary failure was found in group 4. Those factors which proved to show a significant correlation with the incidence of pulmonary failure were included in a subsequent multivariate analysis. However, the presence of relevant lung injury, male gender, pre-existing medical conditions (PMCs), transfusion of more than 10 packed red blood cells (PRBCs) as well as ISS and age played a significant role. In contrast to our hypothesis, liver injury did not proof to be associated with the incidence of pulmonary failure. Conclusion: Pulmonary contusion and significant liver injury seem to have a synergistic effect on the incidence of pulmonary failure. However, multivariate analysis with adjustment of further relevant factors reveal, that liver injury is not a predictive factor for the incidence of pulmonary failure. Rather male gender and reported PMCs together with relevant lung injuries are more likely to develop pulmonary failure following multiple trauma. Nethertheless, patients with combined pulmonary and liver injury are at higher risk for pulmonary failure with critical outcome. Disclosure: No significant relationships.",

            "text": "Material and Methods: In this retrospective study fifty-nine consecutive patients were included with penetrating injuries of the chest during the period of June 2004 until June 2008. The penetrating injury had to be caused by gunshot or stab incident. Statistical analyses of the data was performed using SPSS 16.0. Results: The study group consisted of fifty-nine patients. Ninety percent were male with a mean age of 36 years (range 17-64). The mechanism of injury were stab (79,9%) and gunshot wounds (20,3%). Sixteen patients required a thoracotomy. In four other cases a laparotomy was performed. Twenty-two (37,3%) patients were admitted to the ICU. The number of patients treated in the first year of the study period ( Of the patients with a shotwound 25% died of their injuries and mortality rate of the patients with a stabwound was 10.7%. In the last year of the study period the mortality of gunschot wounds was 9.5%. Conclusion: There is an increase in incidence of penetrating injury of the thorax for both stabwounds and gunshot wounds. The increase of gunshot wounds was especially large in the period July 2007-June 2008. The risk of suffering a gunshot or stabwound to the chest in our traumaregion is gender related. With the increase in the number of gunshot wounds, and thus experience, the mortality seems to decrease. Introduction: Rib fractures and more specific the flail chest are currently treated conservative. In our level one trauma centre we have on average 90 patients with rib fractures and 5 flail chests/yr. Until recently we mainly treated the patients conservative. According to the literature the morbidity and mortality increases twofold with 4 or more ipsilateral rib fractures and an age > 45yrs old. 1, 2 Some studies have also shown that operative fixation of rib fractures may reduce the morbididity significantly 3 With this data and the recent development of specific dedicated osteosynthesis material for rib fractures we devised a pilot study in order to analyse the efficacy of this new Matrix\u00d2 Rib fixation System (Synthes\u00d2) and the effect on the morbidity/mortality of the patient. Material and Methods: During a 6 month period we included all patients with the before mentioned criteria(4 rib fractures, > 45 yr) or with a flail chest. We analysed operation details, lenght of ICU stay, hospital stay and recorded complications. The results were compaired with a matched control group from 2008. Results: 12 patients were included with an average age of 59 yrs and a M:F distribution of 9:3. 5 patients had a flail chest and 7 patients had 4 or more rib fractures. On average all patients were operated within 2 days (0-5). On average 4 (2-6) rib were stabilized with an operating time of 77 min (40-150). No implant failures were seen. 8 patients had an average icu stay of 8 days (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) . Total hospital stay for the whole group was 18 days (6-38), specific for flail chest it was 22 days and for the ipsilateral rib fractures it was 16 days. One patient sustained an extra rib fracture due to the procedure and one patient sustained an iatrogenic pneumothorax. One patient died due to neurologic complications. One patient had a superficial wound infection. No deep infections, pneumonia or chest related mortality occurred. Compared to a matched control group of 2008, the overall length of stay was not significant different. 18 vs 15 days. The length of stay for the ipsilateral fractures was not significantly shorter, 16 vs 15. However the length of stay for the flail chest was significantly shorter in the study group 22 vs 48 (P < 0.05) The control group had significant more pneumonia, 5 vs 1 (P < 0,05). Conclusion: The new Matrix\u00d2 system is easy and safe to work with. The system has good stabilizing capabilities. Operative treatment reduces pneumonia and length of stay with flail chest. These results warrant a randomised study, comparing operative treatment vs conservative treatment. Introduction: Severe thoracic wall injuries can result in long time ICU stay with ventilatory support substantial morbidity and even death. If the patient recovers persistent thoracic wall pain, restricted respiratory capacity and/or non union of the rib fractures can be the consequence. In a systematic review of literature we demonstrated that there is some evidence that early internal fixation can shorten the on-ventilator time, the ICU stay and lower the short time morbidity. Long term pulmonary function is not altered by internam fixation, however the rate of rib nonunion and chest wall pain is decreased. However high quality evidence is lacking. In order to evaluate the feasability of rib osteosynthesis with a new plating system: the Synthes Matrix System a preliminary study is performed and its results presented. This study preceeds a randomised controled trial comparing plate ad screw osteosynthesis and conservative treatment.",

For both the patient and the clinician, the presentation can be frightening, and advanced interventional pulmonary/endobronchial techniques are required to achieve prompt relief of symptoms. General anesthesia is sometimes prohibited in these situations with complete loss of airway. We report our initial experience with these patients in a tertiary referral center. Material and Methods: Three patients (two males) with acute proximal airway emergencies were included. Two patients presented with acute stridor. The third presented with massive bronchial air leak and purulent drainage after an acute traumatic event. All patients were treated emergently with bronchoscopy and placement of an ultraflex bronchial stent under local anesthesia. All patients were followed up after discharge.",

This association, already involved during other national and international disaster situations and relief efforts, sent professionals volunteers (MD and nurses) whit disaster knowledge and specific medical specializations. The international literature demonstrated that a FH is a complex structure and often the time required to be completely functionally is very long, indeed longer than the affected people needs. Results: From April 6 th , June 6 th when the mission ended, the FH provided medical treated to almost 6000 patients, and the ARES personnel (167) where backed by the sanitary personnel of the San Salvatore Hospital. Conclusion: A well planned medical response is very important to provide health assistance during a disaster, yet it is very hard to substitute a damaged hospital in the hearth of the disaster area. A modular sanitary structure, very light at the beginning, with specific and restricted medical supplies, with a little number of specialists in disaster medicine and disaster logistics, could improve the already good results obtained in the L'Aquila Abruzzo mission. Disclosure: No significant relationships. around 100,000 people died, twice as many were injured, and almost 3million people were made homeless. In any situation of disaster, both natural and complex, may be produced a large number of victims that defeat the ability of local health resources to provide adequate health care. On one hand, the system may be overwhelmed with a high number of casualties. On the other hand, hospitals and other health care facilities generally may be compromised heavily: buildings may be destroyed or damaged and the supply of water, electricity, medical gasses, etc. may be limited. The transportation infrastructures may be severely damaged, creating problems for both people and equipment arriving at the hospital. Damage to the health care infrastructure will further compromise the delivery of health services. Material and Methods: Italian Government responded immediately to this emergency after the official request for international relief efforts from the President of Pakistan. Two days after the impact, the first Italian evaluation emergency team was already arrived in Pakistan and the initial field structure was already fully operative, offering medical care, especially advanced trauma care and life support intervention, provided by specialists.

We have a pool of 42 blood units, an echograph, a first generation CT-scan and all materials for traumatologic surgery. For MCI, we use NATO triage classification. Each trauma undergoes ressucitation room, has needing X-Ray exams, FAST echography and intensive care if necessary. Patient who needs urgent surgery runs immediately to operating theatre. ISS score is calculated. The first MCI concerns 6 patients involved in a suicid bomber's explosion near the role II. All were taken in charge 15 min later. The second concerns an attack against a French Coy occured 50 km in the East of Kaboul. There were 22 casualties and 10 soldiers died. They were taken in charge belatedly between 7 to 12 h later.",

We reviewed the type of diseases, mechanism and location of injuries, management, type of surgical procedures performed, blood supply and outcome. Results: 72.9% of the patients were International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) personnel. Most of the patients were men in a percentage of 94%. Four children were included among the local patients. 37.6% of the patients had surgical diseases while the rest 28.9% were of orthopaedic interest patients. 35 (4.6%) patients underwent a surgical operation; 26 (74.3%) of them were operated immediately. Gunshots were the main mechanism of injury for local patients whereas ISAF personnel were usually presented with burns after improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and rocket attacks. Conclusion: The co-operation between medical teams from different countries, when appropriately trained, staffed, and equipped, can be highly effective in order to manage war casualties. Introduction: In the emergency caused by natural and social disasters there are evident deficits between the health needs of affected population and the local health system capacity. The causes of disasters are various and not predictable, usually the health structures can not face up to the population needs. Knowing that disaster medicine has different protocols and materials from ordinary medicine structures and that improvisation during the disaster's acute phases is not a good practice, it has been created an emergency operating health group, the non-profit ARES Association. (Regional Association Sanitary Emergencies) Material and Methods: The ARES, whose members are about 600, all over the nation, is configured as an extraordinary health resource, activated by the National Civil Defence operations centre, in according with the Regional centre of Marche, in disater situations Results: The main objectives of ARES are training and organization of medical staff and structures and its growth crosses several missions including: AE Earthquake in Molise, 2002 Introduction: Cephalomedullary nails rely on a large lag screw that provides fixation into the femoral head. There is an option to statically lock the lag screw (static mode) or to allow the lag screw to move within the nail to compress the intertrochanteric fracture (dynamic mode). The purpose of this study was to compare the biomechanical stiffness of static and dynamic modes for a cephalomedullary nail used to fix an unstable peritrochanteric fracture. Material and Methods: Thirty intact synthetic femur specimens (Model #3406, Pacific Research Laboratories, Vashon, WA) were potted into cement blocks distally for testing on an Instron 8874 (Instron, Canton, MA). A long cephalomedullary nail (Long Gamma 3 Nail, Stryker, Mahwah, NJ) was then inserted into each of the femurs. An unstable four-part fracture was created, anatomically reduced, and the cephalomedullary nail was reinserted. Mechanical tests were conducted for axial, lateral, and torsional stiffness with the lag screws in: 1) static and 2) dynamic modes. A paired student's t-test was used to compare the two modes.",

Similarly, the lateral bending stiffness of the nail was significantly greater (p < 0.01) in the static mode (113.9 \u00b1 8.4 N/mm) than the dynamic mode (109.5 \u00b1 8.8 N/mm). The torsional stiffness of the nail was significantly greater (p = 0.02) in the dynamic mode (114.5 \u00b1 28.2 N/mm) than in the static mode (111.7 \u00b1 27.0 N/mm). A post hoc power analysis with a = 0.05 and \u00df = 0.20 revealed that the paired t-test on 30 samples was sufficiently powered to determine a difference in mean axial stiffness of 33.0 N/mm (6.8% of static stiffness), a difference in mean lateral bending stiffness of 3.6 N/mm (3.2% of static stiffness) and a difference in mean torsional stiffness of 3.4 N/mm (3.0% of static stiffness). Conclusion: Our results show that there is a 60 N/mm reduction in axial stiffness of the cephalomedullary nail when the lag screw is changed from static to dynamic mode. This represents a 12.4% reduction in axial stiffness with a change from axial to dynamic modes which may be clinically significant. The differences in lateral (4.4 N/mm, 3.9%) and torsional (2.8 N/mm, 2.4%) are small enough that they are likely not clinically significant. We felt that a difference of greater than 10% in axial stiffness and a difference of greater than 5% in lateral or torsional stiffness would be clinically significant. Our study was adequately powered to detect these differences. Given the significant reduction in axial stiffness with dynamization of the cephalomedullary nail construct, we recommend use of the static mode when treating unstable peritrochanteric fractures with a cephalomedullary nail.

Conclusion: Our results suggest that placement of the lag screw inferiorly in the femoral head when using a cephalomedullary nail to treat an unstable peritrochanteric fracture results in the stiffnest construct in axial and torsional biomechanical testing. A simple radiographic measurement, CalTAD, provides an intraoperative method of determining optimal cephalomedullary nail lag screw position to achieve greatest construct stiffness. Introduction: A potential of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) augmentation to increase the purchase of cephalic implants in the treatment of intertrochanteric hip fractures has been proven in sev-eral biomechanical studies [1] [2] [3] [4] . The aim of this study is to compare the cut-out ratio of PMMA augmented helical blades to not augmented ones in human cadaveric femoral heads. Material and Methods: Six pairs of osteoporotic cadaveric femoral heads were instrumented with a proximal femoral nail antirotational (PFNA) blade in a standardized manner. Within each pair, one blade was augmented using 3 ml of PMMA cement. Cyclic loading was performed at 2 Hz. Starting at 1000 N, the load was monotonically increasing by 0.1 N/cycle until failure of the construct. X-rays were taken at 250 cycle increments to monitor the movement of the blade with respect to the head. Paired nonparametric test statistics were used to identify differences between groups.",

Introduction: When treating distal tibial deformities or fractures with the Ilizarov external fixator the ankle joint and foot is often transfixed within the ring construction. For some patients full weight bearing can only be achieved in assembling a walking device on the distal ring. The biomechanical effect of the indirect loading on the fixator stiffness, the osteotomy and the wire tension is still unkown. Material and Methods: On the basis of a standarized Ilizarov external fixator (4 rings, 160 mm diameter) with two 1,8 mm wires per ring applied in anatomical position on composite tibiae (3 rd Generation Sawbones) direct and indirect loading was analyzed using a universal testing machine (model 10, UTS Germany). A middiaphyseal osteotomy of 3,5 mm was performed. The following parameters were recorded: micromotion at the osteotomy, relative movement between bone and rings, compressive forces at the osteotomy and strain of the wires. Each experimental setup was tested ten times with 100 kg maximal axial loading. Results: The osteotomy gap closure occurred at 275 N at direct loading and at an average of 730 N at indirect loading. The compressive forces at the osteotomy were almost double as high at direct loading. Regarding the relative motions between rings and bone the amplitude of motion was higher at indirect loading. The stress on the wires was up to four times higher when the walking device was applied on the distal ring for indirect loading. Conclusion: The indirect loading using a walking device has a substantial influence on the mechanical characteristics of the Ilizarov fixator which determine the biomechanical environment of the osteotomy/fracture. The results showed a higher mechanical load while achieving less compressive forces at the osteotomy. In the need of the walking device we suggest to apply additional half-pins at least in the distal fragment. 9) . Three randomized groups of 6 pairs were formed. After the osteosynthesis with the implants was done the fracture (A2.2) was made with a jigsaw. For further destabilsation the troch. minor was removed. The femura were fixed in the testing machine and tested under dynamic condition with a physiologic load for normal walking (2.5x bodyweight) under 25 000 cycles. We measured the load on the Implant, the migration and rotation of the bone around the Implant. The data was dokumented with Lab view, Results: The intramedulare implants showed significant lower migration rates (mean 2.7 mm) of the head compared to the extramedular implants (mean 9.6 mm). The rotation of the head around the lag screw startet earlier within the DHS an showed higher rates (mean 32\u00c2\u00b0) followed by the Gamma 3 (mean 23\u00c2\u00b0) until the end of the 25 000 cycle. The best stabilisation against rotation was documented for the PFN A (mean 13\u00c2\u00b0). The post X-rays showed a significant migration and sintering process of the femoral head with lateralisation and fracture of the lateral wall. This was even higher in probes with a low BMD. Introduction: Excising part of an implant through the femoral head is a rare but severe complication of osteosynthesis of proximal femoral fractures. There is little evidence in the literature about incidence and management of this complication. According to opinion leaders in an recent international user meeting most cases end up in Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA). The value of re-osteosynthesis remains unclear. Most patients that suffer an excision are geriatric and multimorbid patients, rather suitable to less invasive revision surgery. To assess the incidence and management of cutting out of the PFNA blade (Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation by Synthes GmbH International) was the aim of this multicenter study. Material and Methods: The incidence and management of excision of the PFNA blade in trochanteric femoral fractures was assessed retrospectively in 3092 cases in 15 participating hospitals all over Europe in a time period between 2003 and 2009. All implantations were screened for this complication. The preoperative, follow up x-rays and patients' medical records including the surgical reports were collected and analysed with a special focus on revision surgery until union or THA. Results: The incidence of excision of the implant was 1.3% (41/3092). The mean age of patients was 80 years. 76% of mostly female (86%) patients sustained an unstable 31A3 fracture according to the AO classification. Final revision surgery was performed with THA in 19 cases (48%). In 21 cases re-osteosynthesis led to union (52%). Reosteosynthesis was either exchange of blade with or without cement augmentation alone or re-nailing. In 8% of THA revisions additional revision was necessary. In 45% of revisions with exchange of blade additional revision was required (all THA). 83% (5/6)of revision cases with cement augmented blades healed. In 20% of revision with re-nailing, additional surgery was inevitable. On average 2.5 operative procedures were performed after excision of the PFNA blade. Conclusion: Cutting out of the blade of the PFNA is a rare complication. Nevertheless the management after removal is challenging as indicated by the high number of surgical revisions. Revision with Total Hip Arthroplasty showed a lower rate of reoperations compared to re-osteosynthesis. Nevertheless 52% of all revision cases were managed successfully with a minimally invasive osteosynthesis. This gives a rationale for osteosynthesis in managing this complication in geriatric multimorbid patients with a high risk for operation.",

''The new proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) in daily practice: results of a multicentre clinical study.'' Injury 39 (8) In a prospective series of subtrochanteric fractures with or without involvement of the pertrochanteric region and in revision procedures of this area the PF LCP was applied. In 4 out of 14 patients a fixation failure was observed. This paper reports on these fixation failures. Material and Methods: All patients with a multifragmented subtrochanteric fracture with or without involving the trochanteric or the femoral neck region which where judged to present a compromised nail entry point from May 2007 until May 2008 were stabilized using the PF LCP. The plates were applied in a minimally invasive manner through soft tissue windows (MIPO). Intrinsic stability of the fixation was increased by excentric drilling or applying the tensioning device. All patients were followed up to fracture healing. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were noticed. Intraoperative and postoperative x-rays were analysed using the CCD angle and the Gardens alignment index. Results: We report 4 out of 14 patients who sustained a fixation failure with secondary varus collapse requiring 3 revision surgeries until healing. Revision consisted in a reosteosynthesis in one, a plate exchange to a 95 o blade plate in the second and a DHS in the third patient. In all our reported cases of implant failure the posteromedial buttress was missing [two AO 31 A2 and two Seinsheimer type V], and all patients were not able to restrict wheight bearing due to different reasons like, noncompliance (alcohol abuse, limited force, advanced age) leading to increased axial bending forces and finally to breakage of the femoral neck screws with varus collapse of the fracture. Conclusion: In conclusion the PF LCP proximal femoral plate 4.5/5.0 due to its guide wire technique allows for straightforward plate application and reduction also in very complex fractures of the trochanteric region, including fractures with extension into the greater trochanter or reverse oblique intertrochanteric fractures. However in fracture patterns with missing posteromedial support and limited ability to restricted weight bearing (e.g.: advanced age, additional handicap or mal-compliance) an alternative fixation device should be considered, e.g. the hook plate extension of the LCP proximal femoral plate to apply higher intrinsic stability of the fixation when using the tensioning device. Further clinical and biomechanical studies are needed to evaluate the potentiality and limitation of this device for the treatment of these challenging fractures of the trochanteric region. The majority of the the former fixation was replaced by a blade plate. In 25% we performed a total hip prosthesis. In these cases we saw an overproportional tend to prosthesis-luxations. Conclusion: We conclude that mechanical complications like cut out are a little more frequent after DHS-implantation and should be treated by change to a blade-plate-osteosynthesis. This allows a fracture consolidation in that the minor trochanter becomes that stable, that a regular total hip replacement becomes possible. This seems to be the best prevention of mechanical complications after posttraumatic hip replacement like luxations. Disclosure: No significant relationships.",

            "text": "Introduction: Hip fractures often concern elderly patients with a high degree of co-morbidity and therefore susceptible for the associated postoperative morbidity and mortality. According to the literature, several factors have an influence on the amount and severity of postoperative complications after hip fractures. Low preoperative haemoglobin levels (Hb) in elderly patients seem to be associated with increased short-term morbidity and even mortality after surgery. The aim of this study was therefore to establish the impact of anaemia and blood transfusion on postoperative recovery of hip fracture patients. Results: There were 16 women and 44 men with medium age of 24,2 years (18-45 years) and with medium follow-up of 2 years (1-6 years). The lesions occur in 8 sports, 50% of the fractures occur while practicing soccer. The fractures were bimalleolar (n = 30), medial malleolus (n = 11), lateral malleolus (n = 10), with sindesmotic lesion (n = 6) and trimalleolar (n = 3). 6 months after surgery 22% of the patients returned to sports activity ant at 12 months 43%. At 12 months the younger patients (p = 0,0001) and men (p = 0,001) returned earlier to sports activity. At one year 80% of the amateur and 20% of the professional athletes, had returned to sports practice. Fractures of the lateral malleolus returned earlier in 16,2 weeks than medial malleolus fracture in 59,5 weeks. The SMFA and AOFAS scores were high in all types of fracture. Conclusion: Correct treatment of instable ankle fractures in athletes, with anatomic reduction and preservation of the integrity of the articular surface, is crucial to the return to sports practice. The fractures that influence an earlier return were younger age, male sex and less severe fracture, and negative predictors were older age and female sex. Athletes submitted to open reduction and internal fixation with adequate and precocious programme of physical rehabilitation, can return to the same level of sports practice, despite the seriousness of the fracture without pain and functional limitation(4). Results: In all cases anatomic reduction could be achieved. No secondary dislocation was observed and all fractures healed uneventfully.",

In larger fragments the fixation with a lag crew from anterior, the buttressing effect might not be sufficient to avoid secondary displacement. With the use a postero-lateral approach and dorsal plate for fixation of the Volkmann triangle, it is possible to reliably obtain an anatomical reduction of the dorsal articular surface of the tibia, thus potentially minimizing the risk of posttraumatic osteoarthtitis. Introduction: After ankle-and hindfoot fractures, edema often delays surgery and postoperative mobilisation. Therefore effective treatment of edema is of great importance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the continuous lymphological multi-layer compression therapy and of the AV-intermittent impulse compression (AVI) in reducing ankle-and hindfoot edema. Material and Methods: Randomized, controlled, single-blinded, clinical trial. 64 patients (40 \u00b1 15 years, 41 m, 23f) with unilateral fractures of the ankle or hindfoot pre-or postoperatively were randomized into A) the control group (elevation and cold packs), B) the continuous multi-layer compression therapy group (CCT) or C) the AV-impulse compression group (AVI). Primary outcome was the pre-respectively postoperative reduction of edema as measured with the figure-of-eight methode 20 . Results: Pre-and postoperatively the continuous lymphological multi-layer compression therapy (CCT) showed a significant better edema reduction when compared to the control group. After three days of intervention the mean preoperative edema reduction in the control group was -3.8 \u00b1 10.4 mm (11.1%) figure-of-eight methode20 vs. -13.5 \u00b1 6.7 mm (39.5%) in the CCT group (p < 0.01) and vs. -5.7 \u00b1 9.3 mm (17.6%) in the AVI group. Three days postoperatively the mean edema reduction was -3.9 \u00b1 9.8 mm (12.6%) in the control group vs. -11.6 \u00b1 6.5 mm (34.5%) in the CCT group (p < 0.05) and -5.1 mm \u00b1 15.6 (19.4%) in the AVI group. Pre-and postoperatively the CCT group shows moderate effect sizes after two days of intervention and large effect sizes after three days. AVI is more effective when combined with elevation during off-session periods. Conclusion: Continuous lymphological multi-layer compression therapy leads to a clinical relevant and significant better reduction of ankle-and hindfoot edema as compared to the standard treatment with elevation and cold packs. AV-intermittent impulse compression shows a tendency towards a better edema reduction compared to the standard treatment. Continuous lymphological multi-layer compression therapy reasonably can be applied when edema delays operation or postoperative mobilisation. Considering the AVI application we strongly recommend to elevate the leg during off-session periods.",

Additionally we identify the distribution of the expenses between the different services and the different procedures fulfilled to the patient. (2), season (4), moon phases (4), times on duty (2) and weather condition (2) . The observed mortality was adjusted with the RISC based prognosis and the SMR calculated. Results: The selected collective had an average age of 40.4 years and 73% of the patients were males. The mean ISS was 26.1 and the mean hospital mortality was of 17.6%. For the time of day the highest rate of admission was between 6:00 and 7:00 p.m., with the highest numbers on Saturdays. In the times of on-call duty (weekend, public holiday, weekday between 5:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.) twice as much trauma patients were delivered to trauma centers as within the regularly working hours. In summer, the admission rate was highest (29.2%) and lowest in winter (21.3%), with more victims of car accidents in autumn and winter as in the warm season and more victims of motor-and bicycle accidents in spring and summer as in the cold season. But none of the mentioned factors showed an effect on survival (SMR between 0.98 and 1.00). The moon phases had no influence either on frequency of accidents nor on outcome. The effects of temperature was similar to this of the seasons: with warm temperatures/month less car accidents and more bike accidents occurred (and the opposite for cold temperatures). In the subgroup with temperatures under zero degree the mortality was 4% higher (21.5%) than in the subgroups with temperatures above zero (17,0 to 17,6, even though a similar ISS (26,4 vs. 25,9 to 26,2) . In a second step a multivariat analysis was done in order to improve the predictive power, but none of the external factors could improve the prognosis.",

            "text": "Conclusion: There are large variations in the incidence of severe accidents due to time of day, day of week and time of year. But there is no effect of patient's outcome in regard to medical care in German trauma centers. The quality of medical trauma care is consistent around the day, the week and throughout the year. Additionally, we observed an increasing difference between mortality rate and RISC prediction rate from -0,1% to -5,2%, means less deceased polytraumatized patients than predicted. Within the late secondary transferring patients with spinal cord injuries were leading (35%), followed by patients with pelvic injuries (26%), infections (16%) and complex extremity injuries (16%). Conclusion: With this investigation, we tried to characterize the influence of the new mapping of Germany on patient data using the example of the regional trauma network ''Saar-(Lor)-Lux-West-Rhineland-Palatinate''. Although, knowing a lot of interferences, we noticed an abrupt rise of primary admittances of trauma patients in our Level-1 hospital since starting networking. Among the load rejection for smaller hospitals this fact leads to a distinct concentration of the treatment of polytraumatized patients in specialized trauma centers. The improved routine by increased quantity could be responsible for the improvement of process and outcome quality in the treatment of severely injured patients. But, the enormous quantity of emergency patients also reflects a future challenge in dealing with emergency operations besides routine operations as well as seldom ICU-beds in these trauma hospitals. The role of the NLFC is to work in parallel to doctor led clinics, assessing and treating uncomplicated musculoskeletal injuries with a favourable natural history. Since its inception, throughput in this clinic has increased and with greater clinical exposure and training, the spectrum of referred injuries has also broadened. The aim of the present study was to determine patient satisfaction with the NLFC using a validated questionnaire with a specific emphasis on how patients viewed being seen by a nurse rather than a doctor Material and Methods: 173 consecutive patients were prospectively recruited in the NLFC in January 2008. Patients were referred by their resepective Consultants after reviewing the presenting history, examination findings and radiographs. After their consultation with the nurse, each patient was asked to fill in a 37 item questionnaire consisting of 6 different domains related to patient satisfaction based on a validated patient satisafction questionnaire adapted for use in the fracture clinic setting.",

The most common treated injuries were distal radial, metatarsal and metacarpal fractures. 97% of patients felt they received the best care from the staff working in the clinic with greater than eighty percent of patients registering satisfaction with the nurse's assessment of their injury, their bedside manner and the treatment and information given. Only 9% of patients felt that they would rather be seen by a doctor for their injury. The highest rates of dissatisfaction related to the building and seating comfort. Conclusion: Generally, over 85% of patients were satisfied with their clinic visit with the vast majority of patients not having any objection to seeing a nurse rather than a doctor. Patient satisfaction with treatment remains the ultimate outcome measure by which healthcare interventions should be assessed. The results of this study demonstrate the NLFC to be an effective method of managing selected patients in a clinic setting thus reducing the workload of patients which would traditionally be reviewed by the doctor. This has significant implications for improving opportunities for doctors training as well as reducing clinic waiting times. [1] [2] [3] [4] . The aim of this study is to evaluate the anatomical correlation between the lateral end of the clavicle and the attachment area of the supraspinatus tendon. Material and Methods: Using a mathematical model based upon CT-Scan data performed on healthy individuals, the 3 dimensional correlation between the lateral and of the clavicle and the rotator cuff is analyzed. Each individual is examined in supine position, using 3 different positions of the arm (maximum external rotation, maximum internal rotation and maximum abduction and external rotation (''ABER Position''), respectively). For every position the contact area of the lateral end of the clavicle and the spupraspinatus tendon is calculated. Results: Six healthy individuals (12 shoulders) could be included into the study. The average contact area between the lateral end of the clavicle and the supraspinatus tendon (%) is 51.9% for maximum external rotation, 61.7% for maximum internal rotation, respectively. In the ABER position only 4/12 shoulders showed a contact area > 1% (av. 1.6%). Conclusion: According to these morphological findings the contact area between the lateral clavicle and the supraspinatus tendon is less than 62%. This contact zone is located in the dorsal aspect of the clavicle. Therefore the additional resection of an osteophyte, especially at the anterior part of the lateral clavicle should not have a significant influence on the outcome after subacromial decompression. and good to moderate outcome in the CS (mean 69), one patient had a moderate DASH score of 57 with a poor CS of 41. Irrespective of treatment strategy the majority of the patients regained normal range of motion and grip strength in the affected shoulder. The most common complication was impingement of the shoulder, which occurred three times in the conservatively and four times in operatively treated patients. All but one conservatively treated patient with a non-union healed without complications. Conclusion: Minor ( \u00a3 5 mm) and moderate (6-10 mm) displaced greater tuberosity fractures can successfully be treated conservatively with good to excellent long-term rehabilitation of function with a low risk of complications. Whereas there is no doubt that major displaced fractures (> 10 mm) should be treated operatively, special attention must be paid to moderate (6-10 mm) displaced fractures, as the degree of displacement may be misinterpreted on plain standard radiographs.

Patients that were skeletally immature at the time of injury had better motion, but comparable disability. Disability correlated with pain and pain catastrophizing rather than motion. Results: The mesenteric injuries vizualized on initial CT-scan were mesenteric vascular beading or extravasation in 6 cases, and mesenteric infiltration or hematoma in 13 cases. Associated abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract (thickening, abnormal enhancement, perforation) were present in 11/19 cases (58%). Nine patients underwent surgery (26%), 6 patients in the early hours, and 3 others after a delay of more than 24 h. Indication for surgery was hemodynamic instability in 4 cases and suspicion of bowel perforation in 5 cases. In total, intestinal perforations were found in 8 patients. Three patients (15.8%) died of associated injuries. No false positive scan has led to unnecessary surgery. However, the negative predictive value of initial CT was 75% for intestinal associated lesions. Conclusion: The mesenteric injuries in blunt polytrauma patients are uncommon but serious. The whole body scanner is a powerful tool for the diagnosis of these mesenteric lesions. Conservative treatment is feasible but a clinical and paraclinical reassessment is essential for early detection of intestinal lesions initially undiagnosed, or aggravation of initial lesions.

Although conservative treatment is usually successful in most cases, some of these patients suffer complications such as obstruction, gastrointestinal perforation or massive drug intoxication due to a leaking package. Despite an urgent surgery and a careful management in the ICU, morbidity and mortality remain high. Our aim was to assess the outcomes of conservative and surgical management of these patients in our hospital, the referral centre for this entity in Madrid. (1996) (1997) pre-hospital fatalities were more frequent (although not statistically significant), which may reflect improvement of trauma organization in recent years (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) . Domestic (may related to delay due to victim's solitude) and urban environment (inexperienced personnel, delay due to referral to another hospital) incidents lead more frequently in pre-hospital death. Age and ISS as indicators of physiologic reserve and severity of injury were independent predictors of fatality before the victim reaches hospital. Introduction: The triad of the elbow is a complex traumatic injury. These injuries have traditionally been considered a poor prognosis for the consequences that arise as a secondary instability, stiffness and loss of functional ability. The objective of this free paper is to review from a clinical and radiological perspective our experience with 24 cases. Material and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 24 patients with this type of injury. In 8 patients was not carried out a comprehensive treatment of all existing lesions. The coronoid process was not addressed specifically and fractured radial head was removed or and an osteosynthesis was performed. In the remaining 16 were treated by a treatment protocol trying to repair all the damaged structures (coronoid synthesis, radial head arthroplasty/ORIF and ligament repair, at least in the external lateral ligament complex). The median followup was 18 months (12-24).The results were evaluated by the scale of May Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), range of mobility, radiographic parameters and complications during follow up.",

Introduction: It is not always possible to reconstruct complex radial head fractures. As non-anatomical reconstruction and healing disturbances result is loss of motion and severe post-traumatic arthritis of the elbow joint, radial head resection as been proposed for these cases. However secondary overload of the lateral facet of the humero-ulnar joint (with consequent arthritis), instability (especially in the presence of medial collateral ligament injury), painfull anteroposterior instability of the radial stump, and radial shortening (in Essex-Lopresti lesions) with wrist pain can be the result.

            "text": "Conclusion: The high rates of post arthroplasty arthritis can be related to the non-anatomical shape of the existing designs. As the proximal radius articulates both with the capitellum and the proximal ulna, a precise reconstruction of both joints is a necessity to avoid maltracking and/or edge contact in both joints. Given the high variability this only can be realised using a theoretic modular prosthesis that allows for reconstruction of the synchronisation between both joints. We found no significant differences (p > 0.05) in the deficit of the range of motion.

The physical and mental component of the SF-36 score was at the time of follow-up within the normal range at all patients (physical component: screws 51 \u00b1 9.7, prosthesis 46 \u00b1 8.3, plate 52 \u00b1 6.2; mental component: screws 54 \u00b1 7.9, prosthesis 56 \u00b1 6.6, plate 56 \u00b1 4.5). In the subcategory of physical functioning, screws performed better than prosthesis (p < 0.05). No other items of SF-36 were significantly different (p > 0.05). Conclusion: According to our results osteosynthesis with only screws seem to be the best of the three studied methods. Radial head prosthesis replacement yields better functional results than treatment with plates. It must be considered that prosthesis replacement of the radial head has the long-term risk of loosening, especially in young and active patients. Plates showed worse clinical results especially in rotation of the forearm even after removing the plate in 7 patients. Disclosure: No significant relationships.

In an historical series using anatomical preshaped LCP plates, we could lower the rate of healing disturbances, but the volume of the implant did make hardware removal necessary in the majority of patients. The LCP 3,5 mm Hook plate is a low volume angular stable compression plate, designed for the treatment of simple fractures and osteotomies of the olecranon. In this study we want to evaluate the early results of using this new device for the treatment of acute fractures and osteotomies at a level 1 trauma centre. Material and Methods: We prospectively include all patients treated by LCP 3,5 mm hook plate between and. 6 months results considering range of motion (as measued by), MEPS (Mayo Elbow Performance Score), complications and radiographic results are presented. We perform a cost analysis of primary operation using the different implants available, length of stay and time off work. We also perform a cost analysis for reoperation because of delay in union Results: We included 21 patients. Average age is 55,6 years (range 17-83). There were 11 female and 10 male patients. At 6 months average extension deficit was 12\u00c2\u00b0, the average flexion 130\u00c2\u00b0. There was no substantial loss of pro-supination. All factures but one united anatomical (early loss of reduction, but patient refused reoperation). There were 3 complications: 1 early loss of reduction (treated conservatively), 1 CRPS (complex regional pain syndrome) and 1 arthrofibrosis necessitating implant removal). Because of symptomatic hardware two additional hardware removals have been performed. According to the Mayo Elbow Performance Score all but 1 patient scored good to Based upon the cost analysis the predicted average cost per patient is significantly lower in the hook plate group as compared to the tension band and anatomical preshaped plate group.",

Disclosure: No significant relationships. Material and Methods: Dutch surgeons (N = 23) were asked to draw two incisions for an OLAC on embalmed human specimen (N = 46). They also filled out a questionnaire of their experience. All incisions were photographed and digital measurements were taken. Each incision was compared to the gold standard on 4 criteria. Incisions should not be closer than two-thirds of the distance between: 1) Distal tip of the lateral malleolus and the Achilles tendon. There was no correlation between number of mistakes and number of procedures per year or years of experience (Spearman correlation: 0.03 and -0.04 respectively) The median of the mistakes for L-shaped incisions was 1 (IQR = 2) and 2 (IQR = 2) for J-shaped incisions (p = 0.017, Mann-Whitney). The Spearman correlation between the mistakes for the two incisions drawn by each surgeon was 0.55. Conclusion: Conclusions: Inter-surgeon variation of incision lines was high and since the number of mistakes per incision was not correlated to the surgeon's experience, CASAM can be useful in two ways: 1) Pre-operative planning using CASAM, might assist the surgeon in determining a 'tailor made' safe zone in each patient. 2) For educational purposes CASAM is able to compare a student's incision with the gold standard or the computed location of the sural nerve, thus providing personal feedback. Introduction: A precise sustentaculum tali screw placement is crucial for the fixation strength of operatively treated calcaneus fractures, as shown in biomechanical studies. Due to the complex anatomic shape of the calcaneus and the limited visualization of the sustentaculum tali fragment via the common lateral approach, the exact screw positioning is demanding and a bright knowledge of the surgeon is mandatory. With the introduction of navigation procedures an increased precision of implant positioning could be achieved for different applications, as reported for pedicle-and iliosacral screw placement. The aim of this study was the evaluation of different navigation procedures compared to the conventional technique for the placement of the sustentaculum tali screw. Material and Methods: 32 sustentaculum tali screws were placed via a standard lateral approach in artificial calcanei with a prefabricated soft tissue envelope. We used different navigation techniques: Group I: 2D-based fluoroscopic navigation Group II: 3D-based fluoroscopic navigation Group III: Fluoro-Free navigation compared to the standard procedure without navigation (Group IV). For each screw the time of procedure and time of fluoroscopy was measured. The precision was evaluated in postoperative CT scans. Results: No x-ray exposure was necessary for the standard procedure and the Fluoro Free navigation, whereas 17 \u00b1 1.03 and 66.8 \u00b1 0.9 s of fluoroscopy time were needed for the 2D-and 3D-based fluoroscopic navigation. Significant differences were observed for the mean procedure time: 1.26 \u00b1 0.05 (Group IV), 3.49 \u00b1 0.26 (Group III), 13.5 \u00b1 0.49 (Group I) and 19.04 \u00b1 1.41 min (Group II). No significant differences were seen for the precision with one mal-placed screw in each group. Whereas for the image based navigation procedures wide experience in computer assisted surgery was necessary, the Fluoro Free navigation procedure could easly used without that experience, due to a simplified and self-explanatory workflow. Conclusion: All three navigation procedures increase the intraoperative orientation for the placement of the sustentaculum-tali screw, but significant differences of precision compared to the standard technique could not be observed in our experimental set up. Potential reasons are a visual and tactile memory effect, despite a randomized order of drillings and a better visualization of the osseous structures in the used artificial model. In clinical situations a lack of surgical routine for this rare injuries and a limited display of anatomic landmarks exist, making all of the evaluated navigation procedures to a helpful tool. If the fracture reduction is controlled intraoperatively by an 3D fluoroscopic scan, we recommend the 3D navigation, otherwise we use the Fluoro Free navigation.

The distribution of fractured metatarsals was: first metatarsal 5%, second 12%, third 14%, fourth 13%, and fifth 56%. Multiple metatarsal fractures were seen in 15.6%. Most fractures were caused by an inversion injury or fall from height (75%). More than eighty percent of fractures were undisplaced or minimally displaced, and most fracture patterns were transverse or oblique/spiral.

Overall outcome in metatarsal fractures is high, as almost all fractures healed without complaints at 33 months. Outcome is dependent of BMI, diabetes, gender, and dislocation at the fracturesite. Disclosure: No significant relationships. Introduction: Incidence of fracture non-union is increased after severe trauma. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) resulting from major trauma appears to play a role in this healing impairment. Especially the cellular reaction associated with SIRS influences the inflammatory response, which is of vital importance in fracture healing. We hypothesize that systemic inflammation may impair healing through an altered interaction between neutrophils and stem-or osteoprogenitor cells within the fracture hematoma. We therefore investigated the effect of neutrophils on differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Material and Methods: Osteogenic differentiation of MSCs was assessed using an alkaline phosphatase colorimetric assay on the adhered cell lysate after culturing MSCs for 7 days in the presence of different quantities of neutrophils. Chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs was assessed within the same samples using a glycosaminoglycan colorimetric assay in the cell medium. Proliferation was measured within the same samples using a Picogreen(R) dsDNA fluorescent assay. To assess whether any effect was mediated through release of soluble factors or through direct cell-cell contact, supernatants of stimulated neutrophils were used. Stimulation of neutrophils was achieved during 24 h with TNF-alfa. TNF-alfa in the supernatant was subsequently blocked with Humira prior to interaction with MSCs. Results: Low neutrophil concentrations resulted in increased alkaline phosphatase concentrations compared to control levels. High concentrations of neutrophils resulted in increased glycosaminoglycan concentrations and decreased alkaline phosphatase concentrations. Introduction: Angiogenesis is a cue element in the early wound healing and is considered most important for tissue regeneration. In addition to aiding research in understanding the regulatory mechanisms of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, the concept of co-cultures has helped to better understand the mechanisms of interactions between osteoblasts and endothelial cells focusing on new therapeutic approaches for critical size bone defects. Here, we describe in detail the cellular and molecular interaction between human osteoblasts (hOB) and human endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) in a complex 3D-environment. Material and Methods: We investigated endothelial differentiation and morphological organization of human EPC in cocultures with hOB using methylcellulose sphaeroids as well as collagen biomatrices. Cocultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)/ hOB were used as controls. EPC were tracked with cell tracker red, whereas hOB were transduced using a lentiviral eGFP-vector to allow direct cell visualization using confocal laser microscopy and analysis of cell-specific gene expression. We studied the survival of both cell types and formation of vessel-like sprouts as a criterion of endothelial activity of EPC. Expression of several relevant angiogenic and osteogenic markers, as well as different extracellular matrix proteins was investigated using quantitative RT-PCR.",

By contrast, EPCs did neither proliferate nor did they form any apparent vessel-like structures when cultured in a monoculture. Using the lentiviral eGFP-reporter transduction method the expression of osteoblast marker genes was also estimated accurately. We could clearly show that EPCs inhibit the terminal differentiation of hOB by interfering with expression of specific transcription factors RUNX2 and SP7.

Introduction: Failure of fixation is more common in osteoporotic than in other fractures. Early treatment of osteoporosis as well as early stimulation of the fracture healing may improve the later clinical outcome. Bisphosphonates are effective in osteoporosis treatment, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) stimulate fracture healing, although several studies show less effect in estrogen deficient models. In order to determine the effect on early fracture healing of bisphosphonates and BMPs in osteoporotic fractures, these treatment modalities were applied in estrogen deficient rats. Material and Methods: Fourty rats underwent an ovariectomy (OVX), followed by low calcium diet during six weeks. Ten rats underwent a sham operation, followed by normal diet. After six weeks, a closed femoral fracture was induced in all animals. The OVX animals were then assigned to four different groups: OVX alone, injection of bisphophonate, injection of BMP-7 in the fracture gap, or the combination of these. All animals received a normal diet after the fracture. After sacrifice at two weeks, fracture healing was evaluated using radiographs and four-point bending stiffness andstrength.",

Introduction: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with an increased rate of heterotopic ossification within skeletal muscle, possibly due to humoral factors. However, the pathophysiological mechanism of heterotopic ossification after TBI is still not fully understood. This study investigated whether cells from skeletal muscle adopt an osteoblastic phenotype in response to serum from patients with TBI. Material and Methods: Blood was collected from 17 patients with severe TBI as well as ten control subjects. Primary skeletal muscle cell cultures were isolated from orthopedic surgery patients and characterized using immunohistochemical techniques. Proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation were assessed using commercial cell assays, Western blotting (for osterix protein) and the Villanueva bone stain. Results: All serum-treated cell populations expressed osterix after one week. Cells treated with serum from both study groups in mineralization medium had increased ALP activity and mineralized nodules within the mesenchymal cell subpopulation after three weeks. Serum from patients with TBI induced a significant increase in the rate of proliferation of these cells compared to the controls (p < 0.05). Introduction: The current gold standard to establish the diagnosis of osteoporosis and to follow the pharmacological treatment is the measurement of the bone mineral density (BMD). With a growing number of predicted fractures due to osteoporosis the expenses for BMD-measurement will increase. It was therefore the objective of this study to determine parameters that possibly allow a laboratory follow-up of these patients. Material and Methods: Since 2008 we operated 166 patients (\u00d8 74.8 y, 84% female) with an osteoporotic fracture (group1). All of them were more than 65 years old and underwent a laboratory screening including the serum levels of Vit-D 25-OH, Vit-D 1.25-OH, calcium (S-Ca), phosphate (S-PhO), P1NP, b-Cross-Laps, intact PTH, osteocalcin, TSH and sex hormones as far as the urine concentration of Calcium (U-Ca) and phosphate (U-PhO). In Vit D 25-OH insufficient patients without treatment a therapy with Alandronat 70 lg once a week and daily calcium and Vitamin D3 substitution was started. 37 patients (\u00d8 68.3y, 54% female) of the orthopedic department underwent the same screening and served as a control (group2). These patients did not sustain a fracture or relevant surgery within at least 6 months.

We could also show a significant difference of the concentration of osteocalcin. By following these blood parameters during treatment we found an improvement or normalization of these differences as a result of the treatment. Therefore we believe that Vit-D 25-OH, S-CA, U-Ca and osteocalcin could serve as follow-up parameters in the treatment of osteoporosis. Further our preliminary results suggest that under the treatment there is a decrease of the testosterone level in male patients and a decrease of the FH-and increase of the oestradiol-concentration in female patients which has not been reported in the literature yet. In 20 consecutive cycli an alternating traction of 40 Newton was exerted on the subscapularis and infraspinatus, while a continuous force was applied for the supraspinatus. The motion of the tuberosities and the shaft were recorded by 2 high-speed cameras. The following parameters were investigated: Failure of osteosynthesis, intertuberosity motion, motion lesser tuberosity-shaft, motion greater tuberosity-shaft, motion metaphysis-shaft. Results: Group 1: Cable fixation was significantly more stable for intertuberosity motion and tuberosity-shaft motion. Furthermore we found 2 failures for the lesser tuberosity in the suture group. We found no significat difference for the metaphysis-shaft motion. Group 2: The greater tuberosity-shaft motion was significantly lower using two cables. All other parameters showed no significant difference. We found no failures. Group 3: Since the tuberosity-shaft motion and the intertuberosity motion were significant higher using fibre-wire, this series was abandoned after 6/8 pairs. Conclusion: Cable fixation is significantly more stable than suture fixation for tuberosities in shoulder arthroplasty. Double-cable fixation does not improve intertuberosity stability. We found tendencies for an enlarged tuberosity-shaft stability. Introduction: The results following prosthetic treatment of primary humeral head fractures present great variability. Dissolving of tuberosities leading to dysfunction of the rotator cuff with limited motion, pain and instability are often reported. The short term results on inverse prosthesis on the one hand are promising, whereas scapular notching turns out to be a major problem leading to a high failure rate in the long run. High complication rates are also reported. Material and Methods: In an ongoing prospective and consecutive multicentre study until today,199 cases with an inverse shoulder prosthesis system are documented. In this series we analyse the results of the cases treated for primary fracture as indication. In all cases the Affinis \u00d2 Fracture Inverse prosthesis has been used. This implant was specially designed as a reversed treatment option for selected fracture cases. Mechanical and biological notching should be reduced due to the special design features of the prosthesis. Patients were asked to describe pain and satisfaction for the injured shoulder one week before the trauma and also to fill in the ASES Score. The Constant Score for the healthy shoulder was measured whenever possible. Postoperatively Constant and the ASES Score were assessed. The X-rays were evaluated for notching and the healing of the tuberosities.",

The mean age is lower and male incidence is higher than splenic injuries admitted for others causes (road traffic accident, falls, other mountain accidents). An high number of snowboarder's' accidents was observed and pattern of injury is poor in these patients. The incident of polytrauma cases was the same in two groups and this observation confirm that snowboard practice is at higher risk than skiing for severe splenic injuries. In France, if number of raod traffic accidents is decreasing, the number of sport accidents is imcreasing in the last years. A better comprehension of mechanism, epidemiology and hystological findings of splenic injuries resulting from skiing and snowboarding is necessary to improve trauma preventiin programs. Introduction: Management of splenic injuries has evolved over the past three decades. Prior to that time, a diagnostic peritoneal lavage positive for blood was an indication for exploratory laparotomy because of the concern about ongoing hemorrhage and/or missed intraabdominal injuries. In children the nonoperative management (NOM) of splenic injuries rapidly gained interest because of the significant incidence of post-splenectomy sepsis as well as the complications associated with non-therapeutic laparotomies. The last decade has witnessed a proliferation of reports of NOM in adults with injuries to the spleen. Inclusion criteria for NOM in adults, which have been a source of controversy, continue to evolve. Moreover we noted that most publications focused on isolated splenic injury and not on patients with multiple injuries. This study was conducted to summarize the indications for the NOM of blunt splenic injury with special attention to the multiply injured patient. Material and Methods: We conducted a medline search. The search was designed to identify English language citations between 1974 and 2009: using the keywords: blunt splenic injury, conservative management, multiply injured patients and blunt abdominal trauma. The bibliographies of the selected references were examined to identify relevant articles not identified by computerised search. One hundred articles were identified. A cohort of three trauma surgeons selected 50 articles for review and analysis.",

Reviewing all data showed that the NOM of blunt splenic injury is a save treatment modality in isolated cases but also the multiply injured patient. Conclusion: Currently the non-operative management of blunt injury to the spleen is the treatment modality of choice. Important is a haemodynamically stable patient, with no signs of peritonitis on physical examination. Patients who only maintain their blood pressure by the constant infusion of crystalloid or blood products are not haemodynamically stable and need surgical intervention. CT scan findings and grade of injury are not, in themselves, criteria for laparotomy. These criteria are applied to isolated injuries to the spleen but can also be applied to the multiply injured patient. Age itself is not a contraindication. The general condition of an individual patient needs to be decisive. and finally hospitals with a low trauma incidence can safely use these guidelines in their management protocol. Introduction: The treatment of trauma patients with solid organ injury has changed over the last 15 years towards a less invasive treatment. Still our algorithms especially in dealing with trauma patients with ongoing internal abdominal haemorrhages is still based on fast control en stopping of the bleeding by any means. The use of CT-abdomen and subsequent performing angiography and embolization takes time. We analyzed the time path involved in angiographic control of the bleeding spleen. Material and Methods: A retrospective study. The study group consisted of ten patients presenting at our institution with a traumatic spleen injury in the period November 2006 till November 2008. All patients were managed according to the principles of ATLS. Data were analyzed using SPSS\u00d2 16.0. Results: The study group consisted of seven men and three women. Average age was 25 years (range 15 till 39). The ISS was on average 26 (range 20 -40). All patients in the study group received an angiography after CT-abdomen which showed an active bleeding focus in the spleen. Organ injury score were eight grade 4 and two grade 3 spleen injuries. Average time from admission to angiography was 139 min. Time to control of bleeding by embolization took average 50 min. Time loss between CT and angiography was on average 88 min. Conclusion: The time paths involved in managing this group of trauma patients with spleen injuries by embolization are much longer than expected. The time involved after diagnoses to actual control of the bleeding spleen injury is much longer than anticipated. Logistic changes to limit the time loss in interpretation of data from the CT-A, transfer of the patient, preparation of the angio-suite and less time consuming technique to actual embolization are needed. Articles were eligible if they reported the failure rate of NOM with or without angio-embolization (AE) in pediatric patients with splenic and/or liver injuries with a contrast blush on CT and included two or more trauma patients. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility and the quality of the articles and performed the data extraction. Interrater differences were resolved by discussion.",

Results: Primary blast injury: this form of injury results from the deleterious effects of the blast wave passing through the body. These waves have little or no effect on solid organs but have their major destructive potential in air containing organs, especially lungs. Secondary blast injury refers to the impact on a patient's body of projectiles usually inert. The addiction of destructive metal fragment, nails and other such objects to bombs increase the severity of injury and lethality. Tertiary blast injury refers to the deceleration and impact with the ground, wall or other inanimate object of the patient whose body is displaced by the blast. Quaternary blast injury refers to the miscellaneous forms of injury by-products of explosions, burns, inhalation of dust, contamination in case of ''dirty bombs'' or penetration of allogenic body parts shrapnel.

The injuries were separated into five grades of severity based on neurological examination including cranial CT. The injuries was also grouped into three categories based of facial regional involvement CT -facial reconstruction Results: The Control group included 383 patients with head trauma but without any facial fracture or brain injury. In group A included 82 (16,4%) patients with both facial fracture and brain damage.Among them 30 diagnosed with temporal-mandibular fractures accounting for 36,5%, 6 patients(7,31%) had lower mandibular fracture, 34 patients (41,4%) diagnosed with nasal fractures and 12 patients (14,6%) had orbital fractures. In group B were categorized 35 patients with only brain damage accounting for 7%. Conclusion: The data demonstrated that patients with upper facial fractures were at greatest risk for serious closed head injury (CHI).Injuries to both the mandibular and the midfacial regions with no upper facial involvement more frequently resulted in mild CHI with a modest likelihood of no neurological deficits. Trauma to only the mandibular region or to only the midfacial region was least likely to involve CHI Disclosure: No significant relationships. Introduction: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that results from exposure to a traumatic event. The individual may develop symptoms of three distinctive types: intrusive and unwanted recollections, avoidance followed by emotional withdrawal, and heightened physiological arousal. People who are exposed to traumatic events may also have somatic symptoms and physical illnesses, particularly hypertension, asthma and chronic pain syndromes. Hospitalized victims of suicide terror attacks are unique due to the circumstances and severity of their injuries which could have possibly affected the occurrence of PTSD and delayed the recognition of PTSD development. Our objectives were to evaluate the prevalence and severity of PTSD among hospitalized victims of suicide bombing attacks and to assess variables of physical injury as risk factors for the development of PTSD. Material and Methods: Forty-six hospitalized victims of suicide bombing attacks were evaluated for PTSD using the PSS-sr questionnaire by phone. Demographic and medical data considering the severity of injury, type of injury and medical treatment were collected from the medical files. Injury Severity Scale (ISS) was used to assess severity of physical injury.",

Presence of blast lung injury was significantly higher in the PTSD group compared with the non-PTSD group (37.5% vs. 9.1% respectively, p < 0.04). There was no significant difference in ISS values between PTSD and non-PTSD groups. Blast lung injury and intracranial injury were found to be predictors of PTSD (odds ratio 125 and 25, respectively). No correlation was found between length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay or severity of physical injuries to the severity of PTSD. Conclusion: Hospitalized victims of suicide bombing attacks are considerably vulnerable to develop PTSD. They should be evaluated with a high level of suspicion in order to identify PTSD symptoms and treated as soon as possible in conjunction with physical treatment. Blast lung injury and intra cranial injury are predictors of PTSD. Victims suffering from these conditions should be monitored closely and treated in conjunction with their physical treatment. Conclusion: From the use of the SMART adopted for the evaluation of the code of entrance in Emergency Department, we have deduced and confirmed the facility and the speed of use of this new model of triage. The triage SMART typically holds not only besides in consideration the traumatic pathologies but also internists that, it is an usable advanced triage both on the territory and in the hospital. We can classify the model SMART triage as a valid system in case of a disaster as is reliability and sensibility of assessment of patients result to be more appropriates in comparison to the other models of triage taken in examination. Conclusion: We showed that alcohol, massive bleeding needed blood transfusion and age were risk factor of trauma and Japanese emergency medical technician attendance was effective for trauma care. We suggested the reason of detachment by the injury form was that Japanese penetrating wound include many stub wound not gun shot wound. Introduction: Rapid aging of Japanese population is causing numbers of emerging problems in trauma patients care which consists of trauma in elderly people and increased pre-existing co-morbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms and organ failures. Nevertheless, little is known about the relationship between co-morbidities and trauma. The aim of the study was to clarify the influences of co-morbidities on the trauma mortality, using data from the Japan Trauma Data Bank (JTDB), a multicenter, nationwide and prospectively recruited trauma registry in Japan. Material and Methods: We selected the records from JTDB which fulfilled the requirements to estimate trauma injury severity score (TRISS) system. Logistic regression analysis after adjustment for baseline trauma severity based on TRISS system assessed the risk of in-hospital trauma death for following co-morbidities: hypertension (HT), diabetes (DM), psychotic disorders (PD), dementia (DE), stroke (ST), chronic obstructive lung diseases (COLD), bronchial asthma (BA), coronary diseases (CHD), congestive heart failure (CHF), liver cirrhosis (LC), chronic hepatitis (CH), chronic renal failure on dialysis (CRF) and active cancer (ACN). We conducted a couple of analysis which were adjusted or unadjusted by age in consideration for confounding between co-morbidities and elderly in age. Introduction: Monitoring the quality of trauma care is frequently done by analyzing the preventability of trauma deaths and errors during trauma care. In the Academic Medical Center traumatic deaths are discussed during a monthly Morbidity and Mortality meeting. In this study an external multidisciplinary panel assessed the trauma deaths and errors in management of a Dutch Level-1 trauma center for (potential) preventability. Material and Methods: All patients who died during or after presentation in the trauma resuscitation room in a two year period were eligible for review. All information on trauma evaluation and management was summarized by an independent physician. An external multidisciplinary panel individually evaluated the cases for preventability of death. Disagreements in classification were resolved during two consensus meetings. Potential errors or mismanagements during the admission were classified for type, phase and domain. Overall agreement on (potential) preventability was compared between the panel and the AMC consensus.",

The interobserver agreement between the review panel members was also moderate (Kappa 0.43). The panel judged 31 errors to have occurred in the (potential) preventable death group and 23 errors in the non-preventable death group. Most frequently mentioned errors were related to choice or order of diagnostics, rewarming of hypothermic patients, and correction of coagulopathies.

Fractures accounted for 79% of all ice-skating related attendances. An operative therapy was indicated in 23%. The mean costs for national health services were e1416 per patient. Conclusion: Fractures, especially those of the upper extremity, were the predominate type of injury as a consequence of collectively performed skating on natural ice. This incidence is >2 times higher compared to fractures occured during skating on artificial ice-rinks [2] . Wearing wrist guards is an effective tool in protecting skaters against injuries. We recommend wearing wrist guards during skating on natural ice [1, 4] . Especially (employed) adults aged 41-60 years are very prone to injuries resulting in a high loss of work days [2] . In contrast to children, adults might be more accessible for wearing protectors [3] . In future it seems reasonable for national health services to provide steps to increase public awareness on the benefits of prophylactic safety measures. This might result in a substantial reduction of costs for health care and society. Introduction: Liver cirrhosis has been shown to be associated with impaired outcome in patients who underwent elective surgery. We therefore investigated the impact of alcohol abuse and subsequent liver cirrhosis on outcome in multiple trauma patients. Material and Methods: Using the multi-center population-based Trauma Registry of the German Society for Trauma Surgery, we retrospectively compared outcome in patients (ISS > = 9, > = 18) with pre-existing alcohol abuse and liver cirrhosis with healthy trauma victims in univariate and matched-pair analysis Means were compared using Student's t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) and categorical variables using chi 2 (p < 0.05 = significant). Results: Overall 13,527 patients met the inclusion criteria and were, thus, analyzed. 713 (5.3%) patients had a documented alcohol abuse and 91 (0.7%) suffered from liver cirrhosis. Patients abusing alcohol and suffering from cirrhosis differed from controls regarding injury pattern, age and outcome. More specific, liver cirrhotic patients showed significantly higher in-hospital mortality than predicted (31% vs. predicted 19%) and increased single-and multi organ failure rates. While alcohol abuse increased organ failure rates as well this did not affect in-hospital mortality. Of note, alcohol abuse significantly decreased 24-hour mortality. Conclusion: Patients suffering from liver cirrhosis are at maximised risk for impaired outcome after multiple injuries. Pre-existing condition such as cirrhosis should be implemented in trauma scores to assess the individual mortality risk profile. Introduction: Early in-hospital treatment of severely injured patients has been internationally standardized by the implementation of algorithms such as the ATLS \u00d2 -concept. However, due to lack of time, the instability of the patients and the complexity of injuries, there is a risk that some lesions will be missed at this stage. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the incidence and significance of these missed injuries.",

For verification we additionally performed a chart review and searched the decubitus specialists-and ICU registration. Complications were graded 0 (no real health loss) to 4 (lethal). Identification of risk factors associated with an increased risk of complications was performed by univariate analysis. We also analyzed an autopsy findings of these patients and found that 7 of 19 (36.8%) had a difference between clinical and autopsy ISS. The most frequent missed injury were rib fractures. Six of these 7 patients were hospitalized in a period when we did not use MSCT routinely in multiple injured patients. Conclusion: TRISS is not a clinical prognostic tool but is used retrospectively for clinical and epidemiological research, performance evaluation, and resource allocation. It is required as a basis for quality assessment and improvement. In combination with autopsy findings, TRISS methodology can be an valuable tool for recognition of unexpected trauma deaths and further analyze of possible treatment errors. Patients had to be operated 5,3 times and were treated 23 days in the ICU and stayed 73 days in hospital. Mortality rate was 36% and rate of multi-organ failure 28%. 15% demonstrated severe senso-motoric dysfunction as well as residues of severe head injury. 25% recovered well or at least moderately. 29 out of 56 survivors answered the POLOchart. A personal interview was performed with 13 patients. The state of health was at least moderate in 72% of patients. In 48% interpersonal problems and in 41% severe pain was observed. In 57% problems in working ability concerning duration, as well as quantitative and qualitative performance were observed. Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder were found in 41%. The more distal the lesions were located (foot/ankle) the more functional disability affected daily life. In only 15%, working ability was not impaired. 8 out of 13 interviewed patients demonstrated complete work disability. Conclusion: Even severely injured patients after polytraumatization have a good prognosis. The ISS is an established tool to assess severity and prognosis of trauma, whereas prediction of clinical outcome cannot be deducted from this score. Introduction: One of the most common cause of preventable deaths in severe trauma is represented by delay in diagnosis and treatment of injuries, therefore a good teamwork aimed to reduce time consumption and errors is essential. There is in fact good evidence that the outcome of trauma care depends on effective trauma team performance (TTP). Critical points during trauma management are represented by lack of leadership, information sharing, difficult communication and decision making. To improve TTP, advanced simulators with full scale realistic patients (1) and trauma crew resource management (CRM) educational programmes are increasingly being used. Material and Methods: We made a survey among health care professionals (HCP) from 9 different level I and level II trauma centers in the Milan area that confirmed that difficulties in communication and conflictual behavior during trauma action is perceived as a barrier to ideal management. After a focus group interview to establish the need to improve performance we tested in our hospital a tailored trauma teamwork course using an advanced human patient simulator. The peculiarity of this course is the recreation of the same location of the trauma bay using same trauma team components and teamwork laboratory conducted by a professional coach as facilitator for the teamwork. This role is particular important since with this facilitation HCP can reach the awareness of wrong attitudes that lead to errors and bad performance. In particular, the tasks of the facilitator were the following: to help people understand their common goals to assists the Trauma Team to plan to achieve common goals to assist the group in achieving a consensus of any disagreements that preexist or emerge in the meeting so that it has a strong basis for future action A second survey few months after the course was made among HCP of our institute to evaluate the possible improvement of the TTP. Results: The second survey confirmed a perceived benefit among HCP who started to work in a proactive manner. In particular 78% of HCP reported the feeling of a better TTP and 86% suggested regular practice with advanced simulation. Conclusion: Integration of a tailored advanced simulation and a facilitator assisted teamwork could be a powerful method to improve quality of treatment in trauma patients. A score index to evaluate the improvement of the TTP during the course and in reality is although needed and is under evaluation. Introduction: Our university hospital is one of the only two national university hospitals in Tokyo and our emergency medial center is one of the busiest emergency center in Japan that receives 25 to 30 ambulances per day. Japan has a quite unique emergency medical system in the world. In Japan, emergency patients are stratified into 3 tiers, minor-primary, moderate-secondary, severe-tertiary. Japanese emergency doctor, that is not same as the emergency physician in the USA, take care only for the most severe emergency cases, tertiary level emergency patients. And if they find out the patient who needed an emergency operation, then they do the surgery by themselves.",

Also a selfassessment on the effect of training on decision making, communication, skills, team work, and leadership, as well as a general rating of training session were collected. Self-assessment was done using five step scoring system from one to five. Results are presented as means. Conclusion: The actual evaluated interspinous devices led to a significant reduction of ROM during flexion-extension, but to a significant increase of ROM for the whole specimen (L2-L5) during lateral bending and rotation, which increases the risk of adjacent level degeneration. Therefore the decision for the optimal individual treatment should be made on the knowledge of the biomechanical effect of each device and the underlying disease of the patient's symptoms. Introduction: Gait analysis is a powerful tool to monitor the degree of convalescence in fracture care after fracture fixation and during bone healing. Because of the availability of a large array of monoclonal antibodies and gene-targeted animals, the mouse has become the preferred species for molecular studies on fracture healing. Of interest, gait analysis after fracture fixation and during the bone healing process has not been performed in mice yet. We present a novel technique for dynamic gait analysis in mice and report the change of motion pattern after femur fracture and fixation. Materials and Methods: All animal procedures were performed according to the National Institute of Health guidelines for the use of experimental animals and were approved by the German legislation on the protection of animals. Ten CD-1 mice were divided into two groups: fracture group (n = 5) and control group (n = 5). All mice were anesthetized by an i.p. injection of xylazine (15 mg/bw) and ketamine (75 mg/bw). A standardized closed midshaft fracture according to AO-classification A2-A3 was stabilized by a common pin. The non-fractured tibia was additionally marked with a pin, allowing a measurement of the tibio-femoral angle by a digital videoradiography system recording 30 images/s. For the control group, one pin was inserted into the femur and one into the tibia without producing a femoral fracture. Dynamic gait analysis was performed at day fourteen after surgery in a X-ray compatible running wheel and the following gait parameters were determined: the minimum and maximum tibio-femoral angle, the stride frequency, the stride time, the stride length and the stride velocity. Eighteen representative strides per mouse were analyzed. All measurements were done using Osirix Imaging Software and the Open Source program ImageJ. All data are given as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM Introduction: Single distal locking screw insertion had been accepted as an option in clinical practice of femoral nailing. However, effect of number and location of the screw on rotational stability of the construct was still doubtful. Therefore, this experimental study was conducted to compare rotational stability of the femoral nail construct among three different conditions (two distal screws, single distal screw in different locations). Materials and Methods: Eight right femoral sawbones were selected for this study. Each of which was implanted with GK femoral interlocking nail (11 \u00b7 400 mm) and a static proximal locking screw follow by single distal screw insertion in the most distal screw hole. Then, transverse osteotomy was performed at the mid-shaft to simulate simple fracture. After the femur was stabilized on the custom holding jig, rotational force was applied to the femoral condyle by using a torque wrench connecting to the distal part of the jig starting from 2 to 8 Nm in 2 Nm increment. Total rotational angle in each situation was measured by modification of navigation system. Thereafter, testing protocol was repeated to the same specimen but two distal locking screws and single distal locking screw in the most proximal screw hole, sequentially. Different angle in each testing condition was compared among the different constructs by using paired t-test. Results: Rotational stability was significantly better in the group of two distal locking screws in every testing condition (p < 0.05). Single distal screw in the most proximal screw hole provided more rotational stability than that in the distal screw hole at 8 Nm (p = 0.003).",

            "text": "Conclusion: This study demonstrated that two distal locking screws provide more rotational stability than single screw in the case of simple mid-shaft femoral fracture stabilized with interlocking nail. If single distal screw was considered, insertion in the most proximal hole would be a better option in term of rotational stability than that in the most distal hole. Introduction: The exothermal reaction of PMMA leads to an extensive interaction between the bone cement and the plastics of the application system. This chemical reaction changes the structure of the bone cement and especially makes air pockets. It is necessary to develop application systems with a special composition of the plastics so that there is no interaction between the cement and the application system. In this study a new application system is presented for the first time which does not interact with the bone cement. Materials and Methods: Two different application systems for bone cement were tested in this study. One popular and frequently used system made of polyethylene and a new system made of polypropylene. A special testing unit, in which the application systems were mounted, was used. The testing unit worked with a certain pressure so that a defined amount of bone cement was injected. The resistence data and the time were digitally collected and statistically evaluated. In all 60 procedures were carried out. After the injection all application systems and the injected bone cement were microscopically analyzed. Results: Two groups, old versus new application systems, were divided. Both groups showed significant differences. When using the old application systems made of polyethylene the time frame for injection of the cement was 4 min while the time frame with new system made of polypropylene was 10 min. Microscopically there is a significant interaction between the plastics and the cement in the old systems with massive air pockets. In contrast there is no interaction, no air pockets and a homogeneous pattern of the cement when using the new systems. Conclusion: The new application system made of polypropylene showed a significant longer time frame for application of the cement as well as no interaction with the plastics. It is possible to treat more than one localization with one application system which makes it financially rewarding. Additionally there are no air pockets reducing the danger of infection und increasing the structural stability of the bone cement. Introduction: Femoral neck fractures are common fractures. Despite the frequency of this fracture and the consequences associated with it, little is known about the functional changes that can be expected during and after rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to identify prognostic factors for functional outcome, using a modified Harris Hip Score, after a femoral neck fracture treated with an arthroplasty. Materials and Methods: We included 252 patients who sustained a displaced femoral neck fracture treated with an arthroplasty. Functional outcome after surgery was assessed using a modified Harris Hip Score, and was evaluated after 1 (HHS1) and 5 (HHS5) years. We analyzed the following prognostic factors for functional outcome of patients after treatment of femoral neck fractures with an arthroplasty: age, pre-operative co-morbidity, ASA-score, type of arthroplasty (hemi-or total hip replacement), surgeon experience (resident or attending surgeon), interval between trauma and operation, blood loss, direct (associated with the arthroplasty) peri-and post operative in-hospital complications related to the arthroplasty and general post operative in-hospital complications. To challenge the outcome of the analyses we used the Cronbach's alpha coefficients for testing the internal consistency. Results: After one year the existence of co-morbidities ( \u2021 1) was a significant predictor for a poor functional outcome. With and without co-morbidities the mean HHS1 was 71.8 and 80.6, respectively. After 5 years all potential prognostic factors did not have significant influence on the functional outcome. To further analyse this outcome, internal consistency of the HHS was assessed. When pain and function of the HHS were analysed together the internal consistency was poor (HHS 1: 0.38 and HHS 5: 0.20). The internal consistency of the Harris Hip Score solely in function (without pain) improved to 0.68 (HHS1) and 0.46 (HHS5). When the potential prognostic factors were analysed with only the functional aspect, age and the existence of co-morbidities could be defined as a predictors for the functional outcome of femoral neck fractures after 1 and 5 years (r 2 24 and 19% resp).",

            "text": "Conclusion: Pain has such a dominant position in the Harris Hip Score that even immobile patients without pain can obtain a reasonable HHS score. The HHS, with the omittance of pain, is therefore a more reliable score to estimate the functional outcome. After using the HHS in this modification, age and the existence of preoperative co-morbidities appeared to be predictors of the functional outcome after 1 and 5 years. Many studies have shown that delay to theatre beyond 48 h has an associated increased risk of morbidity and mortality in this cohort. Our data revealed that there is certainly room for improvement regarding treated more patients within the 24 h guideline however, there will always be a group of patients whom medical input is required prior to surgical management. Lack of theatre time appears to be a significant administrative reason for delay. This is an area of potential improvement however it must be noted that any system of this nature will carry an intrinsic delay in processing. . X-rays and post-op data were analyzed on displacement, postoperative reduction, loss of reduction, and avascular necrosis (AVN) and revision rates. High volume surgeons were defined as surgeons who performed > 10 fixation procedures for proximal femoral fractures annually. Results: Mean age (72 vs. 70 years) and percentage of fracture displacement (55 vs. 58%) were equal in both groups. Re-operations following loss of reduction or infection was seen in 21 (17%) patients. Less frequent complications were AVN (8%), coxarthrosis (2%) and pain due to screws bulging out (6%) led to a total conversion rate to arthroplasty in 33%. Displaced fractures show a higher rate in loss of reduction (27%, p < 0.05) and revision (40%, p = 0.05) than non-displaced fractures (3.7%; 20.4%). Patients > 70 years showed 19% loss of reduction, 14% AVN and taking the reoperations due to coxarthrosis and pain into account, a total revision rate of 40% was seen compaired to 16, 5, and 29% in younger patients. Radiological analyses revealed that the lack of medial support lead to revisions in 52% of the cases, dorsal angulation in 50%. Low volume surgeons did not perform worse than high volume surgeons. The latter group showed 19% loss of reduction, 14% AVN and total revision rate 40%, compared to 16, 5 and 29% in the low volume group. We found no differences in the outcome of treating displaced fractures.",

Since the primary goal is to regain the pretraumatic level of mobility as soon as possible(3;5), we sought to investigate, if a minimal invasive anterior approach would be beneficial in regard of perioperative blood loss (6), postoperative pain(7;8) and thus postoperative mobility (9) . Material and methods: In a randomised controlled trial, 48 patients were treated by a hemiarthroplasty of the hip via an anterior or lateral approach in supine position within 72 hours after trauma(10). Apart from parameters like age, ASA-Score or Body-mass-index, the main focus was set on perioperative blood loss, pain and postoperative mobilisation.

A second pressure transducer was installed on the ultrasound probe to allow simultaneous monitoring of the pressure inside the compartment and the tissue deformity. For calibration, ultrasound images were generated at 0 and 130 mmHg. The plastic cover to tube distance was measured before and after compression (delta d). Subsequently, increments of 5 mmHg pressure increases were used to generate a standard curve (0-60 mmHg), thus mimicking rising compartment pressures. The intra-observer reliability was tested by using 10 subsequent measurements. A correlation was determined between the skin to bone distance (delta d) and the pressure measurement (p).

After extensive debridement, lavage and drainage, the peritoneal cavity was closed with a sterile gastric bag sutured on the rectus aponeurosis according to the so-called Bogota-bag procedure (5). The mean operative time was 75 minutes. A second look laparotomy was planned after 48 hours: one patient required one reexploration, four patients required two and two required three. The decision of re-exploration was based on the visual aspect of the peritoneal content, the clinical evolution and the bacteriologic results. For the last three cases, we elected perform colon resection without colostomy followed by anastomosis in two patients in the second look laparotomy and colostomy in one because of two relaparotomies. None of the ten patients required further percutaneous drainage. Two patients died in multiple organs failure (one with perforated diverticulitis and one with ischemic colon after aneurysm repair).",

Introduction: The purpose of this biomechanical study was to determine whether locking screws or smooth locking pegs optimize fixation of AO A3 distal radius fractures. Material and Methods: 8 pairs of fresh-frozen human distal radii were used. AO A3 extra-articular distal radius fractures were created by removal of a 1-cm-wide dorsal wedge of corticocancellous bone centered 2 cm from the articular margin of the distal radius and were fixed using palmar locking plates. The radii were divided into 2 matched-paired groups for comparison. The side order, the fixation order and the testing order were randomized. The distal fragment in group I was stabilized with 7 angular stable screws. The distal fragment in group II was fixed with 7 locking pegs. The proximal fragment in both groups was fixed with 3 screws. The probes were tested with 1.5 Nm for torsion and with 100 N axial load for 1000 cycles each. Stiffness was measured from the first 6 cycles regarding torsion and axial load. Then the differences of the stiffness were recorded during the remaining cycles.

Although previous biomechanical works have evaluated the effectiveness of different odontoid screw fixation techniques, no study has quantified the mechanical stability of odontoid fixation by a plate device. The purpose of this study was to measure the mechanical stability of odontoid plate fixation using a specially designed plate construct, and to compare the results to those after odontoid single-and double screw fixation. Material and Methods: The second cervical vertebra was removed from fifteen fresh human spinal columns. The specimens were fixed to the experimental apparatus, with the load cell at the articular surface of the odontoid process. In a first test series, stiffness and failure load of the intact odontoid were measured. Type II odontoid fractures were created by 45\u00b0oblique extension loading at the articular surface of the odontoid process. Afterwards, the specimens were randomly assigned to one of the following three groups: In Group I (n = 5) the fractures were stabilized using a specially designed plate construct, in Group II the fractures were fixed using two 3.5 mm cortical screws, and in Group III we used one regular 4.5 mm cortical screw. In a second test series, stiffness and failure load of the stabilized odontoid fractures were assessed for comparison and statistical analysis. Results: Group I (plate device) showed a significantly higher mean failure load than Group II and Group III. The mean failure load of Group I after fixation of the odontoid fracture was 84% of the mean failure load that was necessary to create a type II odontoid fracture, initially. Comparing Group II (double screw technique) and Group III (single screw technique), there was no significant difference regarding the mean failure load. In both groups the mean failure load after odontoid fixation was approximately 50% of the mean failure load of the intact odontoid.

Introduction: Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by reduced bone mineral density and disrupted microarchitecture of bone tissue. The most severe consequence of osteoporosis are osteoporotic fractures. These are mainly low-energy fractures, which anamnestically, clinically and radiologically differ from fractures in healthy bone. We tried to find the answer to a queston, whether it is possible, that osteoporotic compression fractures are single events, or if they represent a gradual, progressive vertebral collapse in patients with osteoporosis. We evaluated the forces, necessary for vertebral fractures, regarding the bone mineral density. Material and Methods: 14 cadaver vertebrae were isolated with the approval of ethics committee. We mesured their bone mineral density and then subjected them to the stress-test. We used the computer-controlled hydraulic press and stress vertebrae to the fracture point and beyond, monitoring the deformation and the load. A sigma-epsilon diagram was constructed from the data. Results: With the loading of vertebrae the pressure grew exponentially as a function of deformation to the breakage point. Then we observe a plateau of saw-like shape, which corresponded to the progressive vertebral collapse. Further deformation led to gradual compacting of vertebrae and we observed once again an exponential increase in pressure. This bone compaction is therefore the first mechanisms of fracture repair. The saw-like plateau form suggests progressive collapse of vertical trabeculae and their jaming into the horizontal, which then with the increasing deformation and load also fail. A similar phenomenon can be observed in the collapse of buildings during the demolition. (The 9-11 phenomenon). Conclusion: Unlike a high energy vertebral fractures, the osteoporotic fractures are presented as a gradual vertebral collapse. They take place parallel with the processes of bone reparation and remodelation. From this standpoint, osteoporotic fracture is unique. Vertebral collapse increases the bone mineral density in the broken vertebrae, what is observed radiologically and densitometrically. repair of medium to large, but reparable, rotator cuff defects, augmented with a Restore patch or not. Patients have been randomly assigned to receive standard repair augmented with the Restore implant or to receive non-augmented standard repair As the repair procedure is exactly the same in both patient groups, and the implantation of the Restore implant does not necessitate any additional incision or measures, neither the patient nor the assessors are aware of the fact an implant has been used. The ethical committee of the University Hospitals Leuven has approved the study. All patients get full information and are enrolled in the screening program after written consent only. Clinical evaluation, both pre-operatively and at 6 months post-operative is performed by the same, independent physiotherapist trained in shoulder evaluation using the Constant score Structural evaluation is performed by ultrasonography, performed by a radiologist specialised in musculoskeletal radiology and sonography. Unpaired two-tailed t tests, performed with Prism 5 software for Mac OsX, were used to compare the results of the scores in the control group with those in the xenograft group. Fisher exact tests were used to evaluate the significance of differences in the proportions of retears in the patients for whom a sonography was obtained.",

Introduction: It has been estimated that up to 30% of adults suffer from rotator cuff tears [1] , which can impair their ability to work or perform household tasks [2] . Management of rotator cuff tears is difficult as a large proportion of technically correct surgical repairs re-rupture, estimated between 13-68% [3] . It has been estimated that thousands of extracellular matrix repair grafts are used annually [4] to augment surgical repair of rotator cuff tears and act as temporary scaffolds to support tendon healing. The only mechanical assessment of the suitability of these grafts for rotator cuff repair has been made using tensile testing only, and compared grafts to canine infraspinatus [4] . As the shoulder is subject to shearing as well as uniaxial loading, we compared the response of repair grafts and human rotator cuff tendons to shearing mechanical stress. We used dynamic shear analysis (DSA), which is a form of rheology and allows the study of flow and material deformation.",

Only the Zimmer Collagen Repair and SportMesh had a storage modulus which was comparable to that of normal rotator cuff tendons (P > 0.05), and thus were most closely matched. Conclusion: With increasing numbers of repairs of rotator cuff tears, and augmentation of these repairs, there is a need to understand the mechanical and biological properties of the both repair grafts and the tendons they are designed to augment. There is no clear definition of the ideal mechanobiological properties. Current rotator cuff repair grafts display a wide variation in their shear mechanical properties, and how closely they are matched to the mechanical properties of human rotator cuff tendons. It is hoped that this study, in conjunction with others, will help to guide surgeons in deciding on the most appropriate repair graft. Three-dimensional computed tomography reconstructions also improved the average intraobserver reliability for all fracture characteristics, from j 2D = 0.624 (substantial agreement) to j 3D = 0.687 (substantial agreement). The addition of three-dimensional images had limited influence on the average interobserver reliability for the recognition of specific fracture characteristics (j 2D = 0.488 versus j 3D = 0.485, both moderate agreement). Three-dimensional computed tomography images improved interobserver reliability for the recognition of coronal plane fractures from fair (j 2D = 0.398) to moderate (j 3D = 0.418) but this difference was not statistically significant.",

Introduction: In recent years, 3D fluoroscope has used increasingly in orthopaedic surgery because it offers some advantages such as generation 3D data without anatomic registration requirement. Previous studies have focused on the clinical use of 3D fluoroscope in surgical procedures such as calcaneus or acetabular fracture reduction, or placement of screws in spinal surgery. There are no reported data on radiation exposure of 3D flu to orthopaedic theater staff. We want to correlate radiation exposure and distance concerning the patients and members of surgical team during using three-dimensional fluoroscope and study how far is enough until radiation exposure can not be measured. Material and Methods: An isocentric C-arm fluoroscope (Siremobile IsoC 3D) was used for the study. Human cadaveric extremity was used for target. Digital dosimeters (MYDOSE mini PDM-117, Aloka) were used to measure radiation exposure at specific distances. Dosimeters were systematically exposed by the following protocol.",

First we used low resolution scan technique to obtain the images. After all radiation exposure records were collected, we changed to use high resolution scan technique and repeated the protocol. Each technique was repeated in 3 times to obtain the mode of data. Results: Radiation dose at ground zero is 49 lSv in high resolution and 21 lSv in low resolution. Radiation in high resolution technique can not be measured beyond 1 meter from the center of the beam at the top, bottom, and right direction and 1.5 meters at the left direction. In low resolution, radiation cannot be detected farther than 75 cm. in the top, bottom and right direction and 1.25 meters at left direction.",

Introduction: Tibial plateau fractures with impression are often associated with poor outcomes and a high rate of complications. The current guidelines advocate anatomic reduction, re-establishment of tibial alignment, stable fixation, and filling of the sub-articular defect.

The post-operative impression was on average 2.8 mm. Evaluation criteria included the Lysholm and Tegner Activity Score. All fractures were stabilized post primarily. The surgical main approach was strictly medial. Exposure of the entire medial condyle fracture was first performed anteromedial following the fracture line to the articular border. The posterolateral impaction was addressed directly through the main fracture gap. Small fragments were removed, larger reduced and preliminarily fixed with separate Kwire(s). The posteromedial part of the condyle was then prepared for main reduction and application of a buttress T-plate in a posteromedial position, preserving the pes anserinus and medial collateral ligament. In addition a parapatellar medial mini-arthrotomy through the same main approach was performed for reduction and PDS-suture-fixation of the anterior eminence (ACL and anterior horn of lateral meniscus). Results: We treated 28 patients with 29 fractures. Median age was 48 years (20-77). We could evaluate 25 patients (89%), 3 patients were lost to follow-up due to foreign residency. The fractures were treated post primarily at an average of 4 days, 18 of them in a twostaged procedure with initial knee-spanning external fixator. All fractures healed without secondary displacement or infection. 24 patients showed none to moderate osteoarthritis after a median of 4 years. One patient showed a severe osteoarthritis after 8 years. All patients judge the result as good to excellent. The Lysholm score reached 95 (75-100) and the Tegner Activity Score 4 (3-7). All patients have achieved a minimum flexion of 100\u00b0. Conclusion: In our view it is crucial to recognize this increasingly observed type of knee injury in winter sport areas. With our strategy we achieved good results in nearly all patients. The described larger medial approach allows addressing most of the injured parts of the tibial head (medial condyle with posteromedial buttressing, tibial spine, posterolateral impaction). Material and Methods: It is presented one new minimally invasive method for closed fracture reduction and one extramedullary selfdynamisable internal fixator (SIF). There is no contact between bone and internal fixator in fracture area. It has been widely investigated biomechanicaly. In clinical use it has been applied to 119 metaphyseal fractures of distal femur and proximal and distal tibia. The age of patients was from 18 to 86 years. This internal fixator is applied by two small incisions. Reduction is achieved using standard traction table or using special reduction device. For opened fracture it has been used high mobile external fixation system as temporarily (39 fractures) or definitive (49 fracture) method. Results: Received clinical results are promising, as it has been shown early callus formation and radiological union within the 2.5-4 months. It has been allowed to patients early full weight bearing, if fractures not intraarticular. During the treatment it has been confirmed working of self-dynamisation concept, which probably all together with 3D configuration resulted in unexpectedly quick fracture healing. Follow up was 19 months (6-60). When used external fixation system, axial dynamisation has been regularly activated. Conclusion: According to results obtained, it can bee concluded that new biological internal fixator is suitable for minimally invasive technique, without opening of fracture site if no intraarticular dislocation. It can be used as primary method or soon after external fixation if damaging control concept used. Introduction: Disaster, is the disproportion between the need for medical care and the means available in the community. This discrepancy of needs /means is the major problem in every step of the Rescue Chain, when a disaster situation is present. This is more obvious at the end of the Chain, which is the Hospital and especially, the bottleneck of the entire disaster's management system, the Emergency Department. Material and Methods: In Greece, the most common and frequent disaster situation is the earthquake. And so, the most expected pathology of the victims is trauma. Because of the lack of 1. special organization of Emergency Medicine and 2. independent modern Emergency Departments in greek Hospitals, their directors did not give the appropriate attention to organize a disaster plan (internal or external Introduction: Accurate response to major incidents requires accurate decisions on all levels, from command level to the care of the individual patient. Development, evaluation and training of the process of decision-making requires standardized models providing complete and accurate information as a base for the decisions; a decision based on incomplete or incorrect data can not be properly evaluated. The aim of the present project was to design a simulation model that could be used both for evaluation of different methods in the response to major incidents and for training and evaluation of skills in making correct decisions. Material and Methods: A system was created providing the information required for this process in the whole chain of management and performance: Scene, transport, hospital response, co-ordination and command. Input data were based on real scenarios and real resources. For evaluation of methodology, all parameters except the one studied, in this study triage, were standardized. The results from (a) physiological and (b) anatomical triage, performed by staff on different levels of competence and experience, serving as their own controls, were compared. For training, the system was used in courses in medical response to major incidents with training of the whole chain of management and performance, from prehospital patient management to over all co-ordination and command.",

Introduction: Interhospital referral of traumapatients for reasons of special (most neuro-)surgical competencies to a specific Level 1 traumacenter, is common practice in the Netherlands. These traumapatients are sometimes admitted directly through specialized intensive care units and therefore do not enter the Emergency Department (ED). Therewith the standard assessment according to the ATLS guidelines is bypassed in these cases. This withholds the risk of an incomplete assessment. We therefore consistently coordinate the assessment of all transferred traumapatients. In this study we analysed the number of newly found injuries in referred polytraumatized patients and the clinical consequences in terms of extra treatment, permanent damage or death to the patient. We also analysed possible risk factors for missing injuries. Introduction: Synchronous admission of large numbers of patients into the hospital requires a perfect coordination of activities of designated teams in the process of reclassification at the entry to the hospital and subsequent continuous provision of medical care for the patient in the course of examination and treatment, up to his hospitalisation at the target department, in accordance with the characteristics of the injury and seriousness of his medical condition. This process cannot be accomplished through improvisation but only with creating a uniform organisational scheme, defining the recommended structure of medical teams and their activities during a multiple admission of casualties into the hospital. In this article, we present a proposal of such consensual organisational scheme, partially verified in practice.",

            "text": "The organisational scheme is defined in the following areas: -space arrangements -places of admission and organisation of work -creation of mini trauma teams (anaesthesiologist, traumatologist and surgeon or another traumatologist take over the most serious patients, the teams are accompanied by consulting specialists of relevant specialities (neurologist, neurosurgeon, radiologist), the whole teams or at least parts of them, accompany the patients for the whole period up to the definite treatment at operating theatre, or his placement at a destination department -the continuity of care is secured in this way, without the need to pass on any findings and information -placement of patients into individual hospital departments (follows certain rules, it is necessary to direct all the admitted patients into as few departments as possible (one or two), and thus keep the best possible view over the priorities during their treatment -entry corridors -,,green corridor'' -patients are immediately transported through this area by transport teams into the ''green'' designated area, the ''red'' and ''yellow'' entry area does not have to be extremely large, however it requires an adequate equipment from the material and technical point of view Results: Multiple admission of patients must be well-organised and managed, most often by a head-physician of the UA department, or another authorised specialist (in hospitals without the UA department). The idea of the TraumaNetwork D DGU is to built up regional networks of various trauma centers with the objective to standardise and optimise the treatment of severely injured patients -with the additional involvement of rescue services, physicians and competent facilities and centres for the treatment of specific injuries as severe burn or spinal cord injuries etc. To assure that all participating hospitals meet the criteria needed for the treatment of trauma patients, a certification firm (DIOcert) was assigned to accomplish the audits and to control the process of certification. Thus, every hospital has to pay a sum of nearly 6 000 EUR for audit, certification, benchmarking, yearly quality reports and the use of special IT-tools which were designed for the TraumaNetwork D DGU. Material and Methods: Coordination of traumanetwork implementation Coordination of audit and certification process Results: Since the beginning in the year 2006 actually 781 hospitals are participating the TraumaNetwork D DGU. These hospitals are organized in 48 regional traumanetworks. 26% of the hospitals are preliminary categorized as local trauma centers, 28% as regional trauma centers and 11% as over-regional traumacenters (the highest category). 33% still aren\u00a2t categorized. 407 hospitals have already signed the contract with the German Trauma Society and paid the participation fee. 250 hospitals meet the criteria for audit and 153 hospitals are already audited by the firm. In october 2009 the first regional trauma network (trauma network east bavaria / TNO) was certificated with a total of 25 participating hospitals. Conclusion: In the past 3 years the number of participating hospitals increased year by year. The nationwide acceptance and the high level of participation in the TraumaNetwork D DGU in Germany show that the treatment of severely injured patients is one of the main topics and exercises for trauma surgeons in Germany. If the expected improvement in treatment quality and the decline in trauma mortality is only wish and fiction or reality and fact has to be proven by studies in the next years. Therefore a working group with focus on quality improvement, changes in mortality, improvement in rehablitation results etc. was founded. Introduction: One of the challenges in trauma care is diagnosing all injuries. Any delay in treatment can lead to increased morbidity, prolonged length of hospital stay, costs, and even mortality. Despite the use of standardized guidelines for initial evaluation such as ATLS, the incidence of missed injuries in the literature is considerable. The aim of this study was to assess the rate of missed injuries in trauma patients evaluated in two Dutch Level-1 trauma centers and to determine potential factors that contribute to injuries being missed.",

This study was part of a randomized trial conducted in two Dutch Level-1 trauma centers investigating the role of CT scanning in the trauma room. Missed injuries were defined as not diagnosed during initial radiological evaluation in the trauma room. We assessed all missed injuries and the phase in which these injuries were diagnosed. Second, we assessed potential contributing factors by univariate analysis. Results: There were a total of 129 total calls performed with real patients and 328 test calls. Of the actual calls, 111 (86%) were performed while moving and 18 (14%) were done from a stationary position. Initial video quality in was rated good in 98 cases (76%) and initial audio quality was rated good in 97 (75%) cases with actual patients. 107 of the actual calls (83%) experienced some sort of temporary video drop during the entirety of the call and 93 calls (72%) experience some sort of temporary audio drop. These drops were a result of the setup of MESH WiFi and the need to jump from router to router. Users in the hospital found the program to be a very useful trauma and emergency medicine tool, but adjustments need to be made to improve the network. Conclusion: The use of telemedicine in a pre-hospital setting may play a significant role in the management and treatment of trauma and critically ill patients as hospital medical staff can intervene in real time during transport. Patients can be evaluated in real time which allows the necessary staff and resources to be available on arrival. Initial user feedback has been encouraging with users acknowledging its usefulness as a pre-hospital tool. (1) In the elective setting it is logical that a lower eGFR reflects poor renal function and low overall physiological reserve. The same is not obviously true for emergency patients who may have an ''artificially'' low eGFR merely as a reflection of acutely altered fluid balance. Change in eGFR from admission to hospital to ITU admission was also significantly different between survivors and nonsurvivors. This would suggest that eGFR reflects a response to treatment as well as renal function. This study supports the use of eGFR in the decision making process when trying to predict outcome in emergency general surgery patients. Introduction: The Surgical Medium Care (SMC) in our hospital is a 6 bed ward with monitoring facilities, and is used critical ill patients from the trauma and other surgical wards. Over the last years there has been an increase in the number and severity of trauma patients admitted to out hospital, as well as there has been an increase in patients undergoing major elective surgery. The aim of this study was to verify if these trends are reflected in an increase in patient-and workload on our SMC. In this study we describe the patient-and workload on the SMC between 2000 and 2008 using the TISS-28. The modified Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS-28) is a validated score of therapeutic activities and an alternative approach to evaluate outcome of critically ill patients (1) (2) (3) . Material and Methods: A prospective cohort study of all consecutive patients admitted to the SMC between 01/01/2000 and 31/12/2008 was performed, using the TISS-28 database. Of all admitted patients a daily TISS-score was performed. Besides the TISS data, patients demographics, referring ward, discharge destination, length of stay, and hospital mortality were retrieved from the database.",

Crisis situations such as these present unique, often completely unprecedented chal-lenges to those affected and to all actors with responsibility for crisis management and the protec-tion and rescue of people.With regard to effective interdisciplinary crisis management, both Germany's security and rescue forces and its general population suffer from widely acknowledged and scientifically proven deficits.",

Conclusion: Experts agree that the modern teaching methods and computer-based simulations mentioned here (such as virtual reality methods) are excellent tools to help train people efficiently to respond to events that cannot be planned, such as terrorist attacks and other catastrophes. The use of these innovative methods and com-pletely novel, userfriendly, web-based instruction and information modules is designed to address -to a heretofore unprecedented degree -all security and rescue forces concerned as well as the general population in particular. Ultimately this will signifi-cantly improve security and rescue operations in the event of terrorist attacks, crises and disasters. Conclusion: In a proper setting, laparoscopic emergency is feasible, effective, safe and beneficial for patients to be a part of a common surgical practice, as long as adequate training is obtained and proper preparation observed when more advanced procedures are attempted in critically patients.

Diaphragmatic lacerations are repaired by extending (3-4 cm) the existing thoracic stab or gunshot wound. The diaphragm is grasped with two graspers and brought to the operative field. Continuous or interrupted suture are used for repair. We applied this technique to 8 hemodynamically stable trauma patients (LA group) treated over a 4 year period at the university Level I trauma center and compared to 10 trauma patients requiring laparotomy (OG) for isolated diaphragmatic injury repair . All laparoscopically assisted procedures were performed by the senior author (RL). Length of stay, morbidities and complications were studied in both groups. Both groups were matched for ISS, age, and gender and mechanism of injuries.",

Introduction: Acute small bowel obstruction is mostly due to adhesions (83%), while internal hernia can cause acute small bowel obstruction in 2% of cases. This clinical condition has been considered for many years a relative contraindication for laparoscopic surgical treatment. With the introduction of CT-scan in the diagnosis of this clinical situation and the experience in laparoscopic techniques, more surgeons are now attempting laparoscopic management for this indication. The advantages of laparoscopy in abdominal surgery are now well defined, such as a shorter intestinal function recovery, a shorter hospital stay and less post-operative pain complained by the patients. In our presentation we want to analyse the importance of laparoscopy in the diagnosis and the treatment of acute small bowel obstruction, in order to underline advantages and limits of this technique. Material and Methods: In San Raffaele Hospital Milan (Italy) a total of 136 patients underwent a surgical intervention for small bowel obstruction from January 2007 to December 2008. 98% of the obstructions was due to adhesions, 2% to internial hernias. All the patiens underwent preoperative abdominal X-Ray and CT-scan. Results: Of the total of patients, 30 have been operated on with a laparoscopic approach, with a conversion rate of 33.3%. Postoperative morbidity was 0% in the laparoscopic group and 1.22% in the traditional surgical approach, with a shorter hospital staying in the first group.",

Introduction: Intestinal obstruction has remained one of the most common surgical emergencies. The aim of our study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and palliative role of laparoscopic bowel surgery in the management of large bowel obstruction. Material and Methods: In a period of 2 years, 15 patients were subjected to loop sigmoidostomy. In 12 patients the diagnosis was bowel obstruction due to rectal cancer. In 3 patients the obstruction was attributed to ovarian cancer. From those 12 patients with rectal cancer, 10 patients had contominant liver and lung metastases and 2 had an unresectable liver lession. In that period 2 lapassisted ileo-transverse anastomosis were performed due to obstruction from cecum carcinoma together with mlitple liver and lung metastases. Single surgeon-performed POCUS in the evaluation of acute appendicitis led to a correct diagnosis in 87,6% (177/202). Surgeons trained in US ordered a CT scan in 8,9% of cases and ratio of negative appendectomy was 1,5%. Surgeons not trained in US ordered a CT scan in 61,5% and their ratio of negative appendectomy was 28,2% (including pts that underwentent surgery on clinical investigation basis only). Conclusion: Surgeon-performed POCUS has a high sensitivity in the assessment of acute appendicitis and it is a powerful tool that minimize the use of CT scan and ratio of negative appendectomy with reduction of hospital and social costs; furthermore an advantage for the patients in terms of radiation exposure can be achieved. Moreover, to reduce additional costs, laparoscopic approach should be indicated only when the appendix cannot be perfectly visualized and localized. Introduction: Severe bleeding is, besides head injury, the most important predictive factor in severe trauma. Therapy of hemorrhagic shock starts already at the scene of accident. However, the best strategy regarding preclinical volume therapy is controversially discussed. The TraumaRegister of the German Society for Trauma Surgery (TR-DGU) observes the routine management of severely injured patients since many years. This registry will be used to describe the behaviour of preclinical volume administration as well as the consequences in early hospital care and its changes during the last ten years. Material and Methods: The TR-SDGU is a voluntary anonymous documentation of severely injured patients for the purpose of quality management. Data collection started in 1993. About 100 parameters are collected per patient. For the present investigation only adult patients (age >=16) admitted directly from the scene to one of the participating hospitals during the past ten years (1999-2008) were considered. A minimum injury severity of ISS > = 9 and available data for volume administration and blood transfusion were required. Means and prevalence rates were analyzed on a yearly basis.",

Introduction: The effective initial treatment in the emergency room of polytraumatized children requires a sound knowledge of common injury patterns, incidence, mortality, and consequences. The needed inital radiological imaging remains controversial and should be adapted to the expected injury pattern. Material and Methods: In this retrospective study, the injury patterns of 56 polytraumatized paediatric patients (age \u00a3 16 years) in the period from December 2001 to May 2009 were evaluated. All children were initially diagnosed with a whole body CT scan. The cause of accident, the localization including the detailed diagnose, the lethality and the severity of the injuries were analyzed. The AIS (Abbreviated Injury Scale) and ISS (Injury Severity Score) were used to classify the severity of injuries in different body regions. Moreover the number and the kind of operation as a consequence of the initial made diagnoses were investigated. Results: The mean score of the ISS was 30 \u00b1 13 in 38 boys and 18 girls with a mean age of ten years. The lethality was 11% and only 4% in the first 24 hours. The most severe and most frequent injury was craniocerebral trauma in 89% with an AIS \u2021 3 in 80%. Surgical intervention of the head was done in 41%.

            "text": "Conclusion: Especially because of the detected high percentage of head and thorax injuries in polytraumatized children and the needed head surgery the authors recommend a whole body CT scan in children who are potentially polytraumatized. Not only in adults but especially in children the authors suggest the initial use the quickest imaging with a high sensitivity-the whole body CT scan. Introduction: Patients who suffer physical injuries following a traumatic event are at risk for developing posttraumatic distress. Care workers in hospitals treating polytrauma patients are in an optimal position to screen and identify patients developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To start early intervention procedures and possibly lower the prevalence, a screening instrument to identify patients at a higher risk is needed. Aims of this study were to determine if the severity of injury is related to the prevalence of PTSD and to review the personality traits of patients with PTSD. With these results a screening instrument might be developed. To simulate an unstable extraarticular distal radius fracture, an osteotomy with a 5 mm gap was made. Axial loads of -10 to -100 N and torque loads of -1,5 to 1,5 Nm were applied by a testing machine to the intact radii and to the radii after each device was fixed as recommended by the manufacturer. After that, 1000 cycles of dynamic torque load alterations of 0,5 to 1,5 Nm (or -0,5 to -1,5 Nm convenient to side) at 0,5 Hz with a preload of -10 N were performed. In the specimens that were still intact after 1000 cycles, loading in torque was continued until failure occurred. Axial and torque stiffnesses of the osteosynthesis system were calculated. Results: With a median of 136,0 N/mm axial stiffness of XSCREW\u00d2fixed specimens was higher than of DNP\u00d2-fixed specimens with a median of 69,5 N/mm but did not reach statistical significance. With a median of 0,163 Nm/\u00b0torque stiffness of XSCREW\u00d2-fixed specimens was significant higher than of DNP\u00d2-fixed specimens with a median of 0,068 Nm/\u00b0. The XSCREW\u00d2-group reached 33% of the axial stiffness and 49% of the torque stiffness and the DNP\u00d2-group reached 14% of the axial stiffness and 20% of the torque stiffness of the intact radii. Conclusion: Fixation of unstable extraarticular distal radius fractures with a XSCREW\u00d2 provide biomechanically more stability than a fixation with a DNP\u00d2. Disclosure: No significant relationships. after distal radius fractures occur in 4% to 7% of fracture cases. The resulting deformity resembles Madelungs deformity and is also called pseudo-Madelungs deformity. This deformity leads to ulnocarpal impaction and dorsal dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). Several treatment options such as lengthening of the radius and shortening of the ulna or epiphysiodesis of the distal ulna have been described. The Taylor Spatial Frame (TSF) is a hexapod based external ring fixator, which is widely used to perform six-axis deformity corrections of the lower limb. TSF-planning is web based (www.spatialframe.com) but its use is only available for lower extremities. The purpose of this study was to apply the TSF to the upper extremities to correct pseudo-Madelung deformities. Material and Methods: Defining the nomenclature To correct bony deformities with the TSF, one must determine the deformity parameters, the frame parameters, and mounting parameters for the web based planning program. The six deformity parameters and the four mounting parameters use the anatomic nomenclature for the lower extremities. To use the TSF on the forearm, one must transfer the nomenclature of the deformity parameters and the mounting parameters to the nomenclature of the forearm With the transferred nomenclature, one can correct forearm deformities with the correction mode Long Bone of the planning program for the lower limb. Patients Two boys (Patient 1, 13 years, Patient 2, 14 years old) and two girls (Patient 3, 8 years, Patient 4, 7 years) were seen in our clinic with progressive pseudo-Madelung deformities after an epiphysial fracture of the distal radius at age 12 in the boys and 6 in the girls. Skeletal maturity (RUS, TW3 method) was equivalent to the patient\u00e2 e TM s age. Results: In the four patients, the multiplanar deformitiy of the distal radius could be corrected anatomically with the TSF. There were no frame changes or frame modifications necessary for deformity correction. Patient 2 was slightly overcorrected because of some growth in the distal ulnar growth plate. During the distraction, each patient had two low-dose CT scans for better visualization of the radiocarpal and radioulnar joint. The web-based planning program was adjusted twice until total deformity correction was achieved. No further immobilization after frame removal was required. The one-year follow-up showed an anatomic aligned forearm/hand relation with increased pronation and supination compared to the preoperative range of motion in all patients. The wrist and especially the DRUJ were stable and reduced at the one-year follow-up examination. The patients did not complain about any pain or functional deficits in the hand. Conclusion: In conclusion, the power of the TSF with the ability to move two fragments precisely can be transferred to the forearm. This allows for the correction of multiplanar radial deformities simultaneously without the need for frame modifications of rotational and translational deformities, as is necessary with the standard Ilizarov system. Material and Methods: Thirty-four consecutive patients with a suspected scaphoid fracture (post-injury tenderness of the scaphoid and normal radiographs) underwent CT and MRI within ten days after trauma. CT-reconstructions were made in planes defined by the long axis of the scaphoid. The reference standard for a true fracture of the scaphoid was 6-week follow-up radiographs in four views, based on current available evidence in the literature. A panel including surgeons and radiologists came to a consensus diagnosis for each type of imaging considered in a randomized and blinded fashion, independent of the other types of imaging. We calculated sensitivity, specificity and accuracy as well as positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) for both imaging modalities.",

            "text": "Introduction: The scaphoid bone is the carpal bone most commonly fractured in wrist trauma. Traditionally, non-displaced scaphoid fractures are considered by most as stable with predictable rates of healing with conservative treatment. Conversely, displaced fractures are recognised as unstable, with a significant risk of non-union if not treated surgically. There is a current trend in orthopaedic practice, however, to treat non-or minimal displaced fractures also with early open reduction and internal fixation. This trend is not evidence based. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we pool data from trials comparing surgical and conservative treatment for acute scaphoid fractures, thus aiming to summarise the best available evidence. Material and Methods: Fourty fresh frozen cadaver scaphoid bones have been sampled at our disposal for testing of screws. The bone density measurement of all specimens has been performed using a qCT scan. A transverse osteotomy will be performed at the waist of each scaphoid simulating a B2 fracture according to the Herbert classification. A load cell will be interposed, in an already established method, between the proximal and distal pole of the bone to measure compression force while introducing the screw. The screws will be applied as recommended by the manufacturer using original instruments. The intrascaphoid compression will be recorded at the peak during insertion of the screw, and after 30 and 60 seconds, 2, 10, 30 and 120 minutes.",

Bone scintigraphy is still a good choice to detect an occult fracture around the wrist. Introduction: Operations in trauma patients represent a second insult and the extent of the surgical procedures influences the extent of the inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to evaluate the operative burden related to femoral intramedullary nailing. Our hypothesis was that a reamer-irrigator-aspirator (RIA) system would cause lesser inflammatory response than traditional reaming (TR) due to a lesser intramedullary pressure increase and thereby reduced intravasation of bone marrow content. Material and Methods: Coagulation, fibrinolysis and cytokine responses were studied in Norwegian landrace pigs during and after intramedullary reaming and nailing with the two different reaming system; the TR (n = 8) and the RIA (n = 7) reaming system, and compared to a control group (n = 7). The animals were followed for 72 hours. Simultaneously arterial, mixed venous and femoral vein blood were withdrawn peroperatively and until two hours after the nail was inserted for demonstration of pulmonary, systemic and local activation.",

Introduction: Approximately 1.5 million joint arthroplastic operations are performed annually worldwide. Implant failure due to massive bone loss and aseptic prosthesis loosening, however, is a major complication of joint replacement. It is generally accepted that small particles (''wear debris'') and activated macrophages play a key role in aseptic loosening. But also the Prosthesis Loosening Fibroblast (PLF) plays an important role. Material and Methods: Between 1992 and 1998 208 ABG-1-hip arthroplasties were implantated. After a 7 year analysis 40% had to be removed because of massive wear of polyethylene (PE) and consecutive acetabular osteolysis. We analysed the influence of patient and surgeon, the implantdesign incl. PE-thickness, anchorage coupler, material roughness i.e. and the material i. Medtronic) The application of the cements was done according to the specifications of the manufacturer. After extrapedicular kyphoplasty on cadaveric lower thoracic spine vertebrae (Th 6-12), the intervertebral distribution pattern was investigated by microtomography (\u00c2 lCT). Besides creating high resolution 2D and 3D reconstructions, the mathematic calculation of the porosity of the vertebra, the bone substitute material and the relative part within the different compartments was performed. Of special interest were the characterization of the bone substitute material -spongiosa -interface and the penetration of the calcium phosphate cement into the adjacent spongiosa. The following parameters were investigated: 1. Trabecular structure, porosity and hydroxylapatite concentration of the native vertebrae 2. Structure (homogeneity, distribution of pores) of the bony substitute material 3. Characterization of the bone-bone substitute-interface a. Central located, filled kyphoplasty defect b. Transition zone with spongiosa and bone substitute material c. Solitary spongious bone Results: The investigation of the native spongiosa yielded a comparable trabecular structure, porosity and hydroxylapatite concentration in the intra-individual comparison of the vertebrae of the lower thoracic spine. Between the cements differences in the solitary structure as well as distribution pattern during kyphoplasty were observed. Especially the analysis of the ability to penetrate into the spongiosa adjacent to the centrally located kyphoplasty defect yielded significant differences.",

The biomechanical results could be seen at a measuring point at the quadrilateral surface and in the rotation around the X -axis (angle Y Results: We collected data on 68 acetabular fractures. A conventional image intensifier was used in 37 cases (Group A), 3D-navigation was used in 31 cases (Group B). In Group A the Kocher-Langenbeck-Approach was used in most of the cases (59%), followed by the Maryland-Approach (27%). In Group B, the Kocher-Langenbeck-Approach and the Ilio-Inguional-Approach were used in an almost equal number of patients (32% / 35%), but extended approaches were only used twice. In 28% of the cases in Group B fractures were stabilised by navigated placement of percutaneous lag screws. When we excluded the percutaneous operations in group B (n = 8), the difference in OR-time between navigated (n = 23, 365 \u00b1 129 min) and conventional treatment (n = 37, 264 \u00b1 100 minutes) was significant (p < 0,001). In group A we detected relevant postoperative complications in 35% of patients. The complication rate was significantly lower in group B (4%, p < 0,006). The postoperative radiological analysis revealed a better qualitiy of reduction in group B (n = 23) with an average post-op fracture gap of 0,34 mm vs 1,58 mm in group A (p < 0,025). Conclusion: By using a navigation system and a 3D image intensifier we found a significant increase in the OR-time in the navigated group. However, in the postoperative radiological analysis, we detected a better quality of fracture reduction in the navigated group. Navigation in combination with the 3-dimentional pictures of the ISO-C 3D led to a better visualisation of the acetabulum, therefore the need for extended approaches was reduced. To our opinion, this explains the significant reduction of postoperative complications in group B. We conclude that navigation and a 3D image intensifier should always be used for ORIF of acetabular fractures. Disclosure: No significant relationships. Introduction: The traumatism is the first cause of the mortality in patients under 40. It means a serious incapacity in 1 of 4 trauma patients.

The objectives are to improve the evaluation and the initial management of trauma patients, and to improve the knowledge of the frequency, the magnitude and the approach of these trauma patients. We defined 7 points to improve which are: To intubate patients with Glasgow < 8 (1); To not remove the cervical collar without clinical or radiologic cervical exploration (2); To move trauma patients monitorized (3); To not move haemodinamically instable trauma patients (4); To use two thick intravenous cannulations (5); To take thorax and pelvic simple radiographies in the trauma box (6); To fix pelvis fracture with a grassland before moving the patient (7) We took more thorax and pelvic radiographies in the trauma box (from 45.2% and 27% in the first period to 62.3% and 50.5% in the second period, p < 0.05).

Material and Methods: A total score of 100 is assigned to each firm from the beginning and marks are deducted for missed documentation. 2 sets of notes are randomly selected from discharged patients for each firm, one from trauma and one from elective surgery, each having at least 2 entries. Each case note is given 50 marks and the total deduction for both case notes are then subtracted from the total score of 100 to give the resultant score.",

Introduction: Despite the increasing mechanization in medicine, clinical skills must be to the fore of medical occupation and consequently must have a main focus in medical training. Especially in surgery, the mastery of basic clinical skills is of great importance for the young learner as it besides the knowledge of elementary principles substantially contributes to the understanding of the subject, the development on the wards, the operation theatre and the ambulance. In order to assure a standardized training using reliable, effective modern teaching methods, a ''Train-the-Teacher''-Course was developed. Material and Methods: In an 8-hour training, the important teaching modalities and methods for surgical skills as skills lab, simulation, role play, 4-Step approach are presented and trained in small groups with a maximum of 6 participants per group. Furthermore, the training focuses on ,,Giving adequate Feedback'' and examining practical skills. The training is evaluated using a standardised evaluation form. Furthermore, the teachers are evaluated by their students after each of their teaching sessions before and after the training.",

Introduction: Sports injury risk management and prevention is a very complex challenge that must be addressed 1 . One of the basic tasks is to perform epidemiological studies to estimate the risk in different types of sport. Up to now many studies were conducted on injury rates in specific organised sports 2 . Just a few taking into account any physical activity (PA) 3 . Therefore only for specific sports data about the influence of higher sport skills on injury risk can be found 4 . The goal of our study was to investigate the relevance of motor skills and sport education on injury risk, including the total PA and the occurrence of any injury in any type of sport. Material and Methods: In two Austrian secondary schools (Gymnasien) fifty-five of 63 classes were asked to fill out a two sided questionnaire regarding PA and sports injuries within the last year.",

In the Netherlands, a third of all prehospital emergency medical systems (EMS) rides concern trauma patients and yearly 860.000 patients are treated in the Accident & Emergency department (ED) due to an injury. Significant deficiencies in pain management in emergency medicine have been identified (2) . As a consequence, patients unnecessarily suffer from pain, and also recovery and healing are delayed. Furthermore, chronic pain is reported one year after trauma (3). There is no appropriate systematic approach to acute pain management in the chain of care for trauma patients in prehospital EMS and the ED. Aim: The aim of the research project is the development of a national evidence-based guideline for the management of acute pain in adult trauma patients in prehospital EMS and the ED. During the open reduction we applied a incision allowing to remove soft tissues and to set fragments of fractured bone correctly. In 2 patients we performed close reduction of the fracture without the fixation because of a patient's age. Results: XR 3 month after surgical procedure was done and in all cases we achieved consolidation of the ulnar fracture and good of radial head reduction. Complication after the treatment was the paresis of the median nerve, neurosurgical procedure needed. The nails were remove 6,5 month after procedure (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . After obtaining the union of the fracture and rehabilitation of the limb we removed the nails (3-6 month after procedure). Conclusion: Featured way of the operative treatment doesn't claim wide opening region of the fracture and reduces possibility of complications. Dislocated radial head after close reduction and immobilization period shows full stability. years. Data and X-rays were retrospectively gathered and analyzed. All fractures were scored according to the AO-pediatric classification. 58 patients were treated with solely closed reduction and cast immobilisation and 42 patients were additionally treated with K-wire fixation. SPSS version 15.0 was used for all statistical analysis. Results: Incidence of recurrent dislocation was significantly higher in patients treated solely with closed reduction (41%) compared to patients treated with additional K-wire fixation (19%) (p 0.018). The proportion of patients requiring a second surgical intervention was also higher in patients treated with closed reduction: 21% versus 5% of patients treated with additional K-wire fixation (p 0.023). Additional K-wire fixation results in a Relative Risk reduction of 54% and 77% for recurrent dislocation and secondary surgical interventions respectively. Complications of K-wire fixation comprised local infection (n = 2) and K-wire migration (n = 2). Conclusion: Additional K-wire fixation might reduce the incidence of recurrent dislocation and secondary surgical interventions after closed reduction of displaced distal forearm fractures in children. Larger and randomized studies will have to be obtained to confirm the results from our data. Radiographic controls were planned after one and six month and until the removal of the intramedullary nailing. We documented all peri-and postoperative morbidity, further operative procedures, the radiographic findings as classified by Capanna and the time till removal of the Nails.",

The percentage of re-interventions in the cannulated hip screw group is significantly higher than in the other subgroups. On the contrary, the mortality in this group is low.

Introduction: Periprosthetic femoral fractures are rare but severe complications following total hip-or knee-arthroplasty. The incidence for of these fractures are increasing, caused by a raising frequency of total arthroplasty for both younger and elderly patients as well as by a higher life expectation. So far there are very little long-term results regarding this issue.

However we see a slightly better outcome of the revision arthroplasty compared to the patients that were treated with osteosynthesis. We suggest more studies with a higher number of patients regarding this issue. Introduction: Fracture dislocation of the proximal humerus is a rare but challenging situation for the orthopaedic surgeon. If a closed attempt to reduce the dislocation fails, a demanding surgical procedure is required and the emergency setting is not always the best situation to face difficult cases. As a matter of fact a proper approach to this fractures involve an experienced surgeon, more than one assistant and a variety of instrumentation that often lack in emergency. Fracture dislocation of the humeral head is related with a significant increase of the risk of the humeral head necrosis and it is widely accepted that these lesions are best treated in emergency, but there are no reports on the influence of the dislocation time on the results of the surgical procedure. With this study we wanted to determine if a delayed procedure could affect the outcome of these lesions and if there is a rationale in postponing the procedure to allow a better organisation of the surgical time.",

Introduction: Minimal invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) should belong nowadays to the armentarium of each trauma surgeon. Applied correctly, MIPO not only meets the criteria of a ''biological'' osteosynthesis by minimizing invasivity as well as iatrogenic soft tissue damage caused by the operation, but can also provide adequate reduction and stability for fracture healing and early functional aftertreatment. Up to date, only few publications report on MIPO of humeral shaft fractures mainly using the antero-lateral deltopectoral approach for plate insertion 1-3 . Material and Methods: In this present study, we evaluated 29 patients (mean age 77 years, range 48-95) with displaced metadiaphyseal fractures of the proximal humerus treated in MIPO technique using an angular stable long PHILOS \u00d2 -plate. A lateral deltoid-split approach was used proximally and a brachialis/ brachioradialis intermuscular approach with exposure of the radial nerve was used distally. There were 23 acute fractures including two periprosthetic as well as one pathological fracture. Three patients were operated after failed conservative treatment, one for delayed-union and two cases were revision surgeries.",

Whereas one patient refused follow-up, 28 patients showed entirely healed fractures and satisfactory shoulder and elbow function after a mean follow-up of 8 months (range 3 -12 months). Conclusion: Minimal invasive long PHILOS \u00d2 -plate osteosynthesis using a combined lateral deltoid-split and brachialis/brachioradialis intermuscular approach proved to be a safe and viable procedure for the treatment of metadiayphyseal fractures of the proximal humerus with low morbidity and good functional outcome. Introduction: Plating for reduction and stabilization of proximal humerus fractures is a common orthopaedic procedure. However, angular and rotational malalignment is not an infrequent result, and extensive use of fluoroscopy is commonly involved. We checked the accuracy of a computerized navigation system(Vector vision trauma navigation system, Brain LAB) to enhance multiplanar fracture reduction and to decrease the requirement for fluoroscopy. Material and Methods: 5 men and 7 women aged 36 to 78 (mean, 56) years underwent PHILOS plate fixation for proximal humeral fractures. All fractures were closed with no associated injuries and classified as 11-A3 (n = 7), 11-B1 (n = 4), and 11-B2 (n = 1), according to the AO classification. The cases were assessed operation time, radiation time. And accuracy measurements were taken. Results: Patients were followed up for 6 to 37 (mean, 16) months. All the fractures united and occured no avascular necrosis. The mean operation time and radiation time were 74 minutes (range, 56-91) and 3.2 minutes (range, 1-7). The mean distance between fluoroscopy and navigation of reduction accuracy at the fracture site were 1.5 mm (range, 0-5).",

And computerized navigation has the potential for increasing precision in fracture reduction while minimizing fluoroscopic requirements at proximal humerus fractures. Introduction: The proximal humerus fracture is a frequent fracture in the elderly people. The lower density of the bone with increasing age is one of the main reasons for implant failure after osteosynthesis with a range of 10-50 %. The options of therapy are including the screw-, platelet-or nail-osteosynthesis or the endoprosthesis.Belonging to failure rates and the demand for early activity there is a tendency to be seen for early and strong stabilisation. Material and Methods: Since August 2006 114 proximal humerus fractures were operated with the RETRON-Humerus-Shortnail. The average of age was 73,6 +-15,4 (28-96) years. The demographic data, bone quality and fracture classification were documented including procedure of reposition, details of the implants, complications and postoperative course.",

The reposition was done in a closed mannor with a direct percutaneous assistance respectively. Intraoperatively 2 secondary dislocations and 1 corticalis brake was to be seen. There have been 2 insufficient nailing procedures. 6 screws had to be exchanged. The gymnastic began immediately after operation or with a delay of 1-2 weeks depending on the fracture classification. The evaluation of the Constant Score is on the way. The results show a good stability of the nail especially in osteoporosis. Comparing with platelets or antegrade nailing it is a minimal invasive procedure. The exraarticular access avoids any damage to the shoulder structures, especially to the rotator muscles. Therefore early gymnystic of the shoulder is possible. Shoulder impingement, screw dislocation and problems with the shoulder are avoided principally. The learning curve is short. shoulder score was used to evaluate functional outcomes. Anova was used for statistical analysis, with significance set at p < 0.05. Results: 307 files were available on 302 patients. Failure rate was 15.6% at mean follow-up of 4.3 years and a mean ASES-score of 75.3. There was a reoperation rate of 23.8%. Mean age at operation was 62.4 years. Mean operative delay was 4 days (range 0-98). Delay did not influence outcome. Young age at operation was associated with better results. When evaluating fracture characteristics significant better outcomes were evaluated with AO type Aand B-fractures, valgus or neutral fracture type, the presence of impaction and less displaced fractures. Quality of reduction and fixation of the fracture was evaluated with significant better results with anatomic reduction of the medial cortical border, less residual displacement and a CCD-angle that was corrected or in residual valgus. Osteosynthesis failed significantly more in C-type fractures, in fractures with an avascular head fragment, in varus displaced fractures and in fractures where an anatomical reposition was not obtained. Introduction: Fractures of the proximal humerus are responsible for 4-5% of all fractures.The most extensive used operative treatments are the plate osteosynthesis and the intra-medullarry nail fixation with proximal locking nailsscrews. Especially the latter technique can give iatrogenic injury of the axillary nerve. In this study, we define a safe-zone by using radiological parameters Material and Methods: The following procedure was performed in ten shoulders of embalmed specimen. First, the deltoid muscle was dissected from the clavicle. Then the axillary nerve was identified together with its branches and was marked with clips and radioopaque wires. The muscle was then re-attached to its anatomical position.Standard AP radiographs were made with the forearm in neutral (anatomical) position and exorotation. On these radiographs, the distance between the cranial side of the humeral head and the axillary nerve and its branches was measured.",

Second, from an anatomical perspective, the position of the axillary nerve is determined by the position of the humerus due to the connection to the deltoid muscle. Results: 15 EMG/ENG records were without pathologic variances of the axillary nerve. 5 of them pre-operatively showed pathologic variances. 2 of these 5 continued to show variances 3 months after the operation, which indicates a chronic lesion. Just one patient showed a pathologic ENG after surgery which was not seen before. The constant score was as expected. Introduction: Patella recurrent dislocation and patellofemoral pain syndrome is a common cause of instability in young patients and especially athletes. In the present study we present the results of the extension mechanism realigment throughout the Fulkerson oblique osteotomy of the tibial tubercle and soft tissue balancing. Material and Methods: During the last two years 11 patients (7men, 4 women, mean age 29.6/ range 20-39) were treated operatively for recurrent dislocation of the patella using the Fulkerson procedure. All our patients had as onset a traumatic dislocation of the patella that developed to recurrent. All patients were underwent knee arthroscopy for the treatment of potential chondral trauma or loose bodies removal and lateral retinaculum release. After that, we performed oblique osteotomy of the tibial tubercle, medialization and internal fixation with two cortical screws. This oblique osteotomy provides additionally to the medialization, anteriorization of the tibial tuberosity as we move it medially. Moreover we perform medial plication. All patiens used functional brace locked in 0\u00c2 \u00ba immediately after the operation and gradual ROM increase untill the 8th p.o. week. Results: The patients had no initial or long term complication. During their last follow up examination had a painless knee with full ROM and marked improvement of the patella tracking. The mean Lysholm score was improved from 63.2 to 90.5. No patella dislocation was referred. Conclusion: Our findings show that Fulkerson procedure of the tibial tubercle osteotomy and anteriomedialization, with additional intervention on the lateral and medial patella retinaculum is an excellent option for the treatment of recurrent patella instability and relief of patellofemoral pain.

More than 50% of those with ACL injury will develop radiographic osteoarthritis (ROA) within 15 years of injury although it is not known if return to sports is a risk factor for longitudinal ROA development. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the long term radiographic and clinical results of ACL reconstruction by comparing the injured knee with the contralateral knee in athletes returning to pre-injury sports. Material and Methods: Twenty-eight patients (20 men and 8 women, mean age 20 years at the time of ACL surgery, BMI 24.9 \u00b1 2.9 kg/ m2) were studied. Patients returning to previous sports and without meniscal injury at baseline were selected. ACL reconstruction was performed using patella tendon or hamstrings tendon graft. Radiological assessments using X-ray and a 3-T MRI of both legs were obtained at a mean follow up of 8 years after ACL reconstruction. ROA was determined according to the classification of Bohndorf. The IKDC score and Tegner activity index were used for clinical evaluation and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) for evaluating self-reported knee function. Results: The 3-T MRI revealed positive signs of ROA on the operated knee in 36% and on the non-operated knee in 25%. These changes were however limited to small localized areas of the knees. The statistical difference of morphological and clinical outcome of ACL reconstructed patients 4 weeks after injury vs. replacement after this period showed no significance (p = 0,09-1.0).

Introduction: Fractures of the distal tibial metaphysis account for 7.2% of fractures over the distal end of the tibia. Many of them are high-energy injuries causing extensive articular damage and compromise the soft tissues. Managing these fractures continues to challenge most orthopaedic surgeons, as soft tissue injury could be further compromised by unjudicious surgical technique. Aim of the treatment is to restore physiological alignment of the distal tibia and stabilize the fracture with minimal damage to soft tissues. Material and Methods: We designed an implant for the stabilization of distal tibial metaphyseal fractures, and gave the name ''angle stable''. The features of the implant are: precontoured plate with holes above the distal metaphysis providing positioning of screws with angular stable characteristics. The screws are self tapping and self cutting at the threaded part (far end) and have a cylindrical shape with a rim at the near end, that tightly fits into the holes at a special angle, guided by a targeting device. The distal screws penetrate the opposite cortex, and when they are tightened, compression is achieved. The plate is introduced through a small incision and guided onto the surface of distal tibia. 4 screws can be inserted distally, proximal screws are inserted through stab wounds. Biomechanical tests of this system were performed on cadaver bones. Since 2005 the ''angle stable'' system has been used in 41 patients in 35 cases as a primary stabilization, and in 6 cases as conversion of external fixation. Follow-up time was 18 months. Outcome was assessed with regard to function, pain and alignment. Introduction: The fracture of the distal lower limb with or without participation of the ankle joint remains a challenge to the surgeon. Due to the high energy released at the time of fracture, these injuries are usually accompanied by a severe soft-tissue damage. The success of the surgical therapy of tibial pilon fractures depends largely on the extent of the soft tissue damage as well as the quality of reconstruction of the tibial joint surface. A problem of the minute anatomical reconstruction is an increase in soft tissue problems and bone infection. Aim of this study was to investigate the results gained by a primary stabilization by external fixator followed by a multidirectional locked plate osteosynthesis after soft tissue consolidation. Material and Methods: Setting is a level 1 trauma centre, the design a consecutive series with a retrospective data evaluation. Between 2002 and 2005, 42 patients with high-energy fractures of the tibial plafond were treated using a two-staged treatment plan: 1. the fracture was stabilized with an external fixator immobilizing the ankle joint. 2. after stabilization of the soft tissue situation (mean 9.2 days) internal fixation with a locked-screw plate was performed. The implant used was a multi-directional locking internal plate fixator (Tifix, LITOS, Hamburg/Germany), made of pure titanium with locking holes for titanium screws which can be fixed in different angles and is available in seven different lengths (3-7 holes in the diaphyseal area). The mean follow-up time was 27.8 months. All follow-up examinations were supervised by a specialized orthopedic trauma Surgeon. The examination consisted of a set of standardized questions, clinical evaluation, the AOFAS Score and radiographs.",

Disclosure: No significant relationships. Introduction: The internal fixation for complex distal tibial fractures is sometimes challenging. Nowadays, successful outcome were reported about osteosynthesis through medial and anterior approaches including minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO). However, there are cases in which such methods are not indicated because of their soft tissue problems or their fracture pattern. In this presentation, the new posterior plating procedure using the MIPO technique is reported. Material and Methods: This procedure was indicated only when no other internal fixation methods were present, which includes intramedullary nailing or medial/anterior plating, were found. So the indication for this procedure was extremely rare. From 2005 to 2009, 34 cases of AO classification 43-A and C type fractures were treated operatively in our institution. 2 cases met the criteria. Both of them were female and aged 66 and 37. The follow up period was 24 and 12 months. The procedure was as follows; Before the operation, the spanning external fixator was applied and the alignment was reduced as properly as possible. The patient was in the supine position and the knee was flexed at about 90 degrees. The distal window for MIPO was positioned between the distal fibula and achilles tendon, which is called a ''Posterolateral approach.'' Blunt dissection was performed, and exposed the edge of the flexor hallucis longs muscle (FHL). The tunnel over the periosteum at the posterior surface of the distal tibia was made and the plate was inserted. Then an incision was made at the posteromedial border of the tibial shaft and exposed the proximal part of the plate (Proximal window). The plate was placed properly under the image intensifier and fixed with screws. The wounds were irrigated and sutured in layers. Postoperative rehabilitation included a range of motion exercise and non-weight bearing gait and use of crutches immediately begun. Full weight bear was permitted around twelve weeks post operatively. Time to union, complication and final ambulatory ability were evaluated.",

The radiological score is as high 8.1 / 7.9 (3 cortices healed and bridging callus). In the non healing group the clinical rate was 5.5 /4.9 (walking with splint) and the radiological rate was 4.9 / 3.4 (two cortices healed) The overall healing rate was 79%. Divided in several groups the healing rate increases from 68% (infected non unions not tibia) to 93% (atrophic aseptic non union tibia). Overal the secondary intervention rate was 14%. The healing time is 6.5 months in the middle. We see only mild side effects in 6%, like swelling. The most serious complication was the bony reinfection in 9%. There were 2 amputations.",

Material and Methods: Methods: At our level I trauma institute, from July, 2007 to September, 2008 each patient who presented with a clavicle fracture that was deemed operative received plate fixation alone or supplemented with bioresorbable calcium phosphate cement or autogenous bone grafting. Patient records and radiographs were retrospectively reviewed. Follow-up included standard radiographs to evaluate union at a minimum of 6 months. All complications were also reviewed. Results: Results: Two different clavicle plating systems, Smith and Nephew (Smith and Nephew, Memphis, USA) (23 clavicles) and Implant Technology Systems (I.T.S., Lassnitzhohe, Austria) (30 clavicles), were used with ORIF alone (11), autogenous bone graft (14 patients), or bioabsorbable calcium phosphate (28 clavicles). Of 53 patients treated with open reduction internal fixation, 6 complications have occurred at a minimum of 6 month follow-up. Three prominent hardware occurrences necessitated plate removal. One nonunion, one distal screw cut-out and one hardware breakage have been treated successfully with revision plating. Using Fisher\u00e2 e TM s exact test, no statistical significance was seen between the ORIF alone, autogenous bone grafting (2) and bioabsorbable calcium phosphate (4) in regard to overall failure incidence (p = 0.66).",

PTH which has been proven to influence fracture healing in OVX rats, was taken as a control treatment. Strontium ranelate is acting on both resorption and formation.

At the age of 24 weeks, osteopenia in the OVX rats was diagnosed. Then, in all animals, a standardised mid-diaphyseal fracture was induced. At the time of fracture, the animals were divided into four groups. Group 1 was the SHAM control group, Groups 2, 3 and 4 were the OVX treatment groups. Groups 1 and 2 were treated with NaCl 0.9% s.c. daily, Group 3 was treated with 600 mg/kg/d strontium ranelate p.o. daily and Group 4 received 20 lg PTH 1-34 3x/ week s.c. The animals were killed after 28 days and the fractured femur removed. The samples were scanned using MicroCT 80 by Scanco Medical, Zurich, Switzerland. The evaluation of the data focused on outer callus contour, cortical contour and marrow contour as well as cortical thickness. Torsion testing on the bones was carried out using the axial-torsional 8874 system by Instron (Darmstadt, Germany). Results: Treatment with strontium ranelate significantly improved the mechanical properties of the callus when compared to the OVX control group, while the improvement induced by the treatment with PTH 1-34 did not reach significance. PTH 1-34 and strontium ranelate both showed a significant increase in bone volume of the callus when compared to OVX control rats with no significant difference between the two treatments. As for the callus tissue volume, the increase induced by strontium ranelate was significant compared to OVX whereas PTH induced no change and the difference between both drugs was significant . In both the PTH 1-34-and strontium ranelate-administered animals BV/TV was significantly increased compared to the OVX control rats . The BV/TV of the PTH-treated rats was even higher than in the SHAM rats.",

            "text": "Conclusion: This is the first report on the enhancement of fracture healing with strontium ranelate. The callus in strontium ranelatetreated animals is even more resistant to torsion in comparison to OVX and SHAM-untreated animals and even to those treated with PTH 1-34. PTH did not significantly enhance the resistance of the callus versus OVX, despite a significant increase in BV/TV within the callus. The superior results obtained with strontium ranelate compared to PTH could be the consequence of a better quality of the new bone formed within the callus. Introduction: Recent clinical and animal studies suggest an elevated homocysteine serum concentration to be a risk factor for osteoporosis and fragility fractures (1) . In vitro studies showed that increasing homocysteine concentrations stimulate the activity of human osteoclasts (1). However, there is no data demonstrating that circulating homocysteine is related to structural and biomechanical properties of human bones. This study aimed to investigate the relation between morphological as well as biomechanical bone properties and homocysteine serum concentrations in humans. Material and Methods: Fasting blood samples and femoral heads were obtained from 94 males and females who underwent hip arthroplasty. Bones were assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), biomechanical testing (indentation method), and histomorphometry. Blood was sampled to measure homocysteine, folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12. According to their homocysteine serum concentration, subjects were classified as hyperhomocysteinemic (> 12 lmol/L, n = 47) and normohomocysteinemic (< 12 lmol/L, n = 47). Results: Folate and vitamin B6, but not vitamin B12, were significantly lower in hyperhomocysteinemic subjects when compared to controls. However, DXA, biomechanical testing, and histomorphometry did not reveal significant differences in bone quality between hyperhomocysteinemic subjects and controls.",

Introduction: Sometimes fractured bones heal poorly with standard treatment and sometimes a bone defect is a major problem. Although the bone grafting technique is considered a standard, there is a need for enhancement of this procedure. Healing of the cancellous bone is a complex process in which many inflammatory and signaling molecules take part. To improve the outcome of the healing process, one can influence it by applying platelet rich plasma gel locally, thereby releasing cytokines and growth factors (1). Cancellous bone is rich with mesenchymal stem cells that produce new bone when stimulated.",

Five of the patients had osteomyelitis in the fracture and all fractures resulted in a bony defect as a serious complication after treatment. We designed a protocol for the preparation of allogeneic platelet rich plasma gel with suspended autologous cancellous bone, based on laboratory experiments in vitro (2) . Cancellous bone was harvested from iliac bone crest. We used standard AB0 and RhD identical, leukocyte depleted and irradiated platelets from a blood bank. Activation of the platelet gel was achieved by using a CaCl2 and thrombin mixture. We accepted patients after fulfilling the inclusion criteria and they were operated on in a standardized manner by their elected surgeons under technical supervision. In their follow-up, the ingrowths of bone grafts were measured by using x-ray analysis (3). Results: In 6 patients the transplant was sufficiently incorporated in the fracture to give a limb full function. There were no major complications related to the platelet rich plasma additives. In one patient a nerve paresis was observed, which resolved spontaneously. In 2 patients bone graft was not sufficiently incorporated, once because of poor compliance and the other time because of complex nature of distal tibia fracture. The clinical outcome of the operated patients (75%) is satisfactory and encouraging. Conclusion: The preliminary clinical results show that using platelet rich plasma and cancellous bone in the treatment of large bone defects has a promising therapeutic potential.",

Results: 7 patients were admitted directly to our hospital, the rest transferred from other hospitals. 18 patients had their hip reduced after a mean time of 276 minutes. 2 had femoral traction applied and 3 patients were not reduced. Mean time from trauma to operation was 6 \u00b1 3.8 days. Three patients received total hip arthroplasty. The results of will be presented at the congress. Conclusion: The conclusions will be given at the presentation. Introduction: Distal inter-locking using free-hand technique in intramedullary nailing is always a time consuming procedure. The use of Xray amplifier is mandatory and the exposure to radiation is rarely modest. If we use navigation devices we rarely trust the device completely and that is why we check the position with X-ray amplifier more than we need to. That is why we did laboratory testing of the new system using the electromagnetic navigation with the use of micro sensors for free-hand interlocking technique in laboratory without the use of X-ray amplifier to ensure the use of system in the operating theatre. Material and Methods: Three residents with little experience in distal interlocking and no experience with this device were testing the electromagnetic navigation system with the use of micro sensors for free-hand interlocking technique. 100 interlocking holes were drilled by the use of Guiding star platform in Lidis module, Ekliptik, Slovenia. The system producer had 20 minutes of introduction time, afterwards drilling was done. Distal locking was done on UTN Synhes nail and instead of bone, cannulated hard wood rods were used. We measured time needed for calibration and time needed for reaming and weather we were successful or not. Introduction: Percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) is a useful method to manage pericardial effusion. However, PCD is not always effective in a case of hemopericardium due to clot. To perform subxiphoid pericardiotomy within a minute for emergency cases, we have done this procedure in a blind method following finger dissection by subxiphoid approach, which was preliminary reported in 2005. We present the final data to report the usefulness of blind subxiphoid pericardiotomy (BSP) for emergency cases with acute hemopericardium.",

Introduction and Objectives: Heart trauma, mostly penetrating, is not common in our community, but carries a significant morbidity. Its clinical presentation can be variable. Our objective was to asses the incidence, clinical presentation, associated injuries and mortality of our patient population with trauma to the heart. Material and Methods: Observational, descriptive, retrospective analysis of patient with heart trauma included in our trauma registry between 1993 and 2007. We reviewed demographic characteristics, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, Injury Severity Score (ISS) and New Injury Severity Score (NISS), mortality, TRISS probability of survival (Ps), and hospital length of stay. Results: We found 17 (1.1%) patients with cardiac traumatism out of 1.575 patients included in our registry, 6 (35%) with associated injuries and 11 (65%) isolated; 13 (76.5%) were from penetrating trauma, and only 4 (23.5%) were from blunt trauma. Mean ISS and NISS were of 28 (+/-12) and 35 (+/-14), respectively. Three patients presented ''in extremis'' (agonal status), nine presented with hemodynamic ''stability'' (SBP> 90 mmHg) (33% of them with a HR> 120 bpm), and five patients presented with hemodynamic instability. Only 30 % of the patients presented with cardiac tamponade, without hemothorax. Two pericardiocentesis (12%), 3 pericardial windows (18%), and 4 emergency room thoracotomies were done (23.5%).",

            "text": "Approach of Two Cases of Secondary Aortoesophageal Fistula Results: The 1 st patient was a 57-y-old man in which fistula was secondary to a fish-bone ingestion, 10 days before the admission. In the 2 nd cause, a 66-y-old man, fistula was secondary to rupture in oesophagus of a known thoracic aortic aneurysm. Diagnosis was made by a contrast-enhanced CT scan; a gastrografin X-ray in the1 st and an endoscopy in the 2 nd case completed the examination. In both cases the lesion consisted of a few-mm-diameter defect of the oesophageal wall. In the I case an emergent endovascular repair of thoracic aorta by Bolton Relay 28\u00b7110 mm stent graft was per-formed; in the II case, endovascular repair of thoracic aorta (by Bolton Relay 28x145 mm) was associated to an endoprosthesis placement for primary treatment of a preexisting infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Postoperatively TPN was administered. Definitive treatment of fistula was performed in both cases by an explorative right thoracotomy (in V and VII post-operative day respectively): oesopagus was primarily repaired and reinforced by a pedicled intercostal muscle flap and a nutritional jejunostomy was associated. Subsequent post-operative course consisted in NE administration, prolonged nasogastric suction, resuscitation with fluids, antibiotics. Hemorrhagic complications or infections were excluded by repeated CT scan. Oral feeding was in 19 th and 7 th postoperative day, after exclusion of a persistent fistula at a gastrografin X-ray of oesophagus. Hospital stay was of 30 days in both cases. No late complications were registered at follow-up. Conclusion: When an aortoesophageal fistula occurs (if consists of a small oesophageal lesion), emergent treatment of endovascular aortic repair can be successfully associated to a second-step primary repair using a pedicled intercostal muscle flap via a right thoracotomy. Results: Case 1: A 51-year-old male is taken to our hospital after a car crash. On CT scan there was a periaortic hematoma from isthmus to diaphragm, multiple rib (flail chest) fractures, and a pelvic fracture. The aorta was repaired with an endograft with good immediate results. Case 2: A 55-year-old male, injured in a frontal car crash. On CT scan a mediastinal periaortic hematoma was seen, with a pseudoaneurysm at the origin of the descendent thoracic aorta, distal to the sublavian artery. The aorta was repaired with an endograft, which was replaced at day 16th because of a leak. On follow-up he is doing very well. Case 3: A 26-year-old male, injured in a car crash. CT scan findings were as follows: a left diaphragamatic herniation, bilateral lung contusion, traumatic laceration of the descending aorta, pelvic fracture and spleen laceration. He underwent an emergency laparotomy with splenectomy and diaphragmatic repair. On the 2 nd postop. day an endograft was placed at the descending thoracic aorta, without complications. Case 4: A 68-year-old male, injured in a frontal car crash. On CT scan there was a thoracic aortic laceration, distal to the isthmus, and an aortic endovascular repair was undertaken at day 10 th , after complete hemodynamic normalization. The patient died at day 58 th from multiple organ failure. Conclusion: Traumatic thoracic aortic injuries are frequently associated to severe thoracic, abdominal and orthopaedic injuries. Traditional early surgical aortic repair through thoracotomy, with single lung ventilation and, occasionally, extracorporeal circulation carries a high morbidity and mortality. That is the reason why aortic repair has classically been delayed, but this carries an additional mortality rate of between 6% and 9%. Endovascular treatment allows for an early management in severely traumatized patients who otherwise wouldn't stand such a risky surgery. It has also revealed lower rates of paraplegia after 10 years of follow-up. Introduction: Injuries in zone I of the neck are rare and difficult to manage particularly in environment of war. This area gathers aerodigestive, vascular, lymphatic and nervous elements. All the difficulties lie in diagnosis of the lesions, in the decision of a surgical exploration and in the way of repair if necessary. In that situation, fistula between carotid artery and jugular vein is very uncommon, accounting for 4% of all arterial injuries. Through one case, which has occurred in Afghanistan, we discuss the various possible solutions to repair such a lesion. Material and Methods: We report one case of a french soldier, 30 yo, who was wounded by a rocket splinter on left side of the area I of the neck. He was transported immediately in French Role II in Kaboul. Respiratory tracks are not injured, there's no neurologic lesions. He had a huge haematoma of the area with a tracheal back pushing (Xray exam). During an effort of cough, a haemorrhage through the wound occurred requiring an oro-tracheal intubation and a surgical exploration by a cervicotomy. No obvious vascular lesions were found but just a thrill at the base of the neck. The patient was hemodynamically stable. He was transferred by medevac to France in the night. An angioscanner showed a fistula between carotid and jugular vein (2 photos).",

            "text": "The favorable outcome of this case illustrates that surgery is a reasonable alternative when an endovascular approach is not feasible in patients with trauma-acquired arteriovenous fistulae. Allograft or vein graft, if possible, is also a good solution for this kind of injuries. Introduction: We report 3 cases of subclavian artery injury caused by traffic accidents. In all cases, surgical vascular reconstruction was undertaken. In 2 of the cases, the subclavian artery was obstructed by intimal dissection caused by falling down from a motorcycle. In the remaining case, subclavian artery aneurysm caused by seat belt injury occurred. Material and Methods: Case 1: 59-year-old male While driving a large motorcycle, the patient collided with a car and the left side of his body was trapped in the car. This resulted in traumatic pneumothorax and severe ischemia of his left upper limb, and he was transported to our Level 1 trauma center for surgical treatment. Bypass surgery using a 6mm diameter PTFE was performed. Postoperative arteriography showed good patency of the graft and the patient was discharged. Recovery from the motor dysfunction caused by brachial plexus injury took 7 months. Case 2: 19-year-old male For this case, the patient ran into a wall while driving a 50 cc motorcycle. Bypass surgery and clavicular ORIF were undertaken simultaneously for right clavicular fracture and ischemia of the right upper limb. Postoperative arteriography showed good patency of the graft and the ischemia improved. However, rehabilitation was needed for the motor dysfunction caused by brachial plexus injury. Case 3: 68-yearold female The patient ran into a tree while driving a car resulting in hemorrhagic shock caused by bilateral femoral and humeral fractures. She was transported to our center by helicopter. A scar from seat belt injury was found in the right cervical area. She presented with an expanding mass around the subclavian artery with accompanying pulsating pain. Arteriography detected a 5 cm-diameter pseudoaneurysm and aneurysmectomy was undertaken. Postoperative computed tomography confirmed the disappearance of aneurysm and she was discharged. Results: These 3 cases showed favorable outcomes with surgical vascular reconstruction. Conclusion: Traumatic subclavian artery stenosis is caused by crushinduced local dissection and is frequently complicated with brachial plexus injury. Subclavian artery aneurysm caused by seat belt injury occurred. Disclosure: No significant relationships. Results: Case description: 40 years old male patient who was brought in after receiving a large stab wound below the mid-portion of the left clavicle. Severe external bleeding was prevented by manual compression in transit to the hospital. Three Foley catheters introduced through the wound at the ED failed to temporarily control the bleeding due to its large size, and he was rushed to the OR. An emergency left antero-lateral thoracotomy allowed for the blind manual compression of the bleeding vessel from within the thoracic cavity, and was very successful in stopping the external bleeding. A long supra-and infra-clavicular incision was done, and the clavicle was divided. This failed to expose the bleeding vessel, due to the large muscle mass of the patient. A decision was taken to split the sternum in a ''trap-door'' approach, which nicely exposed a large laceration of the subclavian vein. This was suture-ligated, and the incision closed, in a surgical field with profused oozing from coagulopathy. He was taken to the ICU, and then back to the OR two hours later because of persistent bleeding through the chest drains. The ''trap-door'' incision was reopened and careful haemostasis was performed. The patient had a protracted course in the ICU but eventually recovered. As a striking and very uncommon sequel he developed severe blindness from bilateral ischemic optic neuropathy attributed to hypotension and use of vasopressors. He is free of pain at the incision and with good cosmetic results Conclusion: ''Trap-door'' incisions are very infrequently used nowadays, but should be kept in mind in the armamentarium of trauma surgeons. Disclosure: No significant relationships. Conclusion: Mortality in patients with IVC injuries can be well predicted by hemodynamic parameters on arrival and intra-operative findings .Hemodynamic instability and intraoperarive findings of expanding hematomas and active intra-peritoneal bleeding are associated with high mortality.",

We decided local surgical debridement; after haemathoma evacuation we identified external illiac artery presenting a stent graft and reinforced it by double layer of tissue sealing surgical patch. Results: Postoperative course was favorable under complex general and local therapy.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Endovascular treatment of arterial pseudoaneurysms has become feasible as natural extension of the endovascular techniques. CT, MRI, sonography and angiography may all be valuable in the imaging working of pseudoaneurysms. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are necessary to avoid the morbidity and mortality secondary to hemorrhage and rupture. Although endovascular stent-grafting is not considered a standard therapy for infected aneurysms, our case suggest that stent-graft deployment, secondary surgical debridement and major antimicrobial therapy may be the most favorable treatment option for patients unfit for major surgery. Introduction: The incidence of traumatic vascular injuries (TVI) has increased significantly in the last decades, with penetrating trauma as the most frequent mechanism. Our aim was to estimate the incidence, management by interventional radiology, and the preventable death rate in our patient population. Material and Methods: A retrospective observational study based on our Trauma Registry covering a 14-year period (July 1993 to July 2007) . We have assessed the demographics, severity, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, outcome, and TRISS probability of survival (Ps). Results: 76 patients (80% males, with a mean age of 37 years) suffered a TVI located at the head (2), neck (7), thorax (20), abdomen (4), upper extremities (19) and lower extremities (24), respectively. 39 (51.3%) were caused by a blunt mechanism, and 37 (48.7%) by an open one. The average time spent before being taken to hospital was 60 minutes. Upon arrival to hospital, 20 were in shock, 22 required orotracheal intubation, and 2 a cardiac massage. The diagnostic methods used were a CT scans in 54, DPL in 1, FAST in 7, angiography in 16, echocardiogram in 4 and duplex-doppler in 1. 69 (90.8%) patients underwent emergency surgery and 8 (10.5%) were treated with interventional radiology (7 of them associated with surgery). Only 6 (7.9%) were treated conservatively. Overall mortality was of 12 patients (15.8%) (6 of them died upon their arrival to hospital or in the operating room, all of them with an aortic injury), out of which 5 (6.6%) had a TRISS Ps > 0.5. The incidence of TVI increased from 15 cases in the 1993-1997 period to 30 in 1998-2002, remaining stable in 2003-2007 (31) . However, the mortality rate has shown a steady decline over the years (from 33% in 1993-1997, to 16% in 2003-2007) .",

These injuries are most commonly located in the lower extremities, followed by the thorax. 10% of patients could be managed by interventional radiology techniques. Introduction: The tip apex distance (TAD) is a simple measurement that predicts screw cut out in the femoral head in peritrochanteric fractures treated with a fixed angle sliding hip screw device. We wanted to assess whether the TAD measurements in our centre were comparable to previously published results, how reproducible these measurements were between observers and how accurate we were at reducing the fractures. Material and Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of 102 consecutively treated peritrochanteric fractures over a 12 month period. 11 patients were excluded because they did not sustain a peritrochanteric fracture, had treatment of a pathological fracture or because of incomplete radiographic data. Three observers used a standardised method to measure the TAD (from 2 orthogonal projections with a correction for magnification). The stability of the fracture patterns and the accuracy of reduction were measured according to criteria from the original Baumgaertner paper 1 Introduction: Distal locking screw insertion of the short Gamma 3 nail is normally performed by using a targeting device attached firmly to the proximal part of the nail. Generally, the accuracy of targeting device should be promising. However, missing the target in the process of drilling might be a potential risk. We report 5 cases of such condition in term of early radiographic finding, method of solving and the result of treatment.",

Ten different types of antibiotics were used after wound exploration for a period between 1 and 12 weeks. In-hospital mortality was 15%. Sixty-nine percent (n=27) was finally discharged from follow-up. Conclusion: We conclude that our infection rate was higher than reported in literature and the infections classified initially as superficial required a prolonged treatment as well. Moreover, the treatment of this disastrous complication showed no uniformity whatsoever and should be the topic of further research, resulting in a clear protocol to increase survival and decrease morbidity. Introduction: Allograft meniscal transplantation is known as a possible procedure to solve pain and loss of function in the knee of patients with a history of subtotal or total meniscectomy. Medium-term and long-term results after meniscal allograft transplantation in the knee are scarce. In this study patients who received an arthroscopically assisted meniscal allograft transplantation with a follow-up between 5 and 15 years were evaluated using subjective questionnaires, a clinical and a radiographical evaluation. Material and Methods: Demographic data of all patients were collected and pre-operative results, using the KOOS (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score), the Lysholm score, the Tegner score, the SF 36 and the VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) for pain were compared with actual results of those questionnaires to evaluate the therapeutic effects of allograft meniscal transplantation in the knee during medium-term follow-up. Patients were evaluated with a standardized clinical examination of the knee to objectivate knee related symptoms. Standard weight bearing radiographs and a full leg standing radiograph were performed to evaluate the evolution of osteoarthritis and malalignment. Results: For all questionnaires (VAS, KOOS, Lysholm, SF 36) there is a significant (p<0,0001) and clinically relevant increase in postoperative score. This improvement stays consistent during the followup period. The more severe the osteoarthritis, the lower the improvement. Despite the meniscal transplantation, there is still a significant (p=0,0006) increase in osteoarthritis. An increase in osteoarthritis grade was seen in 42% of the patients, as scored following the Kellgren-Lawrence classification. When strictly respecting the indications, there is no significant correlation between preoperative cartilage damage, pre-operative osteoarthritis, alignment deviation, gender and body mass index on the one hand and outcome scores or improvement on the other hand. Conclusion: Meniscal allograft transplantation results in important pain relief and functional improvement in patients with a history of (sub)total meniscectomy and pain localized in the affected compartment. Strictly following the indications, meniscal transplantation can give good and predictable results. Introduction: Intramedullary nailing of the tibia has become the conventional therapy for tibial shaft fractures. One of the most common complaints associated with this procedure is chronic knee pain. Incidence rates between 10% and 86% have been reported and a significant number of patients have problems in kneeling, affecting professional and recreational activities. Surgical damage to the infrapatellar nerve is one possible causative factor for post-nailing knee pain. The infrapatellar nerve is exclusively sensory and runs subcutaneously almost perpendicular to the patellar tendon just below the patella. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of chronic knee pain in our institute and its relation with sensory disturbances in the knee area. Material and Methods: A chart review was conducted. All patients between 15 and 65 years with healed traumatic tibial shaft fractures treated with an intramedullary nail between 1998 and 2008 were included. Exclusion criteria were: fracture lines extending into the knee or ankle joint, any other fracture in the affected leg, lacerations in the knee area, pre-operatively existing knee pain and loss of follow-up. Chronic knee pain was defined as persisting pain in the knee area 6 months after tibial nailing. Sensory disturbances were defined as hyperesthesia or anesthesia at the nail entry site. Introduction: Femoral nailing causes an influx of fat in the circulation. In the multiply injured patient, especially in the patient with concomitant lung or brain contusion, this can lead to ARDS, fat embolism syndrome and multiple organ failure. The timing and kind of fixation of femoral fractures in patients with multiple injuries is controversially. The advantage of damage control orthopaedics (external fixation) would be less fat embolisation but some authors report more problems of infection and delayed healing. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of external fixation on healing and infection rates of femoral shaft fractures in the multiply injured patient.",

Introduction: The diagnostic information power of a level one emergency room has risen excessively within the last years. The need for quality control, judicial regulations, insurance claims and forensic reasons still lead to a high number of autopsies being performed in patients not surviving the first 48 h after admission to the ER. However, the number of autopsy clarification featured in a level one trauma centre after trauma related deaths considerably vary and also the rate of deathly diagnoses missed within ER assessment of early stage deceased patients differ in the literature. The aim of this study was to assess the value and necessity of autopsy after modern ER assessment with a multi-slice CT-scan as an integrated part of the diagnostic algorithm. Material and Methods: Prospectively reviewing our emergency database, case histories, laboratory values and radiological findings compared to findings in autopsy between Jan 2004 and Sep 2007, we charged for missed deathly diagnoses in 87 early stage deceased trauma patients (<48h). Patients were classified into two groups: group 1: patients with limited diagnostic assessment (conventional xray, sonography). Group 2: patients with full ER assessment (MSCT). All patients in group 1 could not be sufficiently stabilised in terms of circulation patterns and therefore did not receive full assessment. Non-trauma patients and patients reaching the ER under CPR were excluded. Results: The autopsy rate of all included patients was 86%. The overall incidence of missed deathly diagnoses was 9.2%. In terms of missed deathly diagnoses, groups varied significantly (group 1: 35.7%;group 2: 4.1%).The ISS after autopsy increased significantly in group 1 from 25 to 37.5. In group 2 there was no difference of ISS between status emergency room and after autopsy.",

Overall, our findings show that almost every tenth early stage deceased patient showed at least one missed potential deathly diagnose in a level one trauma centre. Regarding the insufficient assessment performance in group 1, the relative high rate of missed diagnoses seem explicable. Nevertheless, even having acquired full assessment power (group 2), still 4.1% deathly diagnoses were missed. For this reason, autopsy is still the most powerful and indispensable tool in finding the ''whole'' diagnosis. Completeness of autopsies after trauma related death therefore is essential referring a continuous gain of quality. Introduction: In a physiological environment metallic biomaterials undergo corrosion through a variety of mechanisms. This study investigated whether, beside the well recognized electrochemical aspect of corrosion, human osteoclasts are able to directly corrode titanium alloys, uptake and finally release corresponding metal ions into their environment. The released ions are believed to cause inflammatory reactions and activate osteoclastic differentiation and activity, which most likely play a role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of aseptic loosening [1] . Material and Methods: Human monocytes and in vitro generated osteoclasts were seeded onto titanium and aluminum (positive control) foils. After 21 days scanning electron microscopy analysis was performed in order to assess whether monocytes were able to grow and differentiate on the metals. In order to visualize uptake and distribution of intracellular metal ions, a novel protocol using confocal microscopy analyses with Newport GreenTM DCF Diacetate Ester staining was developed [2] . Additionally, the concentrations of metal ions released into the culture supernatant were measured using atomic emission spectrometry. ). Nine BRE-GFP mice were used. Mice were allowed unrestricted activity. A mini-external fixator fixed to the proximal and distal tibia was applied under general anesthesia on day 0. The animals were permitted full weight baring and unrestricted activity after awakening from anaesthesia. The GFP signal of tibia and fibula in bilateral limbs was measured on days 1, 3, 7, 10 and 14 after application of the external fixator.",

Introduction: The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of antibiotic loaded fresh-frozen allografts and compare it with antibiotic loaded acrylic bone cement in staphylococcal tibia osteomyelitis and to combine the effects of bone repair and eradication of infection in one stage surgery. Material and Methods: A unicortical 6.5-mm-diameter defect was created in the proximal tibial metaphysis of thirty-six New Zeland albino rabbits. After contamining the wounds with 2x10 8 colony forming units of staphylococcus aureus, we divided the animals into four groups. The negative control group received no treatment, the positive control group received teicoplanin-impregnated polymethylmethacrylate beads, the allograft group received fresh-frozen allografts and the experimental group received teicoplanin-impregnated fresh-frozen allografts. Histopathological evaluation with light microscope were made and intraosseous tissue cultures were performed on postoperative day 28. Clinical evaluation in a daily-routine were made. Results: The cultures showed no evidence of intramedullary infection in the experimental or the positive control group in eight of the nine rabbits, but they were positive for staphylococcus aureus in one of the nine rabbits in the experimental group, one of the nine rabbits in the positive control group and all of the rabbits in the negative control and allograft groups. The experimental group and the positive control group has similar effects in eradication of the infection. Conclusion: Teicoplanin-impregnated allografts was effective in preventing intramedullary staphylococcus aureus infection in a staphylococcal tibia osteomyelitis model. This combination therapy could potentially eliminate the need for surgical removal of cement beads. Using an antibiotic-graft compound, eradication of pathogens and grafting of bony defects may be carried out in a one stage procedure. Introduction: We first report a case of an infection in humans by streptococcus pluranimalium, a new streptococcal species that has been isolated in the genital tract and tonsils of cattle, tonsils of a goat and a cat, and from the crop and the respiratory tract of canaries.

The frame removed and the patient was followed up as an outpatient. Six days after the removal of the frame, the patient turned up to the A&E department, systematically unwell, complaining for a swollen painful knee, and a discharging abscess in one of the proximal pin sites near by the joint line.Fluid samples from the abscess and the knee aspiration, obtained and revealed streptococcus pluranimalium in all samples.

Introduction: The proximal metaphyseal tibial fractures are difficult to treat due to their frequent association with tibial plateau fracture and due to their aspect, which is often comminuted and has a significant impact on the function of the knee. Surgery has to restore local anatomy and to allow early rehabilitation, meaning proper evaluation and stabilization of the fracture. Material and Methods: 24 cases, operated between 01.01.2005 -01.06.2007 (mean age 22-59 yrs) with proximal metaphyseal tibial fractures, were analysed. Pre-operative planning using CT scan was used. The fractures were complicated with compartment syndrome (4 cases) which needed additional fasciotomy.The fractures were stabilized with : plates and screws (16 cases) or external fixation (8 cases) depending on the soft tissue status. Bone graft was used in 2 cases. The patients were monitorised at 1,2,6,12 and 24 months postoperative, concerning: bone healing, restoring of the axis of the knee, joint mobility, septic complications.",

The frequency of the complications depended on the initial aspect of the fracture, initial stabilization, time from intial stabilization to final fixation. Conclusion: Results after surgery for tibial plateau fractures depend on the initial aspect of the fracture, but also on the results of surgery . The method proposed by the authors, which allows the suspension of the articular surphace, is valuable especially when the fracture is cominuted and has small fragments. The double plate fixation (medial and lateral) with single anterior incision is the best, effective and simple procedure in treatment of complex proximal tibial fractures (type V and VI of Schautzker classification).",

            "text": "Results: The incidence of the complications was influenced by the time between trauma and complete surgery. There were 4 cases of superficial infection and 1 case of deep infection, without needing implant removal. All the fractures healed, the interval proved to be longer when external fixation was first used. There were no systemic definitive complications after these trauma. Conclusion: Compartment syndrome is frequent after proximal metaphyseal tibial fractures and the incidence of this complication was significant in the group of patients we studied, and the outcome was good when the treatment was early and complete . The Compartment Syndrome influenced the local and general prognosis, due to the importance of microcirculation in healing after trauma. Results: A CT pulmonary angiogram illustrated a metallic density, which appeared to lie in the lumen of the main pulmonary artery just proximal to the pulmonary valve. Conclusion: In this case, the respiratory symptoms and signs were due to a metallic pulmonary embolus rather than fat or thrombus. Formal anticoagulation was initiated and the patient's clinical condition consistently improved without the need for cardiothoracic surgery, although this is described in the literature with retained catheter fragments. Eight months after the injury, the fracture has consolidated with the patient returning to work. toid is often necessary to obtain adequate exposure. As an alternative to this we promote the minimal invasive transdeltoid approach. Material and Methods: The operative technique of the minimal invasive transdeltoid approach is explained in a first section. This approach has the advantage of direct access to the fracture site with more opportunities for adequate reduction and good plate placement without extensive distraction of the muscles. An important step in the procedure is the palpation of the axillary nerve. In a second section the results of a prospective cohort of the first 14 patients treated with this technique will be presented. The Neer criteria were used as guidelines for operative treatment. Fractures were classified according to the AO-classification. The ASES shoulder score was used to evaluate functional outcomes. Preoperative xrays were used to evaluate displacement, vascularity of the humeral head (according to the Hertel criteria) and AO fracture type. Postoperative X-rays were analyzed for quality of reduction of the CCD angle, reconstruction of the medial hinge and reposition of the tuberosities. Follow-up X-rays were evaluated for healing, avascular necrosis, loss of reduction and implant related failures of osteosynthesis. The 67-year-old male patient was taken to hospital after a traffic accident. He was a pedestrian hit by a car. He suffered comminuted proximal humeral fracture on the dominant right side. The fracture was closed. The glenoid cavity was damaged and acromion was broken. The fractures of the V-VI th ribs were found without complication. Otherwise the patient's condition was good. He had only a controlled hypertension. For preoperative planning CT scan was performed. As pieces of the humeral metaphysis wedged into the glenoid cavity insertion of glenoid component seemed uncertain. An early shoulder replacement was done on the 7 th day. The denudated fragments were removed. The tubercles with the muscle attachments were preserved. As a long bone defect remained in the metaphyseal zone normal stem would have been insufficient. A 220 cm long stem used in tumor cases was implanted. The length of the arm and size of the humeral head were compared to the intact side. The tubercles were attached to the prosthesis by non absorbable sutures. After the operation long bone defect remained which was filled up by heterotopic bone visible on X-ray. The postoperative period was complication free. Fever, severe pain, hematoma did not occur. The arm was in rest for 6 weeks, only controlled pendulum exercises were done from the second week. Active physiotherapy was started on the 7 th week. After 5 months the patient finished the follow up treatment. He was pain free and self-sufficient. Conclusion: For three-or four-part displaced fractures in which replacement is indicated, hemiarthroplasty with tuberosity reattachment remains the reference treatment/1,2/. In trauma cases short prosthesis stem is usually sufficient but in comminuted fractures involving the metaphyseal zone long stem has to be used for certain bone-prosthesis contact. Introduction: There is a trend to apply plate and screw fixation directly medial and lateral (so-called parallel plating), and many implants designed specifically for the distal humerus extend more laterally to improve fixation. This may risk injury to the origins of the common extensor and flexion musculature and the collateral ligaments either via operative dissection or by damage to the blood supply. Internal plate and screw fixation is often accomplished with subperiosteal elevation of muscle attachments and tight apposition of the plate to the bone, but this should not be done over the epicondyles. Plates applied to the medial and lateral aspects of the lateral and medial epicondyles should be placed directly over the soft tissues without elevating or disturbing them. Damage to the collateral ligaments could cause elbow instability. Material and Methods: In order to emphasize these important technical aspects, we report three patients in whom detachment of the origins of the lateral collateral ligament and common extensor muscle origins from the lateral epicondyle led to post-operative instability after open reduction and internal fixation of a fracture of the distal humerus.",

            "text": "Results: While the cases are very complex and the exact cause of elbow instability by necessity somewhat speculative, our concern is that the operative dissection performed to apply implants to the lateral side of the elbow contributed to the ulnohumeral instability. Injury to the LCL is the most common cause of recurrent elbow dislocation. Attempts to place a direct lateral implant directly on the bone by elevating soft tissues will put the origin of the LCL at risk. It is preferable to place implants directly over the soft tissues, although there is a risk of interfering with blood supply leading to soft tissue insufficiency. It seems safe to assume that the operative treatment contributed in some way to the instability in each patient. Patient one in particular had osteoporotic bone noted intraoperatively, so that one would expect failure to occur through bone with any subsequent trauma. The failure through the ligamentous structures seems to implicate the operative technique.",

            "text": "Introduction: ORIF of comminuted distal humerus fractures carries a high risk of complications such as secondray loss of reduction, pseudarthrosis and heterotopic ossifications. Especially elderly patients with osteoporotic bone quality are struck by these complications. Therefore total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) is gaining more and more in importance as it has proven to achieve good results in elderly patients with poor bone quality. The Latitude total elbow system (Tornier Inc., Stafford, USA) is a modular, convertible implant that allows not only linked and unlinked TEA with or without radial head replacement but also hemiarthroplasty. The aim of this system is to reproduce the patient's anatomy to reconstitue the elbow's physiologic kinematics. Therefore the Latitude prosthesis is offered in four different sizes, respecting the flexion-extension axis and three different humeral offsets based on anatomical findings. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the short-term results after elbow arthroplasty with the Latitude system. Introduction: It is not always possible to reconstruct complex radial head fractures. As non-anatomical reconstruction and healing disturbances result is loss of motion and severe post-traumatic arthritis of the elbow joint, radial head resection as been proposed for these cases. Other authors propose radial head arthroplasty as an alternative to radial head resection to avoid the complications of radial head resection. Different concepts of radial head prostheses are available: silicon prosthesis, monopolar prosthesis (loose fit and cemented/thight fit) and bipolar prostheses. Evidence is lacking on the exact place for arthroplasty as opposed to radial head resection. To answer this question we performed a systematic review of litterature. Material and Methods: Inclusion criteria are clinical studies reporting on radial head resection or radial head arthroplasty, published between 1995 and today in english, french, german or dutch language. A search has been performed using the Pubmed and Embase databank. A secondary search has been performed based upon the reference list of the included publications. Exclusion criteria are: \u00e2 e\u00a2cadaver or animal studies \u00e2 e\u00a2biomechanic studies \u00e2 e\u00a2clinical studies with a follow up of less than 2 years \u00e2 e\u00a2clinical studies with less than 10 patients Data extraction \u00e2 e\u00a2elbow function \u00e2 e\u00a2complication rate \u00e2 e\u00a2arthritis rate Data are reported according to the MOOSE guidelines. Results: Only low evidence studies are available. We did not find any randomised controlled trial comparing resection to radial head arthroplasty. There is evidence that radial head resection results in high complication rates (including arthritis) and poor function in case of elbow instability and/or Essex-Lopresti lesions. The rate of complications in these indications is higher than for radial head arthroplasty. In cases without instability or Essex-Lopresti lesion there is a trend to better function in radial head resection. Complication rate is higher in the prosthesis patients. The rate of post-traumatic arthritis is not significantly differing between the resection and the arthroplasty group, and remains very high (+/_ 70%).",

The work conditions were well in all cases, the saws were placed firmly on the ground and the lighting was sufficient. Most injuries appeared on the week-end (Friday n = 9, Saturday n = 8). A break or a meal, taken shortly before the accident, had no influence on the injury risk. All patients had a several years lasting experience in dealing with buzzsaws, half of the patients even for at least 20 years. The safety device of the saw was folded back in most cases (n = 25), only few patients (n = 15) had correctly put on the saw safety device at the accident time, 4 patients provided moreover no information. The accident had entered in 12 cases shortly before working end, mostly with the last cut. In 10 cases a wooden piece had become stuck in the saw and the patient had tried to solve it. Conclusion: A many years' routine in dealing with buzzsaws can lead to the fact that necessary safeguarding measures are not followed any more and so cause an increased injury risk. In particular shortly before working end the attention decreases and the injury risk rises. An especially injury-laden situation is becoming stuck of wooden parts in the saw. The attempt to solve these parts without switching off the saw before bears a high injury risk. The patients showed predominantly heavy injuries.

The distribution of fractured toes was: first 38%, second 11%, third 7%, fourth 14%, and fifth 30%. Multiple digital fractures were seen in 5.9%. Most fractures were caused by stubbing the toe or a crush injury (75.6%). More than 95% of the fractures were undisplaced or minimally displaced and most fracture patterns were transverse or oblique/spiral. A total of 141 patients (53%) returned the questionnaire with a median follow-up of 27 months. Responders were female in 57.4% and had a median age of 45 years (P25-P75 31-58). In 46.8% of cases the left side was affected. The median AOFAS-score was 100 points (P25-P75 93-100), the median VAS was 10 points (P25-P75 8-10). No correlations were identified with outcome and which toe or phalangeal bone was affected, number of fractured toes, fracture type and location, articular involvement, gender, age, body mass index, smoking habits, and diabetes.

In the operation appendix was normal,so meckel's diverticula researched and diverticulitis was seen at 100th cm from ileocecal valve.Wedge resection for diverticulitis and appendectomy for appendix were performed.In microscopic pathologic examination appendix was normal, and meckel's diverticulitis was seen. Conclusion: Meckel's diverticula is the most congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal anomalies and it was found 2% in autopsy ser-ies. (1) .It is asymptomatic generally. Risk of complication is 4-6%(2). Preoperative diagnosis may not be done frequently, so to delay of operation may be serious complication.(3)In our clinic, we explore meckel's diverticula, over(in female) and duodenum, if we do not see p\u00fc r\u00fc lant material on the appendix. Results: Patients with abdominal TB were diagnosed by laparoscopy and peritoneal biopsy in 9 cases and by laparotomy in 2 cases. From these 11 patients we observed peritoneal TB in 8 cases, intestinal TB in 2 cases, mesenteric lymph nodes TB in 1 case. At admission 5 patients presented complications: 2 cases with perforations and peritonitis, 1 case with intestinal obstruction and 2 cases presented as ileo-cecal ''tumors'' (solved by right colectomy); other surgical procedure performed was enterectomy with either entero-entero-anastomosis, either ileo-colic anastomosis. In abdominal tuberculosis ascites was present in 8 cases. Other common findings were weight loss (6 cases), weakness (4 cases), abdominal pain (10 cases), anorexia (8 cases) and night sweat (2 cases). Only 2 patients had chest radiography suggestive of a new TB lesion. In those patients with peritoneal tuberculosis subjected to operation, the findings were multiple diffuse involvements of the visceral and parietal peritoneum, white ''miliary nodules'' or plaques, enlarged lymph nodes, ascites, ''violin string'' fibrinous strands, and omental thickening. Biopsy specimens revealed granulomas, while ascitic fluid showed numerous lymphocytes. Postoperative management was applied by the TB Medical System. All patients were treated for 6 months by specific drug therapy, with favorable evolution. PCR of ascitic fluid was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) in all cases. Introduction: Abdominal trauma represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Conservative management is preferred in blunt trauma with hemodynamic stability although there is a risk of intestinal damage when free fluid without solid organ injury is found in image studies. Early laparotomy may be unnecessary in most cases but a delay in diagnosis of bowel perforation could lead to increased rate of complications. On the other hand the presence of a penetrating abdominal trauma is considered an absolute indication of laparotomy. We present five cases of abdominal trauma treated in our department in which laparoscopy proved to be an optimal diagnostic and therapeutic tool. Material and Methods: Chart review of our cases and literature review Results: Three cases of blunt abdominal trauma underwent laparoscopy. We found a small bowel perforation in one case that was repaired by externalization of the jejuna loop by one of the ports. In the other two cases we found intestinal and mesenteric contusions that were treated by peritoneal drainage. Two cases of penetrating trauma underwent laparoscopy. One of them presented omentum evisceration with no other injuries and the second presented a gastric perforation that needed reconversion to laparotomy. Conclusion: In our experience and according to literature, laparoscopy should be taken into account as a diagnostic procedure in blunt abdominal trauma in stable children with abnormal abdominal examination and moderate free fluid and no solid organ injury in image studies, and it could be a first and sometimes definitive approach to minimal penetrating abdominal trauma. 3%) patients, biliary tract injury in 3 (13.04%) patients, multiple stones in the abdomen due to perforation in 2 (8.6%) patients, inadequate technical equipment in 2 (8.6%) patients, liver injury in 1 (4.3%) patient, intraoperatively detected umbilical hernia in 1 (4.3%) patient, uncontrollable bleeding in trocar entry site in 1 (4.3%) patient, insufficient insufflation in 1 (4.3%) patient, and unstoppable bleeding of arteria cystica in 1 (4.3%) patient, respectively. Conclusion: Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the golden standard of treatment in cholecystectomy, it involves the risk of conversion to open surgery. The rate of conversion to open surgery has been reported to be between 2-20% in many series and is considered to be 5% on average. In our study, we found it as 6.2%, a rate which is close to the rate reported in the literature. Chief reasons for conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy include the difficult dissection of Callot's triangle due to obscured anatomy and adhesions, gallbladder perforation, bleeding, the failure to produce pneumoperitoneum, gallbladder cancer, and injury in main biliary tracts and neighboring organs. The presence of pericholecystic adhesion and liquid in acute cholecytitis cases and the presence of edema in the tissue affect regional anatomy and complicate dissection, which increases the risk of gallbladder perforation. In our study, changes due to acute cholecytitis and difficulties in the preparation of Callot's triangle ranked first among the indications for open cholecystectomy with a rate of 47.8% (11/23 Introduction: The most difficult decision in the management of the patients with severe necrotizing pancreatitis is whether surgery is required and which of the complementary approaches to necrosectomy and drainage is appropriate. Recently a great deal of data has emerged suggesting that a pulsating irrigation stream delivered at high pressure and with a high flow effectively decreases bacteria, foreign bodies, and necrotic crushed tissue in wounds and decreases the incidence of resultant wound infection. This study evaluates the effect of Inter pulse jet irrigation, used for the first time in open abdominal surgery. Material and Methods: Twelve patients presenting proven infected/ non-infected pancreatic necrosis during course of acute pancreatitis and not responding to radiological or laparoscopic drainage were prospectively offered necrosectomy using itner pulse jet irrigation. Open necrosectomy and subsequent jet irrigation were performed using a midline laparotomy. In all patients, 1 to 3 tube drainages were placed during necrosectomy for continuous closed lavage. Temporary abdominal closure using modified mesh-foil laparostomy was applied for relief of abdominal compartment syndrome.",

Introduction: Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), have been described often in patients with abdominal trauma or after emergency abdominal surgical operations. We present 3 patients with vomiting, meteorism, acute abdomen and acute respiratory insufficiency provoked by phytobezoars. Aetiopathogenesis, symptoms and differential diagnosis are analyzed and a brief report of the literature is discussed. Material and Methods: Three patients, were admitted to the emergency department of our hospital during the last year. All patients were presented with acute respiratory failure, abdominal pain, discomfort, meteorism and vomiting. The first patient, a 57 years old man, alcoholic was admitted with meteorism, acute abdominal pain and discomfort. A 26 Fr nasogastric tube was introduced and the symptoms were remitted after gastric evacuation. The second patient suffered from bowel obstruction after closure of colostomy as a result of traumatic injury of sigmoid colon. A laparotomy was performed and a phytobezoar was revealed at the level of anastomosis. The last patient was presented with meteorism, vomiting and dyspepsia, as a result of enlarged gastric mass, revealed after endoscopy.",

Mini laparotomy and gastrotomy in the third patient (after two unsuccessful gastroscopies) revealed large phytobezoars. Introduction: The objective was the substantiation of using DCS tactics in wounded with CTMI. Material and Methods: In case of cranial injuries DCS tactics implied treating superficial wounds of skin, arrest of exterior bleeding and subsequent evacuation of the wounded within the first hours after getting trauma. In case of extremity injuries, DCS tactics implied first of all the operations on the occasion of gunshot injuries, including the arrest of bleeding, application of the external fixation apparatuses, application of temporary shunts for injured vessels. The burn wounds treating were carried out after helping the patient out of shock. In case of the wounded with chest injury in the presence of hemo-and pneumothorax, drainage of pleural cavity of silicone tubes with active air aspiration was fulfilled. In case of abdomen injuries after laparotomy abdominal cavity was cleaned and inspected including examination of the most probable sources of bleeding: liver, spleen, magistral vessels. On the background of unstable hemodynamics the abdominal cavity tamponage along the right and left side canals, supraliver and underliver space and small pelvis. Results: Thus, in accordance with DCS principles in case of CTMI, operations regarding gunshot injuries were made in the first turn, and operations connected with burns -in the second turn. The first were urgent operations. Then, intensive therapy in the conditions of resuscitation unit. Conclusion: The repeated operation of the second stage -final removal of lesions -was carried out after the condition of the wounded had been stabilized. Introduction: The AA highlight the importance of the damage control philosophy in difficult emergency surgery situations like the perforation of an oesophagojejunal anastomosis by an oesophagojejunal tube. Material and Methods: Man, age 78, 3 rd pod after total gastrectomy with precolic reconstruction for gastric cancer (T2N2MxR0) in another institution. No significant past diseases. Mechanically ventilated, in septic shock, with purulent drainage from right hemithorax and blue drainage from right abdominal upper quadrant, after ''methilene blue'' swallow. Distended abdomen.

During the operation the relatively constant venous anastomosis between the middle colic vein and the inferior pancreaticoduodenal vein close to the lower border of the pancreas was injured, resulting in excessive haemorrhage. In the effort to manage the bleeding, the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) was torn, and after multiple unsuccessful efforts to repair the vein, we finally had to ligate the SMV. The operation was completed by typical right hemicolectomy and the abdomen was closed. Five hours later the patient showed acute distention of the abdomen together with respiratory distress. Due to increased abdominal pressure (> 35 cm H 2 O), the patient was taken back to the OR. The small bowel was edematous, bluish but viable.",

The routine principles of vascular surgery were applied to the management of these visceral blood vessels injuries :adequate exposure, proximal and distal control, d\u00e9 bridement of the vessel wall,meticulous arteriorraphy and venorraphy with fine monofilament vascular sutures and early instituition of damage control resulting a successfull repair.",

            "text": "Material and Methods: The authors made a review of several large series in the literature wich are also consistent with a low incidence of visceral vessel injuries. Vascular trauma is complex and ideally is carried out by experts in a multidisciplinary environment A broad spectrum of surgical specialities are involved in the ressuscitative phase of trauma care including general, trauma, thoracic and vascular surgery . Despite a relatively low incidence of vascular trauma in Portugal, the results are satisfactory because of active and early management by surgeons on call, weather with vascular training or not, treating all kinds of vascular surgical emergencies. A trauma and emergency surgical speciality is a challenge. Results: Little information describing the first repair or ligation of any visceral vessel injuries can be found in the literature. Visceral vascular injuries carry a significant mortality rate. Vascular injury poses a small but significant challenge in Portugal trauma care. Opportunities such as better practise guidelines and minimum standars will allow surgeons to improve delivery of quality care to the next generation of vascular trauma victims. Training in the management of vascular trauma surgery with integration of vascular and general surgeryin trauma care should optimize outcomes. Conclusion: From reviews of large series dealing with the management of abdominal vascular injuries, the incidence can be estimated to be between 0.01% to 0.1 %of all vascular injuries. Few data are available describing the mortality rate for patients with portal veins injuries. Te author's vision is that all vascular and general surgery trainees would eventually undertake the Definitive Surgical Trauma Care Course and improve outcomes and reduce mortality.",

            "text": "Conclusion: A TAWH after blunt trauma is a rare entity. The reported incidence of acute hernia ranges from 02,%-3,6% 1 . In our case the TAWH was already diagnosed in the trauma room. Mahajna et al. 2 reported the case of herniation of the right colon with vessel strangulation, which wasn't seen in the primary survey. A right hemicolectomy had to be performed on the 2 nd posttraumatic day. In our case we decided intraoperatively to perform a primary reconstruction of the abdominal wall without mesh repair. The potential advantage of a mesh implantation lies in the augmentation of the abdominal wall, thereby potentially lowering the risk of incisional hernia. However, the benefits of such augmentation should be cautiously weighed against the risk of foreign body contamination when resecting bowel during the same operation. Introduction: Impalement is an uncommon and spectacular injury, which combines aspects of both blunt and penetrating trauma. Impalement injuries from falls are rarely seen, because most of the patients die at the scene of injury. We present an unusual case in which a patient survived a perineal impalement after a fall.With reference to our latest case and discuss the initial management and the operative treatment of this rare injury according to a literature review.",

            "text": "Material and Methods: A young man was working on a construction site when he suddenly lost his footing and fell 7 m off a scaffold. He orientated such that he landed in a sitting position on a vertical aluminium u-tube, which penetrated his perineal region and stucked. Upon arrival at the emergency room he was in stable condition, intubated. After the initial treatment and diagnosis according to ATLS a CT of the abdomen was performed; it showed a penetrating tube perianal left, from caudal into the cavity of the pelvis, the point of the tube stucked in the sacrum -in the hole of neuroforamina S1. There was no intraabdominal or laceration. The patient was taken to the operating room in stable condition. The laparotomy was performed. There was no laceration detected, explorating the praesacral cavity brought out a profuse bleeding of the main pelvic vein. After the active bleeding was stopped the tube was removed from the outside. After lavage and positioning of drains, a protective loopileostoma was placed to avoid further contamination. The perineal wound was carefully debrided, drains were inserted and the wound was not completely closed by adapting stitches. A wash-out of the colon was performed, he received antibiotics and the perineal wound was rinsed daily. He was dismissed 18 days post-trauma. Results: Impalement injuries result when a solid object pierces a body cavity or extremity. The object often remains fixed within the body. This case report showed a positive outcome. Impalement injuries are impressive but also rare, so it is important to show an algorithm in management of such injuries. The object should be in situ during transport. In large or immoveable objects, the impaling device should be cut just above the skin. The management of the injuries depend on the particular body region of penetrating. Perineal impalement often appear quite complex. These injuries may need the assistance of gynecology and urology surgery Praesacral drainage and distal rectal washout is recommended. Wound care is essential in the care of impalement injuries. The skin should generally left open. Even uncomplicated wounds have to be treated with antibiotics. Conclusion: Impalement injuries are rare and treating is a challenge for the surgeon. The degree of the injury determines the functional result. Strict adherence to the transportation and management principles outlined in this paper are necessary to decrease morbidity and mortility Disclosure: No significant relationships. Introduction: The insertion of foreign objects into the anus and rectum is a well-known phenomenon. Rectal foreign bodies can present a difficult diagnostic and management dilemma. . A foreign body may be inserted by a doctor for diagnosis or treatment like rectal thermometer, enema tubes or anal packs, by the patient for self eroticism or by a third party as a result of assault or sexual activity, but the most common cause for insertion of a foreign body is sexual stimulation. 1,2,3 . Anorectal foreign bodies are more common in men than in women . They can be caused by a wide variety of objects, lead to variable degrees of local trauma to the surrounding tissues, rectal bleeding and can be associated with perforation or delayed injury. Material and Methods: In this study, In the ten years from 1999 to 2009, we used the medical records of 7 patients with foreign bodies in the rectum have been diagnosed and treated,at Izmir Teaching and Research Hospital,Izmir. Results: All patients were men.They ranged in age from 33 to 68 (mean age 48).Two of these 7 patients had impulse body spray, two patients had bottle, one patient had eggplant,one patient had brush and one patient had wishbone (after oral ingestion) in the rectum. Five objects were removal transanally extracted by anal dilatation under general anesthesia.Two patients required laparotomy.One patient of these the object was high lying in the rectosigmoid and performed laparotomy.The object was removal transanally extracted by abdominal manuplation.One patient had a intraperitoneal rectosigmoidal perforation.The perforation was treated by primer suture, proximal colostomy and appropriate antibiotic therapy. Routine rectosigmoidoscopic examination is performed after removal.One patient had perforation of the rectosigmoid and 4 had lacerations of the mucosa. No patient had a mortality. Conclusion: Foreign bodies in rectum should be managed in a wellorganized manner. The diagnosis is confirmed by means of plain abdominal radiographs and rectal examination. Manual extraction without anaesthesia is usually only possible for very low lying objects. Patients with high lying foreign bodies generally require general anaesthesia to achieve complete relaxation of the anal sphincters to facilitate extraction.Open surgery should be reserved only for those patients with perforation, peritonitis and impaction of the foreign body.",

Conclusion: Retroperitoneal and ''well protected'' location implies that a high energy traumatism is needed to injury the pancreas. The fact that in this case a non-classical injury mechanism has occurred, makes the diagnosis more difficult to reach. Pancreatic pseudocyst is the most frequent complications in this type of traumatisms. ",

Results: 2573 patients were studied (86.6% males) having a mean age of 31.4 years. 50% of patients were from the Indian subcontinent and 18% were UAE nationals. 99% of patients presented immediately following injury. Ambulances brought only 34% of the patients. 40% of trauma took place in the street or highway, 29% in work places and 20% at home. The mechanisms of injury were road traffic collision in 41% and falls in 34%. 45% of injuries were to extremities, 27% to head, face and neck, and 12% to chest. The mean ISS was 5.6. The mean (range) hospital stay was 9.2 (1-150) days; 202(8%) patients needed ICU admission of whom 28 (13.9%) died. The Mean ICU stay was 5.8 days (range 1-35). Overall mortality was 56 (2.2%). Conclusion: Road traffic collisions and falls are the main cause of trauma admissions in Al Ain city. Extremities, head, neck, face and chest are the main body regions sustaining injuries.

Postoperative complications were noticed at 14 (6,48%) people. We had postoperative mortality at four (1,85%) patients. Recidive ulcer was registred at 10 (4,63%) patients who were surgically treated for perfored ulcer before. Conclusion: Ulcer perforation is an acute complication of the ulcer disease that appears most frequently after bleeding and which usually requires surgical treatment. References: 1.

Material and Methods: Highlights of interest were: effect of the age location of the fracture soft-tissue damage other injuries/ISS antibiotic prophylaxis operative treatment massive transfusion of blood outcome. Results: In the Trauma Center Murnau we treated between 1/2002 and 12/2005 926 patients with multiple trauma. 63 (6,45%) suffered from open fractures of at least one long bone. Finally, the study showed that 62% (n = 39) had a good outcome without infection oder pseudarthrosis. 3% (n = 2) developed an early infection, 6% (n = 4) an osteitis. The femur and the radius were the most frequent site of an open fracture, but 83% of the observed osteitis occurred in the tibia. 14% (n = 2) of the patients with a Gustilo grade II and 22% (n = 4) with a grade III developed osteitis. 67% (n = 4) of the patients developing an infection received a massive transfusion of blood ( \u2021 10 EK). We found no difference between the patients with infection and those without infection with regard to age, other injuries/ISS or kind of medical treatment. Conclusion: Massive transfusion of blood predisposes to bone infection in patients with multiple trauma and open long bone fracture especially of the tibia. Disclosure: No significant relationships.

In this context, the Portuguese Medical Association (OM) has created, in 2003, the Competence College on Emergency Medicine (CCEM). Just as important, the Portuguese Society of Surgery (SPC) brought, in 1999, the ATLS (Advanced Trauma Life Support) Course of the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and managed to run, since then, about 140 courses in nine different centres for more than 2200 doctors. The surgeons interest in this area had also expression through thematic societies such as the Portuguese Trauma Society (SPT), the Trauma Group (GT) of Hospital de S\u00e3 o Jo\u00e3 o and the Lusitanian Association for Trauma and Emergency Surgery (ALTEC), affiliated to the European Society for Trauma and Emergency Surgery (ESTES). Regarding trauma surgery and the surgical decision making, the GT had a pioneering role, in 2003, through a protocol with the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS), importing the Definitive Surgical Trauma Care (DSTC) Course of the International Association for Trauma Surgery and Intensive Care (IATSIC). Material and Methods: A memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed between this entity and OM on 2008, to the creation of a National Steering Committee (NSC) for the development of the DSTC in Portugal, in cooperation with the existent trauma societies, all represented in the OM Working Group for Emergency Surgery (GTFCE).",

Especially 3D-C-arms connected with navigation systems are being used more often and can be utilized intraoperatively for planning as well as controlling of screw positions. This study analyses our experiences with 3D-based navigation in the posterior cervical and high thoracic spine. Material and Methods: A 3D-C-Arm (Vision Vario 3D, Ziehm) was connected with a navigation system (Vector vision, Brainlab) and since 10/2007 used for the placement of overall 350 Screws at 51 Patients. Of those 9 Patients had to undergo operations in the posterior cervical spine, of 53 screws Judet-(n = 8), Massa lateralis-(n = 27) and pediclescrews (n = 18) were placed. Indications for instrumentation were traumatic fractures (n = 3), spondylodiscitis (n = 1), multiple metastases with high-grade instability (n = 4), and degenerative rheumatic stenosis of the spinal canal (n = 1). Concerning the high thoracic spine (T1-10) 42 interventions were made with the method, 297 pediclescrews were implanted. Indications in this area were traumatic fractures (n = 24), metastases (n = 14) and spondylodiscites (n = 4). Results: Scan-time intraoperatively took 60 seconds on average, datatransfer to the navigation-system another 10 seconds. Applicationtime including anti-collision-check needs approx. 6 minutes[5;18]. In total 260/350 (74%) screws could be inserted assisted with navigation, 194/350 (55%) were controlled intraoperatively.

These fractures are often treated with bed rest but may results in a disabling immobility with server pain. An operative treatment is indicated in fractures with instability and dislocation. The aim of the operative treatment is bony healing obtained by stable fixation giving back to the patient his previous mobility. Optimal surgical treatment is still under debate, when complete transforaminal or lateral fractures of the sacrum are present. Most commonly sacroiliac screws are used. Only low compression in the fracture site is obtained due to low density of spongious bone in which the screws are inserted. Therefore the new transsacral bar compression osteosynthesis is used. The purpose of this study is to report of our first cases. Material and Methods: From 2005 to 2008 5 patients (3 F and 2 M) were treated with a trans-sacral bar and followed prospectively. The patient is placed in prone position on the operation table. Under image intensifier control, a 5 mm threaded sacral bar is inserted trough the body of S1 from the left to the right dorsal ilium. Nuts are placed over the bar achieving fracture compression. When anterior pelvic instability is present, an anterior osteosynthesis is also performed. Results: The mean age of the patients was 70 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 18 months. No intra-and postoperative complications were found. At the time of the last evaluation all but one fracture had united. In one case only a partial union could be achieved. Instability significantly improved and pain diminished in all patients with bony healing. Conclusion: Using a trans-sacral bar for stabilisation of the dorsal pelvic ring in fatigue fractures is a promising method. Only with this method, a high interfragmentary compression is achieved, which is not dependent on the quality of the spongious bone of the sacral body.

In contrast to the rigid implants, dynamic implants should influence the mobility of the adjacent level segments fewer and should contribute therefore to a protection of adjacent degeneration. The goal of the existing study is the evaluation of the mobility change of the adjacent segments after implantation of different interspinous spacers and a fixateur interne under load conditions in all three plains of motion. At the same time spacers are examined, which clearly differ regarding its implantation from percutaneous procedure to open implantation. Material and Methods: 13 fresh humane cadaver lumbar spinal columns (L2-L5) were examined. The multisegmental motion behavior was tested in the spine tester under pure moments (7.5Nm) with and without load (follower load 400 N) in all three movement plains.

We tested the hypothesis that three-dimensional computed tomography reconstructions improve the reliability of tibial plateau fracture characterization and classification. Material and Methods: Forty-five consecutive intra-articular fractures of the tibial plateau were evaluated by six independent observers for the presence of six fracture characteristics that are not specifically included in currently used classification schemes: (1) posteromedial shear fracture; (2) coronal plane fracture; (3) lateral condylar impaction; (4) medial condylar impaction; (5) tibial spine involvement; (6) separation of tibial tubercle necessitating anteroposterior lag screw fixation. In addition, fractures were classified according to the AO/OTA Comprehensive Classification of Fractures, the Schatzker classification system and the Hohl and Moore system. Two rounds of evaluation were performed and then compared. First, a combination of plain radiographs and two-dimensional computed tomography scans (2D) were evaluated, and then, four weeks later, a combination of radiographs, two-dimensional computed tomography scans, and three-dimensional reconstructions of computed tomography scans (3D) were assessed. Results: Interobserver agreement improved for all classification systems after the addition of three-dimensional reconstructions (AO/ OTA j 2D = 0.536 versus j 3D = 0.545; Schatzker j 2D = 0.545 versus j 3D = 0.596; Hohl and Moore j 2D = 0.668 versus j 3D = 0.746).",

RESEARCH T046 Androstenediol Modulates the Systemic Chemokines Expression in a Combined Trauma-Hemorrhage/CLP Mouse Model Introduction: The early overwhelming pro-inflammatory immune responses as well as the subsequent immunodepression are thought to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of posttraumatic multiple-organ-dysfunction-syndrome (MODS) and sepsis. Chemokines are known to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of these complications by recruiting immune competent cells. Sex steroids have been shown to beneficially modulate the posttraumatic immune response. The precursor Androstendiol resulted in a reduction of posttraumatic mortality in different experimental trauma models. However, the exact mechanism by which Androstendiol exerts its beneficial effects remains unknown. We therefore investigated, whether the application of Androstendiol has a effect on plasma chemokine levels in a combined trauma-hemorrhage (T-H)/CLP mouse model. Material and Methods: T-H was induced by orbital puncture in C57BL/6 mice. 1 hour after induction of T-H animals were resuscitated with 4x the shed blood volume of Ringers solution. Sepsis was induced 48 hours later by coelical ligation and puncture (CLP). Four hours after CLP the animals were exsanguinated by cardiac puncture.From day 1 to day 3 Androstendiol (1 mg/kg body weight) was applied daily (n = 10), whereas the control group was treated with vehicle only (n = 10). Animals of the sham group were treated with vehicle or Androstendiol over a period of three days without further interventions (n = 10). Measurement of plasma MCP-1, MCP-3 and MIP-1beta was performed by FACS analysis (Flowxytomix, Bend-erMed Systems). Statistical differences were detected by ANOVA on ranks and t-tests.Results: T-H and CLP induction resulted in a significant increase of MCP-1, MCP-3 and MIP-1beta plasma levels. Application of Androstendiol led to significantly lower MCP-1, MCP-3 and MIP-1beta levels compared to vehicle-treated animals after T-H/CLP (p Conclusion: Androstenediol can considerably modulate the immune reaction induced after trauma-hemorrhage and a septic insult by reducing the systemic levels of chemokines, which are known to direct immune cells into the tissue and hereby possibly leading to organ damage. Consequently, Androstendiol could represent a potential therapeutic agent. Further studies are needed to elucidate the beneficial mechanisms of Androstendiol on the immune response after trauma.

Vijfhuize, T. S. C. Jakma, P. W. Plaisier, R. J. Oostenbroek, B. J. Punt Surgery, Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Dordrecht, The Netherlands Introduction: With 15.000 hipfractures a year, hipsurgery frames a significant part of the dutch daily surgical practice. Nowadays, the percentage of fractures operated within 24 hours is a valid performance indicator. Without wanting to devalue the importance of timing of surgery, the ultimate results appear evenly significant in this vulnerable group of patients. To sample the quality of our personal interventions, a retrospective study with regard to number of reinterventions and survival within 1 year was performed. Material and Methods: All operated hipfractures from January 2003-2007 were included. This group was split up into 5 subgroups, depending on choice of implant: hemi hip prosthesis (HHP), cannulated hip screws (CHS), dynamic hip screw (DHS), gammanail (GN) and proximal femur nail (PFN). The number of reinterventions in theater was counted, varying from purging a hematoma to remove or replace a previous implant. In addition, the number of deaths within one year after the initial surgery was numbered. Results: Altogether, 952 hipsurgeries were performed. Respectively 312 Hemi Hip Prosthesis, 99 Cannulated Hip Screws, 224 Dynamic Hip Screws, 158 Gamma Nails and 159 Proximal Femur Nails were implanted. The total number of re-interventions amounted 77 (8%) and in the subgroups consecutively: 9(3%), 24(24%),18(8%), 10(6%) and 16(10%) within one year. The one-year-mortality overall was 21%(202 patients) and in the subgroups consecutively: 21%(65), 6%(6), 19%(43), 30%(48) and 25%(40).",

Can 1 1 Trauma Surgery, City Hospital Triemli, Zurich, Switzerland, 2 Trauma Division, Dept of Surgery, Stadtspital Triemli, Z\u00fc rich, Switzerland Introduction: Introduction: Continuously increasing life expectancy and rising number of prosthetic joint replacements are responsible for the fast growing number of periprosthetic fractures of the femur. Those fractures often occur in elderly patients with medical comorbidities. Only few studies have documented its associated morbidity and mortality. We analysed those parameters in our own small cohort of patients. Material and Methods: Methods: During the time period 2003 to October 2008 all data from patients treated for periprosthetic fractures of the femur were included into this single institution case series. We focused on the patients who underwent ORIF using locking plate technology (LCP, Synthes\u00c2 \u00d2). Data on periprosthetic fracture pattern,surgical procedure, type of arthroplasty, length of hospital stay and morbidity and demographics were collected. Mobility before and after hospital admission was asked during follow up examinations. Results: Results: Of all patients who sustained a periprosthetic femoral fracture during this time period (n = 42) we identified 19 (45.2%) who had been treated with open reduction and internal fixation by using tension bandage and LCP only. Those patients suffered from a fracture after hip hemi-or total \u00e2 e''arthroplasty. By using the Vancouver classification system 9 fractures were classified type B1, 4 were classified type B2, one type B3 and 5 type C were documented. The majority of patients (15, 79%) fell in their own environment. Age at the time of fracture was 83.1 years (59-95), 16 (84%) of the patients were female. No intraoperative complications occurred. Few postoperative complications needed treatment. 3 haematomas required surgical evacuation. In follow up we documented 3 implant failures due to a fracture of the implant. Two patients (10.5%) had deceased 12 and 24 months after operation unrelated to the operation. Conclusion: Conclusion: Despite the relative small case load, this quality control survey concludes the largest analysed group of periprosthetic proximal femoral fractures in Switzerland, as far as we are",

Third proximal humeral fractures are approximately about 5% of adults and elderly patients fractures, in which osteoporosis makes internal fixation problematic and frequently contributes to failed fixation and poor clinical results. Surgical management remains controversial, and there are different options for treatment, such as immobilization, minimal invasive surgeries, nails or anatomic plates. Material and Methods: We present a clinical and radiographic retrospective study of 47 fractures in 44 patients with third proximal humeral fracture treated with Trigen antegrade nail. There were 29 two part fractures (61.70%), 13 three parts fractures (27.65%) and 5 with shaft extension (10.64%). The mean age of patients was 64 years old (22-87). There were 73.3% females, and no difference between right or left arm, with three cases with bilateral fracture.Results: 42 patients showed excellent functional outcomes (good function to do their own personal activities and to start them early). All fractures except one healed in a mean period of 2,6 months. There was one pseudoarthrosis that needed a new intervention, one extraction because of discomfort and two screw extractions because of migration. No infection or avascular necrosis was found during follow up. The mean Constant score with the adjustment of age and gender didn't differ from results of other series. Conclusion: The correct reduction and nail technique lets patients start an early rehabilitation. This technique can make the patient have a quicker recuperation and enables them to do their own personal activities earlier.References: -Misra.

Exclusion criteria were pathological fractures and revision osteosynthesis. 368 patients met the inclusion criteria. Preoperative x-rays were used to evaluate displacement, vascularity of the humeral head (according to the Hertel criteria) and AO fracture type. Post-operative X-rays were analyzed for quality of reduction of the CCD angle, reconstruction of the medial hinge and reposition of the tuberosities. Follow-op X-rays were evaluated for healing, avascular necrosis, loss of reduction and implant related failures of osteosynthesis. The ASES",

Disclosure: Our work was funded as a research project under the domain of the Agency for Research at the Ministry of higher education, science and technology of Slovenia. Traumatic hip dislocation is a surgical emergency. Posttraumatic function probably depends on time until reduction and severity of fracture dislocation. Studies indicate that reduction should be done within 6 hours 1 to avoid arthritis and avascular necrosis. Causes of these complications may be: 1. An incongruent joint. 2. Lack of blood supply 3. Necrosis of the chondrocytes because of trauma. Chondrocytes are essential for regeneration of cartilage. 4. Apoptosis, an energy demanding preprogrammed process where the chondrocytes commit suicide. Several works show a probable correlation between degree of chondrocyte apoptosis and development of arthritis 2-6 . Our hypothesis is that trauma towards cartilage induces apoptosis. The degree of apoptosis may be proportional to the energy of trauma and to time before reduction. Much research is now done on the possibility of reducing apoptosis of chondrocytes, and thereby slowing the development of arthritis. The aim of this study is to prove apoptosis of chondrocytes in vivo after traumatic hip dislocations, and to see if the degree of apoptosis correlates with time to reduction and operation. Material and Methods: 23 patients with acetabular dislocationfractures with loose cartilage fragments too small to be reinserted were included prospectively from August 2007 to january 2009.

In 1990 Blatter and Weber presented the results of the treatment of femoral non-union with a wave plate with the title ''Wave plate osteosynthesis as a salvage procedure'' outlining this technique as a last resort before amputation or acceptance of non-union in difficult cases. In the late 1980s studies led to the development of a multidirectional locked wave plate based on the initial design by Weber. Its primary purpose was the treatment of femoral nonunion. The implant is now produced and commercialized by a medical manufacturer under the name ''Pressure Plate Fixator'' (PPF). We present the results of the treatment of 75 consecutive patients who were treated with this implant. Aim of the study is the analysis of the results of the treatment of aseptic femoral nonunions using a singular locked implant. Material and Methods: Consecutive case series, setting is a level-1 trauma center with a high number of specialist referrals. Patients: The study is based on a consecutive series of patients with prospective data evaluation. From 1993 to 2003, 75 patients were treated with a wave plate. All patients had persistent non-union of the femoral shaft without clinical or laboratory signs of infection and previous unsuccessful attempts to treat the non-union. Methods: The method of treatment was standardized and included a lateral approach, cancellous bone hip grafting, osteosynthesis with a wave shaped plate (PPF) and poly-axial locking screws as well as the application of a Gentamicin-PMMA chain. Main outcome measurements were time to achieve union, rate of implant failure and number of remaining non-unions after treatment. 75 patients had full follow-up and were included in the study. Results: The non-union healed in 64 patients (85.3%) after the initial procedure. In 8 cases a secondary bone graft was needed.

This study designed to evaluate the accuracy of FAST performed by surgeons in our center and announce it's advantages to Iranian surgeons. Material and Methods: One hundred blunt abdominal trauma patients admitted in Baqiyatallah Hospital since april 2008 to april 2009 were evaluated. FAST performed by trained general surgeons to detect intraperitoneal fluid . Data were analyzed using the chi-square test. Results: Of 100 patients, there were 15 female (15%) and 85 male (85%) with the mean age of 29 years. 5 patients had proven intraabdominal injuries and 95 had no injuries. FAST was positive in 7 patients and negative in 93 patients. There were 2 false positive FAST. The sensitivity and specificity of FAST were 100 per cent and 97.8 per cent, respectively. The positive predictive value was 71.4 per cent, the negative predictive value 100 per cent and the accuracy 98 per cent. Conclusion: Surgeon performed sonography in blunt abdominal trauma is a rapid and accurate test to detect intraperitoneal blood.

Material and Methods: Nineteen consecutive patients were treated for PLD-PLFDs at our institution between August 1996 and June 2009 of which 16 were included in this study and evaluated. The results suggest that patients who where treated for PLD-PLFDs have a limited functional outcome after longterm follow up, independent of the delay in treatment or the presence of a carpal fracture.

Several studies have shown the effective results of this approach especially in low grade injuries in relative hemodynamic stable patients. However, many patients who suffer traumatic liver injuries have concurrent injuries, which may be responsible for serious morbidity and part of the mortality. Material and Methods: A retrospective study involving 47 consecutive patients above the age of 15 years presented at our traumacentre during the period February 2004 till August 2009 with a liver injury. All patients were managed accordingly to ATLS principles. Results: The study group consisted of 28 males and 19 females. There average age was 45 years (range 15 -87). The most important causes of injury were in 51% traffic related, 23% penetrating and in 15% caused by fall from height. Low grade liver injuries grade 1 and 2 were seen in 51%. A total of 22 patients underwent a laparotomy. Eleven patients underwent an angiography. Seventy-nine percent of the patients had on average five extra injuries. Fifty-one percent of patients had more than one intra-abdominal injury. A total of 44 complications were seen in 22 patients of the surviving group. They consist of 26 extra-abdominal complications and 16 intra-abdominal complications and 2 liver-related complications. Mortality rate was 15% in the whole study group. Four patients (9%) died early due to their liver injury. The cause of death in the other patients was not related to the liver injury but to the concurrent injuries. Conclusion: Nearly 79% of patients with a liver injury also have concurrent intra-abdominal or extra-abdominal injuries. Morbidity and mortality are strongly influenced by these injuries and the management of these injuries should also be given generous attention by the trauma surgeon.",

Enhancement in team work and communication was rated highest by the anesthetists (4.1 and 4.0, respectively).Conclusion:The results revealed training being experienced beneficial and motivating. There is an obvious need for the persons being in charge of major judgments in trauma resuscitation, such as surgeons and anesthetists, to gain information on different fields of trauma care. The enhancement in team work and communication was experienced as the most beneficial issue of training, thus meeting well the challenge of maintaining the focus on basic principles of crew resource management (CRM).

Material and Methods: This e-learning concept was created as part of the students' education and it adds different e-learning content to the ever-expanding teaching and learning possibilities (practical lessons en bloc, practical seminars, practical year, voluntary additional lessons in surgery with multimedia learning and instructions by a tutor) in accident surgery in the course of their medical education. Results: The student can choose between different steps of the elearning module: e-lesson, video presentations of operations, video presentations of clinical examinations, Web-based links to an information pool and clinical case descriptions. Additionally, an examination on different levels is included. An additional private lesson for the best students completes the concept. An evaluation of the acceptance by our students produced very positive results. Conclusion:We see e-learning as part of a blended learning concept. E-learning promotes a shift towards adult learning strategies in medical education, which are useful for lifelong learning in medicine. This changes the rule of the teacher in medical education. Educators no longer serve solely as distributors of content, but become facilitators of learning and assessors of competency.References: Wutoh R, Boren SA, Balas EA. eLearning: A review of Internet-based continuing medical education.

D'Amico 2 1 Emergency, Hospital Santojanni, Olivos, Argentina, 2 Emergency, Hospital Santojanni, Buenos Aires, Argentina Introduction: Surgeons apply special knowledgeand skills during trauma patients management. According to population needs, the local Health Department has developed a trauma program to cover those purposes. Material and methods: To describe the opinions of potencial applicants regarding a post basic residency, focused on trauma. A questionnaire composed by 4 questions was given to general surgery residents at the end of their basic training, while they were attending academic meetings. They had to answer about: trauma training during the basic residency (BR), references about authorized hospitals for trauma education, interest to enter a trauma residency and working possibilities after specialization. Results: Between 01/06 -30/11/2007, 62 general surgeon residents answered the questionnaire. Regarding the first statement, 83% of the residents got their trauma training during the BR, as institutional lectures, ATLS Courses and trauma workshops. 60% of the residents ignored the institutions allowed to teach this discipline and 68% of them didnG\u00fa \u00f8t show interest in starting another residency. In contrast, 84% of the surgeons considered it convenient to get a job if they had special education in trauma care. Conclusion:The low enthusiasm of young physicians in trauma management, represents a serious medical problem. Beside the trauma characteristics of each country, basic concepts must be agreed among the trauma societies, in order to organize the education of these professionals. New strategies must deal with overwork, social restrictions and low income, all these problematic situations, conform drawbacks for the applicants at the moment of choosing a surgical specialty.

Materials and Methods: Simplified model of osteosynthesis of humeral shaft fractures: system of two hollow tubes, filled with implants of same diameter, longitudinal dislocation in ''fracture'' 5 mm, length of model 300 mm, inner diameter of tubes 10 mm, material -surgical steel as defined by national standard specification, temperature 38 Dg, diameter of implants from 1.6 to 4.5 mm. Mathematic model was based on theory of fatigue of metals, studied system underwent bending oscillation cycles with 5 mm amplitude. There was observed total number of cycles leading to failure of first implant. Results: These numbers of cycles leading to failure of first implant Conclusion: There is indirect proportion between implant diameter and limits of mechanical stability of system. Best implant diameter in model was 1.6-2.2 mm. Best implant diameter for practical use is 2.0 and 2.2 mm (optimal filling of bone, technical limitation by implantation).

Arlettaz 1 1 Orthopaedics and Trauma, CHCVs H\u00f4 pital du Valais, Sion, Switzerland Introduction: Femoral intramedullary nails is considered as standard procedure for femoral fractures. Even complex fractures can be treated with intramedullary nails if locking nail techniques are used. Nevertheless, locking nail is a demanding technique due to distal targeting. The main problem of the distal targeting is to determine the position of the holes based on the deformities applied during nail insertion. They are only few paper of nail bending analysis in the literature. We do not currently know exactly how, how much and in which axes a femoral nail bends during insertion. The aim of this study is to determine how and how much a femoral nail bend during insertion into 20 intact femur of caucasian cadaver. Materials and Methods: The method consists in determining the zero position of an external apparatus receiving a signal from the distal part of the nail. The nail (Sirus \u00d2 nail 12x400 Zimmer Inc) is then inserted and the apparatus aligned to the signal emitted by the nail. Finally, one can measure the direction of bending and its displacement in millimeter. Results: All nails bend anteriorly in the Z axis (AP deformity) from 2 to 17 mm (mean 12.2 mm). No or negligible deformity in the X axis (torsion deformity) are observed. Our system does not give information about Y axis (lateral) deformity. Conclusion: This study is limited to a given nail and to Caucasian people. The nail deformities are well defined and mostly anterior in the frontal plan. There are no significant rotational deformities. Lateral deformities need to be investigated. This study gives new data for targeting comprehension. Krettek C, et al.

The main complication in the bioresorbable group was mechanical failure so that the study was terminated ahead of shedule. With the bioresorbable plates used in that study, angular stability was provided by spot-welding the screw heads to the plate with a cautery pen. One question in the present study was if bioresorbable implants that achieve angular stability by the screw thread cutting into the plate can provide mechanical properties that are comparable with standard titanium-implants. The other goal of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical properties of a newest generation anatomical shaped implants. Materials and Methods: Three implants were tested in this study. The Inion OTPS TM Biodegradable Distal Radius Plate that is made of L-PLA/D, L-PLA and TMC, the titanium 2.4-mm LCP Volar Column Distal Radius Plate and the 2.4/2.7-mm volar Distal Radius Plate. Twelve pairs of fresh-frozen radii were assigned to three BMDmatched groups. A extra-articular distal radius fracture was created. Post-plating stiffness and displacement were studied in a first axialloading test. Next, biodegradation was simulated by 4 weeks' immersion in PBS, followed by a second axial test. Finally the specimens underwent cyclic loading. Results: Initial test: The LCP plate was significantly stiffer and displaced less than the bioresorbable plate. Post immersion tests: One bioresorbable plate failed early on after 4 weeks' immersion The remaining bioresorbable plates and the T-plates did not differ significantly. Cyclic tests: The LCP plate was significantly superior to the other systems. One T-plate and four of the bioresorbable plates failed; none of the LCP plates did. In the bioresorbable constructs, stability, time to failure, and BMD were significantly correlated. Conclusion: Except one plate failure the bioresorbable plate was similar to the T-plate in the quasi-static tests, and should, therefore, be considered for clinical studies, with patient selection confined, initially, only to candidates with good bone stock quality.

Materials and Methods: In seven pairs of human below-knee specimens, bone mineral density (BMD) was determined, and TTCA was performed with an intramedullary nail (Synthes Expert HAN), using a perforated screw plus a fixed-angle perforated screw vs a conventional screw plus a conventional fixed-angle screw, in the calcaneus. After that augmenta-tion was performed through the perforated and canulated screws using 3.5 ml PMMA cement. The constructs were subjected to quasi-static loading (dorsiflexion/plantar flexion, varus/valgus, rotation) and to cyclic loading to failure. Parameters studied were construct neutral zone (NZ) and range of motion (ROM), and number of cycles to failure. Results: The augmented screw constructs had a significantly smaller NZ and ROM in the quasi-static test and in the cyclic test. Furthermore failure occurred significant later in the augmented group. There was a significant correlation between BMD and cycles to failure.Conclusion: In TTCA with a Nailing System, the use of bone-cementaugmentation -techniques can further reduce motion within the construct. This may be especially useful in poor bone stock. So results obtained in this study could be used to give the operating surgeon's further options in TTCA in severe cases.

How Well are we Doing? M. S. Rashid 1 , O. Sobowale 2 , A. Sahu 1 , B. D. Todd 1 1 Trauma & Orthopaedic Surgery, Stockport NHS foundation trust, Stockport, UK, 2 Trauma & Orthopaedic Surgery, Salford Royal Foundation Trust, Salford, UK Introduction: Hip fracture is a common reason for morbidity and mortality. In the UK last year 68,284 patients were admitted with hip fracture, accounting for over one million bed days. Guidelines suggest that hip fractures should be treated surgically within 24 h of admission. Stockport NHS Foundation Trust in the Northwest of England treats approximately 350 hip fractures per annum. Our primary aim was to audit the path of hip fractures from admission to discharge. We looked specifically at time taken to transfer to an orthopaedic ward, time to theatre, reasons for delay and time to discharge. Materials and Methods: Using a proforma we collected data prospectively on hip fractures treated at Stepping Hill hospital between 01/01/08 and 01/07/09. Our inclusion criterion was hip fractures in patients over 65. Our exclusion criteria included subtrochanteric/pathological fractures, and fractures recently treated unsuccessfully. Data collected included patient demographics, fracture details, admitted from location, ASA grade, operative details, date/time of admission, date/time of surgery, reasons for delay to theatre, discharge date/location. Results: We found that 487 hip fractures were treated in our trust. Of these, 76% were female. 64% were ASA grade 3 and 19% ASA grade 4. The mean age of our cohort was 83 years. 42% of hip fractures were intertrochanteric, 58% were intracapsular. The mean time to theatre was 46 h. 41% were treated within 24 h of admission and 73% were treated surgically within 48 h of admission. Reasons for delay included: patient medically unfit (51%); administrative reasons (41%) and other reasons (8%). The average length of hospital stay was 21 days (range 8-73). Conclusion:",

Disclosure: No significant relationships.Introduction: The Targon Femoral Neck Hip Screw has been designed to improve the fixation of intracapsular hip fractures. Fracture healing complications after internal fixation occur in approximately 30-40% of displaced fractures and 5-10% of undisplaced fractures. Material and Methods: The new implant consists of a small plate with six locking screw ports. The two distal holes are used to fix the plate to the lateral cortex of the femur. Three of four screws are passes through the proximal holes and across the fracture site. These 6.5 mm screws are dynamic to allow for collapse of the fracture across the femoral neck. A jig is used to aid insertion of the device with minimal surgical exposure of the femur. Results: For the first 200 patients treated with this implant at the first centre to use this implant, the mean age of the patients was 77 years (range 39-103), 58% were female. The mean length of surgery was 46 minutes and the mean length of anaesthesia 59 minutes. The median length of institutional stay till discharge home was 9 days (mean 13 days, range 3-107). Four telescoping screws were used in 55% of patients, three in 44% and two in 1% of patients. Follow-up of patients at present is a minimum of six months. For the 74 undisplaced fractures there has been one case of non-union and one case of avascular necrosis. For the 121 displaced fractures (Garden III and IV) there have been eleven cases of fracture non-union, six cases of avascular necrosis and two cases of plate detachment from the femur treated by repeat fixation. In addition there was one deep wound sepsis treated by removal of the implant and girdlestone arthroplasty. For the five basal fractures treated there has been one case of plate detachment from the femur. Observation of those fractures that have healed shows there has been between 0 to 22 mm of collapse at the fracture site which occurs along the line of the femoral neck. There has been no tilting of the fracture into varus as occurs with a parallel screw method. Conclusion: The results to date show an incidence of fracture healing complications is about a third that which is to be expected with a parallel screw method. This new implant may be a significant advance in the treatment of this difficult and common fracture.

Okcu 1 , N. Ozkayin 2 , K. Aktuglu 2 1 Orthop & Traumatology, Celal Bayar University, Izmir, Turkey, 2 Orthop & Traumatology, EGE University, Izmir, Turkey Introduction: Purpose: To compare the functional and radiological outcome of femoral neck fractures fixed with closed reduction and two different cannulated titanium screws. Material and Methods: Patients & Methods: The study was prospective, randomized and IRB approved . Inclusion criteria included skeletal maturity, closed femoral neck fracture without concomitant fractures or injuries with complete charts and adequate radiographs obtained from the initial injury till the last follow-up. Forty-four patients have been enrolled in our study during one-year period at two university centers. Of 44 patients who consented to participate in the study, 22 were randomized to be treated with full threaded, cannu-Three or four screws were used in both groups according to fracture type and surgeon's preferences. Data evaluated included surgical time, flouroscopy time, fracture type, radiological outcome, complications and functional status by Harris Hip Score. Results: Both groups were comparable in terms of age and gender. There was not a significant difference in terms of surgical time, follow-up period, fracture type, or flouroscopy time. There were eight complications in Group 1 and two in Group 2, which was statistically significant (p = 0,049) Time to union was significantly longer in Group 1 (p = 0,001). However, Hip Scores were not significantly different in both groups (p = 0,20). Conclusion: When compared with full threaded compression screws the 16 mm threaded screws provides a shorter union time and less complication rate while providing equivalent functional results in adult femoral neck fractures.

Results: Since the implementation of this policy 90% of all hip fracture patients are receiving definitive surgical treatment within 48 hours of admission. Site variations are identified and remedial actions implemented for those hospitals which fail to meet this target. Acute care length of stay following hip fracture has declined from a mean of 17 days to a mean of 8 days. The number of patients with hip fractures returning to their pre-injury residence has increased significantly from approximately 35% to 70% at 3 months post-fracture. Conclusion: A structured program for hip fracture care can be developed in large population areas and has been implemented for the approximate 10,000 patients sustaining hip fractures annually within our jurisdiction. This model should be broadly applicable to other health regions.Disclosure: No significant relationships. M064 An Audit of Antiresorptive Therapy Following Hip Fracture Admission to a Hospital in the Northwest of England M. S. Rashid 1 , O. Sobowale 2 , A. Sahu 1 , B. D. Todd 1 1 Trauma & Orthopaedic Surgery, Stockport NHS foundation trust, Stockport, UK, 2 Trauma & Orthopaedic Surgery, Salford Royal Foundation Trust, Salford, UK Introduction: In the UK last year there were 68,284 hip fractures admitted and treated to the NHS. The majority of these were fragility fractures following a fall at home. Guidelines suggest that all hip fractures admitted should receive an assessment to determine the need for antiresorptive therapy aimed to reduce the risk of future osteoporotic fractures. Our primary aim was to audit the assessment for antiresorptive therapy on admission for hip fractures treated at Stockport NHS Foundation Trust. The dedicated hip fracture trauma unit, The Ratcliffe Unit, is the centre for the management of hip fractures admitted to Stepping Hill hospital. Material and Methods: Using a profoma we collected data prospectively on all hip fractures admitted to Stepping Hill hospital. We gathered information on patient demographics, fracture details, location admitted from, operative details, and antiresorptive therapy assessment during this episode. Our inclusion criterion was all hip fractures admitted to Stepping Hill hospital between 1st January 2008 and 1st July 2009. Our exclusion criteria included pathological fractures and fractures in patients aged younger than 65 years old. Results: During our study period 512 hip fractures were admitted. Of these, 75.3% were female. The mean age was 83 years. Of the fractures treated, 39.4% were intertrochanteric, 54.9% intracapsular (77.8% displaced) and 5.7% were subtrochanteric fractures. 13% were ASA grade 1-2, 64% were ASA grade 3 and 19% ASA grade 4. 72.7% of patients were admitted from their own home or sheltered housing and 22.9% were admitted from a nursing home or residential care.",

In a retrospective evaluation of our own patients we analysed the indication to borders and results of the isolated dorsal instrumentated fractures of thoracolumbar spine. Material and Methods: From 2004 to 2007 72 patients were treated by isolated dorsal instrumentation of fractures of the thoracolumbar spine in our clinic. In a retrospective examination subjective results by means of VAS, Oswestry Score (OS) and Hannover Spine Score (HWS) and a radiological analysis were grasped with the patients beside the clinical investigation before and in a 2 years follow up after surgery. Results: All together 72 patients could be enclosed, from which 56 took part in a follow up examination. The average age at the accident time lay in the Median with 59 Years (17/77) by a gender distribution of 22 men to 34 women. By the fracture distribution appeared excluding A injuries. These divided in 19A1, one A2, and 36 A3 fractures. With 12 fractures the dorsal cortex of the vertebra was fractured. Depending on Fracture type a bisegmental dorsal instrumentation occurred in 21 cases and monosegmental in 34 cases. With the clinical 2-years follow up a finger ground distance of 18 cm (0/52) appeared in the Median.One patient showed a neurological deficit. The standardised measuring values showed in the Median for Ott 31 (31/33) and Schober 13 (11/15) norm-valued measuring values. The VAS appeared with 1 in the Median (0/8) and 23% of the patients showed a VAS > 5. Rest pains appeared with 6, load pains with 24 and night pain with 10 patients. The OS appeared at a range of 6 (0/64), the HWS at 78 (0/100). With regard to the analysis of the fracture height a clear trend with an increased pain situation and lower subjective patient's satisfaction appeared for fractures of the LWK II and III, without a significance level was reached. As another factor the secondary lost of reposition could be identified for a worse Outcome. In 5 patients with an VAS > 5 we saw a decrease of the vertebral hight of 10% and more in comparison to the postsurgical X-ray results. Conclusion: The isolated dorsal instrumentation of Typ A fractures of the spine showed good clinical results if the surgically achieved restoration of the vertebral height could be held. The unstable fractures show the border for the isolated dorsal instrumentation. In spite of exact knowledge and the analysis of the fracture type it can come to poor results, so that the decision remains an individual isolated case decision.

The aim of our investigation was to reach an special algorithm of treatment for clinical everyday use in regard of the special difficulties for these patients. Material and Methods: The following inclusion criteria were fixed: 1.Minimum age 65 years, 2.presentation of a compression fracture (Type A3 to AO Magerl), 3.adequate accident mechanism. 41 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria from 01/2002 to 12/2005. These were assigned in 3 groups depending on the technique used: combined dorso-ventral stabilization, posterior intrumentation with internal fixator only and ballon-kyphoplasty. General demographic and epidemiological data as well as the therapy course were collected. Radiological evaluations were used as a measure for the reduction and correction as well as the outcome, In addition, a follow-up of the patients with valuation of the subjective and functional healing was assessed. The decision for one of the 3 methods was made by judeging the general medical condition and the OP risk linked with it and the extent of the burst component of the fracture in the CT-Scan. Results: The combined dorso-ventral group (18) showed the youngest age in average (67 years), in both other groups (internal fixator only 7 patients; Ballonkyphoplasty 16 patients) the mean age was the same (75 years). OP duration, intraoperative blood loss, stay during the hospital were the longest or the highest in the combined dorsoventral supplied patients. The highest general complication rate (28%) also appeared in this group. Follow-up was done on average after 39 months, Re-examination rate was 78%. The combined treated patients showed the best functional and radiological outcome. Bone fusion occured in 86%. The patients,who underwent only dorsal intrumentation showed the worst functional and radiological outcome of all groups. The patients treated with kyphoplasty showed only a slightly less favorable functional result than the combined treated patients.Conclusion: The results support the following algorithm of treatment in our department: Good general condition with high activity level before accident: combined dorsoventral fusion. Poor medical condition, low activity with relevant burst component posterior intrumentation only. Poor medical condition, low activity level, no relevant burst component: Kyphoplasty. In regard of the worse functional outcome of posterior fusion only, cement augmentation of the pedical screws and minimal invasive techniques may lead to better results for these patients.

Moreira Orthopedics and Traumatology, Centro Hospitalar Alto Ave -Guimar\u00e3 es, Guimar\u00e3 es, PortugalIntroduction: Thoracolumbar and lumbar fractures are serious lesions associated commonly with neurological deficits. Posterior stabilization by internal fixation is actually a frequent procedure for the treatment of unstable fractures. The objective of this study is to retrospectively analyze the functional outcome of segmental spine instrumentation of unstable thoracolumbar and lumbar fractures, and the association with neurological impairment(1). Material and methods: This retrospective study included 70 patients (49 men and 21 female) with acute unstable thoracolumbar and lumbar fractures, between January 1996 and December 2007 treated with segmental instrumentation (61 with transpedicular fixation and 9 sublaminar wiring fixation). The medium age was 38,22 years (15-70 years) and the medium time of follow up was 75,60 months (20-150 months). The fractures were in 14 cases D12, 26 L1 and 30 in other locations. The evaluation included location, mechanism and type of fractures; associated injuries, neurological symptoms pre and post surgery, complications and radiograph evaluation of the degree of reduction. The injuries were evaluated with the Thoraco-Lumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score (TLICS) and the patients with the Oswetry Disability Index (ODI) and visual pain analogical scale(2). Results: The lesion in 71,4% resulted from a fall from height, in 20% a car accident and another cause in 8,6%. In 56 cases 1 vertebra was affected, in 12 two vertebras and in 2 multi-level injuries. The angle of kyphosis was on average 22.1\u00ba. Vertebral body was completed restored in 48 cases and incompletely in 22 (up to 5\u00ba deficit). TLICS was 5 in 25,7%, 6 in 21,4%, 7 in 11,4%, 8 in 11,4% and 9 in 8,6%. 55,7% of the patients had no neurologic lesions; 7,1% nerve root, 14,3% incomplete and 20% complete cord lesion and 2,9% with cauda equina. 71,4% returned to work: 57,1% to the same and 14,3% to a lighter job; and the rest didn't work at all. According to the ODI 36 patients had 20-40%, 7 > 40-60% and 6 > 80%. Conclusion: Work status correlated directly with neurological impairment but not to injury level or mechanism. Although the important trauma experienced by these patients, return to work and results in the ODI were good. The group with complete neurological lesion had elevated disability scores associated with functional impairment. With adequate and early treatment of spine fractures we can prevent further neurological deficits(3).References: 1.

Introduction: Surgical treatment for fractures in the Thorcolumbar (TL) region are controversial. Mid term functional and radiological results of the sagittal plane of posterior surgery (group 1) and anterior surgery (alone or combined) were compared. Material and methods: Between the years 1998-2005 20 patients (7 female, 13 male) were operated on for TL vertebra fractures. (15 posterior, 3 anterior, 2 anterior + posterior). The average age of Group 1 was 34.6 \u00b1 15.06, and Group 2 was 35.4 \u00b1 11.13. Fractures were classified according to the AO/Magerl system, and the neurological status was evaluated with Frankel and ASIA. Local kyphos angle (LKA), anterior compression angle (ACA), anterior height (F) were measured radiologically on the sagittal plane and compared postoperatively in the early and late term. Patient satisfaction was evaluated using visual analog score (VAS). Paitents were evaluated for implant failure, infection and neurological status. The average follow up period was 8.43 \u00b1 2.99 years for Group 1, and 8.9 \u00b1 0.22 years for Group 2.Results: Of 20 patients a total of 31 vertebra were diagnosed with fractures. 27 fractures were type A, 2 type B, and 2 type C (between T5-L4; the most effected vertebra was L1). The average LKA for all groups preop, early and late term results were measured. There were no neurological complications and infections. Implant failure was only detected in Group 1 (70%). Group 1 average VAS was higher than Group 2 (p < 0.05). Conclusion: When comparing Group 1 with Group 2, Group 1 showed a significant correction on the sagittal plane but satisfaction was higher in Group 2. For TL fractures that receive Group 2 the risk of implant failure is lower and satisfaction is higher.References: 1. Modi HN, Chung KJ, Seo IW, Yoon HS, Hwang JH, Kim HK, Noh KC, Yoo JH.

In a world literature we can find only few papers about this problem. We would like to present the largest group of patients ever published, define the basic principles of treatment and describe typical complications. Material and Methods: In the past 9 years (1999-2007) we have been treating 28 patients with this type of injury in our hospital. There were 21 men and 7 women in average age of 34 years. Surgery was performed by 23 patients, 5 patients were treated conservatively. All patients were regularly controled, we were evaluating radiological and neurological status, type and number of complications and patient satisfaction with the result of our treatment. Results: By 13 patients we noted neurological deficit in the day of admission. By 8 patients the neurological status was completely normalised during the follow up period. By the others the neurological outcome was significantly improved. Average difference in high of frontal edge of vertebral body at the beginning and at the and of follow up period was 0.8 mm, difference in dorsal edge was 0.6 mm, difference in lordosis L4-S1 was 2.8 degrees and difference in angle of end plates of L5 vertebral body was 1.1 degrees. From early complications we once noted deep wound infection and once we had to reoperate because of L5 nerve root irritation. From late complications we once noted osteolytic rim around the screws and by 6 patients we noted breaking of transpedicular screw. At the end of follow up period 15 patients were painless, 10 patients were complaining about intermitent pain and 3 patients were complaining about frequently pain in the fracture site. Conclusion: By patients with negative neurological status and minimal compression of vertebral body we strictly recommend conservative treatment. This method is preferable also by burst fractures without significant instability. The high of vertebral body and axis of the vertebral column would be influenced by operation just insignificantly. In the case of neurological deficit we would recommend operative treatment with decompression of neural structures. Practically always we could expect significant improvement of neurological status.

To examine the frequency and related characteristics of concurrent extraspinal fractures amongst patients with a new onset of spinal cord injury. 2) To ascertain whether concurrent extraspinal fractures are identified within 24 hours of trauma.Material and Methods: Retrospective case note and radiographic review using performa on all new onset spinal cord injured patients for a period of three years (Jan 2001-Dec 2003) admitted to North West Regional Spinal Injuries Centre.UK. Out of the total 189 patients admitted in three years 148 patients sustained injury due to trauma and were included in the study. Results: 1) Out of the 148 trauma patients 32 patients had concurrent extraspinal fractures (21.6%). 2) In the first 24 hours after trauma 92.3% of extraspinal fractures were identified during primary survey while 7.7% of extraspinal fractures were diagnosed within 3 days of injury. 3) Falls were the leading cause of spinal cord injury and associated fractures(44.6%) followed by motor vehicle collision (37.8%) in North West Region of England. 4) The commonest anatomical regions with extra spinal fractures are the Upper extremity (35.7%) followed by Chest (32.1%). 5) Tetraplegic patients had more multiple extra spinal fractures compared to paraplegic patients. Paraplegic patients had more number of single extra spinal fractures. 6) The cause, level and extent of neurological deficit influenced the frequency and location of concurrent extra spinal fractures. Conclusion: 1) All extraspinal fractures should be identified in primary survey and to avoid missing of these fractures a detailed secondary survey should be performed when the patient is shifted to the ward. 2) Tetraplegic patients had more multiple extra spinal fractures compared to paraplegic patients. Paraplegic patients had more number of single extra spinal fractures. 3) The cause, level and extent of neurological deficit influenced the frequency and location of concurrent extra spinal fractures.4) The knowledge of frequency and characteristics of extraspinal fractures has to be disseminated among medical and nursing staff in accident and emergency department for early detection and treatment of these fractures.Introduction: High energy trauma are more frequent and their clinical aspects more complex, since diagnostic preocedures can precisely identify the problem and clinical experience has signifficantly increased. Acute peripheral iscahemia appears immediatly after trauma-these are cases when diagnostic is usualy established without problems-or late after trauma, when the injury is usually post-traumatic arterial thrombosis (with late onset) or compression (by posttraumatic hematoma) with subsequent thrombosis.Material and Methods: This retrospective study analyse 46 cases, operated between 01.01.2003-01.01.2009 with acute peripheral ischaemia following closed injuries of the inferior limbs.The structure based on age and sex of group revealed that most of the patients were active, underlying the social importance of the problem. The injuries were: femoral shaft fractures (4 cases), distal femoral fractures (8 cases), knee dislocations (8 cases), proximal tibial fractures (14 cases), tibial shaft fractures",

Baumann Graz Medical University, Dept. of Vascular Surgery, Graz, Austria Introduction: In vascular surgical practice the total of operations for treatment of traumatic lesions is rare with 0.3 to 4 %. Nevertheless there is a considerable risk of limb loss or death in complex trauma including vessel injuries. Immediate diagnosis and therapy are vital. Aim of this study was to analyze outcome in vascular surgical revascularization in extremity trauma. Material and Methods: Between 1.1.2003 and 27.4.2009 a total of 61 vascular surgical operations were performed in trauma patients (pat). Prospectively collected data were analyzed retrospectively. Results: In 7 pat. (7/61 = 11.5%) surgery was necessary for vascular lesions in the body trunk, in 12 pat (12/61 = 19.7%) in the head and neck area, in 20 pat (20/61 = 32.8%) inthe upper extremity and in 22 pat (22/61 = 36.1%) in the lower extremity. Drei pat died 1-8 days postoperatively (mortality 3/61 = 4.9%).Reconstructions for trauma in the lower extremity were performed in 4 pat above the knee and in 16 pat in the genicular or infragenicular region. In 16 pat with distal vascular reconstruction there were 3 women and 13 men with a mean age 46.3 + 19.0 years (range 15 to 78 years). Reconstruction was due to penetrating trauma in 8 pat and in 8 after non-penetrating trauma because of ischemia of the distal extremity. A 39 y.o. man died on postoperative day 1 due to multi organ failure (mortality in lower extremity trauma 6.3% (1/ 16 pat)). In 4 pat a major amputation (1 exarticulation at knee level, 3 amputations above knee). In 2 pat amputation was performed early post revascularisation (day 5 and day 20 postop) and in 2 pat after an interval of 4 and 5 months because of deep infections with osteomyelitis. Limb salvage rate is 75% (12/16 extremities). Conclusion: Optimal interdisciplinary cooperation and emergency revascularisation by an experienced vascular surgeon can help to prevent amputation in extremity trauma. Especially in polytraumatized patients the decision for or against vascular reconstruction is important the depending on the patients\u00a2 condition and the extent of injuries.

However, the rate of early diagnosis of such injuries is increasing due to increased awareness and the liberal use of contrast enhanced computed tomography. Sporadic case reports have shown the feasibility of endovascular management of blunt renal artery injury. Here we present our experience and review the literature. Material and Methods: Three blunt trauma patients who suffered from renal artery injury were successfully treated by an endovascular approach at our level one trauma center over a period of 18 months. All three patients were males with a mean age of 16 years (range4- 21). Mechanism of injury was motor vehicle accident in all patients. Diagnosis was established by means of contrast enhanced computed tomography in all cases (irregular enhancement of the kidney in two patients and a non-enhancing kidney in the third). Mean time from injury to endovascular revascularization was 193 minutes (range 150-220 minutes), and mean time from admission to revascularization was 154 minutes (range 110-180 minutes). A metallic stent was used in two cases, while angioplasty alone was performed in a 4 year-old boy. Results: A good early angiographic result was achieved in all patients. At a mean follow-up of 13 months (range 5-21 months) renal artery was patent in all three patients by means of Duplex ultrasound. Mean renal function of the affected kidney at last follow-up was 33% (range 19-41%) on DTPA renal scan. No early or late complications were encountered. Hypertension was not evident in any of the patients. Conclusion: Endovascular management for blunt renal artery dissection is safe and feasible. This approach is expected to replace surgical revascularization in most cases.References: Sangthong B, Demetriades D, Martin M, et al.

Material and Methods: Over the past 30 years 75 patients were treated for traumatic aortic rupture (TAR) at the University Hospitals Leuven. During this period diagnostic workup and therapy have changed leading to improved outcome. The introduction of endovascular therapy in 1998 was a mile stone. We retrospectively reviewed the diagnostic workup and management of all these patients and compared outcome before and since the era of endovascular therapy. Results: Based on this experience guidelines for decision making in the management of TAR are formulated. Conclusion: Diagnostic workup and patient management has evolved over time leading to improved outcome.

This acute traumatic rupture is mostly located in the thoracic part. If the aortic rupture includes all three layers it normally leads to death immediately. So, the understanding of the trauma mechanism is critical for the accident analysis as well as for design purposes of new safety measures and devices. Traditionally crash test dummies have been used in hardware crash test and some injury criteria have been elaborated. With the rapid development of computers the importance of numerical simulation grows. Detailed finite element human models can represent the human subjects much better as the mechanical dummy, especially the internal forces and straines at the thorax.Material and Methods: Within a period of two years a database was created at the ''Institut f\u00fc r Rechtsmedizin M\u00fc nchen'' with every victim of an accident with heavy thoracic injuries, including all medical findings and analytical results of the accidents. We took 81 cases for further examination. The causes of death were either an aortic rupture (68), a rupture of the pulmonal vessels",

Material and Methods: Case report: We report a 69-year-old Caucasian male who presented with critical ischemia to the left lower extremity. CT-scan showed, besides occlusion of both superficial femoral arteries, a chronic contained rupture e of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The aneurysm was excluded with a stent graft placed through a femoral approach in a semi-urgent procedure. CTscans at 1, 3 and 6 months demonstrated continued exclusion of the aneurysm. Results: ////////// Case Report Conclusion: Chronic contained ruptures of aortic aneurysms are a rare but important subset of ruptured aneurysms, which have a clinical and radiological presentation that is distinctly different from that of acute ruptures. A high index of suspicion is needed to diag-nose this condition as the presentation may be variable and nonspecific. Contrast enhanced CT-scan is the gold standard diagnosing technique for detection of CCR AAA and evaluation of locoregional extension. Treatment consists of surgical intervention with endovascular repair being the treatment modality of choice in anatomical suitable candidates. Disclosure: No significant relationships. Department of Trauma, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany Introduction: The early identification of high risk patients after multiple trauma is known to be difficult. A potentially relevant marker in multiple trauma patients is the plasma concentration of procalcitonin (PCT). Therefore, we conducted a prospective cohort study to investigate whether (i) PCT serum levels predict the development of posttraumatic complications and (ii) polymorphisms in the calcitonin (CALCA) gene are associated with PCT levels and posttraumatic complications like SIRS, Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) or sepsis. Material and Methods: The inclusion criteria of this prospective studies were: (i) Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 16; (ii) age 18-60 years; (iii) survival > 48 hours after injury. Blood samples were drawn once daily for systemic PCT concentrations. Furthermore, the clinical course was recorded once daily. Multiple trauma patients were separated, according to the development of MODS, SIRS and sepsis. Statistics: Spearman rank correlation coefficient, logistic regression and analysis, Fishers exact test, Student's t-test, stat. significance p < 0.05. Results: 137 multiple trauma patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. PCT plasma levels were significantly higher in patients with sepsis and MODS. Furthermore, PCT revealed a high specificity (99.1%) and overall accuracy (88.1%) in predicting sepsis at day 1 after trauma. No differences were observed for allelic and genotypic distributions between patients and 104 healthy German controls. When trauma patients were grouped according different clinical outcome parameters (sepsis, MODS, SIRS) no association between any of the studied parameters and CALCA SNPs was observed. Additionally, no association was observed between CALCA-SNPs and PCT levels. Conclusion: We conclude that PCT seems to represent a reliable marker for early prediction of infectious complications after trauma. Furthermore, PCT concentrations have a goog predictive value for MODS development in the later clinical course. However, CALCA polymorphisms are unlikely to influence PCT levels and clinical outcome in polytraumatized patients. Disclosure: No significant relationships. M082 Early Prediction of Massive Transfusion in the Blunt Trauma Patient and the Role of Thromboelastography Introduction: Early prediction of massive transfusion (MT) is critical in the management of severely injured trauma patients. Variables available early after injury including physiologic, laboratory and rotation thromboelastometric (ROTEM) parameters were evaluated as predictors for the need of MT. Material and methods: After IRB approval, we retrospectively reviewed a cohort of severely injured trauma patients (ISS \u2021 16) admitted to a level 1 trauma center with available ROTEM measurements on hospital admission during a 1-year study period. Patients who received a MT ( \u2021 10 units PRBC within 24 hours of admission) were compared with patients who did not. Variables independently associated with MT were identified using stepwise logistic regression. Results: A total of 53 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 18 patients (34.0%) received a MT and 35 patients (66.0%) did not. were significantly higher in MT patients. Patients receiving a MT had significantly altered ROTEM values on admission compared to non-MT patients. An increase in the clot formation time (471.3 \u00b1 169.9 vs. 178.1 \u00b1 19.9 sec; p = 0.001), a shortening of the maximum clot firmness (37.5 \u00b1 2.9 vs. 50.7 \u00b1 1.4 mm; p < 0.001), and a shortening of the clot amplitude at all time-points (10/20/30 minutes) were observed in massively 3 transfused trauma patients. Variables independently associated with MT included a hemoglobin level \u00a3 10 g/dL and an abnormal maximum clot firmness value [area under the ROC curve: 0Readily available variables such as the initial hemoglobin level and rotation thromboelastometry values reliably predict the need for massive transfusion in severely injured patients. Prospective validation of the effectiveness of thromboelastometry to guide the transfusion management in trauma patients is warranted. Disclosure: No significant relationships.

Herein, we studied the kinetics of kynurenine in patients after major trauma and whether this correlates with development of posttraumatic sepsis. Material and Methods: Kynurenine and tryptophan of 60 multiple injured patients with Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 16 were quantified prospectively by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Blood samples were obtained daily from admission until day 10 after admission.Results: Significantly increased kynurenine values were detectable already at day 1 after admission in blood from patients that later developed sepsis, regardless of injury pattern (p < 0.01). In contrast, kynurenine values of non-septic patients remained low throughout the observation period. However, all patients exhibited significantly decreased tryptophan values versus healthy controls (p < 0.01). Moreover, significantly increased kynurenine:tryptophan ratios rapidly predicted subsequent sepsis, multiple organ failure, and death (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Both, increased kynurenine values and kynurenine:tryptophan ratios predicted posttraumatic development of sepsis and organ failure.

In preparation of a randomized multicenter study severely injured patients are evaluated with TBCT in the AMC. Aim of this study was to assess several important time intervals of the TBCT work-up. Material and Methods: From January 2009 all consecutive severely injured patients presented in the trauma resuscitation room during office hours were checked for eligibility. Inclusion criteria were based on life-threatening vital parameters or clinical suspicion on severe injuries. Patients were excluded if aged less than 18 years, known pregnancy or if the trauma team leader judged the patient too unstable to undergo a CT scan. TBCT consisted of a scan of the brain and C-spine without contrast and CT of the chest and abdomen with Total body CT scanning in severely injured patients appears fast, effective en safe while using strict in-and exclusion criteria.

It provided data concerning the patterns of interfacility transfers. In this study, the transferred patient group was compared to the non transferred patient group. Information reviewed included patient and injury characteristics, need for an operation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admittance and mortality. Analysis employed descriptive statistics and Chi-square test. Interfacility transfers were then assessed according to each health care facility's availability of five requirements; Computed Tomography scanner, ICU, neurosurgeon, orthopedic and vascular surgeon. Results: Data on 8,524 patients were analyzed; 86.3% were treated at the same facility, whereas 13.7% were transferred. Transferred patients tended to be younger, male, and more severely injured than non transferred patients. Moreover, they were admitted to ICU more often, had a higher mortality rate but were less operated on compared to non transferred patients. The 34.3% of transfers was from facilities with none of the five requirements, whereas the 12.4% was from those with at least one requirement. Facilities with up to three requirements transferred 43.2% of their transfer volume to units of equal resources. Conclusion: Trauma management in Greece results in a high number of transfers. Patients are frequently transferred between facilities with officially similar capabilities. Better coordination could lead to improved outcomes and less cost.",

Broos 3 1 Trauma Surgery and Orthopaedics, UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, 2 Department of Traumatology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium,3  Traumatology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium Introduction: Fracture arthroplasty remains a valid treatment for complex fractures of the proximal humerus in the elderly. However functional results depend on healing of the tuberosities. Advanced prosthetic design and optimized techniques of tuberosity fixation results in increased healing rates, but nevertheless in 1 out of 4 patients anatomical healing of the tuberosities is not achieved. Reversed arthroplasty can be used to treat different pathologies that can be summarized as rotator cuff insufficient shoulders. Some reports on the use of reversed prostheses in the treatment of proximal humeral fractures exist. The most common problem is that reattachment of the tuberosities is difficult and healing is seldom achieved. We describe the use of and outcome of reversed prosthesis specifically designed for the treatment of proximal humeral fractures. Material and Methods: We prospectively documented the outcome of reversed shoulder arthroplasty for acute fractures using the Affinis Inverse Fracture System (Mathys ltd, Betlach, Switzerland) and report the 1 year result. Indications for primary reversed arthroplasty were: a pre-existing large to massive rotator cuff tear, comminuted tuberosities, female gender and age over 75. Outcome measures are: range of motion, pain, strength, Constant score and complications including notching. Physical examination has been performed by an independent investigator. Results have been compared to a historical series of patients treated by hemiarthroplasty. Results: On average the patients treated by reversed arthroplasty are 7,5 years older than those treated by hemiarthroplasty. The average Constant score in the reversed group is 61,5 against 59,5 in the hemigroup. This difference is statistically not significant. There is a better elevation and abduction in the reversed group. Strength is better in the hemigroup. No other statistical significant differences could be demonstrated. In the reversed group there was 1 infection, 1 fracture of the collar bone and 1 fracture of the coracoid process. In the hemigroup there was 1 infection, 1 periprosthetic fracture, and two loosenings of the tuberosities needing revision with a reversed prosthesis. Conclusion: Reversed arthroplasty results in comparable results as hemiarthroplasty, but in patients being on average 7,5 years older with a similar complication rate as in hemiarthroplasty.

Wolf 1 1 Trauma Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, AustriaIntroduction: With an overall incidence of between 0,5% and 3% there is less experience in dealing with such cases. Our aim was to analyze the complications associated with early surgical treatment of periprosthetic type-B humeral fractures. Material and Methods: We classified the periprosthetic fractures according to the system proposed by Wright and Cofield in 1995.1   Type-A fractures are located at the tip of the prosthesis and extend proximally, type-B fractures lie at the tip of the prosthesis without extension or with minimal extension proximally and variable extension distally, and type-C fractures occur distal to the implant and extend into the distal humeral metaphysis. Results: The average time from arthroplasty to the fracture was 45,5 months (range, 12 to 48 months). The fracture united in four patients. Pseudoarthrosis was detected in one patient. The average active shoulder abduction was 26\u00b0(range, 10\u00b0to 45\u00b0) and the average external rotation was 14\u00b0(range, 5\u00b0to 20\u00b0) at the last follow-up examination. In three patients with a well-fixed humeral component, open reduction and internal fixation with the use of a plate and screws was performed. Two patients with a Delta prosthesis had an unstable humeral component. In one patient a proximal humeral resection and an implantation of an HMRS prosthesis was performed. The other patient received a delta revision stem prosthesis, cable and plate fixation. Conclusion: The main problems were postoperative radial nerve palsy, non-union, deterioration of shoulder function, and constant pain. The management in some type-B fractures with transverse or short oblique fracture-lines which are difficult to align, even with a well-fixed humeral component is the main endeavour. If surgical treatment is considered, especially in type-B fractures with a loose prosthesis, a replacement with a revision long-stem component and additionally a plate fixation (LCP) and bicortical and unicortical screws (with or) without cable wiring should be used to obtain secure fixation. In type-B fractures with a stable implant the use of limited compression interlocking plate (LCP) combined with a bone autograft in order to maximize the healing potential and additional cer-clage fixation in the proximal and distal fragment if necessary should be considered.3,4 PM007 Lateral Entry Fixation Using Three Divergent Pins for Diplaced Paediatric Supracondylar Fractures S. P. Guy, R. R. Ponnuru, S. Gella, N. Tulwa 1 1 Orthopaedics & Trauma, Pinderfields General Hospital, Wakefield, UK Introduction: Supracondylar fractures are the commonest elbow injury in children. There are numerous debated methods of treatment in the literature. Most displaced supracondylar fractures are manipulated closed and held with a medial / lateral entry or two lateral Kirschner wires. The aim is to prevent the reduction slipping (causing cosmetic deformity and functional restriction) and iatrogenic nerve injury. This clinical study has results purely from a three lateral divergent wire technique. Material and Methods: Under a general anaesthetic displaced supracondylar fractures were manipulated closed and three lateral divergent wires inserted. Note was made of pre-operative neurovascular compromise and any iatrogenic nerve injuries. Primary study end points were range of movement and carrying angle relative to the contralateral uninjured elbow (Flynn's grading system) and presence of iatrogenic nerve injury. Results: 25 children between 3 and 10 years (median 5, range 3-10) suffered a displaced fracture (15 type III, 10 type IIB). 15 left, 10 right sided fractures. 14 boys and 11 girls. 23 were fixed primarily, of these 21 in the first 24 hours. 2 were delayed due to swelling. 2 were fixed secondarily with lateral k-wires after loss of position and had been fixed primarily with crossed wire technique by other consultants. One radial and one median nerve injury sustained at injury settled. No iatrogenic nerve injuries occurred. 21 Excellent, 3 good and 1 poor result on Flynn's grading. Conclusion: The use of three wires on the lateral side is a safe method for improving fracture stability and decreasing iatrogenic nerve injury. References: Skaggs D, Pershad J.

Britten 1 1 Trauma and Orthopaedics, Leeds General Infirmary, Leeds, UKIntroduction: A thorough secondary survey following ATLS principles is always needed to plan surgical intervention in the multiply injured patient. We report a case that highlights this need and identifies the potential problem of relying on the assessment performed by other professionals. Material and Methods: Case report: A 34 year old attempted suicide by jumping from a 10-metre bridge and presented to the emergency department with multiple injuries, including an open distal humerus fracture with a 60mm wound overlying the fracture site. Paramedics presented a 70 x 18mm segment of bone found at the scene to the trauma team. X-rays showed metaphyseal fragmentation and indicated a segment of bone loss. Wound debridement and temporary external fixation was carried out. Care of the patient was subsequently taken over by the limb reconstruction team but at the second wound exploration and debridement bone loss was not readily apparent. Subsequent analysis to identify the bone segment revealed that it was not human and was likely to be porcine tibial shaft.Results: The segment of animal bone found at the scene and degree of fragmentation on x-ray led to an erroneous diagnosis of an open fracture with bone loss. A more thorough assessment would have identified that clinical and radiological signs did not support this diagnosis. A better understanding of the injury pattern would have helped plan definitive surgical fixation.Conclusion: Bone fragments brought with a patient do not always indicate an open fracture with bone loss. A meticulous secondary survey of the traumatised patient is needed before planning surgical treatment. Disclosure: No significant relationships. PM009 An Original Locking Plate System for Complex Fractures of the Distal Humerus J. Imatani 1 1 Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama Saiseikai General Hospital, Okayama, Japan Introduction: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a new ONI Elbow Plate System for complex fractures of the distal humerus. Material and Methods: Twenty-two patients with displaced multifragmentary fractures of the distal humerus were treated by our new fixation system. Group I (13 young adult patients, mean age 27.1 years, range 16 to 52 years), fracture type AO C1: 7 cases, C2: 5 cases, C3: 1 case. Group II (9 elder patients, mean age 77.0 years, range 70 to 88 years), fracture type AO C1: 5 cases, C2: 3 cases, C3: 1 case. The ONI transcondylar plate conforms to the anatomical contour of the lateral column of the distal humerus and a locking mechanism between the plate portion and the transcondylar screw and the ONI medial plate conforms to the anatomical contour of the medial one. All of the fractures were fixed by an ONI plate and the transcondylar screw which passed from the lateral epicondyle to the medial wall of the trochlea across the humeral condyle. We used the ONI plate at the lateral side of the fracture site in all cases, and either a cannulated cancellous screw (n=8) or an AO one-third tubular plate (n=9) or the ONI medial plate (n=5) at the medial side of the fracture site. The mean period of follow up was 32 months (24 to 48 months). Results: In all of the 22 cases, complete union was seen on radiographs, and alignment was almost maintained postoperatively. The assessment of results according to the modified Cassebaum's rating score was 94.6 in Group I and 90.4 in Group II. There were no cases of nonunion or malunion. Conclusion: Our data showed that the ONI elbow system for treatment of complex fractures of the distal humerus produced consistently good results even in cases with a small osteoporotic fragment of the distal humerus.

Zhezherya 3 1 Trauma, City Hospital 15, Moscow, Russian Federation, 2 Trauma, City Hospital 15, Moscow, Russian Federation, 3 Trauma, City Hospital 81, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Severe multi fragmental fractures of distal part of the shoulder. can cause upper extremity dysfunction and disability. Material and Methods: 8 patients aged 22-58 with elbow trauma and its effects underwent endoprosthetic replacement in time period of 1 month up to 4 years after injury. Effects of severe multi fragmental humuers condyle fractures were indications for treatment. Before replacement two patients received conservative treatment (reposition of displacement, plaster splint).One open fracture was managed by surgical debridement with external fixation. In two cases pin and plate osteosynthesis was applied inappropriately; the treatment was effected by repeat dislocation of fragments and elbow contracture.Two cases involved additional pin and K-wire fixation of the lateral epicondyle, which required two weeks immobilization of the upper extremity. Results: 7 patients were assessed at long term -from six months to 5 years-follow-up. We obtained good results in seven cases. Only one patient with a 4 year old injury reported satisfactory results, complaining at a moderate pain under physical activity and pour movement amplitude. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the value of endoprosthetic elbow replacement in providing recovery of upper limb function in case of severe injury of the distal part of the shoulder.

Fasolini Chirurgia, Ospedale Regionale Mendrisio, Mendrisio, Switzerland Introduction: Radial head fractures are the most common fractures occurring around the elbow, associated fractures and ligament injuries are common. Traumatic lesions of peripheral nerves represent a rare type of complications in radial head fractures. In acute fractures spontaneous neurological remission usually occurs after reduction of the dislocated radial head. Material and Methods: We report two cases of neurological deficiency of anterior interosseus nerve, branch of median nerve, in two women after open reduction and internal fixation of radial head. This operation was performed in our hospital during year 2008 with an interval of two months by two different surgeons. The initial Injury was a dislocated fracture of radial head. At clinical examination before operation the patients didn't have any neurological deficit. Post-surgery recovery showed palsy of the anterior interosseus nerve in the two patients. In both cases EMG and ENG were performed and confirmed specific block of conduction of the 2 nerves. Results: Conservative treatment including intensive physiotherapy and electrotherapy for three months was successful. Full neurological recovery was obtained after 3 months for one patient and after 6 months for the other. Conclusion: Anterior Interosseus nerve injury is a very rare complication after radial head surgery. In the literature we founf 2 similar reports(4 cases). In our cases, this complication is due probably to a soft tissue distraction during operation. therefore It is very important to treat tissues around the bone with gentle handling, never forget to use proper tissue distractor.

Ring 3 1 Hand and Upper Extremity Department, Massachussetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA, 2 Hand and Upper Extremity Department, Massachussetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Boston, USA, 3 Hand and Upper Extremity Department, Massachussetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA Introduction: This report describes the non-operative treatment of six patients with fracture of the anteromedial facet of the coronoid process. Material and Methods: We identified and reviewed the medical records of six patients with a non-operatively treated O'Driscoll Type II anteromedial facet fracture of the coronoid. Clinical outcome was evaluated using the Broberg and Morrey rating system. Three patients that returned for a medium long-term research specific followup were also evaluated with the ASES Self-Report Form, DASH Outcome Measure and the MEPI. Results: All three patients that returned for follow-up regained full or near full elbow flexion and full or near full forearm rotation. Two patients had a MEPI score of 100 points, one patient scored 40 points. According to the MEPI classification system there were 2 excellent (66.6%) and 1 poor (33.3%). According to the Broberg and Morrey system all patients had an excellent result. Two patients scored 100 points on the ASES score, and one patient scored 56 points. The DASH scores were 0 points, 2.5 points and 49.1 points respectively. Conclusion: Anteromedial facet fractures can be very subtle injuries, and we recommend careful evaluation and management. Non-operative treatment can be considered if subluxation is ruled out and the fracture is small and minimally, which may be most reliably documented using sophisticated imaging such as computed tomography with three-dimensional reconstructions.

Material and Methods: In a study period of one year, one hundred consecutive patients with a suspected scaphoid fracture but no fracture on scaphoid radiographs were evaluated with CT within 24 hours of injury and bone scintigraphy between three to five days after injury. The reference standard for a true (radiographic occult) scaphoid fracture was either 1) diagnosis of fracture on both CT and bone scintigraphy, or 2) in case of discrepancy, clinical and/or radiographic evidence of a fracture. Results: CT showed 10 scaphoid and 18 other fractures. Bone scintigraphy showed 21 scaphoid and 36 other fractures. According to the reference standard there were 14 scaphoid fractures. CT had a sensitivity of 64%, specificity of 99%, accuracy of 94%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 90% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94%. Bone scintigraphy had a sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 91%, accuracy of 91%, a positive predictive value of 62% and a negative predictive value of 99%. Conclusion: This study could not confirm that early CT imaging is superior to bone scintigraphy for suspected scaphoid fractures. The use of bone scintigraphy for triage of suspected scaphoid fractures might lead to substantial overtreatment. CT is more accurate but risks undertreatment of 36% of patients.

Material and Methods: Were identified retrospectively 25 cases of fracture dislocation. We analyze epidemiological characteristics, type of treatment received and complications. We carry out a functional assessment through scales QUICK DASH and MAYO WRIST SCORE and study the range of movement. Results: In 14 cases was associated significant systemic injury. The most frequent pattern was the transcaphoid perilunate fracture dislocation with 10 cases.We compared a protocolized treatment with open reduction and internal fixation and repair of capsulogigamental parts with a heterogeneous set of treatments that do not include all these elements. The average follow-up was 35 months. The average score of scales QUICK DASH for non protocolized processing and protocolized were respectively 82 and 53 and for the MAY WRIST SCORE 54 and 78. We found a tendency to better clinical outcomes in the patients in the protocolized group of treatment.Conclusion: Treatment schedules currently accepted recommend the open reduction and internal fixation with capsuloligamental repair.",

Handolin 2 1 Surgery, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland, 2 Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland, 3 Pediatric Surgery, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, FinlandIntroduction: Pediatric pelvic ring fractures are rare, but the associated morbidity is high. The mortality of patients with pelvic ring fracture is lower in children than in adults. The aim of the present study was to evaluate pelvic ring fracture-associated life-threatening hemorrhage in children (0-16 years). Material and Methods: We identified all pediatric pelvic ring fractures treated in Helsinki University Central Hospital in a 10-year period(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007). All available pre-and in-hospital medical records were reviewed. The collected data consisted of patient characteristics, the mechanism of injury, vital signs, results of laboratory tests, given care, diagnosed other injuries, and the 30-day survival. We identified 71 pediatric patients (40 males) with pelvic fractures (median age 14, range 1-16 years). Traffic accident was the most common mechanism of injury (69%). The average vital signs on admission were: systolic blood pressure 120 mmHg, heart rate 102/ min, and Glasgow Coma Scale 15. Results: Total of 4 patients had life-threatening bleeding and only in 2 patients the source of massive bleeding was pelvis. One patient required emergency surgery and angioembolization for pelvic bleeding. Pelvic ring fractures were surgically treated in 25 patients. 35 patients did not need any operative treatment for their injuries. Two patients died for head injuries, and no patient died for exsanguination. Conclusion: We conclude that a life-threatening hemorrhage from pelvic ring fracture is rare (5.6%) and does not contribute to the overall mortality. The mortality was low (2.8%) and was due to head injuries. Disclosure: No significant relationships. PM020 Fractures of the Pubic Rami Can Be Life-Threatening Injuries -A Case Report C. Smith 1 , A. Vasireddy 2 , R. Koka 3 1 Emergency Medicine, Kings College Hospital, London, UK, 2 Dept of Orthopaedics, University Hospital Lewisham, London, UK, 3 Dept of Orthopaedics, Eastbourne District General Hospital, Eastbourne, UKIntroduction: Fractured pubic rami are common in the elderly population, most of which heal without event. We report a case of massive retroperitoneal haemorrhage associated with a right superior pubic ramus fracture, causing haemodynamic instability in a patient receiving antiplatelet therapy.Material and Methods:A 77 year-old woman was admitted following a mechanical fall to the right side. Medical history included ischaemic heart disease treated with both aspirin and clopidogrel. Admission haemoglobin was 9.8 g/dL; she was pale and hypotensive. She was complaining of lower abdominal pain with a suprapubic mass, and had signs of peritonism but a clinically stable pelvis.Results: An urgent CT of her abdomen and pelvis was performed, revealing a mixed attenuation retroperitoneal mass consistent with a haematoma. There was also a comminuted fracture of the right superior pubic ramus. No other retroperitoneal or abdominal source for the bleeding was identified. Repeat haemoglobin was 6.1 g/dL and she was transfused 4 units of packed red cells, FFP and platelets. Her haemoglobin stabilised and she went on to make a full recovery after restarting both aspirin and clopidogrel.Conclusion: This case illustrates the importance of eliciting a detailed medical and drug history, as well as the dangers of anti-platelet drugs in a normally benign fracture.

T\u00f8ndevold 1 1 Dpt. of Orthopedic Surgery, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark Introduction: Traumatic hip dislocation (THD) is a true orthopaedic emergency. We present the incidence of total hip replacement (THR) following THD in a 10-year series with at least 1-year follow up. Material and Methods: Patients admitted to Rigshospitalet from 1.1.1995 to 31.12.2007 with THD, were identified in hospital records as ICD10 = ''S73.0''. Available admission radiographs were reviewed, fractures were classified according to the AO classification. Patients who subsequently went on to have a THR on the affected side were identified through the Danish Hip Register. The remaining patients were contacted for a phone interview incl. EQ-5D and the pain/function sections of Harris Hip Score (HHS) (max. score 91). Results: Thirty-one patients (25 male, 6 female) were identified, mean age 39 years (18-75). One had an anterior dislocation. Of the posterior dislocations, 16 were associated with acetabular fracture, 3 with femoral head fracture and 5 with acetabular and femoral head fractures. In 24 cases closed reduction was performed (all within 24hrs); unsuccessfully in 5 cases. Sixteen had traction applied. Surgery was performed after an average of 3 days (1-8): 20 ORIF of acetabular fracture, 1 ORIF of femoral head fracture and 1 primary THR. Early complications were: Sciatic nerve palsy (8 patients, all with acetabular fracture), wound infection (4 patients), pulmonary embolism (1 patient). Mean follow up was 67 months (17-126). Two patients had died of cancer. Seven patients had a THR, 2 with femoral head fracture, 3 with acetabular fracture, 2 with acetabular and femoral head fractures. Nineteen patients were interviewed: Median HHS 79%. The patients without fracture had a higher HHS, median 93% (p=0.15, Mann-Whitney U test); none of these had a THR. Conclusion: Traumatic hip dislocation resulted in total hip replacement in 7 out of 31 patients. Traumatic hip dislocation without fracture did not lead to total hip replacement within 27-118 months. The morbidity following traumatic hip dislocation is in large part determined by the associated fractures. References: Bhandari M, Matta J, Ferguson T, Matthys G.

The trauma required to produce a dislocation can vary from minimal to severe high-energy forces. Anterior dislocation of the hip in this age group is to be considered a serious injury. Material and Methods: We report a case of anterior hip dislocation in an 8 years old boy who suffered a hit by a car. The child's hip was reduced under general anaesthesia without delay (1 hour after the injury) and without sequelae. MRI examination after reduction revealed haematoma associated with partial rupture of the obturator externus muscle and adductor minimus muscle, without other associated lesions. After the reduction, the child was submitted to skin traction with adhesive strapping for 15 days. Subsequently, gradual weight bearing was allowed.Results: After 1 year, functional result of the hip was good without restriction of physical activity of this child. The radiographic and MRI examination showed normal hip joints. Conclusion: Despite the severe intensity of the trauma, the fact that it was an anterior dislocation without associated injuries (fractures and open dislocation) and the child had the dislocation reduced promptly, possibly contributed to the good result obtained in the follow-up. A review of the literature shows that, if the diagnosis and an immediately reduction are delayed, the morbidity, such as avascular necrosis or osteoarthritis of the femoral head, may be significant. A poor prognosis is conferred by trauma of considerable intensity, the presence of fractures associated with the dislocation, open dislocation, delayed reduction and advanced skeletal maturity of the patient.

Enikeev 2 1 Trauma, City Hospital 15, Moscow, SD, Russian federation, 2 Trauma, City Hospital 15, Moscow, Russian federation Introduction: Avascular necrosis of the femoral hip is main reason of pure results of acetabular reconstructions. Material and Methods: During the last 8 years total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been done in 23 cases of old and nonunion acetabular fractures.Mostly surgery was performed due to the avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head, which happened in time period of 10 months up to 4 years after the primary acetabular reconstruction. Just in 3 cases we faced redisplacement of bone fragments with hip subluxation. In these cases cemented acetabular cups and reinforcement rings were used. Surgery was performed via the Kocher-Langenbeck's approach to hip joint. If the anatomical reconstruction of acetabulum was achieved and bone quality was satisfactory, large heads, metal-metal bearing THA was used. In other cases, traditional cementless cups with additional screw fixation were implanted. 4 patients with old T-type acetabular fractures were operated on in 6 months up to 2 years after injury by using the acetabular reconstruction and THA simultaneously. These operations were performed via two surgical approaches. It allowed us to expose the fracture well, perform stabile osteosynthesis without the devascularization of bone fragments and conclude the surgery with THA.Results: Satisfactory results and implant stability were assessed in each case of THA at 1-5 year's follow up. Conclusion: THA provides a possibility to use a new generation of implants in cases of posttraumatic hip arthritis after primary anatomical acetabular reconstruction. When old acetabular fractures with AVN of the femoral head are operated, simultaneous pelvis reconstruction and THA could be done. Disclosure: No significant relationships. PM024 Total Hip Arthroplasty After Operative Treatment of Acetabulum Fractures S. Arbes 1 , H. Widhalm 1 , M. Greitbauer 1 , V. V\u00e9csei 2 1 Traumatology, Vienna Medical School, Vienna, Austria, 2 Department of Trauma Surgery, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria Introduction: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical results of total hip arthroplasty in patients with post-traumatic osteoarthrosis after internal fixation of a displaced acetabular fracture. Special attention was paid to the frequency of technical difficulties and the risk of postoperative complications. Material and Methods: The pattern of the acetabular fracture was classified according to the system of Letournel. 15 of the acetabular fractures were sustained in a motor-vehicle accident and two were the result of a fall from height. Secondary arthroplasty was performed without cement through an anterolateral approach in seventeen hips at a mean age of 53.6 years (range, 27-81 years); bone graft was used in 3 patients. The mean age of the patients at the time of injury was 42 years (range, 26-71 years). Time between primary surgery and secondary arthroplasty was 12.1 years (range 1-31 years). Heterotopic bone was classified preoperatively according to Brooker in 4 grades. Results: Harris hip score showed 55.2 points preoperatively. According to Brooker, preoperatively, 7 patients were graded I, 6 patients grade II, 4 grade III and 1 patient grade IV. Three procedures were associated with operative complications; screws or plates from primary surgery had to be removed in 4 patients. Three patients had a revision; all of them were performed because of aseptic loosening of one or both components (two acetabular and one femoral component). Conclusion: In summary, the present study demonstrates that total hip arthroplasty after previous operative treatment of an acetabular fracture is often more difficult than a routine total hip arthroplasty because of extensive scar tissue, heterotopic bone, retained internal fixation devices, and deformity of the acetabular bone. Despite these difficulties, the clinical outcome was good in most patients and the rate of complications was moderate. References: Weber M. et al.

Mortelmans 3 1 Urgentiegeneeskunde, UZ Leuven, Rotselaar, Belgium, 2 Urgentiegeneeskunde, UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, 3 Urgentiegeneeskunde, Klina Brasschaat, Brasschaat, BelgiumIntroduction: Clearing the cervical spine in the emergency room remains an enormous challenge. Although the use of computed tomography scan in routine trauma evaluation of the cervical spine is advocated in the literature, the classical three-view X-rays still remain the basis of cervical spine evaluation as recommended in the ATLS guidelines. In 1984, Harris et al. described an oval, ringshaped, cortical density superimposed upon the superoposterior body of the axis in the lateral view could be of a great help in identifying low odontoid fractures. The Harris ring! Material and Methods: A series of 12 CT scan confirmed isolated low-axis fractures from our own level one trauma centre practice archive and 13 CT negative controls on lateral cross-table cervical spine X-rays were presented randomly to 17 training residents and five experienced trauma radiologists with knowledge of the axis ring sign. The effect of the education on the fracture identification rate in the three resident groups was evaluated with the nonparametric Wilcoxon ranking test.Results: The specificity and sensitivity of the axis ring sign used by experienced radiologists was between 72-91% and 80-96%, respectively, and a DOR of 31.74 (4-63.08) was calculated. They scored a PPV of 86% (77-95%) and a NPV of 84% (74-93%). The Wilcoxon ranking test revealed a significant effect of education in all three resident groups (traumatologists P=0.0008, emergency medicine P=0.0005 and neurosurgery P=0.0087).Conclusion:In conclusion, we would state that the axis or Harris ring is a forgotten but useful diagnostic and educational tool in identifying low odontoid fractures and that it should be incorporated in all X-ray-based cervical spine clearing protocols.PM026 Comparison of the Effects of Surgical Approaches on the Local Kyphosis Angle in Vertebral FracturesC.

Decisions must be made before complete information is available. Such stressfull situations increase the risk of human failure. The science of teamwork training has been studied in commercial aviation for the past 20 years. Cockpit Resource Management (CRM) and decisionmaking methods like FORDEC were developed after it was identified that 70% of aircraft-related fatalities were a result of human error and poor teamwork. The aviation industry's success in reducing critical errors has spared many lives. Mistakes are inherent in human nature. Mistakes can be minimized by following a standardized approach. Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) is one such approach in trauma care. With over 1 million certified physicians worldwide, the ATLS concept is one of the most successful international education programs. The concept is simple, priorityorientated assessment (ABCDE-Scheme) of the trauma patient, based on vital signs, with immediate treatment of life threatening injuries.Material and Methods: With over 100 ATLS provider courses and 10 instructor courses accomplished in less than 6 years; never before has such a course been implemented in such a short time as in Germany. Meanwhile, nearly 1600 physicians are trained and certified.The post course evaluations of the first 100 ATLS Courses in Germany were analyzed. Each provider student in the course had to score the different parts of the course and the overall impression. The grading range was 1 to 4 (1=very good, 4=very poor). Results: The over all evaluation of all 100 courses shows an impressive 1.37 [1.13-1.74, n=100]. The specific parts of the courses are graded as follows: Presentations 1.62 [1.0-2.37, n=100], Practical Skills Stations 1.44 [1.0 -2.4, n=100], Surgical Skills Stations 1.35 (1.06-1.64, n=100). Conclusion: The educational concept is multidisciplinary, with physicians from various fields working together in the trauma room, speaking the same language: ATLS!

Klinikum Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt, Germany Introduction: In the last three decades Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) has become the most successful training course for early clinical management of multiple injured patients all over the world. However, in order to implement ATLS principles into clinical routine especially in an emergency department (ED), it seems necessary to introduce an interdisciplinary interprofessional training program. The question arise, whether an extensive training for every member of the stuff is necessary in a level I trauma centre. Material and Methods: Trauma evaluation and management (TEAM) was originally developed for the training of undergraduate students in ATLS algorithm. The lecture of TEAM was the theoretical basis for 2 hours hands on training with stuff of the ED including trauma surgeons, anaesthesiologists, radiologists, nurses and paramedics. The simulation training was performed in the original environment of the ED with 3 Manikins (Resusci Anne, Laerdal). A questionnaire assessed the basic knowledge and the stuff's expectation about the training. Results: Within 10 months 44 physicians and 32 nurses participated in the TEAM training. 85 % of the participants affirmed an improvement of their knowledge concerning ATLS principles and rated the course program to be good or excellent. Therefore TEAM training is now introduced in routine education of stuff in the ED. Conclusion: TEAM is an optimal basis for interdisciplinary interprofessional training program in every ED managing multiple injured patients. It is highly appreciated by all members of the staff and is expected to reduce communication deficits and improve performance. Disclosure: No significant relationships. PM032 Analysis of Triage Errors During the Implementation of a Tiered Trauma Response Protocol I. Mart\u00ednez-Casas, J. Sancho, X. Crous, S. L\u00f3 pez-Gordo, E. Membrilla, M. Pons, L. Grande Servicio De Cirug\u00eda General Y Digestiva, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain Introduction: It has been stated that among 5 to 10% of stable trauma patients without any apparent lesion can be severely injured. An over-triage rate of 30% to 50% is recommended to capture 90% or more of severely injured patients. Tiered response algorithms have proven efficacy and cost-effectiveness in the management of trauma patients. The aim of our study was to analyze the causes and characteristics of the triage failures that occurred during the implementation of a tiered trauma response protocol in a University Hospital. Material and Methods: Since January 2006 to March 2009, 876 trauma patients were attended in our emergency department. Of those, only 247 were evaluated in this study: 207 were assessed retrospectively (period 2006-2008) and 40 consecutive patients were included prospectively(2009). Four types of triage failure were defined: Infra-triage, infra-activation, inadequate attendance and misdiagnosis.Results: Patients were mainly males (79%), mean age 42\u00c2 \u00b120 years. Mean Injury Severity Score was 9\u00c2 \u00b19. Nineteen percent of patients had ISS\u00e2 &\u00a516. There were 11% penetrating injuries and 55% of patients sustained some degree of brain injury. One hundred and thirty five patients (54%) required hospitalization with a mean stay of 6\u00c2 \u00b110 days. Forty-four patients (18%) went to surgery and 42 (17%) were admitted to Intensive Care Unit. Mortality was 4% (10 patients). Eighty and five triage failures were detected (44 infratriages, 16 infra-activations, 16 inadequate attendances and 9 misdiagnosis). There were no significant differences among patients with or without triage errors regarding patient sex (P=0.6), study periods (P=0.08), time of admission (P=0.63), or hospital stay (6.1\u00c2 \u00b17 vs. 6.4\u00c2 \u00b111 days; P=0.8). In our series, triage failures tend to occur in older patients (47 vs. 40 years; P=0'02) and they were concentrated in aggressions and accidental falls (P=0.002). Triage errors were not associated mortality (P=0.52). The mechanism of injury more frequently associated with mortality was fall from height (P=0.02). Most patients with infra-triage had inclusion criteria related to their medical history (advised criteria), and the situation with higher mortality rates was the combination of physiologic and those advised criteria (P=0.008).Conclusion: The triage errors detected during the implementation of a strict tiered trauma response protocol had no repercussion in mortality. To avoid those triage failures, special attention must be paid to older patients, aggressions and accidental falls. Disclosure: No significant relationships. PM033 Utility of the Tertiary Survey in the Incidence of Missed Injuries in Trauma Patients S. Montmany 1 , S. Navarro 1 , P. Rebasa 1 , A. Luna 2 , C. G\u00f3 mez 2 , J. Hermoso 2 1 General Surgery, Corporaci\u00f3 Sanit\u00e0 ria Parc Taul\u00ed, Sabadell, Spain, 2 General Surgery, Corporaci\u00f3 Sanit\u00e0 ria Parc Taul\u00ed, Sabadell, Spain Introduction: The missed injuries and the clinically significant missed injuries have a high incidence in trauma patients. The application of tertiary survey can reduce the incidence of these injuries. Material and Methods: Prospective study that includes all trauma patients over 16, admitted in critical area and that excludes patients who die before this admission. A missed injury is an injury which is detected after the first 24 h of the traumatism. Clinically significant missed injuries are serious missed injuries which can cause complications, to change a treatment or even the death of the patient. Since March 2009, we apply a protocol where tertiary survey is done in all trauma patients after the primary and secondary surveys but in the first 24 h of the traumatism. Results: Until October 2009, 84 trauma patients have been registered with the application of the protocol of the tertiary survey, with an ISS of 25.8. 4 patients have been excluded because they died before the admission. The tertiary survey has been done in the 94.2% of the patients. This group of patients has been compared with control group composed to 121 trauma patients, with an ISS of 19.55, prospectively registered between January 2006 and February 2007 when tertiary survey was not applied.",

            "text": "Material and Methods: This prospective study was conducted on five F&O outpatient clinics in the Netherlands. We included all patients \u2021 50 years who presented with a recent clinical fracture at the F&O outpatient clinic. Exclusion criteria were dementia and pathological fractures. To measure BMD, patients underwent a DXA scan. Evaluation of demographic data and other clinical fracture risk factors were collected during the visit at the outpatient clinic by a specialised fracture nurse. BMD was categorised according to World Health Organization (WHO) definitions. Fractures were categorised by ICD 9 encoding. ANOVA and chi-square tests were used to process the data. Results: In total, 7199 patients were included, 76% women. Mean age was 66.7 years, women vs. men 67.4 vs. 64.4 (P<0.001). The majority of patients sustained a radius/ulna fracture (26%). Moreover, many patients had sustained humerus fractures (12%), hand fractures (12%) and foot fractures (12%). Fracture locations were not similar between sexes, men showed more hand (16%), radius/ ulna (15%) and foot (11%) fractures compared to women: radius/ ulna: 29%, humerus fracture: 13% and foot fractures 12%. In total, 50% of all fractures could be classified as major osteoporotic (spine, forearm, hip and shoulder) according to the Fracture Risk Assessment (FRAX) tool. 21% of all patients had at least one other previous fracture before the fracture they presented with this time. Osteoporosis (T-score \u00a3 -2.5) was found in 35% of all women and 23% of all men. Overall, 47% of the patients had osteopenia and 32% had osteoporosis. The highest incidence of osteoporosis was found in patients with hip (45%) and pelvis (44%) fractures. However, the majority of fractures were seen in patients with osteopenia. Conclusion: In elderly patients with a recent clinical fracture, this multidisciplinary approach diagnosed in 35% of all women and 23% of all men a BMD in the osteoporotic range. Fifty percent of all fractures seen at the outpatient clinics are regarded as major osteoporotic. These results indicate the importance of F&O outpatient clinics. Further studies are needed to clarify whether these clinics might have an effect on subsequent fracture risk reduction.Disclosure: No significant relationships.

This project aims to to see if comparisons in polytrauma management between Scotland and Germany can be made through analysis of data from the Scottish Trauma Audit Group (STAG) and the German Trauma Registry(GTR). Material and Methods: Data analysis was carried out on all retrospectively identified trauma patients from the STAG and the GTR from 2000-2002. Data on epidemiologic parameters, pre-hospital interventions, cornerstones of timeline and patient outcome were collected and combined. Data was then subjected to statistical analysis using student's t-test and chi-squared tests with level of significance set at p < 0.05. Results: 227 patients from the STAG trauma registry and 6878 patients from the GTR were used in our study.Significant differences in Injury Severity Scores (ISS) between both groups were noted with average scores of 24.9 and 29.8 in Scottish and German patients respectively. There was a significantly higher rate of pre-hospital interventions in the German group. Pre-hospital times in the Scottish group (247 +/-343 min) were significantly longer than that in the German group (73 +/-41 min). Interestingly, percentage mortality during treatment was noted at 23.8% in the Scottish group and 22.2% in the German group and was not significantly different between both study populations. Conclusion: Despite the significant differences demonstrated, data from our study does not serve to indicate preference of the Scottish paramedic pre-hospital trauma care system over the physician driven German one or vice versa and does not give indication as to whether pre-hospital BLS or ALS is more advantageous to trauma patients. Further research is required in the form of prospective, randomized, controlled trials.Disclosure: No significant relationships. PM038 A Year in the Department of Emergency Medicine University Hospital Center Zagreb: A View on Traumatized Patients T. Zigman, S. Davila Surgery, University hospital center Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia Introduction: Our objective was to determine a number of injured patients attending Department of emergency medicine University Hospital Center Zagreb, and it's ratio to total number of patients refferd to surgery of our department, in one year depending on week day, month, season, and some enviromental factors as weather conditions and moon changes. Material and Methods: A retrospective study of patients attending Department of emergency medicine University Hospital Center Zagreb in one year period. For comparison we analyzed one year more. We also used public data of the State's meteorology department. We divided patients according to the age group (we also included children) and severity of trauma. Results: We used multivariate analysis to analyze our data and found significant correlations of number of visits according to week day, month, season, weather conditions, and in some cases lunar phases. Conclusion: In our effort to predict the unpredictable, we found some correlations which can improve planning of work in Emergency department. This study may be a introduction to a larger epidemiological study, which could decrease the chaos in some cases still immanent in this field of medicine. Disclosure: No significant relationships. PM039 Trauma Patterns in the United Arab Emirates: Data from Hospital-Based Trauma Registry Material and Methods: A total number of 10777 trauma patients admitted to our level 1 trauma centre between 1997-2006 were included in the analysis. The probability of survival for each patient was calculated if required data were present using the respective formulas of the prediction models of the Major Trauma Outcome Study (MTOS), Trauma Audit & Research Network (TARN) and Base Excess Injury Severity Scale (BISS). Subsequently new coefficients were calculated by logistic regression based on this dataset. Finally, the existing BISS model was extended with the Glasgow Coma Scale and also tested. The discriminative power of all original and updated models was calculated for several subsets of patients using the area under the ROC-curve (AUC), a parameter for prediction accuracy ranging from 0.5 until 1.0. Results: Far most AUCs had a value of 0.8 or more. For the total population the TARN update 2007 model with new coefficients had the highest AUC (0.924). For the subset of patients in which all parameters for the various models were available the BISS model including GCS had the highest AUC (0.909). All models had a high discriminative power (AUC range 0.878 -0.990) if patients were younger than 55 years. In older patients, patients with severe head injury or intubated patients the discriminative power of the prediction models dropped. Conclusion: Relative simple models, like MTOS, TARN and BISS predict mortality pretty reliably. Each model tested in our study had specific advantages and disadvantages. Discrimination power strongly depended on the case mix. The accuracy to predict the chance of survival decreases in severely injured and older patients Head injury and comorbidity are likely to attribute to this phenomenon. Therefore adjustment for these factors in future models might be necessary. Disclosure: No significant relationships. PM041 Patterns of Injury Associated with Motor Vehicle Rollover Ejection S. R. Khoschnau 1 , J. Recicar 2 , K. Maull 2 1 Surgery, HMC, Section of Trauma Surgery, 3050, Qatar, 2 Surgery, HMC, Section of Trauma Surgery, Doha, Qatar Introduction: Despite having legislation, laws and decrees requiring safety belt usage, most developed and developing countries experience many motor vehicle crashes where drivers and occupants travel unrestrained. This underutilization of safety belts increases the likelihood of injury, especially when patients are involved in rollover ejection crashes. This study was intended to determine if predictable patterns of injury follow motor vehicle rollover crashes where occupants are ejected from the vehicle. Material and Methods: This was a retrospective review using the trauma registry for all patients admitted over a 2 year period (November 2007-November 2009). The data abstracted included demographics, crash characteristics, injury pattern data, operative procedures, mortality, and length of stay. Results: During the study period, 127 patients were admitted following ejection in rollover crashes. There were 118 men(93%) and 9 women(7%). The median age was 26 years. The location within the vehicle could not be determined in seven patients. Of the remainder, 65% were drivers and 35% were passengers. Two thirds of the crashes occurred at night. Injuries were severe (mean Injury Severity Score(ISS) = 21) and multisystem injuries occurred in 77%. Patients with multi-system injuries shared the following characteristics: 65% had head injuries, 3% had neck injuries, 39% had spinal injuries, 20% had facial fractures, 66% had chest injuries, 33% had abdominal injuries, 60% had extremity injuries and 22% had external injuries. Operative procedures were required in 38% with orthopaedic(17%), abdominal(8%) and neurosurgical(8%) procedures being the most common. Mean hospital length of stay(LOS) was 20 days. The mean ISS = 23 and in-hospital adjusted mortality rate was 25%. Patients with single system injuries had injuries involving the head(67%), spine(10%), abdomen(10%), extremities(3%) and external(10%). Operative procedures were required in only 2/29 patients. Single system injured patients experienced a mean LOS of 4.7 days. The mean ISS = 18 and in-hospital adjusted mortality was 21%. Patterns of injury were similar between drivers and passengers, although passengers tended to be less severely injured(ISS 19 vs 22) and had a lower incidence of head injury(54% vs 70%). Conclusion: Motor vehicle rollover ejection crashes cause injuries with high injury severity and result in multi-system injuries in most patients. Compared to those with single system injury, patients injured in crashes with multiple system involvement had increased hospital LOS and utilization of resources. Head injuries predominate, and appear to determine mortality, which was similar in both groups. Enhanced enforcement of current seatbelt laws, and the utilization of safety belts by all vehicle occupants may reduce the impact of such violent crashes. Disclosure: No significant relationships. PM042 Importance of Sledding Accidents in Wintersport-Accidents D. Heim 1 , K. Altgeld 2 1 Surgery, Hospital of Frutingen, Frutigen, Switzerland, 2 Orthop\u00e4 die, Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland Introduction: In wintersport-accidents skiing and snowboarding is mostly of importance, however sledding as sport is becoming more popular these last years and thus sledding accidents are increasing. What kind of injuries are encountered mostly in sledding accidents? Material and Methods: All wintersportaccidents are registered in our emergency departement since 1996/97. Analysis of the accidents is performed after each season Results: Since 1996/97 4274 wintersport-accidents have been registered. Most of them were due to skiing and snowboarding accidents. However 238 (5.6%) sledding accidents have been treated as well. The season the most busy was 2003/4 with 7%. Lesions at the lower extremity were the most frequent with 44%, followed by injuries at the upper extremity and head. Of all fractures lower leg and ankle fractures were treated more often than forearm-and collarbone fractures. 73% of all pateints were treated as outpatients, 27% as inpatients. Conclusion: Around 5% of all wintersportinjuries are due to sledding accidents. Injuries at the lower extremity (breaking) are most frequent. Our feeling over the years, that sledding accidents are increasing can not be confirmed with these datas. It is interesting to note, that sledding injuries have to be treated more often as in-patients than the rest of wintersport-patients. Disclosure: No significant relationships. Introduction: A history of fracture increases the risk of subsequent fractures and some fractures are associated with increased mortality. We evaluated the efficacy of implementation of guidelines for osteoporosis by a fracture nurse on incidence of subsequent fractures and mortality within 2 years in patients presenting with a fracture. Material and Methods: Two cohorts were compared: before (n = 1921)(1999-2001) and after intervention (n = 1413)(2004-2006). All patients were > 50 years. Pathological and vertebral fractures were excluded. All fractures were confirmed by radiography. Mortality was searched in the national obituary database. The intervention consisted of evaluation of bone and fall related fracture risks by a fracture nurse and accordingly treatment advice. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratio's (HR) for subsequent fracture incidence and mortality corrected for age, sex and baseline fracture location (major fractures: hip, pelvis, proximal tibia or humerus, multiple ribs and distal femur and minor fractures: all other fractures). Results: Groups differed at baseline for fracture location (before vs. after intervention: major 44.9% vs. 40.6% and minor 55.1% vs. 59.4%,p < 0.05). The absolute risk of a subsequent fracture decreased from 9.9% to 7.3%(p = 0.008). Multivariate analysis showed a risk reduction of 30% for a subsequent fracture (HR 0.70;95%CI: 0.55 -0.89). The mortality decreased from 17.9% to 11.4% (p < 0.001). Cox regression analysis indicated a risk reduction of 37% in mortality (HR 0.63; 95%CI:0.52 -0.76). After major fractures mortality decreased by 44% (HR 0.56; 95%CI:0.45.-0.69) (32.1% vs. 19.9%;p < 0.001). Mortality after minor fractures was lower and remained unchanged after intervention(6.2% vs. 5.7%).Conclusion: Fracture nurse risk assessment and intervention are associated with a decrease in subsequent fracture incidence and mortality. Due to the multifactorial nature of the assessment and intervention, it is unclear which part of this intervention is associated with the decrease in new fractures and mortality. Further research to clarify this is needed. Disclosure: No significant relationships. Traumatology, Canisius Wilhelmina Hospital, nijmegen, The Netherlands Introduction: Distal radius fractures are common bone fractures in the elderly. The Micronail (Wright Medical Technology) is a minimal invasive, intramedullary, titanium, fixed-angle, fixation method which combines the advantages of the existing fixation methods. This method is particular applicable in dislocated 2-part extra-articular and in minimal displaced 2-part intra-articular fractures. Material and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 20 distal radius fractures in 18 patients (17 women, median age 78 years, between January 2006 and December 2007) was conducted. All fractures were classified according to the AO-classification. We analysed x-rays, the clinical outcome (more then 1 year) and we described the surgical technique. Results: According to the AO-classification 12 patients sustained a A2-fracture, 2 patients an A3-fracture, 1 patient a B1-fracture and 1 patient a B3-fracture. 4 Patients sustained an antebrachii fracture. Average ASA-score was 2.4. Average surgical time was 46 minutes. All fractures consolidated without noteworthy loss of height. 1 Patient developed carpal tunnel syndrome and one Micronail dislocated secondarily. All patients experienced good post-operative function of the wrist and had nearly unrestricted range of motion 6 weeks after surgery. No infections or complications related to the osteosynthetic material appeared. Conclusion: Although still in a learning curve, this minimal-invasive technique seems appropriate in selected distal radius fractures and seems to combine the advantages of the existing fixation methods.References: R.W.P.M.

PM046 Volar Plating of Distal Radius Fractures With Acute Median Nerve Dysfunction \u00dc . Can, T. Lattmann, A. Platz Trauma Surgery, City Hospital Triemli, Zurich, Switzerland Introduction: The incidence of acute median nerve dysfunction following distal radius fracture is estimated at 4%. Controversy exists regarding the correct treatment of these patients. Urgent carpal tunnel release and direct volar plating is our concept to prevent persistent median nerve dysfunction or neuropathic pain syndrome. Material and Methods: Over a 5-year period distal radius fractures with clinical signs of median nerve dysfunction were surgically treated according our protocol consisting urgent release of the carpal tunnel and at the same time volar plating with 2.4 mm or 3.5 mm locking plate (Synthes) through the existing exposure. All patients after volar plating are prospectively controlled after 42, 90, 180 and 360 days in our follow up study. Results: From 2003 to 2007 we treated 1215 distal radius fractures: mm (17x) locking plates were used. Follow up of 20 patients showed complete normalization of median nerve function in 18 patients. In 2 Patients median nerve sensibility did not restore completely. CRPS II occurred in 1 of these patients. After 180 days mean PRWE was 15.3 (0.5 -64), mean grip strength was 90.5% (47 -200) of the contralateral side.Conclusion: In case of median nerve injury secondary to acute distal radius fracture urgent carpal tunnel release and simultaneous volar plating is an efficient concept in preventing persistent nerve dysfunction or even neuropathic pain syndrome. Nerve decompression and also definitive fracture stabilization can be done in one single operation reducing the risk of complications and prolonged hospital stay.Introduction: Buzzsaw injuries cause serious damages to the phalanxes and the hands with considerable secondary injuries and permanent affection of the function and the use of the hands. The goal of the present study is to identify possible predisposing factors and mechanisms which can lead to buzzsaw injuries, to be able to recommend effective prophylactic measures. Material and Methods: Data were grasped from all patients with buzzsaw injuries which were treated between November, 2005 and September, 2008 in the clinic for accident surgery, hand surgery and restoration surgery of the Saarland university. Data to the accident procedure, to work conditions, safeguarding measures and injury kind were evaluated statistically. Results: 44 male patients with buzzsaw injuries and an average age of 49 years were included. The most frequent injuries were traumatic amputations or partial amputations of single or several fingers (n = 22), followed by open fractures (n = 19",

Randl Traumatology, University Clinical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia Introduction: Majority of fractures in children is treated by closed reduction and casting, but femoral fractures are often indications for surgical treatment. The minimum amount of metal should be used, avoiding physeal plates if possible. I describe the case where external fixator proved to be a good alternative when K-wires fail. Material and Methods: 11 years old boy suffered distal femoral fracture (AO 33-A2) in a car accident. Closed reduction and osteosynthesis with 4 K-wires were performed. Additional support was provided with a plaster cast. 2 weeks after surgery osteosynthesis failed. Cast and K-wires were removed. External fixator was used to maintain reduction. 2 Schanz-screws were inserted in the distal fragment at the superior and inferior aspect of the physeal plate. Another 2 Schanz-screws were inserted in the diaphysis and tube fixator was assembled. Results: Osteosynthesis of distal metaphyseal femoral fracture with 4 K-wires and casting proved to be unsufficient. External fixator showed reliable fixation and allowed knee movement immediately. It was possible to insert Schanz-screws without penetrating the physeal plate. The fracture healed 8 weeks after second surgery. Conclusion: Considering proximity of physeal plate in distal metaphyseal femoral fractures in children, external fixator is a strong alternative to other osteosynthetic materials.

Material and Methods:During 2007During  -2008 we treated 21 patients with 16 tibia (7 complex distal tibia, 5 transverse and 4 comminuted shaft fractures) and 5 femoral fractures with delayed union, with a device using electromagnetic fields for 30 minutes per day. The mean age of the patients was 37 years (range 22 to 72 years).11 of the fractures were open type II and 5 type IIIa in Custillo's classification. 18 were smokers and 13 polytrauma patients. 13 were initially treated with external fixation, 6 with plating and 2 with intramedullary nailing. The average time after injury for treatment initiation was 4 months (3 to 6 month). Results: Healing was achieved in 17 patients (81%) in an average time of 2,5 months (1,5 to 6 months) while the rest patients underwent a new surgical procedure 4 months after no sign of healing progression was observed. Healing was determined to be completed when at least three cortices were bridged in radiographs and no motion or pain was seen clinically at the fracture site. No complications and no adverse reactions were observed. Conclusion: IIn cases of delayed union of carefully selected patients with many risk factors as smoking, severe osteoporosis, open fractures, severe complex fractures etc., use of electromagnetic fields seem to progress the healing process. That can save patients from a new surgical procedure with all the dangers and the complications that could be observed. However more randomized controlled trials or well-designed cohort studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of the use of electromagnetic fields in healing progression.treatment is reflected in decrease of fatal complications (renal failure, MSOF) and favorable local outcome.

Material and Methods: The wound was washed, and debrided. A plaster slab was made. The patient was admitted to the hospital and discharged only after soft tissue healing.Results: Four months after the accident, the x-ray showed delayed consolidation, with atrophic callus, mainly in the fibular malleolus, due to local bone loss. It was then decided to intervene surgically. Autologous unicortical iliac bone graft was harvested for completion of the fibular bone defect, followed by stabilization with a plate and screws. Iliac trabecular bone was placed in the tibial fracture, followed by osteosynthesis with screw.Conclusion: The authors present this case with a follow-up of 2 years, showing the clinical and radiological results.

Nevertheless, conversion to open cholecystectomy is required in cases for whom laparoscopic cholecystectomy cannot be safely proceeded and/or there are intraoperative complications. The present study aims to identify the preoperative risk factors in cases in whom conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy is performed and to reveal the intraoperative causes. and Methods: Retrospective examinations were made on a total of 370 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and 23 patients among them in whom conversion to open cholecystectomy was performed. Results: Dissection difficulty due to acute cholecytitis ranked first among the causes for conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy in 7(30.4%) patients.

Material and Methods: We report a four years experience on 167 cases of acute, istopatologically confirmed, cholecystitis treated laparoscopically. We divided the patient in three group: acute (49,1%), empiematuos (27,6%) and gangrenous (23,3%) cholecystitis. Results: We did not found any significant difference in complication rate comparing with literature. Our overall conversion rate is 3.5% all due to incomplete visualisation of the Calot's triangle. No conversion were performed in the ''acute'' cholecystitis group. PT011 Treatment of the Open Abdomen: Delayed Primary Closure by Means of VAC\u00d2-Therapy and Mesh-Mediated Fascial Traction? A Pilot Study F. Huysentruyt 1 , M. D'Hondt 2 , R. Snoeckx 2 , M. Misezer 2 1 UZ Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium, 2 UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium Introduction: Treatment of the open abdomen remains a complex and challenging surgical problem. Laparostomy treatment is associated with high morbidity and mortality numbers. It is crucial that delayed primary facial closure follows as early as safely possible. Many temporary abdominal closure (TAC) techniques have been proposed, however no clear consensus exists about the best method of treatment. Material and Methods: 7 patients were treated combining VAC\u00d2therapy with temporary mesh-mediated fascial traction (VAC\u00d2mesh technique). Every 4 days the VAC\u00d2 dressing was changed and the mesh tightened until delayed fascial closure was achieved. Results: 5 out of 7 patients suffered from severe peritonitis, The delayed primary fascial closure rate was 71,4 % Median number of VAC\u00d2-changes was 3, average duration of open abdominal treatment was 19 days. In-hospital mortality was 42,9 %, all resulting from multiple organ failure. Respiratory complications were common. 1 patient (14,3 %) developed an enterocutaneous fistula before VAC\u00d2-mesh application and was successfully managed with the VAC\u00d2-fistula technique. 14,3 % developed an intra-abdominal abscess following a necrotizing pancreatitis. One case was complicated with a leaking bowel anastomosis which did not result from the VAC\u00d2-mesh technique. Conclusion: This pilot study proves that TAC with the VAC\u00d2-mesh technique is both safe and feasible. Limited conclusions can be made concerning the superiority of the system compared to other closure methods. The technique might be especially helpful to achieve DPC in patients with prolonged open abdominal treatment and extensive loss of abdominal domain. Mortality and morbidity numbers were acceptable considering the severe underlying pathology. Long term results and further randomized clinical trials are warranted.

Rizos 2 , E. C. Tsimoyiannis 1 1 Surgery, G. Hatzikosta General Hospital, Ioannina, Greece, 2 Intensive Care Unit, G. Hatzikosta General Hospital, Ioannina, Greece Introduction: Description of a rare and life threatening complication following femoral vein puncture Material and Methods: 39 years old, female patient, with severe traumatic cranio-cerebral injury and left lung confusion transferred in our hospital's I.C.U following a neurosurgical operation. Patient had mechanical airway support through endotracheal intubation (under repressive and muscle relaxant medication), ventricular catheter for intracranial pressure (IAP) monitoring, central 3way femoral catheter and nasogastric tube. On the 2 nd day patient developed insipidus diabetes and electrolytic disturbances (hypernatremia). Fluids and total parenteric nutrition (T.P.N.), were administrated through the femoral catheter in order to restore the volume and correct the electrolytic disorders. Within the next hours abdominal inflation and rising of the intracranial pressure, about 45 cm H2O, were observed. An explorative laparotomy was then performed and 7lt of fluids similar to T.P.N were drained from the abdominal cavity Results: After surgery misplacement of the femoral catheter was diagnosed by contrast injection through the catheter (the upper end was into the peritoneal cavity while the proximal and the median in the femoral vein). Conclusion: Femoral vein catheterization is often carried out during resuscitation and in critical care units. It is usually achieved via a blind, external landmark-guided technique, through manual localization of the femoral vein. However, this approach can be challenging in patients with severe shock because of absence or ambiguity of the arterial pulse and can lead to life threatening complications. Apparently the eversion of the J guided wire, may lead to perforation of the femoral vein and consequently to the placement of the central femoral catheter into the peritoneal cavity, with catastrophic consequences.

We had to activate the Trauma Plan at the Traumatology Centre of the University Hospital Ostrava twice within one year. A crash of two tramways happened in April 2008 and an Intercity train crashed into a collapsed bridge under reconstruction in August of the same year.Most of the injured patients were treated in the Traumatology centre of the University Hospital Ostrava Material and Methods: Ostrava tramway disaster-11/APR/2008 87 passengers, 45 injured,two patients died on the disaster scene,23 of 45 patients were treated in Traumatology centre Ostrava,one patient died during resuscitation.7 patients were admitted in Traumatology centre hospital,3 patients had emergency surgery at the operating theatre Stud\u00e9 nka train disaster-8/AUG/2008 400 passengers, 67 injured, 7 patients died on the disaster scene, 24 from 67 patients were treated in Traumatology centre Ostrava, 15 patients were admitted in Traumatology centre hospital, 8 patients had emergency surgery at the operating theatre Results: After activation of Trauma Plan good coordination among EMS / triage on accident scene,transport patients/, emergency units of chosen hospitals and their Traumatology centre is necessary.In our centre, we have changed the system of team cooperation in the process of care provided for the injured patients, in case of tramway accidens it was one medical team consisting of one anaesthesiologist and two traumatologists provided the whole diagnostic algorithm, with a second team receiving the patien for surgical treatment. In case of the second railway accident, one medical team took over the patient at the Emergency Hall and, following the diagnostic stage, was also responsible for the surgical treatment at the operatin theatre.Thus, the need to pass on the information concerning the patients was eliminated Conclusion: Repeated activation of the Trauma Plan brings about an improvement in organisation of care provided for the injured patients.PT017 Minimally Invasive EsophagectomyImprovesOutcomes in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit A. E. Elsherif 1 , M. Fawzy 2 , M. Marashda 3 1 Surgery, Tawam Hospital/Johns Hopkins International, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, 2 Surgery, Tawam Hospital, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, 3 Surgery, Tawam Hospital/Johns Hopkins International, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates Introduction: Esophagectomy remains one of the technically challenging operations with a recently reported perioperative mortality up to 20%. The main goal of minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) is to decrease the high morbidity of traditional esophagectomy especially in the surgical intensive care unit. Developing the skills for MIE is associated with a steep learning curve. We report the first case series of MIE for esophageal cancer in the Middle East. Material and Methods: Five patients (two females) with esophageal cancer were included between January-October 2009, Standard preoperative staging lacked PET scan or upper endoscopic ultrasound. All patients underwent preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy followed by MIE. Perioperative morbidity and mortality in the surgical intensive care and short term outcomes were evaluated. Results: Three patients underwent Ivor Lewis MIE in the lateral decubitus position. Two patients underwent transhiatal MIE in the prone position. Median age was 51 years. Average operative time was seven hours. Average blood loss was 200 cc. There was no perioperative mortality. There was no morbidity in the Ivor Lewis group with a median intensive care stay of three days. One patient in the transhiatal group had pneumonia and ARDS, the other patient developed left recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis. Four patients had squamous cell carcinoma and one patient had adenocarcinoma. All surgical margins were free. All lymph nodes resected were negative for malignancy. Median follow up was 5.5 months. All patients are tolerating regular diet and gaining weight. One patient developed distant metastasis. Conclusion: Despite the learning curve, MIE is a reproducible technique. MIE is feasible following preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy. MIE can reduce the morbidity and mortality seen in the surgical intensive care after traditional open resection.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate a standardized treatment concept to manage different types of nonunions of the tibia with regard to their location within the tibia. Material and Methods: Prospective, non randomised study (01/03-06/08); nonunions of the diaphyseal and metaphyseal tibia (AO type 42/43); standardized treatment concept: diaphysis: reamed intramedullary nailing; dia-metaphyseal junction and pilon: LCP with a minimal invasive approach or an open approach plus bone grafting from the iliac crest; infected nonunions: external fixator. Analysis parameters: demographic data, fracture type (AO classification), primary surgery, healing process, time to union (radiographic), complications. Results: Forty-eight patients (39 m, 9 f; mean age 45,2 y) with 15 hypertrophic (primary surgery: 13x nail, 2x external fixator) and 33 atrophic nonunions of the tibia (primary surgery: 13x nail, 13x plate, 4x screws and 3x external fixator) were included in the study. Fifteen tibial nonunions had been primary treated in our department, 33 patients had been admitted from other hospitals. Seventy-three% of all nonunions were located at the distal third of the tibia (45% at the diaphyseal-metaphyseal junction, AO-classification type 42; 55% at the pilon, AO-classification type 43). Seventy-five% of the dia-metaphyseal fractures and 10% of the pilon fractures were primary treated with an intramedullary nail. The mean time between injury and nonunion-surgery was 10,3 (6-39) months. Follow up: 41/48 patients (85%) for an average time period of 22,2 months; union-rate: 37/41 (hypertrophic nonunions 11/13; atrophic nonunions 26/28: 2 re-nonunions each). Complications: 1 death by lung embolism, 1 re-nonunion (united after second surgery), 1 implant (plate) loosening with the need of reosteosynthesis, 2x varus malalignment, 1x valgus malalignment, 1x peroneal nerve lesion. Conclusion: Especially the distal third of the tibia still represents a high risk area for nonunions. Impaired perfusion, thin soft tissue coverage, as well as the rising number of nailing even of distal tibial fractures 1 are some of the causes. We think that the herein introduced treatment concept is effective to manage tibial nonunions. Thus, the union-rate in this study population was 90% 2,3 . An adequate primary osteosynthesis as well as the prevention of extensive soft tissue damage during surgery are mandatory to improve the outcome of tibial fractures. Besides, new therapy options as e.g. the application of growth factors and ultrasound have to be considered also for the treatment of tibial nonunions.",

Soft tissues are almost allways compromised. Bilateral plating carries the risk of soft tissue and bone infections. Due to loss of reduction, steps or gaps might remain in the joint surfaces. Aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcome of Schatzker 4, 5 and six type fractures treated with locked osteosynthesis plating. Material and Methods: Between January 2003 und January 2005 we treated 97 patients suffering from a tibial head fracture. In 26 cases osteosynthesis was performed with the use of an angular stable implant, this group forms the study population. Indication for locked screw plates were bicondylar fractures treated unilateral to avoid bilateral approach with double-plate osteosynthesis and tibial head fractures with a shaft involvement (Schatzker 6). Follow-up was performed after an average of 7.5 months after surgery. We treated 16 male and 10 female patients with an average of 52.5 years of age (17 to 73 years). There were no patients with open fractures or primary nerve injury included in this study. Operative treatment was performed after an average of 1.7 days after trauma. We used an angular stable plate fixator made from pure titanium (TiFix\u00d2, Litos, Hamburg/ Germany). The plate is consisting of the softer titanium Grade 1; the screws are made from harder titanium Grade 2.Results: There was one case of a postoperative peroneal nerve lesion with spontaneous regression after two weeks. No postoperative wound necrosis or infection occured. All patients showed bony consolidation after a mean of 8.4 weeks as judged by radiographs. Additional autologous bone transplantation was not necessary. We did not observe any secondary loss of reduction or loosening of the internal plate fixator when comparing direct postoperative radiographs to those at follow up. ROM of the knee did not show any restriction compared to the opposite side in 9 patients. 13 cases showed mild and 4 cases a remarkable restriction of ROM compared to the not injured side.Applying the Rasmussen score, 17 cases achieved a good and very good result. 6 patients had to be judged as moderate and 3 as poor Conclusion: Unilateral plate fixation for the treatment of bicondylar tibial head fractures seems to offer advantages in particular concerning infection rate and implant failure in the treatment of tibial head fractures. Results: The adjacent level Th-L fracture was found in 6.5% (3/46 patients) in kyphoplasty group and in 7% (2/27 patients) in vertebroplasty group. We did not found any serious complication but established postoperative BMD loss. We did not found any intradiscal cement leakage in cases with adjacent level fractures. Intraoperative correction of kyphosis was better achieved in kyphoplasty group; pain relief was similar in both groups.Conclusion: Natural process of further bone loss seems to be the most influent factor for future compression fractures in elderly patients. Trauma patients represent a challenge in terms of obtaining informed consent as they are often in significant pain and maybe under the influence of strong medication at the time of the consent process. We designed a prospective, randomised un-blinded control study to test the hypothesis that there would be no difference in the ability of trauma patients to recall details of the consent process whether the patients were given verbal compared with verbal and written information.Material and Methods: A consecutive cohort of trauma patients presenting to a major teaching hospital were recruited and randomised into two groups. Group A received structured verbal information only. Group B received structured verbal information and written information about the proposed procedure. All patients were interviewed within the first post operative week (mean 3.2 days) and scored on their ability to recall key facts given in the original consent interview. Results were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test.Results: 119 patients have been recruited. Information recall was significantly improved in the group receiving written information (mean questionnaire score 64% vs 41% for verbal information alone, p=0.0014). Patient satisfaction with the consent process was also significantly improved in the group receiving written and verbal information, with 97.9% of patients reporting they understood the risks of surgery when they signed the consent form, compared to 83.2% who received verbal information alone (p=0.01).Conclusion: Written information improves patient recall of the consent process. It is a simple, cost-effective intervention with high patient acceptability. Introduction: Survivorship of second hip fracture patients is worse than initial hip fracture patients. However, previous studies included in-hospital mortality. The actual survivorship of initial hip fracture patients with subsequent second hip or major long bone of extremity or vertebral body fracture by exclusion of in-hospital mortality patients have not been studied. We aim to compare the actual survival of initial hip fracture patients with and without second hip or subsequent major fracture. In addition, risk factors, mortality causes, and hazards ratio of each fracture groups were studied. Material and Methods: In 2000-2008, after exclusion of in-hospital mortality patients, 1038 initial hip fracture patients were reviewed and divided into four groups. Group I, II, III, and IV were initial hip fracture patients with second hip, subsequent major long bone of extremity, vertebral body fracture, and without any subsequent fractures, respectively. We set group I, II, and III as study groups comparing the data with group IV (control group). Age, gender, mobility-status, co-morbidity, causes of death, and survival years after hospitalization of last fracture treatment of each group were recorded. Actual survival rate and risk factors difference between initial hip fracture with and without subsequent fracture were analyzed by Chi-square test. Hazards ratio differences among the groups were analyzed by Cox regression models.Results: There were 34 (3.3%), 71 (6.8%), 160 (15.4%), and 773 (74.5%) subjects in group I, II, III, and IV respectively. At one-year and one-to-five year mortality of group I were 8.8% and 5.9%, group II were 5.6% and 1.4%, group III were 1.3% and 1.9%, and group IV were 4.7% and 1.4% respectively. Statistical analysis by using Chi square test of one-year mortality and one-to-five year mortality rate showed no significant difference among four groups (p > 0.05). But from Cox regression analysis, second hip fracture produced significant hazards ratio as 7.98 (p = 0.02).",

However, special care should be focused in patients with second hip fracture which produced significantly highest hazards ratio for mortality.reduction or redislocation after one week of treatment. Due to the lack of sufficient patient data a statistical analysis was not carried out. It was obvious that the dorsal dislocation after reduction was worse in the dorsiflexion group. There was no obvious difference in radial inclination or functional outcome between the two groups. Conclusion: Mainly the dorsal inclination was worse in the 20 degrees dorsiflexion group. A possible explanation for these results is the technique used when modeling the plaster cast. In our hands immobilization in dorsiflexion yielded poorer results then immobilization in a neutral position. Due to the poor results the study was terminated prematurely.",

The value for the treatment of adolescents is still discussed controversially in literature. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of the minimal-invasive treatment of traumatic patellar luxation in adolescents. , that was treated with acute angular shortening using a monolateral AO fixator followed by gradual correction using the Taylor Spatial Frame (TSF). The conversion in the TSF was achieved in exchanging only two half-pins. Results: The deformity was anatomically corrected without any soft tissue complications. The fixator was worn for 12 weeks under full weight bearing while the actual correction took only 14 days. We did not see any typical external fixator complications like pin trac infection. Conclusion: Acute angular shortening can lead to direct soft tissue closure without any additional plastic surgery. The accuracy the the fixator allows the gradual anatomical reduction of the fracture and simplifies the correction of the mostly multiplanar deformities. When the surgeon is familiar with the TSF even a primary treatment of such fractures could be recommended. The image control (plain x-rays, CT) revealed and definitively determined whether a two-part or three part triplane fracture in the distal tibial physis were present, the amount of the displacement, and the co-existed fracture of the fibula. The principal goal must be the anatomical reduction of the fracture initially closed and in failure",

Results: At a minimum of fourteen months of clinical follow -up all patients lacked complaints and had full range of motion in ankle.Conclusion: These injuries occur in the adolescent age group generally slightly younger than the child with a Tillaux fracture, needed good image control (CT) and must reduced anatomically and fixed. Disclosure: No significant relationships. It is necessary in 15-25% of patients. To provide dynamisation using conventional methods, it is necessary to perform one additional surgery. In this presentation it is shown one new method of selfdynamisation. Material and Methods: It is presented one new minimally invasive method for closed fracture reduction and one extramedullary selfdynamisable internal fixator. There is no contact between bone and internal fixator in fracture area. It has been widely investigated biomechanicaly. In clinical use it has been applied to 1,349 patients in treatment of femoral fractures. The age of patients was from 14 to 88 years. This internal fixator is applied by two small incisions. Reduction is achieved using standard traction table or using special reduction device. This reduction device provides possibility of reduction with minimal using of fluoroscopy or even, after more experience without using of any imaging technique as fluoroscopy, ultrasound or computer navigation. Results: Received clinical results are promising, as it has been shown early callus formation and radiological union within the 3-4 months. It has been allowed to patients early full weight bearing. During the treatment it has been confirmed working of self-dynamisation concept (in 24% of patients), which probably all together with 3D configuration resulted in unexpectedly quick fracture healing. Follow up was 20 months (6-61 The severity of injury was measured by the Injury Severity Score (ISS). The outcomes for categorical variables were tested using v 2 test and a significance level at P < 0.05 was maintained. Delayed complications were defined as any complication directly attributable to the splenic injury that occurred more than 48 hours after injury. The following data was retained: age, sex, mechanism of injury, ISS, number of ICU days, overall length of stay, number of blood units transfused, day of operation and discharge status. Results: Our study found 10,4% incidence of delayed complications after NOM. These complications include delayed hemorrhage (4 cases), splenic artery pseudoaneurysm (1) and splenic abscess (1 case). The need for operation due to ongoing bleeding was retained in following situations: more than 4 U of blood to maintain a Hb higher than 10 g/dL, systolic pressure to less than 90 mm Hg despite resuscitation and evidence of peritoneal signs. Of the 6 patients failing NOM, 67% failed between days 3 and 5 and 83% in the first week. In all cases a splenectomy is performed with no mortality rate.",

            "text": "Introduction: More and more hepatic injuries are treated non operatively if the hemodinamic's and lesion's stability is confirmed. The count and the scaling of lesions doesn't directly influence surgical indications. We report about 6 cases of blunt trauma with serious hepatic and renal lesions treated successfully with a non operative management Material and Methods: We treated 6 liver and renal injury associated in a period from 2007 to 2009. Patients were admitted to Tor Vergata -Roma and Hospital Universitario Cl\u00ednico San Carlos-Madrid. Data collected were: age, sex, comorbidities, sequence of events, type and number of associated lesions, management, morbidity and mortality. All liver and renal organ's injuries were evaluated by abdominal CT scan with contrast and classified according to CT-based scale Results: Middle age was 36 \u00b1 11 SD years. Patient were male in (66,6%) of cases. CT scale of liver lesion was 3\u00b0for 4 (66,6%) patient and 4\u00b0for two (33.3%) patients. Renal lesions were I\u00b0category in 5 cases (83,3%) and II\u00b0category in 1 patient. No ureteral or major vessels rupture were founded. All patients have been treated non operatively. A CT based follow up of lesions was planned (at admittance, after 48 hours, after a week and after a month). The mean length of hospitalization was 12 \u00b1 6 SD days. During hospitalization, patients were monitored by clinic and labs daily. All patients were dismissed in good conditions and are in in health on a 6 months follow up. At CT follow up, one patient presented an intra-hepatic biloma, that was successfully treated with CT-guided drainage Conclusion: This work support the hypothesis that the association of liver and renal lesions in a blunt abdominal trauma, doesn't necessarily influences indications for an explorative laparotomy. If an ureteral rupture is suspected, a more aggressive treatment is necessary, in order to prevent peritonitisIntroduction: The aim of this study is to analyze the most frequent mechanisms of injury, the evaluation in the emergency department and the period of increase of the blunt abdominal trauma incidence. Material and Methods: During the last 5 years (2005-2009) 147 patients were admitted to our department for blunt abdominal trauma.The most frequent mechanisms of injury were: traffic accidents (automobile crashes and motor vehicle collisions)110(74,8%) Work accidents 26(17,6%) 3. Others (fall from high altitude, beating) 11 (7,5%) We analyzed the most frequent injuries observed, the final treatment for these patients and the period of increase of blunt abdominal trauma.Results: The peak incidence occurs in persons aged 18-42 years. The male/female ratio was 7:3. The most frequent abdominal injuries regarded: Spleen 113(76,8%), liver 24(16,3%), large bowel 5 (3,4%), small bowel 3 (2%), pancreas2 (1,35%).134 patients underwent surgical treatment (91,15%). The incidence of missed injuries is quite low, one case with pancreatic injury and one with small bowel injury. During summer period a significant increase in blunt abdominal trauma incidence occurs because of the increase of population due to tourism. The initial physical examination, after appropriate primary survey and initial resuscitation with the help of diagnostic studies such as ultrasonography, abdominal CT scan, is essential for the final treatment for these patients, operative or not operative. Abdomino-throcal injuries were found in 23(17%) patients.Abdominal organ injuries were found in decreasing frequencies in small bowel(29%),liver (26%),large bowel (21%), spleen (18%), major vasculer, stomach and others. Thoracal injuries were found in lung and heart in 21 and 2 cases.One organ injury was found in 39(30%) patients,mostly small bowel,and these group had a good haemodynamic status.Thirty-two(25%) patients had two organ injuries which 6 of them associated with lung injury.Three,4 and < 4 organ injuries were found in 13, 2 and 3 patients. Haemodynamic unstability at presentation,and shock was found in five patients(1,2 and 3 organ injury in 2,1 and 2 cases). The overall mortality was found in 8(6%) patients.Mortality from gun injury was 50% from major vascular injury 2,lung,pancreas and large bowel 1,lung and large bowel one.Mortality from penetrating trauma was 40% from lung and multipl abdominal organ injury 1,heart 1,lung,spleen and stomach injury 1 and major vasculer injury from blunt trauma in one (10%) patient. Five patients who remain haemodynamically unstable after resuscitation died intraopreoperative period.These group was not received some resuscitation, and they referred to our hospital later than 8 hours of injury. Introduction: Retroperitoneal location of the pancreas makes the diagnostic of any traumatism to be difficult, especially when this is not suspected. We report on a case of blunt pancreatic trauma with 6 months delayed diagnosis, after injury due to maneuvers in a difficult birth. Material and Methods: We report on a case of a twenty-nine year-old female who consulted at the emergency department for constant right upper quadrant pain that didn't ease with any analgesic prescribed by the general practitioner. These symptoms started after a birth six months before and loss of 15 Kg of weight was associated. After reviewing the previous history of the patient, the birth had been difficult and forceps, suction pad and repeated abdominal pressure maneuvers were needed. Abdominal examination showed a painful non-pulsatile mass located at epigastrium and both right and left upper quadrants. Abdominal ultrasonography and enhanced CTscan were performed and demonstrated the presence of multicystic 15x14x11 cm mass located between the stomach, spleen and left kidney. The high density content seemed to be blood. The mass was pushing the stomach anteriorly and no communication between both of them was shown. The splenic vein was pushed superiorly and thinned and plenty collateral circulation was evidenced. The tail and the body of the pancreas were not identified in any of the studies. The first choice diagnosis was posttraumatic complicated (with bleeding) pancreatic pseudocyst. The patient underwent emergency operation and a big cystic pancreatic mass was encountered, with plenty of collateral circulation. Intraoperative biopsy confirmed that it was a pseudocyst and therefore, the majority of the cyst was removed and Roux-en-Y pancreatojejunostomy was performed. Cholecistectomy was also done. Introduction: Unnoticed traumatic injuries produce avoidable morbidity, mortality and a higher medical cost. We present a special case of the reconstruction of a catastrophic abdomen with several intestinal fistulae and giant abdominal wall defect. Material and Methods: We present the case of a 26 year old woman with blunt thoraco-abdominal trauma secondary to a road traffic accident. Several lower left rib fractures, a fast echo with free fluid without solid organ injury and fractures of L1 and L2 were seen in the initial assessment. On the third day surgery was required due to septic shock with diffuse peritonitis due to a jejunal laceration and section of the body-tail of the pancreas. Simple suture of the jejunal laceration, distal pancreatectomy, and abdominal packing without closure of the abdomen was performed. She developed several intestinal and colonic fistulae. Over 40 surgical procedures were performed on her and she was discharged 9 months later with night parenteral nutrition, a closed abdomen by secondary intention and intestinal fistulae. She was readmitted a year later for reconstruction. We performed monoblock resection of the abdominal wall and the fistulized loops, subtotal colectomy and bowel transit reconstruction with three enteroenteric and an ileosigmoid anastomosis, leaving 1,8 m of small bowel. Abdominal plastia with Permacol mesh was also performed. Results: Surgical time was of 420 minutes and oral tolerance was initiated on the 7th postoperative day. She was discharged on the 14th day postop. The only complication was a fever secondary to infection a central venous catheter on the 3rd day. ",
