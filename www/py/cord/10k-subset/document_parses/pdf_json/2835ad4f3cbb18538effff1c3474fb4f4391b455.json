We used a combined application of this method involving immune-specific signature analysis and HLA-associated peptidomics using samples from six patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in order to select immunogenic HLA epitopes for in vitro testing. Additionally, we applied high-throughput imaging at the single-cell level in order to confirm the immunoreactivity of the selected peptides. The results indicated that this method enabled identification of promising CTL peptides capable of inducing antitumor immunity. This platform combining high-resolution computational analysis, HLApeptidomics, and high-throughput immunogenicity testing allowed rapid and robust identification of highly immunogenic epitopes and represents a powerful technique for cancer-vaccine development.",

In particular, therapeutic cancer vaccines against tumor-related epitopes that directly stimulate T cells have been clinically effective and are currently available 2 . Cancer cells express several antigens, including self-antigens derived from tumor tissues, as well as mutation-derived antigens (i.e., neoantigens), that can be recognized as foreign antigens by the host immune system 3-5 . Recently, cancer vaccines targeting individual neoantigens have become an attractive form of cancer therapeutics by virtue of their ability to elicit a robust T cell immune response [6] [7] [8] . Three independent clinical studies demonstrated the efficacy of this approach in eliciting neoantigen-specific T cell responses in patients with late-stage melanoma 9-11 . Nevertheless, several challenges to personalized cancer treatment targeting distinct neoantigens remain as obstacles to wide clinical application of these vaccines. First, the prediction of highly immunogenic neoantigens is difficult. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technology and MHC-epitope databases allow the accurate prediction of neoantigens; however, existing tools are inadequate for accurate prediction of immunogenicity due to the multiple associated factors, such as proteasomal-processing ability, intracellular routing, specific binding to highly polymorphic HLA molecules, and peptide/MHC (p/MHC)-complex open Scientific RepoRtS | (2020) 10:5885 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62244-z www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ stability 6,12 . Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the predictive accuracy of MHC-binding affinity and selection of immunogenic neoantigens in order to improve currently available algorithms and bioinformatics tools 13 .",

Self-antigens derived from tumor-related proteins are grouped into three categories 17,18 : tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), tumor-specific antigens (TSAs), and cancer/testis antigens (CTAs). TAAs are typically overexpressed in tumor tissues relative to their levels in other tissues, whereas TSAs are exclusively expressed in cancer cells, and CTAs are expressed only in germline tissues and trophoblastic cells in addition to being expressed in cancer cells. Using genetic and immunological approaches, several self-antigens have been identified as adequate targets for cancer immunotherapy 16 ; however, vaccination against self-antigens can still potentially induce central-and peripheral-tolerance responses resulting in low therapeutic efficacy 5,19 or an autoimmune response against normal tissues 6 . Therefore, identification of appropriate self-antigens is important for successful cancer-vaccine immunotherapy.",

Among these strategies, peptides used in cancer vaccines are 20-30 amino acids, showing lower antigen complexity and low costs for manufacturing 21 . In particular, MHC class-\u0406-restricted peptides (i.e., CTL epitopes) recognized by CD8 + CTLs play a key role in attacking cancer cells by promoting the activation and proliferation of antigen-specific CTLs 22 . To develop effective CTL-associated peptide vaccines, many methods use bioinformatics algorithms and proteomics approaches to identify multiple HLA-class-bound peptides 23, 24 . Recently, proteomics approaches associated with mass spectrometry (MS) 25 and specifically LC-MS/MS, were used for HLA-peptidomic analysis to directly facilitate the discovery of numerous natural peptides in complex with specific HLA molecules expressed on cell surfaces 26, 27 . Additionally, recent advances in MS-based technologies led to the development of a robust approach to quantify the dynamics of epitope presentation 28, 29 . However, the high numbers of HLA-restricted peptides available cannot be comprehensively tested to facilitate effective vaccine development. Therefore, we established a rapid and robust screening system combining immune-signature investigation, HLA-peptidomic analysis, and high-throughput immunogenicity testing to evaluate antigen-specific CTL responses (Fig. 1) .",

Additionally, large amounts of TILs correlate with improved tumor survival 30 ; therefore, we preselected TIL-resident TNBC tissues for histologic analysis to identify potentially promising cancer epitopes ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. S1 ) and scored TIL density by measuring the proportion of the stromal area infiltrated by lymphocytes, as previously described 31 . To select highly immunogenic HLA epitopes, we analyzed the intratumoral heterogeneity of the TCR repertoires in TIL-resident cancers from six patients with TNBC (Fig. 2b,c) . The TCR repertoires comprise somatic recombination of the TCR\u03b1 and \u03b2 chains, allowing the specificity of each T cell clone to be determined by rearrangement of the V, D, and J segments of the TCR\u03b2 chain during generation of the highly variable complementary determining region 32, 33 . To evaluate TCR diversity of TILs, we assembled CDR3 sequences using the sequence reads of RNA-seq data. A unique CDR3 sequence of TCR\u03b1 and TCR\u03b2, respectively, was defined as a clone, and the number of clonotypes represents the number of unique clones per sample after normalization with the corresponding RNA-seq depth (Fig. 2b) . The T cell clonal fraction was defined as the frequency of the top 10% of TCR\u03b1 or TCR\u03b2 clones among total TCR clones (Fig. 2c) . The top 10 most abundant TCR\u03b1 and TCR\u03b2 sequences in each patient are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2 , and expression of the three HLA-class I genes (HLA-A/B/C) is shown in Fig. 2d . We found a linear positive correlation between the number of TCR\u03b2 clonotypes and the expression of MHC-class I genes according to Pearson's correlation coefficient (r = 0.68) (Fig. 2e) . tiL immunoprofiles and immune-specific signatures. Several recent studies demonstrated the strong relationship between significant overall survival (OS) and cancer patients harboring a high number of CD8 + T cells and a low number of FoxP3 + T cells 34 . In particular, the abundance of regulatory T (Treg) cells and macrophages correlated with worse outcomes, whereas the abundance of intratumoral CD8 + T cells and CD4 + T-helper (Th)1 cells correlated with better prognosis 35 . Additionally, immune-specific signatures in TILs are of potential clinical significance; therefore, we estimated the distribution of TIL types in each patient according to WTS data using CIBERSORT computational analysis 36 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S3 ). The relative proportion of each infiltrated immune cell was evaluated in each patient by quantifying immune composition from bulk-tissue gene-expression profiles, as enrichment of CD8/CD45RO and Th1 cells are considered positive prognostic factors 37 . The results indicated that CD8 + T cells were highly infiltrated in both patients TNBC#2 and TNBC#6, whereas a large proportion of Treg cells was observed in patients TNBC#5 and TNBC#6 (Fig. 3a-c) . Patient TNBC#6 displayed a highly enriched frequency of CD8 + T cells, as well as Treg cells, suggesting increased accumulation of TILs. Interestingly, we found a significantly increased proportion of CD8 + T cells relative to Treg cells in patient TNBC#2 as compared with that observed in other patients (Fig. 3d) , suggesting the emergence The relationship between the number of TCR\u03b2 clonotypes and the expression of MHC class I genes. Pearson's correlation was calculated between two groups. of promising tumor-associated antigens. On the other hand, we found elevated levels of immune-suppressive macrophages in patients TNBC#1, TNBC#3, and TNBC#5, which is predictive of a negative outcome (Fig. 3e ).",

After immunoprecipitation, high-resolution LC-MS/MS analysis identified and quantified the HLA peptide sequences with a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) (Supplementary Fig. S5) . Notably, the number of eluted peptides from each of the six patients were substantially different ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ), although >96% of the HLA peptides analyzed by LC-MS/ MS showed typical properties associated with epitope length. As expected, most of the peptides were nine amino acids long, with only a few having 13 to 15 amino acids, suggesting a high level of consistency ( Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. S6 ). Clustering of the 9-mer HLA peptides showed predominant enrichment of residues at peptide positions 2 and 9 and consistent with the anchor motifs required by the binding groove of each HLA molecule 27 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. S7 ). Additionally, we found high numbers of CD8 + T and CD4 + Th1 cells infiltrating into the tumor sites of patient TNBC#2 and relative to Treg cells, with patient TNBC#2 showing a 4-fold higher number of CD8 + T cells as compared with that in patient TNBC#1 and accompanied by the lowest expression of MHC class I genes, suggesting a higher accumulation of antigen-specific CTLs in patient TNBC#2 (Supplementary Figs. S3,S8). A total of 594 peptides were identified from the tissue of patient TNBC#2 along with elevated expression of HLA genes, whereas only five peptides were received from tissue from patient TNBC#1 and all showing the lowest expression of MHC class I genes ( Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. S8 ). Moreover, we observed a positive correlation between the number of eluted peptides relative to input lysate and the expression of MHC class I genes (Fig. 4c) .",

Numerous cancer-related genes overexpressed in cancer tissues contribute to cancer-specific or associated epitopes 38 , and HLA epitopes require proteasomal digestion and translocation into the ER to bind MHC class-\u0406 molecules 39 . It would be expected that the expression of genes encoding machinery responsible for antigen processing would be elevated under these circumstances. These results suggested that the eluted HLA peptides identified were naturally presented by HLA molecules. We further investigated the levels of the eluted peptides based on RNA-seq analysis of corresponding mRNA from the same sample (Fig. 4e ,f). Compared with normal breast tissues, 174 of 594 peptides corresponding to proteins from the same sample showed elevated abundances in cancer tissues accompanied by significant differences in mRNA expression (\u22652 log 2 fold change). Subsequent in silico prediction of the HLA-binding affinities to the 174 HLA peptides and calculation of their respective binding affinity to specific alleles (predicted IC 50 ) 40 yielded a list of the top 20 highest ranking peptides derived from patient TNBC#2 (Table 1) .",

To determine whether the experimentally identified peptides can functionally elicit an immune response, we evaluated cytokine production by the CD8 + T cells. Currently, intracellular cytokine staining (ICS)-based detection methods for monitoring ex vivo IFN\u03b3 response show low throughput relative to the number of candidate antigens being tested. Moreover, an individual antigen test requires large amounts of immune cells 41 . Therefore, we developed an efficient and comprehensive screening system to test CTL response based on a high-content, high-throughput imaging approach ( Supplementary Fig. S9 ). This fluorescence-imaging-based screening system allows the use of lower numbers of viable cells up-scaled performance 42, 43 . Development of a 384-well format capable of screening mixed populations of T cells for their response against large number of www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ peptides enables a cost-effective approach to phenotype analysis. Notably, cancer-associated antigens are highly attractive targets for determining their efficacy in triggering a T cell response; however, numerous clinical trials targeting TAAs for vaccine development have failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy due to immune self-tolerance. To identify highly immunogenic peptides incapable of eliciting self-tolerance, we tested the antigen-specific T cell response in PBMCs from a healthy donor. Monitoring ex vivo IFN\u03b3-producing PBMC reactivity using our fluorescence-labelled cell-based screening system ( Fig. 5a -c, Supplementary Figs. S10,S11) revealed significant IFN\u03b3 responses to two individual epitopes (eIF4A1-P and TCP1-P) in CD8 + T cells labelled with a FITC conjugated anti-human CD8 antibody (Fig. 5b) . Additionally, treatment with the HLA-A*11:01-specific epitopes allowed detection of APC-conjugated IFN\u03b3 released from CD8 + T cells (Fig. 5a,b) , with PMA and ionomycin co-treatment used to trigger T cell activation as a positive control. Similarly, PBMCs from two of the three healthy donors were reactive against same two epitopes (Fig. 5c) .",

There are currently no known therapeutic targets for TBNC patients due to the molecular heterogeneity of the disease 48 . Recent accumulation of massive and comprehensive bioinformatics data allowed identification of potential therapeutic targets associated with clinical survival 49 . Interestingly, a TNBC subtype characterized by high levels of immune genes involved in T cell function, immune response, and antigen processing, was found to be associated with favorable prognosis, suggesting a close correlation between immune-gene signatures and better clinical outcomes 50 . Therefore, it is possible that TILs controlling clinical cancer progression represent key factors for preselection of tumors prior to HLA-immunopeptidomics. In this study, TIL-resident tissues were pre-selected comprehensively to investigate a diversity of TCR repertoires and immune profile as predictors of clinical outcome. We then found a positive correlation between TCR diversity, reflecting clonal composition, and the expression of MHC-class \u0406 molecules, suggesting that active tumor-antigen presentation promotes the generation of antigen-specific TILs. Additionally, immune-specific signature analysis can discriminate specific immune-cell types in each patient and thus enhance the efficiency of selective HLA-peptidomic approaches. Notably, the expressional comparison of CD8 + T cells relative to immune-suppressive Treg cells is extremely crucial to select the high antigenicity of antigens reflecting the therapeutic efficacy. Thus, the extreme increase in the number of CD8 + T cells relative to that of Treg cells in patient TNBC#2 presented a major analytical reason for further in vitro T cell response testing. Furthermore, our results indicated a positive correlation between the number of peptides identified via HLA-peptidomics and the amount of HLA molecules expressed on the surface of cancer cells. It is also possible that the observed difference in the number of eluted peptides might have been influenced by HLA-expression levels resulting from active induction of antigen presentation on MHC molecules, which subsequently elicited a strong immune response. Thus, these findings suggested that several factors should be considered for successful HLA-peptidomic approaches influenced by TCR diversity and elevated expression of HLA genes. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Additionally, we showed that integrating HLA-peptidomics with imaging-based immunogenicity screening is applicable for the discovery of highly immunogenic CTL epitopes. Characterization of antigen-specific cellular immune response is essential to confirm vaccine-related effects specific to a cancer antigen. Currently, there are www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ only few assays (e.g., the enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay) capable of quantifying T cell responses 51, 52 , and the choice of which assay to use depends on the experimental scale, cost, equipment, reproducibility, and required detection sensitivity. A high-throughput imaging system provides an optimal platform for highly sensitive and quantitative analysis of individual T cells at the single-cell level. Moreover, ICS-based cytokine detection allows identification of specific cell subpopulations, even when using a small number of cells.",

The peptides were eluted with a linear gradient from 5% to 30% buffer B over 70 min and 30% to 70% buffer B over 5 min, followed by an organic wash and aqueous re-equilibration at a flow rate of 300 nL/min, with a total run time of 95 min. The high-performance liquid chromatography system was coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) operated in data-dependent acquisition mode. Full scans (m/z 300-1800) were acquired at a resolution of 60,000 using an automatic gain-control (AGC) target value of 1e6 and a maximum ion-injection time of 10 ms. Tandem mass spectra were generated for up to 5 precursors by collision-induced dissociation in the ion-trap using a normalized collision energy of 35%. The dynamic exclusion was set to 60 s, and fragment ions were detected at a normal scan mode using an AGC target value of 1e5 and a maximum ion-injection time of 500 ms. Source ionization parameters were as follows: spray voltage, 1.9 kV; and capillary temperature, 275 \u00b0C.",

T cell responses to treatment with individual peptides were monitored after 12 days of in vitro culture, as previously described 11 . Briefly, PBMCs were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with L-glutamine, non-essential amino acids, HEPES, \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, sodium pyruvate, penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 10% human AB serum (Gibco), with a total of 5 \u00d7 10 4 PBMCs used in each well. For antigen-specific T cell expansion, individual peptides (2 \u00b5g/mL) were incubated with PBMCs in the presence of interleukin (IL)-7 (20 ng/mL; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) for 3 days. Each peptide with >95% purity was synthesized by Synpeptide (Shanghai, China). For non-specific T cell expansion, T cells were stimulated using a T cell activation/expansion kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), and cells were cultured every 3 days by replacing the medium with fresh half-medium containing IL-7 (5 ng/mL) and IL-15 (5 ng/mL; Peprotech). On day 12, for ex vivo intracellular IFN\u03b3 detection, each peptide (10 \u00b5g/mL) or phytohemagglutinin (PMA) (50 ng/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) plus ionomycin (1 \u00b5g/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) for the positive control was administered in the presence of Brefeldin A (1:1000; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) for overnight incubation according to the ICS protocol. After intracellular fixation using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm fixation/permeabilization kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), cells were stained with antibodies against surface markers and IFN\u03b3 at 4 \u00b0C for either 1 h or overnight. For visualization of IFN\u03b3-producing T cells, a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-human CD8\u03b1 antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), an Alexa594-conjuated anti-human CD4 antibody (BioLegend), and an allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-human IFN\u03b3 antibody (BioLegend) were specifically labeled for CD8 + T, CD4 + T, and intracellular IFN\u03b3 capture, respectively.
