study was designed to investigate the effect of Hochu-ekki-to (TJ-41), a Japanese herbal medicine, on the development of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in mice. ALI was induced in female BALB/c mice by the intranasal administration of 0.1 mg/kg LPS. The mice were divided into a group receiving normal feed and another group receiving feed mixed with TJ-41 at a dose of 1 g/kg/day for 8 weeks before LPS challenge. In the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, the preadministration of TJ-41 caused significant reduction in the absolute number of total cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. The preadministration of TJ-41 significantly inhibited increases in the serum level of keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), which is a murine chemotaxin for neutrophils that corresponds to human interleukin-8, with respect to its concentration at 24 h after LPS challenge. Furthermore, the histopathologic findings indicated that alveolitis with leukocyte infiltration in the alveolar space was less severe in the TJ-41-treated mice than in the control mice.

An initiating event (e.g., sepsis, shock, trauma, multiple transfusions, pancreatitis) leads to the activation of an acute inflammatory response on a systemic level. One of the earliest manifestations is the activation of the pulmonary endothelium and macrophages (alveolar and interstitial), the upregulation of adhesion molecules, and the production of cytokines and chemokines that induce a massive sequestration of neutrophils within the pulmonary microvasculature. These cells transmigrate across the endothelium and epithelium into the alveolar space and then release a variety of cytotoxic and proinflammatory compounds, including proteolytic enzymes, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species, cationic proteins, lipid mediators, and additional inflammatory cytokines [6] . This phenomenon thereafter perpetuates a vicious cycle by recruiting additional inflammatory cells that in turn produce more cytotoxic mediators, ultimately leading to the occurrence of profound injury to the alveolocapillary membrane and respiratory failure. However, aside from the use of activated protein C in the subset of ALI/ARDS patients with sepsis [2] , specific therapies are lacking, and the cascade of events leading to ALI and ARDS, once initiated, is much less amenable to specific treatment modalities. Therefore, new preventive measures against ALI/ARDS are eagerly awaited.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 210, "end": 214, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1002, "end": 1005, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1366, "end": 1369, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The herbal medicine known in Japan as Hochuekki-to (TJ-41) is known elsewhere by its Chinese name, bu-zhong-yi-qi-tang. TJ-41 is composed of ten species of medicinal plants and is used for chronic diseases or weakness after illness. Recent studies have shown that TJ-41 has been widely used to treat patients with certain immune-related diseases. TJ-41 suppresses the development of collagen-induced arthritis, redistributes the population of lymphocytes in lymph nodes and blood, and inhibits interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) secretion in mice with collagen-induced arthritis [4] . The administration of TJ-41 decreased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) concentrations of IL-1a, IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) but not of TNFa or interferonc (IFNc), and it was found to increase the survival rate after influenza virus infection in mice [9] . Moreover, TJ-41 contains Glycyrrhizae radix, a flavonoid that has been shown to inhibit human neutrophil NADPH oxidase and impair neutrophil response [12, 14] . Wang et al. [15] reported that ROS produced by NADPH oxidase activation in neutrophils plays a major role in mediating sepsis-induced ALI, and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor attenuates sepsis-induced lung injury in guinea pigs.

[10, 11] demonstrated that the oral administration of Sho-saiko-to ameliorated lung injury induced by intranasal LPS instillation in BALB/ c mice, Ishizaki et al. [5] showed that Sho-saiko-to tended to induce acute pneumonitis by allergicimmunologic mechanisms in patients with chronic active hepatitis. Indeed, in some cases, Shosaiko-to leads to interstitial pneumonia, especially when used together with IFN, and some cases become serious. Therefore, we have tried to find other Japanese herbal medicines that have a protective effect on ALI/ARDS without such adverse effects. In this study we examined the preventive effects of Hochu-ekki-to on an LPSinduced ALI model. In BALF, the preadministration of TJ-41 caused a significant reduction in the total cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. The preadministration of TJ-41 significantly inhibited the increase in serum KC concentration at 24 h after LPS challenge. Furthermore, the histopathologic findings indicated that alveolitis was less severe in TJ-41-treated mice than in control mice. These findings suggest that the preadministration of TJ-41 could be expected to show an inhibitory effect on ALI/ARDS via the modulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Clinical and experimental studies have provided circumstantial evidence of the occurrence of neutrophil-mediated injury in ALI/ARDS. Histologic studies of human lung specimens obtained early in the course of the disorder show marked accumulation of neutrophils [16] . Neutrophils predominated in pulmonary edema fluid and BALF obtained from the affected patients, and many animal models of ALI are neutrophil-dependent [16] . In the acute phase of ALI/ARDS, neutrophils are shown to adhere to the injured capillary endothelium and then migrate through the interstitium into the air space, which is filled with protein-rich edema fluid. In the air space, alveolar macrophages secret cytokines, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 and TNFa, all of which act locally to stimulate chemotaxis and activate neutrophils [16] . As shown in Figure 3 , the serum levels of KC, which is a chemotaxin for neutrophils similar to human IL-8, in LPS-induced ALI mice receiving TJ-41 were significantly lower than those in control mice at 24 h after LPS challenge. These reductions may have contributed to the decreased neutrophil count in BALF of the LPS-induced ALI model treated with TJ-41 (Fig. 2B) .

We expect that TJ-41 suppresses ROS production in an LPS-induced ALI model. We measured the amount of LPO in the BALF and serum, which was an indicator of oxidative stress [3] . The results of this study, however, demonstrated that the serum and BALF levels of LPO did not decrease in TJ-41-treated mice. These findings suggest that TJ-41 might have only a slight effect on ROS production in the lungs of the LPS-induced ALI model.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 286, "end": 289, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In summary, the results of this study proved that the preadministration of TJ-41 reduced LPS-induced ALI in BALB/c mice. The ameliorating effects of neutrophil infiltration on the lung seemed to be due to reduced KC production by TJ-41. These findings suggest that the preadministration of TJ-41 may therefore modulate the process of ALI/ARDS via regulating proinflammatory cytokine production. However, the precise mechanism by which TJ-41 modulates proinflammatory cytokine production remains obscure. Further studies are required to elucidate this issue.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Regulation of myeloid
