Furthermore, from week 7 onwards, it was possible to identify which of the ICU admissions in the USISS mandatory dataset came from sentinel hospital trusts. This improved the ability to estimate the ratio of ICU admissions to hospitalisations at all levels of care. The results presented in the main manuscript focus on the analyses that were carried out in \"real time\" during the epidemic season and, in many cases, these new information sources have been used to generate alternative analyses investigating sensitivity to the initial assumptions. For example, all models had assumed initially that the proportion of people immune to infection was equal to or around 10%. The serological data subsequently suggested that the true proportion was somewhat higher at about 40%.
