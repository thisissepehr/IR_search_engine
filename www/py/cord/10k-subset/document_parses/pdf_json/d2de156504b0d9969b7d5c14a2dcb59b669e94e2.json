The dynamical behavior of the SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) model and the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered/removed) model, which are considered as the conventional way to describe the fundamental mechanism of diseases, have been widely studied on regular networks and complex networks [1\u221216] .",

In contrary to homogeneous networks, those networks with large fluctuations in degree distributions are called heterogeneous networks, such as scale-free networks [18] . Of course, the mechanism of the spreading of epidemics on different kind of networks are different, so the values of the thresholds for the outbreak of epidemics on them are also different. When epidemics spread on homogeneous networks, the results both for SIS and SIR models are that the transmission of an infectious agent can be characterized by the epidemic threshold \u03bb c . The disease will break out when the infection rate \u03bb > \u03bb c ; Otherwise, the contagion is self-limiting. However, when epidemics spread on heterogenous networks, the most striking result is that for SIS and SIR models the epidemic threshold \u03bb c is null if the size of a heterogenous network is sufficiently large [1\u22123] .",

Often, for real diseases, the infected individuals may experience several distinct stages [4] , e.g., individuals who are infected by HIV-AIDS may pass through several stages: Being highly infectious in the first few weeks after becoming infected, then having low infectivity for many years, and becoming gradually more infectious as their immune system break down, eventually, they progress to AIDS. Moreover, such staged progression models may be applied to situations where the behavior of infected individuals changes with time, and so does their infectivity. In view of all the above facts, an alternative staged progression model is introduced in this paper, and the epidemic spread for the staged progression model both on homogeneous and heterogenous networks is discussed.",

We also have analyzed infectivity as a nonlinear function of node degree, and compared this case to cases with constant or linear infectivity. Our results show that the absence of an epidemic threshold observed for SIS epidemics on scale-free networks also holds for staged epidemic models. Similarly, if one introduces a nonlinear (sub-linear) scaling of infectivity with connectivity, one observed a nonzero threshold. These results are consistent with, and extend, those that have been previously reported for simple disease models. However, our results are more widely applicable to realistic disease situations when the infection (or the hosts response to an infection) undergoes several distinct stages. This is applicable to common infections (colds and influenza viruses) in which the infected individuals will change their behavior over time, and immune deficiency disorders (such as HIV-AIDS) in which the level of infectivity changes with time. Our results also address the previous idealization of an infinite tail in the power law distribution and we find that it is only in the idealized case that one observes a zero threshold. All of these conclusions are verified by numerical simulations.",
