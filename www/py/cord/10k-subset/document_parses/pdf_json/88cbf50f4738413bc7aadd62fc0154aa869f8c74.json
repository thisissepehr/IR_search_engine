Most of the infection-related deaths can be avoided by treating maternal infections during pregnancy, ensuring a clean birth, care of the umbilical cord, and exclusive breastfeeding [42, 43] .

The promotion of early and exclusive breastfeeding, prevention, and treatment of hypothermia, including kangaroo mother care [43, 44] , and topical skin-cleansing with chlorhexidine may reduce morbidity and mortality secondary to infection [45, 46] .
