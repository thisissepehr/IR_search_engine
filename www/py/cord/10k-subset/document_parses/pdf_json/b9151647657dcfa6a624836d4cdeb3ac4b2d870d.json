This region enhanced GUS expression in leaves of transgenic tobacco plants when fused in either orientation to a minimal pea PetE promoter (\u2212176 to +4) and in roots when fused in either orientation upstream or downstream of a minimal cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (\u221290 to +5). The region was also able to enhance GUS expression in microtubers of transgenic potato plants when placed in either orientation upstream of a minimal class I patatin promoter (\u2212332 to +14). Dissection of P268 revealed that cis elements responsible for enhancing GUS expression from the minimal PetE promoter were distributed throughout P268. Multiple copies of a 31 bp A/T-rich sequence from within P268 and of a 26 bp random A/T sequence were able to enhance GUS expression from the minimal PetE promoter, indicating that A/T-rich sequences are able to act as quantitative, non-tissue-specific enhancer elements in higher plants.",

            "text": "The pea plastocyanin gene (PetE) is a single-copy nuclear gene encoding a 10 kDa copper protein which participates in photosynthetic electron transfer between cytochrome f and the primary donor P700 of photosystem I [32] . The PetE gene is expressed only in photosynthetic tissues and its expression is induced by light [7, 33, 36, 42, 47, 60] . The pea PetE promoter is one of the strongest photosynthesis gene promoters yet described, resulting in expression of the GUS reporter gene at levels 6-fold higher than a tobacco RbcS promoter and 10-fold higher than the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter in leaves of transgenic tobacco plants [47] . Promoter-deletion analysis in transgenic tobacco plants indicated that the high-level expression was due to the presence of a positive regulatory region from \u2212444 to \u2212177 upstream of the translation start site [47] . Deletion of this highly A/T-rich region (P268) resulted in markedly decreased expression in all chloroplast-containing tissues of the plants, indicating that the region \u2212176 to +4 (relative to the translation start) was able to direct tissuespecific expression [47] . Gel retardation and DNase I footprinting experiments have shown that high mobility group proteins, HMG-1 and HMG-I/Y, bind to numerous A/T-rich DNA tracts within P268 [47, 61] .",

            "text": "Many plant nuclear genes contain enhancer elements responsible for regulated gene expression located upstream of the transcription start sequences. Enhancer elements were first described from animal viruses [3, 41] and were able to stimulate gene ex-pression when placed in either orientation upstream or downstream of the gene. The enhancers were able to act over considerable distances in many different tissues due to the presence of multiple cis elements which acted combinatorially [22] . The best characterised plant enhancer is probably that of the CaMV 35S promoter which contains multiple cis elements that can function either independently or synergistically to activate expression in a developmentally regulated and tissue-specific manner [4] . Many plant genes have been shown to contain upstream sequences which are able to enhance expression when placed in either orientation upstream from a minimal promoter [14, 16, 17, 18, 53, 55, 57] . These enhancer sequences often direct tissue-specific and/or regulated expression, for example by light, growth regulators or drought, from multiple cis elements [19, 55, 56, 63] , although quantitative enhancement has been observed with some A/T-rich enhancer elements [12, 15, 49] . In general, plant enhancers direct much lower levels of expression when placed downstream, rather than upstream, of the gene [14, 29, 55] ; this may be an effect of the distance of the enhancer elements from the promoter.",

Promoter-deletion analysis of related patatin class I genes has indicated that tuber-specific and sucroseinducible expression is retained on deletion to about \u2212300 bp [25, 35] . Transgenic potato plants were obtained using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of leaf discs and microtubers were induced by incubation of transgenic stem segments on media supplemented with kinetin and ancymidol in the dark. Measurement of GUS activity in microtubers demonstrated the ability of P268 to enhance expression from the minimal patatin promoter to levels equal to the full-length patatin PS20 promoter. The transgenic microtubers containing P268 in the normal and reverse orientations showed a 4-fold increase in GUS activity compared to the minimal patatin promoter (Figure 3) . No GUS activity was detected in the leaves of any of the transgenic potato plants containing patatin promoter constructs. These results support and confirm the earlier conclusion that P268 behaves as a non-tissue-specific enhancer, able to activate homologous and heterologous promoters in different plants and tissues (leaves, roots and tubers) with the tissue specificity of expression determined by the minimal promoters [5, 25, 35, 47] .",

However, different A/T-rich sequences have been reported to show positive [12, 15, 27, 43, 49, 58, 64] or negative [13, 28] regulatory features. A/T-rich regions from a \u03b2-phaseolin gene promoter [12] , the soybean lbc 3 gene promoter [34] and a soybean heat-shock protein gene [13] have been shown to enhance expression from truncated heterologous promoters, and therefore appear to have similar properties to the pea PetE enhancer. It has previously been suggested that the \u03b2-phaseolin A/T-rich sequence might act as a general positive regulatory element enhancing the activity of a proximal region primarily responsible for tissue-specific expression [12] . Our results with the PetE A/T-rich region in transgenic tobacco and potato plants support the view that A/T-rich sequences act as general positive regulatory elements. Experimental evidence for A/T-rich sequences showing negative or neutral effects on gene expression has been gained only by deletion analysis [12, 28, 64] which may not Figure 5 .

Both HMG-1 and HMG-I/Y have been shown to bind to P268, although only HMG-I/Y appears to bind specifically to A/T sequences [48, 61] . Similar HMG protein binding has been observed with A/T-rich elements in several plant genes [44] , including the soybean lbc 3 gene [24] and a soybean heat-shock protein gene [15] . The rice HMG-I/Y protein binds to an A/Trich positive regulatory region in the oat phytochrome A3 gene promoter, implicating the HMG-I/Y protein in transcriptional regulation [43] . Studies on HMG protein binding to the A/T-rich region P31 in the PetE enhancer have shown that HMG-1 enhances HMG-I/Y binding, suggesting that an HMG-I/Y-DNA complex is likely to form in vivo ( C.I. Webster and J.C. Gray, unpublished results). Pea HMG-I/Y binds to sequences containing 5 bp or more A/T, whereas HMG-1 appears to recognise deformed or deformable DNA without any defined sequence specificity [61] . Highaffinity binding sites for HMG-I/Y proteins have been defined as two or more A/T-tracts of 5 or more A/T bp separated by 6-8 bp [37] . A strong positive correlation is observed between the GUS activity of leaf extracts and the number of high-affinity binding sites for HMG-I/Y proteins (as defined by Maher and Nathans Figure 7 .

This suggests a functional role for HMG-I/Y proteins in enhancing gene expression and indicates that multiple A/T-rich, high-affinity HMG-I/Y binding sites act additively rather than multiplicatively. The precise role of the HMG-I/Y proteins is not clear but HMG proteins have been described as 'architectural' proteins modelling the chromatin structure in the vicinity of genes [20] . HMG-I/Y has been shown to compete with histone H1 for binding to A/Trich sequences at scaffold-associated regions (SARs) of DNA in animal cells [65] . This is proposed to alter the local chromatin structure and influence expression from nearby promoters.",

We have recently shown that HMG-I/Y stimulates SAR binding to pea nuclear scaffold preparations and that P268 has weak scaffold-binding activity (L.A. Watson, D. Hatton, C.I. Webster and J.C. Gray, unpublished). Several SARs (or MARs, matrix-associated regions) have been characterised from plants [2, 10, 21, 51, 54, 59] and they all appear to be highly A/T-rich regions of DNA [11] . Some of these SARs have been shown to have the property of decreasing position-effect variation in transgenic plants presumably by insulating reporter genes from flanking chromatin structure [10, 40] . However other SARs have been shown to enhance the activity of adjacent reporter gene constructs [1, 51, 59] . This property of these SARs appears to be similar to the enhancer activity described for the positive regulatory region of the pea PetE gene. This may suggest that the pea PetE enhancer, and possibly other A/T-rich enhancer elements, acts by remodelling local chromatin structure from SARS, thus influencing expression from adjacent promoters.",
