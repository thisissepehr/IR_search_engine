relapse is the major cause of death after allogeneic HSCT. Material (or patients) and methods: To investigate if T-cell dysfunction is associated to post-transplant relapse, we longitudinally analyzed T-cell dynamics in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) of 26 AML pts receiving HSCT from HLA identical (HLAid, 14 pts) or HLA haploidentical (haplo, 12 pts) donors. Samples were analysed by multi-parametric flow cytometry to investigate the expression of inhibitory receptors (IRs) on CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets defined by CD45RA, CD62L and CD95 expression. The proportion of regulatory T cells (Tregs; CD4+/CD25+/FoxP3+) was also assessed. Results: BM and PB were collected 60 days after HSCT and at the time of relapse (median 219d; 14 pts) or, if complete remission (CR; 12 pts) was maintained, at 1 year. Samples from 8 healthy donors (HD) were used as controls. After transplant, both BM and PB T cells showed a preferential late differentiation profile (P o0.05) when compared to HD. BM and PB T cells from CR pts displayed a lower CD4/CD8 ratio compared to HD, at both time points (P o0.001). A higher proportion of BM Tregs was documented at relapse (P o0.01), independently from the donor source. We next investigated the expression of several IRs as T-cell exhaustion markers. After haplo-HSCT, PD-1, CTLA-4, 2B4 and Tim-3 were significantly upregulated in BM and PB T cells at all time-points, compared to HD and independently from the clinical outcome. Conversely, after HLAid-HSCT, at the late time-point, patients who relapsed, displayed a higher frequency of BM infiltrating T cells expressing PD-1, CTLA-4 and 2B4 than CR patients and HD (Po 0.05). We then investigated the profile of each T-cell subset in our cohorts of patients. In the BM of HD the expression of IRs was confined to effector memory and effectors. While a similar IR distribution was observed in CR pts, at relapse, PD-1, 2B4 and Tim-3 were also significantly upregulated in BM infiltrating central memory and memory stem T cells. Interestingly, at relapse, leukemias expressed PD-L1 (8/8 cases) and Galectin-9 (5/8). A linear regression analysis revealed a significant association between the levels of Tim-3 on BM CD8 cells and that of Galectin-9 on autologous AML blasts, suggesting a preferential role for this immunomodulatory axis in the transplantation context. Finally, results were also analyzed with the bh-SNE algorithm, an unbiased computational method that distributes single cells in bidimensional maps according to the fluorescence intensity. Based on phenotype similarities, the algorithm positioned HD samples separately from transplanted pts and HLAid separately from haplo-pts. 93 significant clusters were identified. Clusters associated with relapse after HLA-id (5) and after haplo (15) were composed of CD8 and CD4 T cells expressing preferentially multiple IRs, while CR-specific clusters were diminished in IR fluorescence. Conclusion: After HSCT, the molecular signature of exhausted CD8 cells in relapsing pts includes PD-1, CTLA-4, 2B4 and Tim-3. The expression of IRs on early differentiated central memory and memory stem T cells at relapse suggests a wide immunological dysfunction mediated by AML relapsing blasts.

To investigate the mechanisms imposing skin-specific regulation of Teff cell functions, we evaluated changes in the transcriptome and function of CD8+ T cell in the presence or absence of Langerhans cells (LC).

Results: Principal Component Analysis revealed that (1) transcriptomes of CD8+ Teff cells in peripheral tissues and lymphoid organs were very distinct, (2) these profiles diverged sharply between the different GVHD target organs, and (3) also segregated within individual sub-compartments of single organs.

Among 125 patients with available information on cytogenetics, 48 (38%) were Philadelphia positive. Immunophenotype was T-cell for 33% of patients. Median follow-up of was 16 months (range 1-67). Stem cell source was bone marrow (BM) for 91 (44%) patients, and peripheral blood (PB) for 117 (56%). Myeloablative conditioning (MAC) was used in 149 patients (72%) and reduced intensity regimen (RIC) in 59 patients (28%). GVHD prevention strategy was based on either post-transplant Cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) for 132 (52%) patients or in vivo T-cell depletion with ATG for 124 patients (48%). Cumulative incidence (CI) of neutrophil engraftment at 60 days was 93%. CI of acute GVHD grade II to IV was 31%, grade III-IV 11% and chronic GVHD 27%. The 2 years CI of non NRM was 26% for patients transplanted in CR1, 36% in CR41 and 35% in active disease (P = 0.27). Respective RI according to disease status was 26%, 32%, and 60%. Probability of OS at two years was 49% in CR1, 32% in CR41 and 11% in advanced disease (P o0.001), while LFS was 45%, 32% and 5%, respectively (P o0.001). The GRFS at two years was 39% in CR1, 22% in CR41 and 5% in advanced disease (P o0.001) . In a multivariate model restricted to patients in CR, factors associated with decreased NRM were: Pt-Cy vs ATG (HR = 0.47, 95%CI 0.25-0.90, P = 0.02) and Karnofsky performance status (KPS)490 (HR = 0.29, 95%CI 0.15-0.57, P = 0.0003).

There is increasing evidence, that loss of commensal microbes, in particular species of Clostridial Cluster XIVa, in the gut at the time of ASCT is associated with a higher risk of acute gastrointestinal Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) and poor outcome [1] . Material (or patients) and methods: Here we conducted a retrospective analysis of 626 patients undergoing ASCT at two centers (Regensburg/New York) regarding risk factors for additional early systemic antibiotic treatment and regarding the impact of timing of antibiotic treatment on the incidence of acute GvHD, transplant-related mortality (TRM) and intestinal microbiome composition. Results: In the first center (Regensburg, 380 patients) we identified in multivariate analysis early neutropenia (P o0.001) as major risk factor for early antibiotic treatment. Start of systemic antibiotic treatment prior to ASCT correlated with severe GvHD (grade II-IV, P = 0.03). Early systemic antibiosis was associated with higher TRM (34.1%, 58/170) compared to later administration of systemic antibiotics (19.7%, 35/178, P = 0.001) or no antibiosis at all (3.1%, 1/32, Po 0.001, Figure 1 ). Timing of antibiotic treatment was the dominant independent risk factor for TRM in multivariate analysis. The highest TRM (53%) was observed in patients receiving both prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotics active against commensal anaerobic bacteria (P = 0.03). Early antibiotic treatment was further associated with lower urinary 3-indoxylsulfate levels (Po0.001) and decreased abundance of members of Clostridial Cluster XIVa (P = 0.002) on and in the days following ASCT. The main results were validated in the second center (New York, 246 patients) using a different approach of antibiotic prophylaxis. Independently of antibiotic prophylaxis, early additional systemic antibiosis again was associated with higher TRM compared to later administration of systemic antibiotics (P = 0.002) or no antibiosis at all (P = 0.004). Regarding antimicrobial disruption clostridial abundance was higher in the late AB group than in the early AB group (P = 0.04). Conclusion: Our data suggest that at least early administration of systemic antibiotics with activity against commensal clostridial species have a negative impact on outcome and that antibiotic strategies should be reassessed to avoid major microbiota disruption prior to ASCT.

Through this approach, the recovery of innate immunity was fast, while reconstitution of \u03b1\u03b2 T cells in the first 2-3 months after transplantation was suboptimal (Airoldi et al Blood 2015) . In order to accelerate the recovery of adaptive immunity, we designed a phase I/II trial aimed at testing the safety and efficacy of post-transplant infusion of donor-derived T cells transduced with the new iC9 suicide gene (BPX-501 cells, Di Stasi et al.

Treatment was well tolerated and no infusion-related side effects were recorded. Two children experienced skin-only grade I acute GvHD, while no pt developed chronic GVHD. None of the 21 patients included in the analysis had secondary graft failure. Four pts with primary immunedeficiencies cleared life-threatening viral infections existing at time of starting the preparative regimen. All 21 pts are alive, after a median follow-up at time of writing of 6 months (range 1-13). All pts but 1 have full donor chimerism, the remaining child with SCD having 80% stable donor chimerism. The mean absolute number of BPX-501 cells and of CD3+cells at 30, 60, 90, 180 and 365 days after haplo-HSCT are shown in Figure 1 . In these 21 pts, the median time to reach 0.5x10 9 CD3+cells/L was 40 days shorter than in the hist. ctls. BPX-501 cells are still persisting after their infusion in all patients.

Despite its therapeutic relevance there is however no universally agreed definition of primary refractory AML (PREF AML). Nor has the role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) been defined in this clinical setting in a large patient cohort. To address these issues we examined long term outcomes in patients with refractory AML after IC, identified using three differing diagnostic criteria. Material (or patients) and methods: Response to IC was documented in 8907 newly diagnosed patients with AML treated on UK MRC and NCRN trials protocols from 1988-2012. Overall survival and predictors of outcome were studied in patients defined using the following three different possible criteria of resistance to induction chemotherapy: failure to achieve complete marrow remission (CR) after one cycle of IC (REF1A), less than a 50% reduction in blast numbers with 415% residual blasts after one cycle of IC (REF1B) and failure to achieve a CR after two courses of IC (REF2). CR was defined using conventional criteria of o5% myeloblasts 14 days following IC in a non-hypocellular bone marrow. 431 patients identified using the three criteria of refractoriness proceeded to an allogeneic SCT.

Nagler 3 1 H\u00f4pital Saint Antoine, Paris, France, 2 BMT Unit, Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano, Italy, 3 Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel Introduction: Disease free survival is the most common used endpoint for clinical research on allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The main pitfall of this endpoint is that it disregards event like severe graft versus host disease (GVHD), which is associated with morbidity and mortality for HSCT survivors affecting their quality of life (QoL). Therefore, a composite endpoint combining both disease-free survival and GVHD is needed. Holtan et al recently proposed to use GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) for HSCT outcomes (1) . However, chronic GVHD is a fluctuant event with time, and the start of IST may not be a good indicator of the impact of this disabling disease on long-term outcome and patients (pts) daily life. Furthermore, the major HSCT registries do not routinely collect information on start of IST. Material (or patients) and methods: Therefore, we conceived a 'refined' GRFS for registry-based studies. GRFS events were defined according to the original report by Holtan, as the first event among grade III-IV acute GVHD, severe chronic GVHD, relapse and death. Then, differently from the GRFS definition by Holtan, chronic GVHD requiring systemic treatment was replaced by the occurrence of severe chronic GVHD (refined [0007] GRFS).Adults transplanted for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first or second complete remission (CR1 or CR2), undergoing HSCT from a matched sibling donor (MSD) or matched unrelated donor (MUD) in EBMT centers from 2000 and 2014 were selected. Patients receiving myeloablative (MAC) or RIC regimen were included. Results: We analyzed 20937 pts with AML the median age at HSCT was 48 years (range 18-80), and the median year of HSCT 2009 HSCT (range 2000 HSCT -2014 . Seventy-nine percent of the pts underwent HSCT in CR1, and 21% in CR2. Donors were MSD in 55% and MUD in 45% of pts, respectively.

Conclusion: Our results indicate that the modified GRFS we termed refined GRFS is a useful endpoint to evaluate HSCT outcomes. For registry based studies, the use of severe chronic GVHD is a valuable indicator of organ impairment and quality of life. For these types of studies, it could replace the use of chronic GVHD requiring systemic therapy as event for defining the GRFS.

Commonly, second generation CARs employed in the current US clinical trials, incorporate one costimulatory domain, either CD28 or 4.1bb with the CD3-\u03b6 sequence in a lentiviral vector, for full activation of T cells. In our study, we evaluate the anti-leukemia effect of a second generation CAR. .\u03b6 retroviral vector in combination with the suicide gene inducible caspase 9 (iC9), as a safety switch for adverse events. Material (or patients) and methods: Single chain variable Fragment specific for CD19 was cloned in frame with CD8 transmembrane domain, 4.1bb costimulatory domain and CD3-\u03b6 sequence (CAR. .\u03b6 retroviral vector). Moreover, we add the CD34 as selectable marker and the new suicide gene iC9. Then, activated T cells were retrovirally transduced and analyzed by FACS, using an anti-CD34 antibody. Cr 51 assays and in vitro co-cultures were carried out to evaluate CAR-T cell anti-leukemia effect. iC9 activation was evaluated by AnnexinV/7AAD staining after exposure to AP1903, the dimerizing activating iC9. To assess the expansion, persistence, and antitumor effect of transgenic CAR. .\u03b6 T cells in vivo, we used a SCID mouse model engrafted with luciferase-positive CD19+ human leukemia cell lines. Results: Polyclonal T cells genetically modified by CAR. .\u03b6 show a cytokine-dependent expansion at the same level of control un-transduced T cells (NT). Flow-cytometric analysis of T cells stained with anti-CD34 identified from 62% to 91% CAR.CD19 transduced T cells (mean, 85%). Whereas NT cells were incapable of lysing CD19+ tumor targets (0% 45%), 49%, 58% and 68% of BV173, Raji and Daudi cells (all CD19+ LLA derived cell lines) were lysed during co-incubation with CAR.CD19-4.1bb.\u03b6 T cells at the E/T ratio of 20:1. No cytolytic activity of transduced cells against CD19-Karpas or K562 cell lines was seen. Moreover, co-culture experiments performed for a period of 7 to 15 days, show that CAR. .\u03b6 T cells were capable to significantly control overtime the growth of CD19+ targets, since only 0.1% and 3.2% of CD19+ Daudi and Raji cells, respectively, survive after incubation with CAR.CD19-4.1bb.\u03b6 T cells. Indeed, 85% and 82% of Daudi and Raji cells, were still present when incubated with NT cells. Addition of AP1903 eliminates CAR.CD19-4.1bb.\u03b6 T cell activity and induce apoptosis in 96% of the trasduced cells.

Conclusion: T cells redirected with a CAR that specifically targets the CD19 antigen, and incorporates 4.1bb costimulation demonstrated survival, expansion and anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo in the presence of CD19+ leukemia cells. Importantly, the incorporation of an inducible suicide gene and its pharmacologic activation efficiently eliminated these gene-modified T cells, this increasing the safety of the proposed approach. Introduction: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) with either matched related donors (MRD) or alternative donors is the most effective post-remission treatment (PRT) for prevention of relapse in poor risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1). We set out to compare outcome in patients with poor risk AML in CR1 receiving alloHSCT using either MRD, 10/10 or 9/10 matched unrelated donors (MUD), haplo-identical alloHSCT or umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) with either low or high ( r vs 4 3.0 x 10 7 /kg) total nuclear cell count (TNC) at infusion in order to establish the hierarchy of alternative donors.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O009"}, {"text": "Material (or patients) and methods: 3377 adult patients, transplanted between 2000 and 2013 and reported to the EBMT Acute Leukemia Working Party, with poor risk AML in CR1 receiving an alloHSCT using MRD (n = 2061) or alternative donors, including 10/10 (n = 827) or 9/10 MUDs (n = 248), UCBT with low TNC (n = 61) or high TNC (n = 89), or haplo (n = 69) were eligible for the analysis. Poor risk AML was defined as either white blood cell count 4100 x 10 9 /L at diagnosis, secondary AML, cytogenetic abnormalities associated with adverse risk, according to European LeukemiaNET classification or no CR after one cycle of induction chemotherapy. Results: Recipients of haplo alloHSCT and UCBT were younger than MRD alloHSCT recipients (median age, 45 and 44 versus 48 years, respectively, P = 0.002). Both reduced intensity conditioning and myeloablative conditioning (MAC) were applied, with a higher percentage of MAC in recipients of haplo (59%) and MRD (62%) alloHSCT versus patients receiving MUD alloHSCT (51%) or UCBT with low (52%) or high TNC (38%). 4 year OS following MRD alloHSCT was 53%, which did not differ from 10/10 MUD (52%) and haplo alloHSCT (55%). OS, however, was significantly lower for 9/10 MUD alloHSCT (45%) and UCBT with low (41%), and high TNC (42%), respectively (P = 0.010). 4 year RFS was 48%, 47% and 51% following MRD, 10/10 MUD, and haplo alloHSCT, respectively, which was significantly (P = 0.023) better than following UCBT with low (31%), and high TNC (37%), or 9/10 MUD alloHSCT (43%) . 4 year NRM depended on donor type and estimated 26%, 29% and 25% after haplo alloHSCT, UCBT with low and high TNC, respectively, versus 16% following MRD alloHSCT. Multivariable analysis confirmed the impact of donor type with OS following MRD, 10/10 MUD, and haplo alloHSCT being not statistically significantly different. Relapse did not significantly differ by donor type in multivariable analysis, while NRM was significantly higher for alternative donors as compared with MRD alloHSCT. Conclusion: Collectively, these results suggest that alloHSCT with MRDs and 10/10 MUDs may still be preferred in patients with poor risk AML in CR1. If an HLA matched related or unrelated donor is not available, then the repertoire of alternative donors includes 9/10 MUD, UCBT, and haploidentical donors. The latter type of donor is increasingly applied and now approximates results with matched donors. However, longer follow-up after haplo-identical donor transplantation may be needed to definitely establish its new place in the hierarchy of alternative donors.

Introduction: Current therapies for patients with r/r ALL who have had prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) have very poor outcomes. Blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) antibody construct, has shown antileukemia activity in r/r ALL. Here we characterize patients with r/r ALL and prior alloHSCT before blinatumomab treatment from a large phase 2 study. Material (or patients) and methods: Eligible adults had Philadelphia chromosome-negative r/r ALL and one of the following negative prognostic factors: primary refractory, relapsed o12 months after 1 st remission or alloHSCT, or \u2265 2 salvage. All patients stopped immunosuppressive graft-versushost disease (GvHD) therapy within 2 weeks of treatment start; those with active GvHD were excluded. 189 patients received blinatumomab by continuous IV infusion (4 weeks on/2 weeks off) for up to 5 cycles. Complete remission (CR) or CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) within the first 2 cycles was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS) and adverse events (AEs). Results: A total of 64 (34%) of 189 patients had received alloHSCT before enrollment; 10 had 2 prior alloHSCTs. Donor types primarily included 29 (45%) matched sibling and 31 (48%) unrelated; 59% received myeloablative conditioning regimens. Median age was 32 (range 19-74) years. At baseline, 23 (36%) patients had 1 prior relapse, 24 (38%) had 2 prior relapses, and 17 (27%) had \u2265 3 prior relapses; 28 (44%) patients had relapsed post-alloHSCT. Of 55 patients with previous salvage, 38 (69%) had received salvage therapy after last alloHSCT and before blinatumomab. Median time between the last alloHSCT or salvage to relapse was 6 (1-33) months. Median time from last prior alloHSCT to first dose of blinatumomab was 10 (3-40) months. 19 (30%) patients had a history of GvHD, and 42 (66%) had \u2265 50% bone marrow blasts (central laboratory).

Six patients reported GvHD (2 grade \u2265 3) during blinatumomab treatment (3 GvHD in skin) . Eight patients had fatal TEAEs (gastrointestinal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, 6 infection/ infestation); one (candida infection) was considered possibly related to treatment by the investigator. None of the fatal TEAEs occurred during remission. Conclusion: In this heavily pretreated patient group with r/r ALL and prior alloHSCT, single-agent blinatumomab induced a 45% CR/CRh rate, with an AE profile consistent with that previously reported. Introduction: AML patients failing to achieve complete remission (CR) or relapsing after intensive chemotherapy (CHEMO), have a dismal prognosis. In this setting, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a curative salvage therapy, but myeloablative conditioning (MAC) transplants are associated with high non-relapse mortality (NRM). For young patients, there is no evidence to prefer MAC HCT to a sequential (SEQ) HCT consisting of cytoreductive CHEMO, followed by reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and prophylactic transfusion of donor lymphocytes (DLI). The objective, analysing the data from SFGM-TC, was to compare the results of these 2 approaches in patients transplanted in AML not in CR. Material (or patients) and methods: [0] [1] [2] [3] . At transplant, 51.5% of patients were in induction failure and 48.5% in relapse. The median of bone marrow (BM) and circulating blast percentages were 20% (range 0-96) and 2% (range 0-93) respectively. S10 Transplant modalities: 58 patients received a SEQ approach (CHEMO with FLAMSA (N = 39) or with clofarabine (N = 19) + high-dose cytarabine, followed by RIC combining cyclophosphamide (CY) with 4 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) or with busulfan (BU)) while 41 patients received a MAC regimen (CY combined with 10-12 Gy TBI (N = 17) or with BU (N = 24)). Forty-one percent of patients were transplanted from a sibling and 59% from an unrelated donor.

They only differed from their circulating blasts at HCT (median 1%, range in MAC group vs 8%, range in SEQ group, P = 0.02). In univariate analysis, type of conditioning regimen (MAC vs SEQ) did not impact post-transplant outcomes: 2-y overall survival was 38.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 24-53.2%) in MAC patients vs 32.5% (95%CI: 20.9-44.6%) in SEQ patients (P = 0.39); 2-y cumulative incidence of relapse was 56.7% (95%CI: 41-72.4%) vs 50% (95%CI: 36.9-63.1%) respectively (P = 0.99) and 2-y non-relapse mortality was 14.8% (95%CI: 3.6-26%) vs 17.2% (95%CI: 7.3-27.1%) respectively (P = 0.44). Grade II-IV acute graft versus host disease (GvHD) occurred more frequently in patients who received MAC: 68% vs 36% in the SEQ group (P = 0.002), as did chronic-GvHD (44% vs 24%, P = 0.038). Multivariate analysis identified relapse status (hazard ratio (HR) 1.9, 95%CI 1. Introduction: Post-transplant relapse remains a challenge after RIC, particularly in AML patients with adverse prognosis factors. The so-called \"sequential\" transplant approach (e.g. FLAMSA regimen combining both intensive chemotherapy and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) HCT within the same procedure) initially developed in patients with refractory AML, could be a promising strategy to improve disease control and decrease the risk of relapse in high-risk AML patients in complete remission (CR) not eligible to standard myeloablative conditioning.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary of efficacy (N = 64)"}, {"text": "Material (or patients) and methods: In the current study we analyzed transplantation outcomes in a cohort of 265 adults patients transplanted between 2002 and 2014 for high-risk AML in CR (intermediate or high risk cytogenetic or secondary AML).

Median age was 43 years (range, 18 -76) and 59% were males. Disease status at allo-HSCT was CR1 in 48.9%, CR2 in 21.7%, CR3 in 6.2% and 23.2% of the patients had an active disease at time of transplant. Transplantation was performed from a HLA-matched sibling (49.8%) or a matched unrelated donor (51.2%). Sixty-five per cent of patients received a myeloablative and 35% a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen, respectively. Stem cell source was peripheral blood stem cells in 84% of the transplants, while 16% received bone marrow grafts. Incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) grade4II was 26.6%, while chronic GvHD occurred in 35.9% at one year (24.6% with extensive disease). With a median follow-up of 16.8 months, the non-relapse mortality (NRM) at one year was 25.3%.

We then performed a matched-pair analysis, comparing myeloablative thiotepa-based regimens with total body irradiation/cyclophosphamide (TBI/Cy) and could identify 226 patients in the thiotepa group, matched with 678 patients in the TBI/Cy group. Acute GvHD grade4II was observed in 11.2% in the thiotepa group versus 17.4% after TBI/Cy (P = 0.071).

SUPT1 cells had~12% survival and~46% Ann V-positivity in [Flu+Clo+Bu +Rom] whereas the individual drugs and other combinations showed less cytotoxicity. Combination indexes of 0.4 -0.5 at 50% drug effect were obtained for [Flu+Clo+Bu+Rom] in both PEER and SUPT1, suggesting strong synergism. Exposure of cells to the 4-drug combination resulted in a significant induction of histone modifications, activation of DNA-damage response (DDR), production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased glutathione (GSH) levels and mitochondrial membrane (MM) potential, and activation of apoptosis. A similar activation of DDR and apoptosis was observed in patient samples. In cell lines, the NF\u03baB, Raf-MEK-ERK, PI3K-AKT-mTOR, JAK-STAT, and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin prosurvival signaling pathways were inhibited. A novel finding that may also explain the observed synergism was the inhibition of expression of the drug transporter MRP1 by Flu and Rom. MRP1 is known to mediate the efflux of GSH-conjugated Bu. [Flu+Clo+Bu+Rom] dramatically decreased the level of MRP1 suggesting a possible increase in the intracellular concentration of free, unconjugated Bu. Conclusion: Based on above, we propose four mechanisms of synergism ( Figure) . These mechanisms converge to activation of caspases and apoptosis.

Introduction: Pentraxin3 (PTX3) is an essential component of the humoral arm of innate immunity, involved in controlling infections, modulating inflammation, and acting as a new prognostic and diagnostic biomarker in these conditions. PTX3 has been recently recognized as an extrinsic oncosuppressor in cancer; its role in hematological malignancies and allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT) is under investigation in both pediatric and adult settings. Material (or patients) and methods: From 2012 to 2014, we conducted a prospective observational study to address PTX3 role in 35 adult patients (pts) affected by newly diagnosed AML (n = 27) or ALL (8) , and in 73 adult pts who received allo-HSCT for acute leukemia. Donors were haploidentical (n = 45), sibling (n = 14), unrelated (n = 14). Serial peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) samples were collected. Time-points of sampling for leukemia pts included: diagnosis, relapse, any cycle of CT, evaluation of response (including BM), fever. Samples from allo-HSCT pts were collected as following: before HSCT, at HSCT (day 0), day +7, day +14, 1 month (including BM), 2 months (including BM), 3 months (including BM), 6 months (including BM), fever, acute GvHD requiring systemic therapy (at onset or before second line, day +7 of treatment, then weekly for 6 weeks). PTX3 level detection was performed with sandwich ELISA (detection limit 0.1 ng/ml). Results: Firstly we analyzed the group of leukemia pts. Although PTX3 levels on PB at diagnosis were not influenced by pts (age, sex) or disease characteristics (type of leukemia, BM and PB blasts), they correlated with WBC counts (P = 0,03). No statistical difference was found matching PTX3 at diagnosis with relapse or overall survival (OS). Then examining allo-HSCT pts, we observed an important difference in PTX3 levels on PB at day 0 among pts treated with treosulfan or busulfan-based conditioning (P = 0,027). We found a trend towards an increase of PTX3 for pts who developed a subsequent GvHD at day +7, and for pts who received ATG instead of PT-Cy at day +14 (P = 0,06 for both).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1279, "end": 1282, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O032"}, {"text": "Moreover, we evaluated 38 events of acute GvHD.

At day +7 from the start of therapy, PTX3 levels were correlated directly with steroidrefractory GvHD (P = 0,004) and reflare (P = 0,024), and inversely with GvHD resolution (P = 0,003). Concomitantly, the ROC analysis identified a threshold of 18 ng/ml as predictor for steroid-resistance (AUC 0,91; sens 75%, spec 85%) and GvHD resolution (AUC 0,848; sens 70%, spec 85%).

All patients were 10/10 (A/B/C/ DR/DP) HLA matched and received peripheral blood cell allografts. Acute GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus, micro-dose methotrexate and ATOR (40mg/day) from days -14 to +180. Graft manipulation and T cell depletion were not permitted. The study was powered to detect a 20% reduction in day 100 Gr 2-4 aGVHD relative to historical rates (35% to 15% in MRD and 55% to 35% in MUD). Results: Table 1 shows baseline pt characteristics. The only protocol related Gr 3 non-hematologic toxicity was ALT elevation in one MRD. All pts engrafted (median of 16 days for MRD and 15 days for MUD grafts). Median day 100 CD33+ cell chimerism in both cohorts was 100%. The cumulative incidence (CI) of Gr 2-4 and Gr 3-4 aGVHD at day100 in the MRD cohort was 9.9% (95%CI: Introduction: Acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) is a potentially fatal complication of SCT that occurs in 30% to 80% of patients. High-dose corticosteroids are first-line treatment for aGvHD; however, up to 50% of patients fail to obtain a satisfactory response with steroid treatment alone. Treatment of steroid-refractory aGvHD remains an unmet clinical need. Although numerous phase II clinical trials have been reported, to date only 1 randomized trial has been published in this setting*. Inolimomab, a monoclonal antibody to CD25 of the interleukin-2 receptor, has shown encouraging results in a phase II trial (INO-0102) as salvage therapy for patients with steroid-refractory aGvHD. The goal of this study was to compare inolimomab treatment to usual care in patients presenting with steroid-refractory aGvHD. Material (or patients) and methods: This phase III, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial aimed to compare inolimomab vs. usual care in adult patients (\u226518 years) with steroid-refractory aGVHD. The study was conducted at 11 centers in France and Belgium. Patients were randomized to treatment with inolimomab or usual care. Inolimomab-treated patients received 0.3 mg/kg/day during induction and 0.4 mg/ kg 3 times per week during maintenance. The total treatment duration was 28 \u00b1 2 days and patients were followed for up to 12 months. Patients in the control group were all treated according to the usual care (including high dose of steroids, Anti Thymocyte Globulin [ATG], TNF\u03b1 blockers, and other chemotherapy). The primary objective of this study was to evaluate overall survival (OS) at 1 year without replacement of baseline allocated therapy. Results: A total of 100 patients were randomized; 49 patients in the inolimomab arm and 51 patients in the usual care arm (all treated with ATG). The arms were well balanced with regard to gender, age, conditioning regimen, and aGvHD status. The primary criteria (1-year survival without replacement of baseline allocated therapy) was reached by 14 patients (28,5%) in inolimomab and 11 patients (21,5%) in the usual care (ATG) arm, with a hazard ratio of 0,874 (P = 0,2804). Figure: Time from randomization to treatment failure (defined as death or change of baseline treatment regimen). With a minimum follow-up of 1 year, 26 (53%) and 31 (60%) patients died in the Inolimomab and the usual care (ATG) arms, respectively. The number of adverse events were similar in the two arms (96% vs 90 % with at least one SAE), with fewer viral infections in the inolimomab arm (38;78%) compared to the usual care (ATG) arm (47;92%). Conclusion: Although the primary endpoint of this randomized phase III trial was not achieved, these results showed a trend towards improved 1-year OS with inolimomab compared to usual care (ATG). The lack of a statistically significant effect confirms the need for development of more effective treatments for aGvHD.

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (refrGVHD) are lethal complications after allogeneic SCT (alloSCT). Both conditions seem to be associated with endothelial damage and in our cohort overlap in about 50% of cases. Based on the fact that renal TMA is defined by high creatinine, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and low thrombocyte counts, with schistocytes and loss of haptoglobin as additional markers, we hypothesized that the simplified formula 'creatinine times LDH divided by thrombocyte counts' (endothelial activation and stress index, EASIX) might be valuable for predicting TMA and the related complication refractory GVHD. Material (or patients) and methods: The capacity of EASIX raised on day 0 of alloSCT to predict TMA was tested retrospectively in 771 consecutive adult patients undergoing alloSCT in Heidelberg between 2001 and 2013 using causespecific Cox regression. Moreover, EASIX was tested as predictor of acute GVHD outcome when measured at GVHD onset in a subset of 273 Heidelberg patients experiencing this complication. The prognostic capacity of the EASIX model for GVHD mortality was validated in two independent cohorts (n = 86 children, Cincinnati; n = 220 adults, Berlin) by calculating the prediction error (integrated Brier score), concordance index, and calibration index. Results: EASIX significantly predicted TMA when measured on day 0 of alloSCT (HR = 1.20 (increase by log2 steps) P = 0.03), and even if the marker was assessed prior to conditioning (HR = 1.24, P = 0.03). EASIX was also a significant prognostic factor for TMA in multivariable models including age, disease score, ATG, donor sex, recipient sex, graft source, diagnosis and statin intake as covariates (d0, HR 1.41, Po0.001; preconditioning, HR 1.28, P = 0.02).

In order to visualize the clinical value of assessing EASIX at acute GVHD, optimal cut-offs were calculated using maximally selected logrank statistics for data of the Heidelberg cohort.

Introduction: The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single agent dexamethasone (DEX) or tacrolimus (TAC) topical solution for the management of new onset symptomatic oral chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), and to determine if one therapy is superior. Material (or patients) and methods: This was a prospective single-center open label randomized phase II trial of patients with new onset oral cGVHD without prior topical, and with stable systemic immunomodulatory therapy. Subjects were randomly assigned 1:1 to either topical DEX (0.5 mg/mL) or TAC (0.5 mg/mL) solution and instructed to rinse with 5 mL for five minutes, four times a day, for four weeks. Oral cGVHD assessments (NIH criteria) were completed at baseline and end of treatment (NIH criteria, global response, and tolerability). The primary endpoint was the response rate defined as \u2265 3 point reduction from pre to post treatment with respect to sensitivity score (0-10). Subjects who received new immunomodulatory medications, dose adjustments, or initiated ECP during the treatment period were not evaluable for response. Since DEX was not systematically evaluated in a randomized setting, a parallel two-stage design was employed instead of a direct comparison in efficacy, so that an arm could be terminated early in the event of inefficacy. The accrual goal was 60 evaluable patients; 30 in each arm), accruing 14 in the first stage and 16 in the second stage. In the first stage, if 7 or fewer patients achieved a response, accrual to the arm would be stopped, otherwise accrual would continue for an additional 16 patients. If 11 or more responses were observed among the 30 total evaluable patients in each arm, then the treatment would be considered efficacious. If both arms were regarded as efficacious, a 'pick-the-winner' method would be employed to choose a better treatment for future investigation. Results: Forty six subjects were randomized to receive either DEX (n = 28) or TAC (n = 18). Six subjects were excluded from the analysis due to changes in systemic immunosuppression (DEX = 1, TAC = 3), or lack of second follow-up (1 per arm). After the first stage evaluation, the TAC arm was terminated due to lack of activity (3/14 responses, response rate 21%). Twenty six subjects in the DEX arm completed both study visits and were included in the response analysis, with 58% (15/26) experiencing response. With respect to how their mouths overall felt since beginning treatment, 31% vs. 21% patients reported \"much better\", and 38% vs. 36% reported \"slightly better\", giving an overall global response rate (\"much better\" or \"slightly better\") of 81% (21/26) vs. 71% (10/14), in the DEX and TAC arms, respectively. DEX rinses were well tolerated and taste was reported as \"very pleasant\" or \"tolerable\" in most subjects (96%). Conclusion: Intensive topical therapy with DEX solution is effective for managing patients with new onset symptomatic oral cGVHD and should be considered for first-line therapy. Topical TAC solution is ineffective and is not indicated for firstline therapy. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Current graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylactic regimens based solely on T cell suppression remain unsatisfactory. Besides selectively depleting alloreactive T cells and promoting the emergence of suppresser T cells, bortezomib (Bor) inhibits dendritic cell maturation and function. Material (or patients) and methods: In a phase I-II study, we sought to explore the feasibility and efficacy of adding of Bor to a platform of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (Cy) in patients undergoing allogeneic peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from 8 out 8 allele-matched siblings or volunteer donors. To date, 25 patients have been enrolled. The conditioning regimen was based on fludarabine (total 180 mg/m 2 ) and busulfan (total 6.4 mg/kg). Patients receiving grafts from unrelated donors (n = 15) also received rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin \u00ae ) 8 mg/kg in the first 4 patients and 5 mg/kg thereafter. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of Cy 50 mg/kg given on days +3 and +4 and Bor. Bor was given 6 hours after graft infusion and 72 hours thereafter. The dose was escalated as follows: 0.7, 1, and 1.3 mg/m 2 in 3 cohorts (n = 3, 3, and 19). Results: Median age was 57 years (37-70). Ten patients had AML, 6 MDS, 4 CLL, 2 DLBCL, 1 ALL, 1 follicular NHL, and 1 MM. Three patients had decreased creatinine clearance (50-60 mL. min/1.73m 2 ) at enrollment. One patient is not yet evaluable for engraftment. In the remaining patients, median time to neutrophil engraftment was 16 days (13-23). Two patients died before meeting criteria for platelet engraftment. In the remaining 22 patients, median time to platelet engraftment was 27 days (15-38). With the exception of 1 patient, all evaluable patients achieved full chimerism by day +24. The remaining patient had residual CLL and reached full chimerism by day +118. There was no secondary graft failure. No other than hematologic grade\u22653 toxicity was encountered. Treatment-related mortality was 12.5%. Two patients developed extensive HSV genito-rectal ulcers. No other cases were encountered when institutional practice changed to start acyclovir on the first day of conditioning instead of day +5. CMV and EBV reactivation occurred in 13 & 5 patients with one patient developing post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. Three patients developed BK virus-associated hematuria and 1 CNS toxoplasmosis. Immune reconstitution data was available on 16 patients (Figure 1 ). With a median follow up of 17.6 m (0.7-30), 9 patients (37.5%) relapsed: 2 DLBCL, 4 AML, 1 ALL, 1 MDS, and 1 MM. Out of 23 patients evaluable for acute GVHD, 7 patients developed grade II-IV (30.4%) and 3 (13%) grade III-IV. Three out of 19 patients with 4 6 months followup (15.8%) developed chronic GVHD. The predicted 2-year DFS and OS were 53.1% and 56.9% (Figure 2 A) while the predicted GVHD and relapse-free survival (GRFS) was 37.1%. The predicted 2-year OS for patients with Pre-Assessment Mortality (PAM) scores o19 (n = 11) and 419 (n = 13) was 81.8% and 25.5% (P value 0.024) (Figure 2 B) . Conclusion: Despite the small size, our study suggests that post-transplant CyBor is safe and practical to use even in patients with mild to moderate renal failure. It also allows prompt immune reconstitution and yields favorable outcomes. CyBor merits further investigation in a larger multiinstitutional trial. h\u00f4pital Claude Huriez, CHRU Lille, Lille, 2 h\u00f4pital Charles Nicolle, CHU Rouen, rouen, 3 hopital Saint Louis, assistance publique hopitaux de Paris, 4 la piti\u00e9 salp\u00e9tri\u00e8re, assistance publique h\u00f4pitaux de Paris, Paris, 5 IUCT-ONCOPOLE, INSTITUT CLAUDIUS REGAUD, toulouse, 6 hopital saint Antoine, assistance publique hopitaux de Paris, paris, 7 Universit\u00e9 Lille2, INSERM LIRIC U995, CHU Lille, Lille, France Introduction: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca syndrome (KCS) due to chronic GvHD (cGvHD) is responsible for major alteration in quality of life of patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-CST). The conjunctival fibrosis secondary to inflammation is often slow and subtle and is responsible for impaired corneal and conjunctival epithelial surfaces potentiated by tear quantitative and qualitative deficiency. Treatment of KCS remains disappointing; variable success in the correction of the conjunctival dryness has been obtained with variety of topical treatments with or without systemic immunosuppressive agents. These treatments, though, do not seem to have any effect on sicca symptoms and patients' quality of life. Sclero-corneal lenses bring a valid therapeutic option by creating a pre-corneal reservoir of tears allowing permanent lubrication of the epithelium, the protection of the corneal surface against the eyelid and ciliary mechanical friction and against environmental stresses and the creation of a uniform refractive surface to be taken into optimum optical load and stable visual acuity.

The 62 patients were equipped with sclero-corneal lenses. With a median follow-up of 22 months (IQR 8-43) from the treatment with lenses, all patients have experienced an improvement in their quality of life with a clear improvement of dry-eye symptoms. This quality of life is also improved by decreasing the frequency of eye-drop instillation and the attenuation of the discomfort and post-instillation visual fluctuation. At two months, all patients but one experienced improvement in OSDI score with a median of 92 points (range, 40-100) before lenses to a median of 25 points (range, . We also observed improvement or stability of visual acuity with median gain of -0.2 (range, -1 to +0.1) LOG MAR acuity and improvement or stability of the Oxford score with a median of 3 points (range, 0-5) before lenses to a median of 1 points (range, 0-4) after lenses. with a median gain of 2 points in almost all patients. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the largest cohort of patients with KCS having sclero-corneal lenses. Treatment of KCS with sclero-corneal lenses is promising. Whenever possible, this approach should be considered in patients experiencing KCS due to cGVHD. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Dual-SCT with T-cell depleted haplo-identical graft and cord blood (CB) has developed in recent years, which revealed a promising outcome. In China, graft manipulation is seldom performed, so we proposed an alternative dual-SCT strategy with unmanipulated haplo-identical graft co-infusing with unrelated CB unit, and published an encouraging outcome based on preliminary results [1] . Here we reported the recent updates of this prospective study. Material (or patients) and methods: This is an on-going prospective study approved by local Ethics Committee. The main inclusion and exclusion criteria are: (1) definitely diagnosed as hematological disorders; (2) with an indication of allo-SCT; (3) without an available matched related or unrelated donor. Myeloablative conditioning of either modified Bu/Cy regimen or modified TBI/Cy regimen was applied. Selection of donor, conditioning, GVHD prophylaxis and supporting care follows the principles described previously [1] . In order to identify the superiority of dual-SCT, data of patients receiving haplo-identical donor transplantation in the same time frame were analyzed as parallel control in this report. Results: From January 2011 through December 2014, 219 patients were recruited in this study including patients with AML (29%), ALL (38%), MDS (10%), SAA (10%) and other diseases. The median age was 26 (15-60) years old. The median counts of MNC was 10.5 \u00d7 10 8 /Kg in haplo-identical graft and 1.83 \u00d7 10 7 /Kg in cord blood unit, respectively. Only 4 patients achieved stable engraftment of CB unit. Univariate analysis in the study cohort suggested that lower MNC count (less than 12 \u00d7 10 8 /Kg) in haplo-identical graft was related to a significantly lower Grade II-IV aGVHD incidence (P = 0.041), lower TRM (P = 0.008) and better survival (P = 0.007). Comparing with 5/6 or 6/6 matched CB unit, 4/6 matched CB unit resulted in higher TRM with a statistical significance (P = 0.023), and lower OS with marginal significance (P = 0.071). Parallel control group contains 176 patients with roughly comparable baseline characteristics. In the comparison analysis, 2-year TRM was 14.9 \u00b1 3.0% versus 29.4 \u00b1 5.4% for dual-SCT and haplo-SCT (P = 0.003), and 2-year relapse incidence was 14.8 \u00b1 3.5% versus 23.3% \u00b1 4.4% (P = 0.011), respectively. Finally, better 2-year OS (81.5 \u00b1 3.1% versus 64.4 \u00b1 4.2%, P o0.001) and PFS (79.1 \u00b1 3.0% versus 58.9 \u00b1 4.1%, Po0.001) were observed in dual-SCT group compared to haplo-SCT (Fig 1) . No difference of GVHD incidence was identified between two groups. Conclusion: Our report showed promising outcomes of dual-SCT with unmanipulated haplo-identical graft and unrelated CB unit. Lower MNC count in haplo-identical graft and 5-6/6 matched CB unit were related to a better prognosis after dual-SCT. Efficacy of this approach merits further confirmation by longer follow-up, and moreover, by well designed randomized clinical trials. Besides, probable mechanisms and interactions between stem cells needs to be explored. Introduction: Unmanipulated haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) has been used more frequently in recent years. Severe graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a major barrier of non T-cell depleted haplo-SCT. There is no consensus on the GVHD prophylaxis. The current study aimed to compare the two most common used GVHD prophylaxis regimens (post-transplant cyclofosfamide (PT-CY) versus the anti-thymocyte globuline based in adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first or second complete remission (CR1 or CR2), reported to the EBMT registry from 2007 to 2014. Material (or patients) and methods: Primary end point was leukemia free survival (LFS). Secondary end points were refined GVHD-free relapse-free survival (GRFS), grade II-IV aGVHD and chronic GVHD, relapse incidence (RI), non-relapse mortality (NRM), and overall survival (OS). Median follow up was 22 months. Results: A total of 308 patients (pts) were reported from 78 EBMT transplant centers. GVHD prophylaxis was PTCY based in 193 pts and ATG based in 115 pts. Of the 308 patients, 61% in the PTCY and 63% in the ATG group, were transplanted in CR1 (P = 0.71). There was no difference in the conditioning regimen, being 50% MAC in both groups (P = 0.59). Pts in the two groups were comparable except that pts in PTCY group were more likely to receive bone marrow (BM) as graft source (60.1% vs 39.9%, P = 0.016) and had shorter follow-up (18 months vs 36 months, P o0.001). GRFS, LFS and OS were 50.9% vs 38.9% (P = 0.07), 56% vs 47.2% (P = 0.26) and 58% vs 54.2% (P = 0.37), for patients receiving PTCY or ATG, respectively. According to disease status at Haplo-SCT, the 2-year LFS was 54.6% for pts in CR1 and 47.8% in CR2, P = 0.93. Grade 3-4 aGVHD, cGVHD, CI of relapse at 2-years and NRM in pts receiving PTCY or ATG were 4.7% vs 12.5% (P = 0.01), 33.7% vs 28.3% (P = 0.33), 21.6% vs 22.3% (P = 0.97) and 22.4% vs 30.5% (P = 0.19), respectively. Adjusted multivariate analysis showed that pts receiving ATG had a significantly lower GRFS (HR 1.45; 95% CI 1.04-2.02, P = 0.030), lower LFS (HR 1.48; 95% CI 1.03-2.12, P = 0.034), and a higher NRM (HR 1.77; 95%CI 1.09-2.86, P = 0.02) in comparison to pts receiving PTCy . ATG based prophylaxis was associated with higher grade 3-4 aGVHD (HR 2.42; 95% CI 1.20-5.75, P = 0.04) while no association with relapse, OS and cGVHD. In addition, the number of Haplo-SCT performed per transplant center, was additional independent factor associated with GRFS (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.97-1.00, P o0.04), LFS (HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.96-0.99, P o0.001), NRM (HR 0.96; 95%CI 0.94-0.98, P o0.001) and cGVHD (HR 1.06; 95% CI 1.04-1.07, P = o0.001). One hundred twenty two pts died, 62% of transplant related causes and 38% due to disease recurrence. The causes of death were not different according to the type of GVHD prophylaxis. Conclusion: In conclusion, for pts with AML in CR, unmanipulated Haplo-SCT using PTCY with no ATG as GVHD prophylaxis allowed better LFS and GRFS, lower GVHD and lower NRM in comparison to ATG-based prophylaxis. This significant difference was observed for both BM and PBSC grafts as well as in the RIC and MAC setting. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Haploidentical donors may resolve shortage of available HLA-matched donors for treatment of blood cancer with a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), haploidentical HSCT requires alloreactive T-cell depletion. We developed a strategy that allows additional donor lymphocytes to be infused post-HSCT without risk of inducing severe GVHD and maintaining reactivity against viruses and leukemic cells. Material (or patients) and methods: In this open-label, multicenter phase 2 study (CR-AIR-007; NCT01794299), 23 patients with median age of 41 years (range 21-64) were treated with ATIR101. Sixteen patients had AML (70%), 11 in CR1 and 5 in CR2, and seven patients had ALL (30%), 4 in CR1 and 3 in CR2/3 at time of HSCT. Patients underwent myeloablative conditioning, consisting of a] TBI (1200 cGy; n = 11) or b] melphalan (120mg/m2; n = 12), along with thiotepa (10 mg/kg), fludarabine (30 mg/m 2 x 5d) and ATG (2.5mg/kg x 4d). A CD34+ selected stem cell graft from a haploidentical donor was given, containing 11x10 6 CD34+ cells/kg (range;4.7-24.4) and 0.29 x10 4 CD3+ cells/kg (range; 0-1.8) . In addition, donor lymphocytes from the same donor were processed using a selective photodepletion technology, creating a donor lymphocyte infusion depleted of alloreactive T-cells (ATIR101). ATIR101 was infused at a median of 28 days (range; 28-73) post-HSCT at a fixed dose of 2x10 6 CD3+ cells/kg, without use of post-transplant GVHD prophylaxis. Results: All patients engrafted rapidly after transplantation, with neutrophil and platelet engraftment achieved at a median of 12 days (range 8-34 and 9-35 respectively). Median follow-up (as of November 23 rd , 2015) is 292 days post-HSCT. A total of 19 patients were beyond 6 months post-HSCT, of which 15 were alive at that time, and 15 patients were already 12 months post-HSCT, of which 10 were alive. No patients developed grade III/IV acute GVHD after infusion of ATIR101. Two cases of grade II acute GVHD were reported with a delayed onset, starting only at day 173 and day 247 post-HSCT. No patient died within 100 days post-HSCT and there were 3 deaths as a result of TRM (all infections) within 6 months post-HSCT. When compared to a historic control group (N = 35), TRM was significantly lower in patients given ATIR101 after a T-cell depleted HSCT with a 6-month TRM for HSCT + ATIR101 of 15% versus 37% for HSCT only (Figure 1a ). Thus far two patients experienced a relapse within the first year, occurring at 60 and 90 days, respectively, post-HSCT. One patient died as a result of the disease relapse. The overall survival of patients given ATIR101 was significantly improved compared to a historic control group, with a 1-year survival of 75% in the HSCT+ATIR101 group and 20% in the control group ( Figure 1b) . Conclusion: Administration of a high dose of donor lymphocytes in ATIR101 from a haploidentical donor does not cause severe GVHD without use of prophylactic immune suppression. Addition of ATIR101 to a T-cell depleted HSCT protocol significantly improves transplantation outcome, with reduced TRM and improved OS. Moreover, the low number of relapses observed thus far is most encouraging and supports the hypothesis of preservation of T-cells in ATIR101 able to recognize leukemic antigens. Introduction: HaploSCT is a valid option for high risk acute leukemia (AL) patients (pts) who lack a matched related or unrelated donor. We aimed to evaluate if outcomes after unmanipulated HaploSCT could be shaped by number of HLA mismatches (HLAmm) or mismatches at specific HLA loci on unshared haplotype between pts and donors, possibly refining current criteria for haplo-donor selection. Material (or patients) and methods: We included adult pts with denovo AML (n = 403) and ALL (n = 156) reported to EBMT registry who underwent an HaploSCT as their first allograft in 2007-2014. We selected 559 donor-recipient pairs with molecular HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 typing at low (66%) or high (34%) resolution level. HLAmm were defined at antigen level. Results: Median follow-up for survivors was 19 months; median pts age at transplant was 44 (18-78) years (y); median donors age 38 (12-74) y. More than half of pts were in complete remission (36% CR1, 27% CR \u2265 2), 37% in active disease. Most transplants were performed using a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (55%) with busulfan-and fludarabine-based protocols being the most frequently used. Source of stem cells was peripheral blood for 60% of pts, bone marrow for 40%. In vivo T cell depletion with ATG was used in 35% of cases and 54% of pts received post-transplant Cyclophosphamide (PTCy) as backbone of GvHD prophylaxis, mostly associated with calcineurin inhibitors and mycophenolate mofetil. Overall, 55% of pairs had 4 HLAmm on unshared haplotype, 30% had 3 HLAmm, 12% had 2 HLAmm, 3% had 1 HLAmm. Among pairs with less than 4 HLAmm, 17% were matched at locus A, 11% at locus B, 18% at locus C and 17% at locus DRB1. In multivariate analysis including potential confounding factors (center effect, pts and donor age and sex, AL type, disease status, conditioning regimen intensity, stem cells source, in vivo T-cell depletion, PTCy), increasing number of HLAmm was not an independent risk factor for acute GvHD (HR 0.8, p 0.3) , chronic GvHD (HR 1.2, p 0.5), non-relapse mortality (NRM) (HR 1.2, p 0.4), relapse (HR 1, p 0.9), leukemiafree survival (HR 1.1, p 0.6) and overall survival (HR 1.2, p 0.3) . When the impact of match at specific loci was examined, mismatch at DRB1 locus was associated with higher cumulative incidence of grade 2-4 aGvHD at 100 days (34 \u00b1 5% in mismatched pairs, 21 \u00b1 8% in matched pairs, p 0.01). Moreover, mismatch at B locus was associated with higher 2y NRM (30 \u00b1 11% in mismatched pairs, 16 \u00b1 8% in matched pairs, p 0.03), mainly due by a tendency to higher rates of infections in mismatched compared to matched pairs (22 \u00b1 2% and 13 \u00b1 7% at 2y, respectively, p 0.08). After adjusting for covariates in multivariate analysis, mismatch at DRB1 was an independent risk factor for grade 2-4 aGvHD (HR 1.8, p 0.01) and mismatch at B locus was an independent risk factor for NRM (HR 2, p 0.04). Conclusion: In our series of 559 AL pts, number of HLAmm on unshared haplotype did not influence unmanipulated Hap-loSCT outcomes. However, mismatches at DRB1 locus and at B locus were independent risk factors for grade 2-4 aGvHD and NRM, respectively. Further studies will be needed to reveal if selection of haplo-donors based on optimal HLA matching could be useful to reduce some of the excess of morbidity associated with unmanipulated HaploSCT.

Introduction: \u03b1\u03b2 T cell-depleted haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HHCT) allows transfer of not only high numbers of CD34+ cells and \"innate-like\" immune cells such as \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, which can exert protective effects against leukemia cell growth and life-threatening infections. This study investigated reconstitution of T cell subsets early after \u03b1\u03b2 T lymphocyte-depleted HHCT and the clinical implications of peripheral \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in pediatric patients. Material (or patients) and methods: We analyzed forty-one pediatric patients who received HHCTs using \u03b1\u03b2 T celldepleted grafts between August 2012 and July 2015. Reconstitution of T lymphocyte subsets was monitored in peripheral blood by flow cytometry at day 14, 30, 60, 90, and 180 (\u00b110 days). The median age was 12.9 years. Diagnosis included acute leukemia (n = 20), severe aplastic anemia (n = 6), and others (n = 15). Results: The number of CD3+ T cells and CD8+ T cells recovered rapidly and reached donor levels at days 180 and 60, respectively. However, CD4+ T cell recovery was delayed and did not reach donor levels by day 180. Approximately 42% of patients showed 4100 CD4+ T cells/\u03bcl at day 60, and 76% of patients showed 4100 CD4+ T cells/\u03bcl at day 180. Delayed reconstitution of CD4+ T cells and the rapid CD8+ T cell immune reconstitution led to an inverse CD4/CD8 ratio consistently during the first 6 months after HHCT. At day 14 after HHCT, \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes predominantly consisted of the CD3+ T cells, with a median of 73.0 %. The \u03b3\u03b4 T cell population then gradually decreased, while the percentage of \u03b1\u03b2 T cells gradually increased. On day 14 after HHCT, analyses of \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subsets showed that 19.2% were na\u00efve, 31.7% were central memory, and 2.1% were effector memory. The percentage of na\u00efve \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes gradually increased between days 14 and 60 after HHCT, with statistical significance between days 30 and 60 (Po0.01). Patients with a low percentage (\u226421%) of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells at day 30 had significantly higher incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation compared to patients with a high percentage (470%) of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (100% vs. 25.0 \u00b1 21.7%, P = 0.04), suggesting protective role of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells on CMV reactivation. Grade II-IV acute GVHD occurred in 11 patients at a median 17 days. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells at day 14 were not associated with acute GVHD. However, patients with a high percentage of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells at day 30 showed no grade II-IV acute GVHD, while patients with low/average percentage of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells showed higher incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD (40.9 \u00b1 10.0%, P = 0.05). Data is limited to determine if \u03b3\u03b4 T cells at day 30 represent the immunologic status of acute GVHD itself or consequences of immune suppressants for acute GVHD in \u03b1\u03b2 T cell-depleted HHCT. At day 30, percentages of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in patients who relapsed were lower compared with patients who did not relapse with borderline statistical significance (median 33.3% vs. 51.6%, P = 0.05). Conclusion: This study established detailed data of reconstitution of T cell subsets after \u03b1\u03b2 T cell-depleted HHCT, and provided a platform for further researches regarding immune reconstitution after HHCT. Data suggests that early recovery of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells decreases the risk of CMV reactivation. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in GVHD and their anti-leukemic effects in properly designed large clinical trials. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Due to a safe toxicity profile HLA-haploidentical transplantation (haplo-HSCT) using T-cell-replete (TCR) grafts and high-dose cyclophosphamide post-transplantation (PTCY) has found increasing acceptance. However, in patients with high-risk and advanced disease outcome was limited due to a high relapse incidence, in particular when the underlying disease was of myeloid origin. In HLA-matched transplantation it has been shown that sequential therapy comprising cytoreductive chemotherapy and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) can provide sufficient disease control and favourable outcome in patients with high-risk and refractory AML and MDS (Schmid C JCO 2005). Material (or patients) and methods: To evaluate the feasibility and outcome of sequential therapy in the context of haplo-HSCT utilizing TCR grafts and PTCY in patients with relapsed and refractory AML and MDS, we retrospectively analyzed the course of 35 patients (AML n = 25; sAML n = 7, MDS n = 3; median age: 62 years; male n = 17) transplanted between 2009 and 2015. All patients presented with active disease at time of transplant (primary refractory n = 6; relapsed n = 7; relapsed and refractory n = 16; upfront n = 5). All patients received sequential therapy prior to haplo-HSCT combining cytoreductive chemotherapy (FLAMSA n = 19; clofarabine n = 14; others n = 2) and RIC. Conditioning was drug-based in 23 patients receiving fludarabine, cyclophosphamide (CY) and melphalan (110 mg/m2) while it was TBI-based (4 Gy) in the others (n = 12). Post-grafting immunosuppression was high-dose CY given on day +3 and +4, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (both started on day +5).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2072, "end": 2075, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2351, "end": 2354, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2663, "end": 2666, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9080, "end": 9086, "text": "0-1.8)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 13244, "end": 13252, "text": "(HR 0.8,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 13253, "end": 13259, "text": "p 0.3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 13419, "end": 13427, "text": "(HR 1.2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 13428, "end": 13434, "text": "p 0.3)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 4170, "end": 4177, "text": "(Fig 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF29"}, {"start": 10371, "end": 10381, "text": "(Figure 1a", "ref_id": "FIGREF29"}, {"start": 10758, "end": 10768, "text": "Figure 1b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF29"}], "section": "O036"}, {"text": "Unstimulated bone marrow was the graft source in 17 patients.

Acute GvHD grade II-IV occurred in 12 patients (34 %) while it was severe in only 2 (6 %). Chronic GvHD was observed in 7 patients (20 %), and was moderate in 3 (9 %) and severe in 2 patients (6 %). No patient developed VOD. Kidney failure requiring hemodialysis occurred in 4 patients. CMV reactivation was observed in 14 of 26 patients at risk (54 %), while only one patient developed CMV colitis; no PTLD was observed. Invasive fungal infection was diagnosed 8 patients. One-year CI of NRM was 21 % (95% CI 9-36). CR and fully donor chimerism was achieved in 27 patients at day +30. Eleven patients relapsed; one and twoyear CI of relapse was 33 % (95 % CI 17-49), both.

Conclusion: Sequential therapy in the setting of TCR haplo-HSCT using RIC and PTCY is well tolerated with low rates of GvHD and acceptable NRM in patients with advanced AML and MDS, while providing an effective anti-leukemic activity in relapsed and refractory disease. Thus, we suggest that by utilizing sequential therapy in TCR/PTCY haplo-HSCT donor availability can be expanded in patients with advanced AML/ MDS who lack a conventional donor or need promptly access to a donor due to aggressive disease.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to support normal hematopoiesis in vivo and to display potent immunosuppressive effects to prevent or treat GVHD after HSCT. Material (or patients) and methods: In a multicenter phase II trial, 44 patients with SAA were included, who were new diagnosed or failed to response to previous S30 immunosuppressive therapy and were transfused frequently. We developed an approach with cotransplantation the culture-expanded third-party related-donor-derived bone marrow (BM)-MSCs in patients undergoing alternative donor transplantation without T-cell-depletion. 3.6 (range 3.2 to 4.1) \u00d7 10 6 / kg BM-MSCs were transfused to patients by venous for 2 times, 6 hours before the infusion of hematopoietic stem cells at day 01 and at day +14 after transplantation. The conditioning regimens included busulfan (BU), cyclophosphamide (CY) and thymoglobulin (ATG) The recipients received cyclosporin A (CsA), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and short-term methotrexate (MTX) for GVHD prophylaxis. Three of 44 patients died before stem cell engraftmet and were excluded. Results: Only one patient didn't achieve hematopoietic reconstitution among the 41 evaluable patients. The median time for myeloid engraftment was 12 days (range 8-21 days) and for platelets engraftment was 19 days (range 8-154 days). The 41 evaluable patients achieved sustained full donor chimerism without any adverse BM-MSC infusion-related events. The incidence was 29.3% for grade II-IV acute GVHD and 14.6% for chronic GVHD.

Introduction: Recipients of cord blood (CBT), T-cell depleted (TCD) and mismatched unrelated donors (URD) allografts are at high risk for invasive mold infections (IMI). The impact of mold-active prophylaxis on the incidence and outcomes of mold infections is not well defined. Material (or patients) and methods: We conducted a retrospective review of 988 consecutive adults who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) in our center from 2008 through 2014. Standard prophylaxis consisted of micafungin 150mg IV daily from admission to day (D) +7 post-HCT followed by voriconazole through at least D+100. Prophylaxis was continued beyond D+100 in patients with GVHD or use of corticosteroids. Patients with intolerance or contraindication to voriconazole received posaconazole or micafungin. Patients with IMI were identified through microbiology and pathology records. Cases meeting criteria for proven or probable according to EORTC-MSG criteria are included in the analysis.

Twenty-two patients (2.2%) developed IMI at a median of 229 days (range 7-1327) after HCT. Nineteen (86%) cases were probable and 3 (14%) proven. Microbiological diagnosis was established in 9 cases (Aspergillus = 4, Mucor = 2, Absidia = 1, Rhizomucor = 1 and concomitant Rhizopus + Aspergillus = 1). Thirteen (59%) patients were diagnosed with probable IMI by positive Beta-D-Glucan assay, compatible radiological findings and host factors. Pneumonia was the most presentation (n = 19, 86%). Thirteen (59%) patients had received systemic corticosteroids within 30 days prior to diagnosis, 11 for GVHD. Ten of the 22 pts (45%) were not receiving the planned anti-mold prophylaxis at the time of IMI, due to azole-related toxicity (n = 7), drug allergy (n = 1), patient preference (n = 1) and unknown reason (n = 1). Three patients were off prophylaxis as they were beyond day +100 and had no additional risk factors. No risk factors for development of IMI were identified, due to low number of events.

Introduction: Hematological malignancies affect mainly patients above 60 years, an age group considered \"elderly\" in hematology. To estimate the risk and benefits of a potentially curative treatment option such as hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) while frequently facing limitations in physical or mental reserves is a difficult medical task. Comprehensive Geriatric and Quality of Life Assessment (CGA/QOL) provides detailed information on critical aspects.

Currently, results after HLA-matched unrelated donors (MUD) transplants nearly equal those using HLA-identical sibling (SIB) donors. Relapses, however, remain the major cause of treatment failure necessitating novel strategies to further improve disease control. Results from adult AML studies identified a donor KIR B haplotype being beneficial for leukemia control. This effect, however, varied depending on disease, donor type, conditioning intensity and potential graft manipulation. Material (or patients) and methods: We analysed the impact of donor KIR B haplotype and chromosomal position in 209 children with ALL that were treated on the ALL-SCT-BFM-2003 trial. Results from this trial showed remission status (CR1 vs CR2) but not donor type (SIB vs MUD) or stem cell source to be a prognostic factor for outcome. Genotyping of 14 KIR genes was performed in 209 stem cell donors (65 SIB, 144 MUD) using polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primers (Uhrberg, Immunogenetics 2002) . KIR B gene content score according to Cooley (Blood, 2010), chromosomal position, and a newly developed composite KIR score incorporating KIR B haplotype presence and the respective chromosomal position were retrospectively analysed for its association with disease outcome. For statistics the Kaplan-Meier method and cumulative incidence estimates were utilized. Results: The KIR B content score (B) (defined as the number of KIR B gene motifs present in the genome (range 0 to 4)) identified high score donors (7%) only (score 3/4) to be associated with a low relapse incidence (8 \u00b1 2%, RI \u00b1 SD) However, low scoring donors (0 to 2, 93% of donors) did not show this segregation (RI for B = 0: 22 \u00b1 5% vs B = 1: 24 \u00b1 5% vs B = 2: 29 \u00b1 7%). When comparing donors in terms of presence vs absence of a KIR B motif in the centromeric and telomeric region separately, we found RIs of 16 \u00b1 4% (B present) vs 30 \u00b1 5% (B absent) for centromeric and 31 \u00b1 5% (B present) vs 18 \u00b1 4% (B absent) for telomeric regions, respectively (Po0.05 and 0.06). Incorporating this dichotomous role (centromeric vs telomeric KIR B motif presence) into a new composite KIR B score proved to classify ALL transplant recipients with low, moderate or high RI of 13 \u00b1 5% vs 21 \u00b1 4% vs 40 \u00b1 8% (Po0.01). This translated into statistically relevant differences in EFS after transplantation when using donors of distinct composite KIR B scores: 59 \u00b1 8% for neutral (n = 45) vs 73 \u00b1 4% for better (n = 108) vs 79 \u00b1 6% for best donor (n = 56; P o0.05). Of note, the predictive power of this score even proofed to be reproducible in a subgroup analysis of MUD transplants. Conclusion: In contrast to recently published adult AML transplant data, we found that with regard to donor selection the combination of a missing telomeric KIR B motif with the presence of a centromeric KIR B motif results in improved leukemia control in children transplanted for ALL. Consequently, donor selection with a special focus on KIR B content and chromosomal position might prospectively reduce relapse rates substantially and warrants critical review of currently applied donor selection criteria for this group of patients.

Marsh 1,* , T. Fukuda 1 , A. Vinks 1 , P. Mehta 1 1 Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, United States Introduction: We recently defined an optimal target range for Day 0 alemtuzumab concentration of 0.2-0.4ug/mL that will potentially balance the risks of acute graft vs host disease (GVHD) and mixed chimerism, and maximize lymphocyte recovery following alemtuzumab, fludarabine, and melphalan reduced intensity conditioning hematopoietic cell transplantation (RIC HCT) (Marsh et al, Blood, pending) . The aim of this study was to prospectively study the pharmacokinetics (PK) of alemtuzumab when given subcutaneously to pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic HCT in order to develop a population PK model to use for a Precision Dosing Trial. Material (or patients) and methods: Twenty patients with non-malignant diseases receiving an alemtuzumab, fludarabine, and melphalan RIC regimen were enrolled. Seventeen patients received 1mg/kg alemtuzumab divided over 5 days subcutaneously, starting on day -14, and were included in the data analysis. The median age was 7 years (range 0.5-18 years). Blood samples were drawn for PK measurement at pre-dose, 30 minutes, and 8 hours after each dose, followed by daily levels until day +2, and weekly levels for 8 weeks. Absolute lymphocyte counts were recorded from the daily CBC results obtained as part of routine clinical care. Alemtuzumab concentrations were measured by a validated flow cytometric assay. Descriptive PK analysis was conducted using standard non-compartmental methods. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC 0-336h ) was determined using the trapezoidal rule. Pre-transplant terminal half-life (T\u00bd) and elimination rate constant (ke) were calculated based on concentrations at day -7 to 0 (transplant day). Results: Standard PK parameters are included in Table 1 . The Median alemtuzumab concentration at day 0 was 1.27ug/mL (range 0 to 2.56ug/mL). Fourteen of 17 patients had concentrations of greater than 0.4ug/mL at day 0 while 2 patients showed concentrations within the predefined target range of 0.2-0.4ug/mL. Day 0 levels correlated negatively with pre-dose ALC (data not shown). Some correlation of Day 0 levels with underlying diagnosis was also observed, as a trend towards decreased levels in patients with HLH was observed (P = 0.07). The median terminal t \u00bd was 5.2 days. Day 0 concentrations correlated positively with concentrations at Day -7 and AUC, and inversely with alemtuzumab elimination rate (data not shown). Conclusion: Here we report the PK of subcutaneous alemtuzumab given to pediatric allogeneic HCT patients. Almost all patients had persistence of lytic levels of alemtuzumab beyond day 0, at levels which are in excess of that needed to reduce the risk of acute GVHD. Levels correlated with pre-transplant ALC, and also diagnosis. These results will allow the development of a Precision Dosing Algorithm to attain optimal alemtuzumab levels at Day 0 in order to balance the risks of acute GVHD and mixed chimerism and maximize lymphocyte recovery following alemtuzumab, fludarabine, and melphalan RIC HCT.

Introduction: Allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a potential cure for children with AML and MDS. Traditional full myeloablative regimens containing busulfan are the most commonly used for children with AML/MDS. These regimens are effective, but are limited in part by toxicity and transplant-related mortality (TRM). Treosulfan is a bifunctional alkylator recently evaluated in HCT regimens for children and adults, with the goal of reducing toxicity and TRM. We present the results of a multicentre, prospective phase II study evaluating the safety, preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a Treosulfan-based regimen in children with AML or MDS undergoing allo-HCT. Material (or patients) and methods: Forty patients were enrolled at 13 centres in the United States from Sep 2013 to Apr 2014. Median age was 11 years (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) . Patients were transplanted for AML (n = 32) in first (n = 18), second (n = 11), third or greater CR (n = 3), or MDS (n = 8). Stem cell sources included bone marrow (BM, n = 25), peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC, n = 6), or cord blood (CB, n = 9). Of the 31 PBSC/BM grafts, 10 were from HLA-matched relatives and 21 from unrelated donors. All CB donors were unrelated, 2 recipients of double CB grafts. The regimen consisted of Treosulfan IV at a dose of 10, 12, or 14 g/m 2 /day (based on BSA of \u2264 0.5, 4 0.5 -1.0 and 4 1.0 m 2 , respectively) on days -6 to -4, Fludarabine (30 mg/m 2 /day) IV on days -6 to -2 and 200 cGy TBI on day -1. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis for those receiving BM or PBSC was with tacrolimus/methotrexate, and cyclosporine/mycophenolate for CB. Serial blood samples (1 mL) were collected for 19 patients weighing o 40 kg for PK studies prior to and after the treosulfan infusion (0, 20, 40 min, and 1,2,3,4,5 & 24 hours post infusion). Samples were batched and analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography with refractometrical detection. Parameters analysed included area under the curve (AUC), maximum concentration (Cmax), half life (t \u00bd), volume of distribution (Vss) and total clearance (Cl). Results: One year overall (82%) and disease-free survival (72%) are excellent and similar to those expected with conventional myeloablative regimens in children. The 1-year relapse rate was 25%, 28% for AML and 13% for MDS. Cumulative incidence of TRM at one year was remarkably low at 3%, with one death due to GVHD. All other deaths (n = 7) were from relapse. No serious organ toxicities were observed, including sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Trilineage engraftment was seen in all patients. Cumulative incidences of grade II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD by day 100 were 19% and 9%, respectively. Chronic GVHD developed in 31% of patients by 1 year. BSAbased treosulfan dosing reliably resulted in predictable AUC and Cmax, which is required for dosing without measuring PK (Table 1) . Though there were significant differences observed in Cl and Vss across treosulfan dose groups, these differences did not seem to impact disease control or regimen toxicity. Introduction: Evaluation of the risk factors in high risk metastatic neuroblastoma (NBL) patients (pts) treated with busulfan-melphalan (BUMEL) in the HR-NBL1/SIOPEN trial. Material (or patients) and methods: Since 02/02/2002, 901 patients received BUMEL and were accrued in 20 countries (149 centres). All stage 4 pts 41year (yr) at diagnosis up to 21 yrs were eligible whereas pts o1year only in the presence of MYCN amplification (MNA). After Rapid Cojec or modified N7 induction, pts with insufficient response received additional 2 nd line treatments (i.e. TVD 2-4 courses) to proceed to BUMEL myeloablative therapy. Local control aimed at complete surgical resection (achieved in 76%) and radiotherapy of 21 Gy was given only to the primary tumour site. Till 2007 maintenance treatment was 13cis RA alone. In 2007 ch14.18/ CHO mAb based immunotherapy (IT) was introduced. The median age at diagnosis is 3.0yrs (range, 1month-19yrs). At diagnosis 127pts were \u2264 1.5 yrs, 600 between 1.5 to 5 yrs and 174 45yrs. MNA was present in 340pts. Additional TVD was reported for 254 patient. Intravenous busulfan was used in 600pts. Response prior to BUMEL was CR in 282pts (24% with TVD), VGPR in 322pts (31% with TVD), PR in 224 pts (29% with TVD) whereas response was not specified in 73 pts (27 % had TVD).

Material (or patients) and methods: We report outcomes after HLA-matched sibling HSCT of 1,000 pts with SCD transplanted in EBMT or CIBMTR centers. HSCT were performed between 1986 and 2013; n = 439 from CIBMTR and n = 561 from EBMT centers. Results: Median age at HSCT was 9 years (1-54y); 85% of pts were aged o16 years and 94% were homozygotes for hemoglobin S. The most common indication for HSCT was stroke. Other indications included: central nervous system event lasting longer than 24 hours, elevated cerebral arterial velocity, acute chest syndrome and vaso-occlusive crisis requiring hospitalization. Most HSCTs (87%) used myeloablative-conditioning regimens. Most pts received in vivo T-cell depletion (71%). The predominant GVHD prophylaxis was cyclosporine+methotrexate (56%). The cell sources for HSCT were bone marrow, BM (84%), cord blood, CB (9%) and peripheral blood, PB (7%). The median follow-up was 45 (1.1-324.6) months. The cumulative incidence function (CIF) of neutrophil engraftment at day+60 was 98% (96.6% for CB, 98.3% for BM and 95.2% for PB). The CIF of platelet engraftment was 98% (96 \u00b1 2% for CB, 99 \u00b1 1% for BM and 98 \u00b1 9% for PBSC). Forty-five pts experienced secondary graft failure; 67 pts died mainly due to GVH or infection. The 3-year overall (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 94% and 90%, respectively. According to stem cell source, 3-year OS was 99% after CB, 94% after BM and 80% after PBS (Po0.0001). In multivariate analysis, every year in age increment (HR 1.1, 95%CI 1.07-1.14, P o0.001) and use of PB (HR 3.43, 95% CI 1.49-7.88, P = 0.004) was associated with higher mortality. EFS was lower with every year in age increment (HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.04-1.1, Po 0.001), PB grafts (HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.01-4.08, P = 0.48). CI of acute GVHD grade 2-4 was 14.4% (12.2-16.7) of chronic GVH 13.3% (11-15.8). Risks of acute GVHD were higher with increasing age (HR 1.04 95%CI 1.01-1.07, P = 0.008). None of the variables tested were associated with chronic GVHD. Conclusion: This large registry based international study shows that HLA identical sibling transplant is successful in more than 90% of the pts with severe SCD with limited transplant related complications (rejection, GVHD). Strategies aimed at lowering graft failure and GVHD are desirable to further optimize the observed 3-year event-free survival. Importantly, these data should increase awareness to early referral to HSCT of pts with severe SCD. Disclosure of Interest: None declared.

Results: Transplants comprised n = 9 unrelated (n = 7 HLA-10-/10 and n = 2 HLA-9/10) and n = 4 related HLA-identical donors. The donor sources were n = 7 BM, n = 4 PBSC and n = 2 CB. Intravenous total busulfan doses ranged between 4.4 and 17.2 mg/kg (median 12 mg/kg) corresponding to cumulative AUC of 48-77 mg/Lxh (median 63.5). Fludarabine was administered at a total dose 180 mg/sqm (n = 10) or 6 x 1.2 mg/kg (n = 3) depending on body weight. Serotherapy comprised alemtuzumab (n = 9; range 0.8 -2.5, median 0.6 mg/kg) and ATG (n = 1, ATG-Fresenius, 40 mg/kg; n = 3, Thymoglobuline 7.5 mg/kg). All patients engrafted. No graft failures, 2 cases of reversible VOD and one case of reversible pulmonary hypertension was observed. After a median follow-up of 34 months (range 4-65 mo), the overall and event free survival rates are 100/100%, respectively. The rates of acute GVHD III-IV and of cGHVD were 0/0%, respectively, at last follow-up. All surviving patients exhibit a stable myeloid donor chimerism (n = 3 80-90%; n = 9 495%). Results: 119 transplants were performed in 97 patients. The median age at first HSCT was 13.4 months (range 3.9 -66 months; the median age in pre-2004 was 14.3 months and post-2004 was 12.4 months (P = 0.154) ). The graft source was marrow (n = 49, 50.5%), peripheral blood (n = 15, 15.5) and cord blood (n = 33, 34%). The 5-year overall survival improved from 66.7% to 90.2% while the 5-year event-free survival increased from 30.6% to 83.6% in modern era. The incidence of graft failure reduced significantly from 47.2% (17/36 patients) pre-2004 to 8.1% (5/61 patients) in the modern era. Of the 17 patients (21.9%) with graft failure pre 2004, most (n = 14) had late graft failure with autologous reconstitution and 3 had primary aplasia. In the modern era, 30 patients (49%) received cord blood transplant and the remaining 31 patients (51%) received either marrow (n = 20, 32.7%) or peripheral blood (n = 13, 21.3%). All the 5 patients with graft failure received 6/6 cord blood transplant. 3 had primary aplasia whereas 2 had secondary aplasia after they had achieved prior donor-derived engraftment with red cell and platelet transfusion independence. Predictors for graft failure were analysed. All 5 patients received second transplants (2 second CB; 2 marrow; 1 PB). 4 were alive and engrafted while one died of adenovirus pneumonitis. Conclusion: The pattern of graft failure has changed from primarily autologous reconstitution in pre-Bu pK era to marrow aplasia (both primary engraftment failure and a unique, late, immune-mediated aplasia after FluBu) following cord HSCT in the modern era.

Introduction: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a disorder caused by a defect in the metabolism of very long chain fatty acids leading to demyelination and neurodegeneration. The most severe form of X-ALD is the cerebral variant, which typically leads to severe disability and death during the first two decades. To date, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only treatment that has shown to significantly change the natural history of the disease, enhancing survival and stabilizing neurologic lesions and symptoms. Only 30% of patients who might benefit from HSCT will have a full HLA-matched donor. In these urgent situations, haploidentical family members might be an option for these rapidly progressing diseases. Haploidentical HSCT using posttransplant cyclophosphamide has been performed in series of malignant and non-malignant diseases and has shown similar outcomes compared to other alternative donor sources. Here we show our experience with 9 patients with X-ALD treated with haploidentical HSCT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide. Material (or patients) and methods: Between november 2012 and august 2014, 9 patients with X-ALD (ages 6 to 18 years) underwent 12 related haploidentical HSCT in two different institutions, three patients received second transplants with different related donors. One patient received a second transplant after failure of a double cord blood transplant. Pre-transplant MRI showed Loes score of 2,5 to 18, all patients had neuropsychological evaluation with performance IQ above 90. Donor was the father (n = 8), the uncle (n = 3) or brother (n = 1). Eight patients received reduced toxicity conditioning regimen consisted of: fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 on days \u2212 6 to \u2212 2, cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg on days \u2212 6 and \u2212 5, and total body irradiation 2 Gy on day \u2212 1. Six patients received also rabbit antithymocyte globulin 0.5 mg/kg on day \u2212 9 and 2 mg/kg on days \u2212 8 and \u2212 7. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg/d on days +3 and +4, tacrolimus or cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil starting on day +5. Results: Seven patients engrafted, 13 to 18 days after transplant. One patient had a primary graft failure and was not eligible for a second transplant due to severe progression of neurological symptoms. Three patients had secondary graft failure with progressive loss of donor chimerism and were successfully rescued with second haploidentical transplants using different related donors. One patient developed late graft failure and is waiting for a second transplant. After this initial disappointing experience with 5 out of 8 patients developing graft failure we changed the conditioning regimen and a patient received same Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide regimen associated with 4Gy total lymphoid irradiation. Eight patients are alive and engrafted from 20 to 33 months after first and second transplants, with chimerism from 80 to 100% donor cells. Seven patients had neurologic progression of symptoms reflecting either advanced disease at transplant or progression after HSCT. Conclusion: In conclusion, haploidentical HSCT with posttransplant cyclophosphamide is a feasible alternative for X-ALD lacking a suitable matched donor. Graft failure is still an obstacle that has to be better prevented. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a rare X-linked immunodeficiency, characterized by microthrombocytopenia, recurrent infections, eczema and high risk for the development of malignancy and autoimmune diseases. It is caused by mutation in the WASP gene, which effects on the expression of the WASp protein, a hematopoietic cytosketal protein. The only curative therapy for WAS is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which has to be performed at an early age, while gene therapy is under study. Material (or patients) and methods: We retrospectively analyzed our experience with 39 WAS patients followed from 1990 to 2015 at the Children Hospital of Brescia, Italy. All the patients presented, at diagnosis, microthrombocytopenia, clinic features valuated with Zhu's score and mutation of the WASP gene. In 32 patients we evaluated the expression of WASp protein on blood cells, which was absent or reduced. In all patients diagnosis was confirmed by molecular analysis. 37 patients underwent HSCT, of whom 6 patients from a related identical donor (RID), 3 from a mismatched related donor (MMRD) and 28 from matched related donor (MUD). Results: Overall survival is 72% (27/37). All the RID BMT (6/6) and 80% (22/28) of MUD BMT recipients survived, while the 3 MMRD BMT recipients died. Deaths are related to severe infections and bleedings. All the RID BMT recipients are fine and well, while among the MUD BMT recipients survived, 58% (10/17) presented symptoms related to microthrombocytopenia, autoimmune hypothyroidism and skin's affections. Hematopoietic stem cells engraftment was present in 95% of the patients. In some cases we observed a reduction of donor chimerism but we noticed that at least 30% can guarantee S48 platelets production. Mean platelets count after BMT was 237.880 mm3. Conclusion: HSCT remains the gold standard therapy for WAS, although we should make more effort in reducing its complications and late effects.

Introduction: Since the first transplantation in a patient with Wiscott-Aldrich in 1968, HSCT has become a routine curative therapy for WAS, with progressively improving outcomes. TCRab/CD19 depletion is a new method of graft manipulation aimed at reduction of GVHD in allogeneic HSCT. We present our experience with TCRab/CD19 depleted HSCT in both haploidentical and unrelated donor transplants in patients with WAS. Material (or patients) and methods: Between 2012 -2015 twelve WAS patients were transplanted with TCRab/CD19 depleted grafts in our center. Median age at HSCT was 1.6 years (0, 6) . Ten patients received transplants from unrelated donors (1 -8/10; 3 -9/10; 6 -10/10 HLA matched) and two -from haploidentical donors(mothers). Eleven received Fludarabine 150mg/m 2 /Treosulfan 36-42g/m 2 -based conditioning, one additionally received Melphalan 140mg/m 2 . Eleven received serotherapy, one patient with severe preexisting CMV infection received only cyclophosphamide 100 mg/ kg. All received calcineurin inhibitor for GVHD prophylaxis, nine also received a short course of methotrexate. Average dose of infused CD34+ cells was 11,9\u044510*6/kg (8, (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) 3) , TCRab cells 12,3\u044510*3/kg (3, 5) . Results: Engraftment has been achieved in all patients; median neutrophil engraftment time was 17 days (13-28), median platelet engraftment time -13 days (7-17). Cumulative incidence of acute GVHD grade 2 was 0,33, all cases responded to steroids, none of the patients developed aGVHD grade 3-4. The incidence of chronic GVHD was 0,28. Cumulative incidence of CMV reactivation was 0,58. Frequency of CMV disease was 33,3% (three patients -CMV retinitis, one -CMV encephalitis, retinitis). One patient with severe pretransplant CMV infection with high viremia and retinitis was excluded from the analysis of CMV disease. There were no cases of PTLD. The median follow up -18,2 months (1, . Overall survival after HSCT was 0,92, one patient died of acute ADV hepatitis, the cumulative TRM was 0,08. Event-free survival (graft rejection, death were counted as events) was 0,75. Two patients (after MUD HSCT) rejected grafts 2,3 and 2,7 months post-HSCT, respectively. The incidence of rejection was 0,17. Both patients are alive after retransplantations. Seven patients had 490% donor chimerism at last follow up. Three had persistent mixed chimerism (27-80% donor), predominantly in myeloid lineage, but had normal or moderately decreased platelet and neutrophil counts. One patient required donor lymphocyte infusions and another one received boost infusion of stem cells. All patients had good (74-99% donor) CD3+ chimerism with adequate kinetics of the immune recovery. Conclusion: TCRab/CD19 depletion is a promising method of graft manipulation for unrelated and haploidentical HSCT in patients with WAS. Our small series demonstrate low incidence of severe GVHD and viral reactivations. The problem of high incidence of rejection and mixed chimerism may be resolved by addition of a second alkylating agent to the conditioning regimen. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: \u00ab Drepagreffe \u00bb is a French national prospective trial (AP-HP, NCT 01340404) involving SCA-children, younger than 15 years, placed on long-term transfusion program (TP) because of a history of abnormal-TCD (TAMMX \u2265 200 cm/sec), and comparing for the first time the outcome of cerebral vasculopathy following TP or HSCT. The 2 arms were defined by the random availability of a genoidentical donor. Patients with at least one non-SCA sibling, and parents accepting HLA typing and HSCT if a genoidentical donor was available were included (n = 67) Material (or patients) and methods: 7/67 patients had a history of stroke. Transplanted patients (n = 32) received a conditioning regimen of Busilvex, CY200 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg rabbit-ATG with CSA and a short course of MTX or MMF for GvHD prophylaxis. In the TP arm (n = 35), HbS% was maintained at o 30%, with an Hb at 9-11g/dL. At enrollment and 1 year post enrollment, blood screening, Doppler, and cerebral MRI/MRA were performed along with cognitive performance testing, the latter being done in parallel in the non-SCA siblings. Preliminary findings on cerebral velocities as the primary endpoint were reported at the last EBMT meeting and demonstrated that all patients were alive and that the 32 transplanted patients had no chronic GVHD and the same hemoglobin profile as their donor. Velocities were significantly lower post-HSCT than under TP (P o0.001), and were normalized in a greater number of patients (P = 0.005). We report here the cerebral imaging and cognitive performance data performed at enrollment and 1 year. A scoring system was used for classify ischemic lesions, atrophia on MRI and stenoses and Moya on MRA. Cognitive testing using the WPPSI-3, WISC-4 or WAIS-3 scales, depending on the age, was performed in patients and in siblings when possible. Results: MRI/MRA data were available in 66/67 patients. At enrollment (M0), ischemic lesions and stenoses were present in 25 and 35/66 patients, respectively. Cognitive testing was obtained in 64 patients and 56 siblings. Paired analysis with siblings showed significant differences in Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) with a mean difference of 7.6 \u00b1 14.5(P o0.001), Processing Speed Index (PSI) 6.3 \u00b1 20.5 (P = 0.04), and Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) 7.3 \u00b1 15.0 (P = 0.01). After exclusion of the 7 patients with stroke history, significant differences were still observed in VCI (P = 0.013) and FSIQ (P = 0.019). Patient cognitive performance indexes were correlated negatively and significantly with the MRI and MRA scores. At 1 year, one new patient developed ischemic lesions in the TP arm but none in the HSCT arm. MRI/MRA scores were not different at 1 year between 2 arms. However a significant improvement in the MRA score was observed post-HSCT but only in no-stroke patients. The cognitive tests performed at 1 year showed better results in the TP arm; however the difference between 2 arms was not significant.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 58, "end": 76, "text": "(6/2009 to 6/2015)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 8481, "end": 8496, "text": "AJ et al. 2015;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 8497, "end": 8503, "text": "11 (9)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9173, "end": 9176, "text": "(0,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9177, "end": 9179, "text": "6)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9738, "end": 9741, "text": "(8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 9742, "end": 9745, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 9746, "end": 9749, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9750, "end": 9754, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9755, "end": 9759, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9760, "end": 9764, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9765, "end": 9769, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9770, "end": 9774, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9775, "end": 9779, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9780, "end": 9784, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9785, "end": 9789, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9790, "end": 9794, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9795, "end": 9799, "text": "(19)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9800, "end": 9804, "text": "(20)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9805, "end": 9809, "text": "(21)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9810, "end": 9812, "text": "3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9840, "end": 9843, "text": "(3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9844, "end": 9846, "text": "5)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 10532, "end": 10535, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O067"}, {"text": "Conclusion: Patients with a history of abnormal-TCD had significantly lower cognitive performances than their siblings, even in absence of stroke history.

Introduction: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) to cure thalassemia major (TM) is an established modality but its role in management of thalassemia intermedia (TI) is still not very clear. Most of the centers use individualized approach for every patient which is quite apt looking at the phenotypic variability of TI. HSCT can be considered for patients who fall at the other spectrum of TI close to TM. We present our experience of HSCT in patients with TI. Material (or patients) and methods: Twenty one patients diagnosed as TI (based on transfusion initiated after 2 years of age) underwent matched sibling HSCT. Mean age at diagnosis was 3.2 years, mean number of transfusions received before HSCT were 82 PRBC transfusions. Six patients were splenectomized whereas 15 had splenomegaly. All the patients were conditioned with iv busulfan 3.2mg/kg x 4days, iv cyclophosphamide 50mg/kg x 4 days and horse ATG (ATGAM) 30mg/kg x 3 days. GVHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine 3mg/kg in two divided doses starting D-3 and inj methotrexate 10mg/m2 on D+1 followed by 7mg/m2 on D+3,+6,+11. Bone marrow (BM) was used as a source in 15 whereas peripheral blood (PB) was used in 6 patients. Median CD34 cell dose was 3.68x10 6 cells/kg and median MNC count was 3.27x10 8 cell/kg. Results: Median polymorphonuclear cell and platelet engraftment were seen on D+ 14 and D+ 27.5 respectively. Whole blood chimerism on day+21 and day+60 were 83.40% and 73.97% donor cells. Median engraftment of polymorphonuclear cell and platelets in splenectomized patients was 11 days and 29 days respectively and 16 days and 27 days in the non splenectomized group. Chimerism in the splenectomized patients on day+21 and day+60 was 93.71% and 78.46% respectively whereas in the non splenectomized group was 78.98% and 72.04% respectively. Grade 2-4 GVH was seen in 4 patients (19.04%) whereas grade 3-4 was seen in 1 patient (4.8%). At a median follow up of 606 days the overall survival is 95.2% and disease free survival is 80.95% (1 expired, 2 rejected). Conclusion: HSCT can safely be used as a curative modality for selected group of TI patients with good overall and event free survival. This option should be explored more often in TI so as to offer these patients better quality of life. From our observation splenectomized patients far well as compared to patients with splenomegaly undergoing HSCT.

Bonini 12 on behalf of CTIWP on behalf of CTIWP 1 Blood Transfusion Center, Swiss Red Cross, 2 Introduction: There is considerable heterogeneity in processing of stem cells (SC) for transplantation (HSCT) across Europe. The FACT-JACIE International Standards have been developed to improve the quality of HSCT. At the same time they aim to avoid restrictions and leave some practices to the discretion of the individual transplant center (TC). This survey aims to better understand the extent of heterogeneity in storage conditions, graft processing and disposal. Material (or patients) and methods: A questionnaire regarding graft storage conditions, processing and disposal was developed and reviewed by the CTIWP of the EBMT. EBMT TC were invited to participate in this survey. Results: 299 TC from 46 countries (32 European, 14 associated) responded to the survey. 231 (77%) questionnaires were complete. Fifteen TC (5%) do not currently have a SC processing facility. 73% of teams may store grafts overnight before freezing or infusion. Grafts are kept mostly at 4 \u00b1 2\u00b0C. For long-term storage, 70% store at -175\u00b0C, either in liquid nitrogen (22%) or in vapour phase (38%). 26% of all responding TC store both in liquid and vapour nitrogen. Potentially infectious grafts were mostly stored in an additional bag and in 54% in a separate tank. In case of microbiological contamination, most TC make a case-by-case decision in collaboration with the clinicians. CD34 counts are performed according to ISHAGE standards either before or after thawing or both (54%) and are done using a single platform method in 81% of TC using commercially available kits (99%). This method is based on the use of a nucleic acid dye for identification of the necrotic cells in 74% of teams. Most of the teams (81%) report quality control results to the clinicians (98% CD34 counts, 59% CD3 counts and 29% report additional information). Most TC (74%) preserve grafts using 10% DMSO and use a rate controlled freezing system (90%). The cells are not washed (83%), and are thawed at the bedside (68%) in a water bath (78%). There is a large heterogeneity between the TC regarding delivery to the transplant unit and the maximum delay within which thawed cells have to be infused. 79% of responding TC have a written policy for the handling of unused SC products, which is usually part of the patient information and consent document signed before collection. Time limitation on storage for autologous SC products exists in 42% of TC (in most TC limited to 5-10 years) and duration of storage is not disease or age dependent. For donor lymphocytes and directed cord blood products there is no limitation fixed for storage in 78% and 94% of TC, respectively. In cases where the product is disposed of and the patient is still alive, 70% of TC will inform the patient beforehand. Otherwise 88% of products are disposed of when a patient dies with only 43% being used for research purposes. This information is made available to the patient via the information pack and consent forms in 91% of TC. However, in the case of allogeneic products consent for disposal is only requested in 46% of TC. Conclusion: Overall, this survey demonstrated that the majority of responding TC use standard procedures for handling and processing of grafts. Some differences between TC exist, which requires discussion and more in depth analysis in order to improve graft and transplant outcome. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Anal incontinence is a disabling condition that adversely affects the quality of life of a large number of patients, mainly with anal sphincter lesions. In a previous experimental work in vitro expanded bone marrow (BM) derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were demonstrated to enhance sphincter healing after injury and primary repair in a rat preclinical model. Thus, in the present study, we investigated whether bone marrow mononuclear (MNC) unexpanded cells may also be effective. Material (or patients) and methods: 32 Lewis rats, divided in four groups, underwent to sphincterotomy and surgical repair of anal sphincter plus intrasphincteric injection of 1)saline (CTR), 2)in vitro expanded MSC (MSC), 3)minimally manipulated MNC (MNC); moreover, the forth group underwent sham operation. At day 30 histologic and morphometric analysis and in vitro contractility functionality were performed. Results: Treatment with both in vitro expanded MSC and minimally manipulated MNC improved muscle regeneration and increased contractile function of anal sphincters after injury and primary repair compared to CTR. Contractile ability of sphincter smooth muscle of MNC-treated and MSC-treated animals were comparable upon electrical as well as chemical stimulation and both were significantly higher (P o0.05) at day 30 after sphincterotomy than the untreated animals. Histologic analysis showed that in rats treated with BM derived stem cells (MSC or MNC) the injured area appeared almost completely repaired one month after sphincterotomy. Results of morphometric analysis showed that muscle area fraction (MAF) was significantly increased in rats treated with BM MSC or MNC as compared to controls (67.15 \u00b1 9.8; 70.63 \u00b1 11.7 % respectively, vs 26.4.38 \u00b1 6.6%, Po 0.01). No significant difference were observed between the two BM stem cell source used. GFP+ cells (MSC and MNC) remained in the proximity of the lesion site up to 30 days post injection. No co-localization of GFP and smooth muscle cells marker \u03b1SMA has ever been observed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 339, "end": 341, "text": "6,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 342, "end": 343, "text": "7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 355, "end": 357, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 358, "end": 359, "text": "9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 507, "end": 508, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O086"}, {"text": "In the present study we demonstrated in a preclinical model that minimally manipulated BM-MNC were as effective as in vitro expanded MSC for the recovery of anal sphincter injury followed by primary sphincter repair.

Liu 1 1 Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, 2 Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China Introduction: The immune modulatory effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on T cells resulted in an unexpected low incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Our previous studies demonstrated that G-CSF mobilization influenced the distribution and clonality of TRGV and TRDV repertoire (T cell receptors of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells) 1 . Regulatory \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (\u03b3\u03b4 Tregs), which express Foxp3 and primarily belong to CD27 + CD25 high phenotype, are a novel subset of cells with immunosuppressive function 2 . However, whether G-CSF mobilization could influence the expression and immunosuppressive function of \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs remains unknown. Material (or patients) and methods: Peripheral blood \u03b3\u03b4 + T cells were sorted by magnetic activated cell-sorting (MACS) from 10 donors before and after G-CSF mobilization, respectively. MACS-sorted \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were used as effector cells in the carboxylfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) assays and cell immunophenotyping was analyzed by flow cytometry. Autologous CD4 + T cells were purified by MACS, labeled with CFSE, used as responder cells, and finally co-cultured with effector cells. After 5 d incubation, cells were harvested and analyzed for flow cytometry by gating on the CFSE-labeled cells. The percentages of divided responder T cells before and after G-CSF mobilization were compared. Results: Compared with that before mobilization, the proportions of Foxp3 + \u03b3\u03b4 T, Foxp3 + V\u03b41 T and Foxp3 + V\u03b42 T cells were significantly increased in sorted \u03b3\u03b4 T cells after G-CSF mobilization (P = 0.035, P = 0.017 and P = 0.004). The proportions of CD27 + \u03b3\u03b4 T, CD27 + V\u03b41 T and CD27 + V\u03b42 T cells were also significantly increased in sorted \u03b3\u03b4 T cells after G-CSF mobilization (P = 0.035, P = 0.026, P = 0.037). The proportions of CD25 + \u03b3\u03b4 T, CD25 + V\u03b41 T and CD25 + V\u03b42 T cells were similar in sorted \u03b3\u03b4 T cells before and after mobilization (P = 0.252, P = 0.126, P = 0.237). We then compared the inhibitory effect of sorted \u03b3\u03b4 T cells before and after G-CSF mobilization on the proliferation of autologous CD4 + T cells. We found that MACSsorted \u03b3\u03b4 T cells before and after G-CSF mobilization both exerted certain suppression on proliferation, whereas \u03b3\u03b4 T cells after G-CSF mobilization had a more significant suppressive effect on CD4 + T cells than \u03b3\u03b4 T cells before mobilization (P = 0.002). Conclusion: G-CSF mobilization could increase the proportions of regulatory T cells in sorted \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, thus having a higher suppressive effect on CD4 + T cells.

In order to reduce the incidence of GvHD, we used an immunomagnetic depletion method, which selectively removes \u03b1\u03b2 T-cells. B-cells were also depleted to prevent post-transplant EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease. The depleted cell fraction infused to the patients contains, in addition to CD34 HSC, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and NK cells that may contribute to immune reconstitution and to the GvL effect. Using this approach, we have previously reported a robust engraftment and rapid immune reconstitution in children with non-malignant diseases (Bertaina et al., Blood 2014). Here, we describe our three-year experience with 170 procedures assessing depletion efficiency, cell recovery and reliability over time. Material (or patients) and methods: Haploidentical related donors received G-CSF from day -5 to -1 for mobilization prior to leukapheresis (LA). LA (170 procedures from 165 donors) were performed when CD34-cell counts were \u2265 40/\u03bcl. Plerixafor was given to 43 donors (26%) 9 hrs before LA when CD34 count was o 40/\u03bcl the day before LA. LA products containing up to 60 x 10 9 WBC were processed in a closed bag system with a CliniMACS device (Miltenyi, Bergish Gladback, DE) for depletion of \u03b1\u03b2 T-cells using a biotinylated anti-TcR \u03b1\u03b2 Ab followed by an anti-biotin Ab conjugated to paramagnetic beads. Concomitantly, B-cells were also depleted by using anti-CD19 Ab conjugated to paramagnetic beads. The cell products (grafts) were characterized for both residual \u03b1\u03b2 T-cells and B-cells to determine depletion efficiency. The grafts were reinfused within 4hrs after completion of processing in children with both hematological malignant and nonmalignant diseases. Results: The median recovery of CD34 HSC was 98.2% (range 67-115) and the median number of infused CD34 HSC was 18.3 x10 6 /kg (range 6.7-40.5 x 10 6 /kg). The mean depletion of \u03b1\u03b2+ T-cells was 4.18 log +/-0.48 with a median number of transplanted \u03b1\u03b2 T-cells of 0.030 x 10 6 /kg (range 0.001-0.11). The mean depletion of B-cells was 3.5 log +/-0.49 with a median number of transplanted B-cells of 0.035 x 10 6 /kg (range 0.002-0.92). Median yield of NK and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was 90.7% (range 33-111) and 88.3% (range 34-112), respectively. The median number of NK cells infused was 31.4 x 10 6 /kg (range 3.8-179) while that of CD3 T-cells was 10.3 x10 6 /kg, (range 1.3-106), made up mostly by \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells (median number infused 10.1 x10 6 /kg, range 0.9-104). In order to assess the robustness and reliability of the procedure, the same parameters were evaluated at 6-month intervals over a 3year period. Steady performance of the procedure was observed, with minimal fluctuations that did not reach statistical significance and showed no drift during the threeyear follow-up. Conclusion: The procedure for removal of \u03b1\u03b2 T-cells and B-cells is reliable with remarkable degree of depletion attained in all cases. The grafts contained high numbers of CD34 HSC and of immune effector gd T cells and NK cells. Depletion efficiency and cell recovery monitored over time were stable, suggesting that the personnel is properly trained and that different batches of reagents and disposables guarantee consistent performances.

Adult recipients of UCB stem cells that were expanded ex vivo for 3 weeks in the presence of nicotinamide (NiCord) had an earlier median neutrophil recovery compared to historical controls 1 . Therefore, we evaluated whether NiCord provides clinical benefit in the form of reduced risk of infection and decreased hospital length of stay (LOS) through day +100. Material (or patients) and methods: We retrospectively reviewed infection episodes and hospital LOS in 18 adult recipients of NiCord grafts; 10 patients received NiCord with a second unmanipulated unit and 8 patients received NiCord as a single UCB graft. Outcomes were compared to 101 consecutive adult recipients of standard single or double UCB transplantation at Duke University from January 2005 to March 2015. All patients had hematologic malignancy (acute leukemia/MDS 90%, lymphoid 10%) and received a total body irradiation-based myeloablative preparative regimen. Patients were considered at risk of early infection until day +100, relapse, second transplant, death, or last follow-up, whichever came first. Infectious episodes were categorized by type (bacterial, viral, fungal, non-microbiologically defined) and severity (grade 1, 2, 3) 2 . Infection density over time was assessed with Poisson regression. Hospital LOS, defined as \"days alive and out of the hospital in the first 100 days\" to account for early deaths 3 , was assessed with ANCOVA. Results: Overall, median time to neutrophil engraftment in NiCord patients was 12.5 days (95% CI 10-18), significantly shorter than 27 days (95% CI 23-28) in standard UCB patients (log-rank P o.001). All 18 Nicord and 100 of 101 standard UCB patients had at least one infection of any severity. Nine of 18 NiCord and 62 of 101 standard UCB patients had at least one grade 2-3 (moderate to severe) infection (P = .364). Pathogenspecific comparison of grade 2-3 infection in NiCord versus standard UCB recipients showed significantly lower bacterial infection frequency 22% vs. 54% (P = .015), respectively, but no difference in viral (39% vs. 35%, P = .729), fungal (0% vs. 5%, P = 1.0), or non-microbiologically defined (0% vs. 17%, P = .072) infections. Univariate analysis revealed significantly reduced risk ratio for all bacterial infection (0.35, P = .001) and grade 2-3 non-viral infection (0.16, P o.001) in NiCord versus standard UCB patients; this effect was largely unchanged after multivariate adjustment for age, disease stage (early or non-early), and acute grade 3-4 GVHD. NiCord patients had 21.51 (95% CI 8.25, 34.78) more days alive and out of the hospital in the first 100 days than standard UCB patients (P = .002) after adjustment for age, KPS, and acute grade 3-4 GVHD. Conclusion: Transplantation of NiCord was associated with reduced incidence of all bacterial infection and moderate to severe non-viral infection compared to standard UCB transplantation in the first 100 days. NiCord recipients also had significantly decreased hospital length of stay in the first 100 days. Our results confirm that rapid hematopoietic recovery from an ex vivo expanded UCB transplantation approach results in clinical benefit. is the primary therapy for poor prognosis leukemia's, relapsed lymphomas and primary immune deficiency syndromes but 450% of patients develop autoimmune chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) 1 . Unlike acute GVHD, cGVHD remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality 2-4 post BMT. CD4 + T cell subsets are primary mediators of both acute and chronic GVHD with T-bet + Th1, GATA3 + Th2 and RORgt + Th17 cell subsets mediating acute and chronic GVHD 5 .In contrast, CD4 + FoxP3 + regulatory T cell subsets play a prominent role in preventing GVHD 6. However, it remains unclear how specific T-helper subsets contribute to cGVHD and the molecular mechanisms that are involved in inhibiting Treg generation in cGVHD. Material (or patients) and methods: Using a murine model to focus on autoimmune components of GVHD, we evaluated if T helper Type 1 signaling deficient donor Th1 cells inhibit FoxP3-driven regulatory T cell (Treg) peripheral generation in cGVHD. Briefly, irradiated host mice (Balb/c) were reconstituted with fully mismatched T cell depleted bone marrow from C57BL6 mice along with CD4 + T helper cells. This constituted the first phase of aGVHD. At day 21, the alloreactive WT or IFNgR -/or Tbet -/-T cells were isolated and then transferred into B6.Rag2 -/recipients 7 . Results: Murine recipients that received WT T cells developed severe skin and colitic manifestations of cGVHD while the recipients of IFNgR -/-T cells survived, showed no clinical manifestations of cGVHD and had increased Treg cell numbers at day 60 post-transplant. Similarly, adoptive transfer of T-bet deficient T cells resulted in murine recipients developing aGVHD and had similar Treg numbers as compared to WT cohorts (0.40% vs. 0.17%, respectively; P = NS). During cGVHD, murine recipients reconstituted with Tbx21 -/-(Tbet -/-) T cells had a significant survival benefit compared to their WT counterparts and had significantly elevated Treg cell numbers. To evaluate whether peripheral induction contributed to regulatory T cell predominance, we adoptively transferred Tbx21 -/-T cells that consisted of fate mapping for FoxP3: recipients of flow-purified effector cells that were Foxp3and Tbx21 -/had enhanced Treg predominance during autoimmune GVHD, thus directly demonstrating that peripheral Treg induction is controlled by Tbet. Tbx21 -/-T cells also crossregulated autoimmune GVHD mediated by otherwise pathogenic wild-type T cells. Conclusion: The Tbet pathway therefore directly impairs Treg reconstitution and is therefore a feasible target in efforts to prevent autoimmune GVHD. NOTCH signalling plays an essential role in regulating alloimmune T cell responses that mediate graft-versus-hostdisease (GvHD), so in the present study we investigated if Treg can modify NOTCH signalling in conventional T cells (Tcons), thus impacting on GvHD and lethality. Material (or patients) and methods: Tregs were co-cultured with CFSE + Tcons w/o antiCD39 mAB. After 5 days, Tcons were analysed for NOTCH1 expression. Sorted CFSE+Tcons were used for suppression assays and mRNA quantification. BALB/c mice received 5x10 5 donor type (C57BL/6) GFP + Treg on day -2, 5x10 6 T cell depleted bone marrow cells and 1x10 6 Tcon from C57BL/6 mice on day 0. In each experiment a group of mice were treated with the selective CD39 inhibitor polyoxometalate-1 (POM1). Results: NOTCH1 and HES1 mRNA expression were reduced in Tcons when co-cultured with Tregs (to 66.5 \u00b1 20%, and 71 \u00b1 34%, respectively vs Tcons alone). Utilizing flow cytometry, a significant decrease in the NOTCH1 receptor expression (7.7% \u00b1 3.8 vs 2.8 \u00b1 1.6 ;p*** = 0.0009) and in NOTCH1-intracellular domain (NICD) (4% \u00b1 2.37 vs 1.73 \u00b1 1.6 ; p* = 0.015) was observed. Adding the anti-CD39-blocking mAb to Treg/Tcon co-cultures rescued NOTCH1 receptor (2.8% \u00b1 1.6 vs 5.5% \u00b1 2.5; p** = 0.0095) and NICD expression (1.73% \u00b1 1.6 vs 6.2% \u00b1 4.5; p** = 0.0047). Further the addition of CD39 MoAbs resulted in a significantly reduced Treg-suppressive capacity from 56% \u00b1 4.5 to 40.3% \u00b1 2 (p** = 0.0058). When mice received Tregs + Tcons NOTCH1 expression on CD4 + -and CD8 + -H2K b GFPcells from lymph nodes was significantly reduced when compared with Tcons alone (8.8 \u00b1 1.6% vs 3 \u00b1 1.5% *Po 0.05 and 19 \u00b1 2.8% vs 6.6 \u00b1 2.8% *P o 0.05). The addition of POM1, which inhibits CD39, resulted in restoration of NOTCH1 expression to 13.7 \u00b1 0.9% **P o 0.001 on CD4 + -H2K b GFPcells and 21.9 \u00b1 2.6% on CD8 + -H2K b GFPcells*Po 0.05, approaching the same level observed on the mice that received Tcons alone. As expected mice that received Tregs + Tcons had improved survival in comparison with mice that received Tcons alone (*Po 0.05). Animals treated with Tregs +Tcons had reduced incidence of GvHD (**Po 0.01) and mice had improved weight gain (**Po 0.01). In mice that received Tregs and Tcons and POM1, survival was reduced (*P o 0.05), with an increase in the incidence of GvHD (**P o 0.01) and the mice did not regain weight (**Po 0.01 vs Group 4) Conclusion: The present paper describes for the first time a Treg-induced NOTCH1 blockade. Tregs trigger and orchestrate NOTCH downregulation directly in Tcons. They act through the CD39/adenosine axis to inhibit the NOTCH pathway which, in turn, regulates Tcon proliferation. NOTCH1 inhibition on Tcons could explain clinical and experimental evidences from our group showing that Tregs prevent GvHD and allow for a powerful Tcon-dependent GvL. Consequently Treg-mediated NOTCH inhibition may represent a new mechanism to separate GvHD from GvL. This finding has major implications for adoptive immunotherapy strategies in the field of transplantation for leukaemia. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: The interaction of microbial products and their sensing receptors is known to be involved in antigen presentation. In preclinical models, we have demonstrated that signaling through the pathogen recognition receptor NOD2 regulates GVHD by its influence on antigen presentation and allo-activation of donor T-cells. Material (or patients) and methods: We used NOD2-/-C57B6 mice, Ctse-/-C57B6 and wild type (WT) C57B6 as donors or recipients in preclinical GVHD models (LP/J in C57B6; C57B6 in B6D2F1, C57B6 in Balb/c). Results: To identify pathways that are related to NOD2 signaling during GVHD we performed gene array analyses in NOD2-/-allo-BMT recipients vs. WT allo-BMT recipients. Most striking was a 13fold expression difference of Cathepsin E (ctse) between NOD2-/-allo BMT recipients vs. WT allo-BMT recipients during hepatic GVHD. Cathepsin E (ctse) is an aspartate protease expressed in dendritic cells and macrophages which regulates cleaving of bacterial peptides for antigen presentation by the MHC II complex. Recent data in Ctse-/-mice demonstrated reduced inflammation in allergic disease models. Using ctse-/-T-cells and ctse-/-donor bone marrow (BM) cells vs WT donor cells, we detected no major impact of ctse donor deficiency on GVHD and engraftment. In contrast, ctse-/-allo-BMT recipients had significantly reduced GVHD-related mortality and significantly lower clinical GVHD scores as compared to WT allo-BMT recipients (Fig.1) . Our results demonstrate that T-cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro is significantly decreased in ctse-deficient allo-BMT recipients during GVHD. Accordingly, ctse-deficient APCs had a lower ability to induce allo-activation of WT T-cells. Conclusion: We conclude that ctse is a relevant factor during GVHD. Therapeutic targeting of aspartate proteases is feasible and may be a future option to inhibit inflammation. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD), represents the major cause of mortality and morbidity after Hematopoietic Stem Cells Transplantation. Chemerin has been recently identified as a chemotactic protein, which is produced by several tissues during inflammation and binds the G proteincoupled receptor ChemR23, expressed by DCs, macrophages and NK cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential role of Chemerin/ChemR23 axis in the pathogenesis of GvHD, in order to identify disease-specific pathways exploitable for developing new potential therapeutic targets. Material (or patients) and methods: Lethally irradiated Balb/ C recipient mice were transplanted with bone marrow cells and splenocytes obtained from ChemR23-deficient C57BL6 mice (tChemR23 -/-). After transplantation, mice were monitored daily for survival and GvHD severity. Recipient mice were sacrificed at different time points to evaluate Chemerin production and leukocytes infiltration in GvHD target organs by using different techniques, such as ELISA, histopathology, FACS and PCR. Results: Starting from day +6 after transplantation, Chemerin plasma levels appeared significantly higher in both wild type (WT) and tChemR23 -/mice who developed GvHD, compared to syngeneic controls. Interestingly, tChemR23 -/mice developed a more severe GvHD compared to mice transplanted with WT cells. In particular, tChemR23 -/mice showed a higher mortality rate. Differences in GvHD score between ChemR23 -/and WT transplanted mice resulted by a significantly increase in weight loss, associated to severe diarrhea. In accordance, histological analysis performed on GvHD target organs showed a significantly higher GvHD score in large intestine of tChemR23 -/mice, whereas no differences were found in other GvHD organs. In addition, a deeper histological analysis on large intestine showed that tissue damage is characterized by crypt hyperplasia and atrophy, epithelium apoptosis and colitis. FACS analysis of large intestine infiltrating leukocytes showed that the percentage of neutrophils infiltrating colon were significantly higher in tChemR23 -/mice compared to WT transplanted mice. The higher neutrophils infiltration was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry evaluating the number of myeloperoxidase (MPO) positive cells and MPO expression by RQ-PCR. Interestingly, the analysis of ChemR23 + cell subsets revealed that macrophages infiltrating colon mucosa were significantly lower in tChemR23 -/mice compared to WT, while no differences were observed in DCs or NK cells. All these [0093] observations were also obtained by analyzing the mesenteric lymphnode. By adoptively transferring 0.2x10 6 WT-monocytes into tChemR23 -/mice, we demonstrated that WT-monocytes were able to improve GvHD in terms of survival, weight loss and overall score, thus confirming that lacking of ChemR23 expression on macrophages induces an increase of GvHD damage. Conclusion: All these findings suggest that the Chemerin/ ChemR23 axis plays a crucial role in intestinal GVHD, driving macrophages infiltration in colon mucosa. Further studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying the severe damage observed in the gastrointestinal tract of tChemR23 -/mice. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Polyclonal anti-human T-lymphocyte immunoglobulin (ATG) have been recently shown, in two randomized studies, to significantly reduce the incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) post allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from both sibling and unrelated donors. Induction of regulatory T cells is suggested as one of the possible mechanisms involved. Material (or patients) and methods: The aim of our current study was to further characterize the T cell populations induced by ATG treatment and to delineate the mechanisms involved in ATG-induced tolerance in patients receiving intravenous ATG (Neovii Biotech) as part of their pre HSCT conditioning. Results: Ex vivo treatment with ATG (30-120 \u03bcg/ml) resulted in significant increase in regulatory markers CD25, CTLA-4, GITR, CD95, ICOS, PD-1 and FoxP3 expression on CD4+ T cells. In addition, expression of CD127 and VLA-4 was significantly decreased on CD4+CD25+ cells upon ATG treatment (P o0.01). Addition of ATG-treated cells to autologous PBMCs stimulated with antiCD3/antiCD28 antibodies resulted in significant inhibition of cell proliferation, CD69 expression and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) secretion (Po 0.001). Importantly, addition of cyclosporine A to the induction culture with ATG interfered with the ATG-induced regulatory phenotype acquisition, suggesting the involvement of interleukin-2 in ATG-mediated activity. In order to purify the tolerizing population, sorting of CD4 +CD25+CD127-low cells (considered as viable Treg cells) from ATG-treated culture was performed. Sorted cells demonstrated greater suppressive potency than bulked pre-sorted cell population. To explore the possible involvement of soluble factor(s)mediated mechanisms, conditioned medium (CM) produced by ATG-primed cells was applied on stimulated autologous PBMCs. It resulted in significant suppression (Po 0.01) of T cell proliferation and activation, indicating the presence of soluble factors secreted by ATG-primed suppressive cells. Indeed, significant dose-and time-dependent induction of TGF\u03b2 secretion was observed in ATG-treated cells. Addition of TGF\u03b2 receptor kinase inhibitor SB-431542 interfered with", "cite_spans": [{"start": 16974, "end": 16980, "text": "[0093]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 13930, "end": 13937, "text": "(Fig.1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF29"}], "section": "Onco-hematology, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy"}, {"text": "S55 suppressive activity of ATG-primed cells, enabling partial rescue of proliferation and IFN\u03b3 secretion in response to TCR activation. Finally, characterization of phenotype and frequencies of regulatory immune populations in peripheral blood of 26 patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation with conditioning regimen including ATG (15mg/kg) was performed. Consistent with our ex vivo results, transient increase in percent of circulating CD4+CD25+CD127-low cells was detected in the ATG treated patients on day 21 after HSCT. Furthermore, elevated levels of TGF\u03b2 were detected in the patients' plasma at day 28 and remaining high at day 60 post HSCT. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that in vitro treatment with ATG is capable to induce functional Treg cells. Suppressive ability of ATG-induced cells was partially promoted by TGF\u03b2 signaling. Patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT with ATG-including conditioning demonstrated increased frequencies of circulating Treg cells and elevated plasma levels of TGF\u03b2. Altogether, our data further support the use of ATG, a potent inducer of regulatory T cells, for prevention of GVHD post HSCT and potentially other therapeutic applications. Introduction: Prognosis of patients (pts) failing multiple chemotherapy (CT) regimens is quite dismal. CD30 is expressed and prognostic in embryonal carcinoma, hence it is a rational target for treatment. Brentuximab Vedotin (BV) is an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of the chimeric anti-CD30 antibody SGN-30 conjugated to an antitubulin synthetic analog (MMAE). A phase 2 trial is ongoing in GCT (NCT01851200). Material (or patients) and methods: 24 pts with biopsyproven CD30+ GCT will receive BV 1.8 mg/Kg IV q3 weeks until disease progression or onset of unacceptable toxicity. Eligibility will include failure of 2 or 3 platinum-based CT (including HDCT). All pts will undergo measurement of serum tumor markers (STM), a computed tomography and a PET scan q6 weeks. An optimal Simon's 2-stage design will be applied. The primary endpoint is the objective response-rate (ORR; H0: \u2264 5%, H1: \u2265 25%, \u03b1 and \u03b2 = 10%). In stage 1, 9 evaluable patients will be accrued. Sequential peripheral blood samples are being collected for immune profiling by flow cytometry of immune cell subsets. Results: From 07/13 to 04/15, 9 pts have been treated, 3 in third-line, and 6 beyond the third-line. 5 had received HDCT. STM decline was obtained in 7 pts (77.8%) after the first dose and in 4 pts (44.4%) after 2 doses (with normalized [1] or still positive [3] STM). ORR was 22.2% (1 CR+1 PR) according to RECIST v1.1, and there were 3 metabolic PR. 3-month PFS was 11.1% (95%CI: 0.6-38.8), 6-month OS was 85.7% (95%CI: 33.4-97.9). 1 case of reversible G3 hyperglycemia was recorded. No BV discontinuation for toxicity occurred. In 7 evaluable pts, a trend to increasing expression of activation (HLA-DR), proliferation (Ki67), and functional differentiation (Granzyme B) markers in CD4 and CD8 T cells was observed during BV. In CR patient, an increased frequency of naive and central memory T cells was observed after the first cycle of BV, as well as a reduction in the fraction of PD1 + /CD8 + T cells. Conclusion: Brentuximab is endowed with potent antitumor activity and meaningful immunomodulatory effects in GCT. The rapid development of resistance is a concern. ORR is pending confirmation in the whole sample size. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Material (or patients) and methods: Participating teams were requested to report their data for 2013 by indication, donor type, cell source, processing method and delivery mode using a survey which followed the traditional principles of the EBMT transplant activity survey and concentrates on numbers of patients with a first cellular therapy. 687 teams known to be actively transplanting in 48 countries were contacted for the 2013 EBMT survey, to which were added members of the other participating societies and teams who had contributed to any earlier survey. Results: 318 teams from 31 countries responded to the cellular and engineered tissue therapy survey; 145 teams from 25 countries reported treating 2187 patients, while a further 173 teams reported no activity. Data on 6 patients were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 2181 patients, 629 (30%) were treated with allogeneic and 1552 (71%) with autologous cells. Indications were musculoskeletal/rheumatological disorders (45%; 89% autologous), cardiovascular disorders (20%; 99% autologous), hematology/oncology, predominantly prevention or treatment of GvHD and HSC graft enhancement, (19%; o1% autologous), neurological disorders (3%; 100% autologous), gastrointestinal disorders (2%; 32% autologous) and other indications (11%; 67% autologous). The majority of autologous cells (88%) were used to treat musculoskeletal/rheumatological (57%) and cardiovascular (27%) disorders, whereas allogeneic cells were used mainly for hematology/oncology (64%). Cartilage and bone repair were by far the most frequently reported indications amongst the musculoskeletal/rheumatological disorders, comprising almost half of all treatments in this group, followed by reconstructive surgery/tissue enhancement (21% of treatments). Treatments for decubitus and leg ulcers were the main reasons for a cellular or engineered tissue therapy amongst the cardiovascular disorders, closely followed by peripheral artery disease, together accounting for 62% of treatments in this group of indications. The number of patients treated for neurological and gastrointestinal indications was small; Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The cell types were mesenchymal stem/ stromal cells (49%), hematopoietic stem cells (28%), chondrocytes (11%), dendritic cells (2%), keratinocytes (1%) and others (9%). Conclusion: The data collected in this survey show a modest increase in both the number of reporting teams and number of patients treated from the previous year (143 in 2008 and 318 in 2013) , with data reported from 33 in 2008 to 142 in 2013. The number of patients treated has risen from 1040 in 2008 to 2187 in 2013. When comparing the results for specific indications with previous years we found few significant differences. The international nature of the involved societies suggests for widening the data collection to other world regions, with global repository of data. A larger collective effort will be necessary in order to show that cell-based and tissue engineered therapies are, despite the challenges to be overcome, global opportunities to counteract still lethal diseases and unmet clinical needs. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. S57 surgery and neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, remain ineffective. One of the main NK cell activating receptors is NK cell group 2D (NKG2D). NKG2D receptor recognizes human MICA/ULBP1-6 ligands. These NKG2D ligands are expressed in osteosarcoma cells and constitute suitable targets for immunotherapy. Material (or patients) and methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were labeled with CD45RA microbeads and depleted using CliniMACS device. The HL20i4r-MNDantiCD19bbz lentiviral vector were derived from the clinical vector CL20i4r-EF1a-hgcOPT27 but contained the extracellular domain of NKG2D, the hinge region of CD8a and the signaling domains of 4-1BB and CD3-z. The cassette was driven by MND promoter. Viral supernatant was produced by transient transfection of HEK293T cells with the vector genome plasmid and lentiviral packaging helper plasmids pCAGG-HIVgpco, pCAGG-VSVG and pCAG4-RTR2.The in vitro cytotoxicity of 45RA-T cells against 531MII cells was evaluated by performing conventional 4-hour europium-TDA release assays. For the in vivo orthotopic model, 531MII YFP-luc cells were used as target in NOD/scid IL2rgnull mice. Results: Lentiviral transduction of NKG2D-4-1BB-CD3z markedly increased NKG2D surface expression in CD45RA-cells, which became consistently more cytotoxic than untransduced cells against osteosarcoma cell lines. NKG2D-4-1BB-CD3z expressing T cells had considerable antitumor activity in a mouse model of osteosarcoma, whereas untransduced T cells were ineffective. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate NKG2D-4-1BB-CD3z CAR redirected 45RA negative T cells target NKG2DL expressing osteosarcoma cells both in vivo and in vitro and could be a promising immunotherapeutic approach for osteosarcoma patients. Although aggressive local control combination with systemic therapy allows achieving good results in localized cases, prognosis in patients with primary disseminated disease or large inoperable tumor is still dismal. There is currently no agreement on the role or indications for high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) with auto-HSCT in ESFT patients due to the lack of randomized trials data. Allo-HSCT is considered an experimental option, as there is only scarce data on graftversus-ESFT effect. There is also no common agreement on risk stratification. Material (or patients) and methods: A total of 69 high-risk patients with ESFT, median age of 14 (2-37 years) , received treatment in 2008-2015. All patients had high-risk disease: primary disseminated tumor (n = 30), large inoperable primary tumor (n = 26), chemosensitive relapse (n = 13). Additional risk stratification was based on score system proposed by Ladenstein R et al for primary-disseminated ESFT. Most patients received HDCT with auto-HSCT (n = 56) or allo-HSCT (n = 6), from haploidentical (n = 3) or matched unrelated (n = 3) donors, in 8 patients maintenance therapy was performed. At the time of transplant, 26 (38%) of patients were in CR, 26 (38%) had PR and 4 (14%) had SD. The median follow-up is currently 36 (range 8-99) months. All allo-HSCT recipients received fludarabine-based non-myeloablative conditioning regimens. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of calcineurin inhibitors, MMF and ATG. Results: All maintenance therapy recipients relapsed, 2 of them were salvaged with 2 nd -line therapy and high-dose consolidation. The results in auto-HSCT group are better (P = 0.08) with 5-year OS and DFS of 52% and 42%, accordingly. The most important risk factors were number of bone metastases (P o0.01), lungs (P = 0.02) or bone marrow (P = 0.01) involvement, and induction therapy response (P o0.01). Multifactor analysis by Cox regression method revealed additional risk factors: initial tumor volume (HR 3.9, P = 0.04) and radiation therapy dose (HR 2.9, P = 0.03). Therefore, the score system proposed by Ladenstein et al allows an adequate risk stratification (Po 0.01). Although all allo-HSCT recipients died from therapy-related complications (n = 2) or disease progression (n = 4), in 5 cases a good response was observed with median time to progression of 6.5 months. Conclusion: Although this trial was not designed to compare high-dose consolidation with maintenance therapy, there is some indirect evidence in favor of intensive approach. The risk stratification score system could possibly be used to determine indications for high-dose consolidation, although further study is needed. Allo-HSCT has very limited effect as salvage therapy, while due to some evidence of graft-vs-ESFT effect, it may still be effective in some limited patients populations. Introduction: Adoptive transfer of T cells genetically engineered to express CAR has shown to have therapeutic success in the treatment of B-cell malignancies and solid tumors. Persistence of GD2-specific CAR (GD2-CAR) in patients with relapsed NB was directly associated to a better outcome in the treated patients 1 . However, only a negligible number of NB patients showed a persistence of CAR T cells until 6 weeks after T cell infusion. Recently, it was reported that second generation CAR incorporating 4-1BB costimulation prevents in vivo T cell exhaustion 2 . Thus, we test the anti-tumor activity of polyclonal T cells genetically modified with third generation GD2-CAR incorporating the costimulatory molecules CD28 and 4.1BB, in frame with a safety switch, i.e. inducible Caspase 9 (iC9). Material (or patients) and methods: ScFv specific for GD2 was cloned in frame with CD28, 4.1bb and CD3-\u03b6 (CAR.GD2). Moreover, we added in frame through the 2A sequence the suicide gene iC9. Then, activated T cells were retrovirally transduced and analyzed 5 days after transduction by FACS, using an anti-idiotype antibody. Cr 51 assays and in vitro cocultures were carried out to evaluate CAR-T cell anti-tumor effect vs GD2+ NB cells. iC9 activation was evaluated by AnnexinV/7AAD staining after exposure to AP1903. To assess the expansion, persistence, and antitumor effect of transgenic CAR.GD2 T cells in vivo, we used a NSG mouse model engrafted with luciferase-positive GD2+ human NB cell lines. Results: Flow cytometric analysis of CTLs stained with anti-14. G2a idiotype specific antibody identified chimeric receptors on 40% to 85% of the CTLs (mean, 63%). Chimeric receptor expression was maintained over the entire period of culture (up to 45 days) without any apparent down-regulation. We observed 65% \u00b1 31% of specific cytotoxic activity of CAR.GD2 T cells toward GD2+ NB SH-SY-5Y cells (effector/target ratio 40:1), but not against derived GD2-SH-SY-5Y clone (15 \u00b1 5%). Moreover, 5 day co-culture of CAR.GD2 T cells with GD2+ NB SH-SY-5Y cells (ratio 1:1) showed 1.3 \u00b1 2% of residual tumor cells, whereas 35 \u00b1 18% of GD2-NB cells survived in culture with transduced T cells. Addition of AP1903, the dimerizing agent activating iC9, eliminated CAR.GD2 T-cell activity and induced apoptosis in more than 90% of the transduced cells. The tumor bioluminescence of mice engrafted i.p. with SH-SY-5Y cells rapidly increased in recipients of control NT T-cells (rising from 4.6 \u00d7 108 \u00b1 3.99 \u00d7 108 to 4.3 \u00d7 1010 \u00b1 8.7 \u00d7 109 by day 60), while CAR.GD2 T cells significantly controlled tumor expansion so that signal rose from 1.6 \u00d7 108 \u00b1 9 \u00d7 107 to only 2.01 \u00d7 108 \u00b1 3 \u00d7 108 by day 38 (P o0.0001). Introduction: Here, we aimed to examine the effect of post-complete remission (CR; CRp [CR with platelet count o100,000/mcl] or CRi [CR with absolute neutrophil count o1,000/mcl] consolidation treatments on the probability of receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), on having minimal residual disease (MRD) before HCT, and on transplant outcomes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Material (or patients) and methods: We examined 383 patients with newly diagnosed AML who were consecutively treated at Seattle cancer care alliance/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center from our database from January 1, 2008 , to December 31, 2014 . We excluded patients who did not achieve CR, have favourable risk, aged 470 years, were lost follow-up, or decided not to receive HCT. Results: A total of 215 newly diagnosed AML patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were examined. Patients who received \u2265 1 consolidation treatment and with poor performance status (ECOG42) were likely to have a delayed time to transplant. Patients who achieved Cri/CRp with or without MRD at time of the initial response had a delayed time to planned HCT, in comparison to patients with CR. Only 5 of 24 patients (20%) who had CR-MRD after induction and received HCT eventually achieved CR at time of transplant (1 with 1 course, 2 with 2 courses, 2 with \u2265 3 courses of consolidation therapy). CR-MRD persisted in 19 patients (80%), and progression was noted in 1 patient. The administration of 41 consolidation treatment did not reduce the pre-HCT relapse rate compared to no consolidation treatment. Introduction: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with 17p abnormalities (abn(17p)), usually affecting TP53 locus, carries a very poor prognosis due to high refractoriness to conventional chemotherapy, with long-term survival of less than 5%. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) appears as the only potential curative option in high-risk AML. To specifically address outcomes after SCT in patients with abn(17), we retrospectively analysed data from the EBMT registry. Material (or patients) and methods: De novo or secondary AML with abnormal karyotype transplanted between 2000 and 2013 have been allocated. From a dataset of 5495 patients with AML undergoing SCT, we included only those patients for whom data were sufficient to confirm the presence of abn (17p) resulting in a loss or a disruption of the TP53 locus. Results: One hundred thirty-nine patients have been selected including 125 patients (90%) in first remission (CR1) and 14 (10%) in second remission. For further analysis, we focused on the 125 patients in CR1. Median age was 54 (range, 18-69) year-old and the median follow-up was 21 (range, months. Eighty-five percent of the patients had a de novo AML, while 15% had a secondary AML. Abn(17p) was associated to a monosomal karyotype in 83% of patients, complex karyotype in 91%, monosomy 5 or 5q deletion (-5/5q-) in 55%, monosmy 7 (-7) in 39% and both -5/5q and -7 in 27%, respectively. Median time from diagnosis to CR1 was 57 (range, 18-170) days. Fifty-one (41%) of the patients received a myeloablative conditioning regimen and 73 (59%) had a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen. The vast majority of patients (70%) had a karnofsky performance status of more than 90% at the time of SCT. The 2-year overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) were 28% and 24%, respectively. The 2-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 15%, and 2-yr relapse incidence (RI) was 61%. The cumulative incidence of grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) was 24% and that of chronic GvHD was 21%. In multivariate analysis, the presence of a -5/5q-in addition to abn(17p) was significantly and independently associated with worse OS, LFS and higher RI. Age and donor type did not correlate with outcome. Conditioning intensity was not statistically associated with OS, LFS and NRM when adjusted for patients' age. Conclusion: In contrast to the dismal prognosis reported for AML patients harboring abn(17p) undergoing conventional chemotherapy, allogeneic SCT provides long-term responses in about 25% of a selected group of patients harboring this cytogenetic abnormality at diagnosis and transplanted in CR1. Post and pre transplant adapted therapy may further improve results. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. (median 21.9; range: 0.4-45,358) . MPFC MRD was +ve in 57/100 (57%) patients after induction and in 34/78 (43.6%) after consolidation. 126/151 patients achieved CR, 54 relapsed at a median of 8 months (1-52 months) with 52.2% 5 yr CIR, and 30% 1 yr CIR (N: 39). Patients who underwent chemotherapy (82), Autologous (17) and Allogeneic Transplant (76) Introduction: To analyze the prognostic impact of distinct combinations of molecular aberrations on outcome after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a retrospective analysis on 204 adults undergoing related (61) and unrelated (143) alloSCT was performed. Material (or patients) and methods: The mean patient's age was 51 (16-75) years. One hundred fifteen patients (57%) were treated with reduced intensity conditioning. Eighty percent of patients were transplanted in CR (1st or 2nd) and in 20% of patients, alloSCT were performed in relapse of disease. Patients were grouped according to presence of NPM1, FLT3-ITD, FLT3-D835, DNMT3A, IDH1, and IDH2 mutations. The influence of aberrant genotypes on relapse, leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) after alloSCT were analyzed. Results: The presence of NPM1 mutations were associated with low relapse rate (P = .02) and significant better LFS, particularly in cases of single mutation. From 52 NPM1 mut patients, 30 patients with additional FLT3 mutations was characterized by the inferior LFS as compared with others combination of mutations (P = .05). Among 52 FLT wt patients, the favorable LFS was seen in patients with NPM1 mutation and poor outcome was estimated in those with DNMT3A mutation (P = .03). IDH1 und IDH2 mutations less than others were associated with FLT3 mutations in our cohort of AML patients. In this group, the lower relapse rate after alloSCT was found (P = .0001). The most of DNMT3A mut patients were associated with FLT3 and NPM1 mutations (63%). Patients with DNMT3A mut /FLT3 mut /NPM1 wt have demonstrated more inferior LFS than DNMT3A mut /FLT3 wt /NPM1 mut . Among 64 patients with single mutations, the favorable outcome after alloSCT were found in NPM1 mut group and the poor LFS and OS after alloSCT were seen in FLT3 mut and DNMT3A mut patients (P = .01). Conclusion: These results suggest that DNMT3A mut , particularly when accompanied by FLT3-ITD mut , is a significant prognostic factor for inferior survival outcome, even after alloSCT.

Material (or patients) and methods: A phase II clinical trial of high-dose immunosuppressive therapy (HDIT; BCNU, etoposide, ara-C, melphalan and antithymocyte globulin) and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) was conducted in patients with highly active RRMS who had failed conventional therapy to assess the rate of sustained remission. Eligibility required an EDSS of 3.0 (moderate disability, fully ambulatory) to 5.5 (severe disability, ambulatory only 100 meters without aids) and Z2 relapses on therapy in previous 18 months. A primary endpoint event or treatment-failure was defined as death or evidence of MS disease activity including any of: 1) relapse 2) new MRI lesions or 3) disability increase 40.5 EDSS points during 5 years post-transplant. Adverse events (AE) were recorded according to NCI-CTCAE v3.0. In addition, the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), a patient-based quality of life measure, and the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC), a three-part standardized assessment instrument, were used to assess MS disease activity. Results: 25 patients with median age 37(26-52) years were treated with G-CSF and prednisone to mobilize the autograft. The autograft was CD34-selected (Baxter, Isolex). 24 patients received HDIT/HCT according to protocol. Median follow-up was 62 months (min 12, max 72). In the first 3 years after HDIT, there were 121 grade 3 and 93 grade 4 AE, mostly hematological and gastrointestinal. Between 3 and 5 years after transplant, there were 15 grade 3 and 0 grade 4 AE. 3 deaths occurred on the study, all after subjects had met another MS disease activity or disability component of the composite endpoint. One patient experienced progressive loss of neurological function and death at 32 months. Also, two patients died 4 3 years post-transplant. None of the deaths were related to study treatment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2520, "end": 2523, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2542, "end": 2545, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5996, "end": 6025, "text": "(143 in 2008 and 318 in 2013)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9097, "end": 9109, "text": "(2-37 years)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 14612, "end": 14627, "text": "January 1, 2008", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 14628, "end": 14650, "text": ", to December 31, 2014", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 16655, "end": 16669, "text": "(range, 18-69)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 18356, "end": 18388, "text": "(median 21.9; range: 0.4-45,358)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Onco-hematology, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy"}, {"text": "At 5 years, the probability of event-free survival according to the primary endpoint was 69.2% (90% CI: 50.2%482.1%); progression-free and relapse-free survival were 90.9% (90% CI: 73.7%497.1%) and 86.3% (90% CI: 68.7%494.5%), respectively, and probability of freedom from disease activity detected by brain MRI was 88.2% (90% CI: 67%496.2%). As reported in our interim analysis of three-year outcomes [1] , in which 7 out of 24 patients who received HCT met primary endpoint, no further events occurred by the close of 5 years. Further, MS disease burden as measured by T2 weighted lesion volume on MRI was significantly reduced by 6 months as compared to baseline and was sustained for 5 years (median change: -1.208 ml; Po 0.001). T1 lesion volume was increased at 5 years (median change: 0.094 ml; P = 0.041). While both the MSIS-29 and the MSFC showed improvement at Year 5 with median difference from baseline of -8.5 (P = 0.091) and 0.11 (P = 0.303), respectively, changes were not statistically significant. Conclusion: HDIT/HCT for highly active RRMS induced a high rate of remission of MS disease activity which was sustained at 5 years, without maintenance therapy. Most treatment-related AE were as expected, consistent with the transplant regimen. Introduction: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by skin thickening and visceral involvement, leading to impairment of physical function, daily life activities and quality of life. Severe cases usually have poor prognosis, despite conventional immunosuppressive treatment. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) has been investigated as treatment for patients with severe SSc, improving skin and at least stabilizing lung involvement. There are no reports in the literature that address the influence of AHSCT on the functional capacity of SSc patients. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of AHSCT on skin involvement, functional capacity and quality of life (QoL) of SSc patients, and to compare these results with those from SSc patients under conventional immunosuppressive treatment. Material (or patients) and methods: In this prospective, longitudinal study, SSc patients treated with AHSCT (transplant group) and patients under conventional immunosuppressive treatment (control group) were evaluated before, and six months after treatment. The evaluations included respiratory muscle strength test (maximal inspiratory pressure -MIP and maximal expiratory pressure -MEP), hand function assessments (hand-grip strength, finger-to-palm distance -FTP, COCHIN questionnaire), six-minute walk test (6MWT), modified Rodnan's skin score (mRSS) and quality of life questionnaire . Results underwent statistical analyses and significance levels were established at Po 0.05. Introduction: Autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (auto-HCT) for multiple sclerosis (MS) has been performed worldwide since the late 1990s, however, it is still not regarded as standard treatment. We present the results of patients treated in Singapore since 2002 on a Flu/Cy conditioning regimen that is to our knowledge, unique to our centers in its application to MS. Material (or patients) and methods: Eligible patients had either relapsing remitting (RR) or secondary progressive (SP) MS and failed at least 1 previous disease-modifying drug (DMD); failure was defined as at least 1 flare in the preceding 12 months while on treatment in RRMS patients, or ongoing neurological decline in SPMS. Mobilization was with IV cyclophosphamide 2g/m 2 and filgrastim. PBSC were enriched for CD34 by use of the CliniMacs CD34 system (Miltenyi Biotec) before cryopreservation. The conditioning regimen consisted of IV fludarabine 30mg/m 2 from d5-to d-3 and IV cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg from d-5 to d-2. Neurological progress was assessed by a neurologist using the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Results: Between 2002 and 2015, 31 patients underwent transplant; 2 patients were subsequently diagnosed with neuromyelitis optica and excluded from this study. 25 patients (8 male: 17 female) with at least 3 months follow up were considered for this analysis. 19 patients had RRMS and 8 had SPMS. The median age at transplant was 37.4y (range 20.8y to 56.3y). Neutrophil engaftment (defined as the first day after transplant that absolute neutrophil count exceeded 500/uL) occurred at a median of 10 days (range 8-11d); time to platelet count 450/uL was 14d (range 10-17). At a median follow up of 12.5m (range 3m to 157m), the event-free survival was 84%. Eight patients experienced febrile neutropenia that responded to antibiotics, with only 1 case of grade 5 severity (described below). Four deaths occurred, of which 3, all with SPMS and baseline EDSS \u2265 7.5, were related to MS progression and death from infection 6 or more months after HCT. One patient, with RRMS, died following severe pseudomonas sepsis and engraftment respiratory syndrome occurring during transplant, eventually succumbing at 3m post-transplant from pneumonia. Serial EDSS is shown in Figure 1 Introduction: Our previous research has provided the evidence that an autoreactive immune system can be \"reset\" into a healthy, tolerant state by immunoablative treatment to eradicate pathogenic effector cells, followed by transplantation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HSCT). Here, we investigated the T cell reconstitution in 10 patients with refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) for up to 15 years after receiving immunoablation and ASCT. Material (or patients) and methods: Since 1998, 10 patients with refractory SLE received a CD34 + -selected autologous stem cell transplantation after immunoablation with ATG and cyclophosphamide as part of a prospective monocentric phase I/II clinical trial. Their peripheral blood lymphocytes were investigated using multiparametric flow cytometry, including analysis of the TCR-Vbeta repertoire on CD4 + lymphocytes. Thymic activity was determined measuring absolute counts of peripheral blood CD31 + thymic naive Th cells. In addition, Tregs where analyzed for their expression of Helios, CD45RA and CD31. Healthy donors and patients after thymectomy for myasthenia gravis served as controls. Results: In the first 6 months post-Tx most CD4 + T cells presented a CD45RO + memory-like phenotype and TCR analysis revealed a highly restricted TCR Vbeta usage resulting from peripheral expansion. Subsequently, an increase in [0108] absolute numbers of CD31 + thymic na\u00efve CD4 + T cells occurred 6-12 months post-Tx and persisted in significantly higher numbers compared to age-matched controls. Expression levels for Heliosa marker for natural Tregsin recurring Tregs post-Tx was similar in SLE compared to healthy controls and thymectomized patients (~70%), but their coexpression levels for CD45RA and CD31 was significantly higher (26.4% vs. 20.6% vs. 7.1%). While expanded naturally occurring Helios + Tregs in active SLE patients under conventional treatment showed a skewed TCR repertoire, the TCR repertoire of Tregs in responding patients after ASCT was diverse. Conclusion: Our data show that immune reconstitution after ASCT is associated with a profound reconfiguration of the adaptive immune system, i.e. immune reset, characterized by stable thymic reactivation with recurrence and persistence of thymic na\u00efve conventional and regulatory T cells. Thymic output generates a pool of new and diverse CD4 + T cells. Although Helios is regarded as a marker for naturally occurring Tregs, coexpression levels for CD31 and CD45RA better correlates with thymic output conditions for Tregs.

Introduction: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been utilized to treat graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and some autoimmune diseases due to their extensive immunomodulatory activities. However, the immunogenicity of MSCs weakens their immunomodulatory effect especially in inflammatory microenvironment, which could enhance the immunogenicity. Here we address the role of TSC-mTOR signaling pathway on regulation the immunogenicity of MSCs. Material (or patients) and methods: Bone marrow MSCs were isolated from healthy donors. The immunomodulatory function of MSCs was determined by inhibiting the proliferation of T cells. After pretreatment with various concentration of rapamycin, HLA-ABC + , HLA-DR + cell proportion and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in normal culture or treated with IFN-\u03b3 were evaluated by flow cytometry. We used lentivirusmediated shRNA interference to assess the role of TSC2 in regulation the immunogenicity of MSCs. Western blotting was used for evaluating the mTOR signaling activities and phosphorylation of Stat1. The mRNA expression of IRF1, CIITA, proteasome subunits and MHC-I assembly related molecular chaperones were detected by real time PCR. Results: We first found that mTOR inhibition by pretreatment with rapamycin significantly enhanced the immunosuppressive function of MSCs ( Figure 1A, B) . To investigate whether mTOR inhibiton influence the immunogenicity of MSCs, HLA molecules were detected after treating with rapamycin. In normal culture, mTOR inhibition has no effect on the expression of HLA-ABC. The MFI of HLA-ABC was elevated by treating with IFN-\u03b3 for 3 days. Proteasome subunits LMP2, LMP7, LMP10 and molecular chaperones, including Tapasin, were also upregulated. Rapamycin has no effect on the expression of HLA-ABC in culture treated with IFN-\u03b3 as well. MSCs were negative for HLA-DR, and its expression was significantly elevated by IFN-\u03b3. The phosphorylation of Stat1 and expression of IRF1, CIITA were also upregulated. IFN-\u03b3 induced HLA-DR expression was not involved with mTOR signaling as indicated by no difference in mTOR substrate activities. However, mTOR inhibition significantly reduced not only HLA-DR + cell proportion but also HLA-DR MFI in culture treated with IFN-\u03b3 3 days or 5 days later ( Figure 1C, D) . Conversely, reducing the expression of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) using shRNA, which negatively regulates the mTOR, significantly enhanced the HLA-DR expression in culture treated with IFN-\u03b3. Conclusion: mTOR inhibition increased the immunomodulatory function of MSCs, and reduced the expression of HLA-DR upregulated by IFN-\u03b3, which may provide a new strategy to improve MSC-based immunotherapy in inflammatory microenvironment.

Nagler 13 on behalf of Acute Leukemia Working Party 1 Introduction: Primary refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (R-AML) is associated with dismal prognosis. Allogeneic transplantation (HSCT) in the setting of active disease is the alternative strategy. Recently, our group reported that a matched sibling donor or an unrelated donor (UD) (10/10 and 9/10) did not have any impact on primary refractory AML patient outcomes (Brissot et al, ASH 2015) . In contrast, time to transplant was a major prognostic factor for leukemia-free survival (LFS). Unmanipulated grafts are increasingly used in the haplosetting, and innovative regimens for GvHD prophylaxis have been adopted with encouraging results. Haplo-identical donors (HD) are available for practically almost all AML patients (pts) without any delay for transplant. A comparison of the outcomes between HD versus UD in HSCT for R-AML is therefore of special interest, and may contribute to guide our practical management of active AML. Material (or patients) and methods: The current study aimed to compare the outcomes of R-AML pts who received HSCT from a HD (n = 225) versus an UD (n = 1353). Patients with R-AML, who underwent an HSCT with a HD or an UD between 2007 and 2014 and reported to the registry of the EBMT ALWP, were included. The major endpoints were to assess LFS, relapse incidence (RI), non-relapse mortality (NRM), and GVHD and relapse free survival (GRFS) (Ruggeri et al, BMT, 2015, in press). Results: 119 pts received a transplant from an HD with cyclosphophamide post-transplant (HD-PTCy), and 106 an HD with other types of immunosuppressive treatment (HD-IM) while, 1003 pts received a transplant from marched UD 10/10, and 350 pts from a mismatched UD (9/10).The LFS at 2 years was 21.3% in HD-PTCy, 7.3% for HD-IM, 28.1% for UD 10/10, and 20.9% in UD 9/10 respectively. In multivariate analysis, comparing to the 10/10 UD group, there was no statistically significant difference with the HD-PTCy group (HR = 1.03, 95% CI,0.78-1.36, P = 0.850) and with the UD 9/10 group (HR = 1.16, 95%CI,0.99-1.36, P = 0.061), and while LFS was significantly lower in the HD-IM (HR = 1.50, 95%CI,1.18-1.90, P = 0.001). RI at 2 years did not differ between the 4 pts groups being 50.8% in HD PTCy, 58.3% for HD-IM, 45.8% for UD 10/10,and 51.1% in UD 9/10,. In multivariate analysis, 3 predictive factors were associated with a higher RI: HD-IM, patient age, and poor cytogenetics. For NRM, patient age was associated with higher NRM whereas RIC regimen and KPS \u2265 90% were protective factors. Finally, HD-PTCy and UD 9/10 had a comparable GRFS to UD 10/10 (HR = 1.07, 95%CI,0.92-1.24, P = 0.395, and HR = 0.96, 95%CI,0.74-1.26, P = 0.96; respectively) . In contrast, HD-IM resulted in a significant lower GRFS (HR = 1.38, 95% CI,1.09-1.73, P = 0.007). RIC regimen and KPS \u2265 90% were associated with a better GRFS (HR = 0.87, 95%CI, 0.76-0.99, P = 0.033, and HR = 0.64, 95%CI,0.56-0.72, Po10 -4 ; respectively). Conclusion: HSCT may rescue 20% of R-AML patients. Importantly, the outcomes of transplants from UD 9/10 or HD-PTCy were comparable to UD 10/10 whereas HD with immunosuppression as anti GVHD prophylaxis had a significantly lower LFS and GRFS at 2 years. Therefore, HD-PTCy is a valid option for R-AML pts with the advantage of high donor availability and with no delay which is of major importance in the setting of R-AML.

Lamers 2 1 Hematology, 2 Medical Oncology, Erasmus Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, 3 Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, 4 Transfusion Medicine, Sanquin Blood Supply, Rotterdam, Netherlands Introduction: Graft predominance after dUCBT was earlier suggested to be CD8+ T-cell mediated, but is still incompletely understood. We recently showed that CD4+ T-cells rapidly expand after dUCBT and early CD4+ T-cell chimerism predicts for graft predominance. Given the frequent HLA class II allele mismatches between the 2 UCB units in dUCBT, we hypothesized that HLA class II-specific CD4+ T-cells from the 'winning' CBU may be responsible for rejection of the 'loser' CBU. In order to test that hypothesis, we evaluated whether 'winning' CD4+ T-cells specifically recognize individual HLA class II allele mismatches, expressed by the rejected graft, and if present, whether such T-cells also recognize recipient leukemic cells. Material (or patients) and methods: Post dUCBT patient T-cells were propagated in-vitro and subsequently evaluated in a co-culture with class II allele transduced HELA cells. T cell specificities, activation and effector markers were assessed by flow cytometry (FCM). Patient selection criteria included single graft predominance and at least 1 class II mismatch between both units. Results: Eleven patients with poor-risk leukemia were studied in depth, receiving 22 UCB units matched at HLA A, B, and DRB1 for 5/6 (n = 7) or 4/6 (n = 15) with the recipient. The median number (range) of class II allele mismatches between the 2 UCB units per transplant was 2 (1-6). In total, 33 different class II allele mismatches were tested, including 16 at HLA DR, 7 at DQ, and 10 at DP. Peripheral blood CD3+ T-cell numbers of samples taken at 1-6 months post UCBT were low (median: 0.207; range 0.030-0.699 x 10-9/L) with 74% (range, 8-96%) consisting of CD4+ T-cells. In all 11 patients, alloreactive CD4+ T-cells towards one or more mismatched class II alleles were detectable. In total, CD4+ alloreactivity towards 29 out of 33 (88%) mismatches was detected, including 15/16 for DR (94%), 7/7 for DQ (100%), and 7/10 (70%) for DP alleles. Stronger CD4+ T-cell reactivity was observed towards DR and DQ as compared to DP. Limited activity towards matched, control alleles was shown in 2/11 (18%) combinations and in 3/17 (18%) with respect to irrelevant third party alleles. The highest alloreactive responses were observed at 1 month post UCBT. Alloreactive CD4+ T-cells upregulated activation markers CD137, CD134 and PD1 and the effector markers CD107 (degranulation) and Interferon-gamma. Moreover, leukemia cells from recipients exhibiting the same class II mismatch as the rejected unit, were also recognized by effector CD4+ T-cells. Conclusion: Collectively, these results demonstrate that specific effector alloreactivity by 'winner' CD4+ T-cells directed to multiple class II mismatched alleles was present in all patients, already at 1 month post UCBT. These results suggest that immediate cytotoxicity exerted by CD4+ T-cells from the 'winning' cord represent a novel mechanism of rapid rejection of the 'losing' unit after dUCBT. Furthermore, it is suggested that the low incidence of relapse observed after dUCBT may, at least in part, result from an immunological, graft-versusleukemia effect exerted by effector CD4+ T-cells, evoked by mismatched class II alleles expressed by the rejected graft. Evaluation of such CD4+ effector alloreactivity towards class II major mismatches after haploidentical transplantation is now warranted. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: We conducted this study to evaluate the impact of HLA matching degree between patient receiving allogeneic HSCT for hematological malignancies and HSC donor including HLA-DPB1, taking into account the other impacting variables in the allo-HSCT settings. Material (or patients) and methods: A total of 235 patients who received allo-HSCT between January 2005 and December 2014 were included, 131 (56%) were males, median age at allo-HSCT was 50 years (range: 18-69). There was 123 (53%) acute leukemia (93 AML, 30 ALL), 24 (10%) MDS, 35 (15%) multiple myeloma, 20 (8%) NHL, 7 (3%) Hodgkin's disease, 10 (4%) myeloproliferative neoplasms, 13 (6%) CML, and 3 (1%) CLL; 119 (51%) patients received MAC and 116 (49%) received RIC. Disease status at allo-HSCT was CR in 144 (61%) patients and less than CR in 91 (39%). HSC donor was 10/10 HLA matched unrelated (MUD) for 162 (69%) (80 PBSC and 93 BM), among them 21 (9%) were matched for HLA-DPB1, 41 (18%) had permissive mismatch (pMM) and 100 (42%) had nonpermissive mismatch (npMM); while 73 (31%) had 9/10 HLA mismatched donor MMUD (48 PBSC and 25 BM), among them, 7 (3%) were matched for HLA-DPB1, 12 (5%) had pMM and 54 (23%) had npMM; 110 (47%) were ABO compatible, 58 (24%) had minor incompatibility and 67 (29%) had major incompatibility. For sex mismatching, in 33 (14%) cases, it was female donor to a male patient. Results: After a median follow-up for surviving patients of 29 months (range: 4-108), patients with 10/10 HLA MUD had better overall survival (OS) than those with 9/10 MMUD without considering the HLA-DPB1 matching, with 2 years OS probability of 51% vs 35% respectively (P = 0.09), which was reflected by a lower NRM at 2 years of 29% vs 42% (P = 0.07). When considering the HLA-DPB1 matching, we found comparable outcomes in terms of OS and NRM for: 1) 10/10 HLA MUD-DPB1 matched vs 10/10 HLA MUD-DPB1 pMM, 2) 10/10 HLA MUD -npMM DPB1 vs 9/10 HLA MMUD-DPB1 matched, 3) 9/10 HLA MMUD-DPB1 matched vs 9/10 HLA MMUD-DPB1 pMM; all these 3 groups were not significantly different between each other expect for a last group which included 9/10 HLA MMUD with npMM-DPB1, this group had worse OS and NRM compared to all others with 2 years rates of 34% vs 49% (P = 0.05) and 47% vs 29% (P = 0.04) respectively. In multivariate analysis, patient age (450 years), disease status (less than CR), HLA matching (9/10 HLA MUD npMM DPB1) and sex mismatching (female donor to male patient) were significantly impacting OS and NRM. We included all these variables in a risk score: age o 50 years = 0, 4 50 years = 1; CR = 0, less than CR = 1; HLA 10/10 (matched on DPB1) or HLA 10/10 with permissive MM on DPB1 = 0; HLA 10/10 npMM on DPB1 or HLA 9/10 (matched on DPB1 or pMM on DPB1) = 1; HLA 9/10 npMM on DPB1 = 2; for sex matching, female donor to male patient = 1, all other = 0. The risk score distinguished low risk patients (total score = 0), intermediate (total score = 1 or 2) and high risk (total score 42) with 2 years OS and NRM rates of 66%, 52%, 30% (P = 0.003) and 22%, 29% 48% (P = 0.004) respectively. Conclusion: MMUD with non-permissive T-cell-epitope mismatch at HLA-DPB1 should be avoided due to increased rates of NRM. The risk score combining HLA matching with age, disease status and sex matching is very helpful for daily clinical practice offering patients better treatment strategy.

We analyze outcomes of patients with AML who underwent umbilical cord blood or haploidentical HSCT in Spain. Material (or patients) and methods: Between 1999 and 2012, 51 patients underwent single umbilical cord blood myeloablative transplantation supported by CD34+ cells from a HLA-mismatched third party donor (haplo-cord HSCT), and between 2012 and 2014, 36 patients received a myeloablative unmanipulated haploidentical transplantation with post-transplant cyclophosphamide as GVHD prophylaxis (PTCY-haplo HSCT) in GETH centers in Spain. Results: The 30-day cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment was 100% in the haplo-cord and 97% in the PTCY-haplo group with a median time to engraftment of 12 and 17 days, respectively (P = 0.01). The 60-day cumulative incidence of platelet recovery was 82% vs 72%, in a median time of 35 and 29 days, respectively (P = 0.8). The rate of grade II-IV acute GvHD was significantly higher in the PTCY-haplo HSCT group (9.8% vs 26%, P = 0.02) and chronic GvHD rates showed a higher tendency in the PTCY-haplo HSCT group (20% vs 30%, P = 0.07). With a median follow-up of 61 months for the haplo-cord HSCT group and 11 months for the PTCYhaplo HSCT group, OS was 55% and 56% (P = 0.83), EFS was 45% vs 54% (P = 0.57), relapse rate was 22% vs 28% (P = 0.83), and TRM was 22% vs 17% (P = 0.64), respectively, with no significant differences in outcomes. Conclusion: In this multicentric experience, myeloablative cord blood transplantation supported by third party HLA-mismatched donor and haploidentical transplantation with post-transplant cyclophosphamide offer valid alternatives for patients with AML. Engraftment rates were similar in both groups, significantly faster in the haplo-cord group, as well as survival rates. However, GvHD rates were higher after haploidentical HSCT. Significant differences in follow-up time and period of transplant execution compel to take these results cautiously. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Double umbilical cord blood transplantation (dUCBT) has been widely used in adults with acute leukemia (AL). Chimerism analysis usually shows that only one cord blood unit (CBU) provides long term hematological reconstitution, but no factor has been yet identified to reliably predict which will be the winning unit (winCBU).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Morales Meseguer, Murcia, Spain"}, {"text": "To determine factors that may predict the winCBU (defined as the CBU representing 450% of the recipient (rcp) hematopoiesis) and the impact of the winCBU characteristics on outcomes after dUCBT, we studied adults with AL who underwent dUCBT as first transplant from 2004 to 2013 reported to Eurocord. We analyzed 347 patients (pts) who engrafted, had available chimerism data and for whom a winCBU was identified. Results: Among 347 pts, 323 had full donor and 24 had mixed chimerism (45% of donor cells). Diagnosis was ALL for 35% and AML for 65%. At dUCBT 45% were in first complete remission (CR), 44% in second CR and 11% had more advanced disease. Pts median age was 40 years. Median time from diagnosis to dUCBT was 12 months. For winCBUs, median number of TNC and CD34 cells at cryopreservation was 2.5x10 7 /Kg and 1x10 5 /Kg, respectively. Only 4% of the winCBUs were 6/6 HLA-matched to the rcp, 37% were 5/6, 55% were 4/6 and 4% were 3/6 HLA-matched. WinCBUs median age was 3.4 years (0.2-14) , 54% of the winCBUs were gender matched and 38% were ABO compatible with the rcp. Median follow-up for survivors was 35 months. In this population, cumulative incidence (CI) of 100-day acute GvHD grade II-IV was 41%. The 3y-CI of chronic GvHD, relapse (RI) and transplant related mortality (TRM) were 41%, 27% and 24%, respectively. At 3y, leukemia free survival (LFS) was 49% and overall survival (OS) was 54%. In MVA, no significant factors predicting the winCBU were identified after adjusting for HLA and gender matching, type of HLA MMs, TNC and CD34+cells, ABO compatibility, CBU age and inter unit features. Pts with 6/6 or 5/6 HLA-matched winCBUs had a 3y-LFS of 56% compared to 44% for those with 4/6 (P = 0.03), while OS was 62% versus 49% (P = 0.01), respectively. Acute GvHD was increased in pts receiving a 4/6 HLA-matched winCBU (46% versus 35% for those 6/6 or 5/6, P = 0.04). In MVA, 4/6 HLA-matched winCBU was associated with lower LFS (HR 1.5, P = 0.03) and OS (HR 1.5, P = 0.03), and with increased TRM (HR 1.9, P = 0.03) and acute GvHD (HR 1.7, P = 0.01). Older winCBUs (43.4y) were associated with higher acute GvHD (48% versus 35%; HR 1.6, P = 0.02). ATG use and advanced disease were associated with poor outcomes. Conclusion: We demonstrated that specific winCBU characteristics have an impact on dUCBT outcomes. In particular, 4/6 HLA matched winCBU is associated with decreased LFS and OS, and with higher NRM and aGvHD. No factors predicting CBU predominance were identified. Introduction: The definitive management of R/R FL remains controversial. Nevertheless, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) remains the sole curative therapy for FL. Herein, we report the long term outcome of the largest sample of allo-SCT for FL ever studied as well as the identification of patient and disease related factors that were significantly associated with treatment failure. Material (or patients) and methods: Eligible were adult patients with R/R FL having received a first allo-SCT between 2001 and 2011 from an HLA identical sibling donor (SIB) or a well-matched unrelated donor (MUD). Patients with transformed lymphoma, planned second transplants, allotransplants from cord blood, mismatched donors, and transplants with ex vivo T cell depletion (TCD) were excluded from the analysis. Results: 1567 patients met the eligibility criteria (EBMT, n = 1115; CIBMTR, n = 452). The CIBMTR cohort had a higher proportion of MUD recipients [167 (37%) vs 252 (23%), p o0.001], more cases with chemoresistant disease [113 (25%) vs 145 (13%), p o 0.001], less patients having received a prior auto-SCT [53 (12%) vs 403 (36%), p o0.001], more use of myeloablative conditioning (MAC) (145 (32%) vs 220 (20%), p o0.001) and less use of alemtuzumab in-vivo TCD [29 (6%) vs 201 (18%), p o0.001] compared to the EBMT cohort. Median (range) follow up of survivors in months was 58 (3 -130) and 54 (3 -160) for CIBMTR and EBMT patients, respectively. All major outcomes [non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse/progression (R/P), overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS)] were comparable between the CIBMTR and EBMT samples. Multivariate analysis indicated that NRM was significantly affected by age (HR 1.04, 1.02-1.05, p o0.0001), chemoresistant disease (HR 1.61, 1.28-2.03, p o0.0001), 4 = 5 lines of prior CT (vs 3-4) (HR 1.62, 1.20-2.19, P = 0.0015) and Karnofsky performance score (KPS) o80 (HR 2.05 (1.32-3.19 , P = 0.0014); R/P was significantly affected by grade 3 histology (HR 1.63, 1.16-2.26, P = 0.0049) and chemoresistant disease (HR 1.46 (1.07-1.97), P = 0.0156); PFS by grade 3 histology (HR 1.42, 1.15-1.76, P = 0.0012), chemoresistant disease (HR 1.54, 1.28-1.86, P o0.0001), 4 = 5 lines of prior CT (vs 3-4) (HR 1.45, 1.13-1.85, P = 0.0031), MAC (HR 1.36, 1.14-1.63, P = 0.0008) and KPSo80 (HR 1.78, 1.23-2.58, P = 0.0022) and OS by age (HR 1.03, 1.02-1.04, P o0.0001), grade 3 histology (HR 1.44, 1.13-1.83, P = 0.0031), chemoresistant disease (HR 1.59, 1.30-1.95, Po0.0001), 4 = 5 lines of prior CT (vs 3-4) (HR 1.63, 1.25-2.13, P = 0.0003), MAC (HR 1.42, 1.16-1.73, P = 0.0006) and KPSo80 (HR 2.23, 1.52-3.25, P o0.0001). Of note, outcomes between SIB and MUD were similar (3y OS 68% and 62%, P = 0.114). Conclusion: This study represents an example of a fruitful cooperation between two important scientific transplant societies, the EBMT and CIBMTR. Despite significant differences in patient characteristics and transplant strategies between these 2 hitherto largest samples on allo-SCT for R/R FL, long-term disease control was similar and remarkably good with an R/P risk of about only 20% at 5 years. Chemoresistant disease, higher age, multiple pretreatment lines, poor KPS, and MAC all were predictors for an adverse outcome. Introduction: Preliminary clinical data suggest that allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) may provide long-term disease control in a proportion of T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) patients. However, direct evidence of graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity in T-PLL is lacking. We sought to investigate GVL by correlating minimal residual disease (MRD) kinetics with immune modulatory interventions (immunosuppression tapering, donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI), chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD)), and T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity alterations after alloSCT. Material (or patients) and methods: The study sample consisted of 10 patients who received alloSCT for T-PLL at the University of Heidelberg between 2007 and 2015. Quantitative MRD monitoring was performed using clone-specific real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) of clonal TCR beta (TRB) and/or gamma gene rearrangements. TCR repertoire diversity was analyzed longitudinally by next-generation sequencing (NGS) on Illumina's MiSeq platform. Results: All patients had a cytological complete response (CR) after alloSCT (5 unrelated, 4 related, 1 haploidentical). Conditioning was fludarabine with cyclophosphamide and/or total body irradiation-based. 2 patients died early because of acute GvHD, and one had no MRD marker, leaving 7 patients for MRD monitoring. Of these, 3 were MRD-at alloSCT, whereas 5 patients remained or became MRD+ early after alloSCT. In all of these 5 patients, immunosuppression tapering (3) or DLI (2) resulted in significant reduction of MRD levels (range 1-3 log) and was accompanied by cGvHD in 3 patients. However, durable MRD-was obtained in only 2 patients (alive 86+ and 12+ months post transplant), whilst MRD re-increased in 3 patients after 5-28 months despite ongoing cGvHD in one of them. The TRB repertoire of the three patients with the longest follow-up (up to six years) was interrogated longitudinally before and after alloSCT using NGS. In all three patients, MRD decline was reproducibly associated with a shift from a clonal, T-PLL-driven profile to a polyclonal signature which largely corresponded to the donor TCR repertoire and receded with increasing MRD levels. Notably, there was no obvious correlation of GVL-induced MRD decline with emergence of particular dominant T cell clonotypes that could explain a clonal GVL effect. The 3-year relapse-free and overall survival of all 10 patients was 48% (95%CI 16-80%) and 58% (95%CI 27-90%), respectively. Conclusion: This study provides first direct evidence for GVL activity in T-PLL, even though it appears to be often only limited or transient. Moreover, GVL in T-PLL does not seem to be driven by the emergence of novel dominant T cell clones but is rather relying on poly-or oligoclonal T cell responses. Nonetheless, alloSCT in T-PLL is a valuable treatment option, and further evaluation of MRD monitoring is warranted to optimize patient care after alloSCT.

This approach produces some impressive results with median overall survival 410 years in some series. However there is no plateau observed and at relapse, for suitable patients, an allogeneic transplantation can lead to long term disease free survival. We performed a trial evaluating the potential role of Reduced Intensity Conditioning transplantation (RIC SCT) as part of first line therapy for Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Patients were eligible for RIC SCT (conditioned with BCNU, etoposide, Ara-C, melphalan and alemtuzumab: BEAM-C) in first response, using either sibling or unrelated donor grafts. Donor lymphocytes were administered according to a standard protocol for persistent mixed chimerism or disease relapse. The primary endpoint of the study was progression free survival (PFS); a Fleming's single stage design was used with alpha of 0.1 and 90% power. We aimed to show that 2 year PFS could be increased from 45 to 70%, i.e. we would have 15/25 patients alive and progression free at 2 years. Material (or patients) and methods: Twenty-five patients were recruited from 8 UK centres from January 2010 to September 2013. The median age was 54 years (range: 34-70), 22 (88%) were male. First line chemotherapy regimens were varied with 11(44%) patients achieving a CR and 14 (56%) a PR at the time of registration. Eleven (44%) donors were siblings and 15 (56%) were MUDs. Results: All 25 received a RIC SCT and all had platelet and neutrophil recovery by day 100. Toxicity was as expected, with 96% reporting a grade 3-4 event, though only 2 patients died from treatment related toxicity (TRM; 1 multi-organ failure and 1 GvHD). GvHD incidence was low in keeping with the T cell depletion. Only 3 patients developed Grade II acute GvHD (12%), and none developed Grade 3-4 GvHD; six (24%) developed extensive chronic GVHD. With a median follow-up of 35 months there have been 9 PFS events including 5 deaths (2 MCL, 2 TRM and 1 road accident). Fifteen patients were alive and progression free at 2 years with a further 2 patients progression free but yet to reach this point. The 2 year PFS estimate is 68% (95%CI: 46.1% -82.5%). Of the patients who are alive and in remission, 14/16 have reached full donor T-cell Chimerism, 5 post DLI. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate the feasibility of RIC SCT as consolidation of first response in MCL. We reached the target endpoint for PFS and believe that further exploration of RIC SCT in patients identified to be at high risk of disease progression with ASCT is warranted.

An increasing number of NHL patients with pre-existing comorbidities are considered for alloHSCT. Data on the outcome of alloHSCT in elderly patients with NHL is sparse. The purpose of this study was to compare the potential risks and benefits of allogeneic HSCT in elderly patients with NHL with younger patients in a large sample taking also into account comorbidity information. Material (or patients) and methods: Eligible for this EBMT LWP retrospective analysis, were all patients 4 = 18 years who had received an alloHSCT from a matched sibling or unrelated donor (cord blood and haplos excluded) for FL, DLBCL, MCL, or PTCL between 2003 and 2013 and were registered with the EBMT. PRIMARY ENDPOINT was 1-year non-relapse mortality (NRM); secondary endpoints were relapse incidence (REL); and overall survival (OS). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS was based on univariable and multivariable comparisons using stratified Cox and Fine & Gray regression models. OS was computed unadjusted by Kaplan-Meier and by multivariable adjustment using inverse probability weights (IPW). Results: 3,919 patients were eligible and categorized by age: young (Y), 18-50y (n = 1,772); old (O) 51-65y (n = 1,967); very old (VO) 66-77y (n = 180). Of the total 3,919 patients, 37% had FL, 30% DLBCL, 21 % MCL, and 11% PTCL; 85% were chemosensitive and 15% chemorefractory at the time of alloHSCT, respectively. Comorbidity information (HCT-CI) was available for 979 patients. VO patients had a significant overrepresentation of diagnosis MCL, unrelated donor, prior treatment lines, prior autoHSCT and RIC conditioning. With a median follow-up for survivors of 3 years, NRM for Y/O/VO was 16%/20%/33% at 1 year and 18%/23%/37% at 2 years (P40.0001), 2y-REL 27%/26%/23% (P = 0.429), and unadjusted 2y-OS 61%/57%/43%. Multivariable adjustment for confounders including gender, NHL subset, time from diagnosis, chemosensitivity, donor, and conditioning confirmed that higher age was a significant predictor for NRM but not for REL, translating into a 2-year IPW-adjusted OS of 63%/56%/48% for Y/O/VO patients. Other independent significant predictors of NRM were chemorefractory disease, unrelated donor, and myeloablative conditioning; independent predictors of relapse were male gender, diagnosis DLBCL, chemorefractory disease, and less than 2y interval between diagnosis and alloHSCT. Although comorbidity and HCT-CI score were significant predictors of NRM in a subset analysis restricted to the 979 patients with comorbidity information available, age retained its significant impact on NRM but not on REL. Conclusion: AlloHSCT in patients 465y exerts similar NHL control as in younger patients but is associated with a higher NRM which is not fully explained by comorbidity. Thus, although alloHSCT is feasible and effective in very old patients, the increased NRM risk has to be taken into account when deciding about transplant indication for NHL in this age group.

Introduction: Historically High Dose Chemotherapy (HDC) and ASCT is the first option to treat recurrent HL pts with the possibility to achieve long term OS and DFS, ranging from 40 to 60% in chemosensitive pts. Nevertheless ASCT is limited to younger pts and results are not yet satisfactory in refractory or PET + pts after any salvage. In last 5 years BV a new antiCD30 MoAb is a real new challenge to rescue non responding pts. Material (or patients) and methods: We report a retrospective analysis on 63 PET+ pts with HL treated with BV in Rete Ematologica Pugliese (REP-Italy). In 26 pts (41%) BV was used before ASCT and in 28 pts (45%) who failed long-term remission after ASCT. 9 pts (14%) received BV as consolidation after Ric Allo procedures. 53 pts (84%) received 4 2 lines of CHT before BV. 40 pts (63%) were in stage \u2265 IIB prior to BV. 29 pts (46%) were considered refractory after \u2265 2 lines of CHT and 34 (%) relapsed (9.5 months median time to relapse) pre or post ASCT and before BV therapy (Tab. 1). All 63 pts were PET+ before BV. Results: Median number of BV cures was 4 (3-8 range). Responses observed in whole group was CR, plus CRu in 27 pts (43%), PR in 15 pts (24%) with an ORR of 67%. No response or stable disease was demonstrated in 21% (33%) . Responses were evaluated after 4 cures of BV. Regarding response according to timing of BV, CR were 13/26 (50%) in transplant na\u00efve HL pts and 14/28 (50%) in pts relapsed after ASCT. In this last group 12 pts proceeded to Ric Allo transplant. Relapses after Ric allo were 5/12 and only 1 TRM was observed in the Allo transplanted cohort. Conclusion: Our data in a multicentric report support that BV can induce an impressive results (ORR67%) in HL relapsing/ refractory pts. Probably better than classical salvage treatment as ifosfamide or Ara-C containing regimen. PETwas achieved in 43% of pts and no difference of response was observed in transplant na\u00efve or in post ASCT group. BV is considered a really promising option to optimized sensitivity and reduce tumor burden in pts before ASCT and to induce an useful bridge to Ric/Allo in poor risk of HL pts.

Main G-associated non-hematologic toxicities include pulmonary, skin toxicities and nausea. Subsequently brentuximab vedotin (BV) was introduced as salvage therapy prior to allo-SCT to optimize responses pretransplant (2) . Material (or patients) and methods: Between 8/07 and 04/15, forty HL patients underwent an allo-SCT with the G-FM regimen. They had failed multiple conventional treatments (median prior chemotherapy regimens: 4), and a prior auto-SCT (77%). The median age was 31 years (range 20-63). Disease status at SCT was complete remission (CR) or undetermined (CRu) (n = 23; 57%), partial remission (PR; n = 14; 35%), and other (n = 3; 7%). The median time to PD after auto-SCT was 6 months (range 1-68). Twenty-six patients (65%) received BV prior to allo-SCT, and in sixteen of them (40%) was the last therapy prior to allo-SCT. The overall response rate (CR/CRu) prior to allo-SCT was 65% (17/26) in BV-treated patients vs. 42% (6/14) in BV-na\u00efve patients (P = 0.15). The donor was a matched related donor (MRD; n = 21) or matched unrelated donor (MUD; n = 19). The conditioning regimen was G (800 mg/m sq IV x1), F (33 mg/m sq IV daily x4) and M (70 mg/m sq IV daily x2). Thymoglobulin (4 mg/kg IV) was added in MUD allografts. Results: At the latest follow-up (October 2015), thirty-one patients are alive. The median follow-up is 41 months (range 5-87). Twenty-seven surviving patients (87%) have a minimum follow-up of 12 months. Cumulative incidence of transplantrelated mortality (TRM) at day 100 and three years are 15% and 17%, respectively.

Introduction: Even with novel targeted therapies for the treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) patients, such as BTK, PI3K and BCL2 inhibitors, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HCT) will remain an important treatment option, and information on patient and procedurerelated risk factors is valuable. In a previous study we investigated the impact of patient and disease related risk factors on outcomes after HCT. Taking these into account, we explored the impact of procedure and center related factors. Material (or patients) and methods: Data were analyzed from 684 CLL patients who received a first HCT between 2000 and 2011 and who were part of the EBMT CLL Data Quality Initiative, where data on baseline risk factors was collected and outcome information was updated. Event-Free Survival (EFS) up to 5 years after transplantation, mortality in the first 100 days after HCT and mortality after relapse after HCT were investigated. Outcomes were analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models, with a frailty component to account for unexplained center heterogeneity. Risk factors considered included age at HCT, previous autologous transplantation, conditioning, cytogenetics, performance status, remission status, donor-patient sex match, donor HLA match, T-cell depletion (TCD) and transplantation year on the patient level, experience in HCT in general and in CLL in particular on the center level.

Introduction: Veno-occlusive disease (VOD), also known as sinusoidal-obstructive syndrome is a well-defined clinical syndrome, usually manifested clinically by painful hepatomegaly, fluid retention and hyperbilirubinemia. Current treatment of VOD includes adequate fluid and sodium balance, and diuretics. In severe VOD, presented as multi-organ failure (MOF) or bilirubin above 8mg/dl, Defibrotide (DF) for 14-21days is recommended. The aim of the study is to explore whether DF treatment time of moderate /severe VOD can be shortened, based on the resolution of disease signs? Material (or patients) and methods: A retrospective analysis of transplanted patients between January 2011 and April 2015 who were diagnosed with moderate to severe VOD and treated with DF. VOD diagnosis was based on Baltimore or modified Seattle criteria. Fifteen patients having moderate VOD who failed on high doses of diuretics, or those suffering from severe VOD as defined above, were given DF at a dose of 25mg/kg/d. Eleven out of 15 patients were given DF for a period of less than 14 days. Results: Two of 11 patients developed VOD following autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT), two following matched related SCT, and seven following MUD SCT. Using either Baltimore or modified Seattle criteria, four patients were defined as having moderate VOD and seven as having severe VOD with renal, lungs or central nervous system involvement.

VOD developed on a median of 14 days post stem cell reinfusion (range 8-16). Median weight gain was 18% above base line (range 3.7-28%). Ascites was evident in 10 of 11 patients, and in 6 of 11 it was moderate-severe. Median bilirubin was 4.1 (range 0.7-13.8). DF was given for a median period of 8 days (range 3-13d) and was discontinued when bilirubin was significantly decreased (below 2 mg/dl), weight gain reversed to no more than 5% above baseline, or a resolution of above mentioned MOF symptoms occurred. Ten out of 11 patients achieved full resolution of VOD. One patient died from sepsis and respiratory failure a few days after DF was stopped because of suspected pulmonary hemorrhage.

Introduction: In pediatric patients, human adenovirus (hAdV) reactivation after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is frequent and often associated with high morbidity and mortality. Viral clearance is usually achieved by a functional anti-hAdV T-cell response. So far, hAdV hexon has been recognized as a major target of the anti-hAdV immune response. Here, we present data from a prospective study monitoring hexon-and penton-specific T-cell responses in 33 children with hAdV reactivation after HSCT. Material (or patients) and methods: The study was approved by the institutional review board. Patients and legal guardians gave their written informed consent prior to inclusion. All patients undergoing HSCT were routinely monitored for hAdV reactivation in blood and stool by weekly quantitative PCR following institutional guidelines. All patients with quantifiable hAdV in stool or blood entered the T-cell monitoring program. After leukocyte engraftment peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected once per week. hAdV-reactive T cells were determined by interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) ELISPOT assay using overlapping peptide pools derived from the HAdV-C5 proteins hexon and penton. Patients were grouped into strong (440 spots per 250000 PBMC), intermediate (20-40) and weak ( r20) responders.

Most patients received standard antiviral treatment with cidofovir (median 4, range 2-11 doses). Only one patient died of hAdV disease; however, in accordance with earlier data oneyear overall survival was slightly inferior in patients with 410 000 copies hAdV/ml blood (67% vs. 89%, P = 0.17). hAdVspecific T cells were first detected at a median of 63 days after SCT with no timely difference between hexon-and pentonreactive T cells.

Introduction: The recent discovery of the somatically acquired calreticulin mutation in about 30% of the myelofibrosis patients provided a new diagnostic marker, which can also be used as marker of minimal residual disease (MRD) following curative treatment with allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). More than 80% of CALR mutations are of two types: type-1 variants result from a 52-bp deletion and produce the protein change p.L367fs*46, and type-2 variants are caused by a 5-bp insertion and produce the protein change p.K385fs*47. Whereas Sanger as well as next-generation sequencing (NGS) readily allow detection of CALR mutations in newly diagnosed patients, their applicability for MRD detection is limited. Realtime quantitative PCR (qPCR) has therefore been suggested as a potential alternative. In order to combine the increased sensitivity of qPCR with the excellent accuracy of digital PCR (dPCR) we developed a duplex dPCR assay detecting the CALR type-2 mutation in combination with its wild-type allele. Material (or patients) and methods: To address sensitivity and reliability of the novel dPCR assay we first tested it on a new, UKE-1 derived cell line harboring one copy of the CALR type-2 mutation (UKE-1CALR2), which was established by lentiviral gene transfer and single-cell sorting. We generated serial dilutions of UKE-1CALR2 in buffy-coat (BC) cells, isolated DNA and submitted it to dPCR. Using 120 ng EcoRI-restricted genomic DNA we detected up to one UKE-1CALR2 in 10,000 BC cells (0.01%) indicating excellent sensitivity. As expected the detection limit could be further increased by applying the p.K385fs*47-specific dPCR as a singleplex assay. Results: Using our new technique we next performed MRD analysis in CALR+ patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation and compared results with respective qPCR data. Out of 143 patients with myelofibrosis who underwent allogeneic SCT 92 were JAK2V617 positive, 4 MPL positive and 35 CALR positive. Out of these 35 patients 21 harbored the CALR type-1 and eight the CALR type-2 mutation. In seven out of those eight patients both qPCR and digital PCR could be applied for MRD monitoring after SCT. In 3/7 patient qPCR as well as dPCR were negative on day +20, +100 and +180 after transplantation, respectively. In 2 patients dPCR remained positive at days +100 and +180 days before turning negative, whereas qPCR was already negative. In one patient dPCR remained positive 6 months after SCT, whereas qPCR was negative since day +80. None of the above patients had experienced clinical relapse. In contrast, there was one patient who relapsed 28 months after transplantation. That patient was MRD-negative by qPCR until one months before relapse, whereas dPCR, which initially also became negative after SCT (day +180), converted to positivity already 1 year after transplantation and was steadily increasing until clinical relapse. Four patients had insufficient response to NI-0501: 2 patients were also given allo-HSCT, 2 died prior to HSCT of HLH/multiorgan failure. CNS signs and symptoms resolved in the evaluable patients. Significant ( Z50%) tapering of dexa dose was possible in 10/13 patients (median dose: 10 mg/m 2 at baseline vs 4 mg/m 2 at end of treatment; P = 0.023). In all responders, IFN\u03b3 neutralization at time of HSCT was demonstrated by undetectable levels of CXCL9, a chemokine exquisitely IFN\u03b3-induced. The donor was an HLA-identical sibling in 1 patient, an haplo-identical relative in 1 and an unrelated donor in the others (including cord blood cells in 1 case). Two cases of acute GvHD occurred: 1 resolved and 1 led to death together with bacterial sepsis. The remaining after introduction of ruxolitinib. For CLL (Fig. 1d) HSCT is shown along with marketing authorization for Rituximab and Ibrutinib/Idelalisib. Autologous HSCT for CLL has decreased since 2004 after publication of trials showing PFS but no OS advantage, and it appears that allogeneic HSCT rates are dropping after introduction of Ibrutinib / Idelalisib. Whether these are a \"game changer\" as was Imatinib for CML requires additional follow-up.

Anesthezied and tracheotomized rats (n08) with ARDS were pressure-controlled ventilated. Isolated and characterized rat (r-) BM-MSCs were labeled with GFP gene, and introduced in the lungs of the ARDS ratmodel. After applying of MSCs, the life span of each rat was recorded. When rats died, their lung tissues were removed for histopathological examination. Also the tissue sections were analyzed for GFP labeled rBM-MSCs and stained for vimentin, CK19, proinflammatory (MPO, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and MIP-2) and anti-inflammatory [IL-1ra and prostaglandin E2 receptor (EP3)] cytokines. Results: The histopathological signs of rat-model ARDS were similar to the acute phase of ARDS in humans. rBM-MSCs were observed to home in lung paranchyma. Although the infiltration of neutrophils slightly decreased in the interalveolar, peribronchial and perivascular area, a notable improvement was determined in the degree of hemorrhage, edema and hyaline membrane formation in rats treated with rBM-MSCs. Also decreased proinflammatory cytokines levels and increased the intensity of anti-inflammatory cytokines were established. Therefore MSCs could promote alveoar epithelial repair by mediating of cytokines from a proinflammatory to an antiinflammatory response ( Figure 1) . Introduction: As one of the most validated immunotherapies to date, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is a potentially curative option for high-risk hematological malignancies, particularly chemo-resistant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) activity is often accompanied with high risk of allo-antigen reaction of donor T cells against normal host tissue, inducing aGVHD. We have shown that an elevated plasma level of soluble (s)ST2 in HCT patients is a risk factor for severe GVHD 1 . ST2 blockade reduces sST2-producing T cells while maintaining protective membrane (m)ST2-expressing T cells during aGVHD 2 . A novel IL-9 producing T helper subset, Th9, expresses mST2 3 . Furthermore, Th9 cells and IL-9 producing CD8 cytotoxic (Tc9) cells have higher antitumor activity than Th1 and Tc1 cells in melanoma models 4,5 . Our hypothesis is that ST2/IL-33 activation in Th9 and Tc9 (together T9) cells alleviates GVHD and increases GVL activity. Material (or patients) and methods: Allogeneic donor B6 or syngeneic Balb/C T9 cells were generated from splenic T cells cultured with IL-4 + TGF\u03b2 or IL-4 + TGF\u03b2+ IL-33 (T9 IL-33 ). Concurrently, T0 (no cytokines), T1 (with IL-12), and T2 (with IL-4) cell subsets. These cell types were individually adoptively transferred with bone marrow cells into allogeneic irradiated major MHC-mismatched recipients to induce GVHD. For GVL studies recipient mice also received syngeneic retrovirally transduced MLL-AF9 leukemic cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1589, "end": 1598, "text": "Figure 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF29"}], "section": "O141"}, {"text": "Results: We found that T9 IL-33 cells express higher mST2 and PU.1, the master transcription factor of Th9 6 , compared to all other subsets including T9.

Furthermore, in vivo GVL experiments with A20 lymphoma cells or MLL-AF9 transduced leukemia and T9 IL-33 cells resulted in increased survival compared to transfer of WT, T1, T9 or T9 IL-33 cells generated from ST2 -/or IL-9 -/-T cells. Transcriptome analysis of WT T9 IL-33 versus ST2 -/-T9 IL-33 showed higher expression of cytolytic molecules such as Granzyme A, KLRK1, CD160, and Granzyme B in both CD4 and CD8 sorted WT T9 IL-33 cells. T9 IL-33 cells also demonstrated higher in vitro anti-leukemic activity when incubated with MLL-AF9 leukemia as compared to ST2 -/-T9 IL-33 cells. Human T9 cells are poorly explored; we demonstrated that differentiation of human T9 cells in the presence of IL-33 enhanced granzyme B and IL-9 production. Human T9 IL-33 also demonstrated higher anti-leukemic cytolytic activity when incubated with MOLM14, an aggressive tumor cell line with FLT3/ITD mutations, as compared to T9 cells. Furthermore, investigations into the possible mechanism of activation revealed upregulation of CD8\u03b1 in transcriptome and protein levels.

Introduction: Stem cell transplantation (SCT) for acquired bone marrow failure (aBMF) has been established treatment, and the optimal conditioning regimens according to various settings have been developed. Fludarabine (FLU)/cyclophosphamide (CY)-based regimen is one of the standard conditionings for children with aBMF.

Supportive treatment has remained standard of care for management of SCD in past but it comes with huge financial burden over a period of time. Even with best possible supportive care, the quality of life is still very poor and the life expectancy is rarely beyond 50 years. In recent years hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has emerged as a potential cure for SCD. The overall awareness however about this as a curative option is less among the physicians.

Conclusion: In this large cohort of 433 patients transplanted over a 21-year period, older patients with myeloma fared no worse than their younger counterparts with regards to progression free survival or toxicity. Although the majority of older patients received full dose melphalan conditioning, selfdeclared quality of life was better than that of the younger cohort. In light of the fact that myeloma remains incurable, maintaining quality of life in surviving patients is of paramount importance. This study shows that autologous transplantation does not have a deleterious effect on recuperation in fit older patients with myeloma and suggests that this treatment should not be denied solely on the basis of age.

Introduction: Guidelines published in 2009, reviewed in 2012, recommend MMR and to consider Varicella vaccination at a minimum of 24 months post HSCT, in patients at least 12 months off immunosuppression and with no GVHD. In WBMTU we elected not to routinely vaccinate any patients with MMR or Varicella in view of the complexity in determining the appropriate time for vaccination, especially in the community by non-specialists. We check MMR and Varicella serology post transplant and use this information to determine who requires vaccination in association with specific risk factors. Material (or patients) and methods: Between 01/03/02 -28/02/14 we performed 383 Allogeneic stem cell transplants (SCT) on 363 patients of which 110 have been evaluated with MMR +/-Varicella serology. 59% were unrelated donor SCT and 45% received reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). 93% of all SCT received Alemtuzumab at doses of 20-50mg. Patients were transplanted for the following indications: CLL/Lymphoma 21, Myeloma 6, AML/ALL 60, MDS/MPD/CML 20, SAA 3. Due to the small numbers of SCT in patients 460 years (14/110, 13%) in this series, there is no significant difference in serology results compared to patients o60 years Conclusion: 92/110 (84%) of patients show serological evidence of immunity to at least one virus, 70% specifically showing measles immunity.

Introduction: Severe viral infections remain the most important cause of non-relapse mortality and morbidity in recipients of TCR-alpha/beta depleted grafts. In this pilot trial we have tested the hypothesis that infusions of low dose memory (CD45RA-depleted) T-cells are safe and may provide effective means to control viral infections before recovery of broad repertoire of T-cells. Material (or patients) and methods: Fifty six patients received TCR-alpha/beta depleted transplants, median age was 10y , m/f-37/19, with malignant (n-37) and nonmalignant (n-19) disorders after either 1 st (n-52) or 2 nd (n-4) HSCT. Donors were haploidentical (n-23) or matched unrelated (n-33). Patients were eligible if they had stable graft function, no signs of active GVHD or severe infection. Only CMV seropositive donor/recipient pairs were eligible. Infusions of memory T-cells were planned at escalating doses (25x10 3 /kg, 50x10 3 /kg, 100x10 3 /kg in haploidentical, and 100x10 3 /kg, 200x10 3 /kg, 300x10 3 /kg, in MUD transplants), with monthly intervals. T-cells were derived from G-CSF stimulated (n-39) or unstimulated (n-17) apheresis of the original donors. Apheresis product was processed with single-step CD45RA depletion procedure on CliniMACS Plus or Prodigy (n -56) instrument. CD45RA-depleted fraction was aliquoted and cryopreserved for further use. Beyond routine monitoring of CMV, EBV and Adeno DNA load, lympocyte subset regeneration and hematopoietic chimerism, development of pathogen-specific (CMV, EBV, Adeno) immunity was monitored in selected cases by the ELISPOT assay for IFN-gamma production in response to respective antigen stimulation. Results: Between 23.04.14 and 15.10.2015, 56 patients received 143 memory T-cell infusions. Final product contained negligible numbers of CD45RA+ naive T-cells. Median day of the first infusion was + 49 . Sixteen patients had CMV viremia at the moment of 1 st DLI. Five patients developed signs of acute (n-4) or chronic (n-1) GVHD after infusion. At median follow-up of 254(34-430) days the cumulative incidence of any GVHD was 9% (95% CI: 4-21). Three patients had had acute GVHD prior to 1 st memory DLI. In a group of 53 patients without prior GVHD \u0421I of GVHD at +200 FU was 4% (95% CI: 1-16). In a group of 56 patients CI of TRM was 5% (95% CI: 1-18). Causes of death included adenovirus (n-2) and multiorgan failure (n-1). Of note, 5 of 34 patients with CMV reactivation were able to clear CMV without pharmacological intervention. According to Elispot analysis, median number of CMV-reactive cells in the peripheral blood increased significantly from baseline: median 1 (0-972) to 360 (0-983) cells per 3x10 5 MNC, P o0,01. Conclusion: This preliminary analysis suggests that transfusions of low-dose memory T-cells after TCR-alpha/beta depleted transplants is a simple, safe and potentially effective method to improve post-transplant immune reconstitution after the T-depleted haploidentical and unrelated transplantation. A prospective trial of preventive infusions of donor memory cells is planned. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Patients with relapsed and refractory B cell ALL have a dismal prognosis. Chemotherapy followed by autologous T cells that are genetically modified to express a CD19specific chimeric antigen receptor (CD19CAR) has shown promise as a novel therapy for these patients; however, the risk of severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity and relapse has tempered enthusiasm for widespread application of this approach. We are conducting a phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CD19CAR T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19+ ALL. Material (or patients) and methods: Refractory or relapsed CD19+ ALL patients were enrolled. Eligible patients underwent leukapheresis, and T cells were transduced with a Lenti-virus encoding a CAR construct composed of anti-CD19 scFV linked to 4-1BB and CD3\u03b6 signaling domains. To enhance the engraftment of transferred CAR T cells, patients received fludarabine and cyclophosphamide based lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by infusion with 1x10E6-10x10E6 CAR T cells/kg, given over a period of 3 consecutive days. Results: 11 pts were enrolled. The median age was 42 years (range, 26-57). 3 pts (27%) had Ph+ B-ALL (T315I mutation in 2 pts), 5 pts (45%) had prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT), and 6 pts (55%) had 3 or more prior lines of ALL therapy before receiving the CART cell therapy. There were no infusional toxicities. 2 pts died of infection 5 and 11 days after CART infusion respectively and didn't evaluate primary disease status. 9 of 10 patients (90%) achieved a CR 7-10 days after CART cell infusion (Table 1) while 1 got partial remission (8.75%). All the patients (100%) achieved a CR 1 month after CART infusion. Severe CRS associated with elevated serum IFN-\u03b3 and IL-6 was observed in patients with a high tumor burden (Fig.1A) . Treatment for CRS was rapidly reversed in all cases with the IL6-receptor antagonist tocilizumab, together with corticosteroids in 1 pt. CART cells expanded in vivo and could be detected in blood and bone marrow (Fig.1B) . With median follow up 62 days (32-140), 4 pts have ongoing CR. 5 pts with a CR at 1month have subsequently relapsed, 2 with CD19(-) blasts. Conclusion: CD19 CART cells can undergo robust in-vivo expansion and can induce CR in pts with relapsed and refractory ALL. This approach also has promise as a salvage therapy for patients who relapse after allo-SCT. CD19 CART therapy is associated with a significant CRS that responds rapidly to IL-6-targeted anti-cytokine treatment. However, relapse still remains the main obstacle for the successful clinical adaptation. Mechanisms and treatment strategy of relapse after CART infusion needs further study. These findings will also need to be evaluated and confirmed in a larger phase 2 trial.

Beside the poor knowledge of cancer-driving antigens immune escape mechanisms and local immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment are limiting the success of ATT. Furthermore, most targetable tumor antigens are not exclusively expressed by tumor, so that adoptively transferred T cells frequently attack nonmalignant host tissue resulting in possibly devastating graft-versus-host-disease. Material (or patients) and methods: We have generated a transgenic mouse expressing an NFAT (Nuclear Factor of Activated T cell)-dependent Click-beetle luciferase (NFAT-CBLuc mouse).

We are using these mice to optimize migration and effector function of adoptively transferred T cells in an H-Y tumor model via screening for combination treatments capable of overcoming immunosuppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment. Results: In our first experiments using our bioluminescent reporter mouse model, we have transferred sorted T cells from female NFAT-CBLuc mice, which were primed in vivo against H-Y by male splenocytes, and injected them into albino-RagKO recipients. One group of recipients received additionally sublethal irradiation four hours before T cell transfer. We could show increased T cell tumor infiltration and T cell activation at tumor site upon sublethal irradiation of the recipients prior to ATT (Figure 1a ). The combination with irradiation improved the efficacy of ATT, possibly mediated by increased tumor-antigen presentation after irradiationinduced inflammation. Interestingly, the activation signal peaked around day 6 after transfer before rapidly declining to base-line levels although T cells remained in the tumor, illustrating the local suppression of immune cells within the tumor (Figure 1b) . Conclusion: In summary, we established a bioluminescent reporter-transgenic mouse model allowing detailed analysis of longitudinal in vivo T-cell trafficking and local activation. This novel tool could be applied in different tumor models in order to develop and evaluate novel therapeutic strategies for optimal tumor-specific ATT overcoming immune suppression by the tumor and limited on-target/ off-tumor toxicity.

Introduction: The prognosis for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with myelodysplasia in aged patients is poor, because of high mortality related to intensive chemotherapy and allo-HSCT. Thus, additional treatment options for this population are needed. In this context, we are conducting a phase I clinical trial of adoptive immunotherapy using T-cell receptor (TCR) gene-modified T cells targeting leukemia-associated antigen Wilms Tumor 1(WT1) for the treatment of refractory AML and high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 826, "end": 836, "text": "(Figure 1a", "ref_id": "FIGREF29"}, {"start": 1225, "end": 1236, "text": "(Figure 1b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF29"}], "section": "O169"}, {"text": "Material (or patients) and methods: Protocol of this clinical study is approved by our institutional review board (UMIN0001159). A 69 y/o male patient with AML with multilineage dysplasia (AML/MLD) participated in this phase I study after obtaining written informed consent under the declaration of Helsinki. Lymphocytes from 100 ml of patient's peripheral blood (PB) had been sent to the cell processing center, and gene-modified to express HLA-A*24:02-restricted and WT1 235-243 nonamer epitope-specific TCR using the specially designed retrovirus vector encoding codonoptimized WT1-specific TCR a/b genes and siRNAs complementally inhibiting constant regions of endogenous TCR a/b genes (WT1-siTCR vector).

According to the study protocol, 2x10^8 total cells (cohort 1) composed of 29% CD4, 76.6% CD8 including 11.6% HLA*2402/WT1 tetramer-positive subset were infused twice 4 weeks apart. 2 days after 2 nd infusion, WT1 peptide vaccination was added twice 2 weeks apart.

Results: Eventually no severe adverse event associated with infused gene-modified lymphocytes was observed. Infused gene-modified lymphocytes in PB assessed by DNA-PCR were detectable for 2 weeks after each infusion. At 1 st infusion, leukemia blasts (LB) in bone marrow (BM) was 24.8%.

The TCR gene editing technology, based on the knockout of the endogenous TCR alpha and beta genes, followed by the introduction of tumor-specific TCR genes, proved safer and more effective than conventional TCR gene transfer. While successful, complete editing requires multiple manipulation steps and four transduction procedures. Material (or patients) and methods: To reduce the duration and complexity of the procedure, we developed and tested the 'single TCR editing' (SE) approach, based on the disruption of the endogenous TCR alpha chain only, followed by the transfer of genes encoding for a tumor specific TCR. We validated SE exploiting an HLA-A2 restricted TCR specific for NY-ESO-1 157-165 , a cancer testis antigen expressed by numerous solid tumors and by a large proportion of high-risk multiple myeloma plasmacells. Conventional TCR gene transfer (TR) and SE cells were compared in terms of efficacy and safety in vitro (phenotypical analysis, gamma-IFN EliSPOT, 51 Cr release and co-culture assays) and in vivo (adoptive T cell transfer in an experimental humanized-mouse model of multiple myeloma).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 287, "end": 288, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 383, "end": 384, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O169"}, {"text": "Results: The SE protocol rapidly produced high numbers of tumor specific T cells, with an early differentiation phenotype. When tested in vitro, single edited T cells showed a high killing activity against multiple myeloma, similar to that of T cells redirected with TR; however, while TR cells proved highly alloreactive, SE cells showed a favorable safety profile. When infused in NSG mice previously engrafted with myeloma, SE cells mediated tumor rejection without inducing xenogeneic graft versus host disease (GvHD), thus promoting a significantly higher survival than that observed in mice treated with TR cells. The detrimental alloreactive effect mediated by TCR transferred T cells, which led to a xenogeneic GvHD rate comparable to that of untransduced T cells, was confirmed by histopathological examination, that revealed TR cell infiltrations and GvHD-like lesions in several murine organs and tissues. Conversely, the full abrogation of the endogenous TCR repertoire in the SE tumor redirected lymphocytes prevented any off-target reactivity that normally leads to GvHD in mice, potentially providing a safer T cell therapy against cancer. Conclusion: Overall, the single TCR gene editing procedure provides a rapid and efficient method for generating primary T cells that highly express a tumor specific TCR and are permanently devoid of their endogenous TCR repertoire, and thus represents a protean platform for the effective and safe adoptive transfer of allogeneic and autologous T lymphocytes redirected towards any desired tumor associated antigen.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O169"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Our analysis aimed to assess the incidence of SOS after allo-HSCT and the outcomes of a group of AML adults receiving prior GO treatment.

One of the major challenges in HSCT for Hurler syndrome is graft failure. Here, we examined the evolving pattern of graft failure over the past three decades. Material (or patients) and methods: Retrospective review of all HSCT done in children with Hurler syndrome at Blood and Bone marrow transplant unit, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital over a thirty-one-year period(1985 -2015). A full-intensity Busulfan-based conditioning regimen with pharmacokinetic-guided dosing (Bu-pK) was started from September 2004. We compared outcomes and patterns of graft failure before and after this change in 2004. Since 2004, Bu/Cyclo was used from September 2004 to June 2010 and Bu/Flu from July 2010 to December 2015.

Material (or patients) and methods: We evaluated post induction and consolidation bone marrow MRD in 175 AML patients (median age: 57 years, range: 17-89) with 15 months median follow-up (range 1-107). We analysed abnormal leukemia immunophenotype (ALIP) by multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC) and WT1 by RT-PCR as described by Buccisano et al and Cilloni et al. Molecular cytogenetic risk was available in 150 patients. We analysed the overall and 1 year Cumulative Incidence of Relapse (CIR), adjusted according to the MRD status, patients and disease characteristics. Results: WT1 was +ve in 129/165 patients (78%) at diagnosis (median 1,136; range: 0-268,784), in 26/113 (23%) post induction (median 21.15; range: 0.4-134,633) and in 13/103 (12.6%) post consolidation", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF47": {"text": "2% in double positive post consolidation MRD, 30.2% in discordant MRD, 12.1% in double negative MRD (P o0.0001) (Figure 1).

All patients with RRMS have been able to discontinue DMDs following transplant, with neurological improvement seen in all patients with baseline EDSS o6.0. SPMS patients were more likely to progress and succumb to complications of worsening MS, particularly when EDSS was 47.5 pre-HCT. While more DMDs have been approved for treatment in recent years, most require long-term treatment to sustain remission.

Routine collection of QoL measures in patients contributing data to large outcome registries is not standard. The primary aim of this pilot project was to evaluate the feasibility of prospective collection of QOL data on aHCT recipients in multiple transplant centers (TC) reporting clinical data to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). A secondary aim was to correlate QOL data with clinical and demographic data routinely collected. Material (or patients) and methods: 373 consecutive patients (263 adults, 84 children) were enrolled at 8 US TCs. Participants completed QoL measures at four time points:pre-HCT, day 100, 6 months and 1 year (adults: FACT-BMT and SF36; children/parents: age appropriate and proxy PedQL modules). Baseline forms and consent occurred at the TC, while all later contact was with CIBMTR bu phone or mail. Pre-transplant, treatment variables and clinical outcomes were collected as routine on CIBMTR report forms. Additional sociodemographic variables were collected at baseline. A satisfaction survey was completed by participants at 12 months. Binomial regression was used for the feasibility analysis, where feasibility was defined as the proportion of forms completed out of the total possible number. Cox proportional hazards modeling was performed to evaluate associations between pre-HCT QoL and overall mortality after adjusting for factors associated with transplant outcomes. Results: At the majority of centers 4 60% of screened patients agreed to participate (31-85%). Time point retention rates were 69%, 75.8% and 73.9% at day 100, 6 months and 1 year respectively. Factors negatively associated with participation in adults were race other than Caucasian (OR 0.21; CI 0.12-0.36; P o0.0001) and unmarried status (OR 0.41; CI 0.25-0.65; P = 0.0002). In children, higher family income(OR  4.72;; P = 0.0005) was positively associated with participation. 90% of patients reported that they would be willing to complete QoL measures in the future. Scores at baseline for the FACT-BMT, Physical Component Score (PCS) of the SF36 and the PedQL were predictive of overall survival (table 1). In adult patients, older age and the use of cord blood were the only other factors significantly associated with survival, while for children no other significant factors were found.Conclusion: Our results show that it is feasible to prospectively collect QoL measures at multiple time points for unselected transplant patients with an excellent return rate and high levels of patient satisfaction. Importantly, we found that baseline QoL scores are significantly predictive of survival adjusting for clinical factors; suggesting that patient reported outcomes add unique prognostic information not captured by current routine data collection. In addition, they may have a role as an adjustment factor in certain transplant analyses.

Various approaches potentially improve PGF, such as S38 stimulating factors, second HSCT or HSC boost. Based on data showing high rate of engraftment and low acute GVHD with IB-HSC, in particular IB-cord blood, we performed IB-HSC boost to treat PGF in patients (pts) missing an adequate dose of donor HSC, when a second harvest/mobilization was not safe. Material (or patients) and methods: We treated 10 pts with IB-HSCT boost for primary (5 pts) or secondary (5 pts) PGF from 2009 to 2015. The IB infusion was performed under local anaesthesia and with short conscious sedation, in the BMT ward. PLT430x109/L, and Hb48.5g/dL, based on minimal values not requiring transfusions and associated with reduced risk of infections. Hematological response (HR) was defined as ANC42.5 x 109/L, PLT4100 x 109/L, and Hb410 g/dL. Results: The median time after HSCT was 80 days (range, 31 to 205). The median CD34+ cells were 1.26x10 6 /kg b.w. (range, 0.23 to 3.58). The median CD3+ T cells were 1.6x10 7 /kg b.w. (range, 0 to 44.5). The IB-HSC was performed mono-or bilaterally, according to the volume infused. The median BM volume was 140 ml (range, 88 to 170). The median PBSC volume was 90 ml (range, 40 to 120). No immediate or late adverse reactions were observed. 2 pts developed acute GVHD, and they were the only ones receiving CD3+ T cells 41x10 8 /kg b.w. pts obtained a complete HR, 1 patient received a second boost and reached a complete HR. At last follow-up those 4 pts are alive and in CR (median follow-up 58 months; range, 4.3-74.5).Conclusion: IB-HSC boost without conditioning chemotherapy is feasible, safe, easy to perform and improves engraftment (particularly ANC engraftment) and survival outcome. This procedure allows an early and timely HSC boost, avoiding donors a second PBSC mobilization and/or BM harvest. Even when not completely successful IB-HSC could be a pivotal bridge to further PGF treatments. This is of paramount importance when a prompt improvement of blood counts is necessary to control or prevent potentially fatal bleedings and infections.Disclosure of Interest: None declared. and procedural characteristics. The study's objective was prediction of overall survival (OS) at 2 years following UCBT, while ranking variables' predictive contribution and analyzing potential interactions. Random Survival Forest (RSF), a machine learning modeling technique, enabling recovery of non-linear associations, was used for the statistical analysis. Material (or patients) and methods: A cohort of 3,140 UCBT were analyzed. Inclusion criteria encompassed patients at all ages, undergoing an UCBT (single/double unit) in European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) centers, from 2004 to 2014, for acute leukemia, in all disease status. predictors selected by RSF were disease status, age, number of total nucleated cells (TNCs) cryopreserved, antihtymocyte globulin (ATG) administration, transplant year, center experience, recipient's cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus, and the interval from diagnosis to UCBT. Importance was verified by constructing nested RSF models for 2 years OS, developed on serially introduced ranked variables. Indeed, performance plateaued when presented with the top 8 variables described. Advanced disease status, ATG administration, CMV sero-positivity, and increasing age were associated with worse outcomes. Increasing center experience and number of TNCs resulted in improved outcome until reaching a plateau. Selected interactions discovered (figure) were a non-linear relationship between increasing age and worse predicted survival in patients receiving ATG, single CB units, and myeloablative conditioning (MAC). In addition, though a modest effect, double CB units could overcome the detrimental impact of a low TNC dose, as opposed to single units, where TNCs number had a more prominent role. Finally, despite the absence of a direct interaction, patients receiving more than 3.4 X10 6 TNCs/kg had superior 2 year OS compared to those receiving lower numbers.Conclusion: The Random Survival Forest algorithm proved useful in providing a ranked list of 2 year overall survival predictors. Moreover, it captured clinically relevant interactions. Our findings highlight the need for personalizing UCBT, as benefits varied among subpopulations.

Introduction: The role of high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation remains unclear as front line treatment of high-risk Diffuse Large B-Cell Linphoma (DLBCL) patients. Material (or patients) and methods: The cooperative study group Gruppo Italiano Terapie Innovative dei Linfomi (GITIL)designed an open-label, multicenter randomized, phase III trial to compare R-CHOP-14 (8 cycles) to a Rituximab supplemented, high dose sequential chemotherapy program (R-HDS) with autologous stem cell transplantation(1). (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00355199). Inclusion criteria were: age 18-65 years, a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of CD20 positive DLBCL, advanced Ann Arbor stage without CNS involvement, no previous treatment. All patients were in an intermediate-high or high risk group by IPI. The primary endpoint was the event free survival (EFS); secondary endpoints were: the response rate, the progression-free survival (PFS), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) and toxicity. Analisys of primary outcome was intention to treat. 59%). Risk score evaluation was highintermediate in 56% of cases and high in 44%. The two arms were well balanced with respect to all presenting features. In R-CHOP or R-HDS respectively, the planned treatment was 88%) vs. 91% (95% CI: 85% -97%) in R-CHOP and R-HDS respectively (P = 0.036). No difference was found in terms of OS, being 74% (95% CI: 67% -82%) in R-CHOP vs. 78% (95% CI: 71% -86%) in R-HDS (P = 0.55). Hematologic toxicity (grade III-IV) was higher in the experimental arm: neutropenia 34% vs. 84% (Po 0.0001), anemia 14% vs. 71%( Po 0.0001), thrombocytopenia 5% vs. 85% (P o0.0001) in the R-CHOP vs. R-HDS, respectively. Patients in the R-CHOP arm had less GI tract toxicity (10% vs. 29%, P o0.0001) and lower frequency of severe infections (9%, vs. 53%, P o0.0001). Conclusion: In a multicenter setting, the feasibility of R-HDS was more difficult compared to R-CHOP-14 and both programs proved equally, highly effective in high-risk DLBCL patients.

While the kidney is most commonly affected, TA-TMA involving organs such as the lung, bowel, heart, and brain is now known to have specific clinical presentations. In fact, there is growing evidence that highlighting the impact of TA-TMA on the gastrointestinal tract after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). However, similar gastrointestinal symptoms may also be findings of acute gut graft versus host disease (GVHD), making the clinical diagnosis difficult. Moreover, identification of intestinal TA-TMA (i-TMA) is very important since continuation of calcineurin inhibitors can significantly worsen symptoms in affected patients, which is an opposite treatment for acute GVHD. Therefore, unidentified i-TMA can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Our aims were to identify those patients misdiagnosed with i-TMA, and to determine the clinical impact of i-TMA on this series of patients. Material (or patients) and methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from all allogeneic HSCT recipients, transplanted between 2004 and 2012, who were evaluated with colonoscopy, including mucosal biopsies, in our hospital. Clinical symptoms of i-TMA and laboratory findings of TA-TMA were recorded. Other post-HSCT complications such as GVHD were also recorded. Retrospective colonoscopic examinations were performed. All biopsy specimens of the gut were retrospectively examined. Results: In this period of time, 322 patients (\u226518 years old) received an allogeneic HSCT. The incidence of grade III-IV acute GVHD and systemic TA-TMA were 15.5% and 6.8%, respectively. A colonoscopy was performed in 30 patients, and 21 biopsies of 17 patients were evaluated. The main indications for colonoscopy were an undiagnosed gastroscopy and persistence of a high suspect of acute GVHD, the presence of intestinal bleeding or suspicion of viral infection. Six out of 17 evaluable patients (35%) were retrospectively diagnosed with i-TMA. All 6 patients were initially diagnosed with acute GVHD. Only 3 out of 6 i-TMA patients had systemic TA-TMA according to probable TA-TMA criteria by Cho, et al 2010, but none of these 3 patients fulfilled the previously established international criteria(Ho, et al 2005, Ruutu, et al 2007. Most important, i-TMA was associated with a worse outcome. All patients with i-TMA were death at 28 months, whereas median overall survival was not reached for patients without i-TMA (P = 0.008).

Therefore, strategies of active surveillance for identification of MDR-GN carriers at risk of subsequent infection during intensive treatments are urgently needed. Material (or patients) and methods: From Jun 2012 -Aug 2015 (38 months), we actively surveilled MDR-GN colonization status trough weekly rectal swabs in 524 consecutive hematological patients (286 undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), 99 autologous HSCT and 145 receiving chemo or supportive therapy) from the time of hospital admission. Blood cultures were also performed at each febrile episode. Patients were treated according to internal antimicrobial guidelines, usually with multiple targeted antimicrobial therapy in case of a previously known MDR-GN colonization. Results: Overall, 4168 rectal swabs were collected, 429/4168 (10%) showing positivity in 152/524 (29%) patients. Distribution of MDR-GN colonization was as follows: carbapenemaseproducing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) 43 (23%) cases, extented-spectrum beta lactamase producing (ESBL) E.coli 43 (23%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 41 (21%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia 39 (20%), ESBL+ Klebsiella pneumoniae 2 (1%), other species 23 (12%). Carriers of MDR-GN experienced a higher number of bloodstream infections compared to noncolonized patients (p o 0.0001) and were subjected to higher number of swabs (average 10,4 \u00b1 8,3 SD versus 7,3 \u00b1 6,2 SD; P = 0.0006, respectively). While in non-colonized patients, only 4/372 (1%) developed a MDR-GN sepsis, this percentage raised up to 29% (45/152) in case of colonization (Po0.0001). Distribution of MDR-GN infections was as follows: KPC-Ko 15 (31%) cases, E. coli ESBL+ 13 (27%), P. aeruginosa 9 (18%), S. maltophilia 6 (12%), K. pneumoniae ESBL+ 3 (6%), other species 3 (6%). The risk for MDR-GN infection was higher in allogeneic HSCT (66% of cases) decreasing in chemo-or supportive therapy (20%) and finally in the autologous HSCT (14%) group. Despite aggressive treatment, overall mortality was 33% (16/49), being attributed to KPC-Kp in 8 (50%) cases, S. maltophilia 4 (25%), P. aeruginosa3 (19%)  and to E. Coli ESBL+ 1 (6%). In allogeneic HSCT, pre-transplant colonization status was evaluable for 236/286 pts, 51/236 (22%) of which were transplanted regardless a known MDR-GN positivity. Only 8/51 (16%) developed a subsequent infection from the same MDR-GN pathogen, with an attributed mortality of 25%. Moreover in 18/49 (37%) patients, a positive rectal swab Positive rectal swabs significantly associate, and potentially anticipate, the development of a subsequent MDR-GN infection. Data from active surveillance and a timely application of prophylactic (i.e contact precautions, intensified hygienic measures in carriers) and therapeutic strategies (i.e prompt targeted therapy) may reduce infectious mortality in hematological cancer patients. Moreover, MDR-GN colonization before allogeneic HSCT should not preclude clinicians from proceeding to transplant. Disclosure of Interest: None declared.

We describe a 8-month-old child who died of fatal animal astrovirus encephalitis following a haematopoietic stem cell transplant for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with high-risk cytogenetics, t (10;11) in first remission. Material (or patients) and methods: The child achieved remission following ADE therapy and received two courses of consolidation with FLAG-IDA. The treatment was complicated by Enterobacter neutropenic fevers and enteritis due to human astrovirus infection, followed by persistent asymptomatic astrovirus detection in her stools. HLA-matched, major ABOmismatched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant was done following conditioning regimen with busulfan, cyclophosphamide, melphalan and alemtuzumab and post-transplant graft-versus-host prophylaxis with ciclosporin. Neutrophil engraftment was demonstrated on Day +17 and donor chimerism was 100%. Early transplant course was complicated by culture negative neutropenic fevers, veno-occlussive disease and grade 1 cutaneous graft-versus-host disease that responded to topical steroid. Nutrition rehabilitation was complicated by protracted human astrovirus positive diarrhea, which was finally resolved upon discharge home on Day +94. Her stool was astrovirus negative on Day +92. Her ciclosporin was tapered off by Day +100. Results: The child became encephalopathic at Day +120 and subsequently developed uncontrolled dystonic movement. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis done on two occasions showed albuminocytoplasmic dissociation and real-time PCR was negative for herpesviridae (herpes simplex virus I and II, varicella zoster, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, HHV6, and HHV7), papovaviridae (BK, JC) adenovirus, enteroviruses, parechovirus, norovirus, human astrovirus, measles, and Toxoplasma.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF54": {"text": "O139Modulation of HHV-6B cell receptor OX40 (CD134) expression on CD4+ T cells may favour HHV-6B infection after allogeneic cord blood transplantation A.

Mechanisms underlying such infections remain unclear. Recently, OX40 (CD134), a member of the TNF receptor superfamily expressed on activated T lymphocytes, has been identified as a specific HHV-6B entry receptor. We hypothesized that overexpression of CD134 on CB grafted cells or during immune recovery after CBT could favor HHV-6B infection. Material (or patients) and methods: This prospective study aimed at comparing CD134 expression on CD3+/CD4+ T-cells first between CB and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) grafts, then during early immune recovery, after CBT or PBSCT on blood samples collected at day 0, then every 15 days up to day +60 post-transplant after informed consent. FITC-conjugated CD134 (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA) was used to assess CD134 expression in multiparameter flow cytometry (Navios, Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL) by comparison to an isotypic control. A mean fluorescence intensity ratio of 2 or higher was considered significant. HHV-6B reactivation was assessed by standard viral PCR on the same samples. Results: Between December 2014 and June 2015, CD134 expression was analyzed on 11 CB grafts from 9 allotransplanted children (median age 4 years (range 2-19), males 33%, lymphoid disease 44%, complete remission (CR) at transplant 67%, single CBT n = 7; double CBT n = 2, myeloablative regimen 78%) and 12 PBSC grafts from 13 allotransplanted adults (median age 63 years (range: 43-70), reduced conditioning regimen 100%, donor type sibling n = 6, matched unrelated n = 3; haplo-identical n = 4). While all PBSC grafts contained CD134+/CD4+ cells, this was the case for only 3 CB grafts. Median CD134+/CD4+ cell P = 0.1) and such as soon as day+15. Overall, the median percentages of CD134+/CD3+ T-cells were higher after CBT (18,99%, range: 2-38.6%) than after PBSCT (10,55%, range 1.2-35%; P = 0,04). HHV-6B positive PCR was documented in 10/22 patients and 23/100 samples after transplant. The median viral load was 3 log UI/mL (range2-5.4). HHV-6 positive PCR was asymptomatic in all but one CBT patient who died at day +32 from HHV-6B pneumonia. As expected, the numbers of HHV6+ samples were significantly higher after CBT than PBSCT (16/40 vs 7/60 P = 0.001) with a peak at day+30 (86% of positive samples vs Expression of the viral receptor CD134 on na\u00efve CB T-cells increases during immune reconstitution. This expression is higher than after PBSCT and precedes HHV-6B peak infection after CBT, suggesting no role for HHV-6B regarding CD134 induction on CB CD4+ T cells. Thus, modulation of CD134 on CD4+ T cells may favor HHV-6B infection after CBT. Use of an anti-CD134 antibody, could be considered to alleviate the risk of HHV-6 infection in this context.

KIR ligand incompatibility between donor and recipient might favor Natural Killer (NK) cell alloreactivity after UCBT in AML patients(Wilhemze et al, 2009). The aim of the present study is to analyze the impact of KIR ligand incompatibilities and NK cell reconstitution on outcome after RIC-UCBT in a prospective trial. Material (or patients) and methods: Seventy-six patients were enrolled for an AML in complete remission in a French prospective trial(Rio, 2015)  in 23 centers fromOct. 2007 to  Sept. 2009. Peripheral blood samples were collected during the first year following UCBT in order to realize an extensive prospective phenotypic and functional study of NK cells. NK biological data were available at M1 for 54 patients. The inhibitory Killer-Immunoglobin Receptors (KIR) KIR2DL1, and KIR2DL2/3 bind KIR ligand C2 and C1 respectively, resulting in inhibition of NK-cell mediated lysis. Recipients and UCB were classified into C1 or C2 family depending on their HLA-C typing (C1-C1, C1-C2 or C2-C2). Results: Among the 54 patients, 35 events occurred (relapse or TRM). Median EFS and OS were 13.2 and 18.3 months, respectively. Recipients C2-C2 had a significant worse EFS and OS than C1-C1 or C1-C2 (median EFS C2-C2 = 3.8 month vs 15.1 month for C1-x; P = 0.002); median OS C2-C2 3.8 months vs 29.9 months for C1-x; HR = 6.12, P = 0.001). High intracellular staining of CD107a, reflecting the capacity of NK degranulation with HLA negative K562 target, correlated with better OS. CD107a expression was divided in 2 groups at median ( = 51%). Median OS of CD107 (0-50%) was 12.8 months vs 20.9 months for CD107a (51-66); P = 0.029. Relapse risk was highly increased in recipients C2-C2 (HR = 5.04, P = 0.02). Low expression of CD16 (HR = 0.97, P = 0.043), high expression of HLA-DR (HR = 1.08, P = 8e-04) on NK cells, and recipients C2-C2 (HR = 9.44, P = 0.026) significantly increased the risk of TRM. The inhibitory KIR2DL1 receptor binds to C2 ligands. Of interest, KIR2DL1 was significantly decreased on C2-C2 recipients NK cells at M1, as compared to C1-x recipients NK cells. On the contrary, KIR2DL2/3 and KIR3DL1 restored promptly, suggesting a sequential expression of KIRs. As interaction between inhibitory KIRs and their ligands are essential for NK cells to become functional (\"licensing\" S84 process), we can hypothesize that the weaker expression of KIR2DL1 on C2-C2 NK cells alters the licensing process, rendering the NK cells hypo-responsiveness. Conclusion: Weak capacity of degranulation, low expression of CD16, and recipient C2-C2 is correlated with a worse outcome after RIC-UCBT in a prospective trial for AML patients. These features can reflect an alteration of the NK licensing process and might have impact on clinical outcome after UCBT.

Up to one-third of AML relapses after haploidentical HSCT are due to leukemic variants that evade donor T cell control through the de novo genomic loss of the mismatch HLA haplotype. Still, these \"HLA loss\" variants should in principle represent excellent targets for alloreactive donor Natural Killer (NK) cells. Aim of this study is to investigate NK cell dynamics in this peculiar context to understand the biological bases of their failure in controlling or preventing the occurrence of HLA loss relapses. Material (or patients) and methods: We analyzed a cohort of 30 patients who experienced HLA loss relapses after haploidentical (n = 28) or unrelated donor (n = 2) HSCT. NK cell alloreactivity was predicted according to the Perugia algorithm. KIR typing was performed using a commerciallyavailable kit. The phenotypic features of circulating NK cells were analyzed in 8 patients at the time of HLA loss relapse, in 9 at the time of non-HLA loss \"classical\" relapse, in 10 long-term remission patients and in 17 healthy individuals, employing a multiparametric flow cytometry panel of 27 markers involved in NK cell target recognition, activation, maturation and exhaustion, and the bhSNE bioinformatic tool for high dimensional single-cell analysis. Results: Based on donor-recipient HLA typing, NK cell alloreactivity was predicted in 18/30 (40%) patients at the time of HSCT and gained in additional 7 (23%) as a consequence of the loss of the mismatched HLA haplotype from AML blasts. KIR genotyping documented that most of the HSC donors for HLA loss patients carried high numbers of activating KIR genes, and potentially alloreactive single KIR + NK cells were detectable in all study groups, including in particular patients with HLA loss relapse. However, when compared to their counterparts from healthy individuals, NK cells from transplanted patients expressed significantly lower levels of SIGLEC9 (Po 0.0001), a receptor shown to be relevant for tumor immunosurveillance. Moreover, comparing HLA loss and classical relapses we detected in HLA loss patients lower frequencies of NK cells expressing the activating receptor NKG2C, possibly a consequence of the lower incidence of CMV reactivations in this subgroup, and higher expression of exhaustion markers, including in particular TIM3 (Po0.01). Accordingly, bhSNE maps demonstrated differential clustering of NK cells between the two groups of relapses, mainly explained by the aforementioned differences. Conclusion: Even though most of the patients with HLA loss relapses satisfied the conditions for predicted NK alloreactivity, this was not enough to prevent clinical relapse. Defective immunosurveillance was not due to lack of activating KIR genes or of single KIR + NK cells, but might rather be explained by relative lack of NKG2C + cells and by the upregulation of exhaustion markers. Taken together, our data evidence that the repertoire of circulating NK cells at the time of HLA loss is largely defective. As a solution, we propose that therapeutic protocols employing freshly isolated mature donor NK cells might be tested for the prevention and treatment of HLA loss relapses.

In animal studies, high IFN\u03b3 levels can also impair HSC differentiation and mediate HSCT rejection. Immune-chemotherapy, primarily etoposidebased regimens, is at present the approach used to control HLH and bring patients to curative allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT). In spite of recent attempts to optimize treatment regimens, mortality and morbidity remain high, in part due to drug-related toxicities. NI-0501 is a fully human, high affinity, anti-IFN\u03b3 mAb that binds to and neutralizes human IFN\u03b3. Material (or patients) and methods: An open-label Phase 2 study is conducted in Europe and US to evaluate NI-0501 treatment in pHLH children. NI-0501 was administered at initial dose of 1 mg/kg every 3 days, with possible dose increase guided by PK and clinical response on initial background dexamethasone (dexa) of 5-10 mg/m 2 . Treatment duration ranged from 4 to 8 weeks. 16 patients were enrolled: 8F/8M, median age 1.2yr (range 0.2-13); 14 patients received NI-0501 as 2 nd line treatment after having failed conventional therapy or being intolerant to it. Two patients have been treated with NI-0501 in 1 st line; 12 patients carried a known HLH genetic defect (4 FHL2, 2 FHL3, 1 FHL4, 3 GS-2, 1 XLP1, 1 XLP2). Most patients were at the severe end of HLH spectrum and carrying significant toxicities from previous HLH treatments. At baseline, CNS involvement was recorded in 4 patients. One patient was excluded from efficacy analysis due to a subsequent secondary HLH diagnosis. Results: Of the 15 evaluable patients, 13 have completed treatment and 2 are ongoing.

Response to IST can be anticipated in 50-60% of patients, relapse in about 20% of responders and clonal evolution to MDS in 10% of long term survivors. We recently reported that the absence of a minor paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria population and a short telomere length is an efficient predictor of poor IST response at 6 months (19% in poor prognosis group vs 70% in others) in children with acquired AA(Narita, A et al.  Haematologica 2015). This finding let us reevaluate recent outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in children with AA to address a question who should be treated by up-front HSCT rather than IST for better decision-making treatment algorithms. Material (or patients) and methods: We analyzed 67 children with AA who underwent HSCT in Nagoya university hospital between Jan. 2000 and Mar. 2015. Forty patients received HSCT from HLA matched bone marrow donor (23 family donors and 17 unrelated donors). Twenty seven patients received HSCT from HLA mismatched donors (19 mismatched unrelated BM donors, 7 HLA haploidentical family donors and 1 unrelated cord blood). Twenty three patients transplanted from HLA matched family donor received cyclosporine and short term MTX as GVHD prophylaxis and all other patients received tacrolimus and short term MTX.

In comparison to the general population, pediatric HCT survivors had a 33 times higher than expected rate of CNS tumors (95% confidence interval, 22.98-45.77), P o0.0001. On multivariate analysis significant risk factors for the development of a CNS tumor were having an unrelated donor HCT (HR 3.9), prior CNS disease (HR 3.72) and radiotherapy prior to conditioning (HR 2.13). There was no relationship with TBI dose. Conclusion: Reassuringly, there were no CNS tumors patients transplanted for non-malignant conditions, the majority of whom received chemotherapy only conditioning. However, survivors of HCT for childhood haematological malignancies had a markedly increased risk of CNS tumors. The risks are increased in those who had unrelated donor HCT and in those who received pre-conditioning radiotherapy.

The median age at transplantation was 40 years (range, . The diagnoses included acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 21), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 14), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 8), lymphoma (n = 11), chronic myeloid leukaemia/myeloproliferative neoplasm (n = 6), and others (n = 5). 19 patients were transplanted from a related donor (bone marrow, n = 9; peripheral blood, n = 10) and 46 were transplanted from an unrelated donor (bone marrow, n = 34 and cord blood, n = 12). Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis was cyclosporine-based (n = 20) or tacrolimus-based (n = 44). Conditioning regimens were myeloablative (n = 45) or reduced-intensity (n = 20). SOS was defined following the Seattle (McDonald, Hepatology 1984) , Baltimore (Jones, Transplantation 1987) , or other criteria. Severe SOS was defined as SOS with renal and/or respiratory failure at diagnosis (Yakushijin, BMT 2015) . Complete response (CR) for SOS was defined as resolution of all signs and symptoms of SOS diagnostic criteria. Results: Of 56 patients who met the Seattle criteria, 12 also met the Baltimore criteria. The remaining 9 patients were clinically diagnosed. The median doses and durations were 24 mg/kg (range, 7-80) and 15 days (range, 1-46) for DF, and 380 U/kg (range, 130-490) and 8 days (range, 3-52) for rhTM. The 100-day CR rates were 50% and 54% in the DF and rhTM groups, respectively. Fourteen patients had severe SOS (DF group, n = 3; rhTM group, n = 11), of whom 4 achieved CR (DF group, n = 0; rhTM group, n = 4). Following the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (version 4), several grade 3+ haemorrhagic adverse events were directly related to DF or rhTM: 1 patient in the DF group experienced both gastrointestinal (Gr3) and pulmonary (Gr4) bleeding, and 5 patients in the rhTM group experienced gastrointestinal (Gr3, n = 2), bronchial (Gr3), oral (Gr3), or intracranial (Gr4) bleeding. The 100-and 180-day overall survival rates were 50% and 50% in the DF group, and 48% and 38% in the rhTM group. Conclusion: Our results suggest that DF appears to be effective also in the Japanese population. Although rhTM prompted some haemorrhagic adverse effects, it might be an alternative option for SOS. Prospective research is needed to determine the efficacies of these agents.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 909, "end": 936, "text": "(McDonald, Hepatology 1984)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 949, "end": 978, "text": "(Jones, Transplantation 1987)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1081, "end": 1103, "text": "(Yakushijin, BMT 2015)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}, {"text": "Risk factors and consequences of CMV and EBV reactivation after TCR alpha/beta and CD19+ depleted unrelated and haploidentical HSCT in pediatric patients A.Laberko 1,* , A. Introduction: The reactivation of CMV and EBV after hematopoietic stem cell transplants is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Most methods of T-cell depletion increase the risk of virus reactivation, but the data remain scarce for the TCR alpha/beta and CD19+ depletion. Material (or patients) and methods: In this study were included 182 patients after haploidentical and unrelated HSCT with TCR alpha/beta and CD19+ depletion perfomed during 2012-2014. Patients after second transplants, patients with active viral replication at the moment of HSCT and those who received prophylactic post transplant cell therapy with CD45RA-depleted DLI were excluded. Male:female ratio was 124:58, 114 had malignant and 68 nonmalignant diseases, median age was 6,4 y. One hundred twenty four transplants were from unrelated (9/10 or 10/10 matched) and 58 from haplo donors. Donor/recipient serostatus for CMV was: D+/R \u00c0 in 13, D+/R+ in 77, D \u00c0 /R+ in 51, D \u00c0 /R\u00c0 in 17, unknown for 1 donor, 23 patients with combined PIDs were excluded due to uninterpretable serostatus. Conditioning regimens contained treosulfan and fludarabine+/-melphalan for malignant and PID patients and were Cy/Flu-based for aplastic anemia, 100 patients received serotherapy with horse ATG (ATGAM), 41 patient received thymoglobulin+rituximab. CMV and EBV DNA were monitored weekly by RQ PCR. CMV viremia was registered if more than 500 copies per ml of blood were detected. In all cases of CMV positivity patients received standard preemptive therapy with gancyclovir. Results: The cumulative incidence of CMV reactivation was 0,51 (95% CI 0, 6) . Median time to reactivation was 5 weeks. Median reactivation duration was 3 weeks. In univariate analysis two factors increased th CI of CMV reactivation -acute GVHD 4grade II, (0,67 vs 0,4 P = 0,003) and the diagnosis of malignant vs non-malignant disease (0,58 vs 0,39, P = 0,028). In CMV-negative recipients CI of CMV reactivation was 0,36 for CMV-donor and 0,3 for CMV+ donor vs 0,56 in CMV D+/R+ and 0,57 D-/R+ (P = 0,25). Age, sex, type of donor, type of serotherapy did not significantly affect CMV reactivation rates. The incidence of CMV disease was 0,049. CMV reactivation did not significantly affect the incidence of relapse and TRM in patients with malignant disease. No correlation was found between CMV viremia and the tempo of the immune recovery of CD3+, CD16+56+ and TCR gamma/ delta cells on days +30 and +60. The cumulative incidence of EBV reactivation was 0,33 (95% CI 0, 42) . Median time to reactivation was 13,5 weeks. S90 than 1 line therapy. Ten of the 23 p received eventually allo HSCT, all but one for the treatment of AA. At last follow-up, 14/23p (61%) were alive, and 9 had died: the cause of death was transplant related mortality (4) or AA related mortality (5). None of the deaths were due to the lymphoma. The relationship between AA and lymphoma is shown in the figure, where time of appearance of the lymphoma (represented as a box) is shown in relation to AA (considered as time 0), and the three clinical presentations (lymphoma first, AA and lymphoma together, AA first) are outlined. Conclusion: We confirm that the rare association of AA and lymphoma may occur in any of the three described clinical presentations. Patients were clinically very heterogeneous. Sequential presentations were more frequent and concomitant presentation did not show a particular profile. The management was heterogeneous but the outcome was mainly affected by the AA, not the lymphoma. This is the largest series with this rare association evaluated so far; while there is no evidence of a common pathophysiologic mechanism we can hypothesized that different underlying mechanisms may be involved in the different forms of presentation. Causality remains however controversial. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Major changes in the prevalence of \u03b2-thalassaemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) have taken place in Spain in the last few years because of the immigration process that started at the end of the 20 th century. This increase in the prevalence of hemoglobinopathies is raising the need for improved prevention and treatment services. Here, we briefly review the current situation in Spain regarding neonatal screening and treatment guidelines and we present a retrospective analysis of the Spanish results in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in \u03b2-thalassaemia and sickle cell disease (SCD). Material (or patients) and methods: Data from GETMON (Spanish Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation) was Results: The treatment was well tolerated and no severe noninfectious toxicity could be observed in the patients. The endpoint of NK cell expansion was not reached, but nine patients had positive microchimerism (NK cells of donor origin detectable by RT-PCR at day 7-14), that thereafter became undetectable within 7-14 days. Five of nine patients achieved complete remission (CR) after 1 month. Five patients became eligible for and proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Four of these are still free from disease 8-23 months after transplantation. No patient without detectable NK cells obtained CR. Six patients died from progressive disease and three patients with minor response and progressive disease died in infections within three months of therapy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1793, "end": 1798, "text": "CI 0,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1799, "end": 1801, "text": "6)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2692, "end": 2697, "text": "CI 0,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2698, "end": 2701, "text": "42)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O140"}, {"text": "The results suggest that a combined lymphodepletive regimen followed by NK cell therapy may induce remission in patients with high-risk, chemo-refractory disease and provide a bridge to allogeneic stem cell transplantation.Notably, clinical responses were observed after only a minimal in vivo NK cell expansion and were independent of KIR-ligand mismatch.

Sakemura 1,* , S. Introduction: Clinical trials of CAR-T therapy demonstrated toxicities such as on target/off tumor effects, which could be life-threatening. These toxicities are major drawbacks for broader application of CAR-T therapy. Therefore, a further modification to control CAR expression is needed. In this study, we aimed to develop inducible CAR-T cells based on the use of Tet-on system. Material (or patients) and methods: We developed inducible CD19CAR system by infusing anti-CD19-CD3\u03b6-CD28-tEGFR into pRetroX-TetOne vector (Tet-19CAR). By using Tet-19CAR transduced SUPT1 cells, the expression and disappearance kinetics of CAR were determined. We also retrovirally transduced Tet-19CAR into human CD8+ T cells, and achieved more than 90% purity of CAR positive T cells after beads selection. These CAR-T cells were used in vitro assays such as cytotoxicity, cytokine production and T-cell proliferation. Furthermore, NOG mice bearing CD19+ Raji cells were given Tet-19CAR with or without doxycycline (Dox) and examined for their overall survivals and tumor fluxes with bioluminescence imaging.Results: With more than 100 ng/mL of Dox, CD19CAR was expressed in both of SUPT1 and CD8+ T cells.
