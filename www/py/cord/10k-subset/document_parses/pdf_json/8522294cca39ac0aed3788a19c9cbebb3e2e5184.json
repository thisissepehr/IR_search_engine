[9] found three homozygous individuals for the variant rs12252-C among 53 patients from the United Kingdom hospitalized with influenza (89.5 % H1N1pdm), resulting in a significant overrepresentation when compared with Europeans. Later, Zhang et al. [12] found a significant overrepresentation of rs12252-C homozygotes among 32 Chinese patients with severe H1N1pdm infection compared with 51 individuals with mild disease or population controls. These studies suggested that homozygosity for the IFITM3 rs12252-C allele was associated with a populationattributable risk for severe influenza of 5.4 % in Northern Europeans and 54.3 % for severe H1N1pdm infection in Chinese [9, 12] . Both studies included small sample sizes. Moreover, the association found by Everitt et al. [9] relied on imputed control genotypes, which may bias the frequencies when rare SNPs, such as rs12252, are studied. In addition, not all of their three rs12252-C homozygous patients have undergone population stratification analysis, thus not ensuring only Caucasian ancestors. A more recent study did not find any rs12252-C homozygous in a group of 34 patients from the United Kingdom who required ICU admission due to severe H1N1 IVI [14] . By contrast, two rs12252-C homozygous individuals in a group of 259 Caucasian patients with mild influenza, and four in a group of 2,623 Caucasian controls who had never required hospital admission, were identified. The authors found a recessive association of the rs12252-C variant with mild influenza, but not with severe influenza. These data contrast with those of Zhang et al., who found an association with severe but not mild influenza [14] . Among our 118 patients with IVI, the only patient homozygous for rs12252-C was a 15-yearold girl who had a severe neurological disorder (West syndrome), a risk factor for severe influenza. However, after infection with H1N1pdm, she presented with mild influenza. Hence, no association with severe IVI was observed in our study. By contrast, we found a nonsignificant increase of the rs12252-C allele, but not genotypes, in patients with IVI compared to control Spanish individuals. In addition, when data from our study and those from Mills et al. [14] were analyzed together, a marginal significant association of homozygosity for rs12252-C with mild IVI was observed. These data suggest that, at least in populations of European origin, homozygosity for rs12252-C could confer an increased risk for IVI, but not for severe influenza. Since no patients with mild influenza were included in the study of Everitt et al. [9] , their results might also arise as a consequence of the association of rs12252 with susceptibility to, rather than severity of, IVI. It was suggested that IFITM3 plays a pivotal role in limiting the entry and replication of several viruses, including IAV, in humans and mice [9] [10] [11] . However, the impact of the rs12252-C polymorphism in viral restriction in vitro is also conflicting. Everitt et al. [9] reported that the IFITM3 rs12252-C polymorphism, coding for the \u039421 IFITM3 isoform, has reduced influenza virus restriction in vitro.
