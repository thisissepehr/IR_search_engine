DAD has been reported to be the focal pathological finding of AE-IPF [9] . DAD also accounted for many cases of AE-IPF in the present investigation, involving a mixture of pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary thromboembolism and OP. However, DAD was not observed in all cases. In particular, pulmonary hemorrhage was a representative pathological finding in the AE-IPF patients without DAD. Pulmonary hemorrhage is rarely encountered during the course of IPF [20] [21] [22] , and it is difficult to make a premortem diagnosis in actual clinical practice without performing BAL. Nevertheless, careful attention is required in such cases, as the use of BAL in IPF patients may increase the risk of acute exacerbation [23] .

On the other hand, another study reported specific infections in eight patients (14.0%), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in five patients (8.8%) and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia in five patients (8.8%). Moreover, Esteban A. et al. found that, although DAD was observed in 112 of 127 autopsy cases satisfying the diagnostic criteria for ARDS, the following diseases were observed in patients without DAD, in order of descending ). In addition, we found no findings associated with acute fibrinous or organizing pneumonia in the AE-IPF patients without DAD [27] . In these cases, genuine respiratory failure accompanied the progression of pulmonary fibrosis, which may constitute the natural course of IPF. Notably, the results of the present study are supported by the findings of a previous report in which only extensive fibroblastic foci were observed as a pathological finding of an acute pattern [13] . Furthermore, the effects of hypoxic, physical and psychosomatic stress [28] and high-dose corticosteroid therapy [29] must be considered with respect to gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Right ventricular hypertrophy may be caused by pulmonary hypertension [30] at the end stage of AE-IPF. Moreover, the relationship between IPF and pulmonary hypertension is important, and Judge and colleagues recently reported that pulmonary hypertension is associated with acute disease exacerbation as well as poor survival [31] . Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the potential for pulmonary hypertension in patients with IPF.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 344, "end": 348, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 919, "end": 923, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1264, "end": 1268, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1342, "end": 1346, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1384, "end": 1388, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1523, "end": 1527, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1778, "end": 1782, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although there is no established standard therapy for AE-IPF [10] , high-dose corticosteroid therapy [11, 12, 14, [32] [33] [34] and immunosuppressive agents [35, 36] are commonly used in clinical practice. However, a previous study [37] suggested that these drugs increase the rates of infectious complications. In addition to the immunodeficient state caused by corticosteroids and/ or immunosuppressants, the application of intensive antimicrobial treatment following the acute exacerbation of pulmonary infection may have affected the results of the present study. Regardless, similar to recently published data [38] from a study of gene expression profiling of patients with AE-IPF, our data demonstrated that an infectious etiology may not be the main cause of AE-IPF. In fact, all patients underwent treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents, excluding only one patient, with mechanical ventilation carried out in more than half of the AE-IPF patients. Moreover, the pulmonary infections detected in the present study may have affected, at least in part, the occurrence of respiratory failure leading to death, although there were no significant differences in the time interval between the diagnosis of AE-IPF and death based on the presence of infectious disease. Therefore, in addition to the detection of pathological findings based on DAD, AE-IPF eventually causes respiratory failure due to the effects of accompanying infectious diseases, with patients thus exhibiting a variety of histopathological features. The present investigation was carried out among autopsy cases only; therefore, the efficacy of high-dose corticosteroid therapy against AE-IPF cannot be debated based on our results. However, taking into consideration the fact that many patients with diabetes and pneumothorax following acute disease exacerbation underwent high-dose corticosteroid therapy, such therapy should be carefully administered based on the tolerability and efficacy of the treatment in conjunction with multidisciplinary therapies. Physicians should therefore be aware of the appropriate therapeutic strategies when treating patients with complications induced by treatment for AE-IPF. Furthermore, the results of the present study indicate that it is difficult to distinguish acute exacerbation from other disorders, even if the patient meets the diagnostic criteria for AE-IPF.

Second, we did not perform endotracheal aspiration or bronchoalveolar lavage due to the presence of severe hypoxemia in all cases. However, we carefully excluded patients based on the findings of sputum, laboratory and physical examinations.
