Typically, after an asymptomatic period of 7-14 days (range, 3-60 days), the onset of bacteremia is marked by fever and malaise. 2 Patients typically present with influenza-like symptoms and few physical signs. 3 It is estimated that 21 million cases of typhoid fever arise annually worldwide; 90% occur in Asia. 2 In the US, about 500 cases per year are reported, and 75% are associated with foreign travel. 4 There is a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Severe typhoid fever is defined as fever plus delirium, stupor, coma (in Greek, typhus means \"fog\"), or shock and is associated with fatality rates of 44-56%. 5 Many complications of typhoid fever have been described (Table 4) . Although cough is a common symptom, occurring in 11-86% of cases, pulmonary complications of typhoid fever are rare, documented in only 1-6% of cases. 6 Reported pulmonary manifestations include bronchitis, pneumonia, lung abscess, pleural effusion, and empyema, yet sputum cultures are usually negative. 4, 6 Adult respiratory distress syndrome is a very rare complication of typhoid fever, which is surprising, given the bacteremia and endotoxinemia associated with the disease. To our knowledge, only 5 cases are reported in the literature. 7 However, in a report on 5 fatal cases of typhoid fever, features of adult respiratory distress syndrome were dis-covered on autopsy in 3 cases, suggesting that the disorder might be underreported. 8 The standard diagnostic method is blood culture, positive in 60-80% of patients. Bone marrow cultures are more sensitive, with \u054685% of infected patients testing positive. Stool culture sensitivity is about 30%. Serologic testing, the Widal's test, is controversial due to varying sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values in different geographic areas. 9", "cite_spans": [{"start": 277, "end": 278, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 359, "end": 360, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 461, "end": 462, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 557, "end": 558, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 771, "end": 772, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 992, "end": 993, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1146, "end": 1148, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1149, "end": 1150, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1385, "end": 1386, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1584, "end": 1585, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 829, "end": 838, "text": "(Table 4)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "DIAGNOSIS"}, {"text": "Randomized controlled trials indicate that fluoroquinolones are the most effective typhoid fever treatment. 9 In severe typhoid fever, fluoroquinolones should initially be given intravenously, and treatment should last for at least 10 days.
