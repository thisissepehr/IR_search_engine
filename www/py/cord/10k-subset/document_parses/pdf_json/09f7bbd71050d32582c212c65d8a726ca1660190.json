The aim of this study is to prospectively validate ENDING-S in a cohort of long-term critical care patients. Materials and methods: Adult long-term ICU patients (with a length-of-stay> 4 days) were considered for this prospective multicenter observational study.

Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values associated with the previously identified ENDING-S cut-off of 11.5 were 68.1, 72.3, 60 and 89.3%, respectively. ROC-AUC for outcome prediction was 0.79 for ENDING-S and 0.88 for SOFA in this cohort. Conclusions: ENDING-S, while not as accurately as in the pilot study, demonstrated acceptable discrimination properties in identifying long-term ICU patients at very high-risk of dying. ENDING-S may be a useful tool aimed at facilitating a practical integration between palliative, end-of-life and intensive care.",

As example, the usefulness of several scores (e.g. the APACHE score) is mainly validated at the ICU admission, when the patients' responsiveness to intensive care treatments is not clear yet. Other scoring systems (e.g. the SOFA score) are well validated to monitor the organ dysfunctions over time in the ICU; nevertheless, the requirement of biochemical data for the scoring calculation may limit their routine use/daily application [7] . Finally, the requirement for, and to what degree, palliative care should be integrated with intensive care for all ICU patients is often not objectively defined and instead determined by individual physician's perspective [11, 12] .",

Combining this with the fact that an ENDING-S score does not require any laboratory data as the SOFA score does, ENDING-S can be calculated every day, easily, on each patient.

Thus, a prognostic tool only based on SOFA score would not change, failing to alert the physician to the increasing amount of palliative and end-of-life care required for that patient. On the other hand, as ENDING-S is influenced by the progression of days spent in the ICU, it increases over time even in absence of clinical changes.

Interestingly, an objective definition of end-of- For each patient, the higher the ENDING-s or SOFA score, the higher the probability of ICU death, the higher the amount of palliative care interventions (in green) that should be integrated with intensive care treatment (in blue). Palliative care and intensive care should not be mutually exclusive; they should instead integrate each-other during the entire course of the patient's disease from the diagnosis and the initial organ dysfunction to the occurrence of multiorgan failure and end-of-life condition (within the dashed line). An appropriate scoring system should be characterized by a slope in score/ outcome probability able to promote intensive care and palliative care integration continuously, and across different levels of patient's severity life status is still lacking in clinical practice, even for patients who are not hospitalized [8] . For this reason, as in other papers [20, 21] , the outcome observed at the ICU discharge has been used as a surrogate for end-of-life condition for patients both enrolled in the pilot study and for those enrolled in this prospective validation.
