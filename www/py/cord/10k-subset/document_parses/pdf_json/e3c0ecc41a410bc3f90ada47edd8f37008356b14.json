Thus, in the present study, we evaluated the changes in arterial pressure and gene expression of components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and neuroinflammatory markers in the NTS of rats fed a HFD and treated with either an AT1R blocker or with virus-mediated AT2R overexpression in the NTS. Male Holtzman rats (300-320 g) were fed either a standard rat chow diet (SD) or HFD for 6 weeks before commencing the tests. AT1R blockade in the NTS of HFD-fed rats attenuated the increase in arterial pressure and the impairment of reflex bradycardia, whereas AT2R overexpression in the NTS only improved the baroreflex function. The HFD also increased the hypertensive and decreased the protective axis of the RAS and was associated with neuroinflammation within the NTS. The expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme and neuroinflammatory components, but not AT1R, in the NTS was reduced by AT2R overexpression in this site. Based on these data, AT1R and AT2R in the NTS are differentially involved in the cardiovascular changes induced by a HFD.

One of the most important brain areas involved in cardiovascular regulation is the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) [11] [12] [13] , which is located in the dorsal hindbrain. The NTS is the first synaptic site of baroreceptor afferents in the CNS [14] and plays major roles in the impaired baroreflex function and sympathoexcitation associated with hypertension, including obesity-induced hypertension [10, 12, 15] . Angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) is expressed at high levels in the NTS [12, 16] and is a significant contributor to these deleterious effects, as its activation by angiotensin II (ANG II) decreases baroreflex sensitivity [17] . Furthermore, the increase in arterial pressure and reduction in baroreflex sensitivity induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) are associated with increased levels of the AT1R mRNA in the NTS [5] , suggesting that central AT1R might be involved in these responses. Considering that the centrally mediated hypertensive effects of ANG II/ AT1R involve the induction of neuroinflammation [1] , unsurprisingly, an intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of pentoxifylline, an inhibitor of synthesis of the PIC tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF)-\u03b1, or minocycline, an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory effects, attenuates the HFD-induced sensitization of ANG II-elicited hypertension [18] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 377, "end": 381, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 382, "end": 386, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 387, "end": 391, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 508, "end": 512, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 663, "end": 667, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 668, "end": 671, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 672, "end": 675, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 752, "end": 756, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 757, "end": 760, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 902, "end": 906, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1094, "end": 1097, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1287, "end": 1290, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1579, "end": 1583, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The cardiovascular effects of ANG II on the NTS are not restricted to its signaling through AT1R.

In this sense, AT2R overexpression improved the baroreflex function, similar to the observations in our previous study using the renovascular [12] and SHR [13] hypertension models. Furthermore, transduction of AT2R into the NTS increased the levels of Mas receptors and ACE2 expressed at this site in HFD-fed rats. Studies have demonstrated that ANG (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) in the NTS improves baroreflex function and reduces arterial pressure [34] , whereas blockade of ACE2 in the NTS reduces baroreflex function [35] . Since the AT1R and AT2R expressed in the NTS are mostly localized in different neurons, with only a 7% overlap, according to a previous study [19] , the data might suggest that AT1R inhibition and AT2R activation function through different mechanisms/circuits to dampen the cardiovascular system in hypertension. An open question is if the intra-NTS application of an AT2R agonist would improve the baroreflex function in HFD-fed animals. In rats with heart failure displaying a decreased level of AT2R in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), the injection of an AT2R agonist in the RVLM induces a smaller decrease in MAP than in control rats [36] .
