If drug levels are too low it could increase the chance of emerging drug resistance. The main constraints for successful TDM in the field are poor facilities at the study site in combination with storage and transportation issues. Most biological samples have to be kept refrigerated or frozen and disrupting the cooling chain may result in drug degradation [4] . One sampling technique that can overcome these problems is the dried blood spot (DBS) technique. The technique is less invasive than venipuncture and is more cost effective for storage and transportation. DBS samples generally increase stability of the drug compounds and also reduce transmission of infectious disease (e.g., HIV) making them safer to handle for laboratory personnel [5] . The drawback with this method is that the ana lysis of drug concentrations can often be quite complicated and tedious. Introduction of the paper matrix makes it more difficult to extract the drug from blood with high recovery. The sample volume is also small (i.e., typically ~100 \u00b5l) making it more difficult to achieve adequate sensitivity for drugs with low therapeutic concentrations in blood.

The aim of the developed assay is to help determine drug use in these areas and also to be a complement to interviewing patients, which will increase reliability of surveys. Results: This assay detects quinine, mefloquine, sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine, lumefantrine, chloroquine and its metabolite desethylchloroquine in a 100-\u00b5l dried blood spot. Most of the drugs also have long half-lives that make them detectable at least 7 days after administration. The drugs are extracted from the dried blood spot with sequential extraction (due to the big differences in physicochemical properties), solid-phase extraction is used as sample clean-up and separation is performed with gradient-LC with MS ion-trap detection. Conclusion: Detection limits (S/N > 5:1) at 50 ng/ml or better were achieved for all drugs except lumefantrine (200 ng/ml), and thus can be used to determine patient compliance.

A simple extraction step using pure acetonitrile or methanol with either direct injection or injection after evaporation/dissolution would be preferable. Extraction and direct injection was not possible since the paper itself absorbed approximately 200 to 300 \u00b5l of solvent. Approximately 400 \u00b5l of solvent would be required to enable direct injection, which resulted in too much dilution. An additional problem was severe band broadening for the early eluting hydrophilic drugs resulting in very broad and distorted peaks. An alternative was to evaporate the solvent and reconstitute it in an appropriate solvent for LC. However, this approach led to very low recovery for the lipophilic LF probably due to irreversible absorption to blood residues (i.e., proteins) during the evaporation step. Several of the drugs also showed low recovery due to the high (100%) organic content.

Blood residues would adsorb some of the LF during the evaporation step giving random recoveries between 0 and 20%.

Extraction with 20% methanol was the best choice, which also prevented LF from being co-extracted from the spots. Before loading the sample onto the SPE column it had to be diluted to 10% methanol to avoid breakthrough of SDX and elution was accomplished using methanol:triethylamine 97:3. Another advantage with separating LF from the others was that the reconstitution solvent for the other drugs could be limited to only 10% methanol, thereby avoiding band broadening when injected into the LC system.

The use of ion-trap MS with an ESI interface and total ion chromatograms make it possible to extract and identify other common antimalarials and other drugs that might be of interest at a later stage. A very simple extraction method would be optimal but with the huge differences in physicochemical properties it was not possible to achieve this. LF with a detection limit of 200 ng/ml is detectible approximately 1 week after drug treatment and at that drug level it is possible to use LC with UV detection with approximately the same detection limit. However, the possibility to later go back to extract and identify m/z of an unidentified peak as in ion-trap LC-MS is not possible. In the future, it would be desirable to develop a faster and simpler sample preparation technique if possible. Preferably a fast and easy extraction such as extracting the blood spot with solvent, adding internal standard then mixing, centrifuging and carrying out direct ana lysis with HPLC-MS/MS. The possibility of using direct desorption techniques for DBS is interesting [22] [23] [24] [25] , but these techniques will likely be vulnerable to matrix effects due to the lack of proper sample clean-up. Future development of better extraction techniques, more efficient separations and more sensitive mass spectrometers will hopefully pave the way for sensitive high-throughput screening methods.
