Macroscopic and microscopic examination is a common approach to determine changes in tissues, but text descriptions and visual images have limitations for group comparisons. Semiquantitative scoring is a way of transforming qualitative tissue data into numerical data that allow more robust group comparisons. Semiquantitative scoring has broad uses in preclinical and clinical studies for evaluation of tissue lesions. Reproducibility can be improved by constraining bias through appropriate experimental design, randomization of tissues, effective use of multidisciplinary collaborations, and valid masking procedures. Scoring can be applied to tissue lesions (eg, size, distribution, characteristics) and also to tissues through evaluation of staining distribution and intensity. Semiquantitative scores should be validated to demonstrate relevance to biological data and to demonstrate observer reproducibility. Statistical analysis should make use of appropriate tests to give robust confidence in the results and interpretations.

In general, quantitative and semiquantitative approaches can be applied to tissues to produce scores that enhance the rigor of data. \"Quantitative\" scores are derived from measuring tissue parameters often using manual techniques or by using specialized software to analyze digital images 3, 16, 17 and yield a discrete numeric value on a continuous scale (eg, 0.3, 1. 25, 4.5, etc.) . In contrast, \"semiquantitative\" scores are assigned by an observer based on predefined morphologic criteria, 3 and these whole number scores are, by definition, less precise than quantitative scores because they approximate relative changes.

Here, the goal is to evaluate the safety of the material being tested (ie, hazard identification and risk assessment) rather than to assess potential treatment efficacy. To support future clinical trials, all toxicity studies must be performed according to guidance documents from various regulatory agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration. Additionally, the usage of consistent diagnostic terminology for each organ system in rodents and large animals is strongly recommended. 9,21 Collaboration with experienced toxicologists and toxicological pathologists is highly encouraged before investigators plan these types of studies to ensure the current regulatory guidelines are followed.

Due to several factors (genetic diversity, comorbidities, etc.), even small cohorts of humans do not fully \"model\" the human condition. This is, in part, why large and multiple clinical trials are often required to test for efficacy and adverse effects of new therapeutics in humans. In research, studies that model the human condition should be constructed to be as useful and reproducible as possible; one way to do this is to guard against factors that are known to cause bias. In science, bias is a term applied to areas of subjectivity (from overt to subconscious) that can skew data and contribute to lack of scientific reproducibility, an unfortunate reality that has been increasingly recognized.

It can be helpful to revisit proper techniques for tissue collection as well as the different options available for fixation and storage because tissue handling variables can influence staining quality. 3, 4, 27, 30 Staining techniques can also vary in consistency as a function of stain choice and by staining protocol. For example, the planning phase for a hypothetical experiment involving viral-induced inflammation in the lungs of a mouse should address whether there is sufficient tissue for multiple tests (eg, bronchoalveolar lavage, paraffin, and OCT embedded tissues, PCR, microarray, protein quantification, and viral culture). Novice investigators might make several invalid assumptions (eg, homogenous virus distribution in lungs, bronchoalveolar lavage collection does not affect other analyses, murine lung size will allow for ample tissue sampling, etc.) that can lead to incomplete and/or skewed data. 4 Early consultation with all key collaborators (especially pathologists) at the time of experimental design will ensure all needs are accounted for (eg, appropriate amount and type of tissue allocations) to prevent oversights.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 107, "end": 109, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 110, "end": 113, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 114, "end": 118, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 119, "end": 123, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 124, "end": 128, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 129, "end": 133, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 354, "end": 356, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 357, "end": 359, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 873, "end": 875, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 876, "end": 878, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 879, "end": 882, "text": "27,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 883, "end": 885, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1589, "end": 1590, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Experimental Design"}, {"text": "Randomization (\"heterogenization\") is an important tool to prevent the introduction of treatment bias that arises from overly homogenized groups; this situation has been variably coined as litter effect, cage effect, or batch effect.

For example, tissue harvest from a large cohort of animals will likely produce a wide range of times from onset of the experimental day until necropsy. If animal in one treatment group were necropsied early, before starting on the other group, tissue parameters such as liver glycogen stores (especially in fasted animals) could be affected and create artifactual group-specific bias. Randomization of all the groups (animals and their tissues) can mitigate bias introduced by the experimental procedures.

Various biomedical personnel (including principal investigators, postdocs, and even students) have been assigned the role of observer to score tissues. This approach, which lacks the expertise of a board-certified pathologist trained in tissue interpretation, has been labeled as do-ityourself pathology, a practice that has been associated with numerous publications with erroneous interpretations. 4, 30, [36] [37] [38] [39] While observations made by biomedical personnel may be biologically accurate in some cases, it is important to note that tissue examination by nonpathologists (even those who are \"scientific experts\" for a particular disease) is not recommended.

Masking (also known as blinding) is a method to keep the observer from knowing the treatment groups when assigning tissue scores. Experts at every level (even pathologists!) are at risk of having their judgment subliminally influenced by information cues from the study. Masking significantly reduces this possibility. There are several methods to mask observers to the experimental groups, each with advantages and disadvantages that have been previously reviewed. 3, 4, 40 Briefly, comprehensive masking prevents the observer from knowing any details about the study design, treatments, or grouping of samples at initial examination. This approach may seem unbiased and even useful upon first glance, but in reality can easily lead to false negatives and skewed interpretations. An alternative approach to comprehensive masking is group masking. Here, the study design, treatments, and goals are all transparent to the observer; however, the samples are each assigned into de-identified groups, so that the observer does not know which group had specific treatments. A final example is that of postexamination masking. In this approach, full transparency and access are allowed to all study-related information and slides. This is an important step, especially in new or poorly characterized models, to avoid missing subtle or unexpected treatment-related changes. Once the decision is made to score the tissues, the slides are masked to the observer and scores assigned. Masking should be a standard component that is defined in the methodology of all studies that use semiquantitative scoring. For each of these approaches, the observer should evaluate the scores and tissues after scoring in a nonmasked fashion to give confidence in the scoring system and interpretation of the results.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 580, "end": 582, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 583, "end": 585, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 586, "end": 588, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Masking"}, {"text": "One of the major benefits of semiquantitative scoring is the transformation of descriptive (qualitative) observations into numerical data so as to allow statistical group comparisons and enrich data quality. A widely accepted premise for tissue scoring is the exhibition of at least three characteristics: it should be definable, reproducible, and produce meaningful results. 5 In translational studies, scoring is typically performed on tissues to detect treatment group differences. There are 2 major types of tissue changes that are targeted when scoring tissues: lesions and stains (or other labeling techniques). Some studies have used a merged scoring (ie, an average or sum of scores) approach in which multiple parameters are combined to form one final \"composite\" score, but if this approach is used it should have biological relevance. 3, 12, 41 Lesions A tissue lesion can be defined as an observed morphologic change that differs from control or normal tissue architecture.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 376, "end": 377, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 846, "end": 848, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 849, "end": 852, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 853, "end": 855, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods"}, {"text": "Lesions can be scored in many ways, such as size, shape, distribution, presence/absence, etc., depending on the expected disease-specific findings or tissue observations.

Ordinal systems produce hierarchal or progressive numeral scores (also known as \"grades\" or \"tiers\") that are reflective of the extent and/or severity of change. A mock example of this is an ordinal scoring method composed of whole numbers from 0 to 4 representing distribution of tissue necrosis in which 0 is normal, 1 is <25% necrosis, 2 is 25% to 50% necrosis, 3 is 51% to 75% necrosis, and 4 is >75% necrosis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 150, "end": 152, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 153, "end": 155, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 156, "end": 158, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 159, "end": 162, "text": "41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 163, "end": 167, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 168, "end": 172, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 173, "end": 177, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Scoring Methods"}, {"text": "Ordinal scoring systems should follow several key principles for enhanced reproducibility.

Descriptors that are vague and subjective, such as 0 is normal, 1 is mild, 2 is moderate, and 3 is severe, should be avoided or include additional information to clearly discern each level. Score descriptors in an ordinal system can be defined by multiple lesion parameters (eg, inflammation, proliferation, necrosis), but in these situations reproducibility can sometimes be limited. Therefore, separating each lesion parameter into its own ordinal scoring system is often preferred. Third, ordinal scores are inherently discontinuous data that are not normally distributed (bell-shaped) and require nonparametric statistical analyses. Data that are normally distributed should be analyzed with parametric analysis (eg, paired or unpaired t tests). Many statistics software packages include tests for normality for determining whether a given statistical test will be valid for the dataset.
