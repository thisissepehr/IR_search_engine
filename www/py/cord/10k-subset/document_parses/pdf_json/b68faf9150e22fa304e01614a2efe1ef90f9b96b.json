During this period she was examined thoroughly and diagnosed to have chronic idiopathic neutropenia (also known as chronic benign neutropenia). Her iron deficiency was attributed to nutritional factors and she was noncompliant with her oral iron supplements. The patient fully received her iron supplement medication by nursing staff for two and a half months during an unexpected prolonged hospital stay after her suffering an acute ischemic cerebrovascular accident. An astonishing outcome was that in addition to having her iron deficiency anemia treated, her long-term unexplained neutropenia was also corrected.

Neutropenia is a more specific term referring to the abnormal reduction in the number of circulating neutrophils [2] , which is the focus of our case report here. Neutropenia occurs when there is a reduction in the number of produced neutrophils or as a result of their increased destruction, or both. Infection, drugs, malignancy, megaloblastosis, hypersplenism and immune-neutropenia are known causes of leukopenia [3] . The primary threat when dealing with neutropenia lies in the increased risk and severity of infection [4] . and unexplained chronic leukopenia.

The patient was relatively considered compliant to her medications except for her iron treatment where she only received one 100 mg tablet once or twice a week instead of daily. This was attributed to the accompanying side effects which she complained about when receiving the iron treatment. These side effects included bloating, epigastric pain and constipation. The patient refused to receive iron intravenously against medical advice.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "During her 16 year follow up, this patient was consistently found to have unexplained persistent leukopenia. There was no family history of similar conditions and there was no medical history of recurrent infections. She was compliant with taking her daily aspirin pill but had no history of other NSAID use. Her White Blood Cell (WBC) count was continuously in the range of 1,600-3,300 cells/lL (Reference range 4,500-11,000 cells/lL). With over 80 documented separate complete blood count (CBC) tests carried out throughout this 16 year period her WBC was mostly around 2,000 cells/lL. Neutrophil count was typically between 40 and 50 % which is just slightly below average range (52-68 %). Hemoglobin (Hb) level was continually at the lower end of normal, ranging between 9.0 and 12.0 g/dL and never exceeding 12 g/dL (Normal Reference range for females: 12.0-15.0 g/dL). Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was usually found to be between 70 and 85 lm 3 (Reference range 80-100 lm 3 ) and her ferritin level constantly remained below 15 ng/ml (Reference range 20-300 ng/ml). Her platelet count was continuously between 200 9 10 3 and 400 9 10 3 cells/lL (Reference range 150-450 9 10 3 cells/lL). While she was receiving medical attention from our center, she had three documented visits to two different hematologists. After undergoing multiple tests, her leukopenia remained unexplained. Blood film showed microcytic hypochromic anemia with moderate neutropenia. In an effort to better understand the patient's condition, many examinations and laboratory tests were performed always resulting in normal values. The parameters evaluated included blood lead level, vitamin B-12 level, folic acid level, ESR, RF, ANA, Hb electrophoresis, serum creatinine, BUN, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, LDH, ALP, ALT, and AST. An abdominal ultrasound was unremarkable apart from some signs of mild splenomegaly. Since the patient's documented test results demonstrated the same degree of leukopenia for many years without the occurrence of significant infection, it was decided not to do bone marrow biopsy. A form of chronic benign neutropenia (also known as chronic idiopathic neutropenia) was the most likely diagnosis with Feltey's syndrome being a distant possible diagnosis. She underwent two gastroscopies and three colonoscopies throughout this 16 year period with no remarkable findings except for some mild antral gastritis.

She developed mild left sided muscle weakness and dysarthria, and was admitted to hospital for two and a half months. Her hospital stay was prolonged because her condition required daily physiotherapy, and because her swallowing ability was diminished, she was on many occasions fed using a nasogastric (N/G) tube. She received exactly the same previous oral medications through the N/G tube for her entire hospital stay. The only difference was that she was given oral ferrous sulfate 325 mg tablets twice daily for the whole two and a half months inpatient period. This was the first time our patient had ever received a full course of a proper dose of oral iron treatment which was monitored and administered by the hospital inpatient nursing staff.

Neutropenia, defined as having an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 1,500 cells/lL, can be caused by multiple disease processes.

Also, post infectious neutropenia was excluded as a cause because it is by definition transient with a self-limited course contrary to the chronic nature of our case [4, 6] .

This disorder mainly affects middle-aged women with a female: male ratio of 3-6:1 and a median age at diagnosis of 50.5 years. Chronic idiopathic neutropenia usually persists throughout life without major complications [7] . The significant improvement in the Hb level, WBC and ANC (13.7 g/dL, 7,806 cells/lL and 4,212 cells/lL, respectively) after correcting her iron store status lead us to [5] believe that the treatment of the chronic iron deficiency anemia with oral iron supplements also treated her 16 yearlong documented chronic idiopathic neutropenia.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 625, "end": 628, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 799, "end": 802, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although many maladies have been linked to neutropenia, none conclusively link iron deficiency anemia as a cause.
