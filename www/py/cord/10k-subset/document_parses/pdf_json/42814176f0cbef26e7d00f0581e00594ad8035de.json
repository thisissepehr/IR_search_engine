Recent studies found that NMC was rarely performed in Thailand and that most Thai health professionals did not recognize that NMC could reduce the risk of HIV infection and would not want NMC services in their hospitals. This study explored the thoughts and concerns of Thai government health staff regarding the introduction of NMC in government health facilities as a public health measure. Methods: In-depth interviews with physicians, nurses and physician administrators from four different levels of government hospitals in four provinces representing 4 regions of Thailand were conducted after provision of education regarding the benefits and risks of NMC. Interviews were audio recorded and analyzed using Atlas.ti software to develop themes. Results: Six themes emerged from the data of 42 respondents: understanding of the benefits of NMC; risks of NMC; need for a pilot project; need for staff training and hospital readiness; need for parental/family education; and need for public awareness educational campaign. Major concerns included possible medical complications of NMC, infringement of child rights, and lack of understanding from staff and parents. The respondents emphasized the need for a clear policy, proper training of staff, financial and equipment support, and piloting NMC rollout before this measure could be fully implemented. Conclusions: Thai health professionals who took part in this study expressed several concerns if NMC had to be performed in their health care facilities. There is significant preparation that needs to be done before NMC can be introduced in the country.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "It is well established that male circumcision (MC) reduces the risk of female to male transmission of HIV infection. Randomized trials have shown that circumcised men are 50-61% less likely to acquire HIV infection than men who are uncircumcised [1] [2] [3] . MC also reduces the chances that women will contract HIV infection because of the lower probability that their partners are infected [4] . As a onetime intervention, MC does not require consistent adherence to preventive behaviors such as condom use or pill taking. As a result, the World Health Organization recommends that countries include MC as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention strategy [5] . Additional health benefits to men from MC include reduced risk of acquiring genital ulcer disease [6] , herpes simplex virus and human papilloma virus [7] . which is an important risk factor for penile cancer [8] .
