A specific probe was encompassed the conservative region of norovirus and F 0 F 1 -ATPase within chromatophore was constructed as a molecular motor biosensor through the \"\u03b5-subunit antibody-streptomycinbiotin-probe\" system. Norovirus was captured based on probe-RNA specific binding. Our results demonstrated that the Limit of Quantification (LOQ) is 0.005 ng/mL for NV RNA and also demonstrated that this method possesses specificity and none cross-reaction for food borne virus. What's more, the experiment used this method could be accomplished in 1 h. We detected 10 samples by using this method and the results were consistent with RT-PCR results. Overall, based on F 0 F 1 -ATPase molecular motors biosensor system we firstly established a new typed detection method for norovirus detection and demonstrated that this method is sensitive and specific and can be used in the rapid detection for food borne virus.",

Because along with the concentration of molecular motor biosensor increasing, the reaction system has more ATPase, and therefore fluorescence intensity is larger. Based on the principle of maximum differentials between molecular motor and H 2 O, we finally chose 0.0260 mg/mL (60 fold dilution) as the final concentration of Chro NV. Meanwhile, we explored the optimum reaction concentration of virus RNA (Table 2) . We found that the fluorescence values of different concentrations of RNA were all higher than the control (H 2 O), especially 0.7 ng/\u00b5L of NV RNA indicating that the detection of F 0 F 1 -ATPase molecular motor biosensor is effective and the optimum concentration of RNA is 0.7 ng/\u00b5L of NV RNA.",

To this end, we randomly chose 10 known negative/positive samples as test samples to perform molecular motor biosensor detection and the results were compared with the results of RT-PCR detected method (Fig. 4) . As seen the figure, the result of molecular motor detection was similar to the result of RT-PCR indicating that our new assay method can be used for the daily inspection of food-borne noroviruses. Food borne norovirus has seriously threatened food safety in recent years [1, 3] . Generally norovirus in food is found in trace level and only 10 ~ 100 virus units can cause the infection. Considering the large-scale food import-export trade, it requires screening of large number of samples. Thus, it is very necessary to develop an effective, rapid, precise, and sensitive detection method. In this study, we successfully developed an effective detection method for food borne norovirus by using F 0 F 1 -ATPase molecular motors biosensor. We hope that besides providing scientific basis for clinical researches, norovirus detection based on the F 0 F 1 -ATPase biosensor could also provide better solutions for virus detection in import-export food detection. Our method does not need complicated facilities such as PCR amplication, electrophoresis and hybridization follow-up processing, it greatly reduced the risk of contamination [24, 30] . Along with the progress of micromachining technology and nanotechnology, the molecular motor biosensor has been largely applied in the various detection fields [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] .
