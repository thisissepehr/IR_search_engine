Additionally, the influence of baseline patient and transplant characteristics on hematopoietic recovery was evaluated. From January 1994 to March 1996, 47 consecutive adult patients received VUD-BMT. GVHD prophylaxis was cyclosporin A/short course methotrexate/prednisolone, and in four patients additional ATG. Post-transplantation, cohorts of patients received rhG-CSF (5 g/kg/day) (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 22) or no rhG-CSF (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 25) in a non-randomized manner. The patient groups with and without rhG-CSF were rather comparable with respect to baseline patient and transplant characteristics. Median time to neutrophil counts (ANC) \u03fe500/l was 14 days with rhG-CSF vs 16 days without rhG-CSF (P \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.048), to ANC \u03fe1000/l was 15 vs 18 days (P \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.084). Neutrophil recovery was accelerated in patients receiving more than the median MNC dose of 2.54 \u060b 10 8 /kg with a median time to ANC \u03fe1000/l of 13 days vs 19 days (P \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.017). RhG-CSF did not influence platelet recovery and incidence of infectious complications. Incidence of acute GVHD II-IV was 50% with rhG-CSF and 28% without rhG-CSF (P \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.144), but death before acute GVHD II-IV occurred in 9% of patients with and 20% of patients without rhG-CSF. The median follow-up time was 38 and 36 months in patients with and without rhG-CSF, respectively. Survival at 2 years post-transplant was 39% (95% confidence interval (18%, 60%)) in patients with rhG-CSF and 24% (95% confidence interval (7%, 41%)) in patients without rhG-CSF. Administration of rhG-CSF after VUD-BMT may lead to more rapid neutrophil recovery, but did not influence the incidence of infectious complications. Patients receiving rhG-CSF showed a slightly higher incidence of acute GVHD II-IV. Higher numbers of MNC in the marrow graft accelerated hematopoietic engraftment.

The myeloablative therapy is associated with prolonged pancytopenia, which can result in serious morbidity and life-threatening complications due to infections and bleeding. 1, 2 Hematopoietic growth factors (HGF) have been investigated following allogeneic BMT and PBSCT as potential means of decreasing the period of aplasia and thus reducing infectious complications, early toxicity and death rate post-transplant. [3] [4] [5] Initial concerns over potential aggravation of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and increased incidence of relapse in patients treated for myeloid leukemias have not been confirmed.

Thus, no adequate trial concerning the use of G-CSF following VUD-BMT has been performed yet. 4, 5 We now report our experience in 47 consecutive patients treated at a single institution using rhG-CSF (filgrastim) after allogeneic VUD-BMT.

Similar results have been observed in previous trials using GM-CSF after VUD-BMT, demonstrating no increase in mortality or relapse rates in patients receiving GM-CSF compared with the controls. 4, 16, 17 Our analysis was designed to examine the role of rhG-CSF on hematopoietic recovery following VUD-BMT and to discern whether rhG-CSF could have a significant impact on complications associated with the marrow transplant procedure during the critical first 3 months.

No negative side effects were observed, above all no delayed platelet engraftment, and no increased incidence of relapse. Although we observed a nonsignificant trend to clinically relevant acute GVHD II-IV, overall incidence of acute GVHD I-IV, and mortality from acute GVHD were not increased.
