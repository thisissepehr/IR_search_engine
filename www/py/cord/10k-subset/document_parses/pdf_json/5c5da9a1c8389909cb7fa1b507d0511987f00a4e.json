Almost all taxes collected in these countries, as well as international loans granted by the International Monetary Fund under strict conditions, are used to postpone paying off debts acquired in the past in less good times, often under non-democratic and corrupt governments. Debt increases because of abusive interest rates imposed unilaterally by the international financial community.

Approximately US$1.8 trillion of speculative, nonproductive capital is currently in circulation in the world (5) . This capital has no nation and, therefore, no responsibility for people or to countries. The world must control it both nationally and internationally to diminish its pernicious effects, both globally and locally. John Williamson, an economist, coined the expression ''Washington Consensus'' to name the set of recommendations for Latin America regarding economic reforms. These define the conceptual basis of the globalization process as we understand it today. Despite his previous positions Williamson now recognizes, in his recent book, the imperative to control capital flow in the socalled emerging markets (6) .",

Polio, for example, has been found in many distant places following a recent outbreak in African and Middle Eastern countries due to flaws in vaccine coverage. Ongoing epidemics of cholera have affected 75 countries in the last 40 years and produced, over the last 2 years, more than 50 thousand cases and two thousand deaths in Angola alone. Yellow fever reappeared in African countries. We also find new versions of old diseases, such as the drug-resistant tuberculosis. The increase of antibiotic resistance in some microorganisms facilitates their global spread and must be taken into account. I cannot ignore sexual tourism and its consequences. Many developing countries depend economically on international tourism. The globalized tourism industry tolerates the sexual trade of children, adolescents, and adults of both sexes. Certain tourist choose many destinations in the world today for opportunities related to sexual tourism, including Brazil, and many Caribbean, Asian, and African countries.
