Recently, MS-based nucleic acid protocols have migrated out of MS labs for application in other disciplines, including human and microbial forensics, drug discovery, infectious-disease diagnostics, and biological warfare agent detection (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Because the masses of the 4 mononucleotides (dAMP, dTMP, dGMP, and dCMP) comprising DNA are known with great accuracy, highly precise measurements of mass can be used to derive a base composition (or a constrained list of base compositions). By taking into account the base complementarity of double-stranded DNA, investigators can further constrain the list of possible base compositions (11 ) . The \"softness\" of the ionization processes of both matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and electrospray ionization (ESI) has enabled the ionization of PCR products for detection by MS. ESI Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS (ESI-FTICR MS) and ESI time-of-flight MS (ESI-TOF MS) have routinely been used in our laboratory for PCR product analysis, a regular component of a biosensor funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (12 ) . For example, we recently applied this approach to rapidly genotype 217 isolates of Acinetobacter to determine the epidemiology and clonality of outbreaks in soldiers and civilians in Iraq and Kuwait (13 ) . The analytic power of the ESI MS technique is quite general and the technique in principle can be applied to the rapid assay of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mutation in any gene for which disease-causing variants and informative polymorphisms are known.

This capability is illustrated in Fig. 3 . We amplified sample 2 with primer pair tRNA-Phe, split the purified amplicon into 2 aliquots, and analyzed the aliquots by ESI-TOF MS or ESI-FTICR MS. The resulting spectra (Figs. 3A and 3B, respectively) illustrate some of the key differences in performance between the ESI-FTICR and ESI-TOF methods. The most striking difference is the presence of \"fine structure\" in the FTICR spectrum that is absent from the TOF spectrum. The constituent elements comprising the amplicon are not monoisotopic (e.g., 98.1% of the carbon atoms are 12 C, and \u03f31.1% are 13 C); there exists a naturally occurring isotope distribution (to which 14 N/ 15 N and 16 O/ 18 O also contribute). Species containing different numbers of \"light\" and \"heavy\" isotopes differ in molecular mass by \u03f31 atomic mass unit. These small mass differences are resolved by the FTICR method (\u03fe100 000 full width at half maximum resolution; Fig. 3B ) but not by the TOF method (Fig. 3A) . The TOF spectrum reflects only the width of the isotopic envelope, not the individual isotopomers. The centroid of the unresolved isotope envelope in the TOF spectrum can still be used to derive an accurate mass measurement of the analyte, albeit not with the same mass accuracy as the FTICR method. The experimentally determined average molecular masses for the forward and reverse strands of the amplicon were 32 819.94 and 31 932.57 Da, respectively, from the FTICR measurement (Fig. 3B) and 32 819.8 Da and 31 932.6 Da from the TOF measurement (Fig. 3A) . The average massmeasurement errors are 0.8 ppm and 4 ppm for the FTICR and TOF spectra, respectively. In general, mass-measurement errors of \u03fd20 -25 ppm (on both strands) are required to yield an unambiguous base composition. In this example, the correct base composition (A19 G38 C12 T36) is derived from either the FTICR or TOF measurements. The closest base composition in mass (A50 G31 C19 T5) would require a mass-measurement error of \u03fe20 ppm on both strands, and the base composition is inconsistent with and significantly different from all database entries for this primer pair. Because the routinely obtained massmeasurement errors of the FTICR and TOF methods are, conservatively, 5 ppm and 15 ppm, respectively, the correct base composition is unambiguously determined on either platform. It is notable that the sensitivities of the FTICR and TOF platforms are comparable for this application. Given the high signal-to-noise ratios of the spectra in Fig. 3 , this result suggests that shorter acquisition intervals could be used to further enhance the throughput of the system.

In the event that a sample is flagged as possibly having 1 or more characterized mutations, the sample can be further investigated via sequencing. Compared with traditional electrophoresis gel-based methods such as PCR-RFLP, the ESI MS protocol has several advantages: process of direct DNA sequencing. In most cases, knowing that a mutation or SNP is present in a region of interest (even when the exact coordinates of the mutation are not known), and knowing the type of nucleotide substitution (e.g., A3 T) are the key data for discriminating a typical patient sample from a sample with 1 or more abnormalities requiring additional investigation. Moreover, in the relatively rare instance when sequencing is required to determine the exact coordinates of a nucleotide substitution, prescreening by the ESI MS methods allow much smaller regions to be sequenced, because the mass measurement and base-composition analysis provide the approximate location of the SNP. The estimated reagent costs (for primers, polymerase, deoxynucleoside triphosphates, desalting columns, buffers, and so on) for this work in a high-throughput modality are a few dollars per sample, and the time to a preliminary answer is 4 -5 h. In comparison, a PCR-RFLP method typically requires 2 days to analyze a batch of 12 DNA samples for 7 different mtDNA variants, and 24 samples for this variant set requires 4 days. The enzyme digestion and gel electrophoresis steps required by the PCR-RFLP method are not easily automated; these steps thus create a bottleneck that limits the number of samples that can be analyzed simultaneously. ESI MS eliminates this bottleneck and avoids the extra costs of restriction enzymes, agarose gels, and toxic fluorescent dyes. Automated DNA sequencing cannot reliably detect heteroplasmy at levels of \u03fd30% (23 ), and several commercial facilities currently charge \u03f3$20 for single-pass sequencing. Therefore, not only is direct DNA sequencing more expensive than ESI MS, mtDNA sequencing is not reliable for detecting \u03fd30% heteroplasmy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In addition to significantly reducing the equipment costs associated with the ESI-FTICR MS platform, full migration of this assay to the benchtop ESI-TOF MS platform requires significantly less space and little or no MS expertise.
