Two short open reading frames (sORFs) initiated by AUGs 2 and 3 are also present. To understand translational regulation in this system, we systematically mutated AUGs 1-4 and monitored polypeptide synthesis from plasmids and recombinant viruses. This identified sORF2 as a key regulatory element with opposing effects on PB1-F2 and PB1-N40 expression. We propose a model in which AUGs 1-4 are accessed by leaky ribosomal scanning, with sORF2 repressing synthesis of downstream PB1-F2. However, sORF2 also up-regulates PB1-N40 expression, most likely by a reinitiation mechanism that permits skipping of AUG4. Surprisingly, we also found that in contrast to plasmid-driven expression, viruses with improved AUG1 initiation contexts produced less PB1 in infected cells and replicated poorly, producing virions with elevated particle:PFU ratios. Analysis of the genome content of virus particles showed reduced packaging of the mutant segment 2 vRNAs. Overall, we conclude that segment 2 mRNA translation is regulated by a combination of leaky ribosomal scanning and reinitiation, and that the sequences surrounding the PB1 AUG codon are multifunctional, containing overlapping signals for translation initiation and for segmentspecific packaging.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major pathogen, capable of infecting a number of species including humans, birds, swine and horses. Its genome is contained on eight segments of negative sense viral RNA (vRNA), individually complexed with the trimeric viral polymerase (PB2, PB1 and PA) and nucleoprotein (NP) to form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles (1) . On infection, the RNPs migrate to the nucleus where the polymerase initially transcribes the vRNA templates to produce mRNA, and later replicates the genome using positive sense cRNA intermediates (2) . Subsequently, new vRNAs are exported from the nucleus (as RNPs) and packaged into progeny virus particles at the plasma membrane. As each segment encodes at least one essential gene product, a viable virus particle must contain one copy of each segment, which is facilitated via specific cis-acting packaging signals present in the terminal non-coding and coding regions of each vRNA (3) . IAV strains also show considerable variation in pathogenicity, and the molecular mechanisms underlying this have not been fully elucidated. Segment 2 encodes PB1, the core component of the viral polymerase, which has been linked to inter-strain differences in pathogenicity and host range (4, 5) . However, the single mRNA species transcribed from the segment also encodes two further proteins that are non-essential for virus replication: PB1-F2 and PB1-N40 (6, 7) . PB1-F2 is encoded by the+1 open reading frame (ORF) relative to PB1 and is initiated from AUG4 ( Figure 1A ). Depending on virus strain, the PB1-F2 ORF is up to 90 codons long, but in many viruses (including the recent pandemic H1N1 virus, where the gene is effectively absent), is truncated to variable extents by one or more stop codons (8, 9) . PB1-F2 polypeptides of 79 amino acids or longer can localize to mitochondria and the protein has been associated with pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory effects (6, (9) (10) (11) (12) . A proportion of the protein also localizes to the nucleus where it interacts with PB1 and may influence polymerase activity (13, 14) . In some strains of virus, manipulating the expression or sequence of PB1-F2 altered replication and/or pathogenicity, leading to its identification as a virulence factor (6, 10, (14) (15) (16) (17) . However, in many cases, the presence or absence of an intact PB1-F2 ORF had little or no impact on virus replication in vitro or in vivo (7, 8, 17, 18) .

The sequence context of the AUG affects the probability that it will be recognized as a bona fide initiation codon; the Kozak consensus GCC(A/G)CCAUGG, is thought to be optimal, with a purine at \u00c03 and G at +4 exerting the strongest effects (23, 24) . In support of the ribosomal scanning hypothesis, AUG1 is set in a medium strength Kozak consensus, lacking a purine at \u00c03 ( Figure 1A and B), while mutation of AUG4 has been shown to lead to upregulation of N40 translation from AUG5 (7) .

However, there are two intervening start codons in frame 2 between AUG1 and the PB1-F2 ORF that initiate short sORFs with minimal protein coding capacity; eight and two codons respectively ( Figure 1A and B).

Notably, the termination codons for these sORFs are also highly conserved in that although three of the four overlapping PB1 codons in frame 1 are not themselves highly conserved at the RNA level, a stop codon is almost always (>99.9% for both sORF1 and 2) maintained in frame 2 ( Table 2 ). This degree of conservation is suggestive of functional importance, potentially for the regulation of translation of the downstream PB1-F2 and N40 cistrons.

A further set of segment 2 AUG1 variants were produced on the background of the previous mutants in which the upstream residues at positions \u00c01 and \u00c02 were changed to match the canonical Kozak consensus (ACC, CCC, TCC mutants). The initiation context of AUG1 was also weakened by mutating the G at the +4 position to an A (G28A); this change also resulted in a non synonymous D2N change in the predicted PB1 translation product ( Figure 1B and C). Similar approaches were taken to probe the function of AUG2 and 3 in regulating translation. The context of these initiation codons was improved by mutating the +4 nt to G (T32G and C74G respectively, which caused V3G and A17G changes in the PB1 ORF, respectively). Additionally, AUGs 2 and 3 were individually destroyed (T30C and T72C respectively) without altering the PB1 amino acid sequence.

As expected (7) wild-type (WT) PR8 segment 2 expressed both PB1 and N40, with preferential usage of AUG1 ( Figure 2A , lane 1). All changes tested in the \u00c03 to \u00c01 positions relative to AUG1 lead to notable increases in the expression of PB1 (lanes 2-7). Quantification of replicate experiments showed these increases to be at least 2-fold relative to the WT gene ( Figure 2D ). Although this was the predicted outcome when the U at the \u00c03 position was swapped to a purine, a similar effect when it was replaced with another pyrimidine was unexpected (23) . Consistent with a role for leaky scanning in accessing downstream AUGs, a concomitant reduction in N40 levels was observed in all cases ( Figure 2D ). Conversely, weakening the Kozak consensus of AUG1 through replacement of the +4 G nucleotide downregulated PB1 expression, and although the absolute amount of N40 remained similar ( Figure 2A , lane 8, quantification in Figure 2D ), its ratio relative to PB1 was increased 1.7-fold compared to wild-type segment 2. In contrast, mutations affecting AUGs 2 or 3, whether by altering their context (T32G and C74G) or by destroying them (T30C and T72C) had little effect on the ratio of PB1 to N40 ( Figure 2B ; quantification in Figure 2D ). Similarly, increasing the length of sORF2 (A78T+G101T) or fusing it with the PB1-F2 cistron (A78T) did not substantially alter relative use of AUGs 1 and 5. However, loss of the PB1-F2 AUG4 through the T120C mutation increased N40 synthesis from AUG5 by nearly 3-fold ( Figure 2B , lane 8, Figure 2D ). This recapitulated our previous observation for a construct in which AUG4 was mutated and its surrounding Kozak consensus disrupted [\u00c1AUG; (7)]. The small size ($10 kDa) of the PB1-F2 polypeptide made it difficult to visualize directly in IVT reactions. Accordingly, we utilized a set of constructs in which the CAT gene was fused downstream of AUG5 to increase the size of the polypeptide products. Examination of IVT reactions programmed with plasmids containing the CAT gene inserted into WT segment 2 in each of the three reading frames showed the expected set of polypeptides: frame one produced PB1 and PB1-N40 fusion proteins, frame 2 produced a PB1-F2 fusion while frame 3 lacked an obvious polypeptide product ( Figure 2C , lanes 1-3 respectively). The quantity of the frame 2 product synthesized showed partial correlation with the presence and number of upstream AUG codons. For example, improving the Kozak consensus of AUG1 had only a small effect on PB1-F2-CAT synthesis (T22A: Figure 2C , lane 4; quantification in Figure 2D ) and nor was F2 synthesis increased by the G28A mutation that weakened the context of AUG1 ( Figure 2C, lane 5) . Similarly, alteration of AUG2 by the T30C and T32G mutations had little effect (lanes 6 and 7). In contrast, the level of PB1-F2 was up-regulated 2-fold when AUG3 was removed via the T72C change (lane 8). The C74G mutation, predicted to improve the Kozak consensus of AUG3 caused a slight (<2-fold) reduction in F2 expression that was not statistically significant (lane 9). These results suggested that while AUG2 was of little translational significance, AUG3 was recognized well by ribosomes and directly regulated the level of PB1-F2 expression. Supporting this, when sORF2 was fused to the F2 ORF through removal of the intervening stop codon in the +2 frame by the A78T mutation, increased levels of a slightly longer (presumed) fusion protein were seen (lane 10). Thus overall, the data suggested that expression of PB1-F2 and PB1-N40 in vitro could be partially but not wholly explained by leaky ribosomal scanning. AUGs 1, 3 and 4 were clearly functional and exerted a significant influence on use of downstream start codons.

More generally, we wished to compare segment 2 protein expression from recombinant and authentic viral settings. Accordingly, PB1, N40 and PB1-F2 accumulation in MDCK cells infected with the panel of viruses was examined at 8 h post-infection (p.i.) by western blotting. To provide numerical data, the levels of each protein from replicate experiments were quantified and normalized to levels in cells infected with WT PR8.

In agreement, weakening the Kozak consensus of AUG1 (G28A) reduced PB1 accumulation relative to N40 and F2 expression ( Figure 4A , compare lanes 2 and 9; quantification in Figure 4B ). Similarly, mutation of AUG2 had little effect on either the quantity (T30C) or the relative ratios (T32G) of the segment 2 polypeptides ( Figure 4A, lanes 12 and 13) , with the lower levels of all three polypeptides seen with the latter virus being plausibly ascribed to the reduced polymerase activity of the mutant PB1 protein, as NP accumulation was also reduced.

Unlike in vitro however, there was a concomitant (and statistically significant) $2-fold reduction in N40 levels, despite normal PB1 accumulation. This result was not possible to reconcile with a model where leaky ribosomal scanning was the sole contributor to N40 expression, because removal of an upstream ORF should, at worst, leave N40 levels unchanged. Instead, we hypothesized that in vivo, ribosomes terminating at the end of sORF2 are able to reinitiate at AUG5, bypassing AUG4 because of the time taken to reacquire the necessary initiation factors (22) . In the absence of AUG3, more ribosomes initiate at AUG4 due to leaky ribosomal scanning, and so F2 levels increase. However, no ribosomes are available to reinitiate at AUG5, and so N40 levels decline. Supporting this hypothesis, when sORF2 was fused to PB1-F2 (A78T), N40 levels were reduced >2-fold ( Figure 4A, lane 16) . This virus would also be unable to express N40 by reinitiation from sORF2, due to the removal of the stop codon.

Western blotting was performed on cells infected with these viruses, as well as (for comparison) from cells infected with the 'parental' T72C, C74G, A78T and T120C. As before, preventing potential reinitiation from AUG3/sORF2, using either the T72C or A78T mutations in the presence of an intact AUG4 reduced levels of N40 ( Figure 4A , compare lanes 19, 21 and 25), while improving the predicted strength of AUG3 had little effect (lane 23). Also as before, removal of AUG4 (T120C) led to a large increase in N40 levels (lane 20). A very similar outcome was obtained when the Kozak consensus of AUG3 was improved by the C74G mutation (C74G+T120C; lane 24). When AUG3 and 4 were removed concurrently (T72+T120C), synthesis of N40 was increased even further, to $14-fold greater levels than with the WT virus ( Figure 4B lane 22, quantification in Figure 4B ). However, when sORF2 was fused to the F2 ORF in the absence of AUG4, only a small enhancement (on average, 1.4-fold over WT) of N40 synthesis resulted (lane 26).

To test this hypothesis, we introduced mutations that created new strong context AUG codons in each of the three reading frames in this region ( Figure 5A ). To permit the analysis of mutations that were lethal to virus growth and to try and minimize the effects of differing protein stability on polypeptide accumulation, we created sets of chimaeric plasmids containing the 5 0 -end of segment 2 encompassing the PB1-F2 coding sequence followed by a GFP ORF such that either PB1 (frame 1) or PB1-F2 (frame 2) were fused in frame ( Figure 5B ). To validate this system, we first retested the effect of the key mutations affecting sORF2 and AUG4.

N40 synthesis was however unaffected. These effects were specific to the creation of a new AUG codon, since mutation of codon G26 to ATC left expression of PB1-F2 unaltered (lane 6). Similarly, when new AUG codon 'B' was introduced into frame 2 by mutation of PB1 codon T25 to TAT (with the 5 0 -A!T change avoiding the simultaneous introduction of a stop codon in frame 3; Figure 5A ), N40 expression was not significantly altered while F2 accumulation was substantially reduced, partially at the expense of a slightly longer N-terminally extended form (lane 7). Again, the effect was specific to the AUG codon rather than mutation of codon 25 per se, because its mutation to CGT (B ctr) left F2 expression unchanged. N40 expression was also insensitive to the introduction of an AUG codon into frame 3, whereas F2 accumulation was reduced >2-fold (codon 'C'; lane 13). Once again, the paired control mutation had no affect on PB1-F2 synthesis, although unexpectedly, this change increased N40 accumulation (lane 14). Overall therefore, PB1-F2 levels were sensitive to the presence of start codons in all three frames following sORF2, whereas PB1-N40 levels were not significantly affected. These data show a fundamental difference in how AUG codons 4 and 5 are accessed: ribosomes can be diverted away from AUG4 by the insertion of new upstream AUG codons in the 'UTR' following sORF2, but AUG5 is insensitive to this approach.

This was most pronounced for the triple AUG1 mutants, ACC, CCC and TCC, which produced 18, 32 and 47% of the PB1 levels of WT virus respectively. This was in marked contrast to the in vitro translation data, where PB1 levels were increased $2-fold over WT ( Figure 2 ).

When replicate experiments were quantified, the three viruses with potential packaging defects produced <10% of the normal amount of segment 2 vRNA ( Figure 7B ).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 396, "end": 424, "text": "Figure 7A, lanes 2, 5 and 7)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 744, "end": 753, "text": "Figure 7A", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 907, "end": 916, "text": "Figure 7B", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}], "section": "Packaging of mutant segment 2 vRNAs into virus particles"}, {"text": "Although the above data were consistent with reduced delivery of the vRNA by the infecting viruses, we also considered the possibility that the AUG1/2 Kozak mutations perturbed the function of the viral RNA promoter (either the 3 0 -end of vRNA or the 5 0 -end of cRNA). This could lead to a reduction in segment 2 vRNA levels with a potential secondary effect of reducing the quantity available to be packaged into virions. Although the mutations lie well outside of the conserved promoter region, there are precedents for sequence alterations in the non-unique regions of a segment affecting RNA synthesis (30, 43, 44) . To examine this possibility in isolation, the amount of segment 2 produced from RNPs reconstituted by transfection was measured. Wild-type PB2, PB1, PA and NP were transfected into cells with the reverse genetics plasmids encoding the mutant segment 2 vRNAs. The segment 2 plasmids would be transcribed by RNA Polymerase I to produce a negative sense segment 2 transcript that would be encapsidated, transcribed and replicated by the WT RNP proteins. In addition, mutant PB1 protein would be also be expressed from the vRNAs with non synonymous changes to the PB1 gene (G28A, T32G), but the addition of wild-type PB1 would be expected to at least partially compensate for this. Thus this system allowed us to examine viral RNA production from the mutant segments in isolation from potentially confounding issues of segment delivery and PB1 protein function. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, RNA was harvested and primer extension analysis for segment 2 v, m and cRNA was performed. Omitting PB2 from the transfections determined the baseline levels of segment 2 vRNA that were expressed from the pPolI promoter ( Figure 7C , lane 1). In the presence of the full 3PNP complex, the mutant segment 2 constructs were transcribed and replicated to broadly similar extents ( Figure 7C ). When replicate experiments were quantified, the AUG1 mutants and the T32G AUG2 mutant accumulated vRNA to >75% of the WT level, in clear contrast to the >10-fold reductions they exhibited in the context of virus infection ( Figure 7B) . Similarly, all mutants expressed mand cRNA to reasonable levels, with, on average, no change of >2-fold compared to the WT ( Figure 7D ). These data argue against a defect in the promoter sequence of the viral RNA being solely responsible for the reduced levels of viral RNA seen in the context of infection and support instead the hypothesis that mutations around AUG1 not only affect translation initiation of PB1 and downstream cistrons, but also affect genome packaging.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 608, "end": 612, "text": "(30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 613, "end": 616, "text": "43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 617, "end": 620, "text": "44)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1740, "end": 1749, "text": "Figure 7C", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 1896, "end": 1905, "text": "Figure 7C", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 2133, "end": 2143, "text": "Figure 7B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 2271, "end": 2280, "text": "Figure 7D", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}], "section": "Packaging of mutant segment 2 vRNAs into virus particles"}, {"text": "The single known species of segment 2 mRNA produces three proteins: PB1, PB1-F2 and PB1-N40.

Despite representing the only known functionally tri-cistronic influenza virus mRNA, the mechanisms that control protein expression from the segment have not been fully elucidated. Here, we confirm the hypothesis that leaky ribosomal scanning has a role in mediating expression of PB1-F2 and PB1-N40.

PB1 translation occurs via the canonical pathway of eukaryotic translation initiation (22) in which a preinitiation complex consisting of an eIF2aternary complex (eIF2-TC) attached to a 40S ribosomal subunit scans 3 0 -wards from the 5 0 -cap structure, recognizes AUG1 and commences translation after loss of the initiation factors and recruitment of the 60S subunit ( Figure 8A ). The simplest explanation for PB1-F2 expression is that it occurs via leaky ribosomal scanning, in which the preinitiation complex misses the moderate context AUGs 1 and 3 and the poor context AUG2 before initiating translation at the strong context AUG4 ( Figure 8B ). AUG3/sORF2 evidently plays an important role in down-regulating use of AUG4, as its loss through the T72 mutation substantially increased PB1-F2 accumulation, in vitro and in the context of virus infection. In contrast, the presence of AUG3/sORF2 up-regulated N40 expression in infected cells, a finding inconsistent with leaky scanning. Instead, we think this is best explained via leaky ribosomal scanning to bypass AUGs 1 and 2 followed by initiation at AUG3, almost immediate termination at the end of the two codon sORF2 and continued scanning of the 40S ribosomal subunit. The 40S subunit then scans past the strong context AUG4 but has time to reacquire an eIF2-TC before reaching the strong context AUG5 whereupon translation initiation occurs ( Figure 8C ). The distances between the sORF2 stop codon and AUGs 4 and 5 (40 and 63 nt respectively) are consistent with previously characterized instances of reinitiation (22, (45) (46) (47) . In some circumstances, changes in levels of eIF2-TC during conditions of cell stress (as for example when virus infection activates PKR) are known to regulate expression of downstream ORFs accessed via reinitiation strategies (22) . It is therefore interesting to speculate that segment 2 translation might be further regulated during the course of infection. The distance between the extended sORF2 in the A78T mutant and the N40 AUG (39 nt) is similar to that between the normal sORF2 and the PB1-F2 AUG, so we would not rule out the possibility that reinitiation after sORF2 translation also contributes to F2 expression. However, shortening the intercistronic distance between sORF2 and the F2 ORF to 18 nt (a distance predicted to be too short to allow efficient reacquisition of an eIF2-TC) in the A78T+G101T mutant did not significantly reduce F2 accumulation, so we do not think it plays a major role.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 154, "end": 158, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1646, "end": 1650, "text": "(22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1651, "end": 1655, "text": "(45)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1656, "end": 1660, "text": "(46)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1665, "text": "(47)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1894, "end": 1898, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 438, "end": 447, "text": "Figure 8A", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 707, "end": 716, "text": "Figure 8B", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1474, "end": 1483, "text": "Figure 8C", "ref_id": null}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Another major conclusion from this study is that the 5 0 -end of segment 2 mRNA itself has a number of overlapping functions.

Examining the sequence of the 5 0 -end of segment 2 (in mRNA sense) using the criterion of reporting sequences that are conserved in >95% of the available isolates makes it evident that the primary selection pressure acting on the region is PB1 function (50) . By this admittedly simple measure, only two amino acid residues (positions 12 and 14) are not conserved, in obvious contrast to PB1-F2 or sORF1 and sORF2. At the nucleotide level, as previously noted (50) , it is clear that the majority of sequence polymorphisms are found at the third base position of the PB1 gene ( Figure 9 ). Consistent with this, experimental evidence shows that the majority of the 14 N-terminal amino acids as well as (where tested) Figure 8 . Model for translation of segment 2 polypeptides. PB1 translation occurs by canonical initiation at the first AUG. The majority of PB1-F2 translation occurs via leaky scanning to bypass AUGs 1-3.

AUG4 is presumably conserved at least in part to allow expression of PB1-F2, although it is less obvious what maintains it in the large number of viruses (9,57) that do not possess an intact F2 ORF. It does not seem to contribute to a packaging signal, so one possibility is that it is retained as a 'ribosome sink' to prevent overexpression of N40. AUG3 and the stop codon for sORF2 also seem likely to be conserved for a regulatory role: depressing PB1-F2 synthesis and/or permitting N40 expression. Since neither PB1-F2 or PB1-N40 is required for virus replication in cell culture, elucidating which (if either) of these roles is more important for maintaining virus fitness (as well as the wider question of their function in virus pathogenicity) will require either animal experiments and/or more sophisticated model systems for virus replication in vitro.
