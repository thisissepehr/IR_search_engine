In this sense, the standard deviation of the generation time arising from simulating the model with a time-step of 1 day may be closer to the actual one than the standard deviation obtained under the assumption of exponential distributions (see Table S1 ).

S4), we found that the pandemic spreads in an heterogeneous way (see the different peak times for England regions reported in Fig. S5 ). However, at the end of the epidemic the final attack rate by region is very homogenous (see Fig. S6 ). Indeed, the pandemic is capable to reach all regions because of the combination of contacts in the general community and because of commuting from the place of residence to school. This is further supported by the analysis of models M2-M4. In fact, slight variations in the transmission distance are observed when all sources of infections are considered (Fig. S4b) , suggesting a larger importance of school transmission later on in the epidemic (see also the fraction of cases by setting reported in Tab. S5), when the infection started to reach a larger geographical area. On the other hand, the estimated transmission distance in 'other settings' does not remarkably change over time according to models M2-M4 (Fig. S4a) . Another factor contributing to the homogenous final attack rate by region is the increased transmission rate in 'other settings' during the summer school closure, which both contributed to keep influenza circulating and increased the chance of generating secondary infections outside the network of close contacts of household members and schoolmates.
