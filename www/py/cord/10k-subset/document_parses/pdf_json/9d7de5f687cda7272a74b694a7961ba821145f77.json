Templates, designed through expert agreement, are valuable and feasible, but they need to be updated on a regular basis due to developments in available equipment and treatment options. In 2011, a consensus-based template documenting and reporting data in p-EMS was published. We aimed to revise and update the template for documenting and reporting in p-EMS. Methods: A Delphi method was applied to achieve a consensus from a panel of selected European experts. The experts were blinded to each other until a consensus was reached, and all responses were anonymized. The experts were asked to propose variables within five predefined sections. There was also an optional sixth section for variables that did not fit into the pre-defined sections. Experts were asked to review and rate all variables from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree) based on relevance, and consensus was defined as variables rated \u22654 by more than 70% of the experts.",

Pre-hospital physicians have the potential to restore adequate flow and physiology in severely sick or injured patients, but the subject remains debated [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . P-EMS are resource demanding compared with standard paramedic-staffed services [7] , and more research is needed to evaluate any potential effects of p-EMS [1, 8, 9] . High-quality research relies on data quality and uniform documentation is essential to ensure reliable and valid data. Currently, p-EMS data are low quality, and the lack of systematic documentation complicates comparison, creating a barrier for high-quality outcome research [10] .",

Further, automated data capture from monitors are increasingly available, enabling continuous measurement of physiological variables. Continuous reporting may capture dynamic changes in patient state, thereby increasing the precision of p-EMS research. Pain is frequent in the p-EMS patient population, and pain relief is considered good clinical practice [33] .

To capture these important trends, templates need to be updated regularly. Additionally, the variables shown to be not feasible to document should either be changed or removed. Physiological variables are often reported to be the most often missing variables [38, 39] . In the original template we found the feasibility of collecting physiological data to be good [16] , and these variables were not substantially changed in the updated template. Thus, we expect feasibility to be good for physiological variables in the updated template as well.",

Automated data capture from monitors and updated digitized data catchment tools could allow for complete template data to be imported directly into a common registry. This would provide a substantial opportunity for joint research. If such a registry could also link template data to outcomes and standardized coding systems for process and outcome issues, we may be able to assess e.g. for which patients p-EMS are useful, which procedures should be performed out-of-hospital and which procedures should not. However, the ethical and legal requirements of data sharing for research purposes (e.g. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)) must be taken into account and a substantial work to adhere to the current regulations are needed to succeed.",

However, we managed to recruit a representative cohort of p-EMS physicians representing a broad range of European p-EMS.
