            "text": "The study of complex systems (such as techno-social, economic, and environmental systems) must take into account their sometimes counter-intuitive behaviors, which implies that linear, conventional, and straight-forward modeling attempts will usually be inappropriate. More advanced models (e.g. non-linear models with many heterogeneous interacting elements) require more data to calibrate them, or to discover them with a data-driven approach. It is obvious that this task requires new computational approaches and the availability of large dataset of techno-socio-economicenvironmental systems. In the social and economic sciences, data mining approaches have been largely lacking the past. This has to change in the future, if we want to find better answers, how to address problems such as financial instabilities and social conficts (see Sec. 6 for further examples). Fortunately, in the foreseeable future, scientists will have at hand the volume and production rate of data needed to perform meaningful analyses and even predictions. Back in 1890, at the Harvard Astronomical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, large data-mining activities (for that time) were still manually executed, who were scanning thousands of photographic glass plates with the only aid of magnifying the glasses [98] . Today, the scenario has dramatically changed. The pervasive proliferation of small-and medium-sized computing devices into modern society, and the steady influx of more people into the world's middle classes during the last 20 years have enormously increased the total number of persons leaving, producing and handling data every day. Nowadays, people have great demand for knowledge and information, while information overload is becoming a serious problem. This has pushed the overall information production far beyond the available storage capacities (see Fig. 1 ). Ironically enough, even if they were able to store all the information currently being produced, latency and bandwidth would become the new bottlenecks that would most likely prevent us to read what has been stored [83] .",

Despite the substantial contributions that complexity science can make (and has already made) in this connection, many of its implications have remained largely theoretical so far. This is basically due to the lack of data, the lack of computational power, and the lack of computationally tested institutional designs in the past. This White Paper will primarily address, how the data gap may be closed, while the EU project Visioneer [1] will also produce two further White Papers addressing the other two issues. We expect that ground-breaking ICT research, in intense collaboration with multiple other scientific disciplines, will in future be able to identify the success factors of societies and to better address the grand challenges of humanity.",

This includes lab experiments [17, [62] [63] [64] [65] , Web experiments [18] , or the study of massive multi-player on-line games [19] [20] [21] 164] . Moreover, some new technologies have created an abundance of new data, allowing analyses with a previously unseen spatial and/or temporal resolution, and also an analysis of the effects of the social environment or the social interaction network, etc. [22-25, 105, 106] . New terms such \"Information Cornucopia\", \"Data Deluge\" [73] or \"Information Bonanza\" [74] have been coined to refer to the enormous amount of information produced by all these sources (1200 exabytes 1 this year, only 150 exabytes in 2005).",

Similarly, Google flu trends has been able to estimate epidemic spreading from search requests [111] . Furthermore, the \"wisdom of crowds\" effect [16] is more and more used by crowd sourcing approaches [26] [27] [28] such as prediction markets to estimate future economic developments, outcomes of elections, fashions, and socio-economic trends [29, 30] . These areas are now becoming an own business branch, complementing classical consultancy, offering services like: real-time measurement of actual user activity, identification of trendsetters, opinion leaders, and innovators in social networks, trend prediction, trend tracking, etc. [197, 198] . They fit well with other Internet-based applications such as eBusiness [31, 32] or eGovernance [33, 34] , for example.

In Europe, Great Britain is already undertaking first steps along the above lines. In fact, in the \"Big Society Declaration\" [75] , the UK government stated its intention to implement a people's \"right to data so that government-held datasets can be requested and used by the public, and then published on a regular basis.\" This ambitious promise is supported by continuous upgrades and improvements of the UK government data Web site [174] . With the mission to unlock innovation, the British -An increasing number of applications is calling for a close integration of on-line and offline processing of data (e.g., process monitoring and control, algorithmic trading, real-time data warehousing, and others). -The wide heterogeneity of data representations makes any form of integrated processing extremely hard. -It is less and less clear what is valuable information and what is junk. The relevance of the content could even change over time, as socio-economic or environmental conditions change. -More and more often, dataset or data collections contain personal and sensitive information. These challenges require scientific breakthroughs, as will be addressed in more detail throughout this White Paper. However, it becomes visible already that, with an approach employing massive data-mining, science can be pushed towards a new methodological paradigm, which transcends \"the boundaries between theory and experiments\" [94] . In fact, while expert knowledge will still be needed to judge how meaningful a certain model is, starting from empirical data it may become possible to construct scientific models in a semi-automated way (see [2] ). This development is already progressing in meteorology, epidemiology, and systems biology, and soon a data-driven approach will be also possible in the socio-economic sciences. This would require an ICT system capable of combining various facts, logical reasoning, and of assessing the relevance of outcomes. Such a system would not only have to include the state-of-the-art modelling techniques. It would also have to be able to systematically study implications of different possible interpretations of the data. Furthermore, it should also be able to determine the reliability of the respective conclusions, considering the statistical validity of the underlying models in order to estimate the likelihood that certain scenarios would happen.",

However, there are actually a number of stylized facts, as the following list indicates: We do not want to imply here that the above \"laws\" would always be true, but still they are quite useful to understand certain behaviors of socio-economic systems. Moreover, it should be pointed out that there are many more recurrent observations that would qualify as stylized facts, i.e. abstracted, generalized, simplified, or idealized features that are characteristic for certain aspects of social or economic systems. A confusing feature of social and economic systems is the fact that some characteristics are true under certain circumstances, but other, often incompatible or contradictory characteristics apply under other circumstances. This can be caused by parameter-and/or history-dependencies of the behavior of social and economic systems (or complex systems in general). Some of this confusion can be probably resolved by representing such dependencies through phase diagrams, considering the possibility of multi-stability [5] . This, however, requires an accurate description not only of the different types of behaviors observed in social and economic systems, but also of the conditions under which they occur. We anticipate that massive data mining can lead here to a substantial advances and breakthroughs.",

There is a growing literature supporting this perception. For example, Banko and Brill [85] have shown that, given a sufficiently large amount of training data, the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms eventually converge. Another paper by three Google researchers [86] argues that the \"biggest success in natural-language-related machine learning have been statistical speech recognition and statistical machine translation\", just because \"large training set of the input-output behavior [. . . ] were already available in the wild \". Brant et al. [87] even demonstrated how, in natural language models, a worse technique called \"stupid backoff\" could outperform the state-of-the-art approach, if opportunely trained on a large enough datasets (two trillion words). This is, because we have such large data sets today that traditional algorithms are no longer efficient enough for mining and analysing [93] . Sophisticated and computationally expensive models can simply not cope anymore with the web-scale amount of data.",

Most algorithms deliver numerical results under a wide range of conditions, even when their applicability is not given or questionable. Typical problems of data mining are 1. (mis-)interpreting correlations as causal relationships, 2. collinearity of variables, leading to non-unique parameter fits and more or less arbitrary parameter choices, 3. underfitting or overfitting of mathematical models, 4. ignorance of underlying simplifications or critical approximations. In fact, a large fraction of statistical conclusions are scientifically invalid [50] . 5. Large amounts of data (BigData) can produce the illusion of control over complex systems. This is quite dangerous and probably what happened during the recent financial crisis. Banks and rating agencies were feeding their models with enormous amounts of data, but the upcoming crisis was not noticed, as the models did not reflect reality well enough. This was maybe \"the first crisis to be sparked by big data\" [134] . -Information pollution: Usually, there is no guarantee that data in the Internet would be in any way reliable. In fact, many comments and blogs have a relatively low quality, and co-creation platforms such as Wikipedia have to cope with a considerable level of manipulation attempts and \"vandalism\". Rumors about other people and companies may be placed to promote self-interest (e.g. pursue marketing strategies), and the reliability of their contents is often questionable. Viral marketing strategies make it even more difficult to distinguish facts from fake. It is also known that some users try to manipulate page ranks and reputation values by using multiple identities, robots and other tricks. Further problems result, as the Web is dominated by a majority of \"time-rich\", rather than experts. For example, more and more users upload contents to the Web, most of which are not the results of specialized skills. Some contents may even be intentionally misleading. Therefore, the quality and representativeness of data on the Web is a problem, and \"information pollution\" is an issue that will have to be addressed by future data mining attempts. Another problem is the herding effect (and the related multiplication of certain kinds of information), which easily occurs in information-rich environments due to a lack of overview and a desire to find hints for orientation.",

In one setup, they decided several times without any information feedback, in another setting, they were informed about the estimates of the others. In the first round, the variation of answers was high, but the correct answer was always within the range of answers and was usually well approximated by the geometric mean value of all estimates. When information feedback was provided, the answers converged over time, which may be taken as sign that the right answer was identified. Instead, however, it often happened that the relevant spectrum of answers did not contain the correct answer anymore.

Conformism implies a danger of discrimination (for having a certain religious belief, age, gender, disease, sexual preference, etc.; it is not without reason that Americans apply for jobs without a birth date and without a photograph). It is well-known that minorities need protection. One must be aware that it is usually minorities who create the concepts and life-styles of tomorrow, and that it is hard to say in advance, which ones will it be. The minority behavior that eventually wins a majority largely depends on environmental changes and historical developments. A society, therefore, needs to have a pool of minorities to successfully adapt to the challenges and opportunities of the future. Minorities are an indispensable ingredient in the process for evolutionary innovation [82, 124] . 3. The majority behavior of today may be a minority behavior of tomorrow. What is normal today may be perceived as abnormal tomorrow. For example, it is hard to predict how we will think in the future about the appropriateness of certain kinds of food we eat or the environmental and labor conditions under which goods that we buy are produced. Hence, nobody can be that sure his or her current behavior would be considered proper in the future. Social norms are continuously changing [9] . For example, in the 60ies, the values of society were changing dramatically, and the establishment got under enormous pressure. There are many other examples, such as racial segregation, which was considered \"normal\" by many people in the past, but is seen in a totally different way today. 4. Private data could be misused by companies. For example, insurance companies have an interest to offer cheap contracts to the majority of people and to charge minorities for special risks (e.g. inborn or past health risks, or higher hospital costs of women giving birth to children). This, however, clearly undermines solidarity. 5. Publicly available data could be misused also for criminal purposes. For example, the city of Oakland releases information on where and when arrests are made, which is later on displayed on a private Web site [180] . From that Web Site, it was possible for criminals to infer the police tactics, patrolling times and other valuable information [134] . 6. Companies start charging money to people who want certain private information to be deleted [165] [166] [167] [168] 183] . A recent newspaper article even predicts that privacy in future will be a privilege of the rich [12]. 7. Disclosing the wealth of people explicitly or implicitly (e.g. through Street View services) can endanger individuals and increases the chance that they may become victims of crime. Therefore, being rich may become less rewarding, and all the private initiative, innovation and commitment leading to it as well. 8. Generally, people with professions that require them to take unpopular decisions sometimes (such as judges, policemen, or teachers) need a certain degree of protection of their private sphere. Otherwise, they will not be able to exercise their job seriously anymore and end up doing what pleases those they have to judge.",

In the past, after a reasonable punishment, depending on the gravity of the misconduct, the policy of societies was to forget about them. In the worst case, delinquents could still emigrate to other countries, where nobody knew them, paying with the abandoning of their hometown a high price for getting a second chance. Now, however, wherever one may go, the digital traces left behind will follow him or her. This is not necessarily bad, but it certainly requires a savvier society that is able to remember and forgive at the same time. As Thomas Szasz said \"The stupid neither forgive nor forget; the naive forgive and forget; the wise forgive but do not forget.\" Without an adequate mix of tolerance and solidarity, the ability of a society to (re-)integrate people could be seriously undermined. Outcasts would only have a chance to find friends among other outcasts. As a consequence, this would fragment society into a variety of subsocieties -a tendency, which can be observed already. 10. Whenever a huge amount of personal information is available, individuals, private businesses or public institutions may try to infer individuals behaviors, preferences and attitudes and to classify them according to certain profiles. This tendency is as strong as dangerous, since there is no such thing as an accurate classification. Moreover, in the presence of information asymmetries, which are extremely common in everyday life (such as market exchange, buyer/seller interactions, insurance contracts, bank operations, job interviews, etc.), an inappropriate or wrong classification may be hard to correct or oppose to. Moreover, it may affect the lives of people in manifold and unexpected ways, given the high degree of interconnectedness of different services. In the worst case, it can even drive people through no fault of one's own into circuli vitiosi, from which they cannot escape. For example, missing the repayment of the leasing of the car once could mark somebody as \"insolvent\" to the system. This label would prevent this person from getting future loans, which he or she would need in case of temporarily financial reverse. However, it could lead to even more paradoxical situations. For example, by skipping one installment, the system would automatically register the fact \"interruption of contract\", and tag one's profile with a negative label. Ironically, the real motivation behind the fact \"interruption of contract\" could even be that the whole amount of money due was paid at once, without waiting until the contract expired. The above example is real, and wrong classifications like these are already happening. But that is not yet the worst possible scenario imaginable. In fact, we must be aware that any form of classification introduces elements for discrimination, because the \"labels\" are often not fitting and not mutually agreed on [126] . Classifications (be they justified or not) create peer groups and may seriously undermine the basis of cooperation and shared norms in our society. They may also cause unnecessary conflicts [127] . 11. As it becomes possible to learn quickly what kind of people we are interacting with and what they do and think, this will undermine an independent judgement of their qualities (and weaknesses). Rather than giving everybody a fair chance to find the right kind of friends, people might be put into a certain \"box\" and socially excluded. It is known that people need to be protected from intolerance, mobbing, blackmailing and bribery. To live in peace, people often choose to segregate themselves from others. Given the availability of a lot of personal information to everyone, however, the Internet does not allow this anymore. In this connection, it is important to note that undermining the mechanism of voluntary segregation can seriously affect the cooperation among people, to the disadvantage of everybody [128, 129] .",

Such a situation, however, would potentially generate a lot more conflicts than we have today. 13. It must also be noted that having more information freely available does not necessarily lead to a more transparent, fairer or better society. In an informationrich environment, people spend only a short time on a certain subject, and it easily happens that people get a wrong impression and form unjustified prejudices based on such a pars pro toto approach (assuming that the first or a randomly picked piece of information would be representative for the full information). Therefore, large amounts of information can promote misjudgements of somebody's behavior by the press and by the public opinion [135] . Such reputational effects are difficult to correct, particularly as rectifications (e.g. when a suspect in a crime case has been found innocent) are often poorly noticed. This may have a serious impacts on individual lives. 14. When everybody has the same information at the same time (and at negligible costs), this may have negative feedback effects such as herding effects. A typical example is the information about a traffic jam, which is provided to everybody via the public news. One can easily imagine that this leads to over-reactions of drivers to the news and, thereby, to overcrowded alternative roads, while the originally congested route may become underutilized. A possible solution of this problem is to provide user-specific information according to probabilistic rules [61] or to overlay randomness to the information signal [13] . 15. Systems where a high degree of transparency has already been implemented for years have shown to become more sensitive to sudden regime shifts. Examples are market hysteria and volatility clustering phenomena, which can cause failure avalanches. In some cases, transparency on the producer side can also facilitate the establishment of tacit collusive practises, as it has been found in on-line markets, auctions, and laboratory experiments [116] [117] [118] . 16 . Decisions to reveal private information may even spread in an \"epidemic\" way.",

In other words, revealing ones own data can have an impact on other people who did not like to do so, but who are eventually forced to provide private information in order to maintain the same contract conditions and the same price they had to pay before. This also applies to private health insurances, for example. 17. The data on the servers of certain Internet companies probably know more about us than our friends and partner, and maybe even better than ourselves. However, when knowing the preferences of customers, companies may try to manipulate their choices, and possibilities to do so may increase with personalized recommendations (special offers may even have addictive effects). As it becomes possible to shape the customers expectations, this is likely to decrease the willingness of producers to tailor products and services to the needs that customers really have. In fact, due to the \"economies of scale\", businesses have a natural interest in providing a number of standard products. 18. Going one step further, knowledge of the private preferences of individuals may be misused for targeted manipulation and exploitation, which can finally result in a breakdown of trust into commercial offers and services. One must be aware that both, the financial and commercial system of today are largely dependent on trust, and that damaging trust can seriously undermine the basis of future business and its related profits.",

It requires the mechanism of individualization, i.e. the desire to be different from others. Therefore, technologies or circumstances promoting conformism may seriously endanger the basis of democracies. In fact, the danger to suppress minority opinions and preferences increases as large datasets containing private information are centrally stored, and as it becomes possible connect different kinds of datasets.

It would be surprising, if organized crime would not try to get access to Google's data. One of the few laws of social systems, which have been confirmed again and again is: \"Anything that can go wrong ... generally does go wrong sooner or later,\" This is concerning, as today's information systems probably would give someone the power to damage today's pluralistic societies, if he or she really wanted. After all, the Internet contains more sensitive information and about a larger number people than secret services of totalitarian states ever had. In addition, experience tells us that no database is absolutely safe. In 2009, for example, several large sensitive datasets have been stolen from public institutions in Great Britain, where they should have been well protected [130] . 20. Another important point to consider is that the public and private sphere are two sides of the same coin. Interestingly, public order cannot florish without the protection of privacy. Not only is privacy needed to provide personal freedoms as a compensation for the everyday submission to social norms in public life. Privacy is a valve for psychological pressure relief. Without private freedoms, everybody's thousandfold submission to a large number of rules and regulations of public life would be unbearable for many people, triggering rebellion sooner or later. The more rules people are asked to conform with, the more personal freedoms are needed to compensate for this. Finally, unveiling private life also means unveiling how many times people actually violate social norms. Recent scientific studies have shown that such knowledge undermines social norms and consequently leads to an erosion of social order [136] . One prominent example is the sexual revolution in the 60ies, which was triggered by the publication of scientific studies revealing people's private sexual behavior [137, 138] . Therefore, the storage and processing of large datasets of socio-economic activities is a very sensitive issue. They certainly have the potential to harm pluralistic societies. The interests of individuals (such as privacy) and companies (such as details of their business) must be protected. Therefore, it is necessary to address cyber risks and ethical issues by scientific, legal and technological means. The following sections provide guidelines, how this could be done.",

In principle, any decision can be considered as informed consent if it has been taken after being provided with the amount of information that a reasonable and prudent person would want to know [53]. In the Internet this is seldom the case. In fact, it is both possible and relatively common for individuals to access Web sites without reading the terms and conditions (which may be several dozen pages long). It it also unlikely that most people would understand the full contract, while they actually have to approve this. Moreover, they are usually not given any options rather than accepting the conditions in order to get the requested service or rejecting them at the cost of no service, which does not give users a reasonable choice. Under these circumstances, people may nominally give consent, but without being fully aware of or agreeing with the terms and conditions. Such a situation would not be considered as informed consent [149] . This contravenes a widely accepted principle in Social Science Ethics that states that \"as far as possible, participation in sociological research should be based on the freely given informed consent of those studied \" [146, 147] . Moreover, fully informing the respondents it is not yet enough, since researchers should endeavour to make sure that the participants of an experiment have fully understood risks and consequences [53] . This applies in particular for physically or mentally challenged individuals [52, 146] , but cannot be ensured in the Internet [149] .",

Data mining techniques improve every day, while regulations and control over the gathered data are lacking far behind. For example, tracking the source of collected information-once it is stored in secured and not publicly accessible databases-is virtually impossible; knowing who has access to which kind of personal data is also not possible today. Relevant to this discussion and particularly controversial is the latest case of Street View cars. For several months, these cars have been storing personal data, including passwords, credit card information and accessed email contents, which were intercepted from private WiFi networks. The incident was reported as result of a programming error, but others have suggested that this was rather a case of WiFi sniffing, as there exists a software patent which involves intercepting data and analyzing the timing of transmission as part of the method for pinpointing user locations.

Newer browsers such as Safari and Chrome were even more affected, with 82% and 94% of vulnerable users [140] . Unfortunately, there is yet another privacy issue related to recent generations Web browsers: their inherently high customization capabilities have made them unique, and therefore trackable. In fact, even disabling cookies, and blocking history stealing-like exploits, individual Web surfing can still be reconstructed by simply following the customized \"fingerprint\", which the browser is carrying around from site to site. This fingerprint is actually made up by all the configuration information that the browser is exposing to remote Web sites.

For example, such a company could be sold or merged with another one, or simply, the data could be sold, based on a change in the data handling policies. Users are typically not notified of such changes, and they usually have no effective possibility to draw back their data and their consent to use them. Some social network Web pages are examples for this. In fact, because of the continuous updating and modification of the terms of use [151] , the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) has filed a formal complaint at the US Federal Trade Commission [152] , and more lately US senator Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) has petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to request that the agency addresses the issue of social network privacy policies [150] . Moreover, some national data protection commissioners have publicly warned of using certain social network sites [160, 161] . Just recently, the vulnerability of these services has been demonstrated by someone, who downloaded 100 million user profiles and made them publicly available for download [71] .",

Such methods were based on collaborative filtering [154] and enabled an efficient and highly reliable characterization of a person from a few data.

Participants of these Web services intentionally make their data available to everybody, and they can be analyzed in any possible way. The only concern from a statistical point of view is that the set of people participating in these Web2.0 activities is not representative for the whole population, i.e. one would need to make complementary analyses in order to learn, how it is possible to correct for biases in these data. Typically, participants are younger than average and are not concerned to share their data because they lead pretty much \"average lives\". Further data can, in principle, be analyzed by crawling the Web. The data out there are usually traces of, for example, shopping activities at eBusiness platforms or social networking activities. They are accessible to everybody in small numbers, and it is not clear whether and how much people would care about a company or person analyzing these data in large amounts, as they can be gathered by automated programs such as \"spiders\". There are certainly problematic applications of this kind, in particular when the resulting datasets are used to do business, although the data were not intended for this, or if they are sold to third parties with unknown intentions.",

For example, while people may usually object to provide their data, it is likely that the participation rate increases in special situations such as crises, where people tend to change their priorities and make a contribution. However, it is fundamental that the gathered data will be used only for the purpose people have explicitly given consent to. With the project \"Gaydar\" [213] , the MIT demonstrated how easy it is to filter out from publicly available data sensitive personal information, which may be misused. This study predicted the sexual orientation of Facebook users by analyzing the publicly accessible pictures of their friends. Such studies suggest that the processing of data should be allowed only for a certain time period and for the purpose they have been provided, requiring that users have adhered to an explicit, fair, and informed opt-in procedure. For sensitive data-mining activities it would be appropriate to apply the standards followed in clinical studies today.

Nevertheless, there are still a number of open problems, and many approaches are standing next to each other, lacking user-friendliness, integration, and a consequent systemic approach. Problems occur in particular when datasets contain a list of many different features, and some combinations of features are rare. As a consequence, such data must be sufficiently coarse-grained and/or randomized to make sure that combinations of features occur in sufficiently large numbers and cannot be individually resolved. Furthermore, it must be avoided to save lists with many features in one single dataset. It is safer to store them separately on different computers and to access the separate datasets only with programs, which are guaranteed to determine coarse-grained properties only such as (sufficiently rough) statistical distributions. The resulting derivative datasets should be comparatively small and unspecific, or they should be surrogate datasets, in which the relevant statistical properties are the same, but the underlying individuals (persons, companies, etc.) are randomly reshuffled and not identifiable anymore.",

For example, data are made anonymous with respect to a certified trustable anonymity notion, which essentially guarantees that the probability of tracing back any data to the identity of the person to whom the data originally belongs is so low that it can be considered null in practice.

This may also be done by real-time data-mining (\"reality mining\") approaches, if they are suitably designed. For example, to determine congestion on a freeway, it is possible to analyze mobile phone usage data, but it is not at all necessary to know who is calling whom and what is the content. The same applies to GPS localization information of mobile phones, if the distribution of people is determined for the sake of an efficient evacuation. It is just necessary to make sure that any potentially sensitive data (such as the underlying phone number) is thrown away before the statistical evaluation is performed. However, as the recent case of WiFi recordings by Street View cars has shown, transparency is needed for such applications, as one needs to make sure that really no sensitive data are stored. In principle, it could be legally required that the underlying algorithms are published, and no algorithms may be used which are not open source.",

Whoever wants to process a large dataset, would only get a coarse-grained view of the data, since they would be accessible only via a high level in the data-processing hierarchy. Whoever managed to see data on a lower and, therefore, detailed level, would only have a very short-sighted and limited view, i.e. see very little. It appears, however, that the technical details of such systems matter in order to be sufficiently privacy-protecting and acceptable to users of the resulting services (e.g. location-based ones). A transparency of the data processing algorithms and related legal regulations appear to be needed. It should be explicitly forbidden and prevented to collect and store low-aggregation-level data. It must be ensured that they are deleted directly after they have been processed and before they are transmitted. To be uncritical and widely acceptable, the processing should happen in the technical devices used by the individuals and not on company-owned infrastructures (as it is common today).",

Among the search results, the personal computer or smart-phone of the user would then select the individually fitting search hits, products, or advertisements, based on personal information and preferences that are exclusively stored on the individual computer rather than on a system of servers. Putting it differently, recommender systems should be changed from an approach, where individually customized recommendations are pushed to the user, to a pull approach, where the user selects in confidence one option out of a larger spectrum of downloaded recommendations in a way that does not reveal his or her preferences. Individuals who are even concerned about storing personal information and preference data on their own computational device should have the possibility to turn off the second component, which would then result in untargeted research results and in recommendations, which would not be individually customized.",

There would also be encrypted specifiers (readable only to authorized users), such as the originator of the data (anonymous, pseudonym, real name, or company name), the owner (anonymous, pseudonym, real name, or company name), the date and time of generation, a unique content identifier (e.g. check sum), locations of authorized copies, and the persons or groups authorized to read, modify, or execute the file (which would again be based on real names or pseudonyms etc., but one possible specification would be \"everybody\"). -Annotations, which could be read only by the authorized persons or groups. The following data would be double encrypted and accessible only to the owner of the file (and jointly to a specially authorized group of inspectors, see below): the file identifyer(s) of the file(s) it has been derived from (i.e. the previous version(s), if one existed, otherwise null) and the files that have been derived from it (e.g. any identical or modified copies), all information regarding money transfers between customers or users of a file and the owner of its content as well as the respective tax authority, and the digital rights management settings (e.g. maximum number of copies that can be made from the original file). To ensure that privacy and intellectual property rights are not undermined, checksum error-detection techniques would immediately reveal unauthorized manipulations to the original copy. Semi-automatic filtering measures could be implemented on servers which would refuse storage and forwarding of tampered copies. This kind of filtering may be compared to the immune defence system of the body against harmful viruses etc. For issues of copyright protection see Secs. 9.2 and 9. Moreover, depending on the sensitivity of the data (public, restricted, confidential, secret, etc.), they would be fragmented and distributed over several files stored in different locations [190] and additionally password-protected, potentially requiring several passwords from independent authorized persons to access them.",

In fact, contributors are more difficult to identify and to reward, while vandals and other detractors can easily thrive. Therefore, the self-control of the Web, based on suitable reputation concepts, would be a desirable feature. In principle, people should be able to rate, tag and comment on any data they have accessed. Also ratings and comments could be rated, which would earn the rater a certain reputation.

Furthermore, whitewashing (a new pseudonym) and sybil attacks (the creation of many pseudonyms) should be prevented (see the previous section regarding possible ways to do this). Furthermore, to disclose a manipulation of the own reputation via pseudonyms one is controlling (or a mutual manipulation through a friendship network), consistency checks will be needed. That is, at random times, it will be necessary to compare the reputation values that a pseudonym has from the point of view of several others (randomly chosen interaction partners, also independent outsiders). This comparison of reputation values is something like a gossip strategy. If the values are sufficiently consistent, everything is fine and the reputation seems reliable. Otherwise, there are reasons to be suspicious. In such a case, the pseudonym would be labeled for the purpose of intensified observation in order to reveal the manipulation. Such a differentiated inspection strategy, which focuses on indviduals with a suspicious reputation (and newcomers), but which otherwise restricts to random inspections, saves computational resources but can keep the level of fraud low.",

Communities would either result from social networks, or they could be determined via community detection algorithms, identifying groups of people with similar rating, tagging, and commenting habits, i.e. with similar preferences and tastes (so-called \"quality collectives\" [193] ).

In other words, users could tag illegal or inappropriate contents. In serious cases, this could trigger sanctions (see below) or even legal action. For instance, the access to the file could be restricted (e.g. to people above a certain age), or the decryption could be disabled by a certain code foreseen by the cryptographic algorithm. Also, in case there is evidence that access to certain encrypted contents is in the public interest (e.g. relevant for public security), the encryption method could foresee a decryption. In order to avoid misuse such as censorship or violation of privacy, both, the decision to restrict access and to enforce decryption of a file or list of files, would need a certain number of randomly selected, generally trusted and authorized people to agree on the action that needs to be taken. Consequently, such actions would require the application of several keys at the same time. To avoid unjustified decryption by bribing authorized people, these should be replaced after a certain time period, which means that the keys unlocking a file need to change or be changed over time.",

Particularly destructive behavior may be sanctioned by temporary bandwidth reduction. For instance, manipulating ratings or reputation values by sybil attacks (self-ratings via multiple pseudonyms) should be sanctioned in one way or another. The same applies to wrong declarations (e.g. labeling advertisements or opinions as information). People should have a freedom to express their opinions, but they also need to have a chance to distinguish opinions from facts. Furthermore, spamming the Internet with low-quality contents should be sanctioned.

Therefore, it would be possible, in principle, to distinguish different kinds of currencies for different kinds of contributions, and it would also be feasible to a certain extent to analyze flows of microcredits between pseudonyms over time in a privacy-respecting and confidentiality-protecting way (see the section on reality mining regarding how to do this; note that companies could use different pseudonyms for different organizational units, and that they may change them over time).

Consequently, current technical solutions are insufficient. A new way of organizing the Internet appears to be needed and possible. Suitable solutions can be developed by transferring concepts of social self-organization to the design of the future Internet. This constitutes an interesting challenge within the research field of techno-social systems.",

Legal procedures and the law should establish what type of data can be collected, what type of data may not be collected, and how the sensitive part of the collected data must be hidden from people or organizations collecting them at each point of the data collection procedure. Methods of warranting the safety of sensitive data should be public and should be verifiable at all times before, during, and after collection.

            "text": "-Data storage, access, processing and usage standards should be fixed for public, commercial and private entities operating in a certain country. Transparency regarding the storage, access, processing and use of data should be enforced. In particular, there should be a binding public declaration of what kind of private data are being stored, processed and used, and how this is done. -Personal data should always be stored in an encrypted way. However, it should be made easy to inform oneself free of charge about the data determined and stored by other individuals, companies or institutions, and how these data are accessed, protected and used. Therefore, technical solutions should be required, which allow individuals to access (and decrypt) their personal data on-line and to delete data one does not want to be stored (if there is not a law that requires such storage). Further on, it should be easy to opt out from the determination, storage and/or processing of certain kinds of data. It should be possible to sanction violations of this right efficiently, and affected individuals should be properly compensated. -One should establish standards ensuring informed consent of users with the data an information system is determining, storing, or processing. Users should not be forced to agree with a storage, processing and use of information that is not technically required for the services a user wants to get. For example, providers of media contents should not force customers to reveal their identities (and effectively their preferences via the contents they buy), as the contents or services can also be paid for anonymously. Putting it differently, companies should be required to offer, in a clearly marked way, options to customers that allow them to choose at any time between a data-rich variant (providing the service provider with many detailed individual data) and a data-poor (privacy-protecting) variant without artificially created disadvantages (which would effectively force customers to reveal their data). Within fair limits, it would be acceptable though to charge a higher price for data-rich services to users, who have decided for the data-poor variant themselves. -Licence and usage agreements of software products and information services should be regulated and standardized. As most users do not read or understand the terms of use, and as they do not have any chance to negotiate these conditions, there should be a few (certainly less than ten) standard licences, which should be signalized by a color or other codes, whenever a certain software or information-based service is used. Alternatively, softwares and services should be rated by independent agencies based on the benefits users can expect from them and the degree to which privacy and confidentiality are potentially affected. -It would be useful to define the individual and corporate responsibilities for damages created in the virtual or real world by activities in the Internet. -However, considering the fact that the content of a file is revealed only when it is accessed, it should not be possible to punish people for the access of contents, if the contents are not warned of in advance in a sufficient and qualified way (e.g. based on the rating and reputation system suggested above). In other words, users should be protected from legal traps in the Internet. -Considering the abundance of free contents in the Internet, it is advised to implement a copyright, which considers the facts of modern information systems and requires copyright holders to make proper attempts to protect their products from unauthorized access (e.g. to indicate their copyrights, encode electronic files, and offer simple, fair, and anonymous payment procedures). -Compensations for privacy violations would have to be fixed, and legal procedures would need to be simple and effective to allow people to protect their rights. For example, fines to companies, which sell private data without authorization, should be significantly higher than the likely profit they can make on such business. -The priorities in cases of conflicts of interest should be worked out clearly (protection of individual human rights comes before collective public interests, which comes before institutional interests of companies or political parties, which comes before individual interests). -Legal regulations should protect individuals against discrimination based on private data and guarantee an efficient compensation in case of violations. -The introduction of class action would allow users to better defend their rights at court against individuals, companies, or institutions violating them, but the implementation should consider that the way attorneys are compensated and the way discovery is organized in civil procedures largely determines how desirable and effective class action lawsuits are. -Unique virtual identities/electronic signatures should be offered for everybody.",

These time periods should increase with the seriousness of the violation and its consequences. It should also depend on whether the effect of the violation was in the past or relevant for the presence and future as well. -There should be legal procedures regarding the random and targeted control of the fulfilment of legal standards regarding the storage, access, processing and use of private data. -Conditions should be worked out for imposing access restrictions or forced decryptions of suspicious Internet contents, in case there is evidence that they seriously threaten the public security (such as instructions how to build bombs). Such measures, their extent and results would have to be reported to the public, and individuals would have to be compensated, if it turned out that they were unjustified.",

A good example is the way in which Harvard University regulates the access and processing of the data of the Framingham Heart Study, which allowed scientists to discover social processes promoting the spreading of obesity, smoking, depression, or happiness, to mention just a few relevant examples of gained insights that can be beneficial for individuals and the public [11] . -There should be a fair right of information and participation in social activities mediated by ICT systems. For this reason, information businesses directed at a mass audience and with a large market share should be required not to discriminate and exclude certain user groups through inappropriate pricing schemes or terms of use (e.g. the requirement to agree with the arbitrary use or transfer of personal data or the requirement to allow for cookies, where this is technically not needed to provide the requested service).
