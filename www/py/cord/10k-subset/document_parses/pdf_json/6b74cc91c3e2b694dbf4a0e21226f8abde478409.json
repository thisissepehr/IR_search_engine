In subsequent pregnancies, women develop protective immunity to pregnancy-associated malaria and this has been hypothesized to be due to the acquisition of antibodies to the parasite variant surface antigen VAR2CSA. In this systematic review we provide the first synthesis of the association between antibodies to pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antigens and pregnancy and birth outcomes. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based studies (published up to 07 June 2019) of pregnant women living in P. falciparum endemic areas that examined antibody responses to pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antigens and outcomes including placental malaria, low birthweight, preterm birth, peripheral parasitaemia, maternal anaemia, and severe malaria. Results: We searched 6 databases and identified 33 studies (30 from Africa) that met predetermined inclusion and quality criteria: 16 studies contributed estimates in a format enabling inclusion in meta-analysis and 17 were included in narrative form only. Estimates were mostly from cross-sectional data (10 studies) and were heterogeneous in terms of magnitude and direction of effect. Included studies varied in terms of antigens tested, methodology used to measure antibody responses, and epidemiological setting. Antibody responses to pregnancyspecific pRBC and VAR2CSA antigens, measured at delivery, were associated with placental malaria (9 studies) and may therefore represent markers of infection, rather than correlates of protection. Antibody responses to pregnancy-specific pRBC, but not recombinant VAR2CSA antigens, were associated with trends towards protection from low birthweight (5 studies). Conclusions: Whilst antibody responses to several antigens were positively associated with the presence of placental and peripheral infections, this review did not identify evidence that any specific antibody response is associated with protection from pregnancy-associated malaria across multiple populations. Further prospective cohort studies using standardized laboratory methods to examine responses to a broad range of antigens in different epidemiological settings and throughout the gestational period, will be necessary to identify and prioritize pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antigens to advance the development of vaccines and serosurveillance tools targeting pregnant women.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In malaria-endemic areas, individuals can acquire clinical immunity to Plasmodium falciparum malaria after repeated exposure and symptomatic episodes in adults are relatively rare [1] .

Parasites taken from infected placentas display preferential binding to the glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) [15] , present on the surface of placental syncytiotrophoblasts and intervillous spaces [15] [16] [17] . This binding phenotype is rarely observed in parasites taken from non-pregnant individuals [15, [18] [19] [20] [21] , which are more likely to bind to receptors CD36 and ICAM-1 in the vascular endothelium. Thus, the parasites that infect pregnant women are understood to constitute a distinct population to those that infect non-pregnant individuals. Parasite binding to CSA on syndecan-1 [22] is mediated by the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family member VAR2CSA [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , expressed on the surface of pRBC. VAR2CSA is a large (350 kDa) protein with six Duffy-binding-like (DBL) domains (DBL1-6) and three interdomain (ID) regions [28] [29] [30] . The development of protective immunity to PAM over successive pregnancies has largely been assumed to be due to the acquisition of antibodies to VAR2CSA, specifically those that block adhesion to CSA. Two vaccine candidates based on the N-terminal CSA-binding region of VAR2CSA [28] have entered early-stage clinical trials: PAMVAC is comprised of domains ID1-DBL2X-ID2a from the P. falciparum strain FCR3 [31, 32] and PRIMVAC is comprised of domains DBL1X-DBL2X from P.f. 3D7 [33] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 233, "end": 237, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 238, "end": 241, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 366, "end": 370, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 454, "end": 458, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 459, "end": 463, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 464, "end": 468, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 562, "end": 566, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 567, "end": 571, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 572, "end": 576, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 577, "end": 581, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 582, "end": 586, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 860, "end": 864, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 960, "end": 964, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 965, "end": 969, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 970, "end": 974, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 975, "end": 979, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 980, "end": 984, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1144, "end": 1148, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1149, "end": 1153, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1154, "end": 1158, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1439, "end": 1443, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1567, "end": 1571, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1572, "end": 1575, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1638, "end": 1642, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Several studies have demonstrated parity-dependent increases in antibody responses to pregnancy-specific variant surface antigens on pRBC [18, 21, [34] [35] [36] , antiadhesion antibodies to CSA-binding parasites [37, 38] , and some, but not all, VAR2CSA domains [39] [40] [41] [42] , and a stronger correlation between parity and antibody responses has been observed in areas of more intense transmission [43] .

Nine of these studies found that Abs to pregnancy-specific pRBC and VAR2CSA antigens were positively associated with placental infection or placental parasite density [34, 39, 64, [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] 76] , but in some studies, this relationship was restricted to gravidity group, most commonly in primigravidae [34, 68] ( Table 2) .

Of the three cohort studies included in narrative terms, two provided evidence for an association between Ab responses to some, but not all VAR2CSA domains, and pRBC strains, measured earlier in pregnancy, and reduced risk of placental infection [73, 75] , and one indicated no difference in Ab levels to VAR2CSA domains measured in first or second trimester (T1/T2) among women who were negative or positive for placental infection (Table 2 ) [39] . Overall, the majority of estimates included in this review, and studies included in narrative terms, indicate that when measured at delivery, antibody responses to pregnancy-specific pRBC and VAR2CSA antigens are associated with the presence of placental infection and may therefore represent markers of infection, rather than correlates of protection. Of the five studies that measured antibodies earlier in pregnancy, and followed women until delivery, two provided evidence for a protective effect of anti-VAR2CSA antibodies [73] [74] [75] and three found no significant association with placental infection [42, 55, 59] . Peripheral P. falciparum infection Seven studies provided cross-sectional estimates for the association between antibody responses to pregnancyspecific antigens, measured at various time points, and peripheral P. falciparum infection, yielding heterogeneous results ( Fig. 3a and Additional file 7: Figures S6A  and S7A ) [42, 43, 51, 55, 58, 61, 63] . For many of the antigens examined, antibody responders had increased odds of peripheral infection compared to nonresponders, but these associations were rarely significant. Early in pregnancy (T1/T2), antibody responders to CS2-adherent FCR3 had increased odds of peripheral infection in pooled estimates from cross-sectional studies (reOR 2.20, 95% CI 1.05-4.63, I 2 = 35.2%) (Fig. 3a) [43, 55] . Similarly, antibody responders to a placental isolate at delivery had twofold increased odds of peripheral infection (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.29-3.25) [61] . Three studies included in narrative terms examined peripheral P. falciparum infection as an outcome [70, 71, 73] . In an IPTp trial in Mozambique, women who were parasitaemic at delivery had higher Abs to CS2 than non-parasitaemic women [71] , but antibody levels to a suite of placental isolates and VAR2CSA domains were not associated with peripheral infection after adjusting for placental malaria [70] . In women from Benin, high FV2 and DBL3 Abs early in pregnancy (T1/ T2) were associated with reduced risk of peripheral infection during pregnancy, but this association was not observed for the four other VAR2CSA domains analysed nor to CSPG-binding inhibitory Abs to FCR-3 [73] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 45, "end": 49, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 73, "end": 77, "text": "[42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 78, "end": 81, "text": "59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 557, "end": 561, "text": "[73,", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 562, "end": 565, "text": "75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 755, "end": 759, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1290, "end": 1294, "text": "[73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 1295, "end": 1299, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1300, "end": 1304, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1373, "end": 1377, "text": "[42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1378, "end": 1381, "text": "55,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1382, "end": 1385, "text": "59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1710, "end": 1714, "text": "[42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1715, "end": 1718, "text": "43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1719, "end": 1722, "text": "51,", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1723, "end": 1726, "text": "55,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1727, "end": 1730, "text": "58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1731, "end": 1734, "text": "61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1735, "end": 1738, "text": "63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 2128, "end": 2132, "text": "[43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2133, "end": 2136, "text": "55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2284, "end": 2288, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 2391, "end": 2395, "text": "[70,", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 2396, "end": 2399, "text": "71,", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 2400, "end": 2403, "text": "73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 2528, "end": 2532, "text": "[71]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 2692, "end": 2696, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 2972, "end": 2976, "text": "[73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 257, "end": 264, "text": "Fig. 2b", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 288, "end": 307, "text": "Figures S4B and S5B", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 744, "end": 752, "text": "(Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1656, "end": 1663, "text": "Fig. 3a", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 1687, "end": 1707, "text": "Figures S6A  and S7A", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2118, "end": 2127, "text": "(Fig. 3a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "Placental infection"}, {"text": "In addition to studies that provided cross-sectional estimates, four prospective studies and one nested case-control study provided estimates for the association between antibody responses earlier in pregnancy, and risk of peripheral parasitaemia later in pregnancy or at delivery (Fig. 3b and Additional file 7: Figures S6B and S7B) [42, 43, 51, 55, 57] .

We found that positive antibody responses to pregnancy-specific antigens were associated with increased odds of peripheral infection in some studies, with varying degrees of significance [43, 55, 57, 61] .

In contrast, antibodies to single domains (DBL2, DBL3, DBL4, DBL5), measured at delivery, were not associated with placental infection (Fig. 2a) . This finding suggests that reactivity to VAR2CSA epitopes in their native formation may be more relevant correlates of disease than responses to individual recombinant domains. Indeed, previous in vitro studies using the full-length extracellular VAR2CSA have suggested that the overall folding of the protein may be important for ability to bind CSA [77, 78] . Furthermore, it has been suggested that functional antibodies to VAR2CSA may have affinity to conformational epitopes not displayed by individual recombinant constructs from single alleles [79] .

Antibodies were measured fortnightly from enrolment to delivery, but only antibody responses at enrolment are included in estimates m Women were enrolled up to T3; also measured antibodies at T3 (weeks 30-32), but these estimates are not presented in this review n Pregnant women who were parasite positive (by quantitative PCR) and pregnant women who were parasite negative (quantitative PCR negative) were enrolled during T2 or T3 or at delivery o Antibody responses were only analysed in women who had at least one detected malarial infection during follow-up p Study was conducted using archival samples from pregnant women residing in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon, including 341 PM + women and 1036 PM \u2212 women qAnaemia was defined as < 30% packed cell volume r Estimates included in this review are for IgG3 responses because total IgG was not reported in original paper s Time points correspond to first-(6-29 weeks) and third-(25-41 weeks) antenatal visits; antibodies were also measured at second visit (16-36 weeks) but data is not included in this review t Women selected from a larger cohort of 910 women on the basis of HIV-1 status, gravidity, and placental histology u Original paper grouped women according to placental histology; for this review we combined women who had acute infection with those who had chronic infection, but excluded those with from uninfected women were included", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "women randomly selected from women who received placebo in IPTp trial l This study included the last 200 women who received SP or placebo in a randomized controlled trial and delivered in 2005, plus a random selection of 20% of the women who received placebo and delivered in 2003 or 2004 m Same IPTp trial as Mayor et al.[69] had confirmed malaria infection during \u2264 6 months of pregnancy based on slide or PCR data studies reported data from ten countries and the sample sizes ranged from 29 to 1377 participants.
