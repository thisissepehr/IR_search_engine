One way in which this is accomplished is via a \"common mucosal immunologic system\" (McDermott and Bienenstock, 1979) . The major mucosal immunological defense mechanism is based on the presence of polymeric secretory immunoglobulin (sIg) in secretions, derived from mucosal glands, that cover or emanate from mucosae. The presence of this immune system may be characterized by the localization within the mucosa of 1) B lymphocytes/plasma cells that produce sIg and the joining chain (J chain) that links immunoglobulin monomers into polymers; 2) secretory piece (SPc), a translocation factor that binds polymeric immunoglobulins a t the basolateral membrane of mucosal gland cells and delivers the complex into secretions; and 3) the sIg complex, consisting of polymeric immunoglobulin, J chain, and SPc in mucosal secretions. In amphibians, the major secretory immunoglobulin is IgM (Portis and Coe, 1975) , and the secretory complex (sIgM) is composed of IgM pentamers joined by J chain and SPc. In mammals, the major secretory immunoglobulin is IgA (Tomasi and Zigelbaum, 19631, 0 1991 WILEY-LISS, INC and the secretory complex (sIgA) is composed of IgA dimers joined by J chain and SPc. sIgM occurs in mammals but is less abundant and a t a diffusional disadvantage compared to the smaller sIgA; sIgM can function as a secretory antibody in mammals in cases of selective IgA deficiency (Underdown and Schiff, 1986; Brandtzaeg et al., 1987) . On mucosal surfaces, sIgA immobilizes particulate pathogens and inhibits the adherence of bacteria and viruses to mucosal binding sites; evidence suggests that sIgA also opsonizes pathogens, making them target cells for cytotoxic macrophages, T lymphocytes, and neutrophils (for review, see Underdown and Schiff, 1986) . The presence of the common mucosal immune system has been demonstrated in normal (uninfected) respiratory, digestive, reproductive, mammary, ocular, and otic mucosae (for reviews, see Widdicombe and Wells, 1982; Tomasi, 1984; Brandtzaeg, 1987; Cumella and Ogra, 1987) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 242, "end": 275, "text": "(McDermott and Bienenstock, 1979)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1044, "end": 1066, "text": "(Portis and Coe, 1975)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1212, "end": 1264, "text": "(Tomasi and Zigelbaum, 19631, 0 1991 WILEY-LISS, INC", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1550, "end": 1578, "text": "(Underdown and Schiff, 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1579, "end": 1603, "text": "Brandtzaeg et al., 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1897, "end": 1924, "text": "Underdown and Schiff, 1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 2111, "end": 2138, "text": "Widdicombe and Wells, 1982;", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 2139, "end": 2152, "text": "Tomasi, 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2153, "end": 2170, "text": "Brandtzaeg, 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2171, "end": 2194, "text": "Cumella and Ogra, 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Other immunoglobulins are also associated with mu-cosae and can play a role in mucosal defense. Immunoglobulin G (IgG), about 50% of which is distributed extravascularly, is present diffusely in the connective tissue ground substance of the lamina propria, often concentrated in blood vessel walls and basement membranes (Brandtzaeg, 1974a; ; up to 20% of the B lymphocytes and plasma cells present in mucosal lamina propriae produce IgG (Brandtzaeg, 1985) . IgD is distributed mainly intravascularly; however, IgD-producing B lymphocytes and plasma cells constitute up to 10% of the total immunocyte population in human nasal mucosa (Brandtzaeg, 1985) . IgE-producing B lymphocytes/plasma cells were described in the nasal mucosa of monkeys and humans (Tada and Ishizaka, 1970) ; however, Brandtzaeg (1984 Brandtzaeg ( , 1987 failed to find IgE-positive B lymphocytes in normal human nasal mucosa. Although increased local production of IgE has reported to occur in nasal mucosa in allergic reactions (Platt-Mills, 1979; Bachert and Ganzer, 19871, it has been suggested that the IgE-associated cells observed in nasal mucosa may be mucosal mast cells (Brandtzaeg, 1985) . Two additional proteins, lactoferrin and lysozyme, are also associated with protection of mucosal surfaces. Lactoferrin, a n iron-binding protein of the transferrin family, is found in the secretions of all exocrine glands (for reviews, see Clamp and Creeth, 1984; Hanson, 1985) , including those of the nasal mucosa (Miyauchi, 1984) . Lactoferrin exerts its protective effects by competing with bacterial iron-binding proteins for available iron and by increasing phagocyte adherence. Lysozyme, which binds to mucus glycoproteins that may act as carriers (Clamp and Creeth, 19841 , is a n enzyme that cleaves bonds commonly present in the proteoglycans of bacterial cell walls and is associated with the secretory granules of primarily serous gland cells in bronchial (Bowes and Corrin, 1977) and nasal (Tachibana et al., 1986) mucosae, although respiratory mucous gland cells may also secrete lysozyme (Spicer et al., 1977; Tachibana et al., 1986) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 321, "end": 340, "text": "(Brandtzaeg, 1974a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 438, "end": 456, "text": "(Brandtzaeg, 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 634, "end": 652, "text": "(Brandtzaeg, 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 753, "end": 778, "text": "(Tada and Ishizaka, 1970)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 790, "end": 806, "text": "Brandtzaeg (1984", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 807, "end": 826, "text": "Brandtzaeg ( , 1987", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1002, "end": 1021, "text": "(Platt-Mills, 1979;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1022, "end": 1051, "text": "Bachert and Ganzer, 19871, it", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1152, "end": 1170, "text": "(Brandtzaeg, 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1414, "end": 1437, "text": "Clamp and Creeth, 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1438, "end": 1451, "text": "Hanson, 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1490, "end": 1506, "text": "(Miyauchi, 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1729, "end": 1753, "text": "(Clamp and Creeth, 19841", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1942, "end": 1966, "text": "(Bowes and Corrin, 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1977, "end": 2001, "text": "(Tachibana et al., 1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 2077, "end": 2098, "text": "(Spicer et al., 1977;", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2099, "end": 2122, "text": "Tachibana et al., 1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The participation of the respiratory portion of the nasal mucosa in the common mucosal immune system has been well documented (see Poliquin and Crepeau, 1985 for reviews).

The question of the existence of an IgA-like immunoglobulin in amphibians is more controversial; however, Hadge and Ambrosius (1984, 1986) have provided considerable evidence for the cross-reactivity of \"IgY,\" a low-molecular-weight Ig found in birds, reptiles, and amphibians, with mammalian (including human) IgA. In A mbystoma, considered to be a n evolutionarily more primitive amphibian than Rana or Xenopus, the production of at least two classes of immunoglobulins, IgM and a low-molecular-weight Ig most likely analogous to IgY, in response to repeated antigen stimulation has been demonstrated (Warr et al., 1982) . It is generally accepted that the isotypes IgG, IgD, and IgE first appeared during evolution in mammals (Hadge, 1985) . Evidence for the evolutionary conservation of the structure of J chain and SPc also exists. The structure of J chain has been shown by cross-reaction techniques (Kobayashi et al., 1973) and by amino acid sequencing (Mikoryak et al., 1988) to be highly conserved; the gene for J chain synthesis is not linked to genes encoding immunoglobulin structure (Yagi et al., 1982) . A secretory-piece-like molecule has been demonstrated in the polymeric secretory immunoglobulins of teleosts and avians (Litman, 1984) . Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that polyclonal antibodies generated against human secretory immunoglobulins and their nonimmunoglobulin components will recognize epitopes that are present in the corresponding molecules in the tissues of amphibians and rodents. This conclusion is supported by the patterns of immunolocalization observed in this study. For example, an antibody to human serum (monomeric) IgA failed to stain any cells in the salamander. This antibody did stain in the rat a t sites that would be expected to contain sIg, i.e., Bowman's, respiratory, and serous salivary acini and B lymphocytes in nasal and salivary tissue. There was no staining by this antibody in sites that would not be expected to be involved in the secretory immune system by virtue of their production of a mucous rather than serous secretion (Brandtzaeg, 1987) and by their lack of staining for SPc, i.e., goblet rin. L, lumen. Magnification same as d. g: Granules in neutrophils (n) near blood vessels (BV) in center of submandibular gland display immunoreactivity for lactoferrin.

A similar pattern of localization in Bowman's glands for J chain, which is present in sIg molecules, is also consistent with this interpretation. Localization of SPc in secretory granules may represent newly synthesized, unbound SPc being stored or transported to gland cell membranes (Brandtzaeg, 197413) .

Transection of the olfactory nerve was performed under nonsterile conditions; it is possible that pathogens were introduced during this procedure and resulted in infection. However, there were no obvious signs of infection or inflammation at or near the site of the surgery. An alternative explanation is that the degenerating olfactory receptor cells release substances that induce Ig synthesis in or attract B lymphocytes, or that stimulate resident macrophages or T cells to induce maturation and Ig synthesis in B lymphocytes present in the tissue. Macrophage infiltration of the rat olfactory epithelium following olfactory nerve transection has been described previously (Monti Graziadei and Graziadei, 1979) ; after phagocytosis of the degenerating neurons, the macrophages disappeared. No theories were advanced for the mechanism of attraction of the macrophages.

Bowman's glands, respiratory glands and salivary glands failed to show consistent immunoreactivity for SPc, even though sIgA-and J chain-positive gland cells and B lymphocytes could be demonstrated at these sites. In the rat small intestine and liver, SPc expression and distribution does not reach adult levels until about 20-30 days postpartum (Buts and Delacroix, 1985; Vaerman et al., 1989) . In nasal mucosa and salivary glands from 6-wk-old rats, immunoreactivity for SPc was very faint. Only in tissue from 4-wk-old rats that had experienced previous infection by a virus (SDAV) that is known to invade serous glands, including those in the nasal mucosa (Jacoby et al., 1975) , was significant immunoreactivity for SPc in cells of Bowman's glands, respiratory glands, and salivary glands demonstrable. This suggests that either the epitopes recognized by the antibody to human SPc or the SPc molecule as a whole are not synthesized in quantities detectable by immunohistochemistry in the serous glands of rats up to 6 wk of age under \"normal77 (nonantigenically stimulated) conditions, but that upon infection, serous nasal glands and salivary glands can be induced to express SPc.
