            "text": "A novel atmospheric pressure plasma device releasing atomic hydrogen has been developed. This device has specific properties such as (1) deactivation of airborne microbial-contaminants, (2) neutralization of indoor OH radicals and (3) being harmless to the human body. It consists of a ceramic plate as a positive ion generation electrode and a needle-shaped electrode as an electron emission electrode. Release of atomic hydrogen from the device has been investigated by the spectroscopic method. Optical emission of atomic hydrogen probably due to recombination of positive ions, H + (H 2 O)n, generated from the ceramic plate electrode and electrons emitted from the needle-shaped electrode have been clearly observed in the He gas (including water vapour) environment. The efficacy of the device to reduce airborne concentrations of influenza virus, bacteria, mould fungi and allergens has been evaluated. 99.6% of airborne influenza virus has been deactivated with the operation of the device compared with the control test in a 1 m 3 chamber after 60 min. The neutralization of the OH radical has been investigated by spectroscopic and biological methods. A remarkable reduction of the OH radical in the air by operation of the device has been observed by laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy. The cell protection effects of the device against OH radicals in the air have been observed. Furthermore, the side effects have been checked by animal experiments. The harmlessness of the device has been confirmed.",

            "text": "The quality of indoor environments and its health implications have been studied intensively [1] . In particular, regarding the airborne spread of infection, the treatment of indoor microbialcontaminants such as virus, bacteria, mould fungi and allergens is one of the most important topics [2, 3] . Conventional methods for deactivation of microbial-contaminants involve heat (steam), chemical agents (active gases such as chlorine and ozone or solutions) and irradiation (UV). Most of these methods can cause adverse effects on the human body. When these conventional deactivation methods were used in a real environment, during the deactivation procedure persons could not stay in it and had to be out of that environment. On the other hand, as a new sterilization method, non-thermal plasma treatment technology is reported [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . A room-temperature atmospheric pressure plasma plume can be used without causing any heating or painful sensation for biomedical application. However, the plasma treatment method has the sterilization effect only in the localized plasma region. Thus, the plasma treatment is not appropriate for deactivation of airborne indoor microbialcontaminants. Recently deactivation technology that releases plasma-generated positive and negative ions was reported [9] . Bacteriostatic and fungi static effects of these ions were confirmed. In this technology, however, H + (H 2 O)m was used as a positive ion. It is of concern that releasing a large amount of H + may cause toxic effects on the human body as an acid aerosol [10] . As a result the amount of released ions was limited and the performance of this technology was also limited. A real time deactivation method against the airborne indoor microbial-contaminants applicable for a real environment in which persons can remain has been in great demand.",

            "text": "As another environmental health issue, the presence of free radicals, in particular OH in indoor environments, is of increasing concern [11] [12] [13] [14] . Although the direct reaction between the indoor OH radical and the human cell and its toxicity were not yet clear, it was reported that the OH radical initiates a complex series of reactions that generate intermediates and ultimately produce species that can adversely affect human health in indoor environments. Some of the products of OH-initiated reactions are irritating at very low concentrations and some of the products are strong oxidants and/or very acidic compounds that will contribute to oxidative and corrosive processes [11] . In this paper, we report the development of a novel atmospheric pressure plasma device that releases atomic hydrogen, H, into the air. In this device, H + generated by plasma is converted to atomic hydrogen that can neutralize the OH radical. The developed novel device is effective not only for deactivation of airborne indoor microbialcontaminants but also for neutralization of the OH radical in the air by using released atomic hydrogen. The developed device is applicable for a real environment where persons can remain during the device operation.",

In the spectroscopic experiments, the developed device was installed in a chamber where He gas (including water vapour) of 1 atm was filled. Figure 2 shows the experimental set-up for spectroscopic investigation. During the experiments, the temperature in the chamber was 25 \u2022 C. The water vapour was fed with He gas by heating water in a tank set in a He gas inlet system. The concentration of water in the chamber almost corresponded to the saturated vapour pressure of water at 25 \u2022 C. Optical emission from the plasma produced at the needle electrode was measured by a spectrometer with an image intensified CCD camera. Spatial distributions of emission intensities were measured in the area of \u22121 y +1 mm and \u22120.25 z +0.20 mm. An emission line of atomic hydrogen H I (656.3 nm) was clearly observed along with He lines in the He/water vapour plasmas [15] . Figure 3 shows the spatial distribution (3D plots) of the optical emission intensity of atomic hydrogen H I (656.3 nm) observed around the needle electrode, where the origin is the point of the electrode corresponding to the peak position of the intensity. The distribution shows remarkable asymmetry around the zaxis. The tail of the right wing stretches towards the ceramic plate positioned 36 mm away from the needle electrode in the direction of the y-axis. This result indicates that the positive ions, H + , from the ceramic plate recombine with electrons emitted from the needle electrode. The mechanism of the optical emissions in the device was discussed in our previous paper [15] .",

The virus used is a cold-adapted attenuated strain [19] considering the required safety during aerosolization of the virus. Influenza virus was propagated in 11 day-old embryonated hens' eggs. The deactivation effect on the influenza virus was tested in a 1 m 3 chamber. During the test temperature and humidity were 23-25 \u2022 C and 50-60%RH, respectively. Influenza virus of 10 9 PFU (plaque forming units) was aerosolized into the chamber using an air spray gun (Type W-33, Hyup Sung Co., Korea ). A fan was continuously turned on to provide adequate mixing of the aerosol inside the chamber during the experiment. After 10 min, the device was operated and the airborne viruses were collected on the MEM liquid media by an air-sampler (MAS-100 Eco, MERCK) at 20 min intervals. The virus titre of each sample was estimated with a plaque assay on Mabin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Samples having 500 \u00b5l of serial dilutions were plated on multi-wells of six-well plates and incubated in a CO 2 incubator at 30 \u2022 C for 4 days. Viral plaques were visualized by staining with crystal violet solution and the titres were calculated as PFU ml \u22121 . Triplicate samples were averaged for each data point. Representative data of the plaque assay are shown in figure 4 . The deactivation of influenza virus during the 60 min operation of the device is shown in figure 5 (a). The data show that the device significantly increases the deactivation as compared with natural deactivation of the virus in air. Figure 5 (b) shows that the reduction rates of influenza viruses compared with natural decay are 91.9%, 97% and 99.6% after 20 min, 40 min and 60 min, respectively.

In our device, as stable neutral species, O 3 , nitrogen oxides (N 2 O 5 , N 2 O, NO, NO 2 , HNO 2 and HNO 3 ), and H 2 O 2 can be produced from the needle-shaped electrode. However, the concentrations of O 3 and nitrogen oxides were measured to be less than 0.01 ppm and 0.001 ppm, respectively as described in section 2. Since these concentrations were very low, O 3 and nitrogen oxides can be excluded from the agents responsible for the observed deactivation of microbialcontaminants. In addition, the device reduced the cell death induced by H 2 [16] , however, the deactivation of airborne bacteria was not observed when the efficacy test was conducted using only negatively charged ions. Therefore, these negatively charged species are not responsible for the deactivation of microbial-contaminants. According to Laroussi [6] , active radicals and anions such as O, OH and HO \u2212 2 play the most important role in the destruction of microorganisms in atmospheric pressure plasma. Goree et al [8] investigated the transport mechanism of bactericidal agents in the plasma needle. In their study, the optical emissions of O and OH were observed from the glow of the plasma needle. They reported that the bactericidal agent has a lifetime <0.5 ms. A spot for killing bacteria by the plasma needle was 5 mm in diameter [8] . For OH, the lifetime in pure air at room temperature can be very short [20] . Depending on the OH concentration, the recombination reaction of OH radicals can happen as fast as 50 \u00b5s at room temperature [20] . Thus, O and OH are not the agents responsible for the observed deactivation of microbial-contaminants, because in our experiments the deactivation was observed in the real-sized test chambers.",

            "text": "The chemical agent responsible for the deactivation of microbial-contaminants observed in this study should be longlived. For H + (H 2 O)m produced from the device, the lifetime is approximately 3-5 s in air [9] . In addition, the superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity of reduced water due to atomic hydrogen was reported to be stable at 4 \u2022 C for over a month [21] . From these results, atomic hydrogen surrounded by water molecules, H(H 2 O)m, is possibly long-lived. As a possible explanation of the observed deactivation of airborne microbial-contaminants, we consider the following. In our device, H(H 2 O)m released from the device reacts with O 2 and O \u2212 2 (H 2 O)n in air or at the surface of airborne microbialcontaminants. As a result, active species, HO 2 or HO \u2212 2 , are generated. These active species break the cell membranes of bacteria and mould fungi or modify the protein located at the surface of the virus and allergens. In the previous paper [9] , the haemagglutination reaction (HA) test was conducted. In this case a haemagglutination reaction was not found in red blood corpuscles (RBC) inoculated with influenza viruses that were exposed to positive and negative ions. This result indicates that the spike-like haemagglutinin protein of influenza virus was modified by the exposure to these ions. In our device, although the detailed mechanism is not yet clear, the surface protein of the virus would be modified since similar reactions at the surface of virus can be expected. In the case of allergens, HO 2 or HO \u2212 2 could modify the surface protein and protect against antigen-antibody reactions. As a result, the developed device has deactivation characteristics against airborne virus, bacteria, mould fungi and allergens. The deactivation function of the device can be explained phenomenally as described above, but the investigation of the mechanism on a molecular scale is needed and is currently underway.",

A dye laser (Quanta-Ray PDL-3) pumped by a Nd-YAG laser (Quanta-Ray GCR-11) with a pulse duration of 5 ns and a repetition rate of 10 Hz produced tunable radiation at a wavelength around 564 nm using Rhodamine 590 dye. Second harmonic radiation was generated with a BBO crystal pumped by the tuned laser beam. The wavelength was tuned at 282 nm to achieve excitation of the A-X transition. The LIF signal was observed along the x-axis by using a monochromator (JASCO CT-25) with a photomultiplier (Hamamatsu Photonics R3896) in the UV region (280-320 nm). The pulse waveform was recorded by a digital storage oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS-620B). Figure 9 shows the LIF spectra observed in (a) a planeparallel hollow cathode plasma with the helium/water mixture at 20 Torr and in (b) an atmospheric air discharge plasma with a humidity of 50%RH at 24 \u2022 C. At a low-pressure discharge, a well-defined LIF spectrum having three peaks typical of OH radicals was obtained in figure 9(a) [22] . On the other hand, the OH-LIF intensity obtained in the atmospheric air plasma is extremely weak compared with the low-pressure one as shown in figure 9 (b). The LIF signal at 309 nm was stronger than that at 314 nm. The LIF signal was not observed at 282 nm except for the Rayleigh scattering light. In this excitation scheme the excited state rapidly relaxes into the lowest vibrational state due to frequent collision at atmospheric pressure. Then the 309 nm transition became dominant due to quenching of the fluorescence from the A 2 + (v = 1). Thus, the 309 nm LIF signal was chosen to observe the neutralization of the OH radical by the operation of the developed device. Figure 10 shows that the LIF pulse signals at 309 nm were observed in the vicinity of atmospheric air plasma with and without the operation of the developed device. The distances between the observed point and the device were (a) 10 cm and (b) 19 cm. As shown, a remarkable reduction in the LIF intensity was observed when the device was operated.",

In these cases, no change of LIF signal intensities was observed within the fluctuation of the measurements. These experimental results suggest that the agent was generated by a reaction of chemical species produced from the ceramic plate electrode and those from the needle electrode. The agent should be long-lived, since the reduction in the OH-LIF signal was observed at a distance of 19 cm from the device. From these results, we consider that the atomic hydrogen surrounded by water molecules, H(H 2 O)m, generated by the reaction of H + (H 2 O)m and electrons is responsible for the reduction of the OH radicals in the air. The recombination of H(H 2 O)m and OH can reduce the concentration of OH radicals in the air. The direct recombination of atomic hydrogen H and OH leads to O and H 2 . In our device, however, atomic hydrogen is surrounded by water molecules. We consider that a recombination similar to the three-body reaction (OH + H + H 2 O \u2192 2H 2 O) probably occurs as follows:",

Under a bright field microscope, many of the cells incubated in the presence of the OH generator showed shrunken morphology whereas those incubated in the presence of the OH generator plus the device remained relatively healthy in figure 11 (c), upper panels.
