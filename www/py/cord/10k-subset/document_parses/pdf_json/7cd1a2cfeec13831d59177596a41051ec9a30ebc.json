Despite this collaboration and high literacy rates, we sometimes had difficulty interpreting the meaning of participants' responses.

Patients generally assume a passive role in their care and can be confused when asked for their informed consent to participate in a study. This approach challenges the role of the physician, who typically tells the patient what to do. It can erode a patient's trust when a physician demonstrates uncertainty in the best treatment and, therefore, wants to experiment with them. Gender inequity is prevalent in these settings, and traditional expectations of a woman's role remains strong, even among women who are highly educated.

Having a chronic condition can be construed as something that will cause one to be less productive in work and incur health care costs for the family; therefore, such information should not be shared with others, especially anyone outside of the family. In Vietnam and Uganda, patients with diabetes do not wear medical alert bracelets or identification because they fear being labeled as a person with a serious health problem. Sharing health problems with others could reduce one's chances of marriage by raising anxieties about infertility in a culture where reproduction is expected of a married couple. Also, chronic conditions such as hypertension or diabetes are associated with complications from medications or disease processes that lead to impotence.

Partnering requires ongoing work to identify shared interests, build trust, establish rigorous methodology, and yet provide useful research outcomes. A trusting partnership allows for flexibility in ongoing learning while working within systems that may seem messy and within cultures that we know somewhat superficially. We designed our diabetes intervention to complement our Ugandan partners' ongoing research funded by the World Diabetes Federation, to provide training in diabetes management and basic equipment to 20 hospitals throughout the country.

Many successful interventions to improve physical activity are so resource intensive for relatively short periods of time that they are not sustainable [3] . In areas of limited resources and great need, the RCT is problematic because it does not address the need for a greater understanding of, and research on, setting-specific contextual factors.

With donated space from the hospital, we used $2,000 USD to create a diabetes clinic that included an exam room, an office, and lab space. The renovation included a large covered porch where patients could wait and hold group meetings under shelter from sun and rain. Providing space for the diabetes association's monthly educational meetings has encouraged patients with diabetes that efforts are being made to improve their care. Furthermore, we left behind written educational materials that could be taken home, referred to, and even shared with the patient's family and friends.
