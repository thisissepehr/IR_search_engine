Despite the difference in clinical presentation of the infection, both isolates exhibited a high level of resistance to macrolide antibiotics.

Genome sequence analysis revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms mainly focused on adhesin P1, which is involved in the pathogenicity of M pneumoniae.",

[1, 2] It is transmitted through aerosols, and the severity of infection varies from mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonia. [3] M pneumoniae infections can be treated with macrolides, which are generally considered to be the first-choice antibiotics for children; tetracycline and fluoroquinolones are generally not recommended for use in children because of potential adverse effects. [4, 5] However, the prevalence of macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae strains has increased rapidly since 2000, especially in Asian countries (In China, in 2012, 100% of M pneumoniae isolates were macrolide resistant; Japan, 100% in 2015; Korea, 64.5% in 2012). [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Point mutations in the 23S ribosomal RNA gene are known to be the major mutations that give rise to drug resistance in M pneumoniae.

[17] To obtain reliable alignment hits, a maximum of 2 mismatches was allowed between the read and the reference sequence. For paired-end data, mapping locations for each read were restricted to sites within 500 bp of the mapping location of the partner sequence. For the other data, strain-specific SNPs were manually reviewed by taking into account whether SNPs were detected by MAUVE. We used BRIG (BLAST Ring Image Generator) to show the similarity between a reference sequence M129 and the 2 isolate sequences as concentric rings.

            "text": "Macrolides are generally considered to be the first-choice agents for the treatment of M pneumoniae infection. [1] [2] [3] [4] In 2000, M pneumoniae showing resistance to macrolides was isolated from clinical samples obtained from Japanese pediatric patients with community-acquired respiratory tract infections. Since then, the prevalence of macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae isolates in pediatric patients has increased rapidly. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] M pneumoniae macrolide resistance has been associated with point mutations in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene of M pneumonia, and usually causes severe pneumonia. [5] However, in our study, the 2 isolates were both macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae, based on the presence of an A-to-G transition at position 2063 of the 23s rRNA gene. However, the girl, Case 1, had severe M pneumoniae pneumonia with longer-lasting fever and cough, which only improved after the second course of azithromycin. In contrast, the boy, Case 2, had mild M pneumoniae pneumonia, which only required 3 days of macrolide treatment. In previous studies, severe M pneumoniae pneumonia patients have been shown to exhibit higher CRP (CRP >40 mg/L) and ESR (ESR >30 mm/h) than normal, and these parameters were considered a useful marker for predicting the efficacy of macrolides and helping clinicians make better clinical decisions in children with macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae infection. [19] In this study, Case 1 had severe M pneumoniae pneumonia with an ESR of 62 mm/h, whereas Case 2 had mild M pneumoniae pneumonia with an ESR of 28 mm/h. This result was consistent with previous reports: the value of ESR may be helpful for early identification of severe M pneumoniae pneumonia in children. In contrast, they had the same trend of change in CRP, which was different from previous studies. [19, 20] Investigation of antibiotic resistance showed that both isolates had a high level of resistance to erythromycin and azithromycin and low level of resistance to medemycin; but they were susceptible to tetracycline and chloromycetin. Though we demonstrated in vitro susceptibility of macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae to tetracycline and chloromycetin, neither of them are recommended for use in children, because tetracyclines can cause permanent dental discoloration and fluoroquinolones have potential for damaging cartilage. [3, 4] There are several possible explanations for the observation that isolates from patients were resistant to macrolide antibiotics, even though the patients had markedly different courses of disease. First, although resistant to macrolide antibiotics, the MIC value for azithromycin of the isolate from Case 2, with milder disease, was lower than that of Case 1, with more severe disease. Second, the inflammatory response to M pneumoniae infection may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of clinical disease; the girl, Case 1, with more severe disease, had previously (4 years prior) developed asthma, from which she fully recovered; but in the year preceding this infection she had recurrent respiratory tract infections, suggesting that her immune system Last, but most importantly, whole genome sequence analysis showed that the main differences between the 2 isolates were in hypothetical proteins and adhesin P1. The P1 protein plays an important role in the attachment to human respiratory epithelial cells, and is involved in pathogenicity of M pneumoniae, so mutations in this protein may change the virulence of M pneumoniae strains. [21] [22] [23] [24] We speculate that identification of mutations in the P1 protein could aid in distinguishing severe from mild disease after infection with macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae. As the function of the hypothetical proteins is unknown, we cannot rule out that mutations in these hypothetical proteins could also affect disease severity.",

In a healthy child with a macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae infection, azithromycin still showed a favorable clinical and microbiological response. However, a patient with related primary diseases, like asthma or immunodeficiency disease, may have severe pneumonia caused by macrolideresistant M pneumoniae, azithromycin may have a poor effect and need several rounds of treatment, or other avenues of treatment may need to be explored. Knowledge of the health history of patients is thus very important for the ability to predict the severity of the disease at the early stages, and early diagnosis of severe macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae is crucial for the best management of these patients.",
