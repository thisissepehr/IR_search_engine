The clear supernatant fluid containing most of the viral glycoproteins was dialyzed overnight against 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The dialyzed solution, or in some cases undialyzed supernatant solution, was charged at 0\u00b0C onto a fetuin-Sepharose 4B column which had been equilibrated with 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer, pH5.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After washing the column with the same buffer to elute all of the proteins other than HANA protein, the column temperature was raised to 26\u00b0C and elution was continued. Purified HANA protein was thereby eluted. It was shown to be homogeneous upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 1 % 2-mercaptoethanol. F glycoprotein was purified from the non-adsorbed fraction from fetuin-Sepharose column chromatography by concanavalin A-Sepharose column chromatography using stepwise elution with a-methylmannoside (M. Ozawa, unpublished) . The fetuin-Sepharose column was prepared by coupling fetuin, which had been boiled for 5 min in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and dialyzed against 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.7) containing 0.5 M sodium chloride, to BrCN-activated Sepharose 4B at a ratio of 10 mg of denatured fetuin to 1 ml of agarose beads.",

In contrast with paramyxoviruses, influenza virus showed no decrease in hemagglutinating or neuraminidase activity (up to 20 mM DTT; data not shown), nor cleavage of interpeptide disulfide bonds (Fig. 3) on treatment with thiol compounds under non-denaturing contidions. Therefore, we next treated the virus with DTT under denaturing conditions, i.e., in the presence of 8 M urea. The virus preparation, thus reduced and then washed, no longer contained HA! even though HA 2 and NA were still present (Fig. 4) . This result may be explained as follows: HA X and HA 2 were interconnected by disulfide bond(s) but only HA 2 was embedded in the virus membrane. Thus, cleavage of the interpeptide disulfide bond under denaturing conditions can release the HA X subunit from the virion. Although the release of hemagglutinin-binding antigen (equivalent to HAO from the virion by guanidine HC1 plus DTT extraction was reported previously (22) , the lipid bilayer was destroyed by chloroform extraction before splitting the disulfide bonds, and furthermore the location of HA 2 was not studied in this case. (pH 7.6) cotaining 1 mM EDTA. In no case was release of F x and F 2 subunits from the virion observed (Fig. 5) . Since no decrease in HANA glycoprotein content was observed in these treated viruses [compare Fig. 5 with Fig. lc of a previous report (77)], this suggests that all of the membrane glycoproteins present on HVJ membrane are embedded in the lipid bilayer.",

Therefore, the presence of such a bond may be a common feature in some types of viral proteins. Most of them interconnect non-identical subunits and seem to be derived from an intrapeptide disulfide bond by proteolytic processing of precursors; they may play some physiological role in virus assembly. However, no evidence for the presence of such a precursor protein was observed for HANA glycoprotein of HVJ (29) or neuraminidase of influenza virus (30) . Furthermore, the disulfide bonds seem /. Biochem. to interconnect subunits of identical or almost the same size in these cases. Therefore, it seems that we are dealing with at least two types of disulfide bonds in viral membranes. The sensitivity of disulfide bonds to sulfhydryl compounds, i.e., the ease of splitting by these compounds, seems to differ among these proteins (Fig. 7) . In general, disulfide bonds of fusogenic paramyxovirus glycoproteins were found to be cleaved under nondenaturing conditions, whereas those of nonfusogenic influenza virus glycoproteins were much more stable, as shown in Fig. 7 . Denaturation by the addition of urea, guanidine-HCl, or SDS was required for cleavage of the bonds by DTT. An increase in susceptibility to cleavage after denaturation seems to be a general feature, as in the case of a plant toxin, ricin (31) . The rather unusual lability of HANA protein of fusogenic viruses with respect to sulfhydryl compounds could be biologically important, since the glycoprotein sticks out from the viral surface by about 120 A (52), apparently preventing close contact of the lipid bilayers of the viral envelope and cell membrane; therefore, fusion of the viral membrane to the cell membrane may be prevented if this structure is not modified somehow after the contact.",

The peptides are interconnected with a labile disulfide bond which can be cleaved by thiol compounds under non-danaturing conditions. Cleavage of such disulfide bonds generally results in an increase of toxicity in cell-free assay, whereas toxicity toward intact cells is decreased either partially or drastically to less than 10% of that of the untreated toxin (31, (33) (34) (35) . Thus, ease of cleavage of interpeptide disulfide bonds seems to be a common feature of a group of toxic proteins with binding subunit(s) interconnected with a catalytic subunit by a disulfide bond. Since several viruses which show a high fusion frequency of their envelope to the cell membrane also have rather a labile disulfide bond on their surface protein, as shown in this report, it is conceivable that this characteristic is important for the entry of these toxins and viruses through the plasma membrane. In contrast, influenza virus which has little or no chance of envelope fusion (12, 36) , seems to possess rather rigid glycoprotein spikes.

HA X glycoprotein of influenza virus was found to be an example of the latter type; cleavage of the interpeptide disulfide bond between HA X and HA 2 under denaturing conditions resulted in solubilization of HA t from the virion, leaving HA 2 behind, as expected from a model reported earlier (1) .

This does not mean, however, that most of the membrane proteins are of this type, but may simply be a result of the fact that the proteins so far studied are those which are amphipathic in nature and have a large hydrophilic region. Proteins which may span the membrane several times are under intensive study, and the presence of multiple membrane binding sites in membrane proteins has become clear in the case of bacteriorhodopsin (42) and band 3 protein of human erythrocytes (43) . Tight binding of the F t and F 2 segments of F glycoprotein of HVJ to the viral membrane shows that this is another case of the latter type of membrane protein.",
