Although he recovered after a protracted illness, he required major life support, including mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis.

An in-depth work-up for causes of this catastrophic illness confirmed acute leptospirosis. Although rare, leptospirosis is a potentially lethal infection classically associated with hepatitis, azotemia, and meningitis. Most patients experience self-limited illness, with fever, myalgias, and malaise followed by an immunemediated aseptic meningitis. A small proportion develop shock and multiple organ dysfunction. Whereas myalgias are ubiquitous in leptospiral infection, and most patients show mildly elevated muscle enzymes, life-threatening rhabdomyolysis is rare. This atypical case is reported to urge clinicians to consider leptospirosis in the evaluation of a patient with cryptogenic sepsis who develops multiple organ dysfunction associated with rhabdomyolysis.
