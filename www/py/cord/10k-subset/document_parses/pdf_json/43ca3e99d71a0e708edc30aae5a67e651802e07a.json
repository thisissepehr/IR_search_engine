Shedding of the endothelial glycocalyx is increasingly being recognized as an important pathophysiological mechanism but at present it is unclear if glypicans contribute to this response. We hypothesized that plasma levels of glypicans (GPC) are elevated in patients with sepsis. Methods: Plasma GPC 1-6 levels were measured by ELISA in 10 patients with sepsis and 10 healthy controls as an initial screening. Plasma GPC 1, 3, and 4 were further measured in a cohort of 184 patients with a clinically confirmed infection. Patients were divided into groups of those who had sepsis and those who had an infection without organ failure. To determine whether plasma glypicans could predict the development of organ failure, patients were further subdivided to those who had organ failure at enrolment and those who developed it after enrollment. The association of plasma GPC 1, 3, and 4 with organ failure and with various markers of inflammation, disease severity, and glycocalyx shedding was investigated. Results: In the pilot study, only GPC 1, 3, and 4 were detectable in the plasma of sepsis patients. In the larger cohort, GPC 1, 3, and 4 levels were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in patients with sepsis than in those with infection without organ failure. GPC 1, 3, and 4 were significantly positively correlated with plasma levels of the disease severity markers C-reactive protein, lactate, procalcitonin, and heparin binding protein, and with the marker of glycocalyx degradation syndecan 1. They were significantly negatively correlated with plasma levels of the glycocalyx-protective factors apolipoprotein M and sphingosine-1-phosphate.

Syndecans, as transmembrane proteins, can only be released by proteolytic cleavage. Heparan and chondroitin sulfate can be shed along with a proteoglycan core protein or can be removed by heparanases and chondroitinases. Mechanisms of glypican shedding are less well studied. In theory, glypicans can be released by three different mechanisms of shedding. First, glypicans are anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, and so they can be shed from the membrane by phospholipases that cut the GPI moiety, freeing the whole protein core and the heparan sulfate chains from the membrane [36] . Phospholipase activity is altered in the plasma in sepsis [37, 38] and several bacteria can secrete phospholipases that could potentially sever the GPI anchor [39] so this shedding mechanism could be relevant in sepsis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 60, "end": 63, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 687, "end": 691, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 752, "end": 756, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 757, "end": 760, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 853, "end": 857, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Glypicans can also be cleaved proteolytically by furin-like convertases [40] . Furin levels are unchanged in sepsis [41] so this mechanism of shedding is less likely. However, endoproteolytic cleavage of glypicans also occurs intracellularly prior to glypican trafficking to the cell surface [42] . This results in an N-terminal domain that is linked to the membrane-associated C-terminal domain only by disulfide bridges [40, 42] . Disulfide bonds are highly susceptible to breakage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) during changes in oxidative conditions [43] , which could lead to the release of glypican N-terminal domains from the cell surface, leaving the C-terminal domain, which contains the heparan sulfate chains [40] , still attached to the membrane. Sepsis is associated with massive increases in ROS and changes in the redox state of the blood and cells [44] , and so this shedding mechanism could also be relevant in sepsis. Measurement of plasma glypicans can therefore potentially provide information about phospholipase-and ROS-mediated glycocalyx damage, which is not available from measurement of syndecan, hyaluronan or heparan sulfate levels. The strengths of this study lie in our measurement of different glypican species to determine the relevant players in sepsis. We used commercial ELISA kits and measurement was done while blinded to the clinical outcomes of the patients. Additionally the cohort was fairly large and the patients had a wide range of clinical diagnoses and disease severities. A limitation of this study is that we were not able to distinguish between glypicans produced by the endothelium or by other cells. Additionally we did not examine whether increased plasma glypican levels are due to glycocalyx shedding, which may compromise endothelial barrier function, or whether they simply reflect increased turnover of the glycocalyx with no effect on barrier function. Recent experimental data from mice suggests that sepsis both induces shedding and impairs regeneration of the glycocalyx [45] . Lastly, the glypican ELISAs used polyclonal antibodies to the whole glypican protein, making it impossible to distinguish between glypicans shed by cleavage of the GPI anchor or the disulfide bridges. The development of ELISAs specific to the different cleavage products would be required to determine which form of each glypican is present in plasma and to indicate which shedding mechanisms are relevant during sepsis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 72, "end": 76, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 116, "end": 120, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 292, "end": 296, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 422, "end": 426, "text": "[40,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 427, "end": 430, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 556, "end": 560, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 722, "end": 726, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 866, "end": 870, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2034, "end": 2038, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We report for the first time that glypican 1, 3, and 4 levels are elevated in the plasma of patients with sepsis compared to those with infection without organ failure.

Patients were divided into groups of those who developed organ failure after enrollment, those who never developed organ failure, and those who already had organ failure on enrollment. Plasma levels of a GPC 1, b GPC 3, and c GPC 4 were compared between groups using a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons test. ROC curves were generated to examine the ability of each glypican to predict the development of organ failure in patients who did not already have organ failure upon enrollment. Area under the curve (AUC) and 95% confidence intervals are indicated on each graph conditions, including sepsis, are associated with massive shedding of the glycocalyx from endothelial and other cell surfaces, we examined whether GPC 1, 3, and 4 shedding may occur in conjunction with the shedding of other glycocalyx components", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "of febrile adult patients with clinically suspected infection who were enrolled into the study upon admission to the Clinic for Infectious Diseases at Lund University Hospital (Lund, Sweden) between March 2006 to April 2008[22].
