In this paper, we develop an extended CA simulation model to study the dynamical behaviors of HIV/AIDS transmission. The model incorporates heterogeneity into agents' behaviors. Agents have various attributes such as infectivity and susceptibility, varying degrees of influence on their neighbors and different mobilities. Additional, we divide the post-infection process of AIDS disease into several sub-stages in order to facilitate the study of the dynamics in different development stages of epidemics. These features make the dynamics more complicated. We find that the epidemic in our model can generally end up in one of the two states: extinction and persistence, which is consistent with other researchers' work. Higher population density, higher mobility, higher number of infection source, and greater neighborhood are more likely to result in high levels of infections and in persistence. Finally, we show in four-class agent scenario, variation in susceptibility (or infectivity) and various fractions of four classes also complicates the dynamics, and some of the results are contradictory and needed for further research.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "focus on HIV/AIDS transmission among human groups in order to better understand its dynamical behavior.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In epidemic modeling (see, e.g., Bailey 1975; Anderson and May 1991; Murray 2005) , there are two frequently used methodologies: mathematical and simulation methods. For mathematical approaches, a cohort of people is often classified into susceptibles, infectives, and recovereds with (without) immunity (see, e.g., Kermack and McKendrick 1927) . Systems of differential equations are used to describe the linear (nonlinear) dynamics of epidemics. Macroscopically, mathematical models can reveal the relationship among primary factors and describe their effects to epidemic spreading under certain assumptions. As to HIV/AIDS epidemic, many models have been proposed (May and Anderson 1987; Hyman et al. 1999; Brauer and Driessche 2001; Wu and Tan 2000, etc.) . However, mathematical approaches have some serious drawbacks due to its intractability and the complexity of epidemics. Moreover, the complicated nature of HIV/AIDS transmission makes it even harder to obtain analytical solutions and difficult to study them. In the early 1990s, some researchers started to apply simulation approaches to this field. There is a large literature that addresses the computer simulation of epidemic dynamics (see, e.g., Leslie and Brunham 1990; Atkinson 1996; Rhodes and Anderson 1996; Rhodes and Anderson 1997; Ahmed and Agiza 1998; Benyoussef et al. 2003; Tarwater and Martin 2001) . Particularly, cellular automata (CA) method (some literature refers to this as a lattice-based method) has been widely used in modeling complex adaptive systems. Despite of its simple structure, CA is well suited to describing the propagation phenomena, such as rumor spreading, particle percolation, innovation propagation, and disease spreading. For instance, in epidemic modeling, Fuentes and Kuperman (1999) propose two CA models corresponding to the classical mathematical SIS model and SIS model respectively. Ahmed and Agiza (1998) develop a CA model that takes into consideration the latency and incubation period of epidemics and allow each individual (agent) to have distinctive susceptibility. Gao et al. (2006) put forward a CA model for SARS spreading which takes account of social influence. More Recently, other methods such as agent-based modeling and system dynamics are introduced to this field (see, e.g., Gordan 2003; Bagni et al. 2002) . Our paper contributes to this filed by developing an extended CA simulation model.

First, most of the models assume that there is no latent (or incubation) period. However, for some epidemics, especially AIDS, there are variously lasting periods of latency and incubation as well as behavior-varying infectivity (or susceptibility) during these periods. In fact, the development of AIDS involves a few stages in which an infected individual can exhibit different behaviors. Those diversified behaviors, in turn, have some ignorable effects on the dynamics of HIV/AIDS. In light of this, we extend the conventional division of epidemic process (i.e., susceptible, infection, and removed) by dividing the infection period into three sub-stages, each corresponding to the clinical stage occurring in the course of AIDS development. Due to the inability of classical CA approaches to accommodate those newly added state transitions events, we also borrow some ideas from discrete-event simulation techniques and make one agent's stage transitions being time-triggered instead of using some state-based transition rules.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 216, "end": 231, "text": "Frauenthal 1980", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Secondly, it is commonly assumed that individuals in the population are homogenous in the sense that they have equal infectivity and susceptibility, or they can exert the same influence on each other, etc. This assumption may be satisfied in commonly observed epidemics but not consistent with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. As we know, susceptibility and infectivity heavily depends on individuals' behavior. For examples, safe sex practices such as the use of condom could dramatically reduce the chance of infection. Also, the way of HIV/AIDS transmission for one to another is various, depending on the interactions between people, and thus the probability of getting infected is determined in part by transmission routes and can be quite different between infected-male/susceptible-female and susceptible-male/infectedfemale interactions. Under this assumption, the models that are confined to a single high-risk human group are not suitable in overall population cases. New models are needed to explicitly consider the complexity. Therefore, we make an extension to the traditional CA model by introducing the extended definition of neighborhood and attaching some attributes to each agent such as infectivity and resistibility. We also define four types of agents that are characterized by different infectivity (and susceptibility) and various forms of neighborhood to represent four types of people in real life. In doing so, we will be able to investigate the dynamics of HIV/AIDS with heterogeneous groups in a realistic way.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Thirdly, classical CA models assume that agents in the grid are spatially fixed, that is, once an agent is placed in a cell, it does not move into another cell. This assumption is problematical because people in the real world are migratory. For instance, in China, millions of rural people leave their hometowns and seek jobs in the cities. The migration of population is a driving force for the spread of HIV/AIDS. Ignoring the mobility of agents in epidemic models would jeopardize the creditability of the results obtained. Considering this point, we incorporate agents' mobility into their behaviors.

The intuition . 3 The spatial distribution of the population at time t = 1275 behind is that in the first case, newly infected continuously enter the pool of infectives at a fairly low rate in early stages. After the lengthy incubation period, these infectives begin to develop AIDS and eventually die. The total number of them drops when the infection rate is very low with regard to the rate at which infectives leave the pool for some reason (dead in the model). While in the second case, healthy agents get infected at a relatively high rate in early stages. The infection level continues to increases because the number of removed agents is relatively small in later stages. Thus high infection rate often leads to prevalence as demonstrated in Fig. 4b . These two results can be found in real-world situations. Notice that Fig. 4 The infections vs. time result in two simulations in the parameters setting, the growth rate r is almost zero (r = 0.0001).

As one would expect, many common infectious diseases spread more rapidly at a high population density than at a low population density. Figure 5 illustrates the time series of the mean numbers 5 of infectives for different population sizes n = 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, and 3500. We can see that when population density is relatively low (n = 1500, 2000) , the infection levels are relatively low during the entire simulation and decline slowly in the later stages. This suggests that the epidemic died out eventually. In the and 400 at last. For n = 3000 and 3500, the infection numbers reach to a very high level and then drop rapidly. The collapse is because that so many infectives are removed from the model that the pool of infectives shrinks. For clarity, we also plot the fractions of infectives in the population vs. time in Fig. 6 . Clearly, in late stages of the epidemic, the fractions are greater when \u03b2 is great than when \u03b2 is small. In summary, HIV/AIDS infection is more likely to persist at higher population densities. This is due to that with the population density increasing, the population contact rate rise, leading to increases in the probability of infection. Early work (see, e.g., Rhodes and Anderson 1996) suggests that there is a threshold below which the epidemic would eventually dies out and above which it would persist.

In the last case of p m max = 0.009, the infection level fluctuates above 300, higher than those of other cases. So we conclude that mobility plays a significant role in the dynamics. It could explain why Chinese government took rather strong measures to control the migratory people and quarantine the infectives or the suspects during the outbreak of SARS in the spring of 2003.

It is clearly greater than that of the case with 1 \u00d7 1 Moore neighborhood in which the level only reach about 100. Such result suggests that with wider neighborhood, an agent is more likely to get influenced by its neighbors and therefore the likelihood of getting infected increases accordingly.

Usually, heterogeneous mixing will make the dynamics more complicated and unpredictable. In the following, we assume the whole population is divided into four different groups as shown in Table 2 . As shown in Table 2 , Class P0 has very low infectivity, low susceptibility, and 1 \u00d7 1 von Neumann neighborhood. It can represents children and (or) elders in the population who hardly infect others and are easy to be infected. Class PL refers to ordinary people who have relatively low infectivity and high resistibility (therefore low susceptibility). In our model, this class amounts to a large fraction of the whole population. Class PH and Class PH+ can represent the two high-risk groups observed in real life. Agents of Class PH have high infectivity and low resistibility duo to their high-risk behaviors like incautious sex without protection, needle sharing, unhygienic blood transfusion and so on. The biased 0 \u00d7 1 (or 1\u00d70) von Neumann neighborhood captures their potential oriented or biased behaviors. In contrast, Agents of Class PH+ with both higher infectivity and higher susceptibility represent those who are, although being in the minority, the most dangerous and malevolent group. Such group does exist in real life. For instance, some crimes were reported in China in recent years that a few AIDS infectives intentionally have sex with innocent people or shot people with contaminated syringes in public places. They blame their infection on the society and the government for not being able to provide necessary health service and compensating too little. The 2 \u00d7 2 Moore neighborhood indicates their intensive influence on others. We distinguish Class PH+ from Class PH in order to see whether such malevolent behaviors have significant impacts on the spread of HIV/AIDS and to what extent. While such rough classification may be incorrect or even erroneous, it surely is reasonable and well supported by our extended CA model. Table 3 gives the values of f i and R i used in the following simulations. As we will see later, the results generated with this classification are fairly consistent with those obtained through empirical work. Figure 10 gives a typical simulation result in the four-class scenario. The fractions of four classes here are: n P0 = 0.1, n PL = 0.7, n PH = 0.1, and n PH+ = 0.1.

The differences are so small that we cannot assure with confidence whether changes in susceptibility have impact on the epidemic dynamics. The possible reasons, we believe, are twofold: First, the role played by susceptibility may be not as decisive as the above factors.

In addition, components of a conventional CA system such as topological forms of grid, the definition of neighborhood, and state transition rules are simple and unchanged over time. This makes the modeling of complicated dynamics such as HIV/AIDS transmission difficult and uncontrollable. In this paper, we have developed an extended CA model to capture key epidemiological and clinical features of HIV/AIDS epidemic. First, We explicitly models and simulates the whole progression of HIV/AIDS disease (i.e., infected but not infectious, infectious but asymptomatic, symptomatic, and deceased). Such improvement can give us a better understanding of the dynamics during the entire HIV/AIDS epidemics. In order to examine various degrees of influence between agents, we have introduced an extended definition of neighborhood to represent the intensity and bias of influence. This lets us gain insight into how various degrees of interactions affects the HIV/AIDS epidemics.

After crossing some critical point, the regime generated could change from dying-out to persistence at some point.
