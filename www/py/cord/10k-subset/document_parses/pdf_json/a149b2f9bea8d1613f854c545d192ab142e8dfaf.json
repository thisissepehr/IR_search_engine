It was shown to be a 36-kDa glycoprotein with an N-linked carbohydrate moiety. The circular dichromoism spectrum of CEACAM10 in 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 appeared as one negative band arising from the \u2424 form at 217 nm. CEA-CAM10 was expressed predominantly in seminal vesicles of adult mice. Both CEACAM10 and its mRNA were demonstrated on the luminal epithelium of the mucosal folds in the seminal vesicle. The amount of Ceacam10 mRNA in the seminal vesicle was correlated with the stage of animal maturation. Castration of adult mice resulted in cessation of Ceacam10 expression, while treatment of castrated mice with testosterone propionate in corn oil restored Ceacam10 expression in the seminal vesicle. During the entire course of pregnancy, Ceacam10 might be silent in the embryo. A cytochemical study illustrated the presence of the CEACAM10 binding region on the entire surface of mouse sperm. CEACAM10-sperm binding greatly enhanced sperm motility in vitro. male reproductive tract, seminal vesicles, sperm motility and transport",

            "text": "The seminal vesicle is a male accessory sexual gland found in many species of more than 4000 mammalian species alive on the earth today. After puberty, the gland se- cretes a fluid called seminal vesicle secretion (SVS), which accumulates in its lumen. SVS contains both protein and nonprotein components. When ejaculated, SVS squirts into the urethra, contributing the major part of the liquid portion of seminal plasma, which is the complex biological fluid formed from mixing of various fluid in the male reproductive tract. It has been found that extirpation of the seminal vesicle from mice and rats greatly reduces fertility [7, 8] , demonstrating the importance of SVS to sperm modification under natural circumstances. SVS differs extensively in terms of volume and composition in various species of mammals. However, rodents have proven to be good experimental animals for the molecular study of mammalian reproduction, so attempts have been made to isolate the proteins involved in sperm modification by mouse SVS, which contains several minor proteins and seven well-defined major proteins designated SVS I-VII, named in decreasing order of molecular mass according to their mobility in SDS-PAGE [9] . Previously, we demonstrated that SVS VII enhances sperm motility [10] , and two of the minor proteins modulate sperm activity. One is a caltrin-like trypsin inhibitor/P12, which suppresses Ca 2\u03e9 uptake by sperm [11] , and the other is a seminal vesicle autoantigen, which serves as a decapacitation factor [12, 13] .",

The actual yield of the two sequences in an individual cycle was such that the ratio of the major sequence to the minor one was estimated to be 2.5-3.0:1. Assembly of the major and minor sequences gave a peptide sequence of AQVTVEAVPPXVTA and QVTVEAVPPXVTA, respectively. The three N-terminal peptides were completely confirmed in the Ceacam10-deduced protein consisting of 265 amino acid residues in all positions except that X (asparagine), one potential site for an N-linked carbohydrate in CEACAM10, was not identified in the protein sequencing (Fig. 2B) . The post-translational cleavage at the peptide bond between Glu and Ala, Thr and Ala, or Ala and Gln in the signal peptide of the putative CEACAM10 sequence gives rise to a peak a protein or to peak b-to-d proteins. As a result, peaks a to d share a very similar protein core with a slight difference in their N-terminal sequences. Thereafter, we combined them for further study. Among the SVS protein components on SDS-PAGE gel, antibody against CEA-CAM10 immunoreacted only to a 36-kDa protein band corresponding to the antigen, showing high specificity of the antibody.

Induction of Ceacam10 mRNA was observed in the castrates treated with testosterone (5 mg/kg per day) for 8 consecutive days.

No fluorescence was observed on the cells after they were treated successively with the CEACAM10 antibody and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, demonstrating a lack of CEA-CAM10 on the cell surface. When spermatozoa were preincubated with 1 M CEACAM10 in a blocking solution at room temperature for 45 min, rhodamine fluorescence was prominent on the middle piece, relatively weak on the tail, and faint on the head (Fig. 7A, d) . Apparently, sperm have CEACAM10-binding sites that cover the entire cell surface. To access the binding of CEACAM10 to epididymal sperm upon ejaculation, the ejaculated sperm were directly stained with the antibody. CEACAM10 was immunodetected on the surface of the ejaculated sperm, in spite of high fluorescence background due to the free CEA-CAM10 that was difficult to removed completely during cell preparation (Fig. 7B, d) .",

According to the molecular model established by Watt et al. [30] and Tan et al.

In the CEACAM10 molecule, residues 2-96 form one IgV-like domain and residues 122-216 form another [14] . This may account for the characteristic CD shown in Figure 2C . Many members of the murine and human CEACAM family contain either a transmembrane domain or a glycosyl PtdIns moiety, but no such structural element is present in the Ceacam10-deduced protein sequence, suggesting that CEACAM10 is not a membrane-bound protein [32] .

(Fig.  5B ) may arise from the maternal decidua as suggested in the study by Finkenzeller et al. [33] . This finding, together with the lack of an RNA message in embryo samples at 4.5 and 10.5-18.5 d.p.c. (Fig. 5B) implies that Ceacam10 might be weakly expressed if not silent during the entire course of embryonic development.

Cytochemical observations shown in Figure 7 suggest the presence of CEACAM10-binding sites on the entire sperm surface. Considering the presence of CEACAM1 on human sperm cells [34] , it raises a possibility that heterophilic adhesion exists between CEACAM10 and other CEACAM molecules on the mouse sperm surface. This is unlike the action of other sperm motility effectors in the mouse SVS, such as SVS VII, which binds neutral phospholipid to enhance sperm motility [10] , and SVA, which predominantly binds membrane phosphatidylcholine to suppress sperm motility [12] .",

Tissue slices were histochemically stained for CEACAM10 with antibody against the protein, biotin-conjugate goat anti-rabbit IgG, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin a. The specimens were stained as in a except that the antibody was replaced by normal serum (b). For contrast, the specimens were further stained with Nuclear Fast Red. Photographs were taken with brightfield illumination. MF, mucosal fold; SM, smooth muscle; LF, luminal fluid. The staining of Nuclear Fast Red is in pink and the signals of CEACAM10 protein, demonstrated by staining of alkaline phosphatase activity, are in dark blue. Bar \u03ed 20 m. B) Demonstration of Ceacam10 mRNA in the luminal epithelial cells of the seminal vesicle. The epithelial cells of MF or SM cells in a tissue slice (8 m) of mouse seminal vesicle were selectively captured and transferred to films by LCM. The tissue slides before and after LCM were stained and observed (see text for details). A Ceacam10 cDNA fragment (237 bp) or a Gapd cDNA fragment (557 bp) was amplified from the total RNA of MF or SM by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The level of Gapd mRNA was used as an internal control. Bar \u03ed 100 m.",
