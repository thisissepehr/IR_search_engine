Several well described autoimmune disease models exist In the Lewis rat and thus this particular rat strain provides a good model system to study the effect of competitor peptldes. So far no Information has been available on the peptide binding characteristics of the Lewis rat MHC class II RT1.B 1 molecule.

Notably, most of the autoimmune disease associated peptide sequences tested were found to be Intermediate to poor binders. Single amino acid substitutions at defined positions were sufficient to turn certain peptldes Into good binders.

It has recently been observed that in vivo T cell activation can be prevented by co-immunization with stimulator peptide and MHC binding competitor peptides (8) . Successful attempts to interfere with the onset or occurrence of autoimmune diseases by immunization with non-pathogenic competitor peptides have been achieved in the rodent EAE model (13) (14) (15) (16) . The Lewis rat presents an ideal model species for studying autoimmune diseases since a number of experimental autoimmune diseases can be induced in this rat strain. Disease associated T cell determinants in the Lewis rat have been defined for most models (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) 26) and, with a single exception, the different autoimmune T cell responses are restricted to the same MHC class II specificity, RT1 .B 1 . The same competitor peptide specific for RT1.B 1 can therefore be studied in several different autoimmune diseases models in the same experimental animal strain. However, to identify such RT1.B 1 binding competitor peptides and to understand the possible mechanism of action it becomes essential to measure directty the binding of competitor peptides to MHC class II molecules as well as the binding of peptides involved in activating autoreactive T cell responses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 282, "end": 285, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 472, "end": 476, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 477, "end": 481, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 482, "end": 486, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 487, "end": 491, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 749, "end": 753, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 754, "end": 758, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 759, "end": 763, "text": "(19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 764, "end": 768, "text": "(20)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 769, "end": 773, "text": "(21)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 774, "end": 778, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 779, "end": 782, "text": "26)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our currently used method employs the detection of biotinylated peptides by chemiluminescence, whereby we have achieved stable and non-reactive labelling of peptides, yet maintained the required sensitivity. The assay has been established for both the mouse I-E d and the rat RT1.B 1 . The results obtained show sensitive and allele-specific binding. The method enables competition studies in which the relative binding affinities of a set of non-labelled peptides can be easily assessed. The assay is thus especially useful for the screening of sets of peptides, looking for good binders, in its present form it is less well suited for kinetic studies. A particular asset of the analysis is that it solves the problem of high non-specific backgrounds observed for some peptides in the gel filtration analysis, due to aggregation of peptide molecules. When starting with a not yet tested MHC specificity this can severely hamper the search for good binders. The high separation power of the SDS-PAGE analysis circumvents this problem. Furthermore, the sensitivity of our test system is high allowing the use of very low concentrations of labelled marker peptide, comparable to what is used in peptide binding assays based on radiolabelled peptides (34, 35) . This is in contrast to the high concentrations of labelled peptide necessary to detect binding of biotin labelled peptide to whole cells and detected by FACS analysis (38,39 and M. H. M. Wauben etal., unpublished results). The very high concentration of labelled peptides needed to perform the direct binding assay based on FACS analysis makes it difficult to convert the assay into the versatile competition assay, something which can reliably be achieved with the present assay. Recently, potentially very useful biotin based assays have been developed (40 -42) . It should be noted, however, that the successful outcome of these latter assays is in part dependent on the particular combination of MHC specificity and anti-class II mAb. To be more specific, the conformational binding properties of the mAb and MHC molecules can interfere in the measurements of MHC -peptide complex formation. In a species like the rat where a very limited choice of mAb is available, this could seriously hinder the development of a binding assay. In our present study this is of no concern.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1248, "end": 1252, "text": "(34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1253, "end": 1256, "text": "35)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1822, "text": "(40 -42)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The results obtained with the biochemical competition assay were confirmed by functional competition assay for both the mouse and the rat systems.

Secondly, from the peptides with direct disease inducing potential, the guinea pig MBP 72-85 peptide and the IRBP 1181-1191 peptide, the MBP peptide was found to be a high 'intermediate' binder, as opposed to the IRBP peptide, which was a very poor binder. Also the immunodominant AChR epitope and the secundary IRBP and MBE epitopes were found to be poor binders. Notwithstanding their apparent poor binding affinity, these peptides have the potential to play crucial roles in the development of the disease (20, 22, 24) . It was argued by Lamont etal. (43) and Wall etal. (44) that in the mouse EAE model MHC binding affinity is correlated with encephalitogenicity and that a high MHC binding affinity may be a necessary characteristic of an encephaiitogenic determinant. In our study it appears that in the Lewis rat the major encephaiitogenic determinants are intermediary binders, i.e. ~ 10-fold less effective than the highest binder, the non-autoimmune disease related OVA peptide. Furthermore, a substitution analog of MBP 72-85 with about tenfold increased MHC binding affinity (MBP72-85ST9-A) and capable of inducing disease did not show an increased encephaiitogenic potential as compared to the natural sequence (M. H. M. Wauben etal., submitted for publication), suggesting that at least in this model high MHC binding affinity is not directly correlated with disease inducing potential. The finding that the natural peptide sequences relevant for the AA, EAU and EAMG models were low-intermediates to poor binders, is more in line with the work of Gammon and Sercarz (45) , in which it is hypothesized that pathogenic determinants on self antigens resemble so-called minor determinants and are poorty presented, resulting in the evasion of tolerance induction by T cells with specificity for these determinants. In view of the results from the mouse EAE model (43, 44) , it is of importance to establish to what degree this concept is dependent on the particular disease and/or self antigen involved.
