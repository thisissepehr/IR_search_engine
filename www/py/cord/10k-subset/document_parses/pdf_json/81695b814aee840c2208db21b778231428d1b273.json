Researchers believe that avian influenza has potential to evolve into one of the deadliest pandemics. Combating these diseases requires in-depth knowledge of their epidemiology. An effective methodology for discovering epidemiological knowledge is to utilize a descriptive, evolutionary, ecological model and use bio-simulations to study and analyze it. These types of bio-simulations fall under the category of computational evolutionary methods because the individual entities participating in the simulation are permitted to evolve in a natural manner by reacting to changes in the simulated ecosystem. This work describes the application of the aforementioned methodology to discover epidemiological knowledge about avian influenza using a novel eco-modeling and bio-simulation environment called SEARUMS. The mathematical principles underlying SEARUMS, its design, and the procedure for using SEARUMS are discussed. The bio-simulations and multi-faceted case studies conducted using SEARUMS elucidate its ability to pinpoint timelines, epicenters, and socio-economic impacts of avian influenza. This knowledge is invaluable for proactive deployment of countermeasures in order to minimize negative socioeconomic impacts, combat the disease, and avert a pandemic.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Communicable and vector-borne diseases, primarily induced by viral and bacterial infections, are the most common forms of ailments amongst humans and domesticated farm animals [1] . Despite numerous advances in epidemiology and medicine many of these diseases continue to defy human efforts to treat and control them [1] . The source of such resistance to treatment and control is two fold. First, the incessant evolutionary processes such as genetic reassortment, recombination, and mutation induce changes to organisms, thereby constantly morphing their antigenic characteristics. Second, the vectors of the disease, such as birds and animals, often disperse the pathogens over wide areas. The scenario is further convoluted due to comphcated symbiotic processes between the vectors and other organisms including humans. Rapid changes in phytogeny and bio-diversity pose significant challenges in vaccine manufacturing. In addition, sociopolitical restrictions and technological limitations further magnify the challenges involved in controlhng intercontinental spread of infectious diseases.

Migrating waterfowl are the primary vectors of the H5N1 virus [18] . They indirectly transmit the vims to poultry in their vicinity through infected food, water, and feces [19, 20] . The disease is transmitted to humans that come in direct contact with contaminated surfaces or infected poultry [21] . In other words, the transmission of infections is determined both by space and time. Consequently, an epidemiological model needs to incorporate temporo-spatial interactions between the aforementioned three entities. Accordingly, we have developed our conceptual model using spatially explicit, discrete-time Markov processes as described further below [22] . Note that, since the goal of this section is to present factors steering the design and implementation of SEARUMS, it does not delve into mathematical detafls that are available in the literature [10] . The proposed conceptual model consists of a set of interacting entities. An entity may represent a flock of waterfowl, poultry, or confederation of humans. Each entity is mathematically modeled by a corresponding Markov process. A Markov process undeigoes instantaneous, probabilistic state transitions to reflect the behavior of its real-world counterpart [10] . Temporal state transitions induce changes to state variables, which in this case include population counts, location, infection percentage, and migration attributes. These changes corresponding various conditions such as: migration, healing or regeneration, and death or reduction in population. In conjunction with temporal changes, spatial interactions between entities are also captured as state transition probabilities. The spatial interactions, that occur in a spatially explicit models, have been mathematically modeled using principles of Euclidean geometry [23] . The surface of the earth is represented as an Euclidean plane and each entity has a circular area of influence. Interactions between entities occur when their circle of influence overlaps. Interactions between entities and the degree of overlap are used to model the intensity and spread of infection.

The first platform was a Sun Netra-T12 SMP workstation with eight 1.2 GHz SPARCv9 processors with 16 gigabytes of RAM running Solaris 9. The second platform was a conventional personal computer (PC) running Windows XP (32-bit). The PC had a dual-core, 64-bit Turion processor running at 2 GHz with 2 GB of memory. The third platform was the same PC but running Linux (Fedora Core). Specifically, the PC was setup to a dual-boot configuration enabling it to run either Windows XP or Linux.

As shown by the curves, initially the time taken for simulation reduces as the number of threads are increased. The wall-clock time decreases because the threads run in parallel on the multiprocessor/multi-core machines and rapidly process concurrent events. The initial performance improvement highlights SEARUMS' scalability. However, the performance decreases as the number of threads are further increased. The deterioration occurs because the Eco-description used in this experiment does not have sufficient, inherent concurrency to leverage the available compute power On the other hand, larger models with more concurrency will benefit from the scalable design.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 13, "end": 21, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Description of AgentType"}, {"text": "These experiments highlight the portability, scalability, and performance aspects of SEARUMS design.

The three flocks were chosen based on their close proximity to known primary sites of disease outbreaks. The initial infection in each experimental group was varied for analysis. In all these experiments, the initial conditions were seeded corresponding to January 1, 2006 and the simulations were run for a period of 5 years. Figure 3 illustrates one of the trans-Atlantic transmission pathways to the continental United States. We observed that the spread was determined by migratory pathways and timelines of different | species of waterfowl rather than initial in-f fection percentages. One of the notable ob-1 servations is that our experiments correctly predicted an outbreak in the United Kingdom [4] . The graph in Figure 4 presents the impact of avian influenza outbreaks on poultry population in continental United States. Decrease in poultry population corresponds to H5N1 induced death and culhng of birds to control the disease. Increase in poultry population reflects regeneration of poultry flocks after an outbreak. As illustrated by the graph, infections in poultry also follow a cychc pattern that correlate with annual migration of waterfowl.

The verification experiments highlight that the proposed methodology closely reflects real world scenarios. The bio-simulations conducted using SEARUMS provide good forecast of time lines and epicenters of outbreaks. Furthermore, it was observed that outbreaks follow a cyclical, annual pattern.
