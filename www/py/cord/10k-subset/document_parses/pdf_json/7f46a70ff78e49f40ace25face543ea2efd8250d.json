Two principal classes of I~NA fragments are present: ~) A larger class comprising 74.9--85.4 per cent of total RNA and consisting of fragments having molecular weights ranging from 0.5 \u2022 106 to considerably greater than 3.0 \u2022 106 da]tons and, b) A smaller class comprising 9.1--19.7 per cent of total I~NA with the size approximately that of ribosomal r S I~NA.",

Final purification was achieved by the use of isopyenie centrifugation.

I~NA was extracted from three IBV preparations purified in either sucrose (A and C) or potassium tartarate density gradients (B). In preparation A, the initial allantoic fluid was first treated with deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease (each at 1 ~tg per ml) for 1 hour at 25 ~ C before purification. 3I-I ribosomal marker I%NA (0.2 m]) and 100 ~g of yeast carrier RIgA were added and total lgNA's from each were precipitated, as described above, and resuspended in 0.5 ml NET buffer. Each preparation was then centrifuged through pre-formed 4.8 ml 5--20 per cent sucrose gradients (A, B and C) prepared in NET for 60 (C) or 90 minutes (A and B) at 65,000 r.p.m, using a Spinco SW65 rotor. Fractions of 0.2 ml were collected, placed onto paper strips and the acid-insoluble radioactivity present was determined. The profile for each gradient is shown in Figure 4 . As a Irrespective of the purification procedure used, the results indicate that the nucleic acid of IBV is extremely heterogeneous, being comprised of a range of species spread throughout the gradients. Because of its sensitivity to ribonuclease (C) and UV absorbance profile (Fig. 3) , the genetic material of IBV is undoubtedly P~NA and further confirmation is provided by its buoyant density in caesium sulphate (see Fig. 8 ).",

Fractions of 0.1 ml were collected and the density of each determined from its refractive index. Each fraction was then diluted to 0.4 ml with NET and an 0.2 ml volume placed onto a paper strip for the determination of acid-insoluble radioactivity. The remaining 0.2 ml of each Iraetion was treated with 1 ~g of ribonuelease for 1 hour at 25 ~ C and radioactivity remaining then estimated in the same manner. The results shown in Figure 8 , indicate that IBV RNA has a distribution in the equilibrium gradient identical with that of TMV RNA, having a peak at 1.65 g/cc, which is characteristic of other single-stranded RNA molecules (EI~IKSON and FRANKLIN, 1966) . This peak is greatly reduced in the presence of ribonuelease. The RNA of IBV differs from all these viruses in that the great proportion of its RIgA (74.9--85.4 per cent) consists of large, extremely heterogeneous fragments. Such an lgNA profile has been obtained from all freshly prepared IBV preparations examined and from one prepared from virus after 72 hours of allantoic growth. With fowl plague RNA, prepared from virus purified after differing times of growth, differences in the sizes and amounts of various RNA classes have been described and a similar heterogeneity noted (BARRY et al., 1970) .",

With I~ous sarcoma (RSV) (Du~.s:a~RG, 1968) and other leukoviruses, apparent continuity in the principal I~NA components is maintained by regions of base pairing between RNA fragments, which are readily disrupted by gentle heating or the action of RNA denaturants. I~SV contains, in addition, significant amounts of 4S RNA and smaller quantities of 7S, 18S and 28S I~NA's (Bishop et al., 1970).
