A variety of stresses, such as changes in food and environment, can trigger off enteric ~~ba~o~ resulting in weanhmg diarrhoea and oedema disease (Morris, 19&1 ). An important component iu weanling diarrhoea is enterotoxigenic E. co& (ETEC) induced hypersecretion, resulting from fluid secretion from the crypt cells and inhibition of absorption from the villous cells (Cox et aZ., 1988) . What may also be important in the pathogenesis of ETEC diarrhoea, however, is a change in intestinal motility. In rabbits, an alteration in small-intestinal myoelectric activity and motility was observed after intraluminal application of live ETEC bacteria or enterotoxin (Burns et al., l978,1980) .",

In conscious goats, sheep and rabbits, several hours of inhibition of gastrointestinal motility has been described following i.v. injection of a low dose (0.1 pg/kg) of endotoxin (Van Miert, 1971 ; Duranton and BuCno, 1984, Pioramonti et aZ., 1984) . This disturbance of the motility pattern may result in retching and profuse diarrhoea in animals suffering from shock (Lohuis ef al., 1988) . Infusion of high doses (2.5 mg kg-' h-') of endotoxin in piglets resulted in death from shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) within 8-22 h following the start of the experiment in 6 out of 9 animals, without the occurrence of diarrhoea. Of the three surviving piglets one developed diarrhoea (Schrauwen et aZ., 1986) . The aim of the present study, therefore, was to examine the primary signs of disease in the conscious piglet after i.v. bolus injection of low and moderate doses of LPS (0.1, 1 and 10 pg/kg) by measurement of rectal temperature, clinical appearance and some haematological parameters and to compare the timing of these with observations of gastrointestinal myoelectrical activity.",

No statistical analysis was performed therefore. The individual values are presented in Table I but these reveal inconsistent results: one pig did not manifest an obvious effect on its leukocyte count, whereas the other one displayed a severe leukopenia. As regards their leukocyte formula, both animals showed a pronounced increase in band neutrophils and a decrease in lymphocytes, with a maximal ratio for individual piglets of 81/7 and 75/17 at 4 and 5 h after injection, respectively. In one pig, an increase in PCV was observed, whereas the other one displayed a decrease. In both animals the sedimentation rate was clearly accelerated (Table I ) and the thrombocyte counts were decreased.",

Fast oscillations were observed at an interburst frequency of 2.43 2 O.O8/min, about 50% of the ECA. Control small-intestinal recordings displayed the normal pattern of migrating myoelectrical complexes (MMC), consisting of phase I, phase II and phase III activities. Duodenal, jejunal and ileal MMC recycled at 59 + 1, 63 -e 1 and 78 + 1 min intervals, respectively. However, significant differences between pigs were observed. Following a duodenal phase III, complete (abolition of ECA and ERA) or partial (abolition of ERA) inhibition of antral myoelectrical activity was observed. During the period of hyperthermia following the injection of 0.1 pg/kg endotoxin, there was no significant alteration in the control pattern of antral phasic activity, nor in its integrated value. The phasic recordings from the duodenum showed a significant prolongation of phase I for 3 h following injection, with a maximum of 18.9 f 12.4 min during the second hour as compared with a control value of 5.8 + 1.3 min, but this was apparently insufficiently pronounced to induce a significant change in the integrated activity.",

The basic electrical rhythm or ECA only remained in the sheep. These authors, however, make no mention of the time constant used in their gastric recordings. Applying the same constant as that used for intestinal recordings (0.03 s) may cause filtering out of part of the ECA, ERA and smaller fast oscillations. In this way, following LPS injection, only elimination of larger fast oscillations could be detected. The absence of fast oscillations, however, is no sure indication of the absence of a contraction, for which ERA are the best indicators (Laplace and Roman, 1979; Laplace, 1980) . However, ERA are more difficult to identify and an acceptable relationship between the presence and amplitude of fast oscillations and contractions has been reported (Ruckebusch et al., 1981) . Therefore we evaluated fast oscillations, so giving an estimate of the minimal contraction frequency present. Following i.v. injection of the higher doses of LPS, 1 and 10 pg/kg, we observed only partial inhibition of antral EMG activity, especially of the fast oscillations which were superimposed on ERA.",

            "text": "In the present experiments, a possible altered pattern of duodenal activity was observed in only one of the three pigs at the dose of 10 pg/kg. However, to our knowledge this did not resemble any of the previously described alterations. Particular altered patterns of small-intestinal electrical activity have been described as characteristic of a diarrhoeal state (Laplace, 1984) and as resembling the effect of vibrio c/r&rue as well as of E. coli enterotoxins (Mathias et al., 1976 (Mathias et al., , 1982 Burns et aZ., 1978 , 1980 , Koch et al., 1983 . Our results agree with the absence of diarrhoea after the administration of any dose of LPS. Kurtz and Quast (1982) , on the other hand, reported the development of severe diarrhoea in pigs of 30 kg within 2-6 h of the start of a 48-h infusion of sublethal doses of LPS, 15.4-16.5 pg kg-' h-'. In those animals, necropsy revealed oedema and infarction of the gastrointestinal wall due to intravascular thrombi. The question therefore arises whether possible alterations of EMG activity and/or diarrhoea following high doses of endotoxin in the pig could not result from ischaemia and/or release of mediators such as PAF (Hsueh et aI., 1987; Whittle et aZ., 1987; Esplugues and Whittle, 1989) or eicosanoids, preceding and/or following DIC in the intestinal circulation.",
