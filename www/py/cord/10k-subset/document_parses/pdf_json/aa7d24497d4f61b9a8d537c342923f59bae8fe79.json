Increasingly, large libraries of chemically synthesized, double-stranded small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or transcribed short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are employed in cellular models to interrogate relationships between each target in the library and the phenotypes in question, and such approaches are very likely to yield insights leading to the identification of novel therapeutic targets or modulators of key cellular processes [2] .

While most early studies had chosen viral targets for RNA interference, recent efforts have increasingly focused on RNAi-mediated inhibition of host cellular proteins required for viral infection due to the realization that a variety of viral responses substantially minimize siRNA effects. With the application of siRNA approaching, many new cellular targets relevant to HIV infection have been identified (Table 1) . These newly identified cellular proteins offer great potential in the development of both siRNA and other types of drugs in the treatment of HIV infection. Several recent review papers provide comprehensive information regarding the potential of viral targets of siRNAs in inhibiting viral infections [9] [10] [11] [12] . This article focuses on the therapeutic potential of RNAi against cellular targets of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, initially describing the disadvantages of viral targets and then introducing some of the cellular proteins that have been studied using siRNA approaches to combat viral infections. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Early studies employing siRNA against viral infections mainly focused on viral genes. Nevertheless, the realization that there are divergent mechanisms for developing viral immunization from RNA interference led instead to the evaluation of cellular targets of viral infections. The identification of the physiological and pathological roles of cellular proteins that facilitate viral infections not only directly provides candidate targets for RNA interference, but also offers drug development targets for strategies such as antisense RNA, antibody, or other small molecules. As listed in Table 1 , a large assortment of cellular proteins involved in viral entry into cells, viral RNA integration into the human genome, viral replication, viral packaging, and viral release, have been tested as potential targets for efficiently inhibiting HIV infection by siRNA technology (Fig. 1) . The identification of large number of novel cellular targets involved in HIV infections is greatly appreciated the development of different sized siRNA libraries ( Table 2 ). The growing availability of siRNA libraries for high-throughput screening will accelerate the discovery of additional cellular targets of HIV infection. For example, Nguyen et al. recently performed a subgenomic screen using an siRNA library targeting 500 genes in HeLaCD4bpal cells challenged with HIV type IIIb [30] . In addition to confirming the involvement of furin in HIV replication, this screen revealed two novel cellular targets, Pak1 and Pak3. Overexpression of constitutively active Pak1 enhanced HIV IIIb infectivity while the knockdown of both targets decreased the amount of integrated HIV provirus. While the exact mechanisms for how these two targets help HIV replication are not currently known, HIV may utilize these Paks to enhance multiple stages of the viral life cycles.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 834, "end": 837, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 838, "end": 842, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 843, "end": 847, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 848, "end": 852, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1168, "end": 1172, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1173, "end": 1177, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1178, "end": 1182, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1183, "end": 1187, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1188, "end": 1192, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1193, "end": 1197, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1198, "end": 1202, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1203, "end": 1207, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1208, "end": 1212, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1213, "end": 1217, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1218, "end": 1222, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1227, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1228, "end": 1232, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1233, "end": 1237, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1238, "end": 1242, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1243, "end": 1247, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1248, "end": 1252, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2630, "end": 2634, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 521, "end": 530, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1846, "end": 1853, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2131, "end": 2139, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2306, "end": 2313, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Among cellular targets, the chemokine receptor, CCR5 is one of the few cellular exceptions that have been widely studied by different strategies including RNA interference.

There are at least three known mechanisms employed by viruses to escape from RNA interference.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral Responses to RNA Interference"}, {"text": "The first mechanism is silencing suppression and exists in both plant and animal viruses. By encoding silencing suppressors such as B2, NS1, VA1 RNA, and E3L, certain viruses can efficiently inhibit key components of the RNA silencing pathways [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Some suppressors can also regulate host gene expression. The second mechanism is silencing evasion. Silencing evasion could result from silencing-related ribonucleases that help to keep the viral genome away from siRNAs [36] . Another possibility for silencing evasion might be related to some viral genomes becoming intrinsically resistant to RNA degradation [37] . In contrast to the previous two mechanisms, the third mechanism called silencing immunizations requires a relatively short time adaptation and results in a rapid and widespread resistance mechanism against RNA interference. Although siRNA may be effective at the beginning, its effect can be progressively dampened by viral mutation at the target site. Alternatively, if a target site mutation is not tolerable for viral function the neighboring sequences can be mutated to change the secondary structure of the target region and thereby enable it to escape siRNA-triggered degradation [38] [39] [40] [41] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 244, "end": 248, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 249, "end": 253, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 254, "end": 258, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 259, "end": 263, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 264, "end": 268, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 491, "end": 495, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 631, "end": 635, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1224, "end": 1228, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1229, "end": 1233, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1234, "end": 1238, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1239, "end": 1243, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral Responses to RNA Interference"}, {"text": "High mutation rate of HIV has been an obstacle in chemotherapy for AIDS.

The siRNA, double strands RNA, and shRNA need to penetrate the cell membrane before they are able to perform RNA interference. The RNA interference mediated by double strands RNA is DICER dependent, whereas the effects of exogenous siRNA and shRNA are DICER independent, which is similar to the mechanism of microRNA that cleaves RNA by RISC genes or mutation of the silencing targets can enable viruses to replicate under RNA silencing pressure. The recognition of viral resistance to RNAi prompted strategies in evaluation of cellular co-factors required for HIV infection. In contrast to viral targets, RNAi against cellular targets may provide a more persistent inhibition to viral infection. In order to overcome the high mutation rate of HIV, recent efforts in screening new cellular targets of RNA interference show promises in viral replication. At the in vitro cultured cell level, many promising cellular targets pertinent to HIV infection have been validated. Further evaluation of these cellular targets by knockdown technologies may pave a new avenue for viral therapy as well as provide leads for the development of other small molecule therapeutic agents. Finally, RNA interference can be used to quickly screen the potential synergistic effect of knockdown of more than one cellular target in inhibiting HIV replication. This is important as it may substantially minimize cellular toxicity and enhance its effects against HIV replication. In addition to different host genes in CD4 cells, targeting to different cellular genes at different cells may be of importance.

These factors capture small amounts of HIV-1 found on mucosal surfaces and spread the viral infection to CD4(+) T cells. Arrighi et al. developed shRNAexpressing lentiviral vectors capable of conditionally suppressing DC-SIGN expression [51]. As expected, suppression of DC-SIGN expression inhibited the attachment of the HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein to DC-SIGN transfectants, as well as transfer of HIV-1 to target cells in trans.
