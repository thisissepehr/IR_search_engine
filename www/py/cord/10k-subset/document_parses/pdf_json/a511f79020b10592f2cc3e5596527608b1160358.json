It is known that egg production decreases over time, while animal maintenance costs remain stable. It would, however, be desirable to keep hens as long as possible to obtain maximal amounts of antibodies. To identify a suitable length of time that animals can be kept and to optimize the cost:yield ratio, we monitored the number of eggs laid, the total amount of chicken IgY, and the specific antibody titer from individually prepared eggs over a 2-yr period. The plant toxin ricin and the Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins type A and B were used to immunize 4 chickens. The number of eggs laid in 2 yr was approximately 600 per hen (about 80% of the maximum egg number), yielding about 20 to 40 g of total IgY per hen. A stable antibody titer of 1:100,000 to 1:1,000,000, as measured by ELISA, was obtained following up to 11 injections of 10 to 20 \u00b5g of immobilized native toxin. Laying capacities were found to decrease, on average, from 7 eggs/wk at the point of first immunization to 2 eggs/wk after more than 2 yr. In parallel, the yield of total and specific IgY increased over time, so that the antibody recovery remained high, even after prolonged immunization times. Using purified IgY preparations, classical immunological assays such as ELISA and Western blotting were performed. Furthermore, the IgY showed neutralizing capacity when used to block the functional activity of the toxins both in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of the total IgY content over time demonstrated a complex biological oscillation (and the antigen-specific titer), with a shorter time period of around 7 d (circaseptan rhythm). In summary, we successfully immunized chickens with ricin and botulinum neurotoxins and monitored laying capacity, IgY concentration, and specific antibody titer over an extended period of 2 yr.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Immunoglobulin Y technology-the production of polyclonal antibodies in chickens and the extraction from egg yolk-is an innovative and expanding branch of biotechnology. In contrast with the more commonly used mammalian IgG antibodies, IgY antibodies do not activate mammalian complement, nor do they crossreact with Fc-receptors, mammalian rheumatoid factor, or human anti-mouse antibodies, thus eliminating the cause of false-positive results in immunological assays. Moreover, IgY can easily be sampled noninvasively from the egg yolk, compared with the stressful bleeding of animals to obtain serum. From an economical point of view, the antibody production of a hen roughly corresponds to that of a large mammal such as a sheep or goat, whereas maintenance costs are relatively low (Larsson et al., 1993; Schade et al., 2001 Schade et al., , 2005 Zhang, 2003) . Thus, a substantial amount of antibody can be produced from just one hen (up to 40 g of total IgY per chicken per year), of which 1 to 10% can be expected to be antigen-specific (Mine and Kovacs-Nolan, 2002) . This vast quantity of antibodies may pave the way for new fields of application such as immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis.

There are considerable differences in recovery rates of the IgY yield for the Polson method ranging between 15 and 150 mg/egg, and this is in accordance with the 30 to 80 mg of IgY per egg found in our study (Altschuh et al., 1984; Hassl and Aspock, 1988; Gassmann et al., 1990; Bizhanov and Vyshniauskis, 2000; St\u00e5lberg and Larsson, 2001) . Not all of the IgY present in the yolk is purified with the method described by Polson, and more efficient methods are reported (St\u00e5lberg and Larsson, 2001) .

Depending on the toxin, minuscule amounts of the native molecule are poisonous, thereby limiting the use of native toxin for immunization. When we analyzed the number of eggs laid before and after immunization (Figure 1) , we observed no obvious influence on laying capacity after immunization with immobilized native toxins. This was found even when amounts several fold above the lethal dose of the free toxin were used. In particular, chicken 22 (immunized with ricin) was producing at the maximum level (7 eggs/wk) during wk 46 to 73, despite 3 immunizations during that time ( Figure 1B) . We also compared the total number of eggs per year (as shown in Table 1) , with the data available. The performance of ISA Brown is approximately 84 to 88% (corresponding to 308 to 320 eggs/yr), and that of LSL is approximately 83 to 85% (corresponding to 301 to 311 eggs/ yr) (Abrahamsson and Tauson, 1998; Li et al., 1998; Hendrix Genetics, 2006; Lohmann Tierzucht GmbH, 2008) . In our study we used ISA Brown (chickens 19, 21, and 23) and LSL (chicken 22), which produced 304 to 345 eggs in the first year (Table 1) . This is in accordance with the above findings in the literature, but does not account for different housing conditions. The absence of any obvious influence on the laying performance indicates that neither the toxin composition used for immunization nor the FIA had a major impact on the birds' performance. Although our data do not indicate any deleterious effects of the immunization, we cannot completely exclude such an effect because of the small number of birds and the lack of controls in this study. Furthermore, the influence of FCA and FIA as adjuvants for immunization has been the cause of controversial discussion in the previous literature. Bollen and Hau (1999) reported that FCA and FIA caused a significant depression in egg-laying frequency, whereas others found only a minor or transient effect or even failed to notice an influence (Erhard et al., 1997; Schade et al., 2005) .

The finding was evident both for the mean value of the 4 chickens and for the individual chickens (e.g., chicken 22, Figure 3) . Interestingly, the smallest rhythm observed was a 7-d one, the so-called circaseptan rhythm, confirming earlier observations by (Schade et al., 2001) . Circaseptan (or weekly) rhythms have been noted and discussed in the literature; for example, in connection with cardiac mortality, blood pressure, excretion of steroids, as well as in the immune system (Cornelissen et al., 1993; Labrecque et al., 1995; Haus and Smolensky, 1999; Halberg et al., 2003) . We interpreted the 60-d rhythm (observed in Figure 3C ) as an approximate multiple of 7, a finding that was also reported for several components of the immune sys-tem (Haus and Smolensky, 1999) . At present, it is not clear what the biological meaning of the circaseptan rhythm in the IgY content may be. On the one hand, the hen has to ensure a constant IgY concentration to supply all of the offspring with an optimal amount of IgY (Carlander et al., 2001) . On the other hand, however, the fate of more than 90% of yolk IgY is uncertain (Kowalczyk et al., 1985) . It has been estimated that only around 10% of the yolk IgY has importance in the passive immunity of the newly hatched chickens. Thus, it seems that a biological rhythm of IgY would not be a risk for the passive immunity of the hen's offspring. Generally, it would be interesting to understand at the molecular level the synthetic activity of chicken B lymphocytes, in view of a rhythmic production of different amounts of IgY.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 424, "end": 445, "text": "(Schade et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 651, "end": 677, "text": "(Cornelissen et al., 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 678, "end": 701, "text": "Labrecque et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 702, "end": 727, "text": "Haus and Smolensky, 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 728, "end": 749, "text": "Halberg et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 919, "end": 945, "text": "(Haus and Smolensky, 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1186, "end": 1210, "text": "(Carlander et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1292, "end": 1316, "text": "(Kowalczyk et al., 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 284, "end": 293, "text": "Figure 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 796, "end": 805, "text": "Figure 3C", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In addition to differences in IgY production between several breeds of chickens and differences in the extraction procedures used, the observed fluctuation of the IgY content may be an additional reason for the different IgY concentrations in the egg yolk observed by various authors (Bizhanov and Vyshniauskis, 2000 ; St\u00e5lberg and Larsson, 2001; Carlander et al., 2003) .
