Case presentation: We herein reported a case of a 40-year old Chinese non-comorbid man who received conservative treatment for acute type B aortic dissection and progressed to RTAD in a painless manner in a week. After open surgical aortic repair with stented elephant truck technique, the patient survived without obvious complication and cured with a satisfactory outcome in a half-year follow-up. Conclusion: This case indicates that RTAD may present without typical symptoms, early diagnosis and open surgical procedure are imperative for treating RTAD.",

Type A dissection involves the ascending aorta and requires surgical management, while type B dissection does not involve the ascending aorta and requires non-surgical management in most of the cases [1] . Nowadays, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has been used with increasing frequency for management of type B aortic dissection, as it is less invasive and associated with a lower complication rate compared to traditional surgical repair. Moreover, endovascular treatment of type B aortic dissections presented a lower in-hospital mortality rate (10.6%) compared to that of patients under open surgical repair (33.9%) [2] . However, RTAD can be triggered in the fragile aortic wall of acute type B aortic dissection in TEVAR procedure, and it is a fatal complication with up to 42% mortality [3] . On this basis and for risk reduction, two weeks conservative management ahead of TEVAR is recommended in acute type B aortic dissection patients [4] .",

Blood pressure in the right arm was 138/74 mmHg, heart rate was 108 beats per minute and body temperature was 37.3 C degree. The patient received computed tomography angiography (CTA) and it revealed aortic dissection of the descending aorta without pericardial effusion or significant coronary disease.

The false lumen of descending aortic showed crescent-shaped with a thickness of 5 mm (Fig. 1a,  b) . As no poor perfusion, aneurysm, or uncontrolled pain complicated, the patient deemed not to be in need of emergency surgical repair. On this basis, conservative medical therapy was given together with blood pressure and heart rate tight control, as well as hemostasis. The blood pressure was kept less than 110/70 mmHg and the heart rate was maintained below 70 bpm after administration of calcium channel blocker (nifedipine started with 10 mg, three times a day) and beta-blocking agent (metoprolol started with 47.5 mg, once a day), the medicine dosages were adjusted according to the level of blood pressure.

Total replacement of the aortic arch combined with elephant trunk implantation through a median sternotomy under hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was proceeded as explained in earlier studies [6, 7] . Cannulation for CPB was carried out through the right femoral artery and the right atrium. Cardiac protection was done through cold-blood cardioplegia perfusion. Cerebral effective protection was done using bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion combined with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest in aortic arch surgery. After that, the aortic arch and ascending aorta were opened and inspected closely. The primary tear of aortic dissection was observed in the descending aorta. Sleeve anastomosis was performed to suture the root of the aorta. We implanted a 100 mm long stentgraft (Shanghai MicroPort Medical Corporation, China) into the descending aorta compressed as an elephant trunk and sealed off the descending aorta intimal tear. The sutural margins were then fixed using the 4-0 Prolene suture. Besides, fenestration was performed in the stented elephant trunk to simplify the procedure of anastomosis to the left Fig. 2 Flowchart for our case management subclavian artery. Then, a four-branched prosthetic graft (Terumo Corporation, Japan) replaced the ascending aorta and aortic arch. Bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion was discontinued after anastomosis of the innominate artery and common carotid artery. CPB was gradually returned to normal flow and started to rewarm. After the reconstruction of all aortic arch vessels, the proximal anastomosis was carried out during rewarming. The CBP time was 190 min, aortic cross-clamp time was 114 min, and double cerebral perfusion time was 35 min.",

The mortality rate of acute type A dissection without treatment is about 20% in 24 h, 30% in 48 h and almost half die in a week. Fatal complications are common in medical therapy patients, such as aortic rupture, cardiac tamponade, coronary ischemia, and severe aortic regurgitation [4] . Surgical repair strategy is still the main treatment for the proximal aortic dissection while endovascular intervention is the treatment option for distal aortic dissection repair [1] . TEVAR was reported as effective management of type B aortic dissection as it was less invasive compared to the open surgical procedure with higher mortality. However, the aortic wall and intimal flap are usually in a state of acute inflammation at the early stage of type B aortic dissection, and a new dissection or rupture may occur. An incidence of RTAD was reported up to 13.8% in acute type B aortic dissection patients after TEVAR, and the rate of mortality exceeded 42% [8] . Shu et al. [4] proposed a 2-week conservative therapy for type B aortic dissection ahead of TEVAR procedure, which could reduce postoperative complications effectively. Furthermore, some studies had found favorable outcomes with medical treatment in a clinically stable patient in whom the false lumen of the ascending aorta was completely thrombosed [9] .",

In the current case, the patient showed a painless RTAD following conservative treatment in a week, and surgical treatment was mandatory to avoid lethal consequences. Acute aortic dissection usually presents with one or more concomitant symptoms/signs such as chest pain, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, limbs and bowel ischemia, stroke, or paraplegia. Suddenonset severe chest or back pain remains the most common symptom of aortic dissection. However, about 6.4% of aortic dissections are painless and most of the patients suffer from type A aortic dissection, which is associated with increased mortality [10] . As RTAD is an extreme emergency and fatal complication, rapid diagnosis and intervention are imperative. Painless RTAD must be under high clinical suspicion in acute type B aortic dissection patients involving either TEVAR or conservative management, even without the presence of a characteristic pain as supported. Unfortunately, it is more likely that there is even a higher rate of painless RTAD occurrence because of misdiagnosis and underestimation.",

Ischemic necrosis of nerves results from direct vascular compromise and can lead to specific classes of neurologic dysfunction [12] . Atypical symptoms of aortic dissection make accurate diagnosis difficult, especially in painless aortic dissections. Diagnosis of painless RTAD requires a high degree of consideration and suspicion in patients with descending aortic dissection or aneurysm.
