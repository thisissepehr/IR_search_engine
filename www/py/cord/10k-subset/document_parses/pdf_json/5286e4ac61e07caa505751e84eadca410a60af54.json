The latter possibility is not trivial, since the wide spectrum of clinical and histologic presentations of these disorders can make diagnosis difficult. For example, a nonlethal 'infectious mononucleosis-like' syndrome, as in UPN 1333, may resolve spontaneously; while disseminated disease, as in the nine cases diagnosed at autopsy, may go unrecognized as BLPD. Therefore, a high index of suspicion along with an aggressive diagnostic process involving imaging studies and biopsies may increase the number of premorbid BLPD diagnoses.
