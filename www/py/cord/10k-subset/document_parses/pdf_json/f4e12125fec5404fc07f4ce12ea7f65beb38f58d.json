            "text": "The objective of the presented, randomized study was to compare the efficacy of antimicrobial monotherapy with imipenem (3x0.5g/d) to a combination therapy with cefotaxime (3x2g/d) plus piperacillin (3x4g/d) for empirical treatment of infections in neutropenic patients. In 165 patients, 237 infectious episodes were evaluable. The overall response rate of patients treated with cefotaxime plus piperacillin was 67/115 (58%), of those treated with imipenem 661122 (54%). In patients not responding to the initial therapy regimen within 2 or 3 days, the antimicrobial therapy was modified. After therapy modification 85/100 patients were cured. Fever of unknown origin (FUO) showed the most favourable course compared to other infection types, with a response in 46159 (78%) and in 35\u202250 (70%) cases, respectively. In comparison, pneumonias were successfully treated in only 3/21 (14%) and 7\u202237 (19%) cases. Even including patients with modified therapy, only 66% (21/32) of pneumonia episodes responded. The unfavourable results in pneumonias is mainly due to the high rate of 13 systemic mycoses in this group (22%). Overall, a similar response was observed in patients treated with cefotaxime plus piperacillin in comparison with imipenem. In primary bacteremias however, an advantage was observed in patients treated with imipenem (20\u202227; 74%) compared with cefotaxime plus piperacillin (11/23; 48%).",

            "text": "Severe, life-threatening infections are a major risk for patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing intensive chemotherapy with its long-term granulocytopenia [1, 2] . Up to now empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic combination therapy is the accepted practice of treatment in febrile granulocytopenic patients. Combinations usually include an aminoglycoside plus an extended-spectrum cephalosporin or penicillin or two [3-1actam antibiotics. In the last decade, gram-positive bacteria and especially fungi have emerged as increasingly frequent pathogens resulting in empirical several-step treatment regimens [1, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . But also cost-effective, less toxic monotherapies, e.g. with imipenem or ceftazidime, have been investigated in febrile neutropenic patients, compared to combination therapy or to one another. The study results (Table 1 ) have indicated that combination and monotherapy are similarly effective [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Monotherapy, however, has been controversially discussed especially because of resistance problems. Ceftazidime is more effective than imipenem in the treatment of Pseudomonas sp., but less active against gram-positive cocci in comparison to other cephalosporins; about 20% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and more than 80% of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains are resistant against imipenem, whereas imipenem is the most effective [3-1actam against gram-positive cocci (except oxacillin-resistant staphylococci) compared with other 13-1actams [18, 19] . Furthermore, imipenem has an acceptable spectrum of side-effects and no essential organospecific toxicity. Mostly, imipenem has been used at a dose of 4\u00d70.5 g to 4\u00d71.0 g ( Table 1) per day with success rates ranging from 70% to 90%. A non-comparative, open pilot study performed by our group with imipenem at a dose of 1.5g per day resulted in a satisfactory response of 65% [20] . Thus a larger open prospective, randomized study was planned to compare the efficacy of monotherapy with imipenem to a \"standard\" combination therapy (cefotaxime plus piperacillin) as initial treatment of infections in grannlocytopenic patients. Interim results of this study have been reported at the Annual Congress of the German and Austrian Society of Hematology and Oncology in Essen, October 10-13, 1993 [21] .",

Prospective, randomized trials have not reported any essential difference of efficacy in monotherapy with imipenem or ceftazidime compared to the combination treatments.

None of the strains was resistant in vitro to the study drugs and thus the susceptibility pattern cannot explain the poor response rate in pneumonia. The microorganisms, mostly found in our study patients, were gram-positive bacteria (23%) followed by gram-negatives and fungi (15% and 5%, respectively). The most frequent fungus was Aspergillus (ten episodes), systemic Candida infections were rarely seen (three episodes). These results disagree with those of other studies observing Candida sp. to be the predominant fungi [1, 6] . Resistance against imipenem especially in Pseudomonas sp. and coagulase-negative staphylococci is one of the main objections to initial monotherapy with imipenem. An analysis of resistance patterns at the Centre of Internal Medicine, University Frankfurt, between 1990 and 1992 has not shown an increase of imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains (17% to 16%). Moreover, P. aeruginosa bacteremias were rarely seen in our study patients. Over the year there has been an increase from 17% to 23% in imipenem-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. However, as these bacteremias are not fulminant, treatment modification was initiated after the results of sensitivity testing became available. None of the patients with a bacteremia with S. epidermidis died. In contrast to favourable courses of most infections due to gram-positive bacteria, infections caused by streptococci of the viridans group, particularly Streptococcus mitis, have been reported to be associated with a high rate of lethal courses by development of ARDS [26] . The empirical treatment with vancomycin-containing combinations has been widely discussed. The PEG study has not observed any advantage of additional treatment with vancomycin in non-responders of initial therapy [6] . In contrast, several randomized studies reported more favourable results in patients with initial treatment with vancomycin [7, 27] . The duration of granulocytopenia was found to be the main prognostic factor for the outcome of infections, as also described by others [3, 6, 10] . The importance of the duration of granulocytopenia on occurrence and course of infection is reflected by the recommendation of colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF or GM-CSF) [14] . Using G-CSF a shortening of granulocytopenic period and activation of granulocyte function can be achieved [28] [29] [30] . In patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia simultaneously receiving chemo-radiotherapy and randomized G-CSF vs. placebo severe infections such as sepsis or pneumonia occurred in 14% of the G-CSF group, but in 30% of the placebo group [29] .",

Monotherapy with a drug such as imipenem can be more cost-effective in initial empirical treatment in such patients. Increasing incidence of systemic mycoses, especially in patients with pulmonary lesions, would warrant an early empiric antimycotic treatment. Colony-stimulating factors for earlier hematopoietic reconstitution and activation of neutrophil function should be considered in febrile patients with long-term granulocytopenia. ",

Ziel der vorliegenden prospektiven, randomisierten Studie 1 war der Vergleich der Ef-fektivit~it einer Monotherapie mit Imipenem (3 \u00d70,5g/Tag) gegentiber einer Kombinationstherapie mit Cefotaxim (3 \u00d72g/Tag) plus Piperacillin (3 x4gJ~ag) in der Initialtherapie von Infektionen granulozytopenischer Patienten. 237 Infektionsepisoden bei 165 Patienten waren evaluierbar. Insgesamt wurde unter Cefotaxim plus Piperacillin eine Heilung in 67/115 (58%), unter Imipenem in 66/122 Episoden (54%) erzielt. Bei Nichtansprechen innerhalb yon drei Tagen unter der Initialtherapie wurde die antibiotische Behandlung modifiziert. Hierdurch wurde bei weiteren 85/100 Patienten eine Heilung ~Zwischenergebnisse dieser Studie wurden auf der Gemeinsamen Jahrestagung der Deutschen und Osterreichischen Gesellschaft far Hfimatologie mad Onkologie in Essen, 10.-13.10.93 vorgetragen. erreicht. Unter den verschiedenen Infektionstypen war die Ansprechrate bei Fieber unktarer Genese (FUO) am h6chsten mit einem Therapieerfolg in 46/59 Episoden unter Cefotaxim plus Piperacillin (78%) sowie in 35/50 F~illen unter Imipenem (70%). Besonders ungiinstig verliefen dagegen die Pneumonien mit einem Ansprechen in 3/21 (14%) bzw. in 7/37 (19%) der FNle. Auch unter Therapiemodifikation ergab sich bier eine Ansprechrate yon insgesamt lediglich 66% (21/32). Die ungtinstigsten Ergebnisse bei diesem Infektionstyp sind haupts~chlich durch den hohen Anteil yon 13 systemischen Pilzinfektionen bei den Pneumonien (22%) bedingt. Insgesamt zeigten sich keine signifikanten Unterschiede in der Ansprechrate unter Cefotaxim plus Piperacillin im Vergleich zu Imipenem. Bei den prim~iren Bakteri~imien zeigte sich jedoch eine h6here Ausheilungsrate unter Imipenem mit 20/27 Episoden (74%) im Vergleich zu Cefotaxim plus PiperaciUin mit 11/23 (48%) Episoden.",
