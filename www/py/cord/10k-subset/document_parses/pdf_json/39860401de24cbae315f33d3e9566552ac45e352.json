There are mainly two types of influenza virusesinfluenza A and B with several subtypes-that are commonly found to circulate among humans. The traditional trivalent (TIV) flu vaccine targets two strains of influenza A and one strain of influenza B. The quadrivalent (QIV) vaccine targets one extra B virus strain that ensures better protection against influenza; however, the use of QIV vaccine can be costly, hence impose an extra financial burden to society. This scenario might create a dilemma in choosing vaccine types at the individual level. This article endeavours to explain such a dilemma through the framework of a vaccination game, where individuals can opt for one of the three options: choose either of QIV or TIV vaccine or none. Our approach presumes a mean-field framework of a vaccination game in an infinite and well-mixed population, entangling the disease spreading process of influenza with the coevolution of two types of vaccination decision-making processes taking place before an epidemic season. We conduct a series of numerical simulations as an attempt to illustrate different scenarios. The framework has been validated by the so-called multi-agent simulation (MAS) approach. inspiration from [40] , which mainly focused on a networked population. A similar work related to [40] can be found in [41] . The number of vaccinees remains the same during an epidemic season as we are considering seasonal influenza. Moreover, as influenza vaccines are not perfectly effective [42] , we take into account vaccine efficacy in our modelling. The assumption of imperfect vaccine in the vaccination game can tackle more realistic situations, and lead to interesting results, which otherwise can be intractable (for instance, see [43, 44] ). In our current setting, at the end of each season, individuals assess their perceived payoffs based on the previous season's experience in terms of vaccine efficacy, cost, etc., and decide whether to vaccinate or not or if vaccinating then which vaccine to take for the next season. The strategy adaptation after each season is based on imitating others' strategy with better payoffs. The group who chooses QIV vaccine are expected to get better protection against the disease than that of the group taking TIV vaccine, although this may depend on the circulation of influenza B virus. However, the cost for TIV vaccine should be no more than the cost for QIV vaccine. Taking into account all these factors, we combine the disease spreading dynamics of influenza with the vaccination decision-making process through an evolutionary framework. We perform our simulations for repeated seasons until we reach a social equilibrium (steady state). By varying vaccine effectiveness and cost level, our numerical simulations intend to show an overall picture of influenza epidemics. At equilibrium, we calculate to what extent the average social payoff attained from the vaccination game falls short from the desired or social optimum payoff, which we name as, 'social efficiency deficit'. Moreover, our approach has been validated with the multi-agent simulation (MAS) approach. We also explore the robustness of our framework in explaining the situation with influenza A or B virus-dominant circulation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1328, "end": 1332, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1409, "end": 1413, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1430, "end": 1434, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1606, "end": 1610, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1854, "end": 1858, "text": "[43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1859, "end": 1862, "text": "44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: \u00a72 provides the detailed illustration of the model covering the epidemic spreading, payoff structure, strategy update and the evolutionary dynamics of vaccination coverage.

Initially, we divide the whole population into three categories: susceptible (unvaccinated) denoted by S, QIV vaccinees denoted by V Q and TIV vaccinees denoted by V T . It is not usually recommended to take both vaccines (TIV and QIV) in a single season [46] ; therefore, we disregard any group taking both vaccines in the same season. As influenza vaccines are not 100% perfect, we consider imperfect vaccinations in our disease modelling, where both vaccines are presumed to provide the same level of efficiency against A virus but different efficacies against B virus. The inclusion of these parameters allows us to consider some individuals from vaccinated groups who fail to get immunity from vaccination (QIV or TIV) and still face the risk of infection like susceptible. The unvaccinated or vaccinated people who fail to get immunity may become infected with either influenza virus (A or B), and then these infected people transfer to the recovery state after suffering from illness. Therefore, at time t, an individual can be at any of the six compartments: susceptible, S(t); QIV vaccinees, V Q (t); TIV vaccinees, V T (t); infected with influenza A, I A (t); infected with influenza B, I B (t); recovered state, R(t). We presume e Q (0 \u2264 e Q \u2264 1) as the vaccine efficacy of QIV against both influenza A and B viruses. As TIV (QIV) vaccine contains two strains of influenza A virus and one (two) strain(s) of influenza B virus, we assume that both QIV and TIV vaccines bestow the same level of effectiveness (e Q (0 \u2264 e Q \u2264 1)) against influenza A but TIV vaccine provides relatively lower effectiveness, e T (0 \u2264 e T \u2264 e Q ) against influenza B than that of QIV vaccine. If V Q (0) is the fraction of vaccinees at the beginning of an epidemic season, then a proportion e Q of V Q (0) i.e. e Q V Q (0) gets perfect immunity from QIV vaccine and, the remaining fraction, V Q (t) \u2212 e Q V Q (0) becomes vulnerable to the disease, where V Q (t) is the fraction of vaccinators in the V Q compartment at time t. A similar logic has been used for TIV vaccinees. The transmission rates and recovery rates for influenza A and B viruses are assumed \u03b2 A , \u03b3 A and \u03b2 B , \u03b3 B , respectively. It is worth mentioning that the state space variables represent several fractions of the total population; therefore, we are not considering a population of any particular size. Although coinfection and superinfection with two influenza viruses are possible in some cases [47, 48] , the incidence rate is not so significant. Therefore, our model disregards the incidence of coinfection and superinfection with two influenza viruses (A and B) and presumes long-term cross-immunity between them. Although we assume long-term crossimmunity between two viruses, short-term immunity is possible in reality. The incidence of short-term cross-immunity between two viruses may allow some individuals recovered from one virus to be infected with the other one after a short time interval (e.g. [49] ).

The transmission rate parameters are chosen as \u03b2 A = \u03b2 B = 5.19957 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , which is estimated as the minimum transmission rate that surpasses the preset threshold final epidemic size of 0.9 without any vaccination [16] . The corresponding initial infections are I A (0) = 2 agents and I B (0) = 4 agents. Note that we estimate ensemble average for each 100 realizations. Generally, results obtained from the mean-field framework and MAS approach are showing overall the same tendency, albeit having subtle discrepancies in terms of colour scaling that comes from the fact that the MAS approach undertakes a finite population. Now let us focus on analysing similar phase diagrams by varying vaccine efficacies. To this aim, we generate several heatmaps as above as a function of (e Q , e T ), 0 \u2264 e T \u2264 e Q \u2264 1, for the case of similar and different cost levels ( figure 5) . Obviously, similar cost for both vaccines would encourage people to choose QIV vaccine instead of TIV because the former one bestows better protection against both viruses. This situation illustrates why the sensitivity comes only along the direction of e Q (upper panels in figure 5) . A lower degree of vaccine efficacy would not entice individuals to take vaccine (red region in figure 5a-iii); however, if e Q passes a threshold level, the fraction of QIV vaccinees mounts to the highest level (blue region in figure 5a-iii)). A further increase of e Q seems to suppress both infections significantly, which allows some people to avoid vaccination by free riding on herd immunity. This is why, after passing a transient regime having maximum vaccination coverage, the fraction of vaccinees decreases monotonically even with the increase of e Q (yellowish region in figure 5a-iii) . Nevertheless, if the cost for QIV is higher than TIV (lower panels in figure 5 ), then individuals' vaccination choice differs depending upon the degrees of e Q and e T . More specifically, under the current setting, QIV vaccine is favoured over TIV vaccine if e Q is above 50% (approximately) and e T is below 40% (approximately); on the other hand, if e T is above 40% (approximately), then TIV vaccine is preferred over QIV vaccine regardless of e Q (of course with the condition, e T \u2264 e Q ). Notably, in this case, the fraction of QIV vaccinees never reaches the maximum as the corresponding cost is higher; contrarily, TIV vaccinees are seen to reach the highest level for a mid-range of e T , although it starts decreasing with the further increase of e T that arises with the prevalence of free riders.

Now let us explain the heatmaps for SED that are generated following the above procedure. As an archetype, we choose the case illustrated in the upper panel of figure 4 , where we assumed \u03b2 A = \u03b2 B = 0.5 and e Q = 0.6, e T = 0.4. In that case, we observed that most of the people are inclined to choose TIV vaccine whenever the cost difference between C Q and C T gets higher but individuals prefer QIV if the cost difference becomes lower. It is conceivable that the overall desired payoff or social optimum payoff for QIV vaccinees (x) would be relatively higher than the TIV vaccinees (y), which is appeared in figure 9a ,b, but in this case, the vaccination coverage for QIV seems much lower than TIV (figure 4a-iii-a-iv), which indicates that the dilemma of choosing QIV vaccine is higher than the other one. Obviously, this comes from the fact of higher cost associated with QIV vaccine. This factor results in less contribution of QIV vaccine to ASP ( figure 4a-v) . As a result, we perceive relatively higher payoff-gap between social optimum payoff for x and ASP (at equilibrium); hence, more areas of the heatmap for SED x are seemed dark compared to its counterpart (SED y ). The whiteout region in heatmaps (figure 9c,d) depicts the scenario with no SED, that is there is no gap between social optimum payoff and ASP. There are two white regions in the SED yheatmap (figure 9d), which either come from 100% TIV vaccination coverage (region enclosed by blue dotted lines) resulting from lower C T and higher C Q (blue region in figure 4a-iii), or from the scenario when everyone becomes a free rider (region enclosed by red dotted lines in figure 9b,d). The latter situation can arise for higher vaccination cost or for very low vaccine effectiveness. In this case, avoiding any type of vaccination is the best strategy (desired strategy), which agrees with the D(unvaccinated)-dominant equilibrium (figure 4a-iii,a-iv). As a result, the payoff at this equilibrium also agrees with the social optimum payoff; hence no SED or no dilemma arises in this case.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 187, "end": 195, "text": "Figure 8", "ref_id": "FIGREF15"}, {"start": 400, "end": 408, "text": "figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 854, "end": 863, "text": "figure 9a", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1211, "text": "figure 4a-v)", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}], "section": "(d) Social efficiency deficit"}, {"text": "In this paper, we consider a simultaneous spreading of two influenza viruses (A and B) coupled with two types of vaccinations. The QIV vaccine contains one extra strain of influenza B virus and hence provides better protection compared to the TIV vaccine.

Here we design a mean-field vaccination game model in an infinite and well-mixed population to explain people's vaccination dilemma, entangling an epidemic spreading process of influenza with the coevolution of two types of vaccinations. Our evolutionary framework assumes three strategies-choose QIV vaccine, TIV vaccine or none-that evolve at the end of each season by imitating strategies based on the previous season's experience. We perform a series of numerical simulations by varying vaccination cost, vaccine effectiveness, transmission rates, etc., to depict different scenarios.

Another interesting result concerns the variation of transmission rates for both viruses and its resulting effect on disease propagation and vaccination choice. The higher transmission rate of influenza A virus leads to a maximum coverage for TIV vaccine since it possesses the same degree of effectiveness against influenza A virus as that of QIV vaccine but with a lower cost; contrarily, the higher transmission rate of influenza B virus results in almost complete dominance of QIV vaccinees that is quite conceivable.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "Our analysis also incorporates how much the overall payoff or the average social payoff (ASP) attained by the process of voluntary vaccination (at equilibrium) falls short from the desired payoff or social optimum payoff, what we have termed as social efficiency deficit (SED)-the payoff gap between social optimum and equilibrium.

It would be interesting to explore strain-specific infection, where an individual infected with a particular strain can have short-term or long-term cross-immunity against the other one (e.g. [49] ). The inclusion of age structure (for instance [49, 56] ) in the current framework could be another aspect to explore. The influenza epidemic varies from one country to another country, thus it would be also interesting to explore the outlined framework for a specific country with proper estimation of relevant parameters [56, 57] .

The vaccination coverage for each vaccine is assumed approximately 33% with vaccine effectiveness e Q = 0.6 and e T = 0.4. The recovery rate for each flu virus is chosen as 0.2. Under the current set-up, when \u03b2 A = \u03b2 B (a,b), B virus is found to dominate because e T \u2264 e Q , whereas the flu virus with higher transmission rate (c,d) dominates the other one.

Let us note that we choose initial values of x and y in such a way so that x + y \u2264 1. Moreover, when we vary initial values of x, the initial value of y is set as 0.33 and vice versa.(c) Phase plane analysis (i) Case I (\u03b2 A = \u03b2 B ) Figure 4 portrays several heatmaps depicting the final epidemic size for influenza A(B) virus-FES A (FES B ), vaccination coverage for QIV(TIV) vaccine and the average social payoff-ASP (using equation (2.2)) in the steady state as a function of (C Q , C T ) presuming an equal transmission rate for the both viruses (for the mean-field approach, we set \u03b2 A = \u03b2 B = 0.5 and I A (0) = 0.00001, I B (0) = 0.00002). It is worth mentioning that all heatmaps of our analyses presume the transition from the blue colour to the red colour as a good/better state to a bad/worse state of society in terms of infection, vaccination coverage and ASP, and vice versa. Clearly, infection due to influenza B virus predominates the other one that is akin to what we have observed infigure 2a,b for the case of equal transmission rates. As long as C T < C Q and C T is of lower than a certain threshold level, a broader regime in TIV heatmaps is covered by the blue colour (figure 2a-iv and b-iv); the counterpart of this region in QIV heatmaps is covered by the red colour, meaning that, because of lower cost, most individuals are interested in taking TIV vaccine until it bestows a considerable efficiency against B virus (that is of course below the efficacy of QIV vaccine). Despite a major portion taking TIV vaccine, it cannot fully suppress infection due to influenza B that can be clearly perceived from FES B heatmaps, which, in accordance, bestows a lower average payoff to society (figure 4a-v). However, the increase of effectiveness (TIV vaccine) against both viruses (if e Q = 0.8, e T = 0.6) would provide a better situation to society that can be observed from heatmaps in the second row.

Six possible combinations of QIV and TIV vaccination coverages at equilibrium attained from the evolutionary equations (2.8) and (2.9). The evolutionary dynamics of the vaccination coverage depends upon the choice of different parameters. Clearly, there is no bi-stability at equilibrium.
