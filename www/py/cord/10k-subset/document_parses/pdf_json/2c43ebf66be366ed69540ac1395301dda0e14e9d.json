For this reason, scientists are working on the advancement of medical devices that are capable of decreasing the workload of health caregivers. In this study, the development of an iontophoretic drug delivery device that could be controlled using a mobile is described. For the purpose, hardware and a software module were developed. The hardware module consisted of a two-channel voltage-controlled constant current sources that were used for driving the iontophoretic device. A mobile app was developed to control the two-channel iontophoretic device and to monitor the loose lead of the active and the passive patches. In the case of detection of the loose lead, the specific iontophoretic channel was stopped. Further, the audio-visual indicator was developed for the detection of the detachment of the patches (loose lead).

The process is complicated when a number of medicines are given, and the elderly patients have to manage the task of remembering the doses, which is quite taxing. This is further complicated if the patient is suffering from physical, visual, or cognitive impairments. Furthermore, it has been observed that even the elderly patients are advised oral drug delivery systems, which they have to swallow. Unfortunately, many of the patients (especially having age >70 years) suffer from dysphagia and face a tremendous obstacle in taking the medication. Regular use of the injectables in these patients is also not feasible. Due to the aforesaid reasons, the help of caregivers has been proposed. Nevertheless, this is associated with a high recurring cost. Many researchers have proposed to deliver drugs by applying the drug formulations over the skin surface [1] . The iontophoretic drug delivery system is one such method that has gained much importance in the last few decades. The main advantage of iontophoretic drug delivery is its ability to deliver drugs within the deeper layer of the skin tissue and/or systemic circulation in a noninvasive manner [2] .

Due to the significant advancements made in the field of internet technology, IoT has been able to revolutionize the current day technology system. In recent times, the term medical-IoT has been gaining importance. Medical-IoT is a field of study that involves controlling medical devices from a remote location using the internet technology. The application of IoT technology in medicine can significantly improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare service, especially for elderly patients, patients with chronic conditions, and for the people who need continuous monitoring [3] . This technology has also been explored for iontophoretic drug delivery applications. This type of device can help in monitoring and delivering the drug from a remote location (like office and car) by the relatives. Sayeed et al. developed an IoTbased responsive drug delivery system that can inject the drug into the epileptogenic zone on seizure detection [4] . In another study, Junginger et al. have designed a chip-controlled iontophoretic system that can deliver apomorphine to the patients suffering from Parkinson's disease [5] . In the proposed method, the amount of the drug delivered could be controlled by controlling the current density. Conformal contact between the device and the skin must exist to increase the device efficacy [6] . Any loss in the connection between the skin and the patch(es) results in the underdosing of the drugs to the patients and can cause morbidity. However, to the best of our knowledge, no arrangement was made by any existing literature to detect the loss of connection between the skin and the patches. Another critical issue found in every drug delivery system was its ability to deliver only one drug at a time. The report says elderly people are the largest per capita consumer of drugs and are prescribed a higher number of medications [7] . In such patients, polypharmacy (multiple drug use) is mainly related to chronic diseases like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and memory-related diseases (e.g., dementia and Alzheimer's disease). Polypharmacy is also found in low-income countries where disease like tuberculosis is among the most common chronic illness [7] .

Arduino Due board houses an Atmel SAM3X8E ARM cortex-M3 microcontroller. The board has an in-built two-channel digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The microcontroller was programmed so that the Arduino Due board could synthesize sinusoidal signals independently from either or both the DAC channels. The synthesized sinusoidal signal has been shown in Figs. S4(a) and S4(b) that are available in the Supplemental Materials on the ASME Digital Collection. A visual inspection of the signal suggested the presence of a DC offset (1.80 V, 1.77 V) in the generated signals. The peak-to-peak amplitude was found to be 2.32 Vpp and 2.28 V. The signals were Designing and Testing of the Iontophoretic Device. The analysis of the synthesized signals suggested the presence of an offset voltage of 1.78 V. So, to eliminate the same, a passive high-pass filter having a cut-off frequency of 15 Hz was employed. The gain response of the filter was determined (Fig. 7(a) ). It was found that the gain at 1 kHz frequency was 0 dB. This suggested that the designed filter would not affect the nature of the 1 kHz signal. However, it would be capable of eliminating the DC component from the synthesized signal. Hence, the designed filter was used to process the synthesized signals. The output of the high-pass filter has been given in Fig. 7(b) . It could be seen here that the processed signal did not have any offset. Further, there was no alteration in the peak-to-peak amplitude of the processed signals as compared to the synthesized signal. The processed signals were then presented to a buffer amplifier. A buffer amplifier provides a gain of 1. Hence, there is no magnification of the signal component (Fig. 7(c) ). In our study, we also found that the input signal from the high-pass filter and the output of the buffer amplifier were the same. Further, the buffer amplifier imparts an electrical impedance transformation while connecting two circuits. This helps to prevent the signal source from being affected by the load of the sink circuit. The output of the buffer amplifier was then given to the voltage-controlled constant current source that was operating in the inverting amplifier mode. The input resistance (82 kX) of the constant current source governs the current injected into the human body through the patches. This resulted in the generation of a sinusoidal current having a peak-to-peak current amplitude of 0.28 lA (Ipp). Hence, the positive and negative peak currents were 0.141 lA (Ip). The current was then injected into the iontophoresis cells, which were used as a simulated human body.

Continuous monitoring of the impedance between the active and the passive patches was employed for the loose-lead monitoring. The passive patch was virtually grounded as it was connected with the inverting terminal of the constant current source, while the noninverting terminal was directly grounded to the ground of the electrical circuit. Hence, the current is injected into the iontophoresis cell through the active patch. Accordingly, the voltage measured at the active patch against the ground would be directly proportional to the impedance across the active and the passive patches. This means, when the patches are properly connected with the iontophoresis cell, we will get a voltage value that is proportional to the total impedance of the active patch, passive patch, and the iontophoresis cell. Since the input signal to the iontophoresis cell is sinusoidal, the output would also be sinusoidal (Fig. 8(a) ). However, if either of the patches or any one of the patches gets disconnected, the circuit becomes an open circuit, and the impedance would be infinite. Here, we would get a square signal. The positive peak would go to positive saturation, while the negative peak would go to the negative saturation ( Fig. 8(b) ). Subsequently, the output of the iontophoresis cell is given to the buffer amplifier. The output signal was then used as the input to the inverting terminal of a voltage comparator circuit that was being operated using a 65 V power supply. A constant DC voltage of 2.5 V was used for the comparison, which was connected to the noninverting terminal of the comparator. The comparator was operated using 65 V power supply so as to prevent damage to the microcontroller board due to the input of the voltage that was higher than \u00fe5 V. The microcontroller board rejects the negative voltage as it functions in the range of 0 V and 5 V. The output of the comparator during the open and the close cases has been given in Figs. 8(c) and 8(d) . During the open case, a square wave of 4.00 Vpp was obtained. On the contrary, during the close case, a DC voltage of 4.49 V was obtained. These signals were then PCB Designing of the Iontophoretic Device With Loose-Lead Monitoring.

In the case of detachment of the patch(es), the skin contact impedance will become infinite, and the voltage pattern across the patches (active and the passive) changes.

Again, it is not possible for the members of the patient's family to continuously monitor them. A survey conducted by the National Alliance of caregiving, 2004 showed that approximately 15% of the caregivers leave the patients alone at least for 1 h and monitor them only from a distance [23, 24] .

A programmable dual-channel sinusoidal signal generator was designed to provide alternating current signals for the proposed drug delivery system. The alternating current signal was meant for carrying out the iontophoresis-based drug delivery through the skin surface. An Android app was designed, and an ESP12E NodeMCU was used to enable wireless control of the drug delivery device. The drug delivery device can deliver single or multiple drugs simultaneously for the desired time duration. It is also capable of detecting the loose attachment of the drug patches with the human skin surface and generates a visual alert on detecting the loose contact. The components of the proposed device, namely, the signal generator, the iontophoretic setup, the loose-lead monitoring system, and the Android app based wireless control system, were tested for their proper functionality. Finally, an in vitro drug release study (both in active and passive modes) was performed, which suggested non-Fickian diffusion of the drug molecules and a relatively higher drug release was observed during the iontophoretic drug delivery as compared to the passive drug delivery. The current system is a prototype device for a dual-channel iontophoretic drug delivery system. However, before practical implementation, the miniaturization of the device is essential using different advanced device development techniques, such as microfabrication, nanofabrication, and MEMS-based technologies. This would allow us to develop a wearable system. We have conducted the in vitro drug release study of the proposed system. There is a need to conduct in vivo studies, including animal and human tests, to validate the functioning of the proposed device. The number of drug delivery channels can also be increased so as to avoid the complications of polypharmacy. An alarm system can also be integrated in the future that can give a gentle reminder regarding the time and dosage of medication, thereby, improving the patient-medication compliance.
