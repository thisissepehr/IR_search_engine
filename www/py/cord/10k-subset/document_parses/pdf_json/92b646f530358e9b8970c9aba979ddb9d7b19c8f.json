Our porting of the AMBER force fields and relevant water models have been shown to numerically reproduce the results of these parameters when compared to the AMBER software (3), and are now distributed within the GROMACS software suite. The AMBER energy function employs, from top to bottom in Equation [1] below, van der Waals contact between non-bonded atoms; Coulomb interactions between all pairs of non-bonded atoms; a Hooke's Law treatment for all bonds, and a similar treatment of all bond angles; and sinusoidal treatments of proper and improper dihedral angles, where the latter is defined across a planar group involving a central atom bonded to three other atoms, as in the case of -NH 2 amine groups.",

To allow larger simulation timesteps, and thereby enhance the speed of our simulations, it is assumed that all bonds are in their ground state configurations, sans molecular vibration, and all bonds are therefore constrained using the Linear Constraint Solver (LINCS) algorithm of Hess and co-workers (6). [1] This treatment employs single point charges on each atom, as derived via the Restrained Electrostatic Potential (RESP) method, which fits the electrostatic field for a given chemical group or molecule to that predicted by ab initio calculations (1). This method thus sacrifices the effects of atomic polarizability, which greatly decreases real-time simulation speed, to make simulations of large biochemical systems tractable on reasonable research timescales. In this case, the collective data set reported herein required approximately eight months to collect using tens of thousands of processors, which would not have been possible using a polarizable model.",

The TIP3P, or Transferrable Intermolecular Potential 3-Point, model is a rigid 3-point model of water that employs energy function [1] and thus assigns partial point-charges to each atom. Although this model excludes the polarizability of molecular water and cannot reproduce some physical features of liquid water across a broad temperature range (8) , this water model is well-understood; outperforms more sophisticated water models in several ways; provides a physically relevant solvation environment at standard and biological temperatures; and therefore remains widely used within the biomolecular simulation community (8, 9) .",

While beyond the scope of the current report, this is an important target for future studies. \u2022 Native and non-native contacts: Quantitative and algorithmic definitions of \"native contacts\" may vary across studies based on the system(s) studied and the models employed. Such definitions are largely arbitrary and must, therefore, be physically logical and justifiable while avoiding the introduction of artifacts within the structural analysis. The reported model and parameters used to define native contacts have been assessed for artifacts and are consistent with previously reported models (12, 13) . It should be noted, however, that minor changes to the parameters used to define native contacts would impact the overall appearance of data that employs such metrics (Table 1 and Figures 4 and 7) , which are meant largely to provide a qualitative view of the conformational states and behavior of the system studied. As noted in the associated article, normalization of non-native contacts is similarly arbitrary and should also be interpreted from a primarily qualitative perspective. \u2022 Sampling thoroughness: Finally, as noted in the associated article, it is not possible to verify that sampling of the configurational space of the studied species is complete, and there remains the possibility that regions outside of the reported configurational space remain unobserved within our simulated ensemble. The methods employed herein, however, were designed to optimize the sampling of the entirety of the configurational space and the thoroughness of that sampling. It is thus expected that regions that remain unsampled would include only high-energy states and those not participating to any significant degree in the conformational equilibrium of the system studied.",
