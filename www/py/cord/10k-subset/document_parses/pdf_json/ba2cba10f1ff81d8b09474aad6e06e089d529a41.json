Recently Eby, Davis & Halcomb (1984) reported that treatment of patients with common colds with zinc gluconate lozenges significantly improved the course and duration of their illness when compared with those who received placebo. Unfortunately, the Eby et al. (1984) study was not, in our opinion, adequately controlled since it relied on self-assessment by patients, it lacked any laboratory monitoring and the treated and control groups were not well balanced. If substantiated, the results of Eby et al arc important and could have wide implications. We have, therefore, conducted double-blind placebo controlled studies to evaluate the efficacy of zinc gluconate lozenges in the prophylaxis and treatment of a rhinovirus infection.",

Generally the lozenges were well tolerated despite the relatively large number taken. Some volunteers complained that the taste of food was affected by the lozenges but there were no serious objections to either zinc or placebo lozenges. A similar finding was obtained with the other eight volunteers, of whom three received zinc and five placebo and who were challenged with saline. These results supported those of preliminary tests which indicated that the placebo and medicated lozenges were indistinguishable by appearance and taste. In addition there were no adverse changes in the haematological and biochemical indices. Table I shows that volunteers were well balanced for age, sex, psychological scores and pre-trial rhinovirus antibody titre. Twenty-nine volunteers received zinc gluconate lozenges and 28 received placebo. They were challenged with 10 2 TCID 50 of human rhinovirus type 2 on the second day of medication. Six of the 29 (20%) volunteers who received zinc and eight of 28 (29%) of those on placebo developed significant colds (mild, moderate or severe) (Table I) . However, zinc medication reduced the mean daily clinical score on successive days by about one third when compared with placebo and this was statistically significant on the second day after virus challenge ( Figure 1 ). The mean total clinical score was reduced from 8-2 in the placebo group to 5-7 in the zinc group, although this was not statistically significant. Medication with zinc also apparently reduced, though not significantly, the mean nasal secretion weight as well as the number of volunteers who excreted virus (Figure 1 ).

Of the 69 volunteers who were inoculated with HRV-2, 12 developed definite symptoms of the common cold on the same day and these were randomly allocated to receive either zinc gluconate lozenges (six volunteers) or matched placebo (six volunteers).

Those who had lower concentrations of zinc clearly reached saturation and then excreted zinc in their urine. All volunteers receiving zinc showed a marked increase in urinary zinc excretion. There was a tendency for those in the placebo group who had low concentrations of plasma zinc (< 13 /rniol/1) to have higher clinical scores than the rest but this was not statistically significant.",

            "text": "Common colds are responsible for a significant proportion of morbidity annually and, as recent statistics from the United States show, cost some 2-5 billion dollars every year in days of work lost and in the sale of proprietary cold remedies and analgesics (Couch, 1984) . A remedy or a specific antiviral agent against the common cold continues to be the goal of many research groups in both the pharmaceutical industry and academic departments. Despite the development of several synthetic molecules, none has yet been found useful in treating colds and only interferons have proved effective in preventing rhinovirus infection and colds (Tyrrell & Al-Nakib, 1987) . Recently, however, Eby et al. (1984) suggested that zinc gluconate lozenges are effective in the treatment of common colds. They showed that medication with zinc reduced significantly the number of days of illness among those who were treated when compared with those given placebo. However, these studies relied on patient's selfassessment of their colds and lacked stringent control and independent clinical observations. Nor were the aetiological agents identified in these patients or the effect of zinc on virus replication monitored. We have, therefore, conducted double-blind placebo controlled trials to assess the efficacy of zinc gluconate lozenges on rhinovirus infection and illness. We chose HRV-2 since our laboratory studies have shown that this serotype was the most sensitive to zinc. We began with a prophylactic study in which zinc medication was started 24 h prior to virus challenge in order to give zinc the best possible chance to exert its effect. The results showed that medication did reduce the mean daily clinical score compared with placebo and this was statistically significant on the second day after virus Challenge. Medication also appeared to reduce the mean daily nasal secretion weight as well as the number of volunteers who shed virus but these reductions were not statistically significant compared with placebo. However, as shown in Figure 1 , medication ceased just before the peak of the clinical illness in our volunteers (as measured by the mean clinical score and mean nasal secretion weight) and hence it was not clear whether zinc would have had a more significant effect on illness had medication continued longer.",

The results show that zinc gluconate lozenges consistently reduced both the mean daily overall symptoms and signs of disease as reflected in the clinical score and the mean nasal secretion weight, the most objective measure of a clinical response. However, zinc had no effect on the rate or amount of virus excreted compared with placebo suggesting that medication may have had an effect on signs and symptoms of the colds rather than on virus replication. If this is the case, it would be interesting to know whether zinc gluconate lozenges would also have the same effect on coronavirus colds or, indeed, on colds caused by other respiratory viruses. It should be noted too that the signs and symptoms were reduced by a third rather than being abolished. Most of our volunteers showed no biochemical indication of zinc deficiency, so the effect is apparently due to temporarily increasing the intake above normal in otherwise healthy subjects.",
