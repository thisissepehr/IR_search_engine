In order to establish a successful infection, replicate and persist in the host, viruses have evolved numerous strategies to counter and evade host antiviral immune responses as well as exploit them for productive viral replication. These strategies include those that target immune receptor transmembrane signaling. Uncovering the exact molecular mechanisms underlying these critical points in viral pathogenesis will not only help us understand strategies used by viruses to escape from the host immune surveillance but also reveal new therapeutic targets for antiviral as well as immunomodulatory therapy. In this chapter, based on our current understanding of transmembrane signal transduction mediated by multichain immune recognition receptors (MIRRs) and the results of sequence analysis, we discuss the MIRR-targeting viral strategies of immune evasion and suggest their possible mechanisms that, in turn, reveal new points of antiviral intervention. We also show how two unrelated enveloped viruses, human immunodeficiency virus and human cytomegalovirus, use a similar mechanism to modulate the host immune response mediated by two functionally different MIRRs-T-cell antigen receptor and natural killer cell receptor, NKp30. This suggests that it is very likely that similar general mechanisms can be or are used by other viral and possibly nonviral pathogens.",

Our investigation of how seemingly disparate viruses target a single family of membrane receptors exposes a redundancy in viral strategies exploiting the host innate and adaptive immune systems. MIRR-targeted strategies disrupting the MIRR TM architecture from the extracellular space as well as virus-induced clustering of MIRR signaling subunits from the cytoplasmic space ( Fig. 1) will be described for a select group of viruses that are functionally disparate, target different host cells and differ in their replication strategies. We will also display the power of the SCHOOL model-guided primary sequence evaluation for a number of additional viruses and its ability to predict additional MIRR-targeting viral agents not previously conceived. Furthermore, by understanding the mechanisms viruses have developed over centuries of evolution to modulate MIRR-mediated triggering in the immune response, we gain insight into the fundamental details of the mechanisms underlying normal MIRR-mediated immune activation processes and can begin to learn how to take advantage of these optimized processes. Finally, the learned viral strategies and newly developed concepts of MIRR signaling can be translated towards new lines of rational drug design efforts targeting MIRRs and modulation of immune activation (see also Chapter 20) . MIRR-targeted strategies stretch beyond the specific viruses discussed in this chapter and represent a surprising junction in viral strategies. Whether this strategy represents a convergence in evolution of disparate viruses or hints towards a similar evolutionary origin from which viruses have diverged remains to be determined.",

First, the infecting virus must migrate to the primary site of infection, usually through direct inoculation, or through the respiratory, gastrointestinal or genitourinary route. The virus then undergoes a process of viral entry, including attachment, a physical connection of the virus to the target cell through a viral cell recognition protein-host receptor interaction and penetration, exit fi-om the extracellular space and entry into the cellular environment. Once inside the target cell, the virus particle uncoats and releases its viral contents, including its nucleic acid genome, in preparation of viral replication. Depending on the nature of the nucleic acid and the Baltimore group classification, viral genes may be translated directly by the host cell translation machinery (i.e.. Group IV positive-sense ssRNA viruses) or incorporated into the host genome (i.e.. Group I dsDNA viruses). Regardless of whether the expressing transcript originates from the viral particle itself or integrated viral genes, mRNA transcripts are translated, localize to the site of maturation and assemble into virion particles, encapsulating the viral genome in the process. Depending on the enveloped property of the infecting virus, the viral particle either surrounds itself in host membrane during budding and release (enveloped viruses) or releases without an envelope (non-enveloped viruses).

Intriguingly, MIRR-targeted functions enacted by viral proteins seem to be present at multiple checkpoints in viral pathogenesis, coinciding with several viral stages.

However, because the FP is heavily conserved amongst the divergent HIV subtypes, it must have other TCR-specific functions outside binding. In fact, FP was demonstrated to inhibit activation of primed lymph node cells and human T-cell lines in the presence of an activating antigen. However, in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin or mitogenic antibodies to CD3, the inhibitory activity of HIV FP was abrogated.^^ These observations of FP closely mirror those of the recently studied TCR core peptide (CP) and are discussed in detail in Chapter 20. Briefly, TCR CP is a 9 amino acid peptide homologous to part of the TCRa TMD and contains the two electropositive residues (R, K) thought to be important for TCR complex formation (Fig. 2) . TCR CP was also demonstrated to have immunosuppressive effects on T-cells in the presence of specific stimulating antigens, suggesting similar functionalities of TCR CP and Figure 2 . Suggested mode of action and sequence analysis of viral fusion protein regions and other domains proven and predicted to affect transmembrane interactions between T-cell receptor recognition and signaling subunits. A) Structural architecture of T-cell receptor is organized by three major assembly transmembrane forces, each involving one basic and two acidic amino acid residues. B) Within the SCHOOL model, viral agents (V) disrupt the transmembrane interactions between the ligand-binding TCRa chain and the CD38E and XX> signaling subunits which normally maintain the integrity of a functional T-cell receptor. This prevents formation of signaling oligomers upon multivalent antigen stimulation, thus inhibiting antigen-specific T-cell activation (see also Chapters 12 and 20) . C) Helical wheel representations of proven and predicted immunomodulatory sequences of viral fusion protein regions and other domains. For illustrative purposes, the regions shown are restricted to 18 residues. As an ideal alpha helix consists of 3.6 residues per complete turn, the angle between two residues is chosen to be 100 degrees and thus there exists a periodicity after five turns and 18 residues. Positively charged residues are shown in bold. Legend continued on following page. HIV FP.

            "text": "Similar to viral entry, viruses have developed subprocesses targeting MIRRs that underlie other viral stages, namely viral replication, for enhancement of viral production and persistence. Following entry and uncoating in the target cell, viruses undergo an efficient and economical process of replication where copies of the viral genome are abundandy produced, viral genes are expressed and viral protein translations begin to assemble into competent viral particles. Due to the diversity in genomic structure found among the diffisrent viruses, there is also great diversity in the replication strategies they employ. Contrary to cellular genomes that are comprised uniformly of dsDNA, viral genomes span all possible structural organizations: dsDNA, dsRNA, positive-sense ssDNA, negative-sense dsDNA, positive-sense ssRNA, negative-sense ssRNA and mixed (ambisense) ssDNA or ssRNA. Consequendy, viruses have developed unique replication strategies, used by the Baltimore classification method to group viruses, that require different host proteins as well as inclusion of different vitally encoded proteins in their genomes. For example, group I dsDNA viruses, such as members of the adenoviral family, require host cell DNA polymerases to repUcate their viral genomes and are therefore highly dependent on the replicative state of the cell; the target cell must be undergoing active replication and cell division where the cell s polymerases are most active. In contrast, group VI positive-sense ssRNA viruses, such as members of the retrovirus family, replicate their genomes by RNA-dependent DNA synthesis not by any host polymerases but by virus-encoded RT; the transcribed DNA is then used as the viral template for integration into the host genome and transcription. Because RT is not suppUed by the target cell, it must be packaged with the viral progeny for further replication. Regardless of the structure and replication strategy of their genomes, all viruses express their genes as functional mRNAs early in infection and direct the cell's translational machinery to make viral proteins for eventual viral packaging.",

Among all of Nef s functions, downmodulation of the TCR remains the most controversial and intriguing. Because of its role in initiation of the signaling cascade in T-lymphocytes, TCR fills a strong potential role in Nef s reported eflFects on increasing the activation state of the cell. Interestingly, HIV-2 and SIV Nef have been reported to specifically interact with the ^ signaling chain of the TCR complex but additionally induce downregulation of surface TCR from the cell surface.^^^^^^ Functional mapping of SIV Nef has revealed that the C-terminal core domain, conserved among the different HIV-1 clades and strains, is responsible for specific ^ binding whereas the nonconserved N-terminal domain cooperatively binds AP-2 from the host thereby inducing downregulation of the bound TCR.

HIV Nef may crosslink with the ^ signaling subunits through cytoplasmic interactions^^ ( Fig. IB ; see also Chapters 12 and 20) , cluster TCRs and instead of disengaging the receptor, activate it or prime it for activation.

Analogous to the accessory HIV-1 Nef protein,^^^'^^ pl2 is required for optimal viral infectivity in nondividing primary lymphocytes.^\"^^^\"^^ HTLV-1 viral infection of T-lymphocytes is known to induce T-cell activation.^^^ As suggested, one mechanism involves activation of T-cells harboring the virus and is exempUfied in vivo by infected, non-immortalized T-cell clones that display prolonged states of activation, whereas with a separate mechanism, virus-infected cells can induce activation of uninfected T-cells via T-cell-T-cell interactions.^^^ In non-immortalized, HTLV-1-infected T-cells, spontaneous clonal proliferation is resistant to immunosuppression by transforming growth factor-P (TGF-P), a cytokine implicated in terminating T-cell activation, suggesting a potential role of HTLV-1 in a defense against TGF-(3-induced immune suppression of the host cell.^^ Spontaneous proliferation and virus production have been reported to increase in the presence of anti-CD3 and anti-TCR antibodies while addition of HLA class I antibodies, but not HLA class II or viral proteins, shut down virus production and cell proliferation.^\"^^ These findings suggest that both virus and cell activation may occur through the TCR on the infected cell. Expression of pl2 has been shown to induce nuclear factor of activation of T-cells (NFAT), enhance the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2), decrease MHC-I expression, increase cytoplasmic calcium and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat 5) activation in T-cells further supporting the hypothesis that pl2 may alter T-cell signaling.^^^'^^'^^^ Interestingly, p 12 is important for viral infectivity in quiescent human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and PBMCs and the establishment of persistent infection in vivo, suggesting a role for pl2 in the activation of quiescent lymphocytes, a prerequisite for effective viral replication in vivo.^\"^^*^^^ In this context, function of p 12 in conditions where the majority of viral target cells are in quiescent states has been predicted to be similar to that of Ne\u00a3^^^ HTLV-1 pl2-expressing cells were reported to display a decreased requirement for IL-2 to induce proliferation during suboptimal stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies.^^^ HTLV-1 replication in infected lymphocytes has been also been reported to increase upon CD2 cross-linking. ^^^ This receptor is known to signal primarily through the associated CD3E and 'Q chains.^^^'^^^ Studies have shown that the mitogenic activity of HTLV-1 viral particles is restricted to virus-producing T-cells, requires ceU-to-cell contact and maybe mediated through the lymphocyte-associated antigen 3 (LFA-3)/CD2 activation pathway and that HTLV-1 virions interfere mainly with activation of peripheral T-cells via CD2/^ but not via the CD3/TCR complex.^^s Overall, pl2 seems to augment T-cell activation and facilitate viral replication. Thus, despite the distinct structures, both retroviral accessory proteins HTLV-1 pl2 and HIV Nef are able to modulate TCR-mediated signaling and play a critical role in enhancing viral infectivity in primary lymphocytes and infected animals. Interestingly, it has been recently reported that pl2 could complement for effects of Nef on HIV-1 infection of Magi-CCR5 cells, which express CD4, CXCR4 and CCR5 on the surface, or macrophages.^^^ Also, Jurkat cell clones that express high levels of pl2 have been found to exhibit a more rapid rate of cell proliferation than the parental cells.^^^ Similarly to HIV Nef, the pl2 protein, upon engagement of the TCR, localizes to the interface between T-cells and antigen-presenting cells, namely the immunological synapse.^^^ Intriguingly, similarly to HIV-1 Nef protein,^^^ HTLV-1 pl2 has also been shown to form dimers.^\"^^ It can be suggested that homooligomerization of pl2 contributes to pl2-mediated augmentation of T-cell activation and that molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon are similar to those that have been suggested previously for Nef through application of the SCHOOL model of TCR signaling (see also Chapters 12 and 20) .^^ If true, the homooligomerization interface(-s) of pl2 represent potential therapeutic targets for antiviral treatment.",

            "text": "Viral infection and the resultant immune response form a violent interplay where host homeostasis is interrupted by a propagating virus seeking to proliferate and the immune system working to quell the infection. In many cases, the virus and human host have coevolved to exist symbiotically where the virus resides in a latent phase nonpathogenic to the host. However, as new viruses emerge or crossover from other species, they will need to replicate rapidly and efficiendy so as to proliferate as quickly as possible. This poses the largest pathogenic threat to humans and incurs disease that defeats the immune system and results in death of the human host. Therefore, we are forced to develop novel strategies to target the infecting virus. However, rather than targeting virus-specific proteins or processes, it would be advantageous to transfer therapeutic strategies that target redundant processes found among a number of viruses. In this chapter, we have described the universal targeting of members of the MIRR family by a number of seemingly unrelated viruses that function through similar mechanisms. Therefore, it is possible to take advantage of these general processes in drug development; the tedious work of developing virus-specific therapies would be eliminated and powerful far-reaching agents could be conceived.",

As demonstrated by the similar fimction of natural HIV FP and synthetically derived TCR CP, viral immune evasion strategies can be transferred to therapeutic strategies that require similar functionalities. Viruses represent years of evolution and the efficiency and optimization that come along with it. Therefore, viral functions should not only be studied as foreign processes but as efficient strategies we can use in our own attempts at immune evasion or immunomodulation.",
