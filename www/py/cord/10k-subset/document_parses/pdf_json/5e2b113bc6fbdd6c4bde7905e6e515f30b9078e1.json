ApoE is a key mediator of neuroinflammatory responses and modifies recovery from a variety of acute and chronic brain injuries. Unfortunately, intact apoE holoprotein does not cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and cannot be administered as a neurotherapeutic. We created apoEmimetic peptides that cross the BBB and down-regulate neuroinflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo. CN-105, our lead candidate, is a 5-amino acid apoE-mimetic peptide derived from apoE's receptorregion. CN-105 retains anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of intact apoE, was well-tolerated in preclinical studies, readily crosses the BBB, and demonstrates excellent pharmacokinetic, safety, and tolerability profiles in Phase 1 studies.",

Thromboembolism is a major complication of aneurysmal coil embolization, with an incidence as high as 28% . New flowdiverting devices have been designed to have a mesh with high coverage area and high flexibility to facilitate the redirection of blood flow. These features can induce blood stagnation and thrombosis. To reduce the risk of thrombosis, the common but unproven practice of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel has been implemented from the cardiac literature. Despite some favorable outcomes, clopidogrel, \"non-responsiveness\" has been reported to be present in as low as 5% to as high as 56% making this agent not optimal. This will leave practitioners with other oral P2Y12 alternatives such as prasugrel and ticagrelor that have not been studied widely in this setting. It is therefore likely that controversy exists among practitioners regarding the use of optimal antiplatelet agents in neurointerventional procedures. We hypothesized that practices in regards with the use of oral antiplatelets in neurointerventional procedures are likely heterogeneous and different from state to state.

LP may be clinically necessary in the presence of cerebral mass effect. While empirical antibiotic therapy is generally successful, specific groups such as post-instrumentation patients and immunosuppressed individuals may benefit from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies. In the absence of high-quality clinical recommendations, uncontrolled retrospective literature suggests that a small volume LP (5-10 cc) might be without complications in specific situations. Nevertheless, the ethical principle of non-maleficence and the liability risk prevent clinicians from performing LPs. In this scenario, an extended length of stay, poor outcomes, or a higher cost of care are legitimate concerns.

Bi-monthly meetings continued ongoing education, with content including clinical case studies and review of processes and protocols. Additionally, 6 beds staffed by Neuro Champions were designated as Critical Neurological Care Unit (\"CNCU\") beds to co-localize the highest acuity neurosciences patients. The Neuro Champions are responsible for educating and sharing neuro related practices with the entire ICU nursing staff.",

Specifically, weaning anesthetic agents is complicated by the emergence of EEG patterns on the ictal-interictal continuum (IIC), which have uncertain significance, given that IIC patterns may worsen cerebral metabolism and oxygenation, have a dissociation between scalp and depth EEG recordings, and indicate a late stage of status epilepticus itself. Determining the significance of IIC patterns in the unique context of anesthetic weaning is important to prevent the potential for unnecessarily prolonging anesthetic coma.",

We speculate that IIC patterns are transitional and may have a context-specific association with status epilepticus relapse, with less risk conferred when these patterns are observed during the weaning of anesthetic agents after prolonged burst-suppression therapy.

When aneurysms are detected, they often require securement either via surgical clipping or endovascular techniques.

Approximately 10% of treated aneurysms with flow diversion do not obliterate after 12 months, but currently there is no validated way to predict treatment failure. Computational models of blood flow of flow diverted aneurysms predict a significant difference in the hemodynamic energy loss across aneurysms between cases that resolve and those that do not. Energy loss could be estimated clinically during angiography, however, this hypothesis needs to be validated experimentally because computer models often over estimate hemodynamic parameters, poorly predict flow through stents, and may not have the resolution to fully describe intra-aneurysmal blood flow.",

In a small series of 6 patients with renal failure, approximately 20% of lamotrigine was reported to be removed by hemodialysis. We applied this principal to our patient.
