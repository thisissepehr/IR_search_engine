While schizophrenia has clear genetic underpinnings, currently known genes explain only a portion of disease risk. 1, 2 In addition to genetic factors, environmental exposures have been identified as increasing risk for the disease. Environmental factors associated with increased risk of schizophrenia include winter-spring birth, urban birth, maternal preeclampsia, and perinatal and postnatal infections. [3] [4] [5] [6] The potential role of infections in the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia is supported by the associations between schizophrenia risk and genes which encode HLA and other factors which control the immune response to infectious agents. 1, 7 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), also known as human herpesvirus 4, is a member of the Herpesviridae family. EBV is a lymphotropic virus that produces latent infections with immunomodulatory effects. 8, 9 Primary infection with EBV is often associated with self-limited fever and adenopathy. Following acute infection, the virus persists in host B and T lymphocytes, monocytes, and epithelial cells; asymptomatic salivary viral shedding leads to onward transmission. 10 EBV can establish latency in many body sites including the brain where reactivation can be associated with encephalitis 11 and brain-specific immune responses. 12 The immune response to EBV infection can be monitored by the measurement of levels of antibody directed at antigens derived from virions as well as specific EBV proteins. Commonly measured anti-EBV antibodies include: anti-early antigen (EA) that arises early in the course of infection and decreases after 3-6 months; viral capsid antibody (VCA) that also arises early in infection but persists for extended periods of time; anti-EB nuclear antigen (EBV NA or EBNA) that does not arise until late in infection but does persist for extended periods of time 13, 14 (supplementary figure 4) .

An altered immune response to EBV infection could also be based on host factors such as genetics or other environmental factors. In terms of genetic factors, we found an additive effect of increased EBV antibodies and increased genetic risk with a combined odds ratio of 8.86 for individuals with values \u226575th percentile of both measures. However, there was no statistically significant association interaction between the levels of EBV virion antibodies and the polygenic risk scores suggesting that the risks associated with genetic susceptibility and increased levels of EBV virion antibodies are independent.

Furthermore, additional genetic studies are required to define the genetic contribution to the aberrant response to EBV infection found in individuals with schizophrenia. The possibility use of combinations of immune and genetic markers for the diagnosis and management of schizophrenia is an important area for future study.

An interaction between EBV exposure and cigarette smoking has also been noted in other EBV-associated disorders such as multiple sclerosis, possibly based on the many immunomodulatory effects of cigarette smoking. 39 As for the above factors, the timing of the interaction between cigarette smoking and EBV exposure in terms of risk for schizophrenia should be addressed in prospective studies. The possible effects of lymphotropic viruses such as EBV and other environmental factors which can affect B-cell activity on the immunopathology of schizophrenia should be the subject of future investigations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 407, "end": 409, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The neurobiological mechanisms by which increased levels of EBV virion antibodies might be associated with schizophrenia are not entirely known. One potential scenario is that individuals with aberrant EBV immune responses underwent previous replication of EBV within the central nervous system. This possibility is consistent with reports of psychosis in individuals undergoing EBV encephalitis and the finding of increased levels of EBV VCA antibodies in the CSF of some individuals with psychiatric disorders. [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] It is also possible that psychiatric symptoms are related to neuro-inflammatory effects on the brain including alterations in neurotransmitter receptor interactions, as has been found in a range of autoimmune disorders which affect the brain. 46 In conclusion, this study indicates that many individuals with schizophrenia have an aberrant immune response to EBV. There are a number of therapeutic interventions available for the modulation of EBV infection including anti-viral medications and pharmacological compounds which can modulate the immune response. 47 An increased understanding of the role of EBV infection might thus lead to novel methods for the prevention and treatment of schizophrenia.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 513, "end": 517, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 518, "end": 522, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 523, "end": 527, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 528, "end": 532, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 533, "end": 537, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 538, "end": 542, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 786, "end": 788, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1104, "end": 1106, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Supplementary material is available at Schizophrenia Bulletin online.
