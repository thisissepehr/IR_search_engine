This study aimed to evaluate the effects of an empirical therapy of high-dose versus standard-dose meropenem in sepsis and septic shock patients. Methods: We performed a prospective randomized open-label study to compare the changes of modified sequential organ failure assessment (mSOFA) score and other clinical outcomes of the high-dose meropenem (2-g infusion over 3 h every 8 h) versus the standard-dose meropenem (1-g infusion over 3 h every 8 h) in sepsis and septic shock patients. Patients' characteristics, clinical and microbiological outcomes, 14 and 28-day mortality, vasopressor-and ventilator-free days, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital-free days, percent of the time of antibiotic concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (%T>MIC), and safety were assessed. Results: Seventy-eight patients were enrolled. Median delta mSOFA was comparable between two groups (-1 in the high-dose group vs. -1 in the standard-dose group; P value = 0.75). There was no difference between the two groups regarding clinical and microbiological cure, 14-and 28-day mortality, vasopressor-and ventilator-free days, and ICU-and hospital-free days.

This syndrome is an important healthcare problem that affects significant morbidity and mortality [1] . Early identification of sepsis and aggressive management in first hour are cornerstones for improving patient outcomes [2] . Delay in an initial appropriate antimicrobial therapy has been correlated with an increase in mortality [3] . The initial selection of appropriate antimicrobial is defined in terms of broad-spectrum and adequate dosing of selected antimicrobial for suspected pathogens [3] . However, appropriate antimicrobial dosing is challenging because of altered pharmacokinetics (PK) and increased multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms in critically ill patients [4] . A larger volume of distribution, which is caused by fluid resuscitation and capillary leak syndrome, culminates in subtherapeutic levels of antimicrobial [5] . The fluctuation of renal clearance, such as augmented renal clearance or acute kidney injury, could affect by increasing or decreasing antimicrobials concentrations [6] . In addition, Suwantarat et al. reported a high prevalence of MDR gram-negative bacteria in Thailand, including 28.7% for carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 45.2% for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) producers, and 76.3% for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii [7] . Due to the spread of antimicrobial-resistant organisms, as well as a decline in new antimicrobial developments, the exploration for effective antimicrobial activity based on PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties is the solution [4] . Moreover, the standard recommended dose of antibiotic, which was derived from (1) PK data from healthy volunteers or non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and (2) the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for non-resistant bacteria, may increase the risk of treatment failure [4] . Roberts et al. performed a PK study of 8 beta-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients across 68 ICUs in 10 European countries. From a total of 248 patients, 16% of patients did not achieve 50% of the time of free antibiotic concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (fT>MIC) of the pathogen, and these patients were less likely to complete a treatment course and achieve positive clinical outcome with the initially selected beta-lactam [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 212, "end": 215, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 337, "end": 340, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 447, "end": 450, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 612, "end": 615, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 793, "end": 796, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 953, "end": 956, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1124, "end": 1127, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1417, "end": 1420, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1652, "end": 1655, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1937, "end": 1940, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2402, "end": 2405, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Meropenem, a member of the carbapenem class, is widely used as empirical therapy in the treatment of sepsis and septic shock regarding its broad-spectrum activity and a low toxicity profile.

In addition, each component of the SOFA score was not worsening in both of the standard-dose and the high-dose groups. The explanation of this comparable delta mSOFA between the standard-dose and the high-dose meropenem might be as follows. First, the pathophysiology of sepsis and septic shock starts from dysregulated host responses to infection. A combination of hemodynamic and cellular failures were then followed constantly [13] . Appropriate antibiotic therapy at an early point of sepsis diagnosis will help in reducing microbial load. Consequently, the burden from microbial toxin released or produced by bacteria will be terminated [14] . Inflammatory response leading to tissue injury would then be declined [14] . Since critically ill patients have substantially physiologic changes, the suboptimal concentration of antibiotics was reported [8, 15, 16] . Thus, high-dose antibiotics should be taken into consideration to achieve better clinical outcomes [6] . Nevertheless, cellular failure due to the individual dysregulated host responses to pro-inflammatory cytokine and alteration of cellular immune function may also progress and might not have been helped by the higher dose of antibacterial [13, 17] . Second, 44.7% of patients included in our study had a negative culture, which might have been from noninfectious causes, viruses, or fungal infection [18, 19] . In fact, supportive treatments such as fluid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy, and nursing care were appropriate in both of the standard-dose and the high-dose groups. For the secondary outcomes, 14-day and 28-day mortality, clinical cure, and vasopressor-, ventilator-, ICU-, and hospital-free days, there were no significant differences between the two meropenem dosing strategies. Since the sample size in our study was explicitly calculated focused on delta mSOFA score, the sample size might be insufficiently powered to detect differences of secondary outcomes between two groups. Besides, even though there was a trend of higher ICU-and hospital-free days in the high-dose group, there was no statistical difference between the groups. The secondary outcomes' results might have been confounded by a persistent inflammation-immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS), and post-sepsis syndrome which are increasingly found in critically ill patients [20, 21] . Therefore, increased risk of death and reduced healthrelated quality of life would be associated with long-term effect consequences reflecting the secondary outcomes [21] . Moreover, serious adverse drug events, seizure, and Clostridium difficile infection were not reported in the high-dose group.

This was because the higher concentration of meropenem at the site of infection was required in order to get a better microbiological cure [22, 23] . Regarding the meropenem concentration in our study, both regimens of meropenem achieved PD target of 40% of the time above the identified MIC.

Since this is the first study identifying different outcomes between two meropenem dosing regimens in ED, high-severity patients might get better outcomes from the higher dose of meropenem. The reason for better microbiological cure might be from higher tissue penetration and overall maintenance of plasma concentration in severe patients. Goncalves et al. found that critically ill patients with a greater baseline severity had a significant increase in the volume of distribution, leading to low meropenem concentrations. Decreased antibiotic concentration at the infection site was eventually found from reduced microvascular perfusion in critically ill patients [25, 26] . However, the high-dose meropenem did not demonstrate better clinical outcomes, delta mSOFA, mortality, vasopressor-free days, ventilator-free days, ICU-free days, and hospitalfree days, in these 3 groups of patients. However, our study has several limitations. Firstly, since this was the first study comparing 3 g/day with 6 g/ day of meropenem, the sample size calculation was based on the delta mSOFA from the previous 3 months before patient recruitment, but not from the differences of delta mSOFA between two meropenem dosing. Therefore, the sample size might not have been enough to detect significances between the two dosing strategies. Second, the negative culture found in about 50% of patients in our study, impact on different meropenem dosing could not be assumed. Early differentiation of nonbacterial infection from bacterial infection before empirical therapy has not yet been easily done in our institution. Third, almost all of our patients' relatives experienced grief when confronted with a deteriorating phase of their love ones. Informed consent regarding blood sample collection was too difficult when there was a treatment limitation decision. For that reason, meropenem blood concentration collection was performed in only 5% of our recruited patients. Lastly, pathogens identified in this study had relatively low MICs. Narrowing the group of patients that might benefit from the highdose group might be an option. Patient medical history, local antibiogram, and epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in each area might be needed to modify inclusion criteria in order to specify the group of patients likely to be infected by higher MICs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1397, "end": 1401, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1402, "end": 1405, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Primary outcome"}, {"text": "Empirical therapy with a high-dose of meropenem in critically ill patients showed no statistical difference in patient's clinical outcomes compared to a standard-dose of meropenem.
