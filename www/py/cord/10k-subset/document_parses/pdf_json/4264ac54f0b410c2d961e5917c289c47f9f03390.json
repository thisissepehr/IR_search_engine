In spite of medical progresses in the care of patients with septic shock during the last decades, this condition has remained associated with a high mortality. Early recognition and multidisciplinary management are key to the care of patients with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, with intensive and appropriate intensive support of failing organs, rapid diagnosis of infectious source(s), and surgical management. The epidemiology and risk factors for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome remain to be better studied, including the possible causal role of exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In this review article, the authors review the current knowledge of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and discuss the pathophysiology as well as its supportive and specific treatment. which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.",

She had been taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication for 5 days following a trauma of the left ankle. Physical examination showed hypotension with arterial blood pressure of 70/30 mmHg. The patient remained hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation with crystalloids and required continuous norepinephrine infusion. At the time of admission, the patient complained of important pain in the left limb, although this was associated with a normal clinical examination. A small skin defect on the left ankle in relationship with the initial trauma was, however, noted. The gynecologic examination was normal. Laboratory tests on admission showed elevated plasma C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels (320 mg/L and 23 \u03bcg/L, respectively), an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15 mL/ min/1.73 m 2 , an absolute neutrophil count of 1.4 G/L with increased band forms, thrombocytopenia (63 G/L), increased thromboplastin time, and very elevated creatine kinase levels (143,000 U/L). The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with the diagnosis of septic shock, and empiric antibiotic therapy was initiated with piperacillin/tazobactam plus clindamycin. A CT scan of the limb did not show radiologic signs of necrotizing fasciitis, but the patient subsequently rapidly developed signs of arthritis of both ankles plus the right elbow, which required surgical lavage. Synovial fluid and blood cultures came back positive with group A streptococcus (S. pyogenes), and the antibiotic therapy was deescalated for high-dose IV penicillin G. In spite of the initial acute renal failure and rhadomyolysis, the patient did not need renal support therapy during the ICU stay, could be transferred to the ward after 6 days, and recovered without sequelae. The final diagnosis was a toxic shock syndrome due to group A streptococcus with septic oligoarthritis, most probably originating from a skin lesion and a left ankle trauma, in young woman with type 1 diabetes.",

A puzzling finding is that patients presenting with STSS have frequently taken NSAIDs, although the causal role of NSAIDs remains controversial.

Systemic symptoms of STSS are in great part related to the production and the secretion of GAS superantigen exotoxins, cross-linking the major histocompatibility class II and T cell receptors, present on antigen-presenting cells and T lymphocytes, respectively. Symptoms are therefore closely related to the response of stimulated immune cells secreting proinflammatory cytokines and vasodilating mediators, resembling to those observed in \"classic\" septic shock, due to endotoxins, for example.

Alteration of the central nervous system with delirium is reported in roughly half of patients. Skin lesions as possible streptococcal infection may be present. Examination of the skin and soft tissues is essential in the initial clinical evaluation of the patients, as well as during follow-up, up to four times per day, looking for tenderness, localized swelling, and erythema, or the more suggestive violaceous bullae, such as those observed in necrotizing fasciitis. An early and transient macular rash may be present, predominating on the upper chest [23] .

In patients with preexisting liver disease, a > twofold increase over baseline levels Multiple organ failure including two or more of the following: renal impairment, coagulopathy, liver involvement, acute respiratory distress syndrome since its presence defines \"confirmed\" cases of STSS (Table 1) . The presence of GAS in non-sterile site defines \"probable\" cases in addition to clinical criteria. Similar to other types of infections, bacterial cultures (including blood cultures) should be performed rapidly, and prior to the administration of antibiotics. Depending on the suspected source of infection, the following sites should also be cultures: skin, deep soft tissue, peritoneal fluid, urine, sputum, pharyngeal swab, and synovial fluid. Antibiotics must be administered as soon as possible, just after the first blood culture, in case of high suspicion of streptococcal invasive infection with or without shock. Blood cultures will come back positive in about half of all cases with streptococcal STSS. Of note, staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome is rarely associated with positive blood cultures, being a \"purer\" toxin disease. Laboratory criterion for STSS diagnosis is \"positive\" if GAS is isolated in any microbiological test from sterile sites. CT scans and MRI are helpful to identify the source of infection [27, 28] . MRI is more sensitive than CT for diagnosing skin and soft tissue infections but is less specific and therefore tends to increase the number of \"false-positive\" findings. The interpretation by the radiologist should always be taken with caution because radiological early signs might be benign: low local inflammation and no abscess formation, at least in the beginning, and absence of gas in the tissue, S. pyogenes does not produce gas [25] . A discordant radiological and surgical image is not infrequent at the early stage of fasciitis. The MRI is more specific for fasciitis. The presence of a thick (> 3 mm) hyperintense signal in the deep fascia on fat-suppressed T2 weighted or short tau inversion-recovery images are important markers for necrotizing fasciitis [27] . Although less predictive and informative, soft tissue echography can be useful in some cases since it can be performed at the bedside in the ICU unstable patient and can be frequently repeated [29] . An important message is that in case of a doubt, of a discordant radiological and clinical examination in a patient with systemic inflammation and/or shock, surgery should be considered without delay to evaluate the possibility of a necrotizing fasciitis, and surgical debridement with opening of the muscular fascias in cases of fasciitis. Surgical exploration is not only important for diagnosis (fasciitis remaining a diagnosis made by histopathology on a biopsy of a fascia [30] , but is a cornerstone of fasciitis treatment [31] .",

The first streptococcal pyronegic toxin which appeared subsequently to be a superantigen was described in 1924 [34, 35] . Eleven different streptococcal superantigens (also known as streptococcal pyrogenic enterotoxins, SPEs) have been identified to date in S. pyogenes. Although they have different protein amino acid sequences and structures, they produce the same biological effects. They are single-chain proteins expressed as precursor molecules, which are then cleaved to release the functional extracellular toxin. They share sequence homologies in highly conserved regions called \u00abfamily signature motifs\u00bb [12, 36] . The gene coding for superantigens can be present in streptococci, but may remain silent, with no expression of the toxin. The human factors triggering the expression of superantigens are largely unknown. Experimental studies have shown that GAS was able to modify gene expression depending on its environment, expressing virulence factors (such as superantigens) promoting the transition from superficial to invasive disease [37] .",

Since immune cell activation is not restricted to cells expressing and recognizing a single antigen, but rather polyclonal, cell activation is massive and explains the systemic pro-inflammatory activity, arterial hypotension, and end-organ dysfunction due to shock in patients with STSS [12, 38, 39] .

The association could also be that NSAIDs use in invasive GAS infection may mask initial signs and symptoms, and delay diagnosis and adapted treatment of invasive infections. Others have argued though that NSAIDs is independently associated with an increased risk for development of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Bryant et al. suggest that NSAIDs could delay muscle regeneration, induce cellular immunosuppression, and increase susceptibility to post-injury GAS infection. NSAIDs may accelerate GAS disease progression in established soft tissue infection and could reduce antibiotic efficacy [49, 50] . It has also been shown that endotoxin-treated volunteers had elevated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels, and decreased neutrophil functions when they had taken NSAIDs, and this may also be true in toxin-induced streptococcal shock [51, 52] .",

Concentrations of the SPEA toxin were significantly lower 1 h after treatment when clindamycin or linezolid was added to penicillin, compared with penicillin alone. The mode of action of linezolid is similar to that of clindamycin, but its use in STSS is limited, and has no theoretical advantage over clindamycin [58] . The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for STSS remains controversial and is usually guided by the clinical evolution, and by the need for recurrent surgical interventions. Duration of 2 weeks for the antibiotic therapy is often proposed, however, without any strong evidence supporting this duration of treatment. Again, it is important to stress that antibiotic therapy alone is not sufficient to treat and cure STSS. Antibiotic penetration into infected tissues, and sites of soft tissue and muscle necrosis is frequently very low, if not absent. This is essentially due to the poor vascularization of these sites, partly due to infection-induced microvascular thrombosis. Only surgical debridement of infected and necrotic tissues associated with high-dose systemic antibiotic therapy may improve mortality.",

Case reports in the 1990s described a lower mortality in patients with STSS who benefited from polyclonal immunoglobulins [62] [63] [64] . These findings pointed at possible importance of antibodies in the protection against invasive diseases and suggested that addition of IV polyclonal immunoglobulins (IVIG) to the treatment may be useful as an adjunctive therapy. Possible mechanisms of action of immunoglobulins in STSS are: neutralization of toxins, improvement in bacterial opsonization, phagocytosis, and killing, as well as a possible immunomodulatory effect mediated by the interaction of Fc receptors and immune cells [65, 66] .",

In a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study reported in 2003, patients with IVIG had a recovery of organ function significantly more rapid but no survival advantage [68] . This study was stopped prematurely because of a slow recruitment and was not powered to demonstrate the possible effect of IVIG on mortality. A recent randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial tested the effect of IVIG in necrotizing soft tissue infections (INSTINCT trial) [69] . There was no statistically significant difference between placebo and the interventional groups concerning the primary outcome (functional status assessed by the physical component summary (PCS) score of the 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36) 6 months after randomization) and the secondary outcome (mortality and multiple organ failure) [69] . However, patients suffering from documented STSS represented < 10% of the study population making it impossible to draw definite conclusions for this subgroup. Another recent retrospective study could not demonstrate a benefit of routine use of IVIG in necrotizing fasciitis [70] . Guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) state that additional studies testing the efficacy of IVIG in this indication are needed and also point to the fact that not all IVIG preparations are alike, in particular with the titers of neutralizing antibodies [71] . Therefore, the use of IVIG in STSS cannot be routinely recommended and should be discussed on a case-by-case basis. Plasmapheresis has been proposed, but level of evidence for its use is even smaller than that for IVIG, and only based on isolated cases reports [72] .",

Antibiotic therapy should be given rapidly, associating high doses of parenteral beta-lactams plus clindamycin for its \"anti-toxin\" effect.
