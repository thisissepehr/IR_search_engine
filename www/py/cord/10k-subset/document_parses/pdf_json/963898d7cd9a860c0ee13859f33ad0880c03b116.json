Th us, there is an urgent need for eff ective therapies for ALI/ARDS. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are progenitor cells having self-renewal and multi-lineage diff erentiation capa bilities along with anti-infl ammatory and immuno-suppressive activities.

In the fi eld of ALI/ARDS cell-based therapeutics, most attention has focused on BMSCs, which have therapeutic effi cacy in rodent and human tissue models of ALI and sepsis [3, 4] . However, a number of barriers that may limit the clinical usefulness of BMSCs in human ALI/ARDS have been identifi ed [5, 6] ( Table 1) . Like BMSCs, ASCs have anti-infl ammatory and immuno-suppressive activities. ASCs inhibit immune cell activation and proliferation by inducing cell-to-cell contact and signaling and releasing mediators that limit tissue injury [7] . ASCs have greater anti-infl ammatory potential than BMSCs because they secrete higher levels of bioactive mediators [8] . Th is and other properties of ASCs (Table 1 ) make them an attractive alternative to BMSCs as cell-based therapeutics for human ALI/ARDS. Consistent with this concept, recent studies have shown that transplantation of autologous ASCs attenuates ischemia-reperfusion lung injury in rodents [9, 10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 295, "end": 298, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 299, "end": 301, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 422, "end": 425, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 426, "end": 428, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 668, "end": 671, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 790, "end": 793, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1085, "end": 1088, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1089, "end": 1092, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 431, "end": 439, "text": "Table 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 831, "end": 839, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Th e paper by Zhang and colleagues [11] builds upon this literature by examining whether ASCs have effi cacy in a model of direct ALI in mice.

There is an urgent need for eff ective therapies for acute lung injury. Zhang and colleagues tested the effi cacy of adipose-derived stem cells in acute lung injury in mice. When adipose-derived stem cells were delivered to mice that had been challenged with lipopolysaccharide, they potently limited acute lung infl ammation and injury in the mice, indicating that adipose-derived stem cells have therapeutic potential in acute lung injury in humans. Herein, we discuss the advantages and potential limitations of using adiposederived stem cells as therapeutics for human acute lung injury. that induces robust neutrophilic lung infl ammation. Additionally, the authors compared the therapeutic effi cacy of human versus murine ASCs. While both hASCs and mASCs attenuated ALI, it is noteworthy that for most ALI parameters examined, mASCs were more potent than hASCs. However, it is possible that hASCs have greater potency at restraining acute lung infl ammation in human subjects.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Th e study of Zhang and colleagues has several limitations that need to be addressed before ASCs can be advanced to human clinical trials. First, no single ALI animal model can completely reproduce all the pathologic features of human ALI/ARDS. While the LPS model studied by Zhang and coworkers induces robust neutrophilic lung infl ammation, it causes only modest alveolar-capillary barrier injury, which is a hallmark of ALI/ARDS. Th us, it will be important to test the effi cacy of ASCs in ALI models associated with severe ALI (such as hyperoxia and acid-induced ALI) and to assess the eff ects of ASCs on physiologic readouts of ALI, including lung compliance and hypoxemia. Second, ALI/ARDS in humans is often initiated by bacterial infections, but the model chosen (LPS-mediated ALI) causes sterile lung infl ammation. Given that ASCs suppress immune responses, it will be important to assess their eff ects on host responses to pathogens that can cause ALI/ARDS. Th ird, the mechanisms by which ASCs produce their benefi cial eff ects in this model were not addressed. Fourth, given that ARDS patients are often not treated within the fi rst 4 hours of illness (the single time-point when ASCs were delivered to mice in this study), future studies should determine how late in the disease course ASCs can be delivered and still induce a protective eff ect and for how long this protective eff ect is sustained. Moreover, the long-term safety of delivering ASCs was also not assessed in this study. It is noteworthy in this respect that hASCs promote the growth of tumor cells [12] . Th erefore, before ASCs can be used to treat human subjects, it will be necessary to investigate their longterm safety in animals.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1586, "end": 1590, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Th e study by Zhang and colleagues provides evidence that ASCs have potential as novel cell-based therapeutics for ALI/ARDS.
