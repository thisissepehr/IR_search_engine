There are extensive ongoing experimental efforts to understand the biological functions of the gene products encoded in the human genome. However, computational analysis can aid immensely in the interpretation of biological function by associating known functional/structural domains to the human proteins. In this article we have discussed the implications of such associations. The association of structural domains to human proteins could help in prioritizing the targets for structure determination in the structural genomics initiatives. The protein kinase family is one of the most frequently occurring protein domain families in the human proteome while P-loop hydrolase, which comprises many GTPases and ATPases, is a highly represented superfamily. Using the superfamily relationships between families of unknown and known structures we could increase structural information content of the human genome by about 5%. We could also make new associations of domain families to 33 human proteins that are potentially linked to genetically inherited diseases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "An important event in the history of humankind has been made at the turn of the 21st century in the form of the draft version of human genome data (1, 2) . This monumental effort provides us with an opportunity to better understand the various biological processes and possible cognition. The functional characterization of the gene products encoded in the human genome could provide insights into such complex biological process. There are various experimental endeavors to understand the functions of gene products encoded in the human genome. In addition to these experimental efforts, computational analyses of human proteins could form an important step in the functional inference of the genome data. The computational approaches for the prediction of functional features of proteins encoded in genomes relies on establishing relationships to homologues that are experimentally studied. There have been several attempts, using various sophisticated homology search tools, to assign functions to gene products encoded in various proteomes (see for example references 3 -8) . Such functional predictions could be used as a guiding tool in order to direct the relatively time consuming, more difficult and expensive experimental methods for exploring protein functions. Furthermore, functional inferences of human proteins that are implicated in diseases could provide valuable insights on the molecular basis of human diseases.

However, these distantly related proteins could often be identified with the use of threedimensional (3-D) structural information (11) as the structure is conserved better than sequence during evolution (12, 13) Thus, use of structural information could potentially enhance the functional assignments (14 -17) . Moreover, structure prediction with relevant biochemical motifs can provide more detailed functional insights than sequence comparisons alone (18 -20) . The search methods for such an analysis could be improved by the use of multiple sequence alignment of the homologues in a family, which can indicate structurally/ functionally important positions. The information in these multiple sequence alignments can be converted into Position Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSM) usually referred as profiles (21) or into a probabilistic model called the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (22) .

Interestingly, 'Family A-G protein-coupled receptor-like' superfamily that consists of many receptors as other most populous superfamilies. The complete list of structural superfamilies that occur in human genome with their respective frequency of occurrence in human genome is provided at http://hodgkin.mbu.iisc.ernet.in/*human. Figure 4 shows population distribution of few most populated folds, which occur in the human proteome. Figure  5 shows the 3-D folding patterns in the most populated folds. The C2H2 and C2HC zinc finger is the most frequent occurring fold in human genome. For the reasons mentioned before, we have excluded C2H2 and C2HC zinc finger from this analysis. Ferredoxin-like fold has the highest number of superfamilies in the human proteome as well as in SCOP. However, 16 of the superfamilies occur in the human proteome out of the currently known 36 superfamilies in the ferredoxin fold. Ribonuclease H-like motif fold has six out of currently known seven superfamilies in the human proteome. Except the superfamily of hypothetical protein MTH1175 from methanobacterium, all other superfamilies of Ribonuclease H-like motif occur in the human proteome. These superfamilies are Actin-like ATPase domain, Creatinase/ prolidase N-terminal domain, Ribonuclease H-like, translational machinery components, DNA repair protein Muts domain II and Methylated DNA-protein cysteine methyltransferase domain. This could be expected as the nucleic acid binding/related superfamilies are highly represented in the human proteome.
