Venoarterial and venovenous extracorporeal devices require anticoagulant therapy to avoid thromboembolic complications, (for example, circuit thrombosis or pulmonary or systemic emboli) [2, 4] . In addition, coagulation-cascade activation by the circuit and the membrane leads to platelet and coagulation-factor consumption, thereby increasing the risk of bleeding [5] . Recently, it was suggested that von Willebrand factor abnormalities induced by extracorporeal circulation could trigger acquired von Willebrand syndrome and could explain, at least in part, the elevated bleeding rate in these patients [6] . Indeed, hemorrhaging represents the most-frequent severe adverse event in patients receiving extracorporeal circulatory or respiratory support, with reported rates up to 30% [2, 4] . Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa; NovoSeven, Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark) is a genetically engineered concentrate of human coagulation FVII that was originally designed to treat life-threatening hemorrhages in patients with hemophilia A or B [7] . To date, on-label indications of rFVIIa are prevention of bleeding for surgical interventions or bleeding episodes in patients with either congenital hemophilia A or B with antibody inhibitors against standard-factor replacements, or acquired hemophilia, or congenital factor VII deficiency. In recent years, its off-label use has increased in cardiac surgery [8] [9] [10] , liver transplantation [11] , or trauma [12] without affecting mortality rates in those settings [13, 14] . rFVIIa has also been used successfully in infants and adults receiving ECMO [15, 16] . However, circuit thrombosis, fatal or not, has been described for ECMO patients given rFVIIa with or without other prothrombotic drugs [17, 18] . Because clotting of the circuit is the second most frequent complication after bleeding, the use of fVIIa may increase this risk and thus be more deleterious than beneficial.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 144, "end": 147, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 148, "end": 151, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 152, "end": 155, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 344, "end": 347, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 348, "end": 350, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 523, "end": 526, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 764, "end": 767, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 944, "end": 947, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 948, "end": 950, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1209, "end": 1212, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1575, "end": 1578, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1579, "end": 1582, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1583, "end": 1587, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1612, "end": 1616, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1629, "end": 1633, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1686, "end": 1690, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1691, "end": 1694, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1773, "end": 1777, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1778, "end": 1781, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1919, "end": 1923, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1924, "end": 1927, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Because data are scarce on rFVIIa use in patients with ECMO, we retrospectively reviewed 15 consecutive patients administered rFVIIa for life-threatening intractable bleeding while receiving ECMO and reviewed all the cases reported in the literature.

For 14 patients, bleeding dramatically decreased after rFVIIa infusion without relapse. Although no massive thrombotic events were observed in our patients, two ECMO circuits were changed during the 48 hours after rFVIIa administration because of oxygenator clotting that may have resulted from this procoagulant treatment. Those circuits were changed 8 and 11 days after ECMO initiation, which, in our experience, may be the normal lifetime of membranes. Moreover, one patient progressed to brain death early after rFVIIa infusion, and because ischemic stroke could not be excluded as its cause, a thrombotic complication could not be ruled out. However, another explanation in this patient could be a cerebral hemorrhage as the cause of death. If so, and despite the use of rFVIIa, the rate of cerebral hemorrhage in this population would be very high (13%). Although mortality was high, 40% of our patients with intractable bleeding survived. As a comparison, the survival rate of other ECMO patients (not having received rFVIIa) during the same time period in our unit was 55% (difference not statistically significant) [21] . To the best of our knowledge, we report the largest cohort of adult ECMO patients treated with rFVIIa. Several reports are available in the literature, nine of them focusing on pediatric patients (for a total of 48 infants) and six on adults (for a total of 9 adults) [15] [16] [17] [18] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] ( Table 3) . All authors concurred about its control of bleeding and decrease of blood-products requirements. Some patients experienced circuit thromboses or oxygenator failure, and eight had systemic thromboses or emboli. Most events occurred in pediatric patients, and another procoagulant treatment was given in some cases. rFVIIa was given in doses ranging from 40 to 220 \u03bcg/kg. For the 26 patients for whom these data were available, eight who experienced thrombotic events had not received higher doses than had those without: 90 \u03bcg/kg (83 to 141) versus 192 \u03bcg/kg (93 to 252), respectively (P = 0.46). In our patients, except for one patient who progressed to brain death and in whom a major stroke could not be ruled out, no major thrombotic episode occurred. However, we did not measure thrombosis and fibrinolysis with thromboelastogram, D-dimer, or other tests. We thus cannot exclude that in some patients, the development of multiorgan failure may be related to, or have been favored by microthrombosis of end organs, and that this may have affected the mortality. Nevertheless, the lack of thrombotic complications in our patients contrasts with the high rate quoted in the literature. We can only speculate on the causes of this difference. We do not think it could be related to the dose of rFVIIa, because patients who experienced thrombotic events in the literature had not received higher doses than had ours. Interestingly, most thrombotic episodes occurred in pediatric patients: of the 16 patients who experienced a major thrombotic event, 14 were infants (30% of this population), and only two were adults (22% of this population). This higher rate in pediatric patients may be explained by differences in circuit size and by differences of clotting system between infants and adults.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1226, "end": 1230, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1501, "end": 1505, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1506, "end": 1510, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1511, "end": 1515, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1516, "end": 1520, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1521, "end": 1525, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1530, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1531, "end": 1535, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1536, "end": 1540, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1541, "end": 1545, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1546, "end": 1550, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1551, "end": 1555, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1556, "end": 1560, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1561, "end": 1565, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1568, "end": 1576, "text": "Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Many possibilities could explain bleeding in ECMO patients.

Moreover, Yank et al.

Primary clotting disorders represented roughly 5% of off-label rFVIIa use in this recent analysis [14] . rFVIIa is an effective agent to treat refractory bleeding in von Willebrand disease patients and to treat or prevent bleeding in patients with alloantibodies or autoantibodies directed against von Willebrand factor [33] .

Except one patient who progressed to brain death and in whom a major stroke could not be ruled out, no major thrombotic episode occurred, but such events have been reported, mostly in pediatric patients, without any dose/effect relation. Despite a high mortality, 40% of our patients survived, similar to the previously published rate [15] [16] [17] [18] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , and without statistical difference as compared with the 55% survival rate of our ECMO patients who did not receive rFVIIa.
