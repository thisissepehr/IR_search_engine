            "text": "In hospital isolation rooms, door operation can lead to containment failures and airborne pathogen dispersal into the surrounding spaces. Sliding doors can reduce the containment failure arising from the door motion induced airflows, as compared to the hinged doors that are typically used in healthcare facilities. Such airflow leakage can be measured quantitatively using tracer gas techniques, but detailed observation of the turbulent flow features is very difficult. However, a comprehensive understanding of these flows is important when designing doors to further reduce such containment failures. Experiments and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling, by using Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) flow solver, were used to study airflow patterns in a full-scale mock-up, consisting of a sliding door separating two identical rooms (i.e. one isolation room attached to an antechamber). A single sliding door open/ hold-open/ closing cycle was studied. Additional variables included human passage through the doorway and imposing a temperature difference between the two rooms. The general structures of computationally-simulated flow features were validated by comparing the results to smoke visualizations of identical full-scale experimental set-ups. It was found that without passage the air volume leakage across the doorway was first dominated by vortex shedding in the wake of the door, but during a prolonged hold-open period a possible temperature difference soon became the predominant driving force. Passage generates a short and powerful pulse of leakage flow rate even if the walker stops to wait for the door to open.",

Patients with such hazardous and highly contagious diseases are usually placed in negative pressure isolation rooms to prevent pathogen-laden air from spreading to adjacent spaces and hence possibly infecting staff, visitors and other patients. This containment can, however, be disrupted by many factors (Tang et al. 2006) . For instance, door opening and human passage through the doorway have been estimated to be among the most important factors causing containment failures in isolation rooms (Tang et al. 2005 (Tang et al. , 2006 (Tang et al. , 2013 Pavelchak et al. 2000) as the door-opening motion disrupts the negative pressure containment, allowing pathogen-laden air to leak out through the doorway.",

However, only aerosolized and fully airborne pathogens are capable of long-range transmission, as larger droplets are subject to gravitational settling. The division between airborne and droplet transmission is complicated by the fact that in air with low relative humidity (RH), droplets evaporate rapidly, leaving behind droplet nuclei that are airborne.

Choi and Edwards (2012) simulated 26 different cases in a three-room geometry with a vestibule between a contaminated room and a clean room, using a gaseous contaminant. Their simulations included two door types (hinged/sliding) with different, short cycle times, human passages through the doors with different walking speeds, human plume, ventilation (with an exhaust in the vestibule and small gaps below the doors), and various negative pressures in the contaminated room. The amounts of contaminant migrated from the dirty room to the vestibule and from the vestibule to the clean room were reported in each case.

On the anteroom side of the doorway there was a single sliding door. It was opened and closed with a 1.2 m long linear movement, towards the viewer in Fig. 1 . The dimensions of the door were 1.22 m (width), 2.125 m (height), and 0.055 m (thickness incl. seal). The (inner) dimensions of each room were 4.7 m (width), 4.0 m (length), and 3.0 m (height), giving a volume of 56.4 m 3 . These room sizes were used already in previous studies by the same authors Kalliom\u00e4ki et al. 2015 Kalliom\u00e4ki et al. , 2016 . Moreover, the rooms were chosen to be large enough not to restrict the door opening generated flows in the proximity of the doorway and manikin passage induced flows further away inside the rooms. A manikin standing on a very low profile wheeled cart, moving along a rail, was used to simulate a nurse walking through the doorway. The cart and the door were both computercontrolled. There were two temperature sensors (Craftemp thermistors) in each of the rooms (at 1 m and 2.6 m above the floor) for monitoring the temperature and possible temperature stratifications. Additionally, there were fans in both of the rooms to ensure proper mixing of the air inside the rooms. In this baseline study, no ventilation was applied.",

We studied this effect experimentally by applying a temperature difference of 2.2 \u00b0C. In the simulations, we used temperature differences of 0 \u00b0C, 0.2 \u00b0C, 1.0 \u00b0C, 2.0 \u00b0C and 2.2 \u00b0C. The small temperature difference 0.2 \u00b0C was chosen because the accuracy of the temperature measurement in the experiments was 0.2 \u00b0C. Therefore, a small temperature difference up to 0.2 \u00b0C can also have existed in the isothermal case. For the same reason, also the temperature difference of 2.0 \u00b0C (i.e. 0.2 \u00b0C below the 2.2 \u00b0C used in the experiments) was included in the simulations.",

They obtained Ri = 0.109 for a walking human, indicating that the flow is dominated by forced convection, or the wake (Edge et al. 2005) .

The two tracers used were N 2 O and SF 6 . Prior to dosing into the rooms, these heavier-than-air tracers were diluted with clean air to prevent them from stratifying near the floor. The door (and passage) cycle experiment was then repeated 6 or 7 times, so that normally in the initial state some mixing had already taken place during the preceding experiments. This had to be taken into account when calculating the AVMs from the concentrations of both tracers prior to and after the door cycle (see Eq. (1) in Saarinen et al. 2015) . The concentrations of both the tracers in both the rooms were sampled by a Br\u00fcel&Kjaer 1302 gas analyser. Only one gas analyser was used in the experiments. It was connected to a multiplexer which allowed sampling from one location at a time. The samples were collected continuously and in succession from three different locations: isolation room, anteroom and surrounding laboratory for background values. The sampling interval was c. 90 s so that two samples from the same location were separated c. 270 s in time. Perforated sampling tubes ran across both rooms (c. 90 cm above the floor), enabling simultaneous sampling from multiple points. Also, long sampling interval ensured adequate flushing of the sampling tubes. The fans in each of the rooms ensured a proper mixing and uniform distribution of the tracer gases. The fans were shut down prior to the door operation not to disturb the door generated flows. After each experiment (including 6-7 door openings each separated by 45 minutes) the tracer gases were flushed away to ensure clean environment before a new measurement. When experiments with the temperature difference were carried out, a convector heater was placed close to middle of the isolation room. In this case additional temperature sensors were placed around the doorway to monitor the uniformity of the temperature field close to the doorway.",

Without passage, the time step was mostly between 0.01 s and 0.03 s. In the case containing passage, time step lengths of 0.002 s and 0.004 s were used until the door had closed, after which it was increased to 0.01 s. Figure 2 displays the two densest meshes, used in the final simulations. The smaller one, hereafter called the \"normal\" mesh, comprised of 10.7 million nodes. It was used in most of the simulations. To reduce its size, the highest density mesh was only used in the paths of the moving door and nurse. A dense mesh is necessary in this volume not only to resolve the air currents, but also because the immersed solid method applied uses the underlying mesh to resolve the surfaces of the moving objects. Normally, time-dependent flows in rooms are modelled by using Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) simulation. In the separated flow regions, however, the unsteady large-scale structures are better resolved by LES (Salim et al. 2011) . This was also seen in our study when comparing URANS with Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model against LES even when using the same mesh and time step, see Fig. 3 . Table 1 show the effect of increasing mesh density in the basic case not containing passage or temperature difference. Four different meshes were tested, with 0.36, 1.3, 10.7, and 15.6 million nodes in the fluid domain. In the first three cases the computational mesh was an unstructured pure tetra mesh. In the densest mesh tested, the additional refinement was only performed at the doorway. In the refined volume, hexagonal cells were then used and so positioned that the two side surfaces of the moving door coincided with limiting surfaces between cell layers, see again Fig. 2 . In this way, the surface of the moving door could be resolved exactly.",

Resolved turbulent vortices in the simulated flow can be illustrated using vorticity \uf0d1\u00b4v. Vorticity identifies rotation from the lateral change of velocity components, and is therefore also sensitive to pure shear. Therefore, vorticity attains large absolute values also at the surface layers of moving objects. On the other hand, negative shear in an irrotational vortex can partly or totally cancel the rotational vorticity. A better way to recognize a vortex is e.g. to use the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor, usually denoted by Q, which reveals the vortex cores and is calculated by default by some CFD codes.

The number of bulges resolved by LES increases as the mesh is refined, and the 15.6 million nodes mesh correctly resolves four bulges, although they are somewhat narrower than in the experiments. These bulges are a strong evidence of a vortex structure behind the moving door. Figure 6 shows the simulated vortex structures of the moving door (without passage) for the 1.3 M mesh, for the 10.7 M mesh used in most simulations in this paper, and for the 15.6 M mesh. This is done by drawing the z-component of vorticity \uf0d1\u00b4v , together with the directional arrows, just after the door has opened completely. The arrows are normalized (i.e. of constant length) and projected onto the figure plane 1 m above the floor, so they show only the Fig. 5 The front of smoke protruding out of the doorway during the door opening phase (here without prior manikin approach) is undulating due to the flow structures in the wake behind the door. This phenomenon offers a means to test the simulated flow field against experiments The oscillating migration flow rate due to vortex shedding in the door-opening stage is clearly seen in Fig. 7 top. As mesh refinement intensifies these oscillations due to better resolved vortices, the migration flow rate is also increased. Although more fine structure is resolved in the door opening phase when using finer mesh, this effect is however smoothed out when integrating the total AVM, at least in our case.",

Plotting the AVM-values at t = 17 s (the moment the sliding door has just closed) as a function of \u0394T, and adding one simulation with \u0394T = 1 \u00b0C, gives the curve shown in Fig. 4 (bottom) . This curve is strongly dependent on the total door cycle time, because the flows driven by \u0394T need some time to build up. In our case, with the cycle length of 17 s, temperature difference has a drastic effect. In Fig. 7 the simulated time axis has been continued 10 s after the door has closed in order to better show the slowly fading, small spurious air drift through the closed door. It is seen that even though the mesh refinement has no effect on this drift, it is intensified in the presence of temperature difference. The flows generated by temperature difference are not visible in the early stages of the door cycle, unless \u0394T is very large (Figs. 7 and 8) . On the other hand, even a temperature difference of a fraction of 1 K has a significant effect during the entire door cycle, when compared to the effect of the sliding door alone. Therefore, since the tracer gas measurements only give the total AVM over an entire door cycle, they are very sensitive to temperature difference between the two rooms, and are best suited in validating the simulated effect Fig. 8 Simulated AVM(t) curves as compared with measurements of total AVM without passage, but with two different \u0394T. The minima and maxima of the measurements are drawn by short dashed lines, and the means by short continuous lines of \u0394T. Since the temperature was not necessarily constant all over the rooms, and the temperature sensors were aside of the doorway, the accuracy of measured \u0394T was approximated as about 0.2 \u00b0C. The experiments were performed at intended temperature differences \u0394T = 0 and, without passage, also at \u0394T = 2.2 \u00b0C, so that the actual values should locate somewhere in the intervals [0, 0.2 \u00b0C] and [2.0 \u00b0C, 2.4 \u00b0C], respectively. As Fig. 8 and Table 1 show, the simulated values of AVM at \u0394T = 0.2 \u00b0C and 2.0 \u00b0C coincide with the measurements (mean values of series of measurements), so they just fall into these uncertainty intervals. Thus, simulations could reproduce the effect of \u0394T on the total AVM. Figure 9 shows a side view of the smoke front proceeding from the anteroom into the isolation room, as given by an experiment (intended \u0394T = 0) and simulations using the normal mesh with 10.7 million nodes. There are three simulated cases, one isothermal with \u0394T = 0 and others with larger temperature in the isolation room (\u0394T = 0.2 \u00b0C and \u0394T = 2 \u00b0C). The instant of time is 7 s after the door has fully opened, or at t = 10 s in the lowermost plot of Fig. 1 . (It takes a few seconds until the effect of \u0394T is clearly visible.) While in the simulation with \u0394T = 0 the front is vertical, the experimental one is somewhat inclined corresponding better with the simulation case \u0394T = 0.2 \u00b0C, consistently with Fig. 8 . This amount of temperature difference might well have been present in the doorway during the experiments without being detected, due to the locations of the temperature sensors. Fig. 9 The effect of temperature difference on the advancing smoke front becomes clearly visible a few seconds after the door has opened. A comparison of experiment and simulations without passage The validation results presented above suggest that the LES, using the normal mesh with 10.7 million nodes, gives a realistic picture of the flow features responsible for air transfer between the rooms. This, in turn, encourages using the simulated flow to analyse flow properties not revealed experimentally.",

While LES is computationally heavier, it can resolve the small and rapid flow features in the wakes of the moving door and manikin down to the grid resolution. This is very useful if we want a detailed picture of what is going on during the different stages of the door and passage cycle.",

Simulated smoke visualizations are a recent tool, and here we have extended its use by analysing the shape of the advancing smoke front. The vortex shedding behind the moving door was seen both in the simulated and experimental smoke fronts. The findings and methods from this study using a combination of experiments and CFD modelling can be used to suggest some practical preventive actions to reduce isolation room containment failure. For example, the flow rate curves can be applied to optimize the door opening and closing speeds used when programming automated sliding doors. The simulations also demonstrated, how important it is to minimise the temperature differences between the isolation and anterooms-and neighbouring areas-though this may be impractical given the natural differences in patients, staff and equipment thermal loads between these various areas. It was seen that temperature difference became significant only a few seconds after the door had opened, which emphasizes the effect of the total door cycle time.",
