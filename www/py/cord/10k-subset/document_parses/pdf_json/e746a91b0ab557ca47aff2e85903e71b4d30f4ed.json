Numerous Blastomyces dermatitidis organisms were seen within the alveolar spaces, which appeared packed with fungi (Fig. 2) . They revealed the characteristic single broad based budding. The sizes were quite variable, being on average about 20 ~tm with many larger fungi in the range of 28-35 ~tm. The double-contoured cell walls and the cytoplasmic mass were stained by the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain, with the cytoplasm being often retracted from the cell wall (Fig. 2b) .

Coronal sections of the brain showed an irregular partially necrotic highly vascular tumor in the left temporal, parietal and occipital white matter with involvement of the thalamus and basal ganglia and extension to the ventricular surface. Microscopic examination revealed a high grade astrocytoma (glioblastoma muhiforme) with extensive radiation necrosis and radiation vasculopathy.

Fungi were not seen within reactive or neoplastic astrocytes, but rather within microglia or multinucleated giant cells. They were not identified in the pituitary, pineal, or choroid plexus.

Most organisms were extracellular; due to postmortem artifact and poor preservation of host tissues, the detailed morphological appearances of cells harboring the intracellular fungi could not be commented upon.The fungi had lamellated cells walls with two distinct layers separated by a relatively electron-lucent intervening zone (Fig. 4) . The outer aspect of the cell wall presented an irregular external surface. The thickness of the cell walls was variable ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 p~m. The organelles included moderate numbers of mitochondria, glycogen and lipid granules, a few freelying as well as membrane-bound structures with electron-dense lamellated profiles, a few tubular structures, and multiple nuclei (Fig. 4) .The nuclei had one to two nucleoli and showed some heterochromatin condensations (Figs. 4, 5) . A few fungi contained numerous mitochondria. A number of cells in the process of budding were encountered: the initiation of budding was marked by a shearing of the outermost electron-dense lamellated layers of the cell wall (Fig. 5) . The inner layers of the cell wall persisted over the protruding bud and covered the daughter cell and the broad-based septum (Fig. 5) . Scattered bacteria were also found in the lung sample.",

The organism enters the body via the lungs with subsequent dissemination to other organs and patients most often present with cutaneous or pulmonary complaints, although the infection may be asymptomatic [18, 291 . Blastomycosis involving the central nervous system (CNS) has been reported infrequently in the literature almost invariably in association with systemic infection [1, 4, 10, 14, 15, 20, 21, 23-25, 27, 30] . The estimates of CNS involvement range from 3 %-10% in clinical studies and from 6 %-33 % in autopsy studies [4, 10, 27] . Patients with CNS blastomycosis may present with acute or chronic meningitis or mass lesions of the brain or spinal cord including multiple or single abscesses or granulomas. A clinical diagnosis of CNS blastomycosis is difficult, and in many of the cases a presumptive diagnosis has been based on the identification or isolation of the organism from other sites. Although, the diagnosis has been made on the basis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, CSF smears or cultures may be negative [15] .",

Excellent preservation allowed for clear documentation of the ultrastructural morphology, espedally with reference to the budding characteristics of this pathogen. Our observations confirm the findings reported in the literature with regards to the size and distribution of various organelles [6, 20] . In an ultrastructural study of a cerebellar blastomycoma, Mirra et al. [20] , described fungi which were intracellular in membrane-bound compartments within multinucleated giant cells and macrophages. In our case, besides organisms within macrophages in the liver, most yeasts were extracellular, and in an excellent state of preservtion compared to the host tissues which were autolyzed. Organisms in various stages of budding were identified: it is apparent that the outermost layers of the cell wall are sheared off at the initiation of this process 423 with contribution of the inner layers to the septum and the new coat of the daughter cell. The most abundant organelle was the mitochondrion. The mitochondria showed well-preserved cristae and electron-dense particulate material reminiscent of calcium. The lamellated cell walls ranged from 0.3 to 0.8 ~tm and the outermost layers which were most electron dense was ragged with irregular surface projections. A relatively electronlucent zone separated the outer layers from the innermost electron-dense layers of the cell wall. Tubular structures with a lumen were seen coursing the cytoplasm with no communication to the cell membrane. Other features included multiple nuclei with prominent nucleoli, membrane-bound lametlated or membranous whorls akin to myelin figures in mammalian cells, electron-dense cleft-like profiles, and moderate numbers of lipid droplets, and diffusely distributed particulate glycogen.",

In this regard, it is of interest that our patient was a city dweller and had no occupational exposure to wood, soil, or animals. Immunosuppression related to steroid therapy was presumably the predisposing factor in our patient for development of fnlminant blastomycosis. Although the autopsy was limited to examination of lungs, liver and brain only, it is evident that the patient had hematogenous spread of the disease, with fungal organisms demonstrable within cells of the monocyte-macrophage system and also within vascular spaces in the lungs. There were no visible skin lesions in our patient, thus the portal of entry and original infection is most likely the lung and this fulminant infection perhaps represents endogenous reactivation of a latent infection, which is a wellrecognized phenomenon [8, 16] .",
