The emergence of oseltamivir-resistant 2009 H1N1 virus has been rarely identified, up to September 24, 2009, 28 resistant viruses have been detected worldwide, characterized and reported to WHO. Twelve of these drug-resistant viruses were from people using oseltamivir for post-exposure prophylaxis. Six were from patients with severe immunosuppression using oseltamivir for treatment. Four were from other patients receiving oseltamivir treatment. Two were from patients who were not taking oseltamivir for either treatment or prophylaxis. In December 2009, WHO reported two clusters of patients infected with oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 viruses. Both clusters, detected in Wales, the United Kingdom, and North Carolina (USA), occurred in a single ward in a hospital, and both involved patients whose immune systems were severely compromised or suppressed. All of the resistant viruses carried the same H275Y mutation, indicating resistance to oseltamivir but susceptibility to the second antiviral drug, zanamivir.

Pandemics have been similar in several aspects, yet each has unique characteristics probably based on the complexity of the viral-host interactions. To predict the next pandemic, we should think about the feasibility of predicting the unpredictable. Many fundamental questions remain unsolved. During the 21st century, pandemic medical progress in antiviral medication and management of critically ill patients has been evident. In addition to availability of antiviral drugs, critical care, and multidisciplinary management teams, more timely and widespread public health interventions might be the key to better outcomes. Learning from the past is necessary to identify the most effective management strategies and to prepare for the future, unavoidable, next pandemic.",
