The mutants exhibited Mterations in plaque morphology, hemagglutination, and virulence in mice, but, were not temperature-sensitive. Agglutination of human erythrocytes by mengovirus was dependent on the presence of sialic acid on the erythrocyte surface; however, free sialic acid failed to inhibit hemagglutination. Glycophorin, the major sialoglycoprotein of human erythrocyte membranes, exhibited receptor specificity for wild-type virus, but not for mutants 205 or 280. Cross-linking studies indicated that glycophorin exhibited binding specificity for the alpha (1 D) structural protein. The LDs0 titers for wild-type mengovirus were 7 and 1500 plaque forming units (PFU) in mice infected intracraniMly (IC) and intraperitoneally (IP), respectively. However, mice infected IC or IP with 106 or 107 PFU of mutant 205 or 280 did not exhibit symptoms indicative of virus infection. Revertants were isolated from the brains of mice infected with mutant 205, but not from the brains of mice infected with mutant 280. The biologieM characterization of the revertants indicated that hemagglutination and virulence may be phenotypieMly-linked traits.",

Although labeled wild-type mengovirus was displaced h~to the pellet fraction in the presence of glycophorin, the single fraction difference observed for the migration of mutants 205 and 280 in the presence of glycophorin was not significant. These data suggest that wild-tsq~e mengovirus interacted with glycophorin specifically and that glycophorin may function as a receptor for mengovirus on human type 0 er.%hroeytes. An attempt was made to determine which of the structural proteins of mengovirus function in the binding of glycophorin. Glycophorin was mixed with TDI, a heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent. Glycophorin-TDI complexes were mixed with purified ~4C-labeled wild-type mengovirus and cross-linked to virion structural proteins which were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In this experiment any structurM proteins of mengovirus cross-linked to glycophorin molecules would not enter the resolving gel. Densitometer tracings of the treated and untreated samples are shown in Fig. 2 . The four major structural proteins of wild-type mengovirus were resolved (panel A); alpha (1 D), beta (1 B), gamma (1 C) and delta (1 A). A substantial decrease in the amount of the alpha (1 D) protein was observed in the lanes of glyeophorin-eross-linked virus (panels B and C). A decrease in the amount of the gamma (1 C) protein was also observed. The amounts of the beta (1 B) and delta (1 A) proteins observed decreased slightly and in the presence of increasing amounts of cross-linked glycophorin. These data indicated that the alpha (1 D) and gamma (1 C) structural proteins were cross-linked to glyeophorin and that glyeophorin had a greater affinity for the alpha (1 D) protein than for the gamma (1 C) protein. Since the amount of the gamma (1 C) protein cross-linked to glyeophorin was not as extensive as that of the alpha (1 D) protein, it is possible that cross-linkage of the gamma (t C) protein may occur subsequent to its binding of the alpha (1 D) protein. TDI molecules located distal to the glyeophorin-mengovirus binding site(s) may be more available to bind to positively charged residues on the gamma (1 C) protein nonspeeifieally when increasing amounts of cross-linked glycophorin are added to the reaction.",

Two-fold dilutions of aseitic fluid were mixed with a dilution of virus, incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes, and assayed for plaque production on BHK-21 cell monolayers. The reciprocal of the dilution capable of neutralizing 50 percent of the plaques produced by a dilution of virus (PNs0 tiger) was 1182 for the neutralization of the wild-type virus. The PNso tigers were 1970 and 2127 for neutrMization of mutants 205 and 280, respectively. The PNso tigers were 812 and 914 for the neutralization of revertants 205-A 7 and 205-D 2, respectively. These data indicated that a significantly greater amount of antiserum was required to neutralize the revertants in comparison to the wild-type and mutant viruses (p < 0.08, Student t test). The greater resistance of the revertants to neutralization may be a result of the selective pressure generated by immune surveillance in mutant virus-infected mice or may be a :measure of the frequency of stable variants produce during the passage of virus in cultured cells. In addition, the differences in neutralization tiger are likely to reflect, changes in the surface structure of the mutant and rever~ant viruses relative to the wild-type virus.",

Although a small amount of virus was detected in the brains of several mice infected IC with mutants 205 and 280, these mice did not exhibit symptoms of virus infection. However, AMAKO and DALES (2) and COLTER et al. (13) have demonstrated that, S (small plaque) variants are virulent for mice when infected IP, although to a much lesser extent than the L (large plaque) variants. COLTE~ et al.

Although the small plaque phenotype is shared by the S variants and mutants 205 and 280, clearly the pathogenicity of these viruses for mice is distinct. In addition, CAI~IPBELL and COLTE~ (11) have reported that the distribution of the L, M, and S plaque variants in mouse tissues are the same when lethal doses of these viruses are administered IP. Although the spleen and lymph nodes are the primary-target tissues for mengovirus, the greatest concentration of virus is found in the brain and spinal cord. We demonstrated high titers of virus in the brains of mice infected IP with wild-type virus. However, no virus was detected in the brains of mice infected IP with either mutant suggesting that the mutants were unable to infect the nervous system. HA + revert.ants were isolated from the brains of three different mice infected IC with mutant 205. In addition to regaining agglutination activity, the revertants were also virulent for mice, suggesting that hemagglutination and virulence may be phenotypieMly-linked traits. However, the revertants required 103-to 104-fold more P F U to kill mice than wild-type virus and the relative plaque size of the revertants was intermediate between wild-type and the mutants, suggesting that the degree of virulence of a particular mengovirus may be linked to its relative plaque size.",

However, sialic acid failed to inhibit the agglutination reaction. Therefore, sialic acid must be recognized by the virus in a particular conformation or charge and/or in conjunction with other molecules (proteins, lipids, or other carbohydrates). BUl~NESS and PARDOE (9) reported similar results for the agglutination of human erythroeytes by EMC virus. Loss of hemaggluti-:nation activity was associated with treatment of erythrocytes with neuraminidase. This suggests that the mechanisms for mengovirus and EMC virus hemagglutination may be similar.",

BUI~I~ESS and PARDOE (i0) have demonstrated that a particular chymotryptic peptide of glycophorin serves as a receptor for EMC virus and that sialic acid residues are necessary for its receptor activity. Since this peptide forms aggregates in solution, it is postulated that the receptor activity of the glycopeptide is due to its multivalence in the aggregated form. These data are consistent with ours showing that large amounts of glycophorin (5 to 50 ~g) were necessary to alter the migration of wild-type virus in sucrose gradients. Since glycophorin aggregates in the presence or absence of SDS, a large number of the aggregates may be necessary to displace the virus into the pellet fractions.",

Glycophorin exhibited binding affinity for the alpha (1 D) and gamma (1 C) proteins, however, the amount of the gamma (1 C) protein cross-linked to glyeophorin was not as extensive as that of the alpha (1 D) protein. Therefore, cross-linkage of this protein may occur subsequent to the binding of the alpha (1 D) protein. Once glyeophorin is bound to the alpha (1 D) protein, TDI molecules located distal to the glycophorin-mengovirus binding site(s) on the glyeophorin molecule may bind to the gamma (1 C) protein, forming alpha (1 D)-glyeophoringamma (1 C) multimers. HOI~DERN et al. (19) have shown that cross-linking reagents such as TDI, which act by binding positively charged amino acids, may cause the formation of alpha (1 D)-gamma (1 C) directs.
