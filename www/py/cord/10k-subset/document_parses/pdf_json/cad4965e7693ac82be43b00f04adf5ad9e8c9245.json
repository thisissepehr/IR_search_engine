Data are also presented on aphid catches in suction traps at two heights and in light traps. Apart from colour sensitivity (yellow versus white) there was apparently a separate response to colour which in some species varied with season. Within yellow-sensitive species there was also a differential response to colour. With the experimental methods used, it was not possible to define mathematically the active and passive landing components on cylindrical traps. Though the active landing component was large it varied between aphid species. Most species caught on horizontal traps at ground level had been flying above I m. In some species the response of males to colour and their landing behaviour differed from that of viviparae and oviparae.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "BY JOHN A'BROOK Welsh Plant Breeding Station, Aberystwyth"}, {"text": "Four years data from suction traps suggest that aphid species can be divided into three categories on the basis of the height at which they normally fly.

From 1969 aphid suction traps and a moth trap were operated in conjunction with the Rothamsted Insect Survey (Taylor & French, 1970) , allowing a more accurate determination of aphid incidence, density at different heights and attraction to light. line of traps was at right angles to the prevailing winds), with vertical and horizontal traps alternating. Eighteen paint finishes (Leyland Paints Ltd.) were randomized separately between the two types of trap ( The height from which aphids were attracted to horizontal traps was studied using yellow water-bowl traps (Moericke, 1951) 0.23 m diameter placed 1.5 m apart.

He showed that not only were different species able to differentiate between pure unsaturated colours (i.e. without any tint caused by the addition of white), but that they also respond differentially to tints of a given colour and that the response varied at different times of day. The effect of trap colour on aphid catches may have been due to differences in the intensity of reflected light. The covering of plastic coated with banding grease would have reduced the reflectance of each colour and the difference in reflectance between colours. The reflectance of ultraviolet from some lead-base paints was eliminated due to the absorption by banding grease (Entwistle, 1963) . For this reason catches were not corrected for the manufacturer's reflectance values (Table I ). The data show that with most species some colours attracted greater numbers of aphids than others with higher reflectance values. Moreover, in some cases where the reflectance value of colours was the same there were still differences in the numbers of aphids caught. Thus despite possible effects due to the intensity of reflected light, there appears to have been an overriding response due to trap colour. Moericke (1955) showed that some aphid species sensitive to colour during the landing phase (yellow versus white) also differentiated between colours. Cartier & Auclair (1964) have shown a similar response with feeding apterae. The experiments reported here showed both colour sensitivity and differentiation between colours in some species whether caught on horizontal traps or when caught passively or actively on cylindrical traps. Further, in some yellow-sensitive species the response differed between the two types of trap with months and with colours. This was probably due to the alternation between summer and autumn migrants, and supports Moericke's (1969) suggestion that with alternation of host plants gynoparae should show a different reaction to colour than summer migrants. The results also show that the response by males to colour differs from that of oviparae and viviparae on both trap types. There were also differences in behaviour between the sexes in the two trials on landing response. Taylor & Palmer (1972) , on the basis of a comparison of yellow-bowl and suction-trap catches at the same height and site, have suggested that grass-feeding species are not yellow-sensitive. Whether this is a better criterion for judging colour sensitivity than Moericke's is debatable, but the results presented show some grass-feeding species to be both yellow-sensitive and to differentiate between colours.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 822, "end": 839, "text": "(Entwistle, 1963)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1348, "end": 1363, "text": "Moericke (1955)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1499, "end": 1523, "text": "Cartier & Auclair (1964)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1997, "end": 2014, "text": "Moericke's (1969)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2359, "end": 2381, "text": "Taylor & Palmer (1972)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 927, "end": 935, "text": "(Table I", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "D I S C U S S I O N"}, {"text": "The capping experiment showed that the active landing component of the catch, as against that caught by impaction (Heathcote, 1957) on cylindrical traps, varied between species and could not usually be defined.

The horizontal traps used in this trial may have been too large, since the theoretical area of the cylindrical trap visible to an aphid in the landing phase was o-28H. Costa & Lewis (1968) have shown a linear relationship between horizontal trap size and catch, but a correction was not appropriate here since the catch on horizontal traps was in any case less than expected. The trial on the height from which aphids were attracted to horizontal traps showed that most species caught at ground level were originally flying in a zone mainly above I m. This experiment does, however, suggest that the missing component on the capped cylindrical traps may have been due to aphids flying below I m and inhibited from actively landing by the presence of the black cap, which may have decreased the intensity of the colour of these traps. The seasonal changes of the height at which species fly, as in the response to colour, may have been due to the alternation between summer and autumn migrants. The remarkably specific date at which the change occurred may have been related to the appearance of sexuales. The first Rhopalosiphum maIes were usually caught during the same week in which the change of height of flight occurred, but their numbers did not reach 30 74 of the population at either height until 3 or 4 wk later. Although female A. fabae gp. and R. padi changed both their response to colour with time of year and the height of flight, Capitophorus hippophaes and R. oxyacanthae did not show the colour response, and the two factors are consequently separate. The change of height of flight may be related to migratory flights to winter hosts involving long distance migration. Phorodon humuli is unlikely to breed at Aberystwyth and catches are presumed to result from long-distance flight from Herefordshire, whilst the results with the water traps for Rhopalosiphum spp. suggest migratory flights originating in the vicinity of the traps. All the species in group 3 are normally holocyclic with alternation of primary and secondary hosts, though this is equally true of some species in group 2 (e.g. Cavaviella, Metopolophium and Hyperomyzus lactucae), and a high proportion of R. padi over-winter on Gramineae in the Aberystwyth area.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "D I S C U S S I O N"}, {"text": "The apparent relationship of change in height of flight and attraction to light is also difficult to interpret. Taylor & Palmer (1972) have suggested that light-trap catches are partly caused by the light source stimulating night flights of newly mature aphids which normally accumulate overnight and are inhibited from flight by inadequate light. This may have been responsible for the catches of species breeding in the vicinity of the trap on grasses, but does not explain the periodicity in these species nor their occurrence in the autumn only. The tree-feeding species caught throughout the season were breeding more than IOO m from the trap and the intensity of illumination received would not have stimulated flight. It is of interest that one of the tree-feeding species caught most frequently to light, Drepanosiphum platanoidis, is known to fly at a low level at night (Heine, quoted by Taylor & Palmer, 1972) ) whereas throughout the season this species (and the other tree-feeding species of group I ) flies at a greater height than the grass-feeding or polyphagous species. These results suggest that some aphid species which are attracted to light (Frost & Pepper, 1957) are being caught when settling at night from altitude, which explains why the 'group 3 ' species are only attracted to light in autumn, a period when, it is suggested, long-distance migration into and out of the area occurs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 898, "end": 920, "text": "Taylor & Palmer, 1972)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1163, "end": 1185, "text": "(Frost & Pepper, 1957)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "D I S C U S S I O N"}, {"text": "The results underline the difficulties of interpreting aphid catches when using coloured attractant traps, a subject recently reviewed by Taylor & Palmer (1972) .

Apart from the difficulty of separating the attracted and impacted components of the catch on cylindrical traps, the results show that with some species the attractiveness of a given colour varies with trap type, month and form of the aphid. Attractant traps would therefore appear to be of most value when used for comparative purposes between adjacent crop treatments. Taylor & Palmer (1972) have suggested the use of British Standard 0.001 yellow (colour 6 in the experiments) as standard on coloured traps. These results confirm the highest overall catch of yellowsensitive species, but it should be remembered that this type of trap underestimates yellow-sensitive species, e.g. Cavariella aegopodii. Suction traps, being free of any element of attraction, are assumed to give unbiased estimates of aphid populations, but the results show that some species change their height of flight during the year, so leading to inaccurate assessments of populations when based on single traps at set heights.
