Advances have been made in our understanding of influenza viruses and their interplay with the host, but we still do not know the specific features that render a virus capable of initiating a pandemic.

            "text": "Some records and serology studies suggest that H2N2 and H3N8 subtype viruses caused influenza pandemics in the 1800s. The first confirmed influenza pandemic dates to 1918, when an H1N1 subtype virus, most likely originating from an avian species [1] , was introduced into the human population. The 1918 pandemic claimed up to 100 million lives, reduced the life expectancy in the United States by 10 years, and may have affected the course of World War I. Descendants of this virus circulated in humans until 1957, when they were replaced by a reassortant virus of the H2N2 subtype with hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1) (a polymerase subunit) viral RNA (vRNA) segments originating from an avian influenza virus [2, 3] . The death toll of this \"Asian\" pandemic exceeded 1 million. In 1968, the \"Hong Kong\" pandemic was caused by an influenza virus of the H3N2 subtype possessing HA and PB1 vRNA segments of avian influenza virus origin [2, 3] ; the estimated death toll of 33 800 in the United States may have been lower than that of other pandemics owing to some protection conferred by existing antibodies to the N2 NA. The H3N2 viruses replaced the H2N2 viruses and continue to circulate to this day. In 1977, H1N1 viruses similar to those circulating in humans in the 1950s reemerged; hence, primarily young persons were infected. The H1N1 and H3N2 viruses circulated until 2009, when the H1N1 viruses were replaced by a novel H1N1 virus, which caused the 2009 pandemic. This was surprising because pandemics were thought to be caused by a virus subtype not circulating in humans at the time of the pandemic outbreak. However, the HA of the 2009 pandemic virus, which has vRNAs originating from human, avian, and swine influenza viruses, and may have been transmitted to humans from pigs [4] [5] [6] [7] , was antigenically distinct from the H1N1 viruses circulating in humans, hence causing a pandemic. Since 2009, the newly emerged H1N1 viruses have cocirculated in humans with the previously circulating H3N2 viruses.",

Influenza viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes have infected hundreds of persons with high case fatality rates, but these infections have not resulted in sustained human-to-human transmission of viruses. Viruses of the H9 subtype are enzootic in poultry in several parts of the world, but only a few cases of human infection have been reported, although serology studies suggest that the numbers of mild or subclinical human infections may be higher. Clearly, we need a better understanding of influenza virus transmission among humans, which is most likely the sum of several factors, including the genetic composition of the virus, receptor-binding specificity, replicative ability, and antigenic relatedness to circulating viruses ( Figure 1 ).",

Humans do not have antibodies to H5 viruses, so human-transmissible H5 viruses could cause a pandemic. However, current H5 viruses do not transmit efficiently among mammals. Nonetheless, several mutant or reassortant H5 viruses derived from sequential virus passages in ferrets have been shown to be transmitted among ferrets and guinea pigs via respiratory droplets [11] [12] [13] [14] . These viruses bound to \"human-type\" receptors, replicated efficiently in mammalian cells, and some of them had additional mutations in HA that restored the protein's \"stability\" that had been diminished on conversion of the receptor specificity. These properties are discussed below in more detail. However, we currently do not know if the ferret-transmissible H5 viruses would cause a pandemic in humans (see Influenza Virus Transmissibility Among Mammals).",

Influenza viruses bind to sialic acids on glycoproteins and glycolipids on the surface of host cells. A major barrier to interspecies transmission of influenza viruses is the difference in receptor-binding specificity between human and avian influenza viruses. Avian influenza viruses preferentially bind to sialic acids linked to the penultimate galactose residue by an \u03b12,3-linkage, the major sialyloligosaccharides on epithelial cells in the intestinal tract of ducks, whereas human influenza viruses interact primarily with oligosaccharides with \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid, the major sialyloligosaccharides on epithelial cells of the upper human respiratory tract [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Pigs are susceptible to both human and avian influenza viruses; their epithelial cells express \u03b12,3-and \u03b12,6-linked sialic acids. The HA proteins of early isolates of the pandemic 1918, 1957, and 1968 viruses preferentially bound to \u03b12,6-linked sialic acids Predicting the next pandemic?",

Overall, a surprisingly small number of H5, H7, and H9 viruses have been tested for contact and/or respiratory droplet transmissibility in animal models.

Transmission studies in animal models are conducted with influenza virus-naive animals, whereas humans experience multiple exposures to influenza viruses during their lifetime through infection and/or vaccination. Prior exposure to influenza viruses of different subtypes may elicit low levels of cross-protective antibodies to other subtypes, such as antibodies to conserved epitopes in the HA stem region, which probably affect the outcome of future infections with influenza viruses.

            "text": "Surveillance and experimental data, together with data on numbers of human infections, existing population immunity, and the prevalence of a virus of interest in nature can also be assessed through the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/national-strategy/risk-assessment.htm) or the Tool for Influenza Pandemic Risk Assessment (developed by the WHO; http://www.who. int/influenza/publications/TIPRA_manual_v1/en/) ( Figure  1 ). Both tools rank influenza viruses by their pandemic potential and by the potential impact of such an event on human societies and public health. An Influenza Risk Assessment Tool assessment of several high-and low-pathogenic influenza viruses of different subtypes assigned the highest pandemic potential and impact to the H7N9 viruses that emerged in 2013. Experimental testing and computational risk assessment are important to determine the pandemic potential of circulating viruses, which may help decision makers to allocate potentially limited countermeasures (eg, antivirals). However, experimental virus characterization and risk assessment take several months and will lag behind an acute pandemic outbreak.",

We, therefore, propose focusing on (1) comprehensive mutagenesis studies to identify mutations that confer binding to humantype receptors or efficient replication in mammalian cells; (2) cataloging the sialyloligosaccharides to which influenza viruses bind efficiently; (3) extensive transmission studies in naive and infected or vaccinated animals; (4) developing novel animal models for influenza virus transmission studies; (5) expanding influenza virus surveillance in poultry and pigs, and in certain geographic areas, such as Africa and South America; (6) studying environmental factors that may facilitate the emergence of pandemic strains; and (7) developing robust computational tools for the mining of information exchanged in online social networks. Some of these data might also aid in the development of influenza vaccines that elicit protection against antigenically diverse influenza viruses. For example, the impact of antibodies to conserved regions in HA on future infections is still incompletely understood. Such knowledge might suggest additional strategies for the development of universal influenza vaccines. ",
