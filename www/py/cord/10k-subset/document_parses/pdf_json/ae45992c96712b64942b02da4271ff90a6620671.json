            "text": "Cell-free protein synthesis is a useful method for preparing proteins for functional or structural analyses. However, batch-to-batch variability with regard to protein synthesis activity remains a problem for large-scale production of cell extract in the laboratory. To address this issue, we have developed a novel procedure for large-scale preparation of bacterial cell extract with high protein synthesis activity. The developed procedure comprises cell cultivation using a fermentor, harvesting and washing of cells by tangential flow filtration, cell disruption with high-pressure homogenizer and continuous diafiltration. By optimizing and combining these methods, $100 ml of the cell extract was prepared from 150 g of Escherichia coli cells. The protein synthesis activities, defined as the yield of protein per unit of absorbance at 260 nm of the cell extract, were shown to be reproducible, and the average activity of several batches was twice that obtained using a previously reported method. In addition, combinatorial use of the high-pressure homogenizer and diafiltration increased the scalability, indicating that the cell concentration at disruption varies from 0.04 to 1 g/ml. Furthermore, addition of Gam protein and examinations of the N-terminal sequence rendered the extract prepared here useful for rapid screening with linear DNA templates.",

Sophisticated protocols of bacterial cell-free protein synthesis system have been established as coupled transcription-translation systems with exogenous DNA (7, 8) . Due to advanced developments, such as a continuous-flow system that provides reaction solutions with essential substrates and energy sources (9) and the PURE (protein synthesis using recombinant elements) system that is reconstituted by purified ribosomes and well-known translation-related factors (10, 11) , the cellular machinery of protein synthesis can now be prepared and reconstituted from various organisms in the laboratory or obtained from commercial suppliers (3, 12) .",

The PURE system is employed as ribosome-display systems for in vitro evolution of enzyme and for in vitro selection of drugs (17, 1923) . Cell-free protein synthesis systems have also been used in structural genomics studies. For example, through the structural genomics project 'Protein 3000' that was conducted from 2003 to 2007, many proteins were synthesized by using an Escherichia coli (E. coli)based cell-free system, resulting in >1000 protein structures, as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, being deposited in the Protein Data Bank by RIKEN (Japan) (2428). Cell-free protein synthesis systems have also been used as a powerful means of preparing samples for X-ray crystallographic studies (2934). Furthermore, E. coli-based cell-free systems have been successfully used for industrial production of single-chain Fv antibody fragment and cytokines (35, 36) . These industrial applications were achieved by using what is known as the 'Cytomim' (or 'mimicking of the cytoplasmic environment') approach (37, 38) . This approach started from the use of genetically modified E. coli strains to modulate amino acid consumption in the cell-free protein synthesis system (39) . Then, it was extended to solve the problems associated with energetic metabolism: for example, regeneration of ATP by the intrinsic activity of oxidative phosphorylation in addition to phosphorylation of nucleotide diphosphates can supply enough amount of ATP and GTP required for the cell-free protein synthesis (40, 41) . These approaches using genetic information and quantification of metabolites could provide clues for simulation studies to investigate the growth rate and replication accuracy of cells, which could lead to elucidation of homeostatic mechanisms (4246).",

Proteins that are difficult to produce using in vivo systems require multiple examinations of cell-free reaction conditions and thus consume a large amount of the cell extract: $1,500 ml per year in our group. Therefore, in the present study, we focused on the establishment of a reproducible process for producing bacterial cell extracts with high productivity on a large scale in the laboratory. First, we attempted to use tangential flow filtration (TFF) to harvest and wash cells on a laboratory scale. TFF is used for viral vaccine production and rapid concentration of bacterial culture or marine waters (41, 47, 48) . However, only the concentrated cell viability has been examined and no enzymatic activity of the cell extract has been tested; hence, this served as a starting point for designing a new procedure. After an examination of the cell disruption methods, we also applied the TFF technique during dialysis of the cell extract. Thereafter, TFF was utilized to prepare bacterial extracts for cell-free protein synthesis, which contributed to the reproducibility and the scalability of the process.",

Therefore, we first determined the optimal cultivation conditions using a fermentor to obtain comparable yield with a 2-l flask cultivation. In the early log phase of cultivation at 30 C, the growth curve of 2-l flask cultivation by using a shaker at 160 rpm was similar to that obtained by using a fermentor (aeration, 20 l/min; agitation, 220 rpm) ( Fig.  1A and B) . However, after the middle log phase, the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the fermentor rapidly decreased, probably because of the rapid increase in the number of E. coli cells, which would reduce growth in the late-middle log phase and make it difficult to harvest cells at the same condition every time. To address this issue, we lowered the cultivation temperature to 25 C to prolong the growth condition until the late log phase. Although cultivation at lower temperatures slowed the growth rate, the culture condition in the late-log phase became reproducible (Fig.  1C ). In practice, harvesting according to the OD 600 exceeding 2.5 yielded almost the same weight of cells in repeated cultivations (Table I ). The 2.5 OD 600 is usable as an indicator for the mid-late log phase. The pH of the culture medium was comparable between the two temperatures examined.",

Because tangential flow filtration (TFF) is a well-established technique for the rapid concentration of bacterial culture or marine waters (48), we attempted to use it to harvest and wash cells for preparing cell extract with high efficiency of protein synthesis on a laboratory scale. The TFF system comprises a pump, pressure valves and a filtration membrane (Fig. 2A) . The required operation time is estimated by considering the flow rate of the permeate through a given area of membrane per unit time (flux), commonly expressed by using the unit l/m 2 /h (LMH). Flux depends on transmembrane pressure (TMP), which is the difference between the pressures on the upstream (applied pressure) and the downstream (permeate) surfaces of the membrane. It is calculated using the equation TMP = [P feed (P1) + P retentate (P2)]/ 2 \u00c0 P permeate (P3). In the TFF system, the tangential flow of the circulating cell solution on the surface of the filtration membrane should be large enough, so that the permeate passes continuously through the membrane without clogging it. Circulating flow rate is controlled by the pump output, affected by the module architecture and pressure resistance of intended targets, and indicated as the difference between pressure P feed (P1) and P retentate (P2). It is represented as delta-P. The system is configured by modulating TMP and delta-P, the values of which should be determined experimentally within the range where flux increases linearly with respect to TMP. Once the effect of TMP on the flux of the membrane is characterized, the system can be easily scaled up by increasing the filtration area.",

Based on the results, we measured the flux by setting delta-P at 0.1 MPa and altering TMP in the range of 00.13 MPa (Fig. 2B ). As shown in Fig. 2B , the slope of flux against TMP decreased after TMP exceeded 0.09 MPa. Then we concluded that the Hydrosart \u00d5 Cassette (pore size, 0.2 mm) should be used by setting TMP at 50.09 MPa. During these examinations, we also measured the pH and conductivity of the permeate to estimate the required amounts of cell washing buffer. To ensure that the TFF system is comparable to the traditional method in terms of the yield of cells and the required time, a 20-l culture whose OD 600 was $3.0 was divided into two 10-l cultures, which were processed by the traditional repeated centrifugation and TFF methods, respectively. The repeated centrifugation method required about 4 h. On the other hand, TFF system required about 110 min by using ProFlux M12 (Merck Millipore) equipped with Sartocon Slice Hydrosart \u00d5 Cassette (filtration area, 0.1 m 2 ). The conductivities of the supernatants obtained after the final centrifugation were 6.58 and B A Fig. 2 Schematic representation of the tangential flow filtration (TFF) system used in the present study. (A) The system was manually controlled by using the pump output and adjustable valves 2 and 3 (V2 and V3) with modulating transmembrane pressure (TMP). TMP is the difference between the pressure upstream (applied pressure) and downstream (permeate) of the membrane, and is calculated using the equation TMP = [P feed (P1) + P retentate (P2)]/2 \u00c0 P permeate (P3). The three pressure indicators are labeled as P1, P2 and P3. (B) Characteri zation of the membrane. The permeate flow (flux) of E. coli cell culture (OD 600 , $3.0) was measured by setting delta-P (P1 \u00c0 P2) at 0.1 MPa and altering TMP in the range of 00.13 MPa. 7.25 mS/cm by the repeated centrifugation and TFF methods, respectively. The yield of cells by each method was $53 g. In practice, we used Sartocon Hydrosart \u00d5 Cassette (filtration area, 0.6 m 2 ), set the pump output at 70\u00c075% (P 1 = 0.14 MPa), opened valve 2 fully, and adjusted valve 3 to maintain the permeate pressure (P 3 ) to a value higher than or equal to 0.05 MPa. The resultant TMP was 0.03 MPa and the total process time was $60 min (Table II) . Although this TMP setting was lower than that of the preliminary experiment, the flux satisfied the estimated harvesting time. A lower permeate pressure (P 3 ) would briefly increase the flux but would also result in a higher TMP and quicker clogging of the membrane.",

The S30 extract content of $6 OD 260 unit in 30 ml of reaction solution had almost maximal efficiency. In this case, S30 extract prepared in the concentration of 667 OD 260 /ml was added at 30% volume of the reaction solution and the final concentration of S30 extract was 200 OD 260 / ml.

Therefore, we compared the activities of S30 extracts prepared with and without pre-incubation buffer.

However, we were unable to efficiently synthesize GST-GFPS2 fusion protein by using our cell-free system (MSP_tcc_cct in Fig. 6 ). The addition of 'N11-tag', whose sequence is similar to that of the poly-histidine affinity tag (HAT) (31, 62) , to the N-terminus exhibited 20-fold increase in the yield of GST-GFPS2 fusion protein (N11GST-GFPS2 in Fig. 6 ), suggesting that this problem could be overcome by altering the N-terminal sequence of GST. Therefore, the N-terminal three amino acids, MSP, were replaced with MKP, MSD and MKD to examine the productivities. The replacement of the second amino acid, serine, with lysine improved the efficiency either with AAA or AAG codon, and the third amino acid proline substitution for aspartate showed moderate and additional effects on the productivity (Fig. 6) . The sequence MKD encoded by ATG AAAGAT improved productivity the most significantly. These results are consistent with previous reports that translation efficiency in vivo and in vitro is affected by the second codon in an open reading frame (6365). Although an optimum reaction condition for synthesis of a target protein fused to GST would be a little different from those for GST-GFPS2, the replacement of the N-terminal amino acids with MKD is an enough improvement for detection of a target protein in the first screening with linear DNA templates.",

(A) Micro-dialysis reaction (30 ml) containing 120 ng of linear DNA template was performed with 1 ml of feed solution at 25 C with shaking at 240 rpm (IKA KS130 basic orbital shaker). Purified Gam protein was added at a concentration of 0 (diamonds), 1 (squares), 10 (triangles), or 20 ng/ml (circles). (B) The amount of linear DNA template remaining in the reaction solution was determined by means of quantitative PCR. The linear template of GFPS2 was generated by means of PCR by using the universal U2 primer (52). The first measurement was recorded at 5 min. Each result represents the average of at least three independent experiments. reactions or in expression systems using E. coli strain KRX. This S30 extract can be used for antibody fragment production such as scFv and Fab under oxidative condition (66) and the yield is $1 mg/ml in a preliminary preparation (data not shown). We also examined the ribosome content of the S30 extract by measuring A 260 . If nucleotides and oligonucleotides are not removed completely from the S30 extract during the diafiltration step, the protein synthesis activity, defined as protein yield (mg) per A 260 , would be significantly reduced. Using TFF in this step makes presents the A 260 of the permeate as a direct indicator of the nucleotide concentration that can be used to ensure adequate removal of low molecular weight chemicals and batch-to-batch consistency with regard to the protein synthesis efficiency. S30 extract prepared with our new procedure exhibited $2-fold higher activity per cell weight compared with those of Multi-beads Shocker, probably because the high-pressure homogenizer disrupted cells more effectively than did Multi-beads Shocker (Table IV) . The average activity of six preparations was 9.9 mg/A 260 , which corresponded to 3.1 mg/g of cells.",

Although they appear to be useful, for example, for screening of E. coli strain suitable for cell-free protein synthesis, it is uncertain whether they could be applied for repeated large-scale productions. As being the other approaches, inorganic pyrophosphate, a metabolite of ATP regeneration by creatine phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate, that inhibits protein synthesis, could be utilized as a phosphate donor to regenerate ATP by addition of maltose as a carbon source (68, 69) . It improved the cell-free protein synthesis efficiency in a batch mode reaction significantly. The other group has reported that a decrease of the concentration of magnesium ion leads to 16S rRNA degradation in a cell-free protein synthesis system using E. coli A19 strain (70) , which may be related to the accumulation of pyrophosphate (71). Therefore, not only improvement of procedures for cell extract but also further analyses of the metabolic processes during in vitro protein synthesis reaction are needed. Furthermore, we intend to use the S30 extract prepared in this procedure as a basic condition and to expand applicable products by addition of purified enzymes useful for production efficiency and detergents for membrane proteins.",
