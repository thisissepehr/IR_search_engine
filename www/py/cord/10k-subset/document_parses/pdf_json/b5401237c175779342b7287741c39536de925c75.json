After 24 h exposure, 101 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in AgNP-treated cells, whereas 400 genes responded to Ag + . Despite the large differences in the numbers of DEGs, functional annotation and pathway analysis of the regulated genes revealed overall similarities between AgNPs and Ag + . In both cases, most of the functions and pathways impacted fell into two major categories, embryonic development and metabolism. Nevertheless, a number of canonical pathways related to cancer were found for Ag + but not for AgNPs. Conversely, it was noted that several members of the heat shock protein and the metallothionein families were upregulated by AgNPs but not Ag + , suggesting specific oxidative stress effect of AgNPs in ESCs. The effects of AgNPs on oxidative stress and downstream apoptosis were subsequently confirmed by flow cytometry analysis.",

The authors therefore speculated that the observed gene regulation was exerted by Ag + released from the AgNPs. On the other hand, other studies suggest that AgNP toxicity is related to Ag + and to the nanosize as well [23, 24] . Thus, AgNP cytotoxicity is a complex phenomenon and more research is needed to distinguish cellular effects triggered by the nanosized particle from those by Ag + released from the nanoparticles.",

The cells were seeded in 96-well cell culture grade flat bottom plates (Nunc) coated with 0.1% gelatin (EMD Millipore) at 100 \u00b5l/well (1.0 \u00d7 10 4 cells/ well) and allowed to adhere overnight at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . After 24 h, 100 \u00b5l medium containing 2\u00d7 final concentrations of AgNPs or Ag + (0.1-50 \u00b5g/ml) was added to the test wells. In control wells, the same volume of medium was added as a vehicle control. The treatment was maintained for 24 h. At the end of the exposure, 20 \u03bcl of CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay reagent was added to each well that contained 100 \u03bcl medium. After 3 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the resultant absorbance was recorded at 490 nm using a SpectraMax i3 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Each concentration was tested in sextuplicate and repeated six times. To correct for interference of AgNPs or Ag + on MTS assay, a parallel control plate was set up with identical concentrations of AgNPs or Ag + but without seeded cells. The control plate was treated otherwise the same way as the test plate. The readings of the control plate were then subtracted from the corresponding wells of the test plate, and the resultant values were used in the doseresponse plot.",

The hydrodynamic diameter increased substantially in the medium (78.6 nm) (Fig. 1c) , probably due to slight agglomeration. Two small peaks appeared in the low diameter range on the DLS plot, probably resulted from protein species found in the media. The AgNPs had a low PDI (0.048) in water but much higher (0.349) in medium, indicating good stability in water but not in the culture medium. UV-Vis analysis in media ( Fig. 1d ) revealed colloidal homogeneity at the beginning (0 h) as reflected in the surface plasmon resonance with a characteristic peak ~400 nm. However, the peak intensity decreased rapidly within the first 2 h and then slowly between 2 and 8 h, with the peak broadened and shifted towards higher wavelengths, suggesting agglomeration of the particles in the medium. After 8 h, no further decrease in peak intensity was observed, although the peak position further shifted from 408 nm (8 h) to 424 nm (24 h).",

During the following 24 h exposure period, the cells on the surface outgrew and formed a loose outer shell of 2-3 cells thick around the compact \"core\". In control samples and those of lower concentration exposure, the outer shell was intact with a smooth contour. However, when AgNPs exceeded 5.0 \u00b5g/ ml, cells on the outer shell started to fall off. At 10 \u00b5g/ml and above, almost all cells on the outer shell fell off, whereas the core of the EBs was largely intact. In the case of Ag + exposure, cells stared to fall off the shell at 2.0 \u00b5g/ml. At 10 \u00b5g/ml and above, not only the outer shell completely disappeared, but the size of the core also decreased significantly. The use of 5.0 \u03bcg/ml as the exposure concentration for AgNPs in the following microarray experiments was based on the cytotoxicity data described above. At this concentration, ~10% cell death (EC10) was observed for AgNPs in the EBs, as measured by MTS assay (Fig. 2b) . Two concentrations of Ag + were used for comparison: 1.0 and 5.0 \u03bcg/ml.

For the remainder of this report, treatment with 5.0 \u00b5g/ml Ag + will be simply referred to as treatment with Ag + . Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) clustered the rest of the triplicates into respective treatment groups (Fig. 3c ). In addition, the HCA indicated that the gene expression pattern of the samples treated with AgNPs was more related to that of the controls than to that of the Ag + -treated samples. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was considerably lower in cells exposed to AgNPs than in cells exposed to Ag + ( Table 2 ). Using a fold change (FC) cutoff value of |FC| \u2265 1.5 and p < 0.05, 101 DEGs were identified in AgNP-treated cells (Additional file 3: Table S1 ), and 400 DEGs in Ag + -treated cells (Additional file 4: Table S2 ). Among these genes, only 17 and 133 had |FC| \u2265 2.0 for AgNP-and Ag + -treated cells respectively, indicating that in both cases the majority of the DEGs had a |FC| between 1.5 and 2.0. For both AgNP-and Ag + -treated cells, the number of upregulated genes was smaller than that of downregulated genes. However, when directly comparing AgNP-treated cells to Ag + -treated cells, the number of upregulated genes was higher than that of downregulated genes. There were 173 DEGs identified between AgNPtreated and Ag + -treated cells (Additional file 5: Table S3 ).",

Therefore, ESC differentiation in EBs has been considered to faithfully recapitulate stages of early embryo development and is increasingly used as an in vitro model for developmental toxicity testing [13] . In addition, implementing toxicogenomics in ESC differentiation has been shown as a sensitive method for the detection of a variety of developmental toxicants [18] . In the present study, we characterized transcriptomic changes induced by citrate-coated 20 nm AgNPs during spontaneous differentiation of mESCs, and compared to those induced by Ag + (silver acetate) under otherwise identical conditions. Despite the large differences in the numbers of DEGs, functional annotation and pathway analysis of the regulated genes revealed overall similarities between AgNPs and Ag + . Functions and pathways related to embryonic development and metabolism appeared on top of the lists for both treatments. Functional changes related to metabolism are thought to be necessary for cells to cope with the toxic insult of AgNPs and Ag + [37] . Those related to embryonic development suggest that both AgNPs and Ag + have the potential to cause developmental toxicities when in contact with the differentiating embryo. It has been reported that AgNPs induce distinct developmental defects in zebrafish embryos [38] .

Since the application of AgNPs is expected to further increase in the future, long term exposure and potential accumulation of AgNPs in the human body may result.

This is because complex interactions exists between a particle and its surrounding microenvironment, including attractive or repulsive forces between particles, and between particles and biological substances in the dispersion medium such as salts (ions) and proteins. These factors affect both the hydrodynamic size and the surface charge of the nanoparticles, and can impact on their agglomeration status, which may in turn affect the extent of toxicity. It has been considered that larger agglomerates of nanoparticles are less toxic than monodispersed particles or smaller aggregates [41] . The DLS and UV-Vis data suggest there was a dynamic interplay between the AgNPs and the culture medium, starting immediately upon contact and lasting throughout the duration of the exposure, leading to increased agglomeration of the AgNPs. Aggregation of nanoparticles in cell culture media has been reported previously by others [19, 37, 40] . However, it has to be noted that there are significant limitations to the techniques used for the characterization, which complicates the interpretation of the data. For both DLS and UV-Vis, characteristic peaks for AgNPs overlaps with those of the medium. Moreover, it is well known that DLS is a weight-averaged measurement biased towards larger particle sizes and especially towards agglomerates or aggregates. Thus, although the observed DLS curve showed an average hydrodynamic size of ~78 nm, the system may actually contain a very high number of smaller particles that are bioavailable and can interact with the ESCs. From another point of view, it should be pointed out that the agglomeration of AgNPs found here does not diminish, but rather adds to, the significance of the current study. Since the culture medium for ESCs used here was similar to body fluid in composition, it is likely that AgNPs entering the human body would agglomerate to some extent. In this sense, the results found in the current study are meaningful for real life situations. Since unagglomerated (monodispersed) form of nanoparticles would be more toxic than their agglomerated form, the results reported here signify the importance of nanoparticle regulation in consumer products.",

            "text": "It was interesting to note that in the EB state ESCs were in general more resistant to AgNP and Ag + cytotoxicity than in adherent culture (Fig. 2) . At 5.0 \u03bcg/ml, Ag + caused nearly complete cell death (97%) in adherent culture, while >80% cells survived in EBs. For AgNPs, cell viability at 5.0 \u03bcg/ml was 68% in adherent culture and 87% in EB state. At 50 \u00b5g/ml, 73 and 34% cells remained alive after exposure to AgNPs and Ag + respectively in EB culture. In comparison, in adherent culture only 43% cells survived AgNP exposure, and <2% cells survived after exposing to Ag + . These results could be explained by the fact that in adherent culture, cells formed a monolayer whereby AgNPs or Ag + diffused freely throughout the medium, and thereby reached equilibrium where all cells were equally exposed to the same concentrations of AgNPs or Ag + . In contrast, in 3D aggregates of EBs, a concentration gradient of exogenous or endogenous factors is established between the surrounding culture environment and the interior of the spheroids [35] . Therefore, concentration of Ag + in the interior of the EBs would be lower than that of exterior environment. The concentration is inversely related to EB size, with decreasing concentration from the surface toward the center of aggregates [35] . Due to the high cell packing density (Additional file 2: Figure S2 ), cells in the center of the EBs may be completely shielded and not exposed to Ag + at all. For AgNPs, the concentration in the interior of the EBs would be ever lower than Ag + due to more severe steric hindrance imposed on the AgNPs as a result of their larger sizes, especially if agglomeration occurred.",

            "text": "It was also intriguing to note that in adherent cultures, low concentrations of Ag + (up to 0.5 \u03bcg/ml) increased cell viability almost 20% relative to the unexposed control, suggesting accelerated mESC proliferation and/or differentiation Values are expressed as percentage of the control and are mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. *p < 0.05 (Fig. 2a) . Similar stimulating effects were also observed for AgNPs, albeit not statistically significant (Fig. 2a) . Such an hormesis effect was also reported previously for AgNPs in HepG2 cells [24] , and for silica nanoparticles in D3 mESCs [40] , and could be explained as an adaptive response of cells to low levels of potentially toxic agents [40] . The toxicity of AgNPs has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo [43] . However, whether the observed toxicity is due to Ag + released from the AgNPs or related to the special properties of nanosized particles is not entirely clear, and is often a topic of rigorous debate. This is partly due to the fact that the release of Ag + from AgNPs is a dynamic process and is affected by many factors such as temperature, surface chemistry, and stabilizing agent [44] . In order to unravel the mechanism of toxicity, the effect of AgNPs on the gene expression in ESCs was studied here at a relatively low toxicity concentration (~EC10) to avoid cellular processes in necrotic or apoptotic cells overwhelming and leading to misinterpretation of the data. As comparison, two concentrations of Ag + were used, one approximates the maximum Ag + released from 5.0 \u03bcg/ ml AgNPs after 24 h incubation in the medium (1.0 \u03bcg/ ml; Additional file 1: Figure S1 ), the other was the equivalent mass concentration of silver in 5.0 \u03bcg/ml AgNPs (i.e., 5.0 \u03bcg/ml). At 1.0 \u03bcg/ml, Ag + only induced 47 DEGs (data not shown), compared to 101 DEGs regulated by 5.0 \u03bcg/ ml AgNPs. This suggests that AgNP toxicity was not entirely due to Ag + released from the AgNPs. In the present study, we only measured Ag + release from AgNPs in the medium (without cells). AgNPs may also release Ag + inside the cell via a \"Trojan-horse\" mechanism, where the particles enter cells and are then ionized within the cell [45] . The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of AgNPs and Ag + on the cellular transcriptome of ESCs, and therefore more systematic studies are needed in order to completely disentangle the effects of AgNPs from those of released Ag + . In addition, a cellular uptake study of the AgNPs may help to confirm that the transcriptomic changes seen here were indeed caused by ingested AgNPs.",

            "text": "More importantly, microarray data analysis showed that several stress response proteins, including members of the heat shock proteins (HSPs) and the metallothionein (MT) families, were upregulated by AgNPs but not Ag + . As the name suggests, HSPs are a group of proteins induced by heat shock, or hyperthermia. Their expression has also been found to increase when cells are exposed to an array of other stresses, including heavy metals and oxygen radicals [46] , where they play a role in maintaining the correct folding of proteins by preventing protein aggregation or facilitating selective degradation of misfolded or denatured proteins [47] . MTs are a family of cysteine-rich proteins with several isoforms [48] . MTs have the capacity to bind heavy metals, both physiological and xenobiotic, through the thiol group of their cysteine residues [49] . It has been suggested that MTs not only are involved in the regulation of physiological metals and protect cells from metal toxicity, but also provide protection against oxidative stress [50] . The cysteines of MTs have been shown to bind oxidant radicals like superoxide and hydroxyl radicals [51] , and MT expression has been implicated as a transient response to many forms of stress or injury [50] . Several previous studies [23, 24, 37, 52, 53] reported upregulation of HSPs and MTs in somatic cells following exposure to AgNPs. The upregulation of these proteins found in the current study suggests that AgNP exposure also induced cellular stresses and elicited cellular protective responses in ESCs. It was intriguing to note that the same concentration of Ag + did not induce such stress responses in the ESCs. The reason for this is not well understood but could be partly explained by the so-called Trojan horse theory. The plasma membrane functions to some degree as a natural barrier for metal ions, thereby protecting the cells from damage. However, nanoparticles circumvent this barrier when they are taken up by the cells via endocytic pathways, leading to the release of metal ions within the cells as a result of lysosome rupture, and subsequently generate free radicals within the cells [23] . Similar findings were reported previously [23, 24] .",

Cells with damaged DNA will accumulate in the G2/M phase allowing the cells extra time to repair of damaged DNA, causing arrest in cell cycle progression [23, 54] . Cells with massive or irreversible DNA damage will not be able to repair the DNA effectively and undergo apoptosis at a later stage [19, 53, 54] . The results presented here indicate that this scenario may also hold true for ESCs. Flow cytometry results (Fig. 8) indicated that both oxidative stress and apoptosis increased significantly after treatment with AgNPs. Based on these results, the molecular mechanisms of ESC cellular responses against AgNPs are therefore speculated as following ( Fig. 9) : AgNPs enter the cell via endocytosis, release Ag + within the cell after lysosome rupture, and subsequently generate ROS. The increased oxidative stress further leads to DNA damage, causing cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in order to repair the damaged DNA. Cells unable to repair the DNA damages will eventually undergo apoptosis.",

However, despite the effect of AgNPs on oxidative stress and apoptosis revealed at the protein level by flow cytometry, significant induction of genes associated with the cellular processes downstream of oxidative stress (DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis) was not observed at the mRNA level by the microarray study. This is probably because of the ephemeral nature of many gene expression changes. The correlation between mRNA and protein abundances in the cell has been reported to be notoriously poor [55] . One of the reasons for the poor correlation is that there is a temporal difference in cells responding to environment perturbations at the mRNA level and at the protein level [56] . There may have been detectable gene expression changes at the mRNA level; however, by the time when these changes are translated into the protein level, the altered mRNA expression of these genes may have already recovered to their normal level.",

On the contrary, three pathways were found in cells exposed to Ag + . The reason for this is not clear. However, it cannot be excluded that AgNPs would affect cancer pathways at higher concentrations than that used in the current study (5.0 \u00b5g/ml).",

Overall, cellular responses to AgNPs and Ag + in ESCs were substantially similar. In both cases, most of the functions and pathways impacted are related to embryonic development and metabolism, suggesting that both AgNPs and Ag + have the potential to alter, reversibly or irreversibly, developmental pathways. However, specific effects on oxidative stress and apoptosis were observed for AgNPs. Taken together, our results indicate that the widespread application of AgNPs and silver-containing products may be a health concern. Long term exposure of humans to these products could potentially result in accumulation in the body and subsequently induce acute or chronic toxicity. Once systemically available, AgNPs has the potential to reach the embryo thus causing developmental toxicity. However, since information on whether these particles are able to transfer from the mother to the fetus across the placenta is currently lacking, the results of the current study have to be interpreted with caution until in vivo data becomes available.",
