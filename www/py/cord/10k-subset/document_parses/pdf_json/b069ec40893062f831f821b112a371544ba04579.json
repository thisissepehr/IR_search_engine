Exams were excluded if performed by sonographers whose US training began prior to the implementation of our electronic tracking system. Sonographers included in this study underwent standardized education including didactics and hands-on instruction. Statistical analysis was performed using a generalized estimating equation model to predict performance based on exam experience while controlling for confounders to generate learning curves for nine exam types. A plateau point was calculated as the point at which the growth rate in a curve became sufficiently small (<0.001). A weighted average of plateau points for a given exam type was taken and Bonferroni adjusted confidence intervals calculated. Conclusion: Plateaus in the educational learning curve vary by exam, but on average occur around 100 exams. While learning plateaus do not define proficiency, they should be considered when structuring emergency US training requirements.",

Background: Dyspnea is a primary symptom of acute heart failure (AHF) and has been proposed as an outcome measure for AHF clinical trials. Traditionally, dyspnea severity (DS) is measured by asking the subject to rate the symptom on a Likert or visual analog scale (VAS) while sitting upright. This method is insensitive to mild but clinically important DS. To address this, a Provocative Dyspnea Assessment (PDA) scale was developed.

The primary outcome was global outcome as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score at one month post-injury. GOS was dichotomized into good and poor outcome: poor outcome was defined as death, vegetative state (VS), or severe disability (SD) and good outcome was moderate disability (MD) or good recovery (GR). SBDP150 levels are described with medians and interquartile range (IQR). Biomarker performance was assessed using area under the ROC Curve (AUC, 95%CI).",

Results: The four separated years (2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009 ) of national discharge data included 128,000 to 142,000 weighted annual discharges with bronchiolitis. Between 2000 and 2009, the incidence of bronchiolitis hospitalization decreased from 17.7 (95% CI, 16.

Pains, the Institute of Medicine outlined major systemic obstacles to emergency care including pediatric readiness, fragmentation of care, limited access to specialists, and overcrowding. Currently there are insufficient data detailing the specific needs and challenges in the management of acutely ill and injured children who require transfer to a higher level of care, especially in underserved rural communities.

Charts were abstracted to compare the proportion of visits receiving steroids 1 hour of ED arrival, timing of bronchodilators, and use of chest radiographs pre-and post-pathway implementation.",

After tabular stratification by device the rates associated with the other variables were as follows: Conclusion: The rate of hemolysis is markedly higher when blood is drawn through the angiocatheter than butterfly. Consistent with our hypothesis, no other features of the blood draw were associated with hemolysis in samples drawn by butterfly. However, when angiocatheters were used, the rate of hemolysis was higher for smaller gauge needles, tubes < half full, long tourniquet time, and difficult sticks. These data indicate that use of butterfly devices can markedly decrease hemolysis rates without the need to change any other characteristics of blood drawing. Background: Over the past 20 years, there has been a steady increase in ED patient volume and wait times.

Background: Older adults are at high risk for untreated and undertreated pain. A pharmacologic regimen to treat acute pain in older adults must combine clinically satisfactory analgesia with sufficient safety precautions, minimizing the incidence of potentially serious side effects. This is especially important for older adults because both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may be altered by age and comorbidity.",

Seven (2%) patients developed bleeding. One patient died within five days and 12 within 30 days. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of all CDRs were only moderate, with the PESI and sPESI being more sensitive (69% and 81%, respectively) and the Geneva Prediction Rule being more specific (83%). and mortality. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a pneumonia not present at the time of intubation that develops after 48 or more hours of mechanical ventilation and is considered preventable. In the ICU setting, relatively straightforward patient care interventions have been shown to reduce the incidence of VAP. Tools such as information packets, posters, and competency testing provided to ICU nurses and respiratory therapists significantly decreased the number of patients who acquired VAP. To date, none of these studies have focused on VAP prevention education in the ED.",

Background: Thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) is an uncommon, deadly disease with a high rate of misdiagnosis. Current diagnostic strategies involve advanced imaging studies with high costs and risks of procedural complications, contrast nephropathy, and radiation exposure. Of these advanced imaging studies, CT angiography (CTA) is performed a majority of the time. With two recent meta-analyses indicating a high sensitivity, incorporating D-dimer testing into a diagnostic approach for TAD seems to be a promising approach to reduce the need for advanced imaging.

Residents determined their levels of confidence in each of the domains (i.e. cardiovascular) using a ten-point scale anchored by ''least confident'' (1) and ''most confident'' (10). Then they estimated time spent learning about the same domains using the 11-point response scale that was anchored by ''none at all'' (0) and ''a great deal'' (10). Comparisons were made between residents' areas of confidence and time allocated to studying each domain. Correlations were made between a resident's confidence and educational time spent using within subject analysis.

Patients ! 18 with a non-traumatic neurologic emergency diagnosis after initially presenting to the ED and whose case was reviewed by the ED's Quality Assurance (QA) committee between January 2005 and June 2012 were included for analysis. Three EPs independently reviewed each case and determined the type of error that led to a misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis. Proportions and confidence intervals were calculated. Conclusion: In this study, KG was the most common cause of error followed by SBI and CE. The difference was not statistically significant. EM residency programs should consider more training on the presentation and evaluation of neurologic emergencies. EPs must be aware of the pitfalls of diagnostic short cuts and reflect on their decision making to avoid CE. Given that radiology misreads by residents was the major SBI, EDs should consider requiring attending radiology reads for certain imaging. Although this study is limited by a small sample size, it is important for EPs to understand the causes of missed or delayed diagnosis of neurologic emergencies. Objectives: The goal of this study is to assess the current status of BU training and identify successful aspects of BU education.

Background: The NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, a measure of stroke severity, is the strongest predictor of outcome after ischemic stroke (IS). After the NINDS trial, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) remains the only approved therapy for improving outcomes after IS. Using latent class analysis and data from our epidemiology of stoke study, which includes strokes of all severity, we recently determined that grouping strokes by clustering of dichotomized presence or absence of individual NIHSS symptoms could provide additional prognostic information beyond the total NIHSS score. Particularly, we found that two symptom profiles with identical median NIHSS scores had widely disparate outcomes.",

Friedman Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY Background: Opioids are the type of medication used most commonly to treat migraine in the ED, despite the fact that opioids are linked to ED recidivism. Alternate therapies are available, but no current medication enables the ultimate therapeutic goal for more than 50% of patients, that is, rapid and sustained headache freedom for 24 hours. Furthermore, all commonly used acute migraine therapeutics may cause serious adverse effects. We therefore decided to determine the efficacy of intravenous morphine, the prototypical opioid analgesic, which is considered far less euphorogenic than hydromorphone and meperidine, the opioids commonly used for acute migraine. Our hope was that this medication would provide good efficacy without causing return visits to the ED during the same week.

Patients were included if they were > 18 years of age, were intubated in the ED, and were found to have bilateral infiltrates on an imaging study, a PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio less than or equal to 300 mm Hg, and the absence of heart failure contributing to the respiratory symptoms. Using a kappa statistic we assessed interrater agreement. We then compared the tidal volume set by the ED physician to the recommended setting of 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight. Agreement with recommended settings was determined if the initial tidal volume was less than the 6mL/kg recommendation. Settings within 10 mL of the recommendation were also included.

ED-based clinically oriented LBP research is hampered by complexity of the available outcome instruments, which can be time-consuming and difficult to administer, both in the ED and during telephone follow-up.",

Further research examining the clinical effects of such NMJ preservation in long-term animal models is urgently needed. Methods: This was a two-part investigation. In part 1, we used the Dixon Up and Down method to determine an LD50 dose of oral verapamil which will cause death within 2 hours of administration. Part 2 was a randomized controlled investigation using 20 rats. Each rat was anesthetized, ventilated, and instrumented with continuous blood pressure and heart rate monitors. After instrumentation, each rat was given a single LD50 dose of verapamil via an orogastric tube. Five minutes after VER administration, the rats were randomized into two groups (n=10/group). They received either 20% IFE or an equivalent volume of normal saline as 6 ml/kg boluses every 2.5 minutes for three total boluses. Animals were observed for a total of 2 hours. The primary endpoint was survival. Secondary endpoints were mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). Data were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier time to event analysis and compared using the log rank test and ANOVA with post hoc testing. A pre-test sample size calculation determined that 10 animals per group were needed to detect a 50% difference in survival time. Objectives: To compare ILE and normal saline (NS) in a rat model of cocaine toxicity. The primary outcome was mortality, and secondary outcome was the effect on cocaine-induced mean arterial pressure (MAP) changes. We hypothesized that cocaine would decrease mortality and MAP changes compared to saline.",

The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, a reliable marker for sepsis severity, has been shown to predict sepsis outcomes in different models. However, this prognostic performance has been inconsistent, especially in emergency department (ED) populations. SOFA score requires only inotropic agents as a measure of cardiac dysfunction, which may not accurately prognosticate in the sepsis cohort. Thus, an additional marker for cardiac dysfunction may be needed. Recently, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level has been described as being elevated in patients with septic shock, comparable to those found in heart failure patients.",

Times to critical interventions (IVF, antibiotics) were also significantly increased as ED patient hours and inpatient boarding increased. These differences may represent changes in ED staffing, triage methods, or location of EGDT initiation. As crowding increases, EDs must create systems that optimize delivery of time-sensitive therapies to critically ill patients. Methods: Five domestic swine weighing 50-60 kg were anesthetized, intubated, and ventilated. Arterial and venous lines were placed via femoral cutdown, a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed into the pulmonary artery, and placements were confirmed by waveform. The abdomen was opened via midline incision, the cecum was identified, 2-3 vessels were ligated to create an ischemic insult, and the cecum was perforated with a 1 cm incision using electrocautery. The peritoneum was inoculated with 1 g/kg of fresh feces. Swine were observed until the onset of hypotension (MAP<60) and were then given a fluid bolus and pressor agents to keep MAP 50-60 mmHg. Animals were observed until SvO2 reached 50-60%, at which time they were resuscitated using a modified Rivers protocol. Vital signs were recorded every 10 minutes. Animals were euthanized at the end of the experiment. Conclusion: NH residents, age >65, immunosuppression, and neutropenia are not significant risk factors for developing resistant organism infections in cases of severe sepsis admitted from the ED. ESRD is a significant risk factor (4-fold increase) for resistant organism infection. Antimicrobial therapy for ESRD patients admitted from the ED with severe sepsis should include consideration for addressing resistant organisms.",

The clinicians marked the veins with different colored washable markers and counted them on the dorsum of the hand, ventral forearm, and in the antecubital fossa using the three approaches: S, S+P, and VVV. A trained research assistant photographed each site for independent counting after each marking and recorded demographics and BMI. Counts were validated using independent photographic analyses. Data were entered into SAS 9.2 and analyzed using paired t-tests. Background: The fear of needles, needle phobia (NP), is recognized as a subset of \"blood-injection-injury\" phobias and is associated with pain, fear, and vasovagal syncope during needle insertion. The prevalence of NP in the general population is estimated at 10-25%, however the prevalence of NP in the ED has never been reported. Furthermore, the incidence of NP in the subset of patients who undergo multiple needle-sticks (MNS) due to difficult venous access (DVA) may be higher, but this has not been studied.",

(2)To determine the efficacy of simple, home techniques to sterilize coliform-contaminated water. Conclusion: Coastal fresh water sources on LI are contaminated with fecal coliforms. In the absence of clean watery delivery, and means to boil water, utilization of household bleach is an effective method to sterilize water. This simple sterilization reduces the potential for an outbreak of infectious diarrhea and a public health emergency after a large scale disaster. Background: The storm and flood that closed multiple hospitals in the lower half of Manhattan predictably had a significant effect on our ED, which was the only hospital in the area still operating. Since the combined census of the closed EDs exceeded our yearly census (greater than 100,000), the possibility of massive shortages of supplies, space, beds and services was real.",

The intervention was a multimodal practice change including \"frontloading\" of trolley patients by senior staff in a dedicated area, increased observation medicine, further spaces through use of chairs, and better coordination with bed management.

Conclusion: In absolute terms, these practice changes markedly improved the productivity of the ED in producing 4-hour outcomes, but this was barely sufficient to overcome the effect of growth.

Arrival rates for patients with varying acuity were estimated for hour of the day and day of the week. Process times were estimated for patients with varying acuity given their disposition. The model was a steadystate simulation with a warm-up period of 30 days, a replication length of 365 days, and 300 replications. Conclusion: Introducing flexibility into bed assignment between high-and low-acuity patients provides substantial operational benefits for overall ED performance including lower wait times and more even bed utilization. In this situation, rigid separation of resources decreases operational effectiveness. Objectives: This study aims to investigate the relationship between CDU diagnoses and rates of inpatient admission following CDU observation. We hypothesize that specific diagnoses will have a greater risk of observation failure (OF).",

This may reflect the burden of ED crowding in higher volume sites, as well as better access to rapid out-patient specialized follow-up. Given the lack of validated risk stratification tools, ensuring appropriate disposition among high-risk patient populations even during crowded conditions seems paramount. Objectives: Our goal was to perform a needs analysis of uninsured patients who were admitted into our hospital through the ED. The purpose was to determine if they could be linked to primary care for non-urgent needs through a transition of care program involving social workers interfacing with case managers, or a monthly retainer payment system. We hypothesized that a main barrier to obtaining health insurance was cost. Thus, if presented with an affordable option, patients would be more willing to obtain health care coverage.",

Medications given in the ED and prescribed at discharge, including Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) schedule II narcotics, DEA controlled substances (III-V), and non-opioid analgesics were tabulated, focusing specifically on opioid analgesics commonly used and those with high abuse potential. To determine if acute painful conditions treated in EDs were becoming more frequent over time, we evaluated if the primary reason for visit was \"pain-related\" or \"non-pain-related\". Conclusion: We found a near doubling in the use of opioid analgesics in U.S. EDs in the past decade, coupled with a modest increase in pain-related complaints and non-opioid analgesic utilization. Oxycodone and hydrocodone, agents with high abuse potential, were also the most commonly prescribed opioids in ED patients. ED providers must continue to be vigilant in assessing and treating pain, while minimizing the potential for opioid-related abuse and injury. Methods: Data were prospectively collected for all OOU patients, including extremity cellulitis, fractures, and spine injuries awaiting brace placement. The outcome variable was admission to the hospital vs. discharge home with a secondary outcome of return within 30 days for the same problem. Independent variables included: age, sex, diagnoses, location of problem, antibiotics given, culture results, MRSA +/-, IV drug use history, mechanism of injury, radiology reads, abnormal neuro checks, uncontrolled pain, number of hours in OOU, presence of diabetes/ chronic disease and SIRS criteria (temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, and WBC count). We used bivariate analysis to determine independent variables associated with the outcome of hospital admission. Logistic regression modeling was used to account for confounding between variables. A priori power analysis for the primary outcome variable of hospital admission indicated that with 100 patients/group (admitted vs. discharged), assuming equal sized groups, there was an 80% power to detect a difference of 20% in an independent variable.",

Further inquiry is necessary to determine which aspects of these programs contribute to successful outcomes and whether more standardization would benefit training in SBME.

More than 700,000 people suffer their first strokes every year in the United States and up to 20% of them will end up dying within one year.

A competency-based curriculum has been in place since this time, and evaluation methods include direct observation, quality assurance review of submitted images, US scan log volumes, and OSCEs for FAST, aorta, cardiac, pelvic, and procedural US. Using existing evaluation data, two faculty assigned a milestone level (Level 1-5) and a milestone circle (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) for each resident, blinded to the other's rating. Data were analyzed using a 5x5 Conclusion: Inter-rater agreement of PC12 to assign EM Milestone Levels 1-5 using existing evaluation data is excellent. Inter-rater agreement for EM Milestone circle 1-9 is fair, although this did not affect which level was assigned. Existing evaluation data can be reliably used to assign Goal Directed Focused US EM milestone levels. Objectives: To determine which factors (self assessment, feedback, or both) are associated with the generation of LG that EM residents retain and implement after a standardized oral board examination.",

Analysis was performed and expressed in terms of the odds ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95% CI. Differences in resuscitation efforts were expressed in terms of the p value. A multivariate logistic regression model for survival to discharge was also implemented to identify strategies with significant impact. Conclusion: Women were 44% less likely to survive an OHCA than men. Some of the factors leading to the gender differences in survival (such as bystander CPR rate, and hence, potentially the rate of shockable rhythms) may be modifiable. Thus, future study is needed to identify effective ways to reduce barriers to survival in women. Background: ED analgesia delays may be reducible by administering pain medication via routes that are faster-acting than oral (PO) drugs but which do not require parenteral injection. One such administration route that has been used for \"rapid absorption\" is the buccal tablet.",

The subjects were consented and randomized to IV LDK (0.3 mg/kg) or IV MOR (0.1 mg/kg). Numerical rating scores (NRS), Richmond Agitation Sedation Scores (RASS), and vital signs were recorded at 5, 10, 20 min, then every 20 min until subjects requested a third dose, were discharged from the ED, or underwent procedural sedation, or 120 min had elapsed. Adverse events and repeat doses were assessed. Our primary outcome was the percentage decrease in NRS from baseline at 20 minutes. We chose a sample size of 18 subjects per group based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated group standard deviations of 2 and an alpha of 0.05. We used a repeated measures linear model with adjustments for treatment group, time, and the group by time interaction with an auto-regressive covariance structure.",

Conclusion: This is the first reported CT visualization of thoracic contents during compression of the pediatric chest. Our results indicate a proportionally greater decrease in internal thoracic depth than external depth for a given compression depth.

This is the first study to demonstrate a neurologically intact survival advantage of an intra-arrest medicinal intervention. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at an academic ED with a level I trauma center Sept-Nov, 2012 . A structured, anonymous survey was administered to alert, non-trauma ED patients ! 18 years. Research associates obtained demographic and socioeconomic data, and asked, \"If the chance that a CT scan will show a life-threatening injury is less than 25%, would you want your physician to order the CT?\" To ascertain \"Acceptable Risk\" this query was posed for a chance of showing a life-threatening injury at 10%, 5%, and 2%. Patients were then asked the same series of items, yet this time they considered the scenarios assuming they or their wife/significant other were pregnant. Chi-square testing and multivariable regression were used. Background: With the growing utilization of ultrasonography in emergency medicine combined with the concern over adequate pain management in the emergency department (ED), ultrasound guidance for peripheral nerve blockade in the ED is an area of increasing interest. There have been multiple reports supporting the use of ultrasound guidance in peripheral nerve blocks. However, in order to perform a peripheral nerve block, one must first be able to reliably identify the specific nerve prior to the procedure.",

Conclusion: Of 18 patients found to have GS in a cohort of 220 symptomatic first trimester patients, none were found to have an EP. Further investigation, including prospective evaluation with a more generalizable physician population, may show that that the finding of GS on POCUS may be helpful in excluding EP. The operating characteristics of the interventions in diagnosing UL were calculated: sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio of a positive (LR+) and negative test (LR-). We searched Pubmed and Embase databases separately using the medical subject headings \"H&P + kidney stone,\" \"UA + kidney stone\" and \"US + kidney stone.\" Studies were assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies. Data analysis was performed using Meta-DiSc with a random-effects model. Conclusion: Bedside echocardiography can be used as an adjunct assessment tool to guide resuscitation. However, the decision to terminate resuscitation in cardiac arrest patients should not be solely based on echocardiography findings.

Random effects meta-analysis showed that US guidance improved success when compared to traditional techniques (pooled OR 3.58 (1.79, 7.19) ). There was no significant heterogeneity between studies (p=0.151). The figure shows a forest plot showing the OR for success for each study as well as a summary. Nine articles were selected for secondary analysis. Secondary analysis of time to cannulation showed no significant decrease in the US-guided group with a weighted mean reduction for US-guided techniques of -1.91 (-5.95, 2.12) . There was significant heterogeneity between these groups. Number of punctures required for successful cannulation were less in the US-guided group (weighted mean reduction of -0.50 (-0.78,-0.23)) though there was significant heterogeneity between the groups.

These tweets, characterized by a lower lexical diversity score than other city-and Sandy-related tweets, were likely easier to understand, and often linked to further information and resources. Results: The HVAs demonstrated that at all CiH sites there is an extreme lack of resources, with most children living at poverty level. The HVAs revealed a severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health care, shelter, and education. In some centers this results not only from lack of resources but also access to services. In our observational and relative risk assessment at each facility, some keep children healthier with simple changes of practice. At each site we noted observed numerous physical hazards which could be easily mitigated with limited resources.",

A relatively large proportion of pneumonia cases diagnosed in the ED are managed in the outpatient setting. Therefore, quantification of ED visit rates provides complementary information to hospitalization rates for the assessment of pneumonia burden. Conclusion: There is a suggested level of protection from influenza infection in individuals with increased levels of influenza-specific antibodies; however, among influenza-infected individuals, higher antibody titers were associated with both the need for hospitalization and longer duration of symptoms among certain H1 antigen types. Influenza-specific antibody titers may serve as both a marker of infection and disease severity in patients presenting to the ED with acute respiratory symptoms. Conclusion: In our ED, younger patients are more likely to accept HIV testing. We identified a significant quality problem with multiple patients not being offered a test despite triage nurses reporting they declined an offer. There are no differences in the sexual orientation of the two groups, but patients with some high-risk behaviors are more likely to accept testing. However, risk perception does not always equate with behavior. Objectives: To determine which ED patients were more likely to decline kiosk-facilitated self-testing by exploring socio-demographic and behavioral factors.

Using our EMR we identified all visits including documentation of a pelvic exam (PE) or rectal examination (RE), chosen for their relatively clear sets of indications and because their performance requires a deliberate step. We performed explicit and implicit review eliminating records if the chief complaint or diagnoses were among those predetermined to include indications for the exam (abdominal pain, pelvic pain, etc.). For the remainder we reviewed the complete record for evidence supporting an indication. We evaluated inter-rater reliability of reviewers, and our coders reviewed whether questionable items affected the evaluation and management (E/M) code assigned. We report proportions with confidence intervals and the kappa statistic. Conclusion: Patients overwhelmingly indicated that note-taking improved the accuracy of physicians' notes, and that typing while patients were relating their history was not distracting. Patients were largely neutral on the subjects of computer versus handwritten notes and tablet versus standard computers. Among the nearly half of patients who did express an opinion, a majority preferred tablet computers rather than typing on standard keyboards. These findings will guide implementation of tablet computer-based documentation and the development of patient education. Methods: We implemented the NIHSS for mobile devices using the Sencha Touch development environment (Sencha Inc., Redwood City, CA). Physicians were permitted to use smartphones as well as department-provided tablet computers. We performed a before-after cohort study of ED resident charts. Charts were reviewed for presence/ absence of NIHSS and of specific items within the NIHSS using a standardized abstraction tool. Accounting for an adoption phase, all patients with stroke team activation during the study period were included. Because the study focus was resident documentation, we excluded patient visits in which there was no resident chart. The primary outcome was whether any element of the NIHSS was documented on the ED resident chart. Secondary outcome was the number of NIHSS items documented on the ED resident chart. Data were analyzed using Stata version 12.0. Proportions were compared using two-sample tests of proportions and means were compared using two-sample t-tests.",

Background: Recombinant activated protein C is protective in animal models of sepsis, stroke, and lung injury, but has a poor side effect profile and has been taken off the market. Thrombomodulin (TM) and the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) are endothelial membrane proteins, which partner to bind thrombin and activate protein C at sites of inflammation, ischemia, and thrombosis. Both proteins are lost from the endothelial surface in disease states. We have shown previously that targeted delivery of TM to PECAM-1 on the endothelial surface provides protection in mouse models of lung injury.",

These may be due to the structural enhancements built into the Geriatric ED, as geriatric patient satisfaction with nurses and doctors, and satisfaction among those <65 yo, did not significantly change during this period. Results: Innovative Rasch analysis was performed due to its superior psychometric properties. Questions were selected as a good fit based on having infit and outfit statistics greater than 0.4 and less than 1.6. The measure was broken down into five subcategories including physical disability, cognitive disability, stress, depression, and isolation. For each subcategory a screening question was selected which then triggers additional questions. Each category receives an integer score between one and five with one being the most disabled and five being the least disabled. A global health score was then created by combining the five subcategories. Each of the subcategories was analyzed using the same infit and outfit statistics which showed good agreement between the subcategories and the global score.",

Thirty clinicians were randomized to medication order entry using one of the three modes: chief complaint based (e.g. chest pain, headache), pharmacological category (e.g. adrenergic agents, antihistamine), and free text search. Nine simulated patient scenarios were developed to test the hypothesis. The main outcomes were time to task completion and provider cognitive load, as measured by the validated NASA-task load index. We compared time to task completion and provider cognitive load between modes of medication order entry using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Conclusion: CPOE using chief complaint based grouping is substantially more efficient and requires less cognitive effort than medication ordering using pharmacologic groupings or free text search. Chief complaint based medication grouping for CPOE in emergency medicine has potential to increase clinical efficiency and potentially limit increased length of stay associated with implementation of an electronic health record. Conclusion: Broader coverage for black adolescents was associated with higher outpatient and ED visit rates over time, while for white adolescents there were no significant changes over time. This led to a diminished disparity in the outpatient and divergent ED trends for black vs. white adolescents in the CHIP era. These findings suggest improved access to outpatient services for black adolescents with more broadly available coverage, but also an increasing demand for ED services in the same group.

Background: Laryngoscopy is a complex technical skill with a low success rate among novices. Video laryngoscopy (VL) has emerged as a critical tool in the \"difficult airway\" armamentarium of EM physicians with a resultant increase in the types of commercially available VL devices. Training residents in VL has become increasingly challenging for EM residency (EMR) programs secondary to the array of devices. Additionally, it is unclear how much VL training should be provided as it is unknown how prevalent VL devices are in the community. Since EM residents go on to work in diverse settings, many in community (non-EMR) EDs, it is preferable that they receive training on the airway modalities they will encounter in practice.",

A number of studies have demonstrated positive effects including reductions in medication errors, test turn-around times, and ED length of stay. One potential benefit of CPOE is a reduction in the time until orders are entered due to eliminating a clerical \"middle man\" and the potential for bedside order entry. On the other hand, there is concern that with the expanded use of order sets, CPOE may lead to an increase in resource utilization due to an increase in the number of diagnostic tests performed per patient.

One hypothesis is that there may be barriers to activating the 9-1-1 system that may then delay the arrival of emergency medical services (EMS) providers and the start of CPR.",

The central goals were to replicate and longitudinally validate the Brief Resident Wellness Profile (BRWP), an empirically validated tool for assessing residents' sense of professional satisfaction and mood, and to examine associations between psychological wellness and self-reported sleep quality over time. Results: Forty-seven residents provided at least one observation, for a total of 108 total observations across 6 months. To investigate the potential time-based associations between self-reports of sleep quality and wellness, we specified a series of multilevel models to characterize changes in these variables over the study period. No systematic changes were observed in either of these variables; thus, on average, the participants in this study did not report significant decreases in their psychological well-being or increases in sleep disturbance over the study period. We did, however, observe a significant lagged association between these variables. This association was specific from increased sleep disturbances to decreased wellness a month later (B = -0.70, SE = 0.34, t = -2.07, p = 0.04); we reversed the direction of the analyses to explore the lagged effect from resident well-being to sleep disturbances, and this effect was not significant (B = -0.01, SE = 0.02, t = -0.77, p = 0.44).",

The use of nasal cannula with bilateral nasopharyngeal airways resulted in markedly improved oxygen delivery compared to nasal cannula alone. Since the airway mannequin has no inherent airway obstruction, this superior efficacy provided by addition of the NPA is likely due to improved airflow dynamics through the upper airways. Future studies in apneic oxygenation should attempt to confirm this effect in human patients. Additionally, apneic oxygenation via high-flow nasal cannula should be considered in future clinical trials of compression-only CPR.

Information for all oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone purchased by hospitals, pharmacies, and practitioners in Florida was obtained from US DEA. Purchases were excluded if they were bought out of state. This information was compared to data obtained from Florida Agency for Health Care Administration for the years 2000-2010 for all prescription opiate related: ED visits, hospitalizations, and newborn withdrawal. Information on opiaterelated deaths was obtained from the state medical examiner. Data for ED visits prior to 2005 and opiate-related deaths prior to 2001 were excluded due to absence of available data. Using Pearson correlation, we analyzed the prescription trends of oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone and its relationship to the following endpoints for prescription opiates: newborn drug withdrawal, deaths, ED visits, and hospitalizations. Conclusion: Oxycodone and methadone prescriptions were significantly correlated with increases in newborn drug withdrawal. All three drugs were correlated with increases in prescription opiaterelated deaths and hospitalizations. Additionally, oxycodone was significantly associated with prescription opiate related ED visits. Background: The dramatic rise in prescription opioid overdose deaths in the last decade has been staggering. Studies show that physicians have a racial/ethnic bias against prescribing opioid analgesics to non-white patients and that pharmacies in predominantly non-white neighborhoods have inadequate supplies of opioids. These biases may be disadvantageous to non-Hispanic white patients, reflecting in higher rates of prescription opioid overdose death.",

Physicians blinded to subject selfassessment measured after-treatment severity using the validated Pediatric Asthma Severity Score (PASS) instrument (score 0-6). Primary outcome was the difference in PASS score between those with substantial self-assessed improvement and those with less or no improvement. Demographic variables were recorded. Analyses were performed to ensure that distribution assumptions were met; t-tests, chi-square, and correlation coefficients were used as appropriate.

Singer, and Henry C. Thode Jr Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY Background: Over the last decade there has been a significant increase in the number of cutaneous abscesses. While there is general agreement that abscesses should be treated with incision and drainage, it is unclear whether systemic antibiotics should be routinely prescribed. Objectives: To evaluate whether systemic antibiotics, when compared with a placebo, improve resolution rates in patients with simple abscesses after incision and drainage. Methods: Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis using RevMan5. Patients and settings: Children and adults with simple abscesses treated in outpatient clinics or emergency departments. Data sources: Cochrane Central, Medline, Embase, and bibliographies. Outcome measures: Percentage of patients with complete resolution of abscess without the need for recurrent incision and drainage, additional antibiotics, or hospital admission within 7-10 days of treatment. Results: We included four trials, consisting of 589 patients in total (428 adults and 161 children). Patients were randomized to one of three antibiotics (cephridine [27], cephalexin [82], or trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole [161]) or to placebo (285) with 34 lost to follow-up or having incomplete data. When given in addition to incision and drainage, systemic antibiotics did not significantly improve the percentage of patients with complete resolution of their abscesses 7-10 days after treatment (88.1% vs. 86.0%; odds ratio 1.17, 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.95).Conclusion: When given in addition to incision and drainage, systemic antibiotics do not significantly improve the percentage of patients with complete resolution of their abscesses.",

A variety of ages, training levels, and genders were represented. The residents, regardless of training program, age, or gender, shared the accommodating learning style. The attending analysis showed that attendings aged <40 shared the accommodating learning style and attendings aged >40 shared the diverging learning style. Accommodating learners excel at putting ideas into action, adapt well to changing circumstances, are intuitive, and use trial and error to obtain answers. Divergent learners are imaginative, consider many perspectives, and seek abundant information before making decisions.Conclusion: Historically, learning styles have been used as a framework for curriculum design and to influence educators but it has not been studied in EM. At the institution where this study was conducted, the majority of residents and faculty shared the accommodating learning style.

Non-contiguous spine fractures and delays of diagnosis are associated with a higher mortality rate.Background: In blunt trauma patients, chest CT (CCT) helps identify otherwise missed injuries. However, many injuries identified only by CTT require no additional intervention. The diagnostic value of CCT is questionable in the context of increasing concerns about radiation exposure and its potential cancer risk. Identifying clinical findings that predict which patients are unlikely to require surgical intervention based on CCT findings might limit the number of unnecessary CT scans.Objectives: Determine whether five readily available clinical findings can predict which patients will not require a surgical intervention due to CCT findings.Methods: Using the registry at our Level I trauma center, we conducted a retrospective chart review of blunt trauma patients admitted in 2009 who underwent CCTs during their initial evaluations.

Complication rates were similar to prior studies evaluating procedural sedations performed by ED physicians. We found that use of ETCO2 monitoring allowed early initiation of simple airway interventions prior to oxygen desaturation.Background: Pain is the most common chief complaint for patients seeking care in the emergency department (ED). Up to 70% of ED visits are related to pain as the reason for the ED visit. Opioids are commonly used to treat pain but have undesirable side effects: nausea, vomiting, hypotension, respiratory depression, and the potential for addiction. Ketorolac, an effective pain reliever, is nonaddicting and avoids the side effects of opioids. The oral route of drug administration may not be feasible in some patients (e.g. vomiting, ileus) while other routes of dispensing medications (IV or IM) can be painful. The intranasal (IN) route eliminates the pain of a needlestick. IN ketorolac has not been evaluated for the treatment of pain in a prospective trial in ED patients.Objectives: To determine if IN ketorolac is safe, effective, and welltolerated in treating ED patients with painful conditions. Conclusion: Intranasal ketorolac effectively decreases pain in adult patients in the ED for a wide variety of chief complaints and many different types of pain. Moreove, it is safe and well-tolerated .ED Pain Care and its Effects on Short Term Hospitalization OutcomesAmmar Siddiqui, and Ula Y. Hwang Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY Background: Hospitalized patients often arrive through the ED, where pain care may be initiated for their conditions. Unrelieved acute pain increases the risk of chronic pain and delirium. Little is known, however, whether ED pain care affects hospitalization outcomes. >4 point reduction in ED pain scores (initial -final pain score) was correlated with lower opioid dose on HD1 (-10.7, p=0.02) and lower number of HD1 analgesics (0.78, p=0.05).

When evaluating the NRS, we noted significant variation in scores by education level, race, and sex, but these differences were not present in VITA scores. Similarly, odds of receiving opioid medication varied significantly as a function of level of education with NRS scores Conclusion: As a preliminary study of a novel tool for the measurement of pain in the ED, our results suggest improved accuracy and ease of use of the VITA scale compared to the traditional NRS. Additional research may further illuminate the advantages of this approach to pain assessment, as well as the clinical significance of potential effects on the treatment of pain in the ED.Background: The recent NAP4 study reported a larger number of complications from the ICU than the ED and OR during emergency airway management. 61% of the reported complications suffered death or brain damage, illustrating the importance of optimizing airway management in the ICU setting. The optimal device for intubation in the ICU remains unknown.Conclusion: Video laryngoscopy is associated with a decreased the first attempt esophageal intubation rate and increased first attempt success rates compared to direct laryngoscopy.Objectives: 1. To better appreciate the proportion of all angioedema that is ACE-I induced. 2. To describe the medical management of AAE in two Canadian tertiary care EDs. 3.

Management of AAE commonly includes antihistamines and corticosteroids. Concerningly, epinephrine use is common. Many patients are started on an ACE-I for cardioprotection post-myocardial infarct. There is little physiologic rationale for epinephrine use in AAE and much risk. More work is necessary to better delineate epinephrine's role in this vulnerable patient population.",

Pairwise t-tests and column proportion z-tests were used for statistical comparisons.Conclusion: Pharmacologic management of AHF differs significantly by specialty. EP most frequently use NV and their rationale for use differs relative to HOSP and CARD. These differences suggest tailored educational and research efforts by specialty regarding AHF management with vasodilators may be needed.Letters refer to columns with values significantly lower than the value in the current column at p < 0.05.",

Our research shows that the door to ECG time for STEMI patients who walk into the ED can be decreased significantly without additional resources. It appears that process improvement activities focused on targeted points of care, such as how the initial ECG is obtained, may improve overall door to balloon time for STEMI patients.",

There was no difference in overall stress utilization based upon physician gender (p=0.28).

The three prospective studies compared VT termination between lidocaine versus procainamide, amjaline, and sotalol. The two retrospective trials tested lidocaine against procainamide, amjaline, sotalol, and amiodarone.Conclusion: For the treatment of stable, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, the antiarrhythmics procainamide, amjaline, and sotalol were all superior to lidocaine.Objectives: We sought to describe the utilization of our EDOU for young patients with chest pain and evaluate the utility of this approach for risk stratification in this patient population.Methods: This prospective, cohort study of severely hypertensive patients (SBP ! 180 or DBP ! 120 mm Hg at triage or on reassessment) was conducted in an academic ED over 3 months in 2012.

Nonetheless, shockable rhythms and application of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) remain a critical component of the chain of survival. To date, there is a paucity of research that evaluates sex disparities and AED application in OHCA. We hypothesized that female sex would be negatively associated with AED application following OHCA.Methods:We conducted a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES), which includes data from 29 cities in the United States. Patients were included if they were ! 18 years of age, had nontraumatic, non-EMS witnessed OHCA, and had a documented resuscitation attempt from October 1, 2005 through December 31, 2011. Bivariate differences were calculated and hierarchical multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to estimate associations between sex and AED application as the primary outcome.Conclusion: In a national sample of adult OHCA patients, female sex was negatively associated with AED application when adjusted for multiple confounders.

Ball, Alicia M. Kurtz, and Trent Reed Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL Background: The Joint Commission issued Sentinel Event Alert #45in June 2010 highlighting the significant problem of violence in the health care setting. Several studies have demonstrated that quality staff training programs improve attitudes, confidence, knowledge, and skills pertaining to violent person management (VPM). Separately, it has been shown that web-based video lectures are a useful tool for presenting information to medical students on clinical rotations. Combining this information, we examined the effect of a video podcast on medical student knowledge and comfort in dealing with VPM in the emergency department (ED).",

Pediatric residents infrequently perform this role and data on their performance is lacking.Objectives: To summarize primary and secondary survey performance in pediatric trauma resuscitation and determine association between provider characteristics and survey quality.Conclusion: Primary and secondary surveys are frequently performed incompletely regardless of level of training or type of training program. There is no difference in measured performance among different programs. The effect of trauma resuscitation education on improved survey performance should be studied prospectively.The millennial generation's interest in easily accessible education materials is forcing educators to reevaluate how they teach. EMRAP's Mel Herbert recently tweeted \"Traditional texts are dead.\" This sentiment appears to be pervasive amongst our youngest and most influential learners and educators.Objectives: To determine emergency medicine residents' current methods and preferences of obtaining medical knowledge.Conclusion: Medical education must reevaluate the way in which we teach residents and expect them to learn. Our survey confirms that the trend is moving away from traditional means such as books and journals and utilizing more open access interactive multimedia tools. Our role as medical educations must also shift to engage with our current learners, to guide appropriate use and to strengthen our own education methods.Background: Evaluation of medical student performance in an EM clerkship requires an assessment of clinical performance by faculty most often using an end-of-shift evaluation form.

Using structured medical record review, we identified ED or initial hospital treatment for sepsis, defined as a serious infection with ! 2 systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria). We identified all-cause mortality over an 8-year follow-up period after the sepsis event. Using Cox regression with sepsis defined as a time-varying covariate, we compared the relative risks of death between sepsis and non-sepsis individuals over time, adjusting for age, sex, race, education, income, geographic region, tobacco and alcohol use, and chronic medical conditions. Conclusion: While the risk of sepsis in-hospital mortality is well known, in this study high rates of death persisted for four years after sepsis hospitalization.

Optimal management includes early identification, resuscitation at the most proximal phase of critical illness, and timely administration of appropriate antimicrobials. Therapy has been complicated by the emergence of resistant organisms. Objectives: We hypothesized nursing home residents (NH) as well as elderly, immunocompromised, neutropenic, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients would have increased prevalence of resistant organisms and that presence of resistant organisms would be associated with increased hospital length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of severe sepsis patients admitted to an urban, level I trauma center from the emergency department (ED) between May 2008 and February 2010. Data abstraction was completed by a trained researcher using a standardized form. Severe sepsis was defined as the presence of ! 2 SIRS criteria; a confirmed or suspected source of infection; and the presence of ! 1 acute organ dysfunction. Cases of resistant organism infection were identified as positive culture revealing MRSA, VRE, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or ESBL klebsiella. Odds ratios were calculated for resistant infection, age (>65 years), NH resident, immunosuppression (chemotherapy or daily steroids), neutropenia, ESRD, and mortality. Student's t-test was used to analyze LOS. Results: 1,148 patients with severe sepsis were identified; 570 had culture-positive infection. Mean age was 58 years; 36% Caucasian; 44%African-American; in-hospital mortality was 11.6%. 26% had confirmed resistant organism infection. ESRD was found to be the most significant risk factor (OR 4.65), followed by immunosuppression (OR 1.43) and neutropenia (OR 1.45). Age >65, NH residence, mortality, and LOS were not correlated.",

In a subgroup analysis, urban hospitals had improved survival in patients who had Conclusion: Mortality from severe sepsis is lower in facilities with higher case volumes in both urban and rural locales. Systems factors such as prolonged transport times and decreased staffing in rural EDs and ICUs may play a significant role in the observed mortality difference between urban and rural facilities.

Objectives: The objective of this study is to investigate trends in TH utilization and hospital factors associated with utilization, in United States hospitals across 2007-2010. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of 117,419 adult hospitalizations with cardiac arrest (ICD-9 427.5 or 799.1) in the 2007-2010 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). TH was identified by ICD-9 code 780.65 or procedure code 99.81, and yearly utilization of TH as a proportion of all cardiac arrests was calculated. Extrapolation to nationwide yearly estimates of cardiac arrest and TH utilization was done using NIS weighting and differences evaluated with Wald test for linear hypothesis. Logistic regression of TH utilization adjusted for year, patient age and sex, and hospital factors (bed size, ownership, location, region, teaching status, and safety-net status). Results: National yearly estimates of in-hospital cardiac arrest remained stable across 2007-2010: 139,225 to 148,460 to 146,341 to 149,400 in 2010 (Wald test p=0.74). TH utilization in cardiac arrest increased: 0.32% to 0.70% to 1.71% to 2.35% in 2010 (Wald test p<0.01). The proportion of hospitals using TH increased: 4.5% to 9.0% to 18.3% to 22.7% in 2010. Factors with a significant association with TH use Conclusion: Overall utilization of TH relative to all cardiac arrests was very low (<3%), likely reflecting both low overall rates of ROSC in cardiac arrest and low rates of utilization of TH in cardiac arrest with ROSC. Despite a seven-fold increase in the use of TH since 2007, there continue to be significant geographic and hospital factors associated with variability in implementation. Future interventions to determine reasons for underutilization of TH and promote its use might best be focused on non-teaching, safety-net hospitals, in the midwest and south.

            "text": "Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects up to 6 million Americans with estimated national incremental health care costs of up to $26 billion. ED visits for AF nearly doubled between 1993 and 2004. A lack of evidence-based ED guidelines for treating AF and proponents for both rate and rhythm control treatments may contribute to regional differences in AF management and disposition strategies.Objectives: We hypothesized that ED visits for AF continue to rise and are associated with considerable regional variability in disposition strategies and use of cardioversion. To test this aim, we computed the counts of ED visits from 2006-2009 in patients with a primary diagnosis of AF and the percentage that were hospitalized and cardioverted, by United States (US) geographic regions.Methods: The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS)database is a 20% stratified sample of US hospital-based EDs and the largest source of US ED data. We performed a retrospective, cohort analysis of patients who had AF (using the ICD-9 code of 427.31) listed as their primary ED diagnosis in the 2006-2009 NEDS. We calculated the weighted numbers of ED visits, demographics, ED disposition and cardioversions stratified by four US regions: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. The percentage of AF patients hospitalized was higher in the Northeast and South than in the Midwest and was lowest in the West (seefigure). The percentage of AF patients who underwent ED cardioversion was highest in Midwest and lowest in the South (seefigure).Conclusion: Annual nationwide ED visits for AF continued to increase from 2006 to 2009, resulting in frequent hospitalizations. Over the 4 years of analysis the lowest percentage of AF ED patients were hospitalized in the West than other regions. The percentage of patients undergoing ED cardioversion continues to remain low with the fewest ED cardioversions performed in the South. Clear guidelines for managing AF in the ED may aid physicians and result in a more standardized AF treatment and disposition.",

Matthew Fields, Nicole E. Piela, Arthur Au, Courtney Townshend, Kaitlyn Dalsey, and Bon S. Ku Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA Background: Many patients have difficult venous access (DVA)requiring multiple attempts at IV placement, which may lead to delays in care. The true prevalence of DVA in the ED and its associated characteristics have not been previously described.Objectives: To determine the prevalence and associated factors of DVA in ED patients.Methods:We performed a prospective observational study of patients presenting to an urban academic teaching hospital with an annual census of 65,000. Patients were included if they had an IV placed. Data were collected by trained research associates who interviewed patients immediately after successful IV placement during periods of block enrollment from July through October 2012. Patients were excluded if complete data were not obtained or if they refused consent. The primary outcome was the presence of DVA, defined as three or more attempts for successful IV placement or if a back-up method of IV placement was performed (external jugular or ultrasound guidance). In addition to demographic data, the following medical conditions (which have previously been thought to be associated with DVA) were collected: obesity, diabetes, dialysis, sickle cell disease, upper extremity swelling, visit to ED or hospital in the past 90 days, history of chemotherapy, or IV drug abuse (IVDA). Univariate analysis was performed using chi-square or Fisher's exact test to determine factors associated with DVA. Significant variables were then tested in a multivariate logistical regression model.Results: 548 patients met inclusion criteria, of whom 23 were excluded due to incomplete data. The prevalence of DVA was 12.8% (95CI 9.9-15.6%). Demographics and patient characteristics for DVA vs. non-DVA patients are presented in the table and graphically in the figure. History of IVDA (OR 3.1, 95CI 1.3-7.8), sickle cell diease (OR 3.3, 95CI 1.1-9.9), and swelling of the upper extremities (OR 1.9, 95CI 1.2-5.2) were significant predictors of DVA in a logistic regression model.Conclusion: DVA affects nearly 13% of ED patients and is more common in patients with a history of IVDA, sickle cell disease, and swelling in the upper extremities.

The effects of a storm like this on prehospital advanced life support (ALS) calls and treatments in a suburban area like northern New Jersey are unknown.Objectives: We sought to quantify the change in weekly ALS volume after the storm and examine the percent of calls that were cancelled prior to ALS arrival, triaged to basic life support (BLS), and treated by ALS compared to baseline.Methods: Design: Retrospective cohort. Setting: A large, suburban, hospital-based EMS system that responds to approximately 26,000 calls per year. Protocol: Weekly ALS call volume was calculated for the four weeks before October 29 to establish baseline volume. Calls were reviewed to determine if ALS was cancelled prior to evaluating the patient, if the patient was triaged to BLS, or if the patient was treated by ALS. 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for baseline data. Weekly data for the two weeks after the hurricane were calculated and compared to baseline.Results: For the four weeks prior to Sandy, there were an average of 395 (CI: 376, 414) ALS calls per week. Of these, 44% (CI: 42, 46) were cancelled prior to ALS arrival and 12% (CI: 10, 14) were triaged to BLS. The percent of the total calls that were treated by ALS was 39% (CI: 37, 40) and the percent of non-cancelled calls that were transported was69%  (CI: 67, 71). Compared to before the storm, in the two weeks after the storm there was a statistically significant increase in weekly ALS calls received (Week 1: 473 calls, 20% above baseline, p<0.01; Week 2: 418 calls, 6% above baseline, p<0.05). There were no differences in age or sex. The percent of total patients treated each week was unchanged (Week 1: 37%, Week 2: 38%), and there were no significant changes in the percent of patients who were triaged to BLS (Week 1: 14%, Week 2: 14%).Conclusion: After a major destructive storm, the volume of ALS requests increases significantly. The number of calls in which a patient is treated by ALS providers increases proportionately. There appears to be no difference in acuity of the calls because there is no change in the percent of calls that are cancelled or triaged to BLS.Hurricane Sandy: The Effect of Multiple ED Closures on Patient Volume and Acuity Saadia Akhtar, Tom Nguyen, Paul Krieger, John Irwin, Gregg Husk, and Michael Heller Beth Israel Medical Center, New York, NY",

Objectives: To examine the effect of ECG transmission on DTB times and false-positive (FP) field activations in a large metropolitan area.Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of data from a single registry in a large metropolitan area with regionalized cardiac care and EMS providers with ECG transmission capabilities. Thirty-three designated STEMI receiving centers (SRC) contribute to this registry, from which patients with a prehospital ECG indicating a STEMI were identified between July 1 and December 31, 2011. DTB times and rate of FP activations (defined as not resulting in emergent PCI or referral for CABG) for patients with ECG transmission received by the SRC were compared to a reference group who did not have successful ECG transmission. The protocol for cath lab activation for prehospital STEMI varied by institution.Results: There were 1582 patients who presented with prehospital ECGs indicating STEMI. The ECGs were received by the SRC for 346 (22%) of these patients, whereas the ECGs were not received for 1234 patients (78%). Regardless of ECG transmission, the cath lab was activated 84% of the time, with 74% and 80% of activations initiated prior to ED arrival in the transmission group and reference group, respectively. The overall proportion of FP activation was 50%.In the reference group, the FP rate was significantly increased with prehospital activation compared to ED activation, 55% vs. 37% (risk difference = 18%, 95%CI 10 to 25%). However, when ECG transmission was completed, there was a similar FP rate for activations in the ED of 45% and this did not increase with prehospital activation at 43% (risk difference = -2%, 95%CI -16 to 11). ECG transmission significantly reduced the overall rate of FP activations, 44% vs. 52%, risk difference = 8%, 95%CI 2 to 14). The RR of FP activation when the ECG transmission was received versus not received was 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.96 (p=0.01). ECG transmission had no significant effect on DTB times with 96% of patients meeting the 90-minute goal. Conclusion: Prehospital ECG transmission is associated with a reduced rate of false-positive activations for STEMI. of a Medical Toxicology Telemedicine Consult Service to Assist Physicians Serving Overseas: 2005-2012 Joseph K. Maddry 1 , Vikhyat S. Bebarta 2 , Kennon J. Heard 1 , Daniel J. Sessions 1 , John G. McManus 3 , and Charles M. Lappan 4Background: Specialty care (such as medical toxicology) is not readily available to military and civilian physicians in overseas contingency operations. The US Army Medical Department designed an electronic mail telemedicine system in 2004 to provide consultations for remote health care providers. The service provides e-consultation 24 hours/day to assist government providers managing cases in austere environments.Objectives: To describe the types and the frequency of toxicology Methods: Consults were generated using the military electronic mail system routed to on-call military, medical toxicologists. A project manager monitored all teleconsultations to ensure Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance, and consultants' recommendations were transmitted within a 24-hour mandated time period. A single, unblinded data extractor reviewed all medical toxicology consultations from July 2005-July 2012 and recorded the frequency of each type of predefined consultation using a standardized collection form.Results: Ninety-eight e-consults were performed over 7 years. The majority of consultations came from physicians in Iraq (44%) and Afghanistan (36%). The average reply time was 4 hours (range 0.06 to 29.18 hours). Seventy-six consultations involved patient interactions and 22 were for general management protocols. The 76 patient consultations included 59 US military patients, 3 US contractors, 14 local nationals, and 7 pediatric. The most common consultation was for snake envenomation and antivenom recommendations (22%; 95% CI 15% to 32%) followed by accidental chemical exposures (14%; 95% CI 9% to 23%), drug testing (13%; 95% CI 8% to 21%), and substance abuse (10%; 95% CI 6% to 18%). Other consultations were for intentional overdoses, scorpion envenomations, occupational exposures, and withdrawal syndromes.Conclusion: Physicians providing care to patients in Iraq andAfghanistan should be trained in management of envenomations, chemical exposures, and drug abuse and testing. Teleconsultation can be used to assist in the management of patients when clinicians require specialist consultation. Development of a similar volunteer teleconsultation program could assist physicians serving in austere locations throughout the world.Background: The implementation of electronic patient care reports (ePCR) in EMS has many implications for EMS systems and providers.",

Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) is thought to create a lipid compartment in serum that sequesters lipophilic drugs. Dabigatran is lipophilic and its anticoagulant effects are concentrationdependent.Objectives: To determine if ILE therapy reverses dabigatran's anticoagulant effects.Methods: Twenty rats were randomized, 10 in the ILE group, and 10 in a normal saline (NS) control group. Animals had baseline tail bleeding times (T0) followed by oral dabigatran administration (15mg/ kg). At 45 minutes (T45), a second tail bleeding time was performed, followed by a 7 minute intravenous infusion of 15 ml/kg of ILE or NS. A final 60 minute (T60) bleeding time was obtained. An ILE-only group of five animals had bleeding times assessed prior to (T0) and 15 minutes after (T15) ILE therapy. Comparisons were made using t-tests.Results: Between T0 and T45, average bleeding times increased from 109.5 seconds [95% CI 94-125] to 231.8 seconds [95% CI 193-271] (p<0.0001). Between T45 and T60, bleeding times in the ILE group decreased by 31.5 seconds [95% CI -77 to +14] and by 6 seconds [95% CI -67 to +55] in the NS group; not statistically significant (p=0.46). In the five ILE-only animals, the average bleeding time at T0 was 114 seconds [95% CI 62-166] which increased significantly at T15 to 237 seconds [95% CI 161-313] (p=0.006). Conclusion: The anticoagulant effects of dabigatran are not reversed with ILE therapy. Although ILE itself significantly prolonged bleeding times, when administered to dabigatran-anticoagulated rats, bleeding times decreased, but not significantly. There may be a complex interaction of ILE with dabigatran that this study was not able to elucidate.

Researchers, using a standardized questionnaire, collected clinical and demographic data from patients, hospital staff, and medical records in real time. Follow-up data (at 48 hrs and 14 days post ED visit) were collected by phone from patients and family members, or by querying medical records and hospital staff. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine factors associated with mortality.Conclusion: In this initial study of ED presentations in Nepal, half of patients presented with either GI or general medical complaints, and injuries were comparatively infrequent. Additionally, relatively low mortality and admission rates suggest that the ED sees a wide spectrum of disease severity.Background: The World Health Organization's IntegratedManagement of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) guidelines recommend diagnosing pneumonia in children based on respiratory rate in resource-limited settings. While some studies have found respiratory rate to be a moderately good predictor of pneumonia, more recent studies have not found this to be the case.Objectives: To examine the accuracy of clinical factors for diagnosing pediatric pneumonia in a resource-limited setting. We hypothesize that clinical signs and symptoms, such as oxygen saturation, may be better predictors of pneumonia than respiratory rate alone.Methods:We conducted a retrospective chart review of children under five presenting with respiratory complaints to three rural hospitals in Rwanda who received chest radiographs. A data abstraction tool was created to assess for the presence or absence of historical, clinical, and laboratory signs that might be predictive of pneumonia. For each chart, the chest radiograph were reviewed by two separate pediatric radiologists for the presence of pneumonia. Overall correlation and individual test characteristics were calculated for each categorical variable studied against the gold standard of radiologistconfirmed pneumonia. For continuous variables, we created receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to determine their accuracy for predicting pneumonia.Results: Between May 2011 and April 2012, 147 children under five who received chest x-rays were admitted to our study hospitals with respiratory complaints. Based on our pediatric radiologists, about 58% of children had pneumonia, while 42% did not. Of the categorical variables studied, only history of asthma (chi-square=4.48, p=0.034) and a negative blood smear for malaria (chi-square=6.21, p=0.013) were statistically associated with pneumonia. Of the continuous variables studied, only oxygen saturation had an area under the ROC curve (AUC) statistically different from the reference line (i.e. better than chance), with an AUC of 0.675 (95% CI 0.581, 0.769 and p=0.001). Respiratory rate had an AUC of 0.528 (95% CI 0.428, 0.627 and p=0.588), not significantly different from the reference line.",

We analyzed the effects of a new concept of ED management on reduction of waiting times (WT) and length of stay (LOS).Objectives: To evaluate the effect of new management by Lean method with the implementation of Triage Team on waiting time and processing time of an emergency department (ED). To assess whether new ED flow management reduces numbers of patients waiting to be seen.Methods: Comparative observational study of ED indicators and parameters during the last 4 years (2007 to 2011) and after 11 months (December to November 2012) of new management in a French general hospital (40,000 visits/year). We analyzed data on waiting time (WT), length of stay (LOS) in the ED, and left without being seen (LWBS). We analyze the effect of triage nurse, physician triage, fast Track, patient flow, and admission rate of ED and Short Stay Unit.Results: After 3 months (March 2012), evidence of decreased LOS by 50 % (8 hours 33 mn to 3h36) was the main effect of the new ED management. The effect of team triage on LWBS was relatively strong. The effect of Fast Track on waiting time, length of stay, and LWBS was strong. Median times were significantly reduced (p<0.05) during the intervention to triage (10 min v 30 min, p = 0. 029), to see a doctor (10 min v 120 min, p<0.05). The admission rate was similar (35 % vs 34 %). The patient leaving without being seen decrease (9 % vs 0.05 %). The admission rate and the LOS of the Short Stay Unit was more efficient with a new management (100% and < 24 hour in 2012 vs 120% and 72 hour in 2011).Conclusion: Actions to reduce overcrowding need new strategies like Lean's method focus on flow orientation, reduction in unnecessary stay in the ED, participation of all co-workers. The main effect of new management with team triage with Fast Track appears to be a decreasing LOS by 50% in a crowded French ED. A new management in the conceptual model of ED by Lean method is beneficial for decreasing the waiting time and length of stay. Fast Track for patients with less severe symptoms results in shorter waiting time, shorter length of stay, and fewer patients leaving without being seen. We need further studies to evaluate the effect of the Lean method on other diagnostic procedures (e.g. laboratory tests and x-rays) on the waiting time and length of stay.The Effect of Suspected Diagnosis on Physician Pretest Probability for Abdominal Pain Patients Undergoing Computed Tomography in the Emergency Department Angela M.

Pretest probability was significantly lower for potentially life threatening diagnoses. The three conditions that received CT with the lowest pretest suspicion were the most potentially life threatening: mesenteric ischemia (36%, 95% CI 26-45%), AAA (37%, 95% CI 26-48%), and perforated viscus (38%, 95% CI 31-44%). By comparison, the three conditions that received CT with the higher pretest suspicion were less likely to be acutely life threatening;Conclusion: Potentially life-threatening diagnoses were more likely to receive abdominal CT at lower pretest probabilities of the condition.Background: Acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is a common presentation whose severity ranges from benign to lifethreatening and the best tool to risk-stratify the disease is an upper endoscopy (EGD), a procedure performed almost exclusively by gastroenterology physicians. Unfortunately, on-call GI specialists are frequently unavailable and the ED currently lacks a method to visualize suspected acute upper GI hemorrhage. Recent research has shown that video capsule endoscopy is well-tolerated by ED patients and has similar sensitivity and specificity to traditional endoscopy for upper GI hemorrhage.Objectives: Our goal is to determine if ED physicians with brief training in video capsule endoscopy can detect upper GI bleeding on videos.Methods: A survey study was designed to show four examples ofvideo capsule endoscopy to ED physicians. Each physician received training consisting of less than 10 minutes of background information and endoscopy examples in the form of a web-based slide presentation. Following training, the subjects were asked to interpret four videos of capsule endoscopy in patients with suspected upper GI hemorrhage for evidence of bleeding or no bleeding. All videos were generated from a prior ED-based study on patients with suspected acute upper GI hemorrhage. Setting: ED physicians were recruited at the American College of Emergency Physicians Scientific Assembly in Denver, Colorado in the exhibitor hall on 10/8/2012 to 10/10/2012. Response rate was estimated greater than 70%. Subjects: Inclusion criteria for study subjects included being an ED resident or attending physician, and exclusion criteria included formal endoscopy training such as a gastroenterology fellowship. Analysis: We analyzed the agreement between the ED physicians and expert-adjudicated readings for each capsule video.

A recent single-center study estimated the test characteristics of bedside ultrasonography (BUS) for the diagnosis of AC, as defined by gallstones plus sonographic Murphy's sign or pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder wall thickening, and resulted in a sensitivity and specificity of 87% (95% CI 66-97) and 82% (95% CI 74-88), respectively. It has been previously shown that BUS has excellent sensitivity for gallstones.Objectives: We hypothesized that the finding of gallstones alone on BUS would have excellent sensitivity and negative predictive value as a screening test for AC. The objective of the current study was to estimate the test characteristics of such a screening test as defined by the presence or absence of gallstones alone, with the purpose of reliably excluding AC in ambulatory patients.Methods:We conducted a secondary data analysis of a prospective observational study conducted at an urban academic ED that estimated the test characteristics of BUS for the diagnosis for AC. A convenience sample of adults was enrolled between May 2006 and February 2008. Presence or absence of gallstones on BUS was compared to surgical histo-pathological reports as the gold standard. All ultrasounds were performed by the treating physicians: attending, fellow, or resident.Results: During the study period, 193 patients were enrolled; 23 were lost to follow up, 2 did not receive US, 2 had US performed by medical students, and 2 had unavailable pathology reports; 164 patients were included in the final analysis. The overall prevalence of AC was 14% (23 pathology-confirmed cases). Using our narrow screening criteria, BUS for AC had sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 85.Conclusion: These results support the approach that the absence of gallstones allows emergency physicians to exclude the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Approximately half of patients (i.e. those with no gallstones) could be reliably excluded from additional studies, thereby allowing for the selective use of scarce resources to patients who are at higher risk of disease.",

Future studies exploring the reasons for such wide variation in admission rates is warranted.Background: A sickle cell crisis results in vascular obstruction, leading to local hypoxemia, pain, and sometimes infection. Identifying a bacterial infection early is critical but confirmation through blood cultures may take days.Objectives: This study evaluated whether lactate levels measured in the ED would be associated with having positive blood cultures in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease.Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care pediatric emergency department with 53,000 visits per year. Consecutive children aged 0-21 years old with SS disease presenting with fever, 100.4F or greater, were eligible for inclusion. Participants were excluded if lactate levels or blood cultures were not performed. Blood cultures and lactate levels are part of routine standing orders in our ED. Data were collected from patients who visited the ED from 9/2009 to 11/2011. The primary outcome measure was positive blood cultures (+BC). Additional variables assessed included reticulocyte count, WBC count, pulse, temperature, age, and lactate levels. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated.Results: There were 224 visits (179 children) that had both lactate levels and blood culture data available and were used for the analysis. The mean temperature (T) in those with +BC was 102.5 (101.8- 103.1)  and in those with -BC was 100.8 (100.5-101.4) (p<0.001). The mean lactate levels in those with +BC was 2.8(2.1-3.6) and in those with -BC was 1.9 (95%CI 1.8-2.1) (p=0.009). The area under the ROC curve for lactate predicting positive blood cultures was 0.68 (95%CI 0.54-0.82). A cut-off of 0.9 for lactate would provide a sensitivity= 100%, specificity= 9%, PPV= 10%, and NPV= 100% for predicting +BC.Conclusion: Lactate was significantly associated with having +BC.This suggests that lactate may help identify bacterial infection early in these patients. A much larger multicenter prospective study would help elucidate these findings Background: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) often present to the ED for treatment during vaso-occlusive crises and have reported experiencing negative attitudes from providers.Objectives: We sought to validate a survey that measures attitudes towards SCD patients in a sample of ED providers, and compare differences in attitude scores between provider types.",

Research shows that patients with limited health literacy have more ED visits and fewer doctor office visits than those with higher literacy, but it is unclear if this represents barriers to ambulatory care, patient preference, or need for emergency care.Methods: Observational, cross-sectional study of adults ! 18 years of age presenting to an academic ED from June-August, 2012. The visually and hearing impaired and medically unstable were excluded. Using systematic sampling, patients were approached based on time, day, and mode of arrival of the general ED population. After informed consent, a structured interview assessed literacy (Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine), access to care (Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems surveys), and reasons for ED use (Emergency Medicine Patients' Access to Healthcare tool). Literacy group differences were assessed using chi-square test and JMP9 statistical software.Conclusion: Patients with limited literacy report access to care with their personal doctor as soon as it is needed yet perceive better care in the ED. Patients with limited literacy may also perceive greater need for emergency care but are no more likely to be hospitalized than those with higher literacy. Efforts to divert patients from emergency care may be unsuccessful if patient literacy, attitudes, and preferences are not considered.",

Our center and others have reported considerable success in linkage, but such reports may be inflated due to crude outcome definitions and limited analysis. Anecdotally, an initial \"intake visit\" with an infectious diseases center (IDC) does not necessarily denote a full initial evaluation and completed treatment decisions.Objectives: We comprehensively assess linkage from our ED HIV testing program by describing patterns of health care utilization for the year following a positive HIV test result obtained in the ED.Methods: This retrospective cohort study included confirmed HIV positive patients newly diagnosed between 2002 and 2010 in an urban, academic ED in a region of lower HIV prevalence. Linkage procedures included in-person and telephone follow-up, attempts at repeat contact for missed appointments, and accompanying patients to initial appointments. Records from the study-site health system, including the ED, hospital, IDC, and outpatient clinics, were reviewed for the year subsequent to each patient's diagnosis. Primary outcomes were the frequency of IDC linkage and time to IDC linkage. Secondary outcomes included the number and type of non-IDC health care encounters.Conclusion: Actual linkage success for patients diagnosed by EDHIV testing is likely to be modestly less than traditionally reported. This has important implications for public health and the effect of ED HIV screening. Repeat encounters with the health care system after diagnosis represent opportunities for linkage intervention, particularly in EDs.",

Unfortunately, these guidelines have not been universally adopted due to concerns about increasing length of stay and perceived operational difficulties.Methods: This case-control study was performed at an urban Level I trauma center. All adult patients who had STD testing in the ED were offered rapid bedside point-of-care HIV testing. Patients were matched based on age and sex. A retrospective chart review was conducted of ED patients undergoing STD testing comparing LOS of those who consented to an HIV test to those who did not. Other variables such as ancillary testing, pregnancy status, and test results were collected. A Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test were used to compare ED LOS for the two groups.",

The majority (>75%) either strongly or moderately approved each domain of the white paper (table). Strongly approve was highest for the domains of discharge communication processes and large print instructions, presence of geriatric social worker and pharmacist, nurse and physician geriatric education, and pressure-redistribution mattresses. Respondents displayed less enthusiasm for readily available geriatric specialty ED consultations, physical therapy evaluations, prehospital provider education, quarterly geriatric QI reports to hospital leadership or geriatric QI reports in general, or infrastructural modifications to lighting, colors, or signage.Conclusion: A sample of EM physicians with interest in care of geriatric patients endorsed the domains that define the minimal attributes of a geriatric ED put forward by this multidisciplinary collaboration. Future research is needed to assess the perspectives of community physicians, hospital administrators, and policy makers as the white paper is further refined.Performance of an Emergency Care Telemedicine Program for Older Adults Manish N. Shah, Erin B. Wasserman, Suzanne M. Gillespie, Dallas L. Nelson, Nancy Wood, Matt Doyle, Shirley Li, and Kenneth M. McConnochie University of Rochester, Rochester, NY Background: Accessing timely emergency care is a challenge for older adults residing in senior living communities (SLCs), resulting in potentially avoidable ED visits. We implemented a program that offered emergency care via telemedicine to evaluate complaints triaged to need attention before the next available outpatient visit but not to require ED resources. This option provided patients access to care in their residences. Objectives: To describe the telemedicine program characteristics and to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of telemedicine to care for older adult SLC residents with emergency care needs. Methods: Telemedicine was made available to patients of a primary care geriatrics practice who resided in seven SLCs between November 2010 and October 2012. For each requested visit, a telemedicine technician travelled to the patient's home and obtained an illness history, exam elements (e.g., lung sounds), and samples for laboratory testing. Data were then uploaded into an electronic medical record. Emergency or geriatric medicine providers reviewed the information and made diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the program using measures including telemedicine visit characteristics, satisfaction surveys of patients and informal caregivers, and surveys of the triage team about alternative care options had telemedicine been unavailable. Results: 280/298 (94.0%) requested telemedicine visits were successfully completed. Common diagnoses included respiratory (21.4%), cardiovascular (16.4%), skin (12.1%), and musculoskeletal (8.2%). 95.7% of patients received telemedicine care without requiring subsequent referral to an ED or urgent care. 93.7% of patients reported being satisfied or very satisfied with telemedicine care. Had telemedicine been unavailable, patients would have been sent to an ED (48.1%) or urgent care clinic (27.0%), or provided a later outpatient visit (24.4%). Patients' informal caregivers estimated they saved a median of 3.5 (IQR 2.5-6) hours by using telemedicine rather than an ED. Conclusion: Emergency care via telemedicine is feasible, is acceptable to older adults residing in SLCs and their caregivers, and can provide definitive care in a timely and convenient fashion without transport to an ED.

Rapid Universal Opt-out HIV Screening in Adolescents and Adults of All Ages in an Urban Level I Trauma Center Emergency Department James T. Scribner, Jeri Rose, Benjamin Blake, Aaron Blue, Mandy Burton, and Julie Gorchynski John Peter Smith Health Network, Fort Worth, TX Background: In 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines recommended rapid routine opt-out HIV screening in emergency departments for patients age 13-64. In 2009, we began a program that extended that guideline to all patients age 12 and older. To date, no ED testing program has published data specific to patients above 65 and under age 18. Objectives: To determine the feasibility and yield of rapid universal opt-out HIV screening among all patients 12 and older in an ED serving an urban population. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all ED patients from April 1, 2009 through January 1, 2012 in this observational cross-sectional study. All individuals aged 12 and older who visited the ED in our Level I trauma center received the Centaur HIV 1/O/2 Assay, if blood was drawn for any clinical purpose. If no blood was drawn, they were offered the OraQuick rapid HIV test. Western blot (WB) was used to confirm reactive results. Ambiguous or negative WBs were further evaluated with nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Patients were excluded only if they had a test in the last 6 months or were under 12. Basic demographic information was analyzed by using standard descriptive statistics including frequencies and cross tabulation. Results: From April 1, 2009 through January 1, 2012, 33.7% of all ED visitors (n=65,731) accepted testing. Overall, 0.74% (n=489) of ED visitors screened positive. Of these, 164 were lost to follow-up. Confirmatory testing yielded 275 positive by WB, 36 negative, and 14 indeterminate. NAAT testing yielded 3 additional true positives from the indeterminate WBs. Overall, 0.42% of visitors were given new confirmed diagnoses of HIV. African American (RR= 1.95) and male (RR=1.61) were the most likely groups to receive a new diagnosis.Conclusion: Universal screening of all ages yields a small number of additional new HIV diagnoses (n=5), but is above the CDC recommended level of 0.1% seroprevalence.",

Sama North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, NY Background: Severe sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, resulting from a microbial infection and associating with high mortality rate, especially in elderly patients. We previously demonstrated that a pro-inflammatory nuclear protein, HMGB1, is released from innate immune cells, such as macrophages, and mediates sepsis lethality. Objectives: In light of the increasing prevalence of lipoprotein imbalances in the aging population and involvement of lipoproteins in inflammatory diseases, we investigated the effects of high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) on the release and cytokine activity of HMGB1 in vitro. Methods: Murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS, 500 ng/ml), recombinant HMGB1 (2.0 lg/ml) in the absence or presence of HDL (10-200 lg/ml), or LDL (10-200 lg/ml) for 16 hours. The levels of HMGB1 and other cytokines/chemokines in the culture medium were determined by Western blotting or cytokine antibody arrays. Results: Both HDL and LDL dose-dependently attenuated LPSinduced HMGB1 release, with a >95% suppression by lipoproteins at concentrations as low as 50 lg/ml. Similarly, both HDL and LDL effectively inhibited HMGB1-induced release of IL-6 and several chemokines (e.g., MCP-1, RANTES, and CXCL16), indicating that the common component of these lipoprotein complexes (i.e. phospholipids) PC), a major phospholipid in both HDL and LDL, dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced HMGB1 release, with a complete abrogation at concentrations as low as 50 \u00b5g/ml. Conclusion: PC is partly responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of lipoproteins in vitro, which may confer protection by partly attenuating HMGB1 release and cytokine activities.

            "text": "Complaints of Patients TestingPositive in a Universal HIV Screening Program Kurt Weber, Philip Giordano, Michael Sanders, and Sandra Sawyer orlando regional medical center, Orlando, FL Background: Current CDC recommendations call for universal HIV screening in emergency departments where seroprevelance is >0.1%. However, recent studies suggest targeted HIV screening outperforms nontargeted strategies and should be employed given the limited resources available to health care systems. Chief complaints could be one piece of a targeted strategy if a positive diagnosis is found in a limited set of complaints.Objectives: Our objective is to describe the scope of chief complaints of ED patients testing positive for HIV and determine their utility for a targeted HIV screening program.Methods: Our study is a retrospective cohort design set in an urban, tertiary care emergency department that has offered free universal HIV screening through a state-funded grant since May 2008. The study population consists of patients identified through a computerized database who tested positive over the duration of the grant. Data including chief complaint, age, and sex were abstracted by chart review by two investigators. Two separate investigators blinded to HIV test result determined whether a chief complaint could be associated with an HIV diagnosis. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study population.Results: A total of 5086 tests were performed with 176 testing positive, for an overall prevalence of 3.4%. The age range of positives was 18-68 with a mean age of 46. Males accounted for 126 cases (39%).Forty-two distinct chief complaints were identified. The most common were cough (19), dyspnea (17), abscess (10), abdominal pain(9), and fatigue(8). Overall 12 (28%) separate chief complaints in 35 (20%) patients were considered to be unrelated to HIV infection.Conclusion: Patients who ultimately test positive for HIV in a universal screening setting present with a wide variety of chief complaints. As many as 20% of these patients have chief complaints unlikely to be related to HIV infection. Our data suggest a targeted HIV screening process that incorporates chief complaint would potentially miss a critical number of asymptomatic HIV infections. St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center, New York, NY; 2 Jacobi Medical Center, Bronx, NY; 3 New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute, New York, NY. Background: In 2010, NY State passed legislation mandating that all emergency departments (EDs) offer HIV testing to persons 13-64 presenting for care. This positions NY as the only state with a law requiring ED HIV testing. Objectives: To evaluate statewide implementation of this ED testing requirement and determine if differences exist based on HIV prevalence or site-specific designated AIDS centers (DACs). To evaluate policies for linkage to care in positive patients. Methods: An electronic survey was administered to all NY ED directors excluding VA hospitals. Investigators developed survey questions related to all provisions of the legislation and linkage to care. Face validity was tested by ED and HIV physicians. Basic descriptive statistics were used for analysis. Results: The response rate was 96% (183/191). All respondents were aware of the testing law. Of the 180 respondents who answered the question about testing, 86% reported offering HIV testing in their EDs. All EDs not currently offering HIV testing reported plans to initiate it. EDs in high-prevalence areas and state DACs were more likely to offer HIV testing. Although the law eliminated the requirement for separate written consent for an HIV test, most facilities (107/159, 67%) still used this technique. Although allowed by the law, only 11% incorporated HIV testing language into the general treatment consent and 19% used verbal consent for rapid tests. The HIV testing offer was primarily performed by clinicians but also included clerical staff, public health advocates, social workers, and through written testing information. Most EDs used rapid testing (67%) including both oral point-of-care ED testing and rapid laboratory testing. Only 62% of EDs provided HIV test results to patients while still in the ED. Most EDs (90%) had a linkage to care protocol in place; however, only 33% of those confirm successful linkage. Conclusion: We provide the first report of statewide ED HIV testing practices in NY since the passage of a mandatory testing law. With 96% of EDs reporting, most offer HIV testing but to varying degrees. Challenges to full implementation still exist as many EDs are not delivering results to patients while still in the ED. Linkage to care plans for patients testing preliminary positive are in place but few EDs follow up with patients to determine if linkage has occurred. Increased Endotoxin Activity is Associated with Clinical Deterioration in Moderate Severity Emergency Department Sepsis Patients: A Pilot Study Ryan Arnold, Christa Schorr, Stephen Trzeciak, and R. Phil Dellinger Cooper University Hospital, Camden, NJ Background: High levels of endotoxin activity are associated with increased mortality in ICU patients.Objectives: To assess endotoxin activity in emergency department (ED) patients with normotensive sepsis to determine the ability of the endotoxin activity assay (EAA) measurement and its change over 24 hours to predict progressive organ dysfunction.Methods: Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: A singlecenter prospective observational study in an urban, academic medical center. Participants: Adult ED patients with suspected infection admitted to a medical floor and receiving IV antibiotics with either elevated lactate (2.0-3.9 mM) or transient hypotension (sBP <90 mmHg). EAA was measured at enrollment and again at 24 hours and results were divided based on benchmark cutoffs for \"low\" (1 point, mechanical ventilation or vasopressor utilization) within 72 hours of admission or in-hospital mortality.Results: We enrolled 57 patients over a 12-month period. The primary outcome was met in 63% of the cohort and 33% were transferred to the ICU from their initial medical floor admissions.Patients with the outcome of increased organ failure had no difference in initial lactate, age, MAP, or exposure to hypotension. Patients meeting primary outcome had a higher ICU transfer rate (42% vs 19%, p=0.15) and increased ICU (2 vs 0) and hospital lengths of stay (13 vs 8).Outcome patients had similar endotoxin levels at enrollment compared to those not meeting outcome (0.61 vs 0.51, p=0.075) with increased levels at 24 hours (0.73 vs. 0.47, p=0.005). An increased incidence of the primary outcome was seen with each category increase in EAA. An increasing endotoxin level over 24 hours had a 71% specificity and 72% PPV in predicting the primary outcome.Conclusion: Within this sepsis cohort, physiologic data in the ED were unable to differentiate those with progressive organ dysfunction over 72 hours, while endotoxin levels were higher at 24 hours. A high or increasing EAA as a predictor of progressive organ dysfunction can supplement clinical decision-making to aid clinicians in identifying highrisk patients from this homogeneous sepsis population.Background: Staphylococcus aureus infection is responsible for a variety of clinical disease presentations. While culture techniques are the gold standard for detection of S. aureus in clinical samples the time required for results of these tests mean they have no direct effect on the emergency department management of patients. The development of a cost-effective rapid point-of-care diagnostic test could reduce the use of broad spectrum antibiotics for these infections and improve clinical outcomes. Previously our group performed mass spectrometry on the culture supernatants of 14 S. aureus strains and identified eight proteins targets with conserved C-terminal peptide sequences against which Cterminal antibodies (CTAbs) were raised. CTAbs are antibodies targeted against a five amino acid polypeptide representing the C-terminus of a protein of interest. They are produced by conjugating the polypeptide to a carrier protein and then immunizing an animal against this antigen. It has been shown that CTAbs are highly sensitive and specific for a target protein. S. aureus secretes protein A which binds mammalian IgG antibodies non-specifically. To circumvent this, CTAbs against S. aureus target proteins were raised in chickens, rather than rodents, as chicken IgY does not interact non-specifically with protein A.Objectives: The main goal of this study was to facilitate the validation of such a diagnostic panel of CTAbs for the detection of S. aureus from clinical samples by developing a parallel panel of recombinant proteins representing the S. aureus diagnostic targets.Methods: Target S. aureus genes were amplified by PCR and cloned into Escherichia coli pET19b vector. Orientation of gene inserts and plasmid C-terminal sequence was verified by sequencing. Plasmid constructs were transferred to E. coli expression hosts and protein expression was induced with 1M IPTG. Western blot was used to determine the reactivity of the CTAbs with the recombinant proteins.Results: During this study all eight target proteins were produced recombinantly in E. coli. The reactivity of CTAbs against six out of eight recombinant protein targets was confirmed.",

Pines George Washington University, Washington, DC Background: Acute ambulatory infections can be treated in many settings, including hospital-based emergency departments (ED) and outpatient clinics. Several factors may influence patient choice in selecting care settings. Additionally, the treatment of ambulatory infections may differ across settings.Objectives: To examine treatment and demographic patterns for urinary tract infections (UTIs), upper respiratory infections (URI), and skin and soft tissue infections in EDs and outpatient clinics.Methods: This study used nationally representative samples from the National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey (NHAMCS) and National Ambulatory Care Survey (NAMCS) from 2009 for EDs and outpatient clinics, respectively. Patient visits age ! 18 with a primary diagnosis of UTI, URI, or SSTI were included. Demographic patterns, resource utilization, and management characteristics were tabulated using complex survey weights and compared across settings using a weighted chi-square analysis. Commonly used medications were assessed by tabulating the 20 most common drugs prescribed for each diagnosis and classifying them by drug class.Results: In 2009, there were 8.2 million ambulatory visits for UTI, 34.4 million visits for URI, and 7.6 million visits for SSTI in the U.S. Of those, 23% of UTI, 12% of URI, and 30% of SSTI visits were seen in EDs. Across the three groups, ED patients were more likely to be younger, black, and have Medicaid or no insurance. ED patients received more blood tests (56% versus 18% for UTI, 24% versus 16% for URI, and 25% versus 22% for SSTI) and imaging studies (34% versus 15% for UTI, 31% versus 10% for URI, and 18% versus 7% for SSTI). ED patients were more likely to receive pain medications; over 25% of URI and SSTI visits received narcotics. In both settings, over 50% of URI patients received antibiotics and over 40% of UTI visits received broad-spectrum fluoroquinolones. Conclusion: The patient populations and treatment of acute ambulatory infections differ across care settings. Patient factors analyzed suggest access to care and differences in pain acuity may explain differences in patient choice of care setting. The observed antibiotic use suggests the possible need for better stewardship in both ED and outpatient clinics in the U.S. The Evaluation of Febrile Infants Less Than One year of Age Between Emergency Medicine Physicians and Pediatric Emergency Medicine Physicians Antonio Muniz Dallas Regional Medical Center, Mesquite, TX Background: Management of febrile infants less than 1 month of age can vary depending on the physician's training, experience and, confidence.Objectives: The study hypothesis is that physicians trained in emergency medicine (EM) order more diagnostic tests than physicians with pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) training.Methods: Prospective study in a university pediatric emergency department. All consecutive infants less than 1 month of age with fever (> 38\u00b0C) without a definite source for the infection were included. Infants were treated by PEM physicians from 8:00 am -1:00 am and by EM physicians from 1:00 am-5:00 pm. Data were analyzed using Stata 11 with continuous variables expressed as means, while categorical variables were summarized as frequencies of occurrence and assessed for statistical significance using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test.Results: Of 654 infants, 564 (86.2%) were seen by PEM physicians, and 90 (13.7%) by EM physicians. The median age in the PEM group was 19.3 AE 17.7 days-old (95% CI 18.2, 20.4), and in the EM group 19.2 AE 8.8 days-old (95% CI 15.9, 22.4). There were no significant differences between groups in their demographic data, vital signs, or symptoms. The number admitted in the PEM group was 516 (91.4%) which was less than the EM group, 90 (100%) (p < 0.05). The laboratory evaluation in the PEM group included a CBC 528 (93.6%), urinalysis and culture 528 (93.6%), blood culture 528 (93.6%), chest radiograph 228 (40.4%), and CSF fluid analysis 516 (91.4%). In the EM group all infants had a CBC, urinalysis, urine culture, blood culture, and CSF fluid analysis performed. There were 75 (83%) chest radiograph performed. There were more chest radiographs performed in the EM group (p < 0.05), while all other tests were similar.Conclusion: There are still some differences in the management of young febrile infants. EM-trained physicians are loyal to the practice guidelines and order more CXRs than the PEM-trained physicians.Background: On October 2, 2012, the Federal Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control began recommending that providers emergently contact patients exposed to fungus-contaminated epidural steroid injections (ESI).Objectives: We characterize the findings in a large cohort of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) after being informed of an exposure to fungus-contaminated ESI.Methods: All ED patients presenting during a 21-day period with a chief complaint of exposure to fungus-contaminated ESI were assessed for symptoms of systemic illness, neurological symptoms, headache, neck pain, or pain at the site of injection. Patients with these symptoms or signs including neurological deficit or meningeal findings were advised to undergo lumbar puncture (LP) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. CSF samples were analyzed in accordance with a standardized assessment protocol specific to this ESI fungus-exposure event. Patient data reviewed included patient demographics, complete blood cell counts, CSF findings, ED disposition, and patient outcomes. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data.Results: Approximately 650 patients were contacted by two local facilities in our region. These contacts provoked 156 ED encounters (23%), with 58 patients presenting in the first three days of the notification period. Demographic findings included a mean age of 56 years (range: 23-89), with 94 women and 62 men. 154 patients underwent complete ED evaluations, with one left without being seen, and one left before treatment complete. Lumbar puncture was performed on 122 patients (79%). ED mean CSF findings included: white blood cell count 1121, absolute neutrophil count 844, glucose 47, and protein 132. Disposition included 32 patients (21%) admitted for further evaluation and treatment, with 18 (12%) receiving a discharge diagnosis of fungal meningitis. There were no deaths in the patient cohort. Fifteen patients (10%) returned to the ED for further evaluation including post-LP headache, and symptoms believed to be related to ESI fungal exposure.Conclusion: The recent fungus-contaminated ESI event has been a unique event in the history of emergency medicine and infectious disease. The event has included a large number of patients undergoing ED LP with a relatively large number of fungal meningitis diagnoses. Antigen-Specific Influenza Antibody Responses in Acute Respiratory Tract Infections and its Relation to Influenza Infection and Disease Course John P. Haran, Huaiqing Chen, and Shan Lu University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA Background: There are differences in influenza antibody levels produced during infection. The extent to which influenza-specific antibody titers protect against influenza infection in adult humans and how it affects clinical course is not known. Objectives: To characterize the different influenza-specific antibody titers among influenza-infected and non-infected individuals.Methods: We enrolled adults who presented to an urban academic ED from October through March during the 2008-2011 influenza seasons. Patient's nasal aspirates were testing by viral culture, and peripheral blood for hemagglutination inhibition assay against eight pseudotype viruses (psv) expressing H1 antigens that represent over 30 years of influenza viruses. Student's t-test was used to analyze antibody titers of flu-positive versus flu-negative patients. Simple regression assessed the relation between duration of symptoms and the log of the antibody level for each antigen type. Pearson's product-moment coefficient was used.Results: There were 139 total patients, 57 with influenza infection and 82 negative for influenza infection. Patients with an influenza infection had a marked lower antibody titer averaged over all eight pseudotype viruses with a titer of 287.5 compared to those with a non-influenza illness, at 640.2 (p=0.00018). Reported as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that can still produce complete hemagglutination. Influenza-infected patients who were discharged from the ED had significantly lower antibody titers compared to those admitted to the hospital among psv1995.",

Schuur 2 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA; 2 Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA Background: Blood cultures (BCs) are often obtained in the ED for patients with suspected bacteremia. While there is expert consensus that BCs are indicated for conditions such as sepsis and BCs are recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, routine BC use among ED patients has limited clinical utility. In lower-risk conditions, BCs rarely change clinical management, have a low sensitivity for bacteremia, and false positives are costly. Objectives: To describe use and appropriateness of BC for adult ED visits. We hypothesized that use of BC has 1) increased among ED visits with a diagnosis of sepsis and 2) decreased among ED visits discharged with a low-risk diagnosis. Methods: We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of the 2002-2010 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) of all ED visits for patients age ! 18 who had BCs drawn. NHAMCS includes data from approximately 36,000 ED visits per year, weighted to represent a national sample. BC use was recorded as a specific field except in 2005-6, which were excluded. We analyzed the proportion of ED visits where BCs were drawn among 1) those admitted with sepsis and 2) lower-risk ED visits, defined as presenting from home and discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of urinary tract infection, cellulitis, pneumonia, COPD, or other respiratory disease. We compared average BC use in 2002-4 to 2007-10 using chisquare and logistic regression to test for trend from 2007-10 (SAS 9.3); p<0.05 was significant. Results: From 2002-4, BCs were drawn for an average of 2.4M ED visits per year and from 2007-10 an average of 4.1M visits per year. See table for BC use by disposition and subgroup, see figure for annual BC use. The proportion of ED visits with BCs drawn increased by 1.3% (p<0.0001) from 2002-4 to 2007-10. The proportion of visits with sepsis and BCs did not increase (p=0.7). Among low-risk visits, the proportion with BCs increased by 1.1% (p=0.003). There was no significant annual change from 2007-2010 for BC use overall or for the two subgroups.",

The relatively low rate of BC and lack of change in patients with sepsis deserves further research as it may represent a gap in quality of care or a problem with the NHAMCS data collection. The increase among patients who are lowrisk to develop bacteremia represents an inappropriate and costly use of BC. Are High-Risk Patients More Likely to Say Yes to an Human Immunodeficiency Virus Test? An Evaluation of Emergency Department Patients in a Rapid Testing Program Rishi Vohra, Daniel Egan, Meghan Ahearn, Eliot Wall, and Dan Wiener St. Luke's-Roosevelt, New York, NY Background: Over 1.1 million people in the US have HIV and 200,000 are unaware of their status. Since 2010 NY State has mandated that EDs offer HIV tests to all patients 13-64. It is unclear what prompts a person to accept or decline a test in our population. Objectives: To compare the demographics of patients who accept and decline HIV tests and to determine if differences in risk factors prompt acceptance of testing. To determine as a measure of quality improvement whether patients were truly offered a test by the triage nurse when designated as declining a test by the nurse. Methods: We prospectively enrolled a convenience sample of English and Spanish speaking patients 18 and older in two urban NYC EDs. Trained research associates administered surveys to patients based on their desire for an HIV test as designated by the triage nurse. Investigators used basic descriptive statistics and a Student's t-test for comparisons. Results: 2,312 total participants were enrolled: 1,153 accepted an HIV test and 1,159 declined. 1,805 patients were initially identified as declining an HIV test by the triage nurse; however, when asked directly, 646/1805 (36%) reported they were not actually asked by the nurse and 84 of these requested a test from the research assistant (13%). Patients in the youngest age category (18-29) were more likely to accept testing (49.3% v. 39.7%, p<0.001). Those who accepted were more likely to be uninsured (16.2% v. 11.1%, p<0.001) and less likely to have private insurance (31.6% v. 39.1%, p<0.001). Both groups identified having similar sexual practices(Table 1). Most risk factors were similar when comparing the two groups, although more patients who accepted testing reported unprotected sex, getting paid for sex, multiple sex partners, and sex while using drugs or alcohol (Table 2). Although 50.1% in the accepted study and 31.3% in the declined study reported at least one risk factor (p<0.001) only 14.7% and 7.4% (p<0.001) acknowledged themselves \"at risk\" for HIV.",

Currently there is no objective way to promptly differentiate benign EnV from the potentially life-threatening HSV.Objectives: Identify clinical features and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results that differentiate EnV from HSV meningitis.Methods: A historical cohort study was conducted from January 2005 to December 2011, enrolling patients over 3 months of age with HSV or EnV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive CSF specimens, identified at our regional virology laboratory. Patients without PCR results who had other CSF findings and neuroimaging consistent with viral meningitis and a final diagnosis of meningitis were included. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained from electronic records and paper charts, including emergency department triage assessments, records of treatment, and discharge summaries. Descriptive and univariate statistical analyses were conducted for clinical features and CSF findings.Results: 166 consecutive patients were enrolled in the study, 40 HSV and 126 EnV cases. The table summarizes univariate results between groups. A significant difference between HSV and EnV patients was found in mean age [40.4 vs 31.3, p=0.005], history of seizure [21.1 vs 1.6%, p=<0.001], history of altered mental status [46.2 vs 3.2%, p=<0.001] and neurological deficit on physical exam [44.7 vs 3.9%, p=<0.001]. CSF findings demonstrated no significant difference in white blood cell counts [331.1 x 10 6 vs 279.2 x 10 6 /L, p =0.5]; however, neutrophil differential counts were significantly lower in HSV cases [7.2 vs 23.7%, p=<0.001]; and lymphocyte counts (79.7 vs 61.6%, p=<0.001] and protein levels [1.0 vs 0.7 g/L, p=0.03] were significantly higher. Subgroup analyses of PCR confirmed (N=29 vs 19) and immunocompetent confirmed cases (N=23 vs 19) revealed consistent findings.Conclusion: Patients with HSV meningitis were more likely than EnV meningitis to be older; present with seizure, altered mental status and neurological deficits; have lower CSF neutrophil counts and higher CSF lymphocyte and protein levels. HSV treatment should be strongly considered in patients with one or more of these features, while awaiting definitive PCR results.",

Consistently each year, 50,000 new infections occur. Previous studies on ED HIV testing have focused on methodology, linkage to care, and testing barriers. Fewer have investigated public health questions about HIV, its transmission, and primary care access.Objectives: To assess ED patients' knowledge and understanding of HIV and risks for contracting the virus. To assess ED patients' primary care physician (PCP) access and whether they receive HIV tests at PCP visits.Methods: We prospectively enrolled English-and Spanish-speaking patients over the age of 18 in two NYC EDs. Triage nurses offered all patients HIV testing. Two surveys were administered: one for those who agreed to testing, and one for those who declined. Surveys included demographic information, reasons for accepting or declining, knowledge of HIV, self-reported high-risk behaviors, and PCP information. Descriptive statistics and Student's t-tests were used for analysis.Results: 2,312 participants were enrolled: 1,153 in the accepted study (A) and 1,159 in the declined study (D). Demographics were similar between the two groups: the majority were heterosexual, under the age of 39, female, and black or Hispanic. 86.3% in A and 92.6% in D said they were not at risk for HIV (p<0.05). Only 61.1% in A and 72.4% in D recognized that HIV is treatable (p<0.001). 16.7% and 16.5% (p=0.70), respectively, believed HIV can be transmitted through kissing. The majority understood that unsafe sex is a means of transmission (92.3% and 97.0 %, p<0.001). 64.9% in A and 75.6% in D have PCPs (p<0.001), but only 39.4% in A and 43.1% in D were offered testing at their last PCP visit (p=0.88). Conclusion: Demographics and responses to public health questions were similar between the two populations. The results highlight significant knowledge gaps about HIV and its treatment and transmission in an urban area with a very high prevalence of HIV. Most have PCPs, but only a minority were offered testing at their last PCP visit. Understanding the knowledge limitations of this high-risk population will facilitate better allocation of public health resources and efforts to prevent new infections. Viral Respiratory Detections in Children and Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia Compared with Asymptomatic Controls: Evaluating the Role of Viral Pathogens in Pneumonia Wesley H.

Grijalva 1 1 Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN; 2 Baptist Hospital, Nashville, TN; 3 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA Background: Viruses are often detected in upper respiratory specimens of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) but determining their etiologic significance is challenging. Objectives: To quantify the contribution of viruses to CAP by comparing their prevalence detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in naso/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs between CAP cases and asymptomatic controls. Methods: In the CDC Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community Study (EPIC), we enrolled children (<18 years old) and adults hospitalized with clinical and radiographic CAP (cases) in three hospitals in Nashville, TN from Jan. 2010 -June 2012. We also enrolled a convenience sample of asymptomatic controls that included children enrolled from Mar. 2011 -June 2012 and adults enrolled from Nov. 2011 -June 2012. NP/OP specimens were tested with PCR for respiratory viruses. Analyses were conducted separately for children and adults, and limited to the time of concurrent case/control enrollment. The percentage of cases [a] and controls [b] positive for each virus was calculated. Attributable fraction [AF] --the estimated proportion of cases positive for a specific virus for which that virus was responsible for disease --was calculated as: (a -b)/a. The percentage of all CAP cases with disease attributable to each virus was calculated as: a x AF. Results: Enrollment included 693 children (404 cases, 289 controls) and 426 adults (187 cases, 239 controls). In children, ! 1 virus was detected in 65.8% of cases and 22.5% of controls, and in adults, 23.5% of cases and 2.1% of controls. The table shows percentages of cases with disease attributable to each virus. For example, human rhinovirus (hRV) was commonly detected in both case and control children, resulting in an AF of 0.3 and 7.4% of cases with CAP attributable to hRV. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) were attributable to 22.5% and 11.8% of child cases, respectively. Among adults, detection was rare in controls for all viruses; hRV and hMPV had the greatest number of attributable cases with 9.2% and 3.9%, respectively. Influenza was uncommon among cases and never detected in controls; therefore, when present in cases, influenza was always attributable to CAP. Conclusion: After accounting for asymptomatic detections, RSV, hMPV, and hRV in children and hRV and hMPV in adults were the viruses most commonly attributable to CAP. Trends in Emergency Department Abscess Care Melanie K. Prusakowski, and Damon R. Kuehl Carilion Clinic, Roanoke, VA Background: Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) are a major cause of ED visits. Abscess is a distinct SSTI requiring incision and drainage (I&D). Previous national surveys combined all SSTI to estimate abscesseseand evaluate their management by EM providers. It remains unclear how many SSTI require I&D or how providers are currently using antibiotics. Studies have shown antibiotics may not be needed for care of abscess after I&D but are likely indicated for other SSTI. Objectives: We examined 4 years of National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) data to estimate the number of current SSTI and abscesses requiring I&D and determine antibiotic use in their management. We hypothesized antibiotic rates are declining in response to evidence that antibiotics are unnecessary for most SSTI requiring I&D. Methods: NHAMCS is a national probability sample of visits to US emergency departments (ED). ED patients from 2007-2010 with diagnosis codes for cutaneous abscess and skin or soft tissue infection were included. Starting in 2007, NHAMCS included a procedure code for I&D. Patients with SSTI and I&D were determined. Antibiotics given in the ED or at discharge were obtained for all discharged patients with SSTI and I&D. Total patients with SSTI, percent receiving I&D, and the percents receiving one or more antibiotics were determined. Prescribed antibiotics were characterized and classified based on efficacy to MRSA. Results: ED visits for SSTI increased from 3.55M (95% CI 3.24-3.86) in 2007 to 4.21M (95% CI 3.89-4.55M) in 2010. Patients with SSTI receiving I&D rose from 736k (95% CI 602k-869k) to 1.48M (95% CI 1.30-1.65M). SSTI requiring I&D comprised a mean of 32.2% of SSTI visits over the 4 years. In 2007, 85.1% (95 CI 82.6-87.7) of patients were given antibiotics in the ED or at discharge after I&D, and the percentage did not change over 4 years (85.5% in 2010, 95% CI 82.5-88.5). In 2010, 15.5% (95 CI 12.1-18.7) of patients received two or more antibiotic prescriptions. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic was TMP/SMX (mean 49.1%), followed by cephalexin (17.5%) and clindamycin (15.1%). Conclusion: ED visits for SSTI continues to rise. Despite evidence against antibiotics in SSTI requiring I&D, antibiotic use is high and has not declined. Many patients receive multiple antibiotics, including drugs with no efficacy to MRSA.

Studies of the efficacy of field triage have used various measures to define trauma center need as no \"gold-standard\" exists, making cross-study comparisons difficult. Objectives: To develop a consensus-based functional gold-standard definition of trauma center need. Methods: Local and national experts were recruited for participation. Blinded key informant interviews were conducted in order of availability until no new themes emerged. Themes identified during the interviews were used to develop a Modified Delphi survey, which was electronically delivered via Survey Monkey. The trauma center need criteria were refined iteratively based on participant responses. Participants completed additional surveys until there was at least 80% agreement for each criterion.",

Nishijima, Zhuo Yang, John A. Clark, Nathan Kuppermann, James F. Holmes, and Joy A. Melnikow University of California, Davis, Sacramento, CA Background: A clinical decision rule (CDR) was developed to identify pediatric patients with blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) at very low risk for an intra-abdominal injury that would require intervention (IAI). Potential benefits of a CDR include decreased abdominal CT utilization and health care costs. Objectives: The objective of this study was to model the costeffectiveness of the CDR compared to usual care for pediatric patients with BAT. We hypothesize that compared to usual care, implementation of the CDR would project lower health care system costs and lower CT utilization. Methods: We constructed a cost-effectiveness decision analytic model comparing the costs and outcomes of implementation of the CDR versus usual care in pediatric patients with BAT. Analyses were performed from the perspective of the health care system. Probabilities were derived from a multi-site cohort study of children with BAT; costs were estimated based on study coordinating site costs. Outcome measures include missed IAI, number of abdominal CT scans, total costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Sensitivity analyses were conducted varying imputed probabilities, costs, and scenarios. Results: Using a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 pediatric patients with BAT, the base case model projected that the implementation of the CDR would result in 0.47 additional missed IAI, a total cost savings of $51,301, and 100 fewer abdominal CT scans compared to usual care. The usual care strategy would cost $110,811 to prevent missing one additional IAI. Findings were robust under multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: Compared to usual care, implementation of the CDR in the evaluation of pediatric patients with BAT would reduce health care costs and abdominal CT imaging with a slight increase in risk of missed IAI. Does Increased CT Scan Usage Improve Mortality for Patients with Blunt Trauma? Ameer F. Ibrahim, Juliana Wilson, Grace Sousa, Ronald Moscati, and Michael Manka The State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY Background: Use of CT scans to evaluate patients with blunt trauma has surged. Though supportive data are minimal, routine head-through-pelvis CTs are thought to reduce morbidity and mortality. However, CT scans are not without cost and potential adverse effects. There have been no studies to evaluate whether increased number of CT scans result in improved mortality in trauma patients.",

Average CWT and VS, failure rate and safety rate, and AOE at MCL, AAL-close, and AAL-perpendicular are shown in the table. Conclusion: Eight cm catheters have a significantly lower failure rate based on CWT at all locations compared to 5 cm catheters. Eight cm catheters have a similar safety profile at all locations except for left AAL when taken from skin to closest vital structure. Increasing angle of entry from horizontal at AAL greatly improves safety rate, especially on the left. Results suggest 8 cm catheters have greater efficacy and similar safety for needle decompression at all sites. The Role of Necroptosis in Burn Injury Progression in a Rat Comb Burn Model Avanish S.

Similarly in the second experiment, there were no differences in the percentage of unburned interspaces undergoing necrosis within seven days of injury in rats treated with two doses of necrostatin-1 or the control vehicle (46/48, 95.8% vs. 48/ 48, 100%; P=NS). There were no obvious systemic adverse reactions or wound infections noted in rats injected with necrostatin-1.Conclusion: Injection of rats with either a single intra-peritoneal dose or two intravenous doses of necrostatin-1 failed to reduce burn injury progression in a rat comb burn model. This may be due to inactivity of necrostatin-1 or the lack of a role of necroptosis in burn injury progression in the rat comb burn model.Background: Substance abuse is a major risk factor for traumatic injury.

Heidt, Richard Griffey, and Charles Kircher Washington University School of Medicine in Saint Louis, Saint Louis, MO Background: Recently, the Department of Health and HumanServices and others have expressed concerns regarding potential fraudulent or dangerous documentation in electronic medical records (EMRs), particularly in emergency departments (EDs), including upcoding, \"chart cloning\", and physical exams documented but not performed. Efficiencies achieved by EMRs' use of checkbox items that script text when selected may contribute to documentation error, the prevalence of which is unknown.

Inter-rater reliability was strong (k = 1.0 for PE and 0.75 for RE). Conclusion: We found 2.5% of pelvic exams and 8.1% of rectal exams were documented in the absence of evidence supporting an indication. Documentation of these items did not affect E/M level assigned.

Arthur 1 , Alicia Krummel 2 , Peyton Holder 1 , Christopher Tainter 1 , and Stephen H. Thomas 1 University of Oklahoma, Tulsa, OK; 2 University of Oklahoma College of Medicine, Oklahoma City, OK Background: The electronic medical record (EMR) has become standard in most EDs, but there is little data assessing patient perceptions of EMR data entry methods. Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the perceptions of patients, families, and visitors on the effect of bedside EMR data entry on the patient-doctor interaction. Methods: Design: This prospective survey study was conducted in an urban academic ED with an approximate annual census of 50,000. Research assistants queried a convenience sample of 100 patients about their level of agreement on a five-point Likert scale on the following statements: Q1: Having the doctor take notes while I talk increases accuracy of the doctor's record. Q2: Having the doctor typing while I'm talking is distracting. Q3: If the doctor is going to take notes while I talk, use of computer note entry will increase accuracy compared to handwriting. Q4: If the doctor is going to take computer notes while I talk, it's better to do so on a tablet computer while facing me, as compared to typing on a keyboard facing a computer screen. Analysis: Tabulation of results was primarily descriptive, with use of STATA 12MP to calculate binomial exact 95% CIs; lack of overlap of 95% CIs was taken to indicate significantly different proportions. Results: A majority of patients agreed with Q1 (83%, 95% CI 74-90%). A minority agreed with Q2 (20%, 95% CI 3-29%). For Q3 and Q4, roughly half of patients (for each query, 53% with 95% CI 43-63%) were \"neutral.\" For Q3, of the 47% who expressed a preference, 36% (95% CI, 23-51%) disagreed and 64% (95% CI, 49-77%) agreed. For Q4, of the 47% who expressed a preference, 17% (95% CI, 8-31%) disagreed and 83% (95% CI, 69-92%) agreed.",

Effect of a Computerized Decision Support System on Time to Antibiotic Initiation for Severe Sepsis Brandan Crum, Jeffrey Green, Jasmine Nettiksimmons, Arica Nesper, Ayan Patel, Hien Nguyen, Timothy Albertson, and Edward Panacek University of California Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, CA Background: Delay in antimicrobial administration for adults with severe sepsis may be associated with increased risk of mortality. Computerized decision support systems (CDSS) may speed recognition of severe sepsis and prompt initiation of therapy. Objectives: To determine whether implementation of a sepsis screening CDSS decreased time to antibiotic initiation for adults with severe sepsis.Methods: This single center, retrospective, pre/post analysis was conducted at an academic Level I trauma center that introduced a sepsis CDSS on 7/13/2011. Study time-periods (pre-alert: 11/1/10-6/30/11; postalert: 11/1/11-6/30/12) were selected a priori as the longest consecutive, seasonally similar dates without significant changes to ED staffing or infrastructure. Criteria for study inclusion were: age ! 18 years old; no ED visit within the 12 months prior to study periods; sepsis alert criteria ( ! 2 SIRS criteria documented within 120 minutes); infectious ED diagnosis OR symptom diagnosis and antibiotic administration in the ED; and acute organ dysfunction (lactate ! 4.0 mmol/L, persistent hypotension within 6 hours of triage or vasopressor use) in the ED. ED vital signs (within 6 hours of triage) were queried with an automated algorithm for all adult ED visits during study time-periods.The primary outcome was time from ED triage to first antibiotic. Change between the study periods was estimated with a Cox proportional hazards model which controlled for demographics, illness severity [Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS)], ED crowding, and clustering by physician. Results: 18,000+ patient records were queried with 200 ED patients meeting inclusion criteria (98 pre, 102 post). Patients in each group had similar demographics (age, sex, insurance status), but post-alert patients had higher REMS scores (p<0.001), and the post-alert period had longer ED admission hold times (p=0.001). Median time to first antibiotic was shorter in the post-alert period (post-alert vs. pre-alert: 1.8 hours vs. 2.3 hours, p-value 0.004), but after adjustment, the difference was not significant (hazard ratio post-alert vs. pre-alert: 1.27, 95%CI 0.93, 1.73). Conclusion: The CDSS sepsis alert was associated with a nonsignificant but suggestive decrease in time to antibiotic administration in adults with severe sepsis seen in the ED. 722 A Soluble Guanylate Cyclase Stimulator, Bay 41-8543, Preserves Pulmonary Artery Endothelial Function in Experimental Pulmonary Embolism John A. Watts 1 , Michael A. Gellar 1 , Mary-Beth K. Fulkerson 1 , and Jeffrey A. Kline 2 Background: Pulmonary embolism (PE) causes pulmonary hypertension by vascular obstruction and altered active tone in nonoccluded vessels. Our recent studies show that BAY 41-8543 reduces pulmonary vascular resistance in experimental PE. Objectives: To test if treatment of rats with BAY 41-8543 protects against pulmonary artery vascular endothelial dysfunction in acute experimental PE. Methods: Moderate 5 hr. experimental PE was induced in anesthetized, male Sprague-Dawley rats by infusing 25 um polystyrene microspheres (2 million/100 gram body wt) in the right jugular vein. Rats were treated with BAY 41 IV)  or its solvent at the induction of PE. Control rats received vehicle for microspheres. Ring segments (1-2 mm wide), isolated from primary pulmonary artery branches, were bathed in oxygenated Krebs buffer (37 o C). Resting tension was set (2 grams), rings were contracted with phenylephrine (10 -6 M), and endothelium-dependent dilation was tested with acetylcholine (10 -7 M -10 -5 M). Endothelium-independent dilation was tested with nitroglycerin (10 -5 M), or BAY 41-8543 (10 -8 M -10 -6 M). Doseresponse tests were by repeated measures ANOVA (n = 6-8/group). Oxidant stress was assessed as increased 4-hydroxynoneal (4-HNE) immunohistochemistry in pulmonary arteries or malondialdehyde (MDA) in plasma (n = 9-15/group) (TBARS kit, Cayman Chemical), tested by ANOVA. Significance = p < 0.05 Results: PE significantly decreased endothelium-dependent dilation compared with control rings (dose x group interaction p < 0.001), while endothelium-independent dilation was unchanged. Endotheliumdependent dilation significantly improved in PE + BAY 41-8543 compared with PE (dose x group interaction p = 0.04). PE also caused increased 4-HNE immunohistochemistry in pulmonary arteries and a 2.2-fold increase in plasma MDA (p < 0.009, PE vs. control). Treatment of PE animals with BAY 41-8543 significantly reduced 4-HNE in arteries and MDA in plasma (p = 0.04 PE + BAY41-8543 vs. PE) to levels not significantly different from control. Conclusion: Experimental PE produced significant pulmonary artery endothelial dysfunction, which was associated with oxidant stress (lipid peroxidation). Treatment of animals with the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator BAY 41-8543 lowered oxidant stress and preserved endothelial function.

Pantalon, and Gail D'Onofrio Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT Background: The term \"Healthy Aging 2.0\" is a new addition to the public health vernacular. The concept of \"mHealthy Aging\" proposes that mobile devices and technology can be used to promote healthy aging. Beyond disease management, there are numerous potential applications of media technology for older adult patients. Post ED visit usage might include follow-up on referrals to community resources and other preventive interventions. There is a perception among EM stakeholders that adoption of media technology by older patients is too low to be useful. Previous studies on media usage by older ED patients have suffered from a number of methodological limitations (small sample, single-site, and suboptimal age categorization). Objectives: To characterize media technology adoption among older adult ED patients. Methods: SETTING -Three urban, high-volume EDs (CT, USA) at Yale-New Haven Hospital (n=1922), Bridgeport Hospital (n=1900), and Hospital of St. Raphael (n=1966). PARTICIPANTS -Patients who met the inclusion criteria were interviewed 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Excluded patients were non English or Spanish speakers, presenting condition or medical procedure precluded interview, or patient was unable/unwilling to consent. Overall, 89% of eligible patients consented to participate in this study.

Shah 1 1 University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY; 2 University of Rochester Warner School of Education, Rochester, NY; 3 University of Rochester School of Nursing, Rochester, NY Background: Older adults experience high rates of adverse outcomes and revisit EDs frequently after discharge. Optimizing the ED-to-community transition of care may address these safety and quality deficiencies and will become increasingly vital as this population doubles over the next 25 years. Objectives: To understand factors that affect ED revisits and successful ED-to-community transitions by older adults. Methods: We performed a qualitative study of older adult patients (age ! 65 years) at Strong Memorial Hospital's ED in Rochester, NY from June-August 2012. Semi-structured interviews and descriptive surveys were conducted with 30 patients: 15 in the process of being discharged home from the ED, and 15 returning to the ED within 30 days of previous ED care. Patients were excluded if they did not give informed consent or were not cognitively able to answer interview questions. Purposive methods were adopted for sampling. A multidisciplinary team used constant comparative methods and memos to develop codes and integrate categories and emerging themes into a grounded theoretical framework. Results: Access to care was identified as a major domain. Patients commonly report barriers to obtaining care from their primary physicians and high satisfaction with ED access and care. Their degree of satisfaction with health care systems and providers varied greatly. Managing health was identified as another major domain. Patients reported tensions between autonomy and dependence on others, negotiating routines, and financial challenges as factors that influence transitions and revisits. Patients generally feel that follow-up care after discharge can be improved. Conclusion: We have identified a number of factors that affect ED revisits and successful ED-to-community transitions. Detecting and addressing these factors may serve to be critical in facilitating effective transitions home, avoiding ED revisits, and improving health outcomes for older adults.

Ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) are medical disorders for which timely and appropriate outpatient care may prevent worsened condition and the need for treatment in an acute care setting (e.g. HTN, CHF). Rates of ED visits and hospitalizations for ACSC reflect regional access to and quality of primary care.Objectives: To evaluate the association between regional primary care provider (PCP) density and ED visits and hospitalizations for ACSC.Methods: Data were obtained from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD). OSHPD ED data were combined with the proportion of the inpatient dataset admitted from the ED to generate a dataset of all ED visits for patients ! 18 years to nonfederal EDs in California from January 2009 to December 2011. Encounters for ACSC were identified using ICD-9 codes recommended by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). County level PCP density was determined using the Area Resource File and Census estimates of county population ! 18 years old.Results: Between 2009 and 2011, ACSC were responsible for 2,385,323 (10.1%) of 23,604,426 total ED visits. Among ED visits for ACSC, 32.8% resulted in hospitalization. Overall, there were 280.1 ED visits, 28.3 ED visits for ACSC, and 9.3 ED visits resulting hospitalization for ACSC per 1,000 adult population per year. Median county PCP density was 1 PCP to 1083 adults (range 1:2959 to 1:564). The figure demonstrates a strong, negative relationship between rates of ED encounters and hospitalizations for ACSC and PCP density, by county. Rates of ED utilization for ACSC were twofold greater among counties with the lowest PCP densities compared to the counties with the highest PCP densities (42.47 vs. 22.29 per 1,000 adult population; Spearman's rho -0.867; 95% CI: -0.968 to -0.522; R 2 = 0.7495). Rates of hospitalization for ACSC demonstrated a similar trend (10.89 vs. 5.97 per 1,000 adult population; Spearman's rho -0.709; 95% CI: -0.926 to -0.144; R 2 =0.6581). : Potentially avoidable ED visits and hospitalizations for ACSC are inversely associated with PCP density. Incentivizing PCPs to practice in underserved counties may help reduce potentially costly and avoidable ED visits and hospitalizations. 735 Reducing Racial Disparities in Access to Care: Health Care Utilization Trends in the Era of the Child Health Insurance Program Adrianne Haggins, and Matthew Davis University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI Background: Recent history in Massachusetts suggests that coverage expansions may be hampered by racial/ethnic disparities.Determining whether expanded insurance coverage reduces health care disparities will be essential as the US health care system moves toward providing more equitable care.Objectives: To investigate the effect of expanding health insurance on national trends of ambulatory care use by race using the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) as a natural experiment.Methods:We performed secondary data analyses of the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) annual cross-sectional surveys using nationally representative probability samples of physician visits. We analyzed years 2001 -2009 to assess the trends in ambulatory care use over a decade after CHIP was implemented in 1997 -2000. Primary outcomes were population-adjusted annual visits to emergency departments (ED) versus non-emergency outpatient settings. Adolescents (11 -18 years old) were the primary interest because they were targeted in CHIP coverage initiatives. We performed linear regression on annual utilization rates for ED and non-ED outpatient visits between adolescents of black vs white race.Results: Black adolescents: Among black adolescents, annual outpatient visit rates increased by 62.0 (95% CI: 16.0 -108.1) per 1000 persons from 2001-2009. Black adolescent ED visits increased by 14.0 (CI 6.5 -22.5) per 1000 persons.

            "text": ": All acute care clinics (EDs, UCCs, RCs, and PCCs) were more likely to locate in more affluent, more densely-populated counties (p<0.05). The relationship with county uninsurance varied by type: Counties with higher uninsurance were more likely to have RCs (4.0% more clinics per percentage point uninsurance, p<0.05) but neither more nor less likely to have UCCs. RCs and UCCs were more likely to serve counties with high uninsurance than were PCCs (p<0.05).Conclusion: In this national study, RCs and UCCs both chose markets with higher incomes. RCs preferentially located in markets with higher uninsurance, whereas insurance rates did not play a dominant role in where UCs chose to locate. The development of a tiered system of acute care may benefit patients through faster travel times and lower ED crowding. The effect of UCCs/RCs on ED volumes should be explored. Sanjay Arora, Elizabeth Burner, Jonathan Lam, Randali DeSantos, Adam Goodman, and Michael Menchine Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA Background: Over the last decade, there has been a 5.6% relative annual increase in the proportion of diabetes-related ED visits. In public systems where regular outpatient primary care is difficult to establish, 11-27% of ED patients suffer from diabetes, poor glycemic control is the norm, and patients often use costly emergency services for more routine diabetes care. Unfortunately, the ED is overcrowded and ill equipped to provide this type of care and education.Objectives: Evaluate the effect of a unidirectional text-message based mobile health (mHealth) intervention (TExT-MED) designed to educate, motivate, and empower patients with diabetes in a 6-month RCT on ED use and hospital admissions.Methods: Consecutive adult patients with text-message capable mobile phones and poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1C>8) were recruited from the ED at LAC+USC. Subjects were randomized to usual care versus the TExT-MED program consisting of two text messages daily for 6 months in English or Spanish designed to educate and empower patients. ED visits and admissions were collected from our electronic medical record.Results: A total of 128 patients were randomized in this trial (64 usual care and 64 TExT-MED). The percentage of patients with at least one ED visit during the 6-month study period in the control arm was 51.6% (95% CI 39.0-64.0%) versus 35.9% (95% CI 23.9-48.0%) in the TExT-MED arm (p=0.075). The percentage of patients with at least one hospital admission during the 6-month study period in the control arm was 20.3% (95% CI 10.5-30.2%) versus 18.8% (95% CI 9.2-28.4%) of patients in the TExT-MED arm.",

Efforts have been made to limit their spread via routine contact precautions for infected or colonized patients. There is growing evidence to suggest adverse effects of this practice on falls, pressure ulcers, and patient satisfaction, and it has the potential to negatively affect ED flow.Objectives: To evaluate the effects of two different MDRO contact precaution practices on ED length of stay (LOS). : We performed a retrospective observational interrupted time series analysis of all adult ED admissions for 1 year prior to and after an isolation policy change of a two-campus urban hospital. Previously, all patients with history of MDRO infection or colonization required isolation precautions regardless of symptoms. After the policy change, only patients with active diarrhea, productive cough, or wound secretions not contained by a simple dressing required contact precautions, regardless of MDRO status, except MDRO gram negative bacilli. Effect on ED LOS was assessed by calculating excess admission time (EAT), the difference between admission times for patients with MDROs compared to patients without MDROs. (Admission time = decision to admit to patient arrival in a med/surg or ICU bed). Preand post-intervention hospital MDRO acquisition rates (new colonization or infection/1000 patient days) were compared using a Student's t-test.Results: After the infection control policy change, admission times for MDRO patients were stable at one campus (C1) but decreased significantly at the other (C2). C2 EAT immediately decreased 152 minutes after the policy change (p<0.073) for MRSA and 135 minutes (p=0.03) for VRE and both continued to decrease over 1 year.

Further research will need to be conducted to assess the frequency of use of strategically placed AEDs. Objectives: To assess the association between prehospital end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) and the presence of an acute STEMI diagnosed in the emergency department (ED) in patients transported by EMS Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among patients transported to Orlando Regional Medical Center by EMS during a 1-year period. Records were linked by manual archiving of EMS and hospital data. We evaluated initial out-of hospital vital signs including ETCO2, respiratory rate (RR), systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), pulse (P), and oxygen saturation (O2). The main outcome was the presence of an acute STEMI in the ED.Results: There were 1328 out-of-hospital records reviewed. Hospital data and all six prehospital vital signs were available in 1088 patients. Methods: EMS providers in charge of care for injured children ( 15 years) transported to pediatric trauma centers in three mid-sized cities were interviewed immediately after completing transport. Patients were included regardless of injury severity. The interview included patient demographics and the Field Triage Guidelines criteria -physiologic status, anatomic injury, and mechanism of injury. Included patients were followed through hospital discharge. The 1999 The , 2006 Guidelines were each retrospectively applied to the collected data.Children were considered to have needed a trauma center if they had non-orthopedic surgery within 24 hours, ICU admission, or died. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.Objectives: We sought to determine the accuracy with which EPs correctly interpret a patient's wishes from his or he DNR order.Methods: In this prospective cohort study, an in-person survey was given to nine actual inpatients with DNR orders asking them dichotomous questions about which treatments or interventions they would want if critically ill. All patients were queried through an electronic medical record at a single tertiary referral center. Patients were excluded if they did not have normal mental status or a health care surrogate. Six of these patients were turned into clinical scenarios. These scenarios were incorporated into a survey asking EPs whether they would provide specific interventions for each patient given the DNR status. The treatment and interventions included: chest compressions, vasopressors, antiarrhythmics, ICU admission, central line, blood transfusion, invasive ventilation (ETT) for respiratory distress, ETT for respiratory arrest, noninvasive ventilation, defibrillation, cardioversion, and invasive surgical procedures. The survey was administered via Survey Monkey\u00e2 to a convenience sample of EPs across the US who were blinded to the patients' actual wishes. The primary outcome measure was the level of agreement between patients' and EPs' interpretation of which interventions should be given. Fisher's exact test was used to analyze for differences between EPs and patients.Results: Of the six patients, ages ranged from 30-86, two were female, three had terminal cancer, and two needed health care surrogates to answer questions. Two hundred thirty EPs across 17 states initiated the survey: 65.8% were male, 18% were residents, 75.5% were board certified, and average length of practice was 13.5 years.Interventions that patients with DNR were least likely to want included: defibrillation (17%), chest compressions (33%), cardioversion (50%), and ETT for arrest (50%). The significant discrepancies between patient and physician expectations were for: ETT without arrest (p=0.0001), ETT with arrest (p=0.0001), chest compressions (p=0.0001), vasopressors (p=0.009), and ICU admission (p=0.014).",

Objectives: Our objectives were to assess the proportion of older adults who require contrast-enhanced ab/p CTs in the ED within 24 hours after non-contrast CTs, and to assess the role of contrastenhanced CTs to alter the diagnosis and care of patients after noncontrast CTs.Methods: This was a retrospective study of emergency department (ED) patients ! 65 years who received ab/p CTs between March 2010 and March 2012. We analyzed ab/p CTs to determine the type of scan performed and if repeat CTs were performed within 24 hours in the ED. We completed a chart review of patients who received contrastenhanced CTs within 24 hours of the initial non-contrast CTs to identify the scan results and clinical management. We present proportions, means, medians, and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Results: Our community teaching hospital ED performed 3227 ab/p CTs on patients aged ! 65 years during the study period. This represented 2718 patients and 2216 initial non-contrast CTs. Less than 1% (18/2718, CI 0.4-1%) of patients received repeat ab/p CTs within 24 hours in the ED. Non-contrast CTs were initially performed on 72% (13/ 18, CI 47-90%) of these patients, while 28% (5/18 CI 10-53%) had initial contrast-enhanced CTs. Only 0.5% (12/2216, CI 0.3-0.9%) of the initial non-contrast CTs were followed by repeat contrast-enhanced studies within 24 hours. The median age of these patients was 78 years. The mean and median time elapsed between CTs was 255 and 201 minutes, respectively. Forty-two percent (5/12, CI 15-72%) of repeat CTs increased the level of certainty and 33% (4/12 CI 10-65%) of repeat CTs changed the diagnosis. Thirty-three percent (4/12, CI 10-65%) of patients underwent surgery and 50% (6/12, CI 21-79%) received antibiotics following the second CT.Conclusion: Over 99% of older ED patients were initially evaluated with non-contrast CTs and did not need subsequent contrast-enhanced CTs in the ED. This finding suggests the adequacy of non-contrast CT in the assessment of undifferentiated abdominal pain in older adults. In the 0.5% percent of patients who required second CTs with the addition of contrast, the repeat imaging did improve the level of certainty or diagnosis.Conclusion: Our findings do not support the idea that an increased number of CT scans is associated with decreased mortality in adult blunt trauma patients. In view of the negative effects of increased scanning, this practice should be evaluated more carefully. Objectives: To determine failure rate and safety of 8 cm catheters at the traditional location of the second intercostal space mid-clavicular line (MCL) and at the fourth intercostal space anterior axillary line (AAL).Methods: Radiographic analysis of chest computed tomography of 100 consecutive trauma patients greater than 18 years of age at an urban Level I trauma center from January to June 2011. Chest wall thickness (CWT) and depth to vital structure (VS) at MCL and AAL were measured. Measurements at AAL were obtained based on two approaches: closest vital structure from skin surface regardless of angle of entry (AAL-close) and perpendicular to the chest wall (AALperpendicular). Angle of entry from horizontal (AOE) was obtained forObjectives: To measure performance of a hybrid natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning system for automated outcome classification of ED CT imaging reports. Our hypothesis is that such a system is comparable to medical personnel.",

Male Balb/C mice (20-25 g, 6-7 weeks old) were subjected to lethal endotoxemia, and TSN-SS was given intravenously to evaluate its long-term (two weeks) therapeutic efficacy.Results: In vitro, TSN-SS effectively inhibited HMGB1-induced release of IL-8 and MCP-1 (by > 80%) in U937 monocytes, and completely prevented HMGB1-mediated release of IL-6 and RANTES in RAW 264.7 macrophages. In vivo, intravenous administration of TSN-SS at 0.5 h, 24 h, and 48 h post endotoxemia significantly increased animal survival rate from 14% (in control group receiving LPS + saline, N = 28 mice/group) to 33% (in experimental group receiving LPS + 5.0 mg/kg TSN-SS, N = 30 mice/group), and to 50% (in experimental group receiving LPS + 15 mg/kg TSN-SS, N= 20, P < 0.05).Conclusion: TSN-SS effectively inhibited HMGB1-induced release of chemokines in macrophages/monocytes in a dose-dependent manner, and protected animals against lethal endotoxemia when given via a clinically feasible route. Objectives: Our goal was to determine the relationship between overall ED crowding and efficiency and performance on pneumonia quality measures.Methods: Quality measure performance data from 10/1/2010 to 9/30/ 2011 was obtained from CMS through data.medicare.gov. Measures specific to pneumonia include the percentage of patients receiving initial antibiotics in compliance with CMS guidelines, and the percentage of blood cultures obtained before antibiotic administration. We grouped hospitals based on the performance standard (equal to the 50th percentile for each measure) and the benchmark standard (mean performance among the top decile of hospitals) defined by CMS for each measure. We then linked these data to ED data from the Emergency Department Benchmarking Alliance's 2011 survey. ED crowding metrics were described for hospitals grouped by quality measure performance. Performance differences across groups were assessed with the Kruskal-Wallis test.Results: Data comprised 427 hospitals. Mean compliance with initial antibiotic guidelines was 96%. Mean compliance with blood culture timing was 97%. ED crowding and efficiency metrics consistently differed across hospitals stratified by quality measure performance. Median ED length of stay was 160 minutes among hospitals meeting the antibiotic selection benchmark standard, compared with 197 minutes among those below the performance standard (p = 0.003). Similarly, median length of stay was 160 minutes among hospitals meeting the blood culture benchmark standard, compared with 186 minutes for those failing to meet the performance standard.

The majority of admitted neonates underwent the full-recommended evaluation for fever and almost all received antibiotics. The majority of discharged patients received neither diagnostic testing nor presumptive antibiotics. Results: There were 4,513 observations for analysis, representing a nationally weighted population of 19,312 non-trauma center ED encounters for major trauma. Mean age was 44 and the mean ISS was 19; 55% (95% CI 51-58%) were admitted at the non-trauma center. The adjusted absolute risk of admission vs. transfer was 12% higher (95% CI 8-17%) for patients with government insurance and 14% higher (95% CI 9-20%) for patients with private insurance relative to patients who were uninsured. The risk of admission vs. transfer was also 25% higher (95% CI 14-35%) if presenting to an urban teaching hospital vs. an urban non-teaching hospital, and 4% higher (95% CI 2-6%) for every additional 10,000 annual ED visits.Conclusion: Despite adjustment for patient, injury, and hospital level characteristics, insured patients and those with initial care in higher-volume urban teaching hospitals had increased risk of hospitalization in a non-trauma center rather than transfer to a potentially higher level of care. through which employee productivity improves by virtue of their awareness that their work is being observed. Off-service residents rotating in the emergency department (ED) are perceived to be less productive than their emergency medicine (EM) resident counterparts. Reasons could be attributed to unfamiliarity with the ED and the specialty, or general lack of motivation and interest. The use of the Hawthorne Effect has not been previously studied with off-service residents in the ED.Objectives: We sought to determine whether the Hawthorne Effect could be used to increase the productivity of off-service residents rotating in the ED by requiring the rotating residents to complete shift cards for each of their shifts. The cards were reviewed and signed by senior EM residents or faculty members.Methods: This is a prospective cohort study conducted at an urban, tertiary, Level I trauma center from January 2012 to December 2012. We implemented the use of shift cards for off-service residents during their EM rotations. Off-service residents were required to complete shift cards following each shift. Completion of the shift card involved recording patients seen and their dispositions, procedures done, and documenting a learned bedside teaching point from the shift that day. At the end of the shift, a senior EM resident or attending signed the shift card and provided feedback. Productivity was measured in terms of patients seen per hour (PPH) and total relative value units per hour (RVU/h). Data were analyzed using Student's t-test and analysis of variance to compare pre-and post-intervention data of off-service residents and their counterpart EM residents.Results: Off-service residents showed a productivity of 0.562AE0.

While accurate epidemiologic data describing Cambodian patients with emergency medical conditions is currently lacking, it is essential for the development of effective health care infrastructure and emergency medical training programs.Objectives: Describe the characteristics and outcomes of adult patients seeking immediate medical care at Cambodian public hospitals.Methods: This prospective, observational study enrolled a convenience sample of all adult ( ! 18 y/o) patients presenting without appointments to two Cambodian public referral hospitals for 23 consecutive weekdays over 5 weeks (Jul-Aug, 2012). Real-time clinical and demographic data were collected from patients, hospital staff, and medical records using a standardized survey. Follow-up information was obtained in person and by telephone at 2 and 14 days. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine factors associated with hospital admission.Results: 1295 visits were enrolled with 2-and 14-day follow-up rates of 83% and 75%, respectively. Mean age was 42 years (SD 17) with 63% of visits by females. In 45% of visits, low-income insurance assistance was provided. Most arrived by motorbike (57%), Tuk Tuk (25%), or ambulance (9%), traveling an average distance of 28 km (SD 33). Transfers accounted for 25% of cases. The top three chief complaints were abdominal pain (36%), respiratory problems (15%), and headache (13%). In visits with vital signs taken (81%), abnormal vital signs, excluding temperature, were present in 22% on arrival. 63% of visits were admitted and 15% underwent surgery. Predictors of admission by multivariate logistic regression were symptom onset 3 days (OR 5.4, 3.7-7.8), abnormal vital signs (OR 3.3, 2.1-5.0), complaint of fever (3.2, 1.6-6.2), male sex (OR 2.6, 1.8-3.8), age ! 65 (OR 2.5, 1.5-4.1), abnormal temperature (OR 1.9, 1.3-2.9), and time to hospital (OR 1.6, 1. Background: Injury is a major public health problem worldwideespecially in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) where 90% of injury deaths occur. In limited-resource settings, identifying patients requiring additional resources is essential. A variety of injury scores are used, many of which require advanced testing not available in LMICs. The KTS II has been advanced as a low-resource method to assess injury severity. It predicts mortality but not need for admission when applied to trauma patients in Uganda.Objectives: To assess the ability of KTS II to identify patients at risk of death or in need of admission, transfusion, and surgery at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH), a large urban hospital serving 1.5 million people in Lusaka, Zambia.",

Conclusion: The KTS II injury severity score identified patients at increased risk of death. There was a significant difference between admitted patients and those who required additional hospital resources and those who did not. These minimal differences were unlikely to be clinically relevant. Additional work is needed to identify an injury severity score that can guide resource allocation in resource-limited settings.

Objectives: To create and evaluate a curriculum, applicable to any GH rotation, that requires students to take an active role in their education and promotes engagement with the local medical community, health care delivery system, and colleagues. We hypothesize that student learning can be directed to standardize the GH curriculum.Methods: Prospective, observational, mixed method (quantitative & qualitative) study of fourth year students enrolled in GH courses at UCLA in 2011-12. Course directors identified four topics common to all rotations (traditional medicine, health systems, limited resources, pathology) and developed activities for students to complete abroad: observation, interview and reflection on resources, pathology, and medical practices; and compare/contrast their experience in the US health care system. Students posted responses on a discussion board moderated by faculty in the US. After the rotation, students completed an anonymous internet-based evaluative survey consisting of five-point Likert scale items and free text response questions. Responses were tabulated. Qualitative data were analyzed using grounded theory with identification and coding of themes.Results: Fourteen students enrolled in GH electives and completed the activated learning assignment. Twelve submitted the post-rotation survey (85.7%). Activated learning enhanced GH education for 67% and facilitated engagement in the local medical culture for 67%. Qualitative analysis revealed five major themes supporting activated learning: guided learning, stimulation of discussion, shared interactions, cultural understanding, and knowledge of global health care systems. One major theme emerged for future improvement: increased interactivity.Conclusion: Our activated learning program directed student education on GH rotations. The intervention standardized the curriculum and promoted engagement in local medical culture, pathology and delivery systems. Increased interaction between students at different sites and US-based faculty may augment the effect of activated learning. Objectives: This study's primary objective was to further characterize Kenya's CVD epidemic by assessing the influence of socioeconomics on access to care among patients with CVD presenting to the emergency department (ED) of Kenya's National Teaching and Referral Hospital.Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, physicianadministered questionnaires were used to collect clinical, demographic, and health care utilization data from 112 patients with CVD presenting to Kenyatta National Hospital's ED in Nairobi, Kenya. Enrolled patients were 18-89 years old with new or previous diagnoses of hypertension, heart disease, stroke, and/or deep vein thrombosis. Access to care was assessed by patients' self-reported access to regular sources of medical care, barriers to care, access to CVD medications, years since CVD diagnosis, and household income/location. This study received IRB approval and verbal informed consent was obtained from all participants.Results: Of the patients interviewed, 27% had new-onset CVD with an average age of 48 years. Seventy-three percent had previous CVD diagnoses with an average age of 50.5 years and an average time of 7.6 years since diagnosis. Of patients with new-onset CVD, 47% had regular sources of medical care and 67% cited at least one barrier to care, particularly cost and transportation. In contrast, 86% of patients with known CVD had regular access to care, with 74% reporting at least one barrier. Background: Injury is a major public health problem worldwide.The problem is especially acute in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) where over 90% of the world's deaths from injury occur. In these countries where EMS care, accident reports, and post-mortems are rare or non-existent, trauma registries are essential for injury research, injury prevention, and quality improvement of injury care. There are limited data available for most LMICs such as Zambia.Objectives: To develop a hospital-based, minimal data set trauma registry in a large urban tertiary hospital in Lusaka, Zambia to assess the causes of trauma, patterns of injury, transport methods and duration, mortality, and hospital resource utilization.Background: Previous single-center retrospective studies demonstrated an association between lactate clearance and in-hospital mortality in post-cardiac arrest patients. These findings have yet to be validated in a multicenter study.Objectives: To determine the association between lactate clearance and mortality in post-cardiac arrest. We hypothesized that outcomes would be better in patients who were better able to clear lactate values following cardiac arrest.Methods: Four-center prospective observational study conducted from 6/11 to 3/12. Inclusion criteria consisted of adult non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients who were comatose after ROSC. The primary outcome was difference in lactate clearance between survivors and non-survivors at 12 hours and between those with good vs. poor neurological outcome. Secondary outcomes included the association of lactate clearance with neurologic outcome, and the difference in lactate levels at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours between survivors and non-survivors, and between those with good vs. poor neurological outcome. We used linear mixed-modeling to assess lactate clearance over time and Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare lactate at individual time points. Simple descriptive statistics were used to describe the study population.Results: One hundred patients were analyzed. The median age was 63 years (IQR: 50 -75) and 40% were female. 97% received therapeutic hypothermia and overall survival was 46% (see table) . Survivors and patients with good neurological outcome had lower lactate levels at all time points (p < 0.05, see figure) . Lactate clearance at 12 hours was less effective in non-survivors and in those with poor neurological outcome (p < 0.05). After multivariate adjustment, less effective lactate clearance at 12 hours remained statistically significantly associated with higher mortality (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1 -4.4) and worse neurological outcome (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1 -4.5).Conclusion: Lower initial lactate as well as more efficient lactate clearance in post-cardiac arrest is associated with improved in-hospital survival and better neurologic outcome Objectives: Lower PaCO 2 , as a surrogate for hyperventilation, and larger BD, correlating with ongoing acidosis, may be associated with decreased survival and worse neurologic outcomes in post-arrest TH patients.",

Demographic variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. Unadjusted logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between hypocapnea (PaCO 2 < 30 mmHg), normocapnea (PaCO 2 30-45 mmHg), hypercapnea (PaCO 2 > 45 mmHg), and mean BD, with respect to mortality or neurologic outcome at first post-arrest ABG and at 6 hrs, 12 hrs, and 24 hrs post-arrest.Results: A total of 179 patients were enrolled. Patients were 59.6 AE 16.4 years, 54% male, and VF/VT was present in 31% of patients. Sixty-six (37%) survived to discharge, of whom 76% (50/66) had good neurologic outcomes (CPC 1 or 2). Survivors had a lower mean initial PCO 2 value than non-survivors (49.0 vs. 57.5 mmHg; p=0.03); survival was significantly higher in patients who had normocapnea (51%) on their initial ABGs when compared to those who were hypocapneic (25%) or hypercapneic (28%) (p=0.007), however, there was no significant difference in survival at the other time points. When adjusting for sex and initial rhythm, hypocapnea and hypercapnea had lower odds for survival in comparison to normocapnea (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0. p=0.18 and OR 0.72, p=0.38) . Survivors had less severe BD than nonsurvivors at initial ABG (-8.0 vs. -11.3; p=0.005 ) and at all subsequent time points. There was no difference between PCO 2 or BD values between patients with good vs. bad neurologic outcomes. Objectives: We hypothesized that patients who have prolonged preinduction times, or shorter times to arrival at target temperature, may suffer worse neurologic outcome than those who have shortened preinduction times and more gradual declines to target temperature.Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of TH patients from the PATH database from three institutions with identical TH protocols. Demographic variables were collected and analyzed using chi-square tests. Time points calculated were time from arrest to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (downtime), time from ROSC to initiation of TH (pre-induction), and time from initiation of TH to arrival at target temperature (induction). Mean times were analyzed and logistic regression was used to evaluate for association between time variables and neurologic outcome. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate external validity and inter-rater reliability of this assessment tool in a setting other than where it was developed.Methods: This was an experimental study conducted in the simulation lab of a tertiary-care pediatric center. A total of 24 residents were videotaped during simulated pediatric resuscitation scenarios. Each resident led five simulated scenarios before and after the Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) course. The pre-and post-PALS scenarios were paired, such that each resident acted as team leader in pulseless non-shockable arrest, pulseless shockable arrest, dysrhythmia, respiratory, and shock scenarios. We altered clinical details of the scenarios to diminish recognition by the residents, but each case within a pair corresponded to the same PALS treatment algorithm. Five subspecialists in the fields of pediatric emergency medicine and intensive care from North America and Europe were trained to evaluate the residents' performance using Grant's assessment tool. Each rater was assigned one of the five scenario pairs and all raters were blinded to the pre-and post-PALS phases of the scenarios. In the absence of a gold standard scoring tool, we used construct validity. It was determined that, for the tool to be valid, participants should improve their scores after participating in the PALS course. Inter-rater reliability was assessed by having two raters independently evaluate the residents' performance. Pre-and post-PALS means were compared using a paired sample Student's t-test. Inter-rater reliability was measured for the five scenarios using intraclass correlation coefficient. Background: Effective teamwork is essential in critical patient management. Simulation is effective for education and assessment, and poses an attractive modality for teamwork training. There is a paucity of data on its efficacy in this area.Objectives: To evaluate the effect of real-time team training on novice learners' management of simulated critically ill patients. Secondary outcomes were improvement in overall teamwork, and quantified differences between real-time and video-based review of simulated cases.Methods: Prospective, randomized experimental study. Students, who are exposed to simulation as individuals and as team members throughout medical school, enrolled in a 1-week intensive course in acute care and were randomized to receive either a 15-minute intervention on effective teamwork with real-time feedback or the standard simulation introduction that includes the importance of teamwork. Standard group students individually managed simulated patient scenarios, which has been the standard for over ten years. Intervention group students managed the same cases in rotating teams of three. On the last day, all students worked in teams of three. (Day 1=shock; Day 3=abdominal emergencies; Day 5=dyspnea). Each team was evaluated using previously validated critical action checklists (unique for each case) in real time by instructors; and subsequently by two video reviewers who also used a pre-validated teamwork assessment tool to gauge how well students functioned as a team. In a subset of cases, we compared real-time and video review completion of critical action checklists. Conclusion: This is the first study of the effect of opiate prescriptions at discharge on ED patient satisfaction scores. Patients given prescriptions did rate the physicians' concern for their comfort significantly higher. Background: Nonmedical prescription drug use, defined as using opiates or sedatives to 'get high', taking someone else's, or taking more than prescribed, is a major problem.Objectives: 1)Identify the prevalence of nonmedical prescription opiate use (NPOU), nonmedical prescription sedative use (NPSU), and the prevalence of dependence and abuse among a population of adolescents and young adults with current drug use, and 2) identify correlates of lifetime NPOU and NPSU.Methods: Patients age 14-24 presenting to an urban ED for care between 2/2010 and 9/2011 were recruited as part of a larger study. Recruitment occurred systematically, and those reporting any drug use in the past 6 months completed a survey using validated measures on drug use, mental health, and violence and a chart review was performed to ascertain ED visit characteristics. Patients presenting with assault-related injuries were oversampled. Correlates of lifetime NPOU and NPSU were examined using logistic regression.Results: Of 1,448 participants screened, 600 endorsed past 6-month drug use. Among this sample, 17% (n=99) reported lifetime NPOU, and 67% of those (n=63) reported NPOU in the past 6 months. Among those with lifetime NPOU, 28% met criteria for prescription opiate dependence or abuse and 42% were at moderate or high risk for problems related to prescription opiates. Additionally, only 52% of people with lifetime NPOU have regular sources of care and 69% had utilized the ED in the prior 6 months. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, correlates of lifetime NPOU included identifying as Caucasian and cocaine use. Similarly, 20% (n=118) of the sample endorsed lifetime NPOU and 59% of those reported NPSU in the past six months. Among those with lifetime NPSU, 28% met criteria for prescription sedative dependence or abuse and 42% were at moderate or high risk for problems related to prescription sedative use. Correlates of lifetime NPSU included Caucasian race, cocaine use, current depression, alcohol misuse, and peer violence. Those with marijuana use were less likely to report NPOU and NPSU.Conclusion: Among adolescents and young adults who have used drugs in the past 6 months, nonmedical use of prescription opiates and sedatives are common, with 28% meeting criteria for dependence and abuse. The ED is a routine source of prescription drugs and is a critical place for nonmedical prescription drug use intervention. Objectives: To determine the association between statewide opiate prescribing patterns and prescription drug related mortality rates.Methods: This ecological study evaluated trends in opiate prescribing from 2001-2010 in Florida. Information for all oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine, fentanyl, and methadone purchased by hospitals, pharmacies, and practitioners in Florida was obtained from US DEA. Purchases were excluded if they were bought out of state. Information on specific opiate-related causes of death was obtained from the state medical examiner office. When more than one drug was present, the medical examiner's determination of the specific drug cause of death was used for categorization. Deaths where drug was present but not deemed to be the cause were excluded. Morphine-and fentanylrelated mortality prior to 2003 were excluded due to unavailable data. Using Pearson correlation, we analyzed the prescription trends of five prescription opiates and their relationship to population-adjusted drugspecific mortality rates.Results: From 2001-2010, sales of oxycodone, hydrocodone, methadone, morphine, and fentanyl in the state of Florida increased from (in millions of g): 2.0 to 12.4, 1.1 to 1.9, 0.17 to 1.46, 0.62 to 1.7, and 0.13 to 0.29, respectively. Overall prescription opiate-related annual mortality rate (per 100,000 population) increased from 4.1 to 16.8 for this period. The largest increase occurred for oxycodone-and methadone-related mortality rates which increased from 1.94 to 8.06 and 1.09 to 3.69 respectively. Pearson correlation coefficients (95%CI) for the association between annual prescription amounts and drugspecific mortality rates for oxycodone, hydrocodone, methadone, morphine, and fentanyl were 0.99 (0.98 to 1), -0.21 (-0.74 to 0.483), 0.79 (0.31 to 0.94), 0.53 (-0.28 to 0.89), and -0.22 (-0.80 to 0.57), respectively.Conclusion: Increased prescriptions for oxycodone and methadone were positively associated with drug-specific mortality rates. Oxycodone prescriptions were significantly more associated with increased mortality compared to any other prescription opiate. Objectives: We hypothesize that exposure to OP introduces measurable changes in the control of respiration during sleep.Methods: Spontaneously breathing Wistar rats (n=8) were habituated to a whole-body plethysmography chamber and allowed to fall asleep before exposure to escalating doses of CO2 (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10% CO2). Recordings of respiratory response were performed using software designed for this purpose (Data Science International, St Paul, MN). Following this, the animals were exposed to a sub-lethal dose of dichlorvos (22 mg/kg SQ, or two-thirds of the LD50). Animals were followed post-poisoning until recovery or death. One to four days postexposure, animals that survived were placed in the whole-body plethysmography chamber again to record respiratory response to the same increasing levels of CO2 during periods of sleep. Data were analyzed using Student's t-test or ANOVA.",
