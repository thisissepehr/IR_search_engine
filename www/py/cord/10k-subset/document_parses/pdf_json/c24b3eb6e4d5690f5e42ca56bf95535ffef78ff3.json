Recent findings on the ensemble averageability of the extreme eigenvalue have further authenticated its applicability to the study of network dynamics. However, the ensemble average of extreme eigenvalue has only been solved analytically up to the second order correction. Here, we determine the ensemble average of the extreme eigenvalue and characterize its deviation across the ensemble through the discrete form of random scale-free network. Remarkably, the analytical approximation derived from the discrete form shows significant improvement over previous results, which implies a more accurate prediction of the epidemic threshold. In addition, we show that bimodal networks, which are more robust against both random and targeted removal of nodes, are more vulnerable to the spreading of diseases.",

This makes them important predictors of epidemic threshold of infectious diseases that propagate within real world complex network. Indeed, the recent demonstration that these eigenvalues are ensemble averageable has provided further support for this view. In this paper, we study into the ensemble averageability of extreme eigenvalues through a new perspective: the connection between multimodal network and scale-free network. The discrete nature of the multimodal network has allowed us to arrive at an improved analytical expression of the extreme eigenvalue for scale-free networks. The extreme eigenvalues calculated from our analytical expression are found to closely correspond to those obtained numerically, thus making significant improvement over earlier versions. The implication is a more accurate estimate of epidemic threshold, which is important for the elucidation of how vulnerable a particular network structure is to epidemic spreading. Our results are also applicable to the evaluation of strategies that aim to contain the spread of infectious diseases through the adjustment of the topology of network structures.",

            "text": "Many concepts in network science are well recognized as fundamental tools for the exploration on the dynamics of complex systems. In particular, scale-free networks have been widely used to describe and model diverse social, biological, and economic systems. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] In an ensemble of scale-free networks, it is known that the degree distribution of the nodes remains invariant. However, the topological structure can be distinct with different connection arrangements between the nodes in each network configuration. Such structural diversity can lead to discrepancies in the dynamics of individual network. Since the structural influences on certain dynamical processes are governed by the extreme eigenvalues of the network adjacency matrices, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] deviations in the extreme eigenvalues in network ensembles are of increasing interest in deciphering the underlying structural changes. Recently, it was found that the extreme eigenvalues of adjacency matrices, despite fluctuating wildly in an ensemble of scale-free networks, are well characterized by the ensemble average after being normalized by functions of the maximum degrees. 14 Specifically, it had been proven that the probability of having a large variation in extreme eigenvalues in the ensemble diminishes as the size of the network increases. Considering the rich assortment of possible structural configurations of scale-free networks in an ensemble, this averageability is significant as it implies that dynamical processes which are governed by the extreme eigenvalues can be simply described by means of the ensemble average without the need to incorporate the connection details of the individual network. In particular, the average ability of a network to synchronize and its mean epidemic spreading threshold are shown to be well approximated by functions of the ensemble average of the eigenvalues. Therefore, finding a way to determine the ensemble average of the extreme eigenvalues becomes crucial in uncovering the topological influences of the network structure on a number of network dynamical processes.",

When the exponent b of a scale-free network is small, the degree distribution is more heavy-tailed. The result is a larger variation in the distribution of k \u00f01\u00de i in the network ensemble. Hence, there is greater deviation in the values of k H in the ensemble. For multimodal network with fixed k 1 and k m , the parameter b, and hence k i , is fixed. In order to have a larger value of hki, the fraction of large-degree node has to be higher and the fraction of small-degree node has to be lower. This results in a more heavy-tailed distribution with a smaller value of b. In other words, b / 1=hki. When the network size is larger, hki has to be smaller for a fixed value of k m , which arises from the general result k m / ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi hkiN p . 2,22-24 Hence, b is larger and the probability of having larger-degree node drops rapidly. This means that the values of k H in an ensemble of multimodal networks deviate less as the networks become more sparse.

For two multimodal networks A and B of the same size, but having different values of k 1 , the fraction of large-degree node for the network with smaller k 1 , say network A, has to be larger in order for it to have the same average degree as network B. Thus, k H of network A is larger. In other words, the choice of different values of k 1 can lead to different values of k H . Specifically, k 1 \u00bc 1 gives the extreme eigenvalue that is the largest, and k H decreases as k 1 increases (see Fig. 1 ). In addition, since the degree distribution is more heavy-tailed for ensembles with smaller k 1 , deviation in the extreme eigenvalues is larger. Note that previous results in Ref. 14 had shown the ensemble averageability of network eigenvalues for networks with k 1 ! 3. However, it had been shown in Refs. 25 and 26 that a smaller minimum degree can give rise to a broader distribution of the extreme eigenvalues of a network ensemble. Typically, the distribution of extreme eigenvalues of certain real-world networks has been observed to exhibit multimodal characteristics. This is consistent with our result that variation in the extreme eigenvalues is larger for an ensemble with a smaller k 1 . Therefore, for network ensembles with k 1 < 3, the ensemble averages of the extreme eigenvalues have to be used with care.",
