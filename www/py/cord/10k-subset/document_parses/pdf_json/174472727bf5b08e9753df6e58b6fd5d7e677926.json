Understanding the role of host genetics in disease spread is important for developing disease control strategies that efficiently reduce infection incidence and risk of epidemics. While heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been targeted in livestock breeding, emerging evidence suggests that there is additional genetic variation in host infectivity, but the potential benefits of including infectivity into selection schemes are currently unknown. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model incorporating polygenic genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectivity was combined with quantitative genetics selection theory to assess the non-linear impact of genetic selection on field measures of epidemic risk and severity. Response to 20 generations of selection was calculated in large simulated populations, exploring schemes differing in accuracy and intensity. Assuming moderate genetic variation in both traits, 50% selection on susceptibility required seven generations to reduce the basic reproductive number R 0 from 7.64 to the critical threshold of <1, below which epidemics die out. Adding infectivity in the selection objective accelerated the decline towards R 0 < 1, to 3 generations. Our results show that although genetic selection on susceptibility reduces disease risk and prevalence, the additional gain from selection on infectivity accelerates disease eradication and reduces more efficiently the risk of new outbreaks, while it alleviates delays generated by unfavourable correlations.

Those have been described through the Pareto principle, where 20% of infected individuals are responsible for 80% of transmission events (Woolhouse et al. 1997; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005) . Super-spreading has been observed on a phenotypic level and is often attributed to social behaviour or heterogeneous contact structure. For example, in measles (Paunio et al. 1998) , SARS and Ebola (Shen et al. 2004; Wong et al. 2015) in humans, in Salmonella typhimurium infection in mice (Gopinath et al. 2014) , and in RNA-virus infections in bird species (Jankowski et al. 2013) . The existence of super-spreaders has also been inferred in epidemiological models for bovine tuberculosis in cattle (O'hare et al. 2014) . Super-spreading has often been attributed to characteristics of the pathogens rather than the hosts, for example in Escherichia coli infection in cattle (Chase-Topping et al. 2008 ). However, emerging evidence suggests that infectivity and superspreading may be also partly controlled by host genetics (Geenen et al. 2004; Doeschl-Wilson et al. 2011 Lyall et al. 2011; Raszek et al. 2016; Anacleto et al. 2018) .

Hence such models can realistically only predict the impact of removing super-spreaders as reactive disease control. In contrast, genetic disease control schemes are pro-active, i.e. preventive, as individuals can be selected based on genotypic information that can be collected at any stage, i.e. without the need of being exposed to infectious material. However, such genetic selection programmes usually operate on longer time-scales (over generations of selection) compared to those usually considered in epidemiological models.

Both susceptibility and infectivity are expressed through interactions between infected and non-infected individuals and, when subject to heritable variation, represent indirect genetic effects (IGE) (Lipschutz-Powell et al. 2012a; Anche et al. 2015; Baud et al. 2017) . For IGEs, the phenotype of an individual depends on its own genetics and on the genetics of other individuals in the same contact-group. In other words, for infectious diseases, an individual's infection status depends on its own genetic susceptibility and the genetic infectivity of its infected group-mates (which also depends on their genetic susceptibility). Hence, infectivity is not directly observable and on a phenotypic level is confounded with susceptibility, as both affect the infection status of group-members. Thus, infectivity and susceptibility are latent traits that need to be inferred through available, often incomplete, epidemic data. Conventional IGE models that have proved adequate for production traits (Bergsma et al. 2008; Bouwman et al. 2010) , fail to capture the dynamic, non-linear nature of disease processes (Lipschutz-Powell et al. 2013; Anche et al. 2015; Biemans et al. 2017) . However, recent breakthroughs in statistical inference methods can now provide reliable estimates of genetic effects for both infectivity and susceptibility from inferred infection times, without requiring direct observation of an 'infectivity phenotype' (Pooley 2014; Anacleto et al. 2015; Anche et al. 2015; Biemans et al. 2017) . This implies that one can select directly on the traits that drive the epidemiology rather than on the observed infection status. With the necessary methodology developed, it is timely and relevant to consider the potential benefits arising from adding infectivity as a new disease phenotype into genetic analyses. In the context of livestock production, the question arises whether incorporating this additional phenotype, would make a sufficiently valuable contribution to current breeding schemes.

This is because the relationship between host genetic susceptibility, infectivity, and the practical field outcomes of epidemics is non-linear. This non-linearity arises from the equations underlying the dynamic progression of epidemics over time, so that for example, a small change in susceptibility and infectivity can result in changing the expectation whether an epidemic will occur or not (Doeschl-Wilson et al. 2011) .

However, despite the increasing recognition of the vast potential of genomic approaches (Ibanez-Escriche and Simianer 2016; 2018), these models rarely incorporate genetic disease control. Nevertheless, effective implementation of genomic selection for increased host resistance to infectious diseases is increasingly becoming one of the main goals in modern breeding programmes in most domestic livestock and aquaculture species. One of the major drawbacks of genetic disease control compared to non-genetic strategies is that genetics operate on a much slower time-scale, since the benefits of selection only accumulate over successive generations. In order for genetic strategies to offer a viable contribution to disease control and eradication programmes, within the typically short timeframes that such programmes operate on, a rapid reduction in disease incidence as a result of selection is vital. Selection on host susceptibility alone may not achieve this desired outcome (Man et al. 2009; Raphaka et al. 2018) . Recent advances in statistical genetics now facilitate estimation of genetic parameters associated with a second host trait affecting disease transmission, i.e. host infectivity (Anacleto et al. 2015; Biemans et al. 2017) . However, implementation of this new trait into disease control programmes requires improved disease monitoring schemes and experimental designs for data collection, and it would also affect estimation of economic costs (Janssen et al. 2018) . Hence, the impact on disease incidence and epidemic risk that result from including this novel disease trait into genetic selection need to be systematically assessed. However, to date an adequate tool to predict the epidemiological effects of adding infectivity into genetic selection, and how those depend on prediction accuracy and selection intensity Table 1 ). The vertical bars represent the standard errors of the means over 50 replicates. The red line denotes the 50% benchmark as the driving parameters for genetic progress, is lacking. In this study, we developed a genetic-epidemiological prediction model that quantifies the non-linear impact of selection methods considering genetic susceptibility and infectivity in livestock on dynamic epidemic processes, and assesses their impact in terms of practical measures of epidemic risk and severity used in the field. The code used for the models presented in this paper is available on GitHub (https:// github.com/SmaragdaT/GenEpi) and can be adapted to match-specific diseases and population structures. The primary findings demonstrate that the additional benefits from capturing both susceptibility and infectivity can be of practical value even when selection intensity for infectivity is relatively low, and this conclusion is robust over a range of selection accuracies. All measures of epidemic risk and severity were found to be considerably lower when selecting for infectivity in addition to susceptibility, so that benefits from selection were achieved after fewer generations compared to selection for susceptibility alone. These effects were observed for a range of accuracies, with a substantial reduction of disease severity through combined selection, even when selection accuracy for infectivity was 0.2. As expected, the size of the observed effects was found to depend on the magnitude of the genetic variance assumed, with differences between scenarios being less pronounced for smaller genetic variances. In addition it was found that, depending on the amount of genetic variation in infectivity, a selection scheme could be similarly efficient if targeting infectivity rather than susceptibility.

A positive correlation implies that individuals with lower susceptibility also tend to have lower infectivity, and selection against these individuals accelerates reduction in disease risk and prevalence.

This model can also be extended to represent infections featuring more compartments, e.g. a 'Latency' compartment, or to accommodate genetic variation in more traits, in addition to susceptibility and infectivity, that may also affect the transmission dynamics. Nevertheless, the benefits arising from combined selection on susceptibility and infectivity would still be expected to be substantial. A further effect observed from the SIR profiles was that although after generations of selection epidemics were generally fewer and milder, in some replicates they were prolonged, ending at a later time-point compared to epidemics in the base generation.

The framework of this study could help to investigate the role of evolution in changing genetic variances and covariances in susceptibility and infectivity, which drive evolution in disease dynamics. Evolutionary studies have long recognised that the risk of infection has different components (Elderd et al. 2008) , namely: (a) the risk of infection given exposure (which encompasses variation in host susceptibility), and (b) the risk of exposure (which encompasses variation in host infectivity). Furthermore, the Breeder's equation used in this study to calculate response to selection in host susceptibility and infectivity over successive generations, is commonly used in animal breeding to predict response to artificial selection. However, in studies considering natural selection, it has been previously suggested that the traits of interest might be correlated with other components, which may have not been explicitly accounted for, but which may also affect variation in fitness, and this may have an impact on the response to selection as predicted by the Breeder's equation (Morrissey et al. 2010) . For example, the present simulations do not consider co-evolution between the host and the pathogen, which likely affects infection risk. Cooperation or competition between individuals sharing the same social environment also evolve through natural or artificial selection and that affects the variance in the target traits (Marjanovic et al. 2018) . In evolutionary biology terms, selection for lower infectivity may enhance cooperation between the focal individual and its social partners to avoid or survive infection, and hence affect variation in infectivity; for example in plants, selection for less competitive phenotypes has led to more uniform crops (Austin et al. 1980; Denison et al. 2003) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 427, "end": 447, "text": "(Elderd et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1221, "end": 1244, "text": "(Morrissey et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1595, "text": "(Marjanovic et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1907, "end": 1927, "text": "(Austin et al. 1980;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1928, "end": 1948, "text": "Denison et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Implications"}, {"text": "The benefits from selection considering infectivity, in addition to susceptibility, can be particularly strong in the presence of genetic super-spreaders, which would not be captured by selection for susceptibility alone unless this trait is strongly correlated with infectivity.

In zoonotic diseases such as bovine Tuberculosis or diseases where environmental contamination influences the risk of infection, such as footrot and nematode infestations in sheep, removing superspreaders would reduce the shedding of pathogens to wildlife disease vectors or into the environment (Doeschl-Wilson et al. 2011; Tsairidou et al. 2018a ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 739, "end": 767, "text": "(Doeschl-Wilson et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 768, "end": 790, "text": "Tsairidou et al. 2018a", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Implications"}, {"text": "In conclusion, host infectivity, in addition to susceptibility, was found to constitute an important trait to target in future genetic and genomic selection schemes to reduce the impact of epidemics in livestock populations more efficiently.
