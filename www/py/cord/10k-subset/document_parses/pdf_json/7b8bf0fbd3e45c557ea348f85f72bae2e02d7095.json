Profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) are widely used for this task, modeling each subfamily separately by one pHMM. However, a major drawback of this approach is the difficulty of dealing with subfamilies composed of very few sequences. One of the most crucial bioinformatical tasks affected by the problem of small-size subfamilies is the subtyping of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) sequences, i.e., HIV-1 subtypes for which only a small number of sequences is known. Results: To deal with small samples for particular subfamilies of HIV-1, we introduce a novel model-based information sharing protocol. It estimates the emission probabilities of the pHMM modeling a particular subfamily not only based on the nucleotide frequencies of the respective subfamily but also incorporating the nucleotide frequencies of all available subfamilies. To this end, the underlying probabilistic model mimics the pattern of commonality and variation between the subtypes with regards to the biological characteristics of HI viruses. In order to implement the proposed protocol, we make use of an existing HMM architecture and its associated inference engine. Conclusions: We apply the modified algorithm to classify HIV-1 sequence data in the form of partial HIV-1 sequences and semi-artificial recombinants. Thereby, we demonstrate that the performance of pHMMs can be significantly improved by the proposed technique. Moreover, we show that our algorithm performs significantly better than Simplot and Bootscanning.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) are widely employed to model nucleotide or protein sequence families, in particular for database search [1, 2] .

As the phylogeny of the subtypes, which subtypes tend to be jointly modeled might change along the genome. \u2022 The information sharing protocol could be based on a hierarchical classification system (as it is with protein families, superfamilies, folds, and classes [51] ) instead of a flat classification system (for example, H\u00ccV-1 Group M subtypes). Similarly, how strongly the emission probabilities of an entity from the classification system (e.g. a protein family) is influenced by another entity could depend on how close the two entities are in the classification system. Analogously, one could also allow for unknown entities differing with regards to how distant they are to the known entities, e.g., unknown protein families and unknown protein superfamilies. \u2022 The probability of jumping between subtypes could be modeled as varying along the genome, motivated by the fact that the distribution of recombination breakpoints is not uniform among the genome [52] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 558, "end": 562, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1260, "end": 1264, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Outlook"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Hidden Markov Models in computational biology: applications to protein modeling", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Krogh", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Brown", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "I", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Mian", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Sj\u00f6lander", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Haussler", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1994, "venue": "J Mol Biol", "volume": "235", "issn": "5", "pages": "1501--1531", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Profile Hidden Markov Models", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Eddy", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1998, "venue": "", "volume": "14", "issn": "", "pages": "755--763", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Automated protein subfamily identification and classification", "authors": [{"first": "D", "middle": ["P"], "last": "Brown", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "N", "middle": [], "last": "Krishnamurthy", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Sj\u00f6lander", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2007, "venue": "e160", "volume": "3", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "A jumping profile Hidden Markov Model and applications to recombination sites in HIV and HCV genomes", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": ["K"], "last": "Schultz", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Zhang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Leitner", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Kuiken", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Korber", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Morgenstern", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Stanke", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2006, "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "volume": "7", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Identification and classification of conopeptides using profile Hidden Markov Models", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Laht", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Koua", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": [], "last": "Kaplinski", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "F", "middle": [], "last": "Lisacek", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "St\u00f6cklin", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Remm", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2012, "venue": "Biochimica et Biophysica Acta", "volume": "1824", "issn": "3", "pages": "488--492", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Biological Sequence Analysis: Probabilistic Models of Proteins and Nucleic Acids", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Durbin", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Eddy", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Krogh", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": [], "last": "Mitchison", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1998, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Dirichlet mixtures: a method for improved detection of weak but significant protein sequence homology", "authors": [{"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Sj\u00f6lander", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Karplus", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Brown", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Hughey", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Krogh", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "I", "middle": [], "last": "Mian", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Haussler", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1996, "venue": "Comput Appl Biosci", "volume": "12", "issn": "4", "pages": "327--345", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF7": {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "The general use of tying in phoneme-based HMM speech recognisers", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Young", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1992, "venue": "Comput.
