Kallistatin, an endogenous tissue kallikrein inhibitor, has been reported to be protective in various human diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the correlations of kallistatin with other biomarkers and to determine whether kallistatin levels have a prognostic value in severe CAP. Methods: Plasma samples and clinical data were prospectively collected from 54 patients with severe CAP requiring ICU admission. Seventeen healthy control subjects were included for comparison. Plasma kallistatin, kallikrein, and other biomarkers of inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, C-reactive protein (CRP)), and anti-coagulation (protein C, anti-thrombin III) were measured on days 1 and 4 of ICU admission. Comparison between survivors (n = 41) and nonsurvivors (n = 13) was performed. Results: Plasma kallistatin was significantly consumed in severe CAP patients compared with healthy individuals. Lower day 1 kallistatin levels showed a strong trend toward increased mortality (P = 0.018) and higher day 1 CURB-65 scores (P = 0.004). Plasma kallistatin levels on day 1 of ICU admission were significantly decreased in patients who developed septic shock (P = 0.017) and who had acute respiratory distress syndrome (P = 0.044). In addition, kallistatin levels were positively correlated with anti-thrombin III and protein C and inversely correlated with IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and CRP levels. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, higher day 1 CURB-65 scores were independent predictors of mortality (odds ratio = 29.9; P = 0.009). Also, higher day 1 kallistatin levels were independently associated with a decreased risk of death (odds ratio, 0.1) with a nearly significant statistical difference (P = 0.056). Furthermore, we found that a cutoff level of 6.5 \u03bcg/ml of day 1 kallistatin determined by receiver operating characteristic curves could be used to distinguish between patients who survived in 60 days and those who did not. Conclusions: These results suggest that kallistatin may serve as a novel marker for severe CAP prognosis and may be involved in the pathogenesis of CAP through antiinflammatory and anticoagulation effects.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that is potentially life threatening despite the advent of potent antibiotics. Up to 36% of hospitalized CAP patients require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). These patients present with more severe disease, more morbidities, and higher mortality rate [1] . Thus outcome evaluation is important for management of patients with severe CAP requiring ICU admission. Practice guidelines based on severity-assessment tools, such as the CURB-65 score, allow high-risk patients to be identified and given specific treatment [2] . However, the prediction rule is derived from clinical data and laboratorial parameters, which are more time-consuming and difficult to obtain, thereby limiting the clinical applications of predictive outcomes. Several biomarkers have been proposed to assess illness severity and outcome. For example, inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 [3] and D-dimer [4] are associated with 30-day mortality and major morbidity in patients with CAP. Procalcitonin [5] [6] [7] , albumin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels [8, 9] have also been shown to predict the severity of illness and 28-day mortality. However, most of these factors merely reflect individual coagulation and inflammation status, but have no therapeutic potential in themselves. Therefore, identification of a new biomarker, capable not only of predicting outcomes but also of providing a potential therapeutic target, would be more useful in clinical applications.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 319, "end": 322, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 584, "end": 587, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 941, "end": 944, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 957, "end": 960, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1054, "end": 1057, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1058, "end": 1061, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1062, "end": 1065, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1116, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1117, "end": 1119, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Kallistatin, an endogenous human serine proteinase inhibitor, was originally known as a tissue kallikrein inhibitor. It binds strongly to tissue kallikrein and is able to inhibit tissue kallikrein kininogenase and amidolytic activities in vitro [10, 11] . However, kallistatin has been reported to have various effects as an antiangiogenic, antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and antiinflammatory agent, independent of kallikrein inhibition [12] [13] [14] . A significantly reduced kallistatin level was seen in plasma samples from patients with liver disease and with sepsis, suggesting that kallistatin is produced mostly in the liver and can be consumed during sepsis. Its consumption in sepsis may indicate a protective role to prevent blood pressure reduction [10] . In an animal study, transgenic mice overexpressing rat kallikrein-binding protein, sharing a high degree of sequence identity with human kallistatin, were more resistant to LPS-induced lethality [15] . Studies investigating adenovirus-mediated kallistatin gene therapy in rat models of collagen-induced arthritis and osteoarthritis also showed that kallistatin suppresses arthritis progression through its antiangiogenesis, antiinflammation, and antiapoptosis activities [16, 17] . In addition, previous studies demonstrated that kallistatin inhibits inflammatory cell infiltration and oxidative stress in animal models of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction, and salt-induced renal injury [13, 14, 18] . In the carbon tetrachloride-induced liver-injury mouse model, transgenic expression of kallistatin was shown to attenuate liver damage through reduction of oxidative stress [19] . These findings indicate that kallistatin has protective effects against vascular and organ damage by preventing inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. Given that kallistatin can be found in a wide range of human tissues and fluids, including kidney, lung, myocardium, blood vessels, plasma, and urine [10, 20] , its plasma levels might be relevant to infectious diseases, which commonly induce multiple organ dysfunction and lead to death.

To the best of our knowledge, no reports illustrate the relation between kallistatin and anticoagulant factors. Although it is well known that the kallikrein/kinin system is involved in regulation of hemostasis via activation of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, leading to the formation of a fibrin network, the role of this system in induction of pathologic coagulation disorders in severe infectious diseases is still controversial [26] . Another possible reason is that declining circulating antithrombin III and protein C levels caused by increased consumption during illness may simply be a marker for greater severity of illness, as were lower kallistatin levels.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 370, "end": 374, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 412, "end": 416, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 512, "end": 516, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 616, "end": 620, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 668, "end": 672, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 701, "end": 705, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1218, "end": 1222, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A strength of this study was the concurrent measurement of other biomarkers, including inflammation and anticoagulant factors involved in the pathogenesis of CAP, and evaluated the relations between kallistatin and these molecules. The major limitations of our study include its small sample size in a single medical center, which may account for some lack of statistical significance. The small patient population also prevented a subgroup analysis to examine further the differences in the effects of kallistatin on clinical outcomes according to some comorbidities. However, the distribution pattern of comorbidities between survivors and nonsurvivors was similar in our cohort. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that different therapeutic interventions may affect the results through unknown interactions with kallistatin. Future studies using more subjects are required to substantiate our findings further and to confirm the potential benefits of kallistatin in severe CAP.
