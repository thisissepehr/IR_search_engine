This excess inflammation increases airway obstruction by inducing bronchoconstriction, excess mucus production, and airway edema, which translates to the cardinal clinical symptoms of dyspnea, cough, and sputum production. Many patients with COPD have these symptoms when they are at their stable baseline status; in such patients, an increase in symptoms that are beyond their usual day to day variability defines an exacerbation. Recent work in developing patient-reported symptom tools to measure exacerbations has shown that our focus on these cardinal symptoms is too narrow (NK Leidy, unpublished data). Additional important symptoms of exacerbations described by patients include chest discomfort, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Sputum purulence is also common and is often a cue for a patient to seek health care.

All have tropism for the upper airway in the healthy human host. The primary mode of transmission is human to human. They usually asymptomatically colonize the upper airway (above the glottis) or cause mild infections. In the patient without COPD, the innate defense mechanisms keep the lower airway sterile in spite of repeated inhalation and micro-aspiration of bacteria and viruses [2] . In the context of COPD, the innate lung defense system is damaged, with subsequent increased risk of microbial colonization that extends into the lower (subglottic) airway. Pathogen presence in the lower airway stimulates a host immune-inflammatory response in an attempt to eradicate the pathogens. The inflammatory response causes symptoms of an exacerbation and contributes to progressive airway damage. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the adaptive immune response that follows exacerbations is often not helpful because of strain-to-strain heterogeneity [13] [14] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 487, "end": 490, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1053, "end": 1057, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1058, "end": 1062, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ETIOLOGY OF ACUTE EXACERBATIONS OF COPD"}, {"text": "Several studies done during the 1950s-1970s document a viral etiology of COPD exacerbations.

In contrast, when the same patients with COPD were studied in stable periods, viral isolation or serologic conversion were found in ,1%. A major drawback in these older studies and several recent studies is the reliance on nasopharyngeal (NP) samples for viral culture. There may be a discordance between the presence of virus in the NP and virus in the lower respiratory tract. The presence of virus and a specific 4-fold increase in antibody titer in convalescent serum samples is supportive evidence of infection. A positive serologic response could occur in a viral upper airway infection. Therefore, although earlier studies are supportive of a viral causation of exacerbations, it was presumed that the NP culture results are indicative of infection in the tracheobronchial tree and that an increase in antibody titer reflects lower, and not upper, airway infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 166, "end": 170, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 156, "end": 163, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "MOLECULAR DETECTION OF VIRAL EXACERBATIONS"}, {"text": "Introduction of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods in the 1990s ushered in a new wave of studies examining the viral causation of exacerbations of COPD [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . These studies report the presence of viral nucleic acid in 30%-60% of exacerbations. Beckham et al [22] found viruses by culture in 23.4% of 194 upper airway samples obtained from 2 studies of adults with respiratory illness, including exacerbations of COPD. When these samples were subjected to reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) viral nucleic acid detection, the viral yield increased to 41.8% [22] . In some of the studies with the highest rates of detection, a higher rate of detection in subsequent stable state samples was also seen [17, 19] . The spectrum of viral pathogens detected by the molecular techniques was similar to that seen by culture in earlier studies, with the exception of newly discovered viruses, such as human metapneumovirus [23] . The relative frequency of viruses also changed. Influenza was detected less often, and RSV was detected more often [24] . This redistribution could reflect the change in method of detection or changes in prevalence as a result of influenza vaccination. Of interest, detection of viral nucleic acid was higher using sputum as opposed to NP samples when both sites were simultaneously sampled [16, 25] . Sputum samples are considered to be more representative of lower airway infection than are nasopharyngeal samples, provided the samples meets the quality criteria of .25 leukocytes and ,10 epithelial cells per low-power field. Molecular detection of virus in sputum is sensitive, specific, and less traumatic than that in NP swab specimens. The problem is the interpretation of the results. Should investigators conclude that the presence of viral nucleic acids, detected by PCR of sputum samples, implies (proves) infection by the virus? PCR can detect as few as 10-100 copies of a target respiratory virus. Whether such low viral titers are of pathological significance is unclear. Borg et al [26] quantified respiratory syncytial virus in respiratory secretions with use of real-time RT-PCR in children with acute respiratory tract infection and adults with COPD [26] . The viral quantitation varied by 2000 fold (1.2 3 10 [7] vs 6.1 3 10 [3]) [26] . The viral titers were equally low in stable and exacerbated COPD. Is the PCR detecting dead or live virus, invasive disease, or prolonged asymptomatic shedding? Quantitation may help define invasive disease. Another limitation of PCR studies is the lack of immunological assays to determine the presence or absence of an antibody. Other markers of the host response might help. Papi et al [12] report sputum eosinophilia only when viruses are detected by PCR in sputum during an exacerbation. In other studies, increased levels of sputum IL-6 are reported using molecular detection of virus [20] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 161, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 162, "end": 166, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 167, "end": 171, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 172, "end": 176, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 177, "end": 181, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 182, "end": 186, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 288, "end": 292, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 585, "end": 589, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 728, "end": 732, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 733, "end": 736, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 942, "end": 946, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1068, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1340, "end": 1344, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1345, "end": 1348, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2046, "end": 2050, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2217, "end": 2221, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2298, "end": 2302, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2694, "end": 2698, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2896, "end": 2900, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "MOLECULAR DETECTION OF VIRAL EXACERBATIONS"}, {"text": "Molecular detection of viral pathogens will likely become the diagnostic method of choice in exacerbations of COPD because of its rapidity, convenience, and sensitivity, compared with culture.

Bacteria colonize the tracheobronchial tree in stable COPD. Therefore, simply detecting bacteria in sputum samples from patients with COPD does not differentiate between colonization and infection, as was shown in early studies of the bacteriology of sputum in COPD [28] [29] . However, by using molecular epidemiology, it is possible to differentiate between newly acquired strains and pre-existing colonizing strains of bacterial pathogens. There is a clear relationship between the acquisition of new strains and exacerbations of COPD [30] . Furthermore, exacerbations with new strains are associated with mucosal and systemic immune response to the infecting strain and are strongly associated with a neutrophilic inflammatory profile in sputum [10, 13, 14, 31] . These studies clearly established nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as causative for a significant proportion of COPD exacerbations. All observations to date are based on the use of sputum cultures to identify the presence of bacterial infection. Sputum cultures alone do not reflect the scope of bacterial infection in COPD. Evidence for this came from studies of NTHI dynamics in stable COPD. Monthly sputum cultures were performed [32] in the course of a prospective longitudinal study involving a cohort of patients with stable COPD. Strains of NTHI recur in sputum despite prolonged periods of nondetection by sputum culture. It is unclear whether this represents reinfection with the same NTHI strain or the possibility that the strain was never eliminated from sputum and the sputum culture was too insensitive to detect them. Adequacy of lower airway sampling was documented by measuring fibrinogen in culture-negative and -positive sputum samples. When molecular detection for NTHI, based on the PCR sequencing of the P2 gene was performed, NTHI was found in the culturenegative sputum samples in the gaps (Figure 1) . Furthermore, the strain of NTHI detected by molecular techniques in the gaps was the same as the strain of NTHI isolated by cultures before and at the end of the gaps.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 119, "end": 123, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 392, "end": 396, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 397, "end": 401, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 664, "end": 668, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 875, "end": 879, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 880, "end": 883, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 884, "end": 887, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 888, "end": 891, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1413, "end": 1417, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2094, "end": 2104, "text": "(Figure 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "MOLECULAR DETECTION OF BACTERIAL EXACERBATIONS"}, {"text": "The P. aeruginosa dynamics of colonization were examined in the same study.
