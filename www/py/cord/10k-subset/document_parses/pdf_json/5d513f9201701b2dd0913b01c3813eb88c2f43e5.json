These results show that astrocytes and microglia can be infected by rabies viruses, suggesting that they may have a potential role in disease, perhaps contributing to viral spread, persistence and/or neuronal dysfunction. * Rabies viruses have been well documented to primarily infect neurons [19, 30, 33] . In addition, a number of studies have reported rabies viral antigens and virions in human [1, 13, 29] and murine astrocytes [10, 18, 23] , and in murine rami\u00aeed microglial cells [27] , begging the question of the role of these cells in viral replication and persistence, as well as pathogenesis. Schneider [23] reported that glial cells of the pia mater appear to be involved in replication, and Matsumoto [18] indicated that astrocytes support virus replication in vivo. Tsiang also detected a minimal amount of virus when he infected a cloned mouse glioma cell line, but he did not detect virus when he attempted to infect primary glial cell cultures composed primarily of astrocytes [30] . Thus, it has not been clearly established whether rabies viruses productively infect microglia and astrocytes, leaving unanswered the question of whether these cells are susceptible to infection or simply absorb or phagocytose virus or cellular debris from infected neurons.",

We have previously reported evidence for rabies virus replication and persistence in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and in human macrophage-like cells [22] . It also has been shown that microglial cells and astrocytes infected by viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), may be involved in the disease process via secretion of cytokines and neurotoxins [3, 14, 32, 34] , including nitric oxide (NO) [28] . In the present study, as an initial step toward evaluation of the potential involvement of these glial cells in rabies virus infections, we have directly examined the ability of different rabies virus strains and isolates to infect and replicate in primary cultures of microglia and astrocytes.",

The fact that mouse-passaged and unpassaged street viruses infected and replicated in these glial cells suggests that this was not a virus-cell passage-adaptation laboratory phenomenon. Furthermore, the viral replication in primary microglia and astrocytes suggests that the previous detection of rabies viral antigens and virions within these cells may have been infectious virus rather than phagocytosed debris or absorbed virus from infected neurons [27] . Natural anatomical relations and cellular interactions within the central nervous system are known to be important for rabies virus infection of The arrow identi\u00aees a cell that was infected, but did not stain with GFAP glial cells in vivo [1] , possibly making infection of relatively pure cultures of primary glial cells dif\u00aecult.

Our data suggest that microglial cells and astrocytes support viral replication independent of neuronal infection, possibly contributing to viral spread or persistence of virus at the site of exposure in infections of extended incubation periods [25] . Glial cells may also be involved in rabies virus pathogenesis by affecting the physiological health of neurons via the release of cytokines or neurotoxins. Support for this involvement has been shown recently in rabiesinfected mice and rats. In these animals, increased levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which generates NO in microglial cells and astrocytes [26] , relate to or directly correlate with the neuronal dysfunction that underpins clinical rabies disease [12, 31] . Clearly, the infection of glial cells by rabies viruses and their potential role in viral replication, persistence or pathogenesis is intriguing and merits further investigation.",

C Human adult microglial cells infected with ERA or SRV, and fetal astrocytes infected with ERA. Replication data represents the geometric mean of two independent experiments, excluding a single experiment for SRV replication in adult human microglial cells. Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. Murine experiments were done in 6-well, 35 mm plates (Corning, Corning, NY). At various timepoints, 0.2 ml of media representing 10% of the culture volume was harvested and 0.2 ml of fresh RPMI-10 was added to the cultures. Experiments with feline and human cells were done in Linbro TC-24 plates (Flow Laboratories, MacLean, VA): entire cultures were harvested. Infectious",
