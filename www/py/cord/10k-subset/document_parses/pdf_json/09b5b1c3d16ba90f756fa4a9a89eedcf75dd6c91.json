A major current policy challenge needs attention: how to better coordinate investment among actors aiming to address a common problem, disease outbreaks. For donors who commit colossal sums of money to outbreak response, the current model is neither efficient nor transparent. Innovative approaches to coordinate financing have recently been tested as part of a broader development agenda for humanitarian response. Adopting a system that enables donors to invest in disease outbreaks rather than actors represents an opportunity to deliver a more cost-effective, transparent, and unified global response to infectious disease outbreaks. Achieving this will be challenging, but the World Health Organization (WHO) must play a vital role. New thinking is required to improve emergency response in an increasingly crowded and financially convoluted global health arena.",

This funding comes primarily from governments, supplemented by the private sector (individuals, trusts and foundations, companies, and national societies). Much of this has gone toward large global initiatives to finance universal health coverage (UHC) and strengthen health systems. But a slew of organizations (also called 'agencies' and 'actors' below) have used a sizeable chunk of this development aid to help respond to infectious disease outbreaks. These actors (receiving donor funding) include multilateral (intergovernmental) organizations such as those in the United Nations (UN) system (for instance, the WHO, World Bank, UNICEF), governmental organizations such as National Ministries of Health, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), academic institutions, and civil society organizations. During the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the WHO received over US$ 459 million in contributions from more than 60 donors to lead the emergency response [3] . This excludes money that bypassed the WHO, for instance funds sent from donors directly to NGOs, such as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) (an organization that played a significant role early in the outbreak), or to local government outbreak responders.",

The organization undoubtedly has a powerful brand derived from substantial financial and political resources. But recent years have seen the emergence of new actors in global health. African Heads of States, and the leadership of the African Union (AU) Commission, launched the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Ethiopia in 2017 in recognition of a need to develop local research, knowledge-sharing, and institutional public health capacity. In addition to expediting the creation of the Africa CDC, the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak fostered creation of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in 2016. This is a public-private partnership aimed to stimulate vaccine development through collaboration. It is not just the addition of new actors, but also the growth of existing ones who increase investment in health. These include multilateral organizations like the World Bank and NGOs like MSF. Thus, the WHO finds itself in a murky sea of well-wishers. How to navigate this is not just an internal WHO problem, but more importantly the one for donors around the world who contribute to emergency outbreak response. With so many actors working to combat a single infectious disease outbreak, how do donors decide which of them to finance, how much to give, and for what purposes?",

The UN created the Global Health Cluster system as part of the broader UN Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Cluster system to facilitate more effective and coordinated humanitarian responses with effective leadership. Accountability is a key feature of the cluster approach, with the Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC), also known as the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, responsible for leading the IASC. The UN charged that person with responsibility to ensure the effectiveness of humanitarian response and to oversee all emergencies requiring UN humanitarian assistance. The IASC's tasks include clarifying the division of labour between organizations and across the varied activities, so that all essential ones will be carried out. The cluster approach, however, is not the only solution for coordinating humanitarian response; it may coexist with other forms of national or international coordination.",

In 2018-2019, this fund raised over US$77 million, mostly from Japan, Germany, and the UK and allocated almost $65 million of it by July 2019, with $56.6 million going to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). In comparison, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), established by the UN in 2006 to facilitate timely humanitarian assistance to those affected by natural disasters and armed conflicts, has allocated $35.8 million to humanitarian response activities in DRC, from January 2017 to December 2017, including a portion to the WHO [7] .",

That means it offers an opportunity for the financial markets to diversify from traditional methods of investment, by injecting money into the fund with some prospect of a return on their investments. If various criteria about the health emergency are met, that money is used for global health emergency response. If not, the investors are paid back a small proportion of their initial investment, annually. Private investors consider this investment to be a good one because the criteria to trigger use of the fund are narrow. The World Bank disburses PEF money only for an outbreak of one of seven viruses (pandemic influenza, SARS, MERS, Ebola, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever, or Lassa fever), and only if cases of one of those diseases occur in more than one country [8] .",

Multiple donors funding a variety of agencies and projects also limit gains from specialization [11] . In 1795, Immanuel Kant noted the value of division of labour, saying, 'where work is not thus differentiated and divided, where everyone is a jack-of-all-trades, the crafts remain at an utterly primitive level'. For example, both the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and MSF are prominent NGO actors in the ongoing 2018-2019 DRC Ebola outbreak emergency response. But both of these organizations perform a broad range of similar activities, including strengthening local surveillance systems, training staff, and educating the public. Not only does this make funding for particular activities difficult to coordinate, but it stifles innovation and limits expertise as no one organization wants to focus its efforts on a particular area of emergency response. This broad focus across activities is intentional. In the current system, actors such as the IRC or MSF are competitors for funding from donors. Because donors currently finance an agency rather than a particular outbreak or activity, the applicants for funding perceive that breadth is more appealing than depth.",

Saudi Arabia and the UAE directed their grant, the largest ever commited to a UN humanitarian appeal, to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The UN OCHA reallocated these funds to their partners. For disease outbreaks, this would be an innovative and utilitarian approach to allow donors to earmark funds to specific technical aspects of the emergency outbreak response and permit responders to effectively coordinate their many overlapping activities, likely increasing favourable impact. Directing funding to specific disease outbreaks would mean less duplication and more allocative efficiency.

But giving multilateral organizations like the WHO freedom to use money at their discretion is unappealing to donors who want to know exactly what their money will be used for, when it will be used, and the specific impact it might have. And donors frequently want this information before making their decisions. Under a new outbreakspecific investment system, it is possible that donors will have a better understanding of the allocations of funds for each outbreak, and the ability to identify areas of unmet need.",

The tool should include factors deemed important in disease control and common to all infectious diseases, such as the potential for spread, how deadly or disabling the disease is, how many people at risk, and the need for new diagnostics or therapeutics. Such information would need to be unified under a common system and made available to all donors, to better align financing across outbreaks with need. By, at the same time, removing unnecessary complexity posed by many sources of donor funding for many actors, the total amount of investment going toward particular outbreaks would be discernible. By combining clearer understanding of the ongoing funding with the estimated need for additional investment for specific outbreaks or diseases, donors and policymakers could work toward minimizing inequity in financing among outbreaks. How many of the existing institutional emergency response funds could be brought together under a new outbreak-focused approach, and how might such an approach operate alongside other existing financing mechanisms? The World Bank PEF [8] , for instance, is uniquely innovative in that it harnesses the power of the financial markets for global health emergency response, in a way that the other funds do not. Most other epidemic or pandemic financing mechanisms involve donors directly funding organizations to work in some capacity to quell an outbreak.",
