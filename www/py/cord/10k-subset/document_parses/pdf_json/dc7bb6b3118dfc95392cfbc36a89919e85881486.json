The purpose of this study was to evaluate long-term neurodevelopment of patients with SCID following myeloablative chemotherapy and HSCT. Materials and Methods Sixteen pediatric patients diagnosed with SCID were tested using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and the validated Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) pre-and 1-year post-HSCT. Three years post-HSCT, there were 11 patients available for testing and four patients available 5 years post-HSCT. Patients greater than 3 years of age were administered the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence. Both raw scores and scaled scores were analyzed. Results There was a significant decrease 1 year post-HSCT in the Bayley Mental Developmental Index (MDI) [92.5 (pre) vs. 70.81 (1 year post), p<0.0001] and the VABS [99.73 (pre) vs. 79.87 (1 year post), p=<0.0001]. There was a significant decrease over time in the MDI [95.00 (pre) vs. 72.64 (1 year post) vs. 71.82 (3 years post), p<0.0001], but no significant change between 1 and 3 years post-HSCT. There was no change in the Bayley Psychomotor Development Scale (PDI) [82.4 (pre) vs. 84.8 (1 year post), p= 0.68]. The PDI scores decreased over time [86.29 (pre) vs. 86 (1 year post) vs. 74.14 (3 years post), p=0.045].",

Analysis of raw scores showed that there was an increase in the raw test scores, which indicated that these children acquired developmental skills, but at a slower rate than normal infants and toddlers. Younger children had a more significant decrease in adaptive scores compared with older children. Conclusions These findings may reflect the effects of the isolation and prolonged hospitalization that characterizes the immediate post-transplant period. Patients miss out on social interactions and learning opportunities that normally occur at their respective stages of development. These restrictions keep patients from acquiring developmentally appropriate cognitive skills as well as gross and fine motor developmental milestones. Longitudinal follow-up will be important to quantify acquisition of skills.",

Most of these studies have included both malignant and nonmalignant diseases. Conditioning regimens consisted of both irradiation and no irradiation. Consistently, however, studies have shown that younger age was a factor in decreased long-term neurodevelopmental deficits, especially among those who received radiation as part of their therapy. Long-term evaluation of children less than 3 years of age with leukemia who underwent HSCT showed average intelligence but persistent attention deficits at a median of 12 years post-HSCT [12] .",

Longterm follow-up protocols were approved by the Committee on Clinical Investigations (Institutional Review Board of Children's Hospital Los Angeles). Consent was obtained from all of the subjects' parents or legal guardians. None of the parents refused to participate in this study. Between October 1997 and October 2006, we evaluated 24 patients who had a diagnosis of SCID. Sixteen patients survived beyond 1 year post-HSCT and were included in this study. Individual patient characteristics are shown in Table I . A schematic diagram of the patients available for testing at different time points is shown in Fig. 1 . All patients received a myeloablative conditioning regimen using Busulfan (16 mg/kg) and either Cytoxan or Campath 1H. All patients were given total parenteral nutrition pre-and post-HSCT until they were able to take adequate enteral calories. All patients received occupational and physical therapy twice a week. One neuropsychologist performed all of the neurocognitive tests. Pre-HSCT evaluations were performed within 1 month of HSCT. Follow-up exams were performed at 1, 3, and 5 years post-HSCT. Due to scheduling and transportation difficulties, examinations were performed within 3 months of the scheduled date. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development [13] was used for patients between the ages of 1 and 42 months. The Bayley provides scores of mental development (MDI) and psychomotor development (PDI). Patients >42 months of age received the age-appropriate version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales (WPPSI) [14] . The WPPSI provides scores of overall cognitive function as well as verbal and performance skills. The unavoidable switch in test instruments may or may not have caused bias in either increasing or decreasing the patient's test scores. Patients also received the validated Vineland Adaptive Scales of Behavior (VABS) [15] , which provides scores of socialization and adaptive behavior.",

These studies were based mostly on patients who received chemotherapy for leukemia. Leukemia patients receive much more intensive therapy to their craniospinal axis (intrathecal It is encouraging to see that those patients, whose immunosuppression has decreased over time, are able to lead more normal lifestyles. There were four patients who were tested 5 years post-HSCT. These patients have returned to school and have minimal immunosuppression.

A possible explanation for this is that while in the hospital, patients receive physical therapy regularly. While home, intensive physical therapy may not occur regularly. Since these patients remain immunosuppressed, they are not able to join playgroups and gym classes as other normal toddlers do. Therefore, the psychomotor development scores may decline until they have the ability to increase social interactions.",

Being in the hospital at such an early age and not being able to interact with outside stimulation is the most likely cause of decreased adaptive function in our younger children.

The major limitation of this study as well as other studies of neurocognitive outcomes post-pediatric HSCT is the small sample size. SCID is a very rare disease, so the numbers of patients in this study is small, which is unavoidable. In addition, the presenting symptoms of patients and their outcomes vary considerably. The strength of this study is that all patients had the same diagnosis, SCID. None of these patients had received prior chemotherapy, unlike patients have who received HSCT for a malignant disease. The second strength of this study is that all patients received a Busulfan-containing conditioning regimen. There was not a mixture of both TBI and non-TBI-based conditioning regimens as is seen in most studies of this nature. We do not know the outcomes of patients who did not receive a chemotherapy conditioning regimen prior to HSCT. However, due to the social isolation and prolonged immunosuppression that occurs with any transplant for SCID, it is possible that the neurocognitive function of all recipients of HSCT for SCID will have some developmental delays until they are able to increase their social interactions. Long-term studies should focus on comparing those who did and did not receive a chemotherapy conditioning regimen to determine the impact on chemotherapy as well as social isolation.",

We do not know the impact of chemotherapy on the neurodevelopmental function of patients with SCID since all of our patients received a myeloablative transplant. Second, most patients with SCID are diagnosed early in life after a severe infection. Many have been hospitalized for an extensive period of time. Even after they leave the hospital, they remain immunosuppressed and are therefore socially isolated from other children for a prolonged period. Many patients have no other siblings and are not able to see and interact with any children. These factors lead to a lack of exposure to developmental stimuli. These factors seem a likely cause as to why there are significant decreases in development for the first 3 years post-HSCT.",
