Here we investigated whether IL-27 was elevated in patients with ALI/ARDS and its potential clinical significance. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and serum samples were obtained from 58 ALI/ARDS patients, and 25 control healthy volunteers. IL-27 and other inflammatory mediators were measured in BAL and serum by ELISA. Besides, a mouse model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced lung inflammation/injury was established, and serum, BAL fluid and tissues were collected for analyses in the presence or absence of IL-27 neutralizing antibodies. BAL IL-27 was found to be significantly higher in patients with ALI/ARDS than that in controls, particularly of pulmonary origin; serum IL-27 was also significantly higher. Increased IL-27 was associated with markers of inflammation, and correlated with disease severity of patients in ALI/ARDS. In a mouse model of CLP-induced lung inflammation/injury, elevated IL-27 levels were observed in the lung, serum, and BAL fluids. IL-27 neutralizing antibody treatment reduced pulmonary inflammation and lung injury and improved mouse survival in response to CLP. Therefore, IL-27 is a critical cytokine in ALI/ARDS and inhibition of IL-27 may open a promising approach for ALI/ARDS patients.",

The pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS is related to an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response, microvascular damage, increased pulmonary vascular permeability, interstitial and alveolar oedema, and hypoxaemic respiratory failure. In ALI/ARDS, many inflammatory cytokines are released by leukocytes as well as pulmonary structural cells [3, 4] . A growing body of evidence indicates that excessive production of inflammatory cytokines is critical for the initiation and extension of ALI/ARDS, and the magnitude and duration of this inflammatory process may ultimately determine the outcome in patients with ALI/ARDS [5, 6] . Therefore, understanding of the role of cytokines in ALI/ARDS may result in therapeutic approaches.",

            "text": "Interleukin (IL)-27 is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of the subunit protein IL-27p28 and Epstein Bar virus-induced protein 3 (EBI3) [7] . IL-27 is predominantly expressed by myeloid cells including antigen-presenting cells (APC) upon activation by bacterial and viral pathogens or other noninfectious agents, and it signals through a heterodimeric receptor that consists of T cell cytokine receptor (TCCR/WSX1) and gp130 [8] . Like many cytokines, IL-27 has pleiotropic properties that can limit or enhance ongoing inflammatory responses. Several studies have demonstrated that IL-27 plays an immunoregulatory role in suppressing the development of Th1, Th2, Th17 cell subsets and in inducing antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 production [9] [10] [11] . Nevertheless, IL-27 exerts a proinflammatory effect in some situations. For example, IL-27 stimulation of monocytes [12] , mast cells [8] , eosinophils [13] or epithelial cells [14] led to the enhanced production of inflammatory mediators, which would implicates in the exacerbation of inflammatory diseases. Besides, mice deficient for the EBI3 subunit of IL-27 were resistant to experimental septic peritonitis [15] , and IL-27 receptordeficient mice were protected from proteoglycan-induced arthritis and had lower inflammatory reactions and enhanced survival in the MRL/lpr model of lupus [16, 17] . Moreover, IL-27 could promote T cell-dependent colitis [18] . Therefore, IL-27 has important pathophysiological relevance in some inflammatory diseases.",

In this study, we hypothesized that IL-27 levels in patients with ALI/ARDS would be elevated compared to healthy controls. We also sought to determine if IL-27 levels in ALI/ARDS patients would correlate with disease severity and would be associated with increased pulmonary inflammation.

When the saline was recovered by aspiration, the ELF and its components were recovered along with it. BAL cytokine concentration was adjusted using urea. For quantification of alveolar lining fluid, urea was used as an endogenous marker of dilution. Values were corrected according to the dilution factor as ratio of serum urea/BAL urea. To obtain differential cell counts, a 100 \u03bcL aliquot of cells was subjected to cytocentrifugation (Cytospin; Cytopro Wescor; Syracuse, NY), air dried, and stained with Giemsa Diff-Quik II stain (Baxter Scientific Products; McGaw Park, IL). Differential cell counts were made from a minimum count of 300 cells and results were expressed as a proportion of total cell population. Cell counts were thus expressed for neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes. Blood was similarly centrifuged to separate cells from serum immediately after collection and aliquoted.

It has been suggested that IL-27 functioned by inducing the differentiation of IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells in vivo, which was essential for the development of arthritis in a proteoglycan-induced arthritis model [16] . In the ConA model of T cell-mediated hepatitis, IL-27EBI3-deficient mice were found to be almost completely protected from ConA-induced liver damage [23] . Besides, IL-27 also contributed to T cell-dependent intestinal inflammation and it was suggested that IL-27 would be a novel potential therapeutic target for treatment of sepsis [15, 18] . The proinflammatory role of IL-27 in airway inflammatory diseases has been recently identified. Our previous studies have claimed that the levels of IL-27 were elevated in airway inflammatory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and pulmonary tuberculosis [24] , and a more recent study also demonstrated elevated IL-27 levels in patients with influenza A virus infection [25] . Furthermore, IL-27 could activate pulmonary epithelial cells to produce IL-6, CXCL10 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and it could induce human monocytes, mast cells and eosinohphils to produce a variety of cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-18, TNF-\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b1, and MIP-1\u03b2, IL-1\u03b2, CXCL1, CCL2 and CXCL8, singly or jointly [8, [12] [13] [14] 24] . All these target cells of IL-27 are potential effector cells in local airway inflammatory reactions, IL-27 may thus play a critical role in airway inflammation, which triggers or progresses to AIL.",

            "text": "IL-27 is known to be mainly expressed by APC, such as dendritic cells [26] , macrophages [27] and monocytes [28] , which could be accumulated and activated during ALI. Thus, it is logical that IL-27 might serve as an indicator in ALI. In fact, our present study showed that there was an association between IL-27 concentrations and macrophages in BAL fluids. Besides, BAL IL-27 also correlated with BAL neutrophils and lymphocytes, and this could be explained by that IL-27 is an inducer of CXCL8 and CXCL10, which are potent chemokines for neutrophils and activated T cells, respectively [29] . Furthermore, BAL IL-27 had a relationship with some cytokines and chemokines. All these data support the proinflammatory role of IL-27 in ALI. For the diagnosis of ALI by IL-27, the specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 91 %, 36 %, 92 % and 57 %, respectively. The limitation of IL-27 as a biomarker should be considered. BAL IL-27 levels of only 18 out of 58 ALI/ARDS patients were higher than the maximum BAL IL-27 levels of healthy controls. This means that BAL IL-27 may not always be useful to differentiate healthy controls from ALI/ARDS patients. Besides, although regression analysis injury patients are required to further determine the utility of IL-27 as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for ALI/ARDS. However, effective treatments could down-regulate increased levels of IL-27 in patients with ALI/ARDS, supporting IL-27 as pathophysiologic process in ALI.",

            "text": "The lung is one of the first organs to be affected in septic patients, to further study the role of the IL-27 in ALI, we used a mouse model of CLP-induced lung inflammation/injury. Our present study showed that lung injuries, characterized by increased disruption of lung architecture, extravasation of red blood cells, accumulation of inflammatory cells, and interstitial edema, were present 24 h after CLP in vehicle-treated animals. These injuries were associated with increased levels of IL-27 in the pulmonary tissues and circulating blood. Interestingly, the expression of IL-27 has been strongly increased as early as 6 h in the lungs or PBMC after CLP, suggesting that IL-27 production may be an initial event in the inflammatory process of AIL/ARDS. In this regard, inhibition of IL-27 may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of CLP-induced lung inflammation/injury. Here, we demonstrated that treatment with IL-27 neutralizing antibodies decreased the levels of pulmonary inflammatory cytokine/chemokine which has been shown to play an important role in the development of ALI/ARDS [26, 29, 30] , and prevented lung edema and inflammatory cell recruitment to the airways after CLPinduced lung inflammation/injury. Furthermore, inhibition of IL-27 could significantly improve mice survival after CLPinduced lung inflammation/injury. It is now well considered that an integrated network of inflammatory mediators and a variety of inflammatory cells plays pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AIL/ARDS [1, 3] , our results therefore suggest that these beneficial effects of IL-27 inhibition principally involve the prevention of excessive inflammatory reactions during ALI/ARDS. A previous study also showed that in vivo blockade of IL-27 function using a soluble IL-27 receptor fusion protein led to reduced pSTAT1 levels and suppression of liver injury [23] . All these work support a key pathogenic role of IL-27 in inflammation-mediated tissue injury. Anyway, this is the first report that IL-27 may be a novel therapeutic target in treating ALI/ARDS.",

Thus, further studies are required to investigate the protective effects of neutralizing IL-27 in other models that directly target lung, such as ventilator-induced or virus-induced lung injury. Besides, a recent study also showed that IL-18 neutralizing antibody treatment could reduce lung injury in response to mechanical ventilation [30] . We speculate that the combination of neutralizing antibodies against IL-27 and IL-18 or other inflammatory mediators would offer the potential of targeting multiple inflammatory mechanisms, thereby improving the effectiveness for the treatment of ALI, and this way warrants further investigation.",
