In some countries, monitoring of antiretroviral therapy is now more expensive than treatment itself. In addition, some commercial assays have shown shortcomings in quantifying rare genotypes.

The rate of positive results in all (n \u03ed 43) samples tested with the Roche Amplicor conventional protocol was 51.7% compared with 65% when the same samples were tested with the real-time LTR assay. The corresponding numbers (percentage positive with the comparison method/percentage positive with LTR assay) for the other methods were as follows: Roche Amplicor ultrasensitive (n \u03ed 133 samples), 81.2% vs 82.7% for the LTR assay; NucliSens QT (n \u03ed 453), 60.5% vs 65.1%; Bayer Versant (n \u03ed 43), 57.7% vs 55.4%; total (n \u03ed 1450), 59.0% vs 63.8%.
