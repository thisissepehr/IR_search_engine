Expression of the recombinant Pfs48/45 proteins was conducted in super Sf9 cells combined with the use of tunicamycin to prevent Nglycosylation. the proteins were then evaluated as immunogens in mice to demonstrate the induction of functionally active polyclonal antibody responses as measured in the standard membrane feeding assay (SMFA).

Further characterization of the biologically active 6C protein demonstrated it was homogeneous in terms of size, charge, conformation, absence of glycosylation, and containing proper disulfide bond pairings. this study presents an alternative expression system, without the need of a fusion protein partner, for the Pfs48/45 6C protein fragment including further evaluation as a potential transmissionblocking vaccine candidate.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Malaria transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) are being evaluated for their potential to serve as a supplemental tool to accelerate the elimination of malaria.

Several sexual stage antigens (e.g., Pfs25, Pfs230 and Pfs48/45) have been identified as promising TBV targets for research or early stage clinical development. In clinical testing, Pfs25, when delivered as nanoparticles 4 , induced functional antibodies. However, the responses were of low magnitude and short-lived 5,6 .

Consisting of 448 amino acids in its full-length form, the native Pfs48/45 sequence also contains a signal sequence, three cysteine motifs organized as one and half double domains, a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor and seven potential N-glycosylation sites 14 . open Scientific RepoRtS | (2020) 10:395 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-57384-w", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The expression of soluble and properly folded full-length Pfs48/45 has presented a challenge for recombinant expression systems, thus leading to focused efforts on expression of individual domains of Pfs48/45. This difficulty in expression has largely been attributed to its three-domain structure and large number of disulfide bonds (16 cysteines arranged as eight disulfide pairs). Conformational monoclonal antibodies are available and have facilitated the design and characterization of recombinant Pfs48/45 proteins. For example, rat monoclonal antibody 85RF45.1, developed by Roeffen et al. using the native gametocyte antigen, recognizes the C-terminal epitope I 15 and possesses potent transmission-blocking activities (TBA) with an IC 80 of 1-3 \u00b5g/mL as measured in the SMFA 16 . To design a recombinant TBV, Outchkourov et al. analyzed the transmission-blocking (TB) epitopes on the Pfs48/45 protein and determined the C-terminal six-cysteine module termed 6C was recognized by the 85RF45.1 monoclonal antibody 17 . An extended design including the middle four-cysteine module and the C-terminal 6C, designated as 10C, has also been attempted.

Singh et al. reported successful expression and characterization of 6C as a chimera fused with N-terminal region of GLURP (R0) and a C-terminal his tag in the Lactococcus lactis system 20 . Biochemical characterization has also been well reported for R0.6C, with a final purified yield of 25 mg/L culture as well as the ability to elicit functional antibodies in rats 20 .

Such systems add additional complexity since Plasmodium parasites lack N-linked glycosylation machinery 21 but Pfs48/45 contains seven potential N-glycosylation sites when expressed in eukaryotic systems. Thus, the protein could be aberrantly glycosylated impacting the ability to generate functional antibodies. Evidence suggested by Kapula et al. that expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells of unmodified Pfs48/45 (48/45 +Ngln) and modified Pfs48/45 that removes glycosylation sites (48/45-NGln) could be achieved 22 .

To address the glycosylation propensity of the Pfs48/45 molecule during insect cell production, two approaches were undertaken. In an effort to minimize modifications (e.g., mutations) to the native gene sequence, the primary approach was to include tunicamycin, an antibiotic, in the expression culture as it has been demonstrated to effectively inhibit N-glycosylation in the insect/baculovirus expression system 28, 29 . The secondary approach to eliminate N-glycosylation in the 6C fragment was to mutate the two high probability N-glycosylation sites at positions N299 and N303 in the 6C construct (termed 6C-Mut).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 171, "end": 172, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 781, "end": 783, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1201, "end": 1204, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1205, "end": 1207, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "To test the initial feasibility of expression in the presence of tunicamycin, 30 mL culture was infected with baculovirus at 1 MOI (multiplicity of infection) and tunicamycin was added to a final concentration of 0, 0.2 or 1 \u00b5g/ mL.

To test if the recombinant proteins represented the native conformation and therefore could elicit functional antibodies, a mouse immunogenicity study was conducted on all three baculovirus Pfs48/45 proteins formulated with the water-in-oil emulsion adjuvant Montanide ISA720. Antibody responses against each immunogen were determined by ELISA, and all recombinant proteins were immunogenic with median ELISA titer of >4,000 units and negative controls showing undetectable level of response (<18 ELISA units) against all three proteins. Biological activity of induced antibodies was then evaluated by SMFA using purified IgG derived from serum pool from all mice in each immunization group.

To confirm the functional activities of anti-6C IgGs, the two samples were further tested at three concentrations in an independent assay ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table S2, Feed #2). Significant reduction in oocyst density was reproduced by IgGs tested at 750 \u03bcg/mL (>89% reduction, p < 0.001). Although percentage reductions at lower concentrations (250 and 83 \u00b5g/mL) did not reach significant level for both IgGs, a trend toward dose-dependent oocyst density reductions was observed.
