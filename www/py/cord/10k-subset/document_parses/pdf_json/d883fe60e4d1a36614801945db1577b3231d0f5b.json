When anaerobic biomass was added to the reactor the log removal for both phages increased, and this was thought to be due to a complex relationship with the biofilm on the membrane. CONCLUSIONS: Overall MS-2 rejections ranged from 1.75 up to 5.5 log, with the highest rejections observed at the highest sparging rates after extensive fouling had occurred. For T4, removal in the AnMBR ranged from 5 log up to complete removal (>log 7).",

For viruses this is not often the case, and viruses can vary in size from approximately 20 nm up to 200 nm. Therefore, most viruses should be able to pass through the membrane without restriction, although due to the surface biofilm which grows on the membrane this may not always be the case.

While UV radiation is less hazardous, it is expensive to run due to the energy cost of operating a large number of UV bulbs; in addition, with UV radiation it is difficult to immediately monitor the efficacy of treatment.

            "text": "Due to the difficulties and safety concerns involved in using enteric viruses, bacteriophages are frequently used as viral indicators because of their similarities with pathogenic viruses in terms of structural morphology, size, and behaviour. 2 As with viruses, phages come in a wide range of shapes and sizes. The smallest phages such as MS-2 with a diameter of 24 nm, have been widely used as a model for the Polio virus which has a diameter of 27 nm. 5 -7 Similarly, the T4 phage (longest dimension 200 nm) has been used as an indicator for larger viruses such as the SARS virus. 8 Without tertiary treatment the potential for viral removal in a conventional sewage treatment works (STW) is limited, and some workers found a 1.31 log removal of a T4 phage across all units of a STW. 9 The greatest removal in an individual unit was in the activated sludge tanks, which exhibited a 0.91 log removal; this overall removal is similar to that found by Xagoraraki et al. 3 for virus removal, demonstrating the similarities between virus and phage data. Studies on virus removal have tended to focus on aerobic MBRs rather than the AnMBR. The first study investigating phage removal in an MBR was conducted by Chiemchaisri et al. using a Q coliphage in a reactor treating domestic wastewater. 10 The researchers determined a 4-6 log removal of the phage across the membrane, while in a similar experiment other researchers determined a 3-4 log removal. 3, 11 Both attributed the phage removal to the cake/gel layer on the membrane surface. However, for use as a viral indicator the Q phage is not suitable because it has been shown to aggregate at pHs between 7 and 5, thereby changing its rejection. 12 This aggregation effect is shown by all phages, however, for the MS-2 and T4 phages the aggregation pH is lower than 5, which is outside the operational parameters of the AnMBR. 12 Shang et al. studied the removal potential of the MS-2 bacteriophage in an aerobic MBR using a 0.4 \u03bcm hollow fiber membrane; they found that the membrane alone showed a poor log removal of the phage (0.4 log). 2 However, when operated in the presence of activated sludge the phage removal increased, and this was attributed to the presence of a biofilm layer on the membrane surface. Over a period of 3 weeks as the biofilm developed, virus removal increased from an initial LRV of 0.8 up to 2.5 LRV after 3 weeks of operation. Other studies have investigated the removal of the T4 phage in MBRs because this is one of the largest phages, and hence the LRV is typically much higher, ranging from 5.5 up to complete removal. 8, 13 Again the cake and gel layer on the membrane surface was suggested to be responsible for the majority of the LRV, although very few researchers have examined this phenomenon in any detail, and never in an anaerobic membrane system. There are some indications that anaerobic environments may lead to higher pathogen removal than aerobic systems due to the presence of specific solutes, e.g. ammonia, and hence this was one reason for examining virus removal under anaerobic conditions. 14 It is important to note that in a general operational sense membrane fouling is considered to be an unwanted consequence of MBR operation, due to the fouling layer increasing the transmembrane pressure (TMP), and often reducing the flux. In recent years there has been a plethora of studies into the understanding and mitigation of fouling in MBRs. 15, 16 One of the most common methods for controlling fouling in the MBR (aerobic or anaerobic) is to bubble gas from below the membrane to induce shear across the membrane surface. 17 Hence this study aimed to determine the LRV for both MS-2 and T4 phage removal in an AnMBR, to see if the removal was similar, and whether anaerobic conditions in contrast to aerobic conditions had an influence on virus removal. Furthermore, phage removal was also determined at different sparging rates across the membrane surface to determine how fouling, and its cumulative influence, affects phage removal.",

However, the exact phage concentration in the reactor at any particular time was determined through direct sampling and analysis. Samples were collected inside the reactor from the bulk phase by connecting a 20 mL syringe to the relevant sample port. Effluent samples were collected from a T valve situated just after the membrane pump. Each sample was analysed at several different dilution factors, and each dilution factor was duplicated to ensure accuracy. The first samples were taken no earlier than 1 h after injection to allow for complete mixing. For each gas scouring rate thre samples were taken from inside the reactor and three from the effluent. Each sample was treated and enumerated as described above; the LRV was calculated using Equation (1) . Prior to the start of the experiment the membrane was removed from the reactor and cleaned with a 1% oxalic and 0.5% NaOCl solution. 15 The membrane was then re-submerged in the reactor and operated at the highest sparging rate until a steady TMP was achieved. The LRV at the highest sparging rate was then monitored over a period of 3 days in order to ascertain if it was stable. Once a stable LRV at 10 liters per minute (LPM) had been established, the sparging rate in the reactor was reduced and the reactor left for 24 h to reach a new equilibrium, and the next LRV assessed. To avoid any contamination between phages the experiments with the T4 phage were carried out in a separate AnMBR to the MS-2 experiments, and the different phage samples stored in separate fridges.",

The AnMBR was both filled and fed with deionised water, and at a constant flux below the clean water flux for the membrane no pressure drop across the membrane was detected. A small amount of phage removal from the membrane alone was expected due to sieving effects (size exclusion). The MS-2 phage removal for the membrane alone was determined to be 0.7 \u00b1 0.4 LRV. This was slightly greater than the 0.4 LRV achieved by Shang et al. on similar membranes, but their result falls within the \u00b1 0.4 log error margin determined for this data point. 2 The base line removal for the larger T4 phage was found to be 2.3 LRV \u00b10.2, and this was slightly greater than Lv et al. who achieved a 1.7 LRV for the membrane alone. 8 The AnMBR was then filled with acclimated biomass and operated under the conditions described in the methods section. The AnMBR was initially operated at a 10 LPM sparging rate, which was sequentially decreased to 2 LPM over time. The results of this experiment for the MS-2 and T4 phages are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 , respectively. For both MS-2 and T4 the TMP remained negligible for sparging rates between 10 and 4 LPM, because the reactor was operated below the critical flux -the case at 2 LPM will be considered later. In spite of the low TMP the LRV does appear to increase with the decreasing sparging rate between 10 and 4 LPM, so this data was analysed statistically using an F-test. The null hypothesis was 'gassing rates from 10-4 LPM have the same log removal value for T4', and a significance level set to 5%. The results were 0.293 for the T4 phage and 0.066 for the MS-2 phage, which are both above the significance level, and therefore for both data sets we cannot reject the null hypothesis. Thus any correlation between the gassing rate and the LRV is not statistically significant for gassing rates between 10 and 4 LPM. As expected, the LRV for the T4 phage was much higher than that for MS-2, as any pore blocking effect of the biomass will make a greater difference for the larger phage.",

For both MS-2 and T4 the LRV varied with the time each sample was taken, and hence the larger standard deviation error bars for these data points. As described in Materials and methods, the reactor was operated at this sparging rate for 24 h before the first sample was taken, however, for the case at 2 LPM it appears that 24 h was not long enough to achieve stable rejection. For the MS-2 AnMBR the TMP rose dramatically in the first 12 h of operation from 1 kPa at 4 LPM to 65 kPa, but then settled down to 55 kPa for the remainder of operation at 2 LPM (data not shown); this decrease was most likely due to some settling of the biomass resulting in lower suspended biomass solids. The reactor was sampled again 48 h after the change in sparging rate, and the LRV was found to have increased further to 3.2, hence the larger errors bars for this data point in Fig. 2 . Since there was no further increase in TMP during the final 24 h of operation, this shows that phage removal in the AnMBR was not entirely dependent on TMP.",

With the exception of the 6 LPM data point the data set C falls within 1 standard deviation of data set B, thus demonstrating good reversibility (the standard deviation of each data point is represented by the error bars in the graph). This implies that, whatever phenomenon is causing phage removal, once it has occurred it is not affected by time. The removals observed here are significantly higher than those observed by Shang et al. in an aerobic MBR, who found a maximum log removal of 2.5. 2 However, they only operated for 20 days, and therefore with extended operation they may have achieved a similar value. In fact the removal falls into the same range as that found for the Q phage. 10 While these researchers used a different phage, Q , it is similar in size, behavior and morphology to the MS-2 phage, and therefore in good agreement with the data on extended operation. The different sparging rates had an effect on the TMP in the reactor, and therefore the phage rejections can also be analysed with respect to the TMP. From Fig. 9 , it can be seen that in the main, as the TMP is increased the LRV decreases, similarly to the data displayed in Figs 6 and 7, the trend observed here is the opposite to what was expected. This trend of increasing phage removal with decreasing TMP has not previously been observed in other work on phage removal in MBRs. In other work, phage removal has been shown to increase with an increase in TMP. 2, 9 In these other publications, however, the TMP was only shown to increase over time as the fouling layer built up, and no attempt was made to decrease the TMP after the fouling layer became established.",

This appears to contradict other authors who attribute phage removal to surface fouling; however, these authors only investigated increasing fouling rates rather than the subsequent fouling removal and TMP reduction as in this study. 2, 10, 11 The explanation for this trend in phage removal in the reactors after extended operation is unclear, however, Cui et al. reported that MBRs have demonstrated increased rejection at increased sparging rates for other compounds, and suggest that this is down to reduced concentration polarisation at the membrane surface for higher sparging rates. 17 The phage particles can be assumed to be the solute, and at low sparging rates the concentration at the surface of the membrane would increase and therefore there would be an increased concentration of phage in the effluent. At higher sparging rates the boundary layer would be reduced and the phage concentration at the membrane surface would be similar to that in the bulk so explaining the lower phage concentration in the effluent.",

To assess whether this occurred the reactor was spiked with phage and the concentration monitored over the course of 2 weeks. Figure 10 show that the phage concentration www.soci.org R Fox, David Stuckey decreased by approximately 2 logs over the course of 2 weeks, indicating that the phages were not propagating within the reactor, and that removal through adsorption to E. coli in the reactor was not occurring. The phage concentration actually decreases faster than the expected washout through the membrane determined in previous experiments, and this indicates that the anaerobic conditions in the reactor are slightly toxic to the phage causing inactivation to occur, and this could be due to the presence of specific solutes such as ammonia being present that are toxic to the phages. 14",
