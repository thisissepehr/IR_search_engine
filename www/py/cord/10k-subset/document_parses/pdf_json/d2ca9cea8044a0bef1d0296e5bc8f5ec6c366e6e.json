To recognize systematically periods of time in which there was a cluster of symptoms, we employed a method of episode analysis. To identify an episode, we first established a baseline level of symptoms for each individual; symptoms included were stuffiness, sneezing, runny nose, postnasal drip, sore throat, hoarseness, and cough. Episodes consisted of periods of two days or longer with symptoms greater than baseline and were separated from other episodes by two days or more of absent or reduced symptoms.

Although it was clear that rhinovirus infection had been prevented, the occurrence of background nasal symptoms, in part related to nasal spraying, made it difficult to assess the benefit of its use as perceived by a study participant. One means of doing so was to examine the characteristics of episodes of illness from which viral cultures were collected. The participants were encouraged to have such a culture obtained whenever they thought they had a respiratory illness. In collecting these spedmens, study staff did not attempt to distinguish between symptomatic periods that might be related to infection and those more likely to represent side effects of drug. Approximately the same numbers of cultures (79 in the IFN-a2b group and 80 in the placebo group) were collected. The symptoms associated with these episodes of illness, whether positive or negative for virus, were compared. Results are shown in table 3 for duration of episode of illness, 131 symptom score on the day of maximum severity of seven respiratory symptoms, and the maximum number of these symptoms reported on a single day of the episode. When all episodes were compared, duration of illness was somewhat shorter among the recipients of IFN-a2b, but not significantly so. The maximum severity, however, was significantly lower in the IFN-a2b group, as was the related measure, the maximum number of symptoms. Other methods of examining severity, including total symptom score during the episode, also exhibited similar significant differences. A similar analysis restricted to episodes in which a rhinovirus or parainfluenza virus was isolated is also shown in table 3. Because of the efficacy of IFN-a2b in preventing rhinovirus infection, there were only eight IFN-a2b-related episodes with isolation of rhinovirus as opposed to 28 episodes in the placebo group. None of these differences were significant. Parainfluenza infections, however, had not been prevented, and there was evidence of symptomatic effect in those infections that had occurred. Duration of illness for the IFN-a2b group was lower than that for the placebo group, but again the difference was not statistically significant.
