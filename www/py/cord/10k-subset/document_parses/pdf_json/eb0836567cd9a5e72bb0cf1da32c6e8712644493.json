Nutrients have marked influ ences on the gastrointestinal tract and manipulation of the diet provides clinicians with a powerful therapeutic strategy to be used alone or concurrently with drug therapy. During acute gastroenteritis a change from the animal's regular food to a diet containing novel protein sources minimizes the likelihood of acquired food allergies to the staple protein components of the diet. \"Feeding through\" diarrhea, a method used in human infants, has limited applicability in dogs and cats. The ideal diet for chronic small bowel-type diar rhea is highly digestible, gluten-free, hypoallergenic, isosmolar, low in fat and low in lactose. Dietary protein requirements increase in protein-losing enteropathy. Dietary fat is kept to a minimum during gastrointestinal dysfunction because malabsorbed fatty acids and bile acids cause secretory diarrhea. In diseases of the small bowel, it is traditional to use low fiber diets. This rec ommendation needs revision because the binding and gelling properties of fiber are of potential benefit in the treatment of small bowel diarrhea. High fiber diets are useful in most large bowel diseases. The specific fiber type used markedly influences the clinical result. J.",

In problems of acute onset, bowel rest is accomplished by completely restricting the oral intake of food. A bland diet is defined as being without coarse and spicy foods. Most canned commercial food could, therefore, be thought of as bland. One theoretical jus tification for not feeding a vomiting dog or cat its usual diet is the observation in humans that acquired food allergies to proteins eaten during acute gastroenteritis can delay recovery (Gryboski 1991 (Gryboski , lyngkaran et al. 1978 . There is clinical and gastroscopie food sensi tivity testing evidence to suggest that the same phe nomenon also occurs in the cat and dog.

Most au thorities recommend a bland diet even though there is little evidence to support the recommendation (Pemberton et al. 1988) . Milk, which was recom mended in the past as a buffering/coating agent, fell from favor because of concern about the stimulation of gastric acid secretion by the calcium and protein in milk (Pemberton et al. 1988 ). However, interest in milk feeding is now undergoing a resurgence because of evidence that intragastric administration of lipid emulsions improves the hydrophobicity of the gastric mucosal barrier (Lichtenberger 1993 ). Frequent small feedings may provide relief of clinical signs but have not been shown to hasten healing of the mucosa (Pem berton et al. 1988 ). Symptomatic relief is afforded by small meals because they produce minimal gastric dis tension (distension of the inflammed stomach causes nausea and vomiting). Liquidizing the diet will hasten gastric emptying, reducing gastric acid secretion. Minimizing the protein content of the food may also reduce gastric acid secretion.",

At first sight these observations might encour age veterinary clinicians to feed their diarrheic pa tients. Caution is required; however, before the triedand-true \"no food per os\" recommendation is aban doned in dogs and cats with diarrhea. Most of the studies showing beneficial effects of feeding through diarrhea were performed in humans affected by secre tory diarrheas because of toxigenic organisms such as cholera (Snyder et al. 1990 ). Feeding through was less successful in children with severe diarrhea or those with rotavirus infection (Snyder et al. 1990 ) that pro duces an osmotic diarrhea. Osmotic diarrheas because of viral infections (parvovirus, coronavirus, rotavirus, etc.) and dietary indiscretions are more common in dogs and cats than are secretory diarrheas. Further more, daily stooling frequency was increased in several studies of humans fed during diarrhea (Snyder et al. 1990 ). This may not be of major consequence to hu mans (provided duration of the diarrhea is not ex tended) but can be disastrous to the owner of a pet that is passing diarrhea in the house.

For instance, un like omnivorous animals, cats cannot upregulate in testinal sugar transporters when fed on high carbohydrate diets (Buddington et al. 1991) .

Certainly, for the first few weeks of treatment, there is no compelling reason to include carbohydrate in the diet of cats with diarrhea.

In spite of the reduced dietary fat content, daily energy intake must be sufficient to provide additional energy to support the formation of replacement protein. For this reason the diet is sometimes supplemented with mediumchain triglyc\u00c3\u00a9rides(MCTs). MCTs have theoretical advantages over long-chain triglyc\u00c3\u00a9rides (LCTs) for the treatment of gastrointestinal disease (Maliakkal et al. 1992) . In contrast to LCTs, considerable amounts of MCTs are directly absorbed without the need for hy drolysis or formation of micelles. The MCT that is hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipase is hydrolyzed more completely than LCT. The medium-chain fatty acids produced by hydrolysis are minimally reesterified in the enterocyte. Instead, they are absorbed directly into the portal circulation. The small quantity of MCT that is reesterified is incorporated into chylomicrons. The amount of MCT incorporated into chylomicrons in creases when the diet is high in MCTs or when MCTs are fed for prolonged periods (Swift et al. 1990 ). Thus, feeding of MCT oil, particularly in large quantities, is likely to increase lymph flow but not to the same de gree as LCT. MCTs are most commonly used in dogs and cats to increase the energy intake of animals with lymphangiectasia. Unfortunately, the ability to supply significant quantities of energy by MCTs is hampered by their potential to cause osmotic diarrhea and in app\u00c3\u00a9tence. MCT oils are ketogenic and should not be given to patients with ketosis or acidosis (Alpers 1989). They are poorly metabolized in hepatic cirrhosis and may accumulate in plasma.",

To minimize the likelihood of recur rence of clinical signs because of acquired sensitivity, the dietary protein source can be changed to a second novel protein source after the first 6 wk of therapy. This diet change is made just before the lowering of the prednisone dose from the immunosuppressive to the antiinflammatory range. By this time it is hoped that the immunosuppressive therapy will have signif icantly reduced the gastrointestinal inflammation and thereby improved the chances that oral tolerance to the second novel dietary protein source will be main tained.",

            "text": "Fecal incontinence is best treated with low fiber diets, whereas constipation can be prevented (but not treated) by high fiber diets. Dietary recommendations for the management of colitis are controversial. Low residue diets ), lamb and rice, and cottage cheese and rice have been successfully used as the sole management in many dogs. Other authors have recommended the use of fiber with some finding success with fermentable fibers such as psyllium (hemicellulose) and others preferring nonfermentable fibers such as bran (Simpson 1992) . I prefer a diet con taining moderate amounts of a highly digestible pro tein that is not included in the animal's usual diet (re duced colonie ammonia generation and low dietary antigenicity) in association with the addition of fer mentable fiber such as psyllium or soy fiber. The ben eficial effect of fermentable fibers (see Sunvold et al. 1994a , Sunvold et al. 1994b in this issue) probably relates to the generation of volatile fatty acids that nourish the colonie epithelium and discourage growth of pathogens. This hypothesis is supported by the ob servation that butyrate enemas are effective therapy for diversion colitis and distal ulcerative colitis in hu mans (Scheppach et al. 1992) . Furthermore, the salvage of fluid and electrolytes by the colon is closely asso ciated with the absorption of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) (Penn and Lebenthal 1990) , perhaps via SCFA-bicarbonate and sodium-hydrogen exchange mecha nisms (Eastwood 1992 ). In addition, butyrate and, to a lesser extent, other SCFA are the principal energy sources of colonocytes (Penn and Lebenthal 1990) . These SCFA have a trophic effect on the large bowel mucosa (Sakata 1987 , Reinhardt 1994 . Moreover, SCFA lower luminal pH which in turn encourages proliferation of anaerobic flora and discourages the growth of pathogens including Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella and pathogenic Escherichia coli (Brockett and Tanner 1982, Twedt 1993) .",
