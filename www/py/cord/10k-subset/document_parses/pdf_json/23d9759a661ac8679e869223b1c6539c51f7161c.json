Nucleic acid sequences related to the RD-114 genome are in the DNA of all domestic cats 5 -8. Thus these viral genomes are transmitted vertically from parent to offspring as integral components of cat cellular DNA. Although the family Felidae consists of closely related animals, only four Felis species have been found to contain RD-114-related sequences. These include the domestic cat, the European wildcat (F. sylvestris), the sand cat (F. margarita), and the jungle cat (F. chaus); other members of the Felidae lack nucleic acid sequences related to . The observation that RD-114 is partially related to the endogenous baboon type C viruses 10 -12 and that sequences related to RD-114 are found in the cellular DNA of all Old World monkeys led to the postulate that this group of viruses originated from an endogenous primate type C virus 13 transmitted horizontally to the germ line of ancestors of certain Felis species during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene somewhere in the region of the Mediterranean basin 9 \u2022 A second distinct group of type C viruses, the feline leukaemia viruses (FeL V), also has been isolated from domestic cats14.

The number of copies is determined by the ratio of the slope of each line to the slope of the line described by the reassociation of non-repetitive domestic cat cellular DNA (Cot, = 1,800-2,000; see also ref. 19 ).

The same cats were examined for FeLV-related genes using 3H-DNA probes prepared from various strains of FeLV22,23. No cross-hybridisation between these probes and RD-114 is detectable'5.24. The results parallel exactly the data obtained with transcripts of RD-114 RNA. The domestic cat parent contains multiple copies of FeLV-related virogenes whereas the leopard cat parent lacks these sequences. The F I hybrids contain half the number of copies. Backcrossed kitten No.1 has the same number of virogene copies as its parent (the F, hybrid) although its littermate has no detectable sequences related to FeL V. Table 1 summarises the hybridisation data; four clear classes of DNAs are evident. The first consists of animals that contain full complements of RD-114 and Fe LV-related gene sequences. These cats contain both sets of virogene sequences reiterated a comparable number of times, although there may be fewer FeLV-related copies. The animals in the second class, including all the F, hybrids and one of the backcrossed kittens, contain half the virogene complement of the RD+, FL + parents. A third class contains sequences that anneal to the viral probe with reassociation kinetics comparable with that seen for the association of the most slowly reannealing cellular DNA sequences and therefore probably contains one viral copy. This includes cloned heterologous cell lines producing high titres of either RD-114 or FeL V viruses. The fourth class completely lacks sequences related to either RD-114 or FeLV and includes the leopard cats and one of the backcrossed kittens. that each of the multiple copies of RD-1l4 or FeLV-related virogenes occurs on a different linkage group, as well as models of non-chromosomal inheritance of the mUltiple viral copies. Since only certain Felis species contain RD-1l4 and FeLVrelated sequences in their DNA, we propose that both classes of viruses were acquired by cats subsequent to their major radiation, most likely in the Pliocene, and that both sets of sequences have been perpetuated in the germ line 9 ,16. The mUltiple virogene copies presumably arose as a result of gene duplication and/or unequal crossing-over after infection. The presence of multiple copies of both sets of virogenes in cat cellular DNA seems to be a general property of endogenous mammalian type C viruses; mouse, rat, hamster, pig and baboon DNAs also contain similar numbers of copies of their respective endogenous viruses 19 \u2022 The genetic crosses described here provide a new approach to the study of the evolution of multiple gene systems. The virogene sequences can be considered as one of the group of moderately repetitive sequences such as the genes for 5S RNA26, histones 26 and feather keratin 20 \u2022 The existence of natural populations of animals that either lack or contain DNA sequences related to both RD-1l4 and FeLV, and the ability of these cats to interbreed permits the study of the physiological and potentially pathological role of each of these genetically transmitted gene sequences. Hybrid animals containing half the number of virogene copies and virogenenegative cats should allow the study of the effects of gene dose on susceptibility and resistance to diseases mediated by both groups of type C viruses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 360, "end": 362, "text": "19", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3367, "end": 3371, "text": "19 \u2022", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 140, "end": 148, "text": "(Fig. I)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1522, "end": 1529, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Identification of heat-dissociable RNA complexes in two porcine coronaviruses THE corona virus genome has been shown to comprise singlestranded RNAI\".
