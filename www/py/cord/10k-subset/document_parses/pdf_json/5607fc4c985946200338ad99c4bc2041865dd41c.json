Along with leukemic relapse [24, 77] and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) [21] , they represent one of the most common causes of death after BMT [12, 17] . In addition to bacterial pneumonia, infections are often observed which are caused by opportunistic pathogens, viruses, fungi and protozoa [40, 43] . Interstitial idiopathic pneumonia (IP), where the infectious agent cannot be identified with certainty, occur particularly frequently after high radiation doses ( > 8Gy), singledose total-body irradiation and high dosage rates [6, 11, 65] . Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [17] and the related capillary leak syn-drome [57] can be caused, among other factors [14] , by sepsis during granulocytopenia, by histoincompatibility between donor and recipient, and by treatment with cyclosporin A. Obstructive bronchiolitis is frequently correlated with chronic GvHD and has not yet been etiologically classified [5, 36, 37, 50] .",

A total of 69 patients received bone marrow from siblings who were completely matched in the HLA-A, B, C, DR system and had negative mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC). In one instance, the patient's mother fulfilled these prerequisites and served as donor (patient no. 4). One patient (no. 2) received marrow from a donor who was identical only in one haplotype.

The neuroblastoma patients (nos. 50, 66) received 30 mg melphalan twice intravenously. After that, 35 of these patients were administered a total-body irradiation of 10 Gy from a linear accelerator at a dose rate of 7 cGy/min (patients l, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10-12, 14, 17-30, 32-35, 37, 38, 42, 44, 45, 47-49) . The lung dose was limited to 8 Gy. Twenty-one patients with leukemia were given a fractionated total-body irradia- anti-human-T-cell globulin [51] tion of 6 x 2 Gy or 5 x 2.5 Gy, with a maximal lung dose of 10 Gy. From patient 38 on, the radiation dose of the ribs was saturated to 10 Gy with supplementary electron irradiation. For immune suppression 15 patients with SAA each received 50 mg cyclophosphamide/kg body weight on 4 consecutive days, followed by a total-body irradiation with 3 Gy in 6 patients, screening the lung completely. One patient (no. 2) was treated intravenously four times with antithymocytoglobulin for immune suppression, whilst the other SAA patients received buffy coat transfusions from their donors after BMT [60] . The bone marrow was filtered to produce a single-cell suspension; it was incubated with anti-human-T-cell-globulin beforehand, if the cell count was above 2 x 108 mononuclear cells/kg [51] . All patients were decontaminated enterally and topically to prevent infections.

Typical radiological and histological findings are depicted in Fig. 3 a and b . Three patients (nos. 9, 11, 47) contracted a fatal VZV pneumonia following a typical herpes zoster generalisatus. Clinically, all of the patients had high fever, rapidly increasing dyspnea and a slight dry cough. Usually, only a few nonspecific tales and sharper breath sounds could be auscultated. An attempt to treat CMV pneumonia with acyclovir and anti-CMVhyperimmune serum proved as unsuccessful as the attempted treatment of VZV pneumonia (patient no. 11) with c~-interferon. All of the patients but one (no. 47) were administered artificial respiration because of rapidly progressing global respiratory :insufficiency, at the end with Oz concentrations of over 60% and positive respiration pressures of up to 60 cm H20. Four patients (nos. 9, 12, 28, 38) also had an obstructive bronchiolitis (see below page 605), which made mechanical respiration considerably more difficult because lung and cutaneous emphysemas and pneumothorax developed (Fig. 5a) .",

Patients who were transplanted in advanced leukemic relapse or, with SAA, in a poor general condition all died of pneumonia [70] . Granulocytopenia meant a significantly higher risk of death for patients who contracted bacterial or mycotic pneumonia or ARDS during this phase. The poor results and the similar experience of other centers [61] were among the reasons that prompted us to carry out BMT for leukemia only on patients in complete remission and in a good physical condition [10, 62] . After this, there were no more cases of early death from bacterial pneumonia, results which correspond with the observations of Winston et al. [74] . Other important factors were the early administration of broadspectrum antibiotic combination therapy [62, 74] to patients with temperatures over 38.5 \u00b0 C, as well [15, 16] . In addition, the use of cyclosporin A for prophylaxis of GvHD brought about an earlier rise in the number of granulocytes and less mucosal damage, which meant less bacterial penetration from the gastrointestinal tract than with the methotrexate used earlier. It was striking that bacterial pneumonias during granulocytopenia were extremely difficult to recognize on the radiograms. Only after granulocyte transfusions or during granulocyte regeneration did the typical pulmonary infiltrates appear, making diagnosis possible. The same observation was made by Karp et al. [31] . When our patients without G v H D became ill after the granulocytopenic phase, gram-positive cocci could sometimes be identified, but often no pathogens were found at all. At a later stage after BMT, two patients with extensive chronic G v H D repeatedly contracted pneumonia caused by the same gram-negative organism, so we must assume a latent bacterial infection even after the patients were clinically cured. The impaired immune regulation accompanying chronic G v H D facilitates the reactivation of these infections [2--4, 54]. Chronic G v H D was also correlated significantly with recurrent pulmonary infections in our patients, as has been reported by others [4] .",

Without granulocytes homogenous, opaque infiltrates appeared on the radiograms and spread over both lungs within 1-2 days. Both patients died soon afterwards. The two Aspergillus pneumonias that ap-peared when the granulocyte levels were normal began as soft, spotty infiltrates, which slowly increased in size, and some of these infiltrates developed into pulmonary cavities. The antimycotic therapy described caused the infiltrates to recede and led to the absence of clinical symptoms in both of these patients. It was only possible to diagnose these four patients histologically, in two cases after transbronchial lung biopsies and in two cases after post-mortem examination. In none of these patients was it possible to find the initial focus. Other centers have had similar experiences [67, 72] . Because the paranasal sinuses are suspected to be the initial focus, Watson [67] recommended irrigation before BMT whenever the sinuses display radiological abnormalities. The bad prognosis with Aspergillus pneumonia makes prompt antimycotic therapy with amphotericin B advisable whenever lung infiltrates continue to increase despite treatment with antibiotics. Furthermore, we emphasize the need for fiber-optic bronchoscopy with bronchial lavage and transbronchial lung biopsies in these patients. A marked reduction in invasive Aspergitlus infections can be attained by using filtered air with HEPA recirculation filters in sickrooms [67] . We did use these, but our patients stayed at most 6 weeks in the laminar air-flow system with filtered air.",

Other centers report similar results, with 60%-90% mortality after CMV pneumonia [40, 67] as well as a higher risk for older patients. The pathogenesis of CMV pneumonia after BMT, which can appear in a miliary and a diffuse form [8] , is the subject of controversy. The first form might result from hematogenous dissemination into the lung from an extrapulmonary source; the second form possibly develops from the gradual spread or the activation of an endogenous intrapulmonary virus [8] . Our histological and clinical findings fit better with the miliary form, although in some patients only a few of the typical owl's-eye cells were present.",

            "text": "It is generally believed that CMV-infected patients usually succumb to their infections after BMT if they are not able to develop CMV-specific cytotoxicity, but only a nonspecific, natural and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity [46] . Like the GvHD reaction [3, 23, 27] , CMV infections cause a reversal of the ratio of helper (OKT 4 +) to suppressor (OKT 8 +) T-cells, with an absolute decline in the number of helper T-cells. In all of our patients with CMV or VZV pneumonia, this reversed ratio was likewise present, with a marked reduction of helper cells. The NK cells or their precursors (Leu 7 +) were reduced in five patients. Activated NK cells (HLA-DP+/DR +) in the blood made up 6%-48%, whereas B-cells were absent or extremely reduced in six patients. This considerable drop in helper cells noted in our cases prevented a specific immune response to viral antigens. Besides, NK cells or their precursors differentiated only partially to activated T-cells, as assessed on the basis of their HLA-DR/DP positivity. It is conceivable that this differentiation defect stems from the absence of the interleukin 2 normally produced in sufficient quantities by the helper cells [68] , which are reduced here. In addition, a humoral immune response was not possible in several patients because of the absence of B-cells. This impaired immune regulation could be caused by the suppressive effect of the GvHD present in all of the patients [3, 22, 53] , by the GvHD therapy often carried out, or by the virus infection itself [30, 33, 39, 53, 64] , all conditions allowing the diseases to spread rapidly and lead to death.",

Since no means of successfully treating CMV infections exist at present [41, 66, 75] , the effective prophylaxis provided by anti-CMV hyperimmune globulin becomes all the more important [19, 34, 42, 71, 75] . In our own experience, CMV pneumonias can be prevented for as long as prophylactic measures are being taken. However, some questions remain to be answered. Which minimum globulin dose is sufficient in view of the high costs?

In addition, the earlier cytostatic therapy for leukemia could damage the lungs severely [18] and encourage the development of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia after total-body irradiation. The reason for our low incidence of IP is very likely the low irradiation dose rate (7 cGy/min) [7, 11, 49, 63] , the restriction of the lung dose to 8 Gy with single-dose or 10 Gy with fractionated total-body irradiation [6, 32, 56, 63] and the use of fractionated irradiation [26, 56, 65] .",

It is conceivable that it is encouraged by endothelial damage to the pulmonary vessels from total-body irradiation [59, 73] and the activation of complement by granulocyte transfusions [31] . Radiograms sometimes showed diffuse, opaque infiltrates, but more often revealed spotty, relatively well-defined infiltrates of varying intensity.

These findings agreed regarding a correlation with chronic GvHD, the gradual clinical onset with dyspnea on exertion and with coughing, the decrease in vital capacity and increase in residual volume, airway obstruction, increasing emphysema and recurrent pneumothorax and, in the advanced stage, cutaneous or mediastinal emphysemas. Histological studies similarly revealed fibrosis and a patchy scattering of bronchiolitis obliterans with peribronchial infiltrates, but no lymphocytic bronchitis [13] . Other authors have described a distal, mixed inflammatory reaction and fibrosis, diffuse alveolar damage with exudative and organizing components, intra-alveolar fibrin deposits and isolated hyaline membranes in some patients, and lymphocytic infiltrates around the terminal bronchiolus with necroses of the bronchiolar epithelium in others [29, 47] . In further reports, one can read of a reduction in the number of alveolar sacs, bronchioli filled with macrophages, focal obliteration of the bronchiolar walls, atelectasis, emphysema, and interstitial fibrosis, but there is no evidence concerning lymphocytic bronchitis or bronchiolitis [36, 50] . The presence of lymphocytic infiltrates is important because Beschorner et al. [8] have interpreted them as evidence of acute bronchial GvHD, although this has been contradicted [44] and the infiltrates have instead been viewed as a nonspecific inflammatory reaction. There was no sign of lymphocytic bronchitis in our five patients. It is unclear what role GvHD plays in the pathogenesis of obstructive bronchiolitis, but the fact that it only appears during GvHD, and chiefly only in its chronic form, suggests a causal involvement. The following factors are held to be ultimately responsible: a low IgA level with a subsequent lack of mucous membrane protection by the secretory immune system, damage to the mucociliary apparatus by the GvHD-associated Sicca syndrome [54] , and a general reduction in the humoral and cellular immune reaction [47, 76] . Therapy with prednisolone did not improve the condition of the three patients with the most severe clinical symptoms, nor did the use of spasmolytics, bronchodilators, mucolytics or antibiotics. Other authors have reported marked subjective and (sometimes) objective improvement, especially when prednisolone was administered as soon as the first symptoms appeared [29, 47] . Thus, it is advisable to monitor lung function in GvHD patients regularly and, if necessary, to begin prednisolone therapy at the first sign of a bronchiolar obstruction.",

Diffusion capacity dropped in our patients somewhat, but not significantly, in contrast to other studies [20, 58] . However, if only the leukemia patients are considered, as in the two studies just cited, then the DLCO reduction in our patients was also statistically significant (data not shown).",

Some of the predisposing factors are known and must be combated with intensive prophylactic measures, because the therapeutic possibilities are often limited. The prevention of chronic GvHD, which is almost always the basis for viral pneumonias, obstructive bronchiolitis and recurring pneumonias, is of vital importance. Bacterial pneumonias can be reduced by shortening the duration of granulocytopenia and fungal pneumonias by painstaking prevention of exposure and accurate diagnosis. It is possible to reduce the risk of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia by adjusting radiation techniques, but efforts should be directed toward lessening its frequency even further because of the high mortality rate.",
