This prospective study analyzed long-term patient survival in 132 consecutive HIV+ patients with ESRD who were placed on the wait list with the intent for kidney transplantation during February 2001 and December 2006; 65 received kidney transplantation and 67 patients on the wait list continued dialysis treatment due to non availability of kidneys.The selection criteria for waitlist placement included maintenance on HAART, plasma HIV1RNA < 50 copies and absolute CD4 count of \u2265 200 cells per mm 3 of blood. Primary end point was patient death. Patient demography was comparable in transplant and dialysis groups.

Methods: In a 2-year open-label, prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter study, 340 planned patients maintained on MMF and a CNI were randomized 30-90 days after transplantation to receive MMF (1-1.5 g BID) plus SRL (2-4 mg/day; trough 5-10 ng/ mL) and discontinue the CNI (MMF/SRL group) or continue their current regimen (MMF/CNI group). Antibody induction and/or corticosteroids were administered according to individual center practice. Primary efficacy variables included the percent of patients with biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR), graft loss, and death, and mean percent change in calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR; MDRD-6 equation) at month 12. BPAR was assessed by Banff grade and Rejection Activity Index (RAI). Safety outcomes included incidence of adverse events, malignancies, and opportunistic infections at months 12 and 24. Results: Interim 12-month data from 276 patients (MMF/SRL, n=139; MMF/CNI, n=137) were analyzed; baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Mean time from transplant to randomization was 54 days in the MMF/SRL and 52 days in the MMF/CNI groups.

The impact of these regimens on HCV recurrence and severity will be presented. 31% of patients in the MMF/SRL vs. 15% in the MMF/CNI group withdrew for safety reasons.

The proportion of patients with CMV events, including serious adverse events and laboratory evidence of CMV infection, has remained low and broadly similar following introduction of CC administration of evl and use of concomitant RD-CsA. CMV syndrome and CMV organ involvement occurred in <3% of recipients receiving evl in each of the studies. The highest rates of all CMV parameters occurred with MMF + SD-CsA or AZA + SD-CsA. Conclusion. The low incidence of CMV infection and CMV-related events observed in heart tx patients receiving FD-evl and SD-CsA as de novo immunosuppression has been maintained in newer regimens of CC-evl with RD-CsA. CMV syndrome and CMV organ involvement are rare with evl-based immunosuppression after cardiac tx. The low rate of CMV infections in evl-treated patients may contribute to improved long-term outcome and a lower incidence of CAV; confirmatory data are awaited.",

            "text": "Expression of endothelial fibronectin (FN) is an early event in liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. We have recently shown that CS1 peptide facilitated blockade of FN-\u03b14\u03b21 leukocyte interactions regulates metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression in steatotic orthotopic liver transplants (OLT). This study tests the function of the CS1 peptide therapy upon MMP-9, and further dissects putative mechanisms, in an alternate model of cold Ischemia/Reperfusion (I/R) Injury. Methods and Results: CS1 peptides were administrated through the portal vein of Sprage-Dawley (SD) rat livers before and after 24 h cold storage (500 \u00b5g/rat). SD recipients of OLTs received an additional dose of CS1 peptides 1h post-OLT. CS1 therapy significantly increased the 14d OLT survival rate (100% vs. 50%, n=8/gr, p<0.005). CS1 peptides reduced sGOT levels (U/L) at 6h (1413\u00b1420 vs. 2866\u00b1864 p<0.008) and 24h (1350\u00b1142 vs. 4000\u00b11358, p<0.006) post-OLT. CS1 treated OLTs showed good preservation of lobular architecture, contrasting with severe necrosis and sinusoidal congestion in controls. Moreover, CS1 treated livers were characterized by a profound decrease in T (31\u00b13 vs. 64\u00b18, p<0.0002), NK (19\u00b12 vs. 41\u00b13, p<0 .0003) and ED1 (21\u00b17 vs. 57\u00b116, p<0.008) cells as early as 6h after I/R. Neutrophils, as indicated by MPO activity (0.48\u00b10.02 vs. 3.18\u00b10.94, p<0.02) were depressed by CS1 therapy. This correlated with decreased mRNA expression of TNF-\u03b1 (0.032\u00b10.04 vs. 0.83\u00b10.26, p<0.005) and cycloxygenase-2 (0.8\u00b10.1 vs. 2.2\u00b10. 6, p<0.05) . Leukocyte transmigration is dependent upon adhesive and focal matrix degradation mechanisms. MMP-9, which is inducible and expressed by infiltrating leukocytes, was profoundly depressed in 6h CS-1 peptide treated OLTs, at both mRNA (0.1\u00b10.1 vs. 0.5\u00b10.2, p<0.03) and protein (0.15\u00b10.07 vs. 0.7\u00b10.14, p<0.03) levels. Moreover, MMP-9 activity evaluated by zymography was reduced by \u223c3-fold in the CS-1 group. Interestingly, phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase p38 (0.05\u00b10.01 vs 0.14\u00b10.06, p<0.03) was selectively downregulated in the 6h CS-1 treated OLTs. In conclusion, this work supports a broad regulatory role for FN-\u03b14\u03b21 interactions on MMP-9 expression by leukocytes, likely mediated through activation of p38 MAPKinase, and matrix pathological breakdown associated with leukocyte infiltration. This data provides the rationale for the development of novel therapeutic approaches in cold liver I/R injury.",

            "text": "Ischemia reperfusion injury is the most common cause of acute kidney injury in both native and allograft kidneys. The pathogenic mechanisms of renal ischemia reperfusion injury include changes at the level of the microvasculature as well as the tubules. Within the microvasculature, leukocyte-endothelial interactions likely play a role and contribute to the well-established microvasculature dysfunction (e.g., endothelial permeability) and alterations in endothelial-leukocyte interaction occur during ischemic acute kidney injury. Our previous studies have demonstrated that T cells modulate renal ischemia reperfusion injury in a murine model, we hypothesized that T cells could mediate changes in renal vascular permeability during ischemia reperfusion injury. We performed a 30 min bilateral renal ischemia followed by reperfusion in C57BL6 wild type mice and in T cell deficient (nu/nu) mice with or without T-cell adoptive transfer from their wild type littermates and evaluated RVP by Evans blue dye extravasations (EBDE). The time course studies of RVP showed marked increases in renal EBDE within the early 3-6 hrs after ischemia. CD3 positive pan T-cells but neither CD4 nor CD8 T cells were found to infiltrate into post ischemic kidney within 6 hrs, and comparison was made with other leukocytes using immunohistochemistry technique. Gene microarray analysis demonstrated that the gene for TNF-\u03b1 (Tnfaip1), a potent mediator of microvascular permeability as well as a T cell product, was increased in the kidney early after ischemia. TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 protein by an intracellular cytokine staining technique was found increased early in peripheral circulating T cells and later in renal T cells after renal ischemia. The rise in RVP was significantly attenuated in T cell deficient mice nu/nu at 6 hrs compared to the wild type littermates and this attenuated RVP in T cell deficient mice was restored after adoptive transfer of splenic T cells from wild type littermates into these nude mice. These data demonstrate that T cells traffic early into post ischemic kidney, produce TNF-\u03b1 and other cytokines that can increase RVP, and directly participate in the increased RVP during acute ischemia reperfusion injury. T cell-endothelial interactions are a likely mechanisms underlying the pathophysiologic role of T cells in renal ischemia reperfusion injury . Background: Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major cause of organ dysfunction after intestinal injury and transplantation. The interaction between the innate and adaptive immune systems has become a major area of focus in this field. Our preliminary work showed that mice undergoing intestinal IRI experienced worse survival and tissue injury in conjunction with increased infiltration of PMN and CD3+ cells as compared to sham mice. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the T cell in intestinal IRI through the use of genetically deficient mice.",

Separate survival and analysis groups were performed. Intestinal tissue was harvested at 4h and 24h. Tissue was analyzed by histology, CD3 immunostaining, myeloperoxidase activity (MPO), and semi-quantitative PCR for several cytokines/chemokines. Results: WT had significantly worse survival compared to CD4KO (30% vs. 100%, p=0.002), and worse histopathological injury mostly involving mucosal sloughing. WT had higher MPO activity than CD4KO (1.9\u00b10.88 vs. 0.70\u00b10.73 at 4h, p=0.059, and 1.5\u00b10.05 vs. 0.22\u00b10.065 at 24h, p=0.004) and increased CD3+ cell infiltration. There was also increased mRNA production of cytokines/chemokines in WT vs. CD4KO at both timepoints; specifically, the data with respect to B-actin at 24h was: IL-2 (0. Conclusion: This study demonstrates for the first time in the intestine that CD4+ T cells are important mediators of IRI. In the absence of CD4+ T cells, better outcomes were associated with less PMN infiltration implying a link between the innate and adaptive immune systems. An alteration in chemotactic signaling potentially effected by CD4+ T cells may play a role in this process. These results confirm the important function of CD4+ T cells in intestinal IRI and justify further investigation into their complex role in this process.",

            "text": "Messenger RNA assessment in urine sediments from renal transplant patients is rapidly evolving as a non-invasive diagnostic tool. T cells, macrophages, and often B cells are present in rejecting kidney grafts. We questioned whether urinary mRNA levels of markers representing these cell types ((regulatory) T cells: CD3\u03b5, FoxP3, CD25, TGF-\u00df; macrophages: CD68, S100A9; B cells: CD20) are associated with rejection. MATERIALS In our institute 520 urine samples a year from over 100 renal transplant patients are being collected for mRNA quantitation purposes. Urine sediments are pelleted and stored in RNA-preserving solution. We initially investigated the effect of incubation time of urine on mRNA integrity. Next, in a case-control study 17 urine samples taken at time of biopsy-proven rejection were compared to 17 samples taken during stable graft function. Median time of sampling (55 days versus 43 days posttansplant) did not significantly differ between groups. RNA (0.90 \u00b1 1.18 \u00b5g) was extracted using RNeasy spin columns. Message of the markers mentioned above was quantified with Q-PCR and normalized. RESULTS Incubation of urine for 7h or longer at room temperature after acquisition resulted in a 75% decrease in 18S rRNA signals (P<0.05). However, storage of urine for up to 24h at 4\u00baC did not result in decreased mRNA expression. In the case-control study, all markers tested showed the highest expression levels in urine rejection samples. When corrected for multiple comparisons, only TGF-\u00df (26-fold, P=0.007) and FoxP3 (21-fold, P=0.002) expression was significantly increased in rejection samples compared to non-rejection samples. TGF-\u00df levels highly correlated with FoxP3 levels (r = 0.90, P<0.00001), suggesting a mechanistic relationship in vivo between the two molecules. CONCLUSION RNA integrity in urine samples stored at 4\u00baC is maintained for at least 24h. Detection of increased TGF-\u00df and FoxP3 message in urine from patients with a kidney transplant represents a means for indicating occurrence of graft rejection. This implies that mRNA urinalysis renders a suitable molecular tool for non-invasive patient monitoring in clinical practice. The data furthermore suggest that rejection is associated with TGF-\u00df-mediated immune mechanisms in which regulatory T cells play a role. The significance of B cell and plasma cell infiltration in renal allografts remains controversial. We previously established that transcript sets associated with Ifng effects or T cells reflect the inflammatory burden in renal allografts. In the present study, we identified B cell associated transcripts (BATs) and immunoglobulin transcripts (IGTs), reflecting B cell and plasma cell infiltration, respectively. Using microarrays, we analyzed BAT and IGT expression in relationship to histologic lesions, diagnosis, and renal function in 177 renal allograft biopsies. Immunostaining confirmed that BAT and IGT expression was associated with B cells and plasma cells in the graft. Expression of BATs and IGTs was increased in biopsies with rejection (1.2 \u00b1 0.2, 1.6 \u00b1 0.9) compared to non-rejection (1.1 \u00b1 0.2, 1.1 \u00b1 0.5), but was not different between T cell (1.3 \u00b1 0.3, 1.5 \u00b1 1.1) and antibody mediated rejection (1.2 \u00b1 0.2, 1.5 \u00b1 0.9) and also occurred in some non-rejecting biopsies (recurrent GN). BAT and IGT scores correlated strongly with time post transplant (Fig1), which was best modeled as a dichotomous relationship: biopsies \u2264 5 months did not express BATs or IGTs above the level of control kidneys. Other inflammatory markers were not time dependent. In biopsies \u2265 5 months, BAT and IGT expression correlated with interstitial inflammation, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis. In a multiple regression analysis, only time post transplant and interstitial inflammation were independently related to BAT and IGT scores. When correcting for time post transplant, BAT and IGT scores did not correlate with renal function at the time of biopsy or future function 6 months post biopsy. BATs and particularly IGTs are a time dependent feature of injured and inflamed renal allografts. Corrected for the effect of time, BATs and IGTs do not correlate with outcomes, indicating that B cell and plasma cell infiltrates have no specific role for the mechanism of injury independent of the inflammatory burden. Their accumulation in late allografts may indicate emergence of specialized lymphoid compartments in tissues with long standing low level inflammation.",

Kwan Tae Park, 1 Song Chul Kim, 1 Duck Jong Han. 1 1 Surgery, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. Accelerated rejection can be developed in the immediate post-transplant period resulting from anamnestic response due to the exposure to fetal HLA antigen during the previous pregnancy in case of offspring-to-mother or husband-to-wife. However, accelerated rejections in these groups have been rarely reported. 81 cases of offspring-to-mother (Offspring group) and 53 cases of husband-to-wife (Spouse group), who has been sensitized to spouse via their children, underwent kidney transplants from January of 1997 to August of 2007 at our institution and retrospectively reviewed. Control group was female kidney recipients transplanted at the same period from living related donors other than offspring and from living unrelated donors other than husband. Acute rejection (AR) rate within 3 months after transplant were 19.7% (16/81) in offspring group and 18.8% (10/53) in spouse group. The AR rates were not different between the two groups, however they were significantly higher than control group in both groups, namely 10.2% (24/235) for offspring control and 13.5% (10/74) for spouse control. The mean onset of AR was 7.5 day (0-29) and it was significantly later than that of control groups (16.5 day, p<0.05) and 54% of AR were accelerated rejections within 7 days after transplant. Proportion of acute humoral rejection was significantly higher in both groups than control group (37.5% vs 8.3% in offspring group, 60% vs 10% in spouse group). Most of the AR was successfully reversed by steroid pulse and/ or plasmapheresis, IVIG, rituximab. Any risk factors for the AR such as number of pregnancy, preoperative CDC cross matching, PRA, immunosuppressant and antibody induction couldn't be identified. Serum creatinine level in AR patients were higher than AR free patients by postoperative 1 month, but last follow up creatinine level didn't show any statistical difference (1.43 mg/dl in AR vs 1.14mg/dl in AR free). 5 year graft/patient survival rate were not different between AR and AR free groups and study and control groups. Risk of higher rejection rate accompanied with higher accelerated and humoral rejection was identified in female kidney recipients from offspring or spouse donor in comparison with control group. Considering the anamnestic response of this cohort of female recipients, more prudent preoperative screening and careful immediate postoperative immune monitoring are required for the avoidance of rejection and impaired graft survival. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that \u2206UPC > 0.2 were associated with decreased patient and allograft survival.",

Assessing infiltration by histology is arbitrary, limited in reproducibility, and has never been assessed against independent standards. We recently reported that a set of cytotoxic T cell-associated transcripts (QCATs) could quantitatively assess the T cell burden in tissue. Objective of the present study was to re-examine the current diagnostic criteria in relationship to the QCATs. In 129 renal allograft biopsies, we assessed how histology predicts the QCAT burden. An independent diagnostic threshold for QCATs was established in control samples. Applying this QCAT threshold revealed current diagnostic criteria for histology to be flawed; the threshold for interstitial infiltration is too high (100% specificity, 37% sensitivity), the types of infiltration to be considered (i.e. i-Banff) are wrongly defined, and tubulitis is not increasing diagnostic accuracy. Changing the criteria by lowering the histological threshold for cortical infiltration from 25% to 10%, taking into account all interstitial cellular infiltration (= i-total) and ignoring tubulitis increased sensitivity to 91% with a decreased specificity of 50%. But, this includes biopsies having interstitial infiltration without QCATs, indicating that histology might not discriminate between 'active' and 'inactive' infiltration. Both the refined histological and the QCAT threshold had prognostic value in terms of future renal allograft function. We propose a refined histological scoring system that better predicts the active T cell burden and outcome than the current Banff criteria for renal allograft rejection.",

The collective evidence suggests, however, that kidney donors enjoy a normal life span and their lifetime risk of ESRD may not be different from non-kidney donors. Assessing kidney function utilizing serum creatinine is not without limitations. Therefore, to better assess kidney function, 5 yeas ago, we began a large effort to measure GFR using the plasma disappearance of iohexol and first void urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in randomly selected kidney donors who donated at our institution. Results: We have performed over 3600 donor uninephrectomies since the inception of our program in 1963. Of these, 242 donors underwent iohexol GFR at our General Clinical Research Center. Microalbuminuria is defined as ACR between 30-300mg/g and macroalbuminuria as ACR>300mg/g. The mean age was 53.0\u00b19.6 years, 11.9\u00b18.8 years have elapsed since donation, hemoglobin was 13.7\u00b11.23g/L, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 121.7\u00b114.7mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 73.2\u00b19.1mmHg. 82.6% of donors had a GFR greater than 60ml/min/1.73m 2 and 17.4% had a GFR between 30-60ml/min/1.73m 2 . The detailed renal profile of these donors is shown in the table below. Multivariate analysis that adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, time from donation, SBP, DBP and body mass index (BMI) identified age at donation, female gender and BMI as independent predictors for GFR<60mL/min/1.73m 2 and time from donation and systolic blood pressure as independent predictors for micro and macroalbuminuria. Conclusion: This is the largest effort describing measured GFR in previous kidney donors. It is reassuring to find out that the majorities have a preserved GFR and only a minority has albuminuria. The risk factors for reduced GFR and albuminuria are analogous to what has been described in the general population.",

Unfortunately, this issue has been neglected to a large extent. We sought to examine the current practices regarding psychosocial follow-up of LKDs after surgery across transplant (Tx) centers. We conducted a 68-question online survey regarding this practice and issues related to LKD. The survey was e-mailed via listservs of 2 professional Tx societies. Several questions allowed for more than one response. Characteristics of the 69 Tx centers that participated in the survey are found in Table  1 . Only 38.3% actively follow donors regarding mental health, substance abuse, or quality of life issues after donation. The professionals most often involved are social workers (72%) and nurse coordinators (69%). The majority of follow-up is conducted via phone (83.3%); though appointments (69.4%) and questionnaires (11.1%) are also utilized. 65% initiate follow-up with donors 1-4 weeks post-operatively, whereas only 27% of programs maintain contact at both 3-6 months and 12 months. 83.3% offer post-operative psychosocial support; 62% only under certain circumstances. This support is provided by social workers (90%), psychologists (30%), and/or psychiatrists (28%). Support is available indefinitely in 68% of programs. 30.5% assume the costs of post-operative medical and psychosocial care indefinitely; 50.8% for a specified period of time. 40.7% bill the recipient's insurance and 15.2% bill the donor's insurance. 83.1% of centers accept donors without health insurance and only 5.1% purchase insurance on behalf of donors to cover post-operative health care needs. The results of this survey clearly demonstrate that post-operative psychosocial follow-up of LKDs is uncommon and that current practices are widely variable. Without routine follow-up of donors, Tx centers are less likely to capture post-operative psychosocial issues that may result from organ donation. Standardized post-operative follow-up of LKDs should become a mandatory part of their care, which will require increased support from health care policy makers.",

Kim. 4 1 Gastroenterology, Henry Ford Health Systems, Detroit, MI; 2 Nephrology, Henry Ford Health Systems, Detroit, MI; 3 Biostatistics, Henry Ford Health Systems, Detroit, MI; 4 Transplant Institute, Henry Ford Health Systems, Detroit, MI. The influence of hepatitis C (HCV) and race are not well understood in combined kidney-liver transplant (KLT). HCV has a negative impact on patient and graft survival in liver recipients whereas African-American (AA) race is a negative prognostic factor in kidney recipients. AIM: To determine the influence of HCV and AA race on patient and graft survival in KLT. METHODS: The UNOS Public Use Database was used to identify 2296 patients undergoing KLT who had known HCV Ab status. 13% were AA and 68% were non-Hispanic white (NHW). 39.5% were HCV Ab positive. Groups were assessed for patient and graft survival. RESULTS: There is a significant gradient in patient survival and both kidney and liver survival from NHW patients without HCV to AA patients with HCV (Table) . The patient survival at five years drops from 72% to 54% along this gradient. There is also a 14% drop in liver and an 18% drop in kidney graft survival. On pairwise testing, the difference in patient survival at 5 yr between all patients without HCV and those HCV Ab positive drops from 72% to 60% (p=0.0003). The difference in 5 yr survival between all NHW and AA patients (regardless of HCV status) drops from 68% to 57% (p=0.221). On multivariate analysis, HCV and the combination of HCV and AA race remains associated with diminished survival but race alone does not. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HCV who undergo a KLT transplant are at increased risk for poor overall survival and poor survival of kidney and liver grafts. This effect appears even more pronounced in AA patients. This knowledge is critical to individual centers in assessing risk and benefit from KLT in these groups and these groups represent an opportunity for improved interventions.",

Studies show that calcineurin inhibitors and steroids can be individually avoided in pediatric renal transplantation. Building on that experience we designed this study to optimize short and long-term renal allograft function with minimal chronic immunosuppression using a steroid-free, calcineurininhibitor withdrawal protocol in low risk pediatric renal transplant recipients. Methods: Unsensitized pediatric recipients of a first living donor kidney transplant received 2 doses of Campath-1H \u00ae (0.3 mg/kg), 1 day pre-and post-transplant. Subjects received tacrolimus and MMF immediately post-transplant until week 8-12 when they underwent protocol renal biopsy and were changed to sirolimus and MMF if rejection free. The planned 35 subjects have been enrolled; this report describes the clinical outcomes of the 23 with 1 year of follow up. Results: The mean subject age is 12.9 yrs; 59.3% are female and 70.4% Caucasian. At transplant, 16/23 were CMV seronegative and 16/23 were EBV seronegative. Protocol therapy was discontinued in eight subjects due to: rejection (3), mouth ulcers (2), leukopenia (1) , unrelated (2). Clinical acute rejection (AR) occurred in 4 subjects (17%) and 2 had subclinical AR; AR was cellular rejection in 5 subjects, and humoral in 1 at 4 days post-transplant who had an undetected positive crossmatch to Class II HLA. There were two graft losses, one due to recurrent FSGS and one due to medication non-adherence. There were no cases of PTLD and no deaths. Leukopenia occurred in 11 subjects (47.8%). There were 9 infections of which 7 were urinary tract infections (34.7%) and 2 were pneumonia (8.7%). Conclusions: Minimization of immunosuppression using a steroid-free, calcineurinwithdrawal protocol in low risk pediatric renal transplant recipients appears to be well tolerated with acceptable rates of clinical AR and no serious infections 12 months after transplantation.",

Purpose: To examine outcomes in pediatric kidney recipients who transition to an adult transplant program and to identify characteristics associated with non-adherence related graft loss. Methods: Retrospective, single center analysis of 41 pediatric kidney recipients who transitioned to an adult program. Results: For the cohort overall, transition to the adult program occurred a mean of 82 \u00b1 8.7 months following transplantation. Mean serum creatinine at transition was 2.6\u00b13.2 mg/dL and mean patient age 21.2 \u00b1 0.3 years. 61% of patients received living donor kidneys. Within 31\u00b13.5 months of transition, 13 (31.5%) of patients experienced graft loss. Causes of graft loss included admitted non-adherence (n=6), recurrent disease (n=3), chronic progressive graft dysfunction (n=3) and BK nephropathy (n=1). Graft loss occurred a mean of 16\u00b17 months post transition for non-adherent patients and 20.5\u00b1 3 months for adherent patients (P=ns). The characteristics of the cohort is shown in the table according to whether or not patients had documented non-adherence related graft loss. Conclusions: 1) Graft loss commonly occurs within 3 years following transition and is attributable to both patient non-adherence and late referral by the pediatric transplant program, 2) Non-adherence related graft loss was more common in males, 3) Factors unassociated with non-adherence include ethnicity, prior transplantation, age at transplant, & duration of dialysis, 4) The development of collaborative pediatric-toadult transition clinics may enhance adherence and lead to improved graft outcomes in this population. This 2-year, prospective randomized pilot study compares the effect of conversion to sirolimus (SRL) vs. continued mycophenolate meofetil (MMF) in patients with chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN), on histological progression.

Background: In contrast to adult kidney recipients, little is known about the long-term evolution of tacrolimus pharmacokinetics in pediatric kidney transplant recipients. Methods: One-hundred five pediatric recipients of a kidney allograft, all treated with a corticosteroid-free immunosuppressive protocol, were included. The evolution of tacrolimus doses and exposure was recorded at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after transplantation, as well as all pre-dose trough levels (C 0 ; N=9376) obtained in the first 2 years after transplantation. Results: Dose-corrected tacrolimus exposure (C 0 /dose/kg) increased in the first 2 years after kidney transplantation in pediatric recipients (table 1, figure 1 ). This decrease in dose requirement by time was only significant in children older than 5 years at the time of transplantation ( figure 1 ). In addition, the younger patients had significantly higher dose requirements compared to older recipients, which translated in marked underexposure in 72-79% of patients <12 years of age in the first days after transplantation. Conclusion: Pediatric kidney transplant recipients exhibit maturation of tacrolimus pharmacokinetics with time after transplantation. This can not be explained by differences in corticosteroid use, as all patients were treated with a corticosteroid-free protocol. The higher dose requirements for younger recipients and the absence of tacrolimus maturation in the youngest recipients suggest that age-dependent changes in tacrolimus intestinal first-pass effect, metabolism or distribution play a role. Whether age-specific tacrolimus dosing algorithms will improve outcome needs further study.",

Early administration of corticosteroids may obviate the need for liver transplantation (LT), but features which identify AIH in pts with ALF have not been determined. AIM: To identify clinical and histological features which distinguish ALF due to AIH. METHODS: 197/1033 pts in the ALF Study Group Registry had no evidence of viral, metabolic, vascular, and drug/toxic liver injury. All had ALF defined by acute disease, encephalopathy, and coagulopathy. Based upon admission clinical features, 52/197 had probable AIH, and 145 were considered \"indeterminate.\" Liver biopsies (LBx) available from 56 pts were reviewed by a blinded expert hepatopathologist. Clinicopathologic correlations were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: All LBx available from pts with suspected AIH had classical histologic features of AIH. Moreover, 23/46 (50%) LBx from pts with indeterminate ALF also had AIH features: extensive necrosis (100%), fibrosis (84%), cirrhosis (22%), interface hepatitis (75%), and plasma cell-rich inflammation (69%). Of all 33 LBx with AIH features, centrilobular lesions associated with acute, severe AIH (Am J Surg Path 2004;28:471) were frequent: plasma cellrich central venulitis (97%), exclusive centrilobular necroinflammation (19%), and pericentral dilatation/congestion (46%). Clinical characteristics and outcomes of the 75 pts with AIH based upon laboratory and histologic findings differed significantly from pts whose ALF remained indeterminate: AIH pts were older (44 v 38 y), predominantly female (75 v 56%), and had longer jaundice-encephalopathy interval (20 v 12 d) , lower ALT (660 v 1949 U/L), higher globulins (3.7 v 2.7 g/dL), lower creatinine (1.7 v 2.3 mg/ dL), and a higher prevalence of ANA (68 v 24%) and ASMA (51 v 29%) (all P<.01). Although spontaneous survival did not differ, more AIH pts underwent LT (63 v 34%), and more survived 1 month after enrollment (75 v 59%; P<.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Using histologic criteria to classify pts with indeterminate ALF, AIH accounted for at least 7% of the ALF Study Group registry, and represented 50% of indeterminate ALF. LBx should be performed in all patients with ALF of obscure etiology, in particular to identify centrilobular necroinflammatory lesions, which appear to be specific indicators of acute and severe AIH.

Reina Sofia, Cordoba, Spain. Background and Aim: We report on the preliminary results of the prospective multicenter Spanish study in HIV-1 infected patients who underwent OLT. Methods: The prospective multicenter Spanish study FIPSE-OLT-HIV 05-GESIDA 45-05 was initiated in January 2002. Inclusion criteria follows the rules previously described in the Spanish Consensus Document. HIV-infected patients transplanted between January 2002 and December 2006 were included in this study. Results: 89 OLT were consecutively performed in 85 HIV-1 infected patients in the period of the study. Median (IQR) follow-up is 16 (8-29) months. Median (IQR) age was 42 years (39-46), 74% of the recipients were male and former drug abuse was the most common HIV-1 risk factor (78%). 83% of the patients were transplanted due to HCV-related cirrhosis and 6% due to HBV cirrhosis. Median (IQR) MELD score was 14 (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) . Pre-OLT median (IQR) CD4 cell count was 288 (165-486) cells/mm3 and 64%patients had undetectable plasma HIV viral load. Immunosuppression was based on tacrolimus in 70% of the patients. HAART was re-started in a median (IQR) time of 10 (5-21) days after OLT and was based on efavirenz in 48% of the cases. Acute rejection occurred in 38 patients (43%). Twenty patients died (22.5%) mainly due to HCV recurrence (8%). Antiviral therapy with peg-interferon plus ribavirin was initiated in 18 patients obtaining a sustained viral response in 6 of them (33%). Patient survival (95% confidence intervals) at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years was 90% (81-95%), 74% (60-84%), 67% (52-79%) and 67% (52-79%), respectively. Conclusion: For selected HIV-1 infected patients under HAART therapy, OLT is a safe and effective procedure at mid-term. As in the HIV-negative population, HCV recurrence is the mayor cause of concern and response to antiviral therapy is still disappointing.",

Material & Methods: From September 1991 through July 2006, all the patients subject to liver transplant with histological diagnostics of chronic hepatitis relapse were submitted to antiviral treatment. Treatment was suspended if there was a severe adverse reaction to the drugs used, non-adherence, severe rejection or no response after at least 12 months. HCV positive serology patients, ALT increase (1,5x nl) and hepatic biopsy with Metavir rating showing structural 1 and/or periseptal or parenchymatous portal inflammatory activity /= 2 were included. From 1995 to 2003, all patients were treated with conventional interferon and ribavirine, regardless of the genotype. From October 2003 on, patients with genotype 1 were treated with ribavirine and pegylated interferon and genotype 3 were treated with conventional interferon and ribavirine. Results: 47 patients were treated during this time period, thirty-seven male (78.7%). Their average age was 48. 51.1% were genotype 1, 25.5% were genotype 3. Average time between transplant and beginning of treatment was 30 months. Average treatment was 16 (4-36) months. 74.5% received conventional interferon, 6.4%, pegylated alpha 2a and 19.1%, pegylated alpha 2b. 48.9% had one or more cellular rejection episodes before VHC relapse diagnostics and were treated with corticosteroids. Sustained virological response (SVR) occurred in 48.8%. Three patients had a virological response at the end of treatment (EVR) and have not completed six months post treatment. Out of 21 patients with SVR, 20.9% were genotype 3, 9.3% genotype 1 and 18.6% were not genotyped. Considering genotypes, SVR was detected in 16.7% with genotype 1, in 75% with genotype 3. SRV was detected when we examined hepatic biopsy, in 85.7% of the F1/F2 patients (18 out of 21), 9.5% of the F3 patients (2), 4.8% of the F4 patients (1) . Survival period of 5 years for SVR patients was 94% (20 out of 21) and 68.2% for patient without SVR (p = 0.03 -Kaplan-Meier).",

We evaluated, using SRTR data, the effect of ALD and/or HCV infection on transplant waitlist and post-transplant mortality, and survival benefit of deceased donor liver transplants. Methods: 38,889 patients age \u226518, who were listed between Sept 2001 and Dec 2006, and followed until Dec 31, 2006, were classified into 4 cells according to HCV or ALD status: HCV+, ALD-: 12,322; HCV+, ALD+: 4,220; HCV-, ALD+: 6,581; HCV-, ALD-: 15,776). Cox regression was used to estimate waiting list mortality and post-transplant mortality separately. Survival benefit, which encompasses both pre-and post-transplant events, was assessed using sequential stratification; an extension of Cox regression which matches transplant recipients by MELD and organ procurement organization to patients on active on the waitlist at the time of transplant. Results: HCV significantly (p=0.0001) increased waitlist mortality, with a covariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for HCV+ vs. HCV-of HR=1.19 (p=0.0001). The impact of HCV+ was greater among ALD+ candidates (HR=1.36; p<0.0001), but was also significant among ALD-candidates (HR=1.11; p=0.02). The contrast between ALD+ and ALD-waitlist mortality was only significant among HCV+ candidates (HR=1.14; p=0.006). Post-transplant mortality was significantly higher among HCV+ vs. HCV-recipients (HR=1.26; p=.0009); there was no difference between ALD+ vs. ALD-recipients. Survival benefit of liver transplantation was significantly lower among HCV+ compared to HCV-recipients with MELD 9-29, but significantly higher for HCV+ recipients with MELD scores of \u226530. A diagnosis of ALD did not influence the survival benefit of transplantation at any MELD score. Conclusion: Despite higher waitlist mortality, HCV+ recipients had significantly lower liver transplant survival benefit than HCV-recipients, within categories defined by MELD score. In contrast, transplant survival benefit was not influenced by ALD.",

            "text": "Background and Aim: Post-transplant active immunization with HBsAg vaccine is a potential prophylaxis strategy against HBV-recurrence after liver tranplantation due to HBV-related disease. Previous studies showed conflicting results using standard vaccines, whereas the use of the new adjuvant 3-deacylated monophosphoryl-lipid-A (MPL) significantly increased patient's immunization rate. We investigated the efficacy of a long-term (12 months) accelerated (monthly doses) vaccination schedule using the MPL-adjuvanted vaccine administered with and without concomitant HBIg. Methods: 18 patients (M/F:13/5) transplanted for HBV-related cirrhosis 73\u00b138 months earlier were recruited. All were HBsAg and HBV DNA negative in serum and cccDNA negative in liver tissue; 5 (27.7%) were co-infected with HCV and 5 (27.7%) with HDV. Study protocol consisted of 12 consecutive monthly intramuscular vaccine doses (HBsAg 20mg plus MPL 50mg) given together with lamivudine (100 mg/daily). Each of the initial 6 doses (first cycle) was administered within 7 days after 2000 IU HBIg i.v. infusion, while the last 6 doses were given after complete HBIg withdrawal (second cycle). HBsAb titre was determined before each vaccine dose and during the follow-up. All patients were maintaiened on low-level immunosuppression. Preliminary results: all patients completed first vaccination cycle; 14 (77.7%) patients received 12 adjuvanted vaccine doses (first and second cycles) and were monitored during 3 months follow-up after vaccination end. No side effects occurred, nor evidence of HBV recurrence. At the end of first cycle all patients achieved an anti-HBs titre >100 IU/L (mean 343\u00b1209 IU/L) and 3 (16.6%) a titre greater than 500 IU/L. At the end of follow-up 8/14 (57.1%) and 4/14 (28.5%) had an anti-HBs titre greater than 100 (mean 411\u00b1599 UI/L) and 500 IU/L, respectively. Conclusions: nine months after HBIg withdrawal more than half of the patients reached and maintained a protective anti-HBs titre (>100 IU/L). This intensive schedule using the MPL-adjuvanted vaccine, given in combination with HBIg and lamivudine, seems to be more effective than previous HBV vaccination protocols, although a longer follow-up is needed to assess its final effectiveness.",

In the present study, we simultaneously monitored HCV levels and alloimmune status in HCV-infected LT recipients. For evaluating the immune status of 33 HCV-infected LT recipients, we employed a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay using a CFSElabeling technique. The kinetics of the stimulation index of anti-donor reactive CD4 + T cells clearly mirrored that of the HCV RNA titer, and a significant reverse correlation was observed between the 2 parameters (R 2 = 0.67). We did not observe a similar relationship between the stimulation index of an anti-third party CD4 + T cells and the HCV RNA titer (R 2 = 0.03). One possible explanation for this phenomenon might be that cytokines outputted by T cells responding to allostimulation display the anti-HCV activity either directly or indirectly through the activation of bystander immunocytes.",

When one-way MLR was performed using one-halpoidentical combination in the upper chamber, HCV replication was significantly suppressed in the lower chamber containing HCV replicon cells. HCV replication was further suppressed when MLR was carried out with a complete allogeneic combination. This inhibiting effect was dependent on their IFN-\u03b3 secreting activity. In addition, a similar result was obtained when IFN-\u03b3-secreting NK/NKT cells stimulated with IL-2 were cultured in the upper chamber. In conclusion, there was a close relationship between the anti-donor and the anti-HCV immune status in the LT recipients infected with HCV. Cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 may be produced in response to allostimulation, and even these cytokines do not cause graft rejection, display anti-HCV activity. The elucidation of such a possible heterologous immunity via alloimmune responses to HCV replication might lead to the establishment of a novel method to prevent the progression of HCV reinfection in HCV-infected LT recipients.",

The goal of this study was to quantify the effect of BMI on access to transplantation (ATT), likelihood of receiving a transplantation (LRT), turndown rates (TR), and survival benefit (SB). Methods: ATT was defined as either registering for the deceased donor waiting list or receiving a live donor transplant, and was analyzed based on the USRDS registry using logistic regression. LRT was based on time spent in active status on the waiting list before receiving a transplant, and was analyzed based on the UNOS waiting list dataset using Cox proportional hazards time-to-event analysis. TR was defined as the relative likelihood of being turned down for an organ offer by a provider other than the patient, and was analyzed based on the UNOS organ turndown dataset using negative binomial regression. SB was defined as survival after kidney transplantation versus survival on the deceased donor waiting list, and was analyzed based on the UNOS waiting list dataset using a time-dependent Cox survival benefit model. All models were adjusted for known factors influencing those outcomes.

The goal of the MELD allocation system was to assign priority to the sickest candidate and assure equitable access to liver transplantation (LT). The MELD has been validated as a reliable marker for liver disease severity. At the time of referral to the transplant center or listing a high MELD (HM) is an indirect measure of delayed referral. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify factors associated with a HM at the time of listing for LT. Method: Using the UNOS database, we identified all adult candidates listed for LT from 2002 to 2006. Patients who received MELD upgrade (i.e. HCC, FHF) and those listed for multi-organ transplant were excluded. The data collected included demographics, insurance payor, diagnosis, and MELD score. MELD score at time of listing was categorized as low (< 20) and high (>20) and insurance type as Private, Medicaid and Government (excluding Medicaid) . Results: During the study period 15,323 candidates were added to the LT waiting list. Of these, there were 10,302 (67.2%) males with a median age of 53 (range 18 -83) . Caucasians were 11,511 (75.1%), Hispanic (11.6%), African Americans (8.9%) and the rest (4.4%). The underlying liver disease was Hepatitis C (31.9%), Alcohol (15.1%), Alcohol/Hepatitis C (7.2%), PBC/ PSC (9.9%), Cryptogenic (7.5%) and others (28.4%). Age, gender and liver disease etiology were not associated with a HM at listing. A HM was associated with Ethnicity: AA (49.5%), Hispanic (44.2%), Caucasian (36.6%)[p<0.001] and Insurance type: Medicaid (46.3%), government (38.8%) and private (36.5%)[p<0.001].There was no strong interaction between ethnicity/race and insurance in combination as predictors of HM i.e. both were independent. Conclusion: (1) AA and LT candidates with Medicaid insurance are more likely to have a HM score at initial listing (2) Hispanics had the lowest rate of private insurance compared to Caucasians with the highest rate. The above results suggest that type of insurance and ethnicity are independently associated with a HM (i.e. sicker patients) at listing. Since a HM score is associated with increased mortality, implementation of strategies that result in timely and equitable access to the transplantation network regardless of the insurance type or ethnicity of the candidate(s) should be a priority.",

We retrospectively studied pre-transplant cardiac evaluation (CE) practices among a national sample of renal allograft recipients. Methods: We examined USRDS data for Medicare beneficiaries transplanted in 1991-2004 with Part A and B benefits from dialysis initiation through transplant. Clinical traits defining \"high\" expected IHD risk were defined as diabetes, prior IHD, or >2 other coronary disease risk factors. Pre-transplant CE were identified by billing claims for noninvasive stress tests and angiography. We quantified individuals with claims for coronary revascularization procedures between CE and transplant, and abstracted post-transplant acute myocardial infarction (AMI) events from claims and death records. Results: Among 27,786 eligible patients, 46.3% (65.4% of high-risk and 20.4% of lower-risk) underwent CE before transplant. Overall, 9.5% of patients who received CE also received pre-transplant revascularization, including only 0.3% of lower-risk patients studied by CE ( Table A) . The adjusted odds of transplant without CE (higher OR for no CE, Table B ) increased sharply with younger age and shorter dialysis duration.

EX Ds were defined as age <10 (n=4), >45 (n=12, mean age 50.2 yrs), or donation after cardiac death (DCD, n=4). All DCD donors were managed with extracorporeal support. EX Rs were defined as age >50 (n=20, mean age 55.8 yrs) or those with a pretransplant serum C-peptide level >2.0 ng/ml (n=7, mean 5.7 ng/ml). All Rs received depleting antibody induction (57 rATG, 26 alemtuzumab) with tacrolimus, MMF, and tapered steroids (39 steroid-free).",

            "text": "Results: A total of 20 Ds (24%) and 23 Rs (28%) met the above EX criteria. Median waiting time was 10 months, mean pancreas preservation was 17 hours, and median length of stay was 10 days. With a mean follow-up (f/u) of 28 months, patient (pt) (95% EX D vs 94% non-EX D), kidney (90% EX D vs 89% non-EX D) and pancreas graft survival (85% EX D vs 81% non-EX D) rates were similar between D groups (all p=NS). The incidences of delayed kidney graft function (5% in each group) and early pancreas graft loss due to thrombosis (5% EX D vs 8% non-EX D) were also comparable between D groups. With regard to R groups, pt (87% vs 97%, p=0.13) and kidney (87% vs 92%, p=NS) graft survival (GS) rates were slightly lower in the EX R group compared to the non-EX R group, respectively. However, death-censored kidney GS rates (100% EX R vs 95% non-EX R) were comparable between groups. Uncensored pancreas GS rates (83% EX R vs 82% non-EX R) were similar. The incidences of acute rejection, surgical complications, infection, and other morbidity were comparable regardless of D or R group. At 1 year (or latest) follow-up, renal and pancreas functional parameters were similar between D groups. However, the EX R group demonstrated slightly compromised renal and pancreas allograft function and a greater need for oral hypoglycemic agents. Conclusion: Intermediate-term outcomes in SKPT from selected EX Ds or Rs have comparable outcomes, although EX R criteria may represent a risk factor for pt survival and functional outcomes. Conclusion: SPK recipients with functioning pancreas grafts have significantly improved kidney and patient survival compared to LD KA and DD KA. However, early pancreas graft failure results in kidney and patient survival rates similar to KA recipients. SPK provides optimal outcomes for patients with DM1, but long-term risk associated with early pancreas loss may be a consideration when selecting SPK vs KA transplantation.",

Using the data of the Collaborative Transplant Study (CTS), we studied type 1 diabetic recipients of deceased donor kidneys (DDK), living donor kidneys (LDK), or SPK performed during two time periods: 1984 to 1990 and 1991 to 2000 . We analyzed graft and patient survival rates for a maximum of 18 years. DDK recipients showed inferior graft and patient survival compared to LDK and SPK recipients in both time periods. LDK recipients had a superior graft survival rate initially, but the survival rate of kidneys in SPK recipients reached the level of LDK toward the end of the follow up period. The results of patient survival paralleled those of kidney graft survival: an early advantage of LDK as compared to SPK faded away during follow up. Multivariate analysis, in which pretransplant cardiovascular risk assessment was appropriately considered, showed that patient survival of SPK recipients was superior to that of LDK recipients beyond the tenth year after transplantation (hazard ratio HR = 0.55, p = 0.005). This was reflected by a lower cumulative cardiovascular death rate in recipients of SPK (37.0 %) compared to recipients of DDK (45.8 %) or LDK (49.3 %) . The early survival benefit of LDK compared to SPK is lost during long-term follow up, probably related to improved glycemic control in SPK recipients.",

            "text": "Conclusion: PAR is associated with worse long term kidney graft survival than KAR. It is likely that patients that experience PAR within the first year have also experienced undiagnosed sub-clinical KAR. This adds associative data to the argument that the likelihood of concordance between PAR and KAR is high and therefore, the need for increased monitoring of kidney function after PAR is warranted. The most efficacious immunosuppressive (immuno) regimen for SPKT is debated, and information on the best regimen to prevent AMR is particularly scarce. We performed a retrospective comparative cohort study that included 136 SPKT patients (Pts) transplanted in 2002-2005, who received maintenance immuno with TAC, MMF and steroids. Two groups were compared: Pts who received induction with alemtuzumab (Alem) (n=97) and Pts who were induced with basiliximab (Basilmab) (n=39). Donor and recipient characteristics were similar. KT acute cellular rejection (ACR) was more frequent with Basilmab (2-yr 12.8% vs 3.1%, p=0.04), but the incidence of biopsy-proven KT AMR was similar (2-yr 18% with Basilmab vs 13.8% with Alem, p=NS). No differences in prevalence were detected considering early AMR (<90th day) or late AMR (>90th day) separately. Multivariate analyses showed that the only significant risk factor for AMR was female gender (adjusted HR 2.97, p=0.016). The biopsy-proven KT rejection was associated with clinical PT rejection in 13 out of the 21 AMR cases (62%), without differences between the groups. Post-rejection KT graft survival was similar in both groups (2-yr Basilmab/Alem 94.7/91.2%), but deathcensored KT survival was lower with Alem (100/91.2%, p=0.05). The predominant cause of KT loss in Pts induced with Basilmab was death-with-function (n=3), while in Pts induced with Alem acute or chronic AMR was the most common cause of KT attrition (n=5). Pancreas survival was similar between both groups. More PT losses due to AR occurred in Alem-treated group than in the Basilmab group (4 vs 1) . Nearly all early episodes resolved with treatment and were not associated with worse graft survival. Conversely, late AMR episodes carried a worse prognosis, with decreased 2-yr KT (61.5% vs 96.2%, p<0.0001) and PT graft survival (47.7 vs 92.3%, p<0.0001). Late AMR was associated with graft loss in multivariate Cox models (kidney loss HR 3.34, p=0.05 and pancreas HR=3.22, p=0.049) . AMR is common in SPKT recipients. ACR is better prevented with Alem than with Basilmab, but no relevant difference is found between Alem and Basilmab in AMR. Late (as opposed to early) AMR episodes are associated with significant reduction in SPKT survival rates despite treatment. Preventive and/or different treatment strategies are required to address late AMR in SPKT.",

Thrombotic complications of PT are well known. We report IFI using the SPY device to assess immediate vascular patency and allograft perfusion. Our controlled experience is presented here. Methods: PTs were imaged intraoperatively using the SPY device under our IRB approved study. Indocyanine green solution (2.5 mg/ml) was injected into central venous catheters after completion of the vascular anastomoses of whole pancreaticoduodenal allografts. The pancreas transplants were performed in the retroperitoneal portal and enteric drained technique described by Boggi, et al. Imaging of the allograft vasculature, perfusion of the pancreas, and perfusion of the duodenal segments was performed and recorded intraoperatively. All video sequences were archived for later review. Results: IFI on 7 pancreas transplants (6 Simultaneous Pancreas-Kidney and 1 Pancreas after Kidney) was performed and video sequences were recorded. All pancreas allografts demonstrated intraoperative vascular patency and complete pancreatic and duodenal perfusion. There were no side effects seen. All pancreas transplants had immediate graft function. One patient was re-explored on postop day 0 due to persistent acidosis and hypotension. Repeat IFI demonstrated vascular patency and perfusion, despite an ischemic external physical appearance. There were no vascular complications that required reoperation, nor were there any graft thromboses. Characteristic slow venous outflow was seen in each case.",

Friedlander, 1 Wayne W. Hancock. 1 1 Pathology & Immunology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia & UPenn, Philadelphia, PA. Given toxicities of all current immunosuppressive agents, plus complications of malignancy, infection and chronic rejection, maintaining the search for new approaches to tolerance induction is essential. While weaning of immunosuppression is fraught with risks and costimulation blockade has not yielded the expected boon, use of a broad histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), such as trichostatin A (TsA) or suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), promotes Foxp3 acetylation of Foxp3 and binding to target genes, leading to enhanced Treg suppressive function, and 2 wks of therapy with HDACi and low-dose rapamycin can induce allograft tolerance. We now show that in addition to acetylation, modulation of a second major epigenetic mechanism, DNA methylation, has salutary effects, such that combined use of an HDACi and a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi, e.g. 5-aza-2 deoxycytidine) has potent effects. Microarray analysis of the effects of HDACi on Tregs showed down-regulation of multiple genes associated with DNA methylation, including DNMT, methyl-CpGbinding domain and associated proteins, leading us to test the effects of DNMTi use on Treg function. DNMTi administration decreased Foxp3 gene methylation, enhanced Treg gene expression, and increased Treg suppression in vitro, and led to a dose-dependent prolongation of cardiac allograft survival (BALB/c->C57BL/6) in vivo (p<0.01). The combination of HDACi and lower doses of DNMTi, administered for just 2 wks, led to permanent engraftment (>100 d, p<0.001), and the permanent acceptance of second donor allografts but acute rejection of third-party (CBA) cardiac allografts indicated induction of donor-specific tolerance post-epigenetic therapy. Analysis of long-surviving cardiac allografts showed a minor infiltrate consisting primarily of Foxp3+ Tregs and an absence of chronic rejection (transplant arteriosclerosis, myocardial fibrosis), whereas combined epigenetic therapy led to only minor prolongation of allograft survival in Treg-depleted recipients. In summary, brief use of 2 clinically approved agents (an HDACi plus an DNMTi), can synergistically enhance Treg function and induce Tregdependent donor-specific allograft tolerance without use of any immunosuppression. We conclude that insights gained through epigenetic targeting may provide completely new approaches to the taming and regulation of otherwise powerful immune responses post-transplantation.",

            "text": "A Novel Epigenetic Approach To Generate Mouse and Human CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + Regulatory T Cells. Girdhari Lal, 1 Nan Zhang, 1 William van der Touw, 1 Yaozhong Ding, 1 Jonathan S. Bromberg. 1 1 Gene and Cell Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York City, NY. Background: Constitutive Foxp3 expression is required for stable and suppressive CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells (Treg) . We previously showed that demethylation of an upstream CpG island of the Foxp3 promoter is characteristic of stable and suppressive Treg. Using DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, we present a novel method to generate antigen-specific Treg from mouse and human CD4 + CD25 -T cells. Methods: Na\u00efve CD4 + CD25 -T cells and natural Treg (nTreg) were purified from wild type or Foxp3-GFP transgenic mice. Human na\u00efve CD4 + CD25 -T cells were purified from PBMC. T cells were cultured with irradiated antigen presenting cells in the presence of IL-2, anti-CD3\u03b5 mAb, TGF\u03b2 or the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (ZdCyd), which demethylates the upstream promoter. Foxp3 expression was determined by flow cytometry and qRT-PCR. Results: Na\u00efve T cells cultured under stimulatory conditions with ZdCyd express increased Foxp3 mRNA (30 fold) and intracellular Foxp3 protein (35% of cells vs 2% without ZdCyd). Foxp3 expression is synergistically enhanced with TGF\u03b2 (76 \u00b1 4.6% vs 38.8 \u00b1 5.3% ZdCyd alone or 44.6 \u00b1 1.4% TGF\u03b2 alone), similar to nTreg (92.4 \u00b1 2.5%). TGF\u03b2 in combination with other DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (procainamide, hydralazine, RG108) also induces Foxp3. ZdCyd plus TGF\u03b2 induced Treg stably express Foxp3 and similar surface markers and cytokine mRNA as nTreg. ZdCyd plus TGF\u03b2 induced Treg suppress proliferation of CD4 + CD25 -T cells, prevent CD4 + CD25 -CD45RB hi induced colitis in SCID mice, and enhance islet allograft survival. ZdCyd plus TGF\u03b2 induce Foxp3 expression in antigen-specific wild type or T cell receptor transgenic CD4 + T cells stimulated with alloantigen or peptides, and in na\u00efve CD8 + CD25 -T cells. In vivo administration of ZdCyd preferentially preserves thymic CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + Treg generation. ZdCyd alone or ZdCyd plus TGFb induce strong Foxp3 expression in human CD4 + CD25 -T cells compared to TGF\u03b2 alone. ZdCyd plus TGF\u03b2 induced human Treg suppress the proliferation of na\u00efve CD4 + CD25 -T cells, whereas TGF\u03b2-induced Treg do not. Conclusion: DNA methyltransferase inhibitors induce stable and suppressive Foxp3 + Treg from peripheral CD4 + CD25 -T cells. These finding have important implications for understanding T cell development and differentiation, and provide a clinically applicable technique for manipulating epigenetic regulation for the generation of Treg for tolerance.",

Koehl, 1 Hans J. Schlitt, 1 Fred Fandrich, 2 Edward K. Geissler. 1 1 Surgery, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany; 2 Surgery, University Hospital Schleswig Holstein, Kiel, Germany. Background: The use of immunomodulatory cells in organ transplantation (Tx) is a promising tolerance-induction strategy. Here we describe a novel macrophage population capable of enriching T regulatory cells (Treg) and promoting tolerance. Methods: BALB/c bone marrow, spleen and blood mononuclear cells were cultured with M-CSF for 5 days, with a 24 hr pulse of IFN-\u03b3 on day 4; the resultant adherent cells are referred to as IFN\u03b3-induced monocyte-derived cells (IFN\u03b3-MdC) . Residual lymphocytes from these cultures were recultured with the adherent IFN\u03b3-MdC for an additional 3 days. IFN\u03b3-MdC were phenotyped by FACS and immunomodulation of lymphocytes was determined by cell counting and FACS analysis for Tregs. Mouse heterotopic heart Tx was used for in vivo testing. Results: IFN\u03b3-MdC highly express CD11b/c, F4/80 and PD-L1. Compared to classically-activated (M1) macrophages, IFN\u03b3-MdC express less CD40/CD86, but higher CD11c. IFN\u03b3-MdC profoundly delete activated, but not resting, lymphocytes (>60%), with cell contact (via transwell system) and caspases (via inhibitors) being essential. Most interestingly, IFN\u03b3-MdC highly enrich lymphocytes for CD4 + CD25 high Foxp3 + Treg (41\u00b12%; n=27). The same, or higher, proportions of Treg developed when IFN\u03b3-MdC were produced from MACS-purified CD11b + and CD4 + cells (1:1) . IFN\u03b3-MdC culture supernatant showed increased IL-10 (ELISA) vs. monocyte control cultures (183\u00b142 pg/ml vs. <30 pg/ml, respectively; n=6), suggesting IL-10 as one potential mediator. IFN\u03b3 receptor signaling and CD40 interactions are required for Treg enrichment, as confirmed using IFN\u03b3 receptor and CD40 knock-out mice (C57BL/6 mice). IFN\u03b3-MdC derived from CD11b + cells and lymphocytes of OVA-transgenic OTII mice showed enrichment of Treg by 10-fold with high-affinity OVA peptide (323-339) vs. Treg levels using a low-affinity OVA peptide (OVA 323-334), suggesting Ag-specific Treg cells can be enriched with IFN\u03b3-MdC. Finally, a single post-heart Tx (d+1) i.v. injection of 5x10 6 donor (C3H)-derived IFN\u03b3-MdC prolonged allograft survival in BALB/c recipients from 8.5\u00b10.8d in controls (n=5) to 21.4\u00b18.3d (n=11; p=0.001). Conclusions: IFN\u03b3-MdC are a novel macrophage population capable of deleting activated T cells and highly enriching remaining lymphocytes for Tregs. Therefore, IFN\u03b3-MdC could be useful in a clinical setting for promoting transplant tolerance.",

IDO is negatively regulated by DAP12. In some systems, loss of DAP12 correlates with immunostimulatory activation of pDC, while in others, its absence correlates with enhancement of pDC tolerogenicity through induction of IDO. In these studies, we characterized the ability of WT and IDO-deficient pDC to attenuate murine heart allograft rejection in order to define the contribution of IDO and its regulation by DAP12 relative to the immunoregulatory potential of pDC. Methods: pDC and control myeloid (m) DC were generated from BM cultures of WT or IDO KO C57BL/6 (B6; H2 b ) mice. WT mDC, pDC or IDO KO pDC were pulsed with alloAg (BALB/c; H2 d ), stimulated with CpG, and then injected i.v. into syngeneic (B6) recipients 7d before heart transplant. Donor Ag-specific activation of T cells was analyzed by MLR and ELISA. DAP12 expression was evaluated by RT-PCR and abrogated with siRNA. Results: Administration of IDO KO pDC 7d before transplant prolonged graft survival beyond that seen with control mDC, but not to the extent seen with WT pDC, suggesting involvement of IDO. pDC cultures from IDO KO mice exhibited a more mature phenotype than their WT counterparts with reduced expression of co-regulatory molecules (e.g., ICOSL). Although IDO KO pDC induced enhanced T cell alloactivation compared to WT pDC, use of the IDO inhibitor 1-MT indicated that WT pDC do not produce functional IDO. Further analyses showed WT pDC exhibited high levels of DAP12 mRNA expression. Silencing DAP12 had no effect on the ability of WT pDC to activate allogeneic T cell proliferation, but significantly enhanced IFN\u03b3 secretion. Addition of 1-MT to MLR with DAP12-silenced pDC increased T cell proliferative responses to alloAg, verifying IDO induction in DAP12-silenced pDC. Conclusions: These data underscore the prophylactic potential of pDC for cell-based therapy that may be independent of IDO, due, in part, to elevated DAP12 expression. Additionally, our data support a role for DAP12 in both immunostimulation and immunoregulation by pDC.",

            "text": "Rapamycin Preferentially Blocks the Expansion of Potentially Tolerogenic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells In Vivo. Heth R. Turnquist, 1 Angus W. Thomson. 1, 2 1 Starzl Transpl Inst and Dept of Surgery; 2 Dept of Immunol, Univ of Pittsburgh Sch of Med, Pittsburgh, PA. Rapamycin (RAPA), a 'tolerance-sparing' immunosuppressant with anti-proliferative properties, inhibits myeloid (m) dendritic cell (DC) differentiation/maturation in vitro. RAPA decreases CD11c + DCs in the mouse spleen and suppresses the expansion of total CD11c + DC following administration of the DC growth factor, fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L). However, the influence of RAPA on plasmacytoid (p) DC,the principal type-1 IFN producers in the body, known to regulate innate and adaptive immune responses, and reported to promote experimental transplant tolerance, has not been evaluated. Methods: DC were propagated from bone marrow for 10 days (d) in Flt3L, in the absence or presence of a clinically-relevant dose of RAPA (10 ng/ml). In addition, DCs were mobilized in C57BL/10 mice by i.p. Flt3L (10 mg/d for 10 d; d1-10). Untreated and Flt3L-treated groups also received RAPA (0.5 mg/kg/d i.p.; d3-10). On d11, DC were isolated by density gradient centrifugation and/or CD11c + positive selection. mDC (CD11c + CD11b + ) and pDC (CD11c lo CD11b -B220 + ) were identified by flow cytometry. Results: RAPA suppressed pDC and mDC generation in vitro; RAPA-DC-treated cultures had only 22% of the pDC and 40% of the mDC found in control conditions. In normal mice, both mDC (54% of control) and pDC (24.5%) numbers were reduced significantly by RAPA administration. RAPA, when given concurrently with Flt3L, blunted the typical profound expansion of mDC. Specifically, Flt3L and RAPA-treated mice displayed a 46\u00b18X increase over control (steady state) numbers compared to a 145\u00b139X increase in mice treated with Flt3L alone. Flt3L-induced expansion of pDC was to a much greater extent impacted by RAPA, as absolute numbers of pDC increased only 6.5\u00b12.2X over control numbers compared to 51\u00b13X increase in absolute splenic pDC in Flt3L-treated mice. Conclusion: These data identify RAPA as a selective suppressor of pDC generation, as described for corticosteroids. This has significant implications, given the use of RAPA following organ transplantation, and the suggested importance of secondary lymphoid tissue pDC for promotion of transplant tolerance mediated by Treg. Due attention to these disparate effects of RAPA on regulating cell populations will be necessary to optimize therapeutic regimens for safe promotion of tolerance. The liver is tolerated better than other transplanted organs. This may reflect the inherent tolerogenicity of liver dendritic cells (DC) and interactions with Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Treg). Recent studies have shown that CD103 expression on DC correlates with induction of Foxp3 + Treg, and can be enhanced in the presence of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and retinoic acid (RA), both of which are produced in the liver. This study evaluates CD103 expression on liver plasmacytoid (p) and myeloid (m) DC and the potential of liver DC subsets to induce Tregs. Methods: pDC and mDC were magnetically isolated from livers and spleens of C57BL/10 mice and co-cultured with CFSE-labeled allogeneic (BALB/c) CD4 + CD25 -T cells. After 4 or 5d of co-culture, T cells were assessed for CFSE dilution and intracellular Foxp3 expression. rhTGF-\u03b2 and either all trans or cis-RA were added to co-cultures. CD103 expression was evaluated by flow cytometry. Results: CD103 expression was elevated on liver pDC and mDC compared to spleen pDC or mDC, with higher expression on liver mDC. pDC from the liver and the spleen were poor inducers of Foxp3 in CD4 + CD25 -T cells compared to mDC. Foxp3 induction was enhanced with TGF-\u03b2 when splenic pDC were used as stimulators. However, when liver pDC were used as stimulators, TGF-\u03b2 had no effect on Foxp3 induction. RA (either all trans or cis) enhanced induction of Foxp3 + cells in CD4 + CD25 -T cells in the presence of TGF-\u03b2 when splenic pDC but not liver pDC were used as stimulators. TGF-\u03b2 and TGF-\u03b2 with RA also enhanced Foxp3 induction in CD4 + CD25 -T cells when either spleen or liver mDC were used as stimulators, though splenic mDC were superior inducers of Foxp3. Conclusions: Many studies have focused on naturally-occurring Foxp3 + Tregs in systemic tolerance. Our data show that liver mDC and pDC are poor inducers of Foxp3 in T cells, even in the presence of TGF-\u03b2 and RA. These data suggest that the inherent tolerogenicity of liver DC subsets may be independent of Treg induction or that liver DC interact with Treg through alternative mechanisms. Background: T cell-mediated immune rejection occurs in organ transplantation. In addition to MHC-TCR signaling, T cell activation requires costimulation from antigen presenting cells. B7 molecules (CD80/CD86) and CD40 are critical costimulatory molecules in T cell activation. Insufficient or lack of costimulation results in inactivation or tolerance. We hypothesized that blocking the costimulation pathway using small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression vector can prolong allogeneic heart graft survival. Method: Vectors that express hairpin siRNAs specifically targeting CD40 and CD80 were prepared. Recipients (BALB/c mice) were treated with CD40 and/or CD80 siRNA vectors, 3 and 7 days prior to heart transplantation. Control groups were injected with a blank vector and sham treatment (PBS). After siRNA treatment, a fully MHCmismatched (BALB/c to C57/BL6) heart transplantation was performed. Result: Allogeneic heart graft survival (>100days) was approximately 70% in the mice treated simultaneously with CD40 and CD80 siRNA vectors. In contrast, allogenic hearts transplanted into recipients treated with blank vector and PBS stopped beating within 10 days. Hearts transplanted into CD40 or CD80 siRNA vector-treated recipients had an increased graft survival time compared to negative control groups, but did not survive longer than 40 days. Real time PCR and flow cytometric analysis showed an upregulation of FoxP3 expression in spleen lymphocytes and a concurrent downregulation of CD40 and CD80 expression in splenic dendritic cells of siRNAtreated mice. An MLR, using splenic dendritic cells (DCs) isolated from tolerant recipients, showed a significantly lower T cell proliferation capacity in CD40-and CD80-siRNA vector-treated mice, compared to control groups. Tolerant DCs from CD40-and CD80-treated recipients promoted CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cell differentiation. Finally, tissue histopathology demonstrated an overall reduction in lymphocyte interstitium infiltration, vascular obstruction, and edema in mice treated with CD40 and CD80 siRNA vectors. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the simultaneous silencing of CD40 and CD80 genes has synergistic effects in preventing allograft rejection, and may therefore have therapeutic potential in clinical transplantation. Costimulation blockade (CoB) of the CD28/B7 pathway has long been suggested as a means of attaining indefinite, well-tolerated, antigen-specific prophylaxis from allograft rejection. Although effective in rodent models, CD28/B7 blockade is not alone sufficient to prevent rejection in more robust primate models. The relative presence of allocrossreactive memory T cells is one mechanism of CoB resistant rejection. LFA3-Ig is an approved agent for the treatment of psoriasis, shown clinically to deplete TEM cells in psoriatic lesions. We hypothesize that LFA3-Ig specifically targets CoB resistance cells, including heterologous alloreactive T cell memory, while avoiding interference of peripheral mechanisms that foster CoB-mediated allograft acceptance. Rhesus monkeys underwent MHC mismatched renal allotransplantation. CTLA4-Ig was given 20 mg/ kg IV on days -1, 0,3,7,14,21,28 and 10 mg/kg IV on days 35,42,49,56. LFA3-Ig, (0.3 mg/kg IV) was given on day -1,0,3,7 then weekly (8 wks). Sirolimus was given orally (1mg/kg) days 0-90 and donor specific transfusion (7 ml/kg IV) on day -1. Animals were followed by polychromatic flow-cytometry to quantify T cell subsets. LFA3-Ig synergized with CTLA4-Ig successfully preventing renal allograft rejection in this model and leading to indefinite survival in 2/5 animals (Table) . This enhanced survival was associated with a significant reduction in TEM cells in animals treated with LFA3-Ig compared to animals without LFA3-Ig treatment (figure). LFA3-Ig withdrawal led to TEM re-population and rejection. This therapy regimen, all clinically available agents, promotes CoB-mediated graft acceptance without the use of calcineurin inhibitors, steroids, or gross T cell depletion.",

            "text": "The aim of this study was to investigate the immunological pathways that regulate T cell dependant allograft responses in the hope of finding novel immunomodulatory compounds. Islet (and skin) allografts were transplanted into full MHC-mismatched Wild Type (WT) and BAFF-Transgenic (BAFF-Tg) recipient mice. Allograft function/ rejection was monitored by blood glucose levels and/or confirmed by nephrectomy. Histology, splenocyte populations & T cell functions were analyzed. The B cell activation factor from the TNF family (BAFF) is critical for B cell survival. T cells express BAFF receptors suggesting that BAFF may also play a role in T cell responses. Contrary to expectations, we found that BAFF-Tg mice accepted a full MHC-mismatched islet allograft for >100 days. In addition, BAFF-Tg mice also showed delayed skin graft rejection. This was due to a T cell intrinsic change in allo-responsiveness as shown by a failure of purified BAFF-Tg T cells to reject an allograft in adoptive transfer experiments. However, BAFF-Tg T cells were not anergic per se as they proliferated normally to mitogens in vitro and to antigenic challenge in vivo. Intriguingly, BAFF-Tg mice harbored an increased frequency of T regulatory cells in the periphery as compared to WT mice. Elimination of CD25 + T cells restored normal allograft rejection to BAFF-Tg mice, demonstrating that the increased number of Treg cells were responsible for their altered allo-immunity. In a second approach, BAFF-Tg T cells depleted of CD4 + CD25 + T cells were adoptively transferred to transplanted RAG recipients, and in this case the BAFF-Tg CD4 + CD25 -T cells rejected their allograft. Proliferation assays showed that excessive BAFF was not promoting Treg expansion by driving proliferation in the periphery. Adoptive transfer of GFP expressing syngeneic splenocytes did not exhibit enhanced survival in the presence of excessive BAFF. However, analysis of Treg cells in the thymus of BAFF-Tg mice showed an increased intrathymic frequency. Together these results demonstrate that BAFF-Tg mice harbor an expanded number of Treg cells that prevent Th1-type immune responses including allograft rejection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that manipulating BAFF levels may provide a means to generate immunosuppression free dominant allograft tolerance. We have previously reported the outcome of pig-to-baboon thymokidney transplants from GalT-KO miniature swine using an immunosuppressive regimen designed to facilitate the induction of tolerance. Although the results were superior to results using hDAF thymokidneys, there was a high rate of early post-operative complications. We investigated whether the elimination of steroids and whole body irritation (WBI) from the treatment protocol would decrease the complication rate in the perioperative period. Methods: 7 baboons received thymokidney transplants from GalT-KO miniature swine. The immunosuppressive regimen was based on the previously published protocol, but eliminated steroids and substituted Rituximab for WBI. It consisted of thymectomy day -21, splenectomy day 0, ATG, Rituximab, MMF and anti-CD154 mAb. Renal function was assessed by serum creatinine levels. Evidence for baboon thymopoiesis in the pig thymus was assessed by FACS and immunohistochemistry. Results: One animal died due to a drug reaction at POD 18 with normal renal function and no evidence of infection. The remaining 6 baboons showed no signs of rejection although IgM deposition was observed, likely due to preformed non-Gal nAb. There were no deaths due to rejection. Although early infectious complications were not seen, late complications leading to mortality were still observed, including systemic CMV infection (POD 28), pleural effusions (POD 40, 57) , ARDS with pulmonary hemorrhage (POD 49, 81) and acute myocardial infarction (POD 83). Two animals showed evidence for early thymopoiesis in the pig thymus by FACS and immunohistochemistry. CD4+/CD8+ thymocytes were seen in the thymic grafts, indicating T cell development was supported by the pig thymus. The average survival of the steroid-free group was 51 days including the animal with the drug reaction and 56 days excluding it, compared to 34.6 days in the regimen that included steroids/WBI. Conclusions: A steroid-free and WBI free regimen designed for the induction of tolerance across the pig-to-baboon xenogeneic barrier had fewer early post-operative complications than previous regimens. Greater than 50-day average survival of recipients of life-supporting xenogeneic thymokidneys was observed without rejection. This regimen also appears to permit baboon thymopoiesis in the pig thymus. Purpose: The effects of human decay accelerating factor (hDAF) addition to the galactosyl transferase knock-out (GalT-KO) background in transgenic pig kidney xenotransplantation in baboons has not been previously studied. Methods: Baboon recipients of GalT-KO (n=4) or GalT-KO/hDAF (n=2) pig kidneys received Flolan, heparin and/or aspirin. Steroids (S), cobra venom factor (V), ATG (A), MMF (M), and/or a low-dose CD154 blockade (C) regimen were given. Results: Pre-transplant (tx) anti-non-Gal antibody (Ab) titers were inconsistently associated with early GalT-KO kidney xenograft failure. High D-Dimer levels 4 hours post-tx were closely associated with early GalT-KO graft loss but not when assessing levels of C3a, BTG, or increased CD62P expression on circulating platelets. Regimens lacking MMF and/or CD154 blockade elicited by day 7-14 large anti-donor non-gal Ab responses . Post-operative creatinine levels for the GalT-KO/hDAF recipients were lower along with superior graft survival compared to GalT-KO; D-Dimer, anti-donor non-Gal Ab, C3a, BTG, and F1+2 measurements are in progress for the GalT-KO/hDAF recipients. GalT-KO/hDAF V,A,M,S,C >10* TBP 239 1.9; 1.5 * Graft survival at time of abstract submission as graft still functioning at time of abstract submission; TBP --To be processed ! --anuric; non-life supporting, but appeared viable, pink, and well-perfused until day 7 Conclusion: Early failure of vascularized GalT-KO organs is closely associated with activation of coagulation pathways; whether this is triggered primarily by anti-non-Gal Ab or by other mechanisms is not addressed by our study. Preliminary results using GalT-KO/hDAF pig kidneys show promise in attenuating or possibly preventing these and/or other such mechanisms. The established efficacy of CD154-based costimulation blockade with MMF to prevent induced anti-non-Gal antibody elaboration is confirmed by our preliminary findings.",

            "text": "Recovery of Cardiac Function after Pig-to-Primate Orthotopic Heart Transplant. Christopher G. A. McGregor, 1 William R. Davies, 1 Keiji Oi, 1 Henry D. Tazelaar, 1 Randall C. Walker, 1 Krishnaswamy Chandrasekaran, 1 Guerard W. Byrne. 1 1 Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. Xenotransplantation has been proposed as a method to alleviate the shortage of donor organs. We report survival of up to 8 weeks of three orthotopic transplants after pig-tobaboon cardiac xenotransplantation. Pig-to-baboon orthotopic transplantation was performed using an adult baboon recipient and CD46 transgenic pig. The recipients were treated with an \u03b1-Gal polymer to block the effects of anti-Gal antibody and with ATG induction and a tacrolimus and sirolimus based maintenance immunosuppression. Heart function was continuously monitored by intramyocardial electrocardiography and every 3 -4 days by serial echocardiography. Standard hematological, serum chemistry and cardiac troponin levels were monitored every 2 -3 days. The animals survived 34, 40, and 57 days in a healthy condition. Mortality was a result of pneumonitis, respiratory failure and bowel infarction respectively. One recipient (survival 40 days) showed impaired perioperative left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 25% on echo. Over the next two weeks, the ejection fraction in this animal returned to normal (60%) and troponin levels normalized. This study shows the longest survival of orthotopic cardiac xenografts to date with recovery of impaired heart function after early ischemia reperfusion injury. This significant improvement in ventricular function suggests that the normal reparative processes appear to function across the xenotransplantation barrier, supporting the potential clinical potential of cardiac xenotransplantation. Purpose: To determine whether the galactosyl transferase gene knock-out (GalT-KO) protects pig lungs from hyperacute lung rejection (HALR) by human blood. The effects of adding human decay accelerating factor (hDAF) to the GalT-KO background will also be examined for the first time. Methods: Heparinized fresh human blood was used to perfuse GalT-KO pig lungs (n=10). Lung function was assessed by flow, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), oxygen transfer, and tracheal edema using pre-defined survival endpoints. Historical wild-type (WT) pig lungs (n=15) provide context for analysis. Additionally, two pig lungs expressing GalT-KO/hDAF were recently examined, one of which received treatment with Xigris. Results: Median lung survival in GalT-KO lungs was 114 minutes (range 15min to >240min) vs. 10 minutes in WT lungs (range 4min to 36min, p= 0.01); 2/2 GalT-KO/hDAF pig lungs survived >240 min. PVR at 5 minutes for GalT-KO lungs was 62\u00b135mmHg-min/L vs.WT lungs (308\u00b1178 mmHg-min/L at 5 minutes) vs. 23mmHgmin/L for each GalT-KO/hDAF lung. Complement activation (\u2206C3a) at 15 minutes was significantly lower with GalT-KO (\u2206C3a 133\u00b1243 ng/mL) than WT lungs (vs. 2080\u00b11332 ng/mL, p=0.039). GalT-KO was also associated with reduced platelet activation: only 4\u00b14% of circulating platelets express CD62P at 15 min. vs. 16\u00b113% in the WT group (p=0.05); \u2206\u03b2TG at 15 min [223\u00b1151 IU/mL (GalT-KO) vs. 1196\u00b11186 IU/ mL (WT)], and less thrombin formation (\u2206 F1+2) at 15 minutes (GalT-KO: 5\u00b17.9 nM vs. WT: 22\u00b139 nM). \u2206C3a, % of circulating platelets expressing CD62P, \u2206\u03b2TG, and \u2206 F1+2 measurements are in progress for GalT-KO/hDAF. Platelet sequestration was delayed as mean % of the initial platelets remaining in the GalT-KO lung perfusate was 52\u00b119% at 15min vs. 27\u00b19% in the WT lung group (p=0.02). Neutrophil sequestration was also diminished in GalT-KO (58\u00b115% residual) vs. WT lung (5\u00b13% residual, p=0.004). Conclusion: GalT-KO pig lungs are significantly protected from several facets of HALR: complement and coagulation cascade activation, neutrophil sequestration, and platelet activation are all partially attenuated by this modification alone. Preliminary results suggest that GalT-KO/hDAF lungs offer even further protection.",

Purpose Acute humoral xenograft rejection (AHXR), frequently associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), remains a challenge in pig-to-primate xenotransplantation (Tx). A previous in vitro study showed that recipient platelets and monocytes were induced to express tissue factor (TF) after incubation with porcine endothelial cells, and we speculated this may contribute to thrombosis. The present study investigated whether circulating (extragraft) monocytes and platelets express TF and whether this relates to the development of DIC after pig Tx. Methods Baboons (n=7) received an aortic patch or kidney from either a wild-type (WT) or \u03b11,3galactosyltransferase gene-knockout (GTKO) pig, with or without immunosuppressive therapy. Baboon monocytes and platelets were isolated from blood before and after Tx. Surface TF phenotype was determined by flow cytometry. Functional TF activity was determined by clotting time assays after mixing monocytes and platelets with recalcified Factor VII (FVII)-deficient plasma with or without added FVII.",

BACKGROUND: Xenotransplantation carries inherent risks of infectious disease transmission to the recipient and even to society at large, and should only be carried out with tight regulation and oversight. A collaboration between the International Xenotransplantation Association, the University Hospital Geneva and the World Health Organization has established an international inventory (www.humanxenotransplant. org) aiming to collect basic data on all types of xenotransplantation practices on humans that are currently ongoing or have been recently performed. METHODS: We collected information using publications in scientific journals, presentations at international congresses, internet-based information, and declarations of IXA members. An electronic questionnaire is available on the website www. humanxenotransplant.org, which can be filled out and sent to the office in Geneva. RESULTS: We identified a total of 16 recent or current human applications of xenotransplantation, eight were currently ongoing and one will start soon. The source animal was: pig (n=7), sheep (n=3), calf (n=1), rabbit (n=2), blue shark (n=1), hamster (n=1), and unknown (n=1). All trials transplanted xenogeneic cells, i.e. islets of Langerhans (n= 6), hepatocytes (n=1), kidney cells (n=1), chromaffin cells (n=1), embryonic stem cells (n=2), fetal (n=4) and adult cells (n=1) of various organs. The treatments were performed in 10 different countries, 7 in Europe, 2 in Russia, 2 in Asia, 2 Mexico, 1 in USA and 1 in Africa. Six countries had no national regulation on xenotransplantation. CONCLUSION: Several clinical applications of cell xenotransplantation are ongoing around the world, often without any clear governmental regulation. This information should be used to inform national health authorities, health care staff and the public, with the objective of encouraging good practices, with internationally harmonized guidelines and regulation of xenotransplantation.",

Starzl Transplantation Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA; 2 Revivicor, Inc., Blacksburg, VA. Purpose: (1) To compare the antibody binding and complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC) of human sera to pig peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) from (i) wild-type (WT), (ii) \u03b11,3-galactosyltransferase gene-knockout (GTKO), (iii) human membrane cofactor protein transgenic (MCP) and (iv) GTKO/MCP pigs. (2) To investigate the effect on binding and CDC of human sera following activation of PAEC. Methods: Pooled human serum was tested by flow cytometry for binding of IgM and IgG (5% serum concentration) and CDC (25% serum concentration) to PBMC and PAEC from WT, GTKO, MCP, and GTKO/MCP pigs. PAEC from all 4 pig types were activated by IFN-\u03b3, and again tested for antibody binding and CDC. Results: There was higher binding of IgM and IgG to WT and MCP than to GTKO and GTKO/MCP PBMC and PAEC, but there were no differences in binding (i) between WT and MCP cells or (ii) between GTKO and GTKO/MCP cells. CDC of WT PBMC and PAEC was significantly greater than of GTKO, MCP, and GTKO/MCP PBMC (WT 73%; GTKO 37%; MCP 30%; GTKO/MCP 4%) and PAEC (WT 51%; GTKO 18%; MCP 1%; GTKO/MCP 0%) (both p<0.05). Importantly, there was no lysis of GTKO/ MCP PAEC. After activation of PAEC, although CDC was increased against WT and GTKO PAEC, MCP and GTKO/MCP PAEC demonstrated significant resistance to lysis (WT 73%; GTKO 41%; MCP 5%; GTKO/MCP 0%). Conclusions: (1) CDC of all 3 types of genetically-engineered PBMC and PAEC was significantly lower than of WT PBMC and PAEC, with lysis of GTKO/MCP PAEC being significantly lower than to GTKO or MCP cells. (2) PAEC from both MCP and GTKO/MCP showed resistance to lysis even after activation of the cells. (3) Organs from GTKO/MCP pigs should provide considerable protection against CDC.",

            "text": "Role for CD47-SIRP\u03b1 Signaling in Human T Cell Proliferation in Response to Stimulation with Porcine Antigen Presenting Cells. Hiroyuki Tahara, 1 Hideki Ohdan, 1 Kentaro Ide, 1 Toshimasa Asahara. 1 1 Department of Surgery, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan. We have previously proven that genetic induction of human CD47 on porcine cells provides inhibitory signaling to signal regulatory protein(SIRP) \u03b1 on human macrophages; this provides a novel approach to preventing macrophage-mediated xenograft rejection. A recent report indicated that the similar CD47-SIRP system negatively regulates the functions of both T cells and antigen presenting cells(APCs) in humans. We hypothesize that the interspecies incompatibility of CD47 may also act as an additional barrier of T cell-mediated xenograft rejection. We have analyzed the frequency and proliferative activity of human T cells responding to either porcine or allogenic APCs by using in vitro mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay with a CFSE-labeling technique. Irradiated stimulator porcine or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMCs) were cultured with CFSE-labeled responder human PBMCs. By FCM analysis, the number of division precursors was extrapolated from the number of daughter cells of each division and from the mitotic events, and precursor frequencies in CD4 + and CD8 + T cell subsets. Using these values, stimulation index(SI) was calculated. The frequencies of alloreactive and xenoreactive CD4 + T cell precursors were almost identical, 4.5\u00b10.8% and 4.4\u00b10.9%, respectively (n=10-12, for each type of precursor). However, the SI of xenoreactive CD4 + T cells was significantly higher than that of alloreactive CD4 + T cells, indicating a stronger reaction by a single xenoreactive CD4 + T cell. In the presence of human CD47-Fc(containing the extracellular domain of human CD47 fused to the Fc portion of human Ig, 10\u00b5g/ml), the SI of xenoreactive CD4 + T cells was significantly reduced to a level similar to that of alloreactive CD4 + T cells (n=12, P<0.05), although the frequencies of their precursors were absolutely uninfluenced. The frequencies of alloreactive and xenoreactive CD8 + T cell precursors were also identical, i.e. 3.5\u00b10.3%, 3.9\u00b10.9%, respectively (n=10-12). The SI of both alloreactive and xenoreactive CD8 + T cells did not differ: however, that of xenoreactive CD8 + T cells was significantly suppressed in the presence of human CD47-Fc (n=12, P<0.05). These results suggest that the T cell responses to porcine cells are stronger than those to allogeneic cells because of the interspecies incompatibility of CD47. Moreover, genetic manipulation of porcine APCs to induce human CD47 expression might attenuate human T cell-mediated xenograft rejection. Reactivation of human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) is a potential risk following the clinical application of pig-to-human xenotransplantation. Since little is known about undesirable side-effects arising from hCMV infection of porcine organs, we investigated the capabilities of various hCMV strains to infect porcine endothelial cells (pEC) and putative immunological consequences thereof. pEC from different anatomical origins were incubated with the hCMV laboratory strains AD169 and TB40/E or a clinical isolate at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) ranging from 0.1 to 100. Viral replication kinetics, evolution of cytopathology, and lytic end points were analyzed. Consequences of pEC infection on human NK cell activation were evaluated using xenostimulation assay assessing NK cell IFNg secretion and cytotoxicity. Infection was evident and a maximum percentage of infected cells was reached at a MOI of 10. hCMV replicated in all tested pEC types, with a fraction of infected cells ranging from 1% to 50%. AD169 infection of 2A2 (microvascular EC) resulted in cytopathic effect (CPE) development by 3 dpi and in lysis of 70% of the cells at 7 dpi. Contrary, no CPE was observed in PED (aortic EC) up to 15 dpi. Infection of 2A2 with TB40/E was non-lytic and resulted in accumulation of both extra-and intracellular virus. Virus titers reached a maximum at 5 dpi, peaking at levels 20-fold higher than residual input virus. We then determined whether infected pEC supported a complete replication cycle and produced viral progeny. After 5 dpi pEC supernatants and lysates revealed the production of significant amounts of virus. Preliminary results showed that coculture of human NK cells and infected pEC resulted in increased NK killing and IFNg production. Altogether, these findings provide evidence that pEC are permissive and support the complete productive replication cycle of hCMV. However, CPE are cell-type and strain dependent. Moreover, pEC infection leads to modification of the xenogeneic cytotoxicity mediated by human NK cells. Our findings allow a better estimation of the potential role of hCMV cross-species infection following xenotransplantation and may be crucial to guide future clinical trials.

Terasaki, 3 Narindar Mehra. 2 1 One Lambda, Inc., Canoga Park, CA; New Delhi, India; 3 Terasaki Foundation Laboratory, Los Angeles, CA. Purpose: Post-transplant HLA antibodies have been shown to be linked to chronic graft failure, yet some recipients do well in the presence of antibodies. We investigated whether testing for donor-specificity of antibodies improves the predictive value of antibodies in regards to chronic rejection. Methods: In a prospective study of 400 renal transplant recipients, post-transplant sera were tested for HLA and MICA antibodies, and positive sera were tested by single antigen beads to determine whether the antibodies were donor-specific. One year after testing, biopsy and clinical data on the graft status were collected. Patients who did not have follow-up or died with function were excluded from analysis. Results: Of the 350 patients with follow-up and ABDR typing info, 102 (29%) were found to have antibodies. Sixteen of those had donor-specific A, B, or DR antibodies (DSA), while 26 had non-donor specific ab's (NDSA). Sixty patients had only DP, DQ, Cw, or MICA antibodies, and were grouped into \"Donor-specificity unknown\", as these typing were not available at the time of this report. Table 1 summarizes the antibody groups and transplant outcome one year later. Interestingly, the mean serum creatinine values at the time of antibody testing were very similar among the groups, regardless of the presence of antibody or the type (ranged 1.34 to 1.73mg/dL). One year later, however, a striking 63% of DSA patients had either returned to hemodialysis, were regrafted, had died, or had biopsy-proven chronic rejection, compared to only 23% in NDSA patients and 13% in those who were negative (DSA vs. Neg, p=0.00009). MICA antibodies also showed significant association with graft failure or CAN (p=0.03), and donor MICA typing is underway. Conclusion: In this prospective study of 350 renal patients, DSA detected posttransplantation were highly correlated with chronic rejection. Inclusion of specificity analysis in post-transplant antibody monitoring would significantly improve the predictability of chronic rejection.",

This study examines the contribution of donor CD4 T cells within heart allografts to the development of graft vasculopathy, by providing help to recipient B cells for generating effector autoantibody responses. B6 mice were transplanted with MHC class II-disparate bm12 hearts. The allo-and auto-antibody responses were quantified, and their contribution to allograft vasculopathy assessed by incorporating B cell deficient mice as recipients. The role of donor CD4 T cells in providing help for autoantibody was examined by removing CD4 T cells from donor hearts before transplantation by three approaches: treating with anti-CD4 mAb, administering 1300Gy lethal irradiation, and using bm12 donors that are genetically deficient in T cells. The contribution of donor CD4 T cells to autoanitbody development was further assessed by challenge with bm12 CD4 T cells two weeks prior to transplantation. Bm12 heart grafts developed progressive vasculopathy and were rejected slowly (MST=95 days, n=17). The contribution of antibody-mediated effector mechanisms was confirmed by histopathological evidence (fibrinoid necrosis and vascular proliferation), by complement C4d staining, and by a reduction in the severity of vasculopathy and long-term graft survival in B cell deficient recipients. Surprisingly, no alloantibody was detected, but recipients instead developed autoantibody. The autoantibody response was completely dependent upon the provision of help from donor CD4 T cells; it was abrogated by transplanting CD4 T cell deficient hearts. To further confirm an effector role for autoantibody in vasculopathy development, B6 mice were primed for humoral autoimmunity, but not for alloimmunity, by injecting with highly purified bm12 CD4 T cells prior to transplantation. Heart grafts were rejected more rapidly (MST=29 days, n=4, p<0.0001), and demonstrated severe vasculopathy. Finally, BM-chimeric recipients that lacked MHC class II expression only on B cells did not develop autoantibody, suggesting that cognate interaction between the donor CD4 T cells and MHC class II of recipient B cells is crucial for post-transplant humoral autoimmunity. Our results demonstrate the novel finding that help for autoantibody production is provided by graft-versus-host cognate recognition of recipient B cell MHC class II by donor CD4 T cells. This autoantibody contributes to the development of vasculopathy independently of alloantibody.",

Chadban. 1 1 Collaborative Transplantation Research Group/Renal Medicine, University of Sydney/RPAH, Sydney, NSW, Australia. Toll like receptors (TLRs) are innate immune receptors that play an important role in innate immunity but also provide a link between innate and adaptive immunity. MyD88 is a key TLR signal adaptor. A recent clinical study reported that activation of innate immunity in heart-transplantation recipients through TLR4 contributes to the development of chronic rejection after cardiac transplantation. In this study, we aimed to determine whether TLR4-MyD88 signaling is required for the development of chronic allograft damage using TLR4 -/and MyD88 -/mice in a murine model of chronic cardiac allograft rejection. Methods: Cardiac transplants were performed: B6.C-H-2 bm12 (B6.H-2 bm12 ) hearts to WT, MyD88 -/and TLR4 -/mice (all C57BL/6-H-2 b -single MHC class II mismatch) as allografts (n = 6-8/group) and C57BL/6 to C57BL/6 isografts (n = 5). Blood and tissue were harvested at day 49 after transplantation. Cell infiltration, fibrosis and vasculopathy were assessed histologically (grade 0 -5). CD4 + Foxp3 + cells in the blood and spleen were measured by flow cytometry analysis. Results: All hearts remained pulsatile until sacrifice. Histology of TLR4 -/and MyD88 -/recipients showed protection from leukocyte infiltration (1.2\u00b11.1&1.0\u00b11.1vs 3.2\u00b11.4, p < 0.01), fibrosis (0.75\u00b11.0& 0.6\u00b11.2 vs 2.6\u00b12.0, p < 0.05) and vasculopathy (0.28\u00b10.6 & 0.04\u00b10.1 vs 1.9\u00b12.2) at day 49 post transplantation compared to WT recipients. By FACS, the ratio of CD4 + FoxP3 + regulatory T (Treg) cells to total CD4 + cells at day 49 post transplantation in spleen was significantly increased in TLR4 -/and MyD88 -/recipients versus WT allograft and isograft mice (18.1\u00b10.2 & 19\u00b10.9% vs 12.9 \u00b11.1 & 11.8\u00b10.2 %, P <0.01). Conclusion: Absence of TLR4 and MyD88 signaling reduces chronic allograft damage in a murine model of chronic cardiac rejection. One mechanism of protection may be enhancement of regulatory T cell function. Promotion of Treg generation via the TLR4/ MyD88 pathway may be one important consequence of cross-talk between innate and adaptive immunity.",

Thibaut Quillard, 1 St\u00e9phanie Coupel, 1 Flora Coulon, 1 Juliette Fitau, 1 Maria-Cristina Cuturi, 1 Elise Chiffoleau, 1 B\u00e9atrice Charreau. 1 1 INSERM U643, ITERT, Nantes, France. Endothelial cell (EC) activation, injury and apoptosis are the key events associated with transplant arteriosclerosis (TA) and chronic allograft rejection (CR). Notch is a major signalling pathway controlling vascular function and injury. Nonetheless, the involvement of Notch, at endothelial level, in both TA initiation and progression remains unknown. Using a fully MHC mismatched rat cardiac allograft model of CR, we found that TA at Day100 correlates with a strong decrease in both expression and activity of the Notch pathway in transplant as compared to tolerant and syngeneic controls. The present study investigates the contribution of Notch activity to EC survival. In this purpose, a recombinant adenovirus, encoding the Notch2 intracellular Domain (NICD) and the reporter GFP cDNAs was constructed and used to maintain Notch activity in cultured primary human arterial EC. Our results demonstrate that NICD protects EC from cell death induced by TNF\u03b1 in the presence of CHX or by ano\u00efkis as measured by AnnexinV and DNA content staining. NICD mediates cytoprotection through the regulation of key-apoptosis molecules. Using an apoptosis-dedicated qPCR array, we found that 14 out of a panel of 88 apoptosis-related genes were significantly regulated. NICD upregulated Bcl2, Bcl2A1and Bcl-xl (2.5-, 8.2-and 2.8-fold compared to noninfected cells, respectively). In addition, pro-apoptotic genes Bim, Drp1, Bok and CD40 were markedly downregulated in transduced cells (6.7-, 11.4-, 3.9-and 14 .5-fold decrease, respectively). Western blotting analysis confirmed the induction of protective molecules (Bcl2 and Bcl-xl) and the inhibition of pro-apoptotic proteins (bad, bak and bax). Consistent with these data, NICD conducted phosphorylation of Akt as well as a reduction of PTEN expression, suggesting that the cytoprotective activity of NICD may be mediated by recruitment of the PI3K survival pathway. To conclude, our findings indicate that TA correlates with a decreased Notch signaling in transplant and that activation of the Notch pathway in vascular EC prevents apoptosis by promoting protective gene expression and survival pathway. These data suggest that controlling Notch activity may prevent EC dysfunction associated with TA and CR.",

Tullius. 1 1 Div. of Transplant Surg, BWH, Transplant Surg Res Lab, Boston; 2 Dept. of Surgery, Charite Berlin, Germany. Increasing numbers of organs from elderly donors are currently utilized for transplantation. Advanced donor age may not only be associated with physiological impairments but also with a modified immune response of the recipient. We hypothesized a more potent early immune response following the transplantation of elderly donor organs and we analyzed the immune response in a mouse heart transplant model. Young B6 mice received heart allografts from 3, 12 and 18mths old bm12 donors. The recipients immune response and intragraft changes were analyzed. Elderly, non-manipulated hearts contained overall significantly elevated frequencies of CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells and DCs (CD11c + ) (18mths vs. 3mths: CD4 + : 2.77% vs. 1.35%, CD8 + : 3.90% vs 1.71%, CD11c + : 46.1% vs.11.8%, p<0.05). Following engraftment of 18mths old heart grafts numbers of activated DC's (CD11c + I-A b+ and CD11c + CD40 + ) had significantly increased in recipient spleens (day 14:p<0.05). In parallel, frequencies of effector/memory phenotype T-cells (CD4 + CD44 high CD62L low and CD8 + CD44 high CD62L low ) were significantly elevated with increasing age (3 vs. 12 vs, 18mths: CD8 + CD44 high CD62L low :6.7% vs. 8.4% vs. 12.2%, respectively, p< 0.01). In addition, Tregs (CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + ) were also elevated (3 vs. 12 vs, 18mths: 2.9%vs.9.6%vs.11%,p<0.05) T-cell alloreactivity, as measured by IFN\u03b3-production, increased with donor age (3mths vs. 12mths vs.18mths: 24.4\u00b11.5 vs 74.4\u00b121.9 vs. 73.2\u00b17.8 IFN\u03b3-producing spots/5x10 6 cells, p<0.05). Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction (MLR) at day 14 revealed a gradual increase in splenocyte proliferation with advancing donor age (p=0.0002) indicating an enhanced immunogenicity of older organs. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed augmented CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell infiltrates and an intense Ki67 positivity of GICs in 18mths old heart grafts, emphasizing an intensified immune response towards organs from old donors. In summary, old native heart transplants contain an overall higher number of passenger leukocytes contributing to an increased immunogenicity of these organs. After transplantation, a more potent DC and T-cell activation and intragraft T-cell infiltration was observed in elderly organs.",

Shannon Reese, 1 Madhu Adulla, 1 Surmeet Bedi, 1 Jose Torrealba, 1 Deb Hullett, 1 Arjang Djamali. 1 1 Nephrology, UW Madison, Madison, WI. To determine the role of oxidative stress (OS) in kidney allograft fibrosis, we are developing strategies that would decrease the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) instead of using ROS scavengers, the standard approach to antioxidant therapy so far. We therefore started to examine the expression of NADPH oxidase (Nox) subunits (Nox2, Nox4, p22 and p47phox) and their distribution in human and rat kidney allografts with chronic interstitial fibrosis (IFTANOS). Using double-staining immunofluorescent studies in human allografts (n=16) we showed that Nox2 was present in injured tubules costained with \u03b1SMA ( Figure 1.1) Similarly, interstitial macrophages (CD68 + -Nox2 + ) and myofibroblasts (\u03b1SMA + -Nox2 + ) but not CD3 + T cells or S100A4 + fibroblasts expressed high Nox2 levels, suggesting that Nox is involved in the pathogenesis of allograft fibrosis via epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT), macrophage and myofibroblasts activation. We then examined the coexpression of Nox2, Nox4 and p22phox in normal and transplant kidneys with IFTANOS and showed that these molecules were upregulated in the latter group and that Nox2 and Nox4 were associated with p22phox expression. These results were confirmed in the Fisher to Lewis rat kidney transplant model (Figure 1 .2). Immunoblot analyses at 3 weeks and 6 months showed that Nox4 and Nox2 levels were increased in the allogeneic (n=7) compared to syngeneic transplants (n=3). Greater Nox levels were Composite Tissue Allotransplantation (CTA) is a recently introduced option for limb replacement and reconstruction of tissue defects. As other allografts, a CTA grafts can undergo immune-mediated rejection, and standardized criteria are required for characterizing and reporting severity and types of rejection. This manuscript documents the conclusions of a symposium on CTA rejection held at the Ninth Banff Conference on Allograft Pathology in La Coruna, Spain on June 26, 2007, and proposes a working classification scheme, the Banff CTA-07, for the categorization of CTA rejection. This classification was derived from public international consensus discussions regarding all published scoring systems for CTA rejection. Given the current limited clinical experience in CTA, a formal histological classification was established for acute skin rejection with the understanding that other types of rejection involving other tissues will be developed with periodic review of this emerging field. It was agreed that the defining features to diagnose acute skin rejection would include inflammatory cell infiltration with epidermal and/or adnexal structure involvement, epithelial apoptosis, dyskeratosis, and necrosis, and that severity of rejection will be graded under five categories. This classification refines proposed schemas, represents international consensus on this topic, and establishes a working collective classification system for CTA reporting.",

Kleinert Institute, Louisville, KY; 2 Kleinert Kutz and Associates, Louisville, KY; 3 Jewish Hospital Transplant Center, Louisville, KY; 4 Surgery, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY. Aim: Traditionally allograft biopsy has dictated treatment of allograft rejection. We hypothesize that histological grade of the biopsy may over diagnose rejection in CTA Hand CTA is unique in that the organ is external and early signs of rejection can be viewed directly. Skin is the first tissue in the CTA graft to show rejection. Methods: For this study, rejection by defined by requirement of treatment. These episodes were compared with histological grade, and hand appearance. We reviewed 127 skin biopsies taken during 9, 7 and 1 years of follow up. Results: Three observations surfaced. First, a rejection grading scale for CTA is still evolving. A review of the literature showed at least four different criteria are in use. The criteria used to grade biopsies at our center changed over the 9 year follow up. Bias towards calling higher grades of rejection, and more aggressive treatment occurred in the first two patients. A re-read of random biopsies taken from the first two patients showed a down-grade of rejection to grade II or I in five cases. Secondly, concomitant CMV infection in the last patient prevented the aggressive treatment of rejection. Despite high grade histology, the swelling, rash and redness responded to topical immunosuppression. Systemic treatment was not necessary. Analysis indicated that swelling and/or rash, and the percentage of skin involvement seemed to be more informative markers of existing (or resolving) alloreactivity than was histology. The biopsies taken from the graft shown below showed a grade III histology.",

Introduction: To understand in greater depth the molecular mechanisms involved in skin rejection in hand transplantation, we investigated 8 key molecular markers of lymphocyte trafficking, cellular rejection and antibody mediated rejection in human hand transplantation. Methods: A total of 130 skin biopsies taken from three bilateral hand transplants were assessed by H&E histology (grades as per previously a published classification 0-4b) as well as immunohistochemistry using antibodies for following markers: Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen (LFA)-1 = CD11a, Intercellular Adhesion Molecule (ICAM)-1 = CD54, Selectin E = CD62E, Selectin P = CD62P, VE-Cadherin = CD144, Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) II (DP, DQ, DR), Psoriasin = S100A7 and C4d. Levels of expression were assessed (0, +, ++, +++) and read in the light correlated with the rejection as well as time after transplantation. Results: Rrejection ranged between grade 0 and 4a with an average score of 0.9. In healthy skin, none of the markers investigated was consistently up-regulated. Upon rejection, CD54, CD62E and CD62P staining in endothelial cells was significantly increased. Expression of CD62E and CD62P correlated well with severity of rejection. The majority of infiltrating lymphocytes stained positive for CD11a. Interestingly, also kerationcytes were highly positive for CD11a at the onset of rejection. CD144 was detected on endothelial cells, but its occurrence did not correlate with rejection. Psoriasin expression was observed in keratinocytes in a basal and focal pattern and correlated well with rejection. For C4d, no consistent staining pattern was observed indicating that antibody mediated rejection did not play a role in these patients. Conclusion: Molecular markers involved in lymphocyte trafficking are up-regulated upon skin rejection after hand transplantation and represent promising target for prophylaxis and treatment of rejection in Composite Tissue Allotransplantation.",

Theresa Hautz, 1 Gerald Brandacher, 1 Bettina Zelger, 2 Hans G. Mueller, 3 Andrew W. P.

Introduction: Skin rejection has complicated the postoperative course in human hand transplantation. To better define the characteristics of the lymphozytic infiltrate human hand transplant biopsies have been investigated for expression of FoxP3 and Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), a key regulatory enzyme to induce T-lymphocyte unresponsiveness. Methods: A total of 104 skin biopsies taken from three bilateral hand transplant recipients during the first 6 years after transplantation were assessed by H&E histology (graded as per previously published classification 0-4b) as well as immunohistochemistry for IDO and FoxP3. Levels of expression were assessed (0, +, ++, +++) and interpreted in the light of clinical courses, time after transplantation, severity of rejection as well as markers for lymphozyte migration. Results: Overall, rejection ranged between grade 0 and 4a with an average score of 0.94. IDO was found constitutively expressed in the endothelium independent of rejection. IDO expression in the cellular infiltrate was significantly increased upon and correlated well with severity of rejection (rejection grade 1, 0.91+/-0.85: rejection grade 3, 2.30+/-0.82 p<0.001). FoxP3 positive T-cells were mainly found in severe rejection (rejection grade 1, 0.14+/-0.35: rejection grade 3, 0.75+/-0.75 p=0.019). IDO expression correlated well with FoxP3 expression, although the overall staining intensity for FoxP3 was lower. A strong tendency towards higher expression of IDO as well as FoxP3 towards later time-points after transplantation was observed (year 1 -FoxP3 0.07+/-0.26, IDO 0.75+ /-0.92 [n=68] , year 3 -FoxP3 0.45+/-0.74, , year 5 -Fox 0.25+/-0.45, ). Expression of IDO correlated closely with expression of E-Selectin, P-Selectin, ICAM1 and LFA-1. Conclusion: Characteristics of the cellular infiltrate indicate a strong tendency towards self limitation of the alloimmune response towards the skin with both time after transplantation as well as severity of rejection in human hand transplantation. Further studies are warranted to clarify the clinical relevance of these findings.",

Minimization of immunosuppression is an important goal in all transplant recipients. Currently there are no accurate tools to evaluate the immunological responsiveness which might help tailor the level of immunosuppression for an individual patient. The response of recipient lymphocytes to PHA, Candida, and alloantigen may represent laboratory tool towards this end. It has been reported that these 3 responses are hierarchical with response to alloantigen being the first to be lost, followed by candida and finally PHA.",

            "text": "A 54 year old male received a proximal forearm transplant in November 2006. Immunosuppression included induction with a single 30 mg dose of alemtuzumab and maintenance with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. The patient developed an episode of cytomegalovirus infection followed by acute rejection after reduction of his immunosuppression during the 3 rd post-operative month. These were successfully treated with Ganciclovir and topical tacrolimus & steroids respectively. Blood samples were drawn at selected time points, and subjected to phenotyping of lymphocyte subsets and immune monitoring for circulating peripheral blood regulatory T cells (T reg ) and proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin (PHA), candida, and alloantigen. Results: Alemtuzumab induction resulted in profound lymphopenia. At week 2 and 1 month, the response to PHA was intact (stimulation index 110 and 24 respectively), but response to alloantigen and candida suppressed (SI <3). A similar immunologic profile persisted up through 6 months. At 1 year, the PHA and candida responses are robust (SI 69 and 38 respectively), but alloresponses have not returned. Current immunosuppression consists of tacrolimus (6-9 ng/ml) and mycophenolate mofetil (500 mg b.i.d.). There is no gross evidence of acute or chronic rejection. Conclusions: Induction with alemtuzumab alters the recovery of immune response: recovery to candida was delayed beyond 6 months and to alloantigens beyond a year. In light of this, further reduction of immunosuppression may be contemplated in future hand transplants without the risk of rejection. Composite tissue allotransplantation has achieved significant clinical advances despite an adequate preclinical model to study technical and immunosuppressive strategies. We have developed a non-human primate model of facial composite tissue allografts (CTA). Unilateral lower hemi-facial CTA (bone, muscle, skin) transplants were performed between mismatched cynomolgus monkeys. Immunosuppression consisted of 28 days of continuous IV tacrolimus monotherapy followed by tapered daily IM doses. Six animals received prophylactic gancyclovir. All animals had serial transplant biopsies. Ten transplants have been performed, with one loss secondary to line infection on day 27 without evidence of rejection. Two CTAs had evidence of chronic rejection (day 56, 99); with development of alloantibody after 30 days. Five CTAs had prolonged survival (day 60, 86, 108, 150, 177) , but developed PTLDs resulting in experimental endpoints. All animals had clinically normal grafts, but 3 animals showed histological evidence of mild rejection not treated with any additional immunosuppressive therapy. PTLD tumors were analyzed using short tandem repeats (STR) to define donor or recipient origin. STR analysis demonstrated donor origin of 4 PTLD tumors and recipient origin in 1 animal. None of the PTLD animals had clinical evidence of rejection of skin, bone, or muscle. EBV was not detected in the serum of 2 tested animals, and ganciclovir therapy had no effect on the development of tumors. Tacrolimus levels of PTLD animals were higher than animals with rejected grafts (45 vs. 34 ng/mL; p=0.02). Two additional animals have healthy grafts (day 24+, 52+) without evidence of rejection or PTLD, and have been converted to rapamycin after day 28. We have developed a preclinical model for facial CTA transplantation that achieves prolonged graft survivals with tacrolimus monotherapy. The high incidence of PTLD tumors of donor origin represents an outcome similar to bone marrow transplantation in contrast to its rarity in solid organ transplantation. Our findings are a cautionary note regarding CTAs that include vascularized bone elements. Immunosuppressive protocol modifications have been made in an effort to decrease the incidence of these donor-derived PTLDs.",

Heterotopic heart transplantation (HHT) is utilized in patients (pts) who do not qualify for standard orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). Specific indications include refractory pulmonary hypertension and a donor-recipient size mismatch. The objective of this study was to analyze the UNOS database and compare outcomes of HHT to OHT. The UNOS database with more than 58000 pts undergoing thoracic organ transplantation in the U.S. between 1987 and 2007 was reviewed (based on OPTN data as of May 1, 2007) . Primary endpoint of this study was overall survival and subgroup survival [pts with transpulmonary gradient (TPG)>15, ischemic (ICM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)]. Secondary endpoint was assessment of pretransplant criteria. Exclusion criteria were retransplantation and missing transplant dates. Of 41379 who underwent OHT and 178 who underwent HHT, 32361 and 111 respectively, were enrolled in this study. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Survival after OHT is superior to HHT. This survival benefit however, disappears in pts with a TPG>15. Overall the survival after HHT is superior to the reported survival in pts who undergo LVAD implantation as destination treatment (REMATCH-trial/1year survival of 52%). Thus in selected pts, especially those with elevated TPGs, HHT should be considered a viable option with overall good results.",

Sibley Heart Center Cardiology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA. Ventricular assist devices (VADs) allow children with severe heart failure to be bridged to successful heart transplantation (HT). VADs are being used with increasing frequency in the pediatric population and newer devices allow even young infants to be supported. VAD implantation and maintenance, however, is quite expensive and the cost-effectiveness of VAD use in adults has been questioned. To date, an economic analysis of VAD support in children has not been undertaken. Methods: We used Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS), an administrative database of the Child Health Corporation of America (a consortium of Children's Hospitals in North America), to determine the costs related to VAD use in children. Data on subjects <18 yrs of age from 2002-2007 were reviewed. Hospital charges were converted to costs based on hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratios. Projected survival for subjects who were successfully bridged to HT was derived from published data. Costutility was expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved, expressed in 2006 US dollars. All future costs and benefits were discounted at 3%. Results: The median age at implantation from the PHIS database was 11.2 years, range 2 days to 17 yrs. The mean hospital cost per patient was $522,489. Estimated survival to heart transplantation was 77% and estimated successful explantation without transplantation was 4%. The calculated cost-utility for VAD as a bridge to transplantation was $123,232 /QALY saved. If one assumes that the children who survived to VAD explantation would otherwise have a high risk of hospital death (65%) without VAD support, then the calculated cost-utility would be $117,235/ QALY saved. Even if Abstracts survival to transplantation exceeds 90%, VAD implantation does not achieve a favorable cost-utility ratio. VAD support in pediatric heart only becomes cost-effective if recovery and explantation can be achieved in over 22% of subjects. Conclusions: VAD supports serves as an effective bridge to heart transplantation in children. However, the cost-utility of this strategy is above the generally accepted threshold for cost-effectiveness ($100,000/QALY). In a setting of limited healthcare resources VAD as a bridge to transplantation may not be justified. Purpose: Heart transplantation (tx) in patients with HLA sensitization presents challenges in organ allocation. Virtual crossmatch (vXM), in which recipient HLA antibodies, identified by LabScreen PRA beads, are compared to the prospective donor HLA-type, could increase the use of allografts from distant donors (DD). Accuracy of vXM and outcomes of this approach in heart tx are not known. Methods and Materials: To increase time-efficiency at the time of organ allocation, crossmatch testing is frequently initiated on pre-set trays which contain sera of multiple prospective sensitized recipients. We used results from these studies to determine expected accuracy of vXM. We assessed outcomes of allocation algorithm implemented in 2001 in sensitized patients. Conventional prospective crossmatch was done when allografts were procured from local donors (LD), while vXM was utilized when allografts were offered from DD.",

Purpose: In July 2006, United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) implemented a new allocation system for adult heart transplant (tx) candidates with the following sequence: Local Status 1A\u2192Local Status 1B\u2192Zone A Status 1A\u2192Zone A Status 1B\u2192Local Status 2. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of new system on heart tx patients at a single center in region 7. Methods: Patients transplanted during 1 year (y) prior to new system (7-11-05 to 7-11-06, Group 1, N=19) and 1 y following new system (7-12-06 to 7-12-07,Group 2, N=26) were compared for UNOS status at the time of transplant, waiting time, ischemia time, length of the hospital stay (LOS) before and after transplant, donor age, procurement-team travel distance and cost. Results: New system significantly decreased median waiting time, but increased median ischemia time without affecting short-term survival: 1 patient died in each group. Number of transplants increased 37% in Group 2 mostly due to increased number of Status 1A patients supported by IABP without change in number of Status 1B and 2 patients. Median pre-transplant LOS increased 16-fold in Group 2 (p=0.072), whereas mean pre-transplant LOS increased by 5 days. In Group 2, thirteen patients had donor heart procured in Zone A and thirteen patients had donor heart procured locally, whereas in Group 1, all donor hearts were procured locally. Median procurement-team travel distance increased 15-fold and median travel cost 10-fold in Group 2 (p<0.05). ",

Survival rates were initially higher for kidney recipients with rates for SHK similar to heart recipients. The hazard ratio (HR) for graft loss was higher for SHK recipients compared to kidney, but lower when compared to heart recipients. The lower hazard for SHK in heart allografts might be attributed to risk associated with pretransplant dialysis (HR=4.09, 3.81-4.39, P<0.001) . Approximately 10% (2,122) of cardiac transplant recipients initiated dialysis prior to transplantation. The differing rates of SHK rejection observed in the heart and kidney analytic files might be attributed to susceptibility or treatment of heart and kidney allografts, rejection monitoring or reporting.

Clinical trial has shown that FTY720 produced dose-limiting toxicity-bradycardia, due to its effect on S1P 3 receptor. We have tested the effect of KRP203 on the survival of islet allografts either alone or combined with local delivery of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + T regulatory (Treg) cells. Previous studies using knockout mice have documented a key role for the integrin CD103 in promoting allograft rejection. These data are consistent with a critical role for CD103 expressing cells in this process. However, a direct test of this hypothesis has proven problematic due to the lack of mAbs that efficiently deplete CD103 + cells in wild type hosts. To circumvent this problem, we conjugated the non-depleting anti-CD103 mAb, M290, to the toxin, saporin (SAP), to produce an immunotoxin (M290-SAP) that selectively depletes CD103-expressing cells in vivo. Treatment of naive mice with M290-SAP selectively depleted CD103 + CD8 + cells and dramatically reduced the overall frequency of CD8 + lymphocytes in diverse compartment including intestinal intraepithelial lymphcyte,spleen and mesenteric lymph node. M290-SAP also depleted CD103 + dendritic cells (CD11c + ) and T regulatory cells (Tregs, CD4 + CD25 + ) in the above compartments. In the thymus, M290-SAP depleted CD103-expressing cells in both CD4 -CD8and CD4 -CD8 + subpopulations, both of which express CD103, leading to a dramatic reduction in the number of thymocytes(77.08 \u00b1 5.74 \u00d710 6 vs. 2.71 \u00b1 0.82 \u00d710 6 , P<0.0001, in control vs. treated respectively). We next assessed the effect of M290-SAP in a fully allogeneic islet transplantation model (Balb/c\u2192C57BL/6). M290-SAP produced long-term (LT) graft survival (>100d, n=9,vs. untreated median survival time 13d, n=8 ). Unconjugated M290 or isotype control (IgG-SAP) did not significantly prolong islet allograft survival. Graft histology showed little, if any, lymphocyte infiltration surrouding islet transplants in LT mice. In contrast, intense lymphocyte infiltration with disruption of islet morphology was observed in untreated mice. Pretreatment of donor islets with M290-SAP did not significantly prolong allograft survival indicating that the immunosuppressive effect of M290-SAP resides at the level of host. Interestingly, we found a 3-4 fold increase in both percentage and number of FoxP3 + CD4 + CD25 + cells in the spleen and draining lymph node from LT mice, though it remains to be determined whether such cells account for graft acceptance in M290-SAP treated recipients. In summary, these data document that depletion of CD103 expressing cells promotes long-term islet allograft survival. These findings point to a novel strategy for therapeutic intervention in islet allograft rejection.",

All the islets (n=23) engineered with SA-FasL survived over the observation period of 100-400 days without detectable signs of rejection. In marked contrast, all the unmodified (n=9) and SA-engineered (n=14) islets underwent acute rejection within 40 days. The observed tolerance was localized to the engineered islets as unmodified second set of islets transplanted under contralateral kidney of long-term (>90 days) graft recipients were rejected in a normal tempo (MST=17 \u00b1 9 days) without any effect on the survival of primary islets. Conclusions: Engineering pancreatic islets with exogenous immunomodulatory molecules, such as SA-FasL, in a rapid (\u223c 2 hrs) and efficient (100% of targeted islets) manner represents a novel means of immunomodulation with considerable therapeutic potential for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Supported in parts by NIH (R21 DK61333, R01 AI47864, R21 AI057903, R21 HL080108), JDRF (1-2001-328) The ability of embryonic stem (ES) cells to form cells and tissues from all three germ layers can be exploited for the generation of cells that can be used to treat diseases. In particular, successful generation of hematopoietic cells from ES cells could provide safer and less immunogenic cells than bone marrow cells, that require severe host preconditioning, when transplanted across MHC barriers. In the past, it has been difficult to derive hematopoietic cells from ES cells. It has now become clear that this was due to the lack of self-renewal properties by these newly developed progenitor cells. Here, we exploited the self-renewal properties of ectopically expressed HOXB4, a homeobox transcription factor, to generate hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) that successfully induce high level mixed chimerism and long-term engraftment in recipient mice. HOXB4-transduced 129SvJ ES cells (H2 b ) were allowed to form embryoid bodies. These were dismantled after 5 days and the cells treated with a cocktail of hematopoietic cytokines. By day 26, ES cells had formed HPCs. These newly generated HPCs were CD45+, CD34+, CD117+ but poorly expressed MHC class I molecules and no class II. The HPCs fully restored splenic architecture in Rag2 -/-\u03b3 c -/immunodeficient mice, Abstracts comparable to bone marrow. Additionally, HPC-derived newly generated T cells were able to mount a peptide-specific response to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and specifically secreted IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 upon CD3 stimulation. Further, HPC-derived antigen presenting cells (APCs) in chimeric mice efficiently presented viral antigen to wild type (WT) T cells. In syngeneic recipient mice, HPCs engrafted and formed more robust T and B cell populations. The majority of the HPC-derived cells were however, Gr-1 + , suggesting a bias towards myeloid cells by the HOXB4. Interestingly, these cells successfully engrafted in allogenic MRL (H2 k ) and Balb/c (H2 d ) recipients without the need for immunosuyprresion. This ability to form mixed chimerism across MHC barriers is a consequence of their lack of MHC, CD80 and CD86 expression. Our results demonstrate for the first time that leukocytes derived from ES cells ectopically expressing HOXB4 are immunologically functional and escape immunological rejection when transplanted across MHC barriers allowing the induction of mixed chimerism.",

Plasma factor VIII activity (Coamatic assay) fully normalized to that of wild type mice and has remained stable over 60 days. These data suggest that ES cell-derived DE progenitor cells can restore factor VIII activity in hemophilia A mouse model, presumably through protein production in de novo generated hepatocytes. More importantly, none of these animals developed teratomas. Thus, ES-cell derived cells can potentially be coaxed to form cellular transplants with curative capabilities. Objective: We have established a novel approach, ProtEx, to rapidly and efficiently engineer primary cells, tissues, or organs to display on their surface exogenous proteins of interest for immunomodulation. This approach involves generation of chimeric proteins with core streptavidin, biotinylation of cells, and the transient display of chimeric proteins on the cell surface. In this study, we displayed a chimeric form of FasL (SA-FasL) on the surface of bone marrow cells and tested the efficacy of these cells to establish mixed chimerism in allogeneic hosts under nonmyeloablative conditions. Methods: BALB/c bone marrow cells were engineered with SA-FasL and 30 million of these cells were transplanted into C57BL/6 mice subjected to various doses of total body irradiation 2 days earlier. A short course of rapamycin was used to enhance the tolerogenic effect of SA-FasL. Bone marrow cell recipients were typed for multilineage chimerism at various times post-transplantation and tested for donor-specific tolerance using skin grafts. Results: All the animals (n=8) treated with 300 cGy total body irradiation and transplanted with SA-FasL-engineered donor cells showed significant levels of chimerism (10-60%) on day 14 post-transplantation that showed a steady increase overtime and reached to 40-90% on day 60 post-transplantation. In marked contrast, none of the control animals (n=11) receiving bone marrow cells and a short course of rapamycin showed detectable chimerism. Chimerism was multilineage and associated with donor specific tolerance since chimeric animals accepted donor, but rejected third party skin grafts. Conclusions: Engineering bone marrow cells in a rapid (\u223c2 hrs) and efficient (100% targeted cells) manner with exogenous proteins having immunoregulatory functions provides a new and effective means of immunomodulation to establish mixed allogeneic chimerism under nonmyeloablative conditions with significant potential in clinical bone marrow transplantation.

Chronic allograft dysfunction is still a major clinical problem in organ transplantation. Morphologically it is characterized by changes suggestive of an alloantibody mediated mechanism such as glomerulopathy and vasculopathy or by non-specific changes such as interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Alloantigen dependent as well as -independent factors contribute to the pathogenesis of these changes. In this study we analysed allospecific T cells from the peripheral blood of kidney transplant patients under different immunosuppressive protocols with or without chronic allograft dysfunction. 107 renal allograft recipients of our renal transplant clinic were screened at least six months after transplantation. All patients were on a calcineurin-based immunosuppressive protocol consisting of cyclosporine (CsA)/mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)/Steroid, Tacrolimus (Tac)/MMF/Steroid, or CsA/Steroid. Patients had to be mismatched for one or more of the five candidate HLA-DR antigens for which synthetic peptides were available (DR1, DR2, DR3, DR4, and DR7). Patients with biopsy proven chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN)with an elevated serum creatinine level of \u22651.6 mg/dl were compared with patients with stable allograft function (serum creatinine <1.6 mg/dl). T cell lines were generated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of renal transplant recipients against donor-derived HLA-DR peptides presented by self APC. T cell lines generated from patients with CAN produced significantly more IFN-\u03b3, while those generated from stable patients produced IL-10 associated with a low proliferation index in response to the donor-derived mismatched HLA-DR allopeptide in vitro. Moreover, significantly more CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells were found in stable patients on Tac and MMF as compared to patients on CsA and MMF. Interestingly, a higher gene expression of CD4, CD25, CTLA-4, Foxp3, and IL-10 was observed in those patients. Taken together a Th1 (IFN-\u03b3) alloimmune response is deleterious and promotes chronic graft damage, while a Th2 (IL-10) response seems to be associated with a lower incidence of chronic allograft nephropathy. An immunosuppression based on Tac and MMF seems to favour CD4+CD25+Fosp3+ T cells and to allow long-term engraftment with stable renal function.",

In the CsA group, the Vim and Cat scores had progressed between 3 and 12 months from 1. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) are efficacious but nephrotoxic immunosuppressives. Arteriolar hyalinosis is one of the characteristic histological correlates of this toxicity. Yet, time course of this lesion, its reversibility, dose-dependency and the discrimination between drug-related effects, diabetic and hypertensive vasculopathy remain unclear. Aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and time course of CNI-related vascular changes after renal transplantation (tx) in protocol (pBx) as well as in indication biopsies (iBx) and to correlate this to the CNI blood levels, blood pressure and diabetes. From 491 patients, a total number of 1239 pBx, taken at 6 weeks (n=380), 3 (n=420) and 6 months (n=439) after tx and 360 iBx were classified according to Banff-criteria. Assessement of CNI toxicity included: isometric vacuolisation of tubules (ISOVAC), intimal arteriolar hyalinosis (IAH) and nodular arteriolar hyalinosis (NAH) and vacuolisation of small vessel smooth muscle cells (VSM). 96% of patients received either cyclosporine or tacrolimus. In pBx, ISOVAC was present in 15%, 17% and 15% of patients at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months post-tx, respectively; IAH in 11%, 9% and 10%; NAH in 5%, 5% and 7%; VSM in 19%, 19% and 15%. In late iBx (>2 years post-tx) the prevalence of the analyzed parameters apart from ISOVAC (9%) was markedly higher: 42% for IAH, 22% for NAH and 38% for VSM. In pBx, VSM, IAH and NAH were associated with each other but not significantly dependenct on blood pressure, rejection episodes or diabetes. Through levels of CNIs were not different between patients with and without vascular hyalinosis. In patients with VSM and IAH in late iBx one third had these lesions already present in earlier biopsies. Conclusion: The prevalence of presumed morphological signs for vascular CNI-toxicity in pBx is low and constant and apparently, not associated with CNI blood levels, hypertension or diabetes. In contrast, in iBx later than two years after transplantation, prevalence of vascular CNI-toxicity signs is much higher. This emphasises that CNI reduction protocols should be regarded within the first six months after transplantation, when vascular changes are still marginal. Further elucidation of precursor lesions in pBx would help to find out patients at risk for CNI-induced vascular changes.",

Success has been reported with donor stem cell transfusion in animal studies and prevention of chronic rejection in cardiac allograft recipients in the clinic. This report details the results of the initial phase of a study in humans. Methods: A prospective phase I/II FDA approved pilot protocol was initiated to evaluate the effects of donor graft facilitating cell (FC)/stem cell infusion in kidney transplant recipients. Conditioning was performed with 200 cGy of total body irradiation. Bone marrow processed to remove GVHD-producing cells but retain CD8 + /TCR -FC and stem cells was infused 24 hours post-operatively. The dosage of stem cells was limited by the T cell dosage. The starting dose was 1 x 10 5 T cells. This was increased in steps of 2 x 10 5 per patient. As the study spans a 7-year period, the immunosuppression changed: 3 patients received cyclosporine (CyA), MMF and Prednisone; 3 were induced with Basiliximab and maintained on CyA(2)/FK(1), Cellcept and Prednisone; and 3 received Alemtuzumab induction and maintenance with FK and MMF. All patients underwent tolerance testing and immunoprofiling studies. Results: Of the 9 patients, 6 received live donor kidney transplants. One graft was lost from arterial thrombosis on day 2. Delayed graft function was seen in 3 patients. Good long-term graft function was seen in the other 8 patients. Acute rejection was noted only in 1 and infectious complications (CMV-1, Histoplasma-1) in 2 patients. Two patients died with functioning grafts -one at 4 years from lung cancer and another from complications from diabetes at 6 years. Six patients are alive with functioning grafts at mean follow-up of 4.3 years with a mean creatinine of 1.3 mg/dl. No GVHD was detected in any of the patients. Macrochimerism was not detected in any of the patients at any point. Notably, in spite of the fact that durable engraftment was not yet achieved, none of the patients were sensitized as a result nor did they experience immunologic sequelae. Conclusions: In our patients there were no untoward sequelae related to either the conditioning regimen or marrow infusion. The incidence of acute rejection even on longterm follow up has been low. We currently propose to reduce the immunosuppression further in these patients.",

We report here our 5 year experience. Methods: We performed 411 consecutive unselected LDKT (donor kidneys were removed laparoscopically) from 12/11/2002 to 11/26/2007 using 30 mg (0.5mg/kg) alemtuzumab and tacrolimus monotherapy. At 6 months post-transplant and every 2 to 6 months interval, we used clinical data (including ELISA antibody titers, Cylex T-cell activation assay, and identification of donor specific antibodies) to wean tacrolimus when possible (bid-->qd-->qod-->tiw-->biw-->qwk). The recipients included 5 HIV+, 35 pediatric recipients, and 60 re-transplants. The mean follow up was 843.1+478.7 days. Results: Actuarial recipient survivals at 1-, 2-, 3-years were 98.4%, 95.6%, and 92.7%, respectively. Graft survivals at 1-, 2-, 3-years were 97.6%, 90.4%, and 85.4%, respectively.

Given the increased costs of these drugs, the indications for using depleting antibodies in low risk KTRs of SCD kidneys should be further clarified. Kidney transplantation prolongs survival in hepatitis C virus-positive (HCV+) patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, the effects of induction therapy and chronic immunosuppression are unknown on the course of HCV infection and potential for cirrhosis in renal transplantation (RTx) recipients. We have retrospectively assessed parameters of liver function, Child-Pugh (CP) and MELD scores in HCV+ ESRD patients who received induction therapy with T-cell depletion (Group 1: Thymoglobulin, n=30) or an IL-2 inhibitor (Group 2: Basiliximab, n=46). Pre-RTx liver biopsies were similar in Group 1 and 2. Patients were followed for a mean of 826 days (range 47 to 2679 days) following RTx and received tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and sometimes steroids post-transplant. Overall graft survival was 84% in Group 1 and 85% in Group 2 (p > 0.05). Data were analyzed pre-RTx, at 30 and 365 days and at time of last follow-up. Serum AST, ALT, platelets, INR, albumin and bilirubin did not change following RTx in either group. CP scores in Group 1 were not significantly changed after RTx (5.5 \u00b1 0.9 to 5.7 \u00b1 0.9 at last follow-up, p=0.53). Group 1 patients on steroid-free protocols (n=8) demonstrated declining CP scores from 6.0 \u00b1 1.0 to 5.3 \u00b1 0.5 at last follow-up that were not statistically significant (p=0.31). Group 1 patients on steroids showed opposite trends of CP: 5.3 \u00b1 0.6 pre-RTx vs 5.8 \u00b1 1.1 at last follow-up that similarly did not reach statistical significance (p=0.18). Group 2 CP scores declined from 5.8 \u00b1 0.8 to 5.4 \u00b1 0.9 at last follow-up (p=0.04). There was no difference between CP or MELD scores at any point between the groups. As expected, MELD scores improved significantly following RTx and remained low up until the final visit (p=0.001); this was attributed to the drop in serum creatinine post-RTx. Neither the use of Thymoglobulin or Basiliximab resulted in acute hepatitis resurgence or the development of cirrhosis post-transplant. We have not identified any association between choice of induction agent or maintenance immunosuppression regimens, including steroid withdrawal, with impaired hepatic function or progression to liver cirrhosis in HCV+ RTx patients. T cell depletion was well-tolerated by HCV+ RTx patients and resulted in good graft outcomes. Interestingly, CP scores declined after renal transplantation in the Basiliximab induction group.",

This may be due to increase use of both induction agents and potent maintenance regimens. This is an important cause for poor long-term graft outcome despite decreasing rejection rates and a balance has to be maintained between prevention of rejection and avoidence of infection. Serum creatinine (Scr) at procurement was 101\u00b151 \u00b5mol/L. The incidence of donor hypertension, diabetes, and death from cerebrovascular origin was 31%, 15%, and 55% respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that the only clinical parameters associated with a low eGFR were donor Scr and donor hypertension. Nyberg or Pessione scores were not significantly associated with a low eGFR. Regarding D0 biopsies, univariate analysis showed that % of sclerotic glomeruli (SG, p=0.02), arteriolar hyalinosis (p=0.03), mean Remuzzi score (p=0.03) and mean CADI score (p=0.04) were all significantly associated with a low eGFR. A logistic regression showed that an integrated score including: i) donor Scr (\u00b1150 \u00b5mol/l), ii) hypertension, and iii) SG (\u00b110%) had the highest performance in predicting a low eGFR at 1 yr compared to clinical or histological parameters alone. Using this composite score, the adjusted OR for the prediction of a low 1-yr eGFR ranged from 1 if none of the 3 factors were present, to 7.1 (if SG >10% was associated with one of the 2 clinical factors), and to 27.5 (if the 3 factors were present, p=0.0003). Conclusion: this study highlights that D0 biopsies are useful to predict graft outcome particularly in MD population, and may perform better than clinical scores alone.

            "text": "Prospective Kidney transplantation from small pediatric donors is increasingly being utilized as a means to optimize the organ supply, however the single most common specified reason for the discard of pediatric kidneys is vascular damage, such as shortening of the suprarenal aorta or injury to the renal artery orifices, which often precludes en bloc transplantation (EBK). At our center, damaged kidneys were salvaged by transplantation as singles (SK BACKGROUND: In an effort to maximize the number of recipients transplanted per donor, transplant centers in our donor service area (DSA) voted to preferentially allocate local and imported en-bloc pediatric donor renal allografts to centers willing to transplant two individuals with single allografts. After 1 year of implementing this policy into action, we report on our initial experience. METHODS: From July 2006 to June 2007 we reviewed our experience with 12 adult single allograft recipients of pediatric donors less than 60 months of age. There were no exclusions based on age or size with exclusion criteria consisting of donor age < 2 months and single allograft size < 5 cm. All but 1 recipient received rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin induction, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and rapid steroid withdrawal. Results from this cohort were compared to 86 consecutive recipients of adult single allografts from standard criteria donors with the same immunosuppression protocol used as historical controls. RESULTS: 12 pediatric single allografts with median donor age of 24 months (range 8-58) were transplanted into 12 adults with median age 46 years (range 24-67). showed that non-white race was associated with increased risk of death (p<0.01). This effect of race was attenuated when LTx center was taken into account [B] . Finally, with the addition of MELD in the model, the effect of race on waitlist mortality all but disappeared [C] . Conclusions: On the surface, minority patients may appear to have higher mortality on LTx waitlist compared to Caucasian counterparts. However, this association is predominantly a result of minority patients having a higher MELD score, although LTx center-specific mortality may contribute. These data suggest that waitlist outcome may be improved by optimizing referral of minority patients. Background: In cirrhotic patients awaiting liver transplantation (LT), low serum sodium (Na) predicts short term pre-LT mortality, independently of MELD. Incorporation of Na into MELD has been recommended to improve prognostic accuracy (MELD-Na; Gastroenterology 130:1652 Gastroenterology 130: , 2006 ). However, short term interventions such as water restriction that improve Na may have little effect on prognosis. Hypothesis: the lowest level of serum sodium in the preceding 30 (Na30), 90 (Na90) or 180 days (Na180) may be better than the current serum sodium (NaC) for predicting pre-LT cirrhotic mortality. Methods: We reviewed electronic records of 764 cirrhotic veterans referred for consideration of LT, 2/28/02-6/30/07. Date of most recent Na at referral was chosen as time zero for determining NaC, Na30, Na90, and Na180 and for assessing subsequent survival. Findings: Within 90 days, 94 patients died pre-LT (12%) and 27 underwent LT (3%). Na at all time points was associated strongly (p<.001) with preLT death (censored at LT). Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) for Na30, Na90 and Na180 as predictors of 90d preLT mortality (mean\u00b1SE) were .808\u00b1.026, .807\u00b1.026 and .783\u00b1.025, respectively, compared to .714\u00b1.032 for NaC (all p<.05 vs. NaC). On multivariable logistic regression analysis, MELD and Na90 were independent predictors of 90d preLT mortality, with best discrimination given by the following model: MELD-Na90 = MELD + (135-Na90)*1.04 with value of Na90 capped at 135. AUROCs for MELD-Na90, MELD-Na, and MELD were .875\u00b1.027, .865\u00b1.025 and .838\u00b1.027, respectively. Findings were similar when patients with HCC at referral (n=155) were excluded (AUROCs .884\u00b1.025, .876\u00b1.026 and .840\u00b1.031, respectively), and when 90 day survival endpoint was changed from \"death censored at LT\" to \"death or LT\" (AUROC's .890\u00b1.021, .882\u00b1.022, and .855\u00b1.026, respectively). Conclusion: Short term improvement in Na may mask true preLT mortality risk. The lowest Na in the preceding 90 days is a better prognostic indicator than current sodium. Substitution of MELD-Na90 for MELD would permit more accurate \"sickest first\" organ allocation, while at the same time allowing preLT correction of Na without loss of priority. Prospective validation of MELD-Na90, in comparison to MELD-Na and MELD, is warranted.",

Therneau. 1 1 Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN. Background: Hyponatremia is a common yet important complication of cirrhosis. Serum sodium (Na) has been found to be an important predictor of survival in patients with cirrhosis. Models incorporating Na have been proposed for liver allocation. Concerns have been raised, however, that liver transplantation (LTx) in hyponatremic patients will adversely affect the outcome. In this work, we assessed the effect of pre-LTx Na on the short term survival following LTx. Methods: Patient-level data on all waitlist registrants in the US for 2005 and 2006 were obtained from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data at the time of LTx and outcomes following LTx were extracted. The relationship between Na pre-LTx and survival post-LTx was analyzed using multivariable regression analyses. Results: There were 7411 primary transplants that met the inclusion criteria between 2005 and 2006. The median Na in mEq/L at the time of LTx was 136 (interquartile range, IQR: 132-139). There were 1255 patients who had a Na \u2264130 mEq/L. The mean MELD score was 22.5 (SD 9.2). Median follow up was 279 (IQR: 155-371) days. The overall 30-and 90-day survival post-OLT was 96% and 93%, respectively. In a multivariable logistic regression model, MELD was associated with 1.04-fold increase in 90-day mortality (95 confidence interval: 1.03-1.05), while Na did not have impact on survival (HR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-1.02). The figure represents the risk of 90-day mortality according to Na after adjustment for MELD, which clearly shows absence of mortality increase over a wide range of Na.",

Although these data do not address morbidity (e.g., central pontine myelinolysis), there is no evidence that incorporation of Na in organ allocation will lead to diminished survival. Objective. This study examined the relationship between MELD at liver transplantation (LT) and post-LT quality of life (QOL). Methods. Adult LT recipients (n = 247) at two centers completed the SF-36 and Transplant Symptom Frequency Questionnaire (TSFQ) 1-year post-LT. High SF-36 scores indicate better QOL; high TSFQ scores indicate more symptomatology. Clinical (lab) MELD at LT, demographic characteristics, presence of ascites, encephalopathy, and variceal bleeding pre-LT, current employment status, presence of co-morbid medical conditions, and BMI were collected from medical records. Results. Primary LT indication was viral hepatitis (57%), cholestatic liver disease (17%), or hepatocellular disease (27%), and 63% had ascites, 51% encephalopathy, and 29% gastroesophageal bleeding. Mean MELD at LT was 20\u00b19. There was almost no correlation between MELD and SF-36 Physical (r = 0.11) and Mental (r = 0.001) functioning. Statistically significant yet weak correlations were found between MELD and Physical Functioning (r = -0.15) and Role Functioning -Physical (r = -0.15). MELD was not significantly correlated with any other SF-36 scales (r's -0.11 to -0.01). MELD was not significantly correlated with any TSFQ domains: affective distress (r = 0.08), neurocognitive symptoms (r = 0.05), gastrointestinal distress (r = -0.02), physical appearance changes (r = 0.09), appetite and weight changes (r = 0.09), and miscellaneous symptoms (r = 0.08). Older age (\u00df = -0.28), female sex (\u00df = -0.26), viral hepatitis (\u00df = 0.67) or cholestatic disease (\u00df = 0.45), higher BMI (\u00df = -0.62), and >1 medical co-morbidity (\u00df = 0.57) were significant predictors of lower QOL as measured by the SF-36 (adj R 2 = 0.12, F = 4.4, p < 0.001). Older age (\u00df = 0.27), female sex (\u00df = 0.29), higher BMI (\u00df = 0.71), history of variceal bleeding (\u00df = 0.19), and >1 medical co-morbidity (\u00df = 0.17) were predictive of more symptoms on TSFQ (adj R 2 = 0.10, F = 4.1, p < 0.001). MELD was not predictive of QOL. Conclusions. Higher disease severity, as measured by MELD, at LT does not portend a worse QOL outcome for patients 1-yr after transplantation. Other pre-LT indicators of decompensation also do not predict post-LT QOL. Post-LT QOL is affected more by other variables, including age, sex, BMI, and medical co-morbidities. Introduction: Racial disparities in access to cadaveric renal allografts have been well described for renal transplantation. However, little is known about differences in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) rates for patients of minority racial groups following listing. The purpose of the current study was to determine if there is difference in rate of transplantation among racial groups and to examine the potential reasons for the disparity. Methods: The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was obtained. Data was extracted for adult OLTs greater than 18 years of age performed from 2/2002-12/2005. Transplants for which recipient race or Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score at listing were unknown and patients active on the list were excluded. Rates of transplantation as well as differences in reasons for de-listing (transplantation, death/deterioration, and improvement) were examined. In an effort to examine only patients with chronic liver disease, further analysis was performed excluding patients with acute fulminant liver failure and retransplants. Results: The database contained complete MELD and race information on 17,916 OLTs. Seventy-four percent of patients were Caucasian, 12% Hispanic, 9% African-American, and 4% were Asian. As seen in Table 1 , laboratory MELD score at removal differed between racial groups. Examining pair-wise comparisons of the three minority groups to Caucasians, only Hispanics differed in reason for delisting (Table 1) . Subgroup analysis excluding acute hepatic failure patients and retransplants showed similar results with Hispanic patients being more likely to die/deteriorate as compared to other racial groups (31% deaths vs. 24% deaths for Caucasians), and being less likely to receive a transplant (69% of Hispanics vs. 75% of Caucasians, p<0.001). Conclusion: Hispanic patients, although listed with higher MELD scores, are transplanted less often than Caucasian patients and are more likely to die/deteriorate while awaiting OLT. Reasons for this discrepancy are unclear and merit further attention. Background: Since the implementation of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) for liver allocation, an increasing number of candidates with renal insufficiency have undergone orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Since candidates with renal insufficiency have higher post-transplant morbidity and mortality, MELD-based allocation may be shifting some waiting list mortality to the post-transplant period in these candidates. The objective of this study was to evaluate the survival benefit among candidates with renal insufficiency who underwent OLT. Methods: Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data for adult candidates age \u226518 initially listed for OLT between 9/1/01 and 12/31/2006 (n=38,899) were analyzed. The effect of serum creatinine on the survival benefit (contrast between waiting list and post-transplant mortality) was assessed by sequential stratification, an extension of Cox regression. Each recipient was matched with candidates active on the waiting list in the same organ procurement organization with the same MELD score.",

Staff-identified and self-identified groups showed only 20% overlap; however, both groups showed similar characteristics.

Ambivalent donors had more education and stronger religious or spiritual identification than the entire cohort. Only 1 donor indicated persistent doubt about donation. These results suggest that expressed or perceived donor candidate ambivalence may represent a process of careful consideration and should not be used sole basis for donor disqualification. The impact of donor age on recipient outcome for adult right-lobe living donor liver transplantation (RLDLT) is unclear. Aim: To analyze the effect of donor age on recipient outcome following RDLDT. Methods: Since 2000 we have performed 226 RLDLT (mean donor age 37 years, range 18-60 years), including 20 donors age 55 years or older. We analyzed the effects of donor age, as a continuous or categorical (< 54 vs > 55years) variable, on recipient outcome. Recipient outcome measures included biochemical markers of hepatocytes injury (AST, ALT) and graft function (INR, bilirubin), postoperative infections, bleeding, biliary complications, acute cellular rejection, as well as patient and graft survival. Analyses were carried out stratified for higher recipient MELD scores (< vs. >25), recipient age (< vs. > 60 years), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (presence vs. absence). Results: 5-year patient and graft survival after RLDLT was 80% and 78%, respectively. Donor age as a continuous variable was associated with increased AST (p=0.04) and ALT (p= 0.022) release after transplantation, while no effect was observed on INR or bilirubin. RLDLT using donors above 55 years of age resulted in an increased incidence of biliary strictures (20% vs. 6%, p= 0.028), postoperative cholangitis (25% vs. 9%, p= 0.023). No effect of donor age was found for the following recipient outcome measures: the number of bile ducts supplying the graft, type of biliary reconstruction required; rejection, hemorrhage, pulmonary or urinary tract infections, renal failure, or length of hospital stay. 5-year patient survival was identical for patients receiving grafts from donors below or above 55 years of age (81% vs 77%, p= 0.86). Similarly, 5-year graft survival was comparable for young and old grafts (78% vs 77%, p= 0.71). Recipient age (< vs > 60 years), recipient MELD score (< vs >25), or Hepatits C status of the recipient did not impact on the effect of age on patient or graft survival. Conclusion: In this single center series of 226 RLDLT, the use of selected older donors did not impair graft and patient survival, but was associated with an increased rate of biliary strictures. Background: Biliary stricture rate after living donor liver transplant (LDLT) in adults remains relatively high in comparison to the stricture rate after adult cadaveric liver transplant or LDLT in pediatric patients. The etiology or risk factors for biliary stricture development at present time are uncertain. Purpose: To determine the risk factors for biliary stricture after right lobe (RL) LDLT. Methods: From 5/99 to 12/07, 109 LDLT procedures were performed in 109 adult recipients. Eleven patients were excluded from analysis due to <90 days follow up or need for retransplant. The following data was prospectively collected: 1. demographics, 2. acuity of illness, 3. number of bile ducts, 4. type of biliary reconstruction, 5. graft to recipient weight ratio, 6. hemodynamic parameters, 7. outcomes. These parameters were compared in patients with and without strictures. Results: Mean follow-up for 98 patients is 1642 days (range: 120-3052). 8 of 109 patients died during the follow-up range and 3 required whole liver re-transplants. 33 patients (34%) developed a biliary strictures during the follow-up period.

Therefore, the development of biliary strictures in some patients may represent yet another feature of small-for-size syndrome. Background: OX40 and CD154 can be expressed by both Foxp3+ Tregs and activated T effector cells. However, the question as to how OX40 and CD154 function, individually or collectively, in regulating such functionally different T cell subsets in transplant models remains poorly understood. In some models, blocking CD154 costimulation is remarkably effective in prolonging graft survival, but targeting CD154 alone rarely creates tolerance. But the role of OX40 in regulating the CD154 blockade induced tolerance is completely unknown.",

However, when the T effector cells were sorted and stimulated in vitro, OX40 expression could be Abstracts readily induced on the T effector cells. To further examine how OX40 regulates such functionally different T cell subsets, we found that OX40 delivers potent costimulatory signals to T effector cells, which prevent the induction of new Foxp3+ Tregs from activated T effector cells but promote their differentiation to Th1 cells but not Th17 cells. Surprisingly, OX40 costimulation to CD154 deficient Foxp3+ Tregs completely inhibited their regulatory functions. In an islet transplant model, we showed that CD154 deficient mice can reject the DBA/2 islet allografts, but blocking OX40 costimulation readily induced donor specific tolerance (MST>150 days), and this tolerant status was critically dependent on the induction of Foxp3+ Tregs. In contrast, treatment of CD154 deficient recipients with a agonist anti-OX40 mAb precipitate rapid islet allograft rejection, suggesting that OX40 costimulation is critically important in the induction of transplant tolerance. Conclusions: Our data suggest that OX40 is a costimulatory molecule to T effector cells but a powerful negative regulator for Foxp3+ Tregs. Thus, a key role for OX40 in the induction of transplant tolerance is the control of T cell mediated regulation. Background: Foxp3 is a winged-helix family transcription factor that is the master regulator for the development and function of regulatory T cells (Treg). We investigated the molecular mechanisms important for regulation of Foxp3 expression, and defined the structure of the active Foxp3 promoter in CD4 + T cell lineages. Methods: Purified CD4 + CD25 -Foxp3 -GFP -T cells (na\u00efve) and CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + GFP + Treg were cultured with antigen presenting cells in the presence of IL-2, anti-CD3\u03b5 mAb, TGF\u03b2 or the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (ZdCyd).",

Disulfite-sequencing and methylation-specific PCR analysis showed that this region is heavily methylated in na\u00efve CD4 + T cells and TGF\u03b2 induced peripheral Treg, but demethylated in thymic derived natural Treg (nTreg). ChIP analysis showed that the methylated CpG island is bound specifically by the DNA methyltransferases 1 and 3b. ZdCyd causes demethylation of the CpG island, and in combination with TGF\u03b2, synergistically induces Foxp3 expression. ChIP assays for acetylated histone 3 and Sp1, both markers of gene activation, showed that the CpG island is acetylated and bound by Sp1 in nTreg and ZdCyd plus TGF\u03b2 induced Treg, but not in activated CD4 + T cells or TGF\u03b2 induced Treg. EMSA likewise shows the CpG island binds Sp1. In contrast to the upstream promoter, the structure of the first intronic promoter differs markedly between nTreg and TGF\u03b2 induced Treg, but is not affected by ZdCyd. The upstream CpG island also possesses enhancer activity that is repressed by DNA methyltransferases. ZdCyd plus TGF\u03b2 induced Treg have stable Foxp3 expression and enhanced suppressive functions in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that nTreg and TGF\u03b2 induced Treg are genetically distinguished from each other by the epigenetic structure of a unique upstream CpG island of the Foxp3 promoter. The function of this region is regulated by DNA methylation and histone acetylation. ZdCyd demethylates the promoter, leading to enhanced and stable expression of Foxp3 and suppressor activity, similar to nTreg. This has important implications for biology, and generating Treg for tolerance.",

We previously showed that regulatory T cell (Treg) function required trafficking from the inflammatory graft site to the local draining lymph node (dLN). Since the mechanisms that regulate migration through afferent lymphatics are poorly understood, we explored the role of chemokine receptors on Treg for afferent lymphatic migration in an islet transplantation model. Methods: Islets were transplanted from BALB/c mice into Foxp3 GFP C57BL/6 mice. Treg from wild type, CCR2 -/-, CCR4 -/-, CCR5 -/-, or CCR7 -/-C57BL/6 mice were isolated, labeled with red dye PKH26, and transferred intravenously, or locally into the islet allograft. Treg migration to islet grafts and dLN was determined by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Endogenous Foxp3 GFP+ Treg and transferred PKH26 labeled Treg were sorted from the islet grafts and the dLN, and chemokine receptor and sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1P1) expression were determined by RT-PCR. Islet allograft survival was determined by measurement of blood glucose. Results: Freshly isolated Treg expressed S1P1 and the chemokine receptors CCR2, CCR4, CCR5, and CCR7. Endogenous Treg, and both intravenously and locally transferred Treg, that were recovered from islet allografts and dLN expressed similar levels of CCR2 and CCR5. CCR4 was expressed preferentially on islet migrating Treg, while S1P1 and CCR7 were expressed preferentially in dLN migrating Treg. Locally transferred Treg migrated to the dLN, but CCR7 -/-Treg were not able to migrate to the dLN. CCR2 -/and CCR5 -/-Treg were impaired in their ability to migrate to the dLN.",

In contrast, CCR4 -/-Treg migrated normally from the islet to the dLN. Importantly, CCR2 -/-, CCR5 -/and CCR7 -/-, but not CCR4 -/-Treg, were impaired in their ability to prolong islet allograft survival when transferred locally in the islet allograft. Conclusion: Treg migrate from the inflammatory site of the allograft to draining secondary lymphoid tissue through afferent lymphatics. This process depends on CCR2, CCR5, and CCR7; and is crucial for full Treg function in vivo. These results demonstrate a novel role for sequential migration from the graft to the dLN in Treg function and suppression. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression provides a major, and especially beyond oncology, largely unexplored means to regulate host immune cell functions. Our ongoing analysis of histone deacetylase (HDAC) expression by Foxp3+ naturally occurring murine regulatory T (Treg) cells showed TCR-activated Tregs had 5-6 fold more HDAC6 mRNA than corresponding resting Treg or non-Treg cells. In various cell types, HDAC6 deacetylates alpha-tubulin, cortactin, and HSP90, abrogates formation of the aggresome, and blocks the unfolded protein response, though nothing is known regarding these pathways in Tregs. We found that an HDAC6-specific inhibitor, tubacin (but not the control compound, niltubacin), increased Treg suppressive function in vitro (p<0.01), in association with increased expression of CTLA, IL-10, GITR, PD-1 and other Treg-associated genes (p<0.05), and increased Treg Foxp3 protein (though not mRNA) expression. Tubacin enhanced the conversion of CD4+CD25-cells into CD4+ Foxp3+ Treg in vitro, and globally decreased cytokine production, with the exception of IL-10 and IL-17 mRNA. Comparable and dose-dependent effects were seen using the HSP90 inhibitor, geldanamycin, suggesting that the effects of HDAC6 inhibition were mediated, at least in part, by blocking the chaperone effect of HSP90. Use of tubacin in vivo significantly decreased the severity of colitis in two murine inflammatory bowel disease models (p<0.05), dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis and the CD4+CD62Lhigh adoptive transfer model of colitis, as assessed by standard clinical and histologic criteria. In addition, 14 days combined use of tubacin and a subtherapeutic dosage of rapamycin led to significantly prolonged cardiac allograft survival (BALB/c->C57BL/6) compared to use of either agent alone (p<0.05). Our data show that use of the first known small molecule inhibitor of one specific HDAC has important therapeutic effects, including enhancing the production and suppressive function of Tregs. While ongoing studies are directed towards unraveling the interactions of HDAC6-dependent pathways and Treg functions, the current data indicate the importance of understanding the functions of HDACs to the development of entirely new ways to regulate host immune responses.",

Tregs and RD6 cells are functionally suppressive after activation by wild type but not IL-2 knock-out allogeneic DCs, and anti-CD25 inhibits the function of Treg and RD6 cells in a dose response fashion. In contrast, wild type and IL-2 knock-out DCs are equally able to activate alloreactive CD4+CD25-cells. Supplemental IL-2 at high (1000 U/ml) but not low doses (100 U/ml) restores the function of alloreactive Tregs and RD6 that were activated by IL-2 KO DCs.

Introduction: Previously, it has been demonstrated that FOXP3, a gene required for the development and function of regulatory T cells, was highly expressed in the graft during cardiac rejection, suggesting infiltration of regulatory T cells in the transplanted organ during an allogeneic response. In this study, we investigated whether graftinfiltrating T cells expanded from rejecting human cardiac allografts exhibit immune regulatory activities. Methods: Graft-infiltrating lymphocytes (GILs) cultured from endomyocardial biopsies (EMB; n=13) with histological signs of acute cellular rejection were expanded in the presence of donor-antigens in IL-2/IL-15-enriched medium for 2-3 weeks. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the expression of CD3, CD4, CD8 and FoxP3. To analyze the immune regulatory function, we performed MLRs with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of the patients and irradiated donor or third party spleen cells in the absence and presence of GILs (ratio 5:1). Results: Of the CD3 + GILs, 9% (median; range: 1-21%) stained positive for FoxP3. This FoxP3 expression was detected in both CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell population (median: 8% and 9%, respectively). Functional analysis demonstrated that GILs suppressed the antidonor proliferation of responder T cells (range % inhibition: 55-81%). Interestingly, this suppression was predominantly achieved by CD8 + GILs: depletion of CD8 + cells from the GILs population diminished the inhibitory effect, whereas addition of solely CD8 + GILs to the MLR abundantly suppressed the anti-donor response (range % inhibition: 62-77%). In contrast, GILs did not inhibit the proliferation of T cells stimulated with third-party antigens. The figure below depicts a representative example.",

Results are summarized in figure 1 (one-year organ allograft rejection rate). The collected data demonstrate that the rejection rate of donor-specific organ allografts which accompanied primary liver, kidney, and heart transplants was significantly lower in combined transplants as compared to that of the primary allograft transplanted alone. This was not true, however, for intestinal and pancreatic allografts where protection for the accompanying organ was not observed. We further demonstrate that transplantation of two organs of the same type (double kidneys or double lungs), i.e. increase in antigen load, also leads to decreased rates of rejection of the allografted organs. Conclusions: In combined simultaneous transplants, the heart, liver, and kidney allografts appear themselves to be protected, and to protect the other organ from rejection. Increased antigenic load of identical antigens in case of double lung and double kidney transplants appears to also offer immunologic protection against rejection, perhaps by different mechanisms. Background: A2ALL (9-center Adult-to-Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort Study) has identified risk factors for mortality after AALDLT, including center experience. The aim of this study was to determine if A2ALL findings are reflected in the national experience. Methods: AALDLT at A2ALL (n=681) and non-A2ALL centers (n=1598) from 1/1/98 to 8/31/07 in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database were analyzed. Cox regression models adjusted for recipient and donor characteristics were fitted to test associations with mortality risk after AALDLT, including center type (A2ALL vs. non-A2ALL) and case number (for each AALDLT at each center). Results: AALDLT were performed at 9 A2ALL and 63 non-A2ALL centers. There was no significant difference in overall mortality risk between A2ALL and non-A2ALL centers. Significant predictors of death (both groups combined) included donor age (hazard ratio (HR)=1.14 per 10 years, P=0.003), recipient age (HR=1.25 per 10 years, P<0.001), diagnosis of HCV (HR=1.22, P=0.04) or HCC (HR=1.99, P<0.001), and earlier center experience (AALDLT case number \u226415, HR=1.58, P<0.001). There was no significant effect of transplant year after adjusting for experience. Cold ischemia time >4.5 hours was associated with higher mortality (HR=1.83, P=0.004); this effect was similar in A2ALL and non-A2ALL centers. There were no significant interactions between center type and any predictor except center experience ( Figure) . Compared to later experience, earlier center experience was associated with significantly higher mortality risk in both A2ALL (HR=2.24, P<0.0001) and non-A2ALL centers (HR=1.38, P<0.004). Survival during early experience was significantly worse at A2ALL vs. non-A2ALL centers (HR=1.42, P=0.024), but survival in later experience was similar. Conclusions: After the first 15 cases, AALDLT survival was similar at A2ALL and non-A2ALL centers, and similar significant mortality risk factors were identified, including center experience. These analyses support the generalization of findings from A2ALL centers to others performing AALDLT.",

We showed that high pro-inflammatory / lower regulatory cytokine gene polymorphism (GP) profile increased the risk for acute rejection. In this analysis, we assessed the effect of genetic factors on HC and CAV. Methods: 406 PHTx with clinical and GP data for cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 A-308G; INF-\u03b3 T+874A; IL-10 G-1082A, C-819T, C-592A ; IL-4 C-590T; IL-5 T-746C; IL-6 G-174C), growth factors (TGF\u03b2-1 T+869C, C+915G; VEGF A-2578C, C-460T, G+405C), effector molecules (Fas A-670G; FasL C-843T) and pharmacogenomics (ABCB1 C3435T, G2677T/A) were analyzed regarding HC and CAV. Results: Adjusting for recipient black race and age with Cox regression models, we identified the following risk factors: IL-10 High was associated with lower rates of HC. Low Th1 (INF-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1) with high Th2 (IL-4, IL-5) cytokine GP profiles were protective for HC in combination with IL-10 High. Carriers of Fas High experienced higher rates for HC and CAV and High Fas-FasL combination doubled the relative risk for CAV. ABCB1 3435CC/2677GG genotypes were also associated with lower rates of HC (Table 1) . Conclusion: In this large multi-center study GPs with higher regulatory profiles and increased drug transport were associated with a lower incidence of HC. A genetic proapoptotic profile might contribute to the pathogenesis of CAV.

It has recently been reported that CD1d-restricted NKT cells that express invariant TCR (iNKT cells) play an important role in the production of autoantibodies through the interaction with B-1 cells. This observation prompted us to investigate the possible role of iNKT cells in the production of antibodies (Abs) against transplant-related antigens, such as ABO blood group carbohydrates and histocompatibility complex allopeptides, in a mouse model. We have previously demonstrated that B cells with receptors for blood group A carbohydrates were found exclusively in a CD11b + CD5 + B-1 subpopulation of mice, resembling humans with blood group O or B. Immunization with human blood group A red blood cells (A-RBCs) elicited the extensive production of anti-A IgM and IgG. Furthermore, the number of B-1 cells with receptors for A carbohydrates increased in the peritoneal cavity. In CD1d -/and V\u03b114 -/-Balb/c mice, which lack iNKT cells, such elicited production of anti-A IgM was not observed, even after immunization with human A-RBCs. However, class II -/-Balb/c mice, which lack CD4 + T cells but maintain normal levels of iNKT cells, exhibited levels of anti-A IgM production comparable to those in wild-type (WT) Balb/c mice. Moreover, anti-A IgG production was absent in CD1d -/-Balb/c mice even after the immunization, indicating that although iNKT cells crucially contribute to anti-A IgM production and IgG class switching, helper T cells do not. Notably, the proportion of B-1 cells in the livers of CD1d -/-Balb/c mice was significantly reduced (2.66 \u00b1 0.43%, n = 4) when compared to that in WT mice (4.76 \u00b1 1.93%, n = 4). We next immunized CD1d -/and WT Balb/c mice twice with 2 \u00d710 6 allogeneic B6 mouse thymocytes, and thereafter detected the anti-B6 (allopeptides) Abs by flow cytometry. In the CD1d -/mice, anti-B6 IgM production was comparable to that of WT mice, and IgG class switching also occurred normally. These findings indicated that iNKT cells play a pivotal role in the production of Abs specific for blood group carbohydrate determinants that are believed to be T cell independent, but are not required in the production of Abs for allopeptides that are believed to be T cell dependent. The depletion of iNKT cells or the suppression of their function might constitute a novel approach for preventing antibody-mediated rejection in ABO-incompatible transplantation, or in xenotransplantation, which involves similar carbohydrate antigens. Background Static cold storage (CS) is the most widely used organ preservation method for deceased donor kidney grafts. Retrospective analyses have indicated that preservation by hypothermic machine perfusion (MP) may lead to improved outcome after renal transplantation.

We investigated the trafficking of cells after skin and heart transplantation in a dynamic fashion through the use of in vivo microscopy. Antigen presenting cells were followed using MHC-Cl-II-GFP and CD11c-GFP transgenic mice. Vascularized and non vascularized skin grafts as well as heart transplants were used in syngeneic as well as allogeneic settings. After syngeneic non-vascularized skin transplantation, we observed an early and massive cellular infiltration of host cells into the graft as early as 3 hours post-transplant with a gradual accumulation in the dermis. The accumulation of host-derived cells was accelerated after graft vascularization at day 4/5 post transplantation. This graft infiltration by recipient cells was more pronounced with vascularized skin grafts, and to a higher degree in heart transplants. Recipient cells similarly infiltrated allogeneic grafts early on and in larger numbers than for syngeneic grafts by day 4/5 post-transplantation. When visualizing MHC-Cl-II-GFP recipient cells in a syngeneic skin transplant, recipient DCs invaded the graft early on and, by 3 weeks post transplant gradually replaced graft DCs in the dermis (dermal DCs) and the epidermis (Langerhans cells). Donor DCs could still be seen in the graft up to 8 days post transplant. However, virtually all donor Langerhans cells were eventually replaced by recipient ones in a concentric fashion suggesting that the new Langerhans cells originate from the recipient skin adjacent to the graft and not from centrally-derived precursor cells.",

Therefore, the graft can be seen as a \"chimera\" of cells from donor and recipient origin. The presence of recipient endothelial vascular cells and DCs within the graft may be important for maintaining the indirect response thought to be responsible for chronic rejection. Objective: Maturation resistance and tolerogenicity can be conferred on dendritic cells (DC), -crucial regulators of T cells, by exposure to rapamycin (RAPA), a tolerance-sparing immunosuppressant. The mechanisms underlying this acquired unresponsiveness, typified by diminished responses to Toll-like receptor (TLR) or CD40 ligation, have not been identified. Thus, our objective was to elucidate a molecular basis for RAPA-induced DC maturation resistance. Methods: RAPA administration was used to condition splenic DC in vivo and bone-marrow derived DC in vitro. DC maturation was monitored by assessment of co-stimulatory molecule expression, cytokine production, and T cell allostimulatory capacity. To identify negative regulators of maturation, microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR was completed, and findings confirmed via Western and flow cytometric analyses. Results: In vitro or in vivo exposure of myeloid DC to RAPA elicited de novo production of IL-1\u03b2 by otherwise immature DC (CD86 lo ). Interestingly, DC IL-1\u03b2 production, acting in an autocrine/paracrine fashion, promoted DC overexpression of the IL-1 receptor(R) family member, ST2L, and enhanced its surface expression. ST2L is the receptor for IL-33, an IL-1 family member, and has also been implicated as a negative regulator of TLR signaling. Consistent with this regulatory function, IL-1\u03b2-induced ST2L expression suppressed the responsiveness of RAPA-conditioned DC to TLR or CD40 ligation. Conclusion: RAPA causes de novo production of IL-1\u03b2 by immature DC, upregulating ST2L, and establishing a barrier to DC maturation following exposure to TLR or CD40 ligation. As such this work identifies a novel mechanism by which a clinically-important immunosuppressant impedes the capacity of DC to mature and consequently stimulate effector/adaptive T cell responses. These findings are particularly relevant to the potential use of RAPA-conditioned DC as \"negative\" cellular vaccines to block alloAg-specific responses, as exposure to endogenous and exogenous inflammatory stimuli can induce DC maturation and negate the tolerogenic properties of immature DC. Exosomes are nanovesicles (50-100nm) released to the extracellular milieu by different cell types. Exosomes secreted by dendritic cells (DCs) and other APCs express MHC Ag, adhesion molecules and costimulatory molecules oriented on the membrane surface with their binding domains facing outwards. Thus, exosomes released by graft-infiltrating leukocytes (GILs) could function as \"Ag-presenting vesicles\" or as vehicles to transfer alloAg between recipient's APCs during elicitation of T-cell allo-immunity. Aims: to test if (i) GILs activate anti-donor T-cells in secondary lymphoid organs by releasing exosomes with alloAg into systemic circulation; or (ii) GILs that traffic to the spleen as passenger leukocytes use exosomes as a local mechanism to transfer alloAg to recipient's DCs. Methods: Exosomes were isolated from supernatants of BM-derived [C57BL/6(B6), IA b ] DCs pulsed with the BALB/c IEa 52-68 allopeptide and purified by ultra-filtration and ultra-centrifugation on a 30%sucrose/D 2 O gradient. We used PKH67 + exosomes and CD45.1 congenic B6 mice for traffic studies, heart (heterotopic) and skin transplantation models (BALB/c\u2192B6, Thy1.2 + ), and CFSE-labeled 1H3.1 TCRtg CD4 T-cells (Thy1.1 + ) specific for IA b (B6) loaded with IEa 52-68 (BALB/c). DCs were genetically engineered to release exosomes expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP).",

Here, we demonstrated that although GILs of cardiac and skin allografts release exosomes ex vivo, they did not secrete enough concentrations of exosomes with alloAg into circulation to stimulate donor-reactive T-cells in lymphoid organs. Instead, our findings indicate that migrating DCs (generated in vitro or isolated from GILs), once homed in the spleen, they transfer exosomes expressing GFP and carrying allopeptides to spleen-resident DCs of the recipient, identified by the congenic marker CD45.1. Conclusion: Exchange of exosomes between DCs in lymphoid organs might be a mechanism by which passenger leukocytes transfer alloAg to recipient's APCs in secondary lymphoid organs.

Tolerogenic dendritic cells (DC) are immature, maturation-resistant(MR) or alternatively-activated DC that express MHC molecules and low levels or absent costimulatory signals. Although MRDC administration has successfully prolonged allograft survival in murine models, the mechanism of action in vivo remains unknown. Aim: to test in vivo if the down-regulation of the anti-donor response induced by donor-derived tolerogenic DC is due to: (i) direct interaction of the tolerogenic DC with donor-reactive T cells or (ii) by reprocessing of the tolerogenic DC into alloantigen (alloAg) by recipient APC for interaction with indirect pathway T cells. Methods: DC were generated in vitro by culturing BALB/c bone marrow cells for 6-8 days in medium with GM-CSF + IL-4 supplemented with 10nM 1\u03b1,25-(0H) 2 vitamin D 3 (VD 3 ). We used a model of heterotopic vascularized allogeneic heart transplantation [BALB/c into C57BL/6 (B6)] and CD4 T cells from 1H3.1 TCRtg mice that recognize B6 IA b loaded with the BALB/c allopeptide IE\u03b1 52-68 (indirect pathway) . Results: we demonstrated that VD 3 renders DC maturation resistant (VD 3 -MRDC) as VD 3 -MRDC fail to up-regulate co-stimulatory molecule expression, release IL-12p70, or stimulate allo-responsive T cells after challenge with potent DC-maturation stimuli. Adoptive transfer (i.v.) of BALB/c VD 3 -MRDC (day -7) significantly prolonged survival of BALB/c heart grafts in B6 mice in the absence of immunosuppressive therapy. Interestingly, we found that in vivo, BALB/c VD 3 -MRDC induced proliferation of indirect pathway 1H3.1 CD4 T cells in the spleens of B6 recipient mice, indicating that reprocessing of the BALB/c DC by host (B6) APC does occur. Proliferation of 1H3.1 CD4 T cells in response to BALB/c VD 3 -MRDC resulted in defective activation (CD62L high , CD69 low ) of 1H3.1 T cells, leading to their peripheral deletion and outgrowth of CD4 + Foxp3 + Treg cells. Reprocessing of BALB/c VD 3 -MRDC was performed by recipient splenic CD11c high CD8\u03b1 neg DC, and donor alloAg continued to be presented through the indirect pathway for 3 days after donor DC administration.

These cells are known to circumvent tolerance induction and/or prevent indefinite graft survival in several models, but mechanistic details of their function are unknown. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that CD8 memory T cells initiate alloreocognition and express effector functions within hours of reperfusion. Methods: Syngeneic or A/J (H-2 a ) hearts were transplanted into WT C57BL/6 (H-2 b ), CD4-/-, CD8-/-, or Rag1-/-recipients. RNA and protein were prepared from total graft homogenates and analyzed by qRT-PCR and ELISA. Rag1-/-mice received 1x10 6 WT or IFNg-/-2C cells and were used as recipients 10 weeks after reconstitution. Donor-specific CD8 memory cells were purified from WT spleens 8 weeks after A/J skin grafting, and donor-specific effector CD4 cells were purified from spleens of CD90.1 mice 8 days after A/J heart transplantation. Flow cytometry was used to quantify graft infiltrates. Results: Allografts contained elevated levels of IFNg and CXCL9 mRNA at 24, 48 and 72 hrs post-transplant vs. isografts.

Although donor-specific IFNg production was undetectable in splenocytes until day 4-5 post transplant, graft-infiltrating CD44 hi CD62L lo CD8 T cells were present as early as 24 hrs post-transplant. In adoptive transfer studies, effector-memory CD8 T cells reconstituted early allospecific CXCL9 production in CD8-/-mice. Lastly, primed CD4 T cells adoptively transferred at day 2 post-transplant readily infiltrated allografts in control but not CD8 depleted recipients. Conclusions: CD8 memory T cells infiltrate allografts rapidly post-transplant, produce IFNg, and propogate an inflammatory environment which optimizes recruitment of primed effector T cells. Successful neutralization of this early allorecognition pathway should provide valuable adjunctive therapy to improve graft function and survival. Background: Allogeneic T cell stimulation requires not only antigen-specific signals but also costimulatory signals, most importantly between CD80/86 on the antigen presenting cell (APC) and CD28 and CTLA4 on the T cell. Engagement of the T cell receptor without costimulation can lead to anergy and the induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs). T cell activation is also controlled by expression of the tryptophan-catabolising enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Depletion of this essential amino acid, and/or the production of tryptophan metabolites inhibits T cell proliferation. Methods: A genetic approach to confer tolerogenic properties on murine dendritic cells (DCs) has been explored using lentiviral vectors, based on the Equine Infectious Anaemia Virus. Firstly, an intracellular method that prevents costimulation has been developed: A fusion protein consisting of CTLA4 and KDEL [an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal] is expressed in DCs. The CTLA4-KDEL binds to CD80/86 in the ER and prevents expression of these proteins on the DC surface. A second approach uses an elevated expression of the IDO enzyme by transduced DCs. Results: CTLA4-KDEL-or IDO-transduced DCs were unable to induce allogeneic T cell proliferation. However, using two-stage DC:T cell co-culture assays, it was shown that CTLA4-KDEL-, but not IDO-transduced DCs, can induce donor-specific T cell anergy in vitro and in vivo. Tolerance to both the direct and indirect pathways was shown using CTLA4-KDEL-transduced DCs. Linked suppression was mediated by the generation of donor-specific Tregs. IDO-transduced DCs did not generate Tregs. Furthermore, it was shown separately that DCs expressing IDO whilst lacking CD80/86 expression for potential ligation by CTLA4 (although CTLA4-CD80/86 ligation upregulates IDO, it downregulates T cell activation) failed to generate or even sustain FoxP3+ Treg populations. The ability of the transduced DCs to induce tolerance to allografts was assessed in a complete mismatch and CBK\u2192CBA (indirect pathway) corneal graft model.",

The respective abilities of direct and indirect pathway CD4 T cells to provide help for cytotoxic CD8 alloimmunity were examined in a mouse model of heart graft rejection in which the recipients contain only monoclonal helper CD4 T cells, specific for self-restricted H-Y antigen (female B6 Mar/RAG1 -/mice). Mice were additionally reconstituted with 10 6 B6 CD8 T cells, and then challenged with female BALB/c (no CD4 T cell help), or male BALB/c (indirect pathway help), or male B6xBALB/c F1 hearts (direct pathway help) . Un-reconstituted Mar/RAG1 -/mice lack effector B and CD8 T lymphocytes, and consequently all heart grafts survived indefinitely. In contrast, reconstituted Mar/ RAG1 -/mice rejected male F1 grafts rapidly (MST 8d), whereas female BALB/c grafts survived indefinitely, confirming a CD4-dependent effector role for the transferred CD8 T cells. CD4 T cell help through the indirect pathway, although sufficient to elicit graft rejection, was less efficient than direct pathway help, because male BALB/c grafts were rejected more slowly than the F1 grafts (MST 12d, p<0.001). We next considered whether indirect pathway CD4 T cells provide help through recognition of MHC II complexes on the surface of alloreactive CD8 T cells, in analogous fashion to the cognate interaction between B and T lymphocytes. In support, reconstitution of Mar/RAG1 -/recipients with instead, MHC II-deficient CD8 T cells, resulted in slower rejection of male BALB/c hearts (MST 21d, p<0.01), whereas male F1 grafts, that still permit provision of linked help, were rejected at the same tempo. Most tellingly, Mar/RAG1 -/mice that received simultaneously a female BALB/c heart and male B6 APC (to activate Mar CD4 T cells) rejected their grafts rapidly when reconstituted with male CD8 T cells (MST 9d). In contrast, grafts survived indefinitely when female CD8 T cells were transferred. Flow cytometric analysis of mitogenstimulated CD8 T cells revealed surface MHC II expression. Indirect allorecognition can provide help for generating cytotoxic alloimmunity, but not as effectively as through the direct pathway. Indirect pathway help is potentiated by linkage through recognition of CD8 MHC II. PURPOSE: Tolerogenic properties of dendritic cells (DC) are supported and preserved by conditioning with the immunosuppressant rapamycin (RAPA). The ability of RAPAconditioned, recipient-derived DC pulsed with alloantigen (alloAg) to suppress both direct and indirect alloAg-specific T cells in the absence of immunosuppression has been demonstrated in a murine allograft model. DC can acquire intact MHC from cells or cell lysates. However, the ability of alloAg-pulsed RAPA-DC to immunomodulate directly-reactive alloAg-specific T cells has not been formally demonstrated. METHODS: DC were generated from C57BL/6 (B6; H2 b ) bone marrow cells in GM-CSF and IL-4. RAPA was added to indicated cultures (RAPA-DC) beginning on day (d) 2. On d7, CD11c + bead-purified RAPA-DC or non-treated control DC (CTR-DC) were incubated with BALB/c (H2 d ) splenocyte lysates (\"alloAg pulsing\"). Following incubation, the DC were harvested and the level of donor and recipient MHC molecules on CD11c + cells determined by flow cytometry and immunofluorescent imaging. Surface levels of CD86, B7-H1 (Programmed Death Ligand-1; PD-L1), and Fas-L were compared. Pulsed-DC were also incubated with CD8 + T cells from Rag -/-2C mice for 3d. 2C CD8 + cells express T cell receptors specific for H2-L d , a MHC class I molecule of BALB/c. Following incubation, 2C cell proliferation and apoptosis were both assessed. RESULTS: CTR-and RAPA-DC presented detectable levels of directly-transferred MHC class I and II on their surface after incubation with allogeneic BALB/c cell lysate. Donor MHC presented by \"pulsed\" recipient DC stimulated directly-reactive, alloAg-specific 2C T cell proliferation. However, only RAPA-DC induced apoptosis in the overwhelming majority of these cells responding via the direct pathway. Induction of apoptosis correlated with an increased level of surface Fas-L on RAPA-DC and their comparatively low level of CD86 relative to PD-L1. CONCLUSIONS: RAPA-conditioned DC can present intact MHC molecules acquired from lysates of allogeneic splenocytes and concurrently induce apoptosis of directlyreactive alloAg-specific CD8 + T cells. As such, we provide mechanistic insight into a mechanisms by which alloAg-pulsed, recipient-derived RAPA-DC may facilitate allograft tolerance. Background: T regs actively regulate alloimmune responses and promote transplant tolerance. ATG, a widely used induction therapy in organ transplantation, depletes peripheral T cells but may preferentially spare T regs . Sirolimus is thought to expand natural T regs . B7 T cell costimulatory blockade inhibits effector T cell (T eff ) expansion and may promote regulation. We investigated the effect of combining mouse ATG (mATG), CTLA4Ig and Sirolimus on stringent skin allograft survival, and studied the mechanisms by determining T reg /T eff balance in vivo using a unique model (ABM-TCRtg-Foxp3/gfp reporter mouse Conclusion:This is the first report to establish that T cell depletion with mATG combined with CTLA4Ig and Sirolimus synergize to prolong stringent fully allogeneic skin allograft survival by promoting regulation and tipping the T reg /T eff balance by both preserving T regs and facilitating generation of new T regs by a conversion mechanism. These results provide the rationale for translating such a novel therapeutic combination to promote regulation and tolerance in primates and human organ transplantation.",

Methods: CBA recipients (H-2 k ) were given single injection of purified EPA intraperitoneally on the same day as transplantation of a heart from C57BL/10 donors (H-2 b ). Mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) assay and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were also performed to evaluate the effect of purified EPA on cell proliferation and cytokine production. To determine the presence of regulatory cells, adoptive transfer study was conducted. Results: Untreated CBA recipients rejected C57BL/10 cardiac allografts with median survival time (MST), 8 days. In contrast, CBA recipients treated with purified EPA (1.0g/kg) had significant prolongation of allograft survival (MST, >100 days). CBA recipients treated with 0.1g/kg purified EPA eventually rejected allografts (MST, 13 days).",

Conclusions: Purified EPA induced significantly prolonged survival of fully mismatched cardiac allografts, and generated regulatory cells. Background: Chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN), the most common cause of late kidney allograft failure, is not effectively prevented by the current regimens. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) mediating intracellular signal transduction from various growth factor stimuli is required for TGF-\u03b2 production, which plays a key role in the development of CAN. Hence, the therapeutic potential of disruption of ERK1/2 signaling to prevent CAN was examined in an experimental model. Methods: Kidney donors from C57BL/6J mice (H-2 b ) were transplanted to bilaterally nephrectomized Balb/c recipient mice (H-2 d ). The recipients were treated with CI1040 (MEK-ERK1/2 inhibitor) or vehicle after 14 days post-transplantation for 28 days. CAN was evaluated with the Banff 97 working classification. Results: All six allografts receiving CI1040 treatment were survived, while two out of seven grafts were lost in vehicle-treated group. At the end of experiment, the function of grafts in CI1040 treated recipients had been maintained, indicated by lower levels of serum creatinine and BUN (30\u00b16 \u00b5M and 22\u00b18 mM, n=6) as compared to those (94\u00b139 \u00b5M and 56\u00b1 25 mM, n=5) in vehicle group (creatinine, p=0.0015; BUN, p=0.0054).",

Further examinations showed that CI1040 treatment resulted in inhibition of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and reduction of TGF-\u03b2 levels in grafts. In vitro CI1040 potently suppressed not only growth factors-stimulated ERK1/2 activation and TGF-\u03b2 biosynthesis in renal tubular epithelial cells, but also attenuated alloantigenstimulated T cell proliferation. Conclusion: Our data suggest that interference of ERK1/2 signaling with pharmacological agent (i.e. CI1040) has therapeutic potential to prevent CAN in kidney transplantation. Objective: This is the first study to investigate the role of a novel JAK3 and Sykinhibitor, R348, in the prevention of obliterative airway disease (OAD), the major obstacle after lung transplantation. Methods: Trachea from Brown-Norway (BN) donors were heterotopically transplanted in the greater omentum of Lewis (Lew) rats. Recipients were treated for 28 days with R348 (10, 20, 40, or 80 mg/kg), rapamycin (0.75 or 3 mg/kg), or left untreated. Allografts were recovered and processed for histological evaluation determining degree of luminal obliteration, percentage of respiratory epithelial coverage, and mononuclear cell infiltration. Donor reactive (IgG) antibodies from the recipient's serum were determined using flow cytometry.",

Rapamycin in both concentrations significantly inhibited luminal obliteration (37\u00b115%, 11\u00b16%; p<0.001 vs. no medication) similarly to R348 at 40 and 80 mg/kg.

All R348 treated recipient thymus and spleen weights were significantly lower compared to the untreated group (p=0.001). BUN, Cr, and cholesterol levels were unaffected in R348 treated recipients. Conclusion: R348 potentially exhibits its inhibitory effect by preserving the respiratory epithelium, rather than by rapamycin's mechanism of reduced smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation. R348 occupies a beneficial pharmacokinetic profile, lacks nephrotoxic and atherogenic properties, and provides a favorable alternative to rapamycin in the treatment of chronic rejection in lung transplant recipients. Genz-29155 is a novel, oral immune-modulatory agent identified in a high-throughput screen designed to find inhibitors of TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis. The molecular target of the compound remains under investigation but is likely downstream of the TNF\u03b1 cell surface receptor. In vitro studies have shown Genz-29155 to be an effective inhibitor of the TNF\u03b1-triggered caspase cascade but not anti-CD3 or Fas-mediated apoptosis, and thus may act by inducing allograft resistance to immune attack rather than suppressing the alloimmune response per se. It has been shown to synergize with sirolimus in murine heterotopic cardiac allotransplant models. In order to test this promising new agent in a more clinically relevant model of solid organ transplantation, we studied Genz-29155 in a mismatched NHP (rhesus macaque) renal transplant model. Genz-29155 (n=3) was administered (3mg/kg, IV, Days 0-14) with sirolimus (1mg/kg, PO, Days 0-30). Five control animals received only sirolimus and vehicle (1mg/kg, PO, Days 0-30). All animals were followed serially by polychromatic flow cytometry to determine the relative and absolute number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. Time to allograft rejection, the primary end point, was determined by a significant rise in serum creatinine and BUN, as identified with biweekly monitoring. After diagnosis of rejection, allografts were removed for histological and transcriptional studies, along with splenocytes for immune function assays. In this pilot study, prolongation of rejection-free survival was significantly improved with Genz-29155 and sirolimus combined vs. sirolimus alone (42.67 days vs. 17.20 days, respectively, p = 0.05). Given these initial results, we have initiated a larger study (n=12) to optimize the dose and duration of Genz-29155. Five animals, transplanted within the past month remain alive and well in this study. Further investigation of this agent will allow us to better understand the benefit of inhibiting TNF\u03b1-mediated apoptotic effects in both cellular alloimmune response and allograft injury in solid organ transplantation.",

We have previously reported that LFA-1 inhibition suppresses primary CD8-dependent rejection responses which are not controlled by any conventional immunosuppressive strategy. These studies were conducted to analyze the efficacy of this anti-LFA-1 Ab for control of CD8-dependent responses in sensitized hosts. Methods: FVB/N (H-2 q ) donor hepatocytes were transplanted into C57BL/6 (H-2 b ) or CD4 KO (H-2 b ) recipients. Memory responses were analyzed by retransplantation with a second FVB/N allogeneic hepatocyte transplant. Cohorts of mice were treated with anti-LFA-1 mAb and observed for hepatocyte survival or magnitude of CD8 + T cell mediated allospecific cytolytic activity. Results: The untreated secondary CD4 KO and C57BL/6 recipients rejected hepatocyte allografts with enhanced kinetics in comparison to the primary graft (MST= day 10 vs day 14, and MST= day 7 vs. day 10, respectively; p < 0.05). Anti-LFA-1 mAb treated CD4 KO recipients demonstrated delayed rejection (MST= day 35 vs day 10; p=0.001) compared to secondary rejection in untreated CD4 KO hosts. Anti-LFA-1 mAb treatment did not delay rejection in sensitized C57BL/6 recipients (MST= day 7) but did significantly reduce the in vivo allospecific cytotoxic effector function in C57BL/6 secondary recipients (20.6\u00b14.1%; p=0.001) as compared to untreated controls (97\u00b11.3%). The residual cytotoxicity observed in anti-LFA-1 mAb treated C57BL/6 recipients is comparable to the in vivo cytotoxicity of CD8-depleted C57BL/6 secondary recipients (12.1\u00b18.9%) and is likely mediated by alloantibody. In fact, the level of allospecific cytotoxicity in anti-LFA-1 mAb treated sensitized C57BL/6 recipients correlated with the amount of alloantibody present in recipient serum. Conclusion: In conclusion, treatment with anti-LFA-1 mAb delayed (CD4-independent) CD8-dependent rejection in sensitized recipients but did not delay rejection in sensitized CD4-sufficient C57BL/6 recipients. Despite the efficacy of treatment with anti-LFA-1 mAb to significantly reduce the in vivo allospecific cytotoxic effector function in sensitized C57BL/6 mice this strategy did not delay rejection. This is likely due to alloantibody mediated rejection in sensitized C57BL/6 (but not CD4 KO recipients) which is not suppressed by treatment with anti-LFA-1 mAb.",

Recently, chronic infections with LCMV, HIV or HCV were shown to be associated with functionally anergic T-cells characterized by high expression of the programmed death (PD)-1 molecule. This study was carried out to characterize functional exhaustion of CMV-specific CD4 T-cells as determinant of impaired CMV-control and to elucidate whether the PD-1 pathway may be operative in active CMV-infection after renal transplantation. CMV specific CD4 T cells from 13 controls, 31 hemodialysis patients, and 51 renal transplant patients were quantified using flow cytometry and analysed for their expression of PD-1 and cytokines IFN\u03b3 and IL2. CMV specific proliferation was analysed by CFDA-SE dilution. In viremic transplant-recipients, a significantly higher proportion of CMV-specific CD4 T-cells were PD-1 positive (median 40.9%) as compared to non-viremic transplant patients (8.8%), dialysis-patients (8.8%) or controls (3.1%, p<0.0001). In line with functional impairment, PD-1 positive T-cells produced significantly less IFN\u03b3 per single cell as compared to PD-1 negative T-cells (mean fluorescence intensity 129.4\u00b152.6 versus 256.6\u00b196.1, p<0.0001). Moreover, unlike controls or non-viremic patients, the majority of CMV-specific T-cells from viremic patients showed a long-term loss of IL-2 production. Interestingly, functional anergy of PD-1 positive CMV-specific CD4 T-cells was reversible in that antibody-mediated blockade of PD-1 signaling with its ligands PD-L1/-L2 led to a 10fold increase in CMVspecific proliferation. In conclusion, expression of PD-1 defines a reversible defect of CMV-specific CD4 T-cells, and blocking PD-1 signaling may provide a potential target for enhancing the function of exhausted T-cells in chronic CMV-infection.",

Methods: PCR-based strain typing of CMV was performed using the glycoprotein B gene of CMV (gB1-4) in a cohort of organ transplant recipients with CMV disease. From this, 89 patients were identified that had simultaneous infection with \u2265 2 CMV strains. Quantitative assessment of each of the strain types was performed at regular intervals after starting antiviral therapy. Results: The different types of multi-strain infections were gB1+gB2 (11/89, 12%), gB1+gB3 (22/89,25%), gB1+ gB4 (7/89, 8%), gB2+gB3 (10/89, 11%), gB2+gB4 (6/89, 7%) and gB3+gB4 (8/89, 9%). 25/89 (28%) were simultaneously infected with 3 or 4 different genotypes.

Response to treatment with IVIG was also evaluated. Results: Incidence of infection was 2.4% as 20 patients were found to have evidence of infection. Average time from tx to diagnosis of infection was 21.6 months (range 3 days-86 months). Average creatinine at diagnosis was 2.32 mg/dl. Anemia was present in 85% of patients with an average hematocrit of 30.8%. Proteinuria was present in 45% of patients with evidence of PVB19 infection. Co-infection was noted in 5 patients (4 CMV, 1EBV) and acute rejection was noted in 30% of individuals within 3 months of diagnosis. Collapsing glomerulopathy (CG) was present in 5 patients and they all had subsequent graft loss at an average of 6 months after diagnosis. 4 of the 5 patients with CG had proteinuria along with anemia and were Caucasian. 90% (18/20) of all patients with evidence of PVB19 infection received IVIG and cleared their infection. One of the remaining 2 pts without IVIG spontaneously cleared their virus. Conclusion: Although the incidence of PVB19 infection in our kidney tx cohort was very low, its presence portends an unfavorable outcome. The presence of CG associated with PVB19 is an especially devastating lesion with very poor outcomes. Response to treatment with IVIG and reduction of immunosuppression is variable. Based on our data it seems reasonable to screen all tx patients with unexplained anemia and concurrent proteinuria as early detection of PVB19 may be crucial. Background: Prior to transplant, screening for latent tuberculosis (LTBI) by tuberculin skin test (TST) is recommended. The accuracy of TST in end stage renal disease however may be limited. The Quantiferon\u00ae-TB Gold assay (QFT) detects interferon-\u03b4 produced by peripheral blood T-cells in response to TB specific antigens and may be more accurate for diagnosis of LTBI. Methods: This prospective single center study compared the TST to QFT for the diagnosis of LTBI in a cohort of adult patients listed or undergoing workup for renal transplantation. All patients had both TST and QFT performed. Additional data collected included demographics, TB risk history and chest x-ray results. Based on demographic and radiographic findings, patients were classified as high or low risk for LTBI. A positive TST was defined as \u22655 mm and positive QFT as \u22650.35 IU/ml. Results: A total of 45 patients were enrolled. Complete data was available for 38 subjects (5 did not return to have TST read). The mean age was 50.4 +/-12.2 years with 21 (55.3%) males and 17 (44.7%) females. The most common etiologies of renal diseases were diabetes (52.6%) and glomerulonephritis (26.3%). Most subjects (35 of 38) were on renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis in 73.7% and peritoneal dialysis in 18.4%). Twenty (52.6%) subjects had received BCG and 10 (26.3%) were born in or lived in a country in with TB prevalence rate > 20/100000 population. Fifteen (39.5%) subjects were considered to be at high-risk for LTBI. Overall 5 (13.2%) had a positive TST and 3 (7.9%) had a positive QFT. The QFT was indeterminate in 1 subject due to a low mitogen response. Agreement between the tests was 92% (K=0.72, p<0.0001).",

Increased knowledge of successful HTLV (+) donation and the centers that are willing to utilize these organs in the appropriate setting will help expand the donor pool and decrease mortality on the waiting list.",

Since the long-term impact of alemtuzumab preconditioning combined with tacrolimus monotherapy on EBV immunity after Tx has not been studied, here we aim to analyze the frequency and function of peripheral blood EBV-specific CD8 + T cells. Thirteen EBV + stable kidney transplant (KTx) recipients and 12 EBV + healthy controls were recruited to this cross-sectional study. All patients received alemtuzumab preconditioning, followed by tacrolimus monotherapy. Blood samples were collected at least 1 year post-Tx to allow immune reconstitution. The EBV-specific CD8 + T cell phenotype and function were screened by flow cytometry and IFNg ELISPOT assay. HLA-A201 restricted EBV-lytic (BMLF1) and latent (LMP2a) peptides were used to generate Tetramer (TMR) probes, and for functional screening in ELISPOT. Circulating CD8 + T cells from KTx patients had recovered by 1 year, and were comparable to those of healthy controls (28.6%\u00b112.9 vs 23% \u00b16.6, p=0.2). Moreover, the memory distribution and the frequency of EBV-specific CD8 + T cells detected in patients and controls (BMLF1-specific: 0.56%\u00b10.96 vs 0.88%\u00b11.08, p=0.46, and LMP2specific: 0.05%\u00b10.06 vs 0.24%\u00b10.40 p=0.09) were similar. In contrast, the frequency of functional Type-1 (IFN-g producing) EBV-specific CD8 + T cells was significantly lower in KTx patients than in healthy controls (BMLF1: 47\u00b124 spots/10 5 CD8 T cells vs 164\u00b1134 p=0.06, and LMP2: 9\u00b18 vs 64\u00b154 p=0.03). Accordingly, on average, only 8-12% of circulating EBV-specific CD8 + T cells from KTx patients produced IFN-g, while 20-30% of effector cells were functional in healthy controls. Addition of IL-2 (20IU/ml) during the ELISPOT assay reversed the hypo-responsiveness of Type-1 (IFN-g) EBV-specific CD8 + T in patients (range 3-8 fold increase), suggesting that these effector cells were anergic. These results support the notion that alemtuzumab-induced lymphocyte depletion followed by tacrolimus monotherapy renders EBV-specific CD8 + T cells anergic in vivo, a state that can be readily reversed by cytokines such as IL-2, which are commonly released during immune activation. Background: The epidemiology of the transmission of cytomegalovirus (CMV) from organ donors to recipients is not completely understood. We studied donor to recipient transmission patterns by analyzing viral genomic variants through the use of CMV glycoprotein B (gB) genotyping by real-time PCR. Polymorphisms in gB UL55 allow discrimination of 4 distinct genomic variants (gB 1-4). Methods: Organ transplant recipient pairs or triplets were included in the study if: a) they had CMV infection, b) they received an organ from a CMV seropositive donor, and c) there was at least one other recipient from the same donor that also developed CMV infection. Genotyping (gB 1-4) was performed by quantitative real-time PCR on stored blood samples. Clinical charts were reviewed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcome of CMV infection. Results: Of the 78 CMV seropositive donors screened, 21 were multiple organ donors for which 2 or more of their recipients developed CMV infection. The total number of recipients from these 21 donors was 86 (median of 4 recipients per donor). Of these recipients, 47 (55%) had CMV infection (16 recipient pairs and 5 recipient triplets). The prevalence of genotypes was gB1 (n=22; 47%), gB2 (n=11; 23%), gB3 (n=4; 9%), gB4 (n=0). Mixed infection with two concurrent genotypes was present in 10 patients (21%). Overall concordance between CMV gB genotype in recipient pairs was 62.5% (10/16). If both recipients were CMV seronegative (D+/R-) the gB concordance in recipients was 67% (2/3 pairs). gB concordance was 70% (7/10 pairs) if one of the recipients was seronegative and the other seropositive. Concordance was 33% (1/3 pair) if both recipients were seropositive. Concordance between genotypes was seen in 2/5 (40%) recipients triplets. In seropositive recipients with CMV viremia, the origin of the CMV strain was thought to be donor derived in 11/16 (69%) and of reactivation of the recipients own virus in 5/16 (31%) of the cases. No difference in clinical outcome or organ tropism was seen between genotypes.",

Conclusion: Erk and JNK MAP kinase activation: 1/ are required for TLR4 activationinduced pro-inflammatory gene induction; 2/ play critical role in the development of IR-mediated liver immune response/tissue injury. Background: The JAK/STAT signaling is one of the major pathways for cytokine signal transduction. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is mainly activated by IFN-\u03b1/\u00df/IFN-\u03b3. The activation of STAT1 by IFN-\u03b3 has been implicated in hepatic inflammation. We have shown that activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 complex initiates pro-inflammatory response leading to liver ischemia/reperfusion Abstracts injury (IRI). Indeed, TLR4 signaling in vitro activates STAT1, which in turn triggers production of type-1 IFN-dependent CXCL10 (IP-10). This study was designed to analyze the cross-talk between STAT1 and the MAP kinase (ERK) downstream of JAK/ STAT signaling pathways. Methods & Results: We used a mouse liver model of partial warm ischemia (90 min), followed by reperfusion (6 h) . First, we employed STAT1 KO (n=17) and control WT (n=16) mice. The hepatocellular damage, as measured by sALT levels (IU/L), was significantly decreased in 10/17 STAT1 KO mice (p<0.005); the remaining 7/17 of STAT1 KO showed sALT levels comparable with WT. Hence, we distinguished two groups of STAT1 \"protected\" vs. \"nonprotected\" KO recipients. Histology revealed minimal sinusoidal congestion without edema/vacuolization or necrosis in STAT1 KO \"protected\" group. The induction of mRNA coding for TNF\u03b1/ IL-6 was higher in STAT1 KO \"nonprotected\" livers. The expression of CXCL10, the product of STAT1 activation downstream of TLR4 in Type I IFN pathway, was profoundly and selectively depressed in livers from STAT1 KO \"protected\" mice, as compared to IRI susceptible livers. Similarly, Western blot-assisted phospho-ERK expression was up regulated selectively in the STAT1 KO \"protected\" group. In the second series, C57BL/6 mice were treated 1 h prior to liver ischemic insult with JAK-2 inhibitor (Tyrphostin AG490; 40 mg/kg, i.p.; n=5), or vehicle (n=5). The hepatocellular damage, as measured by sALT levels (IU/L), and histology was significantly decreased in AG490 group, as compared with controls (mean = 12770 vs. 28770; p<0.05).",

However, the blockage of STAT1 alone is insufficient to reproducibly exert cytoprotection. As JAK2 is upstream of STAT1 as well as upstream of MAP kinase (ERK), this study highlights the role of both signaling pathways in hepatic IRI. Purpose: TLR4 is required for maximal ischemic injury of the heart, liver, lung, and kidney. To better understand the mechanisms of TLR4 action, we investigated a murine model of ischemic kidney disease and examined endothelial TLR4 expression. Methods: 1. Animal ischemia reperfusion injury(IRI): the right kidney of wildtype(WT) C57BL/10, or TLR4-deficient(KO) C57BL/10ScN mice was removed. The left pedicle was clamped for 23 min, followed by 4 hr reperfusion. Sham animals were controls. 2. Bone-marrow chimera: four groups of BM chimeras were created: WT\u2192WT; KO\u2192WT; WT\u2192KO; KO\u2192KO (8 recipients/grp). 8 wks later, chimerism was confirmed by tail and blood genotyping, and mice subjected to renal IRI. 3. TLR4 mRNA detected by DIG-labeled antisense; TLR4 on endothelium by anti-TLR4 and anti-CD31. 4. Total genome mRNA expression on ischemic vs. sham WT mice, ischemic vs. sham KO mice(4 mice/grp) determined using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430.2 GeneChips followed by Genesifter analysis. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR confirmed candidate genes. 5. MS1 endothelial cells were treated with H 2 O 2 (500uM) for 30 min, cultured for 4 hr and then expression of TLR4 and endothelial genes determined. Results: TLR4-deficient mice had less renal injury as assessed by pathology and function. Radiation chimeras showed that radioresistant parenchymal cells and radiosensitive leukocytes were both required for maximal injury. Immunohistology and in situ hybridization identified endothelia in the outer medulla as a major TLR4 expressing cell type at 4 hr post-reperfusion. Genechip analysis revealed a panel of cytokine, chemokines, proinflammatory and cell-cycle related genes that were differentially expressed on IRI versus sham kidneys. Real-time RT-PCR confirmed that the following pro-inflammatory endothelial genes increased after ischemia in wildtype but not TLR4 KO mice: TLR4, Pentraxin related gene(PTX3), and Endothelial cell-specific molecule 1(ESM1). Real-time RT-PCR showed that in vitro H 2 O 2 treatment of endothelial cells induced expression of TLR4(6.6-fold), PTX3(4.6-fold), and ESM1(69-fold).",

Primary cultures of mouse tubular cells (TECs) were also subjected to ischaemia (mineral oil overlay for 1 hr) or TLR4 activation (LPS stimulation). BM chimeric mice were generated by transplanting BM into irradiated recipient mice before IRI was induced. Results. RAE-1 mRNA level in IRI kidney was increased from day 1 to day 5, peaking at day 3 compared to sham operated kidney (14-48 fold increase, P < 0.001) measured by real time PCR. RAE-1 protein was detected in renal tubular cells from ischemic kidney but not from shamoperated control by flow cytometry. MULT-1 mRNA expression was also increased from day 1 to day 5 (15-51 fold increase, P <0.005). Both RAE-1 and MULT-1 mRNA levels were reduced in TLR4 -/and MyD88 -/-IRI kidneys (2-8 fold reduction) versus WT controls (P < 0.01). TLR4 -/and MyD88 -/primary cultured TECs submitted to IRI in vitro also showed less RAE1 and MULT-1 mRNA expression than WT controls (p < 0.01). LPS stimulated RAE-1 and MULT-1 expression in WT but not in TLR4 -/-TECs. TLR4 -/mice bearing WT hemopoietic cells had significantly lower kidney RAE-1 and MULT-1 mRNA expression after IRI versus WT mice with TLR4 -/-BM (p < 0.05). Conclusion. Kidney IRI causes RAE-1 and MULT-1 expression and kidney parenchymal cells are the dominant source. TECs can be stimulated to express RAE-1 and MULT-1 by ischemia or LPS via the TLR4 pathway in vitro and deficiencies in this pathway provide protection against IRI and RAE-1 and MULT-1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Thus, kidney IRI causes upregulation of NKG2D ligands by parenchymal kidney cells via TLR4. Background: Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major clinical problem. Although Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been implicated as a potential link between the innate and adaptive immunity, little is known on its role in intestinal IRI. Our preliminary research in intestinal IRI has shown that, compared to sham controls, WT mice had decreased survival, worse tissue injury/apoptosis, increased PMN infiltration, increased CD3+ cell infiltration, and increased production of TLR4, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Here we used TLR4KO mice to further investigate the role of TLR4 in intestinal IRI and its effects on cytokine/chemokine programs and apoptotic signaling. Methods: C57BL10 WT and TLR4KO mice underwent 100 min of total jejunoileal warm IRI by clamping of the SMA. Separate survival and analysis groups were performed.",

Tissue analysis included histopathology, CD3 immunostaining, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, RT-PCR for chemokines/ cytokines, and Western blots for apoptotic and HO-1 protein expression. Results: TLR4KO had superior survival compared to WT (100% vs. 33%, p<0.02). On histopathology TLR4KO had near normal-appearing villous architecture, while in contrast, WT showed mucosal erosions and villous congestion/hemorrhage. TLR4KO had reduced CD3+ cell infiltration as compared to WT (3.9\u00b10.7 vs. 6.2\u00b11.4 per hpf at 4h, p<0.001; and 4.8\u00b11.1 vs. 7.0\u00b12.3 per hpf at 24h, p<0.02). Early MPO activity was also reduced in TLR4KO (0.11\u00b10.06 vs. 0.88\u00b10.5 U/g at 4h, p<0.005). RT-PCR analysis demonstrated decreased production of mRNA for IP-10, MCP-1, RANTES, and IFN-\u03b3 and increased production of IL-13 in TLR4KO. There was decreased protein expression of caspase-3 and increased expression of bcl-2 and HO-1 in TLR4KO mice. Conclusion: The genetic absence of TLR4 exerts protection against intestinal IRI, demonstrating for the first time that TLR4 is required for intestinal IRI. The absence of TLR4 signaling reduces IRI through reduced neutrophil and T cell chemotaxis, and up-regulation of protective molecules. These results support data that TLR4 is a mechanistic link between the innate and adaptive immunity, implicating TLR4 as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of intestinal IRI. It is well known that liver steatosis increases hepatic vulnerability to ischemia/ reperfusion (I/R) injury as part of the transplantation process. Endotoxin (LPS) is thought to be a major contributing factor to the pathogensis of I/R. During portal occlusion, LPS is translocated across the mesenteric tissue barrier into the portal circulation, and is delivered as a large bolus to the liver at the point of reperfusion. At this time, LPS is mainly recognized by toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). This leads to downstream signaling and the production of proinflammatory products that ultimately lead to cellular inflammation, necrosis, and apoptosis. It is well known that steatotic livers are highly sensitive to endotoxin as compared to their lean counterparts post-I/R, and we have previously seen that monoclonal antibody blockade of endotoxin dramatically improves animal survival after I/R. Therefore, we propose the novel hypothesis that TLR4 signaling is a major contributor to cellular damage after steatotic hepatic I/R. To test this hypothesis, we subjected male 4-week-old C57BL/10J (control) or C57BL/10ScN (TLR4 deficient, TLR4KO) mice to a high-fat diet (HFD) for four weeks. Then, we subjected the animals to 35 minutes of total hepatic ischemia and 1 or 24 hours of reperfusion. There was a dramatic improvement in animal survival in the HFD TLR4KO animals versus control HFD animals at 24 hours (74% vs. 31% in control HFD animals, p<0.05).",

Methods: Partial warm ischemia was produced in the left and middle hepatic lobes of C57BL/6 mice for 90 min, followed by 6-24h of reperfusion. Mice were treated with NE inhibitor (NEI; 2mg/kg p.o.; GW311616A; n=6) or control (n=6) at 60 min prior to the ischemia insult. After 6h or 24h of reperfusion, sAST/sALT levels and intrahepatic neutrophil accumulation (Myeloperoxidase [MPO] activity) were assessed. The pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6), chemokine (CXCL-1, CXCL-2, IP-10) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 gene expression profiles were screened by RT-PCR. Liver samples were collected for histological grading, and detection of neutrophil infiltration by the naphtol AS-D chloroacetate esterase stains. Results: NEI treatment significantly reduced sAST/sALT levels, as compared with controls (17695\u00b13413 vs 10990\u00b12411; p<0.05 / 33650\u00b13793 vs 13510\u00b16809; p<0.01 at 6 h, and 11778\u00b13113 / 14483\u00b13972 vs 3565\u00b1957 / 4810\u00b11063; p<0.01 at 24h).

TLR4 expression was selectively diminished in NEI pretreated livers (6h; p<0.01). Histological examination of liver sections has revealed that unlike in controls, NEI treatment markedly reduced edema, diminished centrilobular ballooning/sinusoidal congestion, ameliorated hepatocellular necrosis, and decreased local neutrophil infiltration. Conclusion: The inhibition of NE ameliorated hepatocellular damage, reduced local inflammatory responses, and neutrophil activity/infiltration in a stringent mouse liver model of warm IRI.

Methods: Using a partial liver warm ischemia model, C57BL/6 wide-type (WT) mice (n=6/gr) were injected with HO-1 siRNA/nonspecific control siRNA (2 mg/kg, i.v. at day -1) or Ad-HO-1/Ad-\u03b2-gal (2.5x10 9 pfu, i.v. at day -2). Sham control WT underwent the same procedures, but without vascular occlusion. Mice were sacrificed at 6 h of reperfusion; liver tissue and blood samples were collected for future analysis. In in vitro studies, YPEN-1 endothelium cells were transfected with HO-1 siRNA (100 nM) or Ad-HO-1/ Ad-\u03b2-gal. Results: HO-1 siRNA treated mice showed significantly increased sGOT levels (IU/L), as compared with nonspecific control siRNA or Ad-HO-1 (7593\u00b12859 vs. 3104\u00b11777 and 211.5\u00b140, respectively; p<0.05). These correlated with histologic Suzuki's grading of liver I/R injury, with HO-1 siRNA showing significant edema, sinusoidal congestion/cytoplasmic vacuolization, and severe hepatocellular necrosis; nonspecific control siRNA showed moderate edema, sinusoidal congestion/cytoplasmic vacuolization. In contrast, Ad-HO-1 revealed only minimal sinusoidal congestion without edema or necrosis. HO-1 siRNA significantly increased local neutrophil accumulation and caspase-3 activity, and increased the frequency of apoptotic cells (31.8\u00b15.5 vs.",

We retrospectively reviewed our casuistry type 1 diabetic kidney-transplanted patients who underwent islet transplantation using an immunosuppressive protocol based on ATG or Daclizumab (as induction treatment) plus cyclosporine and MMF as maintenance therapy. 45 patients underwent islet after kidney transplantation in our center. Thirty-four patients received a time course of ATG as induction (125 mg per day for 7-10 days), (number of islet infused=499,596\u00b128,780), and 9 patients received Daclizumab at induction (1 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 10 weeks); (number of islets=486,108\u00b170,644).

In conclusion, ATG can provide a good protection towards both allo and auto immune response. The next step will be to use ATG in a calcineurin free protocol, allowing a better expansion of T-regs. Introduction: Despite consistent achievement of insulin-independence, recent data indicate that the long term success of islets transplants using the Edmonton protocol is <10% at 5 years. The cause of the nearly universal late islet allograft failure remains unknown but hypotheses include: allo or autoimmune injury, marginal mass exhaustion, hepatic site related dysfunction, and immunosuppression toxicity. We examined the series of islet transplants performed at our institution and noted marked differences in the outcome and complications in IA and IAK groups. Our results may provide insight as to the cause of chronic islet loss. Methods: Thirty-one islet infusions were administered to IA (n=9) and IAK (n=8) Type-1 diabetics between 9/2001-11/2007. IA and IAK had similar demographics and transplanted islet mass (13,838 vs 13,411 IEq/kg). IA received Edmonton like immunosuppression with Zenapax induction and CNI/SRL, whereas IAK patients received Zenapax and: CNI/MMF/pred (6), CNI/MMF (1), CNI/SRL (1)). Results: Insulin-independence was achieved in all but 2 patients who completed therapy (2 others withdrew). Compared with IA, IAK exhibited better glycemic control (6-month mean HbA1c 6.5 vs 6.1, stimulated C-peptide 2.3 vs 6.0), and improved islet survival; all IA eventually failed and only 1/8 were insulin free for >2-years, whereas only 3/7 IAK grafts have failed with 4 exhibiting continued robust function at >38,>38,>46, and >58 months with 3/4 fully insulin independent. In addition, all IA patients demonstrated immune sensitization post graft failure versus 0/8 IAK. All 9 IA developed mouth ulcers versus only 1/8 IAK.",

We describe a novel immunosuppressive protocol using sirolimus and the anti-LFA 1 antibody efalizumab that permits prolonged islet allograft survival without the need for steroids or calcineurin inhibitors (CI). Methods: Between February and August 2007, 4 consecutive type 1 diabetic patients with hypoglycemic unawareness and normal renal function received allogeneic pancreatic islet transplants. Induction immunosuppression consisted of 2 doses of thymoglobulin given on pre-transplant days -2 and -1, efalizumab (5mg/kg sq/week starting on d -1), and sirolimus. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of sirolimus and efalizumab. Results: All patients achieved insulin independence after single islet infusions (mean IEQ/kg=8,905). Three of 4 remain insulin independent 4 or more months after transplant (table 1) . Patient 1 resumed low dose insulin (approximately 15% of original dose) 6 weeks after transplant and is awaiting a second islet infusion. Her blood glucose control is markedly improved and she has not experienced any hypoglycemic episodes. All patients show persistent c-peptide secretion and have stable renal function. Side effects due to efalizumab were limited to transient irritation at the injection site. Conclusions: Thymoglobulin induction followed by sirolimus and efalizumab maintenance is well tolerated and allows prolonged islet allograft survival. This protocol is the first CI/steroid free islet regimen resulting in insulin independence with a single donor islet infusion. By eliminating CI, this protocol minimizes renal and islet toxicity and may thus improve long-term islet survival and function.",

However, the hope this approach would result in long-term freedom from exogenous insulin has failed in practice. Techniques for isolating islets have advanced and with availability of new IS agents, strategies can now be developed specifically for IsTx that will provide greater immunologic protection w/o diabetogenic side effects. Rejection/ vascularization still remain major limitations for success of IsTx. We hypothesize that BM is an accessible, immunologic privileged space with natural well-developed vasculature and may be a suitable site for IsTx. Method Wistar rats were used as donors/ recipients. DM was induced by iv-streptozocin. Rats who had morning Glc levels > 300 mg/dl on two separate occasions were used as recipients. PTx was performed as normal rodent standard. Islets were isolated from pancreas by distending pancreatic duct with Liberase. Islets were separated on a discontinuous histopaque density gradient, further purified, counted, divided into aliquots transplanted into different sites (liver, BM). BW, Glc and C-Pep were measured in all groups before/after Tx. Background: In February 2007, the islet community was notified of a possible bovine product contamination in the collagenase enzyme (Liberase HI) used for human islet isolations.

These patients are considered high risk for AR, particularly antibody mediated rejection (AMR). Here we examined our AR rates and treatment outcomes for our HS kidney transplant (KT) recipients using our most current desensitization strategies. Methods: Between June 2004 (when rituximab was introduced to our desensitization and treatment protocols) to July 2007, 130 HS KT patients were transplanted using combinations of high-dose IVIG, rituximab, and plasmapheresis (PP) for desensitization. We examined the overall AR, C4d-cell-mediated (CMR), and C4d+AMR rates. AMR episodes were treated with steroids, high-dose IVIG, and rituximab. Refractory and rapidly progressive AMR was treated with PP. Treatment outcomes and differences in AR rates between deceased (DD) and living donors (LD) was examined. Recent reports suggest that treatment with the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, Rituximab (Rtx) may improve renal graft survival in antibody mediated rejection (AMR); however optimal dosing for this indication is unknown. We examined the efficacy of a single low dose (500mg) of Rtx for treatment of refractory AMR in order to limit significant infective complications associated with conventional dosing regimens (375mg/m 2 ). Rtx was used in seven consecutive patients who had refractory AMR as judged by ongoing biopsy evidence of AMR after 4 weeks of standard therapy consisting of pulse methylprednisolone and plasma exchange with low dose IVIg (100mg/kg) (PE/IVIg). All patients received Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate Mofetil. AMR was defined as 1) characteristic histology on biopsy (Banff criteria), 2) graft dysfunction and 3) presence of a donor specific anti-HLA antibody (DSAb). B-cell counts (CD19) and serum creatinine (SCr) were monitored. PE/IVIg was ceased in all cases after Rtx dosing. The average follow-up since Rtx dosing is 16.8 months (range 5.3-28.9 mths). All patients still have functioning grafts (100% 12 month graft and patient survival), with current mean SCr levels (156\u00b117\u00b5mol/L) significantly lower than mean peak rejection levels (514\u00b1355\u00b5mol/L) p=0.05.

However, no advantages were seen in survival rates. The present investigator-initiated, observational follow-up study collected data on patients included in the original cohort of 448 patients who participated in this large study and who were randomised to a triple immunosuppressive regimen consisting of tacrolimus, azathioprine and steroids (TAC/AZA/STER, n= 303) or cyclosporine, AZA and steroids (CSA/AZA/STER, n=145). Efficacy and safety parameters assessed at follow-up included: acute rejection; patient and graft survival; renal function, vital signs, basic lab results and immunosuppressive regimen for the patients 10 years after completion of the original study. Results: Currently, data are available from 75% of the patients. All assessments were conducted following the intent-to-treat principles. More patients in the TAC than in the CSA group remained on the randomised treatment. While Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimates for patient survival at year 11 show comparable (72% TAC vs 72%CSA) results, K-M estimates for graft survival demonstrate an advantage for the tacrolimus cohort (51% TAC vs 46% CSA). Graft half-life estimates (Gjertson and Terasaki method) yielded overall results of 14.2 years (TAC) and 11.4 years (CS). In both treatment groups, AR was associated with inferior long-term results. For patients with AR, half-life estimates were 11.1 and 7.8 years for TAC and CSA, respectively, while in patients without AR half-lives were 19.2 (TAC) and 15.8 (CS) years. Mean serum creatinine after 10 years was significantly lower in the TAC cohort vs the CSA group (1.65mg/dL TAC vs 2.01mg/ dL CSA, p<0.05). Mean glomerular filtration rates (MDRD4 estimate) were 48.7 mL/ min in TAC and 41.9 mL/min in CS. After ten years of follow-up, the mean (C-0) levels were 7.6 mg/mL (TAC) and 120 mg/mL (CS). Conclusion: Analysis of this long term follow-up of a large study confirms the benefits of a tacrolimus-based therapy. It also confirms the concept that freedom from early acute rejection is associated with superior long term results in renal fuction. Therefore, long term renal allograft function is remarkably good in TAC patients.",

The majority (n=32) were 0A transplants (40%) followed by 0B (n=19; 23%), AAB (n=17; 21%), BAB (n=7; 9%) and 0AB (n=6; 7%). Overall survival comparison showed no significant difference in long-term survival (10-year) Recent data has shown the utility of urinary biomarkers to predict delayed graft function early following renal transplantation, but their ability to predict longer-term allograft function is less clear. We evaluated whether urinary biomarkers measured in the early post-transplant period would predict allograft function at 6 and 12 months after renal transplantation. Urinary biomarkers including N-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) were measured in 20 patients at hours 0, 6, 12, 24 and days 2 and 3 following renal transplantation. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at 6 and 12 months were calculated using the MDRD equation. All 20 patients had functional allografts at 6 months and 2 patients lost allografts after 6 months. Levels of individual biomarkers at different post-transplant time points were correlated with 6 and 12 month GFR using Spearman's correlation (rho) and are shown in the Urinary NAG levels at post-transplant hours 0, 6, 24 and days 2 and 3 showed significant negative correlation with 6-month GFR. NAG levels at hour 24 and days 2 and 3 maintained the significant negative correlation with 12-month GFR. Urinary KIM-1 levels at the 24 hour point showed significant negative correlation with 6-month GFR and KIM-1 levels at hour 24 and day 2 displayed significant negative correlation with 12-month GFR. Urinary MMP-9 levels at no time points had significant correlation with either 6-month or 12-month GFR. Urinary biomarkers particularly NAG shows promise as a tool in the early prediction of longer-term allograft function following renal transplantation.",

In summary, no significant differences were observed in HCV(+) recipients according to HCV serology of the donor, in terms of death censored graf survival, patient survival and evolution of liver disease. Therefore, our experience clearly demonstrates that the use of kidneys from HCV(+) donors into HCV(+) recipients is a safe strategy in the long-term and a wise way of using these kidneys, that otherwise would be lost at a moment of shortage. Introduction: Deceased donor kidneys are allocated to adult candidates in the U.S. primarily by waiting time and HLA similarity. We investigated two alternative allocation systems, LYFT-SCD and LYFT-DY, that prioritize offers of kidneys to adults based in part on LYFT. Methods: Based on characteristics of each candidate and donor, LYFT was calculated as the difference between expected median years of life for the candidate with that kidney donor transplant (tx) versus without a kidney. Years on dialysis were weighted at 0.8 of years with a functioning graft. The relative risk of graft failure for each donor was calculated from donor factors using a Cox model and the Donor Profile Index (DPI), the percentile score of that risk among kidneys used in 2003 (100%=greatest risk of graft failure). Using actual candidates and deceased donors and acceptance patterns from 2003, we modeled allocation with the Kidney-Pancreas Simulated Allocation Model (KPSAM). KPSAM sequentially offers kidneys to candidates according to user-specified allocation rules, and models the probability for kidney placement and post-tx survival. The LYFT-SCD model allocated SCD kidneys by LYFT and ECD kidneys by Dialysis Years (DY). The LYFT-DY model allocated organs according to the formula [.8LYFT(1-DPI)]+[DY(.8DPI+.2)]+[4PRA/100] to adult kidney tx candidates. Results: The table compares a year's worth of kidney-alone recipient characteristics, lifespan after tx and additional lifespan (v. dialysis) due to tx among all kidney (including SPK) recipients, and the donor/recipient age correlation (R) under current national kidney allocation, allocation using LYFT for SCD, and allocation using LYFT-DY within each donation service area. Conclusions: Allocation systems incorporating LYFT have the potential to increase the number of years of life attainable from tx and are being considered for the allocation of kidneys within the U.S. Introduction : Organ shortage for transplantation has led to the use of marginal kidneys, which has been associated with poorer but still acceptable results. In our center, the transplantation of two very marginal kidneys into a single recipient was used as a strategy to increase the number of organs available. The present study reports renal function and survival of dual-kidney transplants (DKT) performed at our institution. Methods : From October 1999 to June 2007, 392 transplants were performed at our center, from which 63 were DKT. Kidney selection for a DKT was based on refusal of the kidneys for single kidney transplantation (SKT), donor's age \u2265 60 years and \u226515% of glomerulosclerosis on pre-implantation biopsy. The calculated creatinine clearance (crcl, ml/min), graft and recipient survival from DKT were compared to those of SKT from ECD (based on UNOS criteria, n=66) and ideal donors (ID, aged 10 to 39 y, n= 63) over a seven-year period.",

Dual transplants were offered to older recipients by design (60, 50, 44). Delayed graft function was more prevalent for DKT and ECD than with ID (27%, 29%, 11%). Twelve, 36 and 84-month crcl were similar for DKT and ECD but lower than ID (twelve months: 58, 59, 81; 36 months: 54, 60, 82; 84 months: 62, 51, 86, respectively). Patient survival, actuarial graft survival and actuarial graft survival censored for death were similar between the 3 groups. Conclusion : To our knowledge, this study reports short and long-term outcome of the largest cohort of DKT performed at a single institution. It shows that dual-kidney transplantation is a more complex intervention with more risks of surgical and post-op complications (data not shown). However, with adequate surgical expertise, DKT patients can expect long-term results comparable or even better than ECD. In our center, the use of DKT has increased the number of transplantations by 19% for the period of study. It allowed older patients to receive a graft within shorter delays. Moreover, it permitted a more judicious allocation of a resource that is still limited.",

For nationally exported kidneys, CIT was 27.3h BD and 26.8h AD; 17.9% of nationally exported kidneys had CIT>36h BD, as compared with 16.1% AD. The same HUCs of exported kidneys BD were also HUCs AD. Of the top 10 centers utilizing exported kidneys BD, only one was not within the top 10 centers utilizing exported kidneys AD. When we looked at CIT for kidneys exported to HUCs, again there was little difference before or after DonorNet, with a trend to possibly longer CIT for HUCs. For kidneys regionally exported to HUCs, cold ischemia time (CIT) was 23.1h before DonorNet (BD) and 23.4h after DonorNet (AD); 7% of regionally exported kidneys had CIT>36h BD, as compared with 10.4% AD.

Introduction: Split liver transplantation has been adopted as an alternative to expand the organ donor pool. While the Adult/Child Split Liver (A/CSL) in which an extended right graft (ERG) is transplanted into an adult and a left lateral segment (LLS), transplanted into a child, has gained a wide acceptance within the transplantation community, Adult/ Adult Split Liver (A/ASL) in which the liver is split into a full right (FR) and full left (FL) is still performed very rarely. We analyzed the experience at our Center with split liver grafts over a period of 10 years. Material and Methods: Between October 1997 and October 2007 we performed a total of 676 liver transplants in 625 recipients (370/328 children and 306/297 adults). Among the 593 (310 children and 283 adults) recipients of a primary isolated liver transplant, 281 (247 children and 34 adult) were transplanted with a A/C or A/A SL. The recipients of a whole size graft (249 adults and 63 children) were used as a control. Results: Adults: 34 patients received a split liver graft (26 ERG graft and 8 FL/FR grafts) and 249 a whole liver graft. Overall the incidence of biliary complications using a split liver graft was 29% and with a whole liver graft 15% (p= 0,0506).For the recipients of a split liver graft 1 and 5 years patient and graft survival was 91%/88% and 88%/85%. Recipients of a whole liver graft had a 1 and 5 years patient / graft survival of 85%/84% and 80%/78% respectively. Children: 247 children received a split graft (230 LLS, 12 ERG and 5 FL) and 63 a whole size graft. Biliary complications occurred in 42% of the recipients of a split liver graft and 5% of the recipients of a whole size graft (p < 0,0001). Among the recipients of a split graft 1 and 5 years patient / graft survival was 91%/84% and 87%/80% respectively. The recipient of a whole size graft had a 1 and 5 years patient / graft survival of 84%/78% and 83%/74%. Conclusion: Incidence of biliary complications is significantly higher using a split graft. At a high volume Center, use of split liver grafts reached comparable and even better results of a whole liver graft in terms of patient and graft survival. Thus, the use of split grafts should be strongly encouraged to expand the donor pool.",

Cost data, acquired from the hospital financial database and inflation adjusted and clinical outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. Background: Liver transplant recipients with (GW/RW) < 0.8% are thought to have a higher incidence of post-operative complications, including small for size syndrome (SFSS), and overall inferior outcomes. We analyzed a cohort of partial liver graft recipients and compared those with GW/RW < 0.8% to those with GW/RW > 0.8%. Results: Between 1999 and 2007, 107 adult patients underwent partial graft liver transplant. Seventy-six grafts were from live donors (LDLT) and the remaining 31 were from deceased donor split-liver transplants (SLT). Of these, 22 patients had GW/ RW < 0.8% (12 LDLT, 10 SLT), and 85 had GW/RW > 0.8% (64 LDLT, 21 SLT). Median follow-up was 46.1 months and did not differ between the two groups. Baseline demographics including donor and recipient age, and MELD at the time of transplant also did not differ between groups (Table) . Three-month and 1-year graft survival for the two groups was comparable. Three recipients with GW/RW < 0.8% developed SFSS (13.6%); all three had inflow modification with splenic artery ligation (SAL), and 1 of the 3 grafts was lost at one-year. Eight recipients with GW/RW > 0.8% developed SFSS (9.4%) (p = ns); six underwent SAL and none had graft loss at one-year. There was a trend toward increased hepatic artery thrombosis with the smaller grafts that did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.10). The incidence of other surgical complications was similar between the two groups (Table) . The diagnosis of rejection in post-transplant kidney disease depends largely on the assessment of biopsy pathology, which suffers from arbitrary scoring, subjectivity, and sampling variance. With microarray gene expression data from 186 biopsies for cause, we used Predictive Analysis of Microarrays (PAM) to build a rejection classifier. Because of the imperfect gold standard, the classifier cannot and should not have extremely high predictive accuracy. The goal was to see if microarrays could detect a robust rejection signature despite this uncertainty, and to identify the top genes distinguishing rejecting from non-rejecting biopsies. By examining discrepancies between pathology diagnoses and PAM predictions, and using clinical follow-up information, we combine the strengths of each method to produce a more accurate diagnostic system. Biopsies with rejection plus clinical episodes (Fig. 1 ) have higher positive predictive value than those lacking episodes. The majority of episodes occur in the top part of Fig.1 , indicating that a valid rejection signature is being detected. Of the exceptions, most had been treated with steroids before the biopsy, suppressing their gene expression patterns. Samples called borderline rejection separated into two distinct high/low probability groups using PAM, with all the cases classified as clinical rejection episodes occurring in the high probability group.",

We hypothesized that genetic variations within the TLR4 gene of the kidney donor affects the rate of delayed graft function (DGF). Methods: We genotyped the functional TLR4 polymorphisms (SNPs) D299G (rs4986790) and T399I (rs4986791) in 268 kidney donors from 2 centers and correlated them with the occurrence of DGF. DGF was defined as the need of dialysis within 7 days post-transplant or less than 25% drop in creatinine within the first 24 hours after transplant. In a sample of 67 patients from one center, we analysed intragraft HMGB-1 (High Mobility Group Box Protein-1) gene expression in pre-and post-implantation biopsies. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical package. Results: Both TLR4 SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, and were combined for further analysis. Recipients of a TLR4 mutated kidney showed a significant lower rate of DGF (p=0.005), which was persistent after correction for known donor-derived risk factors (donor age, ECD vs. DCD-kidney, cold ischemia time, p=0.007, HR 4.42, CL 1.51-12.94). Additionally, we confirmed the presence of a possible TLR4 ligand, HMGB-1, in pre-and post-implantation biopsies. We also confirmed the presence of a functional TLR4 receptor in human proximal tubular cells which expressed MCP-1, IL1-\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 after specific TLR4 agonist treatment. Conclusion: Human renal tubular epithelial cells express TLR4 and a functional TLR4 SNP in donor kidney is associated with lower rate of delayed graft function. Background: Methylation of promoter CpG islands has been associated with gene silencing and demonstrated to lead to chromosomal instability. We postulate that differences in methylation patterns observed in tissues ranging from normal to cirrhosis to HCC may lead to the discovery of direct precipitating events that contribute to tumorigenesis in HCV-HCC patients.",

METHODS: 36 paired pre-and post-transplant (mean time 25 months) serum samples from 18 pediatric kidney allograft recipients were used for identification of de novo non-HLA antibody formation assessed using Invitrogen ProtoArray (v3), measuring signal post-pre. Probes from the Protoarray and cDNA microarray platforms were re-annotated to current NCBI Entrez gene identifiers using AILUN. 34 cDNA arrays (GSE:3931) from 7 normal kidney regions (inner and outer cortex, inner and outer medulla, papillary tips, renal pelvis and glomeruli; see Table) were analyzed for compartment-specific genes by SAM, and the highest-ranked genes in each compartment (KS two-sample test p < 0.001) and were ranked against each individual patient's numerical antibody response across the 5057 proteins on the Protoarray. RESULTS: In 83% of patients (15/18), kidney-specific serological responses against the renal pelvis were the first to be detected, followed by responses against renal cortex. Control gene expression data sets from other solid organs (GSE: 1133; lung, heart, pancreas) did not demonstrate immune-response enrichment. The presence of these antibodies was not associated with donor specific HLA class I or II antibody levels. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated de novo formation of circulating non-HLA non-ABO antibodies after txp, irrespective of HLA antibodies, are detected against kidneyspecific protein targets. As these antibodies are not seen against other solid organs, the response is likely allogeneic. The renal pelvis and renal cortex have the highest immunogenic potential. We conclude that urinary cell mRNA profiles that include levels of mRNA encoding tubular proteins and mRNA encoding proteins implicated in EMT offers a noninvasive means ascertaining renal allograft status with respect to presence or absence of CAN.",

Gene Ontology and Signaling pathway analyses showed many of the transcripts to be involved in pro-inflammatory and immune response signaling pathways (ex. TLR, IL-10/-2, etc). Custom TLDAs were used to study several genes considered not detected by microarray. This included TGF-\u03b21, CD-3E/-28/-74 and VEGF, all of which were significantly up-regulated in multiple comparisons. Conclusions: Persistent changes in pro-inflammatory transcripts occur in all renal transplants. This \"transplant effect\" cannot be explained by calcineurin-inhibitors (occurs in Tac-free immunosuppression), increased alloreactivity (similar in HLA identical/ non-identical) or fibrosis. A likely cause is persistent changes from IR injury. The role of the \"transplant effect\" in long-term allograft survival is unclear, but it likely interacts with other forms of graft injury. BACKGROUND: A critical 26 gene-set for acute renal rejection (AR) diagnosis in peripheral blood has been previously identified by our group using cross-platform hybridization of 91 unique peripherla blood samples with matched biopsy diagnosis, with AR (n=39) and without AR (STA; n=52), with cross-hybridization across 3 human microarray platforms: 30k cDNA Lymphochip, 44k Agilent and 54k Affymetrix HU133plus. In this study we proposed to verify and validate this gene-set for AR diagnosis and prediction by peripheral blood PCR-based analysis. METHOD: 57/91 peripheral blood samples from the microarray gene-set were selected for 384-well format multiplex ABI-Taqman qPCRv validation of AR diagnosis across the 26 gene-set. An independant set of 66 new, time and immunosuppression matched, peripheral blood samples (30STA, 36AR) were used as a test-set for blinded prediction of AR diagnosis using qPCR across the most informative 8 genes. 42 sequential samples from 14 AR patients (at AR, 1-3 months prior to, and after AR) were also examined by qPCR for these 8 genes for blinded AR prediction, prior to biopsy proven AR. Prediction models were generated using logistic regression analysis and p<0.05 considered significant. RESULT: In the validation set of 57 samples, 8/26 genes were highly significant for confirming peripheral blood-AR diagnosis (p<0.03). In the test group of 66 samples, AR was predicted with a very high level of sensitivity and specificity (PPV and NPV> 90%).",

            "text": "Tolerance/Immune Deviation II Background: Our previous studies showed that regulatory T cells (Treg) execute suppressive function in both the inflammatory site of the allograft and the draining lymph node (dLN) to suppress allograft rejection. We explored how Treg influenced the migration and function of antigen specific effector T cells and dendritic cells (DC) at these two sites in an islet transplant model. Methods: Treg were sorted from wild type or CCR7 -/-C57BL/6 mice, labeled with PKH26, and transferred directly to islet allografts (BALB/c into C57BL/6). Effector CD4 T cells (Te) from alloantigen specific T cell receptor transgenic mice were labeled with CSFE and transferred intravenously. Treg and Te migration to islet grafts and dLN were analyzed with flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Chemokine expression was determined by RT-PCR. CX3CR1 GFP mice, in which DC are internally labeled with GFP, served as islet donors, and donor DC migration was tracked with fluorescence microscopy. Results: During priming and rejection, islet allografts expressed a panel of inflammatory chemokines shortly after transplantation that recruited Te to the islets. Te accumulated and proliferated in both the islet allograft and the dLN. Concomitantly, donor derived DC migrated from the islet to the dLN as early as 1 day after transplantation. Local transfer of Treg into the islet allograft inhibited islet chemokine expression, inhibited donor DC migration in an IL-10 and TGFb dependent fashion, and reduced Te migration to and proliferation in the graft. The transferred Treg also migrated from the islet allograft to the dLN, and directly inhibited Te accumulation and proliferation in the dLN, and migration of Te to the islet. CCR7 -/-Treg, which could not migrate to the dLN but were retained within the graft, and were far less effective than wild type Treg in inhibiting Te migration and proliferation into both the islets and dLN. Conclusions: Treg migrate to the islet and suppress parenchymal cell chemokine expression, DC migration, and Te responses in the islet allograft. Treg also migrate to the dLN to suppress Te proliferation and migration. Treg trafficking from the allograft to the dLN is crucial for suppressive function in order to target the separate effector mechanisms. These results demonstrate novel and important functions for migration in Treg induced suppression and graft survival.",

Here we use Foxp3red fluorescent protein reporter knock-in mice to study Treg homeostasis and identify the mechanisms by which \u03b1-CD45RB induces Tregs. CFSE-stained highly sort-Abstracts purified Foxp3+ or Foxp3-cells were adoptively transferred into fully replete naive wt congenic mice. Whereas only 5-10% of transferred Foxp3-cells undergo homeostatic proliferation (HP) over 10d, 50-70% of Foxp3+ cells proliferate -a surprisingly high rate of HP. Moreover, treatment with \u03b1-CD45RB markedly enhanced HP by transferred Foxp3+ cells, resulting in a 10X increase in cell number. \u03b1-CD45RB induced de novo Foxp3 expression in 13-25% of transferred Foxp3-cells (many of which subsequently underwent HP). Thus, \u03b1-CD45RB induces both conversion of Foxp3-to Foxp3+ cells and promotes HP in Foxp3+ cells in the absence of exogenous antigen. We then addressed the signals controlling basal HP of Tregs and both HP and conversion mediated by \u03b1-CD45RB. CFSE-stained congenic CD4+ cells adoptively transferred into naive wt mice were untreated, or received CsA, \u03b1-CD45RB, or both and Foxp3+ and Foxp3-CD4 cells were assessed on d10. Calcineurin inhibition greatly reduced basal HP of transferred Foxp3+ cells compared to untreated mice. Moreover, CsA completely abrogated increased Treg HP induced by \u03b1-CD45RB, although conversion still occurred. Next we assessed the role of TGF\u03b2. We found that blocking TGF\u03b2 signaling with \u03b1-TGF\u03b2 shortened allograft survival, but had no effect on basal Treg HP, or on Treg HP or conversion by \u03b1-CD45RB. Finally, although exogenous antigen is not required, basal and \u03b1-CD45RB-induced HP may still require recognition of self-Ag byTregs. Indeed, preliminary results reveal that when CFSE-labeled CD4+ cells are transferred into MHCII KO mice, basal HP by Tregs is reduced and not restored by \u03b1-CD45RB. Thus, \u03b1-CD45RB alters normal controls regulating HP by Treg. Moreover, both basal and \u03b1-CD45RB-mediated HP requires intact calcineurin activity and TCR signaling, but not TGF\u03b2. Understanding the signals controlling HP in Treg may reveal new therapeutic targets for tolerance induction. We report the first demonstration of a tolerance-inducing strategy based on posttransplant administration of allo-Ag-specific Treg (AAsTreg) and rapamycin (Rapa), in a fully allogeneic, unmanipulated mouse heart transplant model. Enrichment of naturally-occurring AAsTreg represented the first step to counterbalance the high frequency of alloreactive T cells. Selection was achieved by co-incubation of freshly-isolated CD4 + CD25 + T cells with donor bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC). The source of stimulatory factors necessary to sustain Treg proliferation was the supernatant of CD4 + CD25 -T cells co-cultured with allogeneic DC (MLRsup). Use of mature (CD86 high ) DC favored extensive expansion of Foxp3cells capable of IL-17 production (T H 17). Co-culture of Treg with immature DC in the presence of MLRsup rendered a T cell population with regulatory phenotype: Foxp3 + , GITR + , CTLA-4 + , CCR7 + , CD62L -. These cells inhibited in vitro effector T cell proliferation at 1:20 and 1:40 Treg:T cell ratios. The suppressive activity was Ag-specific; no significant inhibition was evident when effector T cells were stimulated by third party DC. AAsTreg were then tested for their ability to induce transplant tolerance in a mouse heterotopic heart allograft model (BALB/c to C57BL/10; unmanipulated). Rapa was used: i) to inhibit effector T cell proliferation, while sparing Treg activity and thus enhancing the in vivo Treg:effector T cell ratio; ii) to promote resolution of the inflammatory state and preserve the susceptibility of conventional T cells to Treg suppression. Graft recipients received Rapa (1mg/kg/d; d0-9) and 2x10 6 AAsTreg i.v. on d7. In comparison to the untreated group (median survival time, MST=11d; n=14), Rapa alone extended MST to 30 d (n=7), with no long-term graft survival. Under cover of Rapa, AAsTreg exerted a profound tolerogenic effect: >80% recipients exhibited longterm graft survival (MST>150d; n=6). This effect was stronger than polyclonal Treg administration: 40% long-term survivors (MST>50d; n=5). Moreover, the tolerogenic effect was Ag-specific, as AAsTreg selected against third party DC (C3H/HeJ) did not prolong graft survival in comparison to the Rapa-only control group.",

To that end, our analysis of Foxp3 sequence showed the presence of an RXXR motif, conserved between mice and humans, that is located 12 amino acids (aa) from the carboxy terminus of Foxp3 and is a potential recognition sequence for cleavage by proprotein convertase enzymes. We found several proprotein convertases are expressed by naturally occurring Tregs, with further upregulation upon TCR activation. We generated an antibody against the 12 aa carboxyl peptide of Foxp3, and by Western blotting detected a peptide of about 1.3-kDa, consistent with a 12-aa long carboxy-terminal Foxp3 cleavage product. Both cleaved and uncleaved forms of Foxp3 were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the cleaved form was found only in the DNA-bound fraction. The requirement of proteolytic cleavage, at the intact tetrabasic RXXR motif (414RKKR417), for full Treg function was shown by abolishing the motif through mutagenesis, followed by retroviral expression of mutants, and analysis of proteolytic cleavage by Western blotting. Assays of Treg function by cells expressing either long-or short-Foxp3 mutants showed short-Foxp3 (missing the carboxy-terminal 12-aa) suppressed Teff cell proliferation significantly more effectively than WT Foxp3 or an engineered and cleavage-resistant mutant, termed long-Foxp3 (p<0.01). Moreover, adoptive transfer of cells expressing short-Foxp3 prevented experimental colitis more effectively than WT-Foxp3 (p<0.01), and both were more effective than cells expressing long-Foxp3. Animals that received cells expressing short-Foxp3 gained weight and were protected from disease. Thus, function of Foxp3 is regulated at a post-translational level by proteolytic cleavage and the short form of Foxp3 represents the active form. Our data shows proteolytic cleavage of Foxp3 is key to the generation of functional Tregs, with enzymes(s) of the proprotein convertase family likely playing an important role in this process and providing an extra and hitherto unrecognized important level of regulation for Foxp3.",

A number of infectious agents have been reported to prevent the induction of allograft tolerance, however, none of these can reverse established tolerance, a situation that is highly relevant to clinical transpalntation. We here report that established allograft tolerance (induced with anti-CD154 + donorspecific transfusion) can be reversed in a cardiac transplantation mouse model following infection with Listeria monocytogenes. This reversal of tolerance was dependent on the presence of both CD4+ and CD8+ cells, as well as of the TLR/IL-1/IL-8 adaptor molecule, MyD88. We hypothesized that the reversal of tolerance requires that alloreactive conventional T cells (Tconv) escape dominant regulation by pre-existing Tregs. These alloreactive Tconv can then proliferate resulting in an increased ratio of Tconv:Tregs favoring the reversal of established tolerance. Indeed, we observed that tolerant grafts harbored low numbers of infiltrating CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (1-1.4 x 10 4 /heart), with 10-43% of the infiltrating CD4 + cells co-expressing FoxP3 (N=10). Following the reversal of tolerance and allograft rejection, a 7-10 fold increase in CD4 + FoxP3and CD8 + FoxP3 -Tconv was observed in the graft, but no increase in the FoxP3 + subset. In contrast, we observed no significant changes in the splenic T cell subsets, raising the possibility that the escape from Tregs occurs locally within the graft. Infection of tolerant IL-6-or IFNaR1-deficient recipients with Listeria monocytogenes failed to reverse tolerance, consistent with a hypothesis that the initial escape of Tconv from regulation may depend on IL-6, while their proliferation may be Type I IFN-dependent. In summary, the conditions for the reversal of tolerance is more stringent than the prevention of tolerance, and requires MyD88-signalling and the presence of both CD4 + cells and CD8 + cells, as well as IL-6 and type I IFN signaling. These studies point to the potential impact of bacterial infections on established tolerance, and to novel strategies to monitor and facilitate the maintenance of tolerance in the clinic.",

Further, we have shown a strong correlation between the presence of antibodies (Abs) to K\u03b11 tubulin and development of chronic rejection ie Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS). Goal of our study is to test the hypothesis that epithelial damage due to allo immunity results in remodeling exposes otherwise cryptic self antigens including K\u03b1 1 tubulin and collagen type V (coll V) leading to cellular immune reactivity and Ab production against these auto-antigens which may play a role in the pathogenesis of BOS. 10 patients who developed anti-HLA Ab and 10 patients who had no detectable anti-donor HLA Abs post-LTx by Luminex assay were analyzed for development of Abs to K\u03b11 tubulin and coll V using ELISA method developed in our laboratory. The ELISA for K\u03b11 tubulin used recombinant protein (1\u00b5g/ml) purified on affinity resin. The ELISA for collagen V uses commercially available human Collagen V (1\u00b5g/ml). Elispot assay for IFN\u03b3 and IL-10 were performed for 5 BOS-and 5 BOS+ patient PBLs (at the time of BOS diagnosis), after 3 stimulations with K\u03b11 tubulin protein. The levels of anti-tubulin Abs and anti-coll V Abs were increased significantly in BOS+ LTx recipients with anti-HLA compared to those with no anti-HLA, Table 1 (p<0.05). . Surprisingly, both CD4 and CD8 subsets induced long-term survival of secondary test grafts (>100 days). However, only the CD4 + T-reg prevented TVS (NI=19+5, 21+6% of vessels), as compared to CD8 + T-reg (NI=40+9 in 50+15% of vessels). The cytokine profile indicated a dominant IL-10 response. Allo-antibody analysis showed up-regulation IL-4/IL-12 dependent IgG1 and IgG2c. Conclusion: Allochimeric protein-therapy and CsA treatment generate T-reg that prolong graft survival, but only CD4 + T-reg generated from allochimeric protein-therapy prevent TVS. This CD4 + T-reg may be responsible for long-term graft maintenance through its unique ability to control anti-inflammatory and alloantibody responses.",

Methods: BALB.B (H-2 b ) donor hearts were transplanted heterotopically to C57BL/6 (H-2 b ) recipients. In vivo alloreactive CD8 T cells were monitored with peptide/MHC multimers. \u03b1-LFA-1 mAb was given to recipients to prevent rejection. Various numbers of H60-specific CD8 T cells or CD8 T cells lacking H60 specificity were adoptively transferred into BALB.B graft bearing B6.SCID recipients. Results: 50% of transplantation recipients developed acute rejection and showed markedly increased numbers of H60-specific CD8 T cells at day 8-12 in spleen. Abundant CD8 infiltration was found and selective infiltration of H60-specific CD8 T cells in the graft was confirmed with flow cytometry and in situ tetramer staining. \u03b1-LFA-1 mAb treatment prevented acute rejection (MST>100) and allogeneic T cell expansion. It also profoundly attenuated neointimal hyperplasia ( graft-bearing B6.SCID mice. We found that the degree of acute rejection positively correlated with the number of H60-specific CD8 T cells transferred.

We confirmed a role of immunodominant H60 specific CD8 T cells as pathological effector T cells in acute rejection but not in chronic rejection. Maintaining a H60 response may be beneficial in allotolerance to suppress miHA responses that could induce chronic rejection in long-term grafts. Chronic lung allograft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), affects up to 60% of transplant survivors 5 years post-LTx. Human Neutrophil peptides (HNP 1-3/ \u03b1 defensins), have been identified in the lavage fluids from patients with chronic rejection by proteomics. Goals of our study were to determine the role of anti-HLA Abs and defensins in BOS and to define the interactions between \u03b1-1antitrypsin (AAT), and defensins in regulating inflammation leading to epithelial cell proliferation and BOS pathogenesis. BAL and serum samples (post-LTx and pre BOS) from 21 BOS+, 15 BOS-patients and 12 normals were analyzed by ELISA for \u03b1 defensins (HNP1-3), human \u03b2 defensin2 (HBD2) and AAT. Small Airway Epithelial Cells (SAEC) were treated with HNP1 or 2, with or without equimolar AAT or with anti-HLA Abs and analyzed for levels of HBD2 production (ELISA), cytokine and chemokine (Luminex), and cell surface adhesion molecules (ICAM, VCAM) by FACS. BAL and serum from BOS+ patients had high levels of HNP1-3 and HBD2 compared to BOS-recipients or normal sera (p<0.05) ( Table 1 ). There was also a significant decrease in AAT levels in BOS+ compared to BOS-or normal serum (p=0.01) ( Table 1) . SAEC produced human \u03b2 defensins following anti-HLA Ab stimulation or by HNP treatment (Table 2) . There was increase in adhesion molecules (ICAM, VCAM, 2 folds) cytokines {IL-6, IL-1R \u03b1 (2 folds), IL-1 \u03b2, IL-13(20 folds)}, IL-10(2 folds decrease), chemokines (IL-8, MCP1, 2-4 folds increase) and growth factors (EGF and VEGF, 2.5 folds increase) in response to treatment with HNP1 or HNP2 compared to untreated SAEC, that was inhibited by AAT. Increased defensins and decreased AAT levels were seen in lavage and serum of LTx recipients with BOS. Anti-HLA Abs further stimulate defensin production by SAEC. We conclude that chronic stimulation of epithelial cells both by defensins and Anti-HLA Abs can lead to increased growth factor production contributing to the pathogenesis of BOS.",

We hypothesize that macrophages play a direct role in the development of TA/IF by creating a profibrotic microenvironment and stimulating EMT within the allograft. In human kidney allografts with TA/IF (n=128), macrophage infiltration detected by immunostaining was significantly upregulated (mean score 2.8\u00b10.5) compared to biopsies without corresponding pathological changes from recipients with stable function (n=51; 2.0\u00b10.1; p<0.0001) and the extent of this staining also correlated to the magnitude of graft dysfunction (p<0.0001). RT-PCR in TA/IF grafts also showed marked upregulation for EMT markers \u03b1SMA (3.0\u00b11.1-fold; p<0.05), S100A4 (8.7\u00b12.7-fold; p<0.05), and vimentin (4.2\u00b12.3-fold; p<0.01), compared to stable function allografts. To explore the macrophage-EMT relationship, we co-cultured freshly isolated human monocytes over a primary culture of human proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) using culture inserts allowing media exchange but forbidding contact between the two cell populations. By RT-PCR, co-cultured epithelial cells showed significant downregulation of BMP7 (0.45\u00b10.09-fold; p<0.001), a negative regulator of EMT, and epithelial marker E-cadherin (0.001\u00b10.001-fold; p<0.01), with marked upregulation of EMT genes S100A4 (2.43\u00b10.40-fold; p<0.001) and \u03b1SMA (5.31\u00b12.23-fold; p<0.05) compared to PTECs cultured in media alone. Investigating the mechanism of monocyte driven EMT, we evaluated the effects of Am80, a synthetic retinoid that also inhibits IL-6 and VEGF signaling. Am80 markedly reversed the transcriptional profile with reduction of EMT markers S100A4 (0.34\u00b10.10-fold; p<0.01), \u03b1SMA (0.29\u00b10.06-fold; p<0.05) and vimentin (0.45\u00b10.13-fold; p<0.01), and a simultaneous increase in expression of BMP7 (151.7\u00b153.9-fold; p<0.01), thus reversing the pro-EMT milieu. These results indicate that human monocytes induce transcription of EMT related genes in PTECs, even in the absence of physical contact.",

Thus, in addition to their typical immune functions, macrophages support a milieu within allografts that promotes TA/ IF in humans. Further investigation into this novel pro-TA/IF pathway could ameliorate chronic injury and improve graft survival. Old donor kidneys are more likely to develop long-term graft failure, especially if they are exposed to stresses (e.g. rejection). This limited ability of old tissue to withstand stress may be due to its reduced capacity of replication and regeneration. Telomere shortening determines lifespan and regenerative capacity. We showed that telomere shortening occurs in old human kidneys. Late-generation TERC KO mice with critically short telomeres have a reduced lifespan, show an accelerated aging phenotype and are an ideal model to resemble the situation in old human donors. This study addressed the question whether IRI causes greater damage in kidneys from late-generation TERC KO mice. We studied TERC wildtype (WT), early-(G1) and late-generation (G4) TERC KO mice 1 day (WT:n=7; G1:n=8; G4:n=8), 3 (WT:n=8; G1:n=8; G4:n=5), 7 (WT:n=6; G1:n=8; G4:n=8) and 30 days (WT:n=8; G1:n=9; G4:n=6) after IRI. Acute tubular necrosis was found mainly on days 1 and 3 and was significantly higher in TERC KO G4 kidneys. Tubular atrophy (TA) and intersitial fibrosis (IF), reflecting chronic damage, were first detected at day 7 and increased in all mice with a significantly higher extent of TA/IF in TERC KO G4 kidneys at day 30 ( fig.) . The cell cycle inhibitor p21, a downstream mediator of senescence induced by telomere shortening, was significantly upregulated in all groups after IRI. P21 levels were highest in TERC KO G4 kidneys at day 30 ( fig.) . Proliferative capacity, as measured by Ki-67 immunostainings at day 30, was significantly lower in tubular, glomerular and interstitial cells of kidneys from TERC KO G4 mice. We show that late-generation TERC KO mice with critically short telomeres have a greater susceptibility towards acute injury and develop more chronic renal damage. This is likely due to the reduced capacity of these kidney to proliferate and thereby to regenerate. Our data strongly suggest a pathogenetic role of telomere shortening, an important senescence mechanism, for the development of long-term graft failure. Results: Belatacept treatment had no effect on the number of peripheral blood Treg cells and T cell suppression assays. The percentage of FoxP3 cells was significantly elevated in rejecting kidney allografts in belatacept-treated patients compared to CNItreated patients.",

All patients received corticosteroids and daclizumab. In June 2006, Group 2 was terminated (after all patients were accrued) because of increased acute rejection (AR) rates. Results: Demographic characteristics were similar between groups except for more females in Group 3. Patient and graft survival were also similar among groups (see Table) . Biopsy-confirmed AR (BCAR) was significantly greater in Group 2 compared with Groups 1 and 3, p<0.001, and most occurred in the first 6 months posttransplant with preponderance during the first 3 months. Subtherapeutic SRL trough concentrations were reported in a large number of rejectors in Group 2. Most of the rejections in Group 1 occurred within the first 3 months before TAC was eliminated. All ARs were mild to moderate; grade II ARs were proportionally greater in Group 3. Mean Nankivell GFR was numerically higher in Group 2.",

In subset analysis, we also find an enhanced negative impact of Srl when combined with steroids (Str) in patients without DGF. Conclusion: This data supports previous findings that Srl may be associated with a sustained survival disadvantage apparent early post transplant, and that this effect appears exacerbated when combined with DGF or Str. Several potential explanations for this effect may include Srl-associated prolonged early graft dysfunction, hyperlipidemia or proteinuria. However, patients initiating Srl after discharge may not evidence this survival disadvantage, and this question was not addressed here.These findings may be of particular importance to centers employing combined Srl and Str therapy, as well as to define the best mode of support during recovery from DGF. Prospective randomized studies would be necessary to evaluate these. Table 1 shows CAI in both groups from 1 to 5 years. In SLR group the doses of CIN were significantly lower from one through 5 years (p=0.05). CAI due to interstitial fibrosis/ tubular atrophy was significantly lower in SLR group at 5 years. Our data shows that 5 year patient and graft survival, graft function, BPAR and SCAR were comparable between MMF and SLR groups despite lower prevelance of interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy in SLR group. Registry analyses suggest that TAC/MPA immunosuppression is associated with superior kidney graft survival vs. TAC/SRL. Large single-center experience may assist in clarifying these findings, by examining outcomes related to specific utilization practice. We retrospectively examined the outcomes of 529 consecutive first renal transplants (55% deceased donor, 45% living donor) at a single center, treated with TAC/SRL or TAC/MPA. Graft and patient survival, acute rejection rates, and 1yr eGFR were analyzed by era of transplant (2000-2002 vs. 2003-2006) . Changes in TAC/SRL utilization between eras included elimination of the SRL loading dose and a reduction in TAC target trough concentrations. Summary. Compared to TAC, SRL+CYA was associated with a 55% decreased risk of skin CA that was statistically significant. Although SRL+CYA was associated with a 32% decreased risk of de novo solid CA, it did not reach statistical significance. This reduced risk may not reflect the unique aspects of SRL itself, but may be a reflection of practice pattern, patient selection or center effect.",

However, the incidence and the site of malignancies were quite different by the follow-up times, the era and the region. Methods: We reviewed the records of 694 renal transplant recipients in our institute between 1970 and 2007 and recorded the incidence and types of de novo malignancies. They were divided into two groups by immunosuppressive era; azathioprine (AZA) era (1970.4-1982.3: n=172) and calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) era (1982.4-: n=522) . Results: A total of 57 (27 in AZA era and 30 in CNI era) kidney recipients out of 694 developed 60 malignancies. The tumors included 10 GI-tract cancers, 9 liver cancers, 12 skin cancers, 4 tongue cancers, 6 breast cancers, 6 renal cell carcinomas, 2 thyroid cancers, 5 leukemia, 3 lymphoma, one lung cancer, one uterus cancer and one Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). The average interval between transplantation and development of malignancy was 134\u00b186 (8-340) months. Mortality was high in liver cancer (89%) and leukemia (100%). Cumulative incidence of malignancies of all 694 recipients in 5, 10, 20, 30 years were 2.3%, 4.5%, 10.7% and 14.3%, respectively. Graft-loss censored cumulative incidence, which was calculated to see the incidence among graft survivors under continuing immunosuppression, of all recipients in 5, 10, 20, 30 years were 2.8%,6.3%, 16.3% and 26.2%. That of 5 ,10 and 20 years in CNI era was 3.0%, 6.8% and 13.9%, while that in AZA era was 1.8%, 4.9% and 19.5%, showing early higher incidence in CNI era outstripped by AZA era by 12 years. Site of malignancy in CNI era occurring within 3 years, which was never observed in AZA era, was focused on liver, leukemia (including ATL), KS and PTLD. Discussions:Our results demonstrated that recent potent immunosuppressive regimen shortened the interval between transplantation and viral-related malignancies. However, long-term incidence of whole malignancies has been decreasing by minimizing chronic immunosuppression in our institute. ",

We describe the variability of PP use and its impact on post transplant outcomes. Methods: We identified all cadaveric kidney Tx from 2000-2005 using OPTN/UNOS data. The cohort was stratified by Tx center PP use as follows: Low PP centers (0-10% PP use), med PP centers (10-30% PP use), and high PP centers (>30% PP use). Donor characteristics and the incidence of DGF were compared between and within each strata. Results: PP was used by 97 % of centers, however most centers used PP <10% of the time (70.7%). Compared to low and med PP use centers, kidneys pumped in high PP centers were from donors that were younger, had a lower mean terminal serum creatinine, and had a lower incidence of CVA and hypertension. The overall incidence of DGF was lowest in the high PP centers (13.3%), compared to the med (24.7%) and low PP (24.8%) centers. The rates of DGF within each strata (high, med, and low PP centers) for Tx performed using PP versus cold storage (CS) are outlined in the Table below . Within each strata, the rate of DGF did not differ between Tx performed with and without PP. In ECD transplants, PP was associated with lower rates of DGF across all center groups. However, the impact of PP on SCD and DCD transplants was less significant and varied across centers by PP use. HLA sensitized patients (20-100%) in our DSA are now transplanted at a rate of 40%, which is significantly higher (p = 0.02) than the 23% rate when UA weren't entered into Unet. Furthermore, of 9 kidneys imported into our DSA and allocated to the DSAwide renal candidate list (since UA entry started), 63% (5/9) were transplanted into sensitized candidates (85% to 27%), each of whom had a negative flow or AHG T cell IgG crossmatch. Conclusion. The higher transplantation rate for HLA sensitized patients in our DSA shows that virtual A, B, & C crossmatching yields a DSA-wide ranked list of sensitized candidates likely to have a negative final class I (T cell) crossmatch and be transplanted. The data also lend support to the notion that sharing kidneys across DSA boundaries for HLA sensitized candidates, based on a negative virtual HLA class I crossmatch, has merit.",

We propose a pre-transplant donor path scoring system that reliably predicts graft outcome regardless of recipient \u00ae characteristics. Methods: We retrospective analyzed 286 imported cadaveric renal transplants which were initially rejected by other centers due to donor parameters between 1/00-6/05. All kidneys were re-biopsied at our center prior to implantation. Morphometric analysis performed consisted of measuring glomerular-size arterioles, interlobular, and arcuate/ interlobar arteries and wall to lumen ratio (WLR) was calculated; calculating % glomerulosclerosis (GS); the presence of arteriolar hyalinosis (AH), scar, periglomerular fibrosis (PFG), and acute tubular necrosis in the biopsies. The patients were followed for a mean of 33 months. Multivariate Cox analysis was done to evaluate the predictive value of these path variables to graft outcome.Results: AH, GS>15%, WLR>0.5, PGF, and scar were found to independently predict graft outcome. The UNOS Board of Directors has approved the change from using Panel Reactive Antibodies (PRA) to calculated PRA (CPRA). The CPRA is a formulated PRA based upon the frequency of the specificities of HLA antigens found in the donor pool and is expected to standardize the degree of patient sensitization. Donor organs expressing unacceptable antigens will not be offered to a recipient with donor (HLA) antigen specific antibodies (DSA). Highly sensitive, single antigen bead and solid phase assays (Flow PRA and Luminex) are used to identify these HLA antibodies (Abs). Each transplant center can determine the criteria used for identifying an unacceptable antigen, for example, based upon DSA titer or the fluorescence intensity (FI) coming from the donor-specific single antigen bead. It is unclear whether Abs identified by these techniques are clinically relevant for organ allocation.",

Recipients (55/110, 50%) with non-donor Abstracts specific HLA Abs (high or low titer) and a (-) FCXM also experienced a better two year graft survival of 89% compared to the 74% for the other 50% of recipients with (+) FCXMs (p < 0.001). These data suggest that in the presence of donor-specific or non-donor-specific HLA Abs you can not predict the crossmatch outcome without actually performing the crossmatch which will then influence donor organ allocation and graft survival outcome. In the face of low-titer DSA and a (-) FCXM recipients experienced excellent graft outcome when compared to recipients with (+) FCXMs. Therefore, donor organ allocation based on CPRA (Ab specificity and unacceptable Ags) utilizing highly sensitive single antigen bead and solid phase Luminex assays may disadvantage recipients (no donor crossmatch) who could otherwise be successfully transplanted. Aim: To assess VEGFr2 expression in HCC and the adjacent benign cirrhotic parenchyma and its correlation with tumor differentiation, vascular invasion, and tumor morphologic parameters. Background: HCC is a highly vascular tumor in which angiogenesis is mediated in part by VEGF. VEGF is highly expressed in HCC and mediates its effects through multiple receptors including VEGFr2. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor Sorafenib inactivates the VEGFr2 receptor and exhibits anti-tumor effects in HCC. Clinical significance of VEGFr2 expression with respect to tumor parameters has not been evaluated. Patients and Methods: Immunohistochemical staining for VEGFr2 was performed in HCC and corresponding adjacent cirrhotic liver from 79 patients undergoing liver transplant. 57 patients had HCC within MC. Stains were scored by estimating the % of positive surface area in veins, arteries, and sinusoidal lining cells. Data are presented as Median [P25, P75]; Wilcoxon signed rank and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used. Results: VEGFr2 levels in HCC were significantly correlated to levels in adjacent non-tumorous liver. Higher levels of VEGFr2 in non-tumorous liver were associated with higher levels in HCC from the same patient. VEGFr2 levels were significantly higher in HCC compared to adjacent areas (P<0.05). VEGFr2 levels in HCC were not significantly different between patients who fell within MC and those beyond MC. However, VEGFr2 levels were significantly higher in the adjacent arteries of nontumorous liver (15.8 [0, 60] vs. 0 [0, 35]; P=0.03) in those patients with HCC beyond MC. Subjects with moderate or poor differentiation had significantly higher levels of VEGFr2 in sinusoids and veins of HCC and in the sinusoids of adjacent non-tumorous liver. There was no correlation with vascular invasion. Conclusions: Elevated VEGFr2 in HCC correlates with elevated VEGFr2 in adjacent cirrhosis, suggesting that high expressing HCC arise in a high VEGFr2 expression, pro-angiogenic environment. Moreover, higher VEGFr2 expression in background cirrhosis correlates with advanced HCC (beyond MC), suggesting that anti-angiogenic agents may prevent tumor formation or progression in cirrhotic patients. This novel concept warrants further study. . We further attempted to find a subgroup of patients combining tumor size, number of nodules and various levels of AFP which together would correlate strongly with PDIFF tumors. However, the distribution was erratic and even in extreme outliers (>4 nodules, > 8 cm in maximum size, with or without high AFP), where transplantation is currently not indicated according to any current expanded tumor inclusion criteria, the incidence of PDIFF did not exceed 42%.",

Introduction: So far, Milan criteria are used to select patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for liver transplantation (LT). Herein we compare prognostic markers in patients with pretreatment by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) to a second cohort transplanted without TACE pretreatment. Patients and methods: Between September 1997 and October 2007, 134 patients with HCC underwent LT at our institution. Eighty-two patients were pretreated by repeatedly performed TACE whereas in 52 patients none or other forms of pretreatment had been used (non-TACE group). TACE was performed using lipiodol and mitomycin. Every 6 weeks TACE was repeated until transplantation. Tumor response was assessed by CT scans (6-week intervals). Results: Sixty-seven percent of the patients transplanted after TACE pretreatment exceeded the Milan criteria compared to 37 % in non-TACE patients. The proportion of recurrence-free patients was comparable in the TACE and non-TACE group (77.32 % and 78.45 %, respectively). In the univariate analysis grading, angioinvasion and progress-free TACE were significant predictors for recurrence after LT in patients with TACE pretreatment. Progress-free TACE was the only significant predictor of recurrence in the multivariate analysis. In the non-TACE group T classification, number of nodules, grading, angioinvasion, Milan criteria and underlying disease (HCV versus all other diseases) were significant. After TACE pretreatment freedom from recurrence was 92.3 % in patients with stable disease or regress but only 38.4 % in patients with progress during TACE. Conclusions: TACE pretreatment is capable of selecting a biological entity of tumors which differs significantly from untreated tumors. This statement is deduced from the remarkable differences of predictors for tumor recurrence in patients with and without TACE pretreatment. Moreover, TACE patients can be separated into two groups: those who experienced tumor progress during repeatedly performed TACE and those who did not. Stable disease during the continued TACE before transplantation resulted in remarkably low tumor recurrence.",

The 5-year disease free survival was significantly higher in the M (80%) vs. M+ (61%) groups (p=0.02). When stratifying for UCSF criteria tumors, the 5-year disease free survival was Milan (80%) vs. UCSF (72%) vs. beyond UCSF (54%) groups (p=0.01). Univariate analysis demonstrated the following factors to be associated with disease recurrence: intermediate waiting time 2-4 months (p=0.01), preoperative TACE (p=0.002) or resection (p=0.04), more than 3 tumors (p=0.03), and max tumor size over 5cm (p=0.03). Multivariate analysis controlling for age, gender, and waiting time demonstrated that preoperative resection HR2.78 (95%CI 1.1-7.2), more than 3 tumors HR2.3 (95%CI 1.1-4.7) and max tumor size greater than 5cm HR2.68 (95%CI 1.2-5.9) were independently associated with disease recurrence. Conclusions: The overall survival after liver transplantation is excellent in the M and M+ groups, far exceeding survival rates that can be obtained via any other modality. The current UNOS HCC algorithm should be reconsidered, to allow extra listing points for selected patients with HCC that exceed both the Milan and UCSF criteria.",

Abouljoud. 1 1 Transplant Institute, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI. Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are common post liver transplant, even in patients with no history of diabetes. In the general surgical intensive care unit (SICU) population, the use of intensive control of blood glucose has recently been shown to reduce both morbidity and mortality. Thus far, limited data exist in the liver transplant population. Purpose: Assess the impact of intensive insulin therapy to maintain blood glucose at or below 110 mg/dL immediately post liver transplantation in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). Methods: A retrospective evaluation of liver transplant recipients who received two different insulin protocols in the SICU was performed. Prior to January 2003, patients were assigned to receive sliding scale insulin therapy (SSIT) to maintain blood glucose (BG) less than 180 mg/dL. The intensive insulin therapy (IIT) was implemented in August 2005 with a goal BG level between 80-110mg/dL. The following data was analyzed: BG ranges, need for mechanical ventilation, blood transfusions, infection rate in the SICU, rejection episodes and patient survival. Results: A total of 97 liver transplant patients were evaluated; of which 47 patients were in the SSIT group and the other 50 in the IIT group. Demographic characteristics were comparable between the two groups. In the IIT, 24% of the BG readings were maintained at < 110 mg/dL versus 5% in the SSIT. The incidence of hypoglycemia (BG <60mg/dL) was less than 1% in both groups. The need for mechanical ventilation was 3.0 days vs. 2.3 days and the overall number of blood transfusion was on an average of 5.0 vs. 2 units (P<0.05) in the SSIT vs. IIT group, respectively. IIT also reduced overall SICU infection rate by 15% (P=0.01). The rate of acute cellular rejection at 3 months post transplant was less in the IIT, 14% vs. 25% in the SSIT group (P=0.02).",

The goals of this study were to define a collective profile of liver transplant recipients \u2265 10 years post OLT and to compare their co-morbidities with those of the general population. In 2005, the National Health Survey reported that 22% of the US population had hypertension, 14.4% had diabetes/impaired fasting glucose, and 16.8% had chronic kidney disease. Methods: A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of 125 adult patients who underwent OLT at a single transplant center from September 30, 1991 to October 1, 1997 was performed. Inclusion criteria consisted of survival \u226510 years post OLT with >1 year follow up. Results: Seventy-one patients met inclusion criteria. Ninety percent of patients had \u226510 years follow up. The mean age at transplant was 43 (range 18-67). The mean calculated MELD score was 22 (range 9-62, median=22). Indications for OLT were HCV(32%), alcohol(28%), cryptogenic(18%), autoimmune(10%), HBV(7%), PSC(7%), PBC(7%), and other(10%). Seven patients required retransplant during the first 10 years. An additional 38 patients underwent other operations: 10 arterial or biliary revisions, 13 hernia repairs and 19 non-transplant related (7 abdominal). During analysis, the following medical co-morbidities were found: 51 patients(72%) had hypertension (41 new onset), 20(28%) diabetes (10 new onset), 33(46%) renal insufficiency and 8 renal failure (28 new onset), 10(14%) cardiovascular disease (all new onset). Nine patients (13%) were diagnosed with de novo cancer. Medications for chronic health problems included 18 patients on diabetic medications, 46 on antihypertensives and 18 on lipid lowering agents. Initial immunosuppression consisted of 100% on steroids, 61% on cyclosporine, 40% on tacrolimus, 24% on mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and 23% on azathioprine. Immunosuppression at 10 years consisted of 42% on cyclosporine, 41% on tacrolimus, 18% on steroids, 13% on MMF, 8% on sirolimus, 1% on mycophenolate sodium, 1% on azathioprine. No patients were on triple therapy, 29 were on dual therapy, and 42 were on monotherapy. Summary: Patients alive 10 years post OLT have a significantly higher incidence of hypertension, diabetes, and renal disease than the general population. This study supports conscientious medical follow up to ensure continued meaningful survival.",

            "text": "The presence of obstructive CAD was not associated with increased peri-operative morbidity or mortality. These patients experienced similar patient and graft survival irrespective of the degree of CAD. Significant unmodified CAD should not represent an absolute contraindication to liver transplantation. OLT was also examined. We found that using a TRJ of 3.0 m/s as a cut-off created two age-matched groups with significantly different survival curves at one year (p = 0.006) with a relative risk of mortality of 3.98 for TRJ \u22653.0 m/s. This study underscores the importance of screening TTE for the presence of PPH in the evaluation of patients for OLT, suggesting that clinically significant PPH may be present at lower TRJ than typically prompt right heart catheterization. Some of the limitations of the study are the variability of the time from pre-OLT echo to transplant, and the assumption of RAP = 5 without assessment of IVC size. We are using these data as a framework for further prospective trials to better assess the clinical applications of the findings. Hyperlipidemia has been shown to predict faster chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression over the long term in lung allograft recipients. It is unknown whether disordered lipid metabolism may also aggravate the early loss of renal function often seen in this patient population in the immediate post-operative period. We studied 230 lung allograft recipients transplanted between January 1997 and December 2003. Pertinent demographic and clinical variables were recorded at baseline and one month post-transplant, including creatinine levels and fasting lipid panels. Logistic regression models were created to investigate an independent association between lipid levels and change in renal function by one month post-transplant. Mean +/-SD baseline creatinine was 0.8 +/-0.2 mg/dl and low density lipoprotein (LDL) was 110 +/-35 mg/dl, the latter remaining unchanged at one month. In contrast, by one month post-transplant the mean creatinine level of survivors increased significantly to 1.2 +/-0.6 mg/dl (p < 0.001), with a overall mean increase of 52% above baseline. The highest quartile of patients that fared the worst experienced a rise in creatinine > 72% above baseline. On univariate analysis, there was a strong trend toward those with one month LDL values in the highest quartile (i.e., >140 mg/dl) having an increased odds of experiencing a rise in creatinine by one month > 72% above baseline (OR 1.8, p=0.09). After controlling for age, gender, pre-transplant creatinine, BMI, and the presence of diabetes prior to transplant an LDL value in the highest quartile by one month post-transplant was the only variable independently predictive of a rise in creatinine > 72% above baseline at one month (OR 2.5, p=0.05). In summary, hyperlipidemia occurring early post-lung transplant predicts faster loss of renal function soon after surgery. Though speculative, given the known beneficial effects of lipid lowering agents such as statins on the rate of CKD progression, perhaps timely initiation of these medications after surgery may also attenuate the early decline in renal function often observed in this patient population. The risk for acute cellular rejection (ACR) following lung transplantation (LTx) is still a problem despite heavy multidrug immunosuppression. Induction therapy with potent T-cell depleting agents have facilitated the implementation of minimal post-transplant immunosuppression.The impact of this protocol on the activation of proinflammatory cytokines and effector molecules that affect the cellular rejection process is not well determined. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between upregulation of T-cell and macrophage-dependent inflammatory cytokines detected by molecular methods and the clinical status of LTx patients. We studied 28 LTx patients who received anti-lymphocytic induction therapy(Thymoglobulin n=8 or Campath-1H n=20) followed by maintenance immunosuppression with Tacrolimus and low-dose steroids. We analyzed 137 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) mRNA samples (3-8 per LTx patient) by Real-Time PCR for GZMB, IFN-\u03b3, IL-15, MCP-1, RANTES, TNF-\u03b1, and GAPDH (control). The ABI Prism 7700 SDS and 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR Systems were used and data were analyzed by the dCT and 2-ddCT methods. We determined the relationship of categorical outcomes (rejection-no rejection) with continuous variables (number of cycles) by ANOVA.",

            "text": "Early ACR that occurred within the first 60 days post-LTx was associated with an increase (>3-6 fold) of macrophage-specific mRNA (MCP-1, RANTES, TNF-\u03b1). 7/8 Thymo-treated LTx patients experienced early ACR while only 5/20 Campath-1H-treated patients had early ACR (p<0.005). In contrast, late ACR that occurred greater than 60 days post-LTx was associated with a significant upregulation (4-64 fold) of T-cell dependent mRNA (GZMB and IFN-\u03b3) in addition to increases of RANTES and MCP-1 mRNA. Overall, LTx patients who experienced early or late ACR (n=20) exhibited higher mRNA levels for the above mediators compared to stable patients (n=8). Our data indicated that in early post-T-cell depletion, the ACR phenotype was characterized mainly by macrophage activation. In contrast, greater than 3 months post-LTx with the recovery of CD8+ T-cells, the ACR phenotype was associated with cytotoxic T-cell activation. Furthermore, sensitive molecular methods may detect the activation of pro-inflammatory mediators within the allograft prior to the diagnosis of rejection by transbronchial biopsies and may impact optimal patient management. Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is defined by the presence of donor-specific alloantibodies, markers of complement activation and the clinical phenotype of organ dysfunction. Compared to renal and cardiac allografts, very few AMR cases are documented in lung transplantation (LTX). Methods. We report here on seventeen LTX patients exhibiting: 1) donor-specific HLA antibodies (DSA); 2) linear, continuous subendothelial C4d deposition in lung allograft; 3) lung allograft dysfunction. The presence and specificity of DSA were determined by ELISA and/or Luminex. C4d deposition was assessed by immunohistochemistry in transbronchial biopsy paraffin blocks. Allograft dysfunction was considered when either biopsy-proven acute cellular rejection (ACR, \u2265 ISHLT A2) or bronchiolitis obliterans (BOS) were diagnosed.",

An anamnestic humoral response was encountered in 4 cases (one pregnancyrelated and three re-transplant patients), while de novo DSA were detected in 14 cases (82%). The percent-reactive antibody (PRA) was lower in de novo cases (24%) when compared to memory response (71%, p<0.05). Anti-class I DSA were found in 7 cases, anti-class II in 5 cases, while 5 patients exhibited both class I and class II DSA. Specific vascular C4d deposition was detected in 16 (94%) patients. Lung allograft dysfunction was considered in 14 (82%) cases, while three patients with DSA and specific C4d deposition fulfilled the criteria of sub-clinical AMR. In patients where plasma-exchange/ IVIg were applied, antibody titers dropped from 1:32 to 1:4 or 1:2 in two cases; in a third case, antibody titer remained high post-pheresis (1:512) and the graft failed. Conclusions: Both anti-class I and anti-class II, low PRA or high PRA, pre-formed or de novo DSA can be detrimental for lung allograft. The presence of donor-specific alloantibodies, vascular C4d deposition and allograft dysfunction shows that AMR criteria can also be met in LTX. Rationale: Recently, inhaled cyclosporine has been shown to reduce mortality and BOS. Previously, we demonstrated that apically-dosed cyclosporine poorly transmigrated differentiated human airway epithelial cells in vitro (using a transwell system). Only \u223c5% of the apically deposited cyclosporine passed through the epithelial layer whereas most of the drug accumulated within the epithelium. Thus inhaled cyclosporine may not be capable of inactivating airway allogeneic T cells since it may not reach the airway wall in high concentration. In this study, we hypothesized that inhaled cyclosporine alters airway epithelial signaling cascades that may ultimately result in reduced inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung. Methods: Human tracheobronchial epithelial (hTBE) cells from healthy donors were grown in ALI media to confluence at an air-liquid interface in millicells. Differentiated hTBEs were treated on their apical surface with cyclosporine concentrations of 1000 and 10,000 ng/ml or vehicle for 24hr to mimic the effects of inhaled cycolsporine. The basilar and apical compartments (n=8-12 for each) were then assayed for cytokine secretion (IL8, IL6, IL1, IL-12p40, TNF, eotaxin, MCP-1, GM-CSF, RANTES and EGF) by luminex assays in pg/ml. Results: 10,000ng /ml of cyclosporine markedly blunted the basilar secretion of IL-6 (250 \u00b1142 vs 71\u00b1 24, p= 0.002), RANTES (22\u00b18 vs 9\u00b13, p=0.003), GM-CSF (21\u00b116 vs 3\u00b13, p=0.008) and MCP-1 (181\u00b1112 vs 28\u00b119, p=0.002). IL8 and eotaxin were unaffected; TNF\u03b1, IL1\u03b2 and IL12p40 were undetectable. At 1000ng/ml cyclosporine, cytokine secretion was decreased to a lesser extent. A similar pattern of diminished cytokine secretion was seen in the apical compartment of this system. Last, apical, but not basal, EGF secretion was augmented by cyclosporine (2231\u00b1817 vs 1114\u00b1614 pg/ml, p=0.02). Conclusion: Cyclosporine decreased the secretion of critical cytokines and chemokines from human airway epithelial cells. These mediators are known to enhance mononuclear and T cell recruitment in a large variety of animal models of disease as well as in clinical studies. Inhaled cyclosporine may work by reducing cell recruitment. This hypothesis will require in vivo testing. Funded By: CF Foundation. Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpes virus -6 and -7 (HHV-6 and -7) are \u03b2-herpesviruses that commonly reactivate and have been proposed to trigger acute rejection and chronic allograft injury. The role of these viruses in the development of BOS after lung transplantation remains unclear. We assessed the contribution of \u03b2-herpesvirus infection in the allograft by a prospective molecular assessment of serial broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) samples in lung transplant recipients. Methods: Quantitative real-time PCR of BAL samples were performed for CMV, HHV-6 and HHV-7 in a prospective cohort of lung transplant recipients. A time-dependent Cox regression analysis was used to correlate the risk of BOS and acute rejection in patients with and without \u03b2-herpesviruses infection. Results: 93 patients were included in the study over a period of 3 years. A total of 581 samples from BAL were obtained (median 6 per patient). 61/93 patients (66%) had at least one positive result for one of the \u03b2-herpesviruses: 48 patients (52%) for CMV, 19 patients (20%) for HHV-6, and 19 patients (20%) for HHV-7. Median time to detection was 152 days (range 8-839) for CMV, 309 days (range 28-928) for HHV-6, and 286 days (range 17-928) for HHV-7. Median peak viral load was 3,419 copies/ml (range 102-41,600,000) for CMV, 258 copies/ml (range 106-131,075) for HHV-6, and 665 copies/ml (range 103-66,100) for HHV-7. Acute rejection (\u2265 grade 2) occurred in 46% and BOS (\u2265 stage 2) in 19%. In the time dependent Cox regression model, the relative risk of BOS or acute rejection was not increased in patients with CMV, HHV-6, or HHV-7 reactivation. For example, the hazard ratio of CMV and BOS was 1.04 (95% CI 0.62-1.73, p=0.9) and for CMV and acute rejection was 0.81 (95% CI 0.55-1.20, p=0.3).

However, despite high viral loads in many patients, infection was not significantly associated with the development of acute rejection or BOS. Introduction: The role of chemokine receptors in regulating donor-specific responses to allografts is poorly understood. CD4 + CD25 + T cells regulate alloreactive CD4 T cell responses and acute rejection of single class II MHC-disparate cardiac allografts in C57BL/6 mice. CCR5 is expressed by a small proportion of CD4 + CD25 + T cells but the requirement for these cells in regulating alloreactive T cell responses remains poorly understood. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of CCR5 + T regulatory cells in acute rejection of single class II MHC-disparate cardiac allografts. Methods: Wild-type C57BL/6 (H-2 b ) and B6.CCR5 -/received heterotopically transplanted B6.H-2 bm12 mice heart grafts. The presence of CD4 + Foxp3 + T cells in the recipient spleen and in heart allografts was determined by flow cytometry. Foxp3 mRNA expression in the heart grafts was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Donor-specific CD4 + T cells producing IFN-g or IL-4 in allograft recipient spleens were enumerated by ELISPOT assay. Cell sorted na\u00efve wild-type CD4 + CD25 + T cells and CD4 + CD25 -T cells were adoptively transferred to wild-type and CCR5 -/mice before the cardiac transplant. Results: In wild-type recipients >80% B6.H-2 bm12 cardiac grafts survived more than 100 days whereas CCR5 -/recipients rejected the allografts within 24 days (18 days mean survival) with intense CD4 + T cell infiltration in the graft. Donor-reactive IFN-g and IL-4 producing CD4 + T cell numbers were increased 2-fold in the spleens of CCR5 -/vs. wild-type recipients at day 7 post-transplant and in contrast to wild-type recipients these numbers were sustained for at least 7 more days. Allograft infiltrating CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + cells and intra-graft Foxp3 mRNA expression were clearly present in allografts from wild-type recipients and were virtually absent in allografts from CCR5 -/recipients. Transfer of purified wild-type CD4 + CD25 + T cells to CCR5-deficient mice resulted in the long-term survival of 60% of B6.H-2 bm12 cardiac allografts. Conclusion: CCR5 + regulatory T cells control the magnitude and function of the alloreactive T cell immune response to single class II MHC-disparate cardiac allografts. ",

            "text": "Introduction: It has been suggested that natural killer (NK) cells are critical mediators that connect the innate and adaptive immune response. Cytokine production by NK cells contributes to the polarization of immune responses to T helper 1, and NK cells express co-stimulatory molecules that may affect T cell proliferation. Recent work has shown that NK cells are involved in the chronic rejection of parental cardiac grafts by F1 recipients. We hypothesized that given the role of NK cells in T cell activation and proliferation, NK cells may play a role in the development and function of T regulatory cells (Treg) which control alloreactive responses. Methods: NK, CD4+ T cells and CD4+CD25+ Treg were purified from the spleens of C57BL/6J mice using MACS bead separation followed by fluorescence activated cell sorting. Na\u00efve CD4+CD25-T cells from C57BL/6J mice (H-2b) were placed in culture with TGF-beta in the presence or absence of NK cells, and the development of Treg was monitored by assessing FoxP3 expression by intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry. In addition, the effect of NK cells on the function of Treg was measured by ELISPOT assay. Results: Following 4 days of culture with TGF-\u03b2 and anti-CD3 antibody, CD4+CD25-T cells acquire FoxP3 expression. The addition of activated NK cells to cultures with CD4+CD25-T cells and TGF-\u03b2 prevented the acquisition of FoxP3 expression by CD4 cells. Tregs induced by stimulation of CD4+CD25-T cells with anti-CD3 in the presence of TGF-\u03b2 are capable of suppressing the production of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 by CD4 T cells in response to fully allogeneic BALB/c stimulators. However, in the presence of activated NK cells, induced Tregs fail to function, and production of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 by CD4 T cells is restored. These experiments were repeated with natural CD4+CD25+ Tregs isolated directly from mice without induction, and found that the ability of natural Treg to suppress a CD4 T cell response to alloantigen was impaired in the presence of activated NK cells.",

Furthermore, the presence of activated NK cells interferes with the function of mature Treg in culture and allows a productive cytokine response by CD4 effector cells in response to alloantigen. Results: Both the syngeneic B6 cells and allogeneic DBA/2 cells survived nicely in the Rag-/-IL-2Rg-/-mice. However, the allogeneic DBA/2 cells, but not the syngeneic B6 cells, were readily killed by the NK cells in the Rag-/-mice. However, both Rag-/-and Rag-/-IL-2Rg-/-mice accepted the DBA/2 skin allograft long term without any sign of rejection (>100 days). Thus, NK cells by themselves, though cytolytic to DBA/2 cells, fail to reject the DBA/2 skin allografts. To test the hypothesis that the activation status of NK cells may dictate their alloreactive potential, we treated the Rag-/-mice with IL-5/IL-15Ra complex to maximally stimulate the NK cells in vivo. We found that IL-15 is remarkably potent in stimulating NK cells in vivo; and NK cells stimulated by IL-15 express an activated phenotype and are surprisingly potent in mediating acute skin allograft rejection in the absence of any adaptive immune cells, as IL-15 treated Rag-/-, but not the Rag-/-IL-2Rg-/-mice, readily rejected the DBA/2 skin allografts (MST=18 days).

Recipients were left untreated, depleted of CD4+ or CD8+ cells, treated with anti-CD40L mAb, and/or treated with neutralizing anti-IL-4 or anti-IL-6 mAb. Graft histology was assessed and primed donor-reactive Th responses were quantified by ELISPOT. Intragraft expression of IL-17 and the Th17 transcription factor RORgT were quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Results: WT and T-bet-/-mice rejected their allografts at a similar tempo but with distinct pathologies: allografts in T-bet-/-recipients were heavily infiltrated with granulocytes while graft infiltrating cells in WT recipients were primarily mononuclear. While Th1 and Th17 responses were readily detectable in T-bet-/-recipients, Th1 dominated the response in WT mice and Th17 were not detectable. Depletion of CD4+ cells prolonged graft survival in WT, but not in T-bet-/-recipients suggesting that CD8+ cells mediated rejection independent of CD4+ help in T-bet-/-mice. CD8+ cells were the source of IL-17 in T-bet-/-recipients. Anti-CD40L therapy promoted long-term allograft survival in WT recipients, but not T-bet-/-mice unless CD8+ cells were depleted. Additionally, anti-CD40L therapy inhibited Th1 responses in both WT and T-bet-/-recipients, but not the CD8+ Th17 response in T-bet-/-mice. Eliminating IFNg and IL-4 failed to induce IL-17 production, while neutralizing IL-6 reduced the Th17 response in T-bet-/-mice. Conclusions: While CD4+ Th17 have been described in detail, CD8+ Th17 have received less attention. In T-bet-/-allograft recipients, CD8+ Th17 emerge independent of CD4+ help. CD8+ Th17 are resistant to anti-CD40L therapy and are associated with granulocyte infiltration of the graft. These data implicate T-bet, as opposed to IFNg and IL-4, as a negative regulator of the Th17 response while IL-6 is required for CD8+ Th17 induction.",

Treg were transferred intravenously, or locally to islet allografts, following islet transplantation (BALB/c into C57BL/6). Transferred Treg were labeled with red dye PKH26 and migration to islet grafts, draining LNs (dLN), peripheral LNs and spleen were tracked with fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Islet allograft survival was determined by measurement of blood glucose. Results: Treg expressed P-selectin ligand, CD62L, and a panel of chemokine receptors similar to other T cell subsets. Intravenously transferred wild type Treg migrated to both islet grafts and dLN, and prolonged allograft survival. CD62L -/or CCR7 -/-Treg, which migrated to islets but not dLNs, prolonged allograft survival as potently as wild type Treg. FucT IV-VII -/-Treg, which lack E-selectin and P-selectin ligands, migrated to dLN, but not islets, and did not prolong graft survival. Similarly, CCR2 -/-, CCR4 -/-, and CCR5 -/-Treg migrated to dLN, but not islets, and did not prolong graft survival. When locally transferred to the islet graft, Treg also migrated from the allograft to the dLN, and prolonged graft survival even longer than after intravenous transfer. Locally transferred CCR2 -/-, CCR5 -/-, or CCR7 -/-Treg were not able to migrate from the islet to the dLN, and were impaired in their ability to prolong islet survival. Conclusion: Treg migration to allografts is essential for their suppressive function; migration to lymphoid tissues alone is not sufficient to prolong graft survival. Treg migration from the islet allografts to the dLNs, via afferent lymphatics, is also required for optimal suppressive function and graft survival. The sequential migration from the site of inflammation and then to dLNs is necessary for Treg to execute fully their suppressive program. These results demonstrate a novel and important aspect of migration in Treg suppression and tolerance.",

Candidates were listed for SLK if pathology showed \u2265 40% glomerulosclerosis (GS) or \u226530% interstitial fibrosis (IF). Results:13 patients were eligible for SLK and 27 for LTA.Creatinine was higher in SLK candidates but not clinically different. Background -It is well known that delayed graft function (DGF) is costly for those who received a renal transplant. However, the true cost of DGF is unknown. Methods -We estimated the cost of DGF for adult cadaveric renal recipients in the USRDS 1995-2004 who had Medicare as their primary payer. Those included were restricted to single organ recipients as well as those who had no previous transplants. Cost was defined as the accumulated average cost per day for everyone with a functioning graft on that day. We examined the total cost of DGF, cost associated with dialysis, and non-dialysis cost for all patients combined and separately by donor type; standard criteria donors (SCD), expanded criteria donors (ECD), and non-heart beating donors (DCD) as well as time to graft failure or no graft failure. Background: Based on adverse outcomes during the first year post-transplant, the OPTN Membership and Professional Standards Committee (MPSC) peer-review process flags transplant programs for further review using one of two methods. Programs performing at least 10 transplants during at 2.5 year cohort are flagged based on the comparison of observed to expected event counts (death or graft failure) and the corresponding p-value (<0.05). Programs performing 9 or fewer transplants are flagged if they have any adverse events. This leads to different flagging rates for programs of different sizes. The p-value has low sensitivity to identify poorly performing programs with a \"moderate\" number of transplants (10 to 20) whereas flagging every event results in a high false positive rate for \"small\" centers with <10 transplants. During the July 2007 review, 27% of \"small\" centers and 7% of centers with 10+ transplants were flagged for review (all organs). The Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) has developed alternative approaches for flagging centers with more consistent flagging rates. Methods: The new method would allow for different choices of sensitivity (RR) and specificity (p-value) for different purposes and would flag program if either {p-value < .05 (a different value could be chosen)} or {observed / expected > RR}. The resulting false negative rate is less than 50% for centers with the given RR. This approach avoids an arbitrary definition of small versus large programs, and has sensitivity (or power) > 50% to flag programs with the selected RR, regardless of size.",

In contrast, centers with higher levels of ECD transplants (most ECDs=70% vs least ECDs=40%), African American recipients (most AAs=75% vs least AAs=35%) and patients with low albumin level (lowest albumin =60% vs highest albumin =32%) were more likely to meet low performance criteria. Approximately half the centers that initially met criteria for low performance no longer met criteria when excluding ECD transplants and African American recipients from the performance assessment. Conclusions Given the extreme implications of performance ratings for transplant centers including possible loss of funding to centers with low performance, it is critical that we recognize potential weaknesses and biases of performance ratings. Our results are important towards understanding factors related to performance ratings and raising questions as to whether risk adjustment techniques are adequate for fair transplant center performance evaluations. Rather than only risk adjustment, stratified evaluations may be a partial solution to remove disincentives to performing higher risk transplants. It is also important to recognize factors not associated with low performance such that centers do not unnecessarily limit access to groups based on perceived deleterious impact on ratings.",

Infiltrating lymphocytes were characterized in graft biopsies of patients with DGF (n=40) and in a control group of patients with tubular damage by acute CNI toxicity (n=10) by immunohistochemistry. In addition, we evaluated the Th1/Th2 bias at the renal level in a pig model of I-R injury. T-bet/GATA-3 mRNA ratio was similar in the 2 groups of patients at T0.

This event, due to the I-R process, as suggested by the animal model, may represent a link between DGF and acute graft rejection. As expected a strong negative association between duration of dialysis and patient survival was seen in Caucasian recipients. In contrast the relationship between patient survival and duration of dialysis was U shaped in minorities with the worst patient survivals seen among preemptive transplants and those patients with over 60 months of dialysis. The difference in outcomes between Caucasians and minorities could be related to the biologic differences in the effect of dialysis on subsequent transplantation or to a differential selection bias introduced by duration of dialysis in the two populations.",

            "text": "Anti-Carbohydrate Natural Antibodies. Lorenzo Benatuil, 1 Jonathan G. Godwin, 1 Shamik Gosh, 1 John Iacomini. 1 1 Transplantation Research Center, Boston, MA. Background. We constructed immunoglobulin gene knock-in mice lacking expression of the \u03b1Gal epitope that carry rearranged VH and VL genes encoding antibodies specific for the carbohydrate antigen Gal\u03b11-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc-R (\u03b1Gal). Here, we describe two novel populations of B cells in the spleen of these M86VHVLGT 0 mice and their role in the production of \u03b1Gal specific antibodies. Methods. M86VHVLGT 0 mice were sacrificed and single cell suspensions from spleen, bone marrow, peripheral lymph nodes and peritoneal cavity were prepared and stained with different antibodies and with fluorescently labeled \u03b1Gal-BSA for flow cytometric analysis. Using multiparameter cell sorting, we purified marginal (MZ) and follicular (FO) zone B cells, in addition to two novel splenic B cell populations. Cells were adoptively transferred into B cell deficient \u00b5MT/GT 0 double knock-out mice. Serum samples were collected, and production of \u03b1Gal specific IgM antibodies was assessed by ELISA. To investigate these B cell tolerance mechanisms, we employed mice with naturally occurring antibodies (Abs) against human blood group A carbohydrates in their sera and possessing B cells with receptors for blood group A determinants. B cells with receptors for A carbohydrates in mice belong to the CD5 + B-1 subset, with phenotypic properties similar to those of human B cells. When these cells were temporarily eliminated by injecting synthetic A carbohydrates, subsequent treatment with cyclosporin A or tacrolimus, which blocks B-1 cell differentiation, completely inhibited the reappearance of B cells with receptors for A carbohydrates in mice. It is probable that calcineurin inhibitors used for preventing T cell-mediated rejection simultaneously suppress B-1 cell differentiation. However, despite a very limited dose of calcineurin inhibitors, the B cell tolerance toward blood group A antigens was persistently maintained in the blood group A-to-O liver transplant recipient. B cell tolerance after ABO-incompatible transplantation might be a consequence of presentation of blood group carbohydrate antigens by cells in the engrafted liver. Immune fluorescence staining of the human liver reveals that blood group antigens are predominantly expressed on the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). We have previously proven that LSECs, which constitutively express Fas-L and PDL-1 have the capacity to tolerize alloreactive T cells. Taken together, we hypothesize that blood group antigen-reactive B cells are also tolerized through the interaction with the LSECs. In order to address this possibility, we used \u03b1-1,3galactosyltransferase-deficient mice. When the \u03b1-Gal-expressing LSECs isolated from wild-type mice were adoptively transferred via the portal vein into the splenectomized congeneic \u03b1-Gal-deficient mice, these mice lost the ability to produce anti-\u03b1-Gal Abs (n = 4). This finding suggests that the LSECs expressing blood group carbohydrates play a pivotal role in the tolerization of newly developed B cells specific for the corresponding carbohydrate antigens after ABO-incompatible liver transplantation. Success in kidney transplantation has resulted from control of T-cell-mediated acute rejection. However, little has been done to improve the fate of patients who possess pretransplant donor-specific antibody (DSA), and no proven therapies exist to specifically prevent DSA formation post-transplant. While methods to detect and characterize DSAs are clearly useful, the B-cell subsets that produce DSAs or more importantly sustain their production are poorly characterized. This study set out to investigate the fundamental mechanisms determining the formation of donor-specific memory B cells and plasma cells in novel mouse models of DSA formation. We have developed two complementary and novel systems to track the phenotypic and functional properties of polyclonal donor-specific B-cells. The first system involves allosensitization between normal C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice. We used advanced flow cytometric methods to track donor-specific B cells with H-2k b or H-2k d tetramers. Tetramers are comprised of four identical H-2 molecules bound to a fluorescently labeled steptavidin molecule that is able to bind the donor-specific B-cell antigen receptor (surface immunoglobulin). In our second system, we use donor mice that constitutively express full-length membranebound chicken ovalbumin (mOVA) protein in all tissues. Analogously, Ova specific-B cells can be analyzed flow cytometrically with the use fluorescently-labeled ovalbumin. Both systems allow us to identify donor-specific memory B cells (7AAD -CD4 -CD8 -Ova/ tetramer + IgD -B220 + CD138 -) and plasma cells (7AAD -CD4 -CD8 -Ova/tetramer + IgD -fB220 lo CD138 + ) during skin graft rejection (day 14 post transplant). We were also able to track the development of a stable memory cell population in the bone marrow and spleen for > 90 days cells.For the Ova system quantitative ELISA and ELISOT measurements for serum DSA and DSA-secreting cells, respectively, correlated with the development of donor-specific memory B cells. Using these assays we will be evaluate polyclonal donor-specific B memory subsets under multiple conditions of immunity and tolerance and for the first time, characterize their functional properties and migration patterns. These experiments will provide new information on the basic biology of the memory B-cell response to allografts in mice and facilitate the development of these methods in sensitized patients that may lead to critical therapeutic opportunities for DSA production.

Here, we hypothesized that targeting B-lymphocytes, via the BLyS/BAFF pathway, could promote humoral tolerance to islet allografts. Cohorts of STZ-diabetic C57BL/6 mice were transplanted with isolated islets from BALB/c donors. Treatment with anti-BLyS/BAFF alone (100mcg/mse x2 doses+15mcg/wk/mse) did not protect islet allografts from acute rejection (MST=14d; n=4) . On the other hand, a 14-day course of Rapamycin (1mg/kg) prevented acute allograft rejection (MST=35d; n=9). When Rapamycin was combined with the anti-BLyS regimen, islet allograft survival was markedly prolonged (MST>150d; n=4). Importantly, islet allograft survival was coincident with the absence of detectable serum alloantibodies and blunted donor specific T-cell responses. Following treatment with anti-BLyS, B-lymphocyte compartment reconstitution was detectable at 30 days following treatment and was characterized by stringent selection at the transitional\u2192FO B-cell tolerance checkpoint. Overall, these data indicate that the BLyS/BAFF pathway may be a logical target of immunomotherapy for the achievement of humoral transplantation tolerance.",

Thirteen other animals received therapeutic CsA (target trough >500ng/ml), five of which received additional \u03b1CD20. Graft survival was censored at 90 days. Ab was deemed (+) if present (by flow cytometry) around time of explant. Results: 12 animals died with beating grafts, mainly with ATG-associated lung pathology or infectious etiologies and are excluded from this analysis. 3 animals that had sustained \u03b1CD154 levels <100\u00b5g/ml after protocol day 30 were considered \"subtherapeutic\" for this reagent and also excluded from further consideration. Graft survival with \u03b1CD154 + \u03b1CD20 (median >90d) and proportion of grafts surviving to 90 days (6/6) was significantly increased relative to \u03b1CD154 alone (median 43d, p=0.007; 4/14 >90d). Graft survival with CsA + \u03b1CD20 (median >90d) and proportion of grafts surviving to 90 days (4/4) was increased relative to CsA alone (median 66d, 3/6 >90d). With therapeutic \u03b1CD154 (trough level >100 \u00b5g/ml until graft explant), 12/13 (92%) developed Ab vs. 1/6 with \u03b1CD154 + \u03b1CD20 (17%) (p=0.006). Average CAV score for the \u03b1CD154group was 2.44 \u00b10.44 vs. 0.7 \u00b1 0.8 in the \u03b1CD154 + \u03b1CD20 group (p=0.006 using unpaired t test). Preliminary CAV scoring suggests that added \u03b1CD20 inhibited CAV (scores ranging 0.0-0.1) relative to CsA alone (median 2.1; range 1.5-2.4); Ab analysis is in progress for these groups. Conclusions: Using \u03b1CD20 is associated with significant attenuation of CAV when used with either \"therapeutic\" \u03b1CD154 or CsA. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that \u03b1CD20 reduces the severity of CAV in conjunction with both conventional immunosuppression and costimulation pathway blockade.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of recombinant human soluble TM (rhsTM) on hepatic IRI in the rat. Methods: Wister Hannover rat was used for preparing ischemia/reperfusion model. Hepatic IRI was induced by subjecting 70 % area of the rat liver to 90 minutes of ischemia followed by 6 h of reperfusion. The rats were randomly assigned to a group receiving an intravenous injection of rhsTM (3 mg/kg body weight) and to a group treated with saline 60 minutes prior to the beginning of reperfusion. Sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs) and Kuppfer cells (KCs) were isolated using centrifugal elutriation.

Methods: Liver grafts were assigned to two groups: in the control group, the grafts were flushed and stored in Histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarare (HTK) solution alone for 6 h; in the APC group, in HTK solution containing APC for 6 h. Results: The APC group significantly increased 7-day graft survival from 60% to 100%, decreased levels of transaminase, and improved histological features of hepatic IRI compared to the control group. Myeloperoxidase activity demonstrated that the APC group markedly suppressed the infiltrations of neutrophil. Hepatic expressions of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and IL-6 of the APC group were remarkably decreased. The APC group significantly reduced serum hyaluronic acid levels, indicating attenuated sinusoidal endothelial cell injury. Moreover, the APC group markedly increased hepatic levels of nitric oxide caused by upregulated endothelial nitric oxide synthesis (NOS) together with downregulated inducible NOS, and decreased hepatic levels of endothelin-1. Finally, hepatocellular apoptosis of the APC group was remarkably suppressed by downregulated hepatic caspase-8 and caspase-3 activities.",

Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has emerged as a solution to ease organ shortage in orthotopic liver transplantation. However, LDLT is often complicated by small-for-size liver graft that is highly susceptible to injury and shows decreased liver regeneration. Suppression of liver regeneration in small-for-size grafts correlates with impaired priming as a result of limited NF-\u03baB activation and decreased production of the priming cytokines TNF and IL-6. We have shown that the hepatoprotective protein A20 promotes liver regeneration, partly through blockade of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21. However the impact of A20 expression in livers on IL-6 production and/ or signaling were still unknown.",

This indicates that IL-6 production in hepatocytes is not solely NF-\u03baB dependent (not totally blocked by the NF-\u03baB inhibitor A20). Despite similar or lower IL-6 levels, IL-6 signaling as evaluated by phosphorylation of STAT3 (Western blot; WB) was enhanced in A20 expressing hepatocytes. This was confirmed in experiments showing that A20 increases STAT-3 phosphorylation in response to exogenous human IL-6. Accordingly, hepatocyte proliferation was significantly higher in rAd.A20 transduced hepatocytes as opposed to controls. The pro-proliferative function of A20 mapped to the 7Zn domain. Since the balance of IL-6 signaling in hepatocytes is finely regulated through a negative feed-back loop provided by the IL-6/STAT-3 dependent induction of suppressor of cytokine signal-3 (SOCS3), we investigated whether A20 affects IL-6 signaling by modulating SOCS3 expression. Our results indicate that A20 indeed decreased IL-6 mediated upregulation of SOCS3 (WB). This later result was confirmed in vivo. Improved regeneration and survival in A20 treated livers correlated with a substantial decrease in SOCS3 levels before and 24 hours following extended (78%) liver resection in mice. These results suggest that A20 enhances priming of hepatocytes by IL-6 likely through down-regulation of SOCS3. This added to the effect of A20 on p21 would further enhance its pro-proliferative function in hepatocytes to benefit survival and function of small-for-size liver grafts. Background: We have previously demonstrated that silencing inflammatory, apoptosis and complement genes can prevent ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury occurring in heart transplantation. However, the method for efficiently delivering siRNA into donor organ has not been established. This study was designed to develop a new method to induce gene silencing by coronal artery infusing with siRNA solution for prevention I/R injury in heart transplantation. Methods: Multiple siRNAs that specifically target TNFa, Caspase 8, and C5a receptor (C5aR) genes were generated and selected. siRNA protection of donor organs was evaluated in a rat heart transplantation model. Heart grafts from Lawis rats were infused with siRNA solution via coronal artery and preserved in HKT solution at 4\u00b0 C for 18 hrs, and subsequently transplanted into syngeneic Lawis rats. Cardiac functions were assessed by heart beating rate. Gene expression at mRNA level was determined by qPCR. The I/R injury was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results: After donor heart perfusion with siRNA solution, siRNA was found to enter the myocardial cells, indicated by the fluorescence emitted from the dye labeled siRNA. The levels of TNFa, caspase 8 and C5aR genes were significantly up-regulated in the grafts after ex vivo preservation for 18 hrs. These up-regulated TNFa, caspase 8, and C5aR genes were significantly knocked down by siRNA infusion. Using a siRNA infused organ as a donor, the graft survival was significantly prolonged in heart transplantation.",

Background: Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) insult is a prime factor leading to liver dysfunction. Apoptosis plays key role in the early graft loss following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Bcl-xL has been showed to exert an anti-apoptotic function both in vitro and in vivo. This study was designed to evaluate potential cytoprotective effects and mechanisms for Bcl-xL in liver I/R injury by Ad-Bcl-xL gene transfer. Methods: A mouse model of partial 90 min warm hepatic ischemia followed by 6 h of reperfusion was used. Balb/c wide-type (WT) mice (n=6/gr) were injected with Ad-Bcl-xL or Ad\u03b2-gal reporter gene (2.5x10 9 pfu, i.p. at day -2). Sham control WT mice underwent the same procedure, but without vascular occlusion. Mice were sacrificed after 6 h of reperfusion; liver tissue and blood samples were collected for future analysis. Results: Ad-Bcl-xL treated mice showed significantly lower sGOT levels (IU/L), as compared with Ad-\u03b2-gal or WT controls (509\u00b1361 vs. 2819\u00b1706, and 2212\u00b1841, respectively; p<0.005). These correlated with histologic Suzukis grading of hepatic I/R injury, with WT/Ad-\u03b2-gal controls showing significant edema, sinusoidal congestion/cytoplasmic vacuolization, and severe hepatocellular necrosis. In contrast, WT mice treated with Ad-Bcl-xL revealed minimal sinusoidal congestion without edema/vacuolization or necrosis. Ad-Bcl-xL gene transfer significantly reduced local neutrophil accumulation and apoptosis (3.8\u00b12.9 of TUNEL+ cells in Ad-Bcl-xL vs. 21.5\u00b15.3 and 23.5\u00b16.5 of TUNEL+ cells in WT or Ad-\u03b2-gal treated mice; p<0.01). Unlike in controls, intragraft expression of mRNA coding for TNF-\u03b1, E-selectin/ICAM-1, and IP-10/MCP-1 remained depressed in the Ad-Bcl-xL group. Ad-Bcl-xL gene transfer markedly depressed the activation of NF-\u03baB, Caspase-3, and increased HO-1, A20, and Bcl-2/Bcl-xl expression, as compared with WT/Ad-\u03b2-gal controls. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation contributes to the cytoprtective effects after Bcl-xL gene transfer in hepatic I/R injury. The induction of anti-oxidant HO-1 and anti-apoptotic A20, Bcl-2 by Bcl-xL gene transfer exerts synergistic cytoprotective effect against antigen-independent hepatic inflammatory injury induced by I/R.",

            "text": "Hepatocyte Background: Primary graft non-function (PNF) affects survival and function of renal allografts. PNF, secondary to the ischemic and inflammatory injury in the peri-transplant period, leads to acute tubular necrosis and predisposes to acute rejection. Defining new preconditioning regimens to reduce PNF are desirable. A20 is part of a negative antiinflammatory loop aimed at inhibiting NF-\u03baB in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTEC). Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a pleiotropic growth factor upregulated in acute kidney injury and acute rejection likely to modulate inflammation and promote repair. In the present study we evaluated the effect of HGF on RPTEC and hypothesized that some of its protective functions may relate to the upregulation of A20. Methods and Results: Treatment of RPTEC with HGF (50ng/ml) led to a 2.4\u00b10.8 (n=4; p=0.04) fold increase in A20 mRNA (real time-PCR), which translated into a significant 3.0\u00b11.5 fold increase (n=5; p=0.04) in A20 protein by 6h, as shown by Western blot (WB). Two lines of evidence suggested that upregulation of A20 by HGF was NF-\u03baBindependent. HGF did not degrade I\u03baB\u03b1 in RPTEC (WB) nor upregulated the NF-\u03baB dependent molecule ICAM-1, as shown by flow cytometry analysis (FACS). Further, A20 was still upregulated in RPTEC expressing the NF-\u03baB inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1, both at the mRNA and protein levels. Upregulation of A20 by HGF protected RPTEC from a subsequent inflammatory insult, here mimicked by the addition of TNF. Pretreatment of RPTEC with HGF for 6 hours blunted TNF-induced (10U and 25U/ml) upregulation of ICAM-1, as analyzed by FACS. Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the first demonstration that A20 could be upregulated in RPTEC, in a non-NF-\u03baB dependent manner. Further studies are carried out to elucidate the transcription factors involved in HGF-induced upregulation of A20. From a clinical standpoint, these results highlight the unique ability of HGF to protect RPTEC from inflammation by inducing the anti-inflammatory protein A20, remarkably without triggering other pro-inflammatory signals. We propose that HGF-based therapies could serve in preconditioning regimens to prevent ischemia/reperfusion injury and reduce PNF and acute rejection in renal transplantation.",

In a previous study, we had reported that the early expression of EMT markers was associated with the progression of renal grafts towards interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IF/TA). Here, we report the long-term follow-up of this cohort, paying a special attention to the evolution of graft function. Patients and Methods 83 patients engrafted with a kidney from a cadaveric (n=63) or a living (n=20) donor, and in whom sequential protocol biopsies had been performed at 3 and 12 months, were included. The phenotype of epithelial cells was studied at three months according to the expression of vimentin (an intermediate filament normally expressed by fibroblast-like cells) and to the cellular localization of \u03b2-catenin. Grafts in which these two markers were abnormally expressed by more than 10% of tubular cells were considered as EMT+ grafts. Serum creatinine and creatinine clearance (estimated Abstracts by Gault and Cockcroft index) were collected from 12 to 24 months post-transplant and compared according to the EMT status of the graft. Results Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the early expression of EMT markers was an independent risk factor of the progression of graft fibrosis between 3 and 12 months. More importantly, these early phenotypic changes were associated with a progressive and sustained deterioration of the graft function : EMT+ patients had a statistically higher serum creatinine from twelve months after transplantation, and a significantly lower creatinine clearance from 18 months after transplantation (EMT+ 49.4\u00b14.5 ml/min vs EMT-61.1\u00b12.3 ml/min, p=0.01). The difference was persistent at 24 months. Conclusion The expression of EMT markers by tubular epithelial cells at an early time point post-transplant (three months) is highly suggestive of an ongoing fibrogenic process, and has repercussions on the long-term graft function. Therefore, these epithelial phenotypic changes are relevant and promising biomarkers for an early detection of IF/TA. We recently reported that 73% of transplant glomerulopathy (TG) has evidence of alloantibody-mediated injury in biopsies for cause. We found that 1/3 of TG is C4d+Ab+ and 1/3 is C4d-Ab+ suggesting that C4d staining is not sensitive enough to detect all biopsies with antibody-mediated injury. We aimed to develop a new laboratory test to detect biopsies with antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) which are missed by C4d.",

Hierarchical clustering of 82 biopsies with Ab+ using ENDATs identified a group of C4d-Ab+ biopsies (n=20) clustered with C4d+ Ab+ biopsies (n=18).",

These C4d-Ab+ biopsies with high ENDATs, had higher scores for CATs and GRITs, increased incidence/severity of TG, tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis, and worse future graft function (p<0.05), but similar incidence of TCMR or borderline lesions, in comparison to C4d-Ab+ biopsies with no increase in ENDATs. The C4d-Ab+ cases with endothelial activation show extensive inflammation in the allograft, as measured by the gene sets, which is similar to C4d+ ABMR. There are a significant number of cases with alloantibody and no C4d that show increased expression of endothelial genes. Thus the transcriptomics detects deteriorating C4d-allografts with ongoing alloantibody mediated injury. We conclude that increased expression of endothelial genes provides a new feature of ABMR, and can be used as a new diagnostic test to detect and treat C4d-ABMR.",

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine if ethinicity impacts graft outcomes in kidney transplant patients converted to sirolimus (SRL) and either maintained on calcineurin inhibitors (CI) or mycophenolate (MMF) with steroids. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of all kidney transplants converted to SRL and transplanted from 7/91 to 4/07. Patients were divided into 4 groups: Group 1: AAs converted to SRL + continued on CI; group 2: non-AAs converted to SRL + continued on CI; group 3: AAs converted to SRL + continued on MMF; group 4: non-AAs converted to SRL + continued on MMF. Pediatrics and multiorgan transplants were excluded. Results: A total of 257 patients were included (61% AA). Demographics, baseline immunosuppression, and reason for SRL conversion were similar between groups. Table 1 displays characteristics and outcomes. Patients converted to SRL+CI regimens had higher rates of acute rejection before SRL conversion (p<0.02), but equal rates after conversion. Development of proteinuria was similar across groups. Figure 1 displays the graft survival rates for each group. AA patients converted to SRL+MMF tended to have poorer outcomes compared to AA patients converted to SRL+CI. Non-AA patients converted to SRL+MMF tended to have better graft outcomes compared to non-AA patients coverted to SRL+CI, although this did not reach statistical significance(p=0.186). Conclusion: AAs converted to SRL may benefit from continued CI, while non-AAs converted to SRL appear to have better outcomes with MMF. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings.",

We also evaluated the effect of recipient pairs transplanted at the same center vs different centers. Results: There is a strong correlation in outcomes for 2 recipients with the same donor (table) . The correlation was stronger within pairs transplanted at the same center than for those transplanted at different centers. Differences in the correlation of graft failures within pairs transplanted at the same versus separate centers diminished over 2 and were absent by 3 years post-tx.

All odds ratios significant with p<0.001. The Deterioration of Kidney Allograft Function (DeKAF) study is a NIH-funded multicenter observational study of late allograft (ktx) loss. The study examines two cohorts: a \"long-term cohort\" (LTC) of prevalent ktx with SCr < 2.0 mg/dL with deterioration of function (25% increase in SCr or proteinuria) and a \"prospective cohort\" (PC) of incident ktx developing a persistent >25% increase in SCr. We examined the pathologic features of the first renal biopsy (bx) obtained for new onset deterioration in each cohort. All bx were read and scored centrally using a modified Banff schema. On average, bx were obtained at 6 (PC) and 75 (LTC) months post-tx. Mean SCr was similar, but more patients (pts) in LTC had proteinuria. Moderate to severe interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (TA) were more prevalent in LTC than PC (33 vs 13% ci score \u22652; 33 vs 9% for TA). The rate of vascular sclerosis >25% was similar (10.87% PC vs 15.46% LTC); however, hyaline arteriolar sclerosis >25% was more common in the LTC (30 vs 4.35%). Interstitial inflammation (i) and tubulitis (t) scores were similar in both cohorts. However, more pts in LTC had peritubular capillary infiltrates (>5 cells) and evidence of tx glomerulopathy. While rates of interstitial inflammation and tubulitis sufficient to warrant diagnosis of acute rejection are similar in the prospective and long-term cohorts, long term cohort pts had more proteinuria, interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, hyaline arteriolar sclerosis, and transplant glomerulopathy. Analyses of histologic findings and renal outcome are ongoing. The term chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) has been abolished by the last Banff Meeting Report (Am J Transplant, 2007) and 2 categories have been introduced for chronic changes: chronic active T cell-mediated rejection and chronic active humoral rejection (CAHR). Aim of the study was to review all cases of CAN diagnosed in the last 4 years and to identify immunohistochemical markers of chronic rejection. A cohort of 79 CAD pts with biopsy-proven CAN was analyzed. Each case was reviewed and assigned into 3 groups according to Banff 2005 criteria: chronic rejection (CR), chronic calcineurin toxicity (CNIT) or chronic lesions not otherwise specified (NOS).

Peri-operative mortality is comparable to reports in patients without kidney disease. GB warrants prospective study as a strategy for reducing complications of obesity in ESRD. INTRODUCTION: The present study investigated the incidence of posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) and calculated the risk of developing PTDM under a tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)-based immunosuppression based on clinical characteristics, tacrolimus-pharmacokinetics, and genetic polymorphisms related to tacrolimus-pharmacokinetics, cytokines and diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Seventy-one non-diabetic adult kidney recipients (male 37, female 34) were studied. Patients with continuous high plasma glucose levels, over 6.5mg/dl of hemoglobin A1c, or requiring insulin and/or oral anti-diabetic agents for more than 3 months after transplantation at 1-year after transplantation were diagnosed as having PTDM. Fifteen genomic polymorphisms were assessed. RESULTS: One year after transplantation, 21 recipients (29.6%) developed PTDM. Positive risk factors were age (p=0.028) and body mass index (p=0.048). There were no significant differences in acute rejection rate, total steroid doses, tacrolimuspharmacokinetics or its related to genetic polymorphisms between the two groups. The frequencies of PTDM were significantly higher in patients with adiponectin T45G TT genotype than in those with the G allele (p=0.034), and in patients with glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) Bcl I CC genotype than in those with the G allele (p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of PTDM at 1-yr after transplantation was 29.3% in our cohort. Elder or obese patients were risky for the development of PTDM. The presence of the adiponectin T45G TT or NR3C1 Bcl I CC genotype may also be risk factors for PTDM, suggesting that insulin and glucocorticoid sensitivity-related genes are associated with the development of PTDM. Analysis of these genotypes is a possible method of predicting a patient's risk for developing PTDM and would be a valuable asset in selecting appropriate immunosuppressive regimens for individuals.",

            "text": "Pharmacokinetics Persistent hyperparathyroidism (HPT) with hypercalcemia is common after renal transplantation. Studies have shown that treatment with cinacalcet corrects hypercalcemia and lowers PTH levels in these patients. So far cinacalcet's steadystate pharmacokinetics and their correlation with pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) have only been studied in hemodialysis patients, but not in renal transplant recipients with persistent HPT. To gain further insight into cinacalcet's effects on calcium-phosphate homeostasis, we determined its steady-state pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects in these patients. In a prospective, single center, open label study we examined the effect of a 2-week treatment with 30 mg and subsequent 2-week treatment with 60 mg cinacalcet daily on calcium-phosphate homeostasis over 24 hours and determined the steady-state pharmacokinetics of cinacalcet in stable renal allograft recipients. The urinary calcium excretion was determined in timed urine samples. Median AUC 0-24 was 784.8 ng*h/ml and C max was 68.5 ng/ml for 60 mg cinacalcet which is higher, and oral clearance (CL/F) was 76.9 l/h which is lower in renal transplant recipients compared to previously published data of hemodialysis patients (50 mg cinacalcet AUC 0-24 179, C max 17.2, CL/F 279). We also observed a non-proportional increase of AUC 0-24 after doubling of the cinacalcet dose. The once daily administration of cinacalcet dose-dependently reduced iPTH and serum calcium. Cinacalcet and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations showed an inverse correlation and were fitted to a simple Emax model (E max =80 % reduction vs. baseline, EC 50 =13 ng/ml). The 8-hour fractional urinary excretion of calcium was increased after 60 mg cinacalcet (baseline 0.85\u00b10.17 %, 30 mg 1.53\u00b10.35 %, 60 mg 1.92\u00b10.37 %). Renal function remained stable. Cinacalcet's higher and non-proportional increase of AUC 0-24 in transplant recipients compared to hemodialysis patients evokes the possibility of a pharmacokinetic interaction with concomitant cyclosporine treatment. Cinacalcet effectively corrected the biochemical abnormalities of persistent HPT. The transient calciuria could potentially favor nephrocalcinosis and reduce bone mineral density, suggesting that higher doses of cinacalcet need to be used with caution in renal transplant recipients with severe persistent hyperparathyroidism.",

Proteinuria is a predictor of progression in kidney disease. It is not clear whether measuring albuminuria will have greater clinical utility over measurement by dipstick or total proteinuria in kidney transplant recipients. There has also been a trend away from using 24 hour collections to using spot urine albumin/creatinine (AC) and protein/creatinine (PC) ratios. We compare the prevalence of proteinuria estimated by dipstick, AC and PC in prevalent patients (>6 months post transplant) in the kidney transplant clinic. Significant albuminuria defined as \u226530 mg/g was present in 52% (211/403). Albuminuria was seen in 29% (70/245) with negative and 67% (34/51) with trace dipstick proteinuria. Significant predictors of albuminuria in a mulitvariate logistic analysis were eGFR (OR 0.977 per ml/min/1.73m 2 , 95% CI 0.965-0.989 p=0.001), diastolic BP (OR 1.028 per mmHg, 95% CI 1.008-1.048 p=0.007), and MMF use (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32-0.77 p=0.002). Macroalbuminuria (AC>299 mg/g) was seen in 17.4% (70/403) and significant predictors in a mulivariate logistic analysis were lower eGFR and higher systolic BP.

            "text": "AC may be more sensitive and therefore have more clinical utility than other measures of proteinuria for progression. However prospective follow up of renal function change and CV outcomes is required. Serum creatinine is a crude marker of GFR in renal transplant recipients and changes in GFR are frequently not accompanied by commensurate changes in serum creatinine concentration. Serum cystatin C and estimates of GFR (eGFR) based on cystatin C have been shown to be more accurate than serum creatinine and creatinine-based eGFR in renal transplant recipients. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the Filler, Lebricon and Rule cystatin C-based eGFR equations were better able to detect changes in true GFR than the MDRD and Cockcroft Gault creatinine-based eGFR equations. We performed two measures of 99m Tc-DTPA GFR, serum creatinine and serum cystatin C on each of 183 stable renal transplant recipients at least 6 months apart. We calculated and compared the percent annual change in the measured GFR and the estimated GFR using the various GFR estimation equations. We also determined the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of each prediction equation for the detection of decline in measured GFR. Results are presented below: The cystatin C and creatinine-based eGFR equations all demonstrated poor sensitivity and diagnostic performance to detect a decline in GFR. Novel equations derived and validated in the transplant population are needed to accurately assess kidney function over time. Background: Hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia and renal phosphate wasting are common after kidney transplantation and are related to persistent hyperparathyroidism and hyperphosphatoninism. Animal data suggest that these alterations in mineral metabolism may contribute to nephrocalcinosis and progressive graft dysfunction. Supporting clinical data are limited. Aim: To test the hypothesis that nephrocalcinosis is highly prevalent in the early posttransplant period and is related to a disturbed mineral metabolism. Methods: Biomarkers of mineral metabolism (including albumin-corrected serum calcium [Ca c ], serum phosphorus [P], biointact PTH, calcidiol, calcitriol and alkaline phosphatase) and renal calcium and phosphorus excretion parameters were prospectively assessed in 201 renal transplant recipients (62% male, mean age 55 \u00b1 14 yrs) at the time of their 3-month protocol biopsy. These protocol biopsies were screened for the presence of microcalcifications. Intratubular, interstitial and/or cytoplasmatic microcalcifications were observed in 30.4% of biopsies. Calcifications were more prevalent in recipients of a living related donor as compared to cadaveric donor. High serum Ca c levels, high serum PTH levels, a high urinary Ca\u00d7P product and high fractional excretion of P and low serum P levels were significantly associated with renal microcalcifications (see figure below). Microcalcifications were not related to the fractional excretion of Ca, use of diuretics, immunosuppressive regimen, serum alkaline phosphatase level and history of delayed graft function. The extent of microcalcifications correlated significantly with the severity of mineral metabolism disturbances. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that nephrocalcinosis is highly prevalent in the early posttransplant period and suggest that a disordered mineral metabolism is implicated in its pathogenesis.",

The pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine (CsA) is characterized by wide inter-individual variability. This might be particularly relevant in the early post-transplant period, due to the detrimental effects of the drug on the kidney. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the product of the ABCB1 gene, plays a key role in the distribution of CsA at cellular level. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ABCB1 might potentially influence the response of patients to CsA. In particular, the SNP in position 3435 of the exon 26, despite its silent nature, has been recently associated with altered specificity for its ligand, such as CsA (Kimchi-Sarfaty et al, Science 2007, 315:525) . Whether P-gp pharmacogenetics would help to guide CsA treatment early post-transplant remains ill defined. We sought to evaluate the effects of the SNPs in the exon 26 on the rate of recovery of graft function, as estimated GFR early postoperatively, in 150 kidney transplant patients given CsA as part of their immunosuppressive regimen. The frequency of DGF (as need for post-operative dialysis) among the different ABCB1 genotypes was also estimated. Of the 150 kidney transplant recipients, 35% had the ABCB1 wild type (C/C) genotype in exon 26, 40% were heterozygous (C/T) and 25% were homozygous (T/T) for the polymorphic variant in position 3435. GFR values were significantly lower in patients carrying one of the two mutant alleles than in the wild type ( Figure) . The frequency of DGF was 15%, 28% and 30% in patients with the CC, CT and TT genotypes, respectively. These findings demonstrate that in patients carrying the CT or TT mutant alleles in exon 26 of the ABCB1 gene and given CsA, the recovery of graft function is less prompt, and the risk to develop DGF higher than in wild-type CC genotype. Pre-transplant screening for ABCB1 polymorphism would help to identify patients who may safely receive CsA early post kidney transplantation.",

Number of \"pack-years\" was calculated. Renal function was measure by inverse serum creatinine at 3 rd month and then annually.

We performed 56 renal biopsies in 54 patients after heart (4), lung (20) , liver (22), bone marrow (9), and cornea (1) transplantation since 2000. The time from transplantation to biopsy was 49\u00b153 months in general and was longest after liver (60\u00b161 months) and shortest after bone marrow transplantation (37\u00b143 months). The histologic changes were: tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis of \u226520% in 52% of biopsies (heart biopsies 75%, lung 70%, liver 46%, bone marrow 22%); acute tubular changes in 54% (heart 25%, lung 65%, liver 46%, bone marrow 56%); arteriolar hyalinosis in 41% (heart 75%, lung 65%, liver 23%, bone marrow 22%); arterionephrosclerosis in 41% (heart 50%, lung 50%, liver 36%, bone marrow 22%); glomerular sclerosis of \u226520% in 21% (heart 50%, lung 25%, liver 18%, bone marrow 22%); glomerulonephritis in 13% (heart 25%, liver 18%, bone marrow 22%; that means IgA-nephropathy after heart and liver, immune complex nephritis twice after liver, MPGN after liver, and membranous glomerulonephritis and minimal changes after bone marrow transplantation); thrombotic microangiopathy in 7% (lung 10%, liver 5%, bone marrow 11%); finally one case of polyoma nephritis after lung transplantation.

Conclusion: As expected, most histologic changes were those of CNI toxicity and hypertension. Surprising is the high number of glomerulonephritis under immunosuppression. Thrombotic microangiopathy without the typical clinical signs were interpreted as CNI-related toxicity and seems to occur more often after extrarenal than after renal transplantation.

States have enacted legislation and the federal government has launched initiatives to compensate living organ donors, but the effect of policy on improving living kidney donation rates in the United States is unknown. Objective: To determine whether public policies are associated with changes in living kidney donation rates in the continental U.S. Design, setting, and study subjects: Series of cross-sectional analyses using records of state legislatures in 48 continental states and living kidney donation rates from the United Network for Organ Sharing. Main Outcome Measures: Living kidney donation rate during each year from 1988-2006 and change in donation rates before and after legislation enactment in each state and launch of federal initiatives. Results: From January 1990 through December 2005, 28 states enacted legislation for living donors (24 mandating paid leave, 8 tax deductions, 3 unpaid leave, 2 encouraging paid leave). Few states (n=5) enacted legislation prior to 1999. There was a steady increase in the mean living kidney donation rate in the continental U.S during the study period (mean (standard deviation) annual increase in donations 1.5 (0.04) donations per 1,000,000 population). In analyses accounting for length of time state legislation had been enacted, the types of legislation enacted, and the incidence and prevalence of ESRD in each state, there was a slightly (but not statistically significantly) greater average annual increase in donations after compared to before state legislation enactment (annual increase in donations per 1,000,000 population [95% confidence interval ( Introduction: Accurate and precise renal function assessment is essential in the evaluation of prospective kidney donors. While direct measurement of GFR is the \"gold standard\", it is not widely available. Moreover, creatinine (SCr)-based estimation equations are suboptimal to assess kidney function in this setting. CT scans are increasingly being used to study renovascular anatomy in donors and has replaced angiographic exams in many institutions. 3D imaging reconstruction allows for kidney volumes (KV) measurements which have been shown to highly correlate with measured GFR in this population. Thus, the purpose of this study was to develop a model to estimate measured GFR that not only incorporates SCr and demographic data but also KV as measured by 3D CT scans. Methods: 244 individuals who underwent donor evaluation were identified. An automated segmentation algorithm was used to measure renal parenchymal volume from preoperative abdominal CTs. Patient demographics and SCr values were obtained from the medical records. GFR (normalized for BSA) was measured by I 125 iothalamate renal clearances (iGFR). An analysis of covariance model was created to correlate measured iGFR with KV, patient age, sex, race, weight, height and SCr. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated for each variable. Results: KV (p<0.001), age (p<0.001), SCr (p<0.001) and weight (p<0.001) significantly correlated with iGFR. Sex (0.60), race (0.90) and height (0.76) were not statistically significant. The new fitted regression model is: KV-eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) = 70.77 -(0.444*age) + (0.366*weight) + (0.200*volume) -(37.317*SCr). We then compared the performance of the KV-eGFR model to the re-expressed MDRD equation using calibrated SCr assay. The R 2 was 0.61 vs 0.50, respectively; signed median % difference was +1.8% vs -12.7%, respectively (% difference b/w estimated GFR and iGFR); and accuracy within 30% (% of estimated GFR values that fall within 30% of iGFR) of 96.3% vs 89.8%, respectively. Finally, the KV-eGFR model was closer to iGFR (in absolute values) than the MDRD eq. in 177/244 (70.5%) cases vs 72/244 (29.5%) cases, respectively. Conclusions: Kidney volumes highly correlate with iGFR and the proposed GFR estimation model outperforms the MDRD equation in potential living kidney donors.",

RESULTS: Slow graft function (SGF) was defined as Cr>3.0mg/dl at POD5 and DGF as the need for dialysis within the first week following transplantation. Donor variables examined included age, sex, race, BMI, eGFR, and number of renal arteries. Recipient variables included age, sex, race, BMI, prior tx, pre-tx DM, history of smoking and drug usage. Additional variables evaluated included degree of relationship (LURT), HLA mismatch, antilymphocyte induction, de novo CNI usage, R v. L nephrectomy, WIT, total OR time, and performance of simultaneous deceased donor pancreas tx (SPLK). Univariate analysis was performed with significance defined as p<0.05. Significant variables were then included in the multivariate analysis. Background: A kidney exchange program is the logistic solution for patients with positive cross match (X + ) or ABO incompatible donors. A major problem in all kidney transplantation programs is the sensitized recipient. We analyzed the success rate for immunized recipients in the Dutch kidney exchange program. Methods: From January 2004 till December 2007 242 donor-recipient pairs were registered. There were 117 couples in the X + group while 125 pairs were ABO incompatible. In the X + group the median PRA was 46% (2-100%). To create new combinations a match program was run 16 times (every 3 months) with a median of 46 (16-66) participating couples. Allocation criteria included bloodtype (first identical, then compatible), HLA match probability within the actual exchange donor pool to ensure that highly sensitized recipients have the best chance to receive a kidney, and the waittime on dialysis. Cross matches between new donor and recipient were performed centrally in our Reference laboratory with CDC-tests. Results: After 16 match runs, we found matching couples for 83/117 (71%) X + pairs, for 21/87 (24%) ABO incompatible pairs with O recipients and for 29/38 (76%) ABO incompatible pairs with non-O recipients.

Using an optimization matching algorithm the New England Program for Kidney Exchange (NEPKE) efficiently matches incompatible donor/recipient pairs. In 2006, the Mid-Atlantic Paired Exchange Program (MAPEP) and other individual centers began sharing data with NEPKE. This is a report of the success of two regional programs working together to increase the probability of participants in both programs finding a compatible match. Methods: Incompatible pairs and non-directed donors (NDD) are referred to NEPKE through transplant centers. Donor and recipient ABO, HLA and recipient HLA antibody screening are entered into the computer database. Utilizing the optimization program, searches for compatible matches are conducted every 30 to 45 days. The program identifies potential 2 and 3-way matches, NDD chains, and list exchange chains. Following the determination of compatibility NEPKE notifies transplant centers involved of the potential match and centers accept or decline the offer. Transplant centers notify their pairs and preliminary crossmatches are performed. A conference call is scheduled to coordinate simultaneous donor nephrectomies and recipient transplants. Surgeons speak prior to incision to ensure simultaneous donation. Results: From July 2005 to December 2007, 186 pairs and 10 NDDs have entered NEPKE. During this time frame over one thousand possible matches were identified, with the majority of these matches involving the same pairs in multiple matches. After \"optimizing\" and eliminating multiple matches 13 two-way exchanges; 15 three-way exchanges; 7 three-way list chain exchanges; and 25 NDD chain matches were offered to transplant centers as possible matches. Most common reason offers were declined include: positive crossmatch (21.6%); donor factors (20%), and recipient inactive or transplanted (20%). Four offers occurred in MAPEP alone pairs, 47 in NEPKE, and 14 offers were cross-regional. Three matches are pending for 9 additional transplants. One previous and one pending transplant are the result of cross-regional exchanges. Five transplants performed and 6 pending involve NDD chains. One pending match involves a list exchange chain. Conclusion: Using a computerized optimization algorithm to match 2 and 3 way exchanges, NDD and list exchange chains has lead to a substantial increase in the number of KPD matches and transplants performed. Cross-regional coordination is feasible and expands the number of transplants performed beyond the ability of individual exchange programs. ",

We sought to determine if intensive screening improves detection of polyomaviral reactivation in asymptomatic patients and pre-emptive stepwise modification can improve outcome of polyomaviral nephropathy (PVN). Methods:This is a prospective single center study. We randomly assigned de novo KT (cluster randomization) to Intensive Screening (IS:n=648) and Routine Care (RC: n=260) for the detection of decoy cells. IS was initiated at week-4 of KT and RC at the time of increase in serum creatinine. This was complemented with urine and blood nucleic acid testing. All patients had biopsies performed for detection of polomya nephritis (PVN). Both groups were treated with pre-specified stepwise modification of IT based on cell cytology and viremia (Step 1: decrease dose of cellcept by 50%, Step 2: decrease dose of tacrolimus by 50%, or switch to sirolimus therapy, Step 3: discontinue cellcept). Primary outcome included persistence of decoy cells/viremia following each step in modification of IT every three months and secondary outcomes included acute rejection, graft function and graft loss. Results: Polyomaviral reactivation developed in 11.7% in IS group and 40% had PVN without changes in serum creatinine.

Secondary outcomes: despite similar degrees of Step-Wise IS modification, rate of acute rejection non-significant (p=0.25), but 25% of patients in RC loss the graft vs no graft loss in IS group.

Stepwise modification in IT resulted in early resolution of decoy cells and viremia in both groups, albeit slowly in RC group, and it did not prevent the graft loss in RC group. BACKGROUND: DNA sequencing of the BK viral (BKV) genome Non-Coding Control Region (NCCR) from individual patient isolates demonstrate divergent sequence and alterations in the arrangement of modularly conserved sequence blocks (P-Q-R-S) ranging in size from 39 to 68 base pairs. AIM: Primary aim to molecularly clone and analyze patient-derived BK virus NCCR sequence variants. Our secondary aim is to determine if reporter gene constructs of patient-derived NCCR variants differ in their promoter activity upon transfection into a mammalian cell line (Vero) and a human primary tubular epithelial cell line. METHODS: BKV DNA was amplified and sequenced from blood and urine samples of 18 renal transplant recipients. Via sequence alignment, unique NCCRs were determined. These sequences were PCR amplified and cloned into reporter plasmids containing the Renilla Luciferase gene. Promoter activity was measured via luminometer 24 hours after transfection into Vero cells and human tubular epithelial cells. RESULTS: Variation in naturally occurring BKV NCCR promoter regions exist as single basepair insertions and deletions, and insertions or deletions of partial sequence blocks (P-Q-R-S). Single basepair substitutions were most commonly seen (46% of analyzed samples). Promoter activity within Vero cells ranged from 188% to 39% as compared to NCCR activity of an archetypal strain (WWb). Low promoter activity (<50%) was seen in isolates with duplications of the P block and large deletions of the R block. CONCLUSION: These sequence blocks are rich in regulatory elements and control the expression of both BKV structural and regulatory genes. Variation in these cisacting eukaryotic transcriptional promoter binding sites corresponds to differential promoter activity in naturally occurring BKV isolates. Current plans include repeating the promoter activity studies in human primary tubular epithelial cells.",

Polyomavirus BK-associated nephropathy (BKVN) has emerged as a cause of graft failure after kidney transplantation (KTx). In a cohort of 37 pediatric renal recipients undergoing prospective three-monthly monitoring for BK by blood and urine Q-PCR, we evaluated antibody response, measured by enzyme immunoassay using BK VLP, and cellular immune response, reported as frequency of IFN\u03b3-secreting cells in a ELISPOT assay after 9-day stimulation with BKV large T (LT) and VP1 peptides. We could not observe any influence of recipient pre-transplant BKV-specific IgG or T-cell levels, which were generally low, on BKV infection after allografting. After transplantation, both specific IgG levels, and frequency of BKV-specific T cells increased according to the degree of viral exposure. In detail, BKV-seropositive patients who never reactivate the virus (group1, n=10) did not show significant increase in IgG levels (from a median OD of 0.37 at month +1 to 0.39 at the end of follow-up), while patients with urinary shedding alone (group 2, n=14) or with viremia (group 3, n=13) increased from a median OD of 0.3 to 1.2 (p=0.09), and 0.26 to 2.8 (p>0.0005). In the case of cellular immunity, VP1-specific T-cells increased in the three groups. Conversely, LT-specific T-cells, which were high (median 71 SFU/10 5 cells) and remained unchanged throughout the follow-up period in group 1 patients, had a significant increase in recipients belonging to both group 2 and 3. Interestingly, patients with urinary shedding who do not progress to viremia show a median 3-fold increase in LT-specific T-cell levels at peak viruria, compared to no increase observed in patients who develop viremia. The latter group mount a significant response to LT only after therapeutic reduction of immunosuppression. At peak viruria, viremic patients already show a 8-fold rise in specific IgG compared to the 1.5 increase observed in group 2 recipients. Our data suggest that inability to reach protective levels of BKV LT-directed T cells, rather than specific IgG, predispose KTx recipients to BKV replication.",

Antibody responses to the VP-1 protein have been detected in kidney transplant patients, but it is not known if these have virus neutralizing activity. Methods:Recombinant BK, JC, and SV40 virus like particles were used to produce a panel of 20 monoclonal antibodies. These antibodies were characterized for isotype and for ability to bind the respective antigens in ELISA assays. To test neutralizing activity, BKV Gardner strain (ATCC# VR837) viral particles were incubated with the corresponding antibodies for 2 hours at 37 degrees C, and used to infect WI 38 cells. BKV infection was monitored by quantitative real time PCR using primers directed against the VP-1 gene. Neutralizing activity was defined as greater than 95% inhibition of viral yield. Results:The monoclonal antibodies were of the IgG 2a or IgG 2b class with the exception of one IgG 1 and one IgM antibody. All 12 anti-BKV monoclonal antibodies bound to BKV capsids in-vitro in ELISA assays. This binding affinity was species specific, as only 1 antibody showed weak binding activity to JCV and SV40 capsids. Neutralization of infectious BK virus was shown for 10/12 antibodies. Denaturation of capsid proteins indicated that the monoclonal antibodies recognized primarily conformational epitopes, with only monoclonal antibody appearing to have a linear component. Paucity of linear epitopes was further suggested by lack of reactivity of sera from BKV seropositive subjects in ELISA assays based on genotype-specific short peptide sequences derived from the BKV VP-1 loop region. Four monoclonal antibodies each generated from JCV capsids and SV40 capsids did not show any BKV neutralizing activity. Conclusions: BKV VP-1 protein capsids contain species specific conformational epitopes which can elicit virus neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibody responses. Measurement of these antibodies in renal transplant recipients may have diagnostic and prognostic applications. BKV specific monoclonal antibodies deserve further study as potential therapy of acute infections in the viremic phase.",

It has been reported with 1-year follow-up that reduction of immunosuppression leads to control of BKV. Here, we report our 3-year follow-up experience of BKV patients that were identified by a prospective screening protocol and managed by sequential reduction of immunosuppression. Methods: All kidney or kidney-pancreas transplant recipients at Emory University between 5/03-5/04 were screened prospectively for BKV by real time PCR during follow-up visits (1-6, 9, 12, 24, 36) . Patients with a BK viral load of greater than 10,000 copies/ml blood received a kidney biopsy to screen for BK virus nephropathy by immunohistochemistry. BKV without nephropathy resulted in reduced immunosuppression by a 50% reduction in mycophenolate dose. BKV with nephropathy resulted in discontinuation of mycophenolate. All identified BK patients were monitored every 2-4 weeks until viral load was below 10,000 copies/ml. Immunosuppression was further reduced if viral loads failed to decrease. Results: 135 recipients were followed over a 36-month period. 24 patients had received simultaneous kidney and pancreas, 2 a liver and kidney and the rest kidney alone. 27 of 135 (20%) patients developed BKV within a year from time of transplantation. Average time to diagnosis of BKV was 4.7 months. Average dose of mycophenolate at 3 years was 1.3 g/d in the BKV negative population as compared to 0.56 g/d in the BKV positive population. Average 12 hour trough blood level of tacrolimus at 3 years was 9.1 ng/ml in the BKV negative population as compared to 7.4 ng/ml in the BKV positive population. Survival rates for both patient and organ were comparable at 3 years in BK viremic vs BK negative patients (100% vs 92%) and (88% vs 83%) respectively.",

Background: There are currently no BK virus (BKV) specific therapies available for clinical use. This study evaluates viral large T antigen as a potential target for drug development, since (a) this is a key molecule that participates in several different stages of viral replication, (b) has no homologous human protein, and (c) offers multiple functional domains for chemical binding, particularly the ATP binding site, the DNA binding site, the hexamerization surfaces, and the hinge region. Methods: Virtual screening and protein modeling techniques were applied to BKV large T antigen using a model developed from the known crystal structure of SV40 large T antigen. Two different structural states of large T antigen (monomer and dimer structure) in three different states (with the nucleotide pocket empty, with bound ADP and bound ATP), were evaluated for a total of 6 large T antigen receptor conformations. Results: A computational solvent mapping analysis of small molecular probes allowed identification of multiple functional sites, which represent potential drug binding pockets on the large T antigen molecule. It was possible to classify 1200 molecular conformations centered on the ATP binding site, hexamerization surface and hinge region of the viral protein. We docked 1209 medium sized fragments (<100 Da) to confirm the results obtained by computational solvent mapping, and further characterize chemical properties of the ATP binding site. In another approach, known chemical structures of Hsp90 and Rho-kinase inhibitors were used to search compound databases and obtain a subset of 8294 compounds (mean size of 350 Da) capable of docking large T antigen. Cross-referencing the top solutions obtained by energy ranking, we were able to identify 50 compounds that bind large T antigen in all 6 conformational states. A subset of 5 compounds simultaneously binds the ATP binding site, hexamerization surface and hinge region of BKV large T antigen.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Virtual screening and three dimensional homology modeling technology has allowed us to identify compounds that can bind multiple sites on the large T antigen. These compounds are predicted to preferentially inhibit viral replication without the toxicity expected from simultaneous inhibition of host cell kinases. BK Virus (BKV), a human polyomavirus, causes BKV nephritis, which often leads to graft loss after renal transplantation. Currently, the only efficient therapy against BKV nephritis appears to be a reduction/change of immunosuppressive agents, and this may increase the inherent risk of rejection. Since human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (HRPTEC) represent a main natural target of BKV nephropathy, the analysis of BKV infection of HRPTEC is likely to provide necessary additional insight into BKV biology and contribute to the development of strategies for treatment of BKV nephritis. Here we report the ability of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor pravastatin, which is routinely used to treat hypercholesterolemia, to repress BK virus entry pathways in HRPTEC and, correspondently, prevent BKV infection. The percentage of HRPTEC infected with BKV was assessed by immunofluorescent analysis in the absence and presence of pravastatin. Both, the percentage of BKV infected cells and the intensity of BKV infection, assessed by western blotting using antibodies against large T antigen, were significantly decreased in HRPTEC treated with pravastatin. It is likely, that pravastatin's inhibitory effect is explained by depletion of caveolin-1, a critical element of caveolae. We demonstrate that BKV enters HRPTEC by caveolarmediated endocytosis and disruption of Caveolin 1 mRNA and protein inhibits BKV infection of HRPTEC. We provide evidence that pravastatin dramatically decreased caveolin-1 expression in HRPTEC and interfered with internalization of labeled BKV particles. Our data suggest that pravastatin, acting via depletion of caveolin-1, prevented caveolar-dependent BKV internalization and repressed BKV infection of HRPTEC. Our data represent the first report of inhibitory action of statins upon BKV infection. Results: 74.6% of patients were Caucasian, 12.2% Hispanic, 8.9% African-American and 4.4% Asian. Overall 1-and 3-yr patient survivals were 85% and 77%. Stratified by race, only African-American survivals differed from Caucasian (3-year survivals of 71% vs. 77%; Figure 1 ). Compared to Caucasians, African-American patients were younger (48yrs \u00b111.5 vs. 52yrs \u00b19.9), were more likely to be Status 1 (10.3% vs. 5.1%), to have a serum creatinine \u22651.5mg/dL (37% vs. 31%), to receive an multi-organ transplant (8% vs. 5%), to have fulminant hepatic failure (12% vs. 7%), to have a higher MELD score (22.9 \u00b1 10.4 vs. 20.1 \u00b19.4) , to be in the ICU (16% vs. 11%), and to be ventilated pre-transplant (8% vs. 5%); all p-values <0.001.

Methods: From 1988 to 2006, 1,102 OLTs were performed in 1,032 adults at the University of Colorado of which 70 patients (6.8 %) with PBC received 74 allografts.

Results: Overall survival at 5 years was 85%. The 1, 5 and 10 year recurrence-free survival was 90, 72, and 54%, respectively. Disease recurred in 18 patients (25.7%). Of these 18 patients, none received a second transplant because of recurrent disease. CS was withdrawn in 73% of patients at time of review. Independent predictors of CS discontinuation are age (>median) (p = 0.0029) and LD graft type (p=0.0018). Conversely, Cyclosporine (CSA) (p=0.0012), female gender (p=0.0197), and BMI > 31 (p=0.0306) were negatively associated with CS withdraw. Interestingly, CS withdrawal did not influence PBC recurrence. Conclusions: 1) Long-term outcomes in PBC patients are favorable and disease recurrence can be managed medically without Abstracts re-transplantation. 2) Using an aggressive CS minimization approach, almost 3/4 of the patients were CS-free at the time of last follow-up. 3) Increasing age and LD grafts were associated with successful CS withdraw; while CSA, female gender, and increasing BMI were associated with unsuccessful CS withdraw.",

The study objectives were to evaluate the incidence and long-term outcome of CD. From 1985 to 2006, 141 grafts in 125 consecutive PSC patients and 85 grafts in 79 concurrent alcoholic liver disease (ALD) patients were compared. CD was diagnosed by biliary imaging and/or histology. Median follow-up was 57 months. The groups were similar including MELD score and cold ischemic time; however, roux-en-Y biliary anastomosis was more common in the PSC group (95% vs. 13%, p<0.01). The PSC group had more CMV hepatitis (22% vs. 6%, p<0.01) and acute rejection (60% vs. 30%, p<0.01), and fewer biliary anastomotic strictures (7% vs. 16%, p<0.01). CD occurred in 38 PSC grafts and 7 ALD grafts (p<0.01). The incidence of CD was greater in the PSC group (p=0.02, Fig. 1 ). No significant risk factors for CD were identified. In the PSC group the graft survival was lower in the CD group (p=0.04, Fig. 2) ; however, patient survival at 10 and 15 years was not effected by CD: 73% and 67% vs 75% and 60% because the re-LT rate was greater in this group (26% vs. 6%, p<0.01). At 15 years, patient survival in the PSC group was better than for ALD (64% vs 22%, p<0.01). Long-term outcome post LT for PSC is good and better than for ALD; however, CD continues to develop beyond the first 5 years with a prevalence of 43% at 15 years. Graft loss in patients with CD is high, but with re-Tx, patient survival is similar to non-CD patients. Further studies to distinguish chronic rejection vs. recurrent PSC may provide insight into the prevention of CD following LT for PSC. Discussion: Our analysis showed that patients with AIH have a worse long term survival compared to PBC and PSC after DDLT. This may be explained by possibly more advanced disease at the time of presentation or more septic complications due to pretransplant salvage therapy with immunosuppressants. Also,PBC had the worst relative outcome after LDLT in this group-possibly explained by the older age of the recipients. Overall, LDLT offered better outcomes than DDLT in terms of survival in patients with AIH,PBC and PSC.

Background: Symptomatic CMV continues to be a significant problem. The costs associated with its development remain high without an optimal method for prevention. The aim of this study was to measure the pharmacoeconomic impact of implementing an abbreviated pre-emptive monitoring strategy versus valganciclovir (VGC) prophylaxis in a large teaching hospital. Methods: Costs for this analysis were based on a societal perspective, including drug, personnel, hospital, outpatient infusion and monitoring costs related to resources needed to perform pre-emptive monitoring and treatment of CMV related events. Time per hr costs were nurse/data coordinator $45, physician $200, and PharmD $52. CMV PCR cost was $203. VGC cost per mg was calculated for prophylaxis, treatment and 30 days of consolidation as needed based on an AWP ($0.09 per mg). Estimated cost of CMV syndrome was based on cost of PICC line placement, drug, personnel and supply costs based on 21 days of therapy and was estimated to be $11,885.50. Inpatient admission cost per day were $3727. Results: A total of 119 patients were included in this analysis. Baseline and transplant demographics were well matched. Table 1 displays the total direct and indirect costs accumulated for each group. CMV syndrome occurred in three patients for each group. There was no CMV disease in either group. 27% of patients in the pre-emptive group had DNAemia, but only 4 patients required oral anti-viral therapy. Provider time and lab monitoring costs were significantly higher in the preemptive group, while direct medication cost was significantly higher in the prophylactic group. Conclusions: Frequency of disease severity and outcomes were equal in each group. Although the overall costs between strategies is equivocal, allocation of resources to provide pre-emptive monitoring places the burden of disease prevention on the health care system versus the patient necessitating further abbreviation of these strategies.

            "text": "A paired donation matching algorithm was developed to allow for LNDs to start potentially Never-Ending Altruistic Donor (NEAD) chains in addition to closed loops of 2-, 3-and 4-way exchanges. RESULTS: In July 2007, a LND from Michigan traveled 1500 miles to donate a kidney to a woman whom he had never met in Arizona. The following week, the Arizona recipient's husband donated one of his kidneys to a 32-year-old woman in Ohio. The following month, the mother of this recipient traveled to a city 3 hours away to donate her kidney to a patient whose incompatible donor simultaneosly gave a kidney to the fourth patient in the chain. The incompatible donor for this fourth recipient is now slated to give her kidney to a patient in Maryland. Over the past 9 months, 60 transplant programs have partnered to perform 10 paired donation transplants. Demonstrating the advantage of NEAD chains over classic paired donation, 8 of 10 transplants resulted from altruistic donor chains. CONCLUSION: In order to fully realize the potential of the above approach, one must be willing to supplant two prevalent ideas: 1) that kidneys from altruistic donors should be given to the top candidate on the deceased donor waiting list, and 2) that paired exchanges must be done simultaneously. While there are certain pitfalls to using chains of donors as opposed to traditional \"swaps\" (i.e. the possibility that a donor could renege, or the accumulation of type AB donors who are not likely to be able to begin another chain), this proposed paradigm shift could result in a very significant increase in both the number and quality of paired donation kidney transplants. Purpose: Medical literature and national best practices correlate families' understanding of brain death with organ donation rates. Analysis of hospital data demonstrated variability in family communication. Although surgical residents frequently interact with family members of potential donors and play a critical role in the donation process, they receive no formal CST. We sought to determine if pre-training residents improved performances in CST involving explanation and notification of brain death to family members and aided efforts to achieve the national donation rate goal of 75%. Methods: In collaboration with a regional organ procurement organization (OPO), an educational model for end of life CST was developed. 17 surgical residents were divided into 2 groups. The first group (n=9) attended a 3-hour didactic session at the OPO that included role-playing exercises explaining brain death to families. OPO staff, trained to serve as family role-players and skills station coaches, debriefed residents after each simulation. The second group (n=8) received no specialized training. Six weeks later both resident groups participated in formal videotaped family communication simulations. Independent observers (hospital faculty and senior OPO staff), blinded to training, evaluated residents' communication skills using a 12-parameter assessment tool. All residents reviewed their videotaped performances and evaluations, then repeated the simulations after six months. Results: During the study period, the pre-trained resident group assessment scores increased by 25% (p=0.0001), while the untrained group increased by 39% (p<.0001). While evidence of improvement existed in both groups, pre-trained residents consistently scored higher when compared to untrained (80% vs. 71%, p=0.037). During this same time period, donation rates in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) increased by 21%.",

This includes patients who have undergone kidney, pancreas, and liver transplants which our center transplants over 300 of these organs/year. In 2002, the organ transplant program was divided into a surgical transplant service (STS) and medical transplant hospitalist service (MTHS). The MTHS consists of four full time physicians, one part time physician, and one nurse practictioner with daily rounds from a transplant surgeon on a weekly rotating schedule. Methods: We analyzed our data from the past five years since the inception of the MTHS at a large university medical center. The length of stay (LOS) for the MTHS and STS were compared to data from the previous combined program as well as data from the University Health Consortium (UHC). In addition, we looked at the cost of care to determine if there were any savings related to reduced LOS and adjusted for the combined salary of the MTHS. Results: In the review period, the total admissions for both the MTHS and STS averaged 1450 admissions/year. Over the past five years the MTHS showed a major decrease in the LOS index, defined as the ratio between the observed LOS and the expected LOS based on UHC data. This index dropped from 1.27 to 0.91 for patients on the MTHS. There was also a parallel drop in the STS LOS index from 1.53 to 1.05. This was associated with a significant cost savings for the hospital. On average, the program has realized an average savings of approximately $1,000,000 per year. When accounting for the combined salary for the MTHS group which is 625,000 dollars/year, the total savings over the 5 year period this amounts to $1.9 million. Conclusion: The creation of a MTHS working within an organ transplant program at a large university center has been able to demonstrate a major decrease in LOS for transplant patients which has resulted in decreased costs and improved efficiency. This has also allowed more focused care for a complex medical population. We believe that our program can serve as a model for similar programs at other busy transplant sites.",

We compared demographics to all Tx recipients at our center during the same period and compared post-Tx outcomes to a cohort of patients transplanted at our center matched for age, race, Tx year, dialysis time, prior Tx, and donor type. Median follow-up time was 487 days (range 31-3056). Results: Demographics are outlined in Table. Patients transplanted abroad were more likely to be Asian and had shorter dialysis times. Most patients were transplanted in China (44%) followed by Iran (16%), the Philippines (13%), and India (9%). Living unrelated Tx were most common.

In both community and church groups media exposure and donation knowledge increased after the media campaign (p<0.001 and p=0.004 respectively). Similarly, donor designation rates for the entire population on the drivers licenses increased (33.0% versus 40.1%, p=0.119). Among all African Americans the propensity to donate was, however, unchanged following the campaign. Propensity to donate increased (p=0.034) in the community sample whereas there was a reduced propensity to donation (p=0.092) in the church sample. During the study time period the OPO also experienced significant increases in donation authorization rates among African-Americans, increasing from 37% to 75%. Summary: A media based campaign combined with grassroots outreach is an effective tool to increase knowledge and awareness. Partnership between the OPO and community and faith based leadership was a significant positive byproduct of the project and should be included in future outreach efforts. Background: It has been hypothesized that the clinical benefits of Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (ATG) induction therapy do not completely result from immunodepletion, but may also result from induction of immunoregulatory T-cells (Treg). In this prospective, controlled study we investigated the effect of ATG-induction therapy on the frequency and phenotype of peripheral CD4 + FoxP3 + CD127 -/low T-cells in kidney transplant patients. Methods: After transplantation, 16 patients received ATG-induction therapy (Thymoglobulin \u00ae ) and triple therapy consisting of tacrolimus, MMF and steroids. The control group (n=18) received triple therapy only. By flow cytometry, T-cells were analyzed for markers associated with immune regulation: CD25, FoxP3 and CD127.",

Results: Pre-transplant levels of CD4 + FoxP3 + CD127 -/low T-cells in all patients were 3-17% (median 6%) of CD4 + T-cells. One wk post ATG induction therapy, no measurable numbers of Treg were present. At 12 wks post ATG-induction therapy, a higher proportion of the first detectable T-cells expressed FoxP3 compared to the control-group (ATG vs. control-group; 7 vs. 4%, median, respectively, p=0.03) and then returned to pre-transplant levels at 26 wks. This increased proportion of CD4 + FoxP3 + CD127 -/ low T-cells resulted in a significantly higher FoxP3 + /FoxP3 neg ratio than in the controlgroup at 12 wks; 0.074 vs. 0.046, median, p=0.02) . At 26 wks, we found a decline in the proportion of naive FoxP3 + Treg (CD45RO neg CCR7 + pre-transplant vs. post-transplant; 21 vs. 9%, median, p=0.02) which was associated with a rise in the proportion of memory FoxP3 + Treg (CD45RO + pre-transplant vs. 26 wks post-transplant; 65 vs. 82%, p=0.02). Moreover, the proportion of memory T-cells exceeded that in the control-group at 26 wks (ATG vs. control-group; 82% vs. 67%, median, p=0.05) which was mainly due to an increase in the proportion of effector memory FoxP3 + Treg (CD45RO + CCR7 neg ). Conclusion: After ATG-induced immune cell depletion, a shift towards CD4 + FoxP3 + CD127 -/low peripheral regulatory T-cells with the memory phenotype was measured in kidney transplant patients. This finding suggests that ATG treatment triggers the generation of de novo peripheral regulatory T-cells by homeostatic proliferation.",

In various models of acute and chronic renal injury, and with normal aging, renal klotho expression has been found to decrease. Increased donor age is associated with poorer long term allograft function. We hypothesized that klotho mRNA expression in renal implant biopsies would correlate with donor kidney quality, as determined by donor chronologic age and peri-transplant renal injury. Our recent unsupervised microarray analysis of 87 renal implant biopsies revealed a continuum of organ quality across all samples ranging from the best living donor (LD) kidneys at one end to the worst performing deceased donor (DD) kidneys at the other (Am J Transpl 2007, Nov 16,epub). Three predominant groups were identified of LD, DD1 kidneys with low risk (9.5%) of delayed graft function (DGF) and DD2 kidneys with high risk (35%) of DGF (p < 0.05). Analysis of klotho gene expression among these groups also revealed a spectrum of expression from highest levels in LD to lowest in DD2 kidneys, especially those who developed DGF. Differences were highly significant among LD vs DD kidneys (p < 0.001), although donor age was not different between these groups.",

            "text": "Anti Renal allograft rejection episodes produce a stereotypical response in the allograft characterized by infiltration by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), potent Ifng response by donor and recipient cells, and decreased transcripts associated with the epithelium. We previously identified pathogenesis based transcript sets (PBTs) that reflect the disturbance in rejecting allografts (QCATs -CTL, GRITs -Ifng response, KTs -decreased function, AJT 7:2712 , 2007 . We hypothesized that anti-rejection treatment would reverse the transcriptome changes of rejection more than histopathologic lesions. Using microarray analysis we measured expression of these PBTs in 18 antibody mediated rejection (ABMR)(11 untreated, 7 treated) and 31 T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR) (25 untreated, 6 treated) biopsies, normalized to nephrectomy samples. Histopathology scoring of the primary rejection lesions were analyzed; interstitial inflammation(i), tubulitis(t), intimal arteritis(v), and glomerulitis(g) (Fig 1A) . Of these, only i and t differentiated between ABMR and treated ABMR (p<0.05) yet none differentiated between TCMR and treated TCMR. PBTs on the other hand differentiated treated from untreated for both ABMR (p<0.04) and TCMR (p<0.005) with all 3 PBTs (Fig 1B/C) . The changes in transcript expression in treated cases were dramatic. Particularly impressive was the consistent correction of the disturbances in PBT expression despite the heterogeneous treatment following ABMR episodes. Unlike ABMR treatment, TCMR treatment always included steroids which may contribute to the more pronounced changes compared to ABMR. The time of treatment before the biopsy, which also varied within the groups, did not affect the changes in PBT expression since values in treated cases approached those of nephrectomy samples. Thus, histologic rejection lesions persist following anti-rejection treatment whereas transcript disturbances of rejection are greatly reduced compared to untreated cases. This study suggests that assessment of anti-rejection treatment is more sensitively monitored by transcript expression than histopathology.",

            "text": "Blood Deciphering the mechanisms of tolerance and chronic immune-mediated rejection remains a major goal in transplantation. Data in rodents suggests that Toll-Like-Receptors (TLR), regulators of innate immune responses, play a role in determining graft outcome. However, few studies have focused on TLR in human kidney transplant recipients. We addressed this issue by analyzing the peripheral blood (n = 75) and graft biopsies (n = 26) of renal transplant patients and healthy volunteers. We analyzed, for the first time, the expression of TLR4 in PBMC from kidney recipients with contrasted situations: operational tolerance and chronic immune-mediated rejection (Banff 2005), compared to patients with normal histology and stable graft function, non transplant patients with renal failure and healthy volunteers. We found that MyD88 and TLR4 were significantly contrasted in the PBMC, and in particular in monocytes, of patients with chronic immune-mediated rejection vs. operational tolerance. Chronic rejection patients had significantly increased TLR4 and MyD88 compared to operationally tolerant patients, who resembled healthy volunteers and non transplant patients with renal failure. Interestingly, analysis of TLR4 transcripts in graft biopsies from patients with normal histology or chronic immune-mediated rejection reflected the blood findings, with a significant increase of TLR4 in chronic immune-mediated rejection. Thus, we provide data to support a link between TLR4 expression and long-term graft outcome. The role of TLR and their endogenous ligands in mediating allograft rejection or acceptance therefore warrants further investigation and could give rise to new strategies of therapeutic intervention. Our results suggest that peripheral blood TLR4 shows potential as a biomarker of chronic immune-mediated rejection and that measuring blood TLR4 levels may help to identify patients experiencing chronic rejection who require a biopsy. Moreover, our data suggest that absence of TLR signaling may be a feature of operational tolerance to kidney grafts.",

It will also provide new insight into the mechanism underlying the balance between tolerance and rejection. Here we present data from a multi-centre study aimed at identifying tolerance to renal allografts. We have collected samples from five selected groups of renal transplant recipients: drug-free tolerant patients that were functionally stable despite remaining immunosuppression-free for more than one year; functionally stable patients on minimal immunosuppression (<10 mg/ day prednisone); stable patients maintained with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI); stable patients maintained on CNI-free immunosuppression regimen; and patients showing signs of chronic rejection. A group of age and sex matched healthy volunteers was also included as control. Several biomarkers and bioassays, were combined to provide an immunological 'fingerprint' of the tolerant state. Immunophenotype showed a selective expansion of peripheral blood B and NK lymphocytes in drug-free tolerant patients. This group of patients was also characterized by the absence of anti-donor specific antibodies. The differential expression of several immune relevant genes and a high ratio of foxp3/ \u03b1-1,2-mannosidase expression in these patients was observed. TCR landscape analysis highlighted differences between the V\u03b2 repertoires of drug-free tolerant recipients and chronic rejection patients.",

Co-transplant with HpSC effectively protects islet allografts from rejection. This was associated with reduction of graft infiltrating T cells and enhancement of apoptotic activity. Co-transplant with HpSC from B7-H1 -/livers markedly lost their islet graft protective capacity, associated with less apoptosis of infiltrating cells.

CD8 T cells dropped \u223c7 folds on POD 140. CD4 + / CD8 + ratio was increased from 0.5 at the early POD to 2.0 in the long-term survival grafts. Adoptive transfer of CFSE-labeled DES transgenic T cells was used to track the response and fate of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells. The results showed active division of DES + cells within the allograft in both the islet only and HpSC co-transplantation groups. However, accumulation of these DES + cells was significantly lesser in the HpSC co-transplantation group as compared to that in the islet only group (1.9\u00d710 3 vs. 10\u00d710 3 cells per graft). These findings suggest that HpSC induce antigen-specific CD8 + T cell death, and may not inhibit their activation. Donor-specific memory T cells are potent mediators of allograft rejection due to their ability to proliferate and give rise to cytotoxic and inflammatory cytokine-secreting effectors within hours of stimulation. Furthermore, memory T cells have been shown to be relatively resistant to the effects of many tolerance-induction protocols, including blockade of the CD28 and CD154 pathways. While seminal studies have shown that donor-reactive memory cells, generated through pre-sensitization with donor tissue or infection with pathogens with cross-reactive epitopes, contribute to costimulation blockade-resistant rejection of fully MHC disparate allografts, the role of memory T cells specific for minor antigens in costimulation blockade-resistant rejection has not been well studied. We addressed the ability of memory T cells specific for a single donorderived class I epitope to mediate this process. TCR transgenic T cells (OT-I) specific for SIINFEKL/Kb were adoptively transferred into naive B6 recipients, which were then infected with ovalbumin-(SIINFEKL) expressing Listeria monocytogenes (LM-OVA). At memory, mice received a skin graft expressing ovalbumin (mOVA), and therefore the SIINFEKL epitope. Results showed that the transferred OT-I T cells proliferated in response to LM-OVA, but not in response to a control infection with wild-type Listeria (LM).

In the absence of Ikaros DNA binding activity, CD4 T cells induced to undergo Th2 differentiation in vitro or in vivo produce high levels of IL-4, but fail to silence expression of IFN-gamma and IL-17, cytokines that contribute to inflammatory disease processes such as autoimmunity and organ transplant rejection.

Using both in vitro and in vivo murine systems, we found that aged pDCs produced lower levels of IFN\u03b1 in response to TLR9 activation with CpG sequences or herpes simplex (HSV)-2 virus (ELISA). Aged mice (18-20 mths) failed to the clear this virus as effectively as young (2-4 mths) mice. This was associated with increased liver inflammation, the release of systemic Th17-skewing cytokines, IL-6 and IL-21, and augmented splenic IL-17 levels in aged mice (ELISA). Prior to transplantation, unmanipulated aged mice (B6 or CBA background) produced more donor-specific IL-17 effector-memory T cells as compared to unmanipulated young mice (ELISPOT). Furthermore, MLR assays demonstrated that aged memory CD4+ T cells from unmanipulated mice produced significantly more IL-17 in response to donor antigen compared to young T cells (ELISA). To determine if aged recipients manifest an altered response to therapies that prolong allograft survival, aged and young B6 mice received BALB/c skin allografts and perioperative anti-CD45 and anti-CD154. We found that aged mice rejected their allografts significantly faster (median survival 20 days) than young mice (MST, 76 days, p <0.01).

Pre-treating aged mice with an anti-IL-17 mAB improved the efficacy of the graft-prolonging therapy compared to aged mice that received control mAB (p = 0.04).

As a result of in vitro transmigration across the LSECs from BALB/c mice treated with a portal injection (PI) of B6 MHC class IIdeficient (C2D) splenocytes, the naive BALB/c CD4 + T cells lost their responsiveness to the stimulus of BALB/c splenic antigen presenting cells (APCs) that endocytosed the donor-type alloantigens. However, they maintained a normal response to the stimulus of BALB/c APCs that endocytosed third-party C3H alloantigens. In the present study, we examined whether invariant NKT (iNKT) cells influence the ability of LSECs to endocytose irradiated allogeneic cells. BALB/c wild-type (WT) mice or BALB/c CD1d-deficient (CD1d -/-) mice that lacked iNKT cells were portally injected with 30\u00d710 6 irradiated B6 C2D splenocytes labeled with PKH-26. Only 3.56 \u00b1 3.19% LSECs endocytosed the labeled splenocytes in the BALB/c CD1d -/mice at 12 h after PI, whereas 16.82 \u00b1 2.69% LSECs endocytosed the labeled splenocytes in the WT control mice (P < 0.001, n = 4 each). When BALB/c WT mice intraperitoneally received 4 \u00b5g \u03b1-GalCer, before PI of B6 C2D splenocytes, the expression of MHC class II on LSECs and endocytic activity of LSECs were enhanced. Thus, we found that the endocytic activity of LSECs was regulated by the iNKT cells. Intraportal adoptive transfer of LSECs isolated from BALB/c WT mice, treated with a PI of B6 C2D splenocytes, into BALB/c mice significantly prolonged the survival of subsequently transplanted heart allografts (n = 4) as compared to the adoptive transfer of LSECs isolated from BALB/c CD1d -/mice, treated similarly, into the BALB/c mice (n = 4). However, intraportal adoptive transfer of LSECs isolated from BALB/c WT mice, which received 4 \u00b5g \u03b1-GalCer intraperitoneally prior to PI of B6 C2D splenocytes, into BALB/c mice did not result in a further prolonging of the effect (n = 4). These findings indicate that iNKT cells are required for such LSEC-induced immunosuppression of T cells with indirect allospecificity; however, \u03b1-GalCer-induced activation of iNKT cells does not promote such suppressive effects on these T cells. In conclusion, naive iNKT cells play a pivotal role in the LSEC-induced immunosuppression of T cells with indirect allospecificity. Notwithstanding the considerable amounts of in-vitro data supporting the nonimmunogenicity and immunomodulatory effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), scanty and conflicting data are available on their in-vivo immunomodulatory capacities.",

MSC, isolated from bone marrow by adherence, were depleted from CD45+CD11b+ cells before injection. Bone marrow-induced hematopoietic mixed chimerism is the most robust mechanism for the induction of transplantation tolerance. However, immunogenicity of bone marrow cells requires harsh immunosuppressive regimens that can lead to severe sideeffects including death. Here, we examined whether embryonic stem (ES) cells can be successfully coaxed to form hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) which potentially could be less immunogenic than bone marrow cells. Here, we transduced ES cells with HOXB4, a hematopoietic transcription factor that confers self-renewal properties to hematopoietic cells and differentiated them into hematopoietic cells. Transduced cells had a 100-1000fold greater proliferation capacity than controls. At the end of the differentiation procedure, most cultures were >80 % CD45 + . HPCs were purified using immunomagnetic bead separation. The separated cells were further characterized for leukocyte markers and showed a high percentage of CD34, CD117, CD31 and low class I, but no class II expression. Further, they poorly express co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86. When transplanted in Rag2 -/\u03b3 c _/_ mice, HPCs fully reconstituted bone marrow, forming multi-lineage hematopoietic cells. To now determine whether these cells engraft in allogenic recipients, the cells were transplanted in syngeneic and allogenic MRL mice. All transplanted animals became chimeric (n>30), reaching 20-30 % after 28 days. Thereafter donor cells declined as a result of out-competition by resident bone marrow cells. This pattern was identical in both syngeneic and allogenic recipients. Unexpectedly, allogenic chimeric mice became tolerant to donor-type cardiac allografts as monitored over 100 days. Grafts showed no mononuclear cell infiltration or signs of chronic rejection. Interestingly, the T cells in tolerant animals showed responses to MRL alloantigen similar to that of controls, suggesting that our protocol was likely non-deletional, but could involve regulatory T cells. Indeed, when stained for CD25 + FoxP3 + cells, the allografts showed a high percentage of these cells, but not in controls, confirming our hypothesis. Thus, these data show for the first time the potential of ES-derived HPCs to regulate engraftment of allografts, providing an alternative approach for the induction of transplantation tolerance. We had previously shown that A20 is part of the regulatory atheroprotective response of endothelial (EC) and smooth muscle (SMC) cells to injury. A20 is a NF-\u03baB dependent gene with potent anti-inflammatory effects in EC and SMC, through blockade of NF-\u03baB. A20 also serves an anti-proliferative function in SMC and opposite anti-apoptotic or pro-apoptotic functions in EC and neointimal SMC. Based on these functions, A20 would be a good candidate to prevent transplant arteriosclerosis (TA) and chronic rejection in vascularized organ grafts. This is supported by A20 expression in EC and SMC correlating with the absence of TA in rat kidney allografts and long-term functioning human kidney allografts. Fully mismatched C57BL/6 (H2 b ) and BALB/c (H2 d ), were used as donors and recipients of an aortic to carotid allograft. In this combination, TA lesions start at 4 weeks and become occlusive by 8 weeks when left without immunosuppression. A20 expression in the graft was achieved by recombinant adenoviral (rAd) mediated gene transfer prior to retrieval. Control mice were infused with saline or control rAd beta-galactosidase. The grafts were harvested at 4 weeks and analyzed for TA lesions by measuring intima to media ratios (I/M) and for markers of inflammation and of the immune response by immunohistochemistry. A20 expressing vessels were significantly protected from intimal hyperplasia with I/M reaching 0.4\u00b1 0.09 as compared to saline (1.62\u00b10.17) and beta-Gal (1.86\u00b10.06) treated vessels. This effect of A20 did not associate with a decrease in infiltrating CD3, CD4 or CD8 T cells in A20 vessels as compared to controls. A possible modification of the phenotype of these T cells (T-regs vs. effector T cells) is being explored. Rather, protection from TA correlated with increased expression of endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthases (NOS) in EC and SMC of A20 expressing vessels, suggesting that this effect was, at least in part, related to increased in situ production of nitric oxide.",

Nalesnik, D. B. Stolz, N. Murase. Thomas E Starzl Transplantation Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA. Chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) is the most common cause of graft loss; however an established therapeutic strategy in preventing/treating CAN is not yet available. We have previously shown that carbon monoxide (CO) effectively inhibits CAN development. Here, we examine the mechanisms of CO in overturning CAN through vascular endothelial cell protection. Methods: Orthotopic kidney transplantation (KTx) was performed in Lewis to binephrectomized BN rats under brief tacrolimus (0.5 mg/kg, d0-6, im). By d60 after KTx, BN developed CAN with decreased creatinine clearance (CCr, 0.58 \u00b10.1 ml/min), significant proteinuria (92.8 \u00b130.5 mg/24h), and increased Banff scores for intimal arteritis, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy. Recipients were then treated with inhaled CO 20 ppm from d60 to d150. Results: Inhaled CO effectively reversed the severity of CAN and markedly improved renal function at d90 (table) and recipient survival (>150d vs. 81d air control). CO treatment resulted in reduced cytokine mRNA levels (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3) and improved Banff scores compared to untreated controls. In untreated allografts, CD31 expression on peritubular capillaries (PTC) was markedly diminished, while CO-treated grafts showed normal CD31 expression, suggesting significant improvement in maintaining PTC integrity with CO. Interestingly, eNOS and iNOS protein expression was significantly upregulated in untreated grafts, while it was maintained at steady levels in CO-treated grafts. Immunohistochemistry revealed eNOS expression on vascular endothelial cells while iNOS on infiltrates. Further, serum nitrate/nitrite levels were significantly higher in untreated than in CO-treated recipients. Elevated levels of MDA, a marker for oxidative stress, in air control group were accordingly reduced in CO-treated grafts.",

Chronic allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a component of chronic rejection and a major cause of graft loss. Non-immunologic factors and indirect allorecognition participate in the pathogenesis of CAV. New therapies with tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) are based on in situ-delivery of alloAg to \"quiescent\" DCs of the recipient's lymphoid organs via apoptotic cells, vesicles or particles. We have shown that the ability of apoptotic cells to deliver alloAg and an inhibitory signal to DCs down-regulates the indirect alloresponse and prolongs allograft survival in mice. Aims: to test if targeting of recipient's DCs in situ with donor apoptotic cells ameliorates CAV by down-regulating indirect pathway allo-immunity. Methods: We performed functional aortic (abdominal) transplantation in mice [BALB/c\u2192C57BL/6 (B6)]. B6 mice were injected i.v. with 10 7 BALB/c UVB-induced early apoptotic splenocytes (d-7). Sixty days later, grafts were evaluated in sections with H&E, vanGieson's (elastic fibers) and Masson's (collagen) techniques. CFSE-labeled 1H3.1 TCRtg CD4 T-cells specific for IA b (B6) loaded with IE\u03b1 52-68 (BALB/c) were used to evaluate the indirect pathway T-cell response. Results: PKH67 + BALB/c apoptotic cells injected (i.v.) in B6 mice were captured by splenic CD8and CD8\u03b1 + DCs, but not plasmacytoid DCs. Splenic DCs with apoptotic cells remained quiescent in vivo (MHC-I/II lo , CD80/86 lo , ICOSL + , PDL-1/2 + ) and were unable to up-regulate MHC-II and CD86 upon culture with GM-CSF. Injection of donor apoptotic cells induced defective activation and deletion of indirect pathway 1H3.1 CD4 T-cells. Therapy with donor apoptotic splenocytes reduced intimal thickness in aortic allografts (100\u00b121 vs.196\u00b128mm in controls; p<0.001 ) and proliferation of \u03b1-smooth muscle cells and collagen deposition. The effect of apoptotic cells was allospecific, superior than that of cells alive, and depended on the physical properties of apoptotic cells, since necrotic cells did not achieve the effect. Treatment with donor apoptotic cells decreased significantly the indirect pathway T-cell response (assessed by ELISPOT for IFN-\u03b3) and reduced the level of circulating alloAb. Conclusion: In situ-targeting of recipient's DCs with (early) apoptotic cells carrying donor alloAg is a novel approach to prevent CAV by down-regulating the indirect pathway alloresponse.",

            "text": "The Antifibrotic Agent, Pirfenidone, Has Direct Inhibitory Effects on T Cell Activation, Proliferation, and Cytokine and Chemokine Production, Leading to Suppression of Host Alloresponses. Gary A. Visner, 1 Fengzhi Liu, 1 Hanzhong Liu, 1 Liqing Wang, 2 Wayne W. Hancock. 2 1 Medicine, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, MA; 2 Pathology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA. There is an urgent need to develop new therapies effective against the fibrotic and other complications of chronic allograft rejection. While pirfenidone (PFD) is an established anti-fibrotic agent, we previously showed that PFD treatment reduced acute rejection in a rat lung transplant model suggesting that it might have direct immune modulating properties. Accordingly, in this study, we tested the effects of PFD on T cell responses. We first evaluated whether PFD alters T cell proliferation and cytokine release in response to T cell receptor (TCR) activation in vitro. Since PFD can inhibit TGF-\u03b2 by mononuclear cell fractions, we also examined whether PFD affects the suppressive effects of regulatory T cells (CD4+CD25+). The effects of PFD on alloantigen-induced T cell proliferation in vivo were then assessed by adoptive transfer of CFSE-labeled T cells across a parent->F1 MHC mismatch, as well as by using a murine heterotopic cardiac allograft model (BALB/c->C57BL/6). PFD was found to significantly inhibit TCR-stimulated CD4+ T proliferation in vitro (p<0.01), whereas CD8+ T cell proliferation was not significantly affected. While the beneficial effects of PFD were not associated with increased CD4+ T cell apoptosis, PFD use inhibited TCR-induced production of multiple cytokines and chemokines, including . Interestingly, there was no change on TGF-\u03b2 production by purified T cells, and PFD also had no effect on the suppressive properties of naturally occurring regulatory T cells. Similar to the in vitro studies, PFD inhibited allo-antigen-induced T cell proliferation in vivo (parent->F1 model), and showed synergistic effects with low dose rapamycin in this model. Lastly, though PFD alone did not affect the tempo of acute cardiac allograft rejection across a full MHC mismatch, use of PFD plus a subtherapeutic regimen of rapamycin significantly prolonged allograft survival (p<0.05), decreased mononuclear cell infiltration and prevented development to chronic rejection, including arteriosclerosis and myocardial fibrosis. We conclude that PFD may be an important new agent in transplantation, with particular relevance to combating chronic rejection by inhibiting both fibroproliferative and alloimmune responses. We have previously reported studies in miniature swine showing that transplantation (Tx) of prevascularized donor islets as part of composite Islet-Kidney (I-K) reversed diabetic hyperglycemia across fully allogeneic barriers, while free islets did not. In order to test the potential clinical applicability of this strategy, we have extended it to a fully allogeneic nonhuman primate model. Methods: Two diabetic baboons received composite IKs and one diabetic baboon received free islets across fully allogeneic barriers. (1) I-K preparation in donors: Two I-Ks were prepared by isolating islets from 60% partial pancreatectomies and injecting them under the autologous renal capsule, allowing for vascularization before allogeneic Tx. These I-Ks were harvested at days 203 and 102 for allogeneic IK Tx. (2) Induction of insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM) and allogeneic I-K or free islet Tx: All recipients received streptozotocin at 2000 mg/m 2 x (Body Surface Area). IDDM was induced successfully in two animals, while one animal required total pancreatectomy to induce IDDM. After confirming IDDM by fasting blood sugar (FBS) >300mg/dl for 3 consecutive days, either I-Ks or free islets were transplanted (single donor to each recipient) with ATG (day -3) followed by MMF and low-dose tacrolimus. Free islets were injected into the liver through the ileocolic vein. Islet function was assessed by FBS and renal function was assessed by serum creatinine. Immunologic status was examined by CML/MLR assays. Results: All three recipients had strong CTL/MLR responses to donors preTx, indicative of a fully allogeneic combination. FBS decreased immediately after I-K Tx and no insulin therapy was required throughout the experimental period (days 225 and 279). BS levels averaged 82.2+/-15.6 mg/dl in the first baboon and 125.4+/-42.7 mg/dl in the second. Normal creatinine levels (<1.0mg/dl) were maintained by these life-supporting IK grafts. In contrast, the recipient of allogeneic free islets had unstable BS levels and required insulin from day 60 (BS 400 at day 60) Conclusions: Life-supporting I-Ks from single donors achieved glucose regulation without insulin therapy and maintained normal renal function. These results demonstrate the feasibility of composite I-K Tx in a non-human primate allogeneic model, with possible clinical applicability for the cure of diabetic nephropathy.",

Background In autoimmune models, peptide-pulsed splenic antigen presenting cells that are chemically fixed with ethylcarbodiimide (ECDI) have been used as a powerful and safe method to induce antigen specific T cell tolerance. ECDI fixed donor cells for allo-antigen specific transplant tolerance has not been well studied. Material and Methods C57BL/6 mice were rendered diabetic by STZ. Kidney subcapsular allogeneic islet transplant was performed 10 days after diabetes stabilization (day 0). 1x10 8 ECDItreated donor splenocytes were injected i.v. either once (day -7) or twice (day -7 and day +1). Animals were analyzed for graft outcome. Results Control mice receiving islet graft alone rejected the graft between day 11 to day 18 (MST = 14 days, N=8). Mice receiving one dose of ECDI-treated donor splenocytes (on day -7) showed similar graft survival as controls (MST = 15 days, N=5). In contrast, mice receiving 2 doses of ECDI-treated donor splenocytes (on day -7 and day +1) showed significant prolongation of graft survival with 72.7% functional grafts at day 60 (N=11), and some remained functional >100 days. This protection is donor-specific as mice receiving ECDI-treated SJL cells rejected Balb/c islet grafts as controls (MST = 18 days, N=4). Immunohistochemistry of protected grafts showed positive insulin staining within well-defined islet architecture. Peri-islet infiltrates were composed of CD4+, CD8+, and CD11c+ cells, with occasional Foxp3+ cells. Anti-donor antibody production (IgG1,G2a,b, G3) was completely abolished in long-term graft survivers. This tolerance was undisturbed by anti-CD25 antibody treatment during maintenance stage, but could not be established if treatment was given around the time of the first donor cell infusion. In addition, lack of PD-L1 also impaired tolerance induction evidenced by using PD-L1 -/as recpients. Conclusion 1.",

Gunton. 1 1 Garvan Institute, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia; 2 NPTU, Westmead, NSW, Australia. The aim was to investigate the effects of increasing HIF-1\u03b1 protein in human islets upon islet-transplant outcomes. HIF-1\u03b1 is a transcription factor which co-ordinates a program of cellular responses to stressors including hypoxia. In other cell-types HIF-1\u03b1 improves survival following hypoxic-challenge. HIF-1\u03b1 functions as a heterodimer with ARNT which we have shown to be important for normal \u03b2-cell function (1) . Islet transplantation subjects islets to hypoxia. It is thought up to 70% of islets die within 1 week of transplantation and this is at least partly due to hypoxia. The role of HIF-1\u03b1 in \u03b2-cell function is unknown. We hypothesized that increasing levels of the protective factor HIF-1\u03b1 in islets before transplantation would improve survival and engraftment and thus improve islet transplant outcomes. Isolated human pancreatic islets from 9 separate donors were cultured overnight in control media, or media supplemented with desferrioxamine (DFO), a small molecular stimulator of HIF-1\u03b1 protein. Islets were transplanted into diabetic SCID mice. There were 3 transplant groups, with mice receiving: 1.Supra-physiological-mass transplant of 2000 control-cultured IEQ (islet equivalents) 2.Minimal-mass-transplant of 600 control-cultured IEQ, or 3.Minimal-mass-transplant of 600 IEQ cultured with DFO. For each human donor, at least 1 of each of the 3 transplant groups was performed to avoid the confounder of inter-donor variability. Recipients of 2000 control IEQ cured in 42% of cases. Minimal-mass-transplantation was ineffective: 600 IEQ cured 0% mice at 28-days. However, minimal-mass-transplant of DFO treated islets had 53% success (p<0.001 vs group 2 and p=ns vs 2000-control-IEQ). Blood glucose levels were markedly improved in the 600 DFO treated group compared to 600 IEQ control group (p<0.0001) and equivalent to 2000 control IEQ transplants (p=ns). This data demonstrates increasing HIF-1\u03b1 in human islets prior to transplantation markedly improves islet transplant outcomes. HIF-1\u03b1 and DFO may have a therapeutic role in human islet transplantation.",

Sub-capsular transplants could be visualized at post-transplant days 3 and 14 using T2 weighted imaging. However, the islets could not be seen on MRI at post-transplant day 180. Injection of the contrast agent gadolinium (Gd)-DTPA for DCE at 3, 14 and 28 days showed increased signal in the transplant area. At 180 days, there was no change in signal intensity after contrast injection during DCE. Immunohistochemistry confirmed MRI and DCE findings. These results suggest that islet neovascularization occurs early after transplantation but is likely not maintained for the 180-day duration of our experiments.

Benshoff, 1 W. Liu, 1 N. Desai, 1 W. Chapman, 1 T. Mohanakumar. 1, 2 1 Surg, WUSM; 2 Path & Immunol, Washington Univ Sch Med, St. Louis, MO. Oleanolic acid (OA), a triterpenoid in medicinal herbs, is an integral part of normal human diet. OA has anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory properties (inhibits iNOS & COX2) & lowers plasma glucose levels. We hypothesis that these properties of OA will prevent early islet cell loss following transplantation & also benefit long term function of allograft. C57BL/6 mice, made diabetic by streptozotocin (200mg/kg) were transplanted with 500 BALB/c islets (isolated by collagenase digestion) under kidney capsule. OA (0.5mg/day) was administered i.p. in 100 \u00b5l of PBS (with 6M DMSO) or PBS-DMSO as vehicle control daily from day -1 onwards. Blood glucose was monitored daily. Immunohistochemical analyses of grafts were performed for CD4 & CD8 markers. Cellular immune responses to donor antigens & cytokines produced by cells and in sera were measured using ELISPOT & Luminex assays. Effect of OA on function of transplant with suboptimal dose of islets (100-250) was also analyzed. Optimal dose of islets (500) transplanted into diabetic BL/6 mice administered with OA significantly reduced time taken to reverse diabetes following transplantation (<2\u00b11 vs 4\u00b12 days, p=0.003). Further, OA treatment reversed diabetes even with suboptimal dose (200) of islets while untreated animals did not achieve normoglycemia. As expected, control diabetic mice rejected on 6\u00b12 days whereas, OA administration alone prolonged islet allograft survival to 23\u00b13 days (p<0001). OA treatment resulted in >3 fold increase in serum KC, IL-10 & VEGF (p<0.0003) & 2 fold decrease in MCP-1, IP-10 & IL-4 (p<0.005) in Luminex assay. Stimulation of splenocytes from OA treated mice with donor BALB/c cells resulted in significantly reduced IFNg (4.5 fold), IL-4 (3.5), IL-2 (2.3) & IL-17 (4). In addition, proliferation in MLR was also reduced 2.5 fold. Immunohistochemical analysis of grafts showed significant reduction in cellular infiltration in OA treated animals with reduction in both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Daily administration of OA markedly improved islet engraftment & function with reversal of diabetes even when suboptimal dose of islet were transplanted. Further, OA treatment allowed significant long term survival of allograft with no other immunosuppression. We demonstrate that prevention of inflammatory signaling cascades by OA resulted in marked reduction of cellular infiltration into graft allowing long term function of allograft.",

Soon Hyang Park, 1 Michel Tremblay, 2 Steven Paraskevas. 1 1 Surgery, McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada; 2 McGill Cancer Center, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada. Purpose: To evaluate the presence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, induced by conditions to which islets are subjected during isolation (ischemia, nutrient deprivation, thermal stress and cytokine release) in human islets and to determine if this leads to the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), which could alter cell survival. Methods: Human islets were purified from cadaveric pancreata by collagenase dissociation and continuous density gradient purification. Islet preparations were cultured in serum-free medium and sampled at the end of isolation and daily thereafter. Total mRNA was purified and gene expression evaluated by RT-PCR. Activity in UPR signaling pathways was evaluated by immunoblot. Apoptosis was measured by a caspase-3 activity assay. Representative trends observed in >5 isolations are described. Results: Following isolation, a rapid increase in UPR signaling was observed in the PERK and IRE-1 modules of the UPR. These include the phosphorylation of PERK target eIF2? and splicing of mRNA for the transcription factor XBP-1. These changes occurred concurrently with a rapid spike in JNK activity and a rise in expression of the UPR target gene CHOP. After these signals peaked, caspase-3 activity increased with time (apoptotic cells), as did expression of ER chaperone Bip (surviving cells).",

Immunosuppressive medication is used to treat GN in the native kidney prior to the development of end-stage renal disease but the impact of different immunosuppression on recurrent GN post-transplantation is unknown. We used the United States Renal Data System to determine the association of routine post-transplantation immunosuppressant use with time to renal allograft failure due to recurrent GN. Immunosuppressants were treated as time-varying covariates. The study-cohort included patients with kidney failure due to GN who received first kidney transplant between 1990 and 2003.

Burke III. 1 1 University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL. BACKGROUND: Disease recurrence is a major obstacle of kidney transplant for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab) has been used for nephrotic syndrome of native kidney. The significant reduction of proteinuria in transplant recipients with FSGS recurrence was also reported after rituximab use for posttransplant lymphoma. We hypothesized that rituximab induction could alter the posttransplant course of FSGS recipients, particularly in those patients with rapid progression to end-stage renal disease who are higher risk of recurrence. METHODS: We compared the outcome of transplants for primary FSGS treated with and without rituximab. From Jan. 2000 to Dec. 2003 received renal allografts along with our \"standard\" immunosuppressive protocol, consisting of tacrolimus, mycophenolate, corticosteroids, antithymocyte globulin and/or daclizubab. From Jan. 2004 to Dec. 2007 received rituximab in addition to the \"standard\" immunosuppression. Posttransplant proteinuria was treated with plasmapheresis (PP) and maintenance angiotensin blockade (AB). RESULTS: There was no adverse event related to rituximab infusion. The overall incidence of posttransplant proteinuria was significantly lower in recipients with rituximab induction (p < 0.05). Four recipients treated with \"standard\" immunosuppression developed massive proteinuria (u-protein/creat. > 10) immediately following transplantation; they responded poorly to PP and AB. Four other recipients had moderate proteinuria. In contrast to this, of the 18 patients induced with rituximab, only 2 had massive proteinuria and 4 had mild to moderate proteinuria which responded well to PP and AB. With a median follow-up of 26 months, there was no significant difference of graft survival between 2 groups (2-year survival: 81% without rituximab vs. 84% with rituximab). A half of the graft loss was related to non-compliance. CONCLUSION: While the mechanism of action is unclear, our observation indicates that rituximab induction may decrease the incidence and severity of recurrence of FSGS following kidney transplantation. A larger-scale study is desirable to confirm this observation.",

            "text": "Mesangial Chimerism in Recurrent IgA Nephropathy. Geoffrey Talmon, 1 Dylan Miller. 1 1 Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. Background IgA nephropathy (IN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis and nearly 50% of patients who undergo a renal transplant for IN recur. Data support that bone Abstracts marrow-derived cells are capable differentiating into various mesenchymal cells within the kidney. The extent to which this phenomenon versus proliferation of resident mesenchymal cells is involved in populating mesangium is not well understood. The mesangial injury and/or hypercellularity seen in IN provides a robust in vivo model for determining if this phenomenon is prevalent in human kidneys. Design Follow-up biopsies from male patients receiving female renal allografts for IN that showed recurrent disease were selected. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization and immunofluorescent staining was performed on unstained slides from the paraffinembedded tissue for smooth muscle actin, X, and Y chromosome centromeres. Cells within nonsclerotic glomeruli with triple positivity (Y+) were assumed to be mesangial cells derived from the recipient. Results Four cases of recurrent IN with nonsclerotic glomeruli were obtained, each displaying at least minimal mesangial proliferation by light microscopy (one \"minimal\", two \"mild\", one \"moderate\"). Mesangial cells with Y chromosome centromeric material were observed in each case (100%). Between 6 and 34 mesangial cells were present in each glomerulus (mean 16.45) with no to three Y+ cells seen (mean 1.8). These accounted for between 8% and 16% of mesangial cells in individual glomeruli. The ratio of Y+ to total mesangial cells in each case ranged from 1:7.8. to 1:11.3 (mean 1:9.35 ). The case exhibiting minimal mesangial hypercellularity had a ratio of 1:9.6, those with mild had ratios of 1:7.8 and 1.8.7, and that with moderate 1:11.3. Conclusions Recipient-derived mesangial cells make up a fraction of the population of glomerular cells in renal allografts affected by recurrent IN. Although the number of cases is small, the number of recipient-derived cells does not seem to be directly related to the degree of mesangial hypercellularity seen by light microscopy. The consistent presence of these \"colonizing\" cells in patients with recurrent IN does, however, suggest that there may be a role for targeted therapy directed against circulating recipient cells. In the mid 1970's, patients developing ESRD secondary to systemic lupus (SLE) were deemed to be poor transplant candidates because of concern for early recurrent lupus nephritis (RLN) leading to allograft loss. Subsequently, RLN was considered an unusual complication of kidney transplantation, occurring in <4% of allografts. However, over the last decade, several reports have shown the frequency of RLN to range from 8-30%. We sought to determine the frequency of RLN at our center and to identify any clinical variables associated with RLN. Between 6/1977 Between 6/ -11/2005 allografts in 166 patients with ESRD due to SLE functioned for more than 90 days after engraftment. Immunosuppression consisted of Azathioprine (AZA), or Cyclosporine (CSA) and AZA, or Mycophenolate (MMF) and CSA, or Tacrolimus and MMF depending on the date of transplant. All received steroids. Proteinuria was defined as 2+ on dipstick or urine protein/creatinine ratio >0.5. Medical charts were reviewed. We found pathologic evidence of RLN in 18 (24%) of 75 patients who underwent biopsy due to allograft dysfunction or proteinuria, comprising 10% of all patients transplanted for SLE. Characteristics of these patients are shown below: Randomized studies have shown little or no increase in AR in kidney tx recips on P-free IS; but concern remains about long-term outcome. We present 8-yr f/u of a protocol incorporating rapid (<6 days) discontinuation of P, with now over 1000 patients transplanted using this protocol. Between 1/1999 Between 1/ and 10/2007 Between 1/ , 1003 adult tx recips were treated with thymoglobulin (5 doses)(extended in DGF), P (5 days), a CNI, and either MMF or SRL. Of these, 658 were LD (260 LURD); 345 DD. Of the 1003, 41% were female;88% white; mean recipient age was 47\u00b1 14 years and mean donor age was 39.7\u00b1 13.2 years. Diabetes was present in 34.3% of the recipients and 12.5% of the transplants were retransplants. The peak PRA was >10% in 20% of recipients; 14% had tx PRA >10%. Table 1 shows actuarial survival rates. Graft survival rates were significantly better in LD vs DD transplants (p=0.002) and and acute rejection rates lower (p=0.04). Compared to national data from SRTR, overall outcomes were not significantly different. With mean follow-up of 3.5 years, a total of 110 (11%) recipients have died -the most common cause being cerebrovascular accident (14%) followed by malignancy (9%). There were only 5 (4.5%) patient deaths due to cardiac causes. Of 195 (19.4%) graft losses, 86 (44%) were from DWF (death with function); 43 (10%) from CR/CAN. Renal function has been stable with mean serum Cr of 1.7 mg/dl at 3 and 5 years posttransplant with cretinine clearance of 63 and 60 respectively. At 5 years posttx, compared to ppretransplant values, recipients showed a 9.6% increase in weight, a 3% decrease in serum cholesterol, and a 10.8% decrease in serum lipid values. 84% of the kidney recips remain P-free; the most common reason for restarting P was acute rejection (AR). Conclusion: Short-term data suggests kidney tx recips do well with rapid discontinuation of P. Our intermediate-term data suggests that patient and graft survival rates remain good and renal function remains stable. Ongoing long-term follow-up is necessary. Background. Since 4/02 our program has employed a steroid-free, Rapamycin and Neoral maintenance immunosuppression regimen for kidney transplant recipients. Prior to that time recipients were treated with prednisone, MMF and Neoral. We noted a significant reduction in acute cellular rejection (ACR) after implementing this regimen. This retrospective analysis was performed to examine the impact, if any, on the incidence, character, and outcomes of early AHR.",

Recipient age, gender, African-American race, AB and DR mismatch, and frequency of PRA>10% was not statistically significantly different between the 2 groups. However, 43% of Grp 1 pts vs 63% of Grp 2 pts received a living donor kidney due to a more recent volume increase in this procedure (p<0.001). There were a total 722 kidney biopsies in 466 pts performed in the first 6 months post-transplant; 478 in 287 pts when excluding pre-perfusion biopsies. Nineteen percent (54/287) of these showed >50% peritubular capillary (PTC) C4d deposition. Comparison of Grp 1 to Grp 2 demonstrated the following: 1) The incidence of clinical acute rejection in the first 6 months was 12.7% (91/717) in Grp 1 and 5.6% (50/894) in Grp 2 (p<0.001), 2) The overall incidence of a C4d+ biopsy was similar in the 2 groups ( Conclusions. Despite a significant reduction in the incidence of acute rejection using our newer, steroid-free immunosuppression protocol, there has been no reduction in the incidence of early (0-6 months) AHR evidenced by C4d+ kidney biopsy.

Lopez-Solis, 1 BACKGROUND: In the current era of liver transplantation, organ shortage continues to be a significant problem. The use of extended criteria allografts from donation after cardiac death (DCD) donors to increase transplantation rates is widely practiced. This study is a review of one of the largest single center experiences utilizing DCD donors in the world with a follow-up of almost 15 years. METHODS: From 03/01/1993 to 10/31/2007, 3,431 liver transplants were performed at our institution, 146 (4.2%) of which were liver allografts from DCD donors. Patient and donor demographics, recipient and graft survival, and the incidence of primary non function, hepatic artery thrombosis, retransplantation, and bile duct complications were analyzed for this subset of recipients. RESULTS: Kaplan Meier analysis showed a 1-and 5-year patient and graft survival of 81% and 71%, and 71% and 59%, respectively. The mean age of recipients was 52 \u00b1 10 years with an average MELD score of 18.7 \u00b1 9.3 (range, 6 to 40), and there were 101 male patients (69%).

Causes of death were sepsis (1), HCV recurrence (1), pulmonary embolism (1) in the Ev gr, and sepsis (1), rupture of splenic artery aneurysm (1) The overall incidence of infection episodes was comparable between two gr (5.9% Ev gr vs 12.5% Cs gr; p=ns). Cholesterol but not triglycerides increased in the Ev gr compared with the Cs gr (p<.05); Ev dose reduction decreased such parameters without the need for statin implementation. CONCLUSION Ev monotherapy in de novo LT showed similar patient survival and incidence of morbidity compared to a Cs immunosuppressive protocol. The primary endpoint was achieved inasmuch as renal function was statistically better in the Ev gr. Background: SIR is a potent immunosuppressive agent that inhibits T-cell activation and proliferation. In LT recipients, SIR has primarily been used as a renal-sparing agent, but its toxicity and tolerability in this population has not been well defined. Aims: To identify the adverse effects and predictors of discontinuation of SIR in LT recipients. Methods: Records from 327 adult LT recipients transplanted between 1/2000 and 12/2006 were reviewed. Reasons for starting and discontinuing SIR were captured, as were all significant adverse effects and laboratory abnormalities. Factors predicting SIR discontinuation in univariate analysis were further analyzed by multivariable logistic regression (MLR). Results: Mean age of the study group was 50 \u00b1 11 years, and 75% were male. Underlying liver disease was HCV \u00b1 alcohol in 56%, 24% had hepatocellular carcinoma, and 14% received living donor grafts. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) were started post-operatively in 91% (85% tacrolimus/15% cyclosporine), with or without mycophenolate and prednisone. 179 patients (54%) started SIR a median of 15 days (IQR: 4-138) post-LT primarily for renal insufficiency (76%) or CNI neurotoxicity (7%). SIR was overlapped with tacrolimus and cyclosporine in 65% and 16%, respectively. Prior to starting SIR, total cholesterol was 139 \u00b1 69 mg/dl, LDL-cholesterol 90 \u00b1 49, triglycerides 193 \u00b1 126. Peak lipids after SIR were 263 \u00b1 97, 138 \u00b1 81, and 475 \u00b1 456 mg/dl, respectively, despite lipid-lowering therapy. Serum creatinine was 2.05 \u00b1 1.04 and 1.08 \u00b1 0.5 mg/dl before and after SIR, respectively. Before SIR, 70% of patients had no proteinuria, but only 36% had no proteinuria after SIR. High range proteinuria (>300mg/dl) was noted in 3% before and 16% after SIR. Finally, SIR was discontinued in total of 81 (45%) patients, for indications of cytopenias (20%), hyperlipidemia (19%), mouth ulcers (11%), sepsis (7.5%), skin reactions (7.5%), nephrotic syndrome (6%), GI intolerance (4%), pneumonitis/BOOP (2.5%), myopathy (2.5%), and combinations of above (20%). MLR failed to identify any pretreatment predictors of discontinuation. Conclusions: Immunosuppression with SIR improves azotemia at the expense of considerable hematologic, metabolic, dermatologic, renal, pulmonary and muscle toxicity. Considering the high incidence of proteinuria after SIR treatment, the use of SIR as a less nephrotoxic agent must be re-considered. and to identify the most effective protocol. Peripheral blood was obtained from 4 EBVseronegative and 4 EBV-seropositive pediatric heart (H) Tx patients. LCL vs DC-based methods were compared as follows: (i) LCL (ii) LCL + IL-12 (iii) Type-1 polarized DC (treated with IL1-b, TNF-a, IL-6 and IFN-g) loaded with MHC class I-restricted EBV-peptide pool (DC/pep.) and (iv) DC/pep. + IL-12. The EBV-specific CD8 + T cell phenotype and function were screened using flow cytometry, IFNg ELISPOT and cytotoxicity assays. The yields and the functional activities of in vitro co-cultures differed based on the induction method employed, and on the EBV status of the patients tested. For the EBV-seropositive pediatric HTx patients, all four methods resulted in the successful expansion of functional Type-1 EBV-specific CD8 + T cells, suggesting that memory CD8 + T cell are readily reactivated in vitro. For the EBV-seronegative pediatric Tx patients however, only the LCL + IL-12 approach resulted in significant augmentation of Type-1 EBV-specific CTLs that were competent to secrete IFN-g (400\u00b150/10 5 cells) and to kill (300\u00b1170 LU/10 7 cells) EBV + targets. We found that IL-27 secreted by LCL (and not by DC) was critical in triggering expression of IL-12Rb2 on naive CD8 + T cells, and rendering these cells responsive to IL-12p70. Further addition of exogenous IL-12p70 (which is generally not produced by LCL) proved to be essential for effective Type-1 priming. However, blocking IL-27 during EBV-priming has abolished IL-12Rb2 expression and subsequent IFNg production. These results demonstrate that the inducible expression of IL-12Rb2 on na\u00efve CD8+ T cells was dependent on IL-27, and support the critical early role of EBV infected B cells in the in vivo priming of na\u00efve precursors into potent EBV Type-1 CD8 + T cell in children. Serial EBV load monitoring in pediatric heart transplant patients (PHTx) has identified a group of asymptomatic children that exhibit persistently high EBV loads in peripheral blood (\u226516,000 copies/ml on at least 50% samples over a period of at least 6 months). These patients have a high rate of progression to late PTLD. Our goal is to characterize the deficiency of EBV-specific CD8 + T-cell immunity that allows this state to occur and be maintained. Twenty-one stable EBV + PHTx patients were categorized as follows: Group 1 (n=6) no detectable viral load; Group 2 (n=12) low viral load (\u226416,000 copies/ ml); Group 3 (n=4) high viral load (\u226516,000 copies/ml). Twelve healthy subjects were recruited as controls. Flow cytometric analysis with HLA-A2 EBV-tetramer (TMR) probes in conjunction with mAbs against memory/activation markers was performed on peripheral blood CD8 + T cells, and their EBV-specific IFN-\u03b3 production was measured by ELISPOT. EBV-\"latent\" specific CD8 + T cells in G2 patients were mostly CD62L + / CD45RO + (central memory) and expressed heterogeneous levels of PD-1 and high CD127 (IL-7 receptor \u03b1), the EBV-lytic-specific CD8 + T cells were more frequent, and biased toward CD62L -/CD45RO + (effector memory) and CD62L -/CD45RA + (stable effector memory), corresponding to terminally differentiated memory compartments. This cell population also expressed heterogeneous levels of PD-1 and down-regulated CD127. In contrast, both EBV-lytic and -latent specific TMR + CD8 + T cells from G3 patients were homogeneously CD62L + /CD45RO + (effector memory), CD38 + and CD127 -, suggestive of \"recently activated\" phenotype. Interestingly, although patients in groups G2 and G3 had high frequencies of EBV-specific TMR + CD8 + T cells (G2 0.65%\u00b11.5, G3 1.9%\u00b13.5, p=0.3), only G2 patients exhibited a direct correlation between TMR + CD8 + T cells and EBV-specific IFN-\u03b3 production. These results demonstrate that different levels of chronic EBV-antigenic pressure trigger significant differences in the phenotypic and functional features of EBV-specific CD8 + T cells from PHTx, suggesting that the immunologic characterization of high EBV load carrier state is a combined \"activated\" phenotype with \"exhausted\" function of EBV-specific CD8 + T cells.",

            "text": "The Both costimulatory and co-inhibitory signals are delivered by B7 ligands through the CD28 family of receptors on T lymphocytes determining the ultimate immune responses. Although B7-H4, a recently discovered member of the B7 family, is known to negatively regulate T cell immunity in autoimmunity and cancer, its role in transplantation rejection and tolerance has not been established. To study its role in physiologic rejection processes, we first treated B6 WT recipients of BALB/c hearts with a blocking mAb against B7-H4 or isotype IgG control and found no difference in graft survival (MST 7 days, n=8 vs. 7, n=10). However, B7-H4 blockade resulted in accelerated allograft rejection in CD28 deficient B6 recipients (MST 9.5 vs. 19, n=8, p=0.003) , indicating that B7-H4 signaling can mediate negative regulation in the absence of CD28 costimulation. We next studied B7-1/B7-2 double deficient (DKO) B6 recipients of BALB/c heart allografts, as these mice are truly independent of CD28/CTLA-4:B7 signals. While cardiac allografts were accepted in control DKO recipients (MST>100, n=5), blocking B7-H4 precipitated rejection (MST 45, n=5, p=0 .01) demonstrating non-redundant functions of these two negative pathways. Based on these results, we next evaluated the role of B7-H4 in acquired transplantation tolerance by blocking CD28:B7 using CTLA4-Ig. B7-H4 blockade abrogated prolongation of allograft survival by CTLA4-Ig (250 \u00b5g on day 2) in the fully MHC-mismatched cardiac allograft model (MST 13 vs. 46.5, n=8, p=0.0002) . We conclude that the novel B7-H4 molecule can regulate alloimmune responses independent of an intact CD28/CTLA-4:B7 costimulatory pathway. The interplay between positive (stimulatory) and negative (regulatory) costimulatory signals is an important determinant of the outcome of the alloimmune response and could be exploited to induce tolerance.",

To further characterize these cells, we analyzed their phenotype and mechanism of action by flow cytometry, western blotting and suppression assays. MDSC expressed CD80 and CD86, NKRP-1, CD172a (SIRPa), CD11a, CD11b, HIS48 and for a fraction of them CD4 but did not express MHC class II molecules. MDSC dose-dependently suppressed the proliferation of T cells in MLR and after stimulation with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 antibodies. Although detected in blood, bone marrow, spleen and lymph nodes, MDSC were only suppressive in blood and bone marrow. This suppression was lost after physical separation from the responding T cells by semi-permeable membranes in transwell assays, as well as after addition of L-NMMA, a selective inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), suggesting a role for NO in the suppression. Western blot analyses revealed that iNOS was expressed only after contact between MDSC and activated CD4 + CD25effector T cells and to a much lesser extent after contact with activated CD4 + CD25 high T reg cells. MDSC affected the viability of stimulated CFSE-labeled effector T cells by blocking their proliferation but not their activation. In contrast, MDSC did not block the response of T reg cells stimulated by anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 antibodies. This selective suppression of effector but not of regulatory T cells was confirmed by cytokine profile analyses. In vivo, the expression of iNOS was higher in the blood of tolerant recipients, as well as in the graft, as compared with isografted recipients. In addition, the injection in stable tolerant animals of aminoguanidine, which inhibits iNOS, induced graft rejection within 3 weeks. In conclusion, these results suggest that MDSC, accumulated in the blood of tolerant recipients of kidney allografts, release high levels of NO after contact with activated effector T cells and specifically control their proliferative response.",

It is not clear whether the unique antigen presenting function of liver DC is intrinsic, or is altered by the microenvironmental factors within the liver. In the present study, we investigated the effect of hepatic stallet cells (HpSC), a unique tissue cells in the liver which were actively expanded in the liver allografts, on generation and function of bone marrow derived DC (BM DC). We hypothesize that liver HpSC may modulate immune response via inhibition of liver dendritic cells (DC) which are known of bone marrow (BM) origin. In this study, DC were propagated from B6 BM cells with GM-CSF for 5 days. Irradiated HpSC isolated from B6 mouse liver were added at the beginning into the culture at HpSC : BMDC progenitor ratio of 1:20. The differentiation, maturation and function of propagated DC were determined by characterizing their surface molecule expression and functions of instructing T cell activation / differentiation. The results showed that addition of HpSC markedly blocked the differentiation of DC from BM precursors (most cells remained in CD11b + CD11cprecursors stages). The incidence of CD11c + cells was 7% vs. 41.6% in normal BM DC culture (without HpSC). The presence of HpSC also prevented maturation of CD11c + DC, as evidenced by low expression of CD40, CD80 and CD86, but high of B7-H1. The inhibitory effect appeared to be mediated by soluble factor (s) produced by HpSC, since addition of the HpSC culture supernatant or transwell culture provided comparable inhibitory activity. Culture of allogeneic CD4 + T cells with HpSC-DC elicited poor proliferative response in a 3d MLR assay, with low IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 production. Three color staining of T cells stimulated by HpSC-DC showed that CD25 + Foxp3 + T cells were preferentially expanded, suggesting that HpSC-DC were capable of inducting Treg. In contrast, BM DC induced vigorous CD4 + T cells proliferation, most of activated CD4 + T cells were CD25 + Foxp3associated with high levels of IFN\u03b3 and IL-2 in the culture, indicating induction of Th1 cells. In conclusion, liver tissue cells, such as HpSC markedly inhibit DC differentiation and maturation, suggesting that the tolerogenic property of liver DC may not be intrinsic, but is altered by the microenvironmental factors in the liver. . Allograft rejection was also significantly accelerated when bm12 hearts were transplanted into CD28KO recipient (MST 14 days). To investigate the mechanisms of these findings, lymphocytes harvested at day 10 post-Tx from spleens and regional lymph nodes were assessed by flow cytometry for phenotypic differentiation of the activation status, regulatory T cell markers and effector cell generation. The ratio of effector to regulatory cells was 1.4: 3.8: 5.2 in the WT, CD28KO and B7DKO recipients, respectively. Cytokine production was evaluated by ELISPOT using donor specific antigen stimulation of recipient splenocytes. The mean IFN-\u03b3 production was 173 spots per 500,000 splenocytes in WT, 206 in CD28KO and 702 in B7DKO. This study for the first time demonstrates the paradoxical role of B7-CD28 co-stimulation in fully allogeneic and class II mismatched grafts and proposes a possible mechanism through the re-alignment of the effector to regulatory T cell ratio in favor of a highly alloreactive immune response. The major concern regarding kidney donation has been whether the occurrence of hyperfiltration, on the background of increasing prevalence of hypertension with aging and the decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) noted in some people as they get older, may put donors at a higher risk for progressive kidney disease. We have previously reported on donors > 20 years after donation and found them to incur no excessive risk of hypertension or kidney disease. Herein, we report on renal and non-renal outcomes on the world's largest experience of kidney donors to date (n=302) who donated more than 35 years ago. Methods: Kidney donors were asked to fill out a survey detailing their medical history since donation and obtain a physical exam and laboratory testing by their local physician.",

For each time period, lung transplant centers were divided into three groups based on each center's annual volume of the procedure (low-volume group = 1-17 procedures per year, medium-volume group = 18-30 procedures per year, high-volume group = greater than 30 procedures per year). Oneyear observed-to-expected patient death ratios were then calculated and compared for each group in each time period. A temporal analysis of the percentage of transplants being performed relative to center volume was also performed. Statistical comparisons were made using chi square testing. Results: A total of 12,603 lung transplant procedures were included in the analysis. In Period 1, there was not a significant difference in the one-year observed-to-expected patient death ratio of low-volume lung transplant centers when compared to high-volume centers (ratio 1.15 for low-volume centers vs. 0.79 for high-volume centers, p = 0.07). By Period 3, however, a significant relationship between center volume and outcomes had emerged (ratio 1.30 for low-volume centers vs. 0.79 for high-volume centers, p = 0.006). Over this same time period, the percentage of lung transplants within the United States that are performed at low-volume centers has decreased significantly (from 43.3% of all lung transplants in Period 1 to 22.7% in Period 3, p < 0.0001), while the percentage being performed at high-volume centers has increased significantly (from 20.5% of all lung transplants in Period 1 to 51.3% in Period 3, p<0.0001). Conclusions: A significant relationship between center volume and patient outcomes has emerged for lung transplantation over the past decade. At the same time, the percentage of these procedures being performed at high-volume centers has increased. These findings suggest that regionalization patterns for a given procedure may be influenced by the presence or absence of a volume-outcomes relationship for that procedure.

In previous studies, we have reported that VEGF possesses potent proinflammatory properties in part via its ability to mediate leukocyte trafficking into allografts. Recently, we discovered that VEGF mediates CD4+ and CD8+ T cell migration via interaction with its receptor KDR (also called VEGFR2). Blockade of T cell KDR significantly inhibits transendothelial migration. These observations suggest that KDR may be a novel T cell receptor for allogeneic lymphocyte recruitment. Here, we first examined the expression of KDR on peripheral human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by FACS analysis. We found that \u2264 1% of circulating T cells express KDR, and its expression was at low levels on individual unactivated T cells. Further, we found that the expression of KDR on T cells increased markedly following activation with mitogen and following interactions with activated allogeneic endothelial cells. Induced expression of KDR on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was at a similar level as that observed on endothelial cells. Therefore, KDR appears to be selectively expressed on T cells, that traffick into allografts. To test the pathophysiological significance of these observations, we analyzed the expression of KDR in a total of 19 cardiac, and 5 renal, human allograft biopsies. We correlated the expression of KDR with CD3+ T cell infiltrates; and by double immunofluorescence staining, we determined co-expression of KDR on individual CD3+ T cell infiltrates. In cardiac allografts we found that KDR was expressed throughout the endomyocardium, and was most notable on endothelial cells in all biopsies examined. By grid counting of 3-4 areas of each biopsy, we found that the mean number of CD3+ T cell infiltrates ranged from 4 to 79 cells/hpf (x600 mag.). By double staining, we noted that KDR was expressed on 29 \u00b1 4 % (mean\u00b1SEM) of these CD3+ T cell infiltrates. Similarly, we found that KDR was co-expressed on CD3+ T cells within renal allografts. While infiltrates were more focal, again 30 \u00b1 2 % (mean\u00b1SEM) of graft infiltrating T cells expressed KDR. Collectively, these observations for the first time identify KDR as a novel receptor on allogeneic T cells. We suggest that intragraft VEGF may interact with T cell KDR to facilitate homing and recruitment of allospecific lymphocytes into allografts.",

Guoping Jiang, 1 Qiwei Zhang, 1 Horng-Ren Yang, 1 Kathleen Brown, 1 John J. Fung, 1 Lina Lu, 1 Shiguang Qian. 1 1 Immunology and General Surgery, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH. The liver allografts are accepted without requirement of immunosuppression in mice. The underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. We hypothesized that it resulted from an abortive T cell response within the liver due to hyporesponsiveness or apoptosis. To test this, we examined the activation and fate of allo-Ag specific CD8 + T cells following liver transplants (LTX) compared with heart transplants (HTX) that were acutely rejected. Following transplantation [B10 (H2 b )\u2192C3H (H2 k )], CFSE labeled CD8 + T cells (10x10 6 ) from Des TCR Tg mice (H2K b specific TCR) were adoptively transferred into recipients. Animals were sacrificed two days following Des T cell administration for analyses of T cells in the grafts or draining lymph nodes (D-LN). Host CD45 + leukocytes were quickly infiltrated following LTX. Among CD3 population \u223c48% were CD4 + and \u223c52% CD8 + . CD8 + T cells were further increased thereafter in grafts and D-LN, associated with high INF-g production. CD8 + T cells in the liver grafts rapidly reduced to 36% by POD 14, and to 12% by POD 40. However, the incidence of CD4 + T cells remained high. CFSE dilution assay and ELISPOT showed an active division of Des + T cells in liver allografts either on POD 7 or 40. These Ag-specific CD8 + T cells functioned well evidenced by IFN-g production in response to allo-Ag. However, compared to HTX, the accumulation of Des + cells in grafts was significantly lower in LTX [9.6% (17x10 4 /heart), and 0.59% (6.14\u00d710 4 /liver)] on POD 7, and further dropped to 0.14% (3.14\u00d710 4 /liver) on POD 40. The expended cohorts of adoptively transferred cells followed by their elimination suggested elimination of Ag-specific CD8 + cells. To examine the role of liver environment, graft CD45non-parenchymal cells (NPC) were isolated tested fro regulatory effect on Des + T cell response. Liver allografts showed significantly expansion of CD45 -NPC, which were donor MHC class I + (H2b + ), B7-H1 + , TRAIL + and low for CD40 and CD86. These cells did not inhibit Des + T cell proliferation in response to B10 spleen stimulation, but significantly enhanced their death, which was dependent on B7-H1/TRAIL. This was confirmed by using CD45 -NPC from B7H1 -/or TRAIL -/mice. In conclusion, activated T cells in liver grafts may stimulate tissue cells to express inhibitory and death inducing molecules, resulting in T cell death and graft acceptance. FOXP3 + graft-infiltrating lymphocytes (GIL) have been detected in the rejecting allografts of transplant patients. FOXP3 is a marker for regulatory T cells (T reg ).",

            "text": "Published reports suggest that human FOXP3 can be upregulated following TCR stimulation without induction of regulatory function. To investigate whether FOXP3 + GIL during acute rejection are T reg , we analyzed the phenotype of GIL harvested from acutely-rejected non-human primate kidney allografts. METHODS: Renal allografts with histologically-confirmed acute rejection were harvested at the time of necropsy from macaques that had undergone experimental transplantation. Following digestion of kidney fragments using collagenase, GIL were isolated using Lymphocyte-Separation Media and cryopreserved. Axillary lymph nodes (Ax LN) were also isolated either at the time of necropsy or by biopsy. For SEB-stimulated lymphocytes, Ax LN cells were stimulated for 5 days in the presence of 25 ng/ml SEB for 5 -6 days. To perform intracellular interferon-gamma (IFNg) analysis, cells were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin in the presence of Brefeldin A for 5 -6 hours at 37\u00b0C. Samples were prepared for flow cytometry by first staining for extracellular antigens. Cells were then fixed and permablized (kit from eBiosciences) prior to intracellular staining for FoxP3, Ki67 and IFNg. RESULTS: The percentage of FOXP3 + in CD3 + GIL was similar to that found in Ax LN ( Table 1 ). The majority of these cells were CD4 + . While 80% of the CD3 + /CD4 + /FOXP3 + population of both AX LN and GIL were CD25 + , a significantly higher frequency of CD39 + and Ki67 + cells were found in GIL (p < 0.01; Student's t-test). Simlar levels of CD39 and Ki67 expression were found in SEB stimulated lymphocytes. Unlike the SEB-stimulated lymphocytes, few IFNg -producing cells were demonstrated following PMA/ionomycin stimulation of GIL. CONCLUSION: Our current data indicates that the majority of FOXP3 + GIL from acutely rejecting renal allografts are recently activated CD4 T cells that lack effector function. This suggests that FOXP3 T cells within rejecting allografts may indeed be T reg . Findings in mouse models of transplantation often fail to translate well in humans. Three variables may account for the discrepancy: (1) evolutionary divergence between mice and humans, (2) influence of infection history on alloimmunity, and (3) use of highly inbred strains of laboratory mice. Here, we investigated whether the use of inbred mouse strains skews the rejection phenotypes and their response to treatment due to decreased genetic diversity and/or fixation of undesirable genetic loci, known as inbreeding depression. We examined heterotopic cardiac allograft survival in outbred and inbred mouse populations in the presence or absence of immunosuppression. In the absence of immunosuppression, heart transplantation within or between outbred stocks of mice (n = 35) resulted in three distinct rejection phenotypes that resemble accelerated (1 -4 days), acute (8 -25 days), and chronic rejection (> 75 days), respectively. In contrast, all fully allogeneic grafts transplanted between inbred mice (n = 12) were rejected acutely (7 -13 days) as were historical controls (n > 50). The accelerated phenotype, present in 29% of outbred to outbred transplantations, was characterized by extensive hemorrhagic necrosis of the heart with thrombosis, neutrophil margination and neutrophilic arteritis, and did not correlate with donor:recipient MHC II disparity. Immunosuppression with T cell costimulation blockade did not prevent accelerated rejection (incidence = 27% in the treated group, n = 26) but did convert the acute rejection phenotype into longterm allograft survival in all groups studied. The same accelerated phenotype was observed if transplantation was performed from outbred to inbred mice (incidence = 39%; n = 23) but could not be duplicated if inbred to outbred transplantation was performed (n = 20). Finally, C3 depletion with cobra venom factor abrogated the accelerated rejection phenotype in outbred to outbred transplantations (n = 16), suggesting a role for complement in the pathogenesis of this phenotype. In summary, our data (1) indicate that the use of outbred mouse stocks may uncover clinically-relevant rejection phenotypes not observed in inbred mouse strains, and (2) underscore the importance of the donor background in determining the phenotype of rejection. Outbred mouse stocks may provide a platform to uncover MHC-unlinked genetic loci that play an important role in the outcome of solid organ transplantation.",

However, little is known about age-dependent alterations of the immune response in organ transplantation. We examined age dependent T-cell functions in a transgenic mouse transplant model. Effector T-cell phenotype, -function, cytokine production and regulatory T-cell function were analyzed in 3 and 18mths old B6 mice. In an in vivo transplant model, BL/6 nude mice were reconstituted with 2x10 6 young or old transgenic alloantigen-specific CD4 + Tcells and engrafted with bm12 skin grafts. T-cell phenotype and cytokine secretion were sequentially analyzed in all lymphatic compartments. Splenocytes of na\u00efve old B6 mice contained significantly higher frequencies of T-cells with an effector/memory phenotype (CD4 + CD44 high CD62L low and CD8 + CD44h igh CD62L low; p<0.005). In vitro proliferation and IFN\u03b3-production were significantly reduced in aged mice indicating an impaired T-cell response with increasing age as assessed by MLR (p<0.005) and ELISPOT (p<0.001). In parallel, regulatory functions remained age-independent as alloantigen-specific CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + T-cells isolated from sensitized old mice demonstrated a dose-dependent well preserved suppressor function. Next, we tested the age-dependent alloantigen -specific CD4 + T-cell function in a transgenic skin transplant model: Age did not significantly impact rejection kinetics (young vs. old: 10.1 vs. 14.3days, n.s.) However, T-cell migration and activation were significantly different: Fewer numbers of activated CD4 + CD25 + and effector/memory phenotype T-cells (CD4 + CD44 high CD62L low ) were found in recipient spleens (p<0.05) and draining lymph nodes (dln) (p<0.05) after transfer of old T-cells. Chemokine receptor staining revealed less CXCR3 + and CCR7 + T-cells in dln following the transfer of old T-cells (total cell numbers x104: CXCR3 + : 10.9\u00b14.2 vs.0.95 \u00b10.2, CCR7 + : 4.7\u00b11.0 vs. 0.35\u00b10.2, p<0.05). This was paralleled by reduced intragraft T-cell infiltration as observed by immunohistochemistry. In summary, native elderly mice showed an increased frequency of effector memory T-cells but an overall impaired T-cell response. Regulatory -T-cell function remained preserved. In vivo allospecific CD4+ T-cell activation and migration was impaired in elderly transplant recipients.",

These patients often experience increased rate of early rejection episodes, which are difficult to control with currently used immunosuppressive agents. Methods: In our model of cardiac graft rejection in sensitized recipients, B6 mice are first challenged with B/c skin, followed 40-60 days later by B/c heart transplant (HTx). Unlike in naive hosts, HTx rejection and alloreactive CD8 activation in this model are CD154 blockade-resistant. We first performed systemic analysis at the intragraft transcriptional level by microarray to identify disparities in local immune responses in naive vs. sensitized hosts. Aiming to improve the efficacy of costimulation blockade in the sensitization settings, we then determined the role of CD4 T cells in costimulation blockade-resistant alloimmune response by using CD4 depleting (GK1.5) vs. CD4 blocking (YTS177) Ab, in conjunction with CD154 blockade (MR1). Results: HTx harvested from groups of na\u00efve (day 4-6), sensitized (day 2-4), control Ig or MR1 Ab treated mice (n=3/gr) were subjected to microarray analysis. MR1 treatment suppressed HTx expression of proinflammatory genes (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), and T cell-targeted chemokines (RANTES, Mig, CXCL10) early after HTx in na\u00efve, but not sensitized recipients. Five groups of sensitized mice treated at the time of HTx with: (1) 5). CTL activation was determined by FACS phenotyping at day 10 and 30. The simultaneous blockade of CD154 costimulation and CD4 help, but not a single blockade with MR1 Ab or anti-CD4 Ab, was required to inhibit peripheral alloreactive CD8 activation in sensitized mice. Additionally, CD8 activation in the absence of CD4 help showed defective cytotoxic molecule profile, with suppressed perforin but upregulated granzyme B expression at the graft site. Conclusion: CD154 blockade-resistant CD8 activation is critically dependent on CD4 T cells. This study provides novel immunological basis to study the potential synergy between adjunctive CD4 and CD154 targeted therapies to control accelerated graft rejection in sensitized hosts.",

            "text": "The hallmark of T cell mediated rejection (TCMR) are interstitial inflammation and tubulitis. The mechanisms of tubulitis and epithelial deterioration during TCMR are unknown. We previously showed that tubulitis in mouse allografts is independent of cytotoxic molecules (GzmA/B, Prf) and is preceded by molecular changes with loss of epithelial genes, reflecting epithelial dedifferentiation. Human TCMR is associated with loss of the same epithelial genes and re-expression of embryonic pathways (Wnt, Notch). We hypothesized that TCMR is mediated through soluble factors released by effector T cells or macrophages in the interstitium, and that supernatants of effector T cells would simulate these changes in epithelial cultures. We established an in vitro model in which cultured primary human renal epithelial cells are incubated with supernatants from effector T cell/monocyte co-cultures. The transcript changes in this model, analyzed by microarrays, closely simulated those in human and mouse TCMR (Fig1), with loss of epithelial transcripts, activation of Wnt/ Notch pathways, and increased expression of Ifng-inducible and injury-related transcripts previously defined in our mouse model. Some of these changes were reproduced by incubation of epithelial cells with Ifng or Tgfb. The in vitro model identified additional epithelial transcript changes not previously identified in vivo (not affected by Ifng or ischemic injury, not expressed in T cells, macrophages, B cells, or NK cells). Expression of these transcripts (n = 305) was highly altered in human TCMR compared to nonrejecting biopsies of 177 human renal allograft biopsies and distinguished TCMR from antibody-mediated rejection in a hierarchical cluster analysis. Thus we have established an in vitro model that closely simulates the epithelial events during human TCMR and confirms that these changes are independent of direct contact with inflammatory cells, supporting the hypothesis that interstitial effector T cells mediate allograft deterioration by soluble mediators. Together with previous mouse and human data these results provide the first in vitro model of the epithelial consequences of TCMR. Objective. C4 split product deposition to HLA antigen-coated microparticles ([C4d] FlowPRA) was previously shown to be a specific marker of C4d-positive antibodymediated rejection (AMR). The objective of this study was to assess the predictive value of [C4d]FlowPRA reactivity in a cohort of non-biopsied patients with stable graft function during the first year. Methods. A total of 133 kidney transplant recipients were enrolled (inclusion criteria: functioning graft at 12 months; prospective collection of sera taken before and at 1-3, 6, and 12 months after transplantation). Included patients were serially screened for humoral panel reactivity applying [IgG] and [C4d]FlowPRA screening. Results. Fifty-four of the included 133 recipients had stable graft function within the first year and were not subjected to diagnostic renal biopsy. In this particular patient group, detection of complement-fixing HLA reactivity tended to be less frequent than in the 79 patients with biopsied graft dysfunction (\u226510% [C4d]FlowPRA before transplantation: 9% vs. 18% of recipients, P=0.2; \u226510% [C4d]FlowPRA after transplantation: 11% vs 24%, P=0.06). In line with our previous results, within the group of biopsied patients, pre-and/or post-Tx [C4d]FlowPRA reactivity was tightly associated with the immunohistochemical detection of peritubular capillary C4d deposition (P=0.005) reflecting ongoing AMR. Remarkably, in initially stable patients, detectable [C4d] FlowPRA reactivity was not associated with inferior long-term outcomes. Within this patient group, recipients with and without (pre-and/or post-transplant) C4d-fixing anti-HLA reactivity did not differ with respect to 4 yr allograft survival (P=0.4), 4 yr serum creatinine levels (1.5 vs. 1.5 mg/dl; P=0.7), and proteinuria at 4 yrs (0.2 vs. 0.18 g/24h; P=0.8). Similar results were obtained for a comparison of [IgG]FlowPRA positive vs. negative subjects. Conclusion. Our data suggest that a considerable number of patients with initially stable graft function may have excellent long-term graft function despite serologically detectable levels of (complement-fixing) alloreactivity. For these antibody-positive recipients, a potential role of graft accommodation can be speculated.",

Joanna Ashton-Chess, 1 In an attempt to identify non-invasive biomarkers of specific histological scarring, we compared publicly available gene sets derived from microarray studies of human renal transplant biopsies published in the literature with our own microarray data derived from studies of rat heart allografts. In this way we identified an immunoproteasome subunit (proteasome subunit beta 10 -PSMB10) as a potentially interesting candidate. PSMB10 is one of three members of the immunoproteasome that are induced by Abstracts interferon gamma. Messenger RNA profiling in renal transplant biopsies (n = 52) with normal histology, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, calcineurin inhibitor toxicity, transplant glomerulopathy or chronic antibody-mediated rejection (Banff 2005) revealed PSMB10 to be strongly and significantly increased in chronic antibody mediated rejection vs. the other three histological diagnoses. Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that PSMB10 mRNA could diagnose chronic antibody-mediated rejection with an AUC of 0.99, a sensitivity of 1.0 and a specificity of 0.95. Moreover, PSMB10 mRNA was significantly increased in the PBMC (n = 24) of patients with chronic antibody-mediated rejection compared to those with normal histology. ROC analyses revealed an impressive AUC of 1.0 with all patients being correctly classified. Similar results were also observed in a rat allograft model where PSMB10 was significantly increased at day 100 post transplantation in both the heart allograft and the PBMC of animals presenting chronic transplant vasculopathy vs. syngeneic grafts. Moreover, inhibition of the proteasome by administration of Velcade\u00ae at 0.1 mg/kg every other day for the first 20 days post transplantation significantly and dose-dependently prolonged allograft survival (MST 31.7 days in velcade-treated vs. 6.3 days in untreated animals).Together our data point towards PSMB10 as a blood and intragraft biomarker of chronic antibody-mediated rejection as well as a potential therapeutic target. Furthermore, our results suggest that using a threshold of PSMB10 in the blood could help in guiding the decision to biopsy in the clinic.",

Valeriya Zarkhin, 1 Snehal Mohile, 1 Li Li, 1 Jonathan Martin, 1 Minnie Sarwal. 1 1 Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA. Introduction: The objective of this study was to investigate the interaction between B-cell activation factor of the TNF family (BAFF) level and circulating B-cell repopulation in pediatric patients with acute kidney transplant rejection treated with the B-cell-depleting agent Rituximab. Methods: 10 pediatric patients (3-23 yrs) with biopsy proven B-cell positive AR were treated with steroids and Rituximab (4 x 375 mg/m 2 /dose/week). All patients were followed up for 12 months. Peripheral blood CD19 cells and donor specific antibodies (DSA) were monitored monthly. Serum level of BAFF was measured by ELISA at AR, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-AR treatment and correlated with clinical outcomes. Results: Complete depletion of circulating and intragraft B-cells was observed with Rituximab, with improvement in AR grade in all patients. The median time of peripheral B-cells repopulation was 5 months (range 3-12 months, Fig. 1A) . No correlation was found between pre-treatment peripheral B-cell number and the B-cell repopulation time (r=0.59, p=0.09). BAFF levels rose significantly with B-cell depletion with maximum values at 3 months post-treatment (7.5 fold increase, p=0.0001) and returned to pre-treatment levels, with B-cell recovery, at 12 months (Fig. 1B) . Serum BAFF levels correlated positively with B-cell depletion >6 months (r=0.91, p=0.004, Fig1B). A lack of depletion of DSA I, but not DSA II correlated with higher BAFF levels (r=0.99, p=0.007).",

We have shown in a longitudinal study that increases in DSA may precede rejection by months. This retrospective analysis evaluates changes in maintenance immunosuppression (MI) and appearance of DSA in stable transplant recipients. Methods: Sera from stable renal transplant recipients were collected at 4-6 month intervals and tested for the presence of DSA. The types and doses of immunosuppression were correlated with the appearance of DSA. Two hundred eighty stable renal transplant recipients who received either a deceased or a living donor kidney were monitored post-transplantation for the development of DSA. Patients have been followed for 1 to 7 years and had a minimum of 4 serum samples analyzed. All recipients received anti-lymphocyte induction therapy. Maintenance immunosuppression (MI) consisted of a calcineurin inhibitor, prednisolone, and mycophenolic acid. HLA single antigen beads analyzed in the Luminex instrument were used to establish donor specificity of the antibodies. A chart review was undertaken to determine the doses of the MI posttransplantation. All MI was managed by the transplant team and changed according to clinical indications without regard to DSA. Results: Of the 280 patients monitored 37 developed DSA post-transplantation with a functioning graft. DSA was against HLA-Class II antigens in 26 of 37 (70%); Class I antigens in 8 of 37 (22%); and against both Class I and II antigens in 3 of 37 (8%). DSA against Class II was against DQ in all except one case. In the majority of the recipients the appearance of DSA was preceded with dose reduction of the MI, either calcineurin inhibitor or mycophenolic acid or both. Conclusions: Our data show that DSA developed predominantly against HLA-class II antigens and that the appearance of DSA was often preceded with reduction of one or more of the MI. This data shows the importance of monitoring DSA with MI decreases in a stable allograft recipient.",

Herrera, 1 Joshua Miller. 1 1 Division of Organ Transplantation, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL. Immunosuppressive medications are primarily designed to target T cell proliferation. Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) exerts its effect by inhibiting de-novo synthesis of Guanine, a DNA building block. We, and others, have previously shown that MPA (active metabolite of MMF) affects the differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells (DC). We further demonstrated that cell-surface receptors associated with antigen up-take and antigen-processing and presentation (CD83 and CD205) are down regulated when cells are matured in the presence of MPA. This phenotype translated into a decreased uptake of alloantigens and reduced stimulation of T cells. We concluded that MMF inhibits also cell functions requiring mRNA synthesis. We now present data regarding the role of MPA in maturation and function of B-lineage cells. PBMCs from 10 subjects were cultured in the presence of CpG, IL-2, IL-10 and CD40L for 5 days to induce memory B and plasma cell maturation in-vitro. Cultures were performed in the presence or absence of MPA (50 ugr/ul) for the length of the incubation period. In-vitro stimulation of B cells increased the memory population (CD19+ CD27+) from 2.8 +/-1.1% to 7 +/-2%. Similarly, plasma cells were increased from 4.4 +/-1.3% to 6.4 +/-1.8%. The addition of MPA to the culture inhibited stimulation for both memory and plasma cells (4.7 +/-3% p=0.01; and 4.7 +/-2.3% p=NS, respectively). We have further analyzed the effects of MPA on antibody secretion using an ELISA (measuring soluble antibodies) as well as a B-cell ELISPOT assay (assessing the number of B cells that produce antibodies). While an expected increase in OD values was observed for stimulated samples compared with non-stimulated samples, a significant decrease was observed when stimulation occurred in the presence of MPA. Nonstimulated cells: 0.249 +/-0.28; Stimulated cells: 0.391+/-0.33; MPA treated stimulated cells: 0.279+/-0.43; p<0.0005). The number of antibody producing cells was also significantly lowered when cultures were done in the presence of MPA (a mean of 106 cells were counted for the stimulated cells compared with 1-2 cells for non-stimulated and MPA-treated-stimulated cells). To our knowledge this is the first time where in-vitro experimental data document the inhibitory effect of MPA on B lineage cells and antibody secretion, although clinically known for some time. These results confirm our previous observations regarding the effects of MMF on non-proliferating immune cells.",

Background: In a previous study, we found that healthy people developed HLA Abs after immunization against hepatitis B virus. The aim of this prospective study was to establish if stimulation with influenza vaccine is capable of triggering the production of HLA and MICA Abs. Methods: We determined the presence of HLA and MICA Abs (de novo and preformed Abs) in 3 groups of patients vaccinated against influenza: A) 42 healthy adults, B) 40 ESRD patients, and C) 25 TR. Additionally, we followed 22 healthy unvaccinated people without exposure to sensitizing factor: D) control group. Sera samples were collected at baseline (pre influenza shot), at 1 week, and monthly up 6 months after immunization. HLA Abs were assessed with Labscreen Single Antigen beads for Luminex. All samples of each patient were tested simultaneously. A luminescence value higher than 500 was considered positive only if it was 3 times the baseline value. We analyzed the data using Chi square, one way ANOVA test, and Logistic regression. Results: The table shows the types of Abs in each group. Interestingly, we found preformed Abs across all four groups, including the control group (which is free of any known sensitizing factors). The proportion of de novo Abs was higher in the group B and C. Multivariate analysis shows that the only independent factor associated with development of de novo Abs was the presence of preformed Abs.",

Decisions about the minimization and ultimate withdrawal of immunosuppression (IS) would be facilitated by the identification of biomarkers associated with operational tolerance (OT). Methods. As part of an ITN/NIH supported study tolerant kidney transplant recipients (off all IS for > 1yr with stable function, N=22) were compared to recipients with stable function on IS (SIS, N=34), recipients with chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN, N=20), and healthy volunteers (HV, N=18). PBMC, whole blood total RNA, and urine samples from each group were examined using flow cytometry, microarrays, and RT-PCR respectively. Results. Analysis of microarrays revealed significantly higher expression of B cell differentiation genes in tolerant recipients compared to the SIS and CAN groups. Consistent with this finding, tolerant recipients also displayed higher numbers of na\u00efve B cells in peripheral blood and increased expression of CD20 in urine relative to the SIS and CAN groups. No differences in Treg or genes associated with regulatory cells were observed in tolerant recipients relative to other groups. These analyses failed to demonstrate significant differences between tolerant recipients and HVs although support vector machine learning methods suggested potential differences in a number of genes including NFAT and calcineurin. Finally, relative to tolerant patients, those with CAN showed decreased numbers of T and NK cells and expressed lower levels of genes associated with immune cell activation in peripheral blood. Conclusions. Differences in B cell numbers may be useful in identifying tolerant renal transplant recipients or those predisposed to developing tolerance and could potentially provide insights into the mechanisms of tolerance.",

Complement activation, and C4d deposition, has been correlated with humoral rejection of allografts. However, utility of C4d staining in LTx has been controversial. A recent study (Arthritis Rheum. 2004 Nov; 50(11) :3596-604) shows a strong correlation between erythrocyte bound C4d (E-C4d) in diagnosis and monitoring of SLE. Goal of our study is to determine the utility of measuring E-C4d in the diagnosis of humoral rejection following human LTx. 26 LTx recipients were analyzed post-LTx for E-C4d using FACS of RBCs incubated with anti-C4d (Quidel) followed by FITC-goat anti-mouse.10 normals were also analyzed. The serum was analyzed for development of anti-HLA Abs by solid phase assays and for the presence of autoAbs to K\u03b11 tubulin and collagenV (ELISA). Biopsies from 11 patients were stained immunohistochemically for C3d deposition. Summary of results are presented in Table 1 . Infection=2/10 AR=0/10 % E-C4d in normals-10.35%; MFI in normals-5.46; MFI=Mean Fluorescence Intensity; AR=Acute Rejection; DSA=Donor Specific Abs 16 out of 26 patients show significant increase in the % bound E-C4d (P<0.05) as compared to controls.11/16 had anti-HLA and 13/16 had autoAbs which were significantly different from those with low E-C4d (P= 0.005). Staining of the biopsies showed C3d deposition in 6 recipients with increased E-C4d. All 4 patients with acute humoral rejection had elevated E-C4d. We conclude that there is a significant correlation between increase in % E-C4d in LTx recipients and development of Abs to either HLA antigens or auto-antigens during the post-LTx period. Biopsies from patients with increased E-C4d showed deposition of C3d in the allografts. Preliminary data suggest that measurement of E-C4d using a non-invasive method of flow cytometry may be of value in monitoring LTx patients for humoral rejection.",

            "text": "Innate Immunity: Chemokines, Cytokines Innate immunity is emerging as an important initiator and modulator of the adaptive immune response. In the setting of transplantation, ischemia-reperfusion injury and tissue trauma appear to potentiate the alloimmune response. One of the mechanisms through which the innate immune system modulates an adaptive immune response is dendritic cells (DC). In this study, we examined DC activation in a mouse model of skin transplantation by monitoring the expression of MHC II and p40 chain of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-12. The p40 expression was detected in live cells using the Yet40 reporter mouse, in which a transgene for yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was placed downstream of the endogenous IL-12p40 gene, thus faithfully \"reporting\" p40 expression. Skins from C57BL/6 or BALB/c donors were grafted on the dorsal thorax of C57BL/6.Yet40 mice. Draining and non-draining lymph nodes (LN) were harvested at 24 hours and examined for YFP expression by fluorescent microscopy. A marked increase in the numbers of YFP-expressing DC was observed in draining LN in both syngeneic and allogeneic graft recipients. Surprisingly, YFP-expressing DC also increased in nondraining LN when compared to non-transplanted controls. Similarly, DC in draining and non-draining LN showed higher MHC II expression than those in non-transplanted controls. Upregulation of MHC II was highest at 24 hours and decreased significantly by 48-72 hours. To assess whether DC activation in non-draining LN was functionally significant, we monitored the activation of adoptively transferred ovalbumin-specific OT-II TCR transgenic T cells in response to footpad antigen challenge in mice with or without a syngeneic skin transplant on the contralateral upper thorax. OTII T cells in transplanted animals proliferated approximately 5-to10-fold better and a higher percentage of the OTII cells produced IL-2 than those from non-transplanted animals. Thus, local surgical trauma results in a widespread, time-limited, functional activation of DC that appears to act as a partial adjuvant for T cell responses. Together, these data suggest that surgical trauma may incite a systemic barrier to transplantation via the activation of DC and therapeutic interventions that reduce the surgical trauma and DC activation may help to improve survival of transplanted grafts.",

Although donor/tissue dendritic cells (dDC) have long been known to play a key role in mounting alloimmune responses, however, their generation, trafficking and role in tolerance have not rigorously examined. We have used B6.FVB-Tg (Itgax-DTR/ EGFP) 57 mice which has a GFP linked to the CD11c promoter. Using these mice as the donors of heart allograft transplantation provided us a unique model to study dDC posttransplantation. Our trafficking data indicate there is a rapid migration of dDC into spleen (3 hours post transplantation) but not lymph nodes and that dDC were unexpectedly detected in the spleen of the recipients long after rejection of heart allografts suggesting dDC could escape from the immunosurveillance of host immune system. Our data also show that dDC proliferate in the lymphoid tissue of the recipients and co-express Class II molecule of the recipients. We then show that CX3CR1 pathway regulates generation Abstracts of heart tissue DC constitutively. As compared to WT hearts, CX3CR1 -/hearts contain lower number of DC and transplanting CX3CR1 -/donor hearts into WT BALB/c mice led to significant prolongation of allograft survival without immunosuppression (MST of 8 vs. 17 days, respectively). Increasing CX3CR1 -/heart DC by implanting donors with FLT3-producing hybridoma cells has restored the time of rejection. Unexpectedly, induction of long-term survival with anti-CD154 blockade (MR1) and CTLA-4 Ig (but not low dose Rapamycine) was abrogated when CX3CR1 -/hearts were used as donors, with concomitant lesser Tregs in the CX3CR1 -/heart allografts as compared to WT. Furthermore, co-transplanting hearts from WT and CX3CR1 -/into the same recipient treated with MR1 resulted in significant prolongation of CX3CR1 -/heart allograft survival. Depleting the dDC of heart donors prior to transplantation with diphtheria toxin also worsened markedly chronic rejection in the recipients at day 100 post-transplantation. Our data indicate that, in contrast to the widely accepted dogma, the presence of donor DC in graft tissue is not only central to allograft rejection but also is necessary for the induction and maintenance of peripheral tolerance.",

            "text": "The innate system of immunity plays an important role in ischemia-reperfusion injury and allograft rejection. The early stages of inflammatory processes are accompanied by complement activation. One biological consequence of this activation is the release of potent inflammatory anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a, which have been reported to regulate a range of inflammatory responses. We previously reported that DCs express C3aR and C5aR, and C3a-C3aR interaction has a positive impact on murine BM DCs, in terms of activation phenotype and capacity for Ag uptake and allostimulation. However, the role of C5a in modulating DC function remains unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of local C5aR signalling in modulating murine BM DC function and subsequent regulation of the allospecific T cell response. We first evaluated if C5a-C5aR interaction could result from local expression of factors. Our results showed that C5aR mRNA was detected in WT DCs at different stage of DC culture by RT-PCR, and C5a was detected by ELISA in the culture supernatants from different stages of DC culture. We next determined if C5a-C5aR interaction modulates DC function in allospecific T cell stimulation in vitro and in vivo. We found that BM DCs cultured from C5aR-/-mice or treated with C5aR antagonist (C5aRa, W54011) exhibited a less activated phenotype (producing significantly less IL-12 and more IL-10, in response to LPS stimulation); both C5aR-/-and antagonist-treated DCs (LPS stimulated) showed reduced capacity to stimulate na\u00efve alloreactive T cells, as measured by IFN-\u03b3 production and thymidine uptake. As regards interaction in vivo, following i.p. administration of the C5aRa-treated DCs into allogeneic mice for 10 days, ex vivo mixed lymphocyte reaction showed that CD4+ T cells from those recipients have reduced thymidine uptake, but increased IL-4 production compared to that with untreated DCs. Conversely, DCs treated with C5aR agonist (C5a) exhibited a more activated phenotype (producing more IL-12 and less IL-10) and were more potent in allospecific T cell stimulation. Our findings demonstrate that murine BM DCs can express C5aR and C5a can be generated locally; C5a-C5aR interaction up-regulates murine BMDC activation and their allostimulatory capacity. Thus, targeting C5a-mediated signal may be able to prevent allograft injury.",

Fairchild. 1 1 Immunology, Glickman Urological and Kidney Institute., Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH. OBJECTIVES: The acute phase cytokines IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 are produced early during inflammatory processes, including wound healing and ischemia/reperfusion. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of these cytokines in the induction of early chemokine production and leukocyte infiltration into heart allografts. METHODS: C57BL/6 (H-2b), BALB/c (H-2d), and BALB/c.IL-6-/-mice received vascularized syngeneic or complete MHC mismatched, A/J (H-2a), cardiac grafts. Grafts were retrieved at different time points and total RNA and tissue protein were prepared and analyzed by quantitative RT/PCR and ELISA to test expression levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, CXCL1/KC, CXCL2/MIP-2, and CCL2/MCP-1 in the grafts. Anti-TNF\u03b1 mAb (500 ug) was given at the time of transplantation with or without anti-CD154 mAb (200 ug on days 1 and 2). Infiltration of CD4+, CD8+ T cells, neutrophils and macrophages was assessed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Donor-reactive T cell priming to IFN-g producing cells in the recipient spleen was measured by ELISPOT. RESULTS: Expression of TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 mRNA reached an initial peak at 3 hrs post-transplant and a second peak at 9-12 hrs with equivalent levels in both iso-and allo-grafts. The neutrophil and macrophage chemoattractants CXCL1/KC, CXCL2/ MIP-2 and CCL2/MCP-1 reached peak levels at 9 hrs post-transplant in both sets of grafts and then declined to background levels. IL-6 deficiency in the recipient or the cardiac allograft did not prolong allograft survival. In untreated mice, heart allografts were rejected at 8.6 \u00b1 0.6 days after transplantation. Anti-TNF\u03b1 mAb decreased neutrophil and macrophage chemoattractant levels 50% at 9 hrs post-transplant and subsequent neutrophil, macrophage and CD8+ cell infiltration into the allografts as well as extended graft survival to 14.1 \u00b1 0.8 days. Anti-TNF\u03b1 mAb also decreased the number of donor-reactive IFN-g producing CD8 T cells almost 90% on day 7 post-transplant. Whereas anti-CD154 mAb prolonged survival to day 21, administration of anti-TNF\u03b1 and anti-CD154 mAb delayed rejection to day 32 and resulted in the long-term (> 80 days) survival of 40% of the heart allografts. CONCLUSIONS; These data indicate that anti-TNF\u03b1 antibodies can delay donorreactive CD8 T cell priming and leukocyte infiltration into heart allografts rejection. As a conjunctive therapy, TNFa antibodies can promote long-term survival of the allografts.",

T cells that were stimulated by allogeneic APCs in conditioned media harvested from LPS-activated DCs proliferated more than APC-stimulated T cells that were cultured in conditioned media derived from non-LPS-activated DCs. The ability of CD4 and CD8 T cells to respond to allogeneic APCs in the LPS-activated conditioned media was significantly impaired by the addition of either anti-IL-6 or anti-TNF\u03b1 mABs. The addition of both mABs further diminshed T cell proliferation, indicating that IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 synergize to augment in vitro T cell allostimulation. In support of these findings, we noted reduced T cell proliferation during the MLR when T cells were cultured in conditioned media derived from either IL-6-/-or TNF\u03b1-/-LPSactivated DCs. Furthermore, these diminished responses was restored by the addition of recombinant IL-6 or TNF\u03b1, respectively. To examine the in vivo implications of these findings, we employed a murine skin allograft model, with recipients that were either B6 wild type, IL-6-/-or TNF\u03b1-/-. These groups were transplanted with a BALB/c skin graft and treated with (or without) perioperative costimulatory blockade (CTLA4 Ig and anti-CD154). In the absence of immune modulation, all groups rejected BALB/c skin allografts at a similar tempo (<12 days). In the presence of costimulatory blockade, IL-6-/-recipients (median survival time, MST = 22 days, p =0.05) rejected their allografts at a slower tempo compared to WT (MST = 16 days) or TNF\u03b1-/-recipients (MST = 18 days). However, this response in IL-6-/-recipients was further delayed by administering a TNF\u03b1 inhibiting mAB (MST = 60 days), indicating that synergy between IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 occurs in vivo and prevents the ability of costimulatory blockade to delay the onset of allograft rejection. Conclusions We conclude that synergy between IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 augments T cell alloimmune responses and impairs the effects of costimulatory blockade to delay allograft rejection.",

An oral glucose tolerance test and endothelial function investigation with laser Doppler flowmetry was performed in 44 patients, 10 weeks and 12 months following transplantation. Results: Insulin sensitivity differed already 10 weeks posttransplant and was significantly better after 12 months in patients never treated with CNI drugs (P=0.043). Endothelial function was significantly correlated with insulin sensitivity (N=27, R 2 =0.22, P=0.013) at 10 weeks posttransplant, but not after 12 months (P=0.54). Insulin secretion tended to be higher in CNI treated patients both at week 10 and month 12 (P=0.068). Conclusions: Findings in the present study indicate that long-term CNI treatment reduce insulin sensitivity which was associated with impaired endothelial function. In response to this peripheral insulin resistance a tendency towards a compensatory increase in insulin secretion was seen. These effects combined may indicate a future risk for premature cardiovascular disease in CNI treated renal transplant recipients, but this hypothesis needs further study. Group(n) Ktx Ptx(KPtx) ECD Re-tx PRA(>20%) Race(AA) Low Immunologic Risk Alem (113) Overall pt, Ktx, and Ptx survival are 96, 92, and 86% at 16 months median follow-up. Actuarial survival rates, initial length of stay, delayed graft function, steroid free rates, major infection, and incidence of PTLD (1 rATG pt) were similar for Alem and rATG groups, but treated acute rejection (AR) occurred in 17(15%) Alem pts compared to 29(27%) rATG pts (p=0.03) and biopsy proven rejection (BPAR) in 13(12%) Alem pts compared to 23(21%) rATG pts (p=0.04). Only 1 Alem BPAR has occurred after 12 months. Total daily MMF doses were similar for Alem and rATG groups at 3 months (1567\u00b1457mg vs 1670\u00b1508mg). Neupogen use was greater in the Alem group, 26(23%), than in the rATG group (14(13%), p=0.03). Excluding PAK, chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) was observed in 19(17%) Alem pts and 27(25%) rATG pts. (p=0.14). Conclusions: Alem and rATG induction both provide excellent 1 and 2 yr pt, Ktx, and Ptx survival. Alem is associated with lower acute rejection rates and perhaps less CAN, but requires increased Neupogen administration to help maintain MMF dosing.",

            "text": "Thymoglobulin Dosing Intensity and Density: Effects on Induction Efficacy Ruth-Ann M. Lee, 1 Adele H. Rike, 1 Background: Alemtuzumab (Campath 1H) has been used as induction therapy for kidney transplant recipients with acute rejection rates reported by us and others of 7 to 20% at one year. The histologic type of rejection and the time frame for occurrence after treatment with alemtuzumab have not been well established. This study is a retrospective single center review of acute rejection episodes of kidney transplant recipients treated with alemtuzumab induction with respect to the kinetics and histologic patterns of acute allograft rejection. Methods: From 11/01/03 to 10/31/06, 416 kidney transplants were done meeting the inclusion criteria for this review. All patients had negative T and B cell flow cytometric crossmatches and received induction therapy with alemtuzumab 30mg IV intra-operatively, methylprednisolone 500 -750 mg during the first 24 hours, and were then maintained on tacrolimus (target level 5-7) and mycophenolate mofetil without steroids. All episodes of biopsy-proven acute rejection (AR) were reviewed. Patients in pre-transplant desensitization protocols or with documented non-adherence with medications were excluded from the analysis. Results: A total of 44 of 416 patients (10.6%) experienced AR during the study period, with a mean follow up of 28 months (range 14-48 months). Of the AR episodes, 19 (43%) occurred within the first 3 months post-transplant, 13 (30%) occurred between 3-6 months, 5 (11%) occurred between 6-9 months, 1 (2%) occurred between 9-12 months, and 6 (14%) occurred more than one year post-transplant. Of the rejection episodes within the first 3 months post-transplant, 9/19 occurred within the first 30 days. Histologic analysis showed that 9/19 rejection episodes (47%) within the first 3 months included an antibody mediated component (6/9 within the first 30 days.) In contrast, 3/25 rejection episodes (12%) which occurred greater than 3 months post-transplant were antibody mediated. Of the 12 patients with antibody mediated rejection, only 3 patients had panel reactive antibody (PRA) levels > 25% at the time of transplant. Conclusion: This large experience with alemtuzumab induction therapy with a steroidfree maintenance protocol, demonstrates that the majority of rejection episodes occur within the first 6 months post-transplant, with the largest fraction in the first 3 months. A significant number of early rejection episodes are antibody mediated and occur in unsensitized recipients. In a randomized, international, multicenter study, comparing the use of Thymoglobulin (TMG) and basiliximab (BAS) in recipients at high risk for delayed graft function (DGF) or rejection, TMG was associated with less acute rejection (15.6 % vs 25.5%, P=0.02) and a lower triple endpoint (rejection, death or graft loss, 20.6% TMG vs 33.6% BAS, P=0.02) but not a significantly lower quadruple endpoint including DGF. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of TMG and BAS for induction stratified by donor source: standard criteria donor (SCD), extended criteria donor (ECD) or donor with hypertension (HTN). Methods: Retrospective review of data collected in the original randomized trial. Data-capture limitations necessitated defining ECD as donor age > 60 or donor age between 50 and 60 with both a donor history of HTN and donor renal insufficiency (history of ATN or creatinine above 2.5 mg/dl during the 24 hours prior to organ recovery/start of cold ischemia time). Results: 75 recipients received ECD kidneys [TMG n=40 (28.4%), BAS n=35 (25.6%), P=NS]. Outcomes are presented below. There were no differences in the rates of DGF between the groups examined. Conclusion: Standard and non-HTN donor recipients had a tremendous benefit of TMG compared to BAS with less acute rejection and death. Contrary to the perceived niche of TMG in ECD recipients, TMG has its most beneficial effect in SCD recipients and recipients of donors without HTN at risk for acute rejection or DGF.",

Patient characteristics of populations treated with ATG versus basiliximab were similar concerning average age (48 years), gender and dialysis time prior to transplantation (78 vs. 88 months). Average donor age and cold ischemia were also comparable (43 vs. 41 years and 833 vs. 852 minutes). The actuarial 5-year patient survival for the ATG subpopulation is 91,7 % in comparison to 85 % in the basiliximab group (n.s.). Analyzing graft survival after 5 years, rates of 88,3 % in ATG patients compared to 75 % in the basiliximab group can be observed (n.s.). The incidence of acute rejection episodes was similar in both groups (ATG: n=20 vs. basiliximab: n=16). 18 (30%) patients in the ATG group and 20 (33,3%) in the basiliximab group showed a delayed graft function. Serum creatinine was not significantly different at 1 and 5 years (ATG: 1,4\u00b10,6 mg/dl and 1,4\u00b10,8 mg/dl vs. basiliximab: 1,3\u00b10,7 mg/dl and 1,5\u00b10,9 mg/dl). Patients in the ATG group had a higher rate of CMV infections (n=13 vs. n=3; p=0,05), whereas patients treated with basiliximab had significantly more hematological complications like anaemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Conclusion. Comparing induction therapy with ATG and basiliximab, our data shows similar patient and graft survival rates with slightly better results in the ATG group. Patients treated with ATG had a higher rate of CMV infections but less hematological complications. Predicting cardiovascular events (CVD) and the varied effects of immunosuppressive medication on CVD risk factors requires an understanding of how traditional and nontraditional risk factors impact CVD after kidney transplantation (KTx). Single-center studies have generally lacked statistical power and generalizability. Registry studies have lacked sufficient data on CVD risk factors. The PORT project is creating a multicenter international database of KTx recipients with the primary objective of developing risk prediction models for post-transplant CVD. As a preliminary data assessment, an analysis was done on 19,669 KTx from 1990-2007 from 11 transplant centers representing 5 European centers, 4 North American centers, and 2 centers from Asia/Oceania. All data were extracted from preexisting databases at each individual transplant center and processed into the consolidated PORT database. 1,131 major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were identified, defined as non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction, cardiac Abstracts arrest, and sudden death. The MACE-free survival curves by participating center are shown in the figure.",

The prevalence of diabetes pre-transplant varied from 10% to 47% across centers. In Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, gender, race, donor type, transplant center, and reported history of diabetes, hypertension (HTN), and AMI, patients with a reported history of AMI had a 112% increased risk (79%-152%, p<0.0001) for MACE. For the final analysis, the definition of MACE will be expanded to include major revascularization events. The final PORT database will be used to develop and validate an equation to predict MACE and other health outcomes of interest, after accounting for differential CVD risk factors internationally. Abstracts to center. The most commonly used BP medications were beta-blockers, followed by CCBs, and both were used with the same frequency at 1 and 6 months. In contrast, the percentage of patients on an ACEI or ARB more than doubled between 1 and 6 months, suggesting reluctance to use these agents early after Tx (a practice not necessarily evidence-based); however, more than 70% of subjects did not receive ACEI/ARB therapy even at 6 months. Fewer than half of all patients received aspirin, including only 60% with DM and/or CVD. Similarly, only half with DM and/or CVD received a statin at 1 and 6 months. These data indicate current management of KTx recipients fails to utilize optimal CVD risk reduction measures in a timely fashion, perhaps missing an opportunity to reduce long-term morbidity and mortality from CVD in this at-risk population. Background: Cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction has been a primary reason for pursuing early corticosteroid withdrawal (ECSWD). To date, actual cardiovascular event data (CVE) (rather than CV risk) has not been reported for ECSWD. Therefore, we analyzed and compared actual CV events (CVE) and CV-related survival in ECSWD (\u22647 days) and chronic corticosteroid (CCS) pts. Methods: CVE and heart failure (HF) data were prospectively collected. CVE were defined as sudden death, myocardial infarction, angina, and cerebrovascular accident/ transient ischemic attack. HF events were defined as pulmonary edema or HF diagnosis. Conclusions: RTx recipients receiving ECSWD experienced: 1) fewer CVE and 2) a trend toward overall better pt survival. These differences in CVE and pt survival do not present until at least 3 yrs PTx. and therefore require long term followup to become evident.",

Conclusions+Discussion : In tolerant graft after pediatric living-donor Ltx, neither acute nor chronic rejection was observed, but fibrosis developed. Because of the similar extents of CD4 + and CD8 + cells infiltrates and different follow up time between tolerant and immunosuppressed patients, it remains questionable whether fibrosis in tolerant graft is antigen-dependent. Serial protocol biopsy before and after starting weaning IS will detect fibrosis early, and observing whether reintroduction of maintenance IS reverses fibrosis in that case will answer this question.

Nonetheless, some patients encountered rejection while they were undergoing weaning from IS. It is,therefore,essential to identify and characterize the differences that will enable patients in these two distinct populations to be distinguished reliably. Methods: The study groups consisted of group tolerance(Gr-Tol) in which 88 patients are successfully weaned off from IS, and group rejection (Gr-Rej) in which 22 patients experienced clinically evident rejection during or after weaning process. The correlation between the clinical outcome (success or failure of weaning IS) and following parameters was assessed ; donor/recipient age, donor/recipient gender, ABO compatibility, HLA mismatch, graft size, early (<1month) rejection episode and initial immunosuppression.Results: There was no difference between Gr-Tol and Gr-Rej with respect to donor/recipient age (Gr-Tol and Gr-Rej;32y and 32y NS/35m and 26m NS), or donor/recipient gender (Gr-Tol and Gr-Rej (female);60% and 50% NS/60% and 73% NS).

Patients with fulminant liver failure (FHF) who undergo auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation (APOLT) have a chance to come off immunosuprresion (ISP) when the native liver regenerates. It may be most beneficial for children with FHF; however, the literature regarding its use in children has been limited. From the beginning of the pediatric liver transplant program at our institution, 31 patients underwent liver transplantation for FHF. Of those, 7 received APOLT and the remaining standard liver transplantation (OLT). Seven children (age 8months to 8 years) who received APOT (APOLT group) were compared to matched control group of 11 patients (OLT group). Since APOLT was offered routinely at out instituting since 2005, 6 of APOLT cases were done since 2005. In APOLT group, either left lateral segment or left lobe graft was used. Recipients left lobe was removed in all cases. In OLT group, 7 received whole liver graft and 4 received partial liver graft. All native livers showed submassive to massive necrosis at the time of transplant in pathology. All children (100%) in APOLT group are currently alive with a median follow up of 761 days (range 116-4139 days) where 8 (72%) patients are alive in OLT group (median follow up 1724 days). Six of 7 children in APOLT group (87%) showed native liver regeneration. First four APOLT recipients (57%) are currently off ISP with fully regenerated native liver. Two of those patients developed complete atrophy of the graft liver, one underwent graft removal due to sepsis caused by severe rejection. One remaining patient who is off ISP is displaying progressive atrophy of the transplant liver. Incidence of acute rejection was 57% (4/7) in APOLT group vs 30% (3/10) in OLT group.

As such, it could therefore be a prime target for therapeutic intervention, with goals to rescue the patient from liver failure and /or to improve post-transplantation outcomes. Background HRS is a reversible renal failure which occurs in pts with advanced liver disease and portal hypertension and is characterized by a marked decrease in GFR and RPF in absence of other identifiable causes. Vasodilation theory is currently the most accepted hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis. In decompensated cirrhotics, probability of developing HRS is 8-20%/yr and increases to 40% at 5 yrs. Ideal treatment is LTx. However, there is an urgent need for effective alternative tx to increase surv chances for pts until LTx can be performed. Interventions that have shown some promise are vasoconstrictors in splanchnic circulation and TIPS. Main objective was to compare efficacy of two different regimens (albumin/terlipressin resp HES/terlipressin both w/ wo midotrine) against TIPS whereas GRF was considered as primary efficacy endpoint.

Although a marked improvement was observed during iv-treatment, renal fct deteriorated upon treatment withdrawal whereas pts with continued mitodrine showed superior long term outcome. We analyze our single institution experience to quantify the long-term incidence of renal failure based on month 3 GFR compared to subsequent determinations. Methods: This is an IRB approved retrospective review of the prospectively maintained database of LT recipients. Exclusion: patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) at time of transplant, combined liver kidney, fulminant hepatic failure, and <1-year follow-up. GFRs (I 125 iothalamate Glofil method) were measured at initial evaluation (IE), month 3 (M3), year 1 (Y1), 2 (Y2), 5 (Y5), 10 (Y10), and 15 (Y15). Patients were grouped by GFR >80 (G1), 60-80 (G2), and <60 (G3). IE and M3 GFR were used as starting points for longitudinal analyses. Paired data analysis for IE, M3, Y5 and Y10 was also performed. Renal failure was defined as GFR <30, received kidney transplant, on dialysis, or on kidney transplant list. Results: 592 liver transplant patients were reviewed between 1985 and 1999. Paired Glofil data was available for the Y5 and Y10 analysis in 114 patients. M3 GFR correlated more with long-term renal function (p<0.0024). G1 demonstrated largest reductions in GFR over time. G2 and G3, when corrected for patients that got kidney transplantation and RRT, demonstrated progressive reduction in GFR. G3, G2, and G1 were statistically significant (p<0.001 Wilcoxon two-sample test).",

M3 GFR correlates better with long-term renal function compared to IE GFR (not truly reflective of renal function at time of LT). If M3 GFR <60, data showed a high rate of renal failure in our paired data analysis by Y5 (p<0.0024). By correcting for patients with renal failure, the previously reported stability in GFR between Y1 and Y5 is not seen. Analysis of grouping demonstrates that G1 patients at M3 have lower incidence of renal failure >10 years after LT. G2 and G3 patients will be at higher risk for renal failure each year after transplantation. Introduction: Calcineurin inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in liver transplantation. However, they have a potential to impair renal function. Delayed tacrolimus (TAC) administration may reduce the risk of renal dysfunction. Methods: A prospective study included liver transplant pts randomised to delayed introduction of TAC (Day 5) + Daclizumab (DAC) (Group A) or to immediate TAC administration (Group B). In both groups TAC T0 was 10-20 ng/ml until Week 4 and 5-15 ng/ml thereafter. MMF was given at 2 g/d for 2 months, and corticosteroids (CS) at standard doses. Pts with a serum creatinine (SCr) > 180 \u00b5mol/l at 12 hours (H12) were excluded. The primary endpoint was the rate of pts with a mean SCr > 130 mmol/l at Month 6. Month 24 results are presented. Results: 207 pts were randomised. Baseline characteristics were similar. At Month 6, mean TAC T0 was 9.6 (Group A) and 11.2 ng/ml (Group B ",

            "text": "Acute rejection is a complex biologic process involving multiple cell types, cytokines and chemokines/chemokine receptors. We hypothesized that an mRNA panel that included genes implicated in the anti-allograft response would distinguish allografts undergoing acute rejection from normal allografts with a high degree of accuracy. We tested this hypothesis by measuring levels of urinary cell mRNA and peripheral blood cell mRNA for cell surface proteins CD3, CD20, CD25, CD103, and CTLA4; chemokines/ chemokine receptors IP10, MIG, CXCR3; cytotoxic attack molecules granzyme B(GB) and perforin, and immunoregulators Foxp3, TGF-beta1 and IL-10. Gene specific primer pairs and probes were used in pre-amplification enhanced real time quantitative PCR assays to measure mRNA and transcripts for 18s rRNA. For each cell source, we used logistic regression to identify a linear function of up to 5 log-transformed measures that would distinguish biopsies of AR patients from those of Stable transplant patients. Our study demonstrates that molecular signatures developed using urinary cell levels of just 5 genes (Signature 1, urinary cell levels of mRNA for CTLA4, Foxp3, GB, CD3, and MIG), or a combination of 3 urinary and blood cell levels (Signature 3, urinary cell level of CTLA4 mRNA and peripheral blood cell levels of CD103 and CTLA4) differentiate AR from Stable biopsies with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Blood cell levels alone are also informative, but less so. We conclude that molecular signatures, developed from noninvasively ascertained mRNA profiles of urinary cells/ peripheral blood cells, predict acute rejection with extraordinary accuracy. Clinical Trials to validate the predictive value of these signatures are worthy of pursuit. We have described the association of CD20+ B cell infiltrates in renal transplant (Tx) biopsies (bxs) with acute cellular rejection (ACR) and Tx dysfunction (dysfx). We have also found metabolically active plasma cells (Pcs) staining for S6 ribosomal protein (S6rp) within these Txs. Herein, we report the significance of CD138+ Pcs in rejection (rj) and evaluate the impact of CD20, CD138, and S6rp on long term Tx fx by calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl). We studied 46 Tx bxs from 32 pediatric (ped) patients (pts) who were bxed for suspicion of rj from Nov 2001 to Nov 2004. Pts were given Daclizumab and maintained on prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus or cyclosporine. Immunohistochemical staining and quantification for CD20, CD138, S6rp, and C4d were performed under 500x light microscopy. Bxs were classified by modified Banff 97 criteria. CrCl was followed 2 yr post-bx. CD138+ Pcs were associated with C4d-negative ACR (p=0.0002) but not antibody mediated rj (AMR, p=0.82). ROC analysis confirmed >5 CD138+ cells/hpf strongly associated with ACR, yielding 89% sensitivity, 83% specificity, correctly classifying 84% and comprising total ROC area 0.92 (95% CI 0.82, 1). Higher CD138 counts at bx correlated with worse Tx fx (Fig 1) . A univariate regression model showed that CD20, CD138, S6rp and time were associated with a decline in Tx fx at bx. Multivariate model showed that CD20, CD138, and time had the main effects on CrCl decline, with S6rp dropping out. All patients regardless of rj status had a 16 ml/min/1.73 m 2 CrCl decline exerted by time (p=0.004). Pts with CD20 had an additional sustained 19 ml/min/1.73 m 2 CrCl decline seen 2yrs post-bx (p=0.03). Pts with CD138 also had 19 ml/min/1.73 m 2 CrCl decline at bx (p=0.03), but there was an interaction between time and CD138 that negated a sustained effect (p=0.04). This study identifies a numerical threshold of >5 CD138 cells/hpf that is associated with ACR and Tx dysfx. Infiltrating CD20 cells had the greatest, sustained effect on Tx dysfx. We conclude that cells of the B lineage, particularly CD20, play a key, but undefined, role in ACR.",

However, it is unknown whether FOXP3+ cells are present during chronic antibody mediated rejection. Moreover, the relative balance of regulatory, effector and cytotoxic pathways in chronic vs. acute injury has yet to be explored. Here we addressed this issue. Intragraft regulatory, effector and cytotoxic transcriptional profiles were analysed within renal transplant biopsies (n = 43) classified (Banff 2005) as displaying normal histology, chronic calcineurin inhibitor toxicity (CNItox), chronic antibody mediated rejection (CAMR) and acute cellular rejection (ACR). Granzyme B, Tbet and FOXP3 mRNA were measured by quantitative PCR and FOXP3 -positive cells were additionally quantified in graft biopsies by immunohistochemistry.

Expression of FOXP3 mRNA correlated tightly with the density of FOXP3 protein-positive cells by immunohistochemistry (Spearman r = 0.71; p < 0.0001); FOXP3+ cells were found in aggregates and within tubules. Moreover, graft cytotoxic, effector and regulatory pathways were all found to be active in chronic as well as acute graft injury. Significant increases in Granzymze B, Tbet and FOXP3 mRNA were observed in CAMR, CNI-tox and ACR compared to normal histology (p<0.0001, p<0.001 or p<0.05). However, differences in the relative contribution of each pathway were evident, with significant accumulation of FOXP3 mRNA predominating in ACR and granzyme B predominating in CAMR. Thus, CAMR can be distinguished from both ACR and CNI-tox by an unfavorable intragraft Granzyme B/FOXP3 mRNA ratio (p< 0.05). Interestingly, this ratio was reversed in the blood, suggesting different migratory patterns for regulatory and cytotoxic cells between the blood and the graft.Our data thus confirm that intragraft and peripheral blood FOXP3 accumulation is also a feature of CAMR of kidney grafts. Moreover, CAMR can be distinguished from other graft injury types based on its intragraft or blood cytoxicity/regulatory profile. Survival of solid organ grafts depends on life long immunosuppression which results in increased rates of infection and malignancy. Induction of tolerance to allograft would represent the optimal solution for controlling both chronic rejection and side effects of immunosuppression. We previously showed that operational tolerance after kidney transplantation could occur in some patient. Here, the potential of high throughput microarray technology allowed us to study the peripheral blood gene expression profile associated to operational tolerance and chronic rejection in a cohort of human kidney graft recipients (n=26). Microarrays were used to compare the gene expression profile of PBMC from patients with chronic rejection and drug-free operationally tolerant recipients. Results have been treated using a classical statistical and a non-statistical analysis based on the identification of key leader genes associated respectively to chronic rejection and operational tolerance, either as those mostly changing their expression or having the strongest interconnections. 343 differentially expressed genes were identified between operational tolerant patients and patients with chronic rejection.",

The population was 55% female, 92% Black, 15% Hispanic, 71% deceased donor kidney, 47% diabetic, 49% greater than High School education, 36% employed, 30% married or cohabiting, 63% income <20K per year, 65% insured by Medicaid. Mean age 47.8\u00b113.5 yrs, time on dialysis 72.8\u00b151 mos, months since transplant 23.9\u00b114.3, total meds 7.3\u00b13.0. By Pearson correlation, non-adherence (NA), defined as \"having missed doses of immunosuppression over the preceding 3 months\", was not correlated with race, gender, income, type of insurance, age, marital status, type of txp, mos on dialysis, time since transplant, or number of medications. NA was correlated with higher education level (r=0.4, p=0.006), current employment (r=0.3, p=0.05), and knowledge of most recent creatinine value (r=0.35, p=0.015). NA was associated with concerns regarding prednisone (long term effects, dependency) r=0.33, p=0.018, feelings of greater personal control over illness (r=0.36, p=0.011), and inversely correlated with powerful others LOC (feeling that one's health is dependent on other people), r=-0.31, p=0.029 and belief in the necessity of medication for maintenance of transplant health, r=-0.3, p=0.031. We conclude, in our population of inner-City patients: 1. NA is not associated with standard demographic factors including income, race and gender. 2. Contrary to findings in other populations, NA is associated with higher education and current employment. 3. NA is associated with knowledge about creatinine value, concern regarding long-term effects of prednisone and disbelief in the importance of transplant medications. 4. NA is associated with feelings of personal control and feeling that powerful others (e.g. health care providers) are not of high importance in the outcome of illness. 5. Education programs designed to address NA in this population should be targeted towards altering negative beliefs regarding medications and stress the importance of partnering with the transplant team for optimal long-term outcome. Purpose: The present study aimed to prospectively examine the relationships among nonadherence, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and family factors in adolescent kidney, liver, and heart transplant recipients. Method: 68 adolescent transplant recipients aged 11 to 20 years (M = 15.8, SD = 2.5; 44% female; 57% kidney, 25% liver, 18% heart) and their parents participated. At baseline and 18-month follow-up assessments, adolescents and their parents independently completed phone interviews assessing self-/proxy-reported medication adherence, HRQOL, and family cohesion and conflict. Medical record reviews were conducted to obtain current medications, immunosuppressant drug assays, and clinical outcomes in the past year (i.e., rejection episodes, hospitalizations, graft loss). Results: At baseline, adolescents classified as nonadherent based on self-report and Tacrolimus standard deviation (SD) reported significantly lower general health perceptions (F(3, 64) = 3.63, p < .05), self-esteem (F = 4.58, p < .01), mental health (F = 3.09, p < .05), and behavior HRQOL (F = 2.75, p < .05) compared to adolescents classified as adherent. Similarly, parents of adolescents classified as nonadherent reported significantly lower physical functioning (F = 3.18, p < .05), self-esteem (F = 5.85, p < .01), and behavior HRQOL (F = 2.82, p < .05) for their adolescents. Family conflict was correlated with adolescent report of behavior (r = -.49, p < .01), physical functioning (r = -.33, p < .01), self-esteem (r = -.42, p < .01), and mental health HRQOL (r = -.34, p < .01). Family conflict was correlated with parent report of behavior (r = -.46, p < .01) and physical functioning (r = .24, p < .05). Improvement and deterioration in HRQOL from baseline to 18-month follow-up is currently being examined. It is expected that increased family conflict and decreased medication adherence will be associated with deteriorations in HRQOL.",

Methods: 396 patients received kidney Tx from 9/2004 to 12/2006, 74% from living donors. cTnT was measured during the pre-Tx workup and periodically while on the Tx waiting list. 261 patients (64%) had a dobutamine stress echo (DSE) and 103 (26%) had a coronary angiogram. The combined end point of the study was death or major cardiac events. Survival was censored for graft loss. Results: Mean age was 51+12, 59% males.

Immunity against auto-and alloantigens was measured before and during one year after transplantation. Cellular auto-and alloreactivity was assessed by lymphocyte stimulation tests against autoantigens and cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor assays, respectively. Humoral reactivity was measured by auto-and alloantibodies. Clinical outcome parameters remained blinded until their correlation with immunological parameters. Results: All patients showed significant improvement of metabolic control and 13 out of 21 became insulin-independent. Multivariate analyses showed that presence of cellular autoimmunity before and after transplantation was associated with delayed insulinindependence (p=0.001 and p=0.01, respectively) and lower circulating C-peptide levels during the first year after transplantation (p=0.002 and p=0.02, respectively). 7/8 patients without pre-existent T-cell autoreactivity became insulin-independent, versus 0/4 patients reactive to both islet autoantigens GAD and IA-2 before transplantation.

Weiss, 1 Gerard Smits, 2 Alexander C. Wiseman. 1 1 Division of Renal Diseases and Hypertension, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO; 2 CSC, Inc, Santa Barbara, CA. Background: Simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPK) is regarded as the treatment of choice for type 1 diabetes (DM1) and kidney dysfunction. However, the morbidity associated with pancreas transplant leads many patients to select kidney alone (KA) rather than SPK. The aim of this study was to quantify the impact of early pancreas graft failure (within 12 months of transplant) on kidney graft and patient survival following SPK. Methods: From the SRTR database, we evaluated all patients transplanted from the SPK waitlist from 1997-2005. Patients were placed into 4 groups: Group 1: SPK recipients with pancreas graft function at 12 months post-transplant, Group 2: SPK recipients with loss of pancreas graft function within 12 months post-transplant, Group 3: Recipients of deceased donor (DD) KA, Group 4: Recipients of living donor (LD) KA. Exclusion criteria included death or kidney graft loss prior to 12 months posttransplant. We then compared patient and kidney graft survival at 72 months. Results: There were 9630 transplants from the SPK waitlist from 1997-2005. Of those, 7952 received SPK, 616 received DD KA, and 1062 received LD KA. 12 month patient and kidney graft survival was 95.9% and 92.0% vs 95.6 and 90.3% vs 97.2 and 94.8%, respectively (SPK vs LD KA, p=0.036 and 0.001, LD KA vs DD KA, p=0.099 and <0.001). For 12 month survivors with functioning kidney grafts, we then compared kidney and patient graft survival at 72 months.",

Li. 1 1 Transplant Research Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Boston, MA.Background: Transplant rejection is mediated primarily by adaptive immune cells such as T cells and B cells. However, dismantling the allografts involves many other cell types including cells in the innate immune system. The daunting difficulty in creating transplant tolerance under stringent conditions stimulates renewed interests in the role of innate immune cells, especially NK cells, in the induction of transplant rejection. Methods: We used Rag-/-and Rag-/-IL-2Rg-/-double mutant mice as transplant recipients to critically examine the alloreactivity of NK cells in a stringent skin transplant model. Both Rag-/-and Rag-/-IL-2Rg-/-mice are deficient for T and B cells. In contrast to the Rag-/-IL-2Rg-/-mice that are also deficient for NK cells, the Rag-/-mice have a large population of functional NK cells. Thus, the role of NK cells in mediating skin allograft rejection can be precisely studied in the absence of any adaptive immune cells.",

These populations lay parallel to MZ and FO populations, respectively, when analyzed in terms of IgM and IgD expression. MZ, Uk1 and Uk2 populations exhibited binding of \u03b1Gal. ELISPOT analysis determined that \u03b1Gal secretion was limited to MZ and Uk1 B cells. Na\u00efve or LPS-activated Uk2 and FO B cells do not produce \u03b1Gal specific antibodies. Additionally, restoration of \u03b1Gal specific antibody production in \u00b5MT/GT 0 mice was only found in recipients of MZ or Uk1 cells. Histological analysis showed that both Uk1 and Uk2 B cells are located in the marginal zone of the spleen, but only Uk1 B cells are capable of circulating to lymph nodes. Conclusions. We have identified two novel B cell populations (Uk1 and Uk2) that reside in the splenic marginal zone of the M86VHVLGT 0 mouse. These populations differ from MZ and FO B cells in their expression levels of IgM and IgD, and from each other both in their capacity to migrate to the lymph nodes and produce \u03b1Gal specific antibodies. Uk1 and MZ B cell populations are responsible for the production of \u03b1Gal specific antibodies.",

A significant increase in expression of MAPK1 (9.1 fold; MAPK/ERK pathway), TANK (4.83 fold), WNT2 (4.59 fold) and BMP4 (11.31 fold) was observed in ECs primed with SSC of anti-HLA Ab compared to control Ab. Further, a significant decrease in the expression of e-selectin, p-selectin, PECAM1, ICAM-1, VACM-1 was also observed in primed ECs compared to controls. These results demonstrate that priming of the ECs with SSC of anti-HLA Abs result in the activation of the MAPK, Hedge Hog and Wnt pathway which can lead to cell survival signals and decreased expression of the adhesion molecules and chemotactic ligands. A second stimulus of the primed ECs with high concentration of HLA leads to Bcl2 and HO-1 upregulation and decreased expression of adhesion molecules that can lead to decreased alloimmune responses resulting in the observed prolongation of the accommodated allografts.",

Dong Zhang, 1 Wensheng Zhang, 1 Yan Tian,1   XinXiao Zheng.1 1 Surgery, Starzl Transplantation Institute, University of  Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA.    Recently we have reported that CD4+ T-cells could convert to CD4-CD8-CD3+ (DN) T-cells after either allogeneic or syngeneic DC triggered proliferation, and IL-2 and IL-15 enhanced the conversion. Converted DN T-cells were resistant to AICD and expressed unique cell markers and gene profile. Moreover, converted DN T-cells were more potent in suppressing alloantigen triggered proliferation of na\u00cfve CD4+CD25-T-cells than na\u00efve and proliferated CD4+CD25+ Tregs in vitro. In this study we further test the function of the converted DN T-cells in autoimmune diabetic NOD models. Adoptive transfer of T-cells from diabetic NOD mice precipitated a rapid onset of diabetes in all NOD/SCID recipients. In contrast, NOD/SCID recipients received DN T-cells(converted from CD4+ T-cells of diabetic NOD mice) alone remain diabetic free more than 30 weeks. The co-transfer of DN T-cells with diabetogenic T-cells at 1: 1 ratio significantly delay the onset of diabetes in NOD/SCID mice (P=0.0012). Thus, DN T-cells converted from diabetogenic CD4+ T-cells from diabetic NOD mice were capable of suppressing autoimmunity. Interestingly, the addition of GAD65 peptide, a beta-cell specific antigen, in the conversion further enhanced the suppressive function of DN T cells. In a prediabetic NOD model, the adoptive transfer of 2 x 10 6 DN T cells (converted from NOD CD4+ T-cells by co-culture with NOD DC plus rIL-15 and GAD65 in MLR) into 5 weeks old prediabetic NOD female mice resulted in significantly delay of onset of diabetes. Only 25% mice became diabetes at 22 weeks after DN T cell transfer compare with 75% mice became diabetic in control group. Moreover, a single transfer of 4 x 10 6 DN T-cells reversed new onset of diabetes, albeit transient, in autoimmune NOD mice. We then combined rapamycin with DN T-cells in a MHC mismatched islet allograft model in spontaneous autoimmune diabetic NOD recipients. The single transfer of 5 x 10 6 DN T-cells plus 14 days low dose rapamycin treatment significantly prolonged islet allograft survival in comparison with untreated group (MST 40 days vs. 6 days) and rapamycin alone treated group MST (40 days vs. 8 days).",

Methods: In a multicenter study, renal function and efficacy (biopsy-proven acute rejection; BPAR) were compared in de MMF 72\u00b130 mL/min) and change in CrCl since baseline, were clinically comparable and not statistically different between groups. After month 1, CrCl remained stable in the everolimus group, but declined in the MMF group.

Our laboratory implemented testing anti-T. cruzi for donors at risk in September 2006 and began to test all organ donors for anti-T. cruzi using FDA approved EIA on April 15, 2007. Aim: To evaluate the prevalence of donors with risk factors for exposure to the Chagas disease vector and to compare the results with the data obtained using the serological screening test (EIA+RIPA). Our survey indicates that a large proportion of donors in S. California are at risk of being exposed to the vectors carrying T. cruzi. However, few have evidence of the actual infections as determined by self report and/or EIA+RIPA testing.

Starzl, 1 Fadi Lakkis, 1 Adriana Zeevi, 1 Ron Shapiro. 1 1 UPMC. donor kidney transplantation was performed under a regimen of recipient pretreatment with Alemtuzumab and tacrolimus monotherapy with subsequent weaning. Methods: We performed 200 consecutive unselected living donor kidney transplants (donor kidneys were removed laparoscopically) from 03/14/2003 to 12/12/2005 using 30 mg (or 0.5mg/kg) alemtuzumab and tacrolimus monotherapy. At 6 months posttransplant and every 2 to 6 months interval, we used clinical data (including ELISA antibody titers, Cylex T-cell activation assay, and identification of donor specific antibodies) to wean tacrolimus when possible (bid-->qd-->qod-->tiw-->biw-->qwk). The recipients included 4 HIV+, 17 pediatric patients, and 25 re-transplants. The mean follow up was 35.7+9.9 months. 0%, and 25.0%, respectively. 60.1% of recipients had been weaned to spaced-dose (qod or less) tacrolimus monotherapy. The preweaning incidence of ACR was 7.0%, and the postweaning incidence was 23.5%. A total of 50 recipients had ACR, with a total of 89 ACR episodes. Most (88.7%, 79/89) episodes of ACR were Banff 1 and were sensitive to steroid pulses. At least eight had antibody-mediated rejection (with donor specific antibody and C4d) and received IVIg and/or plamapheresis. 13 patients were treated with alemtuzumab with resolution/improvement of ACR. 94.4% of recipients are still completely steroid-free on tacrolimus monotherapy from the time of transplantation. There was no DGF or CMV disease, and the incidence of post-transplant insulin dependent diabetes mellitus was 0.5%. Conclusion: This report represents the largest series to date with the longest mean follow-up (3 years) of living donor kidney transplantations under alemtuzumab preconditioning with tacrolimus monotherapy, and confirms the 3-year safety and efficacy of this approach.Antibody-Mediated Rejection (AMR) in Renal Allograft RecipientsTreated with Alemtuzumab Induction.

Jevnikar.1 1 Nephrology,  University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.    : Despite advances in immunotherapy, acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) poses a significant risk to graft survival. Standard treatment (ST) of AMR currently consists of plasma exchange (PLEX) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion. Since neutrophils and antibody-producing plasma cells contribute to AMR, cyclophosphamide (CYP) has been used in our centre to treat ST-failures. To our knowledge, we present the first description of salvage CYP for AMR. Methods: From January 2001 to July 2007, 23 of 450 transplants performed at our center developed biopsy-proven C4d+ AMR treated with ST. Seven patients were refractory to ST as defined by persistent biopsy-proven rejection (persistance of glomerular and interstitial neutrophils infiltrate, C4d+)and no clinical improvment within 10 days of ST. These patients received 1 to 3 doses of CYP iv (500 mg). We compared functional outcomes achieved in CYP-treated patients with ST-responders. Mean follow-up was 20\u00b115 and 30\u00b125 mo in CYP and ST groups, respectively. Results: All patients were transplanted through a negative preoperative AHG-CDC T cell cross-match. Patients salvaged with CYP had higher pre-transplant immunological risk as demonstrated by a mean PRA of 85\u00b125% (vs. 15\u00b125% in ST group) in association with retransplantation (100 vs 50%). All the CYP-treated patients received prophylactic peritransplant PLEX/IVIG compared to 38% for the ST group. Patients salvaged with CYP received more IVIG (4.8\u00b11.5 vs 2.8\u00b12 g/kg, p=0.02) and PLEX (19\u00b15 vs 10\u00b17, p=0.003) in comparison to ST-treated patients. In the CYP-treated group, sCr following ST did not initially improve (346\u00b1256 \u00b5mol/L at diagnosis vs. 337\u00b1171 \u00b5mol/L one day before CYP). However, CYP administration was effective in treating refractory AMR as demonstrated by 6 month sCr (153\u00b141 \u00b5mol/L, p=0.02 vs. pre-treatment level) and not significantly different than sCr of ST responders (149\u00b146 \u00b5mol/L, p=NS). One-year sCr and graft survival, following the AMR episodes, were equivalent between the two groups as well. Importantly, CYP was well tolerated with no serious adverse effects . Conclusions: For the first time, we have shown that CYP is capable of salvaging STresistant AMR with excellent functional outcomes and minimal morbidity. Its eventual role in relation with anti-CD20 therapy and splenectomy for ST-resistant AMR remains to be determined.Influence of ABO-Compatible Transplantation on Long-Term Outcome in Cardiac TransplantRecipients. Arezu Z. Aliabadi, 1 Daniela Dunkler,1   Stephane L. Mahr, 1 Matthias Paireder, 1 Martina Groemmer, 1 Gernot Seebacher, 1 Daniel Zimpfer, 1 Ernst Wolner, 1 Michael Grimm, 1 Alfred Kocher, 1 Andreas O. Zuckermann.1 1 Dept. of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Medical  University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.    Background: Cardiac transplantation is best therapeutical option for end-stage heart disease. Previous reports on the influence of the AB0 system on cardiac transplant outcome indicate that blood group identical transplants have a better outcome than blood group compatible transplants. As the demand for donor organs largely exceeds the supply, it is our policy to use blood group compatible local donors for transplantation if no suitable AB0 identical recipient is available. The aim of this study was to determine outcome after blood group compatible transplants. Patients & Methods: Between 1984-2003 a total of 915 cardiac transplants have been performed at our center. Median follow-up was 127 months. Patients were analyzed according blood group matching (AB0 identical (I) vs. AB0 compatible",

Ravikiran Barigala, 1 James Sosman, 1 Nasia Safdar.1  1  Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI. : Increasingly, patients with HIV meet indications for receiving an organ transplant. However, data on the outcomes of solid organ transplantation (SOT) in HIV infected individuals is limited. We undertook a systematic review to determine mortality, graft survival and HIV-related outcomes in patients with HIV and SOT. Methods: Multiple computerized databases for studies that reported outcomes for HIV positive patients who underwent SOT from 1981-2007. The main outcomes were graft and patient survival, HIV status (viral load or CD4 count), rejection, drug interactions and opportunistic infection. Results: 479 patients met inclusion criteria. 220 (46%) underwent kidney transplantation, 256 (53%) patients received a liver transplant, 2 heart transplants and 1 kidney-pancreas transplant. For patients that received kidney transplantation,most were on highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) before transplant and the 94 patients for whom this data was provided had no detectable viral load. The graft survival was 75.5% (166/220) and the overall patient survival was 78% (172/220) at a mean followup time of 27 months. The mean absolute CD4 count decreased by 235.56 cells/mm3 after transplant. The proportion of pts with absolute CD4 cell count >200 also decreased from 100% to 54%. No major increase in HIV viral load was seen following SOT. An increase in incidence of new/recurrence of opportunistic infection before and after SOT was not seen. Rejection was noted in 35% of patients at 27 mos mean f/u. For patients that received liver transplantation, 77% were on HAART pre-transplant. For the studies reporting this data, the graft survival was 78.4% (51/66) and the overall survival was 70% (179/256) at at 22.9 m mean f/u. The HIV viral load was undetectable by any method in 87.1% (115/132) post-transplant. Increase in incidence For both kidney and liver transplants, significant drug interactions were noted in 60 % of studies but data on the impact of these interactions was limited. Conclusions: HIV positive patients undergoing SOT have favorable graft and survival outcomes similar to HIV negative patients reported in the literature. Further research is necessary to determine the impact of drug interactions and the epidemiology of opportunistic infections following SOT.Impact of Delayed Graft Function on Graft and PatientOutcomes: A Meta Analysis. Sri G. Yarlagadda, 1 Steven G. Coca, 1 Chirag R. Parikh. 1Medicine/Nephrology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT. : Delayed Graft Function (DGF) is a frequent complication of renal transplantation. The long term impact of DGF on graft survival in the published literature is controversial with varying outcomes for patient and graft survival. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to precisely estimate the impact of DGF on graft and patient outcomes. Methods: We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for original studies published through March 2007 pertaining to long-term (> 6 months) outcomes of DGF. The primary outcome was graft survival. Secondary outcomes were patient survival and long-term kidney function. Weighted mean differences (WMD) for outcomes with continuous variables and relative risks (RR) for dichotomous outcomes were pooled from individual studies. Results: Our search yielded 51 studies on prognosis (graft survival =35, patient survival =9, kidney function=13). Compared to patients without DGF, patients with DGF had an increased risk of graft loss)] on long-term follow-up of > 6 months. The RR of graft loss persisted in studies with longer follow-up (>4 years). When studies that clearly excluded acute rejection after transplant in the DGF group were pooled, the RR of graft loss increased to 2.11 (95 % CI 1.75-2.54) There was no significant effect of DGF on patient survival at 1 year [RR=1.06 (95% CI 0.94-1.2)]. Patients with DGF experienced an increase in serum creatinine at 1 year of 0.65 mg/dl (95% CI 0.5-0.7) compared to patients without DGF. Conclusions: DGF results in inferior graft function at 1 year and increases graft loss by 63%. Patient survival appears to be unchanged at one year but longer term studies are needed. Efforts on preventing and treating DGF should be aggressively investigated in order to improve graft survival in an era with a deficit in the number of kidney donors.Utility of Urinary Biomarkers in PredictingLong-Term Allograft Function Following Renal Transplantation.

Magali Giral,1  Yohann Foucher, 1 Jean Pierre Daures, 2 Jean Paul Soulillou.1 1 Kidney Transplantation, ITERT CHU, Nantes,  France; 2 Statistics, IURC, Montpellier, France.    . Cox regression is currently the most commonly used analysis to assess the impact of covariates on graft survival. It allows to study the effect of each independent covariate (age, sex etc.) on the speed to jump directly from a initial state (the transplantation) to graft failure and death which are generaly pooled as a unique final event. Here, we compared the results of a Cox analysis with a new approach using a semi-markov multistate analysis that can differentiate the role of each covariate on several competitive states of outcome. Patients and methods :We prospectively studied 839 first kidney adult transplant patients between 1996 and 2006. We defined 3 competitive states of outcome from the initial transplantation event: 1) a graft deterioration state defined by the loss of at least 30% of MDRD clearance compared with the entry level, 2) graft failure state and 3) death. For an initial validation of the semi markov model in kidney transplantation, we only chose 7 well defined covariates (donor and recipient age, sex, cold ischemia time, DGF, anti T PRA, HLA incompatibilities and induction therapy (ATG vs anti IL2R)).Results : The Cox model showed that only 2 covariates are risk factors of graft failure : 1) DGF (RR 1.72) and 2) recipient age (RR 2.89) in the restricted case of donors older than 55 years. However interestingly, the semi markov analysis showed that all 7 chosen covariates influence graft outcome, some on the probability and others on the speed to jump from one state to another. For instance, female recipients receiving a kidney >= 55 years, treated with an anti RIL2 receptor induction therapy and with a DGF >= 6 days, represent the worst association to jump frequently and rapidly from the initial state to the state of graft deterioration (loss of >= 30% of their graft function). Moreover, when patients reach this first state of gravity, a high level of PRA >=25% or of HLA inc. >= 4 accelerates graft failure. Finally, the model shows that male recipients with a DGF >= 6 days die the quickest, all characteristics ignored by the Cox model. Conclusion : We show, for the first time, that it is possible to better describe the role of the covariates on several stages of graft outcome. This could help to make physicians aware of \"at risk population\" in whom graft function deterioration could be predicted before irreversible graft loss or death. * DIVAT: Computerized and Validated Data in Transplantation.Regional Changes in Kidney Transplantation Outcomes across the United States over Time.Harini Chakkera, 1 Ann O'Hare, 2 Glenn Chertow,3 William Amend, 4 Thomas Gonwa. 5 1 Mayo Clinic, AZ; 2 University of Washington; 3 Stanford; 4 UCSF; 5 Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville. : Clinical outcomes after kidney transplantation in the US have improved considerably over time. However, the degree to which such improvements have occurred uniformly across the country is unknown. Methods: Using the USRDS database, we examined 1 and 3 year allograft survival across UNOS regions during three different time periods. Era1: CsA use:-1/1/1988 to 1/1/1990 (n= 13,669). Era 2: Introduction of tacrolimus and MMF:-1/1/1994 to1/1/1996 (n= 17,456). Era 3: Widespread use of tacrolimus and MMF:-1/1/1998 to1/1/ 2000 (n = 20,375). Results: Overall graft survival improved from 80.5% to 90.6% (1 year) and 69.4% to 81.8% (3 year) between Eras 1 and 3 respectively. Multivariate models of regional effects for both 1 and 3 year graft survival demonstrated modest regional differences in transplant outcomes that diminished over time. Odds ratio (95% CI)* Odds ratio (95% CI)* Odds ratio (95% CI)* Conclusions: From 1988 to 2000, the 1 and 3 year graft survival improved substantially in all regions, and regional variations, which were modest to begin with, diminished over time.Transplantation Improves Survival for ESRD Patients across the Body Mass Index Spectrum. Amy L. Friedman, 1 Eli A. Friedman, 2 Jeanne Macrae, 2 Paul Eggers. 3 1 Surgery, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY; 2 Medicine, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY;3 NIDDK, Bethesda, MD. is well known that morbid obesity increases the risk of morbidity and mortality following kidney transplantation. Yet, it has been unclear whether the individual morbidly obese patient is more likely to enjoy prolonged survival with transplantation vs dialysis. To answer this question, we searched the United States Renal Data System files for all persons waitlisted from 1996 through 2004, by initial BMI category, to determine the effect of sex, age, race, diabetes and transplant on survival.During the study period 109,474 persons were waitlisted. One year and seven year survival was 95.7 % and 55.2 % for dialysis versus 95.6 % and 77.9 % for transplant. Obesity (BMI > 29) was present in 14% of waitlisted persons and in 25 % of those transplanted. BMI >39 was present in 4.1 % of waitlisted and in 7.3 % of transplanted persons and BMI was 50 + in 644 (.59 %) waitlisted and 265 (.43 %) transplanted patients. Obesity is common among ESRD patients placed on the waitlist. In all BMI categories, transplantation affords a statistically significant survival advantage compared to dialysis. Although few transplants are performed in the US for patients with BMI of 50+, outcomes are equivalent to those for leaner patient cohorts. Increased BMI should not be considered an absolute contraindication to kidney transplantation.Most Cases of Kidney Graft Failure Are Due to an Identifiable Cause andNot Chronic Allograft Nephropathy (CAN). Ziad M. El-Zoghby, Donna J. Lager, Hatem Amer, James M. Gloor, Mark D. Stegall, Fernando G. Cosio. William von Liebig Transplant Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.Background: Death censored kidney graft loss is commonly attributed to CAN now called fibrosis/atrophy (IF/TA) and not assigned to a specific etiology. The goal of this study was to assess the specific causes of graft loss in the last decade. Methods: Included are 1317 conventional kidney grafts recipients transplanted between 1/1/96 and 7/1/06. Clinical and histologic data were reviewed to determine the cause of graft loss. When the information was not conclusive, biopsies were reviewed and additional histologic studies (C4d and/or BK staining) were done. Results: Mean patient age was 48.7\u00b117 years; 60% were male and 73% were living donor recipients. During a median follow up of 50.3 months (range: 0-138), 136 patients died (10%) and 182 allografts were lost (14%) not due to patient death. Allograft histology was available in 180 of the 182 allografts that failed. The median time from last biopsy to graft loss was 3.6 months (range: 0-104). 70 allografts were lost during the first year, 82 between years 1-5 and 30 beyond 5 years. Causes of graft loss are summarized in theTable.In 95% of cases a specific cause of graft loss was identifiable. Death with function was the single most common cause of graft loss. The most frequent histologic lesions in the failed graft were glomerular, particularly recurrent disease and transplant glomerulopathy (TG). In patients with IF/TA a cause was identified in 79%, most commonly secondary to BK nephropathy and recurrent acute rejections. Primary non-function was the 4th most common cause of graft loss and included vascular thrombosis, medical complications and poor allograft quality. Twelve of the 18 cases of acute rejection occurred after the first year. Medical causes included graft loss secondary to severe medical conditions, e.g. sepsis and recurrent non-glomerular diseases.Conclusions:In most cases kidney graft failure can be attributed to a specific cause defined by clinical and histologic criteria. A high proportion of death-censored graft failures (30%) are due to glomerular pathology. Among these, TG and recurrent disease are the most common causes of kidney graft failure.Seventeen Years of Experience Using Kidneys from HCV Positive Donors into HCV Positive Recipients: A Safe Policy To Expand the Donor Pool.Beatriz Dom\u00ednguez-Gil, 1 Nuria Esforzado, 2 Maria I.

Life after Tx Introduction The expanding waiting time to kidney transplantation has significantly increased mortality for transplant candidates. In particular, frailer candidates are at growing risk for not surviving the interval at which they would receive a transplant. While this trend is recognized, data concerning the actual likelihood of receiving a transplant for the overall population and by certain patient characteristics are not widely available yet may provide critical information to transplant candidates and their caregivers.MethodsThe study examined adult solitary renal transplant candidates from 1995-2006 from the national SRTR database. Parametric survival models were utilized to estimate time to receiving a deceased donor transplant and time to death prior to transplantation based on known factors for individual candidates. The proportion of patients with a shorter expected time to death as compared to time to transplant was calculated and compared among subgroups. Results Among all adult candidates, the proportion of patients with shorter life expectancy than expected time to transplant increased from 4% to 30% from 1995-2006. As expected, these proportions were significantly higher in older candidates (age at listing > 60) and varied substantially by blood type, PRA and primary diagnosis. Overall in 2006, over 52% of older candidates were expected to die prior to receiving a deceased donor transplant (Figure 1).ConclusionsThis tangible data should be disseminated to patients, especially higher-risk transplant candidates, to help illustrate the incentives for seeking living donors and allow for informed decision-making.Dual-Kidney Transplants as an Alternative for Very Marginal Donors: Long-Term Follow-Up in 63 Patients.

Feng, 3 D. C. Brennan.4 1 Research Triangle  Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC; 2 St. Louis University, St. Louis, MO;    Introduction: Previously, a predictive nomogram for DGF risk was developed using USRDS registry data(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998) (Irish et al., JASN 2003). Given the changing landscape since the institution of a new kidney allocation policy in 2001, we aimed to refine the previously published model using more recent data. We addressed criticisms of the original model by excluding multiple-organ transplants, preemptive transplants, and organs with pulsatile preservation, while including additional risk factors of warm ischemia time (WIT), dialysis duration, donor weight, and recipient body mass index (BMI) in the updated analysis. Methods: UNOS data on adult, solitary, non-preemptive, non-machine perfused, deceased donor renal transplants(2003)(2004)(2005) were obtained. Grafts lost within the first 24 hours (n=245) or missing a DGF code (n=1) were excluded from further analysis. A multivariable logistic regression model was fit to the data for the remaining 18,276 patients. The model was validated using a dataset of patients transplanted in 2006 (n=3601). An updated nomogram quantifying the relative contribution of each risk factor was created. Results: DGF incidence (25.8%) in the current era did not significantly differ from the previous report (23.7%). Although the relative impact of most risk factors remained consistent, the weight of peak PRA and previous transplant was significantly attenuated, while the impact of donor terminal serum creatinine was enhanced by approximately 2-fold. Using the nomogram below, DGF risk can be calculated by adding points associated with each continuous and categorical risk factor. A score of 270 for example, would correlate to approximately a 50% risk of developing DGF.Overall accuracy of the updated model was 70.4%.Conclusions:The updated nomogram provides a tool for developing a pre-transplant index of DGF likelihood in the current era of kidney transplantation. With the availability of this index, more informed treatment decisions can be made.Transplantation of Older Patients Does Not Improve Survival Comparedwith Those Wait Listed. Analysis of 9,700 Wait Listed Patients in the UK. David Ansell, 1 John O'Neil, 2 Rachel Johnson, 2 David Collett, 2 Chris Dudley.1 1 UK Renal Registry, Bristol, United Kingdom; 2 UK Tranplant,  Bristol, United Kingdom.    survival benefit of receiving a kidney transplant over remaining on the waiting list is often quoted from the American study by Wolfe. Recent USA papers have also supported a survival benefit in the over 65s. In Europe survival on dialysis is better than the USA across all age bands and survival benefit of transplantation may not be as great. Using the same statistical methodology as Wolfe, we have calculated the time to survival benefit by age group in the UK, for patients receiving a deceased donor (DD) kidney transplantation over those remaining on the waiting list. Methods: 9739 adult patients listed for a DD first kidney only transplant in the UK, 1995-2000, were analyzed. Patients were followed from date of listing to Sept 2005 or death. Of the patients analyzed, 6819 received a DD transplant. Cox regression was used to analyze the combined effect of age, ethnicity, diagnosis, waiting time and time to be put on the waiting list on patient survival and also to evaluate the time to equal risk, equal survival, life years gained by transplantation for different age groups. We also examined the effect of periods of suspension from the waiting list (as a surrogate marker for comorbidity) on the survival benefit. Results: Transplantation was of most benefit to younger patients with risk of death at the time of transplant increasing with age, resulting in increasing time to equal risk and equal survival with increasing age. In contrast to the USA, UK patients aged over 65 years receiving a renal transplant did not show a significant survival benefit.The survival benefit after receiving a DD transplant was similar for whites, south Asians and Blacks with no reduced relative benefit seen in ethnic minority groups who have better dialysis survival. Summary: In the UK patients aged over 65 years receiving a renal transplant did not show a significant survival benefit. As well as age, the survival benefit of transplantation varied by primary diagnosis and time spent suspended.The Effect of DonorNet on Allocation Efficiency of Exported Organs.Dorry L.

Shin Hwang, Sung-Gyu Lee, Chul-Soo Ahn, Ki-Hun Kim, Deok-Bog Moon, Tae-Yong Ha, Gi-Won Song, Kwang-Min Park. Department of Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan, Seoul, Korea. outcomes of first 1000 adult recipients undergoing living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) in a single center from February 1997 to January 2006 were retrospectively analyzed. Recipient mean age was 47.9+/-8.6 years. Major primary diagnoses included hepatitis B virus-associated cirrhosis (n=845), acute liver failure (n=56), hepatitis C virus-associated cirrhosis (n=33) and alcoholic liver disease (n=30). Primary liver malignancy was detected in 300 patients. Graft types were right liver grafts (n=651), left liver grafts (n=176) and dual liver grafts (n=173). Most right lobe grafts had middle hepatic vein outflow pathway through reconstructed or native vessel trunk. Median graft-to-recipient weight ratio was 0.97. Retransplantation was performed in 9. Overall 1-year, 3-year and 5-year patient survival rates were 89.3%, 84.7% and 82.9%, respectively. Five-year patient survival rate was 73.8% and 87.1% in patients with and without hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. The most common causes of patient mortality and morbidity were hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence and biliary complication, respectively. Five-year hepatitis B virus reinfection rate was 7.3% after high-dose hepatitis B immunoglobulin monotherapy combined with rescue antiviral therapy. Overall perioperative recipient mortality rate within first 3 months was 5.8%, whereas perioperative mortality rates in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th 200 cases were 12%, 6%, 5.5%, 3% and 2.5%, respectively. A total number of 1175 living donors recovered without sequelae except 1 case of renal failure requiring kidney transplantation. The most important point of donor selection criteria for right liver harvest was preservation of at least 30% of the whole liver mass with full preservation of hepatic venous drainage. In conclusion, the perioperative mortality rate decreased much according to the accumulation of surgical experience. Prudent selection of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma appears to be critical to achieve favorable long-term survival.Biliary complication was not overcome by technical refinement and remains as the most serious drawback of adult LDLT leading to deterioration of quality of life.Preliminary Experience on Living Donor Exchange Program for Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation at the Asan Medical Center, Korea.Deok-Bog Moon, 1 Sung-Gyu Lee, 1 Shin Hwang, 1 Ki-Hun Kim, 1 Tae-Yong Ha, 1 Gi-Won Song, 1 Dong-Hwan Jung.1  1 Division of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Department of Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. : When performing donor screening for living donor liver transplantation (LDLT)for an adult patient with end-stage liver disease, ABO blood group incompatibility is the most common cause of donor exclusion. To cope with this problem without performing ABO-incompatible LDLT, living donor exchange program has been maintained at the Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea since September 2003. Here we introduce the 8 cases of adult LDLT allocated by living donor exchange program. Methods: From February, 1997 to December 2006. 1221 cases of adult LDLT were performed in our institution. Among them, there were 8 cases allocating through donor exchange program to avoid ABO mismatching. Four sets of 2 donor-recipient combination pairs were made after direct one-to-one donor-recipient matching. Results: Three sets of donor exchange LDLT were performed on elective basis, but one in emergency situation. Three living donors and 3 recipients underwent LDLT operations at the same time at the same institution. All 8 living donors recovered well. All of the 8 recipients are doing well to date although 1 recipient had undergone prolonged intensive care for surgical complications. There was no conflict related to donor exchange program. Conclusions: This is the world-first report on donor exchange adult LDLT. Although this is a preliminary report with only 4 sets, donor exchange program for adult LDLT appears to be a feasible modality to promote LDLT. We believe it can be applicable to a wider population of LDLT after widespread consensus formation.Split Liver Transplantation: 10 Years Experience at a High VolumeCenter.

Even after excluding the donor expenditure, recipient hospitalization cost of DDLT remain significantly higher secondary to increased incidence of perioperative cardiac, pulmonary, renal complications and re-explorations for bleeding. Incidence of biliary stricture was higher in the LDLT recipients post-transplant (12 in LDLT vs 6 in DDLT).

Conclusions -Our results indicate that DGF leads to an average of $20,000 in additional cost the first year after transplant. Donor type does not play a role in these additional costs, unlike graft failure which overrides the cost of DGF. However, due to the various rates of DGF in the different donor types, costs difference between the donor types could be confounded by DGF. This research estimates the changes in Medicare's net cash flow that would have occurred in the years following 2000 if Medicare had extended its lifetime coverage of mainentance immunosuppression medications to all kidney transplant recipients. Providing lifetime coverage may create a cash outflow increase determined by the cost of the medications and the numbers of transplant recipients whose coverage would not have been cancelled. Lifetime coverage, however, may reduce cash outflows because fewer patients would have lost their transplanted kidney and therefore would not have incurred the expenses of returning to the dialysis. The net impact of these competing effects is unclear.

Since the inception of the MELD-based system for deceased donor liver allocation in the U.S. in 2002, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can receive extra priority (exception points) for transplant. In order to receive the extra priority, the OPTN requires transplant centers to submit justification data (tumor size, number, ablation data, etc.) for each HCC candidate. Candidates who receive ablation therapy (AT) continue to receive priority even though their tumor sizes may no longer meet the criteria necessary for the exception. We questioned whether HCC recipients receiving AT had better post-transplant outcomes than HCC recipients not receiving AT. Methods. Based on OPTN justification data, we identified 1782 adult liver transplants statistically significant reduced risk of graft failure. Conclusions. AT appears to improve significantly the post-transplant graft survival rates among recipients with HCC. The use of TACE or RFA is responsible for the majority of this effect. Further analyses are necessary to determine how much of this effect is attributable to the therapy itself and how much is due to careful patient selection.",

Methods: From 1999 to 2007, 1002 transplants were performed within our RDP protocol with a 3-month minimum follow-up. IS consisted of induction with polyclonal antibody, a six day prednisone taper, and dual agent maintenance with a CNI and MMF or SRL.A multivariate analysis (MVA) using Cox regression identified risk factors for AR and GL. Factors included for the analysis were: donor source (LD vs. DD), first vs. retx, 3-6 vs. 0-3 HLA MM, gender (F vs. M), AA vs. non-AA race, pre-tx type 1 DM (Y vs. N), age <18 vs. 18-50, age >50 vs. 18-50, DGF (Y vs. N), and PRA >50 vs. <50. Additional factors considered for GL were: -DGF/+AR vs. -DGF/-AR, +DGF/-AR vs. -DGF/-AR, and +DGF/+AR vs. -DGF/-AR. Results: By MVA, significant risk factors for AR included: retx (vs. primary) (p<.001), AA race (vs. non-AA) (p<.05), age 18-50 (vs. >50) (p<.0001) and PRA >50 (vs. <50) (p.0027).Risk factors for GL included: pre-tx T1 DM (p<.01), \u2265 1 AR episode (p<.0001) and DGF (p<.0001).

Transplant Unit, Erie County Medical Center, SUNY, Buffalo, NY.    : The impact of steroid free maintenance immunosuppression on chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) is unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the progression of CAN using Chronic Allograft Damage Index (CADI score) in renal transplant recipients (RTR), given no maintenance prednisone. Methods: We retrospectively studied 89 RTR from Sep 2004 to Sep 2006. All patients were induced with 2 doses of Alemtuzumab. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus with the target trough level of 5-8 ng/ml and mycophenolate sodium with a maximum dose of 720 mg BID.GFR(MDRD) was measured at 3,6, 9,12 and 24 months with surveillance biopsies(bxs) scheduled at 3, 12 and 24 months. Patients were divided into low grade (CADI < 4) and high grade (CADI\u2265 4) groups.Clinical rejection was defined as biopsy(bx)proven rejection with increase in serum creatinine and subclinical rejection as bx evidence with no decline in renal function. Results: No rejection was noted in 62 patients. Out of these, 60(97%) had a CADI score <4 at 3 month bx and only 2 (3%) had a CADI \u22654. At 12 month bx, 56 out 60 (90%) had a CADI still <4, and 6 (10%) had a CADI \u22654. More than 90% of all bxs at 3 and 12 months showed a CADI <2. To date,16 patients have had the 24 month bx and only 1 showed increased injury score as compared to 12 month. No difference was noted between mean GFR (ml/min/1.Eight of 27 remaining RTR showed subclinical rejection on first or second bx. Seven of these patients had a CADI <4 at first bx and 1 had a CADI \u22654. At 12 months, 6 of these continued to have a CADI <4.One progressed from a low to higher CADI score at 12 months. The patient who had a CADI \u22654 continued to exhibit this level of injury at 12 months. The final 19 RTR were excluded due to the effect of their clinical rejection on CADI score. Conclusion: Alemtuzumab induced steroid free, low dose calcineurin maintenance immunosuppression regimen exhibits no significant progression of CAN as assessed by CADI scored bxs up to 24 months post transplant. This study suggests that quantitatively assessed surveillance bxs should help determine the risk-benefit ratio of steroid free maintenance immunosuppression regimens.Randomized, Prospective Prednisone (P) Withdrawal Trial in KidneyTransplant Patients Treated with Sirolimus (S) vs. Microemulsified Cyclosporine (CsA) Based Regimens.

Gloor.1 1 William J von  Liebig Transplant Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.    : Previous studies showed that the risk of developing TG is strongly associated with anti-HLA class II antibodies (HLA-IIAb), particularly when those antibodies (Ab) have donor specificity (DSA). The goal of this study was to assess whether the characteristics of HLA-IIAb relate to the incidence and prognosis of TG. Methods: HLA-IIAb were measured in pre-transplant sera of 598 kidney transplant recipients with a negative cytotoxic crossmatch at the time of transplantation. Single HLA antigen-coated flow beads were used to determine: 1) presence of HLA-IAb and/ or HLA-IIAb; 2) Ab normalized ratio (NR, a measure of antibody activity); 3) DSA; 4) HLA-IIAb subclass. All patients had protocol biopsies at one year and as clinically indicated. TG was diagnosed by protocol or clinical biopsies. Results: Among the 598 patients, 235 (40%) had detectable HLA-Ab: HLA-IAb (12%), HLA-IIAb (11%) and both (17%). Seventy three patients (12%) developed TG within Abstracts was 1082 days (81 -2777 days). Wound complications (<3 months) after KTx were categorized using standard CDC criteria. The risks factors analyzed included: age, body mass index (BMI), diabetes (DM), number of pre-and post-KTx PP treatments, rituximab, high dose IVIG (2mg/kg) and acute humoral rejection (AHR). rATG induction therapy, tacrolimus, MMF and prednisone maintenance regimens and selective plasmapheresis (PP) for high levels of alloantibody were utilized in our patients. Data were compared using the Fisher's exact and Chi-square tests. Results. The overall incidence of wound complications was 34.5% (23% superficial, 9% deep and 8% organ space) compared to 7% in our conventional transplants. Risk factors which achieved statistical significance with respect to superficial wound infection were BMI>30, DM and the use of high dose IVIG. Deep wound infection was significantly related BMI >30, DM, and development of AHR. Incisional hernia was statistically more likely for patients who received > 16 PP treatments.Conclusions. +XM KTx recipients have a higher rate of wound complications than conventional transplants. While common risk factors prevail (DM and obesity), the development of AHR and prolonged PP significantly increased the incidence of wound complications. A lower wound complication rate in patients without AHR suggests that uncomplicated +XM KTx may not be associated with higher wound complication rates.Kidney: Deceased Donor Issues IIILong Term Graft and Patient Outcomes in Highly-HLA Sensitized (HS) Deceased Donor (DD) Kidney Transplant (KT) Recipients Desensitized with High Dose (HD) IVIG.Alice Peng, 1 Ashley Vo, 1 Rafael Villicana, 1 Donald Dafoe, 1 Nancy Reinsmoen, 1 Stanley Jordan.1 1 Comprehensive  Transplant Center, Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.    : The development of desensitization protocols has allowed succeessful transplantation of crossmatch (CMX) (+) organs. Experience with desensitization of HS DD KT recipients is limited, as most centers consider desensitization for LD recipients only. Our center has extensive experience with the use of HD IVIG in DD kidney transplantation. For HS pts, recent data shows an increased acute rejection rate but acceptable 1 yr graft survival. Questions remain regarding the long-term durability of HLA-incompatible transplants, especially with increasing evidence of the negative impact of donor specific antibodies (DSA). Here, we examined the long-term graft & patient survivals for HS DD KT recipients. Patients & Methods: Between Jan 1994 and Dec 2006, 71 HS patients underwent desensitization and DD transplantation using combinations of HD IVIG and rituximab. FCMXs often remained (+) at transplant. The average PRA was 58%; 46% were retransplants. We examined the 1, 3, and 5-yr graft and patient survival rates, mean SCr of the functioning grafts, and causes of graft loss. Results: Of the 71 HS DD patients, 60 patients (88.2% death-censored graft survival) had functioning grafts at 1-yr. 8 grafts had failed, 1 was lost to follow-up (LTFU), and 2 had death with functioning grafts (DWFG). Of 27 patients with 3 yrs of follow-up, 20 patients had functioning grafts (83.3%), 4 grafts had failed, 1 was LTFU, and 2 had DWFG. At 5 yrs, 9 of 17 patients had functioning grafts (69.2%), 4 had failed, none were LTFU, and 4 had DWFG. 3 of the 4 transplants lost at 5 yrs were lost within the 1st yr of their transplant due to rejection. The 4th failed graft was lost at 15 mo due to noncompliance. The average SCr of the functioning grafts at 1, 3, and 5 yrs were 1.39 \u00b1 0.56 mg/dl, 1.29 \u00b1 0.60 mg/dl, and 1.67 \u00b1 1.26 mg/dl respectively. Patient survivals were 97.1%, 92.3%, and 76.5% at 1-, 3-, and 5-yrs respectively. Conclusions: The 1, 3, and 5-yr outcomes in our desensitized HS DD KT recipients were 88.2%, 83.3%, and 69.2%. The majority of our failed grafts were lost to early acute rejection. Late failures were due to noncompliance or DWFG. Overall, desensitization therapy with HD IVIG offers HS patients an opportunity for successful DD KT and long term graft survival.to determine if the age distribution of donors and kidney recipients affected transplant outcomes to determine whether these anecdotes are true. Methods. Comparisons of donor and recipient demographics and outcomes were performed on 22,236 deceased donor, kidney-alone transplants performed between 2002 and 2004. Recipients with any previous organ transplant were excluded. The numbers of kidneys that failed within 3 years and the number of recipients who died with a functioning graft within 3 years of transplant were tabulated. Results. There were 2,721 transplants performed in recipients aged 18-34; 6,339 ages 35-49; 9,046 ages 50-64; and 3,217 ages 65+. However, 1,363 (43.6%) of kidney transplants from pediatric donors (0-17) were performed in recipients age 50 or older, and 126 (13.1%) of kidneys from donors aged 65 or greater were transplanted into recipients between the ages of 18-49. Death with a functioning graft occurred within 3 years for 1,682 (7.6%) recipients. The majority (78%) of these deaths occurred among recipients age 50 or older (55% of the transplants); and among these older recipients, 381 (28.9%) had received kidneys from donors aged less than 34. Among the recipients aged 18-34 who received an organ from a donor over age 50, 94 (22.3%) failed within 3 years and 61 (65%) of these patients were relisted for a second transplant byNovember 30, 2007.   Conclusions. There are significant numbers of older kidneys allocated to younger recipients and younger kidneys allocated to older recipients. This does appear to be resulting in excess numbers of deaths with functioning grafts among older patients and excess early graft failures among younger recipients. These results justify the need for a revision to the current allocation system to more appropriately allocate deceased donor kidneys.Underutilization of Kidneys from Deceased Donors Older Than Age 70.Tariq Shah,1,3,4  Suphamai Bunnapradist, 2 Jagbir Gill, 2 Steven K.Takemoto. 1 1 National Institute of Transplantation, Los Angeles; 2 Medicine, UCLA; MOTC, St Vincent Medical Center, LA, CA; 4 USC Medicine & Urology, LA, CA. 2000, despite the shortage of kidneys from deceased donors for transplantation,only about 100 kidney transplants each year were performed with donors older than age 70. Kidneys from these older donors represent only 6% of those allocated in the United States as \"expanded criteria donors\". In this study, we examine how these kidneys might be optimally utilized. Methods: This retrospective examination of 9,580 recipients of expanded criteria donor (ECD) kidney-only transplants performed during 2000-2007 and reported to the Organ Procurement Transplant Network excluded those with dual and enbloc procedures. Outcomes for recipients of donors age 50-59 and \u226570 compared to a reference group of donors age 60-69 were stratified by recipient age and expressed as hazard ratios (HR) after adjusting for recipient and donor covariates using Cox proportional hazards. Results: 26% of ECD kidneys were transplanted to recipients younger than age 51, 31% to age 51-60, 18% to 61-65 and 25% to recipients older than age 65.

Tamotsu Tojimbara,1  Kazuhiro Iwadoh,1  Koji Nanmoku,1  Kotaro Kai,1  Akihito Sannomiya,1  Ichiro Koyama,1  Kazunari Tanabe, 2 Ichiro Nakajima,1  Shohei Fuchinoue, 1 Satoshi Teraoka.1 1 Surgery  III, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan; 2  Urology, Tokyo Women's Medical University. : To alleviate chronic shortage of renal graft, donation after cardiac death (DCD) donors have been accepted as the organ resources in Japan. We have used DCD donors with progressively rising creatinine (Cr) at time of nephrectomy. In this study, the outcomes of kidney transplantation (KTx) from DCD donors, according to the terminal renal function of the donors, were retrospectively analyzed.Methods: Between 1995 and 2003, 103  KTx from DCD donors were performed at our institute. Four of the 103 patients were excluded because of incomplete data. Mean Cr level of the donors at time of organ procurement was 2.4 \u00b1 2.3 mg/dl (0.06 -11.0). Mean age of the donors and recipients were 45 \u00b1 17 years and 42 \u00b1 15 years, respectively. Recipients were stratified into 3 groups according to the terminal Cr of the donors: Cr < 2.0 mg/dl (Group 1), 2.1 mg/dl < Cr < 4.0 mg/dl (Group 2), Cr > 4.1 mg/dl (Group 3); and evaluated for outcomes. The recipients were followed up for an average of 5.9 \u00b1 2.7 years postoperatively. Results: The data in each group are shown inTable.There were significant differences in donor terminal Cr, incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) and Cr level one month after KTx between the groups (Kruskal-Wallis). Overall patient survival rates at 1, 5 and 10 years were 100%, 96% and 96%, respectively. Overall graft survival rates at 1, 5 and 10 years were 91%, 88% and 77%, respectively. Graft survival rates were similar among the groups. Conclusion: Our data demonstrated that kidneys from DCD donors with a progressively rising Cr could be used safely with promising long-term outcomes.Liver: Extended Criteria Donor, DCD, ECD Impact of the Donor Risk Index in the Outcome of HCV+ Liver Transplant Recipients. Daniel G. Maluf, 1 Erick B. Edwards, 2 Todd R. Stravitz, 1 Myron H. Kauffman. 2 1 Hume Lee Transplant Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA; 2 United Network for Organ Sharing, Richmond, VA. : The use of extended criteria donors (ECD) is widely accepted across the USA. We have investigated the impact of ECD liver allografts on the outcome of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients undergoing LTx. Methods: An analysis of 9901 liver transplant recipients / donors was performed from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database transplanted between June, 2002 and June, 2006. The Donor Risk Index (DRI) was calculated as described by Feng, et al. MELD exceptions were excluded from the analysis. Relative risk (RR) estimates of patient and graft loss were derived from Cox regression models. Results: Recipients were 75.9% Caucasian, 67.3 % male, 52 years old (median), and mean follow-up time was 712 days (range: 0 -1906).Based on hepatitis C serology, 44.6 % (n= 4414) of LTx recipients were HCV(+). The median DRI was 1.3 (range: 0.77 to 4.27). Increasing DRI was associated with a statistically significant increase in the relative risk of graft failure and patient death for both HCV(+) and HCV(-) recipients as showed. However, HCV(+) recipients demonstrated a much greater increase in RR of patient and graft loss as a function of the DRI than HCV(-) subjects, even after adjustment for recipient MELD, age, gender, ethnicity, year of transplant, diabetes, dialysis, portal vein thrombosis, previous abdominal surgery, and previous malignancy (p= 0.001).Moreover, graft and patient survival rates were also negatively affected by the interaction between DRI and HCV serology (p= 0.001) Conclusion: An additive, if not synergistic, adverse interaction between donor DRI and recipient HCV status exists, suggesting that HCV infected patients should not receive liver grafts from higher DRI donors.Utilization, Outcomes, and Retransplantation of Liver Allografts from Donation after Cardiac Death: Implications for Further Expansion of the Cadaver Donor Pool. Frederic W. Selck, 1 Eric B. Grossman, 1 Lloyd E. Ratner, 2 John F. Renz.2 1 New York Organ Donor Network, New York, NY;   College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY.    OBJECTIVE: Donation after cardiac death (DCD) for liver transplantation (LTX) has significant potential but application remains infrequent. This investigation examines DCD utilization, outcomes, and retransplantation to identify mechanisms to optimize DCD application. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database from 01/02 through 04/07 identified 845 DCD and 21,441 non-DCD adult, initial, whole-organ, liver-only LTX. Demographic and physiologic (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease [MELD]) data were compared. Outcome measures were graft survival determined as death or retransplantation and listing for retransplantation within one-year post-LTX. RESULTS: DCD donors were younger (p<0.001), with fewer African-American and non-caucasian race (p<0.001), and fewer deaths secondary to stroke (p <0.001). DCD recipients were older (p<0.001), with lower MELD (p<0.001), and less likely in ICU (p=0.02) or high-urgency status (p<0.001). DCD allografts were more frequently imported from another allocation region (12% vs 7% [p<0.001]). Cox regression analysis of time to DCD graft failure demonstrates higher DCD graft failure within the first 180 days (20.5% DCD vs 11.5% non-DCD, [p<0.001])",

No difference was found in the survival rate of patients who received grafts from donors > 60 years old compared to those who received grafts from younger donors. However, 37% of patients with donor grafts > 60 years old underwent retransplantation and the incidence of bile duct complications in this group was 50%.Background:The relationship between allograft quality and recipient risk status was investigated in relation to patient survival 1 year after liver transplantation. Data: The classification for deceased donor livers and patients on the liver transplant list was derived from a cohort of 723 first adult elective liver only transplants performed in the UK 2000-2001, using livers from deceased heartbeating donors. A similar cohort of 1,615 liver transplants performed between 2002-2006 was then analysed to determine whether the survival of liver recipients depends on the matching of allograft quality to recipient risk status. Results: An iterative technique using logistic regression was applied to the 2000-2001 cohort to investigate several donor and recipient factors which allowed us to define poor vs good quality allografts and high vs low risk patients. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survivor functions obtained from analysing the 2002-2006 cohort revealed differences between the 4 groups (p=0.08). The worst outcome was observed when poor quality allografts were transplanted to high risk recipients (86% survival). Low risk recipients who received poor quality allografts had poorer survival (89%) than either high risk or low risk recipients of good quality allografts (91% survival in both groups). A Cox regression analysis was then performed to assess the combined effect of liver quality and cold ischaemia time (CIT) on patient death within 1 year post-transplant. The analysis showed that although poor quality livers were associated with significantly worse patient survival than good quality livers, the difference could be explained by the inferior survival associated with the poor quality livers with long CITs (>12hrs). Patients who receive poor quality livers with CITs \u226412 hours have comparable survival to those who receive good quality livers. A comparison of the K-M survivor functions for the poor quality long CIT group (85% survival) and the group containing all other livers (90% survival) revealed a statistically significant difference (p=0.02). Conclusion: Allograft quality allied with CIT is of prime importance in determining the outcome of patients following liver transplantation. Poor quality allografts with CIT >12hrs are associated with the lowest patient survival one year after transplantation. Current policy of matching poor quality allografts to low risk patients is justified if the CITs can be kept below 12hrs.",

Results SRL was used as initial IS in 232/1554 (14.9%) OLT pts (81.5% SRL/CYA, 15.9% SRL/ FK, 2.6% SRL/MMF). 13/232 (5.6%) used aortic conduits for hepatic artery inflow. During the study period, initial SRL dose was reduced from 5mg(1998)(1999) to 2mg(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007) aiming for serum drug levels of 4-10ng/ml. 8/232 (3.4%) SRL pts had HAT vs 6.8% in non-SRL controls (p=0.31). Only 3/232 (1.3%) SRL pts developed HAT while actually on SRL (5/232 pts had late HAT, mean 322d post OLT, when SRL had been d/c prior for various reasons). All 3 HAT occurred prior to Jan 1999, and no HAT have occurred in last 207 pts treated with initial SRL. Hepatic artery stenosis (HAS) was 5.6% vs 12.7% (p=0.02) in SRL pts vs non-SRL controls. Patient survival with SRL was similar to non-SRL (84% vs 80% 3-yr pt survival p=0.13). However graft survival was improved in those pts using SRL (82% vs 75% 3-yr graft survival, p=0.01)ConclusionIn contrast to the FDA warning, our experience shows that using sirolimus as initial immunosuppression in OLT pts does not increase HAT or patient mortality, and results in lower HAS rates and improved graft survival. Since these FDA warnings affect drug insurance/medicare coverage, new trials should be performed to reassess the validity of this FDA warning for using sirolimus in liver transplantation.Impact of Sirolimus on HCV Recurrence Rates after LiverTransplantation. Sonal Asthana, 1 Christian Toso, 1 Glenda Meeberg, 1 Toshiyasu Kawahara, 1 David Bigam, 1 A. J. Shapiro, 1 Andrew Mason, 1 Norman Kneteman. 1 1 Multiorgan Transplant Unit, University of Alberta Hospital, Edmonton, AB, Canada.Background: Liver transplantation for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced cirrhosis is associated by high rates of post-transplant HCV recurrence. Several factors have been shown to predict recurrence, but there is limted data about the impact of sirolimus (SRL) on post-transplant HCV. Two cases have been reported, who cleared serum HCV RNA without antiviral treatment after conversion to sirolimus(Somanakis et al.  J Hepatol 2005). The present cohort study specifically addressed the impact of SRL therapy on HCV recurrence. Methods: All patients undergoing first liver transplant between January1998 (when the first HCV patient was treated with SRL) to December 2006 were studied. Data was collected on a number of variables including transplant era, donor and recipient ages, MELD, cold ischemia time, immunosuppressive drugs, steroid-treated rejection. Biopsy-proven HCV recurrence was the primary outcome studied. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square and 't' tests as appropriate, while survival anf multivariate analysis was carried out using the Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards model. Results: 157 patients were transplanted for HCV in this period Among them, 97 patients received SRL, including 39 with hepatocellular carcinoma Patients with or without sirolimus immunosuppression had similar characteristics, including MELD, recipient and donor ages, duration of follow-up. On Kaplan-Meier univariate analysis, patients on sirolimus therapy demonstrated a trend towards more recurrence, but this was statistically not significant (5 years: 70% with SRL vs 54% without, log-rank: p=NS). Patient survival rates were comparable (5 years: 72% with SRL vs 74% with no SRL, log-rank: p=NS). On multivariate Cox analysis no parameter reached significance in predicting HCV recurrence. A high MELD score (p=0.03), steroid-treated rejection (p=0.02) and tacrolimus therapy (p=0.03) were associated with worse patient survival. Conclusion: While stronger prospective studies are still required, this cohort data suggest that SRL does not significantly impact on post-transplant HCV recurrence.Calcineurin Inhibitor-FreeImmunosuppressive Protocol with Everolimus Monotherapy in De Novo Liver Transplantation.

Martinez.1 1 Surgery Division of Transplantation, Stanford  University, Stanford, CA.    and Aims: Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is associated with multiple human malignancies including post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) B cell lymphomas. LMP1 is an EBV-encoded protein expressed in PTLD tumors that can drive tumor growth through constitutive activation of NF\u03baB, Erk, p38, Akt and JNK. We have shown that EBV + B cell lines from PTLD patients express LMP1 and have a constitutively active Jak/STAT pathway. Here we determine the role of the viral protein LMP1 in STAT activation. Methods: Direct interaction of LMP1 with JAK3 was analyzed by immunoprecipitation of PTLD cell line lysates with anti-LMP1 antibody and Western blotting for JAK3. NGFR-LMP1 chimeric proteins were expressed in the EBV -Burkitt's lymphoma cell line BL41 to permit inducible LMP1 signaling. Gel shift assays were performed with whole cell extracts from NGFR-LMP1 BL41 cells after 0-24h of LMP1 activation. Additionally lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting was performed with pSTAT1, STAT1, pSTAT3 and STAT3 antibodies. Cytokine secretion was assayed by pan-cytokine luminex kit and ELISA. IFN\u03b3R1 and IFN\u03b3 specific antibodies were used to block IFN\u03b3 signaling in cells prior to pSTAT1/STAT1 WB. Results: Although JAK3 could associate with the common \u03b3 chain in EBV + B cell lines derived from PTLD tumors and in the BL41 B cell lymphoma line transformed with the B95.8 strain of EBV, no interaction of LMP1 with JAK3 was observed. STAT/ DNA complexes were detected in NGFR-LMP1 BL41 clones after 24 hours of LMP1 signaling but not after 20-30 min, suggesting that STAT activation is indirect. STAT1 was the predominant STAT activated by LMP1. Inhibition of cytokine secretion with brefeldin A prior to LMP1 activation abolished STAT binding indicating that a secreted protein is responsible for STAT activation. IFNs are known inducers of the STAT pathway and pan-cytokine luminex assay revealed that LMP1 can induce IFN\u03b3 but not IFN\u03b1. Moreover, IFN\u03b3 receptor blockade prior to LMP1 activation dramatically decreased STAT1 activation. Conclusion: Together, these data demonstrate that LMP1 does not activate the Jak/ STAT pathway through direct interaction with JAK3 but rather through an indirect pathway involving IFN\u03b3 induction. Thus the oncogenic protein LMP1 of EBV usurps cellular cytokine pathways to augment tumor growth. Understanding the viral-host cell interactions that promote tumorigenesis will aide in development of novel strategies for treatment of PTLD.",

Anna Valujskikh,1  Marion Rabant,1  Victoria Gorbacheva.1    Immunology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH. . It is generally believed that CD40 signaling is essential for immunoglobulin class switching in response to T-dependent antigens. Our previous findings in a model of murine heart allograft rejection indicate that donor-specific memory CD4 T cells provide help to B cells and induce alloantibody isotype switch despite treatment of the recipients with donor-specific cell transfusion and anti-CD154 Ab MR1. We investigated whether memory CD4 T cell help can be delivered in the absence of CD40/CD154 interaction and whether this help involves ICOS/B7RP-1 costimulatory pathway. Methods. TCR transgenic Marilyn (Mar) memory CD4 T cells were generated through in vitro stimulation with specific male antigen-derived HY Dby peptide followed by 4 weeks of in vivo rest. Wild type B6 (H-2 b ) or congenic CD40-/-female mice containing na\u00efve or memory Mar cells received heterotopic heart transplants from male C3H (H-2 k ) donors. Donor-specific alloAb serum titers were determined by flow cytometry on d 7, 14, 21, 28 and 60 post transplant. Results. Monotherapy with MR1 Ab (1mg i.v. on d -1) inhibited alloAb production in wild type B6 recipients injected with na\u00efve CD4 T cells. In contrast, memory CD4 T cells were resistant to the effects of MR1 treatment and induced high titers of donorspecific IgG Ab. To test whether help by memory CD4 T cells can be genuinely CD40/ CD154-independent, we performed adoptive transfer of na\u00efve and memory CD4 T cells into CD40-/-mice. Memory, but not naive Mar cells provided help to CD40-deficient B cells and induced production of donor but not third party-reactive IgG 1 , IgG 2a , IgG 2b and IgG 3 as early as 1 week post transplant with serum concentration of alloAb peaking at 2 weeks post transplant. Despite high titers of serum IgG, PNA and B220 staining revealed no germinal center formation in the spleens of CD40-/-recipients containing memory CD4 T cells. AlloAb production was not affected by the treatment of CD40-/recipients with MR1 Ab or anti-ICOS mAb, indicating that the memory CD4 T cell help to CD40-/-B cells was independent of CD154 engagement by an alternative ligand or ICOS/B7RP-1 pathway. Conclusion. Unlike na\u00efve CD4 T cells, donor-specific memory CD4 T cells can initiate alloAb response in CD40-deficient heart allograft recipients. Our results suggest that therapies interrupting CD40/CD154 signaling may fail to efficiently block de novo alloantibody production in T cell sensitized transplant patients.Fibroblastic Reticulum Cells of the Lymph Node Modulate ImmuneResponses by Reversing Dendritic Cell Maturation. Robert S. Liwski, 1 Konrad Kronenberger, 1 Kenneth A. West. 1 1 Departments of Pathology and Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada. reticulum cells (FRC) of the lymph node (LN) are known to influence the migration of naive T cells and Dendritic cells (DC) through the formation of a stromal FRC network and the production of chemokines. However little is known about FRC interactions with DC and T cells and their impact on DC and T cell activation. We have evaluated the interaction between DC, FRC and T cells in an in vitro model.For the generation of FRC, lymph nodes of BALB/c mice were isolated, cultured ex vivo and characterized by FACS analysis. After co culture with FRC, DC survival rate, maturation state and expression of cell surface molecules were evaluating using FACS. The ability of DC to induce T cell proliferation was evaluated using the D011.10 TCR transgenic system and CFSE labeling. To assess the production of soluble cytokines by FRC, DC and T cells ELISA, CBA and Luminex multiplex assays were used. Real time PCR was used to evaluate the production of cytokines and growth factors. Our in vitro culture method leads to a highly homogeneous FRC population that expresses gp38, ER-TR 7, CD44 and V-CAM but is negative for MHC II. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that DC migrated to FRC where they made physical contact leading to stable associations in vitro as well as in vivo in the LN. coincubation with FRC resulted in a prolongation in DC survival. When DC that had been matured with LPS were incubated with FRC it resulted in a profound down regulation of CD40, MHC II and costimulatory molecules on the DC. FRC supernatant was also able to downregulated DC maturation. FRC were found to produce several downregulatory growth factors including hepatocyte growth factor, IL-6 and IL-11. FRC conditioned DC had a strongly diminished ability to induce activation of na\u00efve T cells. The phenotype and cytokine profile of these T cells are under current investigation. Our results demonstrate that LN FRC provide a milieu that induces reversal of DC maturation and downregulation of T cell activation. These DC may have tolerogenic properties that would useful in modifying alloresponses.Paradoxical Role of B7-CD28 Costimulation in Fully AllogeneicVersus Class II Mismatched Vascularized Cardiac Allografts. Jun Yang, Joyce Poopola, Kazuhiro Yamaura, Mohamed H. Sayegh, Anil Chandraker. Transplantation Research Center,Brigham and Women's Hospital &  Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.    T cell B7-CD28 co-stimulatory pathway plays an important role in T cell activation, differentiation and proliferation. Our group and others have demonstrated that in full MHC mismatched transplant models CD28-deficient recipients have significantly delayed cardiac allograft rejection compared to WT recipients and that B7-1/B7-2 double knockout (B7DKO) recipients are unable to reject cardiac allografts. In this study, we investigated the role of the B7-CD28 pathway in the bm12 into B6 MHC class II mismatched cardiac transplant model. In this model, though cardiac allografts have long-term survival they develop severe transplant arteriosclerosis within 8 weeks of transplantation. The hearts from bm12 mice were transplanted into B6 WT and B6 background CD28KO, B7-1, B7-2 single knockout and B7DKO mice. Bm12 cardiac grafts transplanted into a B6 WT recipient had a median survival time (MST) of more than 56 days. Bm12 cardiac grafts transplanted into single B7-1 or B7-2 KO recipients had comparable survival times to WT recipients. Unexpectedly, allograft rejection was remarkably accelerated when bm12 hearts were transplanted into B7DKO recipients (MST 7 days)",

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have announced that1-year graft survival at a kidney-only transplant (KTx) center will be considered unacceptable if (a) the difference between observed and expected graft failures (GF) exceeds 3, (b) the ratio of observed to expected GF exceeds 1.5, and (c) the ratio is statistically significant (p < 0.05). Implicit in implementation of this ruling is accurate calculation of the expected number of GF at each center. Pre-existing recipient comorbidity may vary across centers, and estimates of expected outcomes that do not adjust for comorbidity may be problematic. We conducted an analysis of 25,991 first-time, KTx recipients from 2000 to 2004, who carried Medicare coverage during the 6 mo before KTx. Using USRDS and UNOS data, we assessed 11 comorbid conditions from Medicare claims during the 6 mo before KTx, and estimated expected GF during the first year following KTx with a Cox model that included donor and recipient characteristics, with and without adjustment for pre-existing comorbidity.During the 5-year era, 241 centers performed KTx (median = 87 KTx/center). Unadjusted 1-year graft survival was 87.9% and 92.8% among deceased-and living-donor recipients, respectively. Changes in expected GF per center, after adjustment for comorbidity, ranged from -21.3% to 37.1% (SD = 8.1%); 9 centers (3.7%) had expected GF decline by >10%, while 25 centers (10.4%) had expected GF rise by >10% (figure",

Xiang Xiao,1  Alexandar Kroemer,1  Wenda Gao, 1 Gulcin Demirci,1  Xian C. Li.1 1 Transplant Research Center, Beth Israel Deaconess  Med Ctr, Boston, MA.   :  Regulation is central to the induction of transplant tolerance. CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a highly specialized T cell subset in regulation and are believed to be \"hardwired\" to Foxp3. However, it is not clear whether Foxp3 + Tregs are fully committed to suppression in their entire life span. As manipulation of Foxp3+ Tregs is of considerable scientific and clinical interests, a clear understanding of this question is an important and clinical relevant issue. Methods: We have developed a new model where the endogenous Foxp3 gene is genetically linked to the reporter protein EGFP (foxp3gfp.KI). We then crossed the foxp3gfp.KI mice with OX40 KO mice and OX40Ltg mice and generated foxp3gfp. KI mice that are either deficient for OX40 or overexpress the ligand for OX40. We used these new foxp3gfp knockin models to critically study the role of OX40 in regulating Foxp3 + Treg homeostasis in vivo. Results: We found that transgenic expression the ligand for OX40 in vivo promotes a massive expansion of Foxp3 + Tregs, which accumulate in large numbers in both the lymphoid and non-lymphoid sites in OX40L transgenic mice. The expansion of Foxp3+ Tregs in vivo appears to be mediated by increased survival of Tregs in OX40Ltg mice. Surprisingly, Foxp3 + Tregs expanded by OX40 in vivo completely lack of suppressor functions despite constitutive expression of Foxp3 at high levels. Instead, OX40 reprograms Foxp3 + Tregs into a new type of Foxp3 + effector cells that mediate prompt skin allograft rejection and autoimmunity. Thus, Foxp3 + Tregs are not a fixed cells type; they can be readily reprogrammed to become cytopathic T cells. Importantly, OX40 plays a critical role in uncoupling Foxp3 and Treg functions and then reprogramming them to act as T effector cells. Conclusions: OX40 controls the in vivo homeostasis and regulatory functions of Foxp3+ Tregs. Our data also suggest that the effector programs of Foxp3+ Tregs are extremely flexible. This finding may have important implications for therapeutic manipulation of Foxp3 + Tregs in the clinic.Emergence of a Volume-Outcomes Relationship for Lung TransplantationIs Associated with Regionalization of the Procedure to High-Volume Centers: An Analysis of 12,603 Procedures.

Bromberg.1,2    Recanati/Miller Transplantation Institute, Mount Sinai School of Medicine; 2 Department of Gene and Cell Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY. : Transplant rejection involves networks of T cell interactions. Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets are important mediators of immune responses and inflammation. T-bet is the master transcription factor for Th1 development, while Stat6 plays a critical role for Th2 differentiation. Here, we generated Stat6 and T-bet double deficient (DKO) mice so that both Th1 and Th2 development are blocked, leaving Th17 and Treg pathways intact, to determine their roles in allograft rejection and survival. Methods: Stat6 KO and T-bet KO (all on BALB/c background) mice were crossed and DKO selected. T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for cell surface marker expression. Wild type, single KO, and DKO CD4 T cells were positively selected; stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3\u03b5 and anti-CD28 mAbs, or with T cell depleted splenocytes; and IL-4, IFN\u03b3 and IL-17 production examined by flow cytometry. Vascularized cardiac transplants were performed in wild type BALB/c, single KO, and DKO mice with C57BL/6 donors. Results: T cells from Stat6/T-bet DKO mice had normal CD4 and CD8 T cell distribution; normal CD44, CD69, and CD62L expression; and normal populations of CD4+CD25+ Foxp3+ natural Treg. Anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 or alloantigenic stimulation induced little IFN\u03b3 or IL-4, showing that the Th1 and Th2 pathways were blocked. There were no differences in Th17 generation after stimulation, indicating that blocking Th1 and Th2 did not autoregulate or result in default generation of Th17. However, IL-6 plus TGF\u03b2 treatment of DKO induced a very high percentage of Th17, suggesting Th1 and Th2 pathways both independently suppressed Th17 development. While wild type and single KO mice rejected cardiac allografts within 9 days, Stat6/Tbet DKO mice had prolonged graft survival (>30 days), suggesting that Th17 alone did not mediate acute allograft rejection. Conclusion: Th1 and Th2 cells and cytokines are sufficient for normal graft rejection and inhibit the development of Th17. Stat6/T-bet DKO mice have impaired development of Th1 and Th2, but not Th17 or Treg. DKO recipients have prolonged allograft survival, suggesting that Th17 cells by themselves are not easily induced to mediate early acute rejection, but that rejection requires Th1 or Th2 cells and cytokines for rejection. These findings have important implications for devising suppression and tolerance protocols.Increased Recipient Age Impairs the CD4 + Effector T-Cell Response While Regulatory T-Cell Functions Remain Preserved.

(TMG)  induction reduces acute rejection (AR) risk in kidney transplantation (KTx). However, inadequate data exists regarding dosing strategies(fixed versus CD3 based), intensity, and density of dosing on TMG efficacy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate TMG dosing intensity and density on AR. Methods: Data was collected prospectively in 426 pts who received TMG induction. Variables with a p<0.25 entered the multivariate (MVA) stepwise logistic regression model. TMG dose was 1.5 mg/kg; TMG regimens were: fixed dosing (days 0,2,4,6) CD3 based (dose given when CD3+ cells > 25/ul). Results: Data is presented as (CD3 dosing/fixed dosing). Total # pts 223 / 203, mean follow-up (days) 1431\u00b1761/ 963\u00b1702 (p<0.0001). AR rate was higher with CD3 based dosing (16% / 9%, p<0.005). To determine whether this was due to an independent effect of CD3 based dosing, rigorous MVA was performed. Univariate analysis (UVA) of AR risk factors (gender, AA recipient race, PRA, DGF, DR mismatches, diabetes, repeat transplant) and TMG dosing data (# doses, total dose (mg/kg), # days CD3 suppression, dosing interval, dosing regimen type (fixed v CD3-based)) was performed. Significant UVA factors that entered the MVA model included: AA race, repeat txp, current PRA>25%, CD3 based dosing, total TMG dose (<4, 4-5, 5-6, and > 6 mg/kg)(Table). In the final MVA model, the only significant risk factor for AR was the CD3based dosing regimen. This observation was further confirmed by MVA analysis that controlled for DGF by excluding DGF pts. Mean total TMG dose effect was controlled by grouping pts according to total dose magnitude in MVA.Conclusion: CD3-based TMG dosing is an independent RF for AR in KTx pts receiving TMG induction. Rigorous examination by multivariate analysis adds to the robustness of this observation. This may be an effect of TMG dosing density as CD3-based dosing Abstracts increased the interval between TMG doses compared to the fixed dose group. This observation argues for adoption of fixed dose TMG regimens for induction.Patterns of Acute Rejection in Kidney Transplant Recipients Treated with Alemtuzumab Induction and Steroid-Free Maintenance Therapy.Adam W.

Grant. 1 1 Multi-Organ Transplantation Program, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. : The withholding of CNIs and the early introduction of MMF to CNI based protocols has become widespread practice in liver transplant (LTx) recipients with early renal dysfunction. While there is a sound theoretical basis for this approach, there is little data on the long term results. Methods: We compared 195 LTx recipients, receiving a low-dose CNI immunosuppression (IS) combined with MMF ( low CNI / MMF) and 441 LTx recipients receiving a standard full-dose CNI ( full CNI) regime. We examined the renal function at 12, 24 and 36 months (m) as well as the slope of renal function (\u2206m24-m6) of both groups. Results: The mean age 52.5\u00b111.2 vs.51.8\u00b19.7 (y) and observation time 41.9\u00b130.8 vs.38.5\u00b124.7 (m) were similar between both groups. The gender distribution 71.2 vs.60.6% male and the mean MELD scores of 21.2\u00b110.9 vs. 16.2\u00b19.1 were significantly different ( low CNI/MMF vs. full CNI, p<0.05). S-creatinine immediately after LTx (day 0) was 135.1\u00b195.4 \u00b5mol/l in the low CNI/MMF group and 103,5 \u00b146,7 \u00b5mol/l in the full CNI group, respectively. However, at 12 m the low CNI/ MMF group (70.73\u00b123.08 ml/min) with initially impaired renal function was similar to the full CNI group 117.3\u00b168.1 vs. 110.7\u00b148.8 \u00b5mol/l (MDRD-GFR 70.73\u00b123.08 vs. 73.21\u00b124.07 ml/min). At 2 and 3 years after transplantation, the renal function remained similar between the two groups (115.5\u00b167.4, 117.6\u00b155.5 full CNI vs. 116.0\u00b146.0, 119.3\u00b143.7 low CNI/MMF \u00b5mol/l). Renal function was significantly better at 12, 24 and 36 m when patients were continuously treated with MMF (114.7\u00b134.5, 118.8\u00b149.1, 119.4\u00b142.8 \u00b5mol/l) as compared to the patients where MMF (127.0\u00b195.6, 126.7\u00b165.4, 128.3\u00b155.7 \u00b5mol/l; all p <0.05).) was stopped within the first year. The slope of renal function between 6 and 24 m after LTx in the low CNI/MMF group was superior to the Methods: national, retrospective, multicenter, observational study.",

In spite of properly followed guideline criteria Conclusion: DCD donors are a viable source of liver allografts for transplantation. Patients who receive DCD livers have outcomes comparable to subjects who receive grafts from brain dead donors. Use of DCD livers from donors over 60 years of age is accompanied by a higher incidence of retransplantation and biliary complications. Background: Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) is in its infancy in liver transplantation (LTx). Potential benefits include diminished reperfusion injury and improved early function. Methods: The study was designed as a Phase 1 trial of liver HMP. Exclusion criteria included: multiple organ recipients, MELD>35, ICU patients, and patients >65 years of age. Donor livers >65 years, biopsy with >30% macrosteatosis and DCD were also ineligible for HMP. Seventeen patients were enrolled transplanted with livers that underwent HMP for 4-7 hours using dual centrifugal perfusion with Vasosol solution at 4-6\u00b0C. Patient, operative and early outcome variables were recorded. We compared outcomes to 17 matched cold stored (CS) controls from the same era. Results: All 17 HMP grafts functioned immediately by usual clinical criteria with intraoperative bile production. Results are summarized in Table 1 . ",

Introduction: Transcription factor T-bet plays a crucial role in Th1/Th2 development. Here, we investigated the role of T-bet in Th17 differentiation and function of Th17 cytokines in allograft rejection using an MHC class II mismatched model of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Methods/Results: Cardiac allografts from bm12 mice were transplanted into wild-type as well as T-bet and IFN-\u03b3 deficient C57BL/6 recipients. T-bet-/-mice showed significantly accelerated allograft rejection (MST=14.75\u00b10.96 days). However, as previously reported, all IFN-\u03b3-/-and majority of the C57BL/6 mice accepted grafts for greater than 60 days. Upon in vitro stimulation of recipient splenocytes by irradiated donor cells, T-bet-/-and INF-\u03b3-/-lymphocytes produced significantly less INF-\u03b3 and more Th2 cytokines. Interestingly, production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IL-6 was significantly higher in T-bet-/-(337\u00b194.4 and 339\u00b110.5 pg/ml) than C57BL/6 (135.1\u00b168.3, 75.3\u00b125.9pg/ml, P=0.0399 and 0.0001 compared to T-bet-/-) and INF-\u03b3-/-(95.8\u00b129.8, 20844.5 pg/ml, P=0.0135 and 0.0093 compared to T-bet-/-) mice. In vivo administration of IL-17 neutralizing antibody (mab421) significantly prolonged survival of bm12 hearts (MST>30 days, p<0.01 compared to the 15.3\u00b12.6 days of the control IgG group) in T-bet-/-mice. Immunofluorescence staining of bm12 hearts harvested from T-bet-/-recipients indicated that both CD4 and CD8 infiltrating lymphocytes produced IL-17. However, T-bet-CD4 double knockout mice did not reject bm12 heart grafts, nor did the grafts exhibit chronic vasculopathy. In contrast, T-bet-CD8 double knockout mice rejected (MST:18.9\u00b13.2 days). Splenocytes from T-bet-CD4 knockouts produced significant lower IL-6 (12.9\u00b13.8) and IL-17 (7.9\u00b14.6 pg/ml) than observed in T-bet knockouts (940\u00b1176.3 and 210.2\u00b173.4 pg/ml) and T-bet-CD8 knockouts (1240.5\u00b1215.6 and 113.1\u00b161.2 pg/ml respectively) recipients when re-stimulated with donor cells, while there was no significant difference in INF-\u03b3 production.",

This study was performed to evaluate the clinical outcome of protocol biopsy-proven C4d positive renal transplants with stable graft function in the early posttransplantation period. Methods: 151 renal allograft biopsies were included. Protocol biopsies (n=79) were performed from stable allografts on day 14 posttransplantation, and indication biopsies (n=72) were performed from dysfunctioning allografts. Incidence of C4d positivity was compared between protocol and indication biopsies. Clinical characteristics, biopsy findings, graft function, acute rejection episodes, and graft survival rates were compared between the C4d-positive and C4d-negative grafts in each group. Results: C4d deposition in protocol biopsies was detected in 4 of 79 biopsies (5.1%), whereas 9.7% (7 of 72 biopsies) in indication biopsies. The histological findings of C4d-positive protocol biopsies were minimal inflammation of tubulointerstitium. On the other hand, those of C4d-positive indication biopsies were various including acute humoral rejection, acute cellular rejection, acute tubular necrosis and calcineurin inhibitor toxicity. In the protocol biopsy group, graft function during 1 year after biopsy, acute rejection rate, and cumulative graft survival did not differ between the C4d-positive and C4d-negative grafts. All C4d-positive allografts maintained stable graft function without any antirejection therapy. In the indication biopsy group, graft function during 1 year after biopsy and acute rejection rate did not differ between the C4d-positive and C4d-negative grafts. However the cumulative graft survival rate was worse in the C4d-positive grafts than the C4d-negative ones (p=0.008). Conclusion: C4d positivity associated with allograft dysfunction indicates a poor graft outcome. However, C4d-positive allografts with stable graft function in the early posttransplantation period take an indolent course.",

Results: 45 patients had diffuse (>50%) C4d staining out of 228 who had kidney transplant biopsies in this time and had been followed up within the centre. Of these 45 patients, 20 also had DSA prior or at the time of biopsy. The fall in eGFR in this group a year post biopsy was greater than those with diffuse staining for C4d but no DSA. The mean change in eGFR from the day of biopsy at a year was -3.1ml/min/1.73m2 (+/-12.1) in those with DSA compared with +17.7 ml/min/1.73m2 (+/-23.2) for those with C4d but without DSA. The changes in eGFR from the pre-biopsy baseline at one year showed a fall in eGFR in both groups but this was greater in those with DSA (-21.5 compared with -9.6 ml/min/1.73m2 ).Of 179 patients who never had diffuse or focal C4d staining on biopsy, only 81 had had DSA tested. Of these only 8 (10%) had a positive DSA result. From these eight, four had features of rejection and four did not. One person in each of these groups is dialysis dependant and one person in the rejection group has eGFR <15 ml/min/1.73m2. Although small numbers, this outcome appears to be worse than that of C4d negative patients with no DSA but features of rejection who in fact showed an improvement in eGFR from the day of biopsy by 14.4 m l/min/1.73m2 or an improvement from their pre-biopsy baseline of 1.3 m l/min/1.73m2 at one year. Conclusion: DSA is of additional value in evaluating risk of graft failure. This appears to be of value in those with and without diffuse C4d staining on biopsy.",

Flow-cytometry crossmatches (FCXM) have been suggested as method of screening for development of donor-specific HLA antibodies post-transplantation, but interpretation of crossmatch results can be confounded by antibodies directed against antigens other than HLA. We assessed the impact of developing a positive FCXM post-transplantation on clinical outcomes in a cohort of live donor renal allograft recipients. Methods: 29 patients were studied. 23/29 (79%) received tacrolimus-based and 6/29 (21%) ciclosporin-based immunosuppression. Median follow-up was 24 months. All patients had negative complement-dependent cytotoxic (CDC) T cell crossmatches pretransplantation. 4/8 (50%) in the group with a positive FCXM had an acute rejection episode in the first 12 months compared with 10/21 (41%) in the group with a negative FCXM (p=NS). Graft function at 12 months was not different between the groups (positive FCXM -median creatinine 137mmol/L; negative FCXM -median creatinine 141mmol/L; p=NS). 2/8 grafts (25%) were lost within the first year in the positive FCXM group compared with 1/21 (5%) in the group with negative post-transplant FCXM (p=NS).",

This may be explained by the poor correlation between a positive FCXM and the presence of antibody directed against mismatched donor HLA antigens. Surveillance for development of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies after transplantation may be best performed using high-resolution bead technologies rather than FCXM. Use of the FCXM alone, without establishing antibody profiles, is of limited predictive value. based upon the amount of antibody (Ab) measured by the titer of donor specific HLA antibodies, DSA, or the fluorescence intensity (FI) of the donor specific single antigen bead.

The aim of our study was to determine the effects in the graft and in the receptor of the pre-treatment of the donor with EPO and treatment of the recipient with 5-AIQ, in a porcine model of DCD kidney transplantation. Material/Methods:24 Landrace pigs were killed by lethal injection; their kidneys were subjected to 30 min of warm ischemic time (WIT) and then transplanted after 24 h of cold storage in Celsior. In the pre-treated group, donors received a single dose of EPO (1000 IU/kg) 30 min before cardiac arrest. In the treated group, recipients received a continuous dose of 5-AIQ (5mg/kg/h) 10 minutes before reperfusion and maintained during 60 minutes. Blood, urine and renal tissue samples were collected at the end of the experiment for biochemical, histological and immunohistochemistry (PARS, iNOS and COX-2) evaluation. Data analysis performed with Graph Pad Prism Statistical Package; p<0.05 considered statistically significant. Results:Transplantation of kidneys from DCD resulted in: a significant rise of the levels of creatinine, N-acetil-b-D-glucosaminidase, glutathione-S-transferase, AST, LDH, ALT, fractional excretion of Na+, interleucin 1 and 6, malondialdehyde levels and myeloperoxidase activity (p<0.05); a significant reduction in urine flow and creatinine clearance, disturbances in the histological and imunohistochemistry pattern. Administration of EPO before ischemia and 5-AIQ before reperfusion reduced significantly the biochemical (p<0.01), histological and imunohistochemical evidence of glomerular dysfunction and tubular injury. They also reduced systemic injury, inflammatory response and oxidative stress. Conclusions:Pre-treatment of the donor with EPO and treatment of the recipient with 5-AIQ causes a substantial reduction of the dysfunction and injury associated with the transplantation of kidneys recovered after cardiac death. In the HMP group perfusate AST levels strongly correlated with recipient Peak AST by linear regression (p<0.001). Conclusions: HMP of liver grafts provides safe and reliable preservation in our pilot series. Perfusate AST may allow pretransplant prediction of reperfusion injury. A larger randomized trial will be necessary to demonstrate the magnitude of benefits of HMP over CS in LTx.Purpose: Liver discard rates have increased in a large, urban organ procurement organization from 8 % to 24 %. The reason is likely the result of increased transplant surgeon willingness to consider organs close to the margin of clinical acceptability. However, the costs associated with recovering these organs are high if the liver is discarded. We endeavored to determine whether a model based on pre-recovery data could predict liver discard Introduction: We report our 6 years experience with the use of Campath-1H (C1H) in adult liver transplantation.",

Most common primary diseases were Laennec (n=60), cryptogenic cirrhosis (n=31) and autoimmune: PSC (n=17), PBC (n=16) and AIH (n=14). The first dose of C1H was administered immediately before (n=74) or after (n=92) the transplant procedure. Follow up was until September, 2007. Results: Five year patient and graft survival was 90% and 85% respectively. There were 14 deaths due to stroke (n=2), chronic rejection (n=2), failure to thrive/pneumonia (n=3), sepsis (n=2), hepatic artery thrombosis, HCC, prostate cancer, graft lymphoma and non-compliance (one each). Seven patients were retransplanted, for primary non function (n=2), portal vein thrombosis (n=1), hepatic artery thrombosis (n=1), hepatitis B (n=1) and chronic rejection (n=2). Thirty six patients had biopsy proven rejection episodes: mild (n=28), moderate (n=9) or severe (n=3). The average tacrolimus 12 hour trough levels were 6.6, 5.2 ng/ml and 2.78 ng/ml for the 1rst, 3 nd and 5th year post-transplantation, respectively. There was no significant difference in the outcome of the transplant so far, between patients that received C1H before or after the transplant procedure. Immunosuppression-related complications included A). Opportunistic infections: most common were Herpes Zoster (n=19), CMV (n=3), and Herpes Simplex (n=3), B). Neoplasms: skin cancer (n=3), Kaposi sarcoma (n=1), lymphoma (n=2) and C). Nephrotoxicity: Five patients received a kidney graft for diabetic nephropathy (n=2), nephrotic syndrome (n=1) and calcineurin nephrotoxicity (n=2).

Introduction: In the prospective ReSpECT study, primary liver transplant patients were randomised to 1 of 3 groups: A) standard-dose tacrolimus (target trough level > 10 ng/ml) for the 1 st month; B) 2 g mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) IV until at least day 5, 2 g PO thereafter + reduced-dose tacrolimus (target trough level \u2264 8 ng/ml); and C) MMF as in Group B + reduced-dose tacrolimus introduced on day 5 (target trough level \u2264 8 ng/ml) + daclizumab on days 1 and 7. Steroids were given in all groups according to local centre protocol. Results at 1 year showed that 2 g MMF + delayed and reduced tacrolimus + daclizumab is associated with significantly less impairment of renal function compared with standard treatment. Here we present the results of the per protocol (PP) population. Methods: The PP population, which was defined prior to the sub-group analysis, consisted of patients from the full analysis set who had no inclusion/exclusion criteria violation, had at least one creatinine clearance (CrCl) value beyond 6 months, were treated according to the protocol and did not receive any prohibited medication during the first 14 days and for less than 1 week at any time during the study. A composite endpoint comprising freedom from renal dysfunction (\u2265 20% decrease from baseline in calculated CrCl), acute rejection, graft loss or death was also investigated. Results: The full analysis set included 181, 168 and 168 patients, whereas the PP population only included 69, 67 and 67 patients in Groups A, B and C, respectively. The mean difference in calculated CrCl from baseline to 1 year was significantly smaller in Group C compared with Group A (-10.7 ml/min vs -22.0 ml/min, p = 0.038), but was not significantly different between Groups A and B (-20.50 ml/min). The incidences of death (n = 2, 0, 1) and graft loss (n = 1, 0, 0) were similar in all 3 groups. The incidence of the composite endpoint at 1 year was in both the full analysis set and the PP population significantly lower in Group C compared with Group A (PP population: 70% vs 93%, p < 0.0001), but was not significantly different between Groups A and B (85%).",

Aims: Post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a serious complication of solid organ transplantation that is closely associated with Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection. EBV + PTLD lymphomas express several latent viral genes including latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), a proven oncogene that is essential for human B cell transformation. LMP1 is able to activate Erk, JNK, p38, NF\u03baB and PI3K. The aim of this study is to determine whether LMP1 isolated from PTLD tumors differs in signaling ability from LMP1 derived from the B.95 strain of EBV, originally isolated from a patient with infectious mononucleosis. Methods: LMP1 variants isolated from a panel of EBV + PTLD-associated B cell lines were cloned and sequenced. Inducible chimeric constructs containing the LMP1 C-terminus and NGFR transmembrane domain were created for each tumor variant and expressed in the Burkitts B lymphoma cell line BL41. LMP1 signaling in BL41 clones was induced by crosslinking of NGFR. Activation of p38, Erk, Akt and JNK was assayed by Western Blotting (WB) with phospho-specific antibodies. NF\u03baB activation was assayed by WB for I\u03baB and cFos induction was analyzed by WB and the TransAM cFos binding assay. Results: All three tumor variants of LMP1, as well as the B.95 LMP1 isoform, were able to induce p38 activation within 30min of NGFR crosslinking while Akt and JNK were activated within 10min. All variants showed similar ability to activate NF\u03baB. However, tumor LMP1 variants induced prolonged Erk activation (up to 3hrs) while the B.95 LMP1 variant induced a transient response. cFos is induced only during the sustained phase of Erk activation. Indeed, the tumor variants of LMP1, but not B.95 LMP1, were able to induce cFos protein. Similarly, cFos binding to the AP1 consensus site was only observed in tumor LMP1-induced nuclear lysates. Two mutations in the C-terminus-aa212 (S vs G) and aa366 (T vs S) -are conserved in the tumor variants LMP1 compared to B.95 LMP1. Point mutation of either of these amino acids from the B.95 to tumor variant version allowed for sustained activation of Erk and subsequent cFos induction and binding to the AP1 site. Conclusion: Tumor-derived LMP1 has enhanced ability to induce the cFos oncogene and this property can be localized to two amino acids in the C terminus. These findings suggest that these specific amino acid residues of LMP1 are important in determining whether EBV infection is benign or results in PTLD.",

Studies using CXCL-10 KO mice have shown that these mice are protected through an IL-10 dependent mechanism. We chose to investigate IRF3, upstream of CXCL-10, to further characterize its role in the injury progression, and to better understand the involvement of IL-10 in this pathway. METHODS: We used IRF3 KO mice and their WT counterparts in a model of partial hepatic warm ischemia with 1, 2, and 6h of tissue reperfusion (n=2 KO, WT at 1 and 6h; n=3 KO, WT at 2h). WT bone marrow derived macrophages were generated and stimulated with LPS to determine the kinetics of IL-10 production. Tissue was analyzed for histology and mRNA levels were measured by qPCR. RESULTS: Kinetic studies showed peak IL-10 production at 1 and 2h post-reperfusion (PR). On pathology, IRF3 KO mouse livers were protected from IR injury both early PR, at 1 and 2h, and at 6hrs PR when compared to WT. Consistent with these data, IL-6 mRNA induction was decreased in IRF3 KO, as compared with WT at 1, 2, and 6h. Although IL-10 induction was maintained in the CXCL-10 KO mice, the IRF3 KO mice showed decreased levels of IL-10 at 1h PR. By 2h, IL-10 levels were normalized to WT. CONCLUSION: IRF3 KO mice are protected from liver IR injury with evidence of this protection as early as 1h PR. Although CXCL-10 KO mice are protected from IR injury with maintained IL-10 expression, the absence of the upstream molecule, IRF3, confers protection in an IL-10 independent manner. These data suggest a novel mechanism of IR injury mediated by IRF3 in the liver. Background: Bone marrow (BM) transplantation may induce donor-specific tolerance to prevent rejection of allogeneic solid organs while maintaining immunity against infections and tumors. Currently allogeneic BM transplantation is limited by donor T cell mediated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), as well as a variable requirement for recipient marrow ablation and high numbers of donor BM cells. Furthermore, sustained macro-chimerism has not yet been easily or predictably achieved in partially ablated patients or large animals. While rejection of allografts is mediated primarily by recipient T cells, recent studies have demonstrated the capacity of NK cells to reject allogeneic BM and to prevent long-term mixed chimerism. Thus, NK cells represent a barrier to long term BM engraftment even with T cell tolerance. We have previously identified a novel type of regulatory T (Treg) cell with a \"double negative\" (DN) phenotype (TCRab + CD3 + CD4 -CD8 -). DN-Treg cells can effectively suppress anti-donor T and B cell responses and prolong graft survival in allo-and xenotransplantation models. We therefore tested the capacity of DN-Treg to alter NK cell function. Methods: C57BL/6 BM cells were i.v. injected into sub-lethally-irradiated (6.5 Gy) CB6F1 (H-2b/d) in a \"parent to F1\" model, or into allo-disparate BALB/c mice. BM cells were co-transplanted with various numbers of C57BL/6 DN-Treg cells or CD4 + or CD8 + T cells as controls. Recipient spleen cells were collected 7 days after to detect donor progenitors in a colony-forming-unit (CFU) assay. Mice then received cardiac (n=8) or skin transplants (n=8) to confirm tolerance.",

Adoptive transfer of DN-Treg cells with donor BM cells promoted the establishment of stable mixed chimerism and donor specific tolerance to BM donor cardiac and skin grafts (MST>160 days), without inducing GVHD in sub-lethally irradiated mice. Perforin deficient DN-Treg cells were unable to efficiently inhibit NK cell function, and donor BM did not engraft. These results demonstrate a potential approach to control innate immune responses and promote allogeneic BM engraftment and donor specific tolerance through the use of DN-Treg cells.Framingham risk score (FRS) predicts cardiovascular (CV) risk in the general population, but may underestimate CV risk in kidney transplant (txp) patients (pts). FRS has not previously been validated by prospective cardiovascular event (CVE) data collection in kidney txp pts. The purpose of this study was to validate FRS with actual observed CVE data in kidney txp pts. Methods: CVE data was collected at routine intervals in our kidney txp pts and entered in a cardiovascular risk database. FRS was calculated from baseline to 7 yrs posttransplant (PTx) Individual FRS factors of age, sex, smoking, diabetes mellitus (DM), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), total cholesterol (TC), and blood pressure (BP) were evaluated for their ability to predict acutal CVE occurring after kidney txp. Pts with coronary artery disease (CAD) were excluded from the FRS analysis. CVE were defined as sudden death, myocardial infarction, angina, and cerebrovascular accident/transient ischemic attack. FRS factors were evaluated by cox proportional hazards in univariate (UVA) and multivariate (MVA) models. Rho kinase (ROK) modulates calcium sensitivity of vascular smooth muscle cells and contributes to the regulation of peripheral vascular tone in man. In essential hypertension increased ROK-activity contributes to the generation of vascular resistance. Arterial hypertension is a common complication in renal transplant recipients.

Interestingly, ROK-inhibition also reduces central blood pressure and arterial stiffness in these patients. Improvement of both these parameters has been linked to a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in large trials.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a CVD risk equivalent, justifying aggressive risk reduction with blood pressure (BP) control, statins, aspirin, and use of angiotensin converting inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). DeKaf is an NIH-sponsored prospective observational study examining causes of KTx failure at 7 transplant centers in the US and Canada, with current enrollment of over 1800 subjects. We examined the use of cardioprotective medications among patients transplanted after 10/1/05 with at least 6 mos follow-up, focusing on subgroups with preexisting diabetes (DM) and/or CVD. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to asses the prevalence and the predictors for the development of hyperuricemia at 6 months after kidney transplantation and the association between hyperuricemia and clinical outcomes including patient and graft survival, new cardiovascular events and chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN). Adult patients who underwent kidney transplantation at Mount Sinai Medical Center between 1.1.2001-12.30.2004 were included. Patients who died or lost the allograft within 6 months after transplantation were excluded from analysis. Of the 307 patients with a functioning allograft at 6 months after transplantation, 163 patients (53%) had normal uric levels and 144 patients (47%) had hyperuricemia. After age, race, sex adjustment, receiving a cadaveric kidney, having an eGFR<50 ml/min, and taking diuretics and cyclosporine were associated with a higher odds ratio of hyperuricemia. Over a mean of 4.3 years of follow-up, 81 patients had one, or more, of the pooled outcomes; 40 had new cardiovascular events, 41 developed biopsy-proven CAN, 4 patients died, and 20 had graft failure. Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that the pooled outcomes of events occurred more frequently in hyperuricemic patients (Figure, p < 0.001). Due to association between low eGFR and hyperuricemia, we analyzed the clinical outcomes in patients with low and normal eGFR. While 44.7% of hyperuricemic patients with an eGFR<50 ml/min had one of the pooled outcomes, it was 20.8% in patients with normal uric acid levels (p=0.038). Among patients with an eGFR \u226550 ml/min, 19.4% of normouricemic and 25% of hyperuricemic patients had one of the events. These results suggests an important association between hyperuricemia at 6 months after transplantation and the new cardiovascular events, biopsy-proven CAN, and graft loss in kidney transplant recipients with decreased allograft function. Background: Long-term survival after liver transplantation (LT) is now the rule rather than the exception. Hence, assessment of outcomes for children after LT must consider not only the quantity, but also the quality, of life years survived and restored. Aim: To examine key HRQOL themes after pediatric LT raised by both recipients and their parent proxies, with evaluation by time (1-3 yrs, 3-5 yrs, 5-10 yrs, and >10 yrs) since LT. Methods: Semi-structured 1:1 item generation interviews were conducted in person with children (C) and parents (P) at time of ambulatory LT follow-up at 4 pediatric LT programs in Canada and UK. All interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim, and subjected to content analysis utilizing QSR NVIVO 2.0 software for HRQOL related theme generation. The participants interviewed were part of a larger research program aimed at developing a disease-specific instrument to assess HRQOL for children after LT. Results: Data representing 91 (47% male) pediatric LT recipients was obtained from a total of 146 (62 C, 84 P) item generation interviews. Median recipient age at LT was 2.4 (range, 0.05 to 17) yrs, for primary indications including biliary atresia (45%), fulminant liver failure (17.6%), metabolic liver disease (4,4%), malignancy (8.8%) and others (24.2%). Median patient age at time of interview was 9.9 (range, 1.1 to 18.8) yrs. Themes emerging at all time points post-LT included infection risks, limitations on physical activities, side effects from immunosuppression meds, educational supports, and ongoing bloodwork. Themes identified within the medium (1-5 yrs) follow-up included worries about rejection episodes, need for future re-transplantation, school absenteeism, and altered sibling and family dynamics. The impact of living with a surgical scar was a more frequent theme with recipients >3 yrs from LT. As time from LT increased to >10 yrs, themes suggest a focus on normalization and health promoting behaviours, along with expressed desires to be like healthy peers. Conclusions: Unique HRQOL themes emerged from item generation interviews not captured by currently available generic HRQOL tools. HRQOL themes identified after pediatric LT suggest the importance of considering time trajectories from LT, and a focus on elements of 'everyday life' apart from LT. The shortage of cadaveric donors has led many transplant centers to expand their criteria for accepting life-saving organs. Utilization of donation after cardiac death (DCD) donors has been estimated to increase the number of cadaveric donors. We report our experience with a recently established DCD program at a pediatric hospital and the outcome with the transplanted grafts. Methods: In 2005 a protocol for DCD was established at a free standing pediatric hospital. From 2005 to 2006 all patients undergoing withdrawal of care were evaluated for DCD. Patients meeting criteria for DCD underwent withdrawal by the critical care team and organ retrieval was initiated if asystole was reached in less than 60 minutes. In addition, one DCD liver was imported and was included in the liver results. Results: During the 2 year study period 7 patients (25% of total donors) underwent DCD resulting in 14 organs (11 kidneys and 3 livers) transplanted. The 7 cases had a mean donor age of 9 yrs (range 3-16), WIT of 22 min (9-55), time sBP < 60 of 11 min (7-15), and time from asystole to aortic flush of 8 min (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Four kidneys were transplanted locally with CIT 5-14 hrs, no DGF, and one month creat 1.2-1.7. The remaining 7 kidneys were exported for transplant. Four livers were transplanted locally with donor age 7 mth-16 yrs, WIT 12-28 min, recipient age 14 mth-61 yrs, CIT 6-15 hrs, AST peak 190-3630, AST day 7 33-44, INR peak 1.4-1.8, INR day 7 1.0-1.1, Total Bili one month 0.3-1.0, and graft survival 1.5-2.9 yrs. There were no vascular or biliary complications. Conclusions: A protocol for DCD at a pediatric hospital increased the number of pediatric donors by 25%. Liver and kidney grafts from pediatric DCD donors demonstrated excellent graft function and survival.",

Pediatric Liver Transplant Program, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Saint-Luc University Clinics, Brussels, Belgium. When graft failure occurs in liver recipients, secondary transplantation represents the only chance of long-term survival. In such instance however, several surgical and immunological aspects should be carefully considered, with respect to their impact on final outcome.In the present study, the epidemiology and outcome of graft loss following primary pediatric liver transplantation (LT) were analysed, with the hypothesis that early retransplantation (reLT) might be associated with lower immunologial risks when compared to late reLT. Between March 1984 and December 2005, 745 liver grafts were transplanted to 638 children at Saint-Luc University Hospital, Brussels. Among them, a total of 90 children (14%) underwent 107 reLT, and were categorized into two groups (early reLT, n=58; late reLT, n=32), according to the interval between both transplant procedures (< or > 30 days).Ten-year patient survival rate was 85% in recipients with a single LT, versus 61% in recipients requiring reLT (p=0.001). Ten-year patient survival rates were 59% and 66% for early and late reLT, respectively (p=0.423), the corresponding graft survival rates being 51% and 63% (p=0.231). Along the successive eras, the rate of reLT decreased from 17% to 10%, whereas progressive improvement of outcome post-reLT was observed. No recurrence of chronic rejection (CR) was observed after reLT for CR (0/19). Two children developed a positive cross-match at reLT (2/10, 20%), both retransplanted lately for CR secondary to immunosuppression withdrawal following a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease.In summary, the current need for reLT has been decreasing over years, with a parallel improvement of its outcome. The results presented could not evidence better results for early reLT when compared to late reLT. The latter did not seem to be associated with higher immunological risk, except for children with immunosuppression withdrawal following the first graft.",

Given the recent interest in the role of omega-6 lipids in the development of Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Disease (PNALD), we sought to examine in a multiple variable model the role of days of maximal lipid (>2.5 g/kg/day), in the development of this outcome. Method: Between 2003 and 2004, data were collected prospectively on all neonates undergoing an abdominal surgical procedure. Univariate logistic regression models for the prediction of CB100 were developed with the following predictors: gestational age, percentile weight, percent predicted small bowel and colonic length, resection of the ileocecal valve, presence of a stoma, post-operative enteral tolerance, number of septic episodes, days of PN amino acid > 2.5g/kg/day, days of PN lipid > 2.5g/kg/day, and total days of PN. Univariate predictors significant at the 0.2 level were entered into a backward stepwise multiple variable logistic regression. Results: 152 infants received PN post-operatively, and 22 developed CB100. Predictors that met criteria for consideration in the multiple variable model were: age (p=0.079), weight (p=0.059), small bowel length (p=0.001), presence of a stoma (p=0.163), proportion of enteral feeds post-operatively (p=0.049), days of PN amino acid > 2.5g/ kg/day (p=0.00), days of lipid > 2.5 g/kg/day (p=0.00), and total days of PN (p=0.00).The final multiple variable model which had a negative predictive value of 97.6% and positive predictive value of 52.6% is presented in the table below.

These data may provide targets, such as careful line care, reduction in maximal lipid dose, or the use of alternate lipids such as Omega-3 fatty acids, to prevent CB100 an identified marker for the need of subsequent liver transplantation in infants with PNALD. Terminal renal failure occurs in more than 10 % of liver transplant recipients after 10 years. We have previously shown that, beside renal toxicity of calcineurin inhibitors, renal lesions may be related to diabetes, arterial hypertension, accumulation of hydroxyethylstarch (ELHOES), and the etiology of the liver disease. We made the hypothesis that these lesions may be already present at the time of liver transplantation (LT), a finding that could lead to adapt the perioperative management. This work investigated prospectively whether renal histopathological lesions were present before LT by performing systematically a renal biopsy by endovenous route in 60 candidates to LT with end-stage liver disease. These patients were 58 \u00b1 10 years old, 46 males ; 10/60 had a diabetes, and 21 an arterial hypertension ; the liver disease was related to alcohol in 32 cases, HCV in 12 cases, HBV in 5 cases, and to a cholestatic disease in 7 cases. At the time of the pre-LT workup, the biochemical parameters were : Child score10 \u00b1 2, MELD score 18 \u00b1 4, prothrombin rate 50 \u00b1 12, creatinin serum level 90 \u00b1 6 umol/L, proteinuria 0.12 \u00b1 0.04 g/24h. Severe side effects related to the procedure were limited to 2 cases of macroscopic hematuria, lasting less than 24 hours. In 10 cases, the material obtained during the procedure did not allow the histological analysis. Among the 50 samples available, 21 were considered as normal ; in 29 cases, lesions related to mesangial IgA glomerulonephritis (14 cases), diabetic glomerulosclerosis (12 cases), ELHOES accumulation (5 cases), thrombotic microangiopathy (1 case) were found, often associated ; in 5 cases, the lesions were severe and lead to combined kidney/liver transplantation in 2 cases. In conclusion, significant renal lesions are detectable in more than 50 % of the candidates to LT. Interestingly, histological findings often combined lesions related to the liver disease and to an associated cause (diabetes, previous treatment by ELHOES or interferon). Results of histological analysis could help to decide either to perform a combined renal/liver transplantation, to adapt the immunosuppressive regimen, or to abandon the LT project. . Because serum creatinine is one of the components of MELD, liver candidates with renal insufficiency have been transplanted in increasing numbers, with some candidates receiving a kidney along with the liver transplant. We aimed to compare the liver graft outcomes for liver alone (LTA) transplants with those from combined liver-kidney transplants (CLKT). A propensity score analysis was used to reduce the impact of selection bias in the comparison of outcomes in the two groups. Methods. Demographics, clinical factors and outcomes on LTA and CLKT recipients from 3/1/02 to 12/31/06 (N=10,388) obtained from the OPTN database were used for the analysis. Univariate post-transplant survival rates were estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival, and multivariable post-transplant outcomes were analyzed using a Cox regression model with and without stratification by categories of the propensity score. The propensity score (probability of receiving a CLKT) for each recipient was estimated using a logistic regression model. Several donor and recipient factors were included in both the Cox and logistic regression models. In this cohort, liver graft outcomes for CLKT were significantly better than those for LTA based on the multivariable analysis. The results were similar, although slightly less significant, when the model was adjusted for propensity. The superior outcomes of CLKT may be due to unobserved differences between these groups of recipients, reflecting data not currently captured by the OPTN.",

Nataliya Zelikovsky. 1 1 Dept. of Pediatrics, Div. of Nephrology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA.Purpose: Little is known about psychosocial risk factors for poor adherence among pediatric transplant patients. Identification of variables that impact illness management can guide targeted interventions to improve adherence. Methods: A longitudinal study was conducted to determine whether quality of life (PedsQL), family functioning (FAD), and parent adjustment (PIP) would predict adherence in adolescent transplant patients. Psychological questionnaires were administered prior to and 12 months after the transplant. Medical Adherence Measure (MAM), a semi-structured interview was used to assess adherence. Adherence was calculated as % missed and % late doses of those prescribed. Results: 60 patients (M =14.32 years +2.18, 75% male, 63% Caucasian) and their parents were evaluated at the time of listing for kidney transplant. The rate of non-adherence prior to transplant was high, with 90% of patients reporting some degree of nonadherence. Of these patients, 37% missed and 28% took late > 10% of prescribed doses. On the quality of life measure, behavior issues were associated with missed (r=-.42, p=.01) and late doses (r=-.39, p<.05), and mental health issues were associated with late doses (r=-.38, p<.05). Adolescent reports of problems in affective responsiveness among family members was associated with missed (r=.33, p=.04) and late (r=.51, p=.001) doses. Missed doses were also associated with mother reports of difficulties with overall family functioning (r=.34, p<.05), communication (r=.41, p<.01) and role definitions (r=.33, p<.05) among family members. 49 of the families were re-evaluated one year after the kidney transplant. 65% had been on dialysis prior to transplant and 42% received living-related transplants. 58% of the patients reported some degree non-adherence post-transplant, and using more stringent criteria, 17% of patients reported missing and 27% reported taking late >10% of prescribed doses. Worse quality of life such as limitations due to emotional problems (r=-.32, p<.05), behavioral problems (r=-.39, p<.01), and difficulties with family cohesion (r=-.32, p<.05) was related to worse adherence. Discussion: Adolescent quality of life in behavioral and emotional domains, and family functioning play a significant role in adherence both before and after transplant. Programs to improve adherence among transplant patients should incorporate psychosocial supports and behavioral interventions to improve adjustment of patients and families. Kidney transplantation leads to marked improvements in health, yet transplant (tx) recipients often have difficulty with sexual functioning, which can affect quality of life. Specific sexual concerns of tx recipients remain under investigated. The purposes of this study were to 1) further establish the psychometric properties of the sexual concerns questionnaire (SCQ) including reliability and preliminary construct validity and 2) identify the sexual concerns of kidney tx recipients. The SCQ was answered by 390 kidney tx recipients who rated each item on a 0 (not at all) to 5 (extremely) scale. A Cronbach's alpha correlation coefficient was calculated to determine the reliability of the SCQ. An alpha value of .83 was calculated for the questionnaire indicating it was reliable. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed to establish preliminary construct validity of the SCQ. As a result from the EFA, 14 items were dropped and a 5 factor structure was accepted. Examples of items and responses include Question 1: \"How difficult is it for your vagina to get or stay wet or moist?\" (for women) and \"How difficult is it for you to get or keep an erection?\" (for men)",

Poor sleep quality was reported by 68% and 79% of pre-and post-LT patients, respectively. Pre-LT fatigue was predicted by higher BMI (\u00df = 0.21) and MELD (\u00df = 0.20), depression (\u00df = 0.35), and poor sleep quality (\u00df = 0.48), adj R 2 = 0.44, F = 10.72, p < 0.0001.

More fatigue was associated with lower SF-36 physical (r = -0.34) and mental (r = -0.44) QOL. Conclusions. Fatigue and poor sleep quality are clinically significant problems for LT candidates and recipients. BMI, psychological functioning and sleep quality are modifiable variables that predict fatigue severity and should be targets of intervention when addressing fatigue symptoms.",

            "text": "Health Literacy in Kidney Transplant Recipients. Elisa J. Gordon, 1 Michael S. Wolf. 2 1 Medicine, Albany Medical Center, Albany, NY; 2 Medicine, Northwestern University. Background: In order to successfully manage the transplant long-term, kidney recipients must have a basic understanding of key transplant-related concepts and terms indicative of their condition and treatment to properly communicate with health care providers and manage their health. Kidney recipients must also possess numeracy skills to enable proper medication-taking and to monitor serum creatinine levels, bodily temperature, etc. The objective of this study was to examine health literacy levels among kidney transplant recipients. Methods: We surveyed 124 consecutive adult renal transplant recipients using the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA), and a modified version of the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine, called the \"REALM-Transplant,\" which measured patients' knowledge of 69 kidney transplant-related terms that patients are expected to have familiarity with. Open-ended and multiple choice questions assessed numeracy related to kidney survival. Results: Most kidney recipients (91%) had adequate health literacy (S-TOFHLA), but 81% were unfamiliar with at least 1 kidney transplant-related term (REALM-T). Patients who were less educated (p<0.0001), had lower income (p<0.002), and were single or without a partner (p=0.046) had significantly lower health literacy levels (S-TOFHLA). Patients less familiar with transplant-related terms (REALM-T) had less education (p<0.0001), lower income (p<0.0001), and were nonwhites (p=0.033). The five least familiar terms were: sensitization (50%), urethra (45%), trough level (41%), blood urea nitrogen (32%), and toxicity (31%). Sixteen percent wanted more information about their transplant. Numeracy levels varied: 21% knew the likelihood of 1-year survival; 29% knew that half of kidney recipients have problems with the transplant in the first 6 months; 86% knew the normal range of creatinine for kidney recipients; and 86% were aware of the risk of death within the first year of transplantation. Conclusion: At this clinic, kidney transplant recipients generally had high levels of health literacy. However, most had difficulty recognizing frequently used transplantrelated terms, which could impede their understanding of health information and self-care management. Greater efforts are needed to educate kidney recipients about transplant concepts, which may foster better self-care management, and ultimately transplant outcomes. Abstracts by a single pathologist using the Banff, CADI and CNIT classifications. All indication biopsies with clinical acute rejection (AR; 23.3% for SF and 21.4% for SB) were excluded from this analysis. The histological and clinical parameters were assessed using multivariate generalized-estimating-equations statistical analysis. Results: Subclinical AR was present in 12.2% SF vs. 8.5% SB bx at 6 mo and 0% SF vs 5% SB bx at 12 mo (p=NS); borderline AR was seen in 2.4% SF vs. 8.5% SB bx at 6 mo and 10% SF vs. 5% SB bx at 12 mo (p=NS). Despite the pristine condition of the kidneys at implantation, regardless of steroid exposure, there was a significant trend increase (p<0.0001) in chronic tubulo-interstitial damage; 35% of 6 mo bx and 53% of 12 mo bx demonstrated IFTA; with moderate/severe changes (IFTA grade 2-3) in 6.8% and 10% of 6 and 12 mo bx respectively. The prevalence of biopsies with ischemic glomerular changes (p<0.0001), tubular microcalcifications (p=0.009), vascular intimal thickening (p=0.0008) and the number of sclerosed glomeruli (p<0.0001) increased over the first year after transplantation, without any difference between the SB and SF group. A critical risk factor for IFTA injury by multivariate analysis, independent of time after transplantation, was smaller recipient size.",

Methods: 960 patients participated in an optional follow-up of 2 years. GFR data from 79% of included patients (48% of the core ITT population) were available at 3 years.Here we present results in the ITT population. Results: At inclusion into follow-up 47%, 34% and 17% of patients received CsA, tacrolimus or sirolimus, and at 3 years 37%, 31% and 14%, respectively. Many follow-up patients had been switched to tacrolimus in the 1st year, including 24% of patients randomized to sirolimus. At 3 years 95% of patients were on MMF and 69% on steroids.Over the 2nd and 3rd year all arms had a low rate of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR; 2-4%) and of graft loss (3-5%). Low-dose tacrolimus remained clearly superior in terms of BPAR (13% vs. 26%-38% in the other arms). Uncensored 3-year graft survival was 89% with low-dose tacrolimus and low-dose CsA, 87% with standarddose CsA and 85% with low-dose sirolimus (p=0.19). Patient survival was between 94% and 97% (p=0.52). In the four arms, the mean GFR change over the 2 nd and 3 rd year was between +1 and -3 ml/min and low-dose tacrolimus still had the highest GFR (69 vs 64-66 ml/min, p=0.15).",

We hypothesize that gene expression analysis could provide additional information to determine graft outcome in the first year of transplantation. To this end, we evaluated all 49 implantation biopsies obtained post reperfusion in 18 deceased donors (DD) and 31 living donors (LD) at our center. Biopsies were evaluated and scored using Banff criteria. Low density real time PCR arrays were utilized to measure intragraft expression of 95 genes associated with programmed cell death, fibrosis, innate and adaptive immunity, and oxidative stress signaling. Results of expression were defined as folds compared to a pool of 25 normal kidney biopsies. In DD, histological features of ATN were more common (44%) than in LD grafts (6%; p<0.001), whereas arteriosclerosis was infrequent in both groups (6% and 15%, respectively), as well as the extent of glomerular sclerosis (0% and 2%). There was no association between these histological features and renal function at 1 year post transplant. Not surprisingly, DD grafts displayed a pattern of gene expression remarkably different from LD, including an increased expression of complement protein C3 ( Background: ISA247 is a novel calcineurin inhibitor (CNi), developed using a pharmacodynamic approach for use in autoimmune disease and solid organ transplantation. In moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, a Canadian Phase III trial has demonstrated that ISA247 is efficacious with minimal changes to renal function and a European trial is presently underway comparing ISA247 to cyclosporine A (CsA).In renal transplantation, a Phase IIa study comparing ISA247 to CsA in stable renal transplant recipients demonstrated ISA247 to be efficacious and well tolerated. A Phase IIb study in de novo renal transplant patients comparing ISA247 to tacrolimus is ongoing and final data will be available May 2008. We hypothesize that ISA247 is non-inferior to tacrolimus in terms of efficacy.Methods: This is a 6 month, randomized, multicenter, open-label, concentrationcontrolled study comparing three oral ISA247 dosing groups (0.4, 0.6, or 0.8 mg/kg bid) to tacrolimus in 42 North American transplant centres. All CNi's were titrated to target trough concentrations. Inclusion criteria included males and (non-pregnant) females between the ages of 18-65 who were receiving a first deceased or living donor renal transplant. Cold ischemia times were to be \u2264 24 hours, and peak panel reactive antibodies \u2264 30%. The primary efficacy parameter of the trial is non-inferiority (in at least one dose group) in biopsy proven acute rejection (BPAR) at 6 months as compared to tacrolimus. Secondary objectives include: renal function; PK/PD relationships; patient and graft survival; and proportion of patients with hypertension, hyperlipidemia or new onset diabetes mellitus (NODM).Results: Interim data, as previously presented at the 2007 ATC, demonstrated that ISA247 had rejection rates similar to tacrolimus (ISA247 0.4 mg/kg bid 11%, ISA247 0.6 mg/kg bid 8%, ISA247 0.8 mg/kg bid 3%, tacrolimus 9%) and confirmed previous results indicating an improved safety profile. 334 patients have now been enrolled between January 2006 and June 2007, with an optional extension to 12 months added to the trial. A recent approval by both FDA and Health Canada has allowed continued use of ISA247 in these patients until commercialization. The six month final results will be available for presentation at ATC 2008.",
