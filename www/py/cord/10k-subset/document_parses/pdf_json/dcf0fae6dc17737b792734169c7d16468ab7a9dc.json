Hospital-acquired infection was defined as symptom onset 3 or more days after hospital admission. 9 The presence of co-pathogens was defined as the isolation of pathogenic bacterial species, fungal species, or other opportunistic viruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), from the respiratory specimen obtained within a month of detection of a CRV, in conjunction with consistent symptoms, and as confirmed by infectious disease specialists. 5 Proven or probable invasive fungal disease was defined according to the criteria of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group Consensus Group in 2008. 11 A mixed CRV infection was defined by the isolation of more than two CRVs during the same episode. Mortality due to LRDs caused by CRVs was defined as death resulting from respiratory failure, with no period of complete recovery between the onset of illness and death within 30 days, and without a documented copathogen. 12 Overall mortality was defined as death from any cause within 30 days following diagnosis of CRV-LRD.

Known risk factors of RSV-associated mortality in SCT patients included pre-engraftment, lymphopenia, alloSCT <1 month previously, SID, and an older age (>65 years). 14, 19 The highest incidence of RSV occurred between January and April, which is consistent with our result that the majority of RSV-LRDs were detected between December and March. 20 Symptomatic HPIV infections have been reported to occur in 1.4-7.1% of adult SCT recipients in previous studies. 5, 21, 22 The reported frequency and mortality rates of HPIV-LRDs among SCT recipients were 0.05-8.1% and 11.8-46%, respectively. 5, 6, 9, 10, [22] [23] [24] The 30-day mortality rate of HPIV-LRD at our center, 26.3% (5/19) , was similar to that of previous studies, despite the low rate of antiviral treatment (36.8%).

Another limitation was that it was difficult to determine whether the fatal outcome was solely attributable to the CRV or due to a combination of the CRV and co-pathogens. However, precise discrimination of the pathogen would likely have been meaningless, since damage to the respiratory epithelium as a result of a CRV infection may have been the key factor that facilitated the occurrence of superinfections. 9 Recent studies showed that viral nucleic acid was detected in the bloodstream more frequently among SCT recipients with LRDs caused by influenza, RSV, HAdV, and HMPV, and that this was associated with increased mortality rates.
