Transmitted by infected rodents and their excreta, Hantavirus are identified as etiologic agents of two main types of diseases-Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the latter having a fatality rate of above 40 %. Although considerable research for over two decades has been going on in this area, bibliometric studies to gauge the state of research of this field have been rare. An analysis of 2631 articles, extracted from WoS databases on Hantavirus between 1980 and 2014, indicated a progressive increase (R 2 = 0.93) in the number of papers over the years, with the majority of papers being published in the USA and Europe. About 95 % papers were co-authored and the most common arrangement was 4-6 authors per paper. Co-authorship has seen a steady increase (R 2 = 0.57) over the years. We apply research collaboration network analysis to investigate the best-connected authors in the field. The author-based networks have 49 components (connected clump of nodes) with 7373 vertices (authors) and 49,747 edges (co-author associations) between them. The giant component (the largest component) is healthy, occupying 84.19 % or 6208 vertices with 47,117 edges between them. By using edge-weight threshold, we drill down into the network to reveal bonded communities. We find three communities' hotspotsone, led by researchers at University of Helsinki, Finland; a second, led by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, USA; and a third, led by Hokkaido University, Japan. Significant correlation was found between author's structural position in the network and research performance, thus further supporting a well-studied phenomenon that centrality effects research productivity.

Since the isolation of the first hanta virus, HTNV (or Hantaan Virus) in 1976, several other Hantaviruses have been identified, with at least 22 being pathogenic to humans (Bi et al. 2008) . One of the first major outbreaks of HantaVirus was reported from 1951 to 1954 when close of 3200 American soldiers serving in Korea became infected with the virus. In recent times, several cases have been reported in Asia (Zhang et al. 2004) , US, and Europe. HantaVirus genus belongs to Bunyaviridae family and is identified as an etiologic agent of two different types of diseases-Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome or HFRS and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). HFRS is also known by earlier names like Korean hemorrhagic fever (KHF), epidemic hemorrhagic fever (EHF), nephropathia epidemica (NE) (Bi et al. 2008) . HPRS affects close to 1,50,000-2,00,000 people throughout the world each year while HPS infects just about 200. However, the fatalities caused by the latter are above 40 % when compared to 1-12 % in the case of HPRS depending on the severity of the virus (Lednicky 2003; Schmaljohn and Hjelle 1997) . HFRS is more prevalent in the Eurasian region and HPS in the Americas. China remains the most endemic nation accounting for close to 70-90 % HFRS cases in the world (Zhang et al. 2004) .

Better communications facilities, faster commuting, and industrialization brought in significant changes in the way research was conducted. Now there are researchers in large teams working on research projects and naturally these lead to published papers having significantly larger numbers of co-authors. Price (1963) calls these large lab-based research projects, 'big science'. However, big science research projects aren't generally in the social domain, that is, researchers do not have much choice to decide on their co-authors. Like the sciences, research conducted in the social sciences has also seen significant increase in the number of co-authors (Moody 2004) .

In a network, two entities form a connection if there is some kind of association between them (Newman 2001) . Using bibliometric data, these associations could be constructed to understand knowledge flows at multiple levels. Co-authorship in published papers is considered a reliable proxy to gauge research collaborations (Sonnenwald 2008; Melin and Persson 1996; Katz and Martin 1997) . Social Network Analysis, an established research method to analyse social networks, is a set of mathematical algorithms that quantitatively analyse these relationships between nodes (Wasserman and Faust 1994) . In a co-authorship network, for example, it could be applied to identify various patterns-i.e. the best connected nodes or key actors (Taba et al. 2015) or the communities that the researchers form through their associations. Specifically, these analyses reveal the pattern of network at both global and local levels. At the global level, the network pattern is seen from a whole network perspective, revealing, for example, the density, transitivity, scale-free pattern, small-world pattern, or the communities or clusters that the nodes form. At the local level, things are seen from the node perspective. Centrality is an important concept when looking from the perspective of a node and its context in the entire network. Centrality determines the relative importance (through centrality measures such as betweenness, closeness, and PageRank) and connectedness (through 'degree' metric) of nodes. Hence, those with higher centrality scores are those who are the most prominent players in the network. Another interesting aspect of social networks is that of the ties that the node is directly connected to. The strength of connection (depicted by a thicker line on a network graph) demonstrates a more frequent and stronger relationship than those that have an association of just a single or very few times. The idea of strength of relationship (Coleman 1988 ) is challenged by the notion of structural holes (Burt 1997) . Structural holes theory postulates that the absence of ties in an ego network (network of ego-central node-and alters or immediate connections and those immediate connections connecting to one another) brings in more opportunities to the ego (the central node) as the ego then acts a bridge for the flow of resources between the 'alters'. Yet another idea of ties is postulated by the concept of 'weak ties'. The theory argues that in contrast to strong ties, which bring in trust, weak ties bring in new knowledge in the network. Growth and preferential attachment are the prime features of self-organising networks (Barabasi and Bonabeau 2003) . Preferential attachment (Kumar and Jan 2015) is defined by the preference of nodes (due to affinity or similarity) to attach to another node. In the context of co-authorship network, it may be due to the fact that one author connects to another author because he or she is a well-known researcher or has the same nationality as others. Preferential attachment causes some nodes to have much higher number of connections than most other nodes in the network. These hubs are kind of 'power houses' that tie together the network. This is the very reason why a self-organising network are small worlds (has a short path between any two random nodes) (Watts and Strogatz 1998) . A targeted attack or absence due to some other reason could break the network down into pieces, which could severely affect the flow of resources in the network. Nonetheless, these self-organising networks are quite tolerant to random attacks (Albert et al. 2000) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 76, "end": 96, "text": "(Kumar and Jan 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 194, "end": 207, "text": "(Newman 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 423, "end": 440, "text": "(Sonnenwald 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 441, "end": 464, "text": "Melin and Persson 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 465, "end": 486, "text": "Katz and Martin 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 671, "end": 697, "text": "(Wasserman and Faust 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 834, "end": 852, "text": "(Taba et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2050, "end": 2063, "text": "(Coleman 1988", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2114, "end": 2125, "text": "(Burt 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2745, "end": 2773, "text": "(Barabasi and Bonabeau 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2800, "end": 2820, "text": "(Kumar and Jan 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3422, "end": 3447, "text": "(Watts and Strogatz 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 3693, "end": 3713, "text": "(Albert et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Research collaboration networks (RCN)"}, {"text": "Why do researchers collaborate?

On the other hand, an author may have different name variations and his or her publication may get split across these different name variations. At the institution and country levels, there is a need to make the names uniform. For example, in the present set of records, at the institution level, USA actually is an abbreviation of ''US Army''.

As mentioned earlier, a network could be constructed when two entities are related in some way. On the graph, nodes are represented by a 'dot' and the connection between nodes, as a line passing between them. Hence, if two or more authors associate to co-write a research paper, the authors would be represented as nodes and the co-authored paper (the basis of relationship) is represented with a line passing between them. Nodes are also referred to as 'vertices' and relationship between them as 'edges'. It is obvious that just one representation of co-authored with dots and lines on a graph does not reveal much but when hundreds and (at times thousands) of papers are represented in a graph, an interplay of association is revealed and how seemingly invisible associations become visible.

Their study showed that the Scientometrics (2016) 109:533-550 541 comparison of the human and rodent sequences had a direct genetic link between the virus in infected rodents and infected human 'hantaviral ARDS' cases. On the heels of this study was another highly cited paper by Duchin et al. (1994) or NE) and highly cited paper is that of Brummerkorvenkontio et al. (1980) . Their study concluded that the detection of NE antigen in rodents (bank voles) facilitates 'specific serologic diagnosis of NE'.

A healthy giant component may be an indication of frequent collaborative activity. The giant component is considered the seat of main activity in the research community (Fatt et al. 2010) . Knowledge flows in such networks are faster as they are not subject to disruptions which otherwise would have been the case had the giant component been small and the whole network having several small fragments of components. A recent study by Liu and Xia (2015) found that the development of an inter-disciplinary field is The giant components continue to grow as more components connect to it. After all, it takes just an edge from a disconnected component to connect to the giant component, thus, making the latter bigger in size. The average geodesic distance (shortest distance between any two random nodes in the network) between the nodes is just 4.15 meaning that, on average, two random authors in the hantavirus dataset are just about four hops away from one another. This is another indication that the authors are closely knit and resource flow and delivery would be faster in this network when compared to networks that are sparse and fragmented.

Similarly, 295 institutions have contributed two publications and 145 institutions have contributed three publications. A power law pattern is seen here where a large number of institutions (about 87 %) have contributed just 1-3 publications each and few institutions (299 institutions or about 13 %) have contributed four or more publications. Ten institutions have over 50 papers each. The highest number of institutions doing research on HantaVirus is located in the USA (411 institutions), followed by 246 institutions in China.

Mathematically, clustering coefficient is calculated as:where the number of triangles represents trios of nodes in which each node is connected to both others, and connected triples represent trios of nodes in which at least one node is connected to both others (Barabasi et al. 2002; Newman 2004) . Degree is the most common and probably the most effective centrality measure to determine both the influence and importance of a node. A degree is simply the number of edges incident on the vertex.
