Our objective was to quantify the difference between shortterm and long-term mortality in ARDS and to identify risk factors for death and causes of death at 1 year among hospital survivors. Methods: This multi-intensive care unit, prospective cohort included patients with ARDS enrolled between January 2006 and February 2010. We determined the clinical characteristics associated with in-hospital and 1-year mortality among hospital survivors and utilized death certificate data to identify causes of death. Results: Of 646 patients hospitalized with ARDS, mortality at 1 year was substantially higher (41 %, 95 % CI 37-45 %) than in-hospital mortality (24 %, 95 % CI 21-27 %), P \\ 0.0001. Among 493 patients who survived to hospital discharge, the 110 (22 %) who died in the subsequent year were older (P \\ 0.001) and more likely to have been discharged to a nursing home, other hospital, or hospice compared to patients alive at 1 year (P \\ 0.001). Important predictors of death among hospital survivors were comorbidities present at the time of ARDS, and not living at home prior to admission. ARDS-related measures of severity of illness did not emerge as independent predictors of mortality in hospital survivors.

In a recent study of Medicare patients, ICU survivors had higher 3-year mortality than non-ICU hospital survivors or non-hospitalized controls, and a separate study showed that critically ill patients have decreased ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome, HIV human immunodeficiency virus, SD standard deviation, APACHE acute physiology and chronic health evaluation, LIS lung injury score * P value compares values in patients who died in the hospital to those who survived hospitalization but died in the first year P value compares values in hospital survivors who died at 1 year versus those alive at 1 year a Leukemia including chronic, acute, and following stem cell transplant b PaO 2 /FiO 2 missing in 142 patients; SpO 2 /FiO 2 used as surrogate survival for up to 15 years compared to age-and sexmatched population controls [40, 41] . Furthermore, predictors of long-term outcomes for critically ill patients are similar to those we observed in ARDS, with comorbidities as top predictors for subsequent re-hospitalization and death [41] . One possible explanation for the persistently high risk of death in patients with critical illness includes a persistent pro-inflammatory state that may exacerbate or trigger other underlying inflammatory disorders including cardiovascular disease, recurrent infection, cancer, and renal failure-all common causes of death among patients in our study who survived to hospital discharge.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 328, "end": 332, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1171, "end": 1175, "text": "[40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1179, "text": "41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1379, "end": 1383, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This study has several strengths including the large sample size, broad patient population with few exclusion criteria, and the careful prospective phenotyping for ALI/ ARDS, sepsis, and other important clinical variables.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Because there were very few exclusion criteria for enrollment in VALID, the findings are likely to be generalizable. The study also has some limitations. First, it is a single-center study. However, this is counterbalanced by the broad spectrum of heterogeneous critically ill patients from four different intensive care units included. Second, it is possible that we underestimated the 1-year mortality rate of ARDS survivors; although the SSDI has been shown to be a valuable tool for determining long-term outcomes [39] , some patients without social security numbers may not be included. Third, mortality does not capture the full burden of disease. Long-term sequelae of ARDS, including impaired pulmonary function, neuromuscular weakness, and neuropsychiatric are well described [15, [42] [43] [44] [45] . However, these limitations would have led us to underestimate rather than overestimate The differences in survival across groups are statistically significant (P \\ 0.001) driven by significantly increased 1-year mortality among patients discharged to hospice (P \\ 0.001), nursing home (P \\ 0.001), and other hospital (P = 0.03) compared to discharge to home ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 518, "end": 522, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 785, "end": 789, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 790, "end": 794, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 795, "end": 799, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 800, "end": 804, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 805, "end": 809, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Long-term mortality is substantially higher than shortterm mortality in a broad sample of patients with ARDS.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "In spite of improvements in supportive care and significantly improved short-term outcomes, long-term outcomes remain poor. The top predictors of 1-year mortality in hospital survivors include non-modifiable factors including age and comorbidities, and the most common causes of death are malignancy and infection. These results underscore the importance of considering the interaction between comorbid illness and ARDS on the trajectory of long-term outcomes in hospital survivors of ARDS for testing new interventions and providing prognoses. Researchers must measure whether effects of interventions can influence the overall trajectory of survival in ARDS patients who do and do not have major comorbidities. Possible clinical applications of such research include improved guidance of initial discussions of prognosis and the benefits of full resuscitation for highrisk patients. For clinical trials, it is perhaps more realistic to target shorter-term endpoints such as 30-to 90-day mortality, since 1-year mortality will be driven primarily by comorbidities that cannot be reversed or influenced by treatments for increasing survival from ARDS such as lung protective or prone ventilation.
