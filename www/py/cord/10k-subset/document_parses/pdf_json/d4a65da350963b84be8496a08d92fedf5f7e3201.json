concerns that they might cause human epidemics and pandemics. However, how these viruses adapt to mammalian hosts is unclear. Here we show that besides the commonly recognized viral polymerase subunit PB2 residue 627 K, other residues including 87E, 292 V, 340 K, 588 V, 648 V, and 676 M in PB2 also play critical roles in mammalian adaptation of the H10N8 virus. The avian-origin H10N8, H7N9, and H9N2 viruses harboring PB2-588 V exhibited higher polymerase activity, more efficient replication in mammalian and avian cells, and higher virulence in mice when compared to viruses with PB2-588 A. Analyses of available PB2 sequences showed that the proportion of avian H9N2 or human H7N9 influenza isolates bearing PB2-588 V has increased significantly since 2013. Taken together, our results suggest that the substitution PB2-A588V may be a new strategy for an avian influenza virus to adapt mammalian hosts.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) is an important zoonotic pathogen that infects mammals and birds and induces seasonal influenza epidemics and pandemics in humans. IAV is a negative-sense, single-stranded, segmented RNA virus that belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae. Antigenic drift (mutation) and antigenic shift (reassortment) are responsible for the rapid evolution of IAV, resulting in influenza outbreaks cannot easily be controlled despite annual vaccination efforts in human and animal populations 1, 2 . The major natural host species of IAV are aquatic birds, in which 16 hemagglutinin (HA) and 9 neuraminidase (NA) subtype viruses are circulating, representing a large IAV gene pool 3 . The 1957 The , 1968 IAV pandemics are directly related to avian influenza viruses (AIV) that provide genes resulting in generation of pandemic influenza viruses 4 . Normally, avian influenza viruses do not infect humans directly due to differences in affinity for the host receptors. Since the first human infection with a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus was reported in Hong Kong in 1997 5, 6 , this virus subtype has caused more than 800 human infections with 50% case fatality rate (WHO). AIV infection of humans usually causes conjunctivitis, mild respiratory disorders, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death 7, 8 . The cross of species barriers to humans by AIV poses a significant threat for public health since most people do not have existing immunity to emerging influenza viruses 5,9 . The first human infection with an H7N9 virus occurred in March 2013, in eastern China 10 . By February 23, 2015, 571 confirmed H7N9 human infections had been reported to the WHO, with a 37% case fatality rate. On December 17, 2013 , the first human infection with a novel H10N8 avian influenza virus was reported in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province 11 . Subsequently, another 2 cases were identified and 2 of these 3 H10N8-infected patients died due to severe pneumonia and complications. There are several common features between these H7N9 and H10N8 viruses. Both viruses are novel reassortants in which their HA and NA genes most likely originated from a virus in ducks or wild birds while their six internal genes (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, NS) are derived Scientific RepoRts | 6:19474 | DOI: 10 .1038/srep19474 from endemic H9N2 influenza viruses circulating in poultry [12] [13] [14] . The human infections are closely associated with the local live poultry market (LPM), and the closure of LPM seems to be an effective control measure 15, 16 .

The best example is the influenza virus polymerase subunit PB2 in which several mutations have been identified as contributing to the virulence and adaptation in mammalian hosts. One well-characterized mutation in PB2 is the glutamate change to lysine at position 627 (E627K) 22 that results in efficient virus replication in mammalian cells and enhanced virulence in mammals [23] [24] [25] . This mutation is found in several subtypes of AIVs including H5N1, H7N7, and H9N2 viruses. Another well-known substitution D701N in PB2 is primarily found in a duck H5N1 virus that was highly pathogenic to mice 26, 27 . This mutation promotes H7N7 virus replication in mammalian cells by strengthening the interaction between PB2 and importin-\u03b1 1, thereby increasing the transport of PB2 into the nucleus 28 . In addition, the mutation S714R coupled with 701 N in PB2 increases the polymerase activity of the avian H5N1 influenza virus in human cells and enhances virulence in mice 29 . Several other residues, including 147 T, 339 T, 526 R, and 588 T were also found to play essential roles in avian H5N1 influenza virus virulence in mice 30, 31 .
