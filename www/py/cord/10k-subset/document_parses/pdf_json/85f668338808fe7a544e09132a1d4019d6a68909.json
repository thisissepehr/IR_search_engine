Virus-induced CCL5 and activation of CCR5 are required to prevent apoptosis of influenza virus-infected mouse macrophages in vivo and of human macrophages ex vivo [28] . Therefore, we determined whether the expression of chemokine receptors differed between virus-infected adult and neonatal MDMs. Chemokine receptors could bind several members of the same chemokine subgroup with high affinity.

Furthermore, significantly higher expression of CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL10 was found in response to avian influenza viruses, compared with human influenza viruses (figures 2 and 4).

Strikingly, the fold increase in CCL3 expression in H5N1/97-infected adult MDMs was significantly higher than that in neonatal MDMs ( figure 3) . The detrimental effects of CCL3 have been widely studied in viral infections. Higher CCL3, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-1 levels have been found in plasma from patients with fatal H5N1 infection than in plasma from survivors [14] . Elevated CCL3 and IFN-g levels have been detected in inflammatory tissues from patients with infection-induced hemophagocytic syndrome [33] . Additionally, levels of CCL3, but not of other CC che- mokines (CCL2 and CCL5), have been found to be higher in nasopharyngeal secretions from infants with more-severe hypoxic bronchiolitis due to influenza virus [34] . It has been found that less mononuclear cell infiltration and pulmonary edema occurs in gene-deficient CCL3 \u03ea/\u03ea mice than in wild-type mice during respiratory virus infection [35, 36] . The higher CCL3 response in adult MDMs may be one of the important factors responsible for the age-related severity of avian influenza virus infection in 1997. Both CCR1 and CCR5 are able to bind CCL3. The process by which human monocytes mature into tissue macrophages is accompanied by a loss in CCR2 expression, an increase in expression of CCR1 and CCR5, and an enhanced functional response to CCL3 [37, 38] . During influenza virus infection, CCL3 may primarily function through CCR1 or CCR4, and its interaction with CCR5 is limited [39] . Moreover, activation of CCR1 is an early event in the systemic inflammatory response and occurs in various cell types [40, 41] . The trafficking of myeloid cells and neutrophils is disordered in CCR1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice [41] . Improved survival was detected in gene-deleted CCR1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice infected with pneumonia virus, compared with that in wild-type mice [42] . We detected the up-regulation of both CCR1 and CCR5 expression in avian virus H9N2/G1-infected adult MDMs; however, only CCR1 expression was up-regulated in H9N2/G1-infected neonatal MDMs (figure 5). These results suggested that the activation of CCR1 may be the major response in macrophages to avian influenza virus. In contrast to H5N1/97-infected adult MDMs, which had a several-fold increase in CCR1 and CCR5 production, H5N1/97-infected neo-natal MDMs had a minimal fold increase of CCR1 and CCR5 production at the 7-h POI (figure 6). The difference may be explained by delayed chemokine-receptor activation of neonatal MDMs in response to H5N1/97 virus, compared with that of adult MDMs, or by an intrinsically weaker response in neonatal MDMs. The latter is supported by the observation that there is an age-related increase of CCR5 expression in monocytes, lymphocytes, and NK cells [43] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 584, "end": 588, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 726, "end": 730, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 946, "end": 950, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1128, "end": 1132, "text": "[35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1133, "end": 1136, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1542, "end": 1546, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1547, "end": 1550, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1678, "end": 1682, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1803, "end": 1807, "text": "[40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1808, "end": 1811, "text": "41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1894, "end": 1898, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2030, "end": 2034, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2929, "end": 2933, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 197, "end": 206, "text": "figure 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 343, "end": 352, "text": "figure 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Via chemokine receptor CCR5, chemokines such as CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL6, and CCL8 exert their biological functions.

As is shown in our study, significantly higher expression of CCL5 was detected in avian influenza virus-infected human MDMs than in human influenza virus H1N1/ 98-infected MDMs (figures 2, 3, and 4). In human patients and mouse models, it has been found that the replication of H5N1 virus or H5N1 nonstructural gene reassortant virus is prolonged [14, 44] .
