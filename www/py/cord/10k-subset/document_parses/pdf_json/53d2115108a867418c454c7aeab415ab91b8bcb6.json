In viral diseases for which specific treatment is available, real-time PCR assays are reliable diagnostic tools for timely initiation of appropriate therapy and for rapid assessment of the efficacy of antiviral treatment strategies. A retrospective review of samples from a group of seven adult cord blood stem cell recipients was made. Serum samples taken up to 180 days after transplantation were examined with quantitative real-time PCR for measurement of viral load (CMV, HHV-6, and HHV-7). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA was detected in samples taken from four patients (57%) in the period of 20-80 days after transplantation. Products of amplification of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) DNA were found in samples taken between days 25 and 37 following UCBT from only one patient (14%). On the other hand, the majority of patients (n = 6, 86%) had HHV-7 DNA detected in the period 15-58 days after transplantation. Co-infection with HHV-7 was demonstrated at onset of all episodes of microbiologically confirmed CMV or HHV-6 infection. Our observations indicate that real-time PCR is not only useful for monitoring herpesviral infections in transplant recipients, but is also a powerful method for clarifying the relationships between the viral load and clinical symptoms.

Because of the inability to find suitable, HLA-matched hematopoietic stem cell donors in a significant proportion of patients, umbilical cord blood (UCB) is considered an alternative and widely accepted source of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation (Arcese et al. 2006; Brown and Boussiotis 2008) . A suitable cord blood unit can be found for the majority of patients, as the matching of HLA molecules is less strict, allowing for a match at only 8/10 HLA alleles. Moreover, UCB transplantation (UCBT) was shown to be associated with lower rates of graft-versushost disease (GvHD), which is one of the factors affecting transplant-related mortality. However, the major limitation of UCBT use in adults is the relatively low number of hematopoietic stem cells in a single unit, which significantly increases the risk of graft failure and infectious complications in the period of pancytopenia (Arcese et al. 2006; Tse and Laughlin 2005) . One of the strategies to overcome this problem is the simultaneous transplantation of multiple cord blood units, coming from various unrelated donors (transplantation of so-called mixed UCB) (Tse and Laughlin 2005) . While some strategies are in preclinical stages, others are at advanced phases of clinical trials (Arcese et al. 2006; Brown and Boussiotis 2008; Tse and Laughlin 2005) .
