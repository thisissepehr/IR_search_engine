These methods demonstrated acute Chlamydophila-induced diseases such as epizootic bovine abortion, as well as worldwide variable, but generally high, Chlamydophila seroprevalence. However, it was impossible to consistently detect the low levels of these organisms which were suspected to be present in endemic infections. Application of highly sensitive real-time PCR and ELISA methods for detection of Chlamydophila spp. DNA and of antibodies against Chlamydophila spp., respectively, in a series of prospective cohort studies revealed a high prevalence of Chlamydophila spp. genital infections in female calves (61%) and adult heifers (53%). These infections were acquired by extragenital transmission in the \u00a2rst weeks of life, and infection frequency was increased by crowding of the animals. A challenge study demonstrated that infection with C. abortus resulted in decreased fertility of heifers. The experimental use of a C. abortus vaccine provided evidence for immunoprotection against C. abortus-induced suppression of bovine fertility. The results of these investigations suggest that bovine Chlamydophila infection should be viewed more as pervasive, low-level infection of cattle than as rare, severe disease. Such infections proceed without apparent disease or with only subtle expressions of disease, but potentially have a large impact on bovine herd health and fertility.",

Investigations using modern ELISA and PCR techniques show a very di\u00a1erent picture of chlamydial infections in cattle.

The results also indicated that pregnancy results after uterine C. abortus or mock inoculation were strongly in\u00a3uenced by simultaneous cohort challenge, as well as by pre-challenge immunity against C. abortus, expressed as anti-C. abortus IgM serum antibodies. The experimental use of a C. abortus vaccine provided evidence for immunoprotection against C. abortusinduced suppression of bovine fertility (DeGraves et al., 2002) .

            "text": "Chlamydiae were \u00a2rst associated with disease of cattle (Bos taurus) when McNutt isolated intracellular organisms from cases of sporadic bovine encephalomyelitis in feedlot cattle (McNutt and Waller, 1940) . After chicken embryo and cell culture methods for chlamydiae became widely used around 1955, a number of studies worldwide documented chlamydiae in many acute diseases of cattle. A prominent example is epizootic bovine abortion, similar to classic ovine abortion caused by C. abortus. This disease was found worldwide in many countries including France (Hidiroglou and Prevost, 1959) , Germany (Schoop et al., 1965; Wehner and Wehr, 1980) , India (Nanda et al., 1992) , Japan (Kawakami et al., 1955; Nabeya et al., 1991) , the United Kingdom (Gri\u00a4ths et al., 1995) , and the USA (Storz et al., 1960) . The causal agent also caused epididymitis and seminal vesiculitis and was excreted in bull semen (Storz et al., 1968) . Chlamydial strains from ruminant abortion were identi\u00a2ed as serotype 1 of ruminant chlamydiae (Schachter et al., 1975) , biotype 1 (Spears and Storz, 1979) , immunotype 1 (Perez-Martinez and Storz, 1985) , or ompA type B577 . Recently, reclassi\u00a2cation as Chlamydophila abortus was proposed (Everett et al., 1999) . C. abortus has also been associated with bovine mastitis (Corner et al., 1968; Kaltenboeck et al., 1997b; R\u00d6nsholt and Basse, 1981; Wehnert et al., 1980) . A second chlamydial agent was associated with clinically severe bovine chlamydial disease manifestations including abortion, sporadic bovine encephalomyelitis, pneumonia, enteritis, polyarthritis, kerato-conjunctivitis, nephritis, or purulent endometritis (Bannister et al., 1962; Dyml, 1965; French and Snowdon, 1960; Ko\u00ab lbl and Psota, 1968; Romvary, 1964; White, 1965, Wilson and Thompson, 1968; Wittenbrink et al., 1988) . This chlamydial strain was diagnosed as serotype 2 of ruminant chlamydiae (Schachter et al., 1975) , biotype 2 (Spears and Storz, 1979) , immunotype 2 (Perez-Martinez and Storz, 1985) , ompA type LW613 , or C. pecorum (Fukushi and Hirai, 1992) . Recently, reclassi\u00a2cation as Chlamydophila pecorum was proposed (Everett et al., 1999) .",

Shewen (1980) summarized the status of our understanding of chlamydial infections in animals: Exceptionally, some animals may experience severe or even fatal disease as a result of chlamydial exposure. A well balanced host-parasite relationship represents the common nature of chlamydial infection. This long-lasting inapparent or`latent' state has been documented in several species: birds, cattle, guinea pigs, sheep and humans. Under circumstances of stress,`carrier' animals may shed the organisms in large numbers or may in fact lapse into clinical disease.'",

The major impediment has been the cumbersome nature and insensitivity of diagnostic procedures, particularly of the CFT for determination of seroprevalence of chlamydial infection in cattle (Kaltenboeck et al., 1997a; Perez-Martinez et al., 1986) . Only recently, several investigations reported high prevalence of chlamydial infection or of antibodies against chlamydiae in cattle, and linked these data with increased diseases such as abortion, endometritis, and fertility disorders (Cavirani et al., 2001; Domeika et al., 1994; Wang et al., 2001; Wittenbrink et al., 1988) . One of the main reasons that chlamydial infections of cattle are still not widely recognized is simply that insensitive diagnostic techniques give a misleading indication of the prevalence of these infections.",

The lack of sensitivity of the standard CFT is obvious in Figure 1 from research on synthetic antigen ELISAs for chlamydial antigens which compared these assays to the CFT (Kaltenboeck et al., 1997a) . In a random survey of 40 sera from Alabama cattle herds with abortion problems, ELISAs against peptides of the C. abortus major outer membrane protein or against recombinant chlamydial LPS invariably detected very high antibody levels. In fact, immunoglobulin-rich sera from gnotobiotic calves challenged with bovine coronavirus had to be used as negative controls because it was impossible to \u00a2nd any other Chlamydophila-negative bovine sera. In comparison, the CFT titers of all but one serum sample were negative. The single positive serum had a low titer of 1:10 ( Figure 1 ).",

Following initial reports that PCR detection of chlamydial DNA was possible, speci\u00a2c, and sensitive (Hewinson et al., 1997; Kaltenboeck et al., 1997b) , the limitations of early PCR methods were recognized: (1) nested PCR methods were necessary to maximize sensitivity and speci\u00a2city; and (2) the quantity and stability of the specimen imposes major constraints on the detection limits of the methods (DeGraves et al., 2003b) . Therefore, such PCR methods, while an improvement, are problematic because they lack the robustness needed for routine diagnostic application or large scale research.",

Results of epidemiological studies may thus range from low single digit to above 50% prevalence for bovine vaginal Chlamydophila spp. infection. For reliable and comparable data it will be imperative to standardize the overall methodology of PCR testing. The high seroprevalence of chlamydiae in cattle, con\u00a2rmed by chlamydial genomic DNA prevalence data, poses the challenge of determining the health consequences, if any, of these endemic infections. Economic losses caused by late-term C. abortus infection and subsequent epizootic bovine abortion are readily apparent. However, infection may result in unrecognized economic losses as the consequence of subclinical infertility (Bowen et al., 1978) . Bovine infertility associated with C. abortus and C. pecorum infection has been addressed, but not extensively characterized (Jones et al., 1998; Storz et al., 1968 Storz et al., , 1976 Wehner and Wehr, 1980; Wittenbrink et al., 1988 Wittenbrink et al., , 1993 . It is recognized that bulls can shed C. abortus in semen; that breeding bulls which shed C. abortus in semen have decreased fertility; that semen spiked with C. abortus is associated with reduced fertility; and that uterine challenge with C. abortus can cause metritis. As described above, cattle typically experience a \u00a2rst infection with Chlamydophila spp. at an early age without any clinical signs of disease, and respond by establishing immune responses as evidenced by sustained high antibody levels.",

Twenty heifers responding with estrus in the \u00a2rst challenge round were inseminated with the semen of a bull with high fertility, and simultaneously received an intracervical challenge of 0, 10 4 , 10 5 , 10 6 , or 10 8 inclusion forming units (IFU) of C. abortus type strain B577 (Storz, 1966) via the cervix. Two weeks later, the remaining 10 heifers were injected again, and similarly bred and inoculated in the second challenge round. Pregnancy was determined after 42 days by rectal palpation. Second-round heifers were considered cohort-challenged at the time of insemination by contact with C. abortus-shedding \u00a2rst-round animals. Pregnancy results indicated that the highest challenge dose abolished fertility, demonstrating that previous infection and established immunity against C. abortus did not protect against chlamydial disease . The data also indicated that pregnancy results at lower uterine challenge were strongly in\u00a3uenced by concomitant cohort challenge, as well as by the level of pre-challenge immunity against C. abortus, expressed as pre-challenge anti-C. abortus IgM serum antibodies. Logistic regression modeling predicted fertility of heifers challenged with C. abortus (Figure 2 ).

A leading candidate for a vaccine, the major outer membrane protein (MOMP), has been tested as a genetic vaccine in several host species with variable and inconclusive results (Pal et al., 1999; Tan et al., 1990) . The authors chose expression library immunization (ELI) for identi\u00a2cation of protective vaccine candidate genes (Barry et al., 1995) . ELI is an unbiased whole-genome approach in which pools of expression plasmids containing inserts from the C. abortus genome were tested in a mouse pneumonia model for the ability to confer protection against challenge infection. Pools of protective plasmids were fractionated into smaller pools, until single protective gene candidates were tested (Stemke-Hale et al., in press) . Five gene fragments conferred protection at levels as good or better than the live-vaccine control of mice that had received a low-level respiratory C. abortus inoculation one month prior to the high-dose challenge inoculation. Four of these fragments (dnaX 2 , gatA, gatC, pbp3) encoded peptides of cytosolic proteins; only one (pmp5) encoded a peptide of an outer membrane protein, traditionally considered the best vaccine candidates. The dnaX 2 fragment, encoding a portion of the C. abortus DNA polymerase, completely protected mice from C. abortus disease, better than the best protection achieved with live vaccination by low-level intranasal C. abortus inoculation.

This vaccine was composed of a pool of plasmids that contained the full ORFs of the genes, recoded for mammalian codon usage. A corresponding recombinant protein vaccine against C. abortus was also developed. This vaccine was Alum-Quil A based and contained a\u00a4nity-puri\u00a2ed full-length proteins expressed in E. coli, using the same genes that were incorporated into the genetic vaccine.",

The Holstein herd had a 53% vaginal Chlamydophila spp. PCR pre-challenge prevalence, without signi\u00a2cant di\u00a1erence between vaccinated and non-vaccinated heifers. The experimental herd mates were used to evaluate the genetic and recombinant protein vaccines, compared to mock vaccinated controls. Twenty-seven heifers were synchronized for estrus and then inoculated with an intrauterine dose of C. abortus. When the challenged heifers were at maximum shedding of C. abortus as determined by real-time PCR of vaginal swabs, estrus was synchronized in experimental heifers (n = 24). Experimental heifers were then monitored for estrus with a computerized estrus detection system and bred by arti\u00a2cial insemination. Pregnancy was determined by rectal palpation at 42 days post breeding. The results shown in Table III suggest protection by both genetic and protein vaccines from C. abortus-induced infertility. The odds ratio for improvement of fertility with vaccination against C. abortus is 4.5 (p = 0.12).",

It is important to note that the vaccines did not create a fresh adaptive immune response to C. abortus in naive heifers, but rather enhanced and/or modulated an existing response in animals with Chlamydophila spp. infection. Thus, the vaccines were used as therapeutic, not prophylactic vaccines, and may be more appropriately termed`antigen-speci\u00a2c immune modulators'.",

These conclusions suggest that subclinical Chlamydophila spp. infections have the potential to cause substantial production losses in bovine herds due to reduced fertility. A renewed focus towards quantitative prospective studies of subtle disease manifestations is warranted to improve our understanding of the impact of Chlamydophila spp. infections on bovine herd health. These infections may also negatively a\u00a1ect frequencies and intensities of bovine herd health problems such as mastitis, and respiratory and neonatal diseases. Rational application of standardized, highly sensitive PCR and serological methodology will be required for conclusive results. Furthermore, combination C. abortus^C. pecorum vaccines may aid in prevention of losses by these infections, but also serve together with antibiotics as`perturbation' tools in prospective intervention studies on the impact of Chlamydophila spp. infections on bovine herd health.",
