For this, we devise a multi-regions discrete-time model with the three classical SIR compartments, describing the spatial-temporal behaviors of homogenous susceptible, infected and removed populations. We suppose a large geographical domain, presented by a grid of colored cells, to exhibit at each instant i the spatial propagation of an epidemic which affects its different parts or sub-domains that we call here cells or regions. In order to minimize the number of infected individuals in some regions, we suggest an optimal control approach based on a travel-blocking vicinity strategy which aims to control a group of cells, or a patch, by restricting movements of infected people coming from its neighboring cells. We apply a discrete version of Pontryagin's maximum principle to state the necessary conditions and characterization of the travel-blocking optimal controls.

The authors have supposed that all regions are connected, and the infected people are able to enter all these regions. However, a region is often infected due to movements of infected people who enter from the neighboring regions. Generally, in the case of detached regions, infection travels to a targeted region if there exists a direct mode of transport between it and other regions from where the epidemic starts. In Figure \uf6dc(a) , where region E is connected with all other regions, we can see an illustration of the case of infection connections, which has been studied in the references above. In the same figure, we can also see that region A is connected only with regions B, D and E. Such cases have motivated us to write this paper in order to present a new epidemic modeling approach which generalizes all possible cases of infection connections between regions. The authors in [\uf63e-\uf640] have attempted to discuss and take into account such assumptions of connections using SIS, SIRS and SEIRS systems involving also discrete cellular simulations, but with a control approach applied to only one region.

It represents the case when the vicinity set V pq associated with the source cell of infection contains three cells. -when the epidemic starts from a cell C pq , with p = \uf63e, q = \uf63d, located in the vicinity of the target patch we aim to control. For instance, in Figure \uf63a , if we suppose there are \uf63c\uf639 susceptible people in cell C \uf6dc\uf639\uf6dc\uf639 located at the lower right corner of , and \uf63d\uf639 in each of the other cells, we can see that at instant i = \uf6dc\uf63d\uf639, the number S C \uf6dc\uf639\uf6dc\uf639 becomes less important and takes a value close/or equal to \uf63a\uf639, while S C pq in the cells of V \uf6dc\uf639\uf6dc\uf639 takes values close/or equal to \uf63b\uf639. As we move away from V \uf6dc\uf639\uf6dc\uf639 = {C \uf6dc\uf639\uf641 , C \uf641\uf6dc\uf639 , C \uf641\uf641 }, S C pq remains important. At instant i = \uf63b\uf639\uf639, we can observe that in most of cells S C pq becomes less important, taking values between \uf639 and \uf6dc\uf639, while in other cells it takes values between \uf63a\uf639 and \uf63c\uf639 except S C \uf6dc\uf639\uf6dc\uf639 which conserves its value in \uf63d\uf639 since it is located far away from the source of infection. At instant i = \uf63c\uf63d\uf639, S C pq becomes zero except at the corners and in most cells at the borders of , because these cells have vicinity sets smaller than other cells. Finally, at last instants, S C pq converges to zero in all cells. As regards Figure \uf63b , when we consider S C \uf63e\uf63d = \uf63c\uf639, which is located near the center of , and \uf63d\uf639 susceptible people in each of the other cells, it is observed that the situation is more severe, because the disease reaches the corners and borders faster than in the case of Figure becomes more important, taking values between \uf63b\uf639 and \uf63b\uf63d in the cells which are close to the cells with eight neighboring cells, while in few other cells, it takes values between \uf639 and \uf63a\uf639. From these numerical results, we can deduce that once the infection arrives to the center or to the cells with eight cells in their vicinity sets, the infection becomes more important compared to the case of the previous instant. At instant i = \uf63c\uf63d\uf639, I C pq takes values close/or equal to \uf63a\uf639 in the cell from where the epidemic has started, and \uf63a\uf63d in V \uf6dc\uf639\uf6dc\uf639 and near to it, and as we move towards the center and further regions, infection is important with the presence of more than \uf63b\uf639 infected individuals in each cell except the ones in the three opposite corners even at instant i = \uf63e\uf639\uf639. In fact, at the center of , the number of infected people, which has increased to \uf63b\uf63d at the previous instant, has been reduced, because once a cell becomes highly infected, it loses an important number of individuals which die or recover naturally after. All cells C pq become highly infected and the number I C pq becomes less and less important at further instants, noting that at i = \uf641\uf639\uf639, a large number of infected individuals has decreased because many I C pq have died or moved to the removed compartment. In Figure \uf63d , when we consider infection starting from near the center of by considering now that I C \uf63e\uf63d = \uf6dc\uf639, and no infected people in other cells, the disease spreads towards the corners and borders faster than in the first case in Figure \uf63c . At instant i = \uf6dc\uf63d\uf639, the number of infected people has increased in V \uf63e\uf63d , and as we move away to the corners and borders, infection is still low. At instant i = \uf63b\uf639\uf639, I C pq takes values more important in most cells, close/or equal to \uf63b\uf63d, except at the corners and center where I C pq is close/or equal to \uf63b\uf639, which is the result we can reach until instant i = \uf63c\uf63d\uf639 in Figure \uf63c , noting that I C \uf63e\uf63d and I C pq in V C \uf63e\uf63d have reduced due to death or natural recovery from the disease, while the infection has remained important in the cells which are near to the corners and borders since the infection has just arrived. The corner cells at instant i = \uf63c\uf63d\uf639 conserve their number of infected individuals, while cells at the borders of and the ones which are close to the center lose more people due to the number of dead or recovered people, which increases more and more at further instants, leading I C \uf63e\uf63d to decrease towards \uf6dc\uf63b and \uf640 at i = \uf63e\uf639\uf639 and i = \uf641\uf639\uf639, respectively.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 349, "end": 357, "text": "Figure \uf63a", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1290, "end": 1298, "text": "Figure \uf63b", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1552, "end": 1558, "text": "Figure", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2852, "end": 2860, "text": "Figure \uf63d", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3084, "end": 3092, "text": "Figure \uf63c", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3462, "end": 3470, "text": "Figure \uf63c", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Cellular simulations without controls"}, {"text": "We note that in the following figure, the scale of the color-bars does not exceed ten individuals since we cannot reach a larger number of removed people when we focus only on targeting infected people which come from C \uf6dc\uf639\uf6dc\uf639 .

We can see that at instant i = \uf6dc\uf63d\uf639, the numbers S C \uf6dc\uf639\uf6dc\uf639 and S C pq are at most the same as in the case when there was no control strategy. At instant i = \uf63b\uf639\uf639, we can observe that in most of cells, S C pq becomes less important, taking values between zero and ten in cells that are close to V \uf6dc\uf639\uf6dc\uf639 , while in other cells, and as we move away from V \uf6dc\uf639\uf6dc\uf639 , it takes values between \uf63a\uf639 and \uf63c\uf639. However, the controlled patch P contains \uf63d\uf639 susceptible people in each cell. In fact, even at instant i = \uf6dc\uf63d\uf639, the number of susceptible people in the controlled patch conserved its value in \uf63d\uf639, which is not also exactly the same as in the case when there was yet no control strategy since in Figure \uf63a , S C pq has decreased more significantly. Thus, we can deduce that the travel-blocking vicinity optimal control strategy has proved its effectiveness earlier in time. At instants i = \uf63c\uf63d\uf639, \uf63e\uf639\uf639 and i = \uf641\uf639\uf639, S C pq is also the same as done before but fortunately again, we reach our goal in keeping the number of susceptible people in P close to its initial value despite a decrease of \uf6dc\uf63d people. Thus, this demonstrates that most of movements of infected people coming from the vicinity of P have been restricted in final times. As regards Figure \uf641 , we consider S C \uf63e\uf63d = \uf63c\uf639 which represents the number of susceptible people present in cell C \uf63e\uf63d located near the center of which is more close to the target cell P, and we consider \uf63d\uf639 susceptible people in each of the other cells. We can observe at instant i = \uf63b\uf639\uf639 that S C pq takes values less important in most cells except at the corners and borders since the number of cells in their vicinity sets is small, but it is the result we have reached until instant i = \uf63c\uf63d\uf639 in Figure \uf640 . We can see more clearly that the number of susceptible people in the patch P has decreased to only \uf63c\uf63d in each cell C pq \u2208 P, since even in the previous instant i = \uf6dc\uf63d\uf639, S C \uf63d\uf63d has not changed also and conserved its value in \uf63d\uf639. At that instant, and as shown also in the previous case, the corner cells contain about \uf63a\uf639 susceptible, while in cells in the borders, S C pq takes values between \uf6dc\uf639 and \uf6dc\uf63d, and \uf639 in some cells near to the corners. Finally, as we move forward in time, it is observed that the number of susceptible people in the targeted patch P, in each cell C pq \u2208 P, has decreased to \uf63a\uf639, which is smaller than the number of susceptible people in the case when the infection has started from the corner.

In fact, when the disease starts from cell C \uf6dc\uf639\uf6dc\uf639 , as supposed in the section above, there are ten infected people in cell C \uf6dc\uf639\uf6dc\uf639 and no infected in each of the other cells. We can deduce that at instant i = \uf6dc\uf63d\uf639, the numbers I C \uf6dc\uf639\uf6dc\uf639 and I C pq are at most the same, as shown in the absence of controls. At instant i = \uf63b\uf639\uf639, we can see that in most of cells, I C pq is similar to the case in Figure \uf63b , and it is also more important, taking values between \uf63a\uf639 and \uf63b\uf639; while in other cells, it takes values between \uf639 and \uf6dc\uf639 as shown in the previous subsection. However, the controlled patch P is still not really infected since it does not contain yet any infected individual. At instant i = \uf63c\uf63d\uf639, I C pq takes values around \uf63a\uf639 in neighboring cells which belong to V \uf6dc\uf639\uf6dc\uf639 , and about \uf63b\uf639 in other cells except at the three opposite corners and borders of . At instant i = \uf63e\uf639\uf639, most cells C pq begin to lose some infected individuals due to natural recovery, and the number I C pq becomes less and less important at further instants, while the number of infected people in the patch P does not exceed eight infected individuals. In Figure \uf6dc\uf6dc , and as done in the case without controls, we can also observe that when we consider infection starting from near the center of by supposing ten infected individuals in each cell of the patch P with no infected people in each of the other cells outside the patch, the disease spreads towards the corners and borders faster than in the first case in Figure \uf6dc\uf639 . For instance, at instant i = \uf6dc\uf63d\uf639, the number of infected people has increased in the vicinity of the patch P and in V \uf63e\uf63d , and as we move away to the corners and borders, infection is still low.

The corner cells at instant i = \uf63c\uf63d\uf639 conserve their number of infected individuals while some cells at the borders of and the ones which are close to the center lose more people due to the number of dead or removed people, which increases more and more at further instants as observed in i = \uf63e\uf639\uf639 and i = \uf641\uf639\uf639 where the number of infected people in P does not exceed \uf63a\uf639 infected individuals, which is bigger than the number of infected people in the case when the infection has started from the corner.

We can see that at instant i = \uf641\uf639\uf639 the number of SIR people in the patch P is the same as shown in Figures \uf640, \uf641 , \uf6dc\uf639, \uf6dc\uf6dc, \uf6dc\uf63a and \uf6dc\uf63b regardless of the source of infection (from the corner cell C \uf6dc\uf639\uf6dc\uf639 or from C \uf63e\uf63d ). However, the most interesting idea we can extract from this figure is that regardless of the source of infection, the number of susceptible people in the patch P has not decreased significantly. When we aim to control only one cell, the vicinity set associated with this cell contains eight cells, while in the patch P considered here, each cell C pq \u2208 P is under control with a travel-blocking strategy applied to only five cells in its vicinity. Consequently, the movements of infected travelers entering from the three remaining obvious neighboring cells are not restricted.

Even when we consider an infection which starts from the left lower corner cell C \uf6dc\uf639\uf6dc\uf639 and the travel-blocking vicinity optimal control strategy is considered to be missed in only one cell C \uf63b\uf63b , the number of susceptible people in P \\ C \uf63b\uf63b has decreased to smaller values which equal \uf63a\uf639 individuals in each cell.

As regards the cellular simulations in Figure \uf6dc\uf640 , we can see in cellular simulations on the left side that when the travel-blocking vicinity optimal control approach was followed in all cells C pq \u2208 P, the number of infected people has not increased and conserved the zero value, while in cellular simulations on the right side, the number of infected people has increased to \uf63a\uf639 in each cell in P \\ C \uf63b\uf63b and to \uf63a\uf63d in C \uf63b\uf63b .

Since each cell in that is not located at the corners and borders has eight neighboring cells, based on the location of the patch P we consider here, each cell in P has also eight cells in its vicinity. However, the travelblocking vicinity optimal control strategy is proposed to be applied exactly to the patch P or to all cells in P together, and not to each cell alone. In fact, we may not suggest a control strategy which aims to restrict movements of people traveling from one cell to another cell belonging to the same patch. It would lead to saying that in each cell in P we should not isolate people without letting them reach other cells which belong to the same patch. However, in terms of the costs of an optimization approach, it would be more beneficial to control a patch rather than controlling cell by cell in the patch. Thus, the neighboring cells in P associated with a cell C pq \u2208 P are not subject to any movement restriction, which means the number of optimal controls that have to be introduced in the vicinity of a cell C pq \u2208 P is five rather than eight since the three neighboring cells which belong to P are missed.
