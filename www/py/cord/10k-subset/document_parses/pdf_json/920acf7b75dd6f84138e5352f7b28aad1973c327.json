The stains were susceptible to multiple antibiotics and treatment with ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin with clavoulanic acid was initiated for a three month period of treatment.

Fulminant course with an acute onset of dyspnea, cough, and fever, is the most common manifestation. Most patients suffer from various comorbidities. Leung et al in a three-year retroprospective study involving 19 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to Acinetobacter baumannii and 74 patients with health care associated pneumonia (HAP) concluded that CAP appears to be a unique clinical entity with a high incidence of bacteremia, ARDS, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and death, when compared to HAP [6] . In another study involving thirteen patients Chen et al concluded that Acinetobacter baumannii can be considered as an etiologic factor in communityacquired lobar pneumonia in patients with fulminant course in the warmer and humid periods of the year and also in younger alcoholic patients. The authors also suggested that a good sputum smear originated from the lower respiratory tract if it contains >25 leukocytes per high power (100\u00d7) field on microscopic examination early on to establish the diagnosis and that a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside is adequate as empirical treatment [7] . Falagas et al in a recent review highlighted six case series with community-acquired Acinetobacter infections involving 80 patients. Of these 51 had pneumonia and 56% (45 patients) died. Moreover in the same review 26 case reports involving 43 patients had been identified. Pneumonia was present in 38 of them and from the others two had meningitis, one had native valve endocarditis, one had soft skin infection and one had an ocular infection. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, excess consumption of alcohol and heavy smoking were the most common risk factors. According to the same review on 12 retrospective or prospective studies the range of isolation of Acinetobacter from patients suffering from community-acquired pneumonia was 1, 3% to 25, 9% [8] .",

Multi-drug resistant infections, including carbapenes, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones resistance, are challenging, however the combination of intravenous or inhaled colistin with tigercycline, imipenem, rifampicin or azithromycin seems reasonably enough to achieve satisfactory efficiency, at least in vitro, due to synergic or addictive effects which these combinations offer.
