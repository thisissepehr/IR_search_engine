Effective prognosis and treatment depend upon the early diagnosis of H. contortus infection. To date, no widely-approved methods for the identification of prepatent H. contortus infection are available to identify prepatent H. contortus infection properly. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic potential of recombinant cold shock H. contortus protein (rHc-CS) during early and late infections of H. contortus in goat. Results: Purified rHc-CS exhibited a clear band, with a molecular weight about 38 kDa. H. contortus eggs were not detected by fecal egg count technique from feces collected at 0 to 14 days post infection (D.P.I). However, eggs were detected at 21, 28 and 35 D.P.I. Hence, results of immunoblotting assay showed specific anti rHc-CS antibody detection in all goat sera collected at early stage (14 D.P.I) and late stage (21-103 D.P.I) of H. contortus infection. Furthermore, no cross reactivity was observed against Trichinella spiralis, Fasciola hepatica and Toxoplasma gondii or uninfected goats. Among several evaluated rHc-CS indirect-ELISA format variables, favorable antigen coating concentration was found 0.28 \u03bcg/well at 37\u00b0C 1 h and overnight at 4\u00b0C. Moreover, optimum dilution ratio of serum and rabbit anti-goat IgG was recorded as 1:100 and 1:4000, respectively. The best blocking buffer was 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) while the best time for blocking, serum incubation and TMB reaction were recorded as 60, 120 and 10 min, respectively. The cut-off value for positive and negative interpretation was determined as 0.352 (OD 450 ). The diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the rHc-CS, both were recorded as 100%.

It can suck about 0.05 mL blood per day [1, 2] and may cause acute anemia, edema, diarrhea, severe frailty weight loss, and ultimately death [3, 4] . Due to high mortality and morbidity rate, H. contortus infection causes significant economic losses to small ruminants particularly in humid, tropical and subtropical regions [5, 6] . China mainly contributes 17.3% of world's total goat population [7] in which different prevalence rate of H. contortus infection has been reported in several provinces [8] . The control of this parasite mainly relies on accurate and early diagnosis. Conventional fecal egg counts technique is main method to diagnose this infection clinically but it is difficult to detect H. contortus eggs in feces before 21-25 days of infection [4] . Last larval stages of this parasite feed on blood [9] and may suck up to 1/5th of total circulating erythrocyte volume in young animal [10] . H. contortus blood feeding starts at 11th day of infection [11] but clinical signs usually become apparent when infection becomes severe [12] . Another way for the diagnosis of this infection depends on the degree of anemia using FAMACHA system in which an ocular conjunctiva color chart is used for assessment of anemia to decide which animal requires treatment for H. contortus infection [13] . However, these methods are often nonspecific, insensitive, laborious, time consuming [14] and most importantly lacking the ability to detect the infection at early stage.

ESPs are released by parasites within the body of host that play vital role in pathogenesis and modulation of the immune response at the early stage of infection. It is further added that H. contortus interaction with host starts after the transition of L 3 into L 4 stage [28] . Furthermore, recombinant protein, having high immunoreactive concentration, may act as best immunodiagnostic antigen by achieving high sensitivity and specificity [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Recombinant Hc-CS is a major constituent of HcES proteins [23] which may have potential to diagnose H. contortus at early stage of infection. This study was designed to evaluate the specific antibodies detection during early and late infections of H. contortus using immunoblotting and indirect-ELISA based on rHc-CS in experimentally infected goat. In this study, rHc-CS was used as diagnostic antigen of H. contortus infection for detection of specific antibody during prepatent period and development of indirect ELISA as well. Immunoblotting is a useful technique to detect specific pathogen and antigen potency immunodiagnostic studies [37] . A confirmatory test for immunoblotting-positive sera was required to overcome the possible false positive results that may affect the certain diagnosis of infection [17] . In this study, immunoblotting results indicated that rHc-CS showed high immunoreactivity against polyclonal antibodies generated in sera of SD rats. The ELISA is a powerful tool as it provides a less time consuming, easy and safe way to perform serological detection. Therefore the association between ELISA and immunoblotting techniques can be seen as a potent way to increase sensitivity for immunodiagnosis purposes [38] . Previously, a study was conducted for prepatent detection of specific H. contortus antibody, early and late patency of H. contortus infections using ELISA based on Hc26 and immunoblotting in sheep [37] . Another study was performed using recombinant protein recIgE1-2 to detect H. contortus infection in sheep sera collected at 2 to 4 weeks post infection in which immunoblotting assay showed crossreactivity against sheep sera [39] . In contrast, the immunoblotting results of this study revealed that rHc-CS antigen specifically reacted with antibodies present in all H. contortus positive goat sera at 14 D.P.I and persisted until 103 D.P.I. However, no anti-rHc-CS antibodies were detected in uninfected sera collected at day before infection. Previously, crude Excretory-Secretory (ES) protein of H. contortus-based Dot-ELISA was performed using sera collected at 1-3 weeks post infection sera but cross reactivity of this antigen with other nematode and trematode was not checked [15] . In contrast to this study, H. contortus antigen showed cross-reactivity against Fasciola hepatica and Moniezia expansa [40] . In previous study, somatic and adult larval antigen showed cross-reactivity with closely-related H. contortus species and possibly other genera [9] . In this study, rHc-CS did not show any cross-reactivity against coinfecting parasites (T. spiralis, F. hepatica and T. gondii). These results proved that specific-antibody detection has more specific and sensitive diagnostic potential as compared to conventional microscopic techniques. Thus, the evaluated rHc-CS can be used as diagnostic antigen to detect specific antibodies effectively during prepatent period of H. contortus infection in goat. Antigenicity, sensitivity and specificity may be influenced by the secretion time of antigen. It has been reported earlier that rHc-CS releases at 14 and 60 D.P.I and antibodies against this molecule are produced [23] .

In this study, to minimize this challenge of false reactions, different dilutions of different blocking buffers were optimized with different incubating times. Incubation time of buffer has significant effects on the performance of the assay. Therefore, the optimized results showed that the best blocking buffer was 5% BSA which is same as the findings of previous study [46] . The optimum reactive time of blocking and TMB was recorded as 60 and 10 min, respectively. Furthermore, the best P/N value (6.44) was recorded when serum was incubated for 120 min. To reduce time, serum can be incubated for 60 min because P/N value was observed positive (P/N > 2.1). This optimized rHc-CS based indirect-ELISA will be more authenticated tool for identifying goats in the prepatent stage of H. contortus infection than other antigen-based assays. The results of this study will facilitate the low cost early serological diagnosis of large number of animals and possibly vaccine development against the infection of H. contortus. This assay has high sensitivity and specificity for downstream application in field studies. However, further study is required to assess the cross-reactivity of rHc-CS against other nematodes belonging to Trichostrongylidae family.
