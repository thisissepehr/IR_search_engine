Central to the drug discovery process is gene identification followed by determination of the expression of genes in a given disease and understanding of the function of the gene products. It is of interest that the identification, in the early 1980s, of the gene believed to be responsible for cystic fibrosis took researchers approx 9 yr to discover, whereas the gene responsible for Parkinson's disease was identified within a period of several weeks (3). This quantum leap in the ability to associate a specific gene with a disease can be attributed primarily to the extraordinary progress that has been made in the areas of gene sequencing and information technologies.",

In diseased tissue, gene expression levels often differ from those observed in normal tissues, with certain genes being over-or underexpressed, or new genes being expressed or completely absent. Localization of this differential gene expression is one of the first crucial steps in identifying an important potential molecular target for drug discovery. In addition to the traditional techniques of Northern analysis, a number of newer methods are used to localize gene expression. The techniques that typically yield the highest quality data are in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunocytochemistry, both of which are labor intensive. For example, ISH or immunohistochemical localization of a prospective molecular target to a particular tissue or subcellular region is likely to yield valuable information concerning gene function. Examples of the success of this approach include the case of the orexin peptides and receptors whose hypothalamic regional localization suggested an involvement in feeding (6).",

With either of these techniques, target localization within the cell is possible at the microscopic level but is dependent on the availability of high-quality normal and diseased human tissues, which may often represent a limiting factor.",

Microarray gridding and Spotfire \u00ae data analysis are already evolving into procedures that allow the comprehensive evaluation of differences in gene expression patterns in normal, diseased, or pharmacologically manipulated systems (8, 9) . For genes expressed in low abundance, more sensitive techniques may be required, and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR-based TaqMan technology offers the ability to detect changes in gene expression with as little as two copies per cell.

Just as DNA microarrays allow the detection of changes in genes in various diseases, protein, peptide, tissue, and cell microarrays can be used to detect changes in proteins, phospholipids, or glycation of proteins in disease. Protein arrays are also used to examine enzyme-substrate, DNA-protein, and protein-protein interactions (16,17) . The practical application of proteomics depends on the ability to identify and analyze each protein product in a cell or tissue (18). Because proteins cannot be amplified like DNA or RNA and proteins also tend to be degraded more readily, sensitive and rapid analyses are necessary to account for the small sample sizes and instability of proteins. Although this field is still developing, a MS and ProteinChip-surfaceenhanced laser desorption/ionization technologies using slides with various surface properties (e.g., ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, metal chelation) to bind and selectively purify proteins from a complex biological sample are being utilized (18, 19 ). An important challenge encountered with protein microarrays is maintaining functionality of the protein, such as posttranslational modifications and phosphorylation. Another important consideration is the retention of both secondary and tertiary structures. The use of immobilizing coatings, such as aluminum, gold, or hydrophilic polymers, on slides or imprinting the proteins on porous polyacrylamide gels is being explored to address these issues (17). For example, proteomic analysis has been used successfully to identify serum biomarkers. ProteinChip-surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization technology, in conjunction with bioinformatics tools, has been utilized to identify a proteomic pattern in serum that is diagnostic for ovarian cancer (20) . It is anticipated that proteomics and bioinformatics will facilitate the discovery of new and better biomarkers of disease.",

Metabolic profiling has been used regularly to characterize toxicity and disease states, such as inborn errors of metabolism. Additionally, blood and urine are screened routinely for metabolites such as cholesterol and glucose in patients to test for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However, a recent advance in metabolomics is the analysis of small molecules within a sample to find new markers for disease or metabolic patterns as indicators for drug toxicity. Techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, MS, and chromatographic analysis of cell extracts are used in meta- bolomic research (22,23) . These techniques have been especially useful in generating lipid metabolome data (i.e., lipomics) to study the effects of dietary fats and lipid-lowering drugs on cardiac, plasma, adipose, and liver phospholipid metabolism (22-27) . Metabolic changes during tumor proliferation have also been studied using metabolomics. For example, the tumor metabolome is characterized by high glycolytic and glutaminolytic capacities and high phosphometabolite levels to allow tumor cells to proliferate over broad ranges in oxygen and glucose supply (28). It is anticipated that metabolics will provide insight into the metabolism of tumor cells that might be helpful in understanding and modifying tumor cell proliferation.",

Although it is possible that a sustainable chemical lead can be identified from HTS, it has been more commonly the case that \"hits\" emerging from HTS require substantial chemical optimization to provide molecules with the desired level of potency, selectivity, and suitable pharmacokinetic (PK) properties (31) to support a fully fledged drug discovery program. Furthermore, the data available from an HTS effort are still of limited utility from the point of view of generating structure-activity relationships (SARs) capable of directing medicinal chemistry efforts. Combinatorial chemistry in some of its earliest incarnations was seen as a means of rapidly synthesizing massive numbers of molecules for HTS. However, in recent years this has evolved into the synthesis of more focused, smaller arrays of molecules directed both at enhancement of the properties of early hits emerging from HTS and at optimization of lead molecules in the progression toward development of candidates (32,33) .

It is anticipated that the greater attention given to the evaluation of developability characteristics in candidate molecules will lead to reduced attrition, improving the likelihood that a compound will enter clinical development and be successful in getting to market in a time-and cost-effective manner.",

In addition, a drug might not affect gene expression in a given subpopulation that is representative of the larger group. In an attempt to identify how genes are expressed following drug treatment or to determine toxicity issues associated with a compound, DNA arrays can be used for what are termed pharmacogenomic and toxicogenomic studies (35). Pharmacogenomics refers to the identification of genes that are involved in determining drug responsiveness and that may cause differential drug responses in different patients. These studies include the evaluation of allelic differences in gene expression, and the evaluation of genes responsible for drug resistance and sensitivity (35, 36) . Toxicogenomics refers to the characterization of potential genes involved in toxicity and the adverse effects of drugs (35,37) . Toxicogenomics allows for a gene profile of candidate biomarkers of toxicity and carcinogenicity. Predictive toxicology is a term used for the application of toxicogenomics and the evaluation of compounds in silico against a panel of genes associated with toxicity (38). Models of SAR are used to predict potential toxic effects based on chemical structures and their properties (39). Predictive toxicology also takes into account computer-based predictions of adsorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion and PK properties in addition to toxicology, all of which contribute to the lead optimization process.",

For example, drug candidates aimed at inflammation can be tested in a human blister model (40, 41) . In this model, suction is applied to the forearm of healthy volunteers following pre-exposure to ultraviolet-B light. The resulting blister is used to evaluate secreted inflammatory mediators and changes in gene expression within 48 h of insult. Cell counts, prostaglandin (PG)E 2 (measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), PGD 2 (measured by gas chromatography), and gene expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2, and PGE and PGD synthases (measured by real-time PCR) are assessed. This model allows the rapid analysis of effects of drugs on cellular infiltration, soluble mediator formation in blister fluid, and steady-state gene expression in cellular infiltrates. These markers (e.g., new transcription factors, cytokines, and other mediators) can be followed in both the inflammatory and resolution phases of human inflammation. In addition, coupled with DNA array technology, this model may be useful in defining new targets for the treatment of inflammation. Furthermore, toxicity and efficacy profiles of new and existing drugs can be studied. For example, a gene chip of the subset of human genes identified in blister fluid can be used to identify surrogate markers of toxicity and efficacy in modulating gene expression in drug evaluation.",

To this end, identification of relevant signaling pathways that mediate plaque inflammation may provide therapeutic targets for the improvement of clinical outcomes in high-risk individuals. For example, inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) attenuates inflammatory responses and matrix-degrading activities in human atherosclerotic plaque, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for the regression and stabilization of atherosclerosis. Signaling mechanisms involving p38 MAPK as well as other inflammatory responses can be characterized by TaqMan real-time RT-PCR in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques and nonatherosclerotic vessels. In addition, the biological effects of the p38 MAPK pathway can be assessed in an ex vivo organ culture system (42). In these studies, a selective p38 MAPK inhibitor is added to the organ culture system and a variety of analyses are conducted. Current analyses of human plaque specimens include a panel of markers, such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and matrix metalloproteinases. Other analyses include the evaluation of phosphorylated p38 MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase.",

There is evidence that genotype may impact the incidence of adverse events for a given drug. The aim is to identify genetic polymorphic variants that represent risk factors for the development of a particular clinical condition, or that predict a given response to a specific therapeutic. More important, the rate-limiting step in revealing biologically relevant phenotype-genotype associations is the collection of human DNA samples from carefully phenotyped individuals (43). Two general approaches may be used to investigate genetic variation in drug handling or response: (1) the hypothesisdriven method is based on a priori hypotheses and involves selecting specific sections of DNA known to encode the drug target, drug-metabolizing enzymes, disease or genetic regions associated with mechanisms of action, or adverse effects; and (2) the genomewide scan investigates a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) cover- ing the entire genome with the aim of identifying a collection of SNPs that are associated with differential drug handling or response.",

(45) identified a 250,000-bp region of extended linkage disequilibrium that was associated with this hypersensitivity reaction. Several SNPs were predictive in that individuals with these SNPs (e.g., human leukocyte antigen B57) taking Abacavir had a 97% chance of experiencing the adverse event, although only 50% of the individuals who experienced the adverse event while taking Abacavir actually carried the variants (i.e., 97% specific, 50% sensitive).

One can already anticipate the future availability of genetic structure and susceptibility to disease at the individual level. With such information available early in a research program, the drug discovery scientist is faced with the unprecedented opportunity to address the individual variability to drug therapy and safety prior to advancing a compound into clinical trials. The exponential growth of attractive novel molecular targets for potential drug therapy has heavily taxed the core disciplines of drug discovery, and automated methods of compound synthesis and biological evaluation will play an even more dominant role in the future of the pharmaceutical industry.",
