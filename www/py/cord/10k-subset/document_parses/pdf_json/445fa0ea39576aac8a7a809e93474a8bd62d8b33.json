The average degree of the Enron network is k = 3.4. This means that only a few nodes have high degrees, others have low degrees (see Table 9 ). In such a network, if nodes with maximal degrees are infected, viruses will rapidly spread in the network and the final number of infected nodes will be larger than in other cases. The targeted strategy therefore does not perform any better than the node-betweenness strategy. In fact, as the number of immunized nodes increases, the efficiency of the node-betweenness immunization increases proportionally There are two infected nodes with different attack modes.

Thus, it is more reasonable and feasible to just evaluate how the propagation of a virus is affected by immunization strategies, i.e. avoiding the effects caused by the stochastic process, the infection model and the user behavior. It can be seen that the edge-betweenness strategy is able to find some nodes with high degrees of centrality and then integrally divide a network into a number of sub-networks (e.g. v 4 in Fig. 2) . However, compared with the nodes (e.g. v 5 in Fig. 2 ) selected by the node-betweenness strategy, the nodes with higher edge betweenness can not cut the epidemic paths as they can not effectively break the whole structure of a network. In Fig. 2 , the synthetic community-based network and the university email network are used as examples to illustrate why the edge-betweenness strategy can not obtain the same immunization efficiency as the node-betweenness strategy. To select two nodes as immunized nodes from Fig. 2 , the node-betweenness immunization will select {v 5 , v 3 } by using the descending order of node betweenness. However, the edge-betweenness strategy can select {v 3 , v 4 } or {v 4 , v 5 } because the edges, L 1 and L 2 , have the highest edge betweenness. This result shows that the node-betweenness strategy can not only effectively divide the whole network into two communities, but also break the interior structure of communities. Although the edgebetweenness strategy can integrally divided the whole network into two parts, viruses can also propagate in each community. Many networks commonly contain the structure shown in Fig. 2 , for example, the Enron email network and university email networks. Table 7 and Fig. 8 present the results of the synthetic community-based network. Table 8 compares different strategies in the university email network, which also has some self-similar community structures [18] . These results further validate the analysis stated above. From the above experiments, the following conclusions can be made: Tables 4-8 , AP L can be used as a measurement to evaluate the efficiency of an immunization strategy. Thus, when designing a distributed immunization strategy, attentions should be paid on those nodes that have the largest impact on the APL value. 2. If the final number of infected nodes is used as a measure of efficiency, then the nodebetweenness immunization strategy is more efficient than the targeted immunization strategy. 3.

By doing experiments in synthetic networks, synthetic community-based network, the Enron email network and the university email network, it is easily to find that the node-betweenness immunization strategy has the highest efficiency. In this section, the performance of the different strategies will be evaluated in terms of cost and robustness, as in [20] . It is well known that the structure of a social network or an email network constantly evolves. It is therefore interesting to evaluate how changes in structure affect the efficiency of an immunization strategy. -The cost can be defined as the number of nodes that need to be immunized in order to achieve a given level of epidemic prevalence \u03c1. Generally, \u03c1 \u2192 0. There are some parameters which are of particular interest: f is the fraction of nodes that are immunized; f c is the critical value of the immunization when \u03c1 \u2192 0; \u03c1 0 is the infection density when no immunization strategy is implemented; \u03c1 f is the infection density with a given immunization strategy. Figure 9 shows the relationship between the reduced prevalence \u03c1 f /\u03c1 0 and f. It can be seen that the node-betweenness immunization has the lowest prevalence for the smallest number of protected nodes. The immunization cost increases as the value of \u03b1 increases, i.e. in order to achieve epidemic prevalence \u03c1 \u2192 0, the node-betweenness immunization strategy needs 20, 25, and 30% of nodes to be immunized, respectively, in the three synthetic networks. This is because the node-betweenness immunization strategy can effectively break the network structure and increase the path length of a network with the same number of immunized nodes. -The robustness shows a plot of tolerance against the dynamic evolution of a network, i.e. the change of power-law exponents (\u03b1). Figure 10 shows the relationship between the immunized threshold f c and \u03b1. A low level of f c with a small variation indicates that the immunization strategy is robust. The robustness is important when an immunization strategy is deployed into a scalable and dynamic network (e.g. P2P and email networks). Figure 10 also shows the robustness of the D-steps immunization strategy is close to that of the targeted immunization; the node-betweenness strategy is the most robust. [49] have compared virus propagation in synthetic networks with \u03b1 = 1.7 and \u03b1 = 1.1475, and pointed out that initial worm propagation has two phases. However, they do not give a detailed explanation of these results nor do they compare the effect of the power-law exponent on different immunization strategies during virus propagation.

Figure 11a shows the changes of the average number of infected nodes over time; Fig. 11b gives the average degree of infected nodes at each time step. From the results, it can be seen that 1. The number of infected nodes in non-immunized networks is determined by attack modes but not the power-law exponent. In Figs. 11a , b, three distribution curves (\u03b1 = 1.7, 2.7, and 3.7) overlap with each other in both random and malicious attacks. The difference between them is that the final number of infected nodes with a malicious attack is larger than that with a random attack, as shown in Fig. 11a , reflecting the fact that a malicious attack is more dangerous than a random attack. 2. A virus spreads more quickly in a network with a large power-law exponent than that with a small exponent. Because a malicious attack initially infects highly connected nodes, the average degree of the infected nodes decreases in a shorter time comparing to a random attack (T 1 < T 2). Moreover, the speed and range of the infection is amplified by those highly connected nodes. In phase I, viruses propagate very quickly and infect most nodes in a network. However, in phase II, the number of total infected nodes grows slowly (Fig. 11a) , because viruses aim to infect those nodes with low degrees (Fig. 11b) , and a node with fewer links is more difficult to be infected.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 65, "end": 75, "text": "Figure 11a", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 145, "end": 153, "text": "Fig. 11b", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 377, "end": 386, "text": "Figs. 11a", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 653, "end": 661, "text": "Fig. 11a", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 1280, "end": 1290, "text": "(Fig. 11a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 1352, "end": 1362, "text": "(Fig. 11b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}], "section": "Immunization cost and robustness"}, {"text": "In order to observe the effect of different immunization strategies on the average degree of infected nodes in different networks, 5% of the nodes are initially protected against random and malicious attacks. Figure 12 shows the simulation results. From this experiment, it can be concluded that 1. The random immunization has no effect on restraining virus propagation because the curves of the average degree of the infected nodes are basically coincident with the curves in the non-immunization case. 2. Comparing Fig. 12a , b, c and d, e, f, respectively, it can be seen that the peak value of the average degree is the largest in the network with \u03b1=1.7 and the smallest in the network with \u03b1=3.7. This is because the network with a lower exponent has more highly connected nodes (i.e. the range of degrees is between 50 and 80), which serve as amplifiers in the process of virus propagation. 3. As \u03b1 increases, so does the number of infected nodes and the virus propagation duration (T 1 < T 2 < T 3). Because a larger \u03b1 implies a larger AP L , the number of infected nodes will increase; if the network has a larger exponent, a virus need more time to infect those nodes with medium or low degrees. Fig. 14 The average number of infected nodes and the average degree of infected nodes, with respect to time when virus spreading in different networks. We apply the targeted immunization to protect 30% nodes in the network First, consider the process of virus propagation in the case of a malicious attack where 30% of the nodes are immunized using the edge-betweenness immunization strategy. There are two intersections in Fig. 13a . Point A is the intersection of two curves NET1 and NET3, and point B is the intersection of NET2 and NET1. Under the same conditions, Fig. 13a shows that the total number of infected nodes is the largest in NET1 in Phase I. Corresponding to Fig. 13b , the average degree of infected nodes in NET1 is the largest in Phase I. As time goes on, the rate at which the average degree falls is the fastest in NET1, as shown in Fig. 13b . This is because there are more highly connected nodes in NET1 than in the others (see Table 9 ). After these highly connected nodes are infected, viruses attempt to infect the nodes with low degrees. Therefore, the average degree in NET3 that has the smallest power-law exponent is larger than those in Phases II and III. The total number of infected nodes in NET3 continuously increases, exceeding those in NET1 and NET2. The same phenomenon also appears in the targeted immunization strategy, as shown in Fig. 14.

An analysis of the distribution of the power-law exponent (\u03b1) for different individuals in Web browsing [10] and in the Enron dataset shows that the power-law exponent is approximately 1.3. In order to observe and quantitatively analyze the effect that the email-checking interval has on virus propagation, the email-clicking probability distribution (P i ) in our model is consistent with the one used by [49] , i.e. the security awareness of different users in the network follows a normal distribution, P i \u223c N (0.5, 0.3 2 ). Figure 16 shows that following a random attack viruses quickly propagate in the Enron network if the email-checking intervals follow a power-law distribution. The results are consistent with the observed trends in real computer networks [31] , i.e. viruses initially spread explosively, then enter a long latency period before becoming active again following user activity. The explanation for this is that users frequently have a short period of focused activity followed by a long period of inactivity.

Some experiments are used to systematically compare different immunization strategies for restraining epidemic spreading, in synthetic scale-free networks including the community-based network and two real email networks. The simulation results have shown that the key factor that affects the efficiency of immunization strategies is APL, rather than the sum of the degrees of immunized nodes (SID). That is to say, immunization strategy should protect nodes with higher connectivity and transmission capability, rather than those with higher degrees. 2. Some performance metrics are used to further evaluate the efficiency of different strategies, i.e. in terms of their cost and robustness. Simulation results have shown that the D-steps immunization is a feasible strategy in the case of limited resources and the nodebetweenness immunization is the best if the global topological information is available. 3. The effects of power-law exponents and human dynamics on virus propagation are analyzed. More in-depth experiments have shown that viruses spread faster in a network with a large power-law exponent than that with a small one. Especially, the results have explained why some old viruses can still propagate in networks up till now from the perspective of human dynamics.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section":
