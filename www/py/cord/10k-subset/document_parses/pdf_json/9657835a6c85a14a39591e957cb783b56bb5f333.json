Although transcriptomic approaches have been applied to identify genes involved in the fibrotic process in previous studies, the specific fibrosis-related genes in HF development and further contributed to the HF progression is still not well known. With the survival rate and gene expression data in this study, we identified a fibrosis-associated gene, COL1A1, that was significantly associated with HF progression. By performing IHC and qRT-PCR experiments, the expression of COL1A1 was validated to be highly upregulated in the HF samples. We were able to further investigate COL1A1 content in plasma by using another 139 HF samples. And we found that higher expression level of COL1A1 in plasma was associated with poor survival from HF to HTx (Fig. 7e) . To our knowledge, this is the first report to specify fibrotic gene associated with HF progression. It is known that HF is heterogeneous with different time from HF onset to HTx ranging from 30 days to more than 5 years [50] . The plasma biomarkers might provide great promise to further dissect the underlying disease processes. Our results indicated that the plasma COL1A1 content could be a potential biomarker to distinguish the malignant process of HF within 1-year after HF diagnosis with higher diagnostic efficiency than longer survival condition (Additional file 8: Table S8 ). It will be helpful to assess the HF patient regarding longer survival, as well as to alleviate the overload of HF. It is important to further study the mechanistic role of COL1A1 in fibrosis. There are some reports of the association between COL1A1 and fibrosis in HF based on the mouse model or in other diseases such as liver cancer [51] [52] [53] . In the present work, we validated this relationship at the transcriptomic level in the human heart tissue. Instead of further investigating how COL1A1 leads to fibrosis, we focused on the potential role of COL1A1 in HF progression. Such finding is much needed for clinical studies in heart transplantation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1139, "end": 1143, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1841, "end": 1845, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1846, "end": 1850, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1851, "end": 1855, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 907, "end": 916, "text": "(Fig. 7e)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1494, "end": 1502, "text": "Table S8", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Readers should take caution of the results in our study because the sample size is still relatively small. We used 30 patients (21 HF and 9 healthy donors, all heart tissue samples) for discovery by a multi-omics approach. Our top gene (COL1A1) identified in the 30 discovery cohort samples was further validated by immunohistochemistry staining in the same cohort and qRT-PCR using another independent cohort (20 HF and 9 healthy donors), and an additional 139 cohort patients for evaluation of plasma COL1A1 content. This size of the heart failure cohort for potential biomarker discovery is smaller than some of the previous studies of HF [54, 55] . It is due to the fact that all the HF patients, including the 139 HF cohort, received heart transplantation, which is different from the previous studies [55] . Considering this limitation, our findings need further validation by recruiting more HF patients with related clinical data and additional functional work to illustrate specific roles of plasma COL1A1 level on HF progression in the future. Furthermore, most HF patients included in the study for multi-transcriptomic analysis were young (mean age 34.6), and much younger than the general patient population. Our preliminary analysis did not find any significant difference by checking family history and etiology of these HF patients. Since most HF patients are older than our samples, the results in this study might include some unique features of this specific population and further investigation is warranted in future. Moreover, we found that there were two HFpEF samples in our study cohort.

Our network analysis not only provided a high-level view of the functional changes but also pinpointed several critical regulators. By examining the relationship between fibrosis percentage and gene expression, we identified several genes and their regulatory networks that might be related to fibrosis. Furthermore, the fibrosis associated gene COL1A1 was found to be associated progression of HF. COL1A1 content in plasma could be used as a potential biomarker for HF progression, especially for predicting the 1-year survival from HF onset to HTx.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}, {"text": "Supplementary information accompanies this paper at https://doi.org/10. 1186/s12916-019-1469-4.Additional file 1: Table S1 .
