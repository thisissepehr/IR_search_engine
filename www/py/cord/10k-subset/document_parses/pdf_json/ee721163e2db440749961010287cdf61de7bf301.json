Low V/Q can effectively be negated by oxygen therapy, with the value of \u0394 A-c PO 2 interpreted as the extra oxygen pressure required in inspired gas to counter low V/Q mismatch. For example, for a barometric pressure of about 100 kPa, a value of \u0394 A-c PO 2 of 10 kPa can effectively be countered by increasing FiO 2 by approximately 10%, which raises both alveolar and end-capillary PO 2 by 10 kPa. Carbon dioxide is primarily affected by high V/Q, and \u0394 A-c PCO 2 therefore represents an index of high V/Q mismatch. A \u0394 A-c PCO 2 > 0 kPa can therefore signify a clinical need to increase minute ventilation.

Only two patients showing an increase in high V/Q mismatch also showed an increase in hyperinflation according to the CT aeration analysis. MIGET studies have previously shown an increase in both shunt and high V/Q mismatch following an increase in PEEP [9, 11] . An increase in venous admixture has similarly been shown following an increase in PEEP [3] . As increasing PEEP caused a decrease in non-aerated tissue in all patients, the observed increase in shunt in four patients can most likely be explained by no perfusion of otherwise adequately aerated regions of the lung. This could be caused by the redistribution of blood flow toward the dependent atelectatic regions of the lung due to elevated intrathoracic pressure following the PEEP increase [34] . The discrepancy between detection of hyperinflation from aeration and measurement of high V/Q mismatch by \u0394 A-c PCO 2 may be due to the different effect of PEEP increase on end-expiratory aeration as measured by CT in the present study and changes in distributions of ventilation and perfusion, which in concert determine the effect of PEEP on V/Q mismatch. Perfusion redistribution toward dependent lung regions could contribute to such discrepancy by reducing perfusion to non-dependent high V/Q regions without these necessarily being hyperinflated. Ventilation may also be redistributed toward dependent lung regions, as observed on increasing PEEP in studies with electrical impedance tomography [35, 36] , and EITbased estimations of alveolar hyperdistension have been proposed [37] . As such, the hyperinflation detected by CT aeration may be in regions with reduced ventilation. However, the observed increase in high V/Q mismatch in some of the patients of the present study indicates that the overall redistributions of perfusion and ventilation following the PEEP increase have been poorly matched in these patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 428, "end": 431, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 432, "end": 435, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 525, "end": 528, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 930, "end": 934, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1638, "end": 1642, "text": "[35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1643, "end": 1646, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1721, "end": 1725, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We observed no distinct pattern of \u0394 A-c PO 2 changes with an increase in PEEP, in line with MIGET studies [9, 11] indicating large variation in the effect of PEEP increase on low V/Q mismatch.

We have performed this comparison between two PEEP levels of 5 cmH 2 O and either 15 or 20 cmH 2 O to evaluate if the two measurement modalities would give similar quantification of recruitment. Our results should therefore not be construed as indications for a proposed strategy for optimizing PEEP but, given the three observed patterns of gas exchange response to PEEP, rather as a support for individual PEEP titration. Different strategies have been proposed for individual PEEP titration [5, 33] . In their maximal recruitment strategy, Borges et al. performed recruitment maneuvers of incremental Pplat between 40 and 60 cmH 2 O followed by a decremental PEEP titration targeting a combined index of PaO 2 +PaCO 2 [33] . This strategy, primarily targeting oxygenation, led to a good correlation between repeated measurements of lung collapse assessed by CT aeration and PaO 2 across recruitment maneuvers and titrated PEEP. Strategies for determining optimal PEEP have also been suggested to focus on lung mechanics. Chiumello et al. compared 3 mechanics-oriented strategies with an oxygenation-oriented \"open-lung\" strategy [5] . They found that PEEP selected according to lung mechanics were unrelated to lung recruitability assessed by CT-measured lung aeration, whereas the oxygenationoriented strategy led to PEEP levels related to recruitability. Whether individually titrated PEEP values can achieve both improvements in aeration, shunt and V/Q mismatch remains to be determined. The results of Chiumello et al.'s and Borges et al.'s study indicate that PEEP strategies targeting oxygenation are preferable for improving aeration, and the results presented by Borges et al. are particularly encouraging showing that individually titrated PEEP can improve oxygenation, lung mechanics, and lung collapse, indicating that a good compromise between redistributing ventilation and perfusion and protecting the lungs can be achieved. Their reported increase in oxygenation indicates improvement in shunt, and their use of FiO 2 of 100% would effectively counter low V/Q mismatch. It would be interesting to investigate whether this strategy would result in a beneficial response for a high V/Q mismatch.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 630, "end": 633, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 634, "end": 637, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 857, "end": 861, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1271, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our study has some limitations.

According to Dantzker et al. [40] , a decrease in CO can cause a reduction in shunt.

Anatomical dead space should not be confused with physiological dead space, which includes alveolar dead space [43] and has been shown to vary significantly with PEEP [9] [10] [11] .

Experimentally, this process requires a fast oxygen analyzer and capnograph for measuring end-tidal expired levels of O 2 and CO 2 . Such devices are not always used in clinical practice but are readily available. A further assumption of this method is that FiO 2 variation does not affect lung physiology. Changes in FiO 2 may affect lung physiology through reabsorption atelectasis [49] and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). Reabsorption atelectasis should not affect parameter estimation as shunt, and V/Q mismatch parameters can be estimated from FiO 2 levels lower than 0.8 [13] , which have been shown to cause minimal atelectasis during induction of anesthesia [50] . HPV inhibition can affect pulmonary gas exchange at a moderate [51] or considerable extent [52] . However, HPV inhibition in these studies constitutes maximal responses to changes in FiO 2 . The smaller FiO 2 steps performed in this study to estimate shunt and V/Q mismatch model parameters are less likely to have an effect on HPV and pulmonary gas exchange. Studies with the MIGET technique [53, 54] , computer simulations [55, 56] , and a study with both the MIGET technique and an oxygen gas exchange model [18] have shown limited changes in shunt and V/Q parameters with large variations in FiO 2 . The effects of HPV on parameter estimation are therefore likely to be limited [17] . The applied physiological model gives an integrated view of pulmonary gas exchange based on two ventilated and perfused gas exchanging compartments and one shunt compartment. The MIGET would provide greater resolution with a model incorporating 50 compartments of varying V/Q [8] but is considered too costly for routine clinical use [57] . The model used for estimating gas exchange parameters in the present study has previously been shown to agree well with MIGET gas exchange measurements of retention, excretion, and oxygenation in animal acute lung injury models [17, 18] . The concordance of our results with MIGET studies of PEEP in ARDS [9, 11] , suggests a possible bedside role of the ALPE technique in evaluating PEEP effects.
