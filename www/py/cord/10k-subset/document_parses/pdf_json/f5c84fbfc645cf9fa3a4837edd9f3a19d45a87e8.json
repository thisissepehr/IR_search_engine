            "text": "In pneumonia local phagocyte activation is crucial for clearing of pathogenic microorganisms. In this context alveolar macrophage intedeukin-8 secretion, phagocyte oxidative response and concentrations of lavage proteins were quantified, including interleukin-8, in 31 patients with pneumonia, 13 age matched patients with peripheral lung consolidation and six healthy volunteers; these findings were related to the impairment of gas exchange and the bacterial load in the alveolar space. Increased interleukin-8 levels were found in bronchoaiveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and in alveolar macrophage supernatants from patients with pneumonia (214 ng/105 AM \u00b1 121 vs 71 ng/105 AM \u00b1 35 and 66 ng/105 AM \u00b1 30, p < 0.05). Interleukin-8 release from alveolar macrophages correlated with the upregulated spontaneous luminol enhanced oxidative response of pulmonary phagocytes but not with the neutrophil count in BALE In pneumonia patients a significant difference was found between patients with 10 4 or more colony forming units (CFU)/ml BALF of one pathogen and patients with less CFU or nonspecific microbiological results (261 ng/105 AM \u00b1 89 vs 179 ng/105 AM \u00b1 81 and 7.5 ng/ml BALF \u00b1 17 vs 0.44 ng/ml BALF \u00b1 1, p < 0,05). Further, a negative correlation between interleukin-8 release of alveolar macrophages and the arterial pO 2 at the time of BALF could be demonstrated (r = -0.47, p < 0.05). The results demonstrate local cellular activation in community-acquired pneumonia, which is related to the bacterial load in the alveolar space and to impairment of gas exchange. This is consistent with the hypothesis that pulmonary phagocytes play a central role in the pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia, contributing not only to bacterial dearing but also to local tissue damage.",

            "text": "Bacterial pneumonia is still a severe infectious disease with considerable mortality despite the advent of potent antimicrobial chemotherapeutics. In this context local phagocyte activation seems to be crucial for effective bacterial killing [1, 2] , which is exemplified by chronic granulomatous disease, a congenital disorder with deficient phagocyte function and recurrent purulent infections including pneumonia [3] . However, this inflammatory process, which is primarily limited to the infected organ can, if not adequately terminated, lead to sepsis and multiorgan failure [4, 5] . Prognostic indicators, which can be quantified in an early phase of disease when infection is still compartmentalized and which are correlated to disease severity and outcome are needed. Since alveolar macrophages are the principal resident phagocytes in the airways they are thought to play an important role in the initial phase of host response. It is evident that small amounts of inhaled bacteria are eradicated effectively by alveolar macrophages. With increasing virulence and numbers of microorganisms a rapid neutrophil influx occurs to combat invading bacteria [6, 7] . In this context a variety of chemokines have been identified, which recruit neutrophils to the lung [8] . Among them interleukin-8 appears to play a central role [9] . High inter-leukin-8 levels in the alveolar space have been associated with neutrophil influx into the pulmonary compartment under various conditions [10] [11] [12] . It could further be demonstrated that interleukin-8 is of some prognostic value in patients at risk of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [13] or in AIDS-associated Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia [14] . In this study we focused on nonventilated patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The aim was to elucidate the state of cellular immunological activation in the alveolar compartment in patients who underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for microbiological diagnosis. We quantified alveolar macrophage interleukin-8 secretions as well as interleukin-8 levels in BALF together with other'parameters of phagocyte funetion such as oxidative response, the concentration of neutrophil secretion products and markers of alveolo-endothelial membrane integrity, relating our findings to clinical disease severity and lung functional impairment.",

The diagnosis of pneumonia was based on clinical symptoms and laboratory signs of infection (fever > 38\u00b0C, purulent sputum, elevated ESR, C-reactive protein and white blood cell count), together with the presence of new or progressing opacities on chest radiograph. The average age of the patients was 51 years with a range of 27-74 years. Seventeen were male, 19 female. Thirteen patients were immunocompromised for various reasons (hematologic malignancy: n = 3, renal transplantation: n = 4, cytotoxic therapy for systemic vasculitis: n = 6). Patients who had received antibiotic treatment before admission (n = 19), were bronchoscopically evaluated after a 24 h discontinuation of therapy, if possible. Patients without prior antibiotic therapy were evaluated within 24 h after admission. Thirteen patients who underwent bronchoscopy for evaluation of peripheral lung consolidation (nine male, four female, mean age 54 years), who had no clinical signs of local or systemic inflammation were accepted as age matched controls. In addition, six healthy nonsmoking volunteers were studied. None of our patients died. To quantify impairment of gas exchange all individuals had blood gas analysis on the day of BAL. Informed consent was obtained from all patients and controls and the study of healthy volunteers was approved by the ethical committee of Lt~beck Medical University.",

Nonadherent cells were removed by gentle washing with warm cell culture medium. After another incubation period of 16 h supernatants from triplicate wells were removed, pooled and immediately frozen at -80\u00b0C until use. Interleukin-8 was determined by a sandwich ELISA using commercially available antibodies. Briefly, 96-well flat bottom microtiter plates were covered with a polyclonal goat anti-IL-8 antibody over night (R&D Systems, USA). After washing and blocking of nonspecific binding sites supernatants from AM were diluted 1:50 and incubated for 4 h. BALF was used undiluted in this assay. A commercially available monoclonal anti-IL-8 antibody (clone 6217.11, R&D Systems) was used as capture antibody and the reaction was quantified photometrically at 405 nm using ABTS as substrate. Recombinant human interleukin-8 (R&D Systems) was used to produce a standard curve. Lower detection limit of this assay was 0.05 ng/ml. Inter-and intraassay variations were 8% and 7%, respectively.",

            "text": "The main result of this study is that during community-acquired pneumonia alveolar macrophages release high amounts of interleukin-8, thereby triggering neutrophil accumulation and activation with respect to spontaneous chemiluminescence in the alveolar compartment. These results are in accordance with recently published reports demonstrating high interleukin-8 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in neutrophil alveolitis of other origin [9, 10, 21] , mostly in critically ill patients with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation and with high mortality in those study cohorts [11, 13, 22] . In contrast, we concentrated on nonventilated pneumonia patients. In addition, most current research was performed using only BALF to quantify cytokine levels in the pulmonary compartment [11, 13] . With the use of BALF a variable dilution error has to be considered, which is due to the increased capillary leakage in lung inflammation of bacterial pneumonia [23] . In accordance with previous studies, this phenomenon is reflected by high albumin levels in BALF of our pneumonia patients as compared to both control groups [23] . Furthermore, cytokine production from many different cell populations (e.g. alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, endothelial and epithelial cells) will be summarized. Although alveolar macrophages are the primary source for interleukin-8 in lung inflammation [9, 13, 25] , all of these cells are able to produce interleukin-8 [26, 27] . The additional objective for using isolated alveolar macrophages was that alveolar macrophages provide first line contact with the invading microorganism in vivo, resulting in the release of recruiting signals for neutrophils, among them interleukin-8 [9] . The possible ex vivo stimulation by adherence on plastic and some unavoidable contamination by neutrophils had to be taken into account. The fact that we could not demonstrate a correlation between interleukin-8 and neutrophil count in BAL is in agreement with other investigators [10, 11, 22] , who discussed the importance of other chemotactic mediators in the network of phagocyte activation in the lung. Furthermore, since both parameters were determined at one time point in the course of inflammatory events, the sequence in which macrophage interleukin-8 release is followed by neutrophil influx cannot be reflected. With regard to neutrophil activation we found a significant correlation between alveolar macrophage interleukin-8 release and oxidative response of alveolar neutrophils. The respiratory burst of pulmonary phagocytes is the central part of the nonspecific host response to pathogenic microorganisms [1, 16] . From our data we cannot distinguish whether neutrophil chemiluminescence is due to stimulation by interleukin-8, or bacteria or both. Considering current knowledge, it seems likely that interleukin-8 has a priming effect on the PMN oxidative response to triggering signals such as bacterial cell wall products [28] [29] [30] . Accordingly, in our patients we demonstrated a clear relationship between the bacterial load in the alveolar space and local interleukin-8 concentration as quantified in BALF and in alveolar macrophage supernatants. Although the mechanisms of host cell activation differ between gram-positive and gram:negative bacteria, the cascade finally leads to activation of cytokine release, expression of their receptors and upregulation of adhesion molecules on the cell surface. In our study population with predominant gram-negative infections, no difference between the various pathogens could be established, however, this type of investigation would require larger patient groups.",

This is an interesting observation, since distribution of lung infection as assessed by chest radiograph differed markedly in Our patients. Considering a recently published report demonstrating unilateral upreg-ulation of interleukin-8 in BALF of patients with lobar pneumonia [31] , this phenomenon cannot simply be explained by bronchogenic transfer of cytokines into noninfected parts of the lung. However, it might be possible that in bacterial pneumonia activation of the pulmonary immune system triggers recirculation and distribution of activated immune cells into the affected organ leading to local inflammation, endothelial cell damage and interstitial edema. Summarizing our findings, we could demonstrate that in bacterial pneumonia release of interleukin-8 by alveolar macrophages and other cells plays a central role in host response. This is followed by neutrophil influx and activation, which leads on the one hand to clearing of pathogenic microorganisms, and on the other hand to lung injury and organ malfunction: Larger patient groups and longterm follow-up studies are needed to evaluate the possible prognostic significance of these data.",

Every year about eight million patients have be treated for urinary tract infections in the USA; in Germany, there are about two million cases per year. More than 40% of all nosocomial infections are urinary tract infections. Therefore they are the most numerous hospital-acquired infectious diseases. Moreover, it has to be emphasized that 40 to 50% of nosocomial septic cases develop as a result of urinary tract infection. These facts underline the necessity of clarifying the pathogenesis of these diseases in greater detail and to develop better strategies of diagnostics and therapy. This book meets these demands quite well. Internationally accepted experts have compiled the latest results of research on clinical aspects and of the molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections. According to the importance of these diseases in the sense of so- All chapters provide an excellent stock-taking of the different aspects of urinary tract infection. The data presented are supplemented by extensive bibliographies following every article. The book is worth reading, and by its complexity yields an extensive survey of the latest results of research, which ultimately should be confirmed in clinical work.",
