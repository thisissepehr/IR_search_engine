We previously described the action of cyclic AMP in reducing phosphatidic acid to an inhibition of phospholipase c7. Further studies now reveal that the phosphatidylinositol cycle is not inhibited by cyclic AMP despite the profound reduction in the quantity of phosphatidate produced. Figure 3 describes the action of cyclic AMP on the reactions related to the increased turnover of phosphatidylinositol in platelets prelabelled with 32 P-orthophosphate. Cyclic AMP seems substantially to increase the rate of conversion of phosphatidate to phosphatidylinositol, thereby decreasing the steady state concentration of phosphatidate. As we are proposing that the production of arachidonic acid might be related to the formation of phosphatidate, this could serve as the basis for the cyclic AMP-induced inhibition of arachidonate production. In the presence of quinacrine, which completely blocks the formation of arachidonic acid from various phospholipids 6 \u2022 12 , thrombin greatly increases the breakdown and resynthesis (turnover) of phosphatidylinositol as shown by increased labelling of 32 Pphosphatidylinositol (Fig. 3) .
