            "text": "Background: This study aimed to establish a suitable in vitro system for investigating effects of respiratory pathogens and toxins on lung tissue bioenergetics (cellular respiration and ATP content) and caspase activity. Wistar rats and C57Bl/6 mice were anesthetized by sevoflurane inhalation. Lung fragments were then collected and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a continuously gassed (with 95% O 2 :5% CO 2 ) Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) or Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Phosphorescence O 2 analyzer that measured dissolved O 2 concentration as a function of time was used to monitor the rate of cellular mitochondrial O 2 consumption. Cellular ATP content was measured using the luciferin/luciferase system. The caspase-3 substrate N-acetyl-asp-glu-val-asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AMC) was used to monitor intracellular caspase activity; cleaved AMC moieties (reflecting caspase activity) were separated on HPLC and detected by fluorescence. Lung histology and immunostaining with anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody were also performed. Results: For Wistar rats, the values of k c and ATP for 0 < t \u2264 7 h (mean \u00b1 SD) were 0.15 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcM O 2 min -1 mg -1 (n = 18, coefficient of variation, Cv = 13%) and 131 \u00b1 69 pmol mg -1 (n = 16, Cv = 53%), respectively. The AMC peak areas remained relatively small despite a~5-fold rise over 6 h. Good tissue preservation was evident despite time-dependent increases in apoptotic cells. Lung tissue bioenergetics, caspase activity and structure were deleterious in unoxygenated or intermittently oxygenated solutions. Incubating lung tissue in O 2 depleted MEM for 30 min or anesthesia by urethane had no effect on lung bioenergetics, but produced higher caspase activity.",

Samples were exposed to light flashes (600 per min) from a pulsed light-emitting diode array with peak output at 625 nm (OTL630A-5-10-66-E, Opto Technology, Inc., Wheeling, IL). Emitted phosphorescent light was detected by a Hamamatsu photomultiplier tube after passing through an interference filter centered at 800 nm. The amplified phosphorescence decay was digitized at 1.0 MHz by a 20-MHz A/D converter (Computer Boards, Inc., Mansfield, MA).",

Immediately before ATP measurement, the samples were thawed and neutralized with 0.5 mL 100 mM Tris-acetate, 2 mM EDTA (final pH, 7.75). ATP concentration was determined using the Enliten ATP Assay System (Bioluminescence Detection Kit, Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, 2.5 \u03bcL of the supernatant was added to 25 \u03bcL of the luciferin/luciferase reagent. The luminescence intensity was then measured at 25\u00b0C using Glomax Luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI). The ATP standard curve ranged from 10 pM to 100 nM (R 2 >0.9999). Figure 1 shows Wistar rat lung tissue respiration, ATP content and caspase activity in 50 mL MEM that was continuously gassed with 95% O 2 : 5% CO 2 .

Briefly lung fragments were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 2.0 mL MEM with and without 200 \u03bcg glucose oxidase (which totally depleted O 2 from the solution) for 30 min. The samples were then rinsed with MEM and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 50 mL MEM (continuously gassed with 95% O 2 : 5% CO 2 ) for up to~7 h. At indicated time periods, samples were removed from the incubation medium and processed for measurements of O 2 consumption, ATP content and caspase activity. As shown in Figure 3A , the values of k c with and without pre-incubation with glucose oxidase were the same 0.14 \u00b1 0.00 (n = 3 and 4, respectively). The values of cellular ATP (done in triplicates) without treatment with glucose oxidase were 19.4 \u00b1 9.6 pmol mg -1 (n = 4, Cv = 49%) and with glucose oxidase 12.1 \u00b1 3.9 pmol mg -1 (n = 3, Cv = 32%), p = 0.400 ( Figure 3B ). Although, the AMC peak with glucose oxidase was relatively higher immediately post tissue collection ( Figure 3C-D) , its value did not significantly increase with time indicating no further caspase activation. The significance of background caspase activity at min zero (lung specimens immediately immersed in the Ac-DEVD-AMC reaction for 20 min) was unclear. The AMC peak area for Ac-DEVD-AMC incubated without lung specimen for 6 h was relatively small. Thus, the 30-min O 2 depletion had no measurable effects on cellular bioenergetics and caspase activity. The effects of the anesthetic agent sevoflurane vs. urethane were then tested. Lung fragments were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 50 mL MEM (continuously gassed with 95% O 2 : 5% CO 2 ) for up to~7 h. The values of k c for sevoflurane anesthesia were 0.15 \u00b1 0.01 (n = 4; Cv = 7%) and for urethane 0.16 \u00b1 0.02 (n = 3; Cv = 13%), p = 0.857 ( Figure 4A) . The values of cellular ATP ( Figure 4B , done in triplicates) for sevoflurane was 22.4 \u00b1 18.7 pmol mg -1 (n = 4, Cv = 83%) and for urethane 13.3 \u00b1 5.6 pmol mg -1 (n = 3, Cv = 42%), p = 0.857 ( Figure 4B ). The AMC moiety was stable with sevoflurane anesthesia over 6 h (3.0 \u00b1 0.5, n = 3), but progressively increased with time for urethane anesthesia (4.5 \u00b1 2.4, n = 3; p = 0.700), Figure 4C -D. The AMC peak area for Ac-DEVD-AMC incubated without lung specimen for 6 h was relatively small. Therefore, sevoflurane was the preferred anesthetic agent. Figure 5 shows two independent experiments of C57Bl/6 mouse lung tissue respiration and caspase activity in KH buffer (intermittently 60 sec every h) gassed with 95% O 2 : 5% CO 2 .

In oxygenated MEM at 3 h ( Figure 6B ), the pulmonary parenchyma is well preserved and composed of delicate thin alveolar wall lined by unremarkable pneumatocytes and a preserved bronchiolar epithelium; a few alveolar macrophages were noted. Tissue architecture is partially preserved at 6 h, with foci of alveolar edema, cytoplasmic disintegration of the alveolar lining epithelium and a few alveolar macrophages ( Figure 6C ). In unoxygenated MEM, tissue architecture was still preserved at 3 h, but with appearance of alveolar macrophages and early cytoplasmic disintegration of the alveolar lining epithelium ( Figure 6E ). Tissue preservation was poor at 6 h, showing collapse of alveolar walls, sloughing of bronchiolar epithelium and extravasation of red blood cells and fluid into alveolar spaces ( Figure 6F ).

Interruptions at any level, such as the cell membrane, mitochondria and enzymes lead to impaired energy conversion and ATP production [4] .

The procedure described in Figure 1 resulted in reasonable preservation of lung tissue bioenergetics and structure ( Figure 6B -C) for up to 6 h with minimum caspase activation. The success of this method relied on three critical Figure 6 Lung tissue histology. Lung fragments from a Wistar rat were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 50 mL MEM continuously gassed with 95% O 2 :5% CO 2 (Panels B-C) or kept without gassing (Panels E-F). The tissues were then processed for H&E staining at 0, 3, and 6 h. For Panel A-D, the lung specimen was fixed immediately after tissue collection. The pulmonary parenchyma was better preserved in oxygenated sample over 6 h compared to unoxygenated sample, which demonstrated signs of tissue death overtime characterized by collapse of alveolar walls with sloughing of bronchiolar epithelium, loss of pneumatocytes, extravasation of red blood cells and serum fluid into alveolar spaces. (Hematoxylin and eosin, H&E, 40x). procedural steps. The first step involved anesthesia and tissue collection. Anesthesia with sevoflurane and rapid (within 20 sec) removal of thin lung fragments from the animal were essential. It was vital to avoid organ ischemia or hypoxia before specimen collection, i.e., the organ should be well perfused during specimens' collection. The second step involved tissue processing which required immediate immersion of collected tissues in oxygenated ice-cold MEM or KH buffer. The specimens were then cut into small slices using a sharp blade or punch biopsy device, while remaining in ice cold buffer or MEM continuously gassed with 95% O 2 :5% CO 2 . The third step involved sample incubation in a large volume solution (e.g., 50 mL) with continuous gassing with 95% O 2 : 5% CO 2 . Having adhered to these procedural steps, a coefficient of variation (Cv) for rates of respiration of 13% and for ATP of 53% over 6 h was achieved. The larger variation in ATP was likely reflecting inability to maintain a tissue perfusion comparable to that of in vivo and induction of apoptosis ( Figure 7B-C) .",

This presumption was supported by the fact that caspase activity was noted by 2 hr (also see Figure 7E -F). Activation of caspases leads to opening of the transition permeability pores in the inner mitochondrial membranes, which results in uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. This process results in rapid cellular ATP and nutrient depletions. These two consequences contribute to further damage of lung tissue. Thus, initial toxic effects become compound by overwhelming insults resulting from mitochondrial and metabolic derangements. At this stage, inevitable cell death occurs despite the removal of the initial toxic insult, as cellular repair requires ATP. These concepts are relevant to human lung diseases, such as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Interestingly, the findings in Figure 2 were not reproduced in later experiments when lung tissue was incubated in O 2 depleted buffer for 30 min (Figure 3 ). This result could be explained by residual cellular ATP under our experimental conditions (rather Figure 7 Lung tissue caspase-3 immunostaining.

The lung should be well perfused and oxygenated throughout the procedure. Another limitation is the use of high oxygen concentration during in vitro incubation, which may promote free radical reactions. Thus, the described system is not ideal for testing pathogens, as exposure to high concentrations of O 2 may produce non-physiological aberrations. The use of 95% oxygen, however, was not associated with noticeable toxicities ( Figure 1) . Nevertheless, this method may not be applicable to toxins that are likely to generate reactive oxygen species. Adequate buffering with a free radical scavenger (e.g., glutathione) may be helpful. The use of air-saturated buffer (Figure 2) , intermittently oxygenated solution (Additional file 1: Figure S1 , Panels A-C) or room air saturated with 5% CO 2 (Additional file 1: Figure S2 , Panel A) was associated with impaired cellular bioenergetics.",

Lung fragments were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 50 mL MEM (continuously gassed with 95% O 2 : 5% CO 2 ) for up to~7 h. At indicated time periods, samples were removed from the incubation medium and processed for measurements of O 2 consumption, ATP content and caspase activity. Panel A: Runs of cellular mitochondrial O 2 consumption are shown; t = 0 corresponds to animal sacrifice. The rate of respiration (k, \u03bcM O 2 min -1 ) was set as the negative of the slope of [O 2 ] vs. t. The values of k c (\u03bcM O 2 min -1 mg -1 ) are shown at the bottom of each run. Panel B: The values of k c and ATP are plotted as a function of incubation time. Panel C: HPLC runs of caspase activity at 0, 2, 4 and 6 h of incubation. The retention time (R t ) for Ac-DEVD-AMC was~2.5 min and AMC~4.8 min (insert, reflecting caspase activity).
