RGD motifs in VP1 and VP2 are present at the peaks of a single hydrophilic domain, as shown using a Kyte and Doolittle hydropathy plot [22] . These RGD sequences may therefore be functional. An additional RGD motif is present in a hydrophilic region of CTF virus VP1 (amino acid 1071-1073) but this site is not conserved in EYA virus VP1. Other significant sequence features -read-through phenomenon Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of segment 9 of both EYA virus and CTF virus, revealed the presence of an opal stop codon belonging to the class of so-called \"leaky\" stop codons. This stop codon is flanked at its 3 -end by a cytosine residue, a configuration that has been shown in retroviruses [14] and alphaviruses [42] to allow \"read-through.\" This phenomenon results from the incorporation of arginine, cysteine or tryptophan in the usual stop codon [14] . Accordingly, two proteins might be synthesized, the first encoded by the ORF between nucleotides 41 and 1054 (ORF1 encoding the protein VP9), the second encoded by the ORF between nucleotides 41 and 1846 (ORF2 encoding VP9 ). Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of segment 9 of CTF virus and EYA virus shows that the sequence variation is mainly a function of the third position of the codon. The ORF1 variations at the third position of the codons were calculated using the number of differences estimation method and found to represent 66.4% of the overall variation in this ORF, while the remaining 33.6% were shared by positions 1 and 2. An identical magnitude of variation was found in the part of ORF2 beyond the leaky stop codon. Clearly, this nucleotide variation was not randomly distributed (66.5% at the third position versus 33.4% at positions 1 . This result indicates that this region of segment 9 is submitted to the same kind of genetic selective pressure as regions encoding viral proteins. It is therefore very likely that this region of ORF2 is translated during viral replication. In addition, using the Kyte and Doolittle hydropathy plotting system (with an 11 amino acid sliding window) on the deduced proteins (beyond the suspected leaky stop codon) showed that the putative proteins of CTF and EYA viruses are very similar (Fig. 2) . This indicates that the function of the encoded proteins of the two viruses is highly conserved.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 219, "end": 222, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 223, "end": 226, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 565, "end": 569, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1133, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1151, "end": 1155, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1288, "end": 1292, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2645, "end": 2653, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Identification of other known functional motifs -presence of RGD motifs"}, {"text": "The amino acid identity between homologous proteins of CTF and EYA viruses ranged from 55 to 88%, with similarity ranging between 72 and 93% (Fig. 2) .

Electron dense particles, 45 nm in diameter, were found scattered throughout these granular matrices and especially at their edges; these particles were indistinguishable from cores of progeny virus particles (Figs. 4, 5) .
