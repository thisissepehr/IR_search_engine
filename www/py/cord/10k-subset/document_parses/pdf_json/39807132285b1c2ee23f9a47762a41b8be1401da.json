            "text": "Background: Allograft fibrosis still remains a critical problem in transplantation, including heart transplantation. The IL-13/TGF-\u03b2 1 interaction has previously been identified as a key pathway orchestrating fibrosis in different inflammatory immune disorders. Here we investigate if this pathway is also responsible for allograft fibrosis and if interference with the IL-13/TGF-\u03b2 1 interaction prevents allograft fibrosis. Methods: FVB or control DBA/1 donor hearts were transplanted heterotopically into DBA/1 recipient mice and hearts were explanted at day 60 and 100 post-transplantation. Cardiac tissue was examined by Masson's trichrome staining and immunohistochemistry for CD4, CD8, CD11b, IL-13, Fas ligand, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-13, \u03b22-microglobulin, and Gremlin-1. Graft-infiltrating cells were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry. IL-13 and TGF-\u03b2 1 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the amount of collagen was quantified using a Sircol assay; IL-13R\u03b1 2 expression was detected by Western blotting. In some experiments IL-13/ TGF-\u03b2 1 signaling was blocked with specific IL-13R\u03b1 2 siRNA. Additionally, a PCR array of RNA isolated from the allografts was performed to analyze expression of multiple genes involved in fibrosis. Results: Both groups survived long-term (>100 days). The allogeneic grafts were infiltrated by significantly increased numbers of CD4 + (P <0.0001), CD8 + (P <0.0001), and CD11b + cells (P = 0.0065) by day 100. Furthermore, elevated IL-13 levels (P = 0.0003) and numbers of infiltrating IL-13 + cells (P = 0.0037), together with an expression of IL-13R\u03b1 2 , were detected only within allografts. The expression of IL-13 and IL-13R\u03b1 2 resulted in significantly increased TGF-\u03b2 1 levels (P <0.0001), higher numbers of CD11b high Gr1 intermediate TGF-\u03b2 1 + cells, and elevated cardiac collagen deposition (P = 0.0094). The allograft fibrosis found in these experiments was accompanied by upregulation of multiple profibrotic genes, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical stainings of allograft tissue. Blockage of the IL-13/TGF-\u03b2 1 interaction by IL-13R\u03b1 2 siRNA led to lower numbers of CD11b high Gr1 intermediate TGF-\u03b2 1 + , CD4 + , CD8 + , and CD11b + cells, and prevented collagen deposition (P = 0.0018) within these allografts.",

Recent immunosuppressive strategies have reduced acute rejection episodes and improved early cardiac graft survival [2] . However, these improvements did not ameliorate chronic allograft rejection, which remains an obstacle for better long-term heart transplant survival [3] . Chronic rejection of an allograft causes an intimal fibrosis in the vessels that leads to cardiac allograft vasculopathy [4] . Another consequence of chronic rejection and inflammation is cardiac fibrosis accompanied by increased stiffness of the heart and diminished contractility [5] . Ultimately, these fibrotic reactions can result in myocardial infarction or sudden death [4, 6] .",

            "text": "On a molecular level, fibrosis is associated with a disruption of the extracellular matrix and with deposition of extracellular collagen produced by myofibroblasts [5] . In various studies TGF-\u03b2 1 has been identified as the key cytokine orchestrating fibrosis development [7, 8] . TGF-\u03b2 1 is produced by macrophages after stimulation by IL-13 via the IL-13R\u03b1 2 in the presence of IL-4 or TNF-\u03b1 [9] . Further studies have shown that this pathway is a key initiation point for a complex fibrotic program in chronic TNBS colitis [10] . Additionally, it has been demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 1 inhibition ameliorates lung fibrosis, chronic allograft nephropathy, and also cardiac allograft fibrosis [11] [12] [13] . However, no effective therapy to prevent heart allograft fibrosis has been identified so far, possibly because ideal murine transplant models have been lacking to study potential targets and therapies. A mouse model for the examination of cardiac allograft fibrosis should enable long-term survival of a transplanted allograft and develop cardiac fibrosis in the setting of chronic rejection. Tanaka et al. have developed a transplantation model in which FVB (H-2q) donor hearts were placed into DBA/1 recipients that display a similar major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (H-2q), but different non-MHC genes (CD5, CD8a, NK1.1, and Thy-1) [14] . In this model, the heart allografts survive for up to more than 100 days without immunosuppression and developed graft coronary artery disease as the result of chronic rejection.",

Flow cytometric analysis of graft-infiltrating cells from hearts harvested 100 days after transplantation showed a low percentage of CD11b high Gr1 intermediate TGF-\u03b2 1 + cells (0.3%) in the siRNAtreated group compared to controls (4.2%; Figure 6A ). Furthermore, quantification of collagen by the Sircol assay showed significantly less collagen levels in mice treated with specific IL-13R\u03b1 2 siRNA compared to mice treated with control siRNA (122 \u00b1 23 versus 314 \u00b1 28 \u03bcg/mg allograft protein; P = 0.0018) ( Figure 6B ). This was in accordance with Masson's trichrome staining, in which only small areas of collagen deposition were observed in siRNA-treated hearts, whereas extensive amounts of collagen were detected in control allografts ( Figure 6C ). To test whether the differences in TGF-\u03b2 1 production caused imbalances in CD4 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs), a flow cytometric analysis of cells from allografts was performed 100 days after transplantation. However, CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs were found to be present at equal levels in siRNA-and control siRNA-injected animals (15.6% versus 15.2%, respectively; Figure 6D ). Immunohistochemical staining of allografts after therapy with specific IL-13R\u03b1 2 siRNA showed levels of CD4 + , CD8 + , and CD11b + cells that were much lower after treatment with control siRNA, but similar to syngeneic transplanted animals ( Figure 6E versus Figure 1A ,B,C).",

Multiple studies have demonstrated that IL-13 is essential for the development of dermal, gastrointestinal, and pulmonary fibrosis, as well as fibro-obliterative lesions found in the bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) syndrome [9, 10, [17] [18] [19] [20] . Consistent with these studies, IL-13R\u03b1 2 was detected only in the FVB allografts transplanted into DBA/1 recipients in our experiments. This receptor has been shown to link IL-13 signaling with further fibrotic downstream effects [9, 21] . In follow-up, we detected elevated levels of TGF-\u03b2 1 in the mice receiving allogeneic grafts exclusively. Results from previous studies have indicated that TGF-\u03b2 1 is the key cytokine for development of allograft fibrosis in murine models and in humans, and that depletion of TGF-\u03b2 1 can prevent allograft fibrosis [7, 12, 22] . Other cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-17 can modulate the TGF-\u03b2 1 -mediated fibrotic reactions [7, 8] . Additionally, a study by Faust et al. concluded that T cell TGF-\u03b2 signaling was required for the development of allograft fibrosis [8] . In parallel to the elevated levels of TGF-\u03b2 1 , we found increased allograft-infiltration with CD11b high Gr1 intermediate TGF-\u03b2 1 + cells in the DBA/1 mice transplanted with FVB allografts; it has been shown by our group and others that CD11b high Gr1 intermediate cells are the main source for TGF-\u03b2 1 production [23] [24] [25] . In the allogeneic situation of the mouse model we used, activation of the profibrotic IL-13/TGF-\u03b2 1 interaction led to allograft fibrosis that was continuously increasing over time after transplantation.",

The reduction of TGF-\u03b2 1 -producing cells and reduced TGF-\u03b2 1 levels consequently led to diminished collagen deposition in heart allografts and therefore reduced allograft fibrosis. Tregs were also considered as contributors to the TGF-\u03b2 1 effect. While CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs can produce TGF-\u03b2 1 to mediate their tolerogenic functions and expand induced regulatory T cells (iTregs), there was no difference in their numbers in control versus IL-13R\u03b1 2 siRNA-injected mice [26] [27] [28] [29] .

            "text": "For our investigations, we used a heterotopic murine heart transplantation model in which FVB hearts were placed in DBA/1 recipients. This chronic rejection model with minor multiple non-MHC mismatches has been used previously to study graft coronary artery disease [14] . We show that the FVB to DBA/1 model can also be used to examine allograft fibrosis. Over time, transplanted allografts are infiltrated by increasing numbers of CD4 + , CD8 + , and CD11b + cells, a fact that was also observed by Tanaka et al. in the original description of this transplantation model [14] . We further demonstrated by PCR array that a 'fibrotic program' is active in this FVB to DBA/1 model. Profibrotic factors such as IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 that play a role in liver fibrosis development, and TNF-\u03b1 which is an essential cofactor of IL-13 to induce the expression of IL-13R\u03b1 2 , were upregulated. Further, Ccl-12 and Cxcr-4 that were both shown to be involved in pulmonary fibrosis, Ccl-3 which has been described to be important in systemic sclerosis, and Ccr-2 that is associated with allograft fibrosis, were overexpressed [9, [30] [31] [32] [33] . Additionally, the PCR array showed upregulation of other influential molecules such as Fas/Fas ligand, which is important in the development of fibrotic lesions associated with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). MMP-1 and MMP-13 (involved in remodeling processes occurring during fibrosis) and \u03b22-microglobuin were also overexpressed in the PCR array and positive in the immunohistochemistry of FVB allografts transplanted into DBA/1 recipients [34] [35] [36] . In contrast, genes like Gremlin-1 that may contribute to reversibility of lung fibrosis in rats, and Smad6 which in complex with Smurf-1 effectively attenuated TGF-\u03b2 1 signaling, were downregulated [37, 38] . Altogether, these findings support the fact that this FVB to DBA/1 transplantation model is suitable not only to study graft coronary artery disease, but also to examine organ allograft fibrosis.",

Further, we demonstrate in this study that blockage of this IL-13/TGF\u03b2 1 interaction by IL-13R\u03b1 2 siRNA prevents heart allograft fibrosis. Together, our results indicate that IL-13R\u03b1 2 may be exploitable as a future target to reduce allograft fibrosis in organ transplantation.",
