The percentage of cats with FIP and AGPpositive neutrophils was not significantly higher than in the control group, but among FCoV-positive cats the proportion of cats expressing AGP on neutrophils was higher among sick compared with healthy cats. However, some clinically healthy cats did have AGP-positive leucocytes in their blood, which may have been related to stress or fear.

This was presumed to be secondary to neurogenic dysphagia, which is a common presenting sign of Chiari malformations in humans, but has been rarely described in veterinary literature. Decompressive surgery of the foramen magnum in this case was deemed essential, given the unique life-threatening clinical signs, and the dog responded rapidly. There was no recurrence of clinical signs in the 3 years after surgery.",

The developing brain shows an age-dependent response to TBI and the immature nervous system often responds differently to that of an adult. The outcome in young animals after TBI is complex, in part because recovery is superimposed upon developmental events. The author concludes that it is clear that even in human medicine there is much to be understood about TBI in the developing brain.",

After the clips were applied to Merino lambs, they were left on for 1-14 days and the bare area scores determined after 60 days. Clips increased the size of the perineal and tail bare areas if left on the lambs for a minimum of 4-6 days. The increases in the size of the perineal and tail bare areas were similar to the results of previous studies. However, the authors note that further research is still required to determine the degree of protection against flystrike provided by the clips.",

It has been suggested that they may interact synergistically, promoting production of high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid in the synovial fluid, thereby providing superior treatment for OA than either agent alone. The effects of weekly intra-articular injections for 3 weeks of a combination of PPS and GLC were investigated. There were changes in total nucleated cells in the synovial fluid, total protein concentrations and neutrophil percentages in both PPS/GLC-treated and control groups, depending on the day after treatment. The authors conclude that both agents are safe for use in the horse.",
