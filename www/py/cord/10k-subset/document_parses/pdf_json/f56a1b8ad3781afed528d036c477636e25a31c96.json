Decisionmakers are thought to rely on both numerical and narrative information to the extent that they perceive the information to be diagnostic, accurate, and trustworthy. In two studies, we explored how lay decisionmakers varying in numeracy evaluated and used likelihood assessments and narrative evidence in forecasts. Overall, the less numerate reported higher risk and likelihood perceptions. In simple probabilistic forecasts without narrative evidence, decisionmakers at all levels of numeracy were able to use the stated likelihood information, although risk perceptions of the less numerate were more affected by likelihood format. When a forecast includes narrative evidence, decisionmakers were better able to use stated likelihood in a percentage as compared to frequency or verbal formats. The more numerate used stated likelihood more in their evaluations whereas the less numerate focused more on the narrative evidence. These results have important implications for risk analysts and forecasters who need to report the results of their analyses to decisionmakers. Decisionmakers varying in numerical ability may evaluate forecasts in different ways depending on the types of information they find easiest to evaluate.",

            "text": "There are many risk communication and forecasting contexts in which decisionmakers are presented with narrative evidence or other contextual information along with assessments of likelihood or risk. Different kinds of contextual information can accompany a likelihood assessment. For instance, anecdotal information about another person's experience with a medical treatment or event can be included when providing a likelihood assessment. Forecasters can also present reasons, justification, or logic supporting a likelihood assessment. In the legal domain, for instance, an expert witness may present supporting ev- idence in the form of a narrative and conclude with an opinion that there is an x% chance that the target event occurred. An intelligence analyst may prepare a report that includes both a discussion outlining his or her interpretation of the weight and inferential force of the evidence concerning an event along with numeric assessments of likelihood. This latter type of contextual information is called narrative evidence in this article. In these forecasting situations, decisionmakers will need to assess how much to trust the analysis of the expert and how to judge the overall risk of the forecasted event.",

            "text": "Several different factors will affect how a decisionmaker perceives a risk forecast. The first are characteristics of the risk forecast. Both the nature of the narrative evidence and the format of the likelihood assessment (e.g., verbal, percentage, or frequency representations of likelihood) may influence how decisionmakers feel about the quality of a forecast and the risk associated with the forecasted event. For instance, it is not clear whether decisionmakers will better use frequency (i.e., 1 out of 10) or standard likelihood representations (i.e., 1 or 10%) when evaluating likelihood assessments in simple forecasting contexts. Waters et al. (7) found that participants made more accurate assessments of total risk in a medical trade-off situation when likelihood was reported as a percentage as opposed to a frequency; however, performance was very similar between percentage and frequency formats across a range of operations. 1 In fact, recent research suggests that the usefulness of percentage versus frequency formats depends on the specific operations required of the decisionmaker. (12) The skills and characteristics of the individual decisionmakers may also affect how a decisionmaker perceives a risk forecast. Although several individual difference factors and competencies may affect perceptions of risk forecasts (e.g., worldview, political stance, etc.), we focus on numeracy. Numeracy defined in the broadest sense is the ability to 1 Gigerenzer and colleagues have argued that natural frequency representations of probability are more amenable to clear understanding and improve statistical thinking in Bayesian inference problems. (8\u221210) However, natural frequency representations are distinct from normalized representations of probability (i.e., probability representations with base rate information removed as in 20% or 20 out of 100 (11) ). We are studying normalized single-event probability assessments that are typically used by experts in forecasts.",

First, all decisionmakers may try to use the stated likelihood in a forecast but the less numerate may evaluate probabilities in a more imprecise and idiosyncratic way (i.e., less numerate decisionmakers may have very different evaluations of a 10% chance). In addition, because less numerate participants may have difficulty evaluating numerical probabilities, they may also be more affected by how the likelihood information is communicated. Peters et al. (18) examined how individuals varying in numeracy were able to understand and use probabilities expressed in different formats and to what extent they were affected by information framing. Less numerate decisionmakers were more affected by framing manipulations and interpreted identical likelihood information differently depending on whether it was in frequency (10 out of 100) or percentage form (10% out of 100).",

On the basis of the similar pattern of relations between the variables and model parsimony, the credibility and coherence ratings were averaged to create a composite variable. The likelihood ratings were SQRT transformed in all analyses to reduce extreme positive skewness.

However, since both the stated likelihood and narrative evidence are valid sources of information in the forecast, it is not clear whether it is best to focus on the stated likelihood or the narrative evidence. What is important is that decisionmakers with different levels of numeracy may focus on different information sources and potentially reach different conclusions regarding a forecasted event.

The lower ratings of usefulness, knowledge, and trust may reflect the richer knowledge of the more numerate about the difficulty of forecasting events such as terrorist attacks in the real world and the particular difficulty in assigning likelihood point estimates to events that involve such deep uncertainty. This result also suggests that decisionmakers lower in numeracy may give undue weight to forecasts without acknowledging the inherent analytic uncertainty involved. This is one reason why analysts should report their level of analytic confidence in some fashion. (30) In addition, we found that the less numerate appeared to use the narrative evidence to a larger extent than the more numerate, which could also explain their higher overall risk and likelihood ratings. The more numerate, on the other hand, used the explicit likelihood to a larger extent than the less numerate. Given the amount of numerical information that is presented to decisionmakers in this information-rich age, differences in numeracy have the potential to have a substantial effect on decisionmakers' perceptions and eventual decisions. These results are particularly important given that even highly educated individuals can be low in numeracy. (31) This has important implications for risk analysts and forecasters who need to report the results of their analyses to decisionmakers. Decisionmakers varying in numerical ability may arrive at very different perceptions of the risk of a forecasted event depending on what pieces of information they focus on. These different risk perceptions have the potential to lead to very different risk management decisions. Thus, even though an explicit likelihood estimate is presented, it does not mean that all decisionmakers are going to reach similar feelings about risk, particularly if they are focusing more on one source of relevant information over another. Additional research needs to be directed at how to present forecasts and risk analyses in a way that is interpretable to the majority of decisionmakers and accurately presents the opinions of the forecaster.",

Another limitation to the generalizability of the results was the relatively narrow range of numerical likelihood that was manipulated (1-20%). The extent to which decisionmakers are sensitive to the numerical likelihood and narrative evidence may depend on the range of likelihood values presented. More research is needed on how consumers make judgments of likelihood when presented with a wider spectrum of assessed likelihood. Finally, the evidence supporting differential information use by decisionmakers varying in numeracy is correlational in nature. Future work should focus on manipulating properties of the supporting narrative evidence to test causal hypotheses and to identify the properties of the narrative evidence that have the largest effects on evaluations of forecasts. 12 ",

Of 100 women like her, 10 of them actually have a malignant tumor and 90 of them do not. Of the 10 women who actually have a tumor, the mammography indicates correctly that 9 of them have a tumor and indicates incorrectly that 1 of them does not have a tumor. Of the 90 women who do not have a tumor, the mammography indicates correctly that 81 of them do not have a tumor and indicates incorrectly that 9 of them do have a tumor. The table below summarizes all of this information. Imagine that your friends tests positive (as if she had a tumor), what is the likelihood that she actually has a tumor?13. Imagine that you are taking a class and your chances of being asked a question in class are 1% during the first week of class and double each week thereafter (i.e., you would have a 2% chance in Week 2, a 4% chance in Week 3, an 8% chance in Week 4). What is the probability that you will be asked a question in class during Week 7?Answer: % 14. Suppose that 1 out of every 10,000 doctors in a certain region is infected with the SARS virus; in the same region, 20 out of every 100 people in a particular at-risk population also are infected with the virus. A test for the virus gives a positive result in 99% of those who are infected and in 1% of those who are not infected. A randomly selected doctor and a randomly selected person in the at-risk population in this region both test positive for the disease. Who is more likely to actually have the disease?They both tested positive for SARS and therefore are equally likely to have the disease They both tested positive for SARS and the doctor is more likely to have the disease They both tested positive for SARS and the person in the at-risk population is more likely to have the disease.",
