Between December 1999 and March 2001, three adults aged from 23 to 67 years were admitted to our respiratory intensive care unit for massive hemoptysis and septic shock associated with community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. Isolates were sent to the Centre National de R\u00e9f\u00e9rence des Tox\u00e9mies Staphylococciques in Lyon, France, where they were found to secrete Panton-Valentive leukocidin. The clinical course was similar in the three patients, with massive hemoptysis and septic shock necessitating mechanical ventilation. Two patients died rapidly; necropsy showed pulmonary vascular necrosis in one of them. The third patient recovered after appropriate antibiotic therapy. Leukocidin/neutrophil inter-actions in the pulmonary vasculature may cause severe hemoptysis in patients with community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia secreting Panton-Valentine leukocidin. Adult patients with massive hemoptysis and suspected communityacquired pneumonia should receive antibiotic regimens covering Staphylococcus aureus.",

            "text": "Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) accounts for 1-9% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [1] and up to 20% in intensive care units [2] . It typically involves patients over 60 years of age with predisposing factors. The clinical course is generally subacute, but the mortality rate is high despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Hemoptysis is uncommon in adults [3, 4] and reports of massive hemoptysis have been described especially in children [5, 6, 7] . We describe three new consecutive cases of life-threatening hemoptysis in adults with Sa-CAP, discuss the role of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and focus on the particular clinical presentation of this new entity recently referred to as \"Staphylococcus aureus necrotising pneumonia\" [6] . V On 30 December 1999, a 67-year-old smoker and alcoholic was referred to our hospital with massive hemoptysis for bronchial artery opacification and embolization (BAO). He had undergone surgery for throat cancer in 1994 and was on enalapril for hypertension. Two days prior to admission he had been prescribed amoxicillin and steroids for chills, dry cough and fever. On admission his temperature was 38\u00b0C, heart rate 110 beats/min and respiratory rate 22 breaths/min under high-tension oxygen mask. His blood pressure was 140/70 mmHg. Physical examination was normal except for diffuse pulmonary crackles. Chest X-ray examination showed alveolar opacities of the left lung; alveolar opacities were diffuse over the entire lungs on pulmonary computed tomography (CT), but CT was non-contributory regarding the cause of massive hemoptysis. Blood gas values on 9 l oxygen/min were as follows: pH 7.28, PCO 2 40 mmHg (5.3 kPa) and PO 2 80 mmHg (10.6 kPa). The circulating white-cell count was 4000\u00d710 9 /l, hematocrit 39% and platelet count 207,000\u00d710 9 /l. The prothrombin time was 78% and creatinine 117 \u00b5mol/l. Electrocardiogram was normal and mitral stenosis was ruled out by cardiac echography. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FB) showed active bleeding, predominantly from the left main stem bronchus, with bilateral flooding. Tracheal aspiration (TA), telescopic protected brushing (TPB) and blood culture (BC) were performed for microbiological analysis. Direct examination of Gram-stained smears of TA and TPB was negative.",

Only patient 2 had evidence of renal failure, thrombocytopenia and clotting disorders, but these were related to septic shock; indeed, necropsy revealed no specific lesions other than those resulting from bacterial pneumonia. Tuberculosis and aspergillosis were also ruled out. Goodpasture's syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis and systemic lupus erythematosus were unlikely causes of the hemoptysis, as tests for AGBM, ANCA and ANA autoantibodies were negative.

Our patients had diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), but erosion of larger vessels was also probable. Indeed, endoscopy showed bilateral active bleeding in each case. Furthermore, in case 1 bronchial arteriography revealed left lower endobronchial opacification reflecting arterial erosion, but bleeding persisted despite BAO. Finally, necrotic lesions of the tracheal mucosa and alveolar septa were observed at necropsy in case 2. These pathological findings are similar to those described by Lina et al. [10] and Gillet et al. [6] and referred to as \"Staphylococcus aureus necrotising pneumonia\" [6] .",

PVL belongs to a family of synergohymenotropins secreted by fewer than 2% of Sa strains [10, 11] . It is found in 75% of patients with furunculosis [12] . Its pathogenicity is related to its toxicity for white cells, especially neutrophils, to which it binds via a G-protein-coupled specific membrane receptor [13] . This interaction leads to PVL-concentration-dependent neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells, followed by capillary dilation, leukocyte diapedesis and vascular necrosis due to release of oxygen metabolites, IL-8, LTB4 and enzymes, as demonstrated in animal models [14, 15] . We hypothesized that a similar phenomenon occurs in the pulmonary vascular beds of our patients leading to intense bleeding and alveolar flooding, an unusual mechanism of dyspnea among patients with CAP. In addition, the pathogenicity of PVL might explain the leucopenia also observed in two of our patients (2 and 3) [6] .",
