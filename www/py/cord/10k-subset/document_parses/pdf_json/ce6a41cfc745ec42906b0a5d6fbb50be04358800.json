Lesions attributable to focal or widespread CMV infection can involve many organs, including the retina, liver, lung, and the gastrointestinal tract. 3 In immunocompetent individuals it is rare but it can affect patients with diabetes 4 and severe trauma. 5 Gastrointestinal CMV disease is not infrequently encountered in seemingly immunocompetent patients without a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. It can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, with esophagus and colon being the most common sites. 6 The clinical manifestations include malaise, anorexia, fever, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, ileus, gastrointestinal bleeding, and perforation. 7 The mortality is high and the prognosis is particularly poor in elderly individuals (over 65 years).",

            "text": "Acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome is almost nonexistent in the Western world, while few cases have been reported in Japan. 9 It affects the elderly population and is characterized by a sudden onset of massive, painless hemorrhaging from rectal ulcers and serious medical illness for which other causes are excluded. 9 Rectal ulcers are usually above the dentate line, and can be solitary or multiple without significant inflammation or ecchymosis. 10 It may be difficult to differentiate this disease from infective rectal ulcers. However, a negative culture of stool and biopsy specimen and absence of intranuclear inclusion bodies (typical of CMV infection) in biopsy tissue specimens can help in making an accurate diagnosis. 2, 10 Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (mucosal prolapse syndrome) is a clinical condition associated with functional anorectal evacuatory disorders. 11 The diagnosis is based on the patient history, the endoscopic appearance, and a histological examination of the biopsy specimen. The macroscopic appearance ranges from hyperemia to ulceration or even a polypoid lesion, and the lesions are not necessarily solitary. The microscopic features include mucosal thickening, fibrosis, and extension of smooth muscle fibers upward between the crypts, and full thickness rectal histology reveals architectural derangements. 12 Stercoral ulceration is the loss of bowel integrity from the pressure effects of inspissated feces. 13 Such lesions usually occur in constipated, bedridden patients and present as an isolated lesion in the rectosigmoid area, and a solid fecal mass is usually adherent to the margin of the ulcer. 10 Perforation and hemorrhaging are the principal complications resulting in a high mortality if not diagnosed early. 13, 14 The diagnosis of perforated stercoral ulceration should be considered in any patient with a long-standing history of constipation who presents with acute abdominal pain and clinical findings consistent with a perforation of a hollow viscus. Macroscopically the lesions are round or oval and the microscopic characteristics are represented by superficial ischemic necrosis of the rectal wall. 15 The rectal wall is usually inflamed and edematous, and characterized by multiple, shallow, serpigenous ulcerations in amoebic proctitis. The diagnosis is confirmed by a history, stool culture, biopsy (detection of trophozoites), and serology. 7 Rectal tuberculosis is rare in the absence of other lesions in the chest and small and large intestine. 16 Radiation-and drug-induced proctitis can readily be excluded based on the patient's history. 10 Ischemic proctitis is often associated with clearly identifiable precipitating factors (aortoiliac procedure, shock, and sepsis) and lesions are characterized by edema and erythema either with or without ulceration. It can be ruled out by a negative stool culture, endoscopic findings, and the absence of inclusion bodies in the biopsy specimen. 10 Cytomegalovirus colitis is usually associated with mucosal lesions that are probably due to vascular endothelial infection, thus leading to endothelial cell swelling, capillary occlusion, thrombosis, ischemia, and ulceration, and presenting clinically as hemorrhagic enteritis, colitis, or occasionally it causing full thickness damage and a perforation of the colon. 17 Perivascular inflammation or vasculitis may also develop. The role of CMV as a primary colonic pathogen is disputed and it is uncertain whether the virus can initiate infection or simply prevent the healing of ulcers. 18 Endoscopy with a biopsy is the investigation of choice. The ulcers are usually numerous, round, or serpiginous, often reaching the muscular layer, and occasionally perforating. The best approach is to confirm the presence of CMV by histological examinations and thus rule out any other pathogens using microbiological techniques. The CMV inclusion bodies are typically round, eosinophilic, intranuclear, or intracytoplasmic, and they are seen in endothelial and mucosal cells or fibroblasts surrounding the ulcer. 2 Diagnostic success is influenced by the number of biopsies and the expertise of the pathologist. Immunohistochemical techniques, such as immunoperoxidase staining and in situ DNA hybridization, increase the sensitivity of the histological diagnosis, 3 particularly when the organisms are present in low concentrations.",

Prospective studies in AIDS patients have proven CMV PCR to be a sensitive surrogate marker for active disease, but these techniques have not been studied in non-HIV cases. 3 The radiological investigations (barium enema and CT scan) are usually nonspecific. A high index of suspicion can lead to early diagnosis and treatment. Antiviral therapy (gancyclovir 10-15 ml/kg daily) for 2-3 weeks can reduce mortality, morbidity, and the need to perform surgical intervention.",
