The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) that reignite Tcell-mediated anti-tumor effects via inhibition of the PD-1 pathway or in combination with CTLA-4 have changed the clinical management of advanced NSCLC.

The latter, on the other hand, result from the alteration of immune homeostasis due to activation of T-cells and other immunologic mechanisms. These may encompass a wide range of clinical manifestations that can involve almost any organ system in the body and are summarized in Table 2 . Examples of irAE by organ system include dermatologic (e.g., dermatitis, autoimmune bullous pemphigoid), gastrointestinal (e.g., diarrhea, colitis, hepatitis), endocrinopathies (e.g., hypophysitis, thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism), respiratory (e.g., pneumonitis), neurologic (e.g., myasthenia gravis, encephalitis), and others [13] . Data regarding the incidence of irAEs originates from large published clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses [10] . These data indicate that the incidence and spectrum of irAEs experienced by patients varies between the different ICIs by target molecule, and whether these agents are used in combination or monotherapy. For example, CTLA-4 inhibitors are associated with a higher incidence of irAEs, and with different profile of irAEs compared with PD-1 inhibitors.

We adhere to recent published guidelines on management of toxicities from immunotherapy: ESM0 [19\u2022\u2022, 20] and from the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer [21, 22] . In general, irAEs should be graded in severity using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Table 1 , we illustrate the current used CTCAE grading system for the most common irAEs. It is widely recognized that the effective management of irAEs depend on early recognition and prompt intervention. Generally, patients with symptomatic irAEs are advised to temporarily withhold therapy and undergo an evaluation for non-immunologic causes. Overall, many irAEs may be reversible with appropriate therapy-with the exception of endocrinopathies which may require lifelong hormonal replacement. Specific treatment algorithms have been developed to guide the treatment of organ-specific autoimmune toxicities. The management of irAEs is dependent on the grade of toxicity and the organ system involved. Low-grade (grade 1) toxicities are generally managed with either temporary ICI withholding or continuation of ICIs with close monitoring [8\u2022, 12\u2022]. Most symptomatic irAEs (grade 2+) are managed by temporary or occasionally long-term withholding of ICIs, and short-term immunosuppression with glucocorticoids (4-6 weeks), or other appropriate immunosuppression depending on the organ involved [22\u2022, 23\u2022, 24] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 261, "end": 265, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 266, "end": 269, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 270, "end": 273, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 370, "end": 380, "text": "[19\u2022\u2022, 20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 430, "end": 434, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 435, "end": 438, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1649, "end": 1663, "text": "[22\u2022, 23\u2022, 24]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 553, "end": 560, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Incidence and spectrum of adverse events from immune checkpoint inhibitors"}, {"text": "A multidisciplinary approach including other medical subspecialties is important to ensure timely and appropriate diagnosis and management.

Similarly, there is currently no consensus in the field regarding optimal immunosuppression for patients with steroid-refractory pneumonitis, with potential management options including the anti-metabolite mycophenylate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) [22\u2022, 25-30] . However, besides TNF inhibitors for colitis, these immunosuppressive treatments have not yet been evaluated in large trials of patients who have developed irAEs receiving ICI.
