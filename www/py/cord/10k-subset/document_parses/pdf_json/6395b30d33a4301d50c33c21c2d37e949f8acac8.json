            "text": "The highly pathogenic H7N9 virus has severely affected the poultry industry and posed a serious threat to human health [1] . The most effective way to curtail pandemics is by mass vaccination [2] . Currently, there are two types of licensed vaccines against seasonal influenza in the US: subunit (split) inactivated vaccines and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) [3, 4] . Both vaccines rely on embryonated chicken eggs as substrates for production. The process of constructing a new vaccine strain based on newly circulating viruses is quite lengthy. It involves in ovo (in chicken eggs) or in vitro (in cell culture using reverse genetics techniques) reassortment between the internal genes of a donor virus such as A/PR/8/34 with the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of the new influenza strain [5] . The candidate vaccine strains must be further selected based on their high growth capability in eggs and high yield of HA content before they can be used for production of vaccines. In this case, manufacturing problems experienced in recent years illustrate that the current methods of production are fragile in ensuing an adequate and timely supply of influenza vaccine [6] . More importantly, the egg-based technology may not be suitable to respond to a pandemic crisis. Also, due to the high pathogenicity of H7N9 strains, the conventional production would require biosafety level 3 containment facilities and take several months following the identification of new potential strains. Therefore, a strategy that can rapidly produce new influenza vaccines is needed as a priority for pandemic preparedness. Lei et al. Microb Cell Fact (2020) 19:53 Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S.cerevisiae), a nonpathogenic yeast, is an ideal organism to express viral or tumor antigens, and is the most common host for cell surface display [7, 8] . Recently, influenza H5N1 HA has been expressed on the surface of S.cerevisiae by C-terminal display expression plasmid pYD1 [9] . Although detailed information is provided that the HA-presented on the surface of S.cerevisiae has immunogenicity in animal models, intramuscularly or intraperitoneally route would bring serious inflammation since the diameter of yeast is around 10 \u03bcm which could not be absorbed completely. As a new platform based on S.cerevisiae N-terminal surface display technology for H7N9 vaccine development, little is known regarding the protective immunity of S.cerevisiae-based vaccine by oral administration route.",

Further, we investigated the immunogenicity of oral administration with S.cerevisiae EBY100/pYD5-HA in mice. Our data demonstrate that oral vaccination with S.cerevisiae EBY100/pYD5-HA in the absence of mucosal adjuvant can elicit significantly humoral and cellular immune responses, as well as significant HI titers. Most importantly, S.cerevisiae EBY100/pYD5-HA would be able to provide effective immune protection against homologous H7N9 virus infection. These findings clearly support that influenza oral vaccine based on S.cerevisiae surface display technology is likely to play an important role in preventing and controlling H7N9 outbreaks and thus may provide a feasible foundation for developing safe and effective vaccines against other avian influenza viruses.",

Asterisk indicates significant difference compared to S.cerevisiae EBY100/pYD5 and PBS groups (p < 0.05) Thus, we generated HA protein of A/Anhui/1/2013 (AH-H7N9) virus was displayed on the surface of S.cerevisiae EBY100 (Fig. 1a ). Further, we tested its immunogenicity in mice by oral administration without the presence of mucosal adjuvant. Notably, HA presented on the surface of S.cerevisiae EBY100 could not only elicit strongly humoral immune response, as well as significant cellular immune response, but also confer effective protection against H7N9 virus. Therefore, this study provides the first evidence supporting an alternative strategy for developing influenza pandemic oral vaccines based on yeast surface display technology.",

Compared to intracellular expression of viral proteins, the display of viral antigen on cell surface or wall can facilitate their recognition by host immune system, thereby enhancing their capability of eliciting protective immunity in the vaccinated hosts [18] . Basically, there have N-terminal (target protein-anchor protein fusion) and C-terminal fusion (anchor protein-target protein fusion) methods for S. cerevisiae surface displays [7] . In this study, the N-terminus of the anchor protein (Aga2p) is genetically fused to the C-terminus of HA protein via Glycine-Serine linker, resulting in free N-terminal display of HA (Fig. 1a) . To elevate the HA display on yeast surface, the culture temperature was lowered from 30 \u00b0C to 20 \u00b0C after galactose-induction. Further, recombinant S.cerevisiae EBY100/pYD5-HA was confirmed for high display efficiency of HA protein (Fig. 1c, d) and quantification of HA protein on the yeast surface was determined by indirect ELISA (Fig. 1e ) which would produce sufficient antigens for subsequent oral vaccination. These findings clearly indicate HA can be presented on the surface of S.cerevisiae EBY100 with stable and high expression efficiency which has great contributions to immune efficacy by oral administration route.",

Besides being inherently nonpathogenic, this particular species of yeast can be heat-killed before administration and has been shown to be safe in humans in several clinical trials, with maximum tolerated dose not reached [19, 20] . Most importantly, recombinant S. cerevisiae has been shown to induce a strong host immune response to non-self-antigens [21] [22] [23] . In addition to the convenience of production, for purposes of vaccination, yeast has been shown to have natural adjuvant activity making the expressed proteins more immunogenic when administered along with yeast cell wall components [8] . Development of genetic systems to display foreign proteins on the surface of yeast via fusion to glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored (GPI) proteins has further simplified the purification of recombinant proteins by not requiring harsh treatments for cellular lysis or protein purification [24] . These characteristics make S. cerevisiae a potential tool for vaccine delivery.",

Thus, a novel platform based on surface display technology of S. cerevisiae can meet requirements of developing safe and effective influenza oral vaccines.

HI antibody response is an important factor for evaluating immunogenicity against corresponding viruses. Significant HI titer was obtained in the S.cerevisiae EBY100/ pYD5-HA (Fig. 2b) . Regarding the T cell responses, mice vaccinated with S.cerevisiae EBY100/pYD5-HA were found to be more effective in generating T cells secreting IFN-\u03b3 indicating Th1 responses, as compared to T cells secreting IL-4 cytokine representing Th2 type responses, which was not a protective response (Fig. 2c ). All mice that received S.cerevisiae EBY100/pYD5-HA group were completely protected from lethal challenge of H7N9 virus (Fig. 3c) , and remained healthy and showed no signs of abnormal behavior after virus infection. Collectively, these findings reinforced how significant it is use S. cerevisiae display system for developing safe and effective influenza vaccine against H7N9 virus.",

Based on the new design method for virus antigen display on the surface of yeast, NH 2 terminus of HA is free. Further, the high immunogenicity is investigated by oral administration route in mice. The obtained data strongly suggest that N-terminal yeast display platform can be considered for virus or bacteria oral vaccine development.Authors' contributions HL, BX, TG, QC and YR contributed to study design and data interpretation.
