The framing of infectious disease as a threat to global public health and economic security coincides with preemptive forms of control. A particular type of preemptive regulation is global pandemic influenza planning that entails the governing of an imminent, albeit uncertain, global health event. We examine the discourse of 'preparedness' within pandemic planning documents produced by the World Health Organization from 1999 to 2009. We present key findings on: the construction of the influenza virus in terms of its potential to transform and expand across corporeal and territorial boundaries; and the integration of pandemic preparedness into everyday practices. Our analysis illustrates how the discourse of preparedness links the justification for population-level preemptive approaches to discursive constructions of the virus. By articulating this relationship, this article contributes to understandings of the implications of 'molecular' constructions for the biopolitical regulation of the global population.",

Between 1999 and 2009, the WHO published four key planning documents that articulate a rationale for pandemic influenza preparedness and various models of pandemic phases (for example, pandemic, post-pandemic, interpandemic) (World Health Organization (WHO), 1999 (WHO), , 2005 (WHO), , 2009a . These phases are used to designate pandemic risk and structure global health activities according to 'preparedness' or 'response' measures. The design of an interpandemic and post-pandemic period means that planning activity and investment may occur before, and following, the actual pandemic event. These documents, which define when viral threats should be considered pandemic and guide the nature of appropriate responses, have changed over time. The model presented in WHO (2005) , for example, expands the interpandemic phases to include animal, in addition to human, infection; correspondingly, preparedness plans were re-oriented to focus on both human and animal-human relations.",

This article contributes to this body of critical scholarship by providing an empirical examination of how the global governance of risk for pandemic influenza is conceptualized in WHO pandemic influenza planning documents. Drawing specifically on the theoretical concepts of biopolitics, risk and security, we examine the discourse of 'preparedness' as it is expressed in these documents in order to expose the rationale that is provided for preemptive approaches to pandemic risk management, and explore how this rationale is legitimized. On the basis of a critical discourse analysis (CDA) of these documents, our analysis illustrates how the discourse of 'preparedness' links the justification for population-level preemptive approaches to particular constructions of the virus. By articulating this link, these findings contribute to understanding the implications of particular 'molecular' constructions (for example, of the virus) for the biopolitical regulation of populations across corporeal and territorial boundaries. Our analysis sheds light on pandemic preparedness as a mode of governing uncertain and unpredictable viral threats to global public health and economic security. Analysis of the objectives and effects of pandemic planning, such as that outlined in WHO preparedness planning documents, opens up a space for critical dialog regarding the broader assumptions and values underpinning such modes of governance.",

            "text": "In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases worldwide (for example, AIDS, BSE, SARS and Tuberculosis) has challenged the assumption that chronic diseases should be the primary focus of public health interventions in highly industrialized countries, given developments such as vaccination programs and improved standards of living (Farmer, 1999) . Representations of the emergence of novel infectious diseases (for example, SARS) and re-emergence of previously controlled disease (for example, tuberculosis) reflect deep-seated cultural values about geopolitical relations. Notably, pathogens are thought to originate somewhere other than the global North and exert their threat through interconnectedness within the globalized economy (Weir and Mykhalovskiy, 2010; Farmer, 1999) and through international migration, with consequences for nationalist identities and economic agendas (Craig, 2007) . In this context, research on the securitization of disease (Elbe, 2005; Fidler, 2007; Davies, 2008; Labonte, 2008; Elbe, 2010) examines understandings of infectious disease governance as co-constituted with broader configurations of national security. Focusing on SARS, Hooker and Ali (2009) frame the securitization of emerging infectious disease in terms of the 'new normal', which imagines the world as 'newly insecure', with consequences for possible ways of imagining and responding to uncertainty. The 'new normal' emerges in the context of both neoliberal policies that emphasize and prioritize individual freedom in relation to risk management, and neoconservativism that 'justifies the reimposition of authoritarian government in order to maintain security' (Hooker and Ali, 2009, p. 121) . This scholarship recognizes that biosecurity threats are particularly salient in the context of a post-9/11 environment and suggests that the alignment of (national) security issues with infectious disease governance reflects the increasingly blurred boundaries between military security practices (for example, intelligence surveillance) and global health functions (for example, infectious disease surveillance) (King, 2002; King, 2003; Elbe, 2005; Cooper, 2006; Ingram, 2008a, b) .",

Thus, the connection between emerging infectious disease and bioterrorist threats is important for the kinds of interventions it enables in the name of 'public health' (Thacker, 2006) , as evidenced by the reallocation of resources toward preemptive biodefence programs. Moreover, the legitimacy of infectious disease threats, accompanied by investment in governing these threats in the global North, can be understood as intimately connected to the security and economic agendas of nation states (Fidler, 2007) . In effect, this intersection of public health, national defense and economic priorities has made possible considerable investment in specific interventions of securitization. In the context of declining government intervention and the individualization of responsibility for health and well-being, there has been a corresponding investment of public funds into the stockpiling of vaccines by wealthy countries, which has contributed billions of dollars to the pharmaceutical industry (Monahan, 2006, p. 101) . These kinds of public health agendas have replaced social programs that target the underlying causes of health inequalities, and can be understood, further, as creating new speculative possibilities for profit by private interests (Hooker and Ali, 2009) .",

This form of governing is concerned with both existing and novel sources of threat, and is organized in relation to the potential inherent in the biological latency of disease, 'a latency that is also social, political and economic' (Thacker, 2006, p. 4) . At the same time, preemptive responses that characterize specific interventions undertaken in the name of collective health represent a widely accepted form of regulation, and, thus, require problematization in terms of their broader effects. The dominance of preemptive approaches in response to emerging threats, such as infectious disease, acknowledges, our absolute, uninsurable exposure to an uncertain future\u2026[T]he doctrine of pre-emptive warfare assumes that the only way to survive the future is to become immersed in its conditions of emergence, to the point of actualizing it ourselves. (Cooper, 2006, p. 125) This insight is key to our analysis, because it suggests that organizations that govern emerging threats, such as the WHO, are implicated in the actualization of conditions of pandemic emergence, a 'reality' that is widely understood as both imminent and a force of 'nature'. As we go on to illustrate, in WHO documents, representations of 'the biological' (and, consequently, emergence) enable and constrain specific possibilities as responses to the problem of a future pandemic.",

Discourses do not merely represent social phenomena, such as pandemic. Rather, they constitute phenomena as political, legal, health and/or social 'problems' through their reliance on particular forms of knowledge and expertise (for example, scientific, legal). Discursive framings thus legitimize particular ways of understanding such 'problems' by demarcating their constituents and limits, and place boundaries on the possibilities for what is viewed as legitimate courses of action and intervention. In this sense, discourses on pandemic (for example, that circulate through policy documents or media representations) make particular truth claims about the reality of such phenomena, and thus are implicated in the very creation of pandemic. This actualization, as described by Cooper (2006) , is brought into sharp relief by the problematization of 'pandemic', which emerged as the target of interventions (for example, preparedness) long before it had materialized as pandemic H1N1 in 2009. By featuring pandemic as a global health issue that required a response, the WHO was central to representing the conditions of reality that framed possible interventions into pandemic, well in advance of its actual emergence. This actualization was enabled by the WHO's connection to pharmaceutical companies that develop and manufacture the anti-viral drugs and vaccine that are central to the proposed response (Cohen and Carter, 2010) .",

The first axis includes practices of power that focus on the individual body as the target of disciplinary control (anatomopolitics); the second axis includes technologies of power that focus on the regulation of the population and its vital characteristics (biopolitics). In distinction from disciplinary power, which aims to control the minute details of the individual body through techniques of examination, surveillance and normalization (Foucault, 1975) , biopolitics takes the body politic as its object and target. In this sense, biopolitics focuses 'on the species body, the body imbued with the mechanics of life and serving as the basis of biological processes' the supervision of which is 'effected through an entire series of interventions and regulatory controls: a biopolitics of the population' (Foucault, 1980a, p. 139) . Such regulatory controls include intervention into biological characteristics that have discernible patterns at the collective level and are enacted with the purpose of securing an optimal state of life in populations as the object of political strategy (Foucault, 2007 (Foucault, , 2003 . Thus, the main objective of the biopolitical state is the security of the population (in terms of health, longevity and economics).",

In this regard, the biopolitical security apparatus organizes and regulates the 'natural' features of the populations in relation to the liberal conceptualization of society, in which individual freedom is problematized as the objective of government and as inextricably bound up with mechanisms of unfreedom, control and constraint required to protect the population from internal threats (Foucault, 2007 (Foucault, , 2003 . Technologies of security target the 'conditions of variation' that are thought to produce threat or risk to collective well-being, and are characterized by instruments of control and regulation, rather than the discipline and supervision directed at the individual body (Lemke, 2011, p. 37) . Instead of operating from a prescriptive norm, technologies of security operate according to an empirical range that serves to regulate variations through the logic of freedom; security only operates on the condition that there is freedom of movement, variation or circulation of people and things (Lentzos and Rose, 2009 ). As Lemke (2011) observes, technologies of security 'do not draw an absolute borderline between the permitted and the prohibited; rather, they specify an optimal middle within a spectrum of variations' (p. 47).",

Critical analyses of the governance of health and life at the molecular level, in response to recent developments in genetic testing and biotechnology, have also tended to focus on the ethics of the self (Polzer, 2005 (Polzer, , 2010 Rose, 2007) , and have privileged consideration of the individualized subject positions and ethical self-relations that are enabled and shaped by these new technologies of the self (Raman and Tutton, 2010) . However, further consideration of the role of the molecular in governing emerging infectious diseases, such as pandemic influenza, underscores new topographical complexity in understandings of global biopolitical regulation (Thacker, 2009; Braun, 2007) . Clear distinction between governance at the 'molecular' versus 'molar' levels is thus complicated by a 'hybrid of molecular and population categories \u2026 [m]olecular discourses around microbiology and immunology are also being enrolled in the construction of population-based interventions by nation-states and transnational organizations of governance' (Raman and Tutton, 2010, pp. 722-723) .",

In public health, risk governance renders binary distinctions between 'normal' and 'pathological' obsolete, expanding opportunities for intervention, temporally and spatially, as the display of abstract risk factors is sufficient to justify government (Castel, 1991; Rose, 2007) . As a form of reasoning and a means of operationalizing the regulation of populations (Weir, 2006) , risk governance operates through epidemiological techniques and systems of surveillance that identify spaces, groups, individuals, behaviors and/or social relations as likely sites for the manifestation of risk for some future condition or disease state, and thus as sites for preemptive regulation (for example, screening). The increasing problematization of emerging infectious disease as a security threat that could destabilize national and global organizations has heightened the urgency to deal with such uncertainty in the public health field.",

The construction of the 'natural' features of all influenza viruses as possessing the capacity for transformation into a pandemic strain, and as transgressing both corporeal and territorial boundaries, are powerful discursive techniques that legitimizes a specific preemptive response. Using pandemic influenza planning as our case study, we maintain that the discourse of 'preparedness', as expressed in WHO pandemic influenza planning documents, constitutes a technology of (in)security, in which specific constructions of the virus advance and justify a particular pre-emptive mode of governance where the exceptional (pandemic) event is integrated into everyday, normal conditions. To contextualize these findings, we begin with a brief overview of the study methodology, including a description of the documents, before moving onto the results of the analysis.",

CDA is concerned with exposing the ways in which texts construct objects of knowledge and produce effects that maintain particular practices of power (Foucault, 1969; Gilbert, 2008) . Discourse is productive in that it produces truth effects and specifies objects that can be governed through particular actions and strategies that are informed by historically contingent, prevailing political rationalities (Kendall and Wickham, 1999; Robertson, 2001) . In this study, documents were analyzed in order to examine how truth claims related to 'preparedness' for emerging infectious disease are asserted and naturalized, and how the rationale and activities associated with such 'preparedness' are organized. On the basis of this understanding of discourse, a central premise of this work is that pandemic planning documents construct knowledge of pandemic influenza to facilitate particular kinds of responses and obscure others, thus shaping 'what [it] is possible to know in certain situations' (Cheek, 2004 (Cheek, , p. 1143 , along with reasonable actions.",

The documents develop over the decade of planning, with key changes that include the modification of pandemic phases (which structure preparedness and response mechanisms), as well as an extension of the target audience from the health sector, to include other sectors within society in 2009. In keeping with CDA, these four documents (comprising approximately 200 pages of text) were subjected to multiple, close readings in order to discern the prevailing discursive components of 'preparedness'. Through this process of in-depth analysis, the way that the virus itself was constructed emerged as central to preparedness discourse. We begin our analysis by outlining the discursive construction of the 'natural' predisposition of the influenza virus to circulate, mix and transform. Next, we discuss representations of the virus in terms of its tendency to circulate and expand by spreading across corporeal and territorial boundaries. We then argue that these constructions enable and necessitate a particular form of preemptive response, as proposed by the WHO. Where relevant, we italicize sections of the cited WHO material to emphasize our arguments.",

This definition of a 'new' virus subtype constructs the cause for concern not in relation to the 'natural' process of viral circulationthat is, that which is considered 'normal', and desirable even, when it occurs relatively regularly and results in increased immunity in a given population. Rather, viral circulation is deemed 'risky' if the virus is novel and has not circulated within a certain time frame.

For example, in WHO (2005) , transmission between close human contacts signals a 'pandemic alert period' (p. 6). The problematization of intercorporeal boundaries as sites of increased risk for viral spread are also evidenced in the documents in recommendations for nonpharmaceutical public health interventions, such as contact tracing and voluntary quarantine. At the same time, WHO (2005, p. 42) directives generally avoid recommending measures that restrict mobility and social gatherings. Rather, the implementation of 'population-wide measures to reduce mixing of adults' are presented as possible risk reduction methods for national bodies to consider in their pandemic preparedness planning (WHO, 2005, p. 43), with such 'social distancing' mechanisms buttressing efforts to develop vaccines and vaccinate populations, which are presented as essential response mechanisms.",

Furthermore, geographically connected areas are linked in terms of common scenarios of infection, where the physical proximity of these areas indicates some level of shared risk in terms of the spread of disease. By 2009, pandemic declaration is defined entirely according to territorial spread (WHO, 2009a) .

Of particular note is the way in which risk for pandemic is defined in the 'interpandemic' period in relation to shifting notions of viral circulation and expansion, where interpandemic is used to designate phases that precede a pandemic. From 1999 to 2005, there is an integration of animal infection into the interpandemic phases; whereas the first preparedness level in the 1999 interpandemic 2 period makes no reference to animal infection, the 2005 plan incorporates animal infection in the absence of human infection into the first two interpandemic phases.",

This approach establishes various 'sectors' as necessary to achieve 'preparedness at all levels' (WHO, 2009b, p. 7) by identifying their connectedness as possible sites of economic and social vulnerability in the future event of pandemic. A central feature of this model is that the possible 'failure' of one sector must be taken into account in preparedness plans: 'Pandemic plans should take into account potential failures generated by interdependencies. These include failures of individual businesses or small numbers of businesses representing the sole providers of an essential good or service' (WHO, 2009b, p. 10) . The assumption that planning responses will be inadequate if they do not consider intersectoral boundaries through coordination is a key foundation of this approach. Identifying these points of connectedness allows for various social sectors to introduce contingency measures and flexible plans, such as 'business continuity checklists' that would remediate possible 'failures' and that, more broadly, account for the uncertainty inherent to pandemic, and the influenza virus (WHO, 2009b, p. 17) . These propositions reinforce the idea that, without adequate planning and contingency mechanisms, the interconnectedness and mutual vulnerability of each sector may lead to 'social and economic disruption' (WHO, 2009b, p. 5 ).",

This in-depth empirical work contributes to contemporary understandings of biopolitical regulation by exposing the organizing logic underpinning preparedness, and by considering the possible implications of this imagining for intervention into a future global pandemic. The construction of the natural features of the influenza virus in terms of its potential to transform into the next pandemic virus and spread across multiple boundaries, necessitates the integration of preparedness activities (characterized by flexibility and contingency) into everyday practice.

As Zedner (2009) points out, technologies of security frequently result in greater insecurity for many individuals or social groups (for example, checking of ID cards of immigrants and refugees). Similarly, we have demonstrated the mutually constitutive way in which pandemic preparedness, as a technology of (in)security, discursively constructs new vulnerabilities, increasing both the demand for security solutions and insecurity of those deemed unable to protect themselves against emerging threats (for example, through the purchase of pharmaceuticals or the stockpiling of non-pharmaceutical resources).",

The 'natural' potentiality of the virus implicates all viral strains in a future pandemic and constructs multiple possibilities for the source and origin of emergence of the next pandemic virus. The discursive linking of pandemic and non-pandemic viral activity poses a problem for risk governance; the uncertainty that is constituted by these blurred distinctions creates a need for the continuous differentiation between these possibilities. In this way, pandemic planning constitutes society as 'insecure' because of the ongoing possibility that 'normal' viruses will transform and spread across bodies and territories, a threat that preparedness simultaneously aims to preempt in the objective of global security. Thus, these viral constructions also serve as a key technique in enabling the forms and logic of preemption that characterize preparedness, and necessitate the continuity that drives ongoing global pandemic influenza governanceif every influenza virus has the potential to transform and become the pandemic virus, then preemptive intervention is required to respond to this risk.",

Risk is rendered governable through the ongoing engagement with the possibility of the exceptional pandemic, rather than through the calculation of probabilities. This integration is most apparent in the 2005 restructuring of pandemic phases to include the 'normal' state of, animal, infection (not necessarily accompanied by human infection). The logic of preparedness, while still oriented toward a future event, is no longer focused on the prevention of specific or isolated disease outbreaks or events by precluding certain risks that may lead to these undesirable outcomes (for example, pandemic), but is rather focused on securing uncertainty through the regulation and control of emergent risk via ongoing engagement and adaptation (Dillon, 2007; Lakoff, 2007) .",

While such interventions are positioned as justifiable in order to manage viral circulation and potential disease outbreaks, they may have significant economic consequences for those involved in the farming and trade of livestock. Moreover, intensive surveillance may also result in the stigmatization of human bodies closely connected to infected animals. Finally, the positioning of particular nations and pan-national regions (for example, nations that are linked through proximity, shared borders or trade partnerships) as inadequate in the tracking and containment of the natural mutability of the virus justifies certain exclusionary practices. For instance, this construction legitimizes the closing of borders to protect against products and beings from these 'uncontained' regions, enacted as a last resort.

Instead, uncertainty is taken as the given in terms of the emergence of pandemic viral strains, and rather than prevent emergence, security mechanisms attempt to regulate this uncertain, yet imminent, event. This securitization is to be achieved through a recourse to freedom (Lentzos and Rose, 2009) , which allows for the circulation of viral strains (among other entities) and responds primarily through the adaptation of existing infrastructure and networks (for example, vaccine production networks) in order to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic. In line with Cooper's (2006) observation, discourse concerning the potential threat posed by the virus entrenches wealthy nations in the very process of emergence to the point of actualizing it through the production of a global stockpile of anti-virals and other materials, with significant consequences for economic profit from an unrealized event. 3 Central to Foucauldian interpretations of security apparatuses is their position as 'counterparts to liberal freedom and [as] the condition for its existence. Security mechanisms are meant to secure and protect the permanently endangered naturalness of the population, as well as its own forms of free and spontaneous self-regulation' (Lemke, 2011, p. 47) . Technologies of security are aimed at protecting the whole from the internal threats that exist within the social body, which is always at risk. Our analysis illuminates how molecular constructions operate in service of global security and freedom, in addition to the disciplinary mechanisms discussed earlier in this article. The ubiquitous risk of a pandemic virus that could disrupt the 'naturalness' of circulation of living and non-living things (for example, humans, goods, information) necessitates an ongoing response to all possibilities of viral activity in order to mitigate or minimize disruptions within networks of circulation (for example, by targeting/accounting for advisories around social gatherings, work/school attendance and travel). This is substantiated by predictions that illness because of a global pandemic could result in GDP losses between 0.5 (\u00a38.4 billion) and 4.3 per cent (\u00a372.3 billion) in the UK alone (Smith et al, 2009 ). These estimates would increase when accounting for changes in routine such as widespread school closures or prophylactic absenteeism (Smith et al, 2009; Smith et al, 2011) . Thus, the threat to the imagined 'whole-of-society' is in the undesirable disruption to the circuitous arrangement of global capitalism and the interruption of economic and social functioning. The possible closure of borders, restriction of movement through quarantine and other measures, or the cancellation of social events, in response to a transgressive virus threaten the neoliberal conception of individual rights and freedoms that is so highly valued in the West.",

            "text": "Our analysis offers a detailed examination of the imagining of pandemic preparedness within WHO global policy documents. The naturalization of specific understandings of pandemic, such as those related to viral potentiality, imparts particular worldviews at the expense of others. Our approach challenges these taken-for-granted versions of reality, and encourages further inquiry that more closely examines the implications of these constructions for global health inequalities. The constitution of nation states and other social configurations (that is, the whole-of-society) as 'mutually' vulnerable because of interconnectedness operates as a powerful legitimizing device for the requirement of global 'preparedness'. Further investigation might examine how the naturalization of nation (and other) states as similarly vulnerable to the transgressive virus, invokes certain kinds of duties or responsibilities, and lends itself to specific forms of global health intervention over others. mutate, becoming increasingly adapted to humans and consequently more efficiently transmitted, despite the lack of human-to-human transmission at the time. In 2003 and 2004, a widespread re-emergence of H5N1 appeared in avian populations, and the virus spread from Asia to other continents. Until April 2009, this virus, which is presently endemic in domestic and wild fowl populations in parts of Asia, was considered the likely source of a future pandemic. 2 'Interpandemic' and 'pandemic alert' are used to designate risk phases preceding a pandemic (whereas 'post-pandemic' describes the phases following a pandemic). The use of terms to describe pandemic and non-pandemic periods varies throughout the documents. Of significance to this analysis is that in WHO (1999) there are three phases that come before the pandemic designation, whereas in WHO (2005 WHO ( , 2009a there are five phases that precede the pandemic phase. 3 In 2009, Tamiflu sales hit a high of US$3 billion because of stockpiling by countries to protect against pandemic (Pierson and Humer, 2013) . By the 2009 pandemic, the United States had stockpiled 50 million anti-viral treatment courses (Dimitrov et al, 2009; Patel and Gorman, 2009 ). As of April 2014, the United Kingdom had spent an estimated $710 million, and the United States approximately $1.5 billion, on influenza anti-viral stockpile, despite controversy about the efficacy of pharmaceuticals in responding to these emerging threats (Van Noorden, 2014) .",
