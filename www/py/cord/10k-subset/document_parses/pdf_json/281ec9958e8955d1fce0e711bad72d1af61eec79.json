Implications for health care providers including oral and maxillo-facial surgeons have been published by the WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (USA), and other medical societies and public health organizations. While the risk of infection with the Ebola virus seems to be rather small in Europe, maxillo-facial and plastic surgeons often travel to Africa to treat patients with facial burns, cleft-lip and palate, and noma. The likelihood of an encounter with patients infected by Ebola virus in subsaharan and West Africa, therefore, has increased during the last 2 years. The purpose of this short overview was to summarize the virology of the Ebola virus, transmission, epidemiology, clinical features, oral manifestations, treatment, and possible implications for maxillo-facial surgeons of EDV.",

            "text": "During the last two decades, a number acute outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, e.g., SARS, MERS, human monkeypox, and recently Ebola virus disease (EVD) [1] , have caused many fatalities and much global concern. While the spread of these infections in humans is promoted by global traffic, trading, war, poverty, and a number of soft social factors, they originate basically in a relatively rare transmission of an agent from an infected animal to a human individual. In a susceptible person, the agent can be reproduced to high concentrations of infectious progeny thus fostering a ready human-to-human transfer of a hitherto new infection. The risk of transmission of EDV to health care workers therefore has become a key issue in the last 2 years. Recently, the WHO has published findings of an assessment of risk by the Ebola epidemic to the Pacific island [2] , indicating that the possibilty of a spread of EDV to this region may not be excluded. Generally, health care workers (medical and nursing staff, laboratory scientists, health care staff, and volunteer carers of EVD patients in West Africa), have an elevated risk of exposure to Ebola virus [3] . While the role of EDV transmission in the field of dentistry and oral and maxillo-facial surgery seems to be neglectable at first sight, Samaranayake et al. [4] and Galvin et al. [5] have evaluated possible scenarios which would pose a risk to oro-dental health care personnel. The present overview will summarize the updated status of EVD in relation to virology of filoviruses, transmission, clinical symptoms, oral manifestations, treatment, and possible risks for oral and maxillo-facial surgeons traveling to Africa for surgical treatment of facial burns, cleft-lip and palate, or noma.",

The viral RNA is prone to a high mutation rate-consequently, further differences in pathogenicity may occur. The genomes of Marburg and Ebola viruses differ from one another by more than 50 % at the nucleotide level and by different reading frame use. Progeny virus is assembled on the plasma membrane in a budding process (Fig. 1 ). The lipids of the viral envelope are derived from the host-cell membrane.

Once the pathogen has entered a human host, further human to-human transmission is mediated by socio-cultural contacts and conditions, e.g., funeral rites. In hospitals, both fellow patients and the medical and nursing staff taking care of infected patients are at high risk to acquire a filovirus infection. Close contacts with virus-shedding patients, their blood, breast milk, sweat, feces, urine, and vomitus or with corpses of deceased persons can cause further cases of EVD.

Until today, a total of 24 Ebola virus outbreaks were recorded. The latest epidemic started in December 2013 in Guinea as a zoonotic transmission from a bat to a 2-year old boy [11] . From this index case, the virus spread rapidly into Liberia and Sierra Leone, i.e., countries unprepared to cope with filovirus infections and with poorly developed health care systems. The situation soon went out of control. However, for several months, only Medicins sans Frontiers and volunteers from other groups were Bin the field.^Only by August 8, 2014 , when thousands of new infections were reported with doubling rates of three weeks only, WHO and many collections started efforts to control the spread of the infection. Fortunately, control measures-early laboratory diagnostics, case finding capacities, and strict isolation of suspects-became effective so that presently only less than 10 infections were reported per week from Guinea and Sierra Leone. Due to the relatively late reaction, the 2013 outbreak grew to the hitherto largest with 28,637 reported confirmed and suspected cases resulting in 11,315 deaths until December 6, 2015 [13] . Outside of West Africa, 7 patients with Ebola virus infection were treated in Italy.",

However, whenever health care providers including oral and maxillofacial surgeons give treatment to patients in West or subsaharan Africa an encounter with Ebola has become a reality. Particularly, asymptomatic patients with Ebola virus disease or those with early stage nonspecific symptoms may present for dental or surgical treatment. For individuals who may have had contact with Ebola virus, infected patients postponement of non-essential treatment is required for 21 days after possible exposure. This is presently the period of quarantine recommended [15] .",
