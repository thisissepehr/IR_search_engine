Data on PMT constructs, perceived trustworthiness of A/H7N9 information from mass media (formal sources), friends and family (informal sources), intention to adopt and actual adoption of PPBs and respondents' demographics were collected. Structural equation modeling (SEM) identified associations between demographic factors and PMT constructs associated with A/H7N9-oriented PPB intention. Moderated mediation analysis examined how demographics moderated the effects of information trust on PPB intention via risk perceptions of A/H7N9. Results: Respondents generally perceived low vulnerability to A/H7N9 infection. The SEM found that male respondents perceived lower severity of (\u03b2 = \u22120.23), and lower vulnerability to (\u03b2 = -0.15) A/H7N9 infection; age was positively associated with both perceived personal vulnerability to (\u03b2 = 0.21) and perceived self-efficacy (\u03b2 = 0.24) in controlling A/H7N9; education was positively associated with perceived response efficacy (\u03b2 = 0.40). Furthermore, perceived vulnerability (\u03b2 = 0.16), perceived self-efficacy (\u03b2 = 0.21) and response efficacy (\u03b2 = 0.67) were positively associated with intention to adopt PPBs against A/H7N9. More trust in informal information (TII) was only significantly associated with greater PPB intention through its positive association with perceived response efficacy. Age significantly moderated the associations of TII with perceived Self-efficacy and perceived response efficacy, with younger farmers who had greater TII perceiving lower self-efficacy but higher response efficacy. Conclusion: Poultry farmers perceive A/H7N9 as a personally-irrelevant risk. Interventions designed to enhance perceived response efficacy, particularly among lower educated respondents may effectively motivate adoption of PPBs.

Fortunately, the virus transmits inefficiently between humans [3, 4] . Genomic analysis suggests that A/H7N9 virus is of avian origin and mainly transmitted through exposure to infected poultry [1] . The median age of confirmed A/H7N9 human cases was 61 years [3] , indicating that older people are a high risk group for A/ H7N9 infection. Over 60% of confirmed A/H7N9 human cases reported a history of exposure to live poultry [2] . This raises concerns that those in frequent contact with poultry such as poultry traders and poultry farmers are at high risk of A/H7N9 infection. Although only 6% of confirmed A/H7N9 human cases were poultry workers [3] , one previous study reported that over 50% of the surveyed poultry workers had seroconversion for A/ H7N9 virus from May 2013 to December 2013 in Southern China though none had virologically confirmed A/ H7N9 infection [5] . This indicates that people with occupational exposure to poultry could have a high risk of mild or asymptomatic A/H7N9 infection. More recently, one study indicates that poultry farms could be important sources of reassortment between A/H7N9 virus and other strains of avian influenza viruses [6] .

For example, previous studies identified that an erroneous belief that cooking was the best way of protection from avian influenza could reassure continuing buying of live poultry from wet markets the public [10] and that live poultry traders generally failed to recognize the risks from contact with bird secretions or droppings [11] . All these knowledge deficits could be addressed by public health education to improve protective behaviours. How people perceive the risk of a novel influenza appears to partially influence their protective behaviours [12] [13] [14] . However, although the relationships between risk perception and self-protective behaviours have been widely examined in many descriptive studies following novel influenza outbreaks, many are atheoretical [14] and this limits the confidence we have in the veracity of the findings. A theoretical basis is important because it generates testable predictions that build confidence in the validity of the underlying processes. Studies suggest that protective behaviours in response to newly emerging infectious disease outbreaks differ by respondents' socio-demographic characteristics, particularly age, gender and educational attainment [14] possibly because these variables influence perception of risk [15, 16] . However, few studies have tested these hypotheses within any theoretical frameworks. Studies of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 found that older respondents perceived greater severity of, but lower personal susceptibility to the disease while males generally perceived lower severity of and personal susceptibility to the disease [15, 17] . Few studies reported the relationships between educational attainment and risk perception of influenza. However, higher educational level has been consistently associated with lower perceived risk from other health threats [18, 19] , possibly because higher educated people are more likely to be unrealistically optimistic when evaluating their personal risk [19] which might imply greater personal agency or selfefficacy [20] . In relation to experience, farmers with more experience in raising poultry report more familiarity with poultry diseases and thereby perceived lower risk from avian influenza and higher confidence in preventing the disease [13, 21] . Consequently, the first objective of this study was to examine how A/H7N9related risk perceptions and demographics including age, gender, educational attainment and working experience (indicating by years of raising poultry) influenced intention to adopt personal protective behaviours (PPBs) against A/H7N9. We hypothesized that demographics influence intention to adopt PPBs against A/ H7N9 through their effects on A/H7N9-related risk perceptions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 333, "end": 337, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 455, "end": 459, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 680, "end": 684, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 685, "end": 689, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 690, "end": 694, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 901, "end": 905, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1332, "end": 1336, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1399, "end": 1403, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1404, "end": 1407, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1734, "end": 1738, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1739, "end": 1742, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1968, "end": 1972, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1973, "end": 1976, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2104, "end": 2108, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2167, "end": 2171, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2397, "end": 2401, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2402, "end": 2405, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Sources of information are important when considering threat-related information veracity. We distinguish between different information sources as follows: Learning from the experience of the 2003 SARS outbreak in China, the Chinese government actively disseminated information about A/H7N9 through traditional mass media (e.g., TV, radio and newspaper) since it emerged in China in March 2013 [22] [23] [24] . Traditional mass media in Mainland China are mainly regarded as government-agency sources for information of infectious diseases and thereby such information is assumed to constitute \"formal information\" in this study. Information of A/H7N9 disseminated through media is likely to provoke widespread public discussion about the topic. In contrast, information communicated through casual interpersonal communication between friends and family constitutes \"informal information\" for the purposes of this study. Trust is a core element for effective risk communication, particularly for uncertain infection risks where the risk-related threat is usually invisible [25] . Causal models of trust propose that information trust influences behavioural change indirectly through alterations in risk perceptions [26] [27] [28] . The literature on trust suggests two main types of trust can be identified; trust based on judgments of the intentions of others (relational trust) and the trust based on judgments of competence (calculative trust) [29] . While trust in informal information (TII) approximates to relational trust, trust in government (formal) information approximates to calculative trust [29] . Therefore, we propose that trust in formal and informal information may function differentially to motivate behavioural change through their effects on risk perceptions [29] . Previous studies conducted among the general public during the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic suggests that while trust in formal information was significantly associated with perceived confidence in preventing the disease (efficacy appraisal), TII was significantly associated with perceived risk of the disease (threat appraisal) [30] . Furthermore, the degree of trust in health information from various sources differed by demographics including age, gender and educational attainment [31] . Therefore, it seems plausible that demographics including age, gender and education attainment exert their effects by modifying the effects of information trust on risk perceptions. Therefore, the second objective of the current study was to examine whether demographics including age, gender and educational attainment could modify the indirect effects of information trust on intention to take protective behaviours through risk perceptions related to A/H7N9.

Many studies have suggested that PMT provides a useful theoretical framework for understanding people's response to threatrelated information during outbreaks of newly-emerging respiratory infectious diseases [14, 33] . PMT focuses on individuals' cognitive processes in response to fear appeal messages. It proposes that four core cognitive processes mediate the effects of fear appeal messages on motivation to adopt protective behaviours [32] . These four core cognitive processes are perceived Vulnerability (i.e. subjective estimates of the chance of contracting a disease), perceived Severity (i.e., subjective estimates of the seriousness of a disease), perceived Self-efficacy (i.e., the belief that one can successfully take the preventive behaviours) and perceived Response Efficacy (i.e., the belief that existing preventive behaviours are effective in reducing risk of the disease) [34] . PMT also predicts that individual characteristics influence motivation for behavioural change through their effects on these four cognitive components [32] . In this study, we hypothesized that poultry farmers' demographics, including gender, age, educational attainment and years of raising poultry influence the PMT constructs of perceived Vulnerability (to A/H7N9), perceived Severity (of A/H7N9), perceived Self-efficacy and perceived Response Efficacy in controlling H7N9, which in turn influence poultry farmers' intention to adopt PPBs against A/H7N9.

Compared with Model I, Model II had comparable model fit indices, and the Satorra-Benter scaled chisquare difference test suggests that it fits to the data as well as Model I (Table 2 ). However, investigation of the residual matrix identified significant residual covariance between perceived Vulnerability and perceived Selfefficacy, between perceived Vulnerability and perceived Response Efficacy, between perceived Self-efficacy and perceived Severity, and between perceived Self-efficacy and perceived Response Efficacy. It indicates that the residual covariance of these latent variables is correlated. Therefore, the covariance between these variables was added to the model. The re-specified model (Model III) fits the data significantly better than Model II (Table 2) . Investigation of the residual matrix revealed no significant residual covariance between the variables of Model III. Therefore, Model III was determined to be the optimal model. Compared with Model II, the parameters estimated for the structural part of Model III only differ slightly. The correlations between the four demographics age, gender, educational attainment and years of raising poultry were not higher than 0.33 (spearman correlation between age and gender), suggesting that multicollinearity is not a significant problem of the model [47] . The standardized covariance, path coefficients and the explained variance of each endogenous variable for Model III are shown in Fig. 4 .

The universally high level of trust in formal information complicates testing for the moderated mediation models due to almost zero data variability. Therefore, the analysis only focused on the moderated effects of demographics on the relationships of TII with behavioural Intention via risk perceptions of A/H7N9.

This is consistent with one previous study conducted in The Netherlands which found that over 90% of the respondents perceived that avian influenza was a serious disease (mean score = 4.57, scale 1-5) but only 0.7% of them perceived themselves to be highly vulnerable to avian influenza (mean score = 1.69, scale 1-5) [48] . Chinese poultry farmers report more familiarity with poultry disease risk than do urbanites and are more optimistic about avoiding avian influenzas [12, 13] .

Given the small-to-moderate effect size of perceived Severity on behavioral intention, our small sample size may not be able to detect a significant association. However, while a previous review indicated that Self-efficacy had the strongest effect on behavioral intention [32] , our study found that perceived Response Efficacy had the strongest effect on PPB intention, accounting for nearly 50% of the explained variance in PPB intention. For these poultry farmers, perceived Self-efficacy to adopt the preventive measures was generally high possibly because the recommended preventive measures are simple and thereby easily adopted. In this case, whether the preventive measures are believed to be effective or not to reduce risk of A/H7N9 plays a dominant role in determining their motivation to adopt the measures.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 335, "end": 339, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 615, "end": 619, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The finding that respondents with higher educational achievement had better compliance to PPBs is consistent with a previous study reporting better educated poultry traders were more likely to adopt PPBs when working [49] . Our study adds to the literature about the potential mechanism of how education influence adoption of PPBs. As indicated by the SEM, better educated respondents perceived higher response efficacy to prevent A/H7N9 which in turn was associated with higher intention to adopt protective behaviours against A/H7N9. Compared with other demographics, education had stronger indirect effects on intention to adopt protective behaviours via Perceived Response Efficacy. This suggests that interventions to promote belief in the efficacy of available protective behaviours among the less educated farmers may play a crucial role to improve compliance to self-protection against A/H7N9. Consistent with our hypotheses, our study also found that females perceived higher personal Vulnerability to A/H7N9 and higher Severity of A/H7N9 compared with males. This finding may elucidate why compliance to recommended protection was usually higher among females during epidemics found in many descriptive studies [14] . However, the associations between age and PMT constructs were not consistent with our hypotheses. According to the SEM, older respondents perceived higher Vulnerability to A/H7N9 and higher Self-efficacy to prevent against A/H7N9 which in turn was significantly associated with higher intention to adopt PPBs. However, our study did not find a significant association between age and compliance to the recommended protective measures. This suggests factors other than these four PMT constructs may hinder translating the intention of adopting PPBs into actual behaviours among the older respondents. For example, perceived costs from taking the recommended behaviours (e.g., effort, time) may be greater among older people (e.g. older people need to take greater effort to alter their long-term habit) [32] . Our initial hypotheses that years of working with poultry could be associated with lower perceived Vulnerability and perceived Severity but higher perceived Selfefficacy and Response Efficacy were not supported. Years of working with poultry were only marginally associated with perceived Response Efficacy but the effect size was small. One possible reason could be that our measure of years of working with poultry may not be a good indicator for farmer's experience with raising poultry. While a previous study did not find significant association between years of working with poultry and adoption of protective behaviours [11] , our study found that respondents who had raised poultry for 10-20 years were less likely to adopt all the recommended protective measures than those who had raised poultry for less than 10 years after adjusting for age and educational attainment.

This is not consistent with one previous study that TII was independent of efficacy belief but was positively associated with disease worry [30] . A possible reason for the inconsistent results could be that the former study was conducted among general public [30] while the current study was conducted among poultry farmers. Different types of informal information are probably communicated among different populations. Farmers may simply know what kinds of protective behaviours are available for preventing A/H7N9 through listening to their peer farmers and observing what they do. Age significantly moderated the mediation relationships of TII with behavioural Intention through perceived Self-efficacy and Response Efficacy. For younger farmers, more trust in information from peers was associated with perceived lower Self-efficacy but higher Response Efficacy, while corresponding associations were not statistically significant for older farmers. Such findings provide some insights about the possible types of information shared among younger poultry farmers. Younger poultry farmers who are usually better educated may be more aware of the effectiveness of available preventive measures in reducing risk of A/H7N9 but they may lack of confidence in adopting these preventive measures due to lack of skills in routine husbandry practices with protective measures. For example, they may find it more inconvenient to wear gloves or protective clothes in their routine husbandry practice.

Third, actual PPBs were dichotomously (yes/no) measured and because of social desirability bias, may provide less accurate assessment of actual compliance. Furthermore, while multilevel SEM (MSEM) may be more appropriate for our data that were collected based on sampling stratified by clusters, MSEM cannot be conducted due to lack of data on clusters.

The moderate perceived Response Efficacy of respondents and its strongest association with PPB intention reflect that interventions designed to enhance perceived Response Efficacy may effectively motivate adoption of PPBs among these poultry farmers. Education appears to influence intention to adopt PPBs through its positive association with Response Efficacy, suggesting that Response Efficacy should be promoted among lower educated farmers. For example, information about how and why a recommended behavior can eliminate or decrease risk of infection should be clearly presented and framed in an easily-understood way for lower educated framers. The study also adds to the literature that gender appears to influence on intention to adopt PPBs through its effects on perceived disease Vulnerability and Severity, while age may influence on behavioural intention through its effects on perceived disease Vulnerability and perceived Self-efficacy in prevention. Greater TII was associated with higher Intention to take protective measures through its positive association with perceived Response Efficacy. Age significantly moderated the association between TII and perceived Self-efficacy, and between TII and perceived Response Efficacy, with younger farmers who had greater TII perceived lower Self-efficacy but higher Response Efficacy. Young poultry farmers may just simply obtain the information about the availability of effective preventive measures against A/ H7N9 from listening to what their peer farmers say and observing what they do.
