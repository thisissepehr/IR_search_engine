However, no study has assessed the prognostic factors associated with 1-year mortality among PMV patients, not less than 21 days after surgery. This study analyzed the predictors of 1-year mortality in patients requiring PMV in intensive care units (ICUs) after surgery. Methods: In this multicenter, respective cohort study, 124 patients who required PMV after surgery in the ICUs of five tertiary hospitals in Beijing between January 2007 and June 2016 were enrolled. The primary outcome was the duration of survival within 1 year. Predictors of 1-year mortality were identified with a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model. The predictive effect of the ProVent score was also validated. Results: Of the 124 patients enrolled, the cumulative 1-year mortality was 74.2% (92/124). From the multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis, cancer diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] 2.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37-3.35; P < 0.01), no tracheostomy (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.22-3.30; P < 0.01), enteral nutrition intolerance (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.19-2.97; P = 0.01), blood platelet count \u2264150 \u00d7 10 9 /L (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.14-2.75; P = 0.01), requirement of vasopressors (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.13-2.80; P = 0.02), and renal replacement therapy (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01-2.91; P = 0.047) on the 21st day of mechanical ventilation (MV) were associated with shortened 1-year survival. Conclusions: For patients who required PMV after surgery, cancer diagnosis, no tracheostomy, enteral nutrition intolerance, blood platelet count \u2264150 \u00d7 10 9 /L, vasopressor requirement, and renal replacement therapy on the 21st day of MV were associated with shortened 1-year survival.
