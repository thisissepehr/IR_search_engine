However, there is a paucity of evidence supporting the optimal transfusion strategy in these patients. The primary objective was to establish if there is an improvement in survival at 30-days with the use of WB transfusion compared with components therapy (CT) in adult trauma patients with acute major haemorrhage. Methodology A systematic literature search was performed (PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, OVID, Embase and the Transfusion Evidence Library) to identify studies comparing WB transfusion with CT in adult trauma patients with acute major haemorrhage. Studies which did not report mortality were excluded. Methodological quality of included studies was interpreted using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and rated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.",

            "text": "We conducted a systematic literature review of prophylactic antibiotics in penetrating thoracic trauma requiring thoracostomy both prehospitally and in the ED. Six meta-analysis and eleven randomised trials were identified of patients undergoing thoracostomy in the ED. Only one meta-analysis looked purely at penetrating trauma, and this was a subgroup analysis [1] . It included all relevant randomised trials identified in the literature search and showed a positive effect for antibiotics with an OR 0.28 (95% CI 0.14 -0.57) and NNT of 4.8. Two cohort studies were identified of patients undergoing thoracostomy prehospitally [2, 3] . Both compared infection rate in a prehospital and ED group, neither showing a difference between cohorts. Both included a mix of penetrating and blunt trauma, neither gave data on antibiotic use and there were significant differences between the cohorts. Discussion Despite significant differences between penetrating and blunt trauma, the majority of trials combine both groups. The only meta-analysis of purely penetrating trauma showed a positive signal. Weaknesses include variation in antibiotic regimes and the definition of infections. Despite this, we believe there is level 2 evidence (Oxford CEBM) for the use of prophylactic antibiotics. Administering antibiotics prehospitally requires time and personnel, it risks delaying other time-critical interventions and transfer to definitive care. In the ED, there is proven benefit to the administration of antibiotics at thoracostomy. When time permits, we would Background Non-compressible torso haemorrhage is a leading cause of mortality following trauma. These patients often exsanguinate to death prior to meaningful attempts at definitive haemostasis. Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) is an emerging technique, which aims to limit ongoing haemorrhage and has been shown to be feasible in the prehospital phase. REBOA utilises the common femoral artery (CFA) to gain access to the aorta. The ease of access to the aorta can have a direct impact on the success of such interventions. The aim of this study is to determine if iliac tortuosity or lumen diameter influences the time taken to perform REBOA in human cadaveric model.",

REBOA was performed and timed from first needle puncture to inflation of balloon in the cadavers. The tortuosity index and lumen diameter of the iliac arteries was measured. Linear regression was applied to assess the relationship between aortic occlusion and vascular morphology. The length of the CFA and qualitative data around vascular access was also recorded. Results A strong positive correlation between tortuosity and time to occlusion (R 2 = 0.39, p=0.002) was measured. The correlation between lumen diameter and time to occlusion was not statistically significant (R 2 =0.01, p=0.72). It was found that in cadavers with more tortuous arteries more resistance to inserting guide wires was felt. Furthermore only cadavers with a tortuosity index \u22651.35 experienced vascular damage by the REBOA procedure. There was wide variation of lengths of CFA (16 -73mm) amongst the cadavers. Conclusion This is the first U.K. based human cadaveric REBOA study. The data suggests that having tortuous vasculature not only delays the time to complete aortic occlusion but also increases the risk of complications following REBOA. ",

            "text": "An open abdomen is an infrequent but essential part of a surgeon's armamentarium when closure is not possible due to sepsis, oedema and domain loss. Failure to close early will result in slow healing laparostomy wound with morbidity and mortality. We describe our practice of closure in 30 consecutive patients. Newer techniques should be assessed against this baseline. Within a dedicated emergency surgery setting, experience accumulates over time. We sought to analyse the outcomes in these complex patients. Methods: In this study we describe our outcomes from a single unit, providing seventy percent of Emergency Surgery service for the hospital. We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database over an eight year period. Electronic Patient Records were interrogated for type of closure, time to closure, length of hospital stay, morbidity and mortality in patients requiring laparostomy for a variety of reasons. Results: 35 patients were identified, 4 patients were excluded due to incomplete data. Median age was 55 (16-89 years old), 55% of patients were male, 78% of patients were ASA 3 and above. 37% remained in ITU for more than 30 days, and the median length of stay was 49 days (12-120 days). 55% (n=15) of patients had primary fascial closure without mesh. 12 patients were closed with biological inlay mesh, 75% of mesh closures were bridged. In 4 patients, closure was not possible. Whilst 78% of patients experienced a post-operative complication (26% wound infection), no patient required re-laparotomy necessitating disruption of final closure. There were no inpatient deaths, and 30-day mortality was 0%. Conclusion: Laparostomy is a challenging condition to manage, with high morbidity. Low mortality and satisfactory outcomes can be achieved with early closure using abdominal vacuum, component separation and, biological mesh bridge, if fascial approximation is not possible, in these frequently septic and very sick patients.",

Background Pulseless electrical activity is a type of non-shockable cardiac arrest [1] . Paramedics treat cardiac arrests using advanced life support resuscitation [2] .

In the year ending March 2017 there were 6,375 firearm offences recorded in England & Wales [2] . The objective of this service evaluation was to review the impact of gunshot wounds (GSW) on our major trauma centre over a three-year period and to review the resources that were required and to assess the impact on our training programs. Methods Following institutional approval (CAMS 7113) we undertook a retrospective service evaluation of patients who triggered a trauma call as a result of a GSW during the period 1 August 2016 to 31 July 2019. Cases were identified using our in-house trauma database and a case notes review was undertaken. Demographic data and any services utilised were recorded. Results There were 4483 trauma calls over the study period of which only 84 (1.8%) were attributed to GSW (1 record was incomplete and discarded). The mean age was 30.1 years (SD 11.0), 80/83 (96.4%) were Male and 66/83 (79.5%) presented outside normal working hours (0800-1800). A Code Red Trauma Call was activated for 28/83 (33.7%), CT Scan was performed for 57/83 (68.7%), 12/83 (14.5%) required surgery within 4 hours of admission (7 trauma laparotomies), 10 patients were admitted to critical care, 5 died and 27 patients were admitted for > 7 days. Conclusions There were relatively few gunshot wounds but when they presented a third required a 'code red trauma' activation and arrived predominately out of normal working hours. These patients are resource intensive and there are training implications as they present infrequently. High-fidelity simulation could be considered as part of a training package to supplement the lack of exposure to these cases. ",

Given that the median PaCO 2 was 5.3kPa for a corresponding median ETCO 2 of 3.8kPa, true arterial PaCO 2 may be significantly over the recommended upper limit for patients with suspected TBI.

All prehospital data was checked against the TUBT for missed primary MTC transfer opportunities. Results 48 secondary transfers were identified. 23 (48%) of these did not meet the bypass tool criteria and 13 (27%) patients met the bypass tool criteria but were missed primary transfers. Recorded secondary transfer injuries included: reduced Glasgow Coma Score (n=7), systolic blood pressure <90mmHg (n=5), depressed or open skull fracture (n=2), suspected pelvic fracture (n=2), and crushing, degloving or mangled limb injury (n=1). 6 (13%) patients self-presented to the TU and 6 patient files had incomplete data. 47 (98%) met the bypass criteria within HEMS operational hours and there was no obvious geographical location bias. Conclusion 27% of patients from the IOW had a missed primary transfer opportunity, having met defined criteria set out in the bypass tool. The creation of opportunities to promote wider dissemination of the tool amongst ambulance teams is needed to increase numbers of safer patient transfers off the island. Background: Traumatic injuries constitute one of our major public health challenges. The most effective means to reduce the impact trauma has on individuals and society is primary injury prevention. Alcohol and drug use are major risk factors for traumatic events. Primary prevention relies on detailed knowledge of risk factors. The aim of this study is to facilitate targeted injury prevention through improved data collection and analysis on impairing substances as risk factors for traumatic injuries.",

We hypothesised that the thrombin generating capacity of isolated MVs after injury was increased and correlated with degree of anatomical injury (New Injury Severity Score, NISS) and physiological derangement (admission base excess, BE). Method MV-associated thrombin generation was assessed in admission blood samples in a prospective cohort of 33 trauma patient, and in 20 healthy controls. We used a modified thrombin generation assay where MVs are isolated and analysed in pooled normal plasma [3] . This method measures the activity of only MVs, without contributing effect from the patients' plasma. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for group comparison, and Spearman correlation was used to evaluate the correlation between NISS and BE and MV associated thrombin generation.",

There were 69/590 (11.7%) patients who required surgical intervention within 4 hours of admission (including 31 trauma laparotomies, 3 thoracotomies and 2 combined Laparotomy and Thoracotomy). We determined that an anaesthetic registrar will cover 40 on calls during a 6-month rotation and so per shift there is a 3% chance that they will manage a patient with stab wounds requiring urgent surgical intervention. Discussion Despite the increasing incidence of knife crime, it remains a small part of our trauma workload. The exposure of anaesthetic trainees to knife wounds requiring surgery through on call duties alone is limited. Supplementary methods of training such as highfidelity simulation should be considered to provide trainees with more experience. As two-thirds of these incidents occurred outside normal working hours, undertaking twilight shifts during a dedicated trauma block may maximise exposure.

Early initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can double or quadruple the survival rate [1] . American Heart Association (AHA) recommended callers to start chest compression in less than 180 seconds from call receipt [2] Providing telephone-CPR (t-CPR) instructions to callers has been shown to decrease time to first chest compression and to improve patient survival rate [1] . A t-CPR protocol has been introduced and routinely followed in Saudi Arabian emergency medical services (EMS) since 2017. However, callers first chest compression and patients return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) have not been investigated yet. This study aims to examine callers first chest compression time and patients ROSC rate. Method A retrospective observational analysis of OHCA calls made to EMS in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia was conducted. OHCA patients were identified by reviewing archived EMS patients reports, then calls reported for these patients were retrieved from the EMS calling system. A sample of one hundred consecutive non-traumatic OHCAs of adult patients reported by adult Arabic spoken callers from January 2017-July 2018 was selected.",

Following RSI trauma patients are typically ventilated using an inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) of 1.0, irrespective of the presence or absence of hypoxaemia. High quality evidence associates hyperoxia with increased risk of morbidity and mortality in various subsets of critically ill patients, including major trauma [1] . Method A retrospective review of the Air Ambulance Kent Surrey Sussex (AAKSS) database (HEMSbase) was undertaken to identify intubated trauma patients transferred to St George's Hospital between October 2014 and May 2019. Pre-hospital data collected included: RSI time, FiO2 and pulse oximetry saturations (SpO2) on arrival. In-hospital data included the first arterial blood gas (ABG) taken on arrival. ABGs taken >2 hours following admission were excluded. The cohort was categorised into four oxygen exposure groups based on previous studies: hypoxia < 60 mmHg, normoxia 60-120 mmHg, mild hyperoxia 120-200 mmHg, and severe hyperoxia as >200 mmHg [2, 3] . Results 209 patients were included in the final analysis. 59% (n = 124) were severely hyperoxic, 20% (n = 41) had mild hyperoxia, 19% (n = 40) were normoxic and 2% patients (n = 4) were hypoxic. Average arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) for the cohort was 268mmHg, maximal PaO2 recorded was 644mmHg and minimal was 50mmHg. Average time from RSI to arrival was 59 minutes. Arrival SpO2 was recorded in 200 patients, 75% (n = 150) had saturations >98% on arrival. Only 3 patients were documented as having their FiO2 reduced to 0.5 during the pre-hospital phase. Conclusion Hyperoxia exposure is common in the intubated HEMS trauma patient (79%). Prospective analysis is needed to define the incidence and impact of hyperoxia in the pre-hospital phase. In addition, strategies to avoid hyperoxia need to be developed to avoid unnecessary harm to our patients.",

Fewer patients required urgent surgery and critical care admission than expected and almost 2/5 were discharged on the day of admission. This information is useful in planning services as often members of the trauma team have additional roles in the organisation.22.Trauma Tertiary Survey Proforma improves tertiary survey documentation at a major trauma centre Apichaya Amrapala, Safiya Hafeji, Kate Hancorn, Ross Davenport, Anne Weaver Department of Trauma Surgery, Royal London Hospital, London, UK Correspondence: Apichaya Amrapala (a.amrapala@nhs.net) Scandinavian Journal of Trauma, Resuscitation and Emergency Medicine 2020, 28(Suppl 1):22.BackgroundThe trauma Tertiary Survey Examination (TSE) is crucial for identification of injuries otherwise missed on primary and secondary surveys and improves outcomes for trauma patients[1]. Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines recommend TSE within 24-48 hours of hospital admission to include a complete head-to-toe examination with re-evaluation of previous imaging[2]. We conducted an audit of TSE of trauma patients at a Major Trauma Centre to assess whether they meet the ATLS standards and how this changed after implementing a dedicated TSE proforma. Methods TSE documentation for 30 patients retrospectively selected at random from January 2019 trauma admissions at the Royal London Hospital were evaluated for 1) time for completion of TSE, 2) completeness of head-to-toe examination and 3) review of imaging. TSE Proforma was developed and implemented in March 2019 with re-audit of 30 patients performed in June 2019. Data was analysed using chi-squared test, with significance set at p<0.05. Results 29 patients had documented TSE in January, 30 patients in June. 93% of TSEs in June were completed with the proforma. Proforma use led to significant improvements in documentation of Glasgow Coma Scale (10% versus 100%, p<0.0001), imaging review (17% versus 93%, p<0.0001), central nervous system (83 % versus 100%, p=0.0226), pelvis (66% versus 100%, p = 0.0007), peripheral nervous system (66% versus 96%, p = 0.0034) and spine (83% versus 100%, p=0.0226) examinations. There was no change in TSE completion times with proforma use (76% versus 86%, p=0.35).",

In haemodynamically unstable patients, thoracotomy allows for rapid control of haemorrhage. Currently, there is limited guidance on the management of haemodynamically stable patients admitted with penetrating chest trauma. The aim of this study was to review the management of penetrating trauma in this region. Methods This is a retrospective review of patients admitted with penetrating chest trauma to Bristol from June 2014 -April 2019. Data was collected from the Trauma and Audit Research Network (TARN) database. Simple descriptive analysis was carried out. Results 81cases were identified, with 61 (75%) cases admitted following assault and 14 (17%) following self-harm. 14 patients were managed under thoracic surgery. Weapons included knives, rifles, and a crossbow. There were 39 (48%) cases with ISS > 15. Major haemorrhage protocol was activated in 13 13(16%) cases. 52%) with ICD. One patient required MVR, and one required embolization of a false aneurysm. The 30-day mortality was 7%. Median length of stay was 4 days (IQR 3 -8). 49 (60%) cases were discharged home, 16 (20%) required transfer to another acute hospital, and 6 (7%) required post-operative rehabilitation. Five patients had a post-op chest infection. One patient had postthoracotomy pain syndrome, and one had persistent pneumothorax following ICD insertion.ConclusionsPenetrating chest trauma is an increasingly prevalent presentation to ED in the UK. The majority of patients were stable on presentation and did not require transfer to a thoracic unit. Of the patients transferred to thoracics, VATS seems to be a safe approach.24.Using population and demand data to inform service planning for the EMRTS Wales Matthew Edwards 1 , David Rawlinson 1,2 , Ami Jones 1 , David Lockey1  and Richard Fry 2 The Emergency Medical Retrieval & Transfer Service (EMRTS) Wales, Cardiff UK; 2 Swansea University, Swansea Wales, UK Correspondence: David Rawlinson (david.rawlinson@wales.nhs.uk) Scandinavian Journal of Trauma, Resuscitation and Emergency Medicine 2020, 28(Suppl 1):24.BackgroundThe Emergency Medical Retrieval & Transfer Service (EMRTS) Cymru launched in April 2015, providing a 08:00-20:00 daily air and road response to pre-hospital emergencies and inter-hospital transfers across Wales.
