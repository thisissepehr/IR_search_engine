It is essential to reach the correct diagnosis and treat the underlying disease aggresively. Definition of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome was offered in 1980s by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for surveillance purposes, and criteria were revised in 2001, with high specificity. We report a case of 59-year old female who started a special weight-reducing diet regimen that included excessive cashew nut ingestion. Several months after she has presented with periferal blood eosinophilia and constitutional symptoms. Detailed work-up has not found elements for haematological, systemic autoimmune, neoplastic or infectious disease. She was diagnosed with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome due to extreme L-tryptophan intake, a compound found in the cashew nut's oil. She responded well to cashew nut withdrawal and steroid therapy.

Eosinophilia is characterized by more than 0.5 x 10 9 eosinophils per liter in the full blood count. Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) is a chronic multisystem disorder, characterised by peripheral eosinophilia, associated with muscle, nerve, fascia and skin involvement [1] . According to the medical literature majority of the pateints affected are caucasian females between 35-60 years old [2, 3] . The disease was first described in 1989 in New Mexico, when a nationwide outbreak occurred. Toxoepidemiologic studies linked EMS to dietary supplements containing L-tryptophan that had been manufactured using genetically engineered bacteria [4] . The best characterized contaminant is 1,1-ethylidenebis (EBT), a tryptophan dimer. For the purpose of nationwide surveillance, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined the syndrome as requiring the following criterias: incapacitating myalgias, a blood eosinophil count greater then 1000 cells/\u03bcL and no evidence of other specific disease that could account for these findings (Table 1) . Contamination with L-tryptophan may not be the only cause of EMS. It is estimated that up to 14% of EMS cases are not related to L-tryptophan [2] . In these cases the symptoms are milder and the prognosis is better. Another similar entity is toxic oil syndrome (TOS) that affected thousands of Spanish patients in 1981 and is associated with ingestion of adulterated rapeseed oil. The condition shares many clinical and histopatological features with EMS. Biochemical data suggest that an impurity detected in L-tryptophan-3-(phenylamino)alanine (PAA) shares chemical properties with 3-(Nphenylamino)-1,2-propanediol, implicated in TOS epidemic.

She did not have any apparent skin changes or leading infectious disease symptoms. Routine laboratory tests were carried out and anaemia with leucocytosis and eosinophilia was established ( Table 2 ). The patient was referred to Haematology Outpatient Clinic for additional follow-up. Additional laboratory tests confirmed microcytic anaemia and eosinophilia. Aspiration of the bone marrow and cytology analysis found around 40% of all granulocytopoietic cells to be eosinophils. Blasts or any other pathological cells were not found. Cytogenetic analysis showed normal female karyotype (46 XX) without BCR/ABL mutation.

It is very important to look for underlying causes of eosinophilia. Our patient most probably had eosinophila-myalgia syndrome due to excessive cashew nut intake. Cashew nuts are prepared and conserved in rapeseed oil with large quantitiy of L-tryptophan. Because our patient has consumed large amounts (approx. 200 grams per day over 6 months) we suspected that the intake of L-tryptophan in rapeseed oil was also in excess. The amount was sufficient to cause eosinophilia. As our patient presented with general nonspecific symptoms (high fever, arthralgias, myalgias and intensive fatigue) wide diagnostics has been carried out and more common causes were excluded -haematological, neoplastic, paraneoplastic, systemic autoimmune, infective (parasitic) diseases and syndromes (Table 3) . Taken together the eosinophilia and impressive clinical symptoms, the revised criteria proposed in 2001 for the diagnosis of EMS were fulfilled. Performed muscle biopsy was consistent with the diagnosis. Similar cases of EMS caused by intake of L-tryptophan were described in available medical literature [4, 5] . The cases describe patients who were taking different over the counter products for diverse purposes. Those products included large amounts of L-tryptophan. L-tryptophan is one of essential amino acids which can not be synthesized by the human body. It is an important precursor of other amino acids (for example, serotonin is synthesized by tryptophan hydroxilase). L-tryptophan can be found in sesame, chickpeas, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, peanuts, dairy products, eggs, red meat, fish and poultry. Although there is evidence that blood tryptophan levels are unlikely to be altered by changing the diet, tryptophan has been available in health food stores as a dietary supplement. Moreover, tryptophan has shown some effectiveness as a therapeutic agent in a variety of conditions typically associated with low serotonin levels in the brain. It has been used as a sleeping aid, as an antidepressant, and as an augmenter of antidepressant drugs. It is known that excessive oral ingestion of tryptophan supplements inhibits histamine degradation by increasing formation of formate and indolyl metabolites. These metabolites block the degradation of histamine, thereby potentiating its effects. Increased histamine activity induces peripheral blood eosinophilia and myalgia [1] . On this theory an alternative explanation for the 1989 EMS outbreak was based; that excess histamine caused EMS. Since not all consumers who used implicated drug in 1989 developed EMS, genetic and other factors are also likely to play a role in precipitation of EMS [9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 84, "end": 87, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 88, "end": 90, "text": "8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1188, "end": 1191, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1194, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2472, "end": 2475, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2744, "end": 2747, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 871, "end": 880, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Because of the abrupt onset of serious and potentially life-threatening symptoms (incapacitaing myalgia, pulmonary invovement which can lead to ARDS [4] , demyelination), it is important to diagnose EMS and start the therapy early.
