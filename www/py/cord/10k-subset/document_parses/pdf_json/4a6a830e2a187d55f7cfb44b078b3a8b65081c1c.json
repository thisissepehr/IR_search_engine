In search of functional proteins related to the pathogenesis of Chinese S. suis 2 (SS2), unexpectedly, a variant of Sao protein was obtained. To test its prevalence in S. suis, PCR assay was adopted to address the coding genes systematically. It was found that there are three allelic variants of sao gene, namely sao-S, sao-M, and sao-L based on the different lengths of the genes ($1.5, $1.7, and $2.0 kb, respectively). These differences were determined to be caused by heterogeneity within the number of C-terminal repeat sequences (R), which had been seen as a pathogenicity-related domain in the plant pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae. Two variants (sao-M and sao-L) were only found in SS2. All three variant proteins were prepared in vitro and their biochemical and biophysical properties were characterized. A soluble form of Sao-M protein was then used as a capture antigen to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method to detect antibodies against SS2 in convalescent pig sera. Taken together, the results exhibit the properties of Sao proteins and provide an efficient Sao-M-based method for monitoring SS2 infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Streptococcus suis infection of swine is recognized as the leading cause of highly invasive diseases such as meningitis, septicemia, arthritis, and even sudden death, and has spread over 20 countries, resulting in great economic losses in pigindustries each year (Staats et al., 1997; Huang et al., 2005) . Streptococcus suis is also a notorious zoonotic agent responsible for more than 200 cases of severe infections in humans worldwide since its first discovery in Denmark in 1968 (Staats et al., 1997) . Thirty-five serotypes of S. suis have been determined based on differences among their capsule antigens (Staats et al., 1997) . However, Hill et al. (2005) recently suggested that the two serotypes (serotype 32 and serotype 34) may be excluded from S. suis species and redesignated as Streptococcus orisratti. Virulence varies greatly among the serotypes and can be divided into three groups: highly pathogenic, hypovirulent, and avirulent (Staats et al., 1997) . Streptococcus suis 2 (SS2) is the most prevalent serotype isolated from both diseased piglets and patients worldwide and is often associated with severe clinical syndrome (Staats et al., 1997) . In particular, two large-scale outbreaks of lethal SS2 infections with a hallmark of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) emerged in China (one in Jiangsu Province, 1998, and the other in Sichuan Province, 2005) , posing a great global concern to the public health (Tang et al., 2006) . As it is known that human SS2 infections have been documented for several decades, the molecular mechanism underlying the high pathogenicity of this bacterial agent is still poorly understood (Staats et al., 1997; Gottschalk et al., 1999) . Several bacterial components have been previously implicated in S. suis virulence, but the exact role remains unclear (Staats et al., 1997; Gottschalk et al., 1999; Gottschalk & Segura, 2000) . So far, the virulence-associated factors identified include components of capsule polysaccharide (CPS) (Smith et al., 2000) , extracellular factor (EF) (Smith et al., 1993; Staats et al., 1999) , muraminidase-released protein (MRP) (Staats et al., 1999) , suilysin (Allen et al., 2001; Lun et al., 2003) , adhesions (Tikkanen et al., 1996; Brassard et al., 2004) , 38 kDa protein (Okwumabua & Chinnapapakkagari, 2005) , glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) (Okwumabua et al., 2001) , fibronectin-binding protein (FBP) (de Greeff et al., 2002; Wang, 2006) , hayluronate lyase (King et al., 2004) , sortase A (srtA) (Osaki et al., 2002) , arginine deiminase (Gruening et al., 2006) , etc. In some instances, the virulence determination of some S. suis strains was still ambiguous, indicating that the virulence of S. suis is a complex interplay between the pathogen, its host, and the environment (Gottschalk et al., 1999) . Considerable efforts to control severe SS2 infections have still been hampered greatly by the limited knowledge of S. suis pathogenesis (Staats et al., 1997; Gottschalk et al., 1999; Gottschalk & Segura, 2000; Haesebrouck et al., 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 263, "end": 284, "text": "(Staats et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 285, "end": 304, "text": "Huang et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 483, "end": 504, "text": "(Staats et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 611, "end": 632, "text": "(Staats et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 644, "end": 662, "text": "Hill et al.

In light of this unexpected observation, it was attempted to examine the prevalence in various serotypes of S. suis, and test its possible genetic variation or molecular polymorphism. Thus, PCR screening was undertaken to test more than 50 different S. suis strains comprising 34 kinds of serotypes (except for S. suis 12).

Furthermore, it was possible to classify Sao into three groups and the proteins were also characterized via a range of biochemical techniques. Immunological data from Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) also demonstrated that Sao-M, the most common type of Sao, has strong immunogenicity.

Although sao genes could not be amplified from several S. suis strains (e.g., 10581, 2726, 865191, etc.), the absence of sao genes might have been caused by the considerable variation during the evolution of these serotypes.

In that study, the authors also found EF, a derivative of EF \u00c3 lacking the repeat units at its C-terminus, and was correlated with increased virulence (Smith et al., 1993) . Therefore, it would be of interest to determine whether or not the present deletion variants in Sao proteins have any correlation with their pathogenicity of the organisms.
