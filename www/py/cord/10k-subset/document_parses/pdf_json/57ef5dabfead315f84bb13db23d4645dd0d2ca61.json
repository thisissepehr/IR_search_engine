This democratization of geomatics through the GeoWeb results in the emergence of a new form of mapping based on Web 2.0 technologies. Described as Webmapping 2.0, it is especially characterized by high interactivity and geolocation-based contents generated by users. A series of recent events (hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics) have urged the development of numerous mapping Web applications intended to provide information to the public, and encourage their contribution to support crisis management. This new way to produce and spread geographic information in times of crisis brings up many questions and new potentials with regard to urgency services, Non Governmental Organisations (NGO), as well as individuals. This paper aims at putting into perspective the development of GeoWeb, both in terms of technologies and applications, against crisis management processes.",

The production of maps and geographic information is no longer exclusive to professionals. This democratisation of digital cartography is partly due to the development of the GeoWeb (Herring 1994) , which refers to the merging of the Web with geospatial technologies and geographic information. Today's GeoWeb relies on the Web 2.0 infrastructure, and is core to its organization. By its very nature, it is participatory, because it offers dynamic and interactive maps. On the one hand, spatial technologies and practices converge and combine to achieve complementarity, and on the other hand the usage of the Web develops into a more mature type of socialisation based upon open networks, collaborative work, information sharing and global actions (Tapscott and Williams 2007) . As a result, the GeoWeb has become a collective platform progressively built on the practices, tools and data generated by the users, and where location-based content can be shared.",

            "text": "This paradigm shift in the production and use of maps on the Web, which Haklay et al. (2008) named Web-Mapping 2.0, results from several technological advances that benefit more from the Web (especially 2.0) than from geomatics (AJAX, XML, RSS, tag, etc.). The GeoWeb technologies offer more flexible structures (thanks to new-generation languages), more open communication protocols, as well as a more extensive interoperability (syndication via RSS, mashups and use of API-Application Programming Interface). Available cartographic API such as Google Maps or Bing Maps (Microsoft) enable to display many different basic data (roads, satellite images, topography, addresses) and constitute today the base maps of the GeoWeb. The mashup concept (blend) consists in combining, on base maps, data from a variety of sources. Yet, API are not just for viewing, they offer many other tools for manipulating spatial data (editing, updating, enhancing, qualification) . As a result, any user can build up maps that are personal (static or dynamic) and customizable (feature implementation, scale, type of data) with any type of data. The geographical location of any type of available Web content (photo, video, article, link) can thus be established via different means (geotagging, geocoding). As a complement, the development of mobile solutions and use (Smartphones implemented with GPS-type location features, Wifi, 3G) provides the GeoWeb with a new dimension on which users' mobility practices are based. The advent of this largepublic oriented on-line cartography, where interactivity is as important as the content, generates new mapping environments. The development of mapping Web services, which supports the building and diffusion of VGI, substantially modifies the stated strategies used for the production of geographic information. Traditional production processes change and producers are more diversified (Web-users, communities of practice, web-actors, etc.) . This usergenerated geographic information constitutes, without a doubt, a new source of local knowledge, quite informal indeed but with such a potential richness that it represents today a relevant complement to institutional data (Seeger 2008; Heipke 2010) . This is how new spatial practices have emerged (collaborative mapping, georeferencing contents, network vectorization, collective qualification of places, etc.) and the respective roles of both professionals and amateurs have been redefined. The processes and practices used for the voluntary production of geographic information represent major societal and scientific challenges (Gouveai and Fonseca 2008; Elwood 2009; Sui 2008; Goodchild 2009 ). As the adaptation of the geospatial industry via crowdsourcing clearly illustrates, the development of Webmapping 2.0 as a general public component of geomatics and mapping should be considered beyond the leisure and amateurism spheres. Indeed, there is the question of mobilizing and using volunteered geographic information across ''traditional'' spatial data application fields, especially when it comes to crisis and disaster management for which quick access to accurate and up-to-date information is essential.",

New technologies and their usages allow improving prevention, planning and response capacities in times of crisis. As Muntz et al. (2003) underlined, the processes related to crisis management are based on geographic information and associated technologies. The development of new information and communication technologies, such as mobile phones, Internet, social networks or online-mapping, paved the way to new information handling practice. Many recent events related to political crisis, emergency situations or natural disasters have resulted in the implementation and spontaneous organization of map mashups and in the use of instantaneous communication tools (hurricane Katrina, H1N1 flu, Haiti or New-Zealand earthquake, etc.). These increasingly systematic initiatives constitute a driving force for the dissemination of extensive information, and the networking of remote communities or individuals who wish to offer their help to local people. This new technology-based approach brings substantial changes to the conventional information chain used in crisis management by mixing authoritative and non-authoritative data (Goodchild 2009) .",

Their main challenge is to efficiently collect, share and use relevant information and knowledge from the field, in order to make the most informed decisions as fast as possible. In such situations, the GeoWeb can provide technological and methodological tools that are increasingly reliable and rational. On the technical and usage side, the potential of ICT and geospatial technologies to gather and share information efficiently in times of crisis has improved, thanks to the development of telecommunications networks (Internet, mobile phones). This is what our paper is about: proposing a framework for the assessment of the potential of the GeoWeb (as a complex platform including tools, methods, approaches) and of VGI (as contents) for crisis management and response. To do so, section ''GeoWeb use case and crisis management'' provides an overview of the current uses of the GeoWeb in crisis management contexts, through an analysis made on a series of recent examples. The principles and emerging challenges related to crisis management will be set out in section ''Consideration on the potential of GeoWeb technologies in improving crisis management''. Finally, the strengths, weaknesses and opportunities of the GeoWeb and VGI in terms of crisis management, will be addressed in the last section.",

The benefit of such Web applications is to provide visual, clear and coherent organization of information based on a spatial reference system (Goodchild and Glennon 2010; Liu and Palen 2010) .

From the fire database operated by the Country Fire Authority (CFA), Google Australia developed a mashup offering real-time tracking of the fires recorded by the authorities. Fires are marked with dots on the Google Maps API. Each dot provides the characteristics of the fire it is associated to (start date and time, status, type, size, number of emergency vehicles dispatched to the scene, level of control). This mapping application is based on the dual-use of a Google Maps API and a RSS feed of CFA website, as well as on information provided by the state of Victoria.

As a matter of fact, whereas most of the traditional communication infrastructures failed in the wake of the Hurricane, the Internet remained the only source to relay information on the situation in Louisiana. Among all the websites created in an emergency to mitigate the lack of data and the crisis situation, Scipionus Contrary to a blog where only the author has permission to modify his Web pages, Scipionus interactive map enabled every user to publish his/her own location-based information. This participative space made it possible for the local inhabitants to reassure their families and friends, or to describe the disaster and the slow receding of flood waters. Created by a computer programmer from New Orleans, this initiative was rapidly used by telecommunication operators, TV channels, newspapers and the Web. Launched a few days after the disaster, tens of thousands of visitors hit the site to find useful information on the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina. Based on the Google Maps technology, the site offered a dynamic and interactive map of the flooded zones. Each visitor could add complementary information to give a more accurate description of the damage, to report and find missing persons. According to the logic of mashups, the location-based data displayed on the mapping API came from different forums and blogs, which partly explains its success (Miller 2007) .",

Initially, the project aimed at reporting on a specific crisis situation on the basis of the testimonies of the people involved. A few months later, thanks to the support of an American NGO, the blog became a software application adaptable to various crisis situations. Ushahidi also provides applications to cover specific and time-bound events (violence in South Africa, Congo, Kenya and Gaza strip; elections in India and Mexico; earthquake in Haiti, blizzard in the United States\u2026).",

Once this information is pooled, formalized, documented and checked, it is added to the map. The purpose is to record, aggregate and cross-check the information From a technical point of view, the platform operates according to the logic of mashups, that is to say: it combines several Web services (mapping, database, data handling tools, visual functionalities, etc.). Free and available to all as an API, this Open Source project is based on both Web (XML, JSON, AJAX) and GeoWeb (mapping API, Open Layer, KML, GeoRSS) standards. The platform was developed to be fully adjustable to meet the needs of the organizations and the crisis settings within which it is implemented (classification and display arrangements, feedback system, safety and export functions). Classification is based on a semantic qualification of information that follows the principle of category. Moreover, this application allows text and audio data to be catalogued and integrated, thus enriching the testimonies. It is also important to point out that the people behind this ambitious project provide technical support to the implementation and creation of new functionalities.",

In 2 weeks it received over 3,000 testimonies, more than half of which had been posted via SMS. Thanks to the rapid creation of a working partnership with Digicel Haiti, a mobile telephone provider, and other organizations (firms, emergency services, NGO), Ushahidi deployed the 4,636 project to enable people on the spot to provide near-real time feedback via SMS: calls for assistance, vital lines, potential threats, individual news, etc. Since the relative restoration to working order of the telecommunication networks, a free short code was provided to send SMS whether in Creole, French or English, to text locations and needs. Each piece of information is followed by the term ''verified'' or ''unverified''. Events are organized into six main categories (emergency, security threats, vital lines, services available, other and persons news) and twenty-four sub-categories (contaminated water, looting, fire, food distribution point, shelter offered, road blocked, missing person, etc.). Beside the ''Mainstream News'' and ''Incidents'', all the reports created can be consulted, along with the photos and videos that go with them. Users can not only text a testimony (via SMS, e-mail or on-line form), but also get alerts (via SMS or e-mail) to be notified of the events occurring at a specific location or within a specific area. In order to crowdsource and, permanently integrate these reports as legitimate and actionable sources of information, the system must be able to rapidly identify inaccurate, intentional exaggerated, or accidental information. We should briefly describe the processing and validation of reports, since it evolved alongside events.",

Consequently, data were quickly integrated into a series of mashups and virtual globes, and then rapidly disseminated, adapted and used on-site via various formats and on different platforms by NGOs and emergency agencies. ''Non-standard'' events can happen anywhere or anytime, and today our societies are more vulnerable and unstable than in the past. The notion of risk results from the conjunction of hazard and vulnerability. These transformations thus essentially arise from the fact that the stakes and vulnerability have considerably increased in risk prone areas (interconnectivity of more and more complex operating systems, pernicious effects of the protection choices, accelerating anthropisation, etc.). This casts a new light on the challenges related to general information, and more specifically to spatial information when it comes to contemporary crisis and disaster management. As a matter of fact, these destructive events strike without notice.

Prevention implies the crosschecking of all the data related to hazards, issues and vulnerabilities at various scales.

Guihou talks about the ''biological wound'' (as opposed to ''mechanical failure'') to explain the fact that in a confused environment, where the very texture of the socio-technical system is torn apart, rescue and emergency issues should not be addressed strictly ''top-down'', but rather ''bottom-up'', starting with the local actors (Guihou et al. 2006) . ''It is necessary to set up teams, open networks, listening abilities and information sharing processes (\u2026), open leadership (to many external stakeholders) able to share and mobilize intelligence to find innovative responses (\u2026). Civil society should work hand-in-hand with the decision-makers; citizens must be involved in preparedness and response'' (Lagadec 2005) .",

Spatial information sharing between different stakeholders, including the population, is part of this crucial context. Experiments in progress aim at developing spatial information and its use in crisis management situations. The Quebec Ministry of Public Security developed a georeferencing tool for ''remote visualisation of maps, satellite images or photos, all at the same time during conference calls'' taking place in critical contexts (for example: rising waters) (Gignac and Fortin 2008) . It is based on a teleconferencing system managed by the Ministry and implemented with a free software application to establish the connection between the partners. It allows interactive combination of data from several sources, to plot elements on a map or to add new graphic or text information. A first experimentation made it possible to monitor the progress of the forest fires that burned thousands of acres in Northern Quebec in 2006 and 2007, and to coordinate the daily operations between the different partners (SOPFEU, MNRW, STARIM-SAT and the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Chicoutimi) scattered throughout the territory.

Moreover, RSS feeds and aggregators offer dynamic information those progresses alongside with the event (advisories and warnings, wide and targeted). Tags and microformats classify information to make the query system more efficient. Furthermore, dynamic and interactive maps provide rescaling possibilities.

Moreover, these applications can integrate authoritative data. Using the social media map model (based on ArcGIS Online and API ArcGIS for JavaScript), these mashups enable to inform people about what is happening and where thanks to the various data flows stemming from social networks.

ESRI's involvement (with Social Media/VGI App) is a significant example of the hybridization between amateurs and professionals.

The licensing restrictions around authoritative data and crowdsourced community data are another important issue to be covered: Google Mapmaker data cannot be combined with OpenStreetMap data for instance because of licensing restrictions. As a result, data are provided in various formats to suit most GIS and GPS software. Even if the geometric accuracy of the maps and plans produced by the digital volunteers is quite low, the data generated are interoperable with the NGO and emergency units' systems (IS, GIS, GPS) . In Haiti, the data thus created were used as a vector basis for the work of official bodies. Some of the map legends produced by UNOSAT refers to OpenStreetMap.

How to connect the information coming from the authorities and experts with knowledge and observations sent by the general public and the affected people? Works are already being conducted on the convergence of Web and mobility, with the idea of mobiquity-mobility and ubiquity- (Pisani and Piotet 2008) , which could provide some elements of answer. The range of mobile telecommunication devices increasing with time (cell phones, smartphones), new and innovative approaches emerge with respect to crisis management, such as using the concept ATAWAD-AnyTime, AnyWhere, AnyDevice (Dalloz 2004) . As shown in the examples above, creating networks of individuals through computers, mobile phones and communicating GPS, converts the Web into both a source of information and a communication platform. In the field, individuals contribute more and more to the production of information via their mobile phones. The 4,636 SMS system set up in Haiti amply demonstrated the potential of applications combining mobility, positioning systems and Web technologies. Today Ushahidi offers a smart phone application with basic functionalities to visualize new reports and upload incidents with pictures, links and location.",

A crisis communication on the Internet must integrate the dimension of information dissemination through social networks. This is also one of the major changes in the design of crisis management on the Internet compared to other media (Huang et al. 2010) . As a matter of fact, one of the important features of the Web 2.0 is its ability to generate connections via social networks. The use of forums or maps builds a link between missing persons, homeless, worried families or relatives (Jarvis 2009 ). Vine, a service developed by Microsoft and designed to enable families and friends to stay in touch anytime and anywhere, even when all means of communication are down, was a good example of this new type of crisis management. This service offered connection via a PC client desktop, text messages or emails. Vine allowed, through social networks, the transfer of detailed reports to relatives who could receive them directly on their control panel via the Web, or on their mobile phones. Vine seems to have been abandoned by Microsoft despite the positive feedbacks from users who had tested the beta version. In the same vein, the last versions of Scipionus and Ushahidi offer a functionality called ''persons news'' and, Crisis Commons is an interesting precursor to this type of solutions. Also, the project MISSING, initiated by the Red Helmets Foundation, aims at implementing a reference platform dedicated to the search for missing persons in times of crisis. Developed in partnership with Google, Bearstech and European Consulting Services, this application is based on a set of efficient technologies using the Web 2.0 and the GeoWeb with an additional spatial component.",

It is very important that validation processes can make the difference between facts and opinions. That is why the semantic modalities of the contributions are essential for their validation and qualification. Validation, which is carried out by the agencies on the ground, is neither simple nor trivial. And yet, it is essential especially during the official emergency services' exercises, for they are (legally) liable. Indeed, there were some accidents resulting from the improper use of data (mainly related to the inadequacy of data versus the uses) have already been brought to light (Geoide project IV-23, 2010). As the Ushahidi platform administrators explained it, testimonies are dispatched according to the organizations concerned; and twice a day, liaison officers are contacted to conduct updates. It is largely for this reason that emergency responders made a very limited use of Ushahidi, whereas NGO based (though to a limited extent) their interventions on these field reports, in complement with other sources of information. Emergency responders need to receive real time reports about incidents, while NGO providing services such as food or water need more aggregated information, like allowed by Ushahidi (Heinzelman and Waters 2010) .",
