MBL deficiency appears to predispose to meningococcal sepsis [35] , another severe infection caused by an encapsulated organism. This clinical association is also supported by investigations of the ability of MBL to bind to and facilitate killing of Neisseria meningitidis [36] . There was only a small number of patients with N. meningitidis infection in the current study, because patients from a previous large study did not have MBL levels or MBL2 promoter haplotypes determined [35] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 161, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 234, "end": 238, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 395, "end": 399, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1062, "end": 1066, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1186, "end": 1190, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1254, "end": 1258, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1466, "end": 1470, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1676, "end": 1680, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The most important limitation of the present study is the heterogeneity of both the control and infected populations. Nonetheless, the large sample collection from multiple racial and geographic sources has provided an opportunity to demonstrate robust associations between MBL and predisposition to severe infection. Differences in serum MBL level testing methodologies may interfere with comparison of results. The basic laboratory methodology used for all results from the healthy control population that were collated here was the same methodology used with the double anti-MBL sandwich antibody ELISAs performed. Finally, differences may exist in the nature of the serum standards used to produce standard curves and to derive results.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The nature of the acute-phase MBL response was studied as part of a number of the sepsis studies included here [11, 16, 37] . These studies reveal that, at most, the variation in MBL levels is of a factor of 2-3 fold, with one study showing the same proportions of septic patients having increased, decreased, and stable MBL levels [37] . MBL did not behave as an acutephase reactant when it was studied in the context of pneumococcal infection [11] . In the context of surgical injury, MBL levels were not shown to alter substantially, in marked comparison to the known acute-phase reactants CRP and IL-6 [38] . It is unlikely, therefore, that a substantial decrease in MBL levels as a result of consumption from sepsis is the cause of the association between low MBL level, sepsis, and poor outcome. This is particularly pertinent to the association demonstrated between MBL deficiency and death in patients with pneumococcal sepsis. Although changes in MBL have been correlated with the type of organism causing sepsis, it has been shown that MBL is consumed in sepsis due to gram-negative, but not gram-positive, organisms [39] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 111, "end": 115, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 116, "end": 119, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 120, "end": 123, "text": "37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 332, "end": 336, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 445, "end": 449, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 606, "end": 610, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1127, "end": 1131, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "MBL may be extracted from plasma or produced by recombinant means for clinical use in deficient or septic patients. Phase I studies of MBL infusion have been performed [40] . MBL has a long serum half-life, and there is limited experience of its use for cystic fibrosis [41] and other chronic infections. Recombinant human MBL replacement therapy is now being studied in clinical trials involving patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation and liver transplantation. The data from the large patient cohort that we report suggest a serum level that reliably indicates MBL deficiency. It is clear from this data that low MBL level is a more reliable indicator of deficiency than is the presence of low-producing MBL2 genotypes. This rationally derived MBL serum level cutoff for deficiency could be used to guide replacement therapy with MBL. Because death in the context of severe bacterial infection, especially when due to pneumococcus, was associated with MBL deficiency after adjustment for bacteremia, age, and comorbidity, severe bacterial pneumonia could be an important future target for study of MBL therapy. Mortality associated with bacteremic pneumococcal infection has remained largely unchanged, despite 50 years of advancements in supportive care.
