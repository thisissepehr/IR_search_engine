Many reported results have shown that the topological structure of an epidemic network plays a vital role in its epidemic threshold. By using the heterogeneous mean-field (HMF) method on a standard SIS epidemic network, 1 its epidemic threshold is given by b c \u00bc hki=hk 2 i, where hki and hk 2 i are the first and second moments of the network degree distribution. By using linear stability analysis on an SIS Markovian epidemic network, a more exact result is that the epidemic threshold is given by b c \u00bc 1/k 1 , where k 1 is the largest eigenvalue of the network's adjacency matrix. [2] [3] [4] With this observation, the influence of the network topological characteristics on the spreading behaviour has been further investigated in depth. [5] [6] [7] [8] Finally, by embedding more realistic factors into traditional epidemic networks, many epidemic thresholds have been derived on multiplex networks such as epidemic networks with awareness, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] traffic-driven epidemic networks, 14,15 epidemic networks with community structure, 16, 17 interconnected epidemic networks, [18] [19] [20] time-varying epidemic networks, 21-23 adaptive epidemic network, 24, 25 and so on.",

In fact, the well-known NW smallworld network 26 is generated using this same idea to address the transition properties between regular-lattice and randomlattice behavior in social networks. Consequently, the whole network can be divided into two unattached sub-networks: deterministic network and stochastic network.

Hence, the diversity of connection probability should be considered to obtain more reasonable models (see the case of nonuniform stochastic connections in Sec. IV). For universality, individual awareness and community structure will be also considered in our models. It is well known that many social networks have the community structures, where there exists a high density of intra-connections within each community, and a lower density of inter-connections between communities. In view of these (above) factors, to achieve the epidemic threshold estimation, we will first construct several SIS Markovian epidemic networks with deterministic and stochastic connections.",

An irreducible nonnegative n \u00c2 n matrix A always has a real, positive eigenvalue k 1 (A), and the modulus of any other eigenvalue does not exceed k 1 (A). Moreover, k 1 (A) is a simple zero of the characteristic polynomial det(A -kI n ). The eigenvector belonging to k 1 (A) has positive components. Now, we present the introduction about the traditional SIS Markovian epidemic network. In this network, each node can be in one of two distinct states at each time: susceptible (S) or infected (I). Each infected node can recover to be susceptible with probability d in every time step. Each susceptible node has a probability b of contagion through contact with each of its infected neighbors. So, we can define an effective spreading rate b/d. Without loss of generality, one can let d \u00bc 1. Letting p i (t) denotes the probability of individual i to be infected at time t in the network, the dynamical process of epidemic spreading can be described by the following equations 12,13 with continuous time:",

In this particular example, we choose p \u00bc 0.01 and a uniform stochastic probability a \u00bc 0.01. Under different community sizes m and n, Fig. 5 gives some comparisons between the epidemic threshold and upper-lower bound estimation in Theorem 4.

For this purpose, we give a realization in Fig. 6 which shows smaller gap than Fig. 5 . These simulation examples illustrate the correctness of theoretical results in Secs. III-V.

Second, by using the spectral analysis on these networks, we have obtained some inequality estimates of their epidemic thresholds. The results show that these inequalities are only dependent on the topological structure of deterministic connections and the stochastic connection probabilities. In other words, one can use the information of deterministic connections, but not necessarily from all connections, to estimate the epidemic threshold. This work provides a feasible method for us to estimate the epidemic thresholds in real epidemic networks, when complete description of the stochastic nature of the epidemic may be difficult to obtain.",
