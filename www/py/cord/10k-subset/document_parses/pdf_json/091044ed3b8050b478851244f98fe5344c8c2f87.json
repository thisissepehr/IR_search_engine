Recent studies have shown that hypercapnia adversely affects innate immunity, host defense, lung edema clearance and cell proliferation. Airway epithelial dysfunction is a feature of advanced lung disease, but the effect of hypercapnia on airway epithelium is unknown. Thus, in the current study we examined the effect of normoxic hypercapnia (20% CO 2 for 24 h) vs normocapnia (5% CO 2 ), on global gene expression in differentiated normal human airway epithelial cells. Gene expression was assessed on Affymetrix microarrays, and subjected to gene ontology analysis for biological process and cluster-network representation. We found that hypercapnia downregulated the expression of 183 genes and upregulated 126. Among these, major gene clusters linked to immune responses and nucleosome assembly were largely downregulated, while lipid metabolism genes were largely upregulated. The overwhelming majority of these genes were not previously known to be regulated by CO 2 . These changes in gene expression indicate the potential for hypercapnia to impact bronchial epithelial cell function in ways that may contribute to poor clinical outcomes in patients with severe acute or advanced chronic lung diseases.",

Major clusters from hypercapnia-downregulated genes are linked to immune response, nucleosome assembly, cell differentiation, oxidation reduction, and ion and lipid transport (Fig. 2) . Clusters from upregulated genes induced by high CO 2 (Fig. 3) involve biological processes related to lipid metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, signal transduction, and transport. A number of these important clusters, labelled A-E in Figs 2 and 3, are analyzed in more detail in the following sections. Their corresponding gene lists are depicted in Figs 4, 5, and Supplementary Fig. 3. Hypercapnia differentially regulates genes associated with innate immunity and nucleosome assembly. Cluster A, represented in Fig. 4a , includes hypercapnia-regulated genes involved in signal transduction, immune and inflammatory responses, and leukocyte chemotaxis. Notably, TLR4, multiple chemokines (CCL28, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL6, and CXCL14) and the IL-6 receptor gene (IL6R) were all downregulated by elevated CO 2 . On the other hand, the IL-1 receptor like 1 gene (IL1RL1) was upregulated by hypercapnia. To validate the microarray results related to CO 2 -induced changes in key immunoregulatory genes, expression of CXCL1, CXCL14, CCL28, ILR6 and TLR4 was also assessed by qPCR. We found that these genes were all downregulated at levels similar to those in the microarray analysis (Fig. 4c) . Indeed, the degree of CO 2 -induced downregulation of these transcripts assessed by qPCR and microarray was highly correlated (r 2 = 0.7981). In addition, to determine whether downregulation of a key immunoregulatory transcript by hypercapnia was accompanied by a similar change in protein expression, we assessed expression of TLR4 protein in differentiated NHBE cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy ( Fig. 4d ) and immunoblotting (Fig. 4e ) both showed that exposure to 20% CO 2 for 24 h decreased NHBE cell expression of TLR4 protein. Full-length blots are included in Supplementary Fig. 4 . Taken together, these results suggest that hypercapnia would suppress airway epithelial innate immune response to microbial pathogens and other inflammatory stimuli.",

Of importance, we utilized primary NHBE cells cultured at ALI to achieve a differentiated state closely resembling normal human bronchial epithelium. Our principal finding was that hypercapnia altered expression of a small number of specific genes (309 out of 20,390 transcripts assayed, or 1.5%) in differentiated NHBE cells. Of these, 183 genes (59%) were downregulated, while 126 (41%) were upregulated. Thus, the effects of elevated CO 2 are highly selective, involving both differential repression and differential activation of specific gene subsets. The overwhelming majority of these genes were not previously known to be regulated by CO 2 . Furthermore, gene ontogeny analysis showed enrichment of hypercapnia-regulated genes involved in a variety of fundamentally important cellular processes. Altering expression of genes related to these processes would be expected to impart functional changes in bronchial epithelial cells, which could in turn influence the pathophysiology and outcomes of many respiratory diseases.",

            "text": "Our data show that hypercapnia alters expression of multiple components of the innate immune system, including downregulation of the IL-6 receptor (IL6R); the neutrophil chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL6 28 ; the mucosal-associated chemokines CCL28 and CXCL14 [29] [30] [31] and importantly TLR4. Hypercapnia also upregulated CD55 and CD86, which bind virus at the cell surface 32, 33 . While hypercapnia downregulated TLR4, it increased the expression of IL1RL1, which has been shown to inhibit TLR4 activation 34 defense against multiple respiratory pathogens [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . Interestingly, airway epithelial TLR4 expression was reduced in patients with severe COPD as compared to those with less severe COPD 41 , possibly due to hypercapnia in patients with advanced disease. Reduced expression of immune response genes was also seen in the lungs of newborn mice exposed to moderate hypercapnia (8% CO 2 ) for the first two weeks of life 42 . While the immune genes downregulated by hypercapnia in the newborn mice differed from those we found in NHBE cells, the mucosal immunity chemokine CXCL14 43 was commonly downregulated in both systems. Taken together, these observations indicate that the airway epithelium is an important target for hypercapnic suppression of innate immune gene expression. This, along with the suppressive effects of elevated CO 2 on macrophage, neutrophil, alveolar epithelial cell functions [13] [14] [15] [17] [18] [19] likely contributes to the deleterious impact of elevated CO 2 on lung injury and host defense.",

Using a genome-wide RNAi screen, we identified a small number of genes whose expression is required for CO 2 -induced immunosuppression in Drosophila cells, and which are conserved in mammalian systems 60 . Flies deficient in of one these genes, a zinc finger homeodomain transcription factor known as zfh2, were protected from CO 2 -induced mortality associated with bacterial infection 60 .

Bacterial and viral infections are a principal cause of acute COPD exacerbations [61] [62] [63] [64] , which are linked to the need for hospitalization and to mortality 65, 66 . Thus, CO 2 -induced alterations in airway epithelial gene expression may underlie the increase in mortality associated with hypercapnia in advanced COPD, as well as community-acquired pneumonia 9 , adenoviral lung infections 10 and cystic fibrosis 11 . It is notable in this regard that reducing hypercapnia with noninvasive ventilatory support has been shown to decrease hospital readmissions and mortality in patients with severe COPD 67, 68 . Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms and mediators of CO 2 effects on gene expression may reveal targets for pharmacologic intervention to prevent hypercapnic immune suppression in patients with advanced respiratory disease.",

After the cells reached confluence in submersion culture, the medium above the inserts was removed and the cells were maintained in ALI culture for two more weeks, at which point differentiation to a pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium with characteristics of airway epithelium in vivo was established 69, 71 . Differentiation after \u223c2 wk on ALI culture was confirmed by the presence of beating cilia and mucus production, as previously described 72 . Culture of NHBE cells up to the point of full differentiation was carried out in an atmosphere of humidified 5% CO 2 /95% air at 37 \u00b0C. Hypercapnia Exposure. After differentiation, NHBE cells were cultured in ALI for an additional 24 h in humidified 20% CO 2 /21% O 2 /59% N 2 (hypercapnia) or maintained in humidified 5% CO 2 /95% air (5% CO 2 /20% O 2 /75% N 2 ; normocapnia), as control. The growth medium was pre-saturated with appropriate CO 2 concentration for 4 h prior to the addition to the cells. The PCO 2 and pH of the pre-saturated media were measured using a pHOx Plus Blood Gas Analyzer (Nova Biomedical Corp). For the normocapnia-and hypercapnia-equilibrated media, the PCO 2 s were 44 and 112 mmHg, and the corresponding pH values were 7.4 and 7.1 respectively.",

Subsequent analysis of global expression changes and ontology network assessment on the differentially selected genes was performed using Mathematica \u00ae v11.2 (Wolfram Research, Inc., Mathematica, Version 11.2, Champaign, IL (2017)). Ontology groups were generated using inbuilt GenomeData, matching the annotated genes with pre-defined processes and intracellular functions. Two approaches were used for analysis of genome wide expression changes: unbiased measurements of intra-network gene expression and fold-change ranked segmentation. Unbiased intra-network changes were assessed for cellular processes that contained at least five genes in the post-screen data. Mean-fold change, the variance of the fold-change, and Pearson correlation of expression were measured for each process. Intra-network heterogeneity of relative expression was measured by calculating the standard deviation of the relative expression for genes within any given ontological process. For instance, if a gene was classified as belonging to both \"Nucleosome Assembly\" and \"Signal Transduction\", it was assigned to both groups and a connection between these processes was indicated. To further understand the impact of hypercapnia-induced differential gene expression, cluster domains of GO biological processes containing 5 or more genes and with at least 4 connections were also generated using Mathematica \u00ae v11.2. These processes were broadly grouped based on gene function and by their connections.",
