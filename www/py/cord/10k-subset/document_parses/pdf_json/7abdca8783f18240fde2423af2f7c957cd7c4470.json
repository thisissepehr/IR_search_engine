            "text": "The Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) cysteine-rich protective antigen (PfCyRPA) has emerged as a promising blood-stage candidate antigen for inclusion into a broadly cross-reactive malaria vaccine. This highly conserved protein among various geographical strains plays a key role in the red blood cell invasion process by P. falciparum merozoites, and antibodies against PfCyRPA can efficiently prevent the entry of the malaria parasites into red blood cells. The aim of the present study was to develop a humancompatible formulation of the PfCyRPA vaccine candidate and confirming its activity in preclinical studies. Recombinant PfCyRPA expressed in HEK 293 cells was chemically coupled to phosphoethanolamine and then incorporated into the membrane of unadjuvanted influenza virosomes approved as antigen delivery system for humans. Laboratory animals were immunised with the virosome-based PfCyRPA vaccine to determine its immunogenic properties and in particular, its capacity to elicit parasite binding and growth-inhibitory antibodies. The vaccine elicited in mice and rabbits high titers of PfCyRPA-specific antibodies that bound to the blood-stage parasites. At a concentration of 10 mg/mL, purified total serum IgG from immunised rabbits inhibited parasite growth in vitro by about 80%. Furthermore, in a P. falciparum infection mouse model, passive transfer of 10 mg of purified total IgG from PfCyRPA vaccinated rabbits reduced the in vivo parasite load by 77%. Influenza virosomes thus represent a suitable antigen delivery system for the induction of protective antibodies against the recombinant PfCyRPA, designating it as a highly suitable component for inclusion into a multivalent and multi-stage virosomal malaria vaccine.",

            "text": "Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease of the tropics caused by Plasmodium parasites. Amongst the five species that can affect humans, Plasmodium falciparum is the most virulent, causing most of the malaria-related deaths globally. According to the latest World Malaria Report, 1 in 2017, there were still 219 million cases of malaria leading to 435,000 deaths. Beside this high biomedical burden, malaria impedes social and economic development in endemic areas. 2 A reduction in the global malaria disease burden has been achieved during the last decade by integrated disease control programs. This gain is at risk by the potential spread of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes and drug-resistant parasites. 1 Consequently, an effective vaccine would be a complementary tool to reduce the burden of malaria in integrated control programs and could support efforts towards malaria elimination. 3 Currently no effective malaria vaccine is commercially available, but numerous vaccine design strategies against malaria infection, disease or transmission are being actively pursued, including development of subunit vaccines and whole sporozoite vaccination approaches. 4 The major symptoms and pathology of malaria are associated with merozoites invasion and replication within red blood cells. 5 Therefore, a vaccine able to elicit antibodies that effectively prevent the invasion process after release of free merozoites into the bloodstream may reduce parasite burden, disease symptoms and indirectly also transmission. However, extensive allelic polymorphism and redundancy in erythrocyte invasion pathways are limiting strain-transcending neutralisation by traditional merozoite candidate vaccine antigens, such as apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) and merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1). 3, 6 Recently, a few new functionally essential and highly conserved merozoite proteins have emerged as more promising blood-stage candidate vaccine targets, 4 including the P. falciparum cysteinerich protective antigen (PfCyRPA). 7 PfCyRPA is a microneme-protein that is essential for merozoite invasion. It fulfils its still unknown role by forming a multi-protein complex at the interface between the merozoite and erythrocyte together with the reticulocyte-binding homolog 5 (PfRH5) and the RH5-interacting protein (PfRipr). 8, 9 This RH5/Ripr/CyRPA complex plays a central role in the mechanism of P. falciparum merozoite invasion as the complex is required for the establishment of tight junctions and the triggering of Ca 2+ release. 9 In contrast to the 'classical' blood-stage vaccine candidate antigens, PfCyRPA shows very limited genetic diversity and immunogenicity. 7 PfCyRPAspecific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can inhibit parasite growth in vitro by blocking merozoite invasion and show potent in vivo growth-inhibitory activity in P. falciparum infected NOD-scid IL2R\u03b3 null (NSG) mice engrafted with human erythrocytes. 7, 10 Like PfCyRPA, the two other partners of the invasion complex, PfRH5 and PfRipr, are vaccine candidates, as they elicit cross-strain invasion-inhibitory antibodies. 8, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Moreover, anti-PfCyRPA antibodies show: (a) Additive parasite growth-inhibitory activity, when combined with anti-RH5 antibodies both in vitro and in vivo; 16 and (b) Synergistic in vitro inhibitory activity, when combined with antibodies against some merozoite antigens, such as anti-MSRP5 and anti-RAMA, involved in non-overlapping steps during erythrocyte invasion. 17 These findings support the inclusion of PfCyRPA into a multi-component subunit malaria vaccine.",

Also effective particle-based antigen delivery platforms have been developed to achieve adequate immunogenicity. Some antigen delivery systems, like virosomes, can co-deliver immunostimodulators to enhance immunogenicity further. 18 Preclinical and clinical studies have proven the suitability of influenza derived virosomes as antigen carrier system for malaria-derived peptidomimetics and recombinant proteins. 19 These virosomes are non-replicating virus-like particles, prepared from the membrane of solubilised influenza virus mixed with synthetic phospholipids and vaccine antigens with or without adjuvants. The hemagglutinin (HA) membrane glycoprotein of the influenza virus harbours T helper cell epitopes that enhance the immune response particularly for small antigens, like peptides. Virosomes loaded with different antigens can be combined to formulate a multi-component subunit vaccine, making them a versatile and modular antigen delivery system with an excellent tolerance and safety profile in children, adults and elderlies, based on experience with the market approved influenza and hepatitis A virosome-based vaccines. 20 In this study, recombinant PfCyRPA expressed in mammalian cells was lipidated and incorporated into the membrane of human-compatible influenza virosomes. The virosomal formulation without adjuvant and with surface display of recombinant PfCyRPA was used to immunise mice and rabbits to determine its immunogenicity and capacity to elicit parasite binding and inhibitory antibodies capable of blocking erythrocyte invasion in vitro and in vivo.",

While NMRI mice had low-avidity anti-PfCyRPA IgG antibodies after the first immunisation, respective to BALB/c mice, a five-fold increase of the mean avidity index was observed after the third immunisation (Fig. 1f) . In BALB/c mice, the avidity after the first immunisation was already markedly higher than in NMRI mice, and consequently only a gradual increase of the mean avidity index over the course of immunisation was observed (Fig. 1e) . Induction of P. falciparum blood stage cross-reactive IgG upon immunisation with PfCyRPA virosomes was analysed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) with sera collected after the third immunisation. All immune sera of both mouse strains were cross-reactive with PfCyRPA expressed by blood-stage P. falciparum schizonts, as detected in immunoblot analyses with parasite lysate. A representative example is shown in Fig. 2a . While immune sera from NMRI mice bound consistently to the blood-stage parasites in IFA (Fig. 2b) , immune sera from BALB/c mice yielded weaker and inconsistent immunofluorescence staining signals.",

Protein subunit vaccine approaches typically require co-administration of strong adjuvants or effective antigen delivery systems such as virus-like particles to overcome the poor immunogenicity of recombinant proteins. Here we tested a monovalent candidate malaria vaccine based on the recombinant PfCyRPA target protein displayed on the surface of influenza virosomes, representing virus-like particles approved for use in humans. While in this first study unadjuvanted PfCyRPA influenza virosomes were tested, adjuvanted human-compatible formulations are under development that may offer the advantage to have both antigens and adjuvants bound to the same particle with no free-form adjuvant, improving the immunogenicity and safety profile of the vaccine. The concept of using antigen-loaded influenza virosomes for vaccination against malaria in humans has already been clinically validated with a virosomal formulation incorporating optimised peptidomimetics derived from the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and the apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1). 19 This bivalent virosomal vaccine candidate demonstrated excellent safety, immunogenicity and pilot efficacy in a Phase 1b trial in African children. 21 Antigen delivery using influenza virosomes enables the design of multivalent vaccines, as different populations of antigen-loaded virosomes can be combined. This is an important prerequisite, since it is generally assumed that a highly effective malaria subunit vaccine has to target antigens of several developmental stages of the parasite.",

Results confirmed that pre-immunisation of the rabbits with inactivated influenza virus is not a prerequisite for the induction of antibodies against heterologous antigens on virosomes and that pre-existing influenza immunity does not prevent antibody induction. 22 IgG avidity maturation, indicative for memory B cell formation, was evidenced by an increase in anti-PfCyRPA antibody avidity over the course of immunisations. Besides antibody fine-specificity and binding avidity, recently also the kinetic parameters for antibody binding to its target emerged as a key indicator of potency for merozoite neutralising antibodies. The ability of recombinant human anti-PfRH5 mAbs generated after vaccination with viral vectored PfRH5 to inhibit parasite growth in vitro correlated with antibody association-rates. Moreover, one anti-PfRH5 mAb without neutralising activity potentiated the activities of other inhibitory antibodies indirectly, by slowing down the invasion time of merozoites and thereby increasing the time window for inhibitory antibodies to act. 23 The PfCyRPA vaccine-induced parasite-binding IgG antibodies, confirming that virosomes presented the lipidated recombinant PfCyRPA protein in its native conformation to the immune system. After having established that vaccine-induced antibodies bound to the endogenous PfCyRPA protein expressed in the invasive stage of the parasite blood-stage cycle, we conducted in vitro GIAs with blood-stage parasites cultured in human red blood cells. This analysis compares invasion and growth of parasites in the absence and presence of antibodies. Although validation of the antibodymediated GIA as a correlate of protection in humans has been difficult to establish, this assay has been commonly used to select and prioritise blood-stage vaccine candidates for final preclinical and clinical development. Purified total IgG preparations of all PfCyRPA-immunised rabbits showed substantial and dose-dependent GIA activities. At a concentration of 5 mg/mL total IgG, 50-85% growth inhibition was observed with all rabbit IgG samples. While the small number of animals per group limits statistical interpretation of the results, higher mean activities were observed in rabbits that received three doses of antigen-loaded virosomes. The mean total IgG concentration giving 50% GIA for rabbits that received three vaccine doses was 0.94 mg/mL total IgG. This value lies within the broad range of GIA IC 50 values (between 0.38 mg/mL 17 and 5.07 mg/mL 24 ) that have been reported for total IgG generated by immunising rabbits with Immune sera of mice were tested for parasite binding in IFA with in vitro cultured P. falciparum blood-stage parasites.

We adopted the improved P. falciparum infection mouse model for the assessment of the efficacy of antibodies against blood-stage antigens in passive immunoprotection experiments. 7 Antibody transfer experiments in this in vivo model demonstrated dosedependent and reproducible growth-inhibitory effects of mouse mAbs specific for the blood-stage vaccine candidates PfCyRPA and PfRH5. 7, 10, 16 In the present study, humanised NSG mice were passively immunised with purified total IgG from individual rabbits that received three vaccine doses of antigen-loaded virosomes. One day after the antibody transfer, mice were infected with P. falciparum 3D7 parasites.

Individual filter stripes of each blot derived from the same experiment and were processed in parallel. d Immune sera of rabbits were tested for parasite binding in IFA with in vitro cultured P. falciparum blood-stage parasites.

The concentration of total rabbit IgG in the circulation of the passively immunised mice that received 10 mg of total IgG, was estimated to be 1.23 mg/mL one day after administration (the day of infection) and 0.29 mg/mL at day 7 (the day of the measured final parasitemia). These concentrations were from the beginning of the parasite challenge much lower than the concentration of IgG in normal rabbit serum, which ranges from 5 to 12 mg/mL. Considering in addition the relatively quick in vivo clearance of the rabbit antibodies, while the parasite keeps replicating, the inhibition of parasite growth is remarkable. The PfCyRPA-specific IgG is expected to represent only a small fraction of the total IgG. In previous passive immunoprotection experiments with parasite inhibitory monoclonal antibodies, administration of 2.5 mg inhibitory anti-PfCyRPA or anti-PfRH5 mAbs was required to achieve a maximal parasitemia reduction of about 90%. 10, 16 An even higher reduction of parasite burden (95% inhibition) was observed in the mouse model when 2.5 mg inhibitory anti-PfCyRPA and 2.5 mg inhibitory anti-PfRH5 mAbs were injected in combination. 16 Taken together, these results demonstrate that recombinantly expressed PfCyRPA delivered on human-compatible influenza virosomes was immunogenic in preclinical animal models and induced strong growth-inhibitory antibodies against P. falciparum blood-stage parasites that were functional both in vitro and in vivo. Recombinant PfCyRPA thus represents a highly suitable highly conserved antigen candidate component for inclusion into a multivalent virosomal malaria vaccine, with excellent cross-strain inhibitory potential.",
