            "text": "Objective: SPAG5 plays an essential role in cell cycle progression. In this study the molecular and clinicopathological functions of SPAG5 was investigated. Method: A series of 171 BC was evaluated for SPAG5 gene copy number (using aCGH) and mRNA expression (using GEA). The expression of SPAG5 protein was evaluated in BC and OCV cell line and in 1650 primary BC. The association between SPAG5 and response to CT was investigated in three independent datasets: 350 ER-BC treated with adjuvant ATC-CT, 250 BC treated with neoadjuvant (NEO-A)-ATC-CT, and 200 primary OVC treated with cisplatinum. Results: 5 % of BC showed amplification of SPAG5 locus at 17q11.2. SPAG5 mRNA expression displayed a significant correlation with its copy number. In BC, SPAG5+ was associated with aggressive phenotypes (p<0.0001) and poor survivals (p<0.0001). Anthracyclin CT had a positive impact on clinical outcome of SPAG5+ BC (p < 0.0001). SPAG5+ BC received NEO-A-ATC based CT achieved 38 % pathological complete response (pCR) and SPAG5 protien expression was confirmed as an independent predictor for pCR (p=0.001). Similarly, SPAG5-OVCs were resistant to platinum (p<0.001) and independently associated with poor survival (p<0.001). Conclusion: SPAG5 is an important novel gene implicated in the survival of BC & OVC cells and its protein expression is an independent predictor for CT.",

Beca * , E. Rios, P. Pontes, I. Amendoeira * Centro Hospitalar de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Anatomic Pathology, Porto, Portugal Objective: One-step nucleic acid amplification assay (OSNA) from Sysmex\u00ae is an automated system to detect sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in breast cancer patients. This assay is based on the detection of cytokeratin 19 mRNA amplification by reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification. Traditionally intraoperative evaluation of SLN is accomplished by cytology and/or frozen section, accounting for heavy workload to pathology department. The objective of this study is to compare the OSNA assay with our standard processing for intraoperative SLN evaluation. Method: 82 SLN from 45 patients with CK19+ and invasive primary carcinomas where simultaneously evaluated by cytology and/or frozen section and by OSNA assay. Results where compared with gold-standard definitive H&E evaluation (serially sectioned at 150 \u03bcm intervals). Results: The sensitivity and specificity of OSNA assay was 92.3 % and 98.2 %, respectively with a positive predictive value (PPV) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 96 %. For standard intraoperative evaluation, specificity was 100 % and sensitivity was 73.0 %. Conclusion: OSNA assay showed similar specificity and higher sensitivity than standard pathologic examination. These findings suggest it can be used as an accurate tool for intraoperative evaluation of SLNs metastasis and possibly contribute to reducing the need for re-intervention for axillary lymph node dissection. Objective: Antracycline-based chemotherapy represents a standard of care in breast cancer patients especially who overexpress HER-2. Topoisomerase 2A has been considered a molecular target for antracyclines and its co-amplification with HER-2 genes has been proposed. In our study we investigated if Topoisomerase 2A overexpression can be used as a molecular marker on predicting response to antracycline-based chemotherapy.",

The expression of topoisomerase 2A has been correlated to response to chemotherapy. Results: Our results show that TOPO2A expression is significantly higher in neoplasms with larger size, nodal metastasis, scant ER end PR receptors, and amplification of HER-2 gene (p < 0,00, T-test). Cancers in witch high level of TOPO2A has been found exhibit a better clinical response to treatment with anthracycline (p <0,0000, T-test). Therefore TOPO2A expression could be considered both as predictive and prognostic marker. Conclusion: The employment of TOPO2A as a predictive marker in clinical practice may be useful for the medical therapy of non-endocrine-responsive patients candidate to undergo treatment based on anthracycline, that is no free from adverse effects as cardiomyopathy and leukemia.",

Genetic characterization of stem cell (CD 44, ....) in this type of carcinoma might provide important data concerning origin and evolution. Data of the literature focused specifically on TNBC but, despite the interest shown to stem cells recently, there are no data concerning the genetic characterization of stem cells in the context of cell biology of TNBC as compared with associated DCIS. Method: We investigated, through immunohistochemistry, the expression and distribution of several stem cell/related antigens, exploring the association of TNBC with DCIS and comparing the presence of stem cells in the invasive and in the in situ component. Results: The multiplicity of parameters to be detected for characterising stem cells and of the diagnostic materials that are available would prevent a straightforward approach and a sequential combination will have to be planned. Conclusion: Optimization of detection, identification and characterisation of tumourigenic breast cancer stem cells might permit further identification of targeted treatment.",

The overgrading and undergrading rates on CB were 1 % and 37 %, respectively. Main causes for undergrading in CB were underestimated MA (40 %) and a combination of underestimated NP and MA (32 %). Conclusion: Whereas overgrading on CB is an exception, undergrading derives largely from underestimation of proliferation.

More animal models are needed for human mammary tumour research. Our objective was to describe equivalent non-neoplastic and neoplastic mammary gland alterations in woman and dog. Method: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archived human and canine mammary gland tissue samples. Epidemiological data were collected and analyzed from human (n= 1935) and canine (n=161) patients for the years 2003-2005. Histological comparison was performed with HE-stained tissue sections and immunohistochemistry. Applied antibodies included CK5/6, ER\u03b1, PR, Ki67, Her2, p63, SMA, Ecadherin and calponin. Results: Several comparable benign and malignant mammary gland alterations were identified, consisting of lobular, tubular and ductal as well as mesenchymal of origin. Most of these have not been described previously. The epidemiological results show also shared characteristics. Conclusion: Although there are canine specific lesions there also exist equivalent entities. Our results indicate the female canine as a suitable model for translational research.",

We analyzed the influence of different proliferation assessment methods on the BC subtype distribution. Method: Intrinsic subtyping was performed according to the St. Gallen criteria on 225 BCs. Proliferation was assessed by Mitotic Activity Index (MAI) (area: 1,59 mm\u00b2, cut-off \u226510) and by several variants of Ki67-Labeling-Index counting any nuclear staining of (1) 100 tumor cells within the hot spot (Ki67-100), (2) 1020 tumor cells in 3 HPF in the tumor periphery, including the hot spot (Ki67-1020periphery), and (3) 1020 tumor cells in 3 HPF, including hot spot, cold spot and an intermediate area (Ki67-1020spectrum) using the recommended cut-off of <14 %. Results: Of 225 carcinomas, 10 % were Triple-negative, 2 % Her2+, 6 % Luminal B Her2+, and 9 % Special Type. The rates of BCs after different proliferation assessment methods were: MAI 49 % vs. 24 %; Ki67-1020spectrum: 34 % vs. 39 %, Ki67-1020 periphery: 24 % vs. 49 % and Ki67-100: 10 % vs. 63 %. Conclusion: Subtyping of Luminal A and Luminal B Her2neg BCs according to St. Gallen 2011 is highly influenced by the method of proliferation assessment used. Its biological relevance seems to be not unequivocal.",

It assesses the whole lymph-node in a 20-minutes protocol. Many studies have reported it to be more sensitive than frozen section and/or cytology. Yet, it is more expensive and takes longer to perform. Method: Between 2010 and 2012 at CHLC, we have performed the intraoperative analysis of sentinel lymph-node using both OSNA and cytological smears in a group of patients. Results: 35 lymph-node evaluations were done. 16 cases were OSNA positive (5 micrometastasis and 11 macrometastasis). Of those, 11 were also positive for tumor cells on cytological smears. 19 cases were negative by both methods and 5 cases were detected by OSNA but not on cytological smears. Importantly, all macrometastasis diagnosed by cytology were confirmed by OSNA. Of notice, in this series, 69 % of the positive cases detected by OSNA were also detected by cytological smears. Conclusion: Like previously reported, OSNA showed a greater sensibility than cytology to diagnose sentinel node metastasis. However, the majority of metastasis can be detected by cytological smears alone. Our results suggest that a less expensive and faster cytological analysis should precede OSNA, and if positive, the latter method could be disregarded. Tuesday, 11 September 2012, 17.00-19. Objective: Tumor markers may be concentrated intraductally in early breast cancers. Method: To test this hypothesis, HER2-ECD and CA15-3 of the needle washout fluid from 29 benign lesions, 26 DCIS, and 95 invasive carcinomas of the breast were measured using chemiluminescence. The measuring limit for HER2-ECD (0.5 ng/ml) and that for CA 15-3 (4 U/ml) were used as the cutoff values, respectively. Results: The proportion of patients with any biomarker elevation was 6.9 % in cases of benign lesions, 46.2 % in DCIS, and 15.8 % in invasive carcinomas. Thus, biomarker elevation was most frequent in DCIS, followed by invasive carcinomas (P<0.01). HER2-ECD values over 6 ng/ml or CA 15-3 values over 25 U/ml were s een exclusively in DCIS or invasive ductal carcinomas with an extensive intraductal component, supporting the hypothesis. Conclusion: Our approach may be useful to identify a subset of breast cancer patients who are suitable for intraductal molecular targeted therapy.",

Results: 53 % of the cases showed high Ki67-LI (>13 %) and 12 % showed HER2 over-expression and both were positively associated with younger age, higher tumour grade, lymph node stage and shorter outcome. Both markers were associated with up-regulation of ER-coactivators (CD71, CARM1, PI3KCA&TK1), P-cadherin, p53 and with lower levels of ER expression and down-regulation of ER-related genes (PgR, AR&GATA3) and BRCA1. Neither of the two markers was associated with expression of basal-associated cytokeratins. High Ki67-LI was associated with down-regulation of luminal enriched markers including luminal cytokeratins, MUC1, GCDFP-15, FHIT, and transcription and differentiation ERrelated genes (FOXA1 and TFF3). In contrast, HER2 expression was associated with up-regulation of luminal cytokeratins, GCDFP-15, FHIT and E-cadherin. Conclusion: Unlike high Ki67-LI, HER2 overexpression is not associated with the down-regulation of luminal enriched genes. Increased growth fraction in ER + tumours may be driven by different mechanisms in HER2+&HER2-disease.",

            "text": "Objective: Drosha is a protein that plays a key role in the biogenesis of microRNAs which are well known to be deranged in human breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that Drosha is significant in the development and progression of breast cancer and has clinical relevance as a potential predictive and prognostic target. Method: We have examined Drosha protein expression, using microarray and immunohistochemistry, in a well-characterised series of unselected invasive breast cancer patients (n=750) with long-term follow-up and documented expression characteristics for a large range of biomarkers of known relevance in breast cancer. Furthermore, a smaller cohort of selected breast cancer cases (n=24) was also investigated for differential Drosha protein expression in distinct stages of tumour progression, including in situ (DCIS), invasive and metastatic components. Results: Drosha cytoplasmic and nuclear expression was lost with cancer progression, and was associated with loss of BRCA1 expression. Multivariate statistical analyses showed that Drosha cytoplasmic expression was an independent predictor of breast cancer specific survival, tumour recurrence and metastases. Conclusion: Drosha cytoplasmic expression in breast cancer is an independent predictor of patient outcome, tumour recurrence and metastasis. These observations imply that alterations in mechanisms of miRNA regulation can influence tumour behaviour. Objective: Determination of proliferation in breast carcinomas is highly prognostic and can have treatment implications. However, there is no consensus on issues such as counting area or cut-off values. Our aim was to examine and compare Ki-67 counts in various tumor areas, the novel mitosis marker PHH3, and standard mitotic count. Method: We examined a nested case-control series (n= 190) as part of the population-based Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program. Mitotic count (mitosis per mm2) was assessed on H&E-sections. The percentage of Ki-67 positive nuclei among 500 tumor cells was recorded for both hot-spots (HS; highest proliferation) and cold-spots (CS; lowest proliferation). PHH3 counts (per mm2) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Results: The upper quartiles for Ki-67-HS, Ki-67-CS, PHH3 and mitotic count consistently showed the strongest associations with known unfavorable tumor features (high histologic grade, ER negativity, HER2 positivity, CK5/6+, P-cadherin+). Univariate survival analysis showed comparable prognostic strength of Ki-67-HS, PHH3 count and mitotic count. In multivariate analysis, mitotic count was the strongest prognostic factor among these. Conclusion: By upper quartile, Ki-67-HS, PHH3 and mitotic count all showed strong associations with various tumor features. In multivariate survival analysis, mitotic count was the strongest proliferation marker. Objective: Ki67 LI is a good marker of breast cancer prognosis. We aimed at comparison of performance of 5 Ki67 antibodies. Method: 283 breast cancer cases were retrieved. Immunohistochemical staining for 5 Ki67 clones (30-9, B56, MIB1, polyclonal, SP6) performed in TMA-s in automated immunostainer. Evaluation performed on digital slides utilizing linear 0-10 frequency score. Objective: In breast cancer, classification systems are used to assess pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Biomarkers are still needed to better predict the efficiency of primary systemic therapy. Dysregulation of connexin (Cx) channels (gap junctions) is involved in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Method: We have correlated Cx expression and the pathological response in neoadjuvant treated breast cancers. Fifteen of the 21 human Cx isotypes were pre-screened. Cx26, Cx32, Cx43 and Cx46 were found widespread and tested in tissue microarrays of 96 breast cancers prior to and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Pathological response was characterized according to the EWGBSP, CPS-EG, Miller-Payne, Sataloff, and NSABP classification systems. Results: Only the CPS-EG classification had prognostic relevance by score 1-2 cases presenting better overall survival (p=0.015) than those scoring 3-5. Cx43 levels prechemo correlated with hormone receptor status pre-and post-chemo and had inverse correlation with HER2 levels pre-chemo. Reduced Cx26 expression (<5 %) post-chemo correlated with better overall survival (p=0.011). Moderate or higher Cx46 expression (>20 %) pre-and post-chemo was also associated with better survival in the EWGBSP TR2b (ppre=0.006), Sataloff TB (ppre=0.005; ppost=0, 029) and Miller-Payne G3 (ppre=0.002; ppost=0.012) subgroups. Conclusion: Classifications combined with testing for Cx46 and Cx26 expression can improve prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer.",

Method: Data from all patients were retrieved from the files of the European Institute of Oncology (EIO), Milan. Histopathological review of all cases was carried out. Results: All patients were women (median age: 58 year, range: 36-81 year). Median lesion size was 0.5 cm (range: 0.3 to 1.1 cm). Median latency interval from radiation to AVL diagnosis was 49 months (range: 17 to 124 months). 62.5 % of cases presented as an erythematous unique papule confined to superficial/middermis with proliferation of thinwalled, vascular channels, lined by a single layer of bland endothelial cells. No prominent nucleoli, mitoses or blood lakes were seen. Patches of chronic inflammatory infiltrate accompanied all AVL. One patient (4.2 %) developed local recurrence, and two patients (8.3 %) developed angiosarcoma in the previous biopsy site, 19 and 89 months later. Margin involvement was associated to unfavorable outcome. Conclusion: Our data suggest that post-radiation AVL and angiosarcoma may represent a spectrum of the same disease process. The development of local recurrence and subsequent angiosarcoma indicate that AVL must be completely excised, with free surgical margins, and patients must be accompanied by clinical exams and imaging. Objective: Gastric dysplasia is classified as gastric/foveolar and intestinal/adenomatous according to morphological (architectural and cytologic) features. The immunophenotypic classification of dysplasia, based on the expression of mucins and CD10, recognizes three major types: gastric (MUC5AC and/or MUC6); intestinal (MUC2 and/or CD10); hybrid (gastric and intestinal markers). CDX2 is a transcription factor responsible for early intestinal differentiation. ALDH1 is recognized as a stem cell marker in several organs. Method: Nineteen cases of dysplasia were classified as gastric/foveolar (n=8) or intestinal/adenomatous (n=11) and graded as low-grade (n=9) and high-grade (n=10). Immunophenotypic classification showed gastric (n=5; 26 %), intestinal (n=6; 32 %) and hybrid (n=8; 42 %) phenotypes. Results: Cases classified by morphology as gastric/foveolar-type displayed gastric (50 %) or intestinal (50 %) immunophenotype, whereas intestinal/adenomatous-type cases displayed gastric (9 %), intestinal (55 %) or hybrid (36 %) immunophenotype (p=0.023). High-grade dysplasia was identified in cases with gastric (80 %), intestinal (17 %) and hybrid (63 %) immunophenotype (p=0.085). CDX2 expression was significantly lower (p=0.044) in gastric (60 %) than in intestinal and hybrid immunophenotypes (100 %). ALDH1 expression was displayed only in gastric (80 %) and hybrid (50 %) immunophenotypes (p=0.023). Conclusion: Gastric dysplasia is heterogeneous and morphology is insufficient to elucidate cell differentiation. High-grade dysplasia, decreased CDX2 expression and high ALDH1 expression are associated with gastric immunophenotype.",

To date it has not been reported in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). We assessed the presence and prognostic importance of tumor budding in PDAC. Method: Whole-tissue sections of 120 PDACs with full clinico-pathological and follow-up information were stained with pancytokeratin. Tumor budding was assessed in 10 high-power fields (HPFs) by two pathologists and considered high-grade (HG) when an average of >10 buds was counted. Measurements were correlated to the patient and tumor characteristics. Results: Inter-observer agreement was strong (ICC=0,72). HG-budding was found in 70.3 % of cases and was linked to advanced pT-stage (p=0.0463), lymphatic invasion (p=0.0192) and decreased disease-free and overall survival (p<0,0001 and p=0,0005). There was no association with pN, pM, R-stage or vascular invasion. In multivariate analysis the prognostic effect of HG-budding was independent of lymphatic invasion, pN and R-stage [p<0,0001, HR (95 % CI)=3,65(2,1-6,4)]. Conclusion: Tumor budding occurs frequently in pancreatic cancer, is an indicator of worse outcome and adds independent prognostic information. Routine use of tumor budding would help to better stratify patients into prognostic subgroups.",

Method: We treated P2X7R knockout mice to induce acute colitis (3 % DSS) or colitis associated colon cancer (AOM and DSS). Results: We showed that P2X7R KO mice are more resistant than wild type mice to a DSS-induced colitis. Further, we demonstrated that P2X7R KO mice are highly susceptible to inflammation driven colon tumorigenesis. In addition, we showed that tumors from P2X7R KO contained more neutrophils (CD11b+/Ly6G + cells) and less macrophage (CD11b+/Ly6G-) than tumors obtained from WT mice.

Method: Immunohistochemical expression of RKIP was assessed in 100 colorectal cancers using whole tissue sections. Four different areas were evaluated using 10 highpower-fields (HPFs) each: normal mucosa, tumor center, invasion front and tumor buds. The average expression for each zone was assessed for its clinical relevance. Results: Expression of RKIP was diffuse in normal mucosa and progressively lost towards the tumor center and front (26 %, 15 % and 8 % RKIP-positivity, respectively; p<0.0001). Only 3 % of tumor buds were RKIP-positive. RKIP loss in the tumor center only corresponded to more frequent lymph node positivity (p=0.0766), distant metastases (p=0.0243), lymphatic invasion (p=0.0533) and more advanced TNM stage (p=0.0278). RKIP loss was highly prognostic (HR (95 % CI): 0.45 (0.2-0.9); p=0.0288) independently of TNM and therapy. Conclusion: The clinical relevance of RKIP is restricted to the tumor center where it acts as an independent prognostic factor. Its absence in tumor buds provides further evidence to support their hypothesized metastatic potential.",

The overall survivals and disease free survivals were compared in terms of variables such as tumor regression grade, stromal response in tumor bed, state of lymph node metastasis, and the localization of the tumor in between patients treated with chemoradiation and the control group. Neoadjuvant treatment is one of the treatment modalities in rectal carcinomas. We want to present our experience between 2005 and 2011 in our institution.

So far, there is no reliable tool to identify mVI prior to surgical procedures. MALDI Imaging Mass Spectrometry (IMS) represents a new analytical tool to provide the relative abundance and distribution of the whole proteins expressed in a tissue section. The aim of this study was to compare, using MALDI IMS, the tissue proteome of HCC without and with mVI in order to identify surrogate biomarkers of mVI. Method: A total of 56 HCC samples obtained from surgical specimens, for which frozen samples were available, were retrospectively collected. Two groups of tumors were defined (26 HCC without mVI; 30 HCC with mVI) and were analysed by MALDI IMS. A statistical comparative analysis of acquired mass spectra was then performed in order to identify protein peaks differentially expressed between the two groups. Results: 30 protein peaks were differentially expressed between the two groups, all overexpressed in HCC with mVI. Protein characterization of some of these peaks is in progress. Conclusion: These results highlight the potential of MALDI IMS to uncover new biomarkers in liver carcinogenesis. The identification of mVI biomarkers would be helpful in the therapeutic strategy of patients with HCC.",

Method: We retrospectively enrolled 110 patients (276 total neoplastic or necrotic nodules) who received TACE for HCC downstaging before OLT. The following data were collected: number of neoplastic/necrotic nodules, microscopic thrombosis, the residual neoplastic tissue (RNT), and dysplastic nodules.

Pathological diagnosis is important for the prediction of prognosis and adjuvant treatment. Study aim was to identify histopronostic factors in a consecutive series of patients treated by RCT and surgery. Method: 113 patients were included, follow-up, tumor morphologic pattern and Modified Rectal Cancer Regression Grade (m-RCRG) were assessed. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to assess predictors of disease-free survival (DFS). Results: 5-years DFS was 58 %. In univariate analysis, ypT, budding, calcifications, circumferential margin, node involvement, invaded margin, vascular emboles and perineural involvement were pronostic factors (p<0.05). In multivariate analysis, presence of calcification in tumor bed (p=0.027) and small circumferential margin (p=0.037) were the only two independent factor of worse DFS. mRCRG was not correlated to DFS. Among the 50 mRCRG1 tumor, DFS was significantly better in patient with ypT0 than in other ypT stages (p=0.003). Conclusion: Presence of calcification in tumor bed is a new major histopronostic factor described for the first time in rectal cancer. Our results raised the question of whether ypT stage or histological tumor regression is more important in the prediction of patient prognosis.",

Objective: The most widely used system for histological grading of colorectal cancer (CRC) is based on the degree of gland formation, despite significant interobserver variability and low prognostic value. Herein we analyzed the prognostic significance of a grading system based on the presence of poorly differentiated clusters in stage I CRC. Method: Poorly differentiated cancer clusters were assessed by two independent pathologists in stage I CRC characterized or not by disease progression. Tumors with <5, 5 to 9, and >10 clusters were classified as G1, G2, and G3, respectively. The prognostic value on disease-free survival and the association with other clinicopathologic characteristics of the conventional and novel grading systems were analyzed. Results: K statistics for inter-observer variability in the assessment of histological grade based on poorly differentiated custers was 0.728 (good). High histological grade assessed with the novel system, but not with the traditional one, represented a negative significant prognostic factor for disease-free survival and it was significantly associated with venous invasion, lymphatic invasion, budding, invasive growth and nodal micrometastases. Conclusion: We suggest that a tumor grading system based on the number of poorly differentiated clusters has a stronger power to stratify stage I CRC patients by prognostic outcome than conventional grading.",

Method: In 70 CRC, randomly selected, we performed immunohistochemical stains with CK20 and CK7 and analyzed the microsatellite status and BRAF mutations with real time PCR. Results: From the 70 CRC, 15 were MSI and 55 MSS (microsatellite stable) cases. 90 % of MSS cases diffusely expressed CK20 without CK7 expression. From the 15 MSI cases, 6 presented BRAF mutations. In MSI cases with BRAF mutations, CK20 was focally expressed or negative and CK7 was diffusely expressed.

Here, we further elucidate the potential clinical role of ITB in pre-operative biopsies using pan-cytokeratin stained tissues and a quantitative scoring system. Method: 139 pre-operative biopsies from patients with colorectal cancer underwent immunohistochemistry for pancytokeratin (AE1/AE3). ITB were counted in the area of densest budding (40\u00d7) and classified as high-grade when >10 buds/HPF were observed based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: High-grade ITB occurred in 26.6 % of cases and was associated with right-sided tumor location (p= 0.0356), more advanced pT (p =0.0198) and pN (p< 0.0001) classifications, distant metastasis (p = 0.0164), higher tumor grade (p=0.0037) and lymphatic invasion (p=0.0445). The specificity and positive predictive value for lymph node metastasis was 86.7 % and 75.6 %, respectively. Disease-free survival was significantly worse in patients with high-grade ITB (5-year survival=25 %) in comparison to patients with low-grade ITB (5-year survival= 55 %) (p=0.0157). Conclusion: The assessment of ITB in pre-operative biopsies is predictive of local and distant metastasis in corresponding resections and should be considered in daily management of colorectal cancer patients.",

Method: An analytically validated rabbit monoclonal antibody immunohistochemistry (IHC) in vitro diagnostic (IVD) for assessing the degree of hENT1 expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma using an automated IHC platform has been developed. Results: Using primary tumor samples (n=201) from a randomized controlled clinical adjuvant trial (RTOG 97-04), we developed and verified a hENT1 scoring methodology and cut-off for identifying patients least likely to benefit from Gem (hENT1-low). The distribution of hENT1 expression was similar between these samples and an independent set of 130 pancreatic adenocarcinoma specimens from the AIO-PK0104 study of which 77 were confirmed metastatic biopsies. Overall, using this cut-off, approximately two thirds of pancreatic tumors displayed low-hENT1 expression across the different data sets. Conclusion: A robust hENT1 IHC IVD has been developed using a rabbit monoclonal antibody and identifies two thirds of primary and metastatic PDAC cases as having low expression of hENT1.",

Aim-To evaluate the early activation of PSC in case of hypoxia in normal human pancreas. Method: An organotypic culture model of thick sections of human pancreas has been developed and validated. Slices of pancreas (300 \u03bcm) were prepared from surgical specimens and cultured in hyperoxia conditions. Half of the samples underwent an initial phase of culture in normoxia (21 % O2) to reproduce hypoxia. The total duration of culture was 72 h. Cell viability, hypoxia, apoptosis and activation were monitored. Results: 30 sections per specimen were cultured. Analysis was performed at baseline, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Morphological analysis showed gradual appearance of ductal/acinar dedifferentiation. At 72 h, foci of necrosis were identified. Hypoxia was confirmed by the expression of HIF1 and CA9 at 48 h (10 % and 50 % of labeled cells). Apoptosis was limited, acinar cells expressed caspase 3 at 48 and 72 h. Analysis of proliferation using Ki67 index showed significant activation of PSC at 48 h (\u00d75/baseline) and at 72 h (\u00d76/ baseline). Activation of PSC was confirmed by smooth muscle actin immunochemistry. Conclusion: Organotypic culture of normal human pancreas is possible with optimized cell viability at 72 h. Hypoxiainduced activation of PSC occurs very early. Objective: IPN are still poorly characterized precursor lesions of bile duct adenocarcinoma. We present a multicenter study with focus on morphology, subtyping and prognosis and provide a detailed molecular analysis in the stepwise progression from low-grade to high-grade lesions and invasive carcinoma. Method: Fourty-five patients with biliary IPN were included into the cohort, twenty-two patients with conventional adenocarcinoma of the bile duct served as control cohort. Subtyping was performed based on histomorphology and expression profile of mucins and cdx2 expression. Furthermore, low grade lesions (n=14), high-grade lesions (n=38) and invasive components (n=13) of IPN as well as conventional bile duct adenocarcinomas (n=22) were investigated individually for alterations of common oncogenic pathways using immunohistochemistry, real-time polymerase chainreaction and direct sequencing. Results: IPN are mainly detected at preinvasive stage (71 %), pancreato-biliary and intestinal type are the most common subtypes (36 and 29 %, respectively). Detailed molecular analysis showed that p53 overexpression, k-ras mutation, loss of heterozygosity of p16 locus and nuclear \u00dfcatenin expression are early events and loss of smad4 and overexpression of EGFR and HER2 are later events in the tumor progression of IPN. Conclusion: Stepwise alterations of common oncogenic pathways are required for progression of biliary IPN from non-invasive precursors to invasive carcinoma.",

RAC1b, a RAC1 spliced variant, is overexpressed in CRC and impairs apoptosis by activation of nuclear-factor-KB. We evaluated if RAC1b was an independent prognostic factor in mCRC. Method: We examined BRAF (V600E) mutational status, RAC1b by immunohistochemistry, RAC1b/RAC1 expression ratio by mRNA RT-PCR, and mismatch repair (MRR) deficiency by microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis, in 186 mCRC patients treated in firstline therapy with FOLFOX or CAPOX from three Spanish institutions. We assessed whether these biomarkers were independently predictive of progression free survival (PFS) or OS. Results: 7 % CRC had BRAF mutations, 5 % MSI-H, 20 % high RAC1b/RAC1 ratio, and 25 % RAC1b protein overexpression. Five of 11 CRC (46 %) with BRAF mutations had high RAC1b/RAC1 ratio/protein vs 25/144 (18 %) without BRAF mutation (p=0.036). All BRAF mutated or RAC1b/RAC1 high were MSS. Low RAC1b/RAC1 ratio and BRAF WT had higher response rate (68 % vs 43 %; p= 0.035). Multivariate regression analysis identified ECOG PS as a significant variable for PFS and LDH levels, PS and high RAC1b/RAC1 ratio for OS. Conclusion: High RAC1b/RAC1 expression ratio or immunoexpression constitutes a marker of poor OS and a potential marker of acquired chemo-resistance in mCRC treated with oxaliplatin-based therapy. Objective: Annually more than 120.000 new cases of papillary thyroid cancer, that is 1 % of malignant tumors, are registered all over the world. Method: There are clinical and morphologi\u0441al methods: immunohistochemistry (MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, TIMP-2), light, transmission, electron, probe and scanning microscopy with the trace element analysis. It was studied 1541 cases of thyroid cancer since. Results: At the papillary thyroid cancer progression matrix metalloprotease and specific tissue inhibitors of metalloprotease (TIMP-2) increased in the cytoplasm of tumor cells, but the concentration of TIMP-1 decreased. Tumors with low degree of ultrastructural differentiation were presented by cells with electron-dense dark cytoplasm and cells with poor cytoplasm organelles and differently formed nucleus with numerous deep invaginations. High level of some matrix metalloproteaseexpression (\u041c\u041c\u0420-9) and low level of TIMP expression (\u0422IMP-1) were observed in current cases more (45 % and 58 % respectively), than at more differential papillary thyroid cancer (23 % and 37 %). At performance of atomic force microscopy it was shown that connection between cells had become weak at the decreasing of malignancy degree. It was revealed the significant increasing of oxygen, magnium, potassium, calcium in tumor nodes. Conclusion: Conducted comlex morpho-chemistry analysis display diagnostic patterns of papillary thyroid cancer. Objective: Cytological features of BTN-PH, sometimes interpreted as papillary carcinoma (PC) on fine-needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB), have not been studied extensively. Method: Available material from 48 BTN-PH was reviewed retrospectively and compared with 15 PCs. Results: FNAB diagnoses were: non-diagnostic (n=1), benign (n=18), AUS/FLUS (n=10), suspicious for follicular neoplasm (n=4), suspicious for malignancy (S-PC) (n=13), and malignant (P-PC) (n=2). The extent of papillary hyperplasia on histology was higher in S-PC/P-PC diagnostic categories (50 %; P=0.019; range: 5-90 %). On cytology, papillary structures, present in 53 % of BPN-PH cases, were more frequent and numerous in the S-PC/P-PC group (89 %; P= 0.0093). Focal nuclear atypia was seen in all S-PC/P-PC cases, including rare grooves (87.5 %), enlargement/crowding (75 %), chromatin clearing/rare pseudoinclusions (25 %), but were less than in PCs (P<0.0001). Nuclei were smaller in BTN-PH than in PCs (mean diameter/range (\u03bcm): 8.2/6-12 vs 14.2/7-26; P=0.0001). All BTN-PH tested (n=9) were immunonegative for HBME-1, galectin-3, and keratin-19. Conclusion: BTN-PH diagnosed as S-PC/P-PC often show papillary structures and focal nuclear features of PC but they are significantly less than in classical PCs, stressing the need to apply strict criteria for PC diagnosis.",

Multiple micro-and a few macrotumors are found on the background of a hyperplasia of glucagon cells. The disease may cause unspecific abdominal symptoms and only rarely a glucagonoma syndrome. Recently a mutation in the glucagon receptor (GCGR) gene was described in one GCA patient. Method: The extracted DNA of five patients with GCA was sequenced and the GCGR gene analyzed for mutations. Results: Sequencing of the GCGR gene revealed germline mutations in three out of five patients. One patient shows two different heterozygous point mutations in the hyperplastic alpha cells as well as in the non-tumorous tissue leading to two premature stop codons. One patient harbors a homozygous stop mutation. The third patient shows two homozygous missense mutations of the GCGR gene that most likely also led to a dysfunction of the GCGR. In the two other patients no germ line mutations of the GCGR gene were detected. These variants were not identified in healthy subjects. Conclusion: The finding of germ line and somatic \"loss of function\" mutations of the GCGR gene in three of five patients with GCA suggests that a change in the signalling function of the GCGR may cause glucagon cell adenomatosis via glucagon cell hyperplasia.",

We assessed the impact on clinical behavior in PTC of TIMP-1, HIF-1\u03b1 and the hypoxia-inducible CAIX and CAXII. Method: The protein expression was assessed by Western blot in two cell lines, TPC-1/BRAFWT and BCPAP/ BRAFV600E. TMA-immunohistochemistry analysis was used to study protein expression in 114 PTC samples. BRAF status was analyzed by pyrosequencing. Data were correlated with clinicopathological variables of patients. Results: Higher expression of all proteins was detected in BCPAP exposed to hypoxia. TIMP-1 expression displayed 87 % sensitivity and 83 % specificity for identifying BRAF mutation (P<0.001), and was associated with pT-stage (P= 0.001), pN-stage (P= 0.02), and multifocality (P=0.03). HIF-1\u03b1 expression was correlated to pT-stage (P=0.05). CAIX expression was related to pN-stage (P=0.02), and both CAIX (P=0.004) and CAXII (P=0.05) were highly associated with vascular invasion. Conclusion: TIMP-1 protein expression is reliable surrogate of BRAF mutated status in PTC. TIMP-1 and hypoxiaregulated proteins have potential for future use as predictors of the malignant change in PTC, and warrant further investigation as new therapeutic targets for the treatment of highly aggressive form of PTC. Objective: MTC are usually aggressive tumours which account for 3-5 % of all thyroid carcinomas. Most of MTC are sporadic, the remaining tumours are due to hereditary forms with germline activating mutations of the RET proto-oncogene. The aim of this study was to assess the microRNA profiling expression in both sporadic and hereditary forms of MTC. Method: A total of 40 frozen MTC from patients with welldocumented clinico-pathological parameters were used for microarray analyses (14 HMTC and 26 SMTC) using Human MicroRNA Mircoarray Kit version 2 (Agilent Technologies). After identification of a set of miRNA of interest, validation was done using qPCR. Results: When comparing HMTC harbouring germinal RET mutation with SMTC, seven miRNAwere significantly deregulated (miR-96, \u221210a, \u2212376c, \u221215a, \u22127-2*, \u2212106b, \u2212132). The most highly discriminative miRNA in tumoral samples (>3 fold change) identify miR-375, \u2212129-3p, \u2212136, \u2212376c and \u2212451. Moreover, 5 miRNA could segregate MTC with good prognosis and better clinical outcome (miR-137, \u2212144, \u2212224, \u2212144 and \u2212224) . Conclusion: A specific microRNA signature in HMTC can be identified. Moreover, detection of microRNAs in tissue samples might be of interest for improved clinical management and treatment of patients with MTC.",

It remains however a problematic entity. Some consider that the encapsulated FVPTC (enFVPTC) have an excellent prognosis like follicular adenomas (FA); others showed that enFVPTCs had potential for hematogenous spread like follicular carcinoma. Its place in the spectrum the multivariate Cox regression the FLT3-ITD mutation (p= 0.001) was an independent poor prognostic factor, whereas the goodness-of-fit of the Minkowski fractal dimension an independent favorable prognosticator (p=0.025). The karyotype had no influence on survival. Conclusion: FLT3-ITD and chromatin fractal characteristics were more important as prognostic factors for overall survival than karyotype and gene methylation status. Financial Support: FAPESP and CNPq. Objective: The prevalence of Cyclin D1 (CyD1) positive Bcells with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) phenotype in the mantle zones of reactive lymph nodes (\"in situ\" MCL/MCLIS). and related minimal MCL infiltrates in reactive lymphoid tissues of healthy individuals and in MCL patients are unknown. Method: All 1.292 reactive lymph nodes from unselected consecutive surgical specimens of 131 patients without a history of lymphoma obtained over a 3 months\u00b4period were stained for CyD1. Additionally, all morphologically reactive lymph nodes and extranodal lymphoid infiltrates of MCL patients from 2000 to 2011 were studied. Samples predating the lymphoma diagnosis for at least 2 months were available from 37/423 (8.7 %) patients. Results: A MCLIS was not identified. However, in four MCL patients, an early manifestation of MCL with mantle zone growth pattern was detected retrospectively, antedating the lymphoma diagnosis for 3-86 months. In six MCL patients, only small groups of CyD1 positive cells in morphologically reactive extranodal infiltrates were detected more than 2 months before the diagnosis of MCL (range 3-59 months). Conclusion: MCL \"in situ\" is an extremely rare phenomenon in morphologically reactive lymph nodes. In MCL patients, however, immunohistochemically detectable infiltrates of MCL cells antedating the lymphoma diagnosis were found in a significant proportion of cases (10/37=27 %).",

In different tumors E2F1 can demonstrate opposing roles, acting either as an oncogene or as a tumor suppressor gene. Method: We have previously established E2F-1's immunohistochemical expression in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and its correlation with p53 expression, although no relationship with either proliferation or apoptosis was demonstrated. A further investigation in a larger series of 100 cases of primary HL with the addition of new apoptotic techniques and the use of p21 expression as an indicator of p53 functional status was undertaken. Results: Following stratification of our cases based on p53 functionality, E2F-1 was inversely correlated with the proliferation marker TopoIIa. Independently of p53, high levels of E2F-1 expression showed a linear trend with apoptosis and an inverse trend with proliferation (borderline p value in both cases). Conclusion: Both E2F-1 and p53 activity is upregulated in HL, however it seems that p53 status is a major regulator of the relationship between E2F-1 expression and tumor growth. Alternatively, E2F-1 may use p53-independent pathways to induce apoptosis. Objective: PTLD represent a spectrum of usually EBV-driven lymphoplasmacytic proliferations in the settings of immunodeficiency associated with allograft. EBV infects cells in latent or lytic forms. Although viral oncogenes are expressed in latency programs, lytic EBV replication is required to develop lymphomas in mouse models. The role of intratumoral EBV replication in PTLD has never been addressed before. Method: A series of 35 PTLD was reviewed and EBV latency genes were explored in all cases and included EBER1-2, LMP1 and EBNA2. Moreover, two early lytic genes involved in EBV replication, BZLF1/ZEBRA and EAD11 were also analyzed. All clinical and pathological data were collected. Results: The median age was 50 years (27-77) with a male predominance (26 M: 9 F). EBV infection was observed in 28 cases (80 %). EBV replication was observed in 40 % of the cases. These were more likely to be polymorphic PTLD with latency III in the context of stem cell transplantation. Moreover these cases had atypical clinical presentations such as brain involvement or disseminated disease with aggressive behavior (OS: 11 months vs. 48 months). Conclusion: EBV replication occurs in tumor cells of PTLD-patients associated with poor outcome and may be share common morphological and phenotypical features. In routine praxis, their differential diagnosis might represent a challenge requiring a specific work-up of immunohistochemical (IHC) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses. Method: Paraffin sections from 17 CD20+/CD5+ blastic B-NHL were examined for cyclin-D1, CD10, bcl-6 and MUM-1 IHC expression together with FISH method using probes for CCND1 rearrangement and/or IGH/CCND1 translocation. The final diagnosis was established according to the criteria of WHO classification. Results: 11/17 cases were diagnosed as bMCL showing cyclin-D1 positivity and CCND1 rearrangement, other analysed IHC markers were negative. Five of these cases were polyploid. 6/17 cases were diagnosed as CD5+ DLBCL in spite of coexpression of cyclin-D1 in 2 of them, as they showed various CD10, bcl-6 and MUM-1 expressions and missed CCND1 gene rearrangement. Conclusion: Cyclin-D1 positivity may appear in other than MCL lymphomas due to changes at transcriptional or posttranscriptional level. In spite of overlaping phenotypes, FISH analysis of CCND1 represents an effective tool to increase the diagnostic accuracy to distinguish CD5+ DLBCL from bMCL.

Kamar\u00e1dov\u00e1 * , M. Nova, M. Kalinova, V. Campr * Prague, Czech Republic Objective: Still's disease (or systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, SOJIA) is a systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by fever, rash, and arthritis. It has a peak of incidence in early childhood with rare occurence in adulthood (adult-onset Still's disease, AODS). Several other symptoms as hepatosplenomegaly, leukocytosis and lymphadenopathy may be associated possibly mimicking malignant lymphoma. Method: We present two cases of Still's disease associated lymphadenopathy in a child and in an adult simulating morphologically peripheral T-cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma respectively. Results: Histological, immunohistochemical and molecular examination revealed non-neoplastic lymphadenopathy with atypical paracortical T-cell hyperplasia with immunoblastic reaction in the former and burnt-out histiocytic pattern in the latter, both falling into a broad spectrum of reactive lymph node changes associated with Still's disease.",

The second and the third pattern may closely resemble malignant lymphoma. Extended and careful clinical examination with relevant laboratory findings and possible complex histochemical and molecular analysis are necesarry to rule out the suspition of lymphoma. Objective: Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is a rare form of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma characterized by exclusive or preferential intravascular growth. IVLBCL often goes clinically unrecognized. We report three clinically unsuspected cases of classic variant IVLBCL. Method: Cases diagnosed as IVLBCL were collected from the pathology files of Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital. The diagnosis was reviewed in agreement with WHO 2008 criteria and immunophenotypic and clinical data were gathered. Results: A 71-year-old male and an 87 year-old-male showed neurological symptoms leading to progressive deterioration and death. A 79-year-old female presented with fever of unknown origin and died 2 days after admission. At autopsy there were no gross findings suggestive of a neoplastic process in any instance. Histologic study showed intravascular large B cells with vesicular nuclei involving predominantly the central nervous system in the first two cases and the adrenal glands, liver, and spleen in the third case. Conclusion: The three cases of aggressive, advanced-stage lymphoma herein described illustrate how the clinical diagnosis of IVLBCL remains elusive due to its low frequency and variegated clinical presentation and how the pathologic diagnosis of IVLBCL continues to be highly dependent on autopsy examination.",

Method: The National Renal Transplant Registry from 1991 to 2000 (inclusive) was cross referenced with the National Cancer Registry to identify renal transplant recipients who had developed PTLD up to the present day. Review of Pathology and chart review was conducted for each case. Results: Of 2,441 patients (2,667 allografts), 34 cases of PTLD were identified, with pathology review possible in 33 cases.

These two primary locations have for long -and HPV-associated carcinomas have recently -been associated with the clinical situation of cancer of unknown primary (CUP). Method: To investigate the relationship between HPV and CUP in detail, we studied 26 consecutive patients who initially presented as CUP and were finally diagnosed with carcinomas of these two locations. Results: Twenty-one carcinomas (81 %) proved to be positive for high-risk HPV (p16 and polymerase chain reaction). They were frequently very small (smallest: 0.3 cm; 6 cases: \u2264 0.6 cm; on average 0.9 cm) and located in a deep, submucosal position. Conclusion: This demonstrates an overrepresentation of HPV-associated carcinoma in patients who were initially diagnosed with CUP, supporting a strong causal relationship between HPV-association and CUP. The frequent manifestation as CUP presumably is caused by the unusual predisposition for small size and submucosal location, combined with frequent and early lymphatic metastization. In order not to miss these small, clinically occult carcinomas, consequent interdisciplinary cooperation and meticulous histological work-up is mandatory.",

Results: Low MTAP mRNA expression was found in 32 % of cases, associated with MTAP gene deletion in 70 % (p< 0.001) but not to MTAP promoter hypermethylation, indicating that in this tumors gene deletion is the main mechanism of MTAP inactivation. Neither low mRNA expression nor gene deletion was associated with any of the clinicopathologic parameters investigated.

Badoual * HEGP, Dept. de Anatomie-Pathologie, Paris, France Objective: ECC1 enzyme has been associated with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of ERCC1 expression with p16 and Ki-67 as predictive and prognostic markers in the response to platin-based induction chemotherapy in patients with head and neck carcinoma (HNSCC). Method: 208 patients treated from 2000 to 2006 by an induction chemotherapy regimen for HNSCC were included retrospectively. We assessed response to treatment, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: 68 % and 81.5 % of HNSCC showed low expression of 8 F1 and FL297 ERCC1. No correlation was found between the two clones (p=0.1). In the 129 patients treated with cisplatin-5FU chemotherapy, a low expression of 8 F1 ERCC1 was associated with a better response (p=0.027). Over expression of p16, (34.5 % of cancers of the oropharynx) was correlated with a better OS (p=0.0007) and a better PFS (p=0.01). Conclusion: These results suggest that ERCC1 expression might be a useful predictive marker of HNSCC in patients treated by cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The 8 F1 ERCC1 clone appears to be the best for immunohistochemistry. Our study confirms the prognostic value of the over expression of p16 in carcinoma of the oropharynx. Objective: Tumor-stroma ratio or proportion of tumor (PT) has been presented as a prognostic factor in colorectal and breast adenocarcinomas, but there is no information about squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and laryngeal carcinomas in particular. Method: Eighty-five laryngeal carcinoma cases were included in this series. Five digital images of the tumor sections were obtained (H&Ex20). Percentage of epithelial tumor component was determined by software allowing the pathologist's selection of tiny areas as carcinomatous and stromal region for statistical analysis as a prognostic marker. Results: Median follow up was 48 months (range 3-194). The mean PT was (48,63+18,18) . There was no difference for PT when tumor grade and stage were considered. Although statistically insignificant, the mean PT was the lowest (37,46+12,49) for subglottic carcinomas and cases with perinodal invasion (44,72+20,23), and highest in pN0 cases (50,05+17,34) but there was no statistical significance. The over all and disease free survival analysis did not reveal significance for PT. Only pathological stage was an independent factor for over all survival (p=0,08).",

The ameloblastoma is a benign but locallyinvasive odontogenic neoplasm with distinct behavioural characteristics of its subsets. Whether angiogenesis contributes to a more aggressive course in these variants remains unclear. The aim here was to determine and compare the tumoral microvasculature in different ameloblastoma subtypes and to speculate on their significance. Method: Immunohistochemical staining for 4 vascular markers (CD31, CD34, CD105 and VEGF) was performed on archival tissues of 40 cases solid/multicystic (SMA), 20 unicystic (UA), 3 desmoplastic (DA) and 14 recurrent ameloblastoma (RA). Mean microvessel density (MVD) at the tumour advancing front and centres were obtained. Results: VEGF was heterogeneously expressed in the tumoral epithelium in all ameloblastoma subtypes. Protein localization was membranous/cytoplasmic. Mean MVD was slightly higher in SMA compared to UA but the difference was not significant (P>0.05). Mean MVDs were not significantly different between primary and recurrent ameloblastoma; and between tumoral centre and advancing front of each subtype (P>0.05). Conclusion: Although ameloblastoma subtypes are distinctive in their clinicopathologic presentations and behaviour, their tumoral microvasculature is not different. This suggests that angiogenesis is not a major factor influencing the progression of these ameloblastoma subsets.",

            "text": "Objective: Non-sebaceous lymphadenoma (NSLA) is a recently described, rare benign salivary tumour composed of lymphoid and epithelial components, definitionally lacking sebaceous differentiation. Method: Nine cases of NSLA were immunohistochemically stained for CK5/6, CK7, CK14, CK18, p63, and Ki67. Results: All tumours (6 males, 3 females, mean age 50 years) were located in the parotid gland and showed intimate intermingling of lymphoid tissue with islands of epithelium with a wide spectrum of histological differentiation. The immunohistochemical profiles mirrored the epithelial differentiation; tumours with basaloid or lymphoepithelial differentiation strongly expressed CK5/6, CK14, p63, while tumours with ductal differentiation showed strong positivity for CK18/CK7 and CK5/6/CK14/p63 in luminal and basal cell layers, respectively. A hilus structure with salivary inclusions or D2-40 (podoplanin) positive marginal sinus were identifiable in 4 and 9 of the cases, respectively, confirming origin within intra-/periparotid lymph nodes. Six cases were initially misdiagnosed as other benign (n=4) or malignant (n=2) tumours. Conclusion: Our study provides strong evidence that NSLA belongs to the group of salivary tumours that pathogenetically develop from embryonic salivary inclusions in intra-/periparotid lymph nodes. Knowledge of the wide histological spectrum of this rare tumour is important in order to avoid misdiagnosis.",

Bell * * MD Anderson Cancer Center, Dept. of Pathology, Houston, TX, USA Objective: MEC typically arises from major/minor salivary glands. Intraosseous salivary carcinomas are extremely rare (2-3 % of all MECs reported). The t(11; 19) and its CRTC1/ MAML1 fusion transcript have been identified in MEC at different sites and are associated with development of a subset of these tumors. We report 9 examples of central MEC of the mandible, including a case with a history of primary retromolar MEC. Method: RT-PCR and DNA sequencing analyses used to study microdissected components of 9 central MEC and 1 noncentral MEC. Of the central MEC tumors, 5 arose from ectopic salivary rests; others appeared to be of glandular odontogenic origins. Results: We identified CRTC1/MAML1 in 5 central MEC arising from ectopic salivary rests. This fusion transcript was not detected in non-central MEC or in another 4 central MEC arising from a glandular odontogenic etiology. Conclusion: Central MEC can manifest the fusion transcript in a subset of central MEC originating from ectopic salivary rests, and may have diagnostic/histogenetic roles in the future analysis of this entity, given the absence of the fusion transcript in MEC with glandular odontogenic precursors. Since the initial clinical and radiological diagnosis in three central low-grade MECs was a benign odontogenic cyst, our findings support a future role for the fusion analysis in initial diagnostic efforts.",

Rjabceva * Minsk, Belarus Objective: An evaluation of morphological and imunohistochemical features of salivary duct carcinoma (SDC). Method: 15 cases SDC were retrieved from tumor archives collected at Belarusian Cancer Centre from 2002 to 2011 years. Immunohistochemistry, FISH. Results: A man to women ratio was 10:5; median age 61,5 years (average . Tumors arose in the parotid (n=13), submandibular (n=2) glands. SDC developed from pleomorphic adenoma (n=3) or de novo (n=12), there were foci of ductal carcinoma in situ (n=4), sialodochodysplasia (n=4) and Pagetoid spread (n=1) additionally to usual features of SDC. As well, tumors demonstrated acinic cell carcinoma-like (n = 2) and micropapillary growth patterns (n=1), oncocytic (n=4), clear cells (n=3), apocrine (n=1) and mucinous (n=1) changes. Immunohistochemically, tumors were characterized by AR-expression (n= 9), Her2/neu overexpression (n=7), of them score 2+ in 2 cases. CK8 and S-100 positivity, STAT5 negativity was detected in one case with acinic cell carcinoma-like pattern. Foci of SDC in situ were highlighted by CK14 and calponin. Amplification of c-erb2-gene was found in 1 case, ETV6/NTRK3 gene was not identified in acinic cell carcinoma-like SDC. Conclusion: Salivary duct carcinoma, like breast cancer, is characterized by wide variability of morphological patterns and immunohistochemical features reflecting possible molecular heterogeneity, which need further investigation. Sunday, 9 September 2012, 17.00-19. Objective: Quantification of protein expression based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) is an important step for translational research and clinical routine. However, routinely used eyeballing scoring systems are time-consuming and subject to significant intra-and interobserver variability. Aim of our study was to explore, whether an image analysis software proves sufficient as an alternative tool to assess protein expression. Method: 630 prostate cancer specimens were stained with one nucleus specific marker (i.e., ERG), one cytoplasmic specific marker (i.e., SLC45A3), and one marker expressed in both compartments (i.e., TMPRSS2). A pathologist visually quantified all stainings, applying a four-step scoring system. For digital quantification, an image analysis software (Tissue Studio v.2.1) obtained a continuous spectrum of staining intensity. Results: For each of the three antibodies we found a strong correlation of the eyeballing protein expression score and the score of the image analysis software (correlation coefficient of 0.94, 0.92, and 0.90 for ERG, SLC45A3, and TMPRSS2, respectively, p<0.01). Conclusion: Our data suggest that Tissue Studio is a powerful tool for the quantification of protein expression in IHC stainings. Further, since the digital analysis is precise, it might help to overcome intra-and interobserver variability and increase objectivity of IHC based protein assessment.",

Method: Histological and cytological preparations are the basis for pathological diagnosis performed in daily practice throughout Europe in a number of several millions per year and correctness and reproducibility of such diagnosis are heavily dependent on the technical quality. Yet, quality is variable in different places and countries, related to school level, technicians' dedication, standard of apparatuses and reagents. Variation in technical quality of the preparations prevents their open circulation at European level and precludes optimal diagnosis. Results: The TASTE project tackles these problems by building-up an ICT environment TASTE System where professionals from different countries will submit, via Web, \"virtual slides\" of their own preparations to a panel of internationally recognized experts who will give comments and suggestions on the quality of the preparation. Conclusion: The present approach (unprecedented at world level) will fuel a Web-based community, aimed to a levelling and improvement of histopathological and cytopathological preparations, thus leading to an innovative training and more reproducible diagnosis, a basic requisite for disease treatment.",

In order to utilize this knowledge it is necessary to analyse this records in a structured way. In our use case the starting point were approximately 1.4 million pathological findings of a non-selected patient group. Method: We developed software tools for the classification of medical records using a phonetic a multi-level spell correction module and an ontology term extraction and decision tree text classification system. With the help of a visual editor a comprehensive decision tree (4174 nodes) was set-up by a team of bioinformaticians and medical experts. Results: With our tool set we achieved in the ICD-10 classification a F-Score of 89,7 % (precession 83,2 % and recall 97,5 %) For the interpretation of the classification results we developed visualization tools and applied the whole software suite at several test cases, e.g. the analysis of a colon data-set with 216.000 findings over 28 years. Conclusion: We developed an automatic classification and visualization system and applied the results in a series of research projects.

An online repository of easily searched, well-categorized pathology images can be of immense use to pathologists, scientists, educators, and students. Method: Individuals and institutions all over the world have accumulated collections with thousands of slides representing a huge variety of pathologies. Some collections are digitized and available online, while others remain libraries of glass slides, with a variety of formats for case information and other metadata. Working with collectors to publish their slides and aggregating them together can yield an amazing decision support resource. Results: Long-term archival storage is a key issue for organizations adopting ePathology. A cloud-based repository can provide an inexpensive and scalable solution. ePathology is increasingly used for remote consultations. Cases managed by online consultation networks can be de-identified and contributed to a common repository, increasing the value of the decision support tool while providing a long-term archive.

However, interpretation of pathomorphological findings is often subjective, and pathology publications show only a limited number of photographs. Because pathomorphological changes occur in succession, we attempted to construct PD spectra to improve PD accuracy. Method: PD spectra are defined as the series of pathomorphological images arranged in the order of disease progression or cell cycle procession. The images from the whole slide imaging (WSI) server were arranged in order in Power Point files at a fixed magnification, and 4 PD spectra were constructed: chronic hepatitis staging, nuclear grading of hepatocellular carcinoma, nuclear grading of breast cancer, and Ki-67 labelling index (LI). The numbering of all images in the PD spectra corresponded with that of the WSI images so that the whole slides could be viewed alongside. Next, these tools were tried out by 6 people. Results: These tools brought on perfect accuracy with regard to staging and grading, and very high precision of Ki-67 LI for breast cancer. Conclusion: PD spectra are valuable not only for PD but also as learning tools and have a worldwide applicability for measuring PD online.",

In this study we evaluated, if color correction can be achieved by histogram transfer depending upon control tissue image (CTI) differences. Method: Images from colon and placenta sections stained by anti-CD34 were used as CTI and/or sample tissue images (STI). Thirty-four but one (standard stained slide with images sCTI and sSTI), was stained for different durations and dilutions than the standard procedures. Digital images taken by a CCD camera connected to a light microscope without normalization was stored at a computer. Software was prepared in order to find the histogram difference between two CTIs and transfer the difference to the STI for achieving a corrected STI (corSTI). sSTI (one image) and STI and corSTI (34 images each) were semiquantitatively scored by two observers in blind fashion and the STI and corSTI scores were compared with sSTI score. Results: The wKappa was 0,59 for two observers. The STI semiquantitative score was same as the sSTI in 23,5 % of the STI but this was 76,35 % for corSTI. Conclusion: It seems histogram transfer depending upon CTIs may be a valuable tool for color correction of tissue section images. Sunday, 9 September 2012, 14.15 -16.15 Objective: There is a crucial need for identification of markers to choose the best treatment schedule and monitor the effectiveness of treatment in metastatic melanoma (MM) . The detection of circulating tumor cells (CTC) correlates with prognosis in different cancer subtypes. CTC can be detected by direct and indirect methods such as cytopathological approach, RT-PCR or immunomagnetic separation using the CellSearch (CS) method. Method: From June 2011 to December 2011, blood was drawn from 27 patients with MM and 10 controls patients and processed into 72 h by the CS method. The primary end-point was the overall survival (OS) of MM patients. Results: Enumeration of at least 1 CMC was effective in 61.5 % of patients with MM (n=16) and in 20 % of controls patients (n=2). Nine patients (35 %) had \u2265 2CMC. None of the controls patients had more than one CMC. Mean OS time was 5.6 months among patients with MM and <2 CMC (n=8) and mean OS time was 1.7 months among patients with MM and CMC \u22652 (n=26) (p=0.002). Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that detection of CMC correlates with OS in melanoma. Thus, CMC monitoring should be developed to ensure the best treatment follow-up for patients with MM.",

Method: Forty-nine patients with locally advanced HNSCC were included. The presence and number of CTCs were determined using the CS system in all patients prior to the initiation of therapy, in 21 patients 3 months after treatment, and in 10 healthy individuals. Results: The CS system was able to detect the presence of CTCs in 8 of 49 patients (16 %) before therapy and in 4 of 21 disease-free patients (19 %) after therapy. No CTC was found in the control group. When considering the presence of CTCs before or after therapy, the presence of CTCs was statistically associated with patients' age (p=0.04; t-test) and N-stage (p=0.02; Fisher's exact test). Conclusion: CTCs are identified in a relatively low proportion of patients with locally advanced HNSCC and correlated with initial lymph node involvement.

Its increased activity has been associated with many cancers including colorectal cancer (CRC). To investigate the significance of IGF2 in CRC, normal tissue and tumor biopsies from 400 patients were analyzed and correlated with clinical outcome and the KRAS and PIK3 status. Method: The IGF2 820 G/A gene polymorphism and imprinting status were examined by restriction fragment length polymorphism of DNA derived from normal tissues and tumors then of RNA from heterozygous cases. IGF2 protein analysis as well as an RNA microarray were performed. Results: 41 % of the analysed cases were heterozygous. LOI was detectable in both normal tissues and tumors in 60 % of cases. Tumors with LOI had significantly higher IGF2 protein levels. Gene expression analysis revealed significance of cell cycle progression and mitosis genes in LOI. Conclusion: IGF2 LOI is a common and early change in patients with CRC and in normal tissues, provides possibly a preneoplastic change. However increased IGF2 protein levels as well as a different cell cycle specific gene expression profile were detected in tumors with LOI. Future studies must be performed to find out, whether such subsets of tumors differ in their response to chemotherapy or alternative therapies. Objective: Novel high-throughput technologies has revealed numerous genomic abnormalities in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). This study aimed to detect point mutations involving EZH2 and CD79B in a population of B-cell NHL by applying a multiplex mutation assay to minimal residual material from needle aspirates, and to determine the evolution of their mutational status overtime using all sorts of available samples from these patients. Method: DNA was extracted from residual cytological material stored on FTA\u00ae Cards as well as from archived cytological and histological specimens. The presence of point mutations was investigated by a specifically developed assay utilizing MassARRAY spectrometry and confirmed by direct sequencing. Results: All 121 samples from 80 B-cell NHL cases were successfully analyzed. Mutations in EZH2 (Y641) and CD79B (Y196) were detected in 13.2 % and 8 % of the samples, respectively. Mutational status varied in one third of the positive cases, with either gain or loss of mutations over the course of time. Conclusion: Minimal material from lymph node fine needle biopsy is a reliable source for high-throughput multiplex analysis for the detection of point mutation involving EZH2 and CD79B. Whenever possible, the most recent sample should be tested to verify the current status of the disease.",

However, about 10 % of BL cases lack an identifiable MYC rearrangement, although no significant difference of MYC expression among cases has been observed. Additional mechanisms alternative to translocations were explored by microRNA profiling. Method: Ten MYC translocation-positive and ten MYC translocation-negative formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded BL specimens were used for this study. For microRNA and gene expression profile, the samples were hybridized on the miRCURY\u2122 LNA Array and the Illumina DASL whole genome Assay, respectively. Results: Our results identified a panel of four microRNAs which are differentially expressed between the two groups. Importantly, these microRNAs control relevant biological processes, such as the angiogenesis, apoptosis and cell proliferation, according to Gene Ontology categories. Furthermore, the impact of microRNA dysregulation on the gene expression pattern identified genes which more likely are regulated by the selected microRNA. Conclusion: Using this approach, we showed a clear-cut microRNA and gene signature between MYC translocationpositive and negative BLs. The identification of specific altered microRNAs may represent an alternative molecular mechanism leading to MYC over-expression in the absence of genetic alteration in cancer.",

However, a recent study showed that in 2-3 % of all cancers a single catastrophic event, termed chromothripsis, can lead to massive genomic rearrangements confined to one or a few chromosomes. Method: In order to explore whether the degree of genomic instability and chromothripsis would influence prognosis in cancer, we applied high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization to 20 malignant melanomas (MM) that were, despite comparable conventional clinical and pathological parameters, defined by a profoundly different clinical course. Results: We observed a striking association between both number and structure of chromosomal aberrations and outcome. MM associated with good prognosis showed only few chromosomal imbalances (average 1.6 alterations per case), predominantly presented as whole chromosome or chromosome arm gains and losses. MM with poor prognosis harbored significantly more chromosomal aberrations (13.9 per case; p=0.008). These aberrations were mostly focal events, which culminated in two cases in a pattern consistent with chromothripsis. Conclusion: Here, we describe for the first time the phenomenon of chromothripsis in primary MM and reveal a link between focal copy number alterations and chromothripsis with poor outcome in MM patients (p=0.0002), providing a genetic approach to predict outcome in histopathologically indistinguishable MM.",

This study aimed at investigating if HDACs interact with the PI3K signaling in ESS pathogenesis and thus might serve as targets for ESS therapy. Method: Tissue microarrays were used to determine HDAC expression in ESS specimens. Western blots revealed protein expression levels of HDACs and PI3K related molecules in two independent ESS and one control cell lines (ESS-1, MES-SA and HESC). Results: Elevated HDAC1 and 2 levels were found in ESS tissues and cell lines. Increased cell growth and Akt/mTOR cascade hyperactivation were detected in ESS cells. SAHA reduced growth of all cells, and induced cell death in ESS cells. SAHA reduced phosphorylated 4EBP1 in all cells, but only inhibited activation of Akt and p70S6k in ESS-1 cells. Conclusion: HDACs are linked to PI3K signaling during ESS pathogenesis. SAHA reduced cell growth via inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR components suggesting that a combination of SAHA with PI3K inhibitors might be effective in treating ESS.",

Method: Fresh surgically resected NSCLC specimens were addressed from the human biobank hospital (Nice) to the animal facilities (Sanofi, Vitry-sur-Seine). Shipment was performed in AQIX medium at room temperature. Within 24 h post surgery, tumour fragments (~63 mm3) were subcutaneously implanted in female SCID mice. The growing tumours were passaged in new mice (\u226410 passages). The xenografts were histologically checked to eliminate human or murine lymphoma. Results: Overall, 98 NSCLC samples were implanted leading to 32 (33 %) NSCLC xenografts. The rate of tumour growth was higher in non-adenocarcinoma specimens (23/45; 51 %): 20/38 (53 %) for squamous cell carcinoma, 2/4 (50 %) for large cell carcinoma, and 1/3 (33 %) for pleomorphic carcinoma, when compared to adenocarcinoma samples (8/51; 16 %).

Method: On a rat model of experimental tumorigenesis using BP6 fibrosarcoma cells injected intraperitoneally, we performed a semiquantitative analysis of the recruitment of MF in the tumor compartment (microenvironment) as well as in peripheral blood. Results: We observed a slow increase of MF count in the initial phase of tumor growth followed by a slow decrease in the late phase within the tumor compartment. Simultaneously peripheral blood showed constant increase throughout the experiment resulting in typical leukocytosis accompanying developed tumors. Conclusion: Increased MF in the initial phase could reflect their enrollment to \"prepare a suitable microenvironment for tumor seeding\". Their decrease began after the tumor size was macroscopic, thus it was time for them to carry out a \"different job\". In the mean time their amount in peripheral blood started becoming significant, this is also the time when tumor -host interactions reach a systemic level. In futher experiments we will attempt to verify our assumption: When the tumor flourish in the host organism, it uses informed, transformed and recruited macrophages for growth and building construction of the tumor, and for communication with distant organs on a regulatory level.",

Biomarker prioritization included: 1) Expression Barcode 2.0; 2) filtering using differential expression analysis. Candidate genes were validated by qRT-PCR on RNA from paraffin embedded samples (RNA-PES) of BE patients with high-grade dysplasia/ADC diagnosed during surveillance and of their index endoscopy dysplasia-free samples. As controls, we used samples from BE patients who have not progressed. Results: Under conservative criteria, we identified 19 upregulated genes that distinguish EA-progressed from nonprogressed BE samples. A second filter, followed by qRT-PCR validation, trimmed the candidates to 2 markers (WWTR1 and CYR61). qRT-PCR on time-series RNA-PES of EA-progressed and EA-free BE samples showed these genes are up-regulated years before the development of EA as compared to patients who did not developed EA.

The reagents were introduced on a semi-automated platform, HistoFlex, which has a precise temperature control unit and utilizes continuous liquid flow. Results: By combination of miR-21 ISH and PDCD4 immunofluorescence we found differential expression in many but not all miR-21 positive cells.

Recently, the detection of synthesis and secretion of immune mediators by tumor cells highlighted TNF-superfamily (TNFSF) members as key counterparts of cell fate-related signals. Here, we assayed the synthesis-expression-function of a subset of TNFSF ligands and receptors (BAFF, APRIL, BAFFR, BCMA, TACI) in normal epithelial tissues and tumors and resident adult mesenchymal stem cells. Method: Tissues (breast, CNS, kidney, skin, adipose tissue) have been assayed by means of immunohistochemistry and Real-Time PCR. Cell models were used for signaling, transcriptomics and functional assays. Results: All tumors expressed this TNF-SF subset. BAFFR is absent, while its specific ligand BAFF is ubiquitously expressed; contrairewise, APRIL, BCMA and TACI are expressed in tissue-specific manner. APRIL relays on tumor evolution/grade and is involved in tumor proliferation/differentiation/apoptosis signaling through NF\u03baB-related, or a novel pathway, implicating JNK/FOXO3A/GADD45, triggering transcriptional events. Conclusion: Autocrine/paracrine effects of APRIL and its receptors BCMA and TACI in normal/tumoral parenchyme and the recruitment/attraction of immune-related cells could orchestrate tissue response, regulating cell fate, differentiation, inflammation, tissue remodeling and cancer, with potential tailored-therapy application. Objective: Mutation analysis of KIT and PDGFRA genes is currently used in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) as an important step in diagnostic protocol. Method: DNA samples obtained from parafin-embedded biopsy material of 278 GIST patients diagnosed in 2004-2011 were screened for mutations in exons 9, 11, 13 and 17 of KIT and 12, 14 and 18 of PDGFRA. Results were tested for associations with clinical parameters of the tumor. Results: Causal mutations (according to in silico analysis with PolyPhen-2 predictor) were identified in 83.8 % of patients, most frequently in KIT exon 11 (62.95 %). The KIT exon 9, PDGRFA exons 18 and 12, KIT exon 13, PDGFRA exon 14 and KIT exon 17 mutations appeared with frequencies 8.3 %, 7.6 %, 2.5 %, 1.4 %, 1.1 % and 0.0 % resp. Genotype-phenotype correlation analysis revealed statistically significant association between intestinal localization of tumors and presence of KIT exon 9 p.503-504_dup2 mutation and gastric localization of tumors and presence of PDGFRA exon 18 p. D842V mutation. Conclusion: Centralized and standardized GIST diagnosis offers clinically and prognostically relevant informations and is necessary for the indication of appropriate targeted therapy of GIST patients.

Objective: An association between cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene mutations and infertility may occur. This study investigated the frequency of mutations in the CFTR gene, of a group of consecutive patients candidate for assisted reproductive techniques with the aim of identify subjects carriers of the most severe ones. Method: We screened 11208 healthy subjects (5943 females and 5265 males) for 56 CFTR gene mutations and IVS8-poliT polymorphism utilizing the CFTR INNO-LiPA Amplification kit including both general and Italian regional strips. Results: CFTR mutations were detected in 6.2 % of the patients, a percentage similar to that reported in the general population. The most common mutation was \u0394F508/N observed in 0.9 % of patients. No difference in the gender distribution was evidenced. In the large group of patients analyzed 87.7 % were wt, 11.8 % carrier of one mutation, and interestingly 0.5 % compound heterozygous. Conclusion: Our data support the relevance of an accurate determination of mutations in the CFTR gene in order to inform the couple of their carrier risk and the possibility on having affected child. Moreover our findings highlight the potential of genetic screening as a tool to identify possible compound heterozygous subjects without CF-like symptoms. Objective: A patient's response to cancer treatment can depend on their biomarker status. Therefore it is important that laboratories perform their biomarker tests well. In 2009 an international external quality assessment scheme for KRAS mutation analysis on FFPE slides was set-up. Method: This scheme was run for 3 years by the coordination center, a medical and technical expert and scheme organizers under the umbrella of ESP. Participants received 10 samples. Genotype results were analyzed and labs with good performance were listed on the ESP website. Written reports of 2011 were evaluated in detail. Results: In 2011, 79 % of participants identified all samples correctly. Results seemed to improve over the years from 9.49/10 to 9.62/10. Genotype results from laboratories that participated for 3 years appeared to improve overtime, although this couldn't be statistically proven. In the reports some important elements weren't always present. For example, the patient's name was only present in 80 %, correct HGVS nomenclature in 90 % and interpretation of results in less than 40 %. Conclusion: KRAS-EQA probably facilitates improvement of laboratory testing. The quality of reports of KRAS tests needs to be improved. A guideline for reporting molecular pathological results would be a good instrument for both participants and assessors. Objective: Microsatellite instability (MSI) due to mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency is reported in a fraction of colorectal cancers (CRCs) (5-10 %) complicating IBDs (IBD-CRCs). Our recent findings argued for the existence of yet unknown mechanisms underlying MMR-deficiency in IBD-CRCs, different from those involved in sporadic and hereditary MSI CRCs. Here we hypothesized that over-expression of miR-155 and miR-21, two inflammation-related miRNAs that target core MMR proteins, could constitute a mechanism underlying MMR deficiency in IBD-CRCs. Method: We compared the expression of both miRs in IBD-CRCs and non-IBD hereditary or sporadic CRCs using nonneoplastic IBD and healthy mucosa samples as controls.",

Conclusion: miR-155, alone or synergistically with miR-21, may favor the emergence of MSI IBD-CCRs. Since its deregulation was not limited to neoplastic tissues but extends to non-neoplastic normal mucosa as well, the hypothesis of a miR-155 field defect promoting MMR deficiency and yet MSI-driven transformation can be proposed.",

Statistical analysis of all tumors together (TMA) revealed only one molecular marker (PTEN), which gave results close to statistical significance. Conclusion: This is the first large study of Brazilian patients for PI3K, PTEN AKT expression by Immunohistochemistry and PTEN using FISH. Expression values for molecular markers chosen did not reach statistical significance, although PTEN values were close. Use of FISH to distinguish metastatic from non metastatic cases also came close to statistical significance. These results suggest that the expression of PTEN in uveal melanoma may be a good topic to investigate further. Objective: Chronic antibody-mediated (CAMR) and chronic T-cell-mediated rejection (CTCMR) represent predominant reason for late graft dysfunction. Both categories share similar morphological features. We ask the question whether there are differences between CAMR and CTCMR on the molecular level. Method: Graft biopsies (>3 M) were performed and evaluated according to the Banff classification. Biopsy specimens with CAMR (n=13), CTCMR (n=9) and from protocol biopsies with normal histology (n=10) were stabilized in the RNA-later. Using the Taqman Low Density Array, the intrarenal expressions of 378 genes relating to immune response (B-cell activation, T-cell activation, chemokines, growth factors, immune regulators and apoptosis) were analyzed. Results: Both categories of chronic rejection were associated with up-regulation of many genes in comparison with the control group: chemokines (CCL4, CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11), growth factor TGFB1, MHC class II (HLA-DMA, HLA-DMB, HLA-DR, UBD), and in T-cell dependent mechanisms (CD3, CD86, LAG3), including cytotoxic T-cell associated transcripts (GBP1, GZMK). In hierarchical clustering, CAMR and CTCMR gene expression profiles were similar. Conclusion: Chronic rejection very probably involves prolonged cooperation of innate immunity and allospecific immune response. Our study showed that CTCMR and CAMR do not differ on the molecular basis.",

Knock-in mice carrying the R140Q mutation, murine analogue of the most common human mutation R138Q, show developmental arrest of podocytes and renal failure at neonatal age. The aim of this study was to quantify renal histopathological changes in mice with postnatally induced R140Q hemizygosity. Method: C57BL/6 mice with Nphs2Flox/R140Q, Cre + genotype were injected with Tamoxifen for 5 days to induce hemizygosity for R140Q-mutant podocin. Tissue samples were collected at defined intervals after induction. Renal morphology was evaluated by quantitative histology, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Results: Animals developed proteinuria within 1 week that progressed into renal failure and advanced uremia at week 12-16. The number of podocytes per glomerulus started decreasing at week 2 (42\u00b119 vs. 98\u00b131, p= 0.05), whereas glomerular sclerosis index increased from week 4 (1.5\u00b10.15 vs. 0.25\u00b10.08, p<0.00001). Interstitial changes included fibrosis (up to 20 % of section area in end stage renal disease), tubular atrophy and dilatation. Conclusion: Our results implicate that the expression of mutated podocin in induced R140Q-podocin mice leads to podocyte loss that precedes interstitial damage and glomerulosclerosis. Quantification of histological changes will enable better evaluation of the efficacy of different pharmacological approaches directed to improvement of podocyte viability and attenuation of glomerulosclerosis.",

Conclusion: Immunofluorescence examination of kidney biopsies, including testing for immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, is crucial for diagnosis of HCDD. Our study confirmed that HCDD is peculiar among monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition diseases not only because of its rarity but also because of uniform histomorphologic pattern of nodular glomerulosclerosis with pronounced capillary aneurysms and significant proliferation due to complement activation.

Rysava * IKEM, Dept. of Pathology, Praha, Czech Republic Objective: ANCA associated vasculitides (AAV) are rare systemic autoimmune diseases affecting small to mediumsized blood vessels. In kidney biopsy samples, AAV usually demonstrate pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN). Method: Among 198 cases of AAV evaluated at IKEM during 10 years, 2 had a very unusual pattern of renal involvement. Results: The first patient had been treated for recurrent otitis media with unilateral hearing loss. He also suffered from artralgias and hematuria. An ultrasound study revealed a tumor-like mass in his kidney. During exploratory surgery, the lesion appeared to be infiltrative and a nephrectomy was performed. The second patient presented a granulomatous inflammation in a scar. A month later she developed multiple kidney and spleen \"abscesses\" with negative hemoculture, and underwent a nephrectomy with splenectomy. In both cases, the final pathological diagnosis was necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis of small and medium-sized vessels, with large geographical necroses of kidney tissue simultaneously with necrotizing crescentic GN. Tests for ANCA antibodies were positive. No microbial pathogens including mycobacteria were detected. Objective: Polyomavirus nephropathy (PVN) is a common complication after renal transplantation. Virus control is achieved by a reduction of immunosuppression allowing an effective T cell-mediated antiviral immune response. The morphology of resolving PVN has not been investigated. Method: 101 protocol biopsies of 34 patients with PV viremia treated by reduction of immunosuppression only were included and scored according to Banff criteria. The extent of interstitial inflammation was estimated as % of cortex. The number of tubular cross sections with SV40+ cells per mm of biopsy length was counted. Findings were grouped as pre-, increasing, decreasing, and post-viremia. Results: During the phase of decreasing viremia, we found a significant increase in the tubulitis score, the extent of tubules with intraepithelial lymphocytes, and interstitial inflammation (p<0.001). These, to a lower extent, persisted after virus clearance. The number of SV40+ tubules correlated with the virus load in the serum, but SV40 immunohistochemistry was frequently negative (33/55 cases), especially if viremia was below 106 geq/ml. Conclusion: Resolving PVN is characterized by a self-limiting acute interstitial nephritis. Our findings are important because the diagnosis of interstitial rejection depends on the same morphological criteria. Therefore, acute interstitial rejection cannot be diagnosed with certainty during PV viremia.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate presence of NCAM + cells in kidney biopsies of different renal diseases with and without interstitial fibrosis (IF). Further immunophenotyping of NCAM + renal interstitial cells was performed. Method: 97 kidney biopsies, after routine diagnosis, were stained applying antibodies against NCAM clone123C3.D5 or cloneEric1. For double immunofluorescence, antibodies against NCAM cloneEP2567Y and FGFR1, alpha5beta1 integrin, alphaSMA, cadherin9, cadherin11 were used. By RPCR, different NCAM isoforms (120, 140, 180) were detected using specific primers in 11 renal tissues with and without IF. Results: NCAM + interstitial cells were identified in 48 cases: 69 % lupus nephritis, 64 % focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, 64 % IgA nephropathy, 55 % membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, 50 % membranous glomerulonephritis. NCAM + cells coexpressed FGFR1 and alpha5beta1 integrin, and were increased in IF. NCAM + cells did not coexpress alphaSMA, cadherin9 and cadherin11, although they were closely colocalised. All normal renal tissues tested for RPCR showed presence of all NCAM isoforms, however NCAM180 lacked in some tissues with IF.

Method: We conducted an international multi-center trial to assess the reproducibility for C4d immunohistochemistry on paraffin-sections. A tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed comprising 44 kidney allograft specimens representing negative, focal, and diffuse C4d positive cases. Participants stained the TMA slides, evaluated their stains and entered their scores online. Stained slides were returned for centralized panel scoring. Weighted kappa statistics were used to determine reproducibility. Results: Inter-institutional reproducibility, i.e. the product from variability between observers and staining methods was low (mean kappa 0.17). Inter-observer reproducibility was fair (kappa 0.39), while inter-laboratory reproducibility was moderate (kappa 0.49). Inter-observer reproducibility could be significantly improved by omitting the Banff C4d grading schema and only considering +/\u2212 calls (kappa 0.60). Scoring only C4d+/\u2212 inter-laboratory reproducibility improved considerably (kappa 0.78). Higher dilutions of the primary antibody were associated with worse reproducibility. Fixation <1 h or fixation in ethanol had significant negative impact on inter-laboratory reproducibility. Conclusion: C4d results reported from paraffin section are highly variable between institutions. Simplification of the grading schema would improve reproducibility between observers. Technical reproducibility between laboratories is acceptable but could further be improved by standardizing protocols.

Method: Applying heparanase-null mice we found that deletion of the heparanase gene protects diabetic mice from diabetic nephropathy (DN). Recombinant heparanase enzyme and a specific heparanase inhibitor (SST0001) were used to explore its mode of action in several in vivo and in vitro models. Results: There is essential involvement of heparanase in the pathogenesis of DN. Deleting the heparanase gene protects diabetic mice from DN and administration of specific heparanase inhibitor decreases the extent of albuminuria. In vitro, heparanase enhances macrophage activation by diabetic milieu components, and thus increases the kidneydamaging properties of macrophages. Conclusion: Our results validate the role of heparanase in DN and reveal the mechanism of heparanase action emphasizing its function in coupling chronic inflammation, macrophage activation and diabetic kidney injury. These findings will help in developing effective strategies to disrupt the heparanasedriven sequence of events in diabetic kidney disease, and in designing novel therapeutic interventions in DN.

We investigated the role of microvascular angiogenesis in this process of sudden growth. Method: 100 resection specimens of symptomatic vascular malformations were screened for presence and extent of sheets or clusters immature microvessels, interpreted as microvascular angiogenesis. Microvessel density (MVD), mast cell density (MCD) and Ki67 labelling index of endothelial cells (EC) were assessed immunohistochemically and quantified. Extent of angiogenesis was correlated with the type of vascular malformation and clinical characteristics. Results: Of 107 cases, 71 were arteriovenous malformations (AVM), 21 were venous (VM), and 8 were lymphatic (LM). Microvascular angiogenesis was observed in 30 % of all vascular malformations, of which 94 % appeared to be AVM. MVD, MCD and Ki67 labelling indexes of EC were significantly higher in immature vessel areas. Moreover, in affected patients these angiogenic responses were far more extensive (in terms of area involvement) in men than in women (p<0.05). Conclusion: Microvascular angiogenesis appears a specific feature of the arteriovenous type of vascular malformations, and is much more extensive in men than in women. We suggest that these microvascular responses may contribute to onset of symptoms due to a mass forming effect.",

Montanana, J. Sola, T. Labiano * University of Navarra, Dept. of Pathology, Pamplona, Spain Objective: In the literature, there is not enough information about changes of relevant molecular parameters in the recurrent glioblastoma. Method: The study included a total of 11 grade IV astrocytomas (OMS) and their correspondent recurrences in a series of patients treated by 5-ALA guided surgery. All patients received similar treatment. A comparative histologic and molecular study which included LOH of PTEN region, EGFR amplification SISH, methylation of MGMT by MSP-PCR and sequencing of EGFR variant III mutation on representative tumor samples was obtained. Results: The recurrences appeared adjacent to surgical cavity in seven cases. The mean time between the diagnosis of primary and the recurrence was 500 days (215-1670). The primary glioblastomas showed LOH10q23 in 82 % of cases, hypermethylation of MGMT in 50 %, EGFR amplification in 45 % and EGFRvIII in 37 %. In five cases (45 %) the molecular profile of the recurrences was different to the primaries and most of them (80 %) in the group of vaccines treated glioblastomas. The molecular profile change included one to several of the studied parameters. In one case all of the molecular parameters had changed. Conclusion: The molecular profile change of the recurrences of glioblastomas in respect to the primaries is a frequent event that could be due to the selection of tumor cells due to both heterogeneity and treatment effect. Objective: There is not literature reference on the prognostic significance of the proliferative activity in the border of tumor. A large series of patients with glioblastomas operated by fluorescence guided surgery with uniform treatment and enough follow-up have been studied. Method: A total of 207 samples of different fluorescence quality from 67 glioblastomas, 44 primaries and 23 recurrences, were studied. For each tumor, the maximum value of Ki-67 was determined by a semiquantitative counting by two observers and by an autoanalyzer. These values were compared with relevant oncologic parameters. Results: The results of Ki67 according both counting methods were concordant. The Ki67max values of red (center), pink (intermediate) and blue (border) fluorescence samples obtained by quantitative analysis were 28 % 11 % and 6 %. In the Cox regression analysis for overall survival, the Ki67 value was an independent prognostic factor, stronger than other relevant clinical parameters studied (p=0.002). In the Kaplan-Meier for a Ki67 cut-off of 5 %, the median overall survival was 25.1 months against 13.0 months (p=0.023). For the patients with recurrent glioblastomas the overall survival according to Ki67 values was also significant (p=0.017). Conclusion: The evaluation of the proliferative activity by Ki-67 in the border of tumor defined by 5-ala fluorescence is a relevant independent prognostic marker of primary and recurrent glioblastomas. Objective: According to the levels of estrogen receptor (ER) expression, primary breast carcinoma (BC) cases are divided into two groups: ER-positive and ER-negative (Godhirsch et al. 2011) . In metastatic BC, and especially in brain metastases (BM) of BC, the role of ER expression is not clearly defined. Aim: Investigate ER expression levels in brain metastases of BC and evaluate its prognostic significance. Method: Surgically obtained tumor specimens from sixty BC female patients (median age 52, ranges 29-73) with BM BC were stained with antibodies to ER (DAKO). IHC expression was evaluated according to the semi-quantitative method. Survival was estimated by means of Kaplan-Meyer curves. Statistical analysis was performed using STAITIS-TICA 8.0 software. Results: ER expression was detected in 52 % of patients (31/60), and 48 % (29/60) were ER-negative. Median time period between primary diagnosis and BM development was significantly (p<0.05) longer in ER-positive group compared to ER-negative group (48 and 23 months, respectively). Recurrent BM developed in both groups with a similar frequency (32 % and 34 %, respectively). General survival was significantly (p=0,026) higher in ER-positive patients compared to that of ER-negative group. Conclusion: ER expression is considered to be an important prognostic factor for development of BMBC. Nevertheless, further studies involving more patients with BMBC are required.",

These rats demonstrate progressive increases in alpha synuclein (\u03b1-syn) in the brain mesencephalon followed by loss of dopaminergic terminals in the basal ganglia and motor impairments. Method: Histology, immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy were used for morphological analyses. For \u03b1-syn assessment real-time PCR and western blot were used. Dopamine measurements were performed by ion mobility mass spectral (IMMS). Results: The severity of pathology is directly related to the overexpression of \u03b1-syn and parallel decrease in dopamine (DA) level in the striatum (ST) of affected rats. The neurodegeneration in this model is characterized by the presence of perikarya and neurites Lewis bodies (LB) and diffuse marked accumulation of perikaryal \u03b1-syn in the substantia nigra (SN), brain stem, and striatum along with neuronal loss. Light and ultrastructural analyses revealed that the process of neuronal degeneration is a \"dying back\" type. The disease process is accompanied by gliosis and release of inflammatory cytokines. Conclusion: Decrease dopamine and overexpression of \u03b1-syn in the brain mesencephalon may provide a naturally occurring animal model for Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies that reproduces significant pathological, neurochemical, and behavioral features of the human disease. Sunday, 9 September 2012, 14.15 -16.15 Objective: The mitotic index in thin primary melanomas replaced Clark level in the 2009 staging system of the AJCC. However, the recommended quantification of proliferation by hot spots on HE stains is criticized. An alternative may be the immunohistochemical proliferation marker phosphohistone H3 (PHH3) visualizing all mitotic cells. And, when combined with the melanocytic marker MART1, PHH3 insures quantification of proliferating melanocytes, only. Method: 153 primary melanomas with a median follow-up of 12 years for patients with event-free melanoma were included. PHH3/MART1 stains were performed by an indirect sequential immunoenzymatic technique. The number of PHH3/MART1 positive cells was counted in a fixed 1-mm2 frame in the dermal area with the highest concentration of positive cells (hot spots). Results: In multivariate analysis, PHH3 in hot spots was a strong independent prognostic marker for recurrent disease (HR=3.7, 95 % CI, 1.4 to 9.6; P=.008) and melanoma-specific death (HR=3.4, 95 % CI, 1.3 to 9.0; P=.013), when corrected for primary tumor thickness and ulceration. Conclusion: Cellular proliferation is an independent prognostic marker in primary cutaneous melanoma. However, accurate quantification is crucial for correct clinical staging. For this purpose, proliferation indices of the novel PHH3/MART1 double stains seem very promising. Objective: Some of the more common benign vocal fold lesions are polyps, nodules and polypoid corditis (Reinke's edema). The majority of vocal fold pathology develops in the mucosal layer of the vocal fold, precisely in Reinkes space. Basic science and clinical research over past decades has led to advances in our understanding of benign laryngeal lesions. The aim of our study was compared contact telescopy findings with histological analyzes in a patients with Reinke's edema. Method: The our study included 80 consecutive patients with clinical diagnosis of Reinke's edema. Videoassisted contact telescopy was performed in all cases under general anesthesia and mucosa was stained by methylene blue. Tissue biopsies were taken from areas exhibiting visible pathological changes and sent to routine histopathology and immunohistochemical analyses. We analyzed expression of pancytokeratin antibodies, vimentin and CD 34. Results: In the all case of Reinke's edema, contact telescopic scans showed a change of direction or a disappearance of regular distribution and morphology of blood vessels (irregular shapes, positions, and patterns, apparently running in random directions) in vocal fold mucosa. Marked pathological changes were noted by contact telescopic scans, confirmed with histopathology analyses. Conclusion: Contact telescopy is a useful additional diagnostic tool regarding Reinke's edema.",

We report our experience in the pathology departments of Blantyre and Lilongwe, Malawi. Method: During a six-week period 405 cases were processed (378 histology, 27 cytology). Results: The vast majority of cases showed significant pathological findings (n=369; 91.1 %): 175 (47.4 %) were non-tumoral conditions and 39 (10.6 %) benign tumors or tumor like lesions. The large group of malignancies (n=140; 37.9 %) comprised 11 pediatric tumors (e.g. rhabdomyosarcoma, small blue round cell tumors), and 129 adult tumors. Amongst women (n=76), squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the cervix uteri predominated (n=25; 32.9 %), followed by breast carcinomas (n=12; 15.8 %), and esophageal SCC (n=9; 11.8 %). Males (n=53) most often showed SCC of the esophagus (n=9; 17.0 %), and SCC of the urinary bladder (n=7; 13.2 %). Lymphomas (n=7) and Kaposi's sarcomas (n=6) were less frequent.

Method: On two cohort groups: A (a total of 5518 samples), and B (a total of 2615 samples) we performed IF on commercially obtained Hep-2 cell, and immunoblot on (strips Euroline). Results: IF revealed at least 14 different morphological patterns of ANA staining, which we grouped into 5 easily distinguished categories: speckled nuclear fluorescence, homogenous nucleoplasmic fluorescence, multiple nuclear dots, nucleoli staining, and scattered nucleoplasmic dots. We compared these groups according to frequency, type of antibody and correlation with immunoblot resuts.",

Still, the definition of the function of MF with relation to tumors is still vague, mainly when MF are observed acting occasionally as pro tumor and elsewhere as anti tumor. Method: In this paper we attempt to sum up the accumulating observations of MF function with respect to the microenvironment and the tumor entity. Results: Through the different stages of tumorigenesis and growth, macrophages are engaged in various signaling cascades that tame them to perform a certain function in a given microenvironment. This makes MF a multi-program cell with unique adaptivity. We assume that without the macrophages tumors cannot progress. Conclusion: The available MF subtype analysis is still inadequate and doesn't bear into account the dynamics of tumorigenesis and growth. Our presented MF schemes provide an insight on the tumor microenvironment with respect to stage. A complex view on the signaling cascades affecting MF is needed to formulate a novel classification of MF based on their programming. This consequently can be the basis of the development of \"anti-MF therapy\" or on a larger scale \"anti-tumor microenvironment therapy\".

Our aim was to perform whole exome-sequencing on 5 CR-PCa/normal paired formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples using the SOLiD4 next generation sequencing platform (NGS). We identified two promising genes-YWHAZ and PTK2, that could serve as novel potential therapeutic drug targets in PCa. Method: Genomic DNA was sequenced from 5 CR-PCa/ normal paired FFPE samples. A set of amplified/deleted genes were validated using fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) assays using a PCa progression cohort consisting of 138 cases for localized PCa, 105 patients with primary PCa and corresponding LN metastasis, and 39 samples for CRPCa. Results: Exome-sequencing identified regions of deletions/ amplifications, including NKX3.1, PTEN, CMYC and AR genes, known to play a role in PCa. We identified several amplified genes as druggable targets such as PTK2 and YWHAZ. For YWHAZ we identified 3.5 % amplification in localized PCa, 24.2 % amplification in LN metastasis and 45.5 % amplification in CRPCa.

There is no comprehensive study on p40 expression in tumours of different histotypes. Method: 460 tumours of various hisotypes were studied, including tumours of stratified epithelium such as SCC (84 cases) of the skin, head/neck, lung, cervix, and oesophagus, urothelial carcinomas (18), cutaneous basal cell carcinomas (5), thymomas (20) and thymic carcinomas (5), adenocarcinomas (210) from multiple organs, germ cell tumours (25), brain tumours (17), lymphomas (14), and sarcomas (12). p40 immunostains were performed on tissue microarrays and staining extent was evaluated as focal (1-50 %) and diffuse (50-100 %). Results: All but one tumours of stratified epithelium diffusely expressed p40. The negative case represents spindle cell SCC. Other tumours except for basal/squamous component of two teratomas, one breast metaplastic carcinoma, and squamous component of 5 adenosquamous carcinomas were all negative for p40. Conclusion: p40 is specific in tumours of stratified epithelium and its sensitivity appears comparable to p63. p40 can serve as a marker for tumours of stratified epithelium. Objective: Although formaldehyde is the standard fixative used in routine histopathology, it is not considered an \"ideal\" fixative.

In tumoral cases we fixed 1 cm3 sample in neutral buffered formalin and compared the results with Gyo-Fixx fixation. Results: Glyo-Fixx fixation needed less hours than formaldehyde and not harden the tissues. On gross examination of the adipose tissue, lymph nodes were easily found, due to a more marked whitish appearance. Morphologically we have not found differences between formalin and Glyo-Fixx, except for the eosinophils degranulation. Special stains resulted similar to those with formaldehyde fixations.

The most common site of osteoblastoma is the vertebral column particularly the posterior elements and the sacrum. Method: In this study we present nine cases of osteoblastoma and the principal differential diagnosis. Results: On a period of 10 years, nine cases of osteoblastoma had been diagnosed including seven males and two females. The age of those patients ranged from 5 to 29 year old. The tumor was localized in the spine in five of the nine cases and the other ones in the long bones. The radiological diagnosis of osteoblastoma was made in just two cases. The diagnosis was made by histology in eight cases. All our patients had been treated with curettage. On the nine patients, just one of them had developed two successive recurrences. Conclusion: Osteoblastoma is a rare benign tumor which is rarely diagnosed by radiology alone. The pathologist should always suspect an osteoblastoma in front of a vertebral localization of any tumor. Objective: Congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) is a developmental disorder of the portobiliary system. Clinical findings usually include enlarged liver, well-preserved hepatocellular function and portal hypertension. CHF is frequently associated with hepatorenal fibrocystic disease. Method: A 29-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for further evaluation of hepatomegaly, and portal hypertension was found. Laboratory tests were all negative. MRI identified hepatosplenomegaly with hypertrophic left medial segment, high uptake nodular areas and homogeneous boundary liver. Needle biopsy was performed. Results: The biopsy demonstrated slight portal fibrosis and fibrous septa with proliferation of numerous biliary ducts, some of them containing inspissated bile. It was also noticeable the few number of portal vein branches. There was no inflammation or hepatocyte necrosis. Therefore, our diagnosis was congenital hepatic fibrosis. We correlated these results with radiology. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed peripherally dilated biliary intrahepatic branches contrasting with preserved caliber of main intrahepatic branches. These findings were also diagnostic for CHF. Conclusion: The low prevalence of CHF makes it hard to think about this entity in patients with portal hypertension and normal laboratory findings. The histological differential diagnosis must be done mainly with cirrhosis, but also with idiopathic portal hypertension and, in small biopsies, with biliary hamartoma. Results: A total of 97 cases of digestive tract lymphoma were reported (64 males, 33 females) with a sex-ratio of 2.0. The patient age ranged between 6 and 82 years with a median age of 48 years.

Method: We describe our experience of this entity in University Hospital Galway with a series of four cases diagnosed between 2003 and 2011. Results: Three patients aged between 35 and 62 years presented with either lymph node or bone metastases without evident abdominal mass. In each case the biopsy from the metastatic lesion showed adenocarcinoma with an immunohistochemical profile suggestive of renal origin and a renal mass was subsequently confirmed by radiology. The fourth patient was an 81 year old male who presented with haematuria. Abdominal CT scan revealed a 5.6 cm mass in the right kidney extending into the renal vein. Biopsy of the renal mass in all cases confirmed adenocarcinoma with a tubular pattern with positive cytokeratin and Vimentin staining and CD10 negative staining. One patient was treated with nephrectomy with post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy and died 25 months after surgery. The other three patients died few months after their diagnosis. Conclusion: Collecting duct carcinoma is a rare renal neoplasm that can be difficult to diagnose on core biopsies, however, it can be identified based on radiological findings, gross, microscopic, histochemical and immunohistochemical features. Objective: Wilms Tumors (WT) is the most frequent renal tumor of children. Genetic alterations have been suggested as associated factors but the exact pathogenesis of WT is not fully characterized. Tissue factor (TF) is a glycoprotein which happens to be a key receptor for factor VII/VIIa and a primary initiator of coagulation. TF has also been associated with angiogenesis. Recent evidence pointed out an important role for TF in cancer progression and metastasis. Method: In the present investigation the differential expression of TF in WT was assessed by real-time PCR of RNA retrieved from paraffin sections using microdissection. Results: Different histological components of WT were analysed. The results revealed that TF was upregulated in blastema and epithelial components as compared to nonneoplastic tissue (14.38 and 16.02-fold respectively, P< 0.001). Stroma and non-neoplastic tissue presented low levels of TF expression. TF expression in WT metastatic lesions was also significantly upregulated as compared to non-metastatic WT. Microvessel density was positively correlated with TF expression (r=0.721). Conclusion: As described in other tumors, TF seems to play a significant role in the behavior of WT. Further investigations are warranted to better understand the pathways by which TF exerts its effects on tumor progression and its potential as a target for therapy. Objective: Biliary atresia (BA) is the most common neonatal cholestatic disorder and the prime indication for liver transplantation (LTx) in children. Histopathological markers in liver biopsies emerge promise as indicator of early LTx in patients with BA. Method: Ductular proliferation, ductal plate malformations and type I, III, IV and V collagen deposition were evaluated on Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE) and liver transplantation (LTx) biopsies from 36 children with BA. Formalin fixed and paraffin embedded liver biopsies were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, picrosirius-polarization and immunofluorescence methods. There were analyzed liver histoarchitecture, biliary ductus and collagen deposition in hepatic compartments. Pathologic findings were graded according to a 5-point semi-quantitative severity-based scoring system. Impact of these markers was tested on LTx time (<2 year and >2 year). Results: Median age of KPE was 12 weeks (range 6-20) and of LTx was 27 months (range 6-120). In KPE liver biopsies, ductular proliferation, ductal plate malformations and collagen deposition were increased but these parameters presented no association with clinical evolution for early LTx. Furthermore, collagen V prominent deposition was found along of hepatic sinusoids and type I, III and IV were more frequent in portal compartment. Conclusion: These results suggest that histopathological parameters evaluation presented may not determine early LTx in biliary atresia.",

Higher microvessel scorring were found in MA in contrast to BO and the control group (p=0.003 and p= 0.003, respectively). However, there was no difference between the control group and BO (p=0.54). Conclusion: We think that Hofbauer cells may be of biological importance in early fetal losses and play a role on defective vasculature formation in MA.",

VEGF and its receptorsone of the key placental angiogenic factor. Aim: to evaluate patterns of VEGF and its receptors (VEGFRs 1, 2 and 3) expression in placentas from PE complicated pregnancies. Method: We performed complex morphological and immunohistochemical study of 9 term placentas from mild preeclampsia (mPE) cases (1st group), 6 term placentas from severe preeclampsia (sPE) cases (2nd group) and 10 term placentas from uncomplicated pregnancies (control group). Results: We revealed significantly increased syncitial VEGF expression levels in preeclamptic placentas terminal villi and these changes were much prominent in sPE. We also detected insignificantly increased endothelial VEGF expression levels in preeclamptic placentas terminal villi. VEGFR-1 syncitial expression levels in sPE terminal villi were significantly higher in compare to the mPE and control groups. VEGFR-2 endothelial and syncitial expression levels were significantly lower in both PE groups terminal villi and these changes were much prominent in mPE. Patterns of VEGFR-3 expression in preeclamptic and control groups were multidirectional. Conclusion: Revealed patterns of VEGF and its receptors expression point on altered placental angiogenesis in PE and reflect different degree of such alteration in mild and severe PE. Objective: Chorionic villi vascularity disturbances, caused by abnormal expression of angiogenic factors could correlate with maternal and fetal complications in diabetic pregnancies. Method: Aim: to evaluate the patterns of VEGF receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3) expression in placentas from gestational diabetes (GD) and type 1 diabetes (D1) pregnancies and correlation between them and some clinical parameters in newborn (placental weight (PW), newborn weight (NW), placental/newborn weight index (PNWI),1st day of life blood glucose test results (1BGTR)). 29 term placentas from D1 (n=16) and GD (n=20) and 12 term placentas from normal pregnancy (control group) were studied. Results: In both D1 and GD group we revealed significantly higher level of VEGFR1 (p=0.0001), VEGFR2 (p=0.001) and VEGFR3 (p=0.01) endothelial expression in terminal villi. Difference in VEGFR1 expression among D1 and GD groups was also significant (p=0.0009) as difference in its expression between D1 and control group (p = 0.002). Among clinical parameters we only revealed significant increase in 1BGTR in diabetic groups (p = 0.03) with marked difference between D1 and control group (p = 0.002).

We examined the effects of loss of M5B in enterocytes of MVID patient and in a CaCo-2 cell model. Method: The expression and localization of cell membrane transporters (CD36, Na/K ATPase) and various cell organelle markers : endosomal Rab GTPases [Rab5, 7, 8, 9, 11] ; early (EEA1) and late endosome (LAMP2), and Golgi (Giantin)) were analyzed using multilabel immunoflourescence and confocal microscopy of a duodenal biopsy from MVID patient and in CaCo-2 cells following M5B si RNA knock-down (Hum Mut 31:1-8,2010). Results: Depletion of M5B in both enterocytes and CaCo-2 cells resulted in disruption of epithelial cell polarity with loss of apical microvilli, formation of MI; mislocalization of transporters as well as aggregation of epitopes for different Rab GTP ases, early and late endosomes. Conclusion: M5B plays a critical role in polarized organization of enterocytes in MVID -a disorder characterized by defective intracellular trafficking and altered endosomal sorting. CaCo-2 cells provide an excellent model to study the pathogenesis of MVID.",

Thrombus of the vena cava was evoked on imaging studies in all cases and pulmonary metastases were always found. Catecholamine metabolites were present in the first case and negative in the two others. Two out of three patients had a radical nephrectomy. Results: The pathological analysis always found a neuroblastoma poorly differentiated or undifferentiated without MYCN amplification and confirmed the tumoral thrombus in the second case.

Thoeni * * Division of Cell Biology, Medical University Innsbruck, Austria Objective: Congenital enteropathies (CE) are characterized by villous atrophy and disruption of apical microvilli in duodenal enterocytes. TE is characterized by focal eptithelial tufts and mutations in the EpCAM gene, coding for epithelial cell adhesion molecule, important for cell-cell contacts. Microvillus inclusion disease (MVID), shows loss of apical microvilli and formation of intracytoplasmatic microvillus inclusions. MVID is caused by mutations in the MYO5B gene, important for intracellular transport and organization of epithelial cell polarity. In this study, we identified a new EpCAM mutation in a patient with TE and used anti-EpCAM antibody as a marker for the diagnosis of TE and distinction from MVID. Method: We used Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with monoclonal EpCAM antibody (mouse monoclonal AB for EpCAM, NCL ESA/Leica Microsystems) on routinely processed duodenal biopsies from patients with TE, MVID and age matched controls. Immunostaining for E-Cadherin served as reference. Results: EpCAM expression was completely absent in the biopsy from TE patient homozygous for a novel EpCAM mutation (c227 C>G, Ser 76X). E-Cadherin showed normal expression and distribution pattern in the enterocytes. In MVID, expression and distribution pattern was comparable to controls for both EpCAM and E-Cadherin. Conclusion: Loss of EpCAM is specific and a sensitive marker for confirmation of TE. EpCAM antibody is useful in the differential diagnosis of CE. Objective: In pulmonary adenocarcinoma EGFR mutation analysis has become an important part of the diagnostic work-up. Frequently the tissue of bronchoscopies is of limited diagnostic value. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of ROSE on brochoscopy specimens with regard to EGFR mutation. Method: ROSE was used for adequacy of the specimen and for separating adenocarcinomas and carcinomas NOS from other neoplasms in the lung. If it was not possible to retrieve material for histology, cytology and cellblock were made. If adenocarcinoma or carcinoma NOS was suspected in ROSE, further two biopsies or two cell blocks were obtained. EGFR mutation analysis was performed by PCR (Light Cycler 480; EGFR RGQ PCR Kit; Qiagen). Results: Malignancy was diagnosed in 93 of 354 cases by histology or on cytology with and without cell blocks. Adenocarcinomas (n=30) and carcinomas NOS (n=9), SCC (n =26), SCLC (n = 13), and rare tumors (n=15) were diagnosed, respectively. Among the group of adenocarcinomas and carcinomas NOS (n = 39), EGFR mutation analysis was performed in 29 (74,3 %) cases and showed mutations in 3 (10,3 %) and \"wild type\" in 26 (89,7 %) tumors. No material was left in 10 (25,6 %) cases. Conclusion: ROSE supports bronchoscopic procedures to retrieve adequate specimens for tumor diagnosis and subsequent EGFR mutation analysis. Objective: Patients with Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplified squamous cell lung cancers (L-SCC) are treated in phase I clinical trials using small molecule inhibitors (SMI). SCC of the lung share common molecular alterations with squamous cell head and neck cancers (HN-SCC). Aim of our study is to assess if HN-SCCs also harbor FGFR1 amplifications. Furthermore, we aim to inhibit cell proliferation of FGFR1 amplified HN-SCC cell lines using a SMI. Method: The cohort consists of 227 patients suffering from HN-SCC, 97 of these suffering from metastatic disease. Primary tumors and metastatic tumors were assessed for FGFR1 copy number status using fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). We tested cell lines for FGFR1 amplification status and inhibited these with SMIs. Objective: The pulp of pequi has high levels of antioxidants properties. Method: Eighteen male BALB/c mice divided: 14 animals received by gavage 0,5 \u03bcL/mg/day of pequi oil (Control + CBCoil=4) during 75 days. After 15 days, 10 of these mices received two doses of 1,5 g/kg intraperitoneal of urethane (Urethane + CBC oil=10). The other 4 animals were only submitted to two doses of 1,5 g/kg intraperitoneal of urethane (Urethane group=4). After 75 days, groups were sacrificed. Antioxidant activity was evaluated in the lung tissues by TBARS (Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances), CAT (catalase) and SOD (superoxido dismutase) test. DNA damage was estimated by comet test. Results: The lung parenchyma from Urethane groups without oil and with oil showed neoplasic formations induced by the chemical carcinogenesis in contrast with Control + CBC oil group. The results of TBARS test showed a significant decrease of lipid peroxidation in the Urethane + CBC oil, than Urethane group. The CAT and SOD test didn't show a significant difference. Comet assay showed a significant decrease of DNA damage in Urethane + CBC oil when compared with Urethane group. Conclusion: The antioxidant components in the pequi oil diminish the oxidative stress status and DNA damage in chemical carcinogenesis, suggesting that this type of strategies may have a greater impact in lung cancer treatment.

The approach to be followed for planning analyses is not standardized in the literature. Method: We have studied by molecular methods (PCR-RFLP for K-RAS, direct sequencing for EGFR and FISH for ALK) 185 formalin fixed, paraffin embedded cases of lung adenocarcinomas of different subtypes. Results: Based on rational, biological and economic considerations we started with K-RAS analysis by PCR-RFLP, which showed mutations in 38 cases (37 with mutation on codon 12 and one case with mutation on codon 13), The 147 residual cases were all analyzed for EGFR mutations. FISH for ALK translocation followed in EGFR-wild cases. Conclusion: The analysis for K-RAS mutations allows to select the significant percentage (approximately 25 % of adenocarcinomas) when EGFR mutation analysis by direct sequencing can be postponed. K-RAS and EGFR wild cases will then undergo FISH analysis for ALK translocation.

Moreover, distinction between primary and metastatic carcinoma is critical. Thus, the role of immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been emphasized, although an optimal IHC diagnostic algorithm has not been firmly established. Herein, we evaluated the performance of the IHC panel used at our institution in subclassification of lung cancer and identification of metastatic carcinoma. Method: Cases of non-neuroendocrine lung carcinoma, diagnosed from March 2011 to April 2012 were selected. IHC was performed for CK7, CK20, TTF-1 and p63. Resection specimens were compared with the respective biopsy. Results: Of 184 cases analysed, 73 (39.7 %) were diagnosed as lung adenocarcinoma, 59 (32.1 %) as epidermoid carcinoma, 22 (12 %) as other forms of NSCLC, and 17 (9.2 %) as metastasis. Importantly, 26 % of primary lung adenocarcinomas were initially suspected to be metastasis. In 26 cases submitted to surgical resection, 22 (84.6 %) were correctly diagnosed in the biopsy, revealing a substantial agreement (\u03ba-value=0,757). Conclusion: Our IHC panel allows for reliable subclassification of lung carcinomas in most cases and is decisive for appropriate diagnosis in patients suspected of lung metastasis, which is critical issue in a cancer institute.",

            "text": "Objective: We previously identified amplified fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGFR1) as a therapeutic target for small molecule inhibitor (SMI) therapy in squamous cell lung cancer (L-SCC), resulting in currently running clinical trials treating patients with stage III disease. As most patients present with metastatic stage of disease, we attempt to demonstrate FGFR1 amplification in lymph node metastases of amplified primary tumors. Our study aims to give a rational to include these patients in a targeted SMI therapy. Method: We assessed 75 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary L-SCC samples. 46 samples were primary tumours with corresponding FFPE lymph node metastasis. The biotin-labelled FGFR1 target probe (8p11.23 to 8p11.22) was used to determine the FGFR1 amplification status performing fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: Of 39 assessable metastatic L-SCC, 7 samples displayed FGFR1 amplification (18 %). All of these primary tumors also harbored FGFR1 amplification in their lymph node metastasis. Non-amplified tumors never displayed FGFR1 amplification in corresponding metastases. Conclusion: We found FGFR1 amplification not only in primary L-SCC, but also in corresponding lymph node metastasis, suggesting that this genetic aberration is a clonal event in tumor genesis. Our study provides data indicating new therapeutic possibilities for patients suffering not only primary, but also metastatic FGFR1 amplified SCC lung cancer disease. KRAS mutation was a G to T transversion in 80 % of the smoker NSCLC population and a G to A transition in 98 % of the non smoker NSCLC population. Mutations were noted at codon 12 (90 %), codon 13 (8 %) and codon 61 (2 %). A KRAS mutation was a negative prognostic factor with a hazard ratio for death of 1.38 (95 % confidence interval, 1.16-1.63). A mucinous histological subtype was observed in more than 75 % of KRAS mutated tumours. Conclusion: KRAS oncogene substitution must be accurately determined in primary lung adenocarcinoma for correlation with tumour behaviour and clinico-pathological parameters. Objective: There is an urgent need for diagnosis of NSCLC at its early-stages and for improving the survival rate of patients. MicroRNAs, small non-coding RNAs, are frequently deregulated in NSCLC. This study aimed to explore plasma microRNAs for diagnostic value, and evaluated the correlation between expression profiles of plasma micro-RNAs and disease-free survival (DFS) in NSCLC patients. Method: We selected eighteen most frequently expressed microRNAs in NSCLC. Total plasma RNA including microRNAs was isolated and reverse-transcribed into cDNAs. The level of microRNAs was determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in 42 resectable NSCLC patients and 10 matched cancer-free individuals. The correlation between the expression of microRNAs in plasma and patient DFS were examined by log-rank and Cox analysis. Results: Expression levels of miR-320,\u2212296,\u2212145,\u2212199a, \u2212191,\u2212223,\u221224,\u2212152,\u2212126, and let-7f in the plasma of NSCLC including stage-I patients were significantly higher compared with controls (P<0.0001). The combination of these microRNAs yielded 87 % sensitivity and 90 % specificity (AUC=0.934) in discriminating NSCLC patients from controls. The levels of miR-155, \u2212152, \u221220a, \u2212223, \u2212126 and miR-199a were significantly associated with DFS (P<0.05). Conclusion: Our results suggest that high expression of 6plasma miRNAs signature would provide potential noninvasive blood-based biomarker for the prognosis of NSCLC.",

Although the activation by hypoxia of the carbonic anhydrases CAIX and CAXII is well known, responses of these proteins under reoxygenation remain to be elucidated. Method: In this study we evaluated the effects of hypoxiareoxygenation on CAIX and CAXII expression and cell proliferation in A549 and H1975 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. We further investigated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray the value of the combined expression of these proteins to predict outcome in 552 NSCLC patients. Results: CAIX expression was maintained at high level after reoxygenation in contrast of the rapid CAXII downregulation, whereas the cell proliferation rate was significantly increased. Survival analyses showed that high CAIX/ low CAXII was associated with high cumulative incidence of relapse and with poor overall survival of NSCLC patients (P<0.05). Conclusion: Our results provide insight into understanding dynamic responses of CAIX and CAXII expression under tumour cells reoxygenation and demonstrate a critical role for reoxygenation on CAIX and CAXII levels that may select for aggressive lung cancer phenotype. These findings suggest that CAIX and CAXII play selective roles in tumour progression and emphasize their significant prognostic and potential therapeutic value.",

ALK break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and immunochemistry using an anti-ALK antibody were done on CTCs and compared with results obtained on corresponding tissue specimens. Results: 5 patients showed ALK-gene rearrangement and strong ALK protein expression in CTCs and corresponding tumour samples. Negative results were found for 82 patients in CTCs and corresponding tumour samples. Conclusion: We demonstrate that the ALK status can be determined in CTCs from lung cancer patients both by immunocytochemistry and FISH analysis. A strong correlation was found for the ALK status obtained from corresponding tissue specimens.

Examination of paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from the same patients was done in parallel. Results: 75 cytological/histological lung adenocarcionoma sample pairs underwent the analysis for EGFR mutation. 2 cytological and 1 morphological samples failed to produce DNA. Concordance for the wild-type and mutation status was observed in 53/72 and 14/72 informative pairs, respectively; 1 pair was non-interpretable; 3 and 1 pairs had mutation only in the cytological or histological material, respectively. RNA extraction followed by RT-PCR analysis for the EML4-ALK translocation was done for the 51 pair; failures were observed for 3 cytological and 8 histological samples. 34/40 informative pairs were concordant for the norm, 3 contained identical translocations, and 2 were noninterpretable. 1 pair demonstrated ALK rearrangement in the tissue block but not in the histological slide. Conclusion: Archived cytological slides appear to be well suitable both for EGFR and ALK analysis. Objective: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents a heterogeneous group of cancers consisting mainly of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (AD). Increased sirtuin (SIRT-1) expression leads to deacetylation of p53 that could be important in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Differences of the molecular mechanisms in NSCLC subtypes may follow subtly different pathways to tumorigenesis. The aim of our study was compare SIRT-1 expression in lung adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and control group. Method: 25 patients with stage 2 lung cancer were enrolled in the study. 14 patients had adenocarcinoma, but 11 patients had squamous cell carcinoma. Lung tissue for control group were selected from 15 autopsy cases. Immunohistochemical and western blot methods were used to evaluate SIRT-1 expression in lung tissue. Results: Obtained results showed that patients with lung cancer had increased SIRT-1 expression compared to control group (146\u00b1111 vs. 21\u00b116 cells/mm2, p<0.0001). In addition, patients with squamous cell carcinoma had increased SIRT-1 positive cells compared to patients with adenocarcinoma (203\u00b1143 vs. 95\u00b149 cells/mm2, p=0.03). Conclusion: Lung cancer is characterized by an increased SIRT-1 expression which ir more prominent in squamous cell carcinoma. Objective: Transplantation is the only treatment for several end-stage lung diseases but limited by chronic allograft dysfunction particularly obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) and its correlate bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. The development of preclinical models is crucial to better identify immunological/non-immunological mechanisms leading to OB. [group B and C] post-transplant, animals were sacrificed. In animals from group C, cyclosporine was administered at sub-optimal dose. Lung rejection was graded according to the working formulation of ISHLT and the presence of circulating donor-specific (DSA) antibodies determined by flow cytometry. Results: In group A, acute rejection (AR) or OB occurred in 33 % and 17 % of animals, respectively. AR occurred in 33-44 % of animals in group B and C respectively. OB was detected in 33 % and in 44 % of group B and C respectively. High levels of DSA IgG were observed in cases with AR. Conclusion: A novel model of pulmonary OB was developed in the rat. To obtain a reproducible onset of OB, shortterm and sub therapeutic cyclosporin administration appears indispensable, at least in our species combination.",

Macroscopically, an irregular whitish nodule of 1.5 cm in greatest diameter was detected. Microscopically, the nodule was entirely composed of glandular and papillary structures, some of which had a cribriform pattern, lined by tumor cells that were cuboidal to tall columnar with nuclear pseudostratification, eosinophilic cytoplasm, brush-border, luminal necrosis and nuclear debris. Tumor cells were diffusely positive for cytokeratin (CK)7 and negative for thyroid transcription factor-1, surfactant protein-A, CDX-2 and MUC2. Only a very few tumor cells stained for CK20.

The chemochine seems to be responsible for creating microenviromental predispositions for survival of metastatic cells, in a similar way it is done for developing immuno-competent cells. In contrast, expression of CXCL 12 in primary tumor cells, is thought to be associated with lower metastatic potential. CXCR4 is expressed in a wide range of tumors, and is thought to be crucial for the metastatic process and tissue-specific spread firstly of breast and prostate cancer. The role of CXCR4 signaling has been poorly evaluated in carcinoids in general and not at all in pulmonary carcinoids. Method: Immunohistochemically we investigated the expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12 in pulmonary carcinoids. Results: Together 60 tumors (47 typical and 13 atypical) where investigated. In 6 there was a metastatic process (in 4 typical and 2 atypical). Ligand CXCL12 expression was negative in all of the metastatic tumors and in two without known metastasis in contrast to only two non-metastatic tumors showing negative reaction. CXCR4 positivity was found in both metastatic and non-metastatic carcinoids. The other investigated parameters where present in both metastatic and non-metastatic tumors. Objective: To evaluate COL V and decorin expression in pulmonary tissue and to characterize biochemical profile of COLV from lung fibroblasts culture from SSc patients. Method: We evaluated COL V and decorin expression and tridimensional reconstruction (3D) of 6 patients with SSc without pulmonary hypertension that underwent surgical lung biopsy and as control was obtained lung fragments from 6 normal individuals who died from trauma. COL V amount in lung sections was evaluated with immunofluorescence. To biochemical characterization of COL V from lung fibroblasts culture was used quantitative immunoblot. Results: It was found that the structure of COL V fibers was distorted and strongly thickened in lung tissue from SSc patients compared with thin fibers pattern in the healthy controls. Decorin was distributed around COL V fibrils in the bronchovascular interstitium and vascular walls. Histomorphometric analysis of SSc lung demonstrated increased expression of both COL V and decorin when compared to the control (p < 0.01). The semiquantitative imunoblot detected an increased high molecular weight COLV fraction in patients when compared to the control. Conclusion: The over expression and unusual organization of COLV fibers with biochemical changes associated to increased decorin indicates that matrix signalization pathway is involved in COLV fibrillogenesis process in SSc pulmonary fibrosis. Objective: Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) is a new method used during bronchoscopy by means of special miniprobe Alveoflex and based on the visualization of intraalveolar structures which possess autofluorescence. Aim: to compare the visual signs of a healthy and pathologically changed lung tissue received at pCLE in patients with infiltrative and local lung nodules with the diagnosis, delivered by light microscopy. Method: An autopsy and surgical material was fixed in 10 % neutral formalin solution and was analyzed by studying with a new method for visualization of structures. Histological specimens were studied at that spaces, where the pCLE was applied. We compared our results by using qualitative method. Results: Normal lung tissue structures include alveolar septum with the high light emission and light-negative spacesthe alveolar spaces. In case of pneumonia alveolar septum were saved, but the light density of alveolar spaces was higher in compare with the normal tissue. In case of alveolar proteinosis we observed unique globules, which had the highest light emission. We found out several authentic signs, which are representative for each kind of pathological feature.

Immunohistochemical (IHC) screening of ALK abnormalities in NSCLC was reported to have variable reliability. We analyzed association between ALK immunoreactivity and increased number of ALK gene copies often seen in NSCLC. Method: We examined 10 clinically selected EGFR negative lung adenocarcinomas. ALK protein expression was detected by IHC using antibody clone ALK1 (Dako). ALK gene status was assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization using LSI ALK Dual Color Rearrangement probe (Abbott) and SPEC ALK/EML4 TriCheck probe (ZytoVision). Results: Increased ALK gene copy number was identified in 7 cases, 3 of them showed cytoplasmic ALK positivity. In 2 of these cases we detected rearrangement of ALK locus, once represented by ALK-EML4 fusion combined with more complex cytogenetic abnormalities. Remaining third ALK + case was negative for ALK rearrangement. Conclusion: IHC seems to be useful method for initial screening of ALK rearrangements in NSCLC. There is no clear association between ALK protein expression and number of ALK gene copies. Prognostic relevance of ALK copy gains or amplification in lung adenocarcinomas remains to be determined, together with role of ALK-inhibitors in those cases.",

Our primary aim was to determine whether these proliferative markers influence the course of IPF course measured by a radiological/functional score. Method: Twenty-eight patients with biopsy-proven IPF disease, who underwent pulmonary evaluation by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) fibrosis score and pulmonary function tests were studied. Five normal lung tissues (NLT) were included Biomarkers in lung tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry and quantified by histomorphometry for myofibroblasts alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), anti-interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13. Results: Myofibrobalst amount, IL-4 and IL-13 expression were higher in IPF than in NLT (p<0.01). Myofibroblast expression of \u03b1-SMA was positively correlated to IL-14 and IL-13 expression. Lung tissue from patients with high HRCT fibrosis scores expressed significantly greater \u03b1-SMA+, IL-4 and IL-13 when compared with patients with low HRCT fibrosis scores (p<0.05). Negative correlations were found between myofibroblasts \u03b1-SMA + and VC and DLCO. Conclusion: Proliferative markers, detected by immunohistochemistry, in lung tissue allowed recognizing a dichotomous distribution of HRCT fibrosis course and influenced pulmonary function tests, suggesting that they may be promising markers of prognosis in these patients. Objective: Epithelioid mesothelioma is the most common histologic type of the diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma, also having the best prognosis.

Results: The median survival of all 74 patients with epithelioid mesothelioma was 14.5 months. The best median survival was in trabecular and micropapillary subtypes (each 18 months, n=20 and n=5, respectively), followed by tubulopapillary (17 months, n=18), microglandular (16 months, n=7) and solid (11 months, n=19) subtypes. The worst median survival was in pleomorphic subtype (5 months, n=5). Conclusion: Epithelioid type of diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma shows a great diversity of histological patterns that likely have an impact on the clinical outcome and patient's survival. Further investigations of genetic variations among different subtypes may provide valuable information for better understanding of pathogenesis of these tumors. Objective: Genetic instability resulting in both aneuploidy and polyploidy are discussed to be involved in prostate cancer (PCa) development and progression. Aim of this study was to comprehensively characterize the ploidy status and proliferation levels in PCa with regard to disease progression. Method: Using FISH, we assessed 112 localized PCa, 75 PCa with 125 corresponding lymph node metastases, and 42 hormone-refractory distant metastases for losses and gains of all 24 chromosomes. The proliferation rate was assessed using pHH3 and Ki67 immunohistochemistry. Results: We observed significant increases in aneuploidy with advancing tumor stage (p<0.05). Chromosomes X, 21, Y, 14, 16, and 8 were most frequently numerically altered. Increased levels of proliferation were significantly associated with the extent of aneuploidy and tumor stage (p<0.01). Combining aneusomy of chromosomes 4, 6, 20, and X with PHH3 immunoreactivity resulted in a prediction model for lymph node metastases with a sensitivity of 73.3 % and a specificity of 72.6 %. Conclusion: We present evidence that genomic instability leading to aneuploidy is an important factor in PCa progression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that increased Ki-67 and PHH3 expression are potential indicators of metastatic disease. Lastly, we suggest a new approach to preoperatively determine lymph node metastasized disease in PCa.",

Here, we are the first to compare the mouse ERG-MAb to the rabbit ERG-MAb for their concordance on the same PCa cohort. Furthermore, we assessed if the ERG protein expression is conserved in lymph node and distant metastases. Method: We evaluated tissue microarrays of 278 specimens containing 265 localized PCa, 29 lymph node, 30 distant metastases, and 13 normal prostatic tissues. We correlated the ERG protein expression with the ERG rearrangement status using an ERG break-apart fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) assay and IHC of both ERG antibodies. Results: ERG protein expression and ERG rearrangement status were highly concordant regardless of whether the mouse or rabbit ERG-MAb was used (97.8 % versus 98.6 %, respectively).

To detect this alteration, FISH is the method of choice. However, FISH harbors disadvantages for widespread adoption in clinical practice. Subsequently, the chromogenic in-situ hybridization (CISH) and the enzymatic metallography silver in-situ hybridization (SISH) emerged as promising bright-field alternatives. We aimed to develop a combined CISH and SISH (CS-ISH) gene break-apart assay on the example of the ERG gene. Method: We assessed and compared 178 PCa and 10 benign specimens for their ERG rearrangement status applying a dual-colour FISH and CS-ISH ERG break-apart assay on consecutive sections. Results: We observed a highly significant concordance (97,7 %) between FISH-based and CS-ISH-based results (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.955, P<0.001). Conclusion: We demonstrate that the ERG rearrangement status can reliably be assesed by CS-ISH. Further, we confirm that the CS-ISH technique combines the accuracy and precision of FISH with the ease of bright field microscopy. We developed a tool which allows a broad spectrum of applicants to study the biological role and clinical utilization of ERG rearrangements in PCa.

We intend to establish a comparison between the traditional prostate biopsy system (TS) and the prostate mapping system (MS). For this study, all biopsy slides and corresponding surgical specimens from 60 patients subjected to MS and 60 patients subjected to TS were reviewed. Gleason score, percentage of tumor present in prostatic tissue (expressed as small \u2264 5 %, medium 6-19 % and large \u226520 %) and presence of tumor in prostate apex and base were analyzed. Results: Comparing MS with TS, the correlation coefficient was 53,5 % and 31,9 % for Gleason score and 46,9 % and 37,4 % for the percentage of tumor present in prostatic tissue, respectively.

Method: A tissue-microarray was constructed from 119 hormone-na\u00efve nodal positive, surgically treated prostate cancers containing samples from all Gleason patterns (GP) present in every primary tumor (PT) and corresponding lymph node metastases (MET). TMPRSS2-ERG status was determined by fluorescence in-situ hybridization and correlated with various histomorphological tumor features (Gleason score, stage, cancer volume, nodal tumor burden) and biochemical recurrence-free, cancer-specific and overall survival. Results: TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was present in 43.5 % (homogeneous 25.2 %, heterogeneous 18.3 %) of the PT and in 29.9 % (homogeneous 28.7 %, heterogeneous 1.2 %) of the MET. Percentage of TMPRSS2-ERG in GP3/4/5 of PT and MET were: 38 %/37 %/24 % and 23 %/30 %/39 %. Concordance in TMPRSS2-ERG status between PT and MET was poor (Kappa 0.39) showing 20.9 % and 8.1 % of cancers with gene fusion solely in the PT and MET, respectively. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was not correlated with histopathological tumor features and predicted late biochemical recurrence independently (p=0.041) when present in PT. Conclusion: TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in PT is more frequent and its distribution more heterogeneous compared to MET. The gene fusion in primary tumors independently predicts late biochemical recurrence.",

The goal of this study is to investigate the expression profile of WNT and SHH pathway proteins in PC, characterizing the expression of target proteins from WNT (Wnt-1, Wnt-2, Wnt-2 Gsk3\u03b2, \u03b2-catenin, D1 Cyclin, MMP7, C-myc, CD44) and SHH (Shh, Smo, Gli, EGFR) pathways. Method: For that, 18 samples of PC were obtained from the files of Anatomic Pathology department from A.C. Camargo Hospital (Brazil) and submitted to immunohistochemistry. Results: We observed that Wnt-1 and Wnt-2 were expressed in 15 and 16 cases, respectively, out of the 18 evaluated samples. Strong Shh expression was detected in 16/18 cases, whereas weak and negative expression was seen only in one case each. Smo and Gli-1 proteins were expressed in almost all cases (17/18), and also D1 Cyclin, b-catenin and EGFR were frequently expressed.

Its expression is regulated in an androgen dependent manner, possibly modulated by forkhead box A (FoxA), an androgen receptor (AR) co-activator. Therefore, we investigated its expression in a large cohort of neoplastic and non-neoplastic prostate tissues (n = 441) and evaluated its prediction of PSA relapse free survival (RFS). Method: TMA (n=441) stained for MRP4, FoxA, AR, ER, PSA, Ki-67: radical prostatectomies (RPE) (n=332), castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (n=26), metastases (n=39) and non-neoplastic (n=187). PSA-RFS of 258 patients; mean 70 months. Results: MRP4 expression decreases with tumor progression into castrate resistant disease, correlates with PSA, AR and FoxA expression and inversely correlates with Gleason score. Moreover, a strong MRP4 expression is significantly associated with a longer PSA RFS in RPE patients. Normal tissues from the transitional zone show a weak MRP4 expression compared to the peripheral and central zones. Conclusion: MRP4 expression seems to predict PSA relapse free survival in prostate cancer patients. Since its expression is androgen dependent it decreases with tumor progression into CRPC.",

Method: A total of 18 cases of coexistent renal neoplasia and AML in non-TS patients were identified. Clinico-pathological features were studied. Results: 18 patients: 10 M/8 F (mean age 62,77 year; range: 35-83) . Mean AML size: 0,82 cm (range: 0,2-3,4). The main size of the renal neoplasms was 5,09 cm (range 1,2-15). AML morphology: 6 leiomyomatous, 4 classic-triphasic, 4 lipomatous, and 4 epithelioid. Three cases had multifocal AML. 15 cases had ipsilateral tumors associated with AML: 6 CCRCC (1 sarcomatoid), 4 ChRCC, 1 RO, 1 TFE3 RCC, 1 hybrid (RO-ChRCC) renal-cell tumor, 1 urothelial carcinoma, and 1 case had 2 tumors: MTSC-RCC and concomitant PRCC. 2 cases had contralateral tumours associated with AML: 1 ChRCC and 1 RO. One patient had bilateral tumors associated with AML: an ipsilateral RO and a contralateral CCRCC. The median follow-up was 36,85 mths (range 0,4-199,8) : all patients were alive without disease. Conclusion: The coexistence of renal tumors with AML is a rare event, usually incidental. If AML is found incidentally together with other renal tumors, it is important to exclude TS retrospectively.",

We studied the clinicopathological, immunohistochemical (IHC) and molecular genetic features of 16 well-characterized R-SS. Method: All available slides for 16 institutional and consultation cases of R-SS were reviewed. An IHC panel (TLE1, BCL2, cytokeratins, S100, CD34, INI1) was performed. RT-PCR for SS18-SSX1/2 or FISH for SS18 rearrangement was performed. Follow-up was obtained. Results: The patients (9 M, 7 F) ranged from 17 to 78 years (mean 46). All tumors were of monophasic fibrous type. IHC results: all cases were strongly positive for TLE1 and BCL2; focally positive or negative for cytokeratins; negative for S100 and CD34; and showed retained INI1 expression. Molecular genetic results were: SS18-SSX1 (5 cases), SS18-SSX2 (10 cases), SYT rearrangement (1 case). Follow-up (5 cases): 3 dead of disease, 2 alive without disease. Conclusion: Our data show a striking overrepresentation of the SS18-SSX2 fusion subtype among R-SS, in contrast to other SS, in which the SS18-SSX1 fusion subtype accounts for two-thirds of cases. The reasons for this difference are unclear. The prognosis for R-SS appears similar to that of SS of more common locations. Objective: New data related to the diagnosis and therapy of lung cancer have also affected the position of the pathologist in this area. Principal changes in its classification have appeared in relation to adenocarcinoma and partly also in the large cell type of lung cancer. Method: Presented data represent a five-year retrospective study of a series of 546 cases of lung cancers analyzed in our Institute. Besides routine HE staining the following immunohistochemical reactions were used: antibody against TTF-1, Surfactant A, Chromogranin, Synaptophysin, CK7, AE1/AE3, p63, 34\u03b2E12, CD56 and Napsin A. Results: Using the WHO, 2004 Classification of Lung Cancer, an unusual phenomenon of the return of squamous cell cancer (SCC) prevalence over adenocarcinoma has been documented, which in the earlier years has equated the SCC. The difference in obtaining the tissue samples, and changes in the geographical origin of certain patients of Eastern Slovakia may partly explain these differences. Though the new Travis classification (J Thorac Oncol, 2011) was not used, there prevailed mixed forms also in our series. Conclusion: It is important to respect new information regarding the Classification of Lung Cancer, especially in the category of adenocarcinoma. The constructive collaboration of pathologists with clinicians is recommended. Objective: Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma MALT lymphoma and carcinoid are neoplasms occurring most frequently in the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory system. Although each of them occurs relatively frequently and separately, the simultaneous appearance of these two neoplasms is exceptionally rare. Method: We report an exceptional synchronous association of MALT lymphoma and typical carcinoid in the lung. Results: A 52-year-old male with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome presented with cough and chest pain with no improvement after antibiotherapy. Bronchial fibroscopy was normal. Computed tomography showed a diffuse interstitial pneumopathy with a persistent left lower lobe nodule suspected of malignancy. A surgical resection of the nodule was achieved. Histopathologically, it measuring 1.2 cm in diameter and was composed of association of malt lymphoma and typical carcinoid tumor which were focally admixed. Immunohistochemical stains were strongly reactive to endocrine marker in carcinomatous component. Tumor cells were diffusely CD20 positive in lymphomatous component. Assessment of extent of lymphoma revealed a gastric location. The patient received chemoptherapy. He's still alive since 8 months. Conclusion: The best of our knowledge, this is the first report of such a collision lung tumor at the same anatomical site. The aim of this study is to describe the pathogenesis and clincicopathological feartures of such exceptional association. Objective: Primary mucoepidermoid carcinoma is rare comprise less than 1 % of all lung tumors. It is characterized by the presence of squamoid cells, mucin-secreting cells and intermediate type. On the basis of morphological and cytological features, it is divided into low and highgrade types. Method: We report a retrospective study of 15 cases diagnosed during a 15-year period. Diagnosis was made by histological examination of specimen obtained from lobectomy in 13 cases and pneumonectomy in 2 cases. No patient had history of salivary mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Results: There were 13 men and 2 women ranging in age from 10 to 76 years. Computed tomography showed a well circumscribed tumor arising in bronchus in all cases. A bronchial fibroscopy showed a main, lobar or segmental mass. Bronchial biopsy revealed a non-small-cell carcinoma in only one case. Histologically, tumors were classified into 7 low grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma and 8 high grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Patients with low grade carcinoma remain alive after surgery alone. Patients with high grade carcinoma received chemotherapy, four of them developed distance metastasis. Conclusion: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a rare primary malignancy of the tracheobronchial tree which is difficult to diagnose by limited biopsy. The prognosis is variable and depends upon the histological grade. Objective: Primary pulmonary MALT lymphoma is considered to originate from MALT of the bronchus secondary to autoimmune or inflammatory processes. Although, it comprises more than two-thirds of all primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the lungs, it is a rare entity and accounts for less than 1 % of all lymphomas. Method: We report a retrospective study of 6 cases of Malt pulmonary lymphomas diagnosed during an 8-year period. Diagnosis was made on surgical pulmonary biopsy in 2 cases, bronchial biopsy in 3 other cases and on lobectomy in one case. Results: There were 4 women and 2 men ranging in age from 48 to 74 years. Two patients had a history of Sjoren's syndrome and one had a history of previous mammary carcinoma. Computed tomography revealed bilateral nodules in 3 patients, lung mass in 2 patients and an area of consolidation in one patient. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed bronchial stenosis in only 3 cases. Morphologically, the neoplasms had features typical of MALT lymphoma. One patient was treated with surgery alone and 5 received chemotherapy. Five patients remained alive while one patient presented with recurrence. Conclusion: Pulmonary MALT lymphomas are characterized by an important dissociation between clinical expression and radiological pattern. Therefore, histological documentation is mandatory to ensure diagnosis. Objective: Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive tumour with a poor prognosis. Carbonic anhydrases and their inhibitors offer an opportunity for developing novel anticancer drugs, as well as diagnostic and prognostic tools. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is a membranous metalloenzyme involved in cell adhesion and pH homeostasis. It is a direct target of hypoxia-inducible factor and serves as a marker of hypoxia. This study was designed to assess systematically CAIX expression in MM of pleura and peritoneum, and their benign counterparts. Method: 47 MMs of pleura (41 epithelioid, 1 biphasic, 2 sarcomatoid) and peritoneum (3 epithelioid), and 14 normal or reactive pleural samples were analyzed. CAIX expression was determined using immunohistochemistry. Membranous immunoreactivity was evaluated semiquantitatively. Specimens were divided into five subgroups according to the staining pattern and intensity. Results: 95,7 % (45/47) of MMs expressed CAIX. All epithelioid mesotheliomas showed at least a weak focal (8,5 %, 4/47), but predominantly a strong diffuse (70,2 %, 33/47) staining with CAIX antibody, without any perinecrotic pattern. Sarcomatoid mesotheliomas were negative. Normal mesothelial cells were diffusely positive. Conclusion: These data suggest that mechanisms of CAIX overexpression in MM are different than due to hypoxia and appear promising in prospective use of specific therapeutic CAIX targeting in advanced mesothelioma. Objective: EML4-ALK crizotinib therapy needs validation at lower cost and rapid answer in Pathology routine. Method: Histological/WHO 2004 and CK7, TTF1, CK5.6, CD56/chromogranin and vimentin panel classifications with ALK (clone 5A4, Novocastra Laboratories Ltd, Newcastle, United Kingdom) were applied to paraffin sections of 35 bronchial-pulmonary carcinomas: 20 adenocarcinomas, 6 epidermoid carcinomas, 4 pleomorphic carcinomas (mixed type adenocarcinomas with large/giant/fusiform cells), 4 neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) (1 combined large cell NEC with adenocarcinoma and 2 with epidermoid carcinomas; 1 SCLC chromogranin positive combined with adenocarcinoma) and 1 adenosquamous carcinoma. Results: The applied antibodies specified bronchial pulmonary carcinomas subtypes clearly. In 3 over 60 years old nonsmoking females mixed type adenocarcinomas ALK expression was over 50 %: acinar, solid, micropapillary and microacinar patterns; one glandular mucinous pattern (mucinous BA pattern) and one BA pattern, all expressing TTF-1. Conclusion: In this study, 3/20 adenocarcinomas of older women had ALK protein expression, only one with a mucinous pattern. As protein positivity cases comprise a lower number, FISH described by S. Lantuejoul seems to be the most appropriate method. It is now necessary to decide whether KRAS and EGFR mutations have to be determined together and/or select TTF-1 positive adenocarcinomas (from terminal respiratory unit) raised by this approach.

            "text": "The 5 year survival of bronchial-pulmonary carcinomas remains poor, between 6 % and 14 %/men and 7 % to 18 %/women. Treatment orientation is influenced by clinical staging and morphological classification in biopsies of 70 % of the cases. Method: This study comprised 41 surgical specimens where we compared immunohistochemistry in-between Adenocarcinomas (18), Epidermoid Carcinomas (12) and the heterogeneous groups of Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (3), Small Cell Lung Cancer (1), Large Cell Carcinoma (2), Adenosquamous Carcinoma (2) and Pleomorphic Carcinomas (3) with Max 18 F-Fluordesoxiglucose (FDG), a clinical parameter based in PET to preview diagnosis and prognosis. Results: We found significant differences (p=0.028) between TTF-1 positive and negative Adenocarcinomas where the 18 F-FDG capture was lower in TTF-1 positive cases, indicating lower metabolic activity. TTF-1 negative Adenocarcinomas have similar and higher metabolic activity as Epidermoid Carcinomas. The other histological types have FDG capture similar in between the two defined groups. Conclusion: Immunohistochemical and 18 F-FDG analysis correlate with clinical differences between Adenocarcinomas and Epidermoid Carcinomas, where TTF-1 negative Adenocarcinomas are biologically similar to Epidermoid Carcinomas, requiring a different medical approach as well as molecular pathology particular interpretation. These results strain the classification of bronchial TTF-1 negative Adenocarcinomas because they are different from the terminal respiratory unit TTF-1 positive Adenocarcinomas. Objective: According to researchers pneumonias are characterized by increase number of alveolar macrophages population after increased migration of monocytes from bone marrow and blood into the alveolar space. Method: We examined 60 observations of pneumonia with bacteriological, histological and blood monocytes examination in all cases. Bacteriological study was performed at the Institute of antimicrobial chemotherapy. Histological examination was performed in the Smolensk regional institute of pathology. Results: In the foci of pneumonias we discovered mainly mixed gram positive and gram negative microorganisms. Ten observations were characterized by an increase in the absolute number of blood monocytes. Fifty observations did not reveal excess levels of blood monocytes. In all cases with an increase in the number of blood monocytes, gram negative bacteria were isolated. In cases with normal number of blood monocytes some of the microorganisms were gram positive. Conclusion: Gram negative bacteria result in activation of the monocytes and their entry from the bone marrow into the blood more than gram positive bacteria. Objective: Bronchial carcinoids and schwannomas are uncommon, slowly growing, low-grade neoplasms. Carcinoid tumors are thought to arise from neuroendocrine/Kulchitsky's cells of bronchial epithelium. Schwannomas are thought to originate from schwann cells. Clinically they may be asymptomatic or present with non resolving recurrent pneumonia, hemoptysis, respiratory distress. Conclusion: We present two cases of respiratory distress in two teenage patients.",

Basar * Duzce University, Dept. of Pathology, Turkey Pulmonary hamartomas are usually found incidentally and they mimick metastic tumours. We report a case of a 47 year-old man who admitted to Chest Disease service for cough. He had laryngectomy operation formerly and diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma. Chest-X-ray and computed tomography revealed pulmonary nodules. It was removed but there was not metastatic carcinomas. This case was presented because it can be difficult to make diagnosis when the patient has malignancy. Objective: Experimental models of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) has been proposed and its later phase tend to the resolution in different degrees depending on the drug/ strain/inflammatory-pattern. Thus the maintenance of these mechanisms may participate in the PF-progression. Our objective was to determine the immune-fibroticpattern in models of pulmonary fibrosis in the late stage (21d). Method: Distinct animal models were used, including Balb/c, C57BL/6 and IL17RA-KO-C57BL/6 mice by Bleomycin and Paraquat. We analyzed the amounts of total peribronchiolar-interstitial collagen (TPC-TIP) by picrosirius and Col3-Col5 by immunofluorescence through the morphometric evaluation. These data were validated by RT-PCR. Results: The TPC did not differ between the treated groups. TIC was higher in the C57BL/6 strain, independent of the absence of IL-17RA. The Col5-immunoexpression was higher in control and BLM-treated IL17RA-KO-C57BL/6 than in wild-mice and lower in BLM-Balb/c mice. The Col3immunoexpression was higher in BLM-Balb/c. Likewise, the Col5 gene expression was higher in the IL17RA-KO mice and lower in the BLM-Balb/c. Conclusion: The perpetuation of fibrosis in PF-susceptiblemice can be modulated by IL-17-dependent Col5-hiperexpression and by Col3-subexpression. This suggests that Col5 is an important component responsible for the development of PF.",

Skarda * Palacky University, Pathology, Olomouc, Czech Republic Objective: An actin-binding protein Filamin A (FLNA) serves as a scaffold in various signaling pathways. Recently, it has been reported that FLNA interacts with BRCA1 protein and is required for efficient regulation of early stages of DNA repair processes. As DNA repair proteins are important prognostic markers for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, we aimed to investigate the role of FLNA protein expression in NSCLC, as well as its correlation with BRCA1 protein expression. Method: We performed a preliminary study of FNLA and BRCA1 protein expression in 50 NSCLC patients. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against FLNA C-terminus (EP2405Y, LSBio), BRCA1 N-termunus (MS110) and against phosphorilated forms of BRCA1 at ser1524 and ser1423 (Abcam). Staining intensity was estimated semi-quantitatively and correlated with all available clinico-pathological factors. Results: FLNA expression was significantly higher in cancer, compared to normal lung tissue. Positive correlation has been revealed between FLNA and BRCA1 phospho-ser1423 expression. Also, 5 year overall survival rate was higher in patients with strong FLNA expression. Conclusion: According to our preliminary study results the prognostic role of FLNA protein expression deserves to be a subject for further studies in patients with NSCLC.",

Murakami, M. Koss * Virginia Mason Medical Center, Pathology, Seattle, USA Objective: Pseudolymphomas of the skin, breast, and lacrimal glands show an increase in IgG4 positive plasma cells. We hypothesized that a similar increase in IgG4 positive plasma cells occurs in pulmonary nodular lymphoid hyperplasia (PNLH). Method: Immunohistochemical stains for IgG4 and IgG were performed in 2 cases of PNLH, 7 cases of BALT lymphoma, 8 cases of intraparenchymal lymph nodes (IPL) and 1 case of follicular bronchiolitis (FB). The mean number of IgG4-and IgG-positive plasma cells and the IgG4/IgG ratio was obtained from a manual count of three separate high power fields (hpfs) of areas of highest cellularity. Results: The average number of IgG4 positive plasma cells and the IgG4/IgG ratio was increased in PNLH (case 1: 225/hpf, ratio: 0.39, case 2: 280/hpf, ratio: 0.59). In comparison, average IgG4 positive plasma cells per hpf were much lower in BALT lymphoma (range=0-2.3/hpf, ratio=0-0.03), IPL (range IgG4/ hpf=0-102, ratio=0-0.23) and FB (1/hpf, ratio=0.03). Conclusion: The increase in IgG4 positive plasma cells and IgG4/IgG ratio in PNLH aids in diagnosis and supports our current understanding of PNLH as a distinct form of reactive lymphoid proliferation. The relationship between PNLH and IgG4-related sclerosing disease requires further study.",

The aim of our study was to identify the most specific and sensitive markers for the positive identification of mesothelioma. Method: Paraffin-embedded blocks from surgical material of 19 pleural epithelial mesotheliomas and 22 pulmonary adenocarcinomas were retrieved from the files in our department. The primary antibodies used in each case were the following: antibody anticalretinin, EMA; CEA, BerEP4, TTF-1 and CD15. Results: Of the mesotheliomas, 100 % stained for calretinin, 63.2 % for CK5/6, 78.9 % stained for EMA and AE1/AE3. Of the lung adenocarcinomas, 9.1 % cases showed reactivity for calretinin, 27.3 % for CK5/6, 77.3 % for CD 15, all for TTF-1, 50 % for CEA, 59.1 % for Ber-EP4, 90.1 % for EMA, and all for AE1/AE3. Conclusion: Calretinin were the highly specific positive mesothelial markers, whereas CK 5/6 showed high sensitivity but low specificity. Among negative markers, we advocate the use of TTF-1, CEA and CD15 which were the most specific in differentiating mesotheliomas from adenocarcinomas.",

Method: Analysis was done on 24 consecutive surgical specimens of NSCLC fixed in Paxgene tissue system. Relative quantification of COX-2 mRNA expression was performed by quantitative RT-PCR using intron-spanning primer-probe set. COX-2 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Scoring was performed using an intensity-extent system, both parameters on the scale 0-3 and multiplied to give IHC index. Results: There were 12 cases of adenocarcinoma, 11 cases of squamous cell carcinoma and one typical carcinoid. COX-2 mRNA expression was detectable in all specimens. The median COX-2 mRNA expression value, normalized against he internal reference gene GADPH, was 0,53 (range 0,08-12,49). We observed cytoplasmic and membranous immunohistochemical reaction patterns. Average IHC index was 3,8. There was positive correlation between mRNA and protein COX-2 expression (R2=0,31). Adenocarcinoma cases had average relative mRNA expression value 2,45 and IHC index 5,08, while squamous cell carcinoma had average relative mRNA expression value 0,67 and IHC index 2,73. Conclusion: COX-2 is expressed in NSCLC with various IHC reaction patterns. Adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma have different COX-2 expression levels. Objective: The Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is up-regulated in many human cancers, and agents targeting the mTOR pathway are in various stages of clinical development and application. Method: Expression of pAkt and mTOR was studied by immunohistochemical analysis of 574 surgically resected nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens on a tissue microarray (TMA). Results: The results were correlated with clinicopathological features. Expression of mTOR showed a strong correlation with the expression of pAkt (p<0.001) and was significantly associated with female gender, tumor size \u22643 cm, adenocarcinoma (ADC), non-smoker status, and lower pathological stage. Expression of pAkt was correlated with older age (\u2265 65), ADC, non-smoker status, and lower T stage. Univariate survival analysis revealed that the mTOR and pAkt positive group had a significantly longer cancer-specific survival than the mTOR and pAkt negative group (p=0.038 and p=0.024, respectively). Coexpression of pAkt and mTOR correlated with better prognosis than either single or double negative pAkt and mTOR groups (p=0.016). However, multivariate analysis proved that mTOR and pAkt expression are not independent prognostic factors for cancer-specific survival. Conclusion: Expression of pAkt and mTOR expression is more significantly associated with ADC than squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and expression of these proteins is associated with better prognosis.",

Because of their role in cell transformation, they become therapeutic targets. They have important roles in cell survival, cell proliferation and cell migration. They affect cell growth and tumor invasion. Method: 175 cases with NSCLC reported in Gaziantep University Pathology Department between 2000 and 2010, reviewed retrospectively. Immunohistochemically nuclear and cytoplasmic PAK 6 stainings were considered positive and scored according to degree of staining. Results: Our cases included 110 squamous cell carcinoma, 49 adenocarcinoma, 9 adeno squamous carcinoma and 7 large cell carcinoma. There was no significantly associated between tumor types and PAK6 staining. 38 of 175 patients showed recurrence and of 23 cases showed nuclear staining but there were no statistically significance (p:0,267). 31 cases died from the disease and in 21 of these cases nuclear stainig was very intresting, inspite of statistical results. Conclusion: In this study PAK 6 staining patern and score were compared with tumor type, size, recurrence, mortality and lymph node involvement in NSCLC. And we found no statistically significance. 150 of 175 case with NSCLC stained with PAK 6. These results suggest that PAK 6 was expressed in lung like prostat, plasenta and breast.",

Our aim was to verify whether elastic deposition accompanies collagen deposition in the repairing process of chronic lung injury. In this work we studied the distribution of these fibrous components of VP in bullous disease type I and II, smoking-related interstitial fibrosis and usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). Method: We employed histochemical methods on conventional histological slides. We measured, by image analysis, the content of fibres of the collagenous and elastic systems of the visceral pleura in histological slides sampled from surgical lung biopsies and bullectomy, using the picrosirius-polarization method and Weigert's resorcin-fuchsin stain, respectively. Results: Four groups were studied: I, 7 patients with spontaneous pneumothorax due to type I bullous disease; II, 12 patients with spontaneous pneumothorax due to type II bullous disease; III, 5 smoking-related interstitial fibrosis; and IV, 5 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The first two groups were used as controls. Patient diagnosed with Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (2009), in which experimental transplantation was performed of type II pneumocytes, ingress to the hospital for further study groundmass of the right lung. In the postmortem study a 2340 gr. mass was identified, the mass was formed by sarcomatous cells habit, undifferentiated and pleomorphic, with the presence of multiple implants and adhesions in rib cage, diaphragm, pericardial fat. IHC profile was performed: vimentin (+), EMA focally (+), WT1, CK8, TTF1, CKAE1/AE3, S100, CD34, CD31 and CD45 (\u2212) and low proliferation index, the diagnosis undifferentiated malignant tumor. With inconclusive IHC profile, so blocks were sent to Clinic Barcelona Hospital, for study. The estimated prevalence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is 20 cases per 100,000 population in men, with a mortality of 50 % at 5 years of diagnosis. Cancer rate of in transplanted patients is within the range between 4 % and 18 %. Could the appearance of this tumor be related either to transplanted pneumocytes or it is inmunosupression the main risk factor? Current treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are not effective, which requires the study and development of new therapeutic options, using fibroblast proliferation inhibitors, as well as prospective studies, in the long term, the evolution of these patients and the development of secondary entities to it. Objective: Mediastinal hemangiomas are rare tumors accounting for 0,5 % of all mediastinal tumors. These tumors are challenging because of the lack of clinical and radiologic specific signs. Their diagnosis is mainly based on microscopic study. Method: We report a 10-year-experience of a single institution. We describe 5 cases of mediastinal hemangioma. Results: Our study contained 2 men and 3 women with a mean age of 60.4 years. Symptoms consisted mainly in chest pain. Neurologic signs were observed in 2 patients. Surgical treatment was performed in all patients dealing with a total resection in 4 patients. The most used surgical approach was a posterolateral thoracotomy. Video-assisted thoracic excision was tried in one patient and was converted into a median sternotomy. Microscopic examination concluded to a mediastinal hemangioma in all cases. All the patients presented no complications after a follow up periods varying from 9 months to 2 years. Conclusion: Mediastinal hemangiomas are rare tumors whose diagnosis is based on microscopic findings. Their surgical management may be challenging because of their connection to the adjacent structures. Video-assisted thoracic excision is being more frequently used by experienced surgeons. These tumors are benign with a good behavior. Objective: Actinomycosis is an infectious disease caused by Actinomyce israeli in 85 % of the cases. It is mainly observed in alcoholic patients and affects mainly cervicofacial, abdominal and thoracic regions. Pulomnary actinomycosis accounts for 15 % of the localizations and is caused by the inhalation of septic particles causing granulomatous lesions, the extension to the adjacent organs and a cutaneous fistulae. It represents a real pitfall and mimics malignant lesions, tuberculosis or other infectious diseases. Method: We report a retrospective study about 6 cases of pulmonary actinomycosis diagnosed over a 17-year-period. Results: We describe the cases of 6 men aged between 35 and 46 years who presented with respiratory signs. Radiologic investigations showed in all cases parenchymal masses with irregular margins mimicking malignant processes. Positivie diagnosis was based on microscopic examination. The treatment was based on surgical excision associated to a medical treatment without complications after a follow up period ranging from 3 months to 18 months. Conclusion: Pulmonary actinomycosis shares usually the same clinical and radiologic features as malignant lesions.",

In this regard, the myofibroblasts and the ECM components such as collagen and hyaluronan (HA) have an important role in the fibrosis. We analyzed the expression of HAS1 (HA synthase 1), HAS2, HAS3 and hyaluronic acid receptor (CD44) by epithelial and myofibroblasts cells in patients with IPF and we correlated with a survival. Method: HAS-1, HAS2, HAS3 and CD44 epithelial and myofibroblast expression were evaluated in 27 surgical lung biopsies from patients with IPF in minimal and severe fibrosis by the point-counting technique. Impact of these markers was tested on pulmonary functional tests and follow-up until death from IPF. Results: HAS2 and CD44 expression were significantly increased and directly associated with severe fibrosis. Myofibroblast HAS2 activity was indirectly associated to DLO/VA (r= \u22120.584; p=0.05). Kaplan Maier curves determined a higher risk of death for patient with high HA2 (>6.83 %) expression than in low expression (Log Rank p=0.05, Figure) . Conclusion: The increased HAS-2 activity in epithelial and myofibroblast cells have impact in the remodeling process and the survival evolution, suggesting that strategies aimed at preventing the effect of this ECM component may have a greater impact in patient's outcome.

Method: Biopsy samples from 13 patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IPF); 8 patients with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP); 13 patients with acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP) and 4 patients with idiopathic cetrilobular fibrosis (ICLF) were used to investigate by microarray and immunohistochemistry the presence of measles virus (MV), hepatitis-C virus (HCV), adenovirus (ADV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes I and II viruses (HVI and HVII). Results: We detected the epithelial alveolar infection by MV and CMV in 30.8 % and 15.4 % in AIP, respectively. Endothelial CMV infection was observed in 25 % of ICLF group. When we compared with the age of these patients, patients with \u2264 of 43 years old had more infection by MV and CMV than the group with \u2265 72 years old.

However, underdiagnosis risk in cytological suspicious cases is high, which makes the cytological diagnosis quite limited. This is an important clinical problem, especially if we consider that some patients, in bad clinical conditions, can not be submitted to a guided thoracoscopic biopsy. Method: Using multiplex ligation probe-dependent amplification (P315-MRC-Holland) we have studied sequence variations of EGFR gene and amplifications/deletions of chromosomal regions frequently associated to tumors (ATG4B, PAHs, PROS, NSD1, and CDGIF genes). Results: Forty-three malignant PF samples from patients with different cancers were evaluated, even in those cases with scarce pellet cells. Four benign pleural effusions were used as control. Gene sequence changes were observed in 13 (30.2 %) cases, while others copy number abnormalities were found in 19 (44.2 %). Conclusion: The findings suggest that MLPA could be considered an alternative tool to detect molecular genetic changes in malignant pleural effusions, since this technique is relatively low expensive and not time consuming. Our next challenge is to find the best combination of probes capable to recognize malignant cells of any origin in fresh samples of PF.",

Mean size was 26 mm (range 15-45 mm). All tumors were located within the right lung (upperlobe: 1; middle-lobe: 2; lower-lobe: 2). All cases showed solid, papillary, sclerotic, and hemorrhagic patterns. The tumors were composed of 2 cells types: pale polygonal and surface cells. EMA, TTF1, and PR were observed in both type cells. The surface cells showed also positivity for CK7, Napsin-A, and surfactant-A, whereas the polygonal cells for vimentin. Surface cells had short microvilli and lamellar bodies in their cytoplasm. Polygonal cells contained abundant microfilaments and rough endoplasmic reticulum. All patients were alive and well without recurrence at the last follow up. Conclusion: LP is likely to be an epithelial tumor with a differentiation toward type II pneumocytes, which exhibits various architectural patterns.

Results: Six patients were men and two patients were women with an age range of 50 to 70 years. Most of the lesions were symptomatic and discovered as small masses by bronchoscopy. The tracheobronchial lesions varied from polypoid, nodular, well-demarcated, fragile masses to nodular thickenings. Microscopically, a polyp composed of a fibrovascular stroma with scattered mononuclear inflammatory cells was compatible with fibroepithelial polyp. Mature adipocyte proliferation in two cases, S-100 and CD68 positive polygonal or ovoid cells with abundant eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm having small, hyperchromatic nuclei, smooth muscle actin and desmin positive spindle cells in interlacing fascicles within a myxoid and collagenous stroma with mononuclear inflammatory cells, CD34 and CD31 positive thin-walled vascular channels, filled with red blood cells and S-100 positive spindle cells having palisading of wavy nuclei in two cases, located in the submucosa were main findings of lipoma, granular cell tumor, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, cavernous hemangioma and schwannoma, respectively. Conclusion: Tracheobronchial biopsies, even with small fragments of lesions can allow to render rare specific histopathological diagnoses, some of which need to be confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Objective: Small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC) are aggressive neoplasms that give very early distant metastases. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of endopeptidases which degrade extracellular matrix and modulate cell adhesion, playing a crucial role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis. The aim of the present study is to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 (type IV collagenases) and MMP-1 (interstitial collagenase) in patients with SCLC. Method: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung biopsy specimens from 40 patients with SCLC (M:F=29:11, median age=66.7) were immunostained for MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9 (anti-MMP-1 polyclonal antibody, anti-MMP-2 72 kDa Collagenase IV antibody, anti-MMP-9 92 kDa Collagenase IV antibody, Spring Bioscience). Results: Immunohistochemical expression of MMPs was detected in the cytoplasm of neoplastic cells. Immunoreactivity was designated positive when >10 % of neoplastic cells were stained. Overall, MMPs were expressed in the majority of SCLC. Specifically, MMP-1 was positive in 90 % (36/40), MMP-2 in 87.5 % (35/40) and MMP-9 in 82.5 % (33/40) of SCLC. Non-neoplastic lung parenchyma did not stain for MMPs. Conclusion: The majority of SCLC express immunohistochemically MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-1. Given the role of MMPs in cancer progression and metastasis, their expression in SCLC may contribute to their aggressive course. Objective: Number of pulmonary adenocarcinoma (ADC) patients incresease. Treatment of non-small cell pulmonary carcinoma depends of its histological type in era of target molecular therapy particulary of ADC: Diagnosis of ADC is established on small-sized pulmonary biopsies obtained on bronchoscopy and by transthoracic needle pulmonary biopsy. The aim of this study was to evaluate optimal panel of monoclonal antibodies in diagnosis of pulmonary ADC on small-sized biopsy pulmonary samples. Method: Analysis of 50 small-sized biopsy pulmonary samples. Diagnosis of ADC was established on hematoxillyn-eosin stained (H&E) samples and confirmed immunohistochemicaly by Thyreoid Transcription Factor-1 (TTF-1), Napsin-A, Surfactant B and Cytokeratin7 (CK7). Descriptive statistical method (%) was used. Results: TTF-1 specificity was 86 %(43/50), Napsin-A-82 %(41/50), SurfactantB -56 %(28/50) and CK7-90 %(45/50) in ADCs. Two monoclonal antibodies were positive in 24 % (12/50) ADCs, one of them was necessary TTF-1 or Napsin-A. Three monoclonal antibodies were positive in 40 %(20/50) and 4 in 36 %(18/50) ADCs, respectively. There is not statistical significans in number of monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis of ADC. Conclusion: No one monoclonalantibody is specific for one histological type of carcinoma and its origin. TTF-1, Napsin-A, SurfactantB and CK7 belong in optimal panel for diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma.",

The expression of CD44, E-Cadherin and Bcl-2 was analysed by immunohistochemistry and evaluated semiquantitatively. Results: The intensity of Bcl-2 expression was highest in small cell cancer, reaching the mean value 2.25. No or very low Bcl-2 expression was found in adenocarcinoma, carcinoid and squamous cell cancer. The membranous expression of E-Cadherin showed significantly higher mean intensity in adenocarcinoma (1.93) and carcinoid (1.90) than in small cell cancer (0.14) and squamous cell cancer (0.85). Cytoplasmic E-cadherin expression was observed in small cell cancer. CD44 expression was widespread and frequent in non-small cell lung cancer.

By definition; CD is a lymphoproliferative disorder of the mediastinal lymph nodes and extranodal tissues with follicular and interfollicular abnormalities. Pleural localization is an unusual presentation of CD. Method: A 27-year-old man applied to the hospital because of cough. Chest x-ray and CT images showed an irregular, 35\u00d756\u00d767 mm sized intrapleural-extrapulmoner mass in the paramediastinal region. Surgical specimen was consisting of a 7\u00d75\u00d73.5 cm sized, irregular-round shaped, gray colored calcified mass. Microscopically, a lymphoid proliferation with distorted follicles and increased dendritic cells (with CD21) was detected. Lymphocyte depleted germinal centers resembling \"onion skin\" appearance with penetrated sclerosing hyalinized blood vessels were also seen. Interfollicular region was composed of proliferating blood vessels lined by plump endothelial cells and few lymphoplasmositer infiltration. There was heterogeneous positivity with CD3 and CD20. Expanded mantle zones showed diffuse bcl2 positivity. Ki67 proliferation index was low. The mass was diagnosed as \"Castleman Disease, hyaline vascular type\". Typical appearance of the follicular and interfollicular abnormalities allowed definitive differentiation from mesothelioma and solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura. Conclusion: Pleural CD is a rare lesion but should be considered especially on young patients in the differential diagnosis of pleural masses. Objective: To evaluate FOXp3 expression in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) and correlate with the inflammatory process and collagen content in the lung tissue in an experimental model of scleroderma (SSc) after type V collagen (COL V)-induced nasal tolerance. Method: Female New Zealand rabbits (N=12) were immunized with 1 mg/ml of COL V in Freund's adjuvant (IM). After 150 days, six immunized animals were nasally tolerated with COL V (25 \u03bdg/day), during 60 days (IM-TOL). Animals (N = 6) only tolerated served as control (CT). FOXP3 expression in BALT and inflammatory cells in pulmonary interstitium were evaluated by point counting method. Types I, III and V collagen gene expression were evaluated by Real-time PCR. Results: IM-TOL when compared to IM presented decreased lymphocytes, macrophages and monocytes and types I (p=0,002) and V (p=0,009) collagen mRNA expression in pulmonary tissue. T lymphocytes FOXp3 were expressed in 100 % of IM-TOL and 33,3 % of CT (p= 0,03). Additionally, BALT was higher expressed in IM-TOL in relation to CT. Conclusion: COL V-induced nasal tolerance in SSc model induces FOXp3 regulatory T cells in BALT which can trigger an immune regulatory mechanism resulting in decreased inflammation and collagen expression. It suggests that COL V tolerance could be a promising therapeutic for human scleroderma treatment.",

Results: The lung tissue was irregulary fibrotic with dense lymfoplasmacytic infiltration concentrated in the walls of pulmonary arteries. Some arteries were obliterated by intimal fibrosis. Infiltrating lymphocytes were small and without atypias. The majority of lymphocytes were CD3 positive, nearly all plasmocytes showed IgG positivity. IgG4/IgG ratio was 60 %. EBER in situ hybridisation was negative and monoclonal reaarangement of T cell receptor or immunoglobulin heavy chain genes were not detected. Conclusion: IgG4-related lung disease is rare. Obliterative vasculitis and high percentage of IgG4 positive plasmocytes are main histological features of this entity. Objective: Primary lung carcinoma with heterotopic osteocartilaginous formation is exceedingly rare. To date only 38 cases have been reported in the literature and the pathogenesis is not fully investigated. We report a case of pulmonary adenocarcinoma with osteocartilaginous formation with immunohistochemical staining of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Method: A 59-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for a lung tumor in his left upper lobe. An open lung biopsy followed a lobectomy was done. The resected tissue was fixed with 10 % formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections, cut from paraffin blocks, were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and Masson-Goldner staining, in addition to immunohistochemical staining. Results: The tumor was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with heterotopic ossification. Some of the tumor cells were positive for BMP-2, 6, and 7. Some of mesenchymal cells in tumor interstitium were positive for osteoblast (OB)-cadherin or BMP receptor-IA. Conclusion: We report a case of primary lung adenocarcinoma with heterotopic osteocartilaginous formation and reviewed previously published reports. To our best knowledge, this was the first case that not only BMP was expressed in tumor cells but also OB-cadherin or BMP receptor in some mesenchymal cells of tumor interstitium.",

The present study investigates the prognostic significance of both markers in lung adenocarcinomas. Method: We evaluated, by immunohistochemistry, LIN28A and Oct-4A expression in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 92 lung adenocarcinomas. Immunoreactivity was scored as 1+, <1 % positive tumor cells (ptc); 2+, 1-5 % ptc; 3+, 5-10 % ptc; and 4+, >10 % ptc and was compared with clinicopathologic features and overall survival. Results: Regarding LIN28A expression 23 % of tumors were recorded as 1+, 51 % as 2+, 14 % as 3+ and 12 % as 4+. The stratification for Oct-4 expression was 19 % (1+), 50 % (2+), 23 % (3+) and 8 % (4+). LIN28A and Oct-4 expression was not significantly associated with age, gender and tumor grade or stage. LIN28A 4+ expression predicted a shorter overall survival (P<0.05) on univariate analysis. Oct-4 was not associated with patients' prognosis. Cox multivariate analysis showed that age, TNM and LIN28A 4+ expression were independent prognostic factors of survival. Conclusion: LIN28\u0391 expression appears to be an independent predictor of poor outcome in lung adenocarcinomas. Further studies are warranted in order to investigate its role in stratifying patients at increased risk for poor outcome.",

However, the mutation analyses were usually performed on the primary tumors only, due to the availability of the tumor tissue. Method: To compare the KRAS and EGFR mutation statuses between pulmonary adenocarcinomas and corresponding metastases, we performed direct sequencing, followed by Scorpion ARMS method on wild-type cases for EGFR analysis, and allele-specific real-time PCR for KRAS analysis, on the paired samples of pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Results: Thirty-one (63.3 %) pulmonary adenocarcinomas and 30 (61.2 %) brain metastases out of the 49 paired specimens have EGFR mutations, and 30 (61.2 %) paired specimens were concordant for the EGFR mutation status between the primary and metastasis. In addition, 17 (51.5 %) pulmonary adenocarcinomas and 17 (51.5 %) brain metastases out of the 33 paired specimens have KRAS mutations, and only 16 (48.5 %) paired specimens were concordant between the primary and the metastasis. Conclusion: The status of EGFR mutation is relatively consistent between primary and metastasis comparing to that of KRAS mutation in pulmonary adenocarcinomas. However, discordance for the mutation statuses does happen. Accordingly, repeat analysis is recommended if tissue from metastatsis or recurrence is available. Objective: We tried to measure and analyze characteristics of neuroendocrine tumors in lung by image analysis and help to diagnose them. Method: It was analysed that sixteen cases of typical carcinoid tumors, five cases of atypical carcinoid tumors, fifteen of small cell carcinomas, fifty one cases of large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas. We analyzed the nuclear area, perimeter, major axis and minor axis using i-solution image analyzer software package. Results: The mean nuclear area was 488.00 \u03bcm2 in the typical carcinoid tumors, 499.30 \u03bcm2 in the atypical carcinoid tumors, 481.48 \u03bcm2 in the small cell carcinomas, and 684.05 \u03bcm2 in the large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas. After the statistical results, every method was effective to distinguish large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma from other tumors and the circumferences of nucleus was the most effective to distinguish among them. Conclusion: Pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors were the nuclear morphologic differences of each tumors. Therefore, diagnosis that considers morphologic differences of pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors contributes to increase reproducibility and accuracy. Sunday, 9 September 2012, 09.30 -10.30 An abundant growth of lactobacilli may result in lysis of vaginal epithelial cells, named as Cytolytic Vaginosis. This cytolytic process may cause the symptoms as seen in candidiasis. We observed Pap smears to evaluate if cytolysis has a relationship with infertility. Method: In the Pathology department of Mardin Maternity Hospital, 2011-2012 period, we examined Pap smear cases suffering from the similar syptoms as candidiasis. Of the 4672 smears, 82 were diagnosed as \"Cytolytic Vaginosis\". No growth was observed in cultures. Results: The number of the cases suffering from the infertility was 261 (%5.58) among 4672 cases. In the cytolytic vaginosis group this ratio was %32.9 (n=27). The ratio of the infertil cases of cytolytic vaginosis group over general population was significantly higher (p<0.05). Conclusion: Our results are in favour of supporting the hypothesis of the relation between cytolytic vaginosis and infertility. Lactobacilli are thought to have inhibitive role in fertility by changing the vaginal ph and adhering to the epithelial cells so inhibiting the sperm penetration.",

In this study, we investigated the origin of the many extraordinary fungal organisms seen on Pap smears in series in only a few months. Method: In Pathology department of Mardin Maternity Hospital, we observed both smear and vaginal discharge materials, came from the same hospital but different clinicians, for 3 months. Results: 149 smears came from clinician A and 335 smears from clinician B. Curious fungal organisms with huge branching hyphas and macrochonidias were seen in 15 smears among 149 smears (2 Aspergillus and 4 Penicillium species were recognized morphologically). No growth was observed in cultures. Interestingly, among all 335 smears came from clinician B, there was no abnormal funguses. The smear samples with unusual fungal components all came from the same gynecologist. This made us strongly consider the probability of contamination. Conclusion: Penicillium and Aspergillus spp. are extremely rare in vaginal smears. In our study, these funguses are thought to be airborne passed from the thick layer of the mold spreading on the ceiling of the office. Objective: Nearly all cervical cancers are related to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Hybrid Capture 2 -HC2 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) is the method to determine the presence of high risk HPV (HR HPV) in cytology samples with the best clinical sensitivity. Method: In our study we compared the results of the HPV test in 742 ThinPrep\u00ae cervical samples using first HC2 and secondly Cervista (Hologic, Madison). Samples were divided in two groups for the statistical analysis. The first group were HSIL cases confirmed by biopsy (n =65) and the second group cytology samples reported as negative, ASC-US or LSIL (without biopsy or biopsy, not HSIL) (n=677). Results: Overall, concordance between the two techniques was 92 % (683/742). There were 23 cases HC2+ Cervista\u2212, and 36 cases HC2 \u2212Cervista+. The average HC2 viral load in discordant cases was 2.83. In our series the HC2 sensitivity for \u2265 CIN2 was 100 % (65/65) and the specificity was 85.4 % (578/677). Cervista results were 98.5 % (64/65) and 83.3 % (564/677), respectively. In the HSIL cases the coincidence was 98.5 % (64/65). Conclusion: Cervista results showed good clinical sensitivity and high concordance with HC2, with a slightly lower specificity. In conclusion, according to our data the determination of HPV with Cervista is comparable with HC2.",

Identification of a squamous component within a NSCLC is critical as it excludes anti-VEGF therapy. Likewise, recognition of an adenocarcinoma component is also relevant because it prompts the search for EGFR mutations. Since 70 % of lung cancers are diagnosed in small biopsies/cytological specimens, cytohistological correlation is crucial for correct diagnosis. Thus, we aimed at determining the relevance of combining cytologic and histologic findings in initial diagnostic workup of ASC. Method: We searched for cases of ASC diagnosed at our institution from March 2011 to April 2012. Cytologic and histopathologic findings were evaluated and their accuracy for diagnosing ASC was assessed. Results: Of 184 cases of lung cancer in biopsy, 11 (6 %) corresponded to probable ASC and in 9 cases cytologic examination was also performed. In 7 cases, cytology was not conclusive, but in 2 cases it demonstrated cytomorphological features of probable ASC. We emphasize one case in which only the squamous component was valued by histology, but cytology provided clues that prompted immunohistochemical analysis which led to the diagnosis of probable ASC. Conclusion: Cyto-histological correlation augments the diagnostic accuracy in ASC of the lung, emphasizing the complementarity of both procedures.",

Method: The biopsy specimen of the patient, a 45 year-old man with painfull, growing mass in his external auditory canal was interpreted as an adenoid cystic carcinoma. He was treated surgically and received post-operative radiotherapy. After 8 years, a distant metastasis relapse was observed. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest depicted multiple spiculated masses suggestive of metastases throughout both lung fields, the diameter of the largest measuring 2 cm. CT guided percutaneous transthoracic fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed from the largest lesion. Results: Cytological examination of the aspirates revealed large spherical hyaline globules representing basement membrane material surrounded by neoplastic cells. The cells were cohesive, closely packed, and had uniform round to oval hyperchromatic nuclei with scanty cytoplasm. These features were suggestive of an adenoid cystic carcinoma. Conclusion: Patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma could be frequently encountered with disease recurrence confined to the lung. Fine-needle aspiration cytology provided a conclusive diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma. Objective: Often some of a fine needle aspiration (FNA) sample is left behind in the hub of the needle when the specimen is ejected on the slides ( Figure 1A) . Method: We have designed a device that collects this material. It consists of a plastic adaptor that has a core of polyvinyl alcohol foam protruding from its lumen at one end ( Figure 1B) . The other end of the adaptor then fits on to the syringe (Figure 1 C) . As the FNA is being performed the sample material flows up the lumen of the needle's shaft and emerges into the hub of the needle where it is absorbed into the tip of the foam core ( Figure 1D ). Smears are made by ejected the specimen from the needle onto a slide by air pressure from an attached syringe. The air passes through the foam forcing some of the sample in the foam back down the needle but some remains behind. The device is then removed and placed in a formalin specimen pot. Once fixed the core is pulled from the adaptor ( Figure  1E ), processed and sectioned as for routine histology specimens ( Objective: The presence of DCs has been studied histologically in PTC, but their presence and potential diagnostic value in thyroid FNAs has not been evaluated. Method: We assessed the presence of DCs in cytological samples of histologically confirmed PTCs (n=31) and benign thyroid nodules (BTN) (n = 29) using CD1a. Corresponding PTCs (n=11) and BTN (n=10) from surgical excisions were stained with both CD1a and Langerin. Results: CD1a + DCs were identified in 30/31 PTCs on cytology (97 %). They were either isolated in the background or more typically closely associated with tumor cell clusters. The 3 PTC cases with the least DCs corresponded to the follicular variant on histology. In contrast, most BTN (69 %) lacked CD1a + DCs. When DCs were present, they were primarily isolated in the background although 5/29 cases (17 %) contained rare DCs among tumor cells. Tumor-infiltrating DCs and background DCs were both higher in PTCs than in BTN, but only the former was statistically significant (P<0.0001 and P=0.1173 respectively). Similar findings were found on histology where all PTCs contained CD1a + and Langerin + DCs while only 2/10 BTN (20 %) contained rare DCs. Conclusion: DCs are present in FNAs of PTC, typically among tumor cell clusters, while they were absent or rare in FNAs of BTN. Thus DCs may be useful as an additional diagnostic marker for PTC.",

Degeneration associated with atrophic vaginitis, hyperchromatic crowded groups, parabasal cells with organophilic cytoplasm or variations in nuclear size may be falsely interpreted as squamous atypia or even more severe lesion. Method: The study included 25 postmenopausal Papanicolaou patients (26 smears) with the initial cytological diagnosis of ASC-US or ASC-H. The smears were decolorized and immunostaining for p16(Ink4a) was applied. In 21 patients (22 smears) tissue biopsy and histological examination was performed and four ASC-US cases had cytological follow up only. Results: Among cases with histological examination positive p16 reaction was found in 17 patients (18 smears). The histological diagnoses were: CIN1 (3), CIN 1-2 (2), CIN2 (1 case), CIN3 (5 patients/6 smears), AIS (1 case) and invasive squamous carcinoma (2 patients). Two p16 positive patients with three smears and initial negative histology had CIN3 after 2 years. Among p16 negative patients there were two with CIN3 and two with normal histology. Four ASC-US patients without histological examination had normal cytological follow up. Conclusion: P16 is a useful marker in detecting of clinically significant cervical lesions in postmenopausal women.",

            "text": "Objective: Intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) of the pancreas are mucin-producing tumors recently recognized as a distinct entity among other mucinous pancreatic tumors. Endoscopic-ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is a sensitive technique which can be very useful in the accurate diagnosis of these neoplasms. Method: We present a case of a 30-year-old female with recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis and a 49-year-old male with abdominal pain. TC showed a 26 mm-cystic tumor at the uncinated process of the pancreatic head and cystic dilatation of the main pancreatic duct, respectively. In both cases EUS-FNA was performed. Results: Smears showed medium-to-large, cohesive groups and complex papillary clusters set in a clean, mucoid background, composed of cuboidal or columnar epithelial cells with abundant clear or mucinous citoplasms. A honeycomb arrangement was occasionally seen. Although nuclei were predominantly medium-size and uniform, some groups showed some nuclear enlargement and pleomorphism with visible nucleoli. A diagnosis of \"mucinous neoplasm with papillary pattern\" was rendered in both cases, followed by partial pancreatectomy. The histologic examination was consistent with IPMN. Conclusion: The cytologic features of intraductal mucinous papillary neoplasms of the pancreas, evaluated by EUS-FNA, seems to be quite characteristic of these tumors and allow to suggest a correct preoperative diagnosis. Objective: The human IGH locus at chromosome 14q32 is frequently involved in different translocations of non Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), and the detection of any breakage involving the IGH locus should identify a B-cell NHL. The split signal IGH FISH-CISH DNA probe (IFCD) is a mixture of two fluorochrome-labeled DNAs that binds the telomeric and the centromeric segments, on the IGH breakpoint respectively. We tested the capability of the IFCD to detect IGH translocations and diagnose B-cell NHL on cytological samples. Method: Fifty cytological specimens from lymphoproliferative processes were tested using the IFCD and the results compared to light chain assessment by flow cytometry (FC), IGH status by PCR, and to clinical-histological data. Results: IFCD analysis detected 29 positive, 15 negative and 6 inadequate cases; there were 29 true positive (66 %), 9 true negative (20 %), 6 false negative (14 %) and 0 false positive cases (0 %). Comparing the sensitivity of the IFCD with FC and PCR, the highest sensitivity was obtained by FC followed by IFCD and PCR. Conclusion: The IFCD is effective in detecting any translocation involving the IGH locus; it can be employed on different samples from different B-cell NHL whereas it is not useful to classify the specific entities.

The most important step is a recognition and proper segmentation of the separate glands, even branched, atrophic or distorted. Method: New sequential algorithm has been proposed, based on mathematical morphology transformations, such as extended regional maxima, hit-or-miss, opening and closing operations. For lumen opened glands snake algorithm with closing has been applied to surrounding elements with sequential elimination of the closed contours under decreasing area criterion. Proposed method has been used to evaluate 47 cases of diversion colitis to compare specimens sampled from functional part of colon and defunctioned distal one. Results: The appropriate results were obtained for specimens with different section planes with efficiency 89 %. In comparison of the B to A was observed decreased participation of epithelium in the glands area measured in deep region (an average 57 % instead 68 %). In addition, the area of the gland was slightly reduced from 51 % to 46 % of the mucosa. Conclusion: The proposed method can be useful to automatic morphometry analysis of the gland shape in colon mucosa. The recognition of the opened glands improves previously designed algorithms. Objective: Quantitative analysis of the immunohistochemical histological samples plays an important role in the diagnosis and prognosis of many cancers. The commercial and non-commercial software's to computerized image analysis of microscopic images based in several approaches. Method: The advance segmentation scheme usually consists of preprocessing, nuclei extraction and classifier blocks. When the preprocessing step includes filtering and conversion to the most discriminative representation and the classifier can be realized by various tools, especially Support Vector Machine as a state-of-art, nuclei extraction is the most crucial part of any algorithms. We compare single thresholding methods such as Otsu, Kurita, minimum error, entropy thresholding, with the sequential thresholding approaches combined with area criteria, local threshold value or extended regional maxima. All of them are accompanied by watershed method and filtration. Results: For Ki-67 stained meningioma specimens in the fields of view without overlapping nuclei the most advance methods are adequate. When increasing the cell number, only sequential thresholding with area criteria and extended regional maxima give acceptable results. The mean relative error is 2.6 \u00b1 2.2 and 5.4 \u00b1 6.4 % respectively. Conclusion: The results confirm the efficiency of using sequential methods for segmentation of cell nuclei. For best results, use sequential thresholding with area criteria.",

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a coccygeal, well-demarcated, non-enhancing mass of 4\u00d75 cm in diameter. The mass did not have any connection with the spinal cord. It was completely excised and grossly the cut surface of the encapsulated mass was soft. Microscopically the tumor was comprimised of myxoid stroma with pseudopapillary structures around hyalinized vessels. The tumoral cells showed intracytoplasmic dot-like positivity with EMA. There were no mitosis, and the Ki67 labeling index was low. Conclusion: Extraspinal MPEs are rare and the most common location is sacrococygeal area. These masses are often preoperatively misdiagnosed as pilonidal sinus. Unlike the CNS MPEs, extraspinal MPEs have a potential to metastasize even if they do not show any anaplastic morphological feature. Long term follow-up is recommended as metastases can occur up to 20 years after initial presentation. Objective: Cerebellar liponeurocytoma (CL) is a rare neoplasm with neuronal, astrocytic and lipomatous differentiation arising in adults. The entity is considered as a grade II neoplasm in the last WHO classification of central nervous system tumours. We show two typical cases of this entity stressing the spectrum of histological changes and its differential diagnosis. Method: Patient 1 is a 72-year-old woman with a history of headaches and instability. CT scans and MRI showed a 5 cm in diameter relatively ill-defined, poorly enhanced, round tumour mass in the left hemisphere. Patient 2 is a 56-yearold woman with a history of headaches and instability. MRI showed a 6.5 cm in diameter well-defined triangular lesion in the right hemisphere. Results: Complete surgical resection was achieved in both cases. Both tumours showed highly cellular neoplasms composed by round to polygonal cells with scant cytoplasm and round nuclei with fine chromatin pattern. Mitoses were not seen. Well differentiated lipomatous cells grouped in irregular nests were intermingled with the predominant neuronal component. Conclusion: Cerebellar liponeurocytomas are located in the cerebellar hemispheres and pursue a non aggressive clinical course, with local recurrences detected mainly after incomplete resections. The typical adipous tissue is the result of a lipidization process and not a true metaplasia. Objective: Giant cell tumor of bone is an uncommon neoplasm that accounts for about 5 % of all bone tumors. It usually involves long bones and is very rarely encountered in the skull where it mostly involves the sphenoid and temporal bones. It is a benign neoplasm but can be locally aggressive. Method: We present a case of a 32 year old woman with history of multiple sclerosis whose routine CT scan revealed a mass with corrosive features and calcification situated at the petrous portion of her left temporal bone. A biopsy was sent to our laboratory. Results: Histopathologic examination revealed a neoplasm composed of sheets of oval mononuclear cells, with uniformly distributed nuclear chromatin, evenly intermixed with numerous giant cells that contain a variable number of nuclei with features similar to those of mononuclear cells. Cytoplasm of either cell type was eosinophilic and cell borders were indistinct. Mitoses were scarce and regular. Foamy histiocytes, hemosiderin and microscopic nodules of cartilage formation were also noted. Conclusion: Although giant cell tumor is a benign neoplasm its' localization in this case posses a threat that should be managed surgically and by adjuvant radiotherapy if complete excision is unobtainable.",

In this study, we have investigated the expression levels of leptin (Ob) and its receptor (Ob-R) in various types of pituitary adenomas and normal anterior pituitaries. Method: 50 pituitary adenoma cases between 2006 and 2011 were selected. Immunohistochemistry for leptin (Ob) was performed for each 10 cases of null cell, GH, ACTH, prolactin and FSH/LH secreting adenomas. Western blot was performed for leptin receptor (Ob-R) in 9 cases consisting of all five subtypes. Results: Immunohistochemical staining showed greater immunoreactivity for leptin in normal pituitaries compared to adenomas. Except for ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas, all other four subtypes showed widespread and intense staining for leptin (P<0.0001). Null and FSH/LH-secreting subtypes were mainly showed cytoplasmic and nuclear staining. Western blot analysis showed leptin receptor expression in all types of adenomas except null cell. Objective: Primary malignant brain tumors often present local invasive growth. The study aimed to estimate the expression of KAI1 protein, MMP-2, CD44v6 and their correlation in gliomas of different grade of malignancy. Method: Expression of MMP-2, CD44v6 and KAI1 was evaluated on 154 formalin fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks divided into: pilocytic astrocytoma (n=15), fibrillary astrocytoma (n=17), anaplastic astrocytomas (n= 27), anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (n=27), glioblastoma multiforme (n=54) and normal brain tissue (n=14) using immunohistrochemistry. Results: MMP-2 and CD44v6 was observed frequently in gliomas with high grade of malignancy. KAI1 immunoreactivity was mainly observed in specimens with low degree of malignancy. MMP-2 and CD44v6 expression was significantly increased when the degree of malignancy of the gliomas increased (p<0.05). Whilst KAI1 expression increased when the degree of gliomas malignancy decreased (p = 0.03). Positive correlations between MMP-2 and CD44v6 (p=0.01) and inverse between KAI1 and MMP-2 expression (p=0.02) were found in gliomas.",

Glioblastoma may manifest at any age but usually affects adults especially older than 50 years. In this case, we present a pediatric glioblastoma case because it has seen rarely under 20 years and it is so important owing to its prognosis. Method: An 11-year-old boy has had headache for 20 days. According to radiological imagings 23\u00d720 mm in diameter infiltrating mass has seen in temporal lobe contains 15\u00d7 7 mm in diameter cystic component and contrast enhancement was noted. Clinically grade 3 astrocytoma has thought primarily and he has been operated. Results: In microscopic examination nuclear atypia, mitotic activity and microvascular proliferation has seen without necrosis. Objective: Gliosarcomas are biphasic neoplasms composed of a glioblastoma admixed to a sarcomatous component with different lines of differentiation. Histogenesis of these tumors is still discussed. Our objective is to specify pathological characteristics of this neoplasm its related to or not to glioblastoma. Method: 3 cases of gliosarcomas diagnosed in our department of pathology. Clinical, radiological, therapeutic and follow-up data were reviewed. Histological features and immunohistochemical results were also established. Results: 3 female patients with a median age of 46 years (ranging 30-69 years). intracranial hyperpressure and paralysis are main symptoms. The brain imaging showed frontal, fronto-parietal and intra ventricular expansive process, respectively. Microscopically, a biphasic pattern, with anaplastic astrocytic cells alternated with malignant mesenchymal areas, demonstrating a fibrosarcoma pattern, in two cases and rhabdo\u00efd pattern in one case. Immunohistochemical stain confirmed the diagnosis of gliosarcoma in each case. Patients were treated by surgical excision; One patient was lost on follow-up. One patient died by postoperative complications. Conclusion: Clinical, radiological and follow-up features of gliosarcomas share great similarities with glioblastomas. Histopathological, histochemical and immunohistochemical studies are helpful in accurate diagnosis. Cytogenetic and molecular data support a monoclonal origin for these tumors. Objective: Case of biphasic synovial sarcoma of nerve in a 59 year-old female located between flexor muscles and radial diaphysis and adherent to median nerve and ulnar artery is presented. Method: Tissue was fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin and stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin. Periodic Acid-Schiff stain without diastase pre-digestion was obtained. Ventana antibodies were employed: TTF-1, ER, EMA, S100, CK 14, CK 7 and MNF 116. SS18-SSX fusion gene transcript was detected with conventional RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. Results: Macroscopically nodule had smooth circumscribed borders, grey-yellowish colour and measured 3,7\u00d73\u00d72,5 cm. Histologically it was delimited by a dense sclero-hyaline capsule and constituted of numerous glands lined by one layer of cuboidal-columnar cells showing eosinophilic cytoplasm and round to ovoid nuclei with a single small nucleolus. They contained dense eosinophilic strongly PAS and EMA positive material. Glands were immersed within tightly packed spindle cells. Mitoses were scanty. Necrosis was absent. EMA strongly stained most of the glandular as well as scanty spindle cell elements. Chromosomal reciprocal translocation t (X; 18) with positive signal for SS18-SSX1 transcript was seen. Conclusion: Synovial sarcoma of nerve is a rare condition that has to be distinguished from histologically similar lesions.",

Conclusion: Rabdoid phenotype represents an indicator of malignant transformation regardless of the tumor's histogenesis. Expression of Ki-67 antigen correlates with recurrence even in meningiomas with minimal atypical features, which should prompt closer surveillance after excision. Rabdoid meningiomas behave aggressively and have bad prognosis contrary to the classic meningioma. Prognosis is influenced by it's complete excision and the expansion within the intracranial cavity. It has to be distinguished from glioma, melanoma and metastatic carcinoma. The patient after 1 year is in generally good health, and is followed up by oncologists.",

There are two main forms called NF1 and NF2 which have different incidence, molecular characteristics, and clinical exhibitio. Both have higher risk for the development of certain rare malignant tumors that occur in the brain, nerves or spinal cord. Method: Here, we present a rare case in which multiple meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas diagnosed in the same operation. Results: A 23 year old woman presented with hearing loss clinically. She underwent surgical treatment for tumoral lesions in two different localization in the same session. One of them resected from pontoserebellar location was diagnosed as a schwannoma and the other one located on dura was diagnosed as a meningioma respectively. Conclusion: NF2 is far less common than NF1 and strict diagnostic criteria have been described each of them. Since difficulty to detect genetic abnormalities and no single criteria is pathognomonic, clinical characteristics much more valuable for differentiation. Knowledge of associated clinical features will help to correct diagnosis and to predict much more devastating clinical course for NF2.",

They are usually located in the supratentorial periventricular region. Because of some clinical and radiological findings CNS neurocytomas were confused with other intraventricular lesions. Method: A 37-year-old male was admitted with chronic headache with 6 months duration on July 21, 2011, when there were no neurological deficits or physical abnormalities. Computed tomographic (CT) scans showed 51\u00d740 mm a mixed density mass with amorphous calcification in the right lateral ventricle, which was irregularly enhanced by contrast medium. Light Microscopy showed sheets of monotonously neoplastic cells with uniform round-to-oval nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli. The cytoplasm was clear or eosinophilic with indistinct border. Capillary networks were well developed and divided the tumor cells into groups. No nuclear pleomorphism or mitosis was seen. We present a case of intraventricular neurocytomas confirmed by immunohistochemical studies. Conclusion: This rare tumor causing diagnostic confusion, discussed by the literature.",

Hemostatic agents are used to control intraoperative bleeding in many surgical subspecialties, including neurosurgery. There are occasional reports of granulomatous reaction to biomaterials. Method: We aimed to present a 35 year old female patient, who was operated because of the tumor at left frontoparietal region. Tumor was histopathologically reported as oligoastocytoma. However, no granulomatous inflammation was detected beside the tumor. After 6 months, patient was reoperated because of tumor recurrence, abscess and inflammatory necrotic tissue beside the tumor. Histopathologically, gemistocytic astrocytoma with granulomatous inflammation and abscess formation was reported. No micro-organism had grown in any kind of cultures. At our neurosurgery department surgicel is used after craniotomy as hemostatic agent. It's raw material is cellulose and absorbed in about 3 months. Results: In the literature, germinoma accompanied by granulomatous inflammation have been reported. However, astrocytic tumors don't express such an association. The patient doesn't use any drugs forming granuloma reported in the literature. Conclusion: We encountered that Surgicel causing granulomatous inflammation in very few cases in the literature. The findings might be secondary to surgicel that used in the first operation. Objective: Astrocytic tumors show various molecular and genetic alterations in its development and progression. Glioblastoma multiforme (GM) develops as either de novo or by progression from diffuse astrocytomas (DA) or anaplastic astrocytomas (AA) by genetic alterations. Method: Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite instability (MSI) was investigated in 40 cases of astrocytic tumors (DAs [n=12], AAs [n=15] and GMs [n=13]) with 14 microsatellite markers and 5 microsatellite markers harboring p53 and PTEN, respectively. The patients' age ranged from 27 to 77 years (mean, 50 years). Results: LOH was statistically significant in AAs and GMs, compared to that of DAs (p=0.023). LOH for 17p13 and LOH-H group for 10q23 were statistically significant in AAs and GMs (p=0.045 and p=0.001). MSI rate in DAs, AAs and GMs was detected in 16.7 %, 13.3 %, 23.1 %, but it showed no significant correlation with prognosis factors. MSI and MSI-H rates were correlated with younger (\u300850 years) group (p= 0.040, p=0.011, respectively). Conclusion: Alterations on PTEN and p53 may contribute to the development and progression of astrocytic tumors. Especially, LOH-H for 10q23 and 17p13 is considered as clinical application of discriminating the AAs and GMs from DAs. MSI might be involved in the tumorigenesis of relatively young patients. Objective: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) III or Dejerine-Sottas syndrome is a severe hereditary demyelinating motor and sensory neuropathy presenting in infancy or early childhood with delayed motor milestone and extremely slow nerve conduction velocities. Method: Among 530 unrelated Korean CMT patients, mutational screen for well known CMT genes reveals three patients with PMP22 de novo mutation showing DSS. The histopathological findings of distal sural nerves are analyzed in all patients twice; Cases 1 and 2 with 10 years interval and Case 3 with 17 years. Results: On semi-thin transverse sections, all the remaining axons (thinly myelinated or demyelinated) are surrounded by classic or basal lamina onion bulbs (OBs). The first biopsy of Case 1 (2 years-old) shows OBs (4,452/mm2), which consists of 2,295 (51.55 %) MFs with OBs and 2,157 (48.45 %) demyelinated axons with OBs. The second biopsy shows OBs (2,275/mm2), consisting of 425 (18.68 %) MFs with OBs, 489 (21.49 %) demyelinated axons with OBs, and 957 (42.07 %) OBs with no discernible axons. Cases 2 and 3 show similar histopathologic findings with main differences in numbers of OBs. Conclusion: Although the differences noted in two biopsies are probably due to age of the patients, correlations with clinical symptoms will be helpul for management of the patients. Objective: Two mutations of the seipin gene (N88S and S90L) have been reported and known to cause neurodegenerative disorders. We performed whole exome sequencing in two Charcot-Marie-Tooth families and identified three patients with two causative heterozygous mutations (N88S and S90W) and S90W is a novel mutation. Method: The histopathological findings of distal sural nerves are analyzed in two patients (Cases 1 and 2) with S90W novel mutation (FC305) and a patient (Case 3) with N88S mutation (FC51). Results: Transverse semi-thin sections reveal increased numbers of myelinated fibers (MFs) (11,898/mm2; 11,429/ mm2; 9,430/mm2) with increased small MFs forming regenerative axon clusters and loss of large MFs. Histogram shows unimodal distribution pattern. Cases 1 and 2 show the similar ranges and average of diameter of MFs (1.461 3.24 \u03bcm, 5.13 \u03bcm). Case 3 shows more numbers of small MFs (0.82~10.50 \u03bcm, 3.73 \u03bcm). Ultra-structural examination reveals MFs with myelin abnormalities, pseudo-onion bulb formation including single axon or axon clusters, and thick MFs. Conclusion: The findings are consistent with axonal neuropathy with features of demyelination. Additional cases will be necessary to know the significance of differences between these cases.",

CD151 overexpression was closely associated with MGMT methylation (P= 0.014), and it was a prognostic factor for predicting worse overall survival (OS; P=0.002) and progressionfree survival (PFS; P=0.043). Combination of CD151 overexpression and MGMT methylation better stratified the patients' OS (P=0.001) and PFS (P=0.009). In multivariate analysis, CD151 overexpression was an independent prognostic factor for predicting OS over MGMT methylation (P=0.012). Conclusion: CD151 seems to have a critical role for high grade progression in astroglial tumors. CD151 is a good tissue marker for predicting worse prognosis in glioblastomas.

The work aim was to use 5-methyl pyrrolidinone chitosan (MPC) as a platform for the delivery of NT. Method: Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg streptozotocin. Mice were anesthetized and two 6 mm excision wounds were created dorsally. MPC alone, NT alone, MPC loaded with NT or PBS were placed daily on wounds.

Method: A 65-year-old male patient who had operated for multinodular goiter 8 years ago presented with neck swelling on the right side. Residual thyroid tissue was detected and the lesion was removed surgically in combination with a right neck dissection. Histopathologic examination was consistent with PTC and metastatic lymph nodes. The patient received radioactive iodine therapy. Afterwards, the patient presented with a right axillary mass 14 years after the first operation and underwent surgical excision. Results: Histopathologic examination showed PTC with anaplastic transformation.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a malignant tumor often with therapy resistant distant metastases. Patients with sporadic form have metastases at the time of diagnosis, mostly in bones, lungs and liver. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of yCD/5FC in MTC treatment using xenotransplants derived from model TT cell line in nude mice. Method: Tumors were immunohistochemically stained with polyclonal antibody anti-EGFP (enhanced green fluorescence protein) and monoclonal antibodies anti-PCNA and anti-Ki67. Positivity was semiquantitatively evaluated. Results: Diffuse positivity for PCNA was seen in untreated and treated tumors, respectively. Positivity for Ki-67 was diffuse in untreated and only sporadic in treated tumors. Conclusion: Diffuse PCNA positivity in treated tumors suggests that the tumor cells stopped in S phase. Scattered positivity of Ki-67 after treatment document suppressed proliferation mediated by yCD/5FC gene therapy, which implies therapeutic application in patients with metastatic MTC.

Objective: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment aims to control metabolic effects, preserve pancreatic function and reduce complications, such as nephropathy. This study intends to evaluate the effects of sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitor, in pancreatic and renal lesions in Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF (fa/fa)) rats, an animal model of T2DM. Method: Male obese diabetic ZDF (fa/fa) rats, 20-weeksold, were treated with vehicle or sitagliptin (10 mg/kgBW/ day) for 6 weeks, and compared with lean control ZDF rats (n=8 each). Biochemical parameters as well as pancreatic and renal lipid peroxidation and histopathology profile were assessed. Specimens we stained with haematoxylin-eosin and periodic acid of Schiff, and examined by light microscopy. Lesions were evaluated by a semiquantitative rating. Endocrine/exocrine pancreas and renal glomerular, tubulointerstitial and vascular lesions were assessed and scored (0 3/0-2). Results are mean \u00b1 SEM; ANOVA and Duncan's post-hoc analysis (P\u22640.05 was considered as significant). Results: Sitagliptin improved metabolic parameters, reduced lipid peroxidation (p<0.001) in both organs and significantly prevented major diabetic pancreatic and renal lesions in obese diabetic ZDF rats. Conclusion: Sitagliptin seems to comply with the three main objectives of T2DM therapeutic management. Underlying molecular mechanisms deserve further elucidation, but could be related with metabolic improvement and reduction of oxidative stress. Objective: Thyroid tumors of uncertain malignant potential (TT-UMP) include follicular and well-differentiated tumors of UMP (FT-UMP/WDT-UMP), as it refers to the presence of questionable capsular/vascular invasion or incompletely developed papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC)-type nuclear changes.

It is usually presented as biliary obstruction. Most cases are misdiagnosed as adenoma or carcinoma by preoperative endoscopic or radiologic. Therefore, it is frequently treated with extensive surgery. Method: We report a case of a 28 year-old man with an adenomyoma located in the ampulla of vater diagnosed by endoscopic piecemeal resection. Results: On histologic examination, the lesion consisted of hyperplastic glandular lobules, mainly located in the muscle layers of the vaterian system. The lobular formations consist of small glands surrounded by myofifroblastic, fibroblastic proliferation, sparse capillaries and inflammatory cells. IHC: Ki67: rare cells with a positive nuclear staining were presenting in the epithelial and mesenchymal components AML: The myofibroblastic of most spindle cells was confirmed by a strong cytoplasmic expression. Conclusion: Real incidence of adenomyoma of the vaterian system is difficult to appreciate as different names (adenomyoma, adenomyomatosis, myoepithelial hamartome) are used to designate the same histological lesion. Adenomyoma was diagnosed only in adult patients -mean age: 63 y). The histogenesis is still a subject of controversy.

Moreover, intestinal type gastric cancer shares many phenotypic and molecular genetic changes with colorectal cancer. In particular a progression from chronic gastritis to intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and finally malignant transformation is probably the sequence of gastric carcinogenesis. Somatic mutation of K-ras gene is common in colorectal cancer, being found in more than one-third of cases, but it seems to have, mostly in intestinal-type gastric cancer, a low incidence (7-20 %). The purpose of this study is to assess HER2 gene amplification and K-ras mutational status in a series of intestinal-type gastric carcinoma patients. Method: Twenty paraffin embedded gastric cancer specimens were tested for HER2 amplification by chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) and K-ras mutational status (codon 12 e 13) by PCR-RFLP.",

Objective: In Helicobacter pylori gastritis, constant antigenic stimulation triggers a sustained B-cell proliferation. Errors made during this continuous DNA replication are corrected by the DNA mismatch repair mechanism. Failure of this mechanism has been described in HNPCC and results in a replication error phenotype. Inherent to their instability during replication, microsatellites are the best markers of this replication error phenotype. We aimed to evaluate the role of defects in the DNA mismatch repair mechanism and microsatellite instability (MSI) in gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Method: We examined 10 microsatellite loci (BAT25, BAT26, D5S346, D17S250, D2S123, TGFB, BAT40, D18S58, D17S787 and D18S69) for instability in 28 patients with MALT lymphomas. In addition, these tumors were also immunostained for MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6, as well as screened for the presence of t(11;198)(q21;q21) by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: We found MSI in 5/28 (18 %) lymphomas, with one tumor displaying high levels of instability. MSI occurred in both t(11;18)(q21;q21)-positive and -negative tumors. Conclusion: Our data suggest that a MMR-defect may be involved in the development of gastric MALT lymphomas, and mutations in the MSH6 MMR gene or hypermethylation of the MSH6 promoter might be associated with MSIdriven gastric lymphomas.",

Method: A standard immunohistochemical method and a semi-quantitative evaluation for the detection of RPA1 Labeling Index (LI) were applied. Results: Nuclear RPA1 immunoreactivity was seen in all carcinomas with a mean value of 26.5 %. Statistical significant correlations emerged between: 1. RPA1 LI and low Tcategory (p=0.009) 2. RPA1 LI and absence of lymph node metastasis (p=0,014). RPA1 LI was higher in cases without lymphovascular invasion; however this association did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: The widespread expression of RPA1 in gastric carcinomas suggests that this protein is implicated in gastric cancer growth.

Histological examination of the protruding lesion revealed some misplaced cystic glands were entrapped in dense disorganized bundles of smooth muscle of muscularis mucosa surrounded by a rim of lamina propria. These findings were consistent with gastritis cystic polyposa. Objective: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a known risk factor for the development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix, the oropharynx and the anogenital region. The aim of our investigation was to assess the prevalence of HPV DNA in patients with esophagus cancer in the Western population. Method: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks from 37 consecutive patients who underwent esophageal endoscopic mucosal resection or esophagectomy for SCC were tested for the presence of HPV DNA by polymerase chain reaction using consensus primers GP5+/GP6+. Viral genotyping was determined by type-specific primers.",

The non-high-risk HPVs were detected in patients with previously treated SCC of the mouth (n=1) and the oropharynx (n=1). Patients with high-risk HPVpositive tumors had no history of oropharyngeal cancer. Conclusion: Our study revealed the presence of oncogenic HPV genotypes in a subset of esophageal cancer. The low rates of viral infection detected suggest that HPV unlikely represents a significant etiologic factor in esophageal carcinogenesis. Further studies are needed to confirm these data in larger populations. Objective: Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the world. Amplification of HER-2/neu oncogene has become an important biomarker for identifying patients who will respond to HER-2 targeting therapy. The rate of HER2 positivity in gastric cancer is variable, ranging from 6 % to 35 %. Objective: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are primary mesenchymal tumors that arise in the GI tract. Only 3-5 % of GISTs occur in the duodenum. Here, we report a rare case of duodenal GIST with extramural growth that mimicked a pancreatic tumor. Method: A 57 years old male patient was admitted to our hospital for duodenal ulcer and gastrointestinal bleeding which was diagnosed in an another clinic by endoscopy.",

Immunohistochemistry revealed that the cells are strongly positive with CD117, with focal expression of CD34 and SMA. Conclusion: GISTs are low-grade malignant mesenchymal tumors of the GI tract and are believed to originate from the neoplastic transformation of the Cajal cells, which are located between the longitudinal and circular layers of the muscularis propria. They most frequently arise from the second part of the duodenum where they push or infiltrate into the pancreas. In our case report, the patient's tumor exhibited extramural growth and mimicked a pancreatic tumor. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is relatively a rare subgroup of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We have experienced an uncommon case of MCL. A 65-year-old man was admitted to emergency service for upper gastrointestinal bleeding as melena. Gastric corpus wall thickness found increased and splenomegaly determined at whole abdominal ultrasonography. Endoscopic examination revealed subsequently, 1 cm diameter polypoid lesion at corpus anterior wall and 2 cm dimensioned elevated and vascularised lesion at corpus posterior wall. Endoscopic biopsy had reported as active gastritis and mucosal reactive hyperplastic changes with ulcerative background. After than total gastrectomy and splenectomy specimens examined diffuse infiltration of monotonous medium-sized, atypical lymphoid cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. These cells were positive for CD20, CD5, CD43, bcl-2 and CD79a, but negative for CD10, CD23 and bcl-6. Atypical lymphoid cells were present even in splenic hilus and lesser curvature lymph nodes. We reported this case as Primary Gastric Mantle Cell Lyphoma according to morphologic and immunohistochemical staining features. We report a 74-year-old man who had been searched for bicytopenia (anemia and thrombocytopenia). Bone marrow examination revealed extensive bone marrow metastasis of signet ring cell carcinoma. PAS, d-PAS and mucin histochemical markers performed to bone marrow sample which were all positive. Immunohistochemical markers were positive with MUC-1, MUC-5 AC, MUC-2 (focal staining), CK7, CK20, EMA, CEA and negative with vimentin, CD10, chromogranin. According to morphologic and immunohistochemical results we thought primarily gastrointestinal system malignancy, particularly stomach carcinoma. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed subsequently, hemorrhagic ulcerative lesion had seen and taken biopsies. Endoscopic biopsy results showed metastatic signet ring cells origin from stomach. We report this case because bone marrow metastasis can be found commonly in some malignant tumors but diagnosing a nonhematologic malignancy from bone marrow is an unusual event. ",

Method: We describe a case of a 37-year-old man who initially presented with discomfort in the left testis and underwent resection of a hydrocele in the left testis. A hydrocelectomy was performed, during which a pedunculated mass, 2,5 cm in greatest dimension, was found attached to the testis. Results: Microscopically, the mass was composed of multiple branching papillary structures with fibrovascular cores covered by a single layer of low cuboidal to cuboidal cells with predominantly bland nuclear and cytologic features and rare microscopical necrosis. Immunohistochemical staining for calretinin and cytokeratines 5/6 was positive and proliferative marker Ki67 was <2 %. Accordingly the diagnosis of a well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma was made. The patient has not received additional therapy and is disease free 15 months after diagnosis. Conclusion: In conclusion, we report a rare case of a welldifferentiated papillary mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis of the testis. The combination of benign and semimalignant characteristics can make the diagnosis of such a lesion problematic and pathologic distinction from malignant mesothelioma is crucial, although it may be difficult because of the variability of associated histologic features. Objective: Lipoma of the bone is a rare benign adipocytic tumor that arises intraosseous and rarely on the cortex or on the surface of the bone (parosteal lipoma). Parosteal lipoma affects the long bones diaphysis of adults over 40 years old. Method: We present the case of a 23 years old female with clinical diagnosis of femoral exostosis. Conventional radiographs shows the presence of a 5 cm length area of lucency on the femoral metaphyseal surface with a periostal reaction at the base of the lesion. Results: Gross examination reveals a 5 cm osseous tumor, whitish on the surface and yellow on the section. On microscopic examination there are mature adipocytes with small foci of bone scattered throughout the adipocytes and hyaline cartilage at the perifery of the lesion. The gross and microscopic examinations correlated with conventional radiographs led us to diagnosis of parosteal lipoma.",

Radiographs showed expansile lytic lesions in metadiaphyseal region, sometimes with aggressive appearance. Histologically, ABC showed a mixture of blood-filled spaces with connective tissue septae containing osteoclast giant cells and foci of osteoid. Scattered areas of so called \"blue bone\" were present in 5 cases (50 %). There were two solid variants. Five patients underwent resection and 5 curettage, three of which relapsed (30 %). Conclusion: ABC should be considered in the radiologic differential diagnosis of hands and feet tumours because these lesions can even mimic malignancies. Although clinicopathologically some authors consider GCRG is related to the ABC solid variant, we believe they are different entities.",

Imunohistochemical stains were performed in order to make a differential diagnosis: the tumor cells were positive for CD38 and CD138 and they expressed cytoplasmic immunoglobulin with kappa light chain restriction. Most of the tumor cells were also CD56 and EMA positive. Conclusion: Even though extramedullary plasmacytoma of the sinonasal tract is rare, it should be included in the differential diagnosis.

The patient underwent parotidectomy and histopathological examination showed thymic carcinoma with areas of thymoma. Method: Histopathological examination was done according to conventional protocols. Immunohistochemical stainings were performed using LSAB methods. PanCK, CD3, CD20, CK5/6, CK7, Vimentin, Ki-67, CD5, Bcl-2, CD1a, S100, SMA, TdT antibodies were used. Results: Histopathologically, a well circumscribed, nodular, hybride neoplasm finely seperated from parotid gland had two components, uniform spindle cells in basaloid form lobulated by fibrous septae and large epitheloid cells with vesicular nuclei and meganucleoli, suggesting thymoma and thymic carcinoma, respectively. Prominent lymphocytic reaction with germinal centers, high mitotic activity, small necrotic foci and microabcesses were also seen. Immunohistochemisty revealed PanCK, vimentin, CD5 and CD1a positivity. The diagnosis of \"lymphoepithelioma-like\" thymic carcinoma was made. Conclusion: Thymic carcinoma is a rare tumor most commonly located in the anterior mediastinum. Thymic carcinoma which originates from ectopic rests of thymic tissue caused by defective migration of the embryonic thymus, is extremely rare. In the presented case a thymic carcinoma was found in parotid gland which is an unusual site. Objective: Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that several malignant tumors express an alternatively spliced variant of the receptor of growth hormone -releasing hormone (SV1), which operates by a ligand-dependent and independent manner.

A surprising finding of our study was the high positivity for SV1 exhibited by the Warthin tumors that implies biological similarities between these histopathological entities of the salivary glands. These results imply that the use of antagonistic analogs of GHRH merit further investigation. Objective: Sialadenoma papilliferum (SP) is a rare, benign neoplasm of salivary gland origin which manifests as an exophytic papillary excrescence of the mucosa. Indeed, SP is both an exophytic proliferation of papillary stratified squamous epithelium above the mucosal surface and an endophytic salivary ductal proliferation beneath the mucosa. It arises predominantly in minor salivary glands and usually affects patients in the age range of 32-87 years, with reports in young patients being exceedingly rare.

This type of treatment, which often replaces traditional surgical procedures provides satisfactory cosmetic results. It is known, however, that there is a risk of undesired effects at the site of injection of the product or even at a distance. Literature reports numerous cases of orofacial injuries caused by dermal fillers. The aim of this study is to evaluate two of the most widely used facial dermal fillers for aesthetic purposes in an effort to identify adverse reactions they may produce. Method: Two of the most commonly used materials for aesthetic purposes by dermatologists and plastic surgeons, polymethylmetacrylate and hialuronic Acid were injected in rat tongues: 10 % polymethylmethacrylate (n = 16) and 20 mg/mL hyaluronic acid (n =18), compared to an inert solution for control (n=16). After 7, 60 and 90 days, local clinical and histological alterations were analyzed. Results: The following factors were verified: intensity of the inflammatory response (H&E), amount of newly formed blood vessels (IHC) and macrophages and collagen fibers density (picrosirius). Results showed that both filling materials triggered local inflammatory response to a greater or lesser degree.

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of CD1a, CD4, CD8, CD20, caspase-3, tryptase and basement membrane thickness in oral lesions of lichen planus (LP) and lupus erythematosus (LE). Method: Oral lesions of LP (n=21) and LE (n=23) were biopsied. After confirmation of diagnosis, the specimens were submitted to PAS and immunohistochemistry. Results: CD1a expression was significantly greater in epithelium and connective tissue in LP. Epithelial CD4 and CD20 did not differ between the diseases, but were greater in connective tissue in LP. CD8 expression was greater in both epithelium and connective tissue in LP. Caspase-3 did not differ between the groups, whereas tryptase was greater in LE epithelium. Basement membrane thickness did not differ between LP and LE. Conclusion: CD1a, CD4, CD8, CD20, caspase-3 and tryptase expression and the basement membrane thickness are not definitive criteria for differential diagnosis of oral lichen planus and lupus erythematosus.

Results: Histopathological examination showed a mixture of ducts, nests and cords of cells often embedded in a desmoplastic stroma with comedonecrosis of some ductal structures. The tumor cells were polygonal with vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli and eosinophilic, oncocytic cytoplasm. The tumor margins were lobulated and irregular with perineural invasion. Mucin stains were negative. We noted high proliferative index and cerbB2 overexpression. The tumor was classified as a salivary duct carcinoma, oncocytic variant of parotid gland.

This should be highly pondered when an oral cancer patient is treated with LLLT due to oral mucositis, for example. Method: Two tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (SCC9 and SCC25) were utilized to find the effect of low-level laser irradiation on the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Laser irradiation (660 and 780 nm) consisted on 40 mW of power and energy densities of 2, 3 and 6 J/cm2.

Mutation testing techniques have therefore become an urgent concern. Several methods for KRAS mutation detection have been described in the literature. Most of these are laboratory developed tests and only a few commercial assays are currently available. Method: We studied the performance characteristics of a KRAS mutation detection assay on the ABI-3130XL genetic analyzer using a new commercial mutation detection kit. Samples were analyzed in parallel by different reference laboratories using alternative methodologies. Various sample types were used including formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, fine-needle aspirates, and cyst fluid specimens.",

Objective: MicroRNAs (miRs) are small RNAs that modulate protein expression via post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA. They are related to malignancy in several tumors. Deregulation of miRs expression has been described in high grade astrocytomas of adult patients, however there is scarce information in pediatric patients. In this work we quantified the expression profiles of miRs in pediatrics astrocytomas. Method: Total RNA was extracted from 59 astrocytomas and 8 normal brain (NB) tissues, formalin fixed paraffin embedded. The expression levels of miR-124, miR-128-1 and miR-221 were quantified by using miRNA-specific TaqMan miRNA assays.",

Interestingly, membrane-bound beta-catenin expression was not affected, but released to cytosol in S3KO cells. S3-KO cells showed almost normal proliferation but did not form cell cluster due to lack of E-cadherin. Electron-micrograph confirmed lack of intercellular adhesion structures (desmosome) in S3KO cells. Also in L-S3KO mice, hepatocytes lack desmosome structure and cell adhesion. Objective: ALK positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is characterized by anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) expression, most commonly associated with the t (2;5)(p23;q35), fusing the ALK and nucleophosmin (NPM) genes. However, in a significant proportion of cases the ALK gene has a number of other than NPM translocation partners. The aim of the study was to detect the NPM/ ALK fusion gene and the other possible fusion genes. Method: NPM/ALK was detected by RT-PCR, NPM/ ALK negative lymphomas were analyzed by ALK specific Rapid Amplification of 5\u00b4cDNA Ends (5\u00b4RACE). We prepared Q-RT-PCR assay for quantification of 3\u00c1 LK mRNA. Molecular findings were correlated with I-FISH. Results: We analysed 42 ALK positive ALCL. Chromosomal breakpoints affecting the ALK locus were detected by I-FISH in all patients. The NPM/ALK was detected in 32/42 patients. 5\u00b4RACE identified ATIC/ALK in 3, CLTC/ALK in 2 patients. Other fusion genes (TPM4/ALK, TPM3/ALK, ALO17/ALK) were found in one patient. In all specimens, overexpression of 3\u00b4ALK mRNA suitable for the minimal residual disease (MRD) detection was found. Objective: A 17 year-old girl, presented with an osteolytic epiphyseal lesion of the distal ulna. Based on histopathological examinations, the lesion was classified as giant cell tumor of bone (GCT). Four years later, the girl developed a second lesion at the same site. The histopathological examination revealed aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) with solid spindle celled and giant celled areas which raised a question of a recurrent GCT or a primary ABC. The aim of this study was to analyze the clonality of these two processes. Determination of maternal and paternal X chromosome activation status is useful in the diagnostic analysis of nonrandom X inactivation patterns. Method: The human androgen receptor (HUMARA) gene polymorphism assay was used to identify the clonality of these two processes. Results: The patient was identified as heterozygous for the HUMARA allele. The GCT and ABC samples exhibited a monoclonal pattern, but one of them was with maternal and the other with paternal X chromosome origin. Conclusion: The findings of this case report demonstrate the clonal behavior of both lesions with different clonal patterns. The above investigation proved to be helpful in distinguishing between recurrent GCT and de novo ABC in the field of previous surgical intervention. . In all specimens gen Her2/neu was quantifed agains reference gen by qRT-PCR method (LyghtCycler\u00ae 480 II, Roche). Results: The results of cytogenetic analysis have been showed in 40 % that didn\u00b4t corespond with the results of qRT-PCR quantification. On the contrary the results of IHC was correlated with the results of qRT-PCR in 100 %. Methods SISH vs FISH has in 25 % different of results. In regard to the quality of ISH signals the SISH is more preferable for determination Her2/neu. Conclusion: A pilot study conducted on a group of 20 patients showed that among the methods used in the process of determining HER2/neu amplification are significant differences, even in evaluation and interpretation of test results.

He is found to be overexpressed in some lung cancer histological subtypes. MEN1 is a tumor suppressor gene, with a role in cellular growth and differentiation, DNA reparation, and apoptosis. Method: Surgically resected specimen from 99 patients (men n=66; women n=33, age 57\u00b111) with lung cancer were studied: carcinoid tumors (CT)-23, small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC)-13, large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNEC)-6, adenocarcinomas (AC)-29, and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC)-28. The histological subtype, pTNM stage, and gene expression of MEN1 and EGFR in tumor and normal lung tissue were evaluated. Results: Overexpression of EGFR was observed in 34 %(SCC-61 %, AC-31 %, SCLC-23 %, LCNEC-17 %, CT-13 %). Decreased expression was observed in 22 %(LCNEC-66 %, SCLC-54 %, CT-22 %, AC-14 %, SCC-7 %) (p<0.001). Overexpresssion of MEN1 was observed in 57 % of all tumors (SCLC-69 %, CT-65 %, SCC-57 %, LCNEC-50 %, AC-48 %) (p>0.05). Significant correlation between overexpression of MEN1 and early stage SCC was observed (p=0.03). Conclusion: EGFR is a target for therapy with monoclonal antibodies, so the tumors that overexpress EGFR can be considered for treatment with these drugs. MEN1 can eventually be a marker for good prognosis and a potential target for therapy. Objective: Homeobox genes encode transcription factors controlling cellular proliferation and differentiation. Altered expression of PROX1 homeobox gene is related to many cancers, including breast, esophagus, lymphatic and oral. Method: After overexpression of PROX1 gene in SCC9 cell line, total RNA was extracted from three overexpressing-PROX1 clones (OC) and one control-transfection cell clone (CC). Microarray analyses were performed using the Whole Human Genome 44 K according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genes with a fold change of greater or lower than 2.0 in OC versus CC, were considered as increased or decreased, respectivelly. Gene Ontology (GO) was used to assign biological process related to significantly differentially expressed genes. Results: Down-regulated genes MMP2, TIMP3 and NOTCH1 were further validated by qRT-PCR. Comparative gene analysis of OC and CC revealed 925 up-regulated and 789 down-regulates genes. Pathways induced upon PROX1 overexpression in GO terms included vascular development control, cellular adhesion, regulation of proliferation, among others. MMP2, TIMP3 and NOTCH1 expression by qRT-PCR showed reduced expression leves in OC. These genes are commonly overexpressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma and have been related with metastatic tumors and worse prognosis. Objective: Barrett\u00b4s Esophagus is the unique known precursor for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), in a gradual progression to dysplasia. Our objective is to determine the correlation between the hypermethylation in CpG islands of the promoter region of p16 tumoral suppressor gen in epithelial DNA and the histopathological pattern, as possible biomarker for risk of progression. Method: 1. A study was performed about the evolution of precursor lesions, in a group of 55 patients diagnosed following the Vienna classification. 2. p16 hypermethylation is analyzed in paraffin embedding samples, through laser microdissection, DNA extraction, PCR amplification, pyrosequencing and quantification. Results: 1.14 of 20 cases with 2 to 5 biopsies remained as ND, ID or LGD, and 6 cases progressed to HGD and/or EAC. 2.

Objective: In High Risk HPVs the expression of oncoprotein E6 is responsible for the degradation of p53, while E7 inactivates pRb and causes the progression to S phase of cell cycle, both sustaining the conversion to and the maintenance of malignancy. The aim of this study is to compare the performance in the detection of the E6 and E7 mRNA expression of HR-HPV using the NucliSENS Easy q test (bioMerieux) or HPV OncoTect (IncellDx) a test based on Flow cytometry-FISH method. Method: We enrolled 50 patients positive for HR-HPV DNA and/or pap smears. All subjects underwent a colposcopy histological evaluation and were tested both for the NucliSENS Easy q test and HPV OncoTect. Results: 31 out of 50 subjects resulted positive for RNA expression. The patients were divided into two cohorts based on the histological diagnosis: low grade lesions (CIN1) and high grade lesion (CIN2+). Patients with CIN1 were 26 with NucliSENS Easy q test and 13 with HPV Onco Tect, those with CIN2+ were 5 with either tests. Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest that HPV OncoTect have a better specificity than NucliSENS Easy q test, while more samples need to assess the difference in sensitivity.",

The function of the Fallopian tubes appears to involve orchestrated spatiotemporal alterations in transcriptome profiles, the regulation of tubal gene expression and function by miRNAs may thus be of primary importance in tubal ectopic pregnancy. Method: Both implantation sites and non-implantation sites of Fallopian tubes from women with EP and decidual biopsies from women undergoing therapeutic surgical termination of pregnancy were collected and analyzed by miRNA array. The unique miRNA profiling results were validated by TaqMan qRT-PCR, and bioinformatics' analysis was employed to further predict the miRNA targets. Results: A total of 47 miRNAs were differentially expressed in implantation sites compared with those in non-implantation sites of Fallopian tubes after comparison of decidual miRNAs, among which 19 were up-regulated while 28 are down-regulated. The miR-424 was significantly increased, whereas let-7i, miR-149, and miR-182 were significantly decreased. Differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted to be related with several signaling pathways in normal intrauterine implantation. Conclusion: Our findings establish an miRNA signature associated with tubal implantation and provide the experimental basis for further understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of initiation and development of tubal EP in humans. Lung is an organ that can sense any perturbation of the air, due to its constant interaction (long live) of the air.

The cases were chosen from archive of autopsies from 1970 to 1979, with different diagnosis, and were matched in sex and age with a same number of cases chosen from 2000 to 2009. The expression was studied by RT-PCR from lung tissue embedded in paraffin, 20 samples of each decade. Results: The expression levels of Hsp90 were normalized to \u03b2-actine. We found expression in six cases of 2000-2009: five for Hsp90AA1-2, and 1 for Hsp90AB1, one case expressed both. Their matched cases in 1970-1979 never expressed any isoform. The cause of dead in all cases doesn't fit with any pattern. Conclusion: With these results we propose than the lung could be a sensor of global warming, and the expression of these genes could be molecular markers of this climatic change.",

Pov\u00fd\u0161il, L. Petru\u017eelka * General University Hospital, Institute of Pathology, Prague, Czech Republic Objective: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is used in the treatment of breast carcinoma because it substantially reduces the size of the primary tumor and lymph node metastases. This present study is aimed at the investigation of biomarkers that can predict a pathologic response to the therapy. Method: The transcriptional profile of 84 key apoptosis genes was evaluated in both pre-therapeutically obtained tumor tissue by core needle biopsy and in specimens removed by final surgery, using a pathway-specific Real-Time PCR assay. Results: On the basis of a hierarchical cluster analysis of 13 significantly changed genes, we divided patients into good and bad prognosis groups, which correlate well with progression-free survival. In the good prognosis group, we found a statistically significant downregulation of the expression of MCL1 and IGF1R genes after neoadjuvant treatment. We also found a statistically significant overexpression of BCL2L10, BCL2AF1, CASP8, CASP10, CASP14, CIDEB, FADD, HRK, TNFRSF25, TNFSF8 and CD70 genes. In contrast, we found upregulation of IGF1R after the treatment in the group with poor prognosis. Conclusion: As we have shown, gene expression profiling after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a valuable research tool for investigating molecular markers, which may better reflect tumor biology and treatment response than standard prognostic and predictive factors. Objective: Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) is one of the most serious cancers. Identification of genetic changes (mutations, amplifications or rearrangements) within EGFR, KRAS and ALK oncogenes, associated with NSCLC, allows choosing the patients, benefit from biological therapy with tyrosin kinase inhibitors. Method: DNA is isolated from formalin fixed paraffin embedded specimens or cytology specimens. Mutation detection is performed by real-time PCR, fragment analysis, primerextension analysis and mutant-enriched PCR. Wt-EGFR patients (e.g. with no mutation detected) are tested for ALK gene rearrangement and EGFR gene polysomy or amplification using the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method. Results: Since 10/2010 till 2/2012, 238 DNA samples were analyzed. Out of these, 17 patients (7,14 %) were found to be positive for activating mutations within EGFR gene. Since 07/2011 till 2/2012, 80 patients were analyzed for ALK gene rearrangement, EGFR gene polysomy or amplification. ALK gene rearrangement has been proven in 5 (6,25 %) cases, ALK gene amplification in 2 (2,5 %) cases and EGFR gene polysomy or amplification in 35 (43,75 %) cases. Conclusion: Determination of genetics changes in tumor can provide powerful tool for setting up strategy and therapeutic protocols in NSCLC patients. Objective: A 61 year old gentleman, ex-smoker with a history of asbestos exposure presented to the emergency department with a 1 day attack of severe abdominal pain and bilious vomiting. History of abdominal pain, lethargy, and weight loss over the last 12 months and 4 years of recurrent pleural effusion. Pleural aspirates and a videoassisted thoracic biopsy were negative. Method: X-ray confirmed small bowel obstruction and an emergency laparotomy performed. The terminal ileum was intussuscepted into the caecum causing proximal obstruction. A right hemi-colectomy was performed. Results: On gross examination there was intussusception of the terminal ileum secondary to a polypoid mass at the ileo-caecal valve. Histology showed an oncocytic tumour with neuroendocrine features arising from the serosa of the small bowel. The tumour cells were positive for CK7, calretinin, and vimentin but negative for CK20, chromograninA, CD56 and TTF-1. The features were in keeping with a malignant peritoneal mesothelioma infiltrating the small bowel wall. Conclusion: Peritoneal malignant mesothelioma is an uncommon tumour which rarely causes mechanical small bowel obstruction. To our knowledge this is the first case of localised primary peritoneal mesothelioma presenting with intussusceptions.",

Chouchene, M. H. Balti, K. Bellil * FSI Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Marsa, Tunisia Objective: Cystic lymphangioma is a rare benign neoplasm arising from the lymphatic system. It occurs as a result of congenital malformations of the lymphatics, leading to the obstruction of local lymph flow and the development of lymphangiectasia. Lymphangioma is common in pediatric patients, but it is extremely rare in adults, with only about 100 cases reported in literature. Most lymphangiomas are found in the head and neck; intraabdominal and specially mesenteric locations are very unusual. The aim of this work was to study its clinical, histological and therapeutic features and their diagnostic difficulties. Method: We report the case of a 46 years-old woman, who presented a painful syndrome of the right iliac fossae (RIF). The physical examination found a mass of the RIF. Abdominal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance image showed a mesenteric cystic formation. At laparotomy, a large cystic tumor of the caecal mesentery, measuring 23 cm, was found. Histopathology showed a fibrous and thin walled cyst, lined by flat low lying epithelium with surrounding tissue of scattered lymphoid cells. Results: The diagnosis of cystic lymphangioma was retained. Conclusion: Mesenteric lymphangiomas are very rare, but they can cause acute abdomen that requires an emergent surgery. Therefore, they should be included in the differential diagnosis of cystic intra-abdominal lesions raises several possibilities, including both malignant and benign soft tissue tumours. Objective: The spleen metastases from colon cancer are rare conditions and usually associated with extensive disease. There are only eight reports in English-language literature of isolated splenic metastases from colorectal carcinoma, which generally metastasize to regional lymph nodes, liver and abdominal peritoneum. Method: We report a case of multiple splenic metastases in a 60-year-old woman. Results: In November 2009, the patient had undergone right hemicolectomy, lymphadenectomy and chemotherapy for stage III tubular adenocarcinoma of the ascendant colon with positive pericolic lymph nodes. In December 2011, she was admitted in our hospital for diffuse abdominal pain and intestinal transit disorders. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed multiple metastases of different sizes in liver and spleen. During the surgery, which was performed with the goal of curing metastatic disease, there were found two nodular hepatic secondary tumors, and numerous spleen metastases, with diameters from 0.2 cm to 1.5 cm. The histopathological evaluation of splenectomy specimen revealed a metastatic tumor deposit, histologically similar to the primary tubular adenocarcinomas of colon. Conclusion: This is the ninth documented case of splenic metastasis from colon cancer. Previously reported cases of this type were isolated tumor, this one being the first reported with multiple splenic metastases.",

Our aims were to evaluate the role of FAS expression in differential diagnosis of IBD, to search for any possible change during the progression of the disease in patients with clinical and endoscopic follow-up. Method: Among 82 colonoscopic biopsy samples of 50 UC cases,13 samples were classified as remission,15 as resolution, and 54 as active period;35 samples of 30 Crohn Disease (CD) cases were classified as active period. Fifteen cases with normal endoscopic and morphologic findings comprised the control group. Results: Between UC and CD active periods and control group, a significant difference was found (p=0,0001). There was a statistical correlation between FAS expression of basal crypt of normal mucosa in UC active period and the disease duration (p=0,036). Conclusion: The increasing in FAS expression in patients with IBD can not be explained only by the inflammation. FAS expression can not aid us in the differential diagnosis of UC and CD, but it seems that it is related to the extent of inflammation in UC. The relation between the disease duration and an increase in FAS expression active UC, might have a significant role in carcinogenesis in UC.",

Micropneumatosis is often secondary to intestinal bacterial infection or mechanical factors. This study evaluates the incidence of micropneumatosis in our institute. Method: We analyzed all cases of micropneumatosis obtained in our institute between 2001 and 2011. Available data were retrieved from patients' records. Results: Out of 300.000 specimens obtained between 2001 and 2011, 71 cases (0.02 %) presented with micropneumatosis (37 female, 34 male; mean age 61 years, age range 18 to 85 years). Most common site was the colon (32 cases), followed by stomach (30), small intestine (8) and greater omentum (1). Conclusion: Micropneumatosis represents a rare but harmless diagnosis in gastrointestinal specimen. Due to the histological picture, which may be confused with dilated lymphatic vessels, submucosal lipomas, and, to the untrained eye, even with signet ring cell carcinoma, incidence may even be higher. In unclear cases, where there seems to be a endothelial layer, immunohistochemistry may be necessary to confirm diagnosis of micropneumatosis. This study shows that micropneumatosis should be considered in differential diagnosis in every age and sex.",

Method: Local excision is an attractive treatment option for colorectal cancer, but is only safe in the absence of LNM. Several pathological factors have been associated with LNM, however it remains unclear how to integrate these in clinical decision making. Results: A Pubmed search revealed 17 studies totaling 3741 patients. Strong predictors of LNM were lymphatic invasion (RR 5.2 [95 % CI 4.0-6.8]), budding (RR 5.1 [95 % CI 3.6-7.3]), and high grade histology (RR 4.8 [95 % CI 3.3-6.9]). Deep submucosal invasion was also strongly associated with LNM, however in a risk stratification model this factor was of limited added value. Conclusion: The absence of lymphatic invasion, budding and high grade histology may justify withholding radical surgery. The independent role of submucosal invasion depth is probably limited. Models for risk stratification based on these factors need to be validated. Objective: Dendritic S100+ cells in intestines have been described in more studies. Their connection to S100+ fibres of nervous system is lesser of an object of interest. Method: We have processed the samples of intestinal mucosa of people with Crohn's disease and colitis ulcerosa by the means of form-paraffine technique and anti S100 antibodies. Results: In lamina propria and in submucosa at Crohn's disease were S100+ the fibres of various width and orientation. Outside of them the diffusely scattered round S100+ mononuclear cells could be seen. Contrary to colitis ulcerosa the granulation tissue at Crohn's disease contains in the area around abscesses a thick accumulation of S100+ cells and this is similar also in the formed lymphoid tissue. Conclusion: The positive fibres can be seen in submucosa at the edge as well as in LPM between the bases of the glands. In between the plexus/ring and longitudinal muscle there are massive bands of connective tissue which contains bundles S100+ of ganglion cells and nerve fibres. The fibres are present in ring as well as in longitudinal muscle. In this area S100+ fibres can also be seen in vessel walls. Numerous bundles of granulatory tissue do not contain positively reacting substance. In the basal part lamina propria there are visible S100+ cells as well as long, smooth, positively reacting fibres.",

One of the most common clinical patterns in IID is chronic colitis. Ncf1-mutation in mice leads to deficiency in ROS, rendering them susceptible to autoimmunity. Here we studies how ROS-deficiency in Ncf1-mutant mice influenced the immune response to DSS colitis, its recovery and answer to a second induction. Method: Colitis was induced in wild type (WT) and Ncf1mutant (Ncf1) B10.Q mice by administration of 3.5 % DSS in the drinking water for 1 week. After 1 week recovery, DSS was administered for another week. Mice were sacrificed at days 0, 7, 14 and 21, the colon was removed and folded into a Swiss roll. Sections of the colon were stained with HE, and monoclonal antibodies against B cells (B220), CD3+ T cells; and macrophages (Mac1/CD11b) were applied. Results: Colitis was more severe in Ncf1 than WT mice, with epithelial dysplasia, hyperplasia of Peyer's patches and poor epithelium recovery (hyaline scars). At all time-points the amount and location of colonic B cells, T cells and CD11b + cells was distinct between groups.

It can occur in either an acute or in a chronic form and may affect various organs. Intestinal GVHD is particularly important because of its frequency, severity and its effects on the general condition of the patient. Method: Here we report a 68-year-old man who developed GVHD, 8 months after receiving allogeneic non-myeloablative peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Colonic biopsies revealed an edematous and congested lamina propria, dilated crypts lined by flattened epithelium, increased apoptotic figures and vanishing crypts. Notably there were some giant cells in between crypts. However subsequent sections and special stains didn't show any granuloma formation or presence of an infectious agent. Results: To our knowledge presence of giant cells in GVHD hasn't received proper attention before. Although we don't know the actual importance or clinical consequences of the entity yet, we report this case to increase awareness of this feature within the context of GVHD. We have seen more cases with giant cell GVHD afterwards; comparison with other cases of GVHD without giant cells may help clarifying their significance.",

Ensari * Ankara University, Faculty of Medicine, Turkey Objective: Colorectal carcinomas develop through adenomatous or serrated neoplastic sequence. Different molecular mechanisms underly these morphologic sequences which may be translated into different therapies. We aimed to assess adenomatous and serrated neoplastic sequences in terms of KRAS and BRAF mutations. Method: The study group comprised of adenomatous polyps (APs, n=20, 13.6 %), conventional adenocarcinomas (ConCA, n = 30, 20.4 %), serrated polyps (SPs, n = 67, 45.6 %) and mucinous adenocarcinoma (MucCA, n=30, 20.4 %). KRAS mutation was assessed for exon 2 and exon 3 using pyrosequencing while BRAF V600E mutation was analysed using allele specific PCR. Chi square test was used for statistics. Results: KRAS mutations were observed in 41.5 % of carcinomas and 25.3 % of polyps. KRAS mutation rate was significantly higher (p<0.05) in ConCA (85 %) than in MucCA (50 %), and in APs (55 %) than in SPs (16.4 %). BRAF mutation was found in one MucCA (1.7 %) while all SPs were mutated. TSAs had the highest KRAS mutation rate (36.8 %) in comparison to SSA/Ps (17.6 %) (p<0.001) whereas SSA/Ps and HPs had significantly higher rates of BRAF mutation (64.7 %, 61.1 %, respectively) than TSAs (26.3 %) (p<0.001). Conclusion: KRAS seems to take part in adenomatous sequence while BRAF, seem to play a significant role in serrated neoplastic progression of the colorectum. Objective: Quiescent ulcerative colitis (Q-UC) is morphologically characterized by typical architectural and cellular mucosal changes that define the process as chronic. It is not clear which of these changes are more ubiquitous in Q-UC. Our aim was to evaluate which classical histological findings of Q-UC are more prevalent in rectal samples. Method: Rectal biopsies were collected from patients with clinical and endoscopical Q-UC. The biopsies were evaluated for mixed inflammation in the lamina propria, crypt architectural abnormalities, basal plasmacytosis, fibrosis, and Paneth cell metaplasia as well as for features of active disease (cryptitis, lamina propria neutrophils and erosion). Results: Forty-five patients (64 % female; median age 56 years) were included. Thirteen (28,9 %) biopsies showed focal activity and four cases (8,9 %) had criteria for active disease. Epithelial distortion, chronic inflammatory infiltrate and basal plasmacytosis emerged as features present in 95, 81 and 73 % of biopsies. Overall, 4 biopsies were histologically normal (no chronic features, no active disease). Conclusion: Rectal mucosa from patients with clinical and endoscopical Q-UC can show microscopic active disease, which illustrates that endoscopy alone may be insufficient to identify quiescent disease. In Q-UC, the most frequent changes (present in over 75 % of the biopsies) were epithelial distortion and chronic inflammatory infiltrate.",

Cervera * H\u00f4pital Saint-Antoine, Dept. de Anatomie Pathologique, Paris, France Objective: In Pathology, an alternative to immediate fixation in neutral buffered formalin (NBF) is vacuum sealing and cooling (VSC) (\"Tissue safe\" system). There have been few evaluations of VCS. Method: We assessed MSI, KRAS, BRAF in colorectal cancers, conserved with VCS before fixation (51 cases with surgery in a hospital distant from our centre), or immediately fixed in NBF (56 cases with surgery during the same period in our hospital). DNA was extracted from paraffin embedded tissue. MSI was assessed by MLH1 and MSH2 immunohistochemistry and PCR; KRAS and BRAF were screened by multiwell-plate based real-time PCR (LightCy-cler\u00ae 480, Roche), confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Results: There was no difference regarding morphological analysis. Immunohistochemistry was interpretable in all cases, with 4 negative cases in the VCS group (4 MLH1), 11 negative cases in the NBF group (10 MLH1, 1 MSH2), and a 100 % correlation between immunohistochemistry and PCR. DNA extraction was possible in all cases. KRAS and BRAF mutations were detected in 21 and 1 cases in the VCS group and 16 and 7 cases in the NBF group, respectively. Conclusion: We show that analysis of MSI, KRAS and BRAF is feasible in surgical specimens after VCS. This procedure can be an alternative to formalin fixation.",

M1 macrophages promote tumoricidal responses whereas M2 macrophages assist tumor progression and metastasis. In this study, we have analyzed a clinical significance of M2 macrophages in excised sections from patients with colorectal cancer. Method: Patients who had surgical resection for colorectal cancer between 2005 and 2006 were identified from a prospective database. Tissue sections with adenocarcinoma in pT3 category were employed in this study. The sections were stained with anti-CD204, a marker of M2 macrophages. The relation between the staining pattern and tumor budding or patient prognosis was examined. Results: Fifty-two patients (30 male, 22 female) with a median age of 67 years (range 23-86) were studied. The tumors were classified into four subtypes according to the staining patterns of CD204-positive cells, i.e. sparse type (n=9), invading-tip type (n=6), peri-nest type (n=18), and dense diffuse type (n=19). Only a dense diffuse type was related to the high degree of tumor budding. The prognosis with a dense diffuse type demonstrated a poor prognosis as compared to the other types. Conclusion: Even the case with comparable tumor depth, CD204-positive macrophages with dense diffuse distribution was related to the poor prognosis. Objective: The treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer has shown a significant development over the last decade. The total mesorectal excision and the use of pre-operative radio (chemo)-therapy are leading the patients to a gradual improvement of local control of the disease. The aim of this study is to evaluate the pathological tumour response to pre-operative treatment through correlation between the clinical stage (cTNM) and the pathological stage (ypTNM). Method: Since 2009, 35 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, assessed by high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) and TNM staging system, have been evaluated by the Colorrectal Multidisciplinary Team. Pre-operative radio (chemo)-therapy was mandatory before undertaking standard surgery.

Results: Lower CD68 infiltration in tumor nests was associated with expression of TGF-beta1 (chi2 = 9.236, \u0440 = 0.002) and Smad4 (chi2=2.871, \u0440=0.090) in tumor cells and with TGFRII expression (chi2=5.699, \u0440=0.017) in tumor cells membranes.

In the colon, we report the 25th case of IMT. Method: Case presentation Results: We report the case of a 56-year old male who presented with symptoms suggesting colon cancer. A 20 mm protruded tumor was endoscopically described in the ascending colon. Right hemicolectomy was performed. Macroscopically the tumor was well defined, covered by normal mucosa with a central depressed area, suggesting a GIST (Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor). Microscopically spindle cells with fascicular arrangement admixed with mononuclear leukocytes were observed. The tumor cells expressed Vimentin, SMA, Desmin and ALK and were CD34 and CD117 negative. Intense angiogenesis and CD117 expression in the endothelial cells were also observed. Conclusion: In the IMT of the colon, clinical endoscopic and gross feature can imitate a carcinoma or a GIST. The IHC pattern of IMT can offer informations about its histogenesis. Based on the immunophenotype, we hypothesize that this tumor seems to occur from the the pluripotent stromal cells, CD34 positive which can be either differentiated in the interstitial cells of Cajal (telocytes), which are also CD34 positive or, during differentiation, can loss CD34 positivity. Objective: Determining the fraction of tumor cells in colon carcinoma samples analyzed for KRAS mutation is important for choosing the proper testing modality. However, when asked to determine tumor cell fraction in tissue samples, different pathologists give considerably different estimations, possibly leading to erroneous interpretation of KRAS mutation analysis results and poor treatment choices. Method: We developed a free, easy to use computer program that estimates tumor cell fraction on colon carcinoma slides that are immune-stained with anti-cytokeratin antibody. Sixty samples were evaluated by the program and results were compared to actual measurement of tumor fraction. Results: The tumor cell fraction estimated by the computer program showed highly significant correlation with the actual measurements (R=0.64, p<0.001). Additionally, we found that a short calibration step prior to beginning the computer estimation increased the accuracy of the results. In four cases (7 %) there was some discrepancy between the computer estimation and the actual measurements, however, this was attributed to lower quality immunohistochemical staining. Conclusion: In conclusion, we believe that this program can be used for standardizing the evaluation of tumor cell fraction in colon carcinoma, and that its use might aid in making better diagnosis and treatment choices for these patients.",

No difference in N stage, extra-mural vascular invasion or involved non-peritonealised resection margin has yet been observed.

Perforated diverticular disease of the transverse colon is therefore very rare. We present a case of Crohns disease complicating transverse diverticular disease that lead to perforation and unfortunate death. Method: Radiological and histopathological features are presented with a review of the literature Results: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Crohns disease complicating diverticular disease of the transverse colon. We suggest that distal stricturing leading to increased intraluminal pressure or increased weakening of the colonic wall due to coincident Crohns fissure and diverticulum are possible pathogenic mechanisms. Conclusion: Crohns disease complicating transverse diverticular disease is uncommon, but may be one pathogenesis leading to the rare event of transverse colon diverticular perforation. Results: There were 12 episodes in 9 patients. They start between day 7 and 499 (178\u00b1159 days). Duration ranged from 3 to 87 days (27\u00b122). The three moderate and the three mild AR reversed with treatment. Of the 6 severe AR, 3 caused the failure of the graft. Five episodes de AR began as moderate or severe directly. Severity in the course of each episode was fluctuating. Sixteen indeterminate rejections were seen in 9 grafts (did not reach definitive criteria). They lasted 1-31 days (mean: 5\u00b18 days).

Histology usually confirms the clinical suspicion of acute inflammation, but sometimes other clinically relevant diagnoses are made. The aim of our study was to audit the appendectomies at our institution and summarise atypical pathological findings with emphasis on benign and malignant tumours. Method: We reviewed the histopathology results of 496 consecutive appendectomies received in a 5-year period. Results: Excluding three cases of metastatic process, appendiceal tumour was found in 21 cases (4.2 %), which is a higher rate than reported in the literature. There were four endocrine tumours, all G1, three cases of classical adenomas, 10 cases of low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (one associated with pseudomyxoma peritonei) and three cases of carcinoma (one mucinous adenocarcinomas, one intestinal type, one undifferentiated carcinoma). We also diagnosed one case of multicystic mesothelioma. Endometriosis was diagnosed in seven cases. In 18 cases appendicitis was associated with diverticula, in 6 cases changes were suggestive for Crohn's disease and in one case for cystic fibrosis. Negative appendectomy rate was 10.3 % that falls within the range reported in the literature. Conclusion: Histopathological examination of appendectomy specimens may reveal many different conditions not previously suspected; therefore, it should be performed in all cases. Results: CDX2, MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC6 expression was observed in 39.7 % (75 cases), 35.4 % (67 cases), 27.5 % (52 cases), 28.6 % (54 cases), and 16.9 % (32 cases), respectively. While SIAC patients with CDX2 expression showed less nodal metastasis (p=0.01), those with MUC1 expression tended to have SIACs with nodular or infiltrative growth (p = 0.003), poor differentiation (p = 0.005), and more lymphatic invasion (p=0.04). MUC5AC expression was associated with SIACs with well differentiation (p=0.02) and frequent pancreatic invasion (p=0.04). Patients with CDX2+/MUC1-had more polypoid (p=0.02) and well differentiated (p=0.006) tumors and a significantly better survival (median, 80.8 months, p<0.0001) than those with other immunophenotypes (CDX2\u2212/MUC1+, CDX2+/ MUC1+, and CDX2\u2212/MUC1\u2212). Patients with CDX2 expression (median, 71.2 months) had a significantly better survival than those without CDX2 expression (23.0 months) by univariate and multivariate analyses (p<0.0001).

However, it is controversial whether radical surgery is indicated in tumors measuring >2 cm. We report a case of a 13-year-old girl with acute appendicitis in whom appendectomy and right-sided hemicolectomy were performed. Method: Surgical specimens were sampled and processed according to standard histological and immunohistochemical (IHK) procedures. Results: In the base of appendix, there was a tumor measuring 1.5 cm in diameter, focally invading mesoappendix, with free resection margins. Microscopically, tumor exhibited characteristic features of NET G1, with positive IHK for chromogranine and synaptophysin, and Ki67 index <2 %. IHK for podoplanin revealed focal lymphovascular invasion. In the right-sided hemicolectomy specimen, there was no residual tumor, metastasis was found in one ilecoecal lymphnode. Conclusion: Our case shows that appendiceal NET smaller than 2 cm can metastasize to regional lymphnodes. IHK against podoplanin might be helpful in searching for lymphovascular invasion, helping to separate it from the retraction clefts, thus providing additional information concerning risk factors for a more aggressive behavior.",

            "text": "Objective: CXC chemokines enhance tumor cell survival and proliferation. Especially CXCR4 promotes tumor development by stimulating angiogenesis and favoring metastasis. In contrast, CXCR3 is angiostatic and may exert an anti-tumor effect. Since tumor budding is linked to vascular/lymphatic invasion and lymph node (LN) and/or distant metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC), here we explored the expression of CXCR3+4 in relation to tumor budding. Method: A multiple-punch tissue microarray of 220 CRCs with full clinicopathological information including therapy underwent immunohistochemistry for CXCR3 and CXCR4. Expression was evaluated in tumor-center, -front and -buds and correlated to clinical data. Results: CXCR3-expression was homogeneous throughout tumor-center, -front and -buds (average 40 %) and was unrelated to clinicopathological features or survival. CXCR4-expression was high in tumor-center and -front but reduced (p<0.001) in buds (76 %, 77 %, and 20 %, respectively). Maintenace of CXCR4-expression within buds was predictive of LN-positivity (p<0.0001) and lymphatic invasion (p<0.0001) but not of venous invasion or distant metastasis. CXCR4-positivity in buds was associated to poor outcome (p=0.0048) in LN-negative CRCs (p=0.0191). Conclusion: Maintenance of CXCR4-expression in buds has a profound effect on tumor aggressiveness and prognosis in LN-negative CRC-patients. This would help in establishing a tumor budding \"profile\" especially linked to LNmetastasis in CRC. Objective: COX-2 expression was investigated in colorectal cancer and colorectal precancerous lesions. Its expression in adenomas is associated with increasing size and neoplastic potential. Little is known about COX-2 expression in subtypes of serrated colonic polyps, which constitute substantial number of colon cancer precursors. The aim of the study was to assess COX-2 expression in serrated polyps of the colon and to investigate its potential discriminative role. Method: 175 consecutive serrated polyps were analyzed. They included: 26 traditional serrated adenomas (TSA), 36 sessile serrated polyps (SSP) and 113 hyperplastic polyps (HP). COX-2 expression was assessed semi-quantitatively (0-3). Kruskall-Wallis test was used for the comparison of COX-2 expression between serrated categories (\u03b1=0.05). Objective: In colorectal cancer (CRC), tumor buds represent a more aggressive tumor cell type at the invasive front with apparently low proliferation. The aim of this study was to determine the proliferation potential of tumor buds by comparing Ki67 staining across different tumor areas and adjacent normal tissue. Method: Whole tissue sections from 197 patients with CRC underwent immunohistochemistry for Ki67. 10 high-powerfields were evaluated for each of the following regions: normal mucosa, tumor center, tumor front and tumor buds. Ki67-positivity was correlated to patient outcome. Results: Average Ki67-positivity was 5.2 % in normal mucosa and significantly higher in the tumor center (38.2 %; p < 0.0001) and invasion front (34.9 %; p < 0.0001). Strikingly, only 0.3 % of all tumor buds showed Ki67-positivity (p<0.0001). Although Ki67-positivity in the tumor center or front was unassociated with clinicopathological features or patient survival, the greater the number of Ki67-positive tumor buds, the worse the prognosis. This effect was also found after adjusting from TNM stage (HR (95 % CI): 2.25 (1.1-4.5); p=0.0193)). Conclusion: A marked absence of Ki67 staining is found in most tumor buds, suggesting a substantially decreased proliferation rate. However, the association of Ki67-positivity with worse prognosis in 15 % of cases points towards a heterogeneous population of tumor buds.",

Objective: EGFR plays an important role in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and represents a natural target for molecular anticancer drugs. In this study we evaluated 800 consecutive CRC aimed to analyze K-Ras mutational status in relationship to: different clinical-pathological parameters, EGFR immunohistochemical (IHC) expression, response to cetuximab treatment. Method: K-Ras mutations and EGFR expression were determined by direct cycle sequencing and IHC respectively in 565 surgical specimens and 235 biopsies. IHC findings were evaluated using four different score systems. Results: The distribution of K-Ras mutations did not significantly vary between surgical or bioptic specimens or with respect to different anatomic tumor localization. In contrast, K-Ras is more frequently mutated in EGFR negative/low score tumors than in positive ones (p<0.0001). Focusing on the 419 surgical treated CRC patients, we found a higher percentage of K-Ras mutations in T4 CRC (p=0.01) and in younger patients (p=0.002). Finally, we observed that 6 % of primary CRC, concomitantly evaluated with their paired metastases, changed K-Ras mutational status during progression. Conclusion: Our data showed that tumor size, patient age and EGFR IHC expression significantly influenced K-Ras mutations. Interestingly, we observed that cetuximab treated patients, had a better clinical outcome when EGFR presented a high IHC score.",

CRC has a heterogenous molecular background with known prognostic and predictive markers, but the whole picture is rather complex with many unexplored connections. Method: We performed multiple immunohistochemical stainings on tissue microarrays (TMA) made of 95 CRC cases to study the correlations between EGFR-RAS, cell cycling, apoptosis, cell adhesion and tumor invasion pathways. We evaluated digitized slides using matrix scores considering both the frequency and positivity of cells and statistical analysis followed. Results: We found strong linear correlation between positivity and (p-1068, p-1173) phosphorylation of the EGFR receptor and p53 positivity detected with different clones. Furthermore, phospho-NF-KB p65 positivity was strongly linked to Survivin-expression. Conclusion: Activation of EGFR-related pathways including NF-kB is a key factor in CRC-growth. The strong link between cancer promoting EGFR signaling and the mutational lack of the p53 driven apoptosis suggests a deadly cooperation, which can be further aggravated by forced tumor survival through survivin. Correlation of these markers potentially predict poor disease outcome but can be specifically targeted by the upcoming new molecules of tailored therapy. Objective: KRAS mutational status is important in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). It is unclear, however, which is the most informative tissue source for study in CRC cases showing more than one tumor mass.

KRAS mutation hotspots in codon 12 and 13 were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and sequentiation. wt-KRAS cases were confirmed with the KRAS StripAssay TM. Objective: Lynch syndrome (LS), the most frequent form of hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC), is caused by germline mutations in the mismatch repair system genes. A recently identified mechanism involving the EPCAM gene is responsible for 6.3 % of MSH2-negative LS cases. We herein explore EPCAM protein expression in LS-associated, MSH2-negative CRCs to evaluate its potential value in the algorithmic approach to LS population screening. Method: We studied a total of 19 MSH2-negative CRCs from 14 different patients in whom we were able to perform a complete germline analysis. Expression of both MSH2 (1:200 dilution, clone G219-1129, Pharmingen) and EPCAM (1:100 dilution, clone Ber-EP4, Dako) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: Nine patients showed a deleterious germline mutation that involved the MSH2 gene in three instances and the EPCAM gene exon 9 in six instances. All patients harbouring the EPCAM mutation belonged to the same family. Of the19 CRCs, EPCAM expression loss was seen in only five, all of them were from patients with a germline EPCAM deletion. Conclusion: Due to the high specificity of EPCAM protein loss for identifying LS patients with an EPCAM deletion, we recommend adding EPCAM IHC to the LS diagnostic algorithm in MSH2-negative CRC cases. Objective: Colorectal carcinoma with signet ring cell component (CRC-SRC) is a rare and distinct subtype with little molecular information. We investigated the frequency of BRAF mutation in 28 CRC-SRCs and its relation with clinicopathologic parameters. Method: We categorized tumors into groups 0-9 %, 10-24 %, 25-49 % and >50 % according to signet ring cell component. Genomic DNA was isolated from parafin blocks and analyzed for BRAF V600E mutation by polymerase chain reactionrestriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Results: Eleven of cases showed BRAF mutation (39.3 %). The results were also confirmed with sequence. No statistically significant differences were found in clinicopatologic parameters between BRAF wild-type and mutant CRC-SRC. On the other hand, when we adjusted age, gender, percentage of signet ring compenent and stage, we found a statistically significant increased risk in BRAF mutant group compared to BRAF wild-type in Cox regression analysis (HR=7.68, 95 % CI=1.06-55.78, p=0,044) Conclusion: BRAF mutation is frequent in CRC-SRCs. This finding may support its diverse molecular pathogenesis and could have important therapeutic implications for those patients. To clarify the relation of BRAF mutation with clinicopathologic parameters and prognosis in CRC-SRC, studies with multi-instutional larger series are needed.",

Infrequently lipomas may also present in the form of multiple polypoid masses in the colon. We present a 69-years old female with 3 submucosal lipomas and a coexisting adenocarcinoma of transverse colon. Method: 69-years old female patient was admitted to hospital because of rectal bleeding for 3 months. Colonoscopic examination revealed mucosaly intact polypoid tumoral masses and an ulcerated tumoral mass in transverse colon. Biopsy of the ulcerated mass was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma. Extended right hemicolectomy was performed. Results: Grossly, ulcerated tumor was 1,5\u00d71\u00d70,4 cm and there were 3 polypoid tumors in cecal area of the right colon which were 2.5-2.0-1.5 cm in their greatest dimensions. Polypoid tumors were yellow, lipomatous on cut surfaces. Microscopically ulcerated tumor was composed of adenocarcinoma morphology and the other polypoid tumors were composed of submucosal mature adipocytes with a thin capsule around them. The diagnosis was colonic adenocarcinoma (pT1N0M0) and submucosal lipomas of colon. The patient had no additional therapy and she is healthy with no evidence of recurrence. Conclusion: This case is presented to remind that there may be multiple lipomas of colon with coexisting malignant epithelial tumors. Objective: Primary liposarcoma of the small intestine is exceedingly rare. To our knowledge, only 7 cases have been reported so far. We report a case of the primary myxoid liposarcoma of the ileum. Method: The patient was 77-year-old woman. CT and MRI revealed a 6-cm-intrapelvic mass, which was proved to be a tumor of the distal part of the ileum, and, therefore, partial ileectomy was performed. Results: The tumor was 6.7\u00d76.3\u00d73.7 cm in size, relatively well circumscribed and located within the intestinal wall without invasion to the neighboring tissues. Microscopically, the tumor had mixture of cellular and myxoid areas, showing proliferation of short spindle and stellate shaped cells in a delicate capillary vasculature. Univacuolated tumor cells and a small number of lipoblast-like cells were also seen. Immunohistochemically, these proliferating cells were positive for S-100 protein. According to these pathological findings, we diagnosed the tumor as myxoid liposarcoma. FISH methods showed the tumor had chromosomal translocation t(12;16)(q13;p11). Conclusion: The differential diagnosis of this includes other spindle cell tumors such as GIST and myogenic tumors. But we could arrive at the proper pathological diansosis following the above morphological features and the specific chromosomal translocation. We will also discuss the clinico-pathological features of the cases including ours.",

Method: The expression of E-cadherin, \u03b2-catenin, tenascin C, KAI-1, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was studied immunohistochemically and correlated clinicopathologically in 72 primary colorectal carcinoma cases (26 with metastatic lymph nodes). 17 patients (24 %) developed haematogenous metastases at median 6,5 months postoperatively (3-11). Results: Expression of following markers significantly correlated with depth of tumour invasion: cytoplasmic accumulation of E-cadherin (p=0,035), nuclear staining for \u03b2-catenin (p=0,03), increased tenascin C expression (p=0,001), and loss of EGFR and VEGF expression (p=0,015 and 0,02, respectively). Decreased tenascin C and KAI-1 expression associated with the presence of lymph node metastases (p= 0,027 and 0,046, respectively). Weak cytoplasmic E-cadherin expression correlated with distant metastases (p=0,045). Conclusion: Our results suggest that abnormal expression of proteins involved in cell adhesion and migration (E-cadherin, \u03b2catenin, tenascin C, EGFR) and angiogenesis (VEGF) may be related to the invasion of colorectal carcinoma. Detecting the expression of E-cadherin, tenascin C and KAI-1 probably possesses clinical significance in evaluating lymph node and distant metastasis and predicting the prognosis of colorectal cancer. Objective: In colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRCs) microsatellite instability (MSI) can be documented by immunohistochemical detection of mismatch repair proteins (MMR). The aim of the present study is to identify the percentage of MSI-positive CRCs, in the Epirus region of Greece and compare it to the international data. Method: A total of 50 cases of sporadic CRCs, 25 adenomas and 10 hyperplastic polyps, formalin-fixed paraffinembedded, were examined immunohistochemically using standard methods (En Vision system), with the antibodies MLH1 (Clone ES05), MSH6 (Clone PU29) and PMS2 (Clone M0R4G) (Novocastra-Menarini). Immunostained sections were evaluated semi-quantitatively, taking in account the percentage of neoplastic positive cells and estimating nuclear staining intensity, compared to the internal positive controls (normal epithelium, lymphocytes). Results: All hyperplastic polyps and adenomas expressed the examined MMR. Two out of 50 CRCs were negative for MSH6 and PMS2, while one of them was also negative for MLH1. Interestingly, one of these two CRCs had an adjacent adenoma, which also showed negative staining for MSH6 and PMS2. Conclusion: Immunohistochemical staining for MMR is possible in archival material. Loss of MMR varies, depending on the protein examined. In CRCs from the Epirus region the estimated loss of at least two MMR is 4 %. Objective: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent neutral endopeptidases collectively capable of degrading essentially all extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Genetic alterations in MMP-2 and MMP-9 have been implicated to play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis (CRC). The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothetic correlations between the MMP-2 and 9 mRNA expression and the clinicopathologic variables of the CRC. Method: The expression of MMP-2 and -9 mRNA was assayed by RT-PCR for 53 Tunisian sporadic colorectal adenocarcinomas. Results: MMP-2 was highly expressed in the 53 cases. MMP-9 was not detected in 18 cases and moderately or highly expressed in 35 cases. Absence of MMP-9 mRNA expression was significantly related to an advanced tumoral invasion stage (pT3) (p=0.003). Conclusion: Our study suggests that the overexpression of MMP-2 could be the result of an imbalance in the system of transcriptional regulation of MMP-2, which would involve the loss of expression or activity of its inhibitor: TIMP-2. A variable expression of transcripts of MMP-9 could be explained by the hypothesis of hypermethylation of the promoter or degradation of its transcript after protein translation.",

Results: No significant associations were found regarding MMP-2 (-1306 C/T) polymorphism and CRC susceptibility. There was a connection between the MMP-2-1306 promoter polymorphism and gender (p = 0.012). The MMP-9 (\u22121562 C/T) was significantly associated with CRC (OR= 2.39 [1.023 to 5.58]). No implication of MMP-9-1562 promoter polymorphism in the clinicopathological parameters of CRC was evident.

Method: We report a case of Hodgkin`s lymphoma in a 37 years old male patient with corticosteroid-dependent Crohn\u00b4Disease (CD) who had been medicated with azathioprine for many years. In the last 4 years he began periodical therapy with infliximab, till the time when he complained of worsening of symptoms and the appearance of asthenia, tenesmus and weight loss. Infliximab was withdrawn and replaced by adalimumab. A colonoscopy with several biopsies revealed the presence of a Hodgkin Lymphoma. Results: The histological examination revealed granulation tissues where we identified atypical cells (Reed-Sternberg cells) with the following immunohistological staining: CD30+, CD15+, LMP1 + LCA-, CD20-, CD3-, ALK-. These results in conjunction with the morphological aspects and the clinical history of CD favored the diagnosis of Hodgkin Lymphoma in a patient with preceding CD. The patient was subjected to radical colectomy. Postoperative pathological examination showed CD with involvement of the distal rectum by Hodgkin's lymphoma. Conclusion: The present report may serve as a reminder to clinicians of the possibility of occult lymphoma in patients with colonic CD treated with biological therapy. Objective: DNA mismatch repair (MMR) status in sporadic colonic cancers (CCs) had provided valuable prognostic and predictive information in the appropriate clinical setting; however there are no definitive guidelines for microsatellite instability (MSI) testing. We evaluated the expression of MMR proteins and correlated them with outcome in a cohort of patients with sporadic colon cancer. Method: We reviewed 352 cases of sporadic stage II colonic cancer from Abril 27th 1995 to December 12th 2009. Clinical data including tumor grade, prognostic factors, therapy and outcome were searched for. Tissue microarrays using a manual Beecher system were constructed and stained with antibodies for MLH1, MSH2, PMS2 and MSH6. Results: 8 % (28) of 352 CCs had loss of expression of one or more MMR proteins, including defect in 1 protein 3.7 % (13), 2 proteins 3,7 % (13) and tree proteins 0,6 %(2). The mean overall survival was 144 months with no significant differences in patients between microsatellite stable and unstable tumors. Conclusion: We detected a fairly low prevalence of the loss of immunohistochemical expression of MMR proteins.

In this study, we compared the morphology of lymph nodes and the amount of plasma cells in the interfollicular region of lymph nodes in rectal tumour surgical excision material, between two groups who had received and not received NT prior to surgery. Method: Fifty cases with NT and forty cases without NT were included. The number and diameter of lymph nodes were recorded. The morphology of the lymph nodes were evaluated, and the percentages of interfollicular plasma cells were demonstrated immunohistochemically (CD138). Tumor regression grade was assessed using Mandard scoring system. Results: Average number and diameter of lymph nodes were greater in patients without NT (p<0,05). Atrophy of germinal centers was noted as 54 % in NT group, versus 5 %. The amount of plasma cells in the interfollicular region was found to be higher than fifty-one percent in 54 % of NT group versus 5 % (p<0,05), as well.

Conclusion: NT leads to a decrease in the volume of the lymph nodes and atrophy of germinal centers, conversely, causes stimulation of the proliferation of interfollicular plasma cells.",

Method: A 63-year old man with severe pain, intussusception and ileus underwent a resection of a part of the intestine containing a tumor mass acting as a lead point. Tissue was analysed using H&E, histochemical and immunohistochemical stains. Results: Lesion located in the mucosa, submucosa and muscularis propria consisted of glandular structures varying in size and morphology, the larger ones containing papillary projections and the smaller ones being similar to Brunner's and peribiliary glands, both of them surrounded by smooth muscle bundles. The lesion was not accompanied by ectopic pancreas, and it indicated a diagnosis of adenomyoma of the ileum. Glandular elements were CK7+ and CK20\u2212 and CDX-2\u2212, opposite to intestinal mucosa. Conclusion: Adenomyoma is a mass lesion rarely found distal to the duodenum, which bares close clinical and morfological resemblance to a tumor and some non-neoplastic conditions. Cytokeratin expression favors the heterotopic pancreas theory of pathogenesis, but abnormal interaction between the endoderm-and mesoderm-derived tissues can not be excluded.",

Smoothelin is a robust marker of the MP in normal colon, not expressed in MM.We analysed it value for distinguishing MP and MM near carcinomas. Objective: Tuberculosis can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Anal localization, in particular, has a very low incidence (0,7 %). Method: A 66 year-old male presented, complaining of perianal pain, constipation, weight loss of 5 kilos the last 4 months and night sweating. Physical examination was normal, except for an ulcerated lesion in the anal region. The patient was submitted to computerized tomography (CT) and incisional biopsy of the lesion. Results: The CT of the chest revealed multiple, scattered, calcified nodules in the upper zones of both lungs and histological examination showed confluent, non-necrotizing, epithelioid granulomas with the presence of Langhans' multinucleated giant cells. Acid-fast bacilli were detected both within the anal lesion and in the sputum. Mantoux test was positive. The patient had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis 40 years ago. A diagnosis of anal tuberculosis was made and the patient was put on a four drug anti-tuberculous regimen. In 6 months the symptoms improved and the perianal lesion healed. Conclusion: A tuberculous origin must be considered when the cause of anal and perianal lesions is unclear. Therefore histological and bacteriological confirmation is essential in order to avoid undue delay in diagnosis and treatment.",

The present study aims to prove reliability of this promising technique for colon biopsy diagnostics. Method: Colon biopsies (n=295) were assessed (into 7 main diagnostic groups) using both glass slides and WSIs by 4 pathologists and 2 residents. Two of the pathologists having ample experience using WSIs, scored the biopsies in a primary diagnostic setting. For each case the criterion standard diagnosis was defined based on glass slide diagnoses. Accuracy was defined as the percentage of concordance with the criterion standard. Kappa statistics were calculated as a measure of observer agreement. Results: The overall concordance rates were 89.5 % for WSIs and 91.4 % for conventional microscopy. The intraobserver (WSIs versus glass slides) agreement was good to excellent, with kappa values ranging from 0.73 to 0.87 (mean 0.78) and was higher than the interobserver agreement for glass slides (mean 0.71). Concordance with the criterion standard varied less between WSIs and glass slides in the diagnoses of pathologists with virtual experience.

Lipomas of the colon were first reported by Bauer in 1757 and are most often located in the ascending colon. The incidence of this lesion is estimated between 0.2 and 4.4 % and represents 1.8 % of the colonic benign lesions. We report a case of patient with symptoms of ileus due to colonic lipoma. Method: A 78-year-old man patient was urgently admitted with symptoms of ileus. Right hemicolectomy was performed, and clinical impression was that it was a malignant tumor. Results: Examination of the cecum we found polypoid whitish yellow tumor, size 4\u00d72,5 cm. On histology the tumor was composed of mature adipose tissue without cellular atypia. The tumor was located into submucosa. Larger parts of the surface mucosa was eroded. The postoperative course was uneventful and intestinal passage was quickly established. Conclusion: Although colonic lipomas seldom cause severe symptoms in patients and are easily removed by endoscope while they are small, severe symptoms like abdominal fullness, intestinal obstruction, intestinal bleeding and intussusceptions may appear as a lipoma grows larger.

Zlobec * , E. Karamitopoulou, L. Terracciano, D. Inderbitzin, A. Lugli * University of Berne, Inst. of Pathology, Bern, Switzerland Objective: We compare the prognostic strength of the lymph node ratio (LNR), positive lymph nodes (+LNs) and collected lymph nodes (LNcoll) using a time-dependent analysis in colorectal cancer patients stratified by mismatch repair (MMR) status. Method: 580 stage III-IV patients were included. Multivariable Cox regression analysis and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (tROC) curve analysis were performed. The Area under the Curve (AUC) over time was compared for the three features. Results were validated on a second cohort of 105 stage III-IV patients. Results: The AUC for the LNR was 0.71 and outperformed + LNs and LNcoll by 10-15 % in both MMR-proficient and -deficient cancers. LNR and + LNs were both significant (p <0.0001) in multivariable analysis but the effect was considerably stronger for the LNR [LNR: HR=5.18 (95 % CI: 3.5-7.6); +LNs=1.06 (95 % CI: 1.04-1.08)]. Similar results were obtained for patients with >12 LNcoll. An optimal cutoff score for LNR = 0.231 was validated on the second cohort (p<0.001). Conclusion: The LNR outperforms the + LNs and LNcoll even in patients with >12 LNcoll. Its clinical value is not confounded by MMR status. A cut-of score of 0.231 may best stratify patients into prognostic subgroups and could be a basis for the future prospective analysis of the LNR.",

In a multivariate Cox regression analysis the TSR remained an independent prognostic factor for overall survival, when adjusted for age, pT-status and grading. Conclusion: TSR as a prognostic tumor characteristic can be used to identify patients with a good and a poor outcome in lymph node metastasis negative cases. Objective: Goblet cell carcinoid (GCC) of appendix vermiformis is a rare neoplasm that share histological features of both adenocarcinoma and carcinoid tumor. While its malignant potential remains unclear, GCC's particularly show transmural dissemination and are more aggressive than conventional carcinoids. Patients usually present with acute appendicitis. They usually lack the formation of a well-defined tumor mass; thus, it is somewhat difficult to accurately assess their size. Method: Case Presentation: Fifty years old male patient applied to the emergency service with abdominal pain and laparatomy was performed with suspicion of acute appendicitis. Grossly, conjestion and exudation on the distal edge of appendectomy material were seen. A 1\u00d71 cm lesion which was spreading into peripheral adipose tissue was seen on the cut surface. Microscopically, tumor was composed of goblet cell groups resembling \"signet ring cells\". Tumor was infiltrated into muscularis propria and mesoappendix. Immunohistochemically, chromogranin, synaptophysin, cytokeratin 20, mCEA and p53 were stained positive. Ki67 (MIB 1) proliferation index was 18 %. Conclusion: Adenocarcinoid of the appendix is a rare tumor, which is very difficult to diagnose preoperatively and even macroscopically, making histological examination essential. Immunohistochemical staining is required for definitive and differential diagnosis. Here, we present this rare case with literature reviewed.",

Ben-Izhak * Rambam Health Care Campus, Dept. of Pathology, Haifa, Israel Objective: Heparanase, the sole heparan sulfate degrading enzyme, has a role in cellular invasion. Accordingly, a large number of studies have demonstrated an association between heparanse expression and tumor stage and patients' prognosis. In colon carcinoma, heparanase shows increased expression in tumor compared to normal tissue and its expression correlates with the presence of metastasis. One of the regulatory mechanisms of heparanase expression is methylation on its promoter. In the present study we evaluated the role of heparanse promoter methylation in colon carcinoma. Method: Analysis of heparanse promoter methylation was done on 32 samples of colon carcinoma as well as 30 sample of normal colonic mucosa. DNA was extracted from FFPE tissue and subjected to bisulfite conversion. The relative fraction of methylated and unmethylated DNA was evaluated with real-time PCR. Results: The fraction of methylated DNA was 1 %\u00b10.6 in the colon carcinoma group, and 2.4 %\u00b10.6 in the normal colon group (P=0.11). Only one case in the normal group and one case in the tumor group showed more than 10 % methylation in the heparanase promoter. Conclusion: We did not find any difference in heparanase promoter methylation between colon carcinoma and normal colonic mucosa, suggesting that heparanase overexpression in colon carcinoma is mediated by other mechanisms. Objective: Among B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, neural cell adhesion molecule/CD56 expression is exceptional. The aim of this study is to report unusual CD56 (neural cell adhesion molecule, NCAM) expression on diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Method: The panel of antibodies included CD3, CD20, CD10, bcl-2, bcl-6, MUM-1 and CD56. Results: A total of 50 cases of DLBCL were identified and one case was also detected positive for CD56. The subject was female, 48 years old. The patient had presented generalized lymphadenopathy. She had not documented involvement of extranodal sites. The case is alive with disease 1 year after diagnosis and chemotherapy treatment. Objective: A case of mediastinal T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma with indolent clinical course in a 52-yearold man was studied by immunohistology and molecular biology. Method: Formalin-fixed sample. Histology with Ematox-ilin&Eosin and Giemsa; immunohistochemistry by APAAP method. T-cell receptor gamma rearrangement by BIOMED2 protocols. Results: After one fainting episode the patient was found to have pericarditis caused by a XX-cm-diameter mediastinal mass. The 2 first biopsies were unsuccessful and the third diagnostic one was done 6 months later. In this time-period the patient was well without symptoms and the mass stable. After two mediastinal biopsies with unspecific features (Castleman disease?), the diagnostic one showed fibrosis, abundant small reactive lymphocytes (CD20+/CD3+) and areas with diffuse small-medium size lymphocytes positive for CD3, TdT, CD34, CD7, LMO2 and high Ki67. T-cell receptor gamma genes were monoclonally rearranged. Conclusion: Indolent T-LBL is exceedingly rare: for this reason in our case LMO2 was a key marker for the diagnosis which was delayed for the presence of fibrosis and reactive B cells. Objective: Granulocytic sarcoma (GS), also termed myeloid sarcoma or chloroma, is a rare malignant solid tumor resulting from the extramedullary proliferation of myeloblasts or immature myeloid cells. GS most frequently occurs in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, myeloproliferative neoplasms or myelodysplasia. GS rarely presents in the absence of systemic myeloid disease. GS most commonly occurs in the soft tissues of the head and neck, bone, skin and less often in the central nervous system and spinal cord. Results: A 40 year old woman presented with 1 month history of weakness of both legs. MRI of the thoracal spine showed 4 cm diameter epidural mass compressing the dural sac in the spinal canal at the T9-10 levels. Decompressive laminectomy and tumor removal were performed resulting in neurological improvement. Histologically neoplastic cells have round nuclei with finely dispersed chromatin and scant cytoplasm proliferating in a diffuse pattern. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were positive for MPO, CD117, CD45, CD99. Diagnosis was GS without bone marrow involvement. Conclusion: We report the case of GS due to unusual localization and nonleukemic presentation. Results: There were 5 males and 1 female with a median age of 40 years (22-79 years). Physical examination shows splenomegaly in all cases and hepatomegaly in 2 cases, hematological parameters shows lymphocytosis with peripheral hairy cells in all cases. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping was done in 2 cases, and confirmed the diagnosis of HCL with CD11c, CD25+, CD103+, CD123 +, and CD5-, CD10-, and CD23-. Bone marrow biopsy was done in all cases, showing massive infiltration with villous cytoplasmic projection cells that were CD20 positive. The treatment consists of blood transfusion in all cases, associated with splenectomy in 3 cases, only 1 patient was treated with (2 CDA: cladribine) with a complete remission after a follow up of 24 months. Conclusion: HCL has consistent cytologic histologic and immunologic features that make classification reliable and reproducible; it remains problematic because of the variety of the disorders and the differential diagnosis of splenic lymphoma of the marginal zone. Objective: Primary CNS lymphomas (PCNSL) are uncommon tumors in immunocompetent patients, they represent up to 1 % of non Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and 3-5 % of all brain tumors. The majority of PCNSL are diffuse large B cell lymphomas, 2-5 % are T cell lymphomas, in rare instances low grade B cell lymphomas. We determine clinical characteristics, histological findings and treatment outcome of PCNSL. Method: Five cases of PCNSL occurring between 1993 and 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: They were 4 males, 1 female, median age 50 years, range (23-74). Most common symptom was neurological deficits (4cases). MRI of the brain revealed an expansive tumor affecting the parietal bone in 3 cases, the temporal bone in 1 cases and the frontal bone in 1 case. Immunohistological finding showed large B-cell NHL in 2 cases, anaplastic lymphoma in 2 cases, and large-cell immunoblastic lymphoma in 1 case. Treatment consists on exclusive tumoral resection in 3 cases, surgery and chemotherapy (1 case), complicated by death in all these cases. Surgery followed by high dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy (1 case) with complete remission after a follow-up of 7 years. Conclusion: Chemotherapy followed by involved field irradiation appears to be an adapted therapy. Objective: Primary cutaneous non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (PCNHL) is defined as lymphoma limited to skin without extra-cutaneous involvement at presentation. We describe here epidemiological and histo-pathological aspects of PCNHL.",

Results: Fourty three patients with PCNHL, median age: 48 years (11-84), sex-ratio was 2.3. The site of cutaneous involvement was upper lumb in 4 cases, lower lumb in 7 cases and disseminated in 23 cases. PCNHL was small T cell lymphoma in 13 cases, large B cell lymphoma in 16 cases, anaplastic, CD4+ CD56+ hematodermic neoplasm, and follicular type in 1 case respectively. According to TNM classification 21 cases were T3bNxMx, 12 cases were T1N0M0. After first line therapy, 26 patients in CR, PR was obtained in 1 case and failure in 6 cases, 10 patients relapsed within 1 to 72 months (median 6 months), all of them were disseminated cases. Conclusion: Our study indicate that the extend of cutaneous involvement at the time of diagnosis is a significant prognostic factor in PCNHL. Objective: Follicular lymphomas (FLs) account for one third of non Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) in adults. The disease is characterized by a response to initial treatment, followed by relapses, sometimes associated with histologic transformation into high grade NHL. Analyze epidemiological characteristics of patients with FL. Method: Retrospective study of 22 of adult FLs diagnosed in Hematology Department (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) . Results: Median age was 59 years (29-77), sex-ratio: 1.7 The most frequent clinical symptom at diagnosis was lymphadenopathy in 13 cases. Involvement of the spleen in 3 cases. B symptoms were present in 10 cases. Performance status was more than 1 in 4 cases. According to the international prognostic index (FLIPI), 7 patients have low index, 5 have intermediate index, and 10 have high index. Grade 2 FL was seen in the majority of cases. Treatment modalities varied over time and according to the disponibility of drugs especially to anti CD20 monoclonal antibody. CR was obtained in 13 cases, PR in 6 cases; 3patients relapsed within 8-48 months. Histologic transformation was seen in 3 cases, we have noted 10 deaths related to the disease in 7 cases. Conclusion: Treatment results in FL might not only be improved by more effective induction regimens but also by maintenance treatment. Objective: CD99 and FLI-1 are widely used for their diagnostic utility in Ewing sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumor (ES/PNET). CD99 expression has been documented in a variety of tumors, including lymphoid malignancies of T cell origin. Also FLI-1 expression is common in different tumor types. However, few studies have investigated the CD99 and FLI-1 immunoreactivity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We aimed to determine the frequencies of CD99 and FLI-1 immunohistochemical expressions in DLBCL which may lead to a misdiagnosis. Method: CD99 and FLI-1 expressions are retrospectively investigated by immunoperoxidase staining in prechemoterapy primary tumors of 42 DLBCL cases.",

The presence of a monotypical light chain B cell population supports the diagnosis of PCMZL. We describe a case of PCMZL which showed different light chain restriction in two heterochronous lesions. Method: \u0391 50 year-old male patient presented in 2004 with a cutaneous nodule in the anterior surface of the tibia, which was totally excised. The patient did not show other lesions since 2011, when a new cutaneous nodule located in the right ankle, was appeared. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed in both biopsies. Results: Histological and immunohistochemical findings of both biopsies were consistent with marginal zone lymphoma of the skin with lambda light chain restriction in the biopsy of the first lesion and kappa light chain restriction in the biopsy of the second lesion. Blood laboratory studies, chest and abdominal computerized tomography scans revealed no evidence of systemic involvement by lymphoma. Conclusion: The finding of both kappa and lamda light chain restricted B cell populations in PCMZL is unusual. The monoclonal light chain switching in PCMZL is rare and its pathogenesis is discussed. Objective: Microvessel density (MVD) has prognostic significance in some malignancies. Little information exists about angiogenesis in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), although antiangiogenic drugs are used experimentally. Prognostic factors of MCL are needed as outcome and therapy are heterogeneous and often unsatisfactory. The aim is to assess MVD in MCL and to evaluate its prognostic significance. Method: 177 MCL specimens (FFPE) were examined by immunohistochemistry with anti-CD34 antibody. MVD was quantified using systematic uniform random sampling and unbiased counting frames. Clinical data were analyzed in Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank test. Results: Median survival (MS) of all patients was 46 months, median progression-free survival (MPFS) 22 months. Mean MVD was 172,7 microvessels/mm2, median 158,2/mm2. Dividing cases into quartiles: <117,4/mm2, <158,2/mm2, <206,6/mm2 and \u2265206,6/mm2 (43, 44, 45, 45 cases), MS and MPFS did not differ statistically significantly between these groups (P=0,307; similar for therapy groups). Visible differences are only between the fourth quartile and the rest: Objective: Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is a rare aggressive subtype of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma which occurs primarily in the oral cavity of HIV-positive patients. It is extremely rare in immunocompetent patients. Method: A total of 5 cases of PB were retrospectively analyzed. All cases had tissue available for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Results: The age range of the 5 patients was 35-81 years (median 68) and all were men. Three patients were HIV negative. HIV + patients: tumors involved the oral cavity (n =1), and small intestine (n=1). HIV-patients: tumors were located in bone marrow (n=1) and lymph nodes (n=2). All tumors were composed of monomorphic plasmablastic cells. Tumors were negative for CD45 and CD20, while they showed diffuse positivity for CD138, CD38, MUM1 and EMA. By ISH, monoclonal light chain restriction was detected. EBV (EBER) was positive in all cases. The median overall survival was 21,4 months regardless of the intensity of chemotherapy. Only one patient is alive 1 month after diagnosis. Conclusion: PBL may appear in non immunocompromised patients and other locations than oral cavity. Any patient diagnosed with PBL should be tested for HIV. Patients who had HIV-negative PBL have lower rates of oral involvement.",

Results: Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a tumor in lumbal spine (L1-L3). Baseline laboratory data were normal. He underwent emergent laminectomy and the tumor was totaly resected. Histological examination of lesion demonstrated diffuse proliferation of large atypical cells with round nuclei with delicate chromatin and one or more prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemical studies revealed positive staining for LCA, CD33, CD43, CD163, Lysozyme and CD15 while myeloperoxidase, lymphoid, neuroendocrine markers, S-100 and CD99 were negative. The final histological diagnosis was granulocitic (monoblastic) sarcoma. No chromosomal aberrations were detected by FISH. A month later, acute myelomonocytic leukemia was diagnosed upon a peripheral blood and bone marrow examination showing an increased number of abnormal monoblasts. Chemotherapy, with multiple regimens for leukemia in combination, did not affect the tumor and the patient died. Conclusion: Granulocytic sarcoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of spinal tumors. Objective: Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis family might play an important role in the pathogenesis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We investigate clinical and prognostic significance of survivin expression in nodal DLBCL. Method: Biopsy specimens obtained from 56 patients with newly diagnosed nodal DLBCL treated with immunochemotherapy (R-CHOP) were immunostained for survivin. Results: Survivin immunoexpression (>45 % positive tumor cells) has been found in 22 (39.28 %) patients. Significant difference in immunoexpression was noticed between GCB and non-GCB subtype of DLBCL (p=0.031). There was no significant association with IPI, \"bulky\"disease, Ki-67 immunoexpression or other clinico-pathological parameters. Univariate analysis showed that survivin expression was unfavorable factor for therapy response and shorter survival in patients with DLBCL (p=0.048 and p=0.034, respectively). Patients with survivin overexpression experienced relapse more often that the patients without expression of this apoptotic protein (27.3 % vs. 11.8 %), but this difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.131).",

Objective: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) frequently presents eosinophilic infiltration. Here we report ten cases of LCH that involved the jaws and our investigation of the mechanism underlying eosinophilic infiltration in LCH. Method: We evaluated the CCL-11/eotaxin-1 expression of LCH cells via immunohistochemical staining. Toluidine blue staining was used to inspect the densities of mast cells, with ten periapical granuloma specimens serving as a control group. Results: Every patient was classified as having single-system LCH, even though acute lymphoblastic leukemia occurred in one patient during LCH treatment. The ratio of mandible to maxilla LCH was 5:1. The jaw lesions were the earliest manifestation in seven patients with multifocal LCH. Toluidine blue staining revealed that the number of mast cells in LCH lesions was not significantly higher than in periapical granulomas. However, upon immunohistochemical examination, most of the patients showed diffuse positivity for eotaxin-1 in LCH cells, while few eosinophils/ T cells were immunoreactive. Conclusion: We surmise that the eotaxin-1 expression of LCH cells may be relevant to eosinophilic infiltration in LCH. Further studies of the eotaxin-1 functions including its influence on the immature state of LCH cells may be needed to understand the pathogenesis of LCH as well as the role of tissue eosinophilia in LCH. Method: We report a case of SANT in 53 years-old man presented with abdominal discomfort and pain in a left lumbal region. Abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a massive haematoma extended from spleen to the enlarged left kidney and left retroperitoneal space. The patient also had a spontaneous rupture of right kidney 2 years ago. Results: Macroscopically, the cut surface of spleen showed multiple well circumscribed red brown nodules. Microscopically, SANT consists of multiple well-circumscribed angiomatoid nodules showing plump endothelial cells and extravasated erythrocytes. Nodular formations are surrounded by a variable lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, spindle cells and collagenous stroma. Immunohistochemical staining displayed endothelial phenotype that resembled splenic capillaries (CD34+/CD31+/CD8\u2212). Expression of CD68 was also present. Conclusion: The differential diagnosis of SANT includes splenic hamartoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, littoral cell angioma and hemangioendothelioma. It has been postulated that SANT represents a peculiar hamartomatous transformation of splenic red pulp in response to an exaggerated nonneoplastic stromal proliferation. SANT has a benign clinical course and splenectomy has been supposed as curative.",

The role of angiogenesis in cHL is still unclear. The aim of the study was to evaluate the expression of VEGF-A, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 and their correlation with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis. Method: The immunohistochemical expression of VEGF-A (VG1, Dako), VEGFR-1 (RB-9049, Neomarkers) and VEGFR-2 (sc-6251, Santa Cruz) was studied in a large cohort of 199 patients with cHL and the results were correlated with clinical characteristics and patient outcome. Results: The neoplastic HRS cells expressed VEGF-A, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 in 90.3 %, 97.2 % and 94.1 % of the cases respectively and their expression levels were intercorrelated. Expression of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 was significantly and positively correlated with early disease stage, absence of B-symptoms, WBC <15.000, Alb \u22654, IPS \u22642. VEGFR-2 was additionally positively correlated with male gender and ESR <50. All three molecules were statistically correlated with ramifications of blood vessels but not with microvessel density. Conclusion: Based on our results, we could speculate that, in contrast to solid tumours, the process of angiogenesis is probably an early event in neoplastic progression in the context of Hodgkin's Lymphoma.",

Method: We describe a 52 years old man, who had been diagnosed as marginal zone lymphoma in a cervical lymph node biopsy 3 years previously.No endoscopic examination was evaluated then. There was no pathological appearance in the gastrointestinal system by CT scanning and patient was considered nodal marginal zone lymphoma. Patient had taken 8 cycles of chemotherapy which consisted of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone.2,5 years after completion of chemotherapy, a gastric wall thickening compatible with gastric lymphoma or linitis plastica was detected on CT and gastroscopic examination was indicated. Endoscopic examination revealed an erosive, fragile, hemorrhagic, malignant-looking lesion with a diameter of 4.5 cm in the cardia. Besides, rugae of fundus and corpus were severely rough and hyperemic suggesting a diffuse malignant infiltration. Multiple biopsies were taken from cardia, fundus and corpus of the stomach. Results: Cardiac samples showed pancytokeratin positive signet ring cells which contain neutral and acidic mucine in microscopic examination. Samples of corpus and fundus did not show similar carcinoma cells, instead, there was diffuse infiltration of atipical lymphocytic infiltration consistent with marginal cell lymphoma both morphologically and immunophenotypically.

Beyond diagnostic importance of Immunohistochemistry, so far many studies have investigated the correlation between cellular markers and the prognosis of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.

Clinical and laboratory Data and Immunohistochemistry findings analyzed for possible correlation between disease stage and other parameters. Results: In our study 63.6 %, 90.9 % of cases respectively expressed cellular markers CD15 and CD30 while only 18.2 % of cases expressed CD20. Furthermore statistical analysis revealed that CD15 was inversely correlated with disease staging. (P=0.027). In contrast we didn't find any relation between CD20 or CD30 positivity with disease staging. (P=0.482, P= 0.376). However in our study expression of CD20 was not related to stage or other parameters of poor prognosis which proposes that in our patients this marker possibly was not related to disease prognosis. Conclusion: Therefore we suggest that cellular marker CD20 is not beneficial beyond IPS factors and its usage should be confined to diagnostic purposes.",

Method: We present the case of a 54-year-old man, heavy smoker, with dispnea, cough, hemoptyses, headache and ataxia, who died shortly after admission to our hospital. On the autopsy, we found tumor in the posterior segment of the right upper pulmonary lobe as well as a right-sided occipito-parietal lesion which penetrated into the right ventricle resulting in internal and external hematocephalus. Histologically and immunohistohemically, the diagnosis of primary lung adenocarcinoma with brain metastasis was made (tumor cells showed positivity for CK 7 and TTF-1 which confirmed the diagnosis).

We have taken a cutaneous and an axillary lymph node biopsy. Results: Microscopic examination of the cutaneous fragment revealed the presence of a dermal infiltrate of large cells with an eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular, nucleolated nuclei with an irregular nuclear margin, raising suspicion of a cutaneous lymphoma. Immunohistochemical stains for CD45, CD20, CD79a, CD3, CD5, CD15, CD30, and Bcl-2 were negative, and the previous diagnosis was not confirmed. The microscopic examination of the axillary lymph nodes showed foci of extramedullary hematopoiesis, raising suspicion of a lymphoproliferative process, but the immunohistochemical stains and the paraclinical data didn't confirm it. Based on the intense positive reaction for CD68, S100 and Ki-67 showed by the tumoral cells from the prelevated tissues, correlated with the clinical and paraclinical findings, a diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis was established.

Laboratory data showed elevated white blood cell count (40.000/mm3) with small mature lymphocytes predominance (60 %). Results: Histopathologic examination of the skin lesion reveals infiltration of the reticular dermis and subcutis, consisting mostly of small lymphoid cells, without epidermotropism.

Every site of the body can be involved, skin, lymph node, gastrointestinal tract, bone, soft tissue and testis. %10 cases presents at multiple anatomical sites. Method: The current case is 75 year old woman presenting with nasal polyp and underwent polypectomy. The polyp was 2,5 cm in diameter and had a bloody appearance. By microscopic examination there was a diffuse infiltration of neoplastic cells under the cilliated epithelium. The mitotic index was high in neoplastic lymhoid cells. Immunohistochemical study was helpful for the differential diagnosis. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology and anatomo-clinical features of the ear, nose and throat (ENT) lymphomas in the Centre of Tunisia. Method: All ENT lymphoma cases diagnosed in the Pathology Department, Farhet Hached Hospital, Sousse during a 15-year period were analyzed. Results: A total of 34 cases of ENT lymphoma were reported (21 males, 13 females) with a sex-ratio of 1.4. The age at diagnosis varied from 9 to 85 years with a median age of 56.5 years. The majority of ENT lymphoma cases (81 %) were of B cell type including large B-cell lymphoma (58 %) and small-cell B lymphoma (23 %). Nasopharynx and tonsils were the most involved areas with 44 % and 42 % of cases, respectively. According to the Ann Arbor staging system, these lymphomas are diagnosed in the stage II (42 %) followed by stage I (30 %). Conclusion: The most frequent lymphoma developed in ENT region was B cell lymphoma, especially located in nasopharynx and Tonsils. Results: A total of 44 cases were reported (26 males, 18 females) with a sex-ratio of 1.4. The median age was 10 years (range: 3-15 years). Lymph node lymphomas were the most frequent accounting for 63.6 %, followed by ENT, mediastinum, and haematopoietic system (6.8 % each one); cutaneous and digestive location were less frequent (4.5 % each one). Among the 44 patients, 23 (52.3 %) had had Hodgkin's lymphoma and 21 (47.7 %) had had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was the most diagnosed (57 %) followed by Burkitt lymphoma (23.8 %) and T-cell lymphoma (9.5 %). According to the Ann Arbor staging system, 29.6 % of patients were diagnosed in an advanced stage. Method: We present a case of composite AILT and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) A 45-year-old woman with multiples lymph nodes. Biopsy of inguinal node was performed. Three months later the patient had enlarged cervical node which was removed. Results: Firstly, the inguinal lymph node was diffusely infiltrated by small-medium size lymphocytes with scanty cytoplasm. The nuclei were irregular. Several large cells were observed in a background of prominent arborizing high endothelial venules. The small cells were CD3 positive. The large cells were CD79a, CD30 positive. Theses cells showed nuclear positivity for EBER by ISH. Secondly, the cervical lymph node showed large areas of necrosis admixed with pleomorphic and medium size T lymphocytes. There were a population of neoplastic EBV + pleomorphic B lymphocytes; some of them with RS-like morphology. We performed B and T-cell clonality studies. We detected TCR-gamma T-cell and IgH B-cell gene clonal rearrangement. Conclusion: Occasionally IgH gene rearrangement has been detected but only a few cases have demonstrated, morphologically, composite AILT and EBV-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).",

Reports in the literature documenting leukemic infiltration of appendix are uncommon and extremely rare when symptoms mimicking typhlitis. Method: A 30-year-old man with a history of relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia (FAB classification, M2) admitted for receiving induction chemotherapy. After 10 days of chemotherapy, he presented with fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and severe neutropenia (0.026\u00d7109/L as absolute neutrophil count). This manifestation was attributed to typhlitis and he received antibiotic therapy, but he came back 50 days later with acute abdomen prompting exploratory laparotomy which revealed inflamed appendix. Results: Histologic examination showed diffuse appendiceal wall infiltration of mononuclear cells with medium-to-large vesicular nuclei, conspicuous nucleoli and pale eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunostains showed the diagnosis of granulocytic sarcoma with myeloperoxidase, leukocyte common antigen, CD15, CD117 and CD68 positivity and epithelial membrane antigen, keratin, CD3, CD5, CD10, CD79a and CD20 negativity. Conclusion: Our case declares that physicians and surgeons should be aware of granulocytic sarcoma in the differential diagnosis of mild tenderness on palpation of the abdomen as a complication of acute myelogenous leukemia. Objective: Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), one of the most frequent entities among peripheral T-cell lymphoma, is characterized by lymphadenopathy, B-symptoms, and an aggressive behaviour. Method: We reported 3 cases of AITL during a period of 4 years (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) . Results: The age of patients varied between 20 and 73 yearold. They hadn't any pathologic history. Two patients presented with a multiple cervical lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. The other patient had fever and sweat. Physical examination found multiple lymph nodes with hepatosplenomegaly in 2 patients. Abdominal ultrasound and CT-scan showed diffuse lymphadenopathy with features raising the possibility of lymphoma. The diagnosis of AITL was confirmed by a microscopic and an immunhistochemical study of lymph node or liver biopsy. 2 patients received a cure of chemotherapy Conclusion: Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin T-cell lymphoma. AITL is frequently associated to immunological and hematologic diseases such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune thyroid disease. Its natural history has been the subject of controversy, considered for many years to be a nonmalignant disorder or a dysimmune disease, until the clonal nature of AITL was proven by molecular studies. Although patients are usually treated with corticosteroids, chemotherapy, and/or plasmapheresis, outcomes were dismal. Objective: Low grade lymphomas (indolent) are commonly located on extranodal sites. nodal location are relatively of low incidence. Our aim is to describe the epidemiological status of NBCL and to assess their pathological features in the center of Tunisia. Method: We report 50 cases of indolent NBCL diagnosed in the department of pathology, during a period of 10 years (2000-2009) . Clinical, pathological and immunohistochemical (large panel of antibodies), treatment and outcome data are collected. Results: The mean age was 63 year old (33 and 89 years). The sex ratio was 1.27. NBCL was 6.5 % of all N H lymphomas and 42.73 % of indolent NBCL of any sites. Nodal enlargement and hepatomegaly were the main symptoms. Small Lymphocytic lymphomas were the most frequent variant (56 %), followed by follicular lymphomas (26 %). Mantle cell lymphoma and marginal zone B cell lymphoma were rare (12 % and 6 %, respectively). They were exclusively of B cell type. 76 % of cases were in stage III-IV. 90 % of patients received chemotherapy. 2 % of recurrence and 48 % of death were found. Conclusion: NBCL in the center of Tunisia are relatively uncommon. Small lymphocytic lymphoma is the most frequent in our population. They are still of relatively worse prognosis. Objective: Bone marrow metastases can be found in some malignant tumors, but diagnosing a nonhematologic malignancy from marrow is an unusual event. Herein we present a case of metastatic signet ring cell carcinoma with an unknown primary site. Method: A 39 year-old woman admitted to the Hospital with weakness and bone pain. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) revealed disseminated bone lesions showing increased metabolic activity. Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration were performed. Results: Bone marrow biopsy revealed extensive necrosis and nearly total replacement of normal bone marrow elements by atypical tumoral cells. Tumoral cells were arranged individually or in small clusters, having hyperchromatic, eccentric located nuclei and abundant cytoplasm with signet ring cell morphology. Even after thourough investigation of all the systems, a primary site of malignancy could not be detected. She received nine cycles of chemotherapy. Craial MRI revealed multiple metastatic lesions. 9 months after the initial diagnosis, she died of disseminated metastatic lesions. Conclusion: Even after thorough investigations, a primary site of malignancy could not be detected. In the literature, all the presented cases had very short survival varying from days to a few months. Our patient lived for 9 months with multidiciplinary approach. Objective: Approximately 20 % of follicular lymphomas (FLs) are bcl2 negative and 10-15 % of FLs lack a translocation t(14;18). Previously we have found that negative bcl2 staining in cases that do have a t(14;18) is caused by mutations in the epitope for the bcl-2 antibody, but this is never the case in bcl-2 negative, t (14;18) negative cases. Now that translocation detection is more commonly performed we noticed that many of the cases that were referred to us as translocation negative FL are actually often nodal marginal zone lymphomas (NMZLs) with extensive follicular colonization. Method: t(14;18) negative cases that on H&E sections look like FL were analyzed by morphology and immunohistochemistry, including antibodies against CD10, bcl-2, Ki-67, and CD23. Results: Careful observation of the bcl-2 staining pattern revealed that follicles that appeared positive at low power contained negative cells at high magnification. The amount of negative cells varied from follicle to follicle and was associated with the extent of Ki-67 positivity. Conclusion: Based on morphology and immunohistochemistry we reclassified many cases of bcl-2 positive, t(14;18) negative FL into NMZL. Although there is presently no positive marker for NMZL, we believe that such cases are responsible for most t(14;18) negative FL. Objective: Recent studies do not provide a definite answer on the origin and pathogenesis of lichen planus (LP). Histologic findings are the same, regardless of the area involved. Electron microscopy is useful to confirm the diagnosis in atypical cases and monitoring LP development. This study aimed an ultrastructural characterization of keratinocyte degeneration in pemphigoides, hypertrophic, and follicular LP types correlating this with levels of gelatinolytic activity caused by metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9).",

Results: LP pemphigoides demonstrated intact basal keratinocyte cell membrane, and the lamina densa lining blister cavity correlating with moderate basal MMP-9 expression of weak intensity. Hypertrophic type demonstrated good preservation of keratinocytes and their junctions along with strong basal and suprabasal MMP-9 expression of moderate intensity. Both types demonstrated diffuse and strong MMP-9 immunostaining in dermal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate. A hypertrophic type revealed an increase of expression within dermal sweat glands comparing with LP pemphigoides. A diffuse and strong epidermal and follicular MMP-9 staining was noticed in follicular variant of LP. Conclusion: Ultrastructurally keratinocyte involvement displays deviations in various types of LP, and these changes correlate with levels of gelatinolytic activity caused by MMP-9. Objective: Clevudine is a recently introduced anti-viral agent that shows efficacy against hepatitis B virus related chronic liver diseases. However, it has been reported that certain patients who have received long-term administration of clevudine exhibit myopathy involving mitochondrial abnormalities. To make a differential diagnosis congenital mitochondrial myopathy and drug induced mitochondrial myopathy, we investigate ultrastructural findings of drug induced myopathy. Method: We studied histopathological features of myopathy focused on the various ultrastructural mitochondrial abnormalities found in 18 patients with long-term clevudine therapy. Results: In every case, ragged red fibers and multinucleated fibers with eosinophilic granules were observed. Additionally, type 2 fiber atrophy was found in 6 cases. Mainly concentrated in subsarcolemmal or inter-fibrillar areas, the abnormal mitochondria were enlarged and swollen, showing a variety of morphological types. Most of the abnormal mitochondria indicated structural abnormalities in cristae, including the apparent decrease in the number, concentric lamellar pattern, and structure that is branched or lattice-like. Conclusion: From the overall analysis, clevudine-induced myopathy is characterized by ragged fibers showing proliferation of abnormal mitochondria with various forms of inclusion bodies and abnormal cristae. Another particular feature of interest is the presence of multinucleated fibers, which, in most cases, are filled with abnormal mitochondria.",

Our aims were to evaluate and compare the ultrastructure of human mature oocytes frozenthawed (F/T) after slow freezing and vitrification. Method: The oocytes, fixed at sampling (fresh controls) and after freeze/thawing, were processed for light and transmission electron microscopy (LM and TEM) observations. Results: By LM, both fresh and F/T oocytes were rounded cells surrounded by an intact zona pellucida (ZP) and containing uniformly distributed organelles. By TEM, numerous vacuoles were found in F/T oocytes after slow freezing. On the contrary, vacuoles were only occasionally detected in F/T oocytes after vitrification, and in fresh controls as well. Amount and density of cortical granules (CGs) appeared abnormally reduced in F/T oocytes, irrespective of the protocol applied. Conclusion: In conclusion, a) cryopreservation currently ensures a good overall preservation of the oocyte; b) however, vacuolization appears as a recurrent form of cell damage during slow freezing, whereas the quasi absence of vacuoles seems the most relevant marker of quality in vitrified oocytes; c) premature CG exocytosis -and the consequent hardening of the ZP -seems a non-specific, ubiquitous phenomenon occurring during freeze/thawing, suggesting the appropriateness of the use of ICSI as the preferred insemination method after cryopreservation.",

Heterotopic pancreas is extremely rare in the gallbladder. Despite being a congenital condition, it takes years to become symptomatic. It can be associated with cholecystitis or cholecystolithiasis. Method: A 21-year-old female patient was admitted to emergency service with abdominal pain. On physical examination, right upper abdomen was tender without defense or rebound. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed small sized gallstones and pericholecystic fluid. Magnetic resonance cholangiography showed dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. Results: Cholecystectomy specimen was 75\u00d735\u00d730 mm. On gross examination we noted a few milimetric yellow colored stones and 12 mm yellow solid intramural nodule. The mucosa was covered with fibrinopurulent exudate. Microscopic examination revealed acute cholecystitis and aberrant pancreatic tissue consisting of acini and ductules. The phlegmonous inflammation of the gallbladder infiltrated the aberrant pancreatic tissue. The patient recovered completely after cholecystectomy. Conclusion: We found this case worth reporting because, pancreatic heterotopia of the gallbladder is a rare, clinically silent entity unless complicated with gallstones and acute cholecystitis.",

            "text": "Objective: Hepatic angiomyolipomas are rare mesenchymal hepatic tumour. The most important problem about their diagnosis on biopsy specimens is to exclude a hepatocellular carcinoma. Method: We present two cases of hepatic angiomyolipoma diagnosed in Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest. Both females patients, 39 and 43 years old, were imagistically diagnosed with a 13 cm hepatic left lobe tumor in the first patient, respectively a 10.5 cm hepatic right lobe tumor in the second one. Both tumors were echo guided biopsied. The biopsy specimens measured about 8 mm, respectively 20 mm. The tumors were surgical removed. The biopsy and resection specimens were analyzed in light microscopy, including immunohistochemistry. Results: Initial diagnosis on HE stain was cell variant hepatocellular carcinoma, in the 8 mm biopsy, respectively suspicious for angiomyolipoma in the second case. Further immunohistochemical studies showed positivity for Vimentin, HMB45, MELAN A, S100 and actin, and negativity for OCH1E5, CK7, CK8/18, CEA, CD34, Ki67 and Factor VIII in both biopsy specimens, consistent with hepatic angiomyolipoma diagnosis, confirmed on surgical specimens too. Conclusion: Diagnosing a hepatic angiomyolipoma is not easy to do especially on a biopsy. The size of biopsy specimens plays a very important role in a correct diagnosis. Results: A 62-year-old woman presented with a 2-day history of nausea, fever and diffuse abdominal pain. CT scan revealed a well circumscribed small lesion of the pancreatic body. On arterial phase imaging, the mass was of low density relative to the pancreas without marked contrast enhancement. Based on these findings, the patient underwent surgical resection of this mass and a distal spleno-pancreatectomy was performed. Microscopic examination showed a well circumscribed but non encapsulated soft tissue proliferation consisted of blood vessels lined by a single layer of uniform flattened cells, with dilated lumen filled with red blood cells and inflammatory cells. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the vascular nature of the lesion. The diagnosis of pancreatic hemangioma was made. Conclusion: Adult pancreatic hemangioma is an extremely rare tumor. The review of all published cases showed that this tumor often do not demonstrate the contrast-enhanced CT features typical of an hemangioma, so a poor arterial phase enhancement cannot rule out pancreatic hemangioma and the histological examination is very important in these cases. Objective: Hepatocholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CC) is an uncommon form of primary liver cancer with features of hepatocellular and biliary epithelial differentiation. It accounts for 0.4-14.2 % of all primary liver carcinomas. Many of the demographic and clinical features of this tumor remain unclear. It was previously suggested that coexisting chronic liver diseases were rarely seen in patients with HCC-CC. Method: We report a case of HCC-CC diagnosed in patient with cirrhosis. Results: A 48 year-old man presented with ascites, jaundice, vomiting and symptoms of portal hypertension. On abdominal CT scan the right hepatic segment was heterogeneous, hypervascular in the late arterial phase and low-attenuated on portal venous phase. Based on a these clinicoradiological informations, diagnosis of infiltrating hepatocellular carcinoma was made and hepatic biopsy was performed. Histopathologic examination showed, in addition to features of liver cirrhosis, the presence of malignant proliferation composed of tubular structures as well as microtrabecular and compact foci. On Immunohistochemical stainings the tumor cells expressed cytokeratins 7 and 20. Cells lining the tubular structures reacted with cytokeratin 19 allowing the diagnosis of hepatocholangiocarcinoma. Conclusion: Hepatocholangiocarcinoma is a rare primary liver cancer. Preoperative noninvasive diagnosis with conventional radiography is often difficult especially when occurring in patients with liver cirrhosis or other hepatic chronic disease. The diagnosis is frequently made only after histological and immunohistochemical examination.",

Method: Sixty-one biopsies of hemodialysis patients and 326 biopsies from the general population with CHC were comparatively evaluated for the severity and specific histological features of CHC. Results were examined in relation to age, time of dialysis, viral load and genotype. Results: Patients on hemodialysis were older than patients of general population (p=0.031), showing a similar genotype distribution (p=0.328) and lower viral loads (p=0.001). CHC on hemodialysis was significantly milder according to stage (p=0.033), activity and its parameters (p<0.001). Significantly reduced was also the frequency of lymphoid aggregates (p< 0.001), bile duct damage (p<0.001) and steatosis. (p=0.033). Severity of hepatits was not associated with time on hemodialysis. In multivariate analysis the differences were independent of age, which was associated with more severe disease. Steatosis was associated with hemodialysis duration and age. Conclusion: CHC in hemodialysis patients is significantly milder than in general population. Limited necroinflammatory activity and absence of immune mediated lesions are indications of defective immune response although involvement of low viral load cannot be overlooked.",

Method: The presence of EZH2 has been studied by standard immunohistochemistry in several formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples (hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, hepatoblastoma, metastatic liver tumors and primitive childhood tumors). Results: Forty of 44 hepatocellular carcinomas, 22 of 23 cholangiocarcinomas, 29 of 31 hepatoblastomas and 14 of 17 metastatic liver tumors stained positively, but all the investigated hepatocellular adenomas (n = 24) and proliferating biliary structures were negative. The other primitive childhood tumors that were examined all expressed EZH2. Conclusion: Based on these results EZH2 is a sensitive marker of malignancy in hepatic tumors regardless of their histogenesis. In routine surgical pathology EZH2 could be helpful to diagnose hepatocellular carcinomas and it might be the first marker to distinguish transformed and reactive cholangiocytes.",

It is an oncofetal protein. \u0130n general, oncofetal proteins, while having a critical role in tumor progression or immunotherapy is a potent tumor marker used as a target. Alpha fetoprotein, clone C3 localized, normally produced by gestational age, fetal liver and yolc salc, glycoprotein structure emerging marker for patients with HCC. Hep Par 1 antibody was developed in 1993 using fixed liver as immunogen. Method: \u0130n this study formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded surgical specimens from 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed between 2000 and 2011 years in Ataturk University, Faculty of Medicine Department of pathology were studied with immunohistochemistry GPC3, Heppar 1, and AFP. GPC3, Heppar 1 and AFP expression was divided into 2 categories negative (negative or weak under %5 tumor cells cytoplasmic staining) and positive (and %5 over of tumour cells) moderate or strong cytoplasmic with membranous accentuation. Results: Immunpositivity at GPC3, Hep Par 1 and AFP were 85 %, 95 %, 75 % respectively. Objective: Fibroblastic growth factor receptor (FGFR) family is known to be related to the development and progression of various types of cancers. The aim of this study is to determine the clinical implication of FGFR expressions in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Method: Immunohistochemical analysis was done in 842 cases of HCC using tissue microarray. Diffuse cytoplasmic staining for FGFR1, 2, 3 and 4 in more than 10 % of tumor cells were designated as positive. The results were analyzed in terms of various clinicopathologic parameters. Results: On univariate analysis, the overall survival rates of patients with FGFR2 expression (152 cases, 18.1 %) were significantly lower than those with no expression (HR 1.838, 95 % CI 1.452-2.328, P<0.001). However, the overall survival rates of patients with FGFR4 expression (446 cases, 59.6 %) were significantly higher than those with no expression (HR 0.636, 95 % CI 0.521-0.776, P<0.001). There was no statistical significance between patients' overall survival rates and expressions of FGFR1 (46 cases, 5.5 %) or FGFR3 (33cases, 4.0 %). On multivariate analysis, only FGFR2 expression is independently associated with reduced OS (FGFR2: HR 1.790, 95 % CI 1.404-2.282, P<0.001). Conclusion: The FGFR2 expression can be used as an independent prognostic factor in patients with surgically resected HCC. Objective: HURP (hepatoma upregulated protein) is a putative oncogene, overexpressed in many human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma. It has also been shown recently that high HURP protein levels correlate with resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. In the present study we investigate the expression of HURP and its correlation with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, prognosis and patient survival. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the most aggressive types of cancer and represents the fourth most common cause of death, either in the male or in the female population of the United States of America. Method: HURP immunoreactivity was assessed by immunohistochemistry in a series of 28 primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas. In parallel, HURP expression was examined in 10 normal pancreatic tissues.

We present a case report of HCC diagnosed in patient with clinically unrecognized porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). Method: A 70-year old male was admitted to hospital complaining of a pressure below low costal margin, anamnesis of a trauma 1 year ago and clinical suspicion of a posttraumatic intrahepatic haematoma. By a surgery, a partialy necrotic and hemorrhagic tumor mass 10 cm in diameter was removed. Results: The mass corresponded histologicaly to moderately differentiated clear cell HCC, resembling renal clear-cell carcinoma. The surrounding parenchyme showed steatohepatitis with fibrosis and distinct intracellular porphyrin crystals. Conclusion: Development of HCC is a well documented complication of PCT, a disorder of porphyrin biosynthesis. PCT can be inherited (autosomal dominant trait), the acquired form (sporadic PCT) is more common. Known etiological factors of PCT include toxins, alcohol abuse, estrogens or chronic viral hepatitis, or association with other hepatic diseases like iron overload (including hereditary haemochromatosis) or chronic hepatitis C, increasing the risk of malignancy. However, in the presented case none of these associations was recognized and its etiology remains obscure. Objective: Signet ring cell carcinoma is an extremely rare type of gallbladder carcinoma composed overwhelmingly (90 %) of signet ring cells. Only a few cases of this histologic type have been published and detailed knowledge of this disease is not available. Method: We report a case of signet-ring cell carcinoma of the gallbladder in a 70-year-old woman who was admitted with epigastric pain. Under the preoperative diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, which was based on findings of CT scan and ultrasonography. Cholecystectomy was performed. Results: Microscopic examination revealed a signet ring cells tumor that arose from the sub epithelial layer of mucosa and involved all the layers of gallbladder. Nuclear atypia and mitoses were present. Periodic acid schiff (PAS) stain highlighted the intracellular mucin in the tumor cells. Lympho-vascular emboli were detected in the subserosal layer. The cystic duct surgical margins were invaded. Conclusion: Gallbladder adenocarcinomas are seen frequently, but signet-ring cell carcinoma is a rare entity. Owing to the location of the gallbladder, dissemination of the tumour to the adjacent tissues is usually presented at the time of the diagnosis. It is necessary to exclude a gastric or colonic signet ring cell carcinoma secondarily involving the gallbladder. Objective: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are mesenchyme neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract which express CD117. GISTs can occur in the entire length of gastrointestinal tract, but very seldom can also arise in omentum, mesentery and retroperitoneal space, kidney, urinary bladder etc. There they are located adjacent to stomach or intestine, but not originated from the latter. These tumors are designated as \"extra-gastrointestinal stromal tumors\" (EGISTs). There are only 14 description of the Primary EGISTs reported in the literature. Method: We report a case of a pancreatic EGIST in a 38year-old female patient. Results: CT scan showed a mass in the head of pancreas. Grossly encapsulated tumor, 9 cm in diameter, was found in the head of the pancreas (Figure 1) . Histologically, tumor demonstrated spindle-cell pattern consisted of distinct fascicles and bands. The number of mitoses was 1-2/50 high power fields in \"hot-spot\" areas. IHC revealed strong positivity for CD117, CD 34 in neoplastic cells and negative for SMA, desmin, S-100. Ki67 labeling index was 3 %. Conclusion: We presented a rare case of pancreatic GIST. The tumor has very good prognosis. Hepatoblastoma is classified as epithelial (56 %) or mixed epithelial/mesenchymal (44 %). Epithelial hepatoblastoma is further divided to pure fetal (31 %), embryonal (19 %), macrotrabecular (3 %) and small cell undifferentiated (3 %). Aim: To increase the awareness regarding possibility of hepatoblastoma in adult age. Method: We review four cases of hepatoblastoma epithelial type diagnosed in Pathology Department of Fundeni Clinical Institute between 2009 and 2012. Immunohistochemistry was done in all cases: CEA, Vimentin, CK 8/18, CK 19, CK 20, Ki 67, TTF1, CD 10, CD 34, CD 56, MUC 5A, alpha-fetoprotein. Results: Two of the patients were males and two females with age ranging between 17 and 27 years. The tumors varying in size from 8 to 12 cm. On microscopic examination the tumor was composed mainly of epithelial elements. The pathological diagnosis was epithelial hepatoblastoma epithelial type. Conclusion: Hepatoblastoma is a rare tumor in adult age and epithelial type is the rarest from all type of hepatoblastoma in adult age. The pathological diagnostic is quite difficult even using immunohistochemistry because none of the markers are not specific for hepatoblastoma.",

A group of these livers develop a combination of areas of necrosis and regenerative macronodules (RMN). Method: Sequential biochemical and clinical data and tissues from two groups of patients were compared. Group 1: 10 cases of submassive necrosis associated with RMN; Group 2: 19 cases with total confluent necrosis without nodular regeneration. Results: Group 1: mean age was 33,6 years (ranged 10 months-63 years); group 2 mean age was 42,6 years (ranged 18 months-63 years) (p>0,05). A longer course (42,8\u00b134,6 days vs 12,6\u00b16,0, p<0.05) and higher maximum serum bilirubin levels (23,5 mg/dl \u00b113,08 vs 14,9 mg/dl\u00b1 10,9, p<0 .05) were observed in group 1. Serum AST, ALT and gamma-GT were lower in group 1 (p>0.05). Morphologically livers from group 1 showed well defined regenerative green-yellow nodules with large regenerative hepatocytes in acinar pattern without surrounding fibrosis. The remaining parenchyma showed confluent necrosis, haemorrhage, mixed inflammatory infiltrate and ductular proliferation. Conclusion: A special anatomoclinical form of subacute liver failure was characterized by regenerative macronodules in a background of extensive confluent liver necrosis. Illness duration was longer and had higher maximum bilirubin levels than those without RMN.",

Method: We performed CT and pathological correlations in 22 cases of HC (5 cases of highly (h-HCC), 11 cases of moderate (m-HCC) and 4 cases of low differentiated HCC (l-HCC)). Results: Vessels number in w-HCC in compare to m-HCC was higher by 26.1 % (p<0.05). Total vessel area was higher in m-HCC and l-HCC than in w-HCC by 11.7 % and 20.4 % accordingly. We observed positive correlation between CT density of h-HCC and number and total vessel area. Correlation between h-HCC CT density and mean vessel area was negative. We also revealed modest negative correlation between m-HCC density and the number vessels in all phases of CT. Negative correlation between total and mean vessel area and m-HCC density was revealed in native and arterial CT phases in compare with venous and delayed phases where positive correlation was revealed. In all phases of CT we revealed strong negative correlation between l-HCC density and the number of vessels whereas correlation between l-HCC density and mean vessel area was strongly negative.

Present study investigated; could nuclear morphometery differentiate histomorphologically similar paediatric malignant small round cell tumors in H & E stained sections for using in a poor resource country? Method: Morphometric analysis was done in 26 confirmed but difficult to differentiate round cell tumors histomorphologically and were analyzed by cell images from 6 different areas in each section, using Leica Q win 500 images software. Results: Nuclear measurements were obtained for retinoblastoma (9), Hodgkin lymphoma (6), Wilms tumor (3), medulloblastoma (2), Ewing's sarcoma (2), alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (1), malignant hemangiopericytoma (1), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (1) and neuroblastoma (1). Amongst the retinoblastomas, maximum mean nuclear area percent (24.93) was seen in cases with nerve involvement and metastasis, followed by cases with only nerve involvement (21.60) and smallest area (16.57) was in non-nerve involving, non metastatic cases. Wilms tumor cases with metastasis had higher nuclear area (21.25) than non metastatic (19.47). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma nuclear area (20.03) was more than Hodgkin's (18.60). Amongst all tumors, minimum value (14.93) was seen in malignant hemangiopericytoma. Conclusion: Morphometric evaluation in paediatric malignant round cell tumors have generated useful data, and needs further multicentric confirmation for implementation. Objective: Survivin, a bifunctional protein that regulates cell division and suppresses apoptosis, may play an important role in tumorigenesis. The aim of this study was to determine survivin expression patterns in Wilms tumor (WT) and to analyze it in relation to stage, prognostic category and histological type. Method: Immunohistochemical expression of survivin was analysed in 59 cases of primary WT and in 10 normal kidney specimens uninvolved by the tumor. Results: Fifty one out of 59 cases of WT (86.44 %) showed decreased cytoplasmic survivin expression compared to the expression in normal kidney tissue. Decreased cytoplasmic expression (in all components of WT) of survivin was found significantly more often in low stage compared to high stage WTs (86.7 % vs. 27.3 %; p=0.002). Tumors of intermediate risk group showed more often decreased cytoplasmic expression of survivin in comparison to high risk group, but the difference was not significant. Decreased survivin expression was found more frequent in WTs with diffuse anaplasia and in epithelial WTs compared to other histological types, but without statistically significant difference. Conclusion: Decreased survivin cytoplasmic expression may be associated with the favorable prognosis WT. Objective: Hepatic tumors accounted 5 % of congenital neoplasms. Mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver is a rare benign tumor of children. We report a case of hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma in a premature male neonate. Method: A premature neonate born at 33 gestational weeks from 34 year-old mother, G3P3 with non-consanguineous marriage; prenatal ultrasonography showed a fetal macrosomia, a highly vascularized abdominal mass occupying two-third of the abdomen and displacing the bowel loops associated with poly-hydramnios. The newborn examination showed abdominal firm lump. Ultrasound found and anterior highly vascularized mass displacing the left lobe of liver. The infant died few hours later. A complete autopsy was performed. Results: External examination showed a male neonate anatomically of 34-35 week having an increased periombilical diameter and a macrosomia, ascitis, pulmonary hypoplasia, cardiomegaly, pleuropericardial effusion, liver tumor developed in left lobe and dilation of renal vessels. Histologically the tumor showed a mixture of normal liver tissues with blood or lymphatic vessels, bile ducts within an abundant edematous and myxoid stroma. Conclusion: In neonate and fetus, prenatal diagnosis is possible by ultrasonography. Large tumors can affect the viability of the newborn. Adequate excision is curative in most of cases.",

M\u00fcller, G. M\u00fcller, J. Markovic-Lipkovski * Inst. for Pathology, Nephropathology, Belgrade, Serbia Objective: Objective: Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is widely expressed on mesenchymal and early tubular epithelial cells during kidney development although with still undefined function. NCAM can be polysialylated and as PSA-NCAM has been shown to be involved in proliferation and migration of neuronal cells during brain development. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of PSA-NCAM in nephron precursors in relation to the expression of renal progenitor and proliferation markers. Method: Human fetal and neonatal kidneys were analyzed using double-immunofluorescence (dIF) staining and Western Blot (WB) analysis. Specific antibodies against NCAM, PSA-NCAM, EpCAM, CD24 and Ki-67 were applied. Results: On WB only fetal tissue samples have bands with NCAM at 140 to 250 kDa which suggest that NCAM molecule is polysialylated; dIF analysis of fetal tissue show PSA-NCAM + Ki-67+ cells in all structures known as nephron precursors. While in neonatal tissue PSA-NCAM and Ki-67 were positive only on rare single cells in intersticium. Conclusion: PSA-NCAM expression appears to characterize a very early stage of induced nephron progenitors differentiating from NCAM + EpCAM-mesenchymal cells. According to PSA-NCAM localization and coexpression with Ki-67 during development and its practically absence in neonatal tissue, suggest that PSA-NCAM present potential initiator of proliferation and differentiation of renal progenitor. Objective: Cystic hygroma (CH) typically develops in utero, late in the first trimester to early in the second trimester of gestation. Many of the fetuses with CH present additional malformations commonly associated with chromosomal anomalies. Method: A review of 548 fetal autopsies performed over a 10 year period revealed 19 cases of CH (3,4 %). The results of cytogenetic analysis and the prenatal ultrasound findings were retrieved and compared to the autopsy findings. Results: Fetal death was due to therapeutic abortion in 9/19 cases, intrauterine death in 8/19 cases, and spontaneous abortion in 2/19 cases. Cytogenetic analysis was available in 12 cases. The results showed an abnormal karyotype in 7 cases (5 cases of Turner syndrome and 2 cases of trisomy 21). The mean size of CH was 5,4 cm. Other findings suggestive of the cause of fetal death were diagnosed in 10/19 cases (52,6 %). The most common autopsy findings were hydrops and central nervous system anomalies. The autopsy findings were in agreement with the prenatal ultrasound findings in 14/19 cases, while in 5 cases (26,3 %) additional findings were detected during autopsy. Conclusion: Our study is confirms the strong correlation between CH and chromosomal anomalies of the fetus.",

Purpose of this study was to compare the expression of E-cadherin in metastatic and primary tumor cases in Latvia. Method: 26 cases of primary tumors, 8 metastases and 1 case of relapse were analyzed immunohistochemically using visualization system EnVision. The number of E-cadherin positive structures per field was assessed (magnification\u00d7 100). Comparison between primary tumors and metastatic/ relapse tumors groups was made using Mann-Whitney test. Results: In primary tumor group the number of positive structures in the field ranged from 0 to 86, average 27.19, SD 24.13. In the metastatic tumor group, the number of positive structures varied from 0 to 40, average 9.89, SD 14.87. Comparison of expression observed in both primary and metastatic tumors groups showed the decreased E-cadherin expression in metastatic tumor group (Z= \u22122.33, p=0.046).

            "text": "Objective: Fibrous Hamartoma (FH) of childhood is uncommon benign tumor. They are generally seen in the head and neck region, gastrointestinal system and lung. As in the case we report, they may also occur in other unusual sites such as groin and testis. The clinical presentation is almost always a mass or swelling, however our case was admitted to our hospital because of a left testicular atrophy. We report a FH in the testis, which has a rarely location and clinical presentation. Method: A 7-year-old male presented to department of pediatric surgery because of left testicular atrophy. Left orchiectomy was performed. Results: In macroscopic examination, testis dimension was 1.5\u00d71.3\u00d70.4 cm. Its cut surface was smooth and dirtywhite. In microscopic examination, the tumor showed disorganized matur tissue that composed of fibrocollagen stroma, vessels, muscular and adipose tissue. By this findings, it was diagnosed as testicular fibrous hamartoma (TFH). Conclusion: In conclusion, TFH should be always kept in mind with testicular atrophy not only testicular mass or swelling. And knowledge of this particular type lesion is important to distinguish the FH of childhood from other situations in testis such as testicular torsion, incarcerated hernia, malign neoplasm, etc. in order to allow a correct diagnosis and avoid inadequate treatment.",

Method: From January 1990 to December 2010 (Institute of Pathology, Paolo Giaccone-Palermo) 2643 autopsies on dead uterine foetuses were performed. 1637 cases were abortions (<25 weeks), 1006 were stillbirths (\u226525 weeks). In all cases the autopsy included a macroscopic and microscopic examination both of the foetus and the placenta. The final diagnosis of death was based on both the morphological and clinical data. Of the 1006 stillbirths, 715 cases were \"risk factor pregnancies\", 291 non. Results: The stillbirth mortality was classified as follows: -Sudden Intrauterine Unexplained Death (SIUD,\"sine materia\" and absence of risk factor autopsies),4 cases; -Explained Intrauterine Death (\"cum materia\" with or without risk factor autopsies),987 cases; -Borderline Intrauterine Death (\"sine materia\" and presence of risk factor autopsies),15 cases. Conclusion: In the absence of autopsy in 715/1006 cases it was possible to establish the cause of death based on the presence of risk factors.

            "text": "Objective: The role of systematic autopsy in foetal CHD is to identify the morphology of cardiac and possible associated extracardiac malformations (ECM) and the correlation between morphology, suspected clinical etiology and genetics. We evaluated the role of autopsy in 643 foetal CHDs with/without prenatal diagnosis. Method: From January 1990 to December 2010 (Institute of Pathology, Paolo Giaccone -Palermo), 2371 foetal autopsies were performed. The autopsy protocol used was \"tomography\" for abortions, the \"traditional\" technique was adopted for stillbirths. Results: In 643 cases CHDs were identified. In 196 cases CHD diagnosis was made only through autopsy, in 447 after a certain (244) or suspect (203) clinical/genetic diagnosis. The etiology of CHD associated to ECM (621) was: chromosomic type (271), syndromic/sequence type (233), association type (117). The etiology of CHD without ECM (22) was never syndromic. Conclusion: \"Traditional\" and \"tomography\" autopsy plays a key role in the diagnosis and counselling of CHD, either when it represents the only diagnostic tool (30,48 %) or when it is preceded by a clinical/genetic study. In the latter cases, its value depends on the detection of ECM, useful to \"consolidate\" a suspect clinical diagnosis (31,57 %) and to \"complete\" a malformative picture etiologically known thanks to a clinical/genetic analysis (37,9 %). Objective: Deregulation of cell cycle control is a hallmark of cancer. We have examined protein expression and gene amplification of cyclin A in Wilms tumor (WT) and to analyze it in relation to tumor stage, prognostic group and histological type. Method: Real-Time Quantitative PCR was used to detect gene amplification of cyclin A in tumor tissue from 36 patients with WT, while immunohistochemistry was applied to detect protein expression of the same cyclin. Results: Cyclin A gene amplification was found in 4 out of the 36 (11.8 %) cases of WT. Cyclin A protein overexpression was detected in all four cases, but was also found in 84.7 % of cases without detectable gene amplification. So, there was no significant correlation between cyclin A gene amplification and protein overexpression. All cases with amplification of cyclin A were of favorable histological type, intermediate risk group and three out of four cases were low stage WTs. On the other hand, overexpression of cyclin A was found significantly more often in high stage WTs compared to low stage WTs (p=0.04). Conclusion: Cyclin A gene amplification might be associated with the favorable prognosis of WT (low stage, intermediate risk group and non-anaplastic tumors). The gold standard to diagnose is lung biopsy or necropsy. Up to 40 % of cases have mutations or deletions in the gene FOXF1 (cr16q24.1) who plays a crucial role in the development of the lung vasculature. Method: We report a case of a term newborn female affected of ACD/MPV who was diagnosed by a lung biopsy. She died at 38 days of life. Autopsy and molecular diagnosis were also performed Results: In the biopsy and autopsy specimens a decline in the number of capillaries in the alveolar septa and detachment of the epithelial lining was observed. Secondary proximal plexiform arteriopathy, muscularization of arterioles and venous-venular dilatation and proliferation were evident. A pathogenic mutation in the gene FOXF1 (frame shift mutation in the first exon) confirmed our diagnosis. Conclusion: ACD is defined by a decrease in capillaries with alveolar septal thickening and hypertrophy of the middle muscular layer of arterioles. MPV suggests an imbalance of angiogenesis. The FOXF1 mutation helps to prenatal diagnoses of high risk families and to give the diagnosis to patients who fail to perform biopsy or autopsy. Objective: Prognosis of Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) has improved significantly over the last 20 years. Overall survival (OS) is>80 % in the majority of patients; even though, children with metastatic tumors have a dismal prognosis with an OS <30 %. Method: We analyzed in 18 cases, the possible correlation of Notch activation with histology, presence of metastasis and outcome. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for the Notch downstream effectors Hes1 and Hey1. Results: Hes 1 was strong or moderate in 95 % of the cases. Hey1 was positive in 50 %. 3 out of 4 alveolar RMS (aRMS) were positive for Hes1 and 1 was positive for Hey1. Both stains were negative in the fusion-negative aRMS. In embryonal RMS (eRMS), eight out the 9 were Hey1 positive and 14 of the 17 were Hes1 positive. The 2 patients whit metastases had staining for Hes1 and Hey1. 3 patients who died showed Hes1(+). 14 of the 15 patients in remission showed positivity for Hes1 and 7 for Hey1. Conclusion: Hes1 expression was found in the majority of RMS while Hey1 was more eRMS specific. Is no correlation between pathway activation, metastasis or outcome. The blockage of the pathway with specific inhibitors could offer a new therapeutic option for this patients.",

Method: 6 infants (up to 1 year of age) who died of SIDS and 23 controls who died of other non-pulmonary causes were examined. Peribronchial mast cells exhibiting tryptase immunoreactivity were evaluated and quantified in high power fields in lung sections. Results: The number of mast cells in peribronchial regions amounted to 18,9 (\u00b1 6,6)/mm2 in children aged 1 month up to 13 months. Mast cells in SIDS cases were 21,2 (\u00b1 4,5)/mm2. The difference was not significant (P=0,113, Student'st test). Conclusion: It is unlikely that increased pulmonary mast cells are indicators of SIDS.

Fetal autopsy was performed. Genetic counseling was proposed to the family revealing Moroccan origin and consanguinity, the parents were first cousins. Results: A male fetus showing cyclopia, proboscis and a single opening with two rudimentary eyes was the external morphology. Histological examination confirmed holoprosencephaly and also showed bilateral corticomedullary renal multicystic and periportal hepatic fibrosis with bile duct dilatation. The main diagnosis was MGS although other ciliophaties and non-ciliopathies conditions were considered, such as Bardet-Bield, Joubert, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome and trisomy 13. However, the pathological characterization, parent's consanguinity and their North African origin makes MGS the likely diagnosis.A genetic study on paraffin-embedded material was requested, the poor quality of DNA stopped definitive genetic diagnosis.

Clinically, mesenteric cysts are generally comprehended as a unique diagnostic entity, although they exhibit histological diversity. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence and the histology of the mesenteric cysts in the pediatric age. Method: All cases of mesenteric cysts operated at the University Children's Hospital Belgrade over the 10-year period of 2002 to 2011 were reviewed using pathology reports from the files of the Institute of Pathology. Histological slides were re-examined and immunohistochemistry was applied, when necessary. Results: A total of 27 cases of mesenteric cysts were identified. Cysts of lymphatic origin (cystic lymphangiomas) were recorded in 12 patients (44 %), cysts of enteric origin -in 14 patients (52 %): 13 duplication cysts and one isolated enteric cyst of the mesenterium. Only one example of the cyst of mesothelial origin, i.e. benign cystic mesothelioma was diagnosed (4 %). The most frequent site was mesenterium and mesocolon (86 %), followed by omentum (7 %) and the retroperitoneum (7 %). Conclusion: Cysts of enteric origin are easily recognized. It is important to differentiate between cystic lymphangioma and cystic mesothelioma due to their different natural history.

The tumor was located in the deep mammary tissue an it infiltrated the overlying dermis without involving the epidermis. It consisted of atypical stelate and spindle cells with infrequent mitoses and low Ki-67 proliferative index. On the periphery mature adipocytes and lipoblasts were present. Stroma was abundant, myxoid with plexiform capillary pattern. The myxoid substance stained slightly Alcian-blue positive and tumor cells showed cytoplasmic immunopositivity for S100. Phylodes tumor was excluded because of absence of epithelial component. Conclusion: Myxoid liposarcoma has a distinct morphology, rarely confused with other soft tissue tumors, although on cytological smears or biopsy samples it may be unrecognized. Objective: Synovial sarcoma poses a difficult diagnostic challenge since it can be confused with other benign or malignant entities. Method: Four biphasic and one monophasic synovial sarcomas were studied. We used the break apart/split signal kit (VYSIS) to detect the t(X;18) translocation and we performed immunohistochemistry for TLE-1, INI-1, D2-40, CD56, CD99, bcl-2, EMA, CK7, CD34, S-100, Desmin and Claudin-1. Results: Immunohistochemically we observed: TLE-1+(5/ 5), INI-1 (4/5) with reduced nuclear and (1/5) with no expression, D2-40+(1/5), CD56+(5/5), CD99+(5/5), bcl-2 +(5/5), EMA focal expression (5/5), CK7\u2212(5/5), CD34\u2212(5/ 5), S-100\u2212(5/5), Desmin\u2212(5/5), Claudin-1 + (5/5). FISH revealed the split signal between the centromeric and telomeric end of the SYT gene. Conclusion: t(X;18) translocation remains the diagnostic hallmark of synovial sarcoma. INI-1 which is typically negative in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, epithelioid sarcoma and myoepithelial carcinoma seems to be reduced or even negative in synovial sarcomas. The focal expression of D2-40 must be considered when the differential diagnosis includes mesothelioma. Finally TLE-1 is a very sensitive marker for synovial sarcoma.",

Conclusion: Cysts with overlapping features of ABC and SBC are not uncommon. Though they usually represent \"SBCs with secondary ABC component\", they have dissimilarites with ordinary SBCs which needs to be further clarified with larger series. Objective: Percent of tumor necrosis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, determined by detailed specimen mapping, has a high prognostic value. However both the mapping and grading systems has some practical problems. Method: 128 cases were reviewed for potential pitfalls in handling and reporting processes and correlated with radiological findings by nonparametric-tests. Results: Most of the tumors were osteosarcoma (74.2 %) and Ewing Sarcoma (16.4 %), located in femur (53 %), tibia (22,7 %) and humerus (10.2 %). Cortex, soft tissue and joint invasion was observed in 94 %, 77.6 % and 30.3 % of the cases, respectively. A median of 27.5 tumor blocks (9-74\u00b1 14,64) were submitted for histology. Tumors were totally necrotic in 30 cases (24 %) (Huvos Grade-HG-IV), HG III in 20.3 %, HG II in 28.1 % and HG I in 24.2 % of the cases. Overall good (HG III-IV) and poor responders (HG I-II) correlated well with radiological findings (p<0.001). Discrepant cases showed extensive oedema and congestion enhancing contrast medium, patchy necrosis unabling accurate histologic evalation, or failure to prove tibiofibuler joint involvement because of sagittal sectioning (p<0.05).",

It is localized mainly in soft tissues. Its biological behavior is aggressive, but its response to the chemotherapy is prognostically good. Method: A 4-month old male is presented with the 17\u00d711 cm tumor of the soft tissue, localized in the right front over the cranial margin of the orbit. The tumor was surgically exstirpated and then sent to the histological investigation with the additional immunohistochemistry and the FISH. Results: Microscopically, the tumor is hypercelullar and consisted of oval to polygonal cells with the vesicular nuclei, the prominent nuclei and the amphophilic cytoplasm. In other parts of the tumor, there are smaller neoplastic cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. Some neoplastic cells contain the melanin pigment in the cytoplasm, which was positive in Fontana-Masson method. The immunohistochemical stains for vimentin, AE1/3, CK7, CD99, HMB-45, FLI-1 were positive.

Objective: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a nuclear enzyme involved in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks. PARP-1 inhibitors may be efficient in therapy of malignancies. This report evaluates the expression of PARP-1 in primary testicular germ cell tumors and correlates expression patterns with histological subtypes and patient/ tumor characteristics. Method: Group of 124 patients with testicular germ cell tumors were investigated for PARP-1 expression by immunohistochemistry, scored by the multiplicative quickscore (QS) method and compared to PARP-1 expression in normal testis. Results: We observed higher expression of PARP1 in testicular tumors compared to normal testis (mean QS=10.04 vs. 3.60, p< 0.0000001). The PARP-1 overexpression (QS>9) was most often detected in intratubular germ cell neoplasia ITGCN (100 % of specimen with PARP-1 overexpression), compared to 1.9 % of normal testicular tissue specimen. There was no association between PARP-1 expression and clinical variables. Conclusion: PARP-1 expression is higher in tumor tissue than in normal testis. PARP-1 could represent a novel treatment target in TGCTs and the assessment of PARP-1 expression in tumor samples may lead to the consideration of TGCTs patients for PARP inhibitor therapy.

Objective: Gardner fibroma (GAF), a rare lesion, typically occurs in infants, children and young adults, with predilection for the trunk (particularly paraspinal region) and no gender predominance. GAF is an ill-defined plaque-like mass, with rubbery consistence, usually asymptomatic, ranging from 0.3 to 12 cm. Although benign, 70-90 % of the cases may be associated with APC mutations, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and/or Gardner Syndrome (GS). We report 2 cases of GAF, which allowed the identification of 2 families with GS. Results: CASE 1: 7-month-old boy, with 2 nodules in the left paraspinal region, the largest with 2.5 cm. CASE 2: 5month-old boy, presenting a 1.5 cm ill-defined deep right scapular mass. Both lesions were infiltrative, paucicelular densely collagenized proliferations of bland spindle cells. A GAF diagnosis was made and clinical/genetic investigation advised. APC gene sequentiation revealed, in both cases, a frameshift germline mutation in exon 15. Additionally, case 1 presented a del(5)(q11q35). Heredogram showed typical manifestations of GS: CASE 1: Mandibular osteomas, epidermoid cysts, \"soft-tissue tumours\", colo-rectal carcinoma. CASE 2: Hepatoblastoma, colo-rectal carcinoma. Conclusion: Given the high association with GS and the fact that it can be its first manifestation, GAF is considered a sentinel lesion for this syndrome. Therefore, an accurate diagnosis is of the utmost importance.",

Method: In this study; ten-year tumor free survival rate was 38 % reflecting the agressive behaviour of synovial sarcoma. Tumor grade was the most valuable prognostic input. Progression free survival (PFS) was 159 months for gradeII cases (40 cases) and 36 months for gradeIII cases (24 cases) (p=0,000). Results: Immunohistochemically, there was weak relation between bcl-2 staining intensity with prognosis.

Method: Complex morphological study of 16 abdominal desmoids. All the tumors were divided into 3 groups: primary, first recurrent and second and more recurrent cases. We used antibodies against \u03b2-cathenin, COX-2, APC, survivin and Ki-67 for immunohistochemical study. Results: Nuclear and cytoplasmic \u03b2-cathenin expression levels were significantly higher in recurrent than in primary desmoids. APC cytoplasmic expression level was also significantly higher in recurrent tumors. We revealed only cytoplasmic COX-2 expression in desmoids, and its level was significantly higher in recurrent tumors with the activity increasing accordingly to the number of recurrences. Survivin expressed both in nuclei and cytoplasm of the tumor cells and its expression levels were significantly lower in recurrent desmoids. Conclusion: Revealed immunohistochemical properties of primary and recurrent desmoids reflect tumor transformation and progression and could be used as additional prognostic markers in this disease. Objective: Many bone and soft tissue sarcomas (BSTS) are aggressive tumors with fatal prognosis. The importance of angiogenesis for the growth and progression of solid BSTS is now well recognized. A variety of chemokines have been described that either promote (angiogenic) or inhibit (angiostatic) angiogenesis. The aim of this study is to characterize the expression profile of some chemokines in a series of xenotransplanted human BSTS. Method: One Ewing sarcoma (ES), 1 grade 3 chondrosarcoma (Chs), 1 osteosarcoma (Os), 1 synovial sarcoma (SS), 1 fibrosarcoma and 1 gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) were xenotransplanted into the backs of nude mice (athymic Balb-c nude mice). When the tumor size reached the 3 cm, animals were sacrificed and tumors analyzed for the expression of CXCL1/2/3, CXCL9 and CXCL10, using two-color staining fluorescence on each slide under a confocal microscope (Olympus FV1000). Results: We observed that angiostatic chemokines (CXCL9 and CXCL10) presented higher expression than angiogenic (CXCL1/2/3) chemokines in ES, grade 3 Chs, Os and GIST whereas fibrosarcoma and SS were more positive for angiogenic chemokines. Conclusion: The expression profile of angiostatic and angiogenic chemokines depends on the type of BSTS and could be related to their different biological behaviour. Other elements such as angiogenic or pro-inflammatory markers should also be considered. Objective: The wide range of differential diagnostic possibilities of rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) shows the need for more specific and sensitive markers. Low survival rates of high risk RMS patients require new prospective therapeutic targets. Method: Archival material FFPE samples of 15 RMS (12 embryonal -eRMS, 3 alveolar -aRMS) and non-RMS soft tissue tumors were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for myogenin, MyoD1, EGFR, VEGF, COX-2, p-Akt and p-mTOR expression. The presence of PAX3/7-FKHR forming translocations, myogenin, MyoD1, gamma subunit of fetal acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and K-RAS mutational state were determined by RT-PCR. Results: 10/12 eRMS and 3/3 aRMS showed expression of myogenin, MyoD1 and gamma AChR. Non-RMS tumors were negative. Translocations were only found in aRMS. EGFR expression was characteristic for eRMS, without the presence of activating K-RAS mutation. Strong expression of VEGF was detected in all samples. p-AKT and p-mTOR showed overlapping expressions in 86,7 % RMS. In most of the samples weak COX-2 positivity was demonstrated. Conclusion: Myogenin, MyoD1 and the fetal AChR are specific and sensitive diagnostic markers of RMS. RMS subtypes are identifiable by PAX3/7-FKHR detection and probably EGFR expression. The results indicate VEGF, EGFR, COX-2 and Akt-mTOR pathway directed therapy to be considered in RMS. Supported by ITMS 26240220052.",

Although histologically benign, desmoids are locally invasive and often have an unpredictable clinical course. DTs are infrequent lesions, but they have a high incidence in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). The treatment of DTs needs to be individualized. Method: To explore the molecular bases of potential pharmacologic targets in DTs we evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of steroid hormone receptors (ERa, ERb, PR) and COX-2 protein in sporadic (n=6) and FAPassociated desmoid tumors (n=9) together with GI adenomas of FAP patients (n=5). Results: Nuclear ERb expression was found in 14/15 DTs. All adenoma samples showed nuclear ERb positivity, which was weaker than in the surrounding normal epithelial cell. ERa and PR expression were lacking in all samples. COX-2 was found in 14/15 DTs. Adenomatous polyps showed intense COX-2 expression compared to surrounding normal mucosa. Conclusion: High incidence of ERb positivity in DTs supports the usage of hormonal therapy in these lesions. Open question is the effect of anti-estrogen therapy in DT patients with adenomatous polyps, as in adenomas estrogen seems to have preventive potential. COX-2 expression suggests the benefit of anti-inflammatory treatment in DTs adenomatous polyps. Supported by ITMS: 26240220052.",

Most cases are sporadic, although there is a link with colonic polyposis, trauma, and oestrogen. They predominate in 25-35 year-old women. This present case is notable due to its location in the jejunal wall, possible relation with previous surgery, and the age and sex of the patient. Method: We present a 51-year-old male patient previously operated for umbilical hernia years before. He came to the consultation on noticing an abdominal mass. Since the initial suspicion was of jejunal wall GIST tumour, surgery was performed. Results: The histopathological and immunohistochemical findings, support the diagnosis of desmoid tumour. Conclusion: Desmoid tumours consist of fibroblastic monoclonal proliferation developed from aponeurotic muscle structures. Some authors consider them non-neoplastic processes given their limited aggressiveness while others classify them within distinct low-grade sarcomas. Their origin is not well established, although there are known factors involved such as mutations in the APC gene or beta-catenin and trisomy 20 and 8. The originating cell, the myofibroblast, is involved in post-traumatic cellular regeneration. This explains why we find these tumours associated with previous surgery.",

Method: The aim of the study was to perform an analysis of patients with advanced DFSP treated with imatinib, with or without surgery. We examined 15 patients (6 male, 9 female; median age 56 years) with locally advanced/initially inoperable and/or metastatic DFSP treated with imatinib 400-800 mg daily between 12/2004 and 06/2009. All diagnoses were ascertained cytogenetically (fluorescent in situ hybridization). Median follow-up time was 16 months (range: 4-81). Results: Metastases were present in 8 cases (two lungs, two soft tissue, two lymph nodes). Fibrosarcomatous transformation was confirmed in 7 patients. After treatment with imatinib overall responses were: 10 partial responses, 2 stable diseases (13 %) and 3 progressive diseases (20 %). Seven patients (47 %) after resection had residual disease confirmed by pathologic examination and remained free of disease. Conclusion: We proved that anti-tumour effect of imatinib in DFSP with presence t(17;22) had in most cases good responses. Imatinib therapy may in some cases leads to tumour resection because of lesser size. Objective: At an estimated incidence of 2 cases per million per year, osteosarcoma is the most common malignant primary bone tumor. Method: We conducted a retrospective study to identify the osteosarcoma cases diagnosed at major tertiary care hospitals in Turkey. Results: Our study group was made up of 745 cases: 440 men, 305 women, aged 3-82 years (mean 23.7 year). All patients had been diagnosed with skeletal osteosarcoma between 2001 and 2011 at one of the 10 tertiary care referral center. Tumor was most frequently located in femur (50.4 %) followed by tibia. Apart from the long bones, pelvic and gnatic bones were the next in location, 4.4 % and 1.6 % respectively. There were 16 (2.1 %) secondary osteosarcomas, related to previous irradiation and various underlying diseases. For the histological types conventional osteblastic intramedullary tumors were most prevalent, making 71.8.% of the cases. Chondroblastic and telengiectatic osteosarcoma are the next common histologic types. Surface tumors were detected in 51 (6.8 %) cases. Rare histological types like small cell, epitheloid, chondroblastoma like and fibrous dysplasia like were also reported. Conclusion: This study is conducted as a preliminary work to form the basis of a pathologic database for the osteosarcoma cases diagnosed in our country.

Cost constraints limit molecular confirmation in every case. Lately, TLE1 has been recognized as a useful IHC marker. Herein, we present IHC review of 42 synovial sarcomas, including TLE1 expression. Method: Forty-two synovial sarcomas included monophasic spindle-cell type (26) (61.9 %), biphasic 13 (30.9 %), calcifying (2) (4.7 %) and poorly-differentiated type (1) (2.3 %). 21 tumors were confirmed with molecular analysis. TLE1 immunostaining was graded from 0, 1+, 2+, 3+, with 2+ or 3+ grades interpreted as positive staining. Results: On IHC, various synovial sarcomas were positive for EMA (26/34)(76.4 %), CK7 (6/10) (60 %), CK/MNF116 (6/21)(28.6 %), BCL2 (36/37)(97.3 %), MIC2 (23/ 31)(74.1 %) and TLE1 (40/42)(95.2 %), while negative for CD34 (0/21). Among 70 other tumors, TLE1 was positive in schwannomas (5/5) (100 %), neurofibromas (2/2)(100 %), MPNSTs (2/12)(17 %) and PNETs (4/10)(40 %). Sensitivity and specificity of TLE1 for synovial sarcoma was 95.2 % and 72 %. 50 % of PNST (75 % of schwanomas, 50 % of MPNST and 25 % of neurofibromas). In contrast, HER3 positivity was observed in 20 % of other mesenchymal tumors (28 % uterine and 9 % non-uterine leiomiomas, 18 % uterine and 25 % nonuterine leiomiosarcomas, 29 % UPS). Conclusion: HER3 overexpression is frequently found in PNST, including 50 % of MPNST. Due to the crucial role of HER3 receptor in cell signalling as a main activator of the PI3K pathway, these results support the rationale of developing new therapeutic approaches in MPNST. Objective: Nonneural granular cell tumour (NNGCT) is a rare neoplasm described in 1991 by Leboit et al. Till now, no more than 35 cases have been presented in the literature, nearly all were limited to the skin. We report the first NNGCT of the breast and present its morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics. Method: A 39 year-old female underwent lumpectomy because of tumour of the breast. After routine histological examination, the immunohistochemical studies were performed using commercially available antibodies against cytokeratins (AE1/AE3), CD68, CD1A, S100, CD34, smooth muscle actin, desmin, miogenin, inhibin, and Ki67 antigen (MiB1). Results: Microscopically, the tumour was composed of ovoid and polygonal cells with abundant granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm. The cells presented mild or moderate polymorphism and trace mitotic activity. They were arranged in diffuse sheets with no evidence of nesting or fasciculation. The histological texture of the tumour resembled that of classical granular cell tumour of Abrikosoff. However, the tumour cells were strongly immunoreactive for CD68 and inhibin, whereas the reactions against S100 protein as well as other antigens studied gave negative results. The value of Ki67 index did not exceed 2-3 %. Conclusion: The differential diagnosis of granular cell myoblastoma (Abrikossoff tumour) should include the nonneural granular cell tumour.",

No effective targeted therapies are currently available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression and mutational status of potential molecular therapeutic targets. Method: 38 molecularly confirmed cases of synovial sarcomas were included in this study. Immunohistochemical stainings of the EGF-R family (EGF-R, HER2/neu, HER3), and signaling molecules implicated in the mTOR pathway (AKT, mTOR, PTEN), as well as E-Cadherin and snail was performed. In addition, cases were screend for mutations in the EGFR, PIK3C, B-RAF, K-RAS, and N-RAS genes. Results: EGF-receptor family members as well as E-Cadherin and snail are important for defining the tumor phenotype by determining epithelial-mesenchymal transition of synovial sarcomas. Activation oft the mTOR pathway is seen in a significant number of cases. Mutations of the genes studied are an overall rare event in synovial sarcomas and other types of sarcomas studied. Conclusion: EGF-R expression is found in many synovial sarcomas, however, mutations of EGFR or downstream molecules appear to be rare. Activation of mTOR pathway is frequently seen in synovial sarcomas. The benefit of targeted therapy against these genes in synovial sarcomas remains to be determined.",

We evaluated the collagen V (COL V) and collagen XI (COL XI) influence in the differentiation of rabbits adipose tissue-derived MSCs in a chondrocyte-like cell phenotype. Method: MSCs isolated of New Zealand rabbits adiposetissue were maintained in culture by 4 weeks. COLV, COLXI and COLV/XI (10 \u03bcg/ml) were added to culture during 72 h. The cells aggregates were stained with Toluidine blue, Alcian blue and Picrosirius. Chondrocyte-like phenotype was confirmed by immunofluorescence to CD34, vimentin and collagens I, II and III. Results: MSCs stimulated with COLV expressed proteoglicans and collagen, when compared with COLXI and COLV/ XI and control. In the presence of COLV, MSCs was capable to increase collagen II expression confirming its chondrocyte-like cell phenotype. In contrast, MSCs cultured with COLXI and COLV/XI express collagen I and III. Conclusion: The data suggest that COLV may facilitate the differentiation of rabbit adipose tissue-derived stem cells into a chondrocyte-like phenotype. Further studies are urged in order to evaluate the influence of COLV in the ability of chondrocytes to remodel osteoarthritic joint surface at ultra structural and molecular levels. Objective: XRCC1 is essential for DNA base excision repair, single strand break repair and nucleotide excision repair. Method: We evaluated XRCC1 immunohistochemically in early stage breast (n=2046), ovarian (n=157), gastric (n= 140), colorectal (n=250) and pancreaticobiliary cancers (n= 240). Pre-clinically, we evaluated a panel of XRCC1 deficient and proficient Chinese hamster ovary and human cancer cell lines. Double strand break repair (DSB) inhibitors targeting ATM (KU55933), DNA-PKcs (NU7441) and ATR (NU6027) were evaluated for synthetic lethality and cisplatin alone or in combination with DSB inhibitors for chemopotentiation. Results: In breast cancer, XRCC1 loss (16 %) was associated with a 2-fold increase in risk of death and metastasis (p< 0.0001). In ovarian cancer, XRCC1 positive tumours (44 %) were more resistant to platinum chemotherapy (p=0.0001). XRCC1 positivity conferred a 2 fold increase of risk of death (p=0.002) and independently associated with poor survival (p= 0.002). Pre-clinically, KU55933, NU7441 and NU6027 were synthetically lethal in XRCC1 deficient compared to proficient cells as evidenced by DSB accumulation, G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. XRCC1 deficient cells were hypersensitive to cisplatin which was enhanced by DSB repair inhibitors compared to in proficient cells. Conclusion: Conclusions: XRCC1 deficiency in human tumours may be suitable for synthetic lethality application and exploited for cisplatin chemotherapy potentiation.",

The prognostic significance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is also frequently reported. However, the prognostic significance of the stromal component in breast cancers, particularly those of high grade, has not been established. Method: In this study, we analyzed surgically resected specimens from 545 patients with breast carcinoma, including 193 high grade tumors, for tumor-stroma ratio, dominant stroma type (collagen (C), fibroblast (F) or lymphocyte (L) dominant type), and central fibrosis on hematoxylin-eosin stained histological sections. We correlated these features with clinical prognosis. Results: Among the 533 specimens examined, 127 (23.3 %) were of C type, 292 (53.6 %) of F type, and 114 (20.9 %) of L type. Central fibrosis was found in 99 tumors (18 %). The dominant stroma type was a significant prognostic factor on univariate and multivariate analyses, together with T classification, nodal status and Bloom-Richardson grade. Tumorstroma ratio and central fibrosis did not predict survival on multivariate analysis. Even in high-grade tumors, relapse-free intervals differed significantly according to dominant stroma type. Conclusion: Conventional hematoxylin-eosin stained tumor slides may contain more prognostic information than previously thought; in particular, the dominant stroma type in invasive breast cancer may potentially be used to predict outcome.",

After implant replacement, histopathologic analysis of fibrous capsules and liquid from seromas in periprosthetic cavities was carry out. Following FDA recommendations, immunohistochemical studies to rule out lymphoma was performed in 85 cases. Results: Fibrous capsules showed synovial metaplasia in all cases. Morphology was practically identical that in real articular synovial cells, and occasionally intracavitary nodules were seen detached from the surface in a process similar to synovial chondromatosis. No cases of lymphoma were seen and no expression of CD30 or ALK markers occurred. A case of pericapsular ductal invasive carcinoma was discovered.

Method: Tissue Micro Arrays (TMA) were constructed by taking 3 tissue-cores from praffin blocks of 402 primary breast carcinomas. Up to 384 cases were analyzable in 7 ISH assays. Scoring was performed by two independent observers without knowledge of the other ISH data according the ASCO-guidelines for HER2-testing. Cases were considered positive when the ratio was \u22652.0. Discordant cases were reviewed and scores were reassigned on consensus of opinion. Concordance and Cohen's kappa score were calculated in relation to FISH, Abbott. Results: In 372 cases analyzable with Abbott HER2 FISH, 12.1 % were HER2-positive. Concordances (kappa-scores) of the 6 other assays were: DAKO FISH 98.1 % (0.90), DAKO duoCISH 97.2 % (10.4 %), Zytovision FISH 99.1 % (0.96), Zytovision duoCISH 99.1 % (0.96), single probe SISH Ventana 98.9 % (0.95), dual probe SISH Ventana 99.4 % (0.97). Conclusion: Conclusion: Concordance of 6 HER2 ISH assays with Abbott FISH were shown to be 97.2 % or higher. In this study, DAKO assays had a lower kappa score with Abbott FISH than Ventana or Zytovision assays.",

Two different assessments of the tumor size (diameter of the largest focus=LD, and combined, aggregate diameter of all the foci=AD) were used in 418 primary invasive breast lesions (91 multiple, 327 unifocal) and compared with the nodal status (CHI-test). The use of combined tumor focus upstaged 23 (25.27 %) patients with multiple tumors (16 upstaged from pT1 to pT2 and 7 from pT2 to pT3). There was no difference in nodal positivity based on pT status between LD and AD. We observed a statistically significant difference in the mean diameter of the largest focus between the unifocal and multifocal group (31,47 vs 39,67 mm) (p=0,0013). Aggregate diameter in multiple breast cancer is not correlated with an increase of axillary metasases and should not be used for staging.",

Lymph node status and tumor size are regarded as important prognostic indicators for disease-free and overall survival in BC. The aim of this study was to investigate prognostic/predictive pathological data in BC that could define a high-risk group to develop CNSM. Method: The authors evaluated 97 female patients with invasive breast carcinoma, not otherwise specified, previously submitted to setorectomy/mastectomy, in order to determine lymph node status, tumor size, histologic grade, estrogen receptor status (ER) and immunoexpression of HER2/neu. Of these cases, 10 patients developed CNSM. Results: The patients who developed CNSM were younger (median age 54.7\u00b18.152 years/p=0.251) and more likely to have T2N2 disease than patients with no CNSM. The presence of encephalic disease was associated with ER (p= 0.031). Lymph node status (p = 0.84), tumor size (p = 0.339), histologic grade (p=0.933), and HER2/neu expression (p=0.31) were not significant risk factors. Conclusion: Although the literature data discriminate that HER2/neu overexpression in BC is related with CNSM, the authors suggests that these lesions can be related to ER too. Efforts to determine other risk factor for development of CNSM may be warranted.",

Method: We study 65 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma to the lymph node diagnosed preoperatively by needle biopsy.

It consists of the molecular quantitation of a tumoral marker (cytokeratin-CK 19 mRNA). Gene hypermethylation is one of the most common mechanisms of inactivation of suppressor genes. RASSF1A gene, is a region frequently hypermethylated in breast cancer. Method: 51 patients with breast cancer were included in the study, and a total of 87 lymph nodes were analysed. Results: 41 %, 33.3 % and 21.6 % of the tumours were of low, intermediate and high-grade, respectively. In 40.8 % of the cases there are not tumoral cells, in contrast to 12.2 %, 4.1 %, 14.3 %, 28.6 % that showed low number of cells/ITC (<250 copies/sample), Micro-(<5000 copies/sample) and Macro-Mtx, respectively. There is a very clear association between RASSF1A hypermethylation and the presence of tumoral cells (p= 0.004), being more frequent in Macro-mtx compared to the rest of groups (P=0.007). RASSF1A hypermethylation is also correlated to unfavorable histologic grade in the tumour (P=0.025) and lymph node involvement at the diagnosis (0.001). Conclusion: The analysis of RASSF1A hypermethylation could provide additional information to OSNA to detect tumoral cells in lymph nodes. The spare tissue material derived from OSNA could be good material to consider new molecular studies. Results: Of these, 15 patients (88,23 %) had palpable tumor at presentation, 12 (70,58 %) with palpable axillary adenopathy. In 10 cases (58,82 %) the tumor diameter was over 2 cm at the time of diagnosis. In 15 cases (88,23 %) the histological type was infiltrative ductal carcinoma, with 13 cases having high grade. Most of the tumors expressed ER and PR and were Her-2 negative (none was triple negative). However, in 11 cases (64,70 %) the ki-67 index was more than 50 %. Conclusion: Young women with breast cancer have been shown to have a poorer prognosis because of the high grade and hormonal status. Our study shows some similar aspects, but the hormonal status is totally different from the dates in the literature, revealing a possible better response to hormonal treatment and a better survival.",

Distribution of IHC and FISH scores, incidence of HER2+ IBC, concordance and level of amplification in discordant cases were analysed. Results: IHC distribution: neg(0) 49.6 %, neg(1+) 27.0 %, equivocal(2+) 11.3 %, pos(3+) 12.1 %. FISH distribution: nonamplified 84.6 %, amplified 13.6 %, equivocal 1.8 % of which in 42.1 % ratio was \u22652.0. 15.0 % IBC were HER2+ and 0.7 % were double-equivocal. 14.4 % of equivocal(2+) were amplified.

Results: Grossly, the specimen showed a 12.5 cm cystic lesion with fibrino-hematic material and multiple pinkish-grey papillary structures, the largest measuring 4 cm.

For this purpose several methods are described, namely: caliper and ultrasonography measurement. The aim of this work was to compare data obtained by caliper and ultrasonography. Method: Twelve female Sprague-Dawley rats with 187.7\u00b1 14.3 g body weight were intraperitoneally injected with MNU (50 mg/Kg) at 50 days of age. Thirty-six weeks after MNU administration forty-one tumors volume was determined by caliper (Vito\u00ae) and ultrasonography (LOGIQP6\u00ae, General Electric Healthcare) measurement. The tumor volume (V) was calculated according to the following formula V=\u03c0.\u3016S_1^2\u3017^.S_2\u204412, being S_(1) and S_2 the tumor diameters (S_(1)<S_(2)). Results: The means tumor caliper and ultrasonography measures were 4.116\u00b15.801 cm3 and 2.578\u00b14.302 cm3, respectively. The ICC for scoring reproducibility was 0.75 (95 % Confidence Interval, 0.57 to 0.86) and Paired-Sample T-Test was significant (p<0.01). Conclusion: Usually mammary tumors in rat are measured by caliper. However, our results showed that there are volume differences between both methods studied. Ultrasonographic method is more accurate and more precise than caliper. Therefore, we recommend the use of ultrasonography to rat tumor evaluation. Objective: There is a significant percentage of patients with breast cancer and HER2 receptor overexpression that do not respond to trastuzumab-directed therapy. The aim of this paper is to study the alterations of one of the HER2 signalling pathways related to trastuzumab response in breast cancer. Method: The study comprised 127 cases of breast carcinoma in different stages of evolution with HER2 overexpression (HercepTest 3+) or gene amplification (FISH). All patients were treated with trastuzumab. The assessment of PTEN and pAkt expression was based on staining intensity and percentage of stained cells. We also determined the molecular alterations in PIK3CA. Results: Our series showed a statistically significant association between a positive expression of PTEN and the absence of PIK3CA mutations with better overall survival from treatment onset with trastuzumab (p=0.022 and p= 0.003, respectively). The association with the expression of pAkt was statistically significant if survival is evaluated from the pathological diagnosis of the tumor (p=0.043), pAkt positive tumors had worse survival. Objective: Expression of mammaglobin A (MG-A) in breast cancer has been reported to be of prognostic value and to be associated to hormone receptor-positivity. MG-A is also useful in the diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. The present study evaluates the differential MG-A expression in two subsets of primary breast cancer (metastasizing vs. non-metastasizing) and in their correspondent metastases. Method: Immunohistochemical analysis of MG-A (clone 304-1A5) was performed in 55 non-metastasizing primary breast tumors and 19 paired primary and metastatic breast cancers. A percentage of 1 % of stained tumor cells was considered positive. The expression of MG-A in the different groups, together with other clinicopathologic factors (grade, size, hormone receptors, HER2, etc.) was analyzed by t-test. Results: Expression of MG-A was significantly higher in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) tumors (p<0.003). A trend was noted for ER + metastasizing primary breast cancers to show a higher expression of MG-A, compared to those nonmetastasizing (p=0.064). No significant differences were noted in the expression of MG-A between metastasizing primary tumors and their correspondent metastases, with a good correlation (p=0.033). Conclusion: These results suggest that MG-A might be of prognostic value in determining a subset of ER + breast cancers prone to progression. Larger series are needed to confirm these observations.",

Method: Blood vessels were assessed in tissue sections from 133 TNCs stained for CD34. Slides were scanned using ScanScope\u00ae XT and analysed with Aperio Image-ScopeTM, Microvascular Density v1 algorithm. Microvessel density (MVD) was assessed in three areas: intratumoural (IT), peripheral tumoural (PP) and peritumoural (PT), and correlated with clinicopathological features and prognosis. Results: The majority of blood vessels were located largely at the peripheral tumoural and peritumoural areas. Tumours with higher total MVD and PT-MVD were significantly associated with the presence of recurrence (p = 0.05; 0.01), distant metastasis (p = 0.01; 0.005), hematogenous metastasis (p= 0.006; 0.01); and shorter overall survival (OS; p= 0.006; 0.01) and disease free interval (DFI; p=0.04; 0.09). High PT-MVD correlated with a higher stage at diagnosis (III and IV; p= 0.02), lymph node (LN) metastasis (p=0.04), basallike phenotype (p = 0.01), high histologic grade (p = 0.05), presence of distant metastasis (p = 0.02), and shorter OS (p =0.01). Conclusion: Blood vessels are mainly located at the peritumoural and peripheral areas in triple negative breast cancers and seem to have a major role in tumour progression by representing means for disease dissemination.",

Three cases compatible with solid NEBC are discussed with an emphasis on identifying features useful in recognition of this tumor type. Results: The patients were 35, 55 and 57 years old women. All patients presented with a palpable mass, two in the right and one in the left breast. Microscopically, infiltrating, solid cohesive nesting pattern with delicate sinusoidal vasculature or peliosis and papillary pattern were observed. The tumor cells were round or polygonal with abundant granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm. The nuclei had hyperchromatic/vesicular or \"salt and pepper\" chromatin. Two cases had ductal carcinoma in situ component. All cases were positive for synaptophysin and chromogranin A in >50 % of tumor cells. While a positive status for estrogen receptor was detected in all cases, progesterone receptor was observed in two cases. None of the tumors displayed HER2 overexpression. Conclusion: Morphological clues suggestive of NEBC must be recognized for immunohistochemical confirmation for appropriate classification of this clinically distinct subtype of invasive breast carcinoma. Objective: Automation of HER2 FISH may improve HER2 gene testing. The aim of our study was to evaluate an automated HER2 FISH assay for assessing the HER2 genomic status. Method: Core biopsies of 100 invasive breast carcinomas were analysed in parallel using the manual PathVysion\u2122 HER-2 DNA Probe Kit and the automated Leica HER2 FISH System for the BOND\u2122 instrument. To assess intermethod agreement, concordance analysis was performed for various numerical and categorical parameters. Results: Carcinomas with all HER2 immunohistochemical scores were included (0+: 20; 1+: 20; 2+: 30; 3+: 30). Using either HER2/CEP 17 ratio >2.2 or \u22652.0 as criterion for HER2 amplification, high levels of concordance were observed between automated and manual FISH (concordance rate 96 %, K coefficient 0.92). High levels of inter-method agreement were also found for HER2 copy number, CEP17 copy number, HER2/CEP17 ratio, the percentage of carcinoma cells with HER2/CEP17 ratio >2.2, and the presence of HER2 genetic heterogeneity, HER2 clusters and CEP17 polyploidy. Conclusion: HER2 testing using automated FISH is feasible on breast carcinoma core biopsies. Automated HER2 FISH using the Leica HER2 FISH System for BOND is an alternative to manual HER2 FISH in evaluating the HER2 status of primary invasive breast carcinomas.",

Kondi-Pafiti * Aretaieio Nosokomeio University, Dept. of Histopathology, Athens, Greece Objective: Myofibroblastoma is a rare, usually solitary, benign spindle cell tumour composed of myofibroblasts. It affects both genders equally. Method: Three cases diagnosed in our laboratory are presented. Results: Two patients were postmenopausal females (53 and 75 years old) and one was male (55 years old). The tumour was 1,6 cm in greatest diameter in the first case, 7 cm in the second and 2 cm in the third. Microscopically, all neoplasms were circumscribed and consisted of uniform, bland spindle cells separated by broad bands of hyalinized collagen. The neoplasmatic cells had abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, oval nuclei and were arranged in fascicles. Cellular atypia was found only in one case and mitoses were scarce. Immunohistochemically, all neoplasms were strongly positive for vimentin, CD34 and Bcl-2, while the expression of desmin and SMA varied. S-100 protein was negative. The neoplasms of the female patients were strongly positive for ER and negative for PgR. The stains for estrogen and androgen receptors were not carried out in the case of the male patient. Conclusion: Differential diagnosis can be complex. Fibromatosis of the breast, nodular fasciitis, myoepithelioma, myofibrosarcoma, solitary fibrous tumor, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour should be excluded based on the histological and immunohistochemical findings. Method: Using light-and transmission electron microscopy fragments of mammary gland tumors, received intraoperative, from 58 patients 26-82 years with infiltrative ductal breast cancer were studied. Results: Most of the mast cells were localized in the areas of infiltrative growth, at a background of lymphohistiocyte infiltration and in peripheral part of the tumor. Intratumourous mast cells were totally degranulated. The mast cells with intact structure at a background of cells and tissue destruction were also in mammary gland. In destructive mast cells the nucleus with electron-dense circle and chain of granules were observed. On transmission electron microscopy their deformations and the decrease of density were revealed. The mast cells were of elongated of rounded shape with large nucleus and invaginations of karyolemma. The nucleus occupies almost completely the cell's area. It has a ring of large but pale granules. Small protuberances were observed on the surface of the cell membrane. Their number decreased in direct proportion to the size of must cells and their remoteness from microvessels. Such protuberances are necessary for mast cells in moving. Destructively changed cells with the signs of swelling, vacuolization and clasmatosis were frequent in breast cancer. Objective: Determination of eligibility of breast cancer patients for treatment with anti-angiogenic drugs has been always considered as a challenge for oncologists. Each mutation in the genes of proliferation phase enhances the angiogenesis of tumor. We aimed to determine the effect of concurrent mutations of HER-2 and TP53 on angiogenesis. Method: 32 Women affected by invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) sporadic breast cancer were included. Immunohistochemical study was performed with HER-2, TP53, Ki-67 and AnnexinV markers. Angiogenesis index was semiquantitatively calculated by MVD-CD34 technique. Statistical associations between parameters were evaluated. Results: Prevalence of HER-2 positive and TP53 positive cases were 21.4 % and 20.0 %, respectively. 6.5 % of patients showed concurrent mutation of these genes. Concurrent mutation led to significant increases in both angiogenesis and proliferation and a significant decrease in apoptosis. There was no statistically significant association between concurrent mutation and tumor grade. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that most of the tissue prognostic factors are poor in concurrent mutation of both genes. Also, our study illustrates that the concurrent mutation correlates with a higher angiogenesis and thus an increased risk of recurrence. We can conclude that in priority setting for administration of anti-angiogenic agents, patients with concurrent mutations are more eligible.",

Method: Here, we are presenting a 60 years old male patient with a 13\u00d78 mm diameter solid mass on left breast retroareolar region. On fine needle aspiration biopsy, there were 'atipical proliferating ductal epitelial groups'. Then, hookwire localization and excision have been performed. Microscopically, there were tubulary and cribriform islands composed of basaloid type cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and myxoid material in the cribriform spaces at the center of the islands. We used immunohistochemical markers such as P 63, S 100, CK 7, CD 117, CK 14 and Smooth Muscle Actin for differential diagnosis. Results: The diagnosis was 'Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma'. The margins of the tumor were positive, so radical mastectomy was performed for treatment.

Method: BCs (n=34), problematic by HER2 staining (1\u22122/ 2+ or NE), and studied by CISH in our institution, and 24 additional consecutive BCs were stained with HER2 and Oracle, and scored separately by three pathologists. Consensus scoring for each IHC method and CISH results were recorded. Descriptive statistics and measurement of the Cohen's Kappa coefficient were performed. Results: The overall agreement between the 2 tests in a 3\u00d73 analysis shows a concordance in 62 % of cases (\u03ba=0.405). Among the cases studied by CISH, equivocal were 26 and 11 cases, for HER2 and Oracle, respectively. Seventeen HER2 equivocal cases were negative with Oracle and CISH. In problematic cases, using CISH as gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for HER2 and Oracle were 100, 20.7, 17.9, 100 and 100, 72.4, 38.5, 100, respectively.

Method: We searched for p53 and Ki67 expression rates of benign and malignant phyllodes tumors in our archival data and correlated them with conventional parameters such as stromal cellularity and mitotic activity rates. 17 benign, 9 malignant phyllodes tumors were reevaluated as regards stromal cellularity (low/moderate and high), mitotic activity (low and high), p53 expression (low, moderate, high), Ki67 expression (low and high) rates. Statistical correlation amongst the whole parameters were searched with Chi-Square test. Results: Stromal cellularity, mitotic rate, p53 and Ki67 expression rates were all closely correlated (p = 0.000-0.001) for benign and malignant histologic subgroups. Ki67 expression was significantly correlated with histologic subgroups, stromal cellularity and mitotic rate (p=0.000-0.001). Similarly P53 expression was correlated with histologic subgroups, stromal cellularity and mitotic rate (p= 0.000-0.002).

After whole slide scanning by Mirax scanner (3DHistech, Budapest) of HE, Ki67 and phh3 stained slides we juxtaposed all three slides in one screen to the found area with maximal ki67 level in tumor and the corresponding area in other slides. Morphometric analysis was performed using the Pannoramic Viewer software (3DHistech, Budapest). For each case we analyzed a total number of tumor cells in1 mm2, number of Ki67 and phh3 positive cells. Results: Mean tumor cells in 1 mm2 of histology slide was 4180+\\\\\u2212251 cells, median -3976 cells, 1185+\\\\\u2212166 (31 %) were positive for Ki67 and 124+\\\\\u221223 (3 %) were in mitosis. There was moderate correlation between cell density and Ki67 r=0,44 (p=0,0032) and phh3 r=0,42 (p=0,0018). Conclusion: By analysis of breast cancer, was established a total tumor cell per mm2 and main proliferative characteristics for invasive ductal carcinoma. Objective: Adenomyoepithelioma of the breast is a very rare benign tumor with biphasic proliferations of epithelial and myoepithelial elements. It is morphologically and immunohistochemically identical to epithelial-myoepithelial cell carcinoma of the salivary gland. The histologic criteria of malignant AME is not well-established because of the rarity of AME. We report a case of malignant adenomyoepithelioma in a 65-year-old woman. Method: On ultrasonography, a well-marginated and lobulated solid mass was found at LIQ of the right breast.. An ultrasono-guided core biopsy was performed. The diagnosis of core biopsy was myoepithelial lesion. She subsequently underwent a wide local excision of the lesion. Results: Microscopically the tumor mass was composed of biphasic patterns which showed formation of tubules lined by an inner layer of ductal epithelial cells surrounded by proliferation of myoepithelial cells that also formed solid nests. But this tumor had foci of infiltrating margins and proliferation of spindle cell components. Also noted are numerous mitotic figures and increased mylepithelial Ki-67 positivity (10-15 % of tumor cells). Conclusion: Breast lesions which have predominently myoepithelial cells can be divided into myoepithelial hyperplasia, adenomyoepithelioma and malignant adenomyoepithelioma. Tavassoli divied AME into tubular, papillary, and solid subtypes. The criteria of malignant AME is not wellestablished but some criterias can apply to make a diagnosis of malignant AME. Objective: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is available for patients with breast carcinoma. However, resistance to chemotherapy is still a main cause of mortality. Method: Differentially expressed genes were identified from previously published studies that examined chemoresistant and chemoresponsive cell lines or patients with breast carcinoma. The expression of 14 selected gene products was assessed in tissue microarray slides comprising 75 post-NACT resection specimens from breast carcinoma patients using immunohistochemistry, and analyzed according to the molecular subtype and Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) grade. Results: Most cases were positive for ABCB1 (97.7 %) and MYC (96.0 %), but negative for TOP2A (100 %). RCB-II cases expressed much higher levels of MUC1 (p=0.011) and CLU (p=0.021) than RCB-III cases. Positive expression for CALR (p=0.002) and LGALS3 (p=0.018) was observed more often in triple negative types than in luminal types, and cytoplasmic CDKN1B expression was observed more often in luminal types (p=0.014). Conclusion: Positive expression of ABCB1 and MYC and negative expression of TOP2A in the residual carcinoma after NACT implies general resistance to NACT. Expression of CALR, LGLAS3 and cytoplasmic CDKN1B may be associated with resistance depending on the subtype. Expression of MUC1 and CLU can be used to predict the RCB grade or response to NACT.",

Carvalho * ICBAS, Dept. of Pathology, Porto, Portugal Objective: The aim is to study the ability of a cell marker panel -ALDH1, CD44 and Ki67to identify breast stem cells in no malignant and ductal carcinoma in situ. Method: Double-color triple-immunohistochemistry -to ALDH1, CD44 and Ki 67 -was done in 169 paraffin embedded tissue specimens from 111 patients arrayed in tissue microarray blocks. Statistical was done using Chisquare probability test: differences were considered significant when p<0.05. Results: Significantly higher immunoreactivity was seen in DCIS than in benign lesions of breast (p<0.01) with used markers. In a total of 169 specimens, CD44+/ALDH1+/ Ki67-cells were identied in 110 cases. The distribution was as follows: DCIS (79/57); fibroadenoma (45/29), Atypical hyperplasia (23/13); other benign lesions ( Objective: Data from in vitro and clinical studies suggest that CaSR expression can be associated with the development of bone metastases. Most probably CaSR stimulates production and secretion of PTHRP via EGFR pathway. The aim of our study was to assess expression of CaSR in the primary breast cancer and correlate it with the risk of bone metastases. Method: We have analysed 170 patients with the breast cancer. Bone metastases were diagnosed in 102 cases, 68 patients died without skeletal involvement (control group). CaSR expression was assessed in primary tumors using tissue microarray (TMA) and immunohistochemical technique (polyclonal antibody Pierce Bio. PA1-37213). To evaluate cytoplasmatic CaSR expression we have used 0-1 point scale in which 1 was defined as uniformly strong or medium staining in more than 50 % of tumor cells. Results: Strong or medium staining in more than 50 % was identified in most studied cases, however it was more predominant in patients diagnosed with bone metastases than in the control group (93,14 % vs 83,82 %), p=0,053. Conclusion: Expression of CaSR is common in primary tumors of patients with disseminated breast cancer irrespectively of the metastatic site. However, the patients with bone involvement have higher rate of expression, that is borderline significant statistically. As a result, a group of patients with very high risk of bone dissemination might be separated.",

Petrov * Rostov Refional Institute, Dept. of Experimental Pathology, Rostov Regional Institute Objective: Bcl2 is an important established prognostic parameter in human breast cancer (BC) and chromosome 17 centromere (CEP17) copy number is proposed to be the same too. We evaluated Bcl2 expression in different BC's molecular subtypes in relation to increased CEP17 level (CEP17>3 per nucleus). Method: Immunohistochemistry for Bcl2 assessment and fluorescence in situ hybridization for detection of CEP17 alterations were used. Statistical analysis was performed with Fisher's exact test. Results: A total of 226 cases of female invasive BC's were analyzed (2010) (2011) . The tumour subtypes were as follows: luminal A (ER/PR+, Her2/neu-, Ki67<14 %) -118; luminal B (ER/PR+, Her2/neu-, Ki67>14 % or ER/PR+, Her2/neu+) -62; Her2/neu+(ER/PR-, Her2/neu+) -24; triple-negative -20. In our study group, Bcl2-cases were preferentially ER-in agreement with previous reports. However, 20,5 % tumours of luminal B subtype were Bcl2-too and all of them had increased CEP17 copy number (p= 0,0011, r\u03c6=0,57). We therefore hypothesized that not only ER had influenced Bcl2 in luminal B BC but CEP17 alterations also. Conclusion: Centromere 17 alterations are associated to bcl2 downregulation in luminal B BC's. The mechanisms responsible for that remain to be established but the underlying cause could be promoter methylation or transcriptional repression.",

Method: We report a case of a 50 year-old female patient with a palpable, well demarcated lump in her left breast, measuring 3,5 cm in its maximal diameter. Surgical excision and axillary lymph node dissection were performed. Results: Histologically, the tumor displayed an infiltrating growth pattern and consisted of spindle cells, that appear to emanate from myoepithelial cells of ductules entrapped in the center of the lesion. Mitotic activity did not exceed 5 mitotic figures/10 HPF. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells revealed positivity for p63, cytokeratin 5/6, cytokeratin 34\u03b2\u039512, smooth muscle actin, CD10 and S100 protein, whereas they were negative for desmin, cytokeratin 7, CD34, HMB45, estrogen, progesterone receptors and Her-2 oncoprotein. Approximatelly 25 % of tumor cells showed nuclear positivity for MIB-1/Ki-67. All axillary lymph nodes were free of metastases. Conclusion: Myoepithelial carcinoma of the breast is a potentially highly aggressive neoplasm and its differential diagnosis is fairly broad, including metaplastic spindle cell carcinoma and a variety of myofibroblastic lesions. Objective: We investigated the differential expression of several biological markers between primary invasive breast carcinomas and their paired lymph node metastasis analyzing separately epithelial and stromal components. Method: Representative samples of 42 IDC and paired compromised lymph nodes were arrayed in a TMA and 15 selected markers: hormonal receptors, HER-1, proliferation (p53, pAKT, pmTOR, TGF\u03b21) , motility (CD9 and CXCR) and basal markers (CK5, CK14, c-kit) were evaluated by IC. Results: In the primary tumor, p53, MIB-1, TGF\u03b21, CD9 and CXCR4 were more expressed in epithelial cells (p< 0.05), while pAKT, pmTOR, c-myc and c-kit showed a similar frequency in both components. Hormone receptors, HER-1/HER-2 and cytokeratins were not expressed in stromal cells. The proliferative biomarkers were concordant in the epithelial component. CD9 frequency was similar but cytoplasmic CXCR4 as opposite to nuclear was predominantly expressed in lymph nodes (p=0.008). Stromal cells from lymph node showed a reduced frequency of CD9 (p= 0.029) and c-myc (p=0.003) when compared to the stromal component of primary tumors. Conclusion: Epithelial CXCR4 expression may facilitate lymph node metastasis whereas the low frequency of cmyc and CD9 in the lymph node stromal component indicated decreased proliferation enhanced motility of stromal cells in this site.",

Whereas hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) expression has been linked to treatment failure and poor prognosis in breast cancer, there is a lack of reports about HIF-1\u03b1 expression in Africans. The aim of this study was to evaluate HIF-1\u03b1 expression in relation to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, angiogenesis, and other tumor characteristics in an African population. Method: In total, we analyzed 192 breast cancers by immunohistochemical staining. We determined microvessel density (MVD), proliferating microvessel density (pMVD), and vascular proliferation index (VPI) in the most vascularized areas as well as expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and other biomarkers using tissue microarrays. Results: Expression of HIF-1\u03b1 (in 128/182 tumors; 70 %) was associated with VEGF expression (p<0.0005), MVD (p =0.037), high tumor grade (p=0.001), high Ki-67 proliferative rate (p<0.0005), and p53 expression (p=0.032). Conclusion: There is a high expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in this series of breast cancer which is strongly associated with VEGF expression and increased MVD. More studies are required to assess the therapeutic implications of HIF-1\u03b1 expression in this population. The patient underwent lumpectomy. The gross specimen had a tan grey firm nodule of 25\u00d715\u00d715 mm. Histological examination revealed a proliferation made of signet ring cell and glandular structures, with islands of goblet cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong positive staining with CK7 and CK20, and a sparse positive staining with synaptophysin and chromogranin.ER, PR and HER2 were negative. The patient underwent appendicectomy with a final diagnosis of breast localization of a primary occult appendiceal GCC. Conclusion: The differential diagnosis between primary carcinoid tumor of the breast and signet ring cell carcinoma metastatic to the breast is often controversial in surgical pathology. Diagnoses need to be made correlating clinical and histological examination in difficult cases in which there is not a diagnosis of carcinoid tumor elsewhere. Their histological appearance may mimic ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast. The distinction is important due to differences in management and prognosis.",

Results: Concordance between CISH and FISH was found in 94,8 % cases, considering FISH as gold standard, sensitivity of CISH was 97.5 % and specificity 94 %.

Method: A 41-year-old woman was referred to the Surgery Department for a palpable mass in her left breast, regarded as a possible fibroadenoma on ultrasonography. Results: Lumpectomy was performed and the macroscopy revealed a tan-white 11 mm diameter lesion, with irregular margins and firm consistency. On light microscopy, a sclerosing lesion, with a stellate arrangement of ducts surrounding a central fibro-collagenous zone was identified. Haphazardly arranged, distorted ducts associated with massive intraductal proliferation, highly suspicious of infiltrative were also present in the center of the lesion. The proliferating ducts showed slit-like, irregular, secondary lumens, several containing central necrosis and a heterogenous cell population. The presence of central necrosis and pseudoinvasion were, however, worrisome. Immunohistochemistry for p63 demonstrated the presence of myoepithelial cells surrounding all the areas with pseudoinfiltrating features, while CK 5/6 displayed a heterogenous, mosaic-like positivity, characteristic for usual ductal hyperplasia (UDH). Conclusion: Because pseudoinvasion in benign RS can easily be misinterpreted as invasive carcinoma, immunohistochemistry is mandatory to establish the presence of myoepithelial cells. Although rare, central necrosis may occur in UDH and should not be used as a single diagnostic criterion of malignancy.",

Results: The most often sign of phenotype heterogenity found is hormone receptors expression or overexpression of HER-2/neu gene. Often we see two morphologically different tumor populations coexisting. The most interesting cases from our practice are on the poster. Conclusion: As for now, studies about the origin of heterogenity inside the same leasions, did not find a single theory to resolve it. A possible answer gives the theory of tumor stem cells and the model of clonal evolution.

A small tumor contingent presented squamoid features. IHC stains showed the following profile: CK7+, AR+, GCDFP-15+, ER-, PR-, p63/HMWCK + (focal/zonal). A diagnosis of high-grade infiltrating apocrine carcinoma with squamous differentiation was established. Conclusion: There are only a few cases of apocrine carcinoma on record and our case is even more special because of his peculiar aspect, the squamous differentiation.",

N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) is a commonly used carcinogen to induce mammary carcinomas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of Treadmill exercise in the development (number and weight) of female rat mammary tumors. Method: In this experimental protocol were used 21 female Sprague-Dawley rats. MNU was intraperitoneally administered at 50 days of age in a dose of 50 mg/Kg. Animals were randomly divided in two groups: sedentary (n=11) and exercised (n=10). The exercise program was started after carcinogen administration. Animals were exercised in a Treadmill Control LE8710\u00ae after an initial period of familiarization. Thirty-six weeks after MNU administration animals were sacrificed and tumors were counted and weighted. Results: Sedentary and exercised group presented 25 and 20 tumors, respectively. Pearson Chi-Square value was not significant (p>0.05). The mean tumors weight of sedentary group (5.34\u00b110.58 g) was lower than exercised group (8.64 \u00b113.01 g). The difference between groups was not significant (p>0.05). Conclusion: We observed that exercised group showed minor number of tumors, however the lesions presented higher volume. Future morphological and biochemical analysis of tumors will allow a better understanding of the relation between mammary cancer and physical exercise. Objective: Primary non-Hodgkin's lymphomas is an uncommon disease representing approximately 0.15 % of all reported malignant mammary neoplasms. Clinically they are mainly observed as solitary lesions but may also be seen as multiple foci. Herein, we present a very rare case with the diagnosis of multifocal malignant lymphoma of the breast with a detailed clinicopathologic evaluation. Method: A 56-year-old-female patient with a right palpable breast lump admitted to the hospital. Mammography and ultrasonography findings showed 2 different foci of hypoechoic solid mass forming lesion in the right breast. Excisional biopsy has been performed. Results: In the histopathological evaluation, both lesions demonstrated diffuse infiltration of mammarian tissue with foci of necrosis; mitotically active tumor cells with large nucleus and prominent nucleoli. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed diffuse and strong LCA, CD20, CD43, focal CD68 positivity while pancytokeratin, EMA, CD34, SMA were negative. The case was diagnosed as Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma. Conclusion: Breast is an uncommon site for primary malignant lymphomas. We report a very rare case with a diagnosis of multifocal primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the breast.",

We wanted to emphasize to clinician and pathologist to be more alert on distinction of granulomatous mastitis and malignancy. Objective: Triple-negative-breast-cancer (TNBC) that accounts for 10-20 % of all breast carcinomas is defined by the lack of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2 expression with agressive clinical behavior. TNBC is categorized into basal like subtype which is characterized by the expression of basal cell markers and normal breast subtypes. Method: We studied on 41 immunohistochemically TNBC patients to determine EGFR, Cytokeratine5/6 (CK5/6), p53, Ki67, GCDFP15 expression patterns by immunohistochemistry, HER2/Chromosome 17 gene status by FISH. Results: Most of the tumors (90,2 %) were invasive ductal carcinomas. p53, Ki67, GCDFP15 mean positivity rates were 55,6 %; 51,7 %; 3,2 % respectively. GCDFP15 positivity was noted in 8 cases of which 6 were CK5/6(\u2212). The cut-off value for CK5/6 positivity was 5 %. EGFR immunoreactivity was grouped into 0, 1+ as negative; 2+, 3+ as positive categories. CK5/6 was positive in 56,1 %, EGFR was positive in 51,2 % of the patients. The relation between CK5/6 and EGFR expression was statistically significant (p <0.01). HER2 FISH was negative in all cases. Conclusion: As a result GCDFP15 alone is not a useful marker to detect the metastasis of basaloid type breast cancers. CK5/6 and EGFR coexpression can be used to diagnose basaloid tumors with 5 % cut-off value. Objective: Lobular neoplasia (LNs) of the breast include atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). Because LNs do not present typical clinical or radiologic findings, the diagnosis is incidental. Many reports suggest that LN is not only a risk factor of invasive lobular carcinoma but also is as a precursor. It is important to know about the incidence of LNs and associated disease in Korea. Method: A total 1551 cases of breast biopsy or excision from five major hospitals in Daegu were reviewed independently by 5 pathologists of the Daegu Breast Pathology Study Group. The incidence of ALH and LCIS, associated disease, the presence of microcalcification and necrosis were reviewed. All suspected cases of LNs were confirmed on E-cadherin immunohistochemical staining. Results: Only 46 cases out of 1551 cases (2.9 %) revealed LNs. Associated disease were 17cases of invasive ductal carcinoma, 10cases of in situ ductal carcinoma, 6 cases of invasive lobular carcinoma, 5 cases o f other benign disease, and 3 cases of florid ductal hyperplasia or columnar cell change.",

In this study we present the results of the SISH technique used in our laboratory in the last 4 years. Method: We analyzed 398 cases of invasive breast carcinoma, including 41 core biopsies, which were previously characterized immunohistochemically (CB11) as equivocal on a protein level (HER2 2+). All cases were evaluated by bright-field SISH using the automated Ventana Benchmark XT machine. Evaluation was independently performed by two pathologists (FP, GB) based upon the algorithms of the manufacturers and ASCO/CAP guidelines. Results: Out of 398 cases the HER2 gene was amplified in 82 cases (20.6 %), while in 302 cases (75.9 %) there was no gene amplification. Fourteen of the cases (3.5 %) were characterized as equivocal. The concordance between the two pathologists was high (97.6 %). Conclusion: The SISH method is new, fully automated and very rapid. Furthermore the bright-field SISH signal does not decay and can be visualized by any standard bright-field microscope even after long periods of time, making it particularly suitable for routine application in surgical pathology. Objective: Breast fibromatosis (BF) represents 0.2 % of breast tumours that simulate carcinoma. The aim of this study is to characterize the cases of BF diagnosed in our institution. Method: BF cases diagnosed from 1999 to 2009 were evaluated with clinicopathological and immunohistochemical parameters. We also studied mutations in exon 3 of the gene for \u03b2-catenin in 4 cases. Ultrastructural study (US) was performed in 1 case. Results: There were 5 women between 33 and 69 years old. Radiologically they showed deeply located hypoechoic irregular lesions. Size ranged between 1 and 23 cm. Histologically they were characterized by an ill-defined spindle cell proliferation without epithelial elements or atypia. Immunohistochemical study was negative for AE1/AE3, CK5/ 6, P63, CD34 and BCL2. Actin was diffusely positive in 4/ 5, and S100 and Desmin focally positive in 4/5. \u03b2-catenin showed cytoplasmic(5/5) and nuclear(1/5) expression. The US showed double smooth muscle and myofibroblastic differentiation. Three patients showed mutations in exon 3 of the \u03b2-catenin gene (2 with substitution at codon 41 (T41A) and 1 deletion of 33 base pairs (A43_E65del)). Conclusion: Focal desmin expression and US suggest smooth muscle differentiation in some BF. All cases showed cytoplasmatic positivity for \u03b2-catenin but nuclear expression was seen in only 20 % of cases. 75 % of the valuable cases showed genetic alterations of \u03b2-catenin. Objective: Breast cancer is a heterogenous disease consisting of distinct entities characterized by different gene expression patterns. Gene expression profiling of breast cancer revealed 4 major subtypes, including hormone receptor (HR) positive luminal A and B, HER-2 positive and basallike breast cancer. Most of the basal-like carcinomas are triple negative (HR and HER-2 negative). As most triple negative breast cancers express EGFR, mutations in the signal transducing cascade of RAS/RAF/MAP kinase might play a role in tumor progression. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of KRAS and BRAF V600 mutations in triple negative breast carcinomas. Method: Total genomic DNA was obtained from 37 formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded, triple negative breast tumors. KRAS was analyzed by pyrosequencing of codon 12, 13, 61. BRAF (exon 15, V600) mutations were analyzed with AutoGenomics INFINITI BRAF assay on the Autogenomics INFINITI analyzer.",

Method: Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue specimens from 105 patients with primary breast cancer were studied. Tumor-free tissue materials were selected. Tissue processing and immunohistochemical staining with D2-40 and CD34 antibody was performed in accordance to standard laboratory protocols. Quantitative evaluation of the lymphatic and pre-lymphatic system was performed. The Kruskal -Wallies test was used to compare differences between the median values of the studied variables. Statistical significance of the differences was considered if p<0.05. Results: The pre-lymphatic network was found to be significantly more dense in menstruating, compared to menopausal women K-W=61.04; p<0.0001 n=105.

The purpose of this study is to select the proper patients candidate to in situ hybridization, with an indeterminate Her2 score. Method: A retrospective analysis of 163 cases with invasive breast carcinoma were evaluated for Her2 status using immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. \u0130mmunohistochemistry of cases that had been previously evaluated by nine different pathologists in our department, were reviewed by two experienced pathologists. Interpretation of the immunohistochemistry results was made without knowing the first results. Results: Compared to the first evaluation; cases with score 0, 1+ and 3+correlated with the review of immunhistochemistry and none of score 0 and 1+ tumors were positive with in situ hybridization. Gene amplification was detected in 43 cases; 23 of them with 2+score. Three of 3+ tumors and 106 of 2+ cases were negative with in situ hybridization. Discordance was detected in 21 cases in 2+ score; 17 of them were reclassified as negative and 4 were technically unsatisfactory. Conclusion: Using a different cut-off value for indeterminate Her2 results and training of pathologists to minimaze the interpretational differences, will maximize the accuracy, while not submitting to unnecessary molecular tests. Objective: The excision repair cross-complementation 1 (ERCC1) enzyme plays an essential role in the nucleotide excision repair pathway and is associated with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy in different types of cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinicopathological significance of ERCC1 expression in breast cancer patients. Method: We used immunohistochemical to analyze ERCC1 expression in a tissue microarray from 135 breast carcinomas. ERCC1 expression analysis was available for 109 cases and was correlated with clinicopathologic factors and outcome data. Results: ERCC1-positive was observed in 58 (53.2 %) cases and was correlated with smaller tumor size (P= 0.007) and with positivity for estrogen receptor (P=0.040). ERCC1 expression did not correlate with overall and disease-free survival rates. The majority (72.7 %) of special histological types of invasive breast carcinomas was positive for ERCC1 compared to invasive ductal carcinomas (ERCC1-positive in 51.1 % of the cases). Similarly, triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) were more frequently negative for ERCC1 (61.5 % of the cases) compared to the non-TNBC (41.5 %). Conclusion: ERCC1 expression correlated significantly with favorable prognostic factors, such as smaller tumor size and ER-positivity, suggesting a possible role for ERCC1 as a predictive and/or prognostic marker in breast cancer.",

Method: Twenty consecutive cases of pure ILN and 9 DCIS were studied. New sections were cut and stained for E-Cadherin and CD10. Results: One out of the 20 cases showed foci of invasive lobular carcinoma in the new cut sections. All 20 ILN cases showed increased proliferation of CD10 positive basal cells, varying from a focal mild increase to a marked proliferation surrounding or mingling with the lobular cells. CD10 positive cell proliferation was least observed in a case of ILN with central necrosis and in foci of ILN seen adjacent to the invasive carcinoma. The invasive tumour cells were CD10 negative. All cases of DCIS had a thin layer of CD10 positive myoepithelial cells, that was incomplete or absent in some foci. Conclusion: Our findings confirm the presence of a unique relationship between excess proliferation of CD10 positive basal cells and ILN; an association which is not seen in DCIS or invasive carcinoma. This is particularly interesting as recent evidence indicates that CD10 is involved in the regulation of mammary stem and 'sphere forming' cells. Objective: Primary neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) of the breast are defined by the WHO classification as a group of neoplasms that express neuroendocrine markers in more than 50 % of the cells. These tumors can exhibit different morphologic appearances including solid, nested or alveolar pattern, papillary or mucinous differentiation or conventional ductal structures. The aim of this study is to identify histomorphological features useful in the recognition of this tumors. Method: 160 invasive breast carcinomas were reviewed, none of them previously typified as NEC. 154 were ductal carcinomas (26 grade I, 61 grade II and 66 grade III) and 6 lobullilar carcinomas. In all cases immunohistochemical staining for the neuroendocrine marker synaptophysin was performed. Results: Eight of the 160 cases showed intense immunoreactivity for synaptophysin. All of them were predominantly composed of solid, confluent nests and cords of cells with medium-to high grade nuclear atypia. Two cases showed intense desmoplastic or sclerotic stromal response. A colloid component was identified in another two cases. Conclusion: Due to its morphologic variability, mammary NEC is frequently underrecognized. A predominantly solid pattern of confluent nests and trabeculae associated with a prominent sclerotic stromal response or colloid differentiation should prompt to perform additional immunohistochemical staining in order to exclude neuroendocrine differentiation. Objective: Association between centrosome abnormalities and response to chemotherapy has not been fully elucidated in breast carcinomas (BC). Here we analysed the association between Aurora kinase A (AURKA) and Gamma-tubulin (GT) and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (PST) in patients treated with BC. Method: The immunohistochemical expression of AURKA and GT was analysed in 44 core biopsies of BCs taken before administration of PST. AURKA expression was analysed using a modified Allred-like scoring system (intensity and percentage of staining combined). Cells containing one or two centrosomes as determined by GT were considered negative, whereas cells containing more than two centrosomes were regarded as positive. Centrosome amplification was graded in each specimen as follows: negative (0-2 % of cells); weak (2-10 %); moderate (11-20 %); and strong (21 %<). Pathological response rates were assessed using Chevallier's classification. Results: Centrosome amplification was significantly higher in patients achieving complete response when compared with the cases where partial remission or no response was defined (p=0.03), whereas we found no significant correlation between the expression of AURKA protein and response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p=0.24). Conclusion: BCs showing centrosomal amplification as determined by GT present higher response rates to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but need further validation.",

Rarely is presented without overt hematological disease. The breast is an uncommon site of localization. Method: We report a case of breast GS with aleukemic presentation, condition that is extremely rare and requires a high index of suspicion for diagnosis. A 46 year old woman, presented with a solitary, non-tender, palpable left breast mass. A lumpectomy was done. Results: Histopathology revealed breast parenchyma diffuse infiltration, in a targetoid pattern, by immature small cells intermingled with eosinophils. Lobular carcinoma and lymphoma were considered in differential diagnosis. The myeloid origin of the neoplasm was established by immunohistochemical analysis that revealed LCA, MPO, CD34, HLADR, CD68 (Kp1) positivity. There was no evidence of leukemia in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. The patient was treated as AML with systemic chemotherapy and 5 months after the diagnosis she is without evidence of disease. Conclusion: Breast GS is a challenging situation both for pathologists and hematologists. Available evidence strongly favors the application of systemic chemotherapy despite the appeared localized nature of the disease. Method: Paraffin blocks of tumor tissue of 152 breast cancer cases collected at our Cancer Centre for 3 years. The immunohistochemical study was performed by standard techniques using following antibodies (Dako): ER, PR, HER-2, EGFR, CK5/6, CK17, Ki67. Results: All cases were classified into the 5 subtypes: luminal A (n = 91; 59.8 %); luminal B (n =13; 8.6 %); HER-2-positive (n=19; 12.5 %); basal (n=19; 12.5 %); 5negative (n=10; 6.6 %). Conclusion: Luminal breast cancer phenotype predominates in our collection, predictive/prognostic value of molecular genetic subtypes is planned to be investigated.

These cysts are benign with very few demonstrating malignant transformation. Method: We report a case of proliferating trichilemmal cyst of the breast with atypical cytology which prompted excisional biopsy. Cytological assessment was useful in this case as it indicated excisional biopsy rather than a more extensive excision. Results: Smears produced from the FNA showed sheets of atypical epithelial cells with foamy histiocytes, multinucleate cells and fibrotic material with evidence suggestive of fat necrosis. A cell block was acellular. A specific diagnosis was not made. An excision specimen was advised and a proliferating trichilemmal cyst was demonstrated. Objective: A large clinical value has determination of molecular subtype of breast cancer (BC). To clarify morphological and molecular biological similarities and differences between BC depending on age, we compared features between tumors of younger and older women. Method: 573 patients with BC are included in research: from 18 till 86 years, among them 254 patients were till 35 years. ER, PR, Her-2/neu, p53, p63, Ki67, CK5/14, p21, Bag1, Mcl1, pS2, VEGFR, Her-1 were analyzed in all cases by immunohistochemistry. Results: The younger patients with BC had higher expression of p53, p63, p21, Bag1, Mcl1, Ki-67, VEGFR, HER-1 (p<0,001) than older patients. There was a basal-like molecular subtype of BC 3-fold more frequent compared with older patients (21,6 % versus 7,2 %; p<0,0001). Threeyears overall survival in patients till 35 years was by 11,5 % and a five-year overall survival was by 15,5 % lower than in patients over 35 years (p<0,001). Objective: Breast HER2 ISH relies on correct enumeration of HER2/CEP 17 signal. However, as with immunohistochemistry, there are technical pitfalls which may render ISH difficult/unreliable to interpret. The UK NEQAS has established a 'technical' ISH module to provide feedback to laboratories using both chromogen and fluorescence based tehcniques. Method: Unstained slides consisting of 4 breast cancer cell lines were distributed. Laboratories were asked to demonstrate HER2 gene amplification using their routine assay, and then return the slides for assessment. Chromogen based methods were assessed around a multi-header microscope with 4 assessors scoring each slides, whilst the fluorescent ISH method was assessed by a single individual. Assessors scored the 'readability' of each slide, without counting the probes, and provided feedback where the hybridisation technique could hinder interpretation. Results: CISH based methods showed acceptable staining in 50 % (N=32) of cases. Staining problems ranged from loss/poor HER2/CEP17 signal, non-specific staining and morphological damage. The FISH pilot assessment showed an acceptable rate of 32 % (n=21), with the low pass rate being attributed to poor preservation/quenching of fluorescence signal.",

Occasionally the tumor can extend to vena cava and the right heart. Method: We present a case of a 45-year-old woman, who was admitted in the emergency room with rapidly evolving exertional dyspnea. Cardiac ultrasonography revealed a \"big mass in the right chambers\". She was submitted to a right atriotomy with resection of part of the tumor, which was sent for intraoperative consultation. Results: Grossly, the tumor was polypoid, firm, with a smooth surface. The frozen section showed a lesion composed of tortuous vessels and in some areas a fibrillar eosinophil extracellular matrix and others with spindle cells. No significant atypic or pleomorphic cells, mitosis or necrosis were observed. The diagnosis was deferred for definitive paraffin sections. In the definitive H&E and with immunohistochemical stains, the case was diagnosed as an intravenous leiomyomatosis, and the diagnosis was confirmed in the hysterectomy specimen. Conclusion: Intravenous leiomyomatosis with cardiac involvement is an extremely rare condition. Clinical information is essential for the correct diagnosis in frozen section.",

Method: This retrospective multicentric study collected 31 explanted cardiac grafts failing \u22651 year posttransplantation. The vasculature of the grafts was assessed from epicardial coronary arteries to myocardial microcirculation. Immunohistochemistry was performed for C4d complement fraction deposition and CD68-positive macrophages in the explanted grafts and previous endomyocardial biopsies. Donor specific antibodies (DSA) were retrospectively assessed using Luminex SA technique. Results: A pure classical coronary atherosclerosis pattern was observed in 6/31 (19 %). A pure pattern of CAV was present in 12/31 (39 %) and a mixed pattern associating CAV and atherosclerosis features in 9/31 (29 %). Interestingly the CAV pure and mixed patterns were associated with vascular inflammation within the arteries and/or the microcirculation with C4d deposits and macrophages (15/21) in the explanted grafts versus nil (0/6) in pure atherosclerosis pattern (p<0.002). Furthermore they were associated with previous AMR episodes on endomyocardial biopsies (11/ 21) and by positive DSA (10/14) versus nil in pure atherosclerosis pattern (p<0.05 and p=0.05, respectively). Conclusion: In failing cardiac grafts CAV lesions are associated with makers of AMR. CAV should be the consequence in coronary arteries of an ongoing AMR process. Results: In our cases increase in fibrous and adipose tissue concordant with age, indicating an age related nature, were detected. Fibrous and fatty tissue infiltration appeared at the age of 35. Fatty infiltration started at the age between 20 and 34 at sinoatrial node. In 4 cases calcification and in 19 cases inflammation was observed. Amyloid accumulation was not present. In 7 cases myocardial infarction not involving CCS was seen. In 1 case fibroelastoma was detected. Conclusion: In Turkish population age related fibrosis and fatty infiltration in CCS appeared at the age of 35 and increased with age. Fatty infiltration in sinoatrial node started at a younger age than that of reported in the literature. In cases whom the cause of death could not be determined we could not detect lethal pathologic features. However we think that examination of the CCS will improve the quality of autopsy diagnosis.",

            "text": "Objective: Recent evidence demonstrates that epicardial adipose tissue, including coronary periadventitial adipose tissue (tunica adiposa), are paracrine sources of bioactive mediators (adipokines, NO, H2S) which may be involved in coronary atherogenesis. Because of the increasing interest for extra-neuronal effects (inflammation, wound healing, lipid and glucose metabolism) of the neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), including in human coronary atherosclerosis in autopsy samples, the aim of the present study is to evaluate the expression of NGF and BDNF and their receptors (TrkA and TrkB, respectively) in cardiosurgery biopsy samples of pericoronary adipose tissue. Method: Immunohistochemistry of NGF, BDNF and their Trk receptors. Results: NGF, BDNF, Trk A and TrkB expression was lower in periadventitial adipose tissue of atherosclerotic coronary arteries as compared to non-affected coronaries. Conclusion: We provide the first evidence for a possible role of neurotrophins in the molecular remodeling of tunica adiposa in human coronary atherosclerosis. This study is dedicated to 103rd Anniversary of Rita Levi-Montalcini, the Nobel laureate for the discovery of NGF. Objective: In normal myocardium, apoptotic myocytes are usually absent, or if affected, with most of 28 positive cells per million. Method: The apoptosis was measured by the TUNEL method in 60 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and myocarditis (MC), and expresed by apoptotic index (AI) in 30 patients within both groups, and to correlated with ejection fraction (EF) and with different morphological stages of these entities. Statistical analisys was performed, and p values \u22640.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: AI in MC cases was 4,23+12,16, and in DCM cases the value was significantly higher 5,41+9,33 (p= 0.005). In the group MC patients, we didn't found statistically significant correlation between AI and different values of EF (p=0.701). The analysis of the value of AI between patients with different morphological stages of MC didn't show statistically significant correlation (p=0.535), as well as in DCM (p=0.312). Conclusion: Apoptosis play a significant role in DCM and MC but its significance in the progression to heart failure has still to be established. Objective: Cardiac lesions following blunt chest trauma are multiple and of various degrees of severity. \"Cardiac Contusion\" is a difficult diagnosis, especially antemortem and if signs of thoracic trauma are not evident on external habitus and on the underlying internal plans of cardiac area. Is the contusion a cause of death per se? Method: The authors present two cases of road accident male victims, aged 43 and 50 year-old, submited to complete postmortem examination with ancillary diagnostic methods. Results: No traumatic lesions or underlying pathology was found at the autopsy. Epicardial and myocardial haemorrhagic foci were histologicaly documented. Toxicology was negative. Conclusion: Cardiac Contusions are caused by one of the following mechanisms: 1) heart compression between bone structures, 2) sudden acceleration-deceleration movements and 3) sudden thoracic/abdominal pressure increase. They may be asymptomatic or lead to rhythm disturbances responsible for unexpected death (10 %) . They seem to be underdiagnosed, thus suspecting the entity \"Contusio Cordis\" is crucial, not only antemortem for correct surveillance and treatment, but also postmortem to adequately establish causality nexus in cases of post-thoracic trauma deaths.",

Our aim was to study engraftment, differentiation of BM-MSCs and its role in myocardial reparation. Method: Acute myocardial ischemia was produced by transient occlusion (total of 20 min) of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and followed by reperfusion. BM-MSCs were isolated, expanded by standard and labeled with PKH26 (Sigma). Cells were CD90 and CD105 positive. 30 days after occlusion during cross-clamping of aorta the cells were administered into the cavity of the left ventricle at the concentration 5\u00d7106 in saline solution. In 1 day, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after transplantation the labeled cells were detected in the cryosections and heart morphometry was performed. Results: BM-MSCs were detected only in the scar tissue and had a fibroblast-like phenotype. They neither differentiated into cardiomyocytes nor into the cells of blood vessels. In 4 weeks after transplantation the scar thickness was higher in the group with cell transplantation (p<0.001). Conclusion: Engrafted BM-MSCs promote myocardial fibrosis only in the scar, but not in the perifocal myocardium, provided strengthening of the scar, remodelling of outflow tract, and improvements the myocardial function.",

Method: Systematic autopsy. Results: Saddle pulmonary thrombosis in 33 cases, in 24 isolated in both the main pulmonary arteries. In all cases the transverse heart diameter was 1,5-2 cm superior to the longitudinal one, the interventricular septum became rectilinear with a right ventricular dilation. The coronary artery anatomy was: critical stenosis through fibroatheromatous plaque of the dominant right coronary artery (RCA, 2), non dominant left coronary artery (LCA, 3); non critical stenosis of RCA (14), LCA (8); absence of stenosis (30). Histological ventricular examination showed hypoxic-ischaemic and/or reperfusion and overload lesions. In all cases, the lungs showed plurifocal occlusive thrombosis of intramural pulmonary arterial (IPA) vessels associated with adjacent infarctual necrosis (49); acute partially haemorrhagic basal oedema (35) and desquamative macrophagic alveolitis (28). Conclusion: In all cases of massive PTE the thrombosis of IPA vessels associated with an adjacent infarction (86 %) is constant.

In this group, septal defects were the most common CHD, frequency being significantly higher than in the group of isolated cardiac anomalies (p=0.012). Comparison of prenatal and postmortem diagnoses (50 cases) showed complete or partial agreement in 36 and 10 cases (72 % and 20 %, respectively) and complete disagreement in 4 cases (8 %). In the latter group, prenatal diagnosis had not been done by a pediatric cardiologist. Conclusion: The high prevalence of CHD in lost pregnancies highlights the importance of systematic fetal autopsy performed by a specialized pediatric pathologist. Objective: The appearance of pathological calcification, which leads to significant changes of vascular wall, which underlie the development of atherosclerotic complications, has a great importance in the morphology of atherosclerosis development. Purpose of the work is the study of pathological biomineralization in heart valves affected by atherosclerosis. Method: The study was conducted on sectional material of mitral and aortic valves obtained during autopsy. The tissue of heart valves was studied by methods of histology, electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy. Results: Macroscopically mitral and aortic valves are thickened, opaque, dull whitish, sometimes with deformity and ulceration. Histology observed the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, fibrous changes, and inflammatory infiltration. According to X-ray phase analysis biominerals in heart valves are represented by apatite crystalline phase. Sizes of crystals have distinct age dependence. The results of infrared spectroscopy revealed absorption bands of carbonate apatite replacement; in all instances they correspond to the type of substitution B (CO3 2-replaces PO4 3-). Conclusion: The study of pathological mineral formations on human heart valves by the range of morphological and physicochemical methods show that they are aggregates of interacting organic and mineral components, their ratio changes with \"maturation\": the organic component decreases and the mineral component, represented by carbonate containing hydroxyapatite doped with chlorine grows while improving, so the process is dynamic.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of oxidative stress in these myocardial injuries. Method: Myocardial injuries and oxidative stress mechanisms were assessed by histopathology and immunohistochemistry and quantified by morphometrical analyses. Results: Myocardial injury was observed in pediatric patients submitted to surgery for CHD with cardiopulmonary bypass, followed by lethal exit. Oxidative stress mechanisms were directly related to these particular types of myocardial injuries. Importantly, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), a marker of lipid peroxidation, is strongly expressed, especially in irreversible myocardial lesions. Although morphologically similar, myocardial injuries observed in patients who evolved with sepsis in the peri-operatory period exhibited a completely different set of oxidative stress mechanisms. Increased concentrations of nitrotyrosine protein adducts were observed in these patients, suggesting that peroxynitrite-mediated protein nitration may be the predominant oxidative stress mechanism found in these situations. Conclusion: The underlying mechanisms of these lesions seem to be related to the development of ischemia or ischemia/reperfusion followed by oxidative stress mechanisms that vary depending on whether sepsis was present. While the exact mechanism is not fully understood, it has been suggested that endogenous catecholamine release could have a role in this process. Objective: A significant decrease of the mean cardiomyocyte DNA content and increased numbers of diploid cardiomyocytes after ventricular unloading was demonstrated, suggesting a numerical increase of cardiomyocytes. The heart harbours several stem cells populations including c-kit (CD 117) + cells and side population cells (SPC), that might proliferate after unloading and generate diploid cardiomyocytes. It was tested, whether there is an increase of ABCG2+ SPC and CD117+ cells after unloading. Method: In paired myocardial samples (before and after LVAD), the number of cells with immunoexpression of ABCG-2, c-kit/CD 117 and MEF-2 was assessed by immunohistochemistry and morphometrically determined. Results: A significant increase of SPC and cells with coexpression of c-kit and MEF-2 after unloading was observed (p=0.001). A significant positive correlation between both SPC and cells with coexpression of c-kit and MEF-2 expression was observed (p=0.007 and 0.01). No correlation was found between the number of SPC and the mean cardiomyocyte DNA content. Conclusion: SPC are significantly increased in the myocardium after ventricular unloading, suggesting a role of stem cell proliferation during \"reverse cardiac remodelling\". These cells might proliferate and commit to different cell lineages such as cardiomyocytes or endothelium, and thus ameliorate cardiac function.",

Histological examination of AAA walls was performed in 1 group. Results: Distribution on genotypes A/A, A/G, G/G was the following: 1 group -42.1 %, 42.1 %, 15.8 %; 2 group -68 %, 24 %, 8 %; 3 group -18.5 %, 45.6 %, 35.9 %.

In adults, the most common tumor metastatic to the orbit are carcinomas, breast carcinoma the most frequent. Less common are the metastases from gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and prostate. Cutaneous malignant melanoma is the most common nonepithelial tumor metastatic to the orbit. Method: Orbital metastatic tumors may occur at any age, but most often between 40 and 70 years of age. Most reported statistics reveal a slight predominance of women, accounted for by the fact that breast carcinoma is causing metastases most frequently. A frequent finding in the cases of metastatic carcinoma is enophthalmos that is associated with scirrhous carcinomas. We present two cases of orbital metastatic tumors in which the primary tumors were a basal cell carcinoma and a cutaneous malignant melanoma. Results: As to the metastasis from a basal cell carcinoma, the primary tumor was located in the external angle of the eyeball and metastasized the external 1/3 of the orbit. In the case of malignant melanoma, the primary tumor was located in the upper lid and invaded the orbital floor and fat. In both patients eyeball enucleation was performed.

The performance of the model was assessed by bootstrap re-sampling. Results: Extravascular matrix patterns, optic nerve invasion, tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes, tumor cytomorphology, nucleolar size and the mitotic count together with initial visual acuity have been found to be the most important predictors, ahead of the traditional TNM stage. The results are provisional but encouraging. Conclusion: There is still need for multidisciplinary approach and multicenter collaboration in an effort to elucidate the uncertainty related to the best management of one of the most traumatising types of cancer.",

They rarely occur in the orbit, accounting for only 1 % of all orbital neoplasms. In most cases the primary presentation is progressive proptosis. Method: A 26-year-old female was first seen for the evaluation of a right orbital mass which has been causing proptosis. Associated symptoms included peripheral vision loss in the right eye, persistent headache with occasional balance problems. A palpable, 3.2 \u00d7 2.5 cm well circumscribed mass with a smooth surface, resting on the inferior orbital wall was completely removed through right anterior orbitotomy. H&E stained histologic sections were studied. In addition, tissue sections were subjected to immunohistochemical stains for CD34, CD99, BCL2, SMA, desmin, EMA and S-100. Results: The mass was composed of spindle cells with very low mitotic activity. Staghorn vascular channels were evident, and in several areas the tumor cells invaded the pseudocapsule. The tumor cells were positive for CD34, CD99 and bcl-2 supporting the histopathologic diagnosis of benign hemangiopericytoma.",

Primary mediastinal liposarcomas are rare accounting for less than 1 % of all mediastinal tumors. Method: We report a retrospective study of 4 cases of mediastinal liposarcoma during an 8-year period. Diagnosis was made on mediastinal biopsy in 2 cases and on resected specimen in the 2 other cases. Results: There were 3 men and a women ranging in age from 28 to 81 years, explored for respiratory symptoms. Radiological findings showed an anterior inhomogeneous mediastinal mass in all cases with extension to left hemithorax in one case. A surgical resection was achieved in only 2 cases but was incomplete. Histopathologically, tumors were classified into 2 well differentiated lipoma-like liposarcoma, one myxoid liposarcoma and one mixed liposarcoma (sclerosing liposarcoma with myxoid liposarcoma). All patients received adjuvant radio or chemotherapy. One of them presented lung metastasis during the follow up and another died from respiratory failure. The two other are still alive. Conclusion: Mediastinal liposarcomas include a heterogeneous group of bulky tumours, the progression of which depends on the histological type.

Objective: Thymic carcinomas comprise rare malignant epithelial neoplasms, which exhibit a disproportionately large variety of growth patterns. We present three cases of primary thymic carcinomas, including two squamous cell carcinomas and one papillary adenocarcinoma. Method: All three patients were males, aged 51, 61 and 77 years, and presented with mediastinal masses measuring 17 cm, 6.5 cm, 3.7 cm in maximal diameter respectively. Results: Microscopically the first two tumors were poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas, immunohistochemically positive for CD5 and CD117, whereas the third tumor was a papillary adenocarcinoma, positive for CD5 and negative for CD117 and TTF-1. Immunohistochemical features of the tumors were supportive of thymic derivation. Conclusion: Primary thymic carcinomas are rare malignant tumors with clear-cut atypia, largely lack of organotypic features and a very diverse differentiation. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most frequent subtype. They are often a diagnosis of exclusion, since metastases to thymus and anterior mediastinum, mainly from the lung, are far more common. Immunoreactivity to CD5, CD70 and CD117 may support the thymic origin of neoplastic squamous cells. Treatment options include surgical excision, radiation and/ or chemotherapy depending on tumor stage and patient's condition. The prognosis is generally poor with squamous cell carcinomas having a slightly more favorable outcome. Wednesday, 12 September 2012, 09.30 -10.30 Objective: Surgical blood loss can lead to ineffective tissue perfusion of vital organs. Physiologic solution chosen for blood volume replacement may be determinant for preserving renal integrity. Our aim is to study kidney histopathological changes in a hemorrhagic model, followed by intravascular volume replacement with Ringer's lactate or Hydroxyethylstarch (HES) 130/0.4 solutions. Method: Thirty one pigs under general anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil underwent haemorrhage at a volume of 30 ml kg-1, over 20 min. After a waiting period of 20 min, intravascular volume was replaced using HES 130/ 0.4 (G1) and Ringer's lactate (G2). One hour after, pigs were euthanized with IV potassium chloride and sixty two renal samples were taken for histopathological examination, using PAS staining. Renal damage was assessed for glomerular, tubulointerstitial and vascular lesions. Results: Mean arterial pressure reached 40 mmHg after bleeding, and recovered for values above 60 mmHg in both groups after volume replacement. Histopathological lesions observed in G2 were more frequent than those in G1. Conclusion: HES 130/0.4 may reduce the incidence of histopathological lesions secondary to renal hypoperfusion after severe bleeding when compared with Ringer Lactate.",

Objective: EBV related malignancies (skin cancers, lymphomas, Kaposi sarcomas) complicates organ transplantation EBV-associated smooth-muscle tumors are rare. Method: Among 1500 kidney grafted patients, three developed EBV-SMT. Case 1. Female 51 y, with EBV-SMT (Generalized) Case 2. Female 46 y, breast phylodes sarcoma, reviewed diagnosis: EBV-SMT. Case 3. Male 23 year, severe abdominal pain, 2 gut tumor-like nodules were excised suspection of TBC. EBV-SMT was microscopic diagnosis. Results: Progressive weight-loss all 3patients, chronic cough in patient 1, chest X ray multiple pulmonary lesions, on CT-scan paravertebral lesions. Transthoracic biopsy: spindle cells proliferation with mixed cellularity eosinophilic cells intermingled fascicles resembling smooth muscle, mononuclear inflamatory cells and capillarie evoqued myofibroblastic tumor. No mitosis, mild nuclear atypia. Negative immunohistochemestry: CD21, CD34, CD99, EMA, cytokeratin, S100, CD117. Alpha-smooth muscle actin diffusely positive, EVB-LMP negative. In situ hybridization : EBV + nuclei. EBV-SMT was established. Conclusion: SMT in immunocompromised are EBV associated. Primary target of EBV are B lymphocytes, may infect smooth-muscle through receptor for EBV CD21 Mechanisms of EBV related-tumor genesis is integration of EBV-DNA within ALK locus in tumor cells. ALKgene rearrangement and expression; associated with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, anaplastic large-cell lymphomas etc. Clonally of multifocal EBV-SMT using southern blot showed, multiple tumors constitute independent primary lesions. Method: The degree of glomerulosclerosis was scored into 0-3, mesangial proliferation was scored into 0 (absent) and 1 (present), and the degree of crescents was scored into 0-2. Glomerular injury score (GIS) was obtained by adding the above 3 scores and grouped into 3 categories (group 1, score 0-1; group 2, 2-4; group 3, 5-7). Results: Serum creatinine level was significantly increased (1.3\u00b10.4, 1.8\u00b10.9, 2.2\u00b10.8 mg/dL, p=0.007), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was significantly decreased (68.5\u00b117.6, 52.1\u00b122.5, 40 .9\u00b120.4 mL/min, p= 0.001) and proteinuria was significantly increased as GIS increased (1.3\u00b12.7, 1.9\u00b11.6, 4.6\u00b17.1 g/24 h, p=0.030). Interstitial fibrosis of more than 25 % of cortical area increased as GIS increased (2.3, 26.0, and 57.1 %, p<0.001). When a multivarate analysis was done, GIS group 3 was the most important predictive factor of eGFR (p=0.009) and proteinuria (p=0.014). Objective: The aim of the study is to evaluate the histopathological finding and the C4d staining patterns of the patients who were biopsied due to graft dysfunction (GD) after initial well-function within 1 month of deceased donor kidney transplantation (DDKT). Method: Histological analysis and C4d immunostaining were performed 34 on needle core biopsies. Results: Thirty-four patients (mean age: 37\u00b18 years, male: 59 %) were included. Histological analysis revealed acute rejection (AR) (n:7), acute tubular injury (ATI) (n:8), allograft infection (n:1), borderline changes (n:8), normal morphology (n:3), and donor-related changes (n:7). C4d staining was detected in 44 % (15 of 34) biopsies; staining patterns were diffuse (n:5), focal (n:5) and minimal (n:5). Diffuse (n:3) and focal (n:1) C4d positivity accompanied 4 of 7 cases of AR. In remaining 27 patients having non-AR histological picture, diffuse or focal C4d positivity were detected in 2 and 4 cases, respectively. Peritubular capillaritis was detected in 41.1 % (14/34) of biopsies, of which four had C4d diffuse, one had C4d focal positive.

The main executive cell of this process is the fibroblast, by secreting and remodeling the extracellular matrix. The number of fibroblasts is minor in healthy kidney interstitium, but it increases during the process of fibrosis. Their morphology and immunophenotype vary due to different intrinsic and extrinsic factors, thus making their identification and visualization, as well as determination of their origin, very difficult. Method: We performed morphological and immunohistochemical analyses on kidney biopsies with primary glomerulopathy and interstitial fibrosis, using the following antibodies: Vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, S100A4, Cadherin 9 and CD34. Results: Interstitial fibrosis with focal, rather than diffuse distribution, was present in all analyzed cases. The total interstitial fibroblast population was positive for Vimentin, majority of the cells were positive for S100A4, and a smaller proportion of cells were positive for \u03b1-SMA, Cadherin 9 and CD34. Furthermore, different cells in the fibroblastic population showed positivity for different markers.

Method: Relative risks of inflammation and AR in 380 6month biopsies was calculated by Multivariable Poisson regression. Results: AR was seen in 7.3 % (n=28), borderline change in 19.7 % (n=75), and C4d positivity in 2.1 % (n=8) of all biopsies. Total cortical inflammation (ti), present in 32.6 % (n=124) cases, was associated with 7 ml/min/1.73 m2 lower eGFR at 6 months (95 % CI= \u221210.8, \u22123.2). De novo HLA Class 1 was identified in 17.4 % (n=44) and Class 2 DSA in 26.1 % (n=66), with most having MFI values <1000. Increased risk of AR was seen with higher levels of de novo Class 1 (RR 1.49, 95 % CI=1.08, 2.0) or Class 2 DSA (RR 1.34, 95 % CI=1.04, 1.72). Class 2 (but not class 1) DSA was associated with a higher risk of ti (RR 1.40 for ti-score \u22651, 95 % CI=1.13, 1.72) at 6 months. Conclusion: Both ti and AR in 6-month surveillance kidney transplant biopsies are strongly associated with de novo HLA Class 2 DSA.

Objective: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has been used in the treatment of HIV patients producing occasional renal dysfunction and Fanconi Syndrome. Method: A 38-year-old patient was referred with severe acute renal failure and important metabolic acidosis and glycosuria with normoglycemia in urine analysis, altogether with urinary alkaline pH and proteinuria with a protein/ creatinine ratio of 4. He was HIV and B positive diagnosed 17 years earlier. His medication regimen consisted of lopinavir, ritonavir, tenofovir and lamivudine. The patient had a history of nausea, vomiting and some diarrhea with low fluid intake for a week. Besides slight dehydration, the physical examination was unremarkable. Renal ultrasound showed normal kidneys. With adequate fluid restoration, the renal function improved but other metabolic alterations like nephrogenic diabetes remained. Results: Renal biopsy revealed toxic acute tubular necrosis predominantly involving proximal tubules with prominent eosinophilic inclusions within proximal tubular cell cytoplasm, which represented giant, abnormal mitochondria, consistent with tenofovir toxicity. Some histochemichal studies (COX and SDH) were performed. Conclusion: Although prospective clinical trials have demonstrated a low incidence of renal toxicity with tenofovir, there are several such reports in the literature. Current recommendations suggest close monitoring of renal function after initiation of therapy with tenofovir, specially at the beginning and when used in combination with certain antiretroviral agents. Objective: Nutcracker syndrome (NS) is caused by compression of the left renal vein between the aorta and superior mesenteric artery. The main presenting symptom of this rare entity is haematuria, with various degrees of proteinuria. The diagnosis of NS syndrome is primarily by imaging and can sometimes be challenging.",

Results: Renal biopsy showed a normal histology with no immunofluorescence deposits. CT scan revealed dilatation of the distal left renal vein with narrowing between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta. Conclusion: NS is a rare entity causing haematuria. There are few reported cases with histology, although it usually shows no abnormalities. The proposed mechanism for the haematuria is an abnormal communication between the submucosal venous plexus and the calyceal system presumably induced by renal venous hypertension.",

Method: In an international multi-centre trial we assessed the inter-observer and inter-laboratory variability for BK immunohistochemistry. A tissue microarray was constructed comprising 23 specimens representative of the whole analytical spectrum from negative over mild to strong SV40 positive cases. 81 participants at 60 centers stained the TMA slides using local protocols. Participants evaluated their slides following a provisional Banff grading schema. Details regarding local staining protocols and evaluation scores were collected online. Stained slides were returned for centralized panel re-evaluation. Weighted kappa statistics were used to determine the variability. Results: The BK inter-observer reproducibility was substantial (mean kappa 0.64), but inter-laboratory reproducibility was below chance (kappa \u22120.22). Separating components of BK evaluation schema into stain intensity and stain percentage showed no significant improvements in reproducibility. However, collapsing the proposed BK scoring schema into a simple positive/negative call improved BK inter-laboratory variability to 0.77. Conclusion: These results indicate a significant variability between laboratories for detecting the SV40 large-T antigen by immunohistochemistry in paraffin sections. Any proposed grading schema for BK nephropathy, which is dependent on percentage and intensity of nuclear staining, will essentially not be reproducible between laboratories. Objective: Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS) is a rare hereditary inflammatory disorder with three differents phenotypes: familial cold autoinflamatory syndrome, Muckle-Wells syndrome and neonatal-onset multisysten inflamtory disease CAPS results from a mutation of the NLRP3 gene (1q44) coding for cryopyrin, which forms intracellular protein complexes (inflammasomes). Results: Case report: 41 year old women with chronic renal disease stage 3 (creatinin 2,2 mg/dl and proteinuria 180 mg/ 24 h) who developed urticarial episodies since 6 months old related to cold exposure. After 11 years old patient describe associated to these episodios bilateral arthritis (knes, ankles and elbows), conjunctival inflammation, shivers, and asthenia, more frequently in winter and precipitated by cold exposure, air conditioning, stress and menstruati\u00f3n. Aditionaly the patient developed in last years bilateral hypoacusis A kidney biopsy showed a amorphous, acellular and acidophilic material Congo red positive deposits at interstition, arteries and arterioles and less frequent at glomeruli. This material displays apple green birefringence by polarizad light microscopy. Diagnosis: SECONDARY RENAL AMYLOIDOSIS Conclusion: The clinico-Pathologial findings of this case are compatible with Muckle-Wells syndrome. Secondary amyloidosis is a severe complication which occurs in 25 % of Muckle-Wells cases. Amyloidosis is cause by increase of C-protein and A amyloid during the episodies before described and deposition of the A amyloid in differents tissues.",

RCC subtypes on the basis of hematoxylin-eosin staining alone. However, overlapping morphologic features pose some difficulties in making a proper diagnosis. To render an accurate diagnosis, additional methods like immunohistochemichal staining against C-Kit have been recommended. Method: We reviewed 65 cases of RCC diagnosed during 9 years. Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded specimens was available in 65 cases. The expression of C-kit was evaluated using immunohitochemistry. Results: Six cases of 39 clear cell type (15.4 %), 8 of 13 papillary type (61.5 %), and 11 of 11 chromophobe type (100 %) were positive for C-kit that considering Chi-Square test there is significant relevation between RCC's subtypes and C-Kit expression (P: 0.001). From 8 cases with renal vein invasion, 3 showed positive expression of C-Kit (37.5 %) and in 55 cases with no venous invasion, C-kit expression was detected in 22 (38.6), so no significant relation was found between renal vein invasion and C-kit expression. Conclusion: The expression of C-Kit in RCC may have diagnostic significance. Objective: IgG4-RSD shows abundant IgG4-positive plasma cells, diffuse fibrosis, and increased serum IgG4 levels. Although IgG4-RSD typically results in autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), any organ may be involved. Thus, IgG4-RSD TIN often goes unrecognized in the absence of AIP. This is an IgG4-RSD TIN case with mediastinal lymph node and pulmonary involvement. Method: A 73-year-old male presented with rapidly progressive renal failure, hypergammaglobulinemia, hypocomplementemia, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and bilateral pulmonary nodules on CT. Renal and mediastinal lymph node biopsies were performed and IgG4 IHC was done on both after standard techniques. Results: The renal cortex and medulla showed diffuse interstitial fibrosis with tubular atrophy and abundant plasma cells (25 IgG4-positive cells/HPF), numerous lymphocytes and some eosinophils. IF showed IgG, C3, kappa, and lambda granular deposits in tubular basal membranes and Bowmann capsules. Lymph node follicular and paracortical hyperplasia with abundance of mostly IgG4positive plasma cells was seen. An IgG4-RSD diagnosis was rendered and high serum IgG4 levels were demonstrated. Steroid therapy resulted in lymph node and lung nodule reduction. Conclusion: TIN with abundant plasma cells and diffuse interstitial fibrosis, especially if accompanied by hypergammaglobulinemia, hypocomplementemia, or extrarenal involvement, should suggest IgG4-RSD and prompt serum IgG4 level determination and renal IgG4 IHC. Objective: A 39-year-old woman was admitted for chronic renal failure. Clinical examination was normal. Biological explorations showed creatinin clearance around 55 ml/min, tubular proteinuria with Bence Jones \u03ba protein. Serum immunoelectrophoresis identified abnormal monoclonal immunoglobulin G and \u03ba-light chains (LC). Bone marrow histology was normal. Method: Kidney biopsy revealed diffuse intracytoplasmic vacuoles in the proximal tubules resembling osmotic nephrosis. Distal tubules, glomeruli, vessels and interstitial compartment were normal. Immunofluorescence (including anti-\u03ba and -\u03bb staining) was negative. Electronic microscopy (EM) revealed intracytoplasmic immunoglobulinic crystals containing \u03ba LC inside the vacuoles, leading to the diagnosis of Light Chain Proximal Tubulopathy (LCPT). Results: LCPT is a rare complication of dysglobulinemia. It may be associated with crystals within the cytoplasm of proximal, less frequently distal, tubular cells, consisting more frequently in \u03ba LC. Rarely, diffuse tubular vacuolization is present, often indistinguishable from osmotic nephrosis. In our case, there was no proximal tubular dysfunction and immunofluorescence was negative. The first evocated diagnosis by light microscopy was \"osmotic nephrosis\". However, we failed to identify any causal factor. Finally, the diagnosis was performed by immunoEM. Conclusion: In conclusion, before a picture of osmotic nephrosis without obvious cause, EM and immunoEM may be helpful for the diagnosis of LCPT, often revealing a dysglobulinemia.",

Method: In order to evaluate the incidence of OI in renal transplant patients and to identify the location of infection, the respective techniques of diagnosis used and the survival time after infection, we conducted a retrospective study using the Nephrology Department's database on renal transplants. We consulted the registries from 2004 to 2012. Results: We investigated 2041 cases and found 82 cases of OI caused by Herpes virus (n=7), Cytomegalovirus (n=27), Polyomavirus (n=16), Aspergillosis (n=4), Alternaria (n= 2), Mucormycosis (n=1), Candidiasis (n=12), Tuberculosis (n=9), Cryptococcus (n=2) and Pneumocystis (n=2). The lung and urogenital system were the most affected systems. Kidneys were affected in 3 cases respectively by mucormycosis, tuberculosis and cryptococcus. Of all the cases of OI, 39 were diagnosed by the Department of Anatomic Pathology (21 by biopsy; 16 by cytology; 2 by biopsy and cytology). Conclusion: In many cases the diagnosis could only be performed through histologic/cytologic examination. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are necessary to avoid life threatening complications and may greatly improve prognosis.",

Results: Radical nephrectomy was performed. A 5.5\u00d75.0\u00d7 4.0 cm tumor was found, with a heterogeneous brown cut surface, containing areas of necrotic tissue and extensive calcifications. Histopathologic examination disclosed papillary structures covered by small cells with scant cytoplasm, dispersed among mature bone tissue enclosing marrow elements. Epithelial tumor cells were imunorreactive for cytokeratins, CD10 and PAX2, and negative with HMB-45. Hale`s colloidal iron was negative. Trisomy of 3p, 7p and 17p was detected by FISH. A diagnosis of PRCC type 1, Fuhrman grade 2, with extensive osseous metaplasia was rendered. Conclusion: Ossification of renal cell tumors is rare, occurring mostly in clear cell type and the underlying mechanism is unclear.

Markovic-Lipkovski * Inst. for Pathology, Medical Faculty, Belgrade, Serbia Diffuse glomerular and sometimes focal mesangial staining of immune complex depositas (IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, and C1q), also known as \"full-house\" pattern commonly indicates lupus nephritis. However, some non-lupus nephropathy also can be present with a \"full-house\" immunofluorescence pattern, mimicking lupus nephritis. The aim of this study was to define the clinicopathological spectrum of originally non-lupus \"fullhouse\" nephropathy. Biopsies from January 2005 till December 2011 were analyzed in order to identify all renal biopsies cases showing \"full-house\" pattern. The study included 192 \"full-house\" renal biopsy diagnosiss. From all analyzed cases 117 (60 %) had lupus nephritis expressing \"full-house\" pattern and 75 (40 %) cases had non-lupus \"full-house\" nephropathy. In the absence of clinical and/or serological evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), at the time of renal biopsy, in 36 cases diagnose was membranous glomerulonephritis (GN), than 11 mesangioproliferative GN, 9 membranoproliferative GN, 7 IgA nephropathy, 6 rapidly-progressive GN and 6 membranous/membranoproliferative GN cases. Nonlupus \"full-house\" nephropathy is present in broad spectrum of different types of GN, predominantly in cases of membranous GN. The possibility of \"full-house\" nephropathy preceding the emergence of overt SLE remained to be clarified. Objective: Although the renoprotective effects of prostacyclin have been demonstrated in many studies, the protection mechanisms of prostacyclin in chronic kidney disease, especially at the terminal stage, are still remained unclear. In the present study, we performed pathological and pathphysiological analyses of prostacyclin renoprotective effects using a stable prostacyclin analogue, beraprost sodium, in the disease kidney of anti-GBM glomerulonephritis (GN) rats. Method: Beraprost was administrated from 2 weeks after induction of GN. The condition of renal microvascular network and localization of apoptotic cells were examined using renal vascular corrosion casts, immunostainings and TUNEL-staining. The intracellular apoptotic signaling pathway was analyzed by Western blot and qPCR. Results: In the kidney of beraprost-treated rat, significantly high density of renal microvascular network was maintained, and apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells was suppressed even at the terminal stage of anti-GBM GN. Pathophysiological analyses revealed that transcriptional and post-translational modifications of Bcl2 and XIAP, which were anti-apoptotic proteins in mitochondria dependent apoptotic pathway, were occurred in the kidney of beraprost-treated rat. Conclusion: These results suggested that prostacyclin protects renal vascular network by inhibiting mitochondria dependent endothelial apoptosis, and it play an important role for preservation of renal function in the chronic kidney disease. Wednesday, 12 September 2012, 09.30 -10.30 Objective: Although villous adenomas commonly occur in the gastrointestinal tract villous adenomas of the urinary tract, including the bladder, are infrequently encountered. Method: We report a case of urinary bladder villous adenoma in a 72-year-old man. The patient was undergone cystoprostatectomy because of diagnosis infiltrative urothelial carcinoma in the transurethral resection of bladder. Results: Histopathological examination of cystoprostatectomy specimen there was no urothelial carcinoma. A 2,5 cm polypoid mass was seen at the dome of the urinary bladder. Histopathology confirmed that this tumor was a villous adenoma with a polypoid growth of the glandular epithelium consisting of small tubular glands, dilated cystic glands or papillary fronds lined by a columnar epithelium. The glandular epithelial cells displayed mild nuclear atypia and nuclear pseudostratification with some mucus cells admixed. The patient was diagnosed with a rare case of villous adenoma of the bladder. Over the past 5 months of follow up, the patient is alive and no metastasis. Conclusion: Patients with isolated villous adenomas in the urinary bladder have an excellent prognosis and surgical resection is curative. However, it is uncertain whether an untreated lesion might eventually develop into an adenocarcinoma. Therefore, close follow up is recommended because of the possibility that this condition might be premalignant.",

It has been reported that Caprin 1 is associated with cell proliferation in various types of cell lineages. Method: We researched whether Caprin 1 might be overexpressed or not in urothelial carcinoma of bladder and its overexpression could be correlated with clinicopathologic parameter (age, sex, invasion). Fifty urothelial carcinoma of bladder (29 infiltrative; 21 non-infiltrative) were stained by immunohistochemically in tissue microarrays. Results: The expression of Caprin 1 was observed in 24infiltrative urotelial carcinoma cases (%82) and 18 non-invasive urothelial carcinoma cases (%85). Age range was 32-85. Eight patients were female, 42patients were male. Conclusion: In the literature Caprin 1 overexpression was reported in different types of tumors including esophageal, stomach, prostate, lung, liver.

Objective: Pseudohyperplastic squamous cell carcinoma of the penis (PSCC) is a low grade tumor with specific clinical and pathological features. This very uncommon tumor occurs in association with lichen sclerosus, the main location is foreskin, and the high degree of differentiation may difficult its discrimination with pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia. Method: A 66-year-old male presented a penis lesion involving glans and foreskin, clinically suspicious of malignancy. Size was 1,6\u00d71,4 cm and a conservative resection was done. Pathological study was performed, and HPV detection with a commercially available kit: PCR amplification and reverse hybridization with probes to 35 HPV types. Results: The lesion showed a non-verrucous well differentiated squamous cell tumor. Upper layers lacked any atypia but infiltrative growth was evident in basal layers, with atypical cells and mitosis. Lichen slerosus changes were evident bordering the tumor. HPV was negative for all types studied. No further treatment was employed and after a 18 months follow-up no recurrence has been observed. Conclusion: PSCC should be taken in mind when handling penis tumors. A correct differentiation from benign lesions and a knowledge of its low grade to avoid overtreatment will benefit patients. Lichen sclerosus and not HPV seems to play a precancerous role.",

Several reports have suggested that encouraging effects can be achieved by combining COX-2 inhibitors with anticancer agents. The goal of this work was to evaluate the effects of sunitinib malate and meloxicam isolated and combined on three human bladder cancer cell lines. Method: T24, 5637 and HT1376 cells were treated with several concentrations of sunitinib malate and meloxicam, as single agents or in combined schedule. Their influence on cell proliferation was determined by MTT method after 72 h of treatment. Control samples were processed in the same way as treated samples but in drug-free medium. Absorbance values of each well were read at 492 nm using an ELISA plate reader. Results: A reduction in cell proliferation rate was observed when all cell lines were treated either with sunitinib malate or meloxicam isolated. Simultaneous exposure to both agents enhances the inhibition of cell proliferation. Statistical significances were obtained when treatment groups were compared with control group. Conclusion: These results suggest a potential clinical application of sunitinib malate in combination with meloxicam on bladder cancer.",

The study of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression from the perspectives of the prognostic and predictive value in prostate cancer has led to inconsistent results, even contradictory. Method: Expression of Bcl-2 was analyzed in 3 groups of prostatic carcinoma: localized, locally advanced and with distant metastases. For histological grading of carcinomas we used Gleason score. Classification of the tumors into prognostic subgroups was made according to NCCN Guidelines. For the immunohistochemical study we used anti-Bcl-2 antibody (clone 174), EnVision system, visualization with diaminobenzidine. The results of immunohistochemical reaction were assessed by evaluating the extent and intensity of immunostaining. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 9.2. Results: 17 of the 59 analyzed cases of prostate carcinomas showed Bcl-2 over-expression: 5,9 % localized carcinomas, 23,5 % locally advanced carcinomas and 70,6 % carcinomas with distant metastases (p<0.001). Although most of the Bcl-2 positive tumors were poorly and moderately differentiated, the correlation between Bcl-2 over-expression and tumor grade did not show statistical significance (p=0,085).

Some variants have prognostic and therapeutic implications. The aim to this study is to assess the pathological features from our series and to compare our results that of the literature. Method: We retrospectively studied 92 patients who were diagnosed histopthologically with urothelial carcinoma using the WHO classification system. Results: The mean age of patients at diagnosis was 60(range, 30-70 years). 86,67 % were male (80 H/12 F). All tumors were classified as urothelial carcinomas: 2,1 % urothelial neoplasm with squamous differentiation,2,1 % with glandular differentiation,2,1 % urothelial tumors nested and 1 % sarcomatoid. In this study most tumors were grade 2 (67 cases) and stage pT1. Conclusion: Adult urothelium has the capacity to undergo several pathways of phenotypic cellular and structural differentiation as a result of the embryological origin of the bladder from the multipotent tissues of the cloacal endoderm and the mesodermal wolffian ducts. The clinical course of bladder cancer varies depending on the histological type of neoplasm, grade and stage of the tumor.

Besides this improvement, whether detection of clinically insignificant cancer detection rates are increased by extended biopsy protocols is not well documented. In the study, we aimed to compare the rates of insignificant cancers found in prostatectomy specimens performed following 6 and 12-core biopsy protocols. Method: Retrospectively, we investigated the low volume/ low grade (LV/LG) prostate cancers in 160 prostatectomy specimens. Tumors volumes were calculated digitally as multiplying total tumor areas by 3 mm for average block thickness, and corrected for tissue shrinkage by multiplying a factor of 1.25. Results: Of the 160 prostatectomies, 54 were performed following sextant technique, and 106 were performed after 12-core protocol. Review of the H&E stained sections revealed 21 insignificant cancers. Number of LV/LG tumors found in 6 and 12-core groups were 3(5.6 %) and 18 (16.9 %), respectively. Conclusion: When compared to sextant technique, detection of LV/LG tumors were significantly raised in prostatectomies performed following 12-core protocol, and this increase points out the need for new approaches in patient management to avoid overtreatment after extended biopsy protocols.",

We report a case of renal PNET in a 52-year-old male with a 6-month history of intermittent hematuria.. He underwent a right radical nephrectomy. Macroscopically, the inferior pole was replaced by a multinodular, grey, glistening tumour measuring 8.7/7/6 cm, with foci of necrosis and hemorrhage. Method: Serial histological sections have been assessed using hematoxylin-eosin and Van Gieson stain and the indirect immunohistochemical analysis for antibodies: MNF 116, VIM, CD56, NSE, MIC2/CD99. Results: Histological examination revealed a uniform population of undifferentiated, small-to medium-sized tumor cells, arranged in alveolar-insular patterns, with round to oval nuclei, small nucleoli, numerous signs of mitosis and scattered apoptosis, geographic zones of necrosis. Dispersed cells showed cytoplasmic vimentin positivity favouring the diagnosis of PNET. Few tumoral cells appeared positive for MNF116. Expression of CD56 was positive in a large number of tumoral cells and an area of the tumour exhibit a milder reaction of positive NSE. MIC2 was positive with moderate staining in almost all tumoral cells. Conclusion: Diagnosis is based on histology and immunohistochemistry but pathological evaluation can be challenging because of the differential diagnosis with other small round cell tumors.",

Glomerular crescents were present in about 30 % of both renal biopsy specimens (18 of 54 and 9 of 27 glomeruli, respectively). Immunohistochemical analysis, immunofluorescence and an electron microscopy (EM) studies were performed. Results: Renal biopsy showed a deposition of an amyloidlike extraneous substance in the mesangium, as well as within the glomerular basement membranes. Congo red staining was negative. The EM examination revealed FGN. Conclusion: FGN must be included in the differential diagnosis of rapidly progressive chronic renal disease. EM confirm the diagnosis of FGN, which suggests a poor outcome. Objective: Urachal carcinomas represent less than 1 % of bladder-related cancers. Most are adenocarcinomas, but urothelial, squamous and small cell carcinomas may occur. There are pathological criteria for assessing an urachal origin. A specific staging system is lacking for these tumors. Method: A mass of the bladder dome was found in two 56 and 58 year-old men. A 76 year-old woman presented an urachal cyst. CT-scan revealed no other tumors and partial cystecomy was performed. Pathological examination showed partially cystic adenocarcinomas, one enteric type G2, and two mucinous type G1. Two tumors extended into the bladder mucosa and one was limited to the urachal cyst. Surgical margins were negative. Immunostainings were positive for CK7, CK20, CDX2, cytoplasmic beta-catenin, and negative for p63. Results: With a follow-up of 1, 6 months and 6 years, all patients are free of disease. Conclusion: No TNM classification exists for urachal carcinomas. Specific staging systems have been proposed by Sheldon, and more recently by the Mayo Clinic. Two cases are Sheldon IIIA/Mayo Clinic II, and one Sheldon II/Mayo Clinic I. Since stage, grade and surgical margins are the main prognostic factors, a clear and relevant staging system is needed for these rare carcinomas. Objective: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with two different histologies must be included in the unclassified group (WHO classification). Whether these cases should be included in this histological subgroup or be considered hybrid RCC is a matter of debate. We report one of such cases in which papillary and chromophobe phenotypes meet. Method: A 5 cm in diameter asymptomatic left renal mass was discovered incidentally in the radiological follow-up of a breast carcinoma diagnosed 12 years before in a 62 yearold woman. Follow-up showed right adrenal gland metastasis. Patient died 12 months later. Results: Grossly, tumor well circumscribed, tan-yellow, with haemorrhagic and necrotic areas. The neoplasm showed two different histologies clearly defined: One showed solid nests of polyhedral cells, with eosinofilic cytoplasm, central and hyperchromatic nuclei, occasional mitosis recapitulating chromophobe RCC. The other component presented a well defined tubulopapillary growth pattern typical of papillary RCC. Focally sarcomatoid transformation, with tumor necrosis and chronic inflammation. By immunohistochemistry, chromophobe and papillary areas retained their specific phenotypes. Conclusion: Hybrid renal carcinomas do exist, but they are most probably hidden in the unclassified group of renal tumors. However, the exact histological context for which a renal neoplasm deserves the name \"hybrid\" remains to be defined. Objective: Renal cell carcinoma with thyroid-like follicular pattern is a rare histological subtype of renal carcinomas that has been very recently described. Method: A 3.3 cm in diameter asymptomatic left renal tumor was discovered during the study of a macroscopic hematuria in a 32 years old man. The lesion was organconfined. Results: Grossly, the tumor was a well circumscribed, solid, brown and homogenous intraparenchymatous nodule. Proliferating cells were arranged in a microfollicular pattern with colloid-like material resembling thyroid adenoma. Cells displayed low grade nuclear features and had eosinophilic cytoplasm. Some areas showed a solid pattern of growth resembling an oncocytoid neoplasm. By inmunohistochemistry, the tumor was negative for thyroglobulin and TTF1, and positive for EMA, CK7, AE1/AE3, and ecadherin.",

Method: Forty-two cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder and 27 cases of urothelial carcinoma with squamous differentiation were investigated. HPV infection was analyzed by both in situ hybridization at the DNA level and immunohistochemistry at the protein level. p16 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Results: Human papillomavirus DNA and protein were not detected in 42 cases of squamous cell carcinoma (0 %, 0/42) or 27 cases of urothelial carcinoma with squamous differentiation (0 %, 0/15). p16 expression was detected in ten cases (31 %, 13/42) of squamous cell carcinoma and nine cases (33 %, 9/27) Method: A review of clinical data from an ADPKD patient with TCC admitted in our hospital and a review of current literature regarding ADPKD and TCC were made. Results: The patient is a 77 year-old woman with chronic renal failure due to ADPKD, on hemodialysis for 2 years. She was admitted with left lumbar pain, hematuria and fever. Radiological exams revealed various complex cysts with dense material that did not enhance with contrast, compatible with hematic cysts in the context of ADPKD. The whole clinical findings suggested cystic infection complicated with sepsis, so nefrectomy was performed. Macroscopic examination of the ressected kidney revealed a white granulous nodular formation with 4.5 cm diameter in the renal pelvis. Histological examination confirmed a highgrade papillary TCC with parenchymal infiltration (pT3) and extense scamous differentiation. Conclusion: The present case illustrates that TCC can occur in ADPKD, despite its rarity. It can be difficult to successfully diagnose TCC on ADPKD based on clinical-radiological findings. Objective: Carcinoid tumor is a very uncommon neoplasm in the kidney. We report the histopathologic and immunohistochemical (IHQ) study of two new cases. Method: Case 1: 48 year-old female with a 4 cm asymptom-atic\u00a8cystic\u00a8mass discovered in a routine exam. The patient underwent tumorectomy. Case 2: 77 year-old female with a 3 cm renal mass who underwent left nephrectomy. Two months later a needle biopsy confirmed carcinoid tumor metastasis in the liver. Both patients currently free of disease. Results: Both tumors showed similar histologic features. Neoplastic cells were grouped in nests, ribbons, and pseudoglands with rosette-like appearance and showed eosinophilic granular cytoplasm and chromatic nuclei. Low mitotic index. IHC: diffuse/intense cytoplasmic staining for CD56, CD57, AE1/AE3, chromogranin and synaptophysin. Conclusion: Primary renal carcinoid tumor is rare in the clinical practice. The histological findings correspond to a well differentiated neoplasm and are similar to carcinoid tumors in other locations, which makes the diagnosis feasible even without previous personal experience. IHC confirms the diagnosis. It usually behaves as a low grade neoplasm, but recurrences and metastases do occur. Only single cases and short series have been published so far. There is no accumulated experience to establish long term prognosis.",

Invasive prostate carcinoma is incidentally detected in up to 20 % of cystoprostatectomy specimens. It is usually well differentiated and shows low propensity for dissemination and local recurrence. Method: Clinical and pathological description of an extremely rare collision tumor composed of LCNEC of the urinary bladder and a high grade acinar prostate carcinoma. Results: A 79-year-old male patient was admitted to the urology department due to severe gross haematuria. Cystoscopy revealed large tumor of the posteriorinferior wall of the UB with involvement of the left uretheral orifice. In the radical cystoprostatectomy specimen LCNEC of the UB, involving bilaterally prostate and spermatic vesicle (pT4a), was diagnosed. Additionally both lobes of the prostate were involved by the acinar prostatic carcinoma (pT2c, Gleason score 5+4=9). Conclusion: High-grade prostate carcinoma may rarely coexist with UB tumors of uncommon histology. Objective: Despite of numerous researches in the field, data regarding immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of androgen receptor (AR) in prostate carcinomas, in terms of prognosis and therapy, are quite controversial. Method: The IHC expression of AR was analyzed on 3 groups, each of 20 primary diagnosed prostate carcinomas: localized, locally advanced and distant metastasized. The anti-AR antibody (clone AR441) was used. For each tumor was determined the percentage of AR-positive nuclei, assigning a staining score (0 to 4). A value of 64 % was considered to be discriminat o r y b e t w e e n t u m o r s w i t h h i g h a n d l o w A R expression. Results: All the analyzed carcinomas showed AR. 54.2 % of tumors had high AR expression and 45.8 % showed low AR expression. 7/19 localized tumors (one tumor vanished during processing), 15/20 locally advanced and 10/20 distant metastasized tumors showed high AR expression (p=0.051). 5/18 well-differentiated, 16 of 23 moderately differentiated and 11/18 poorly differentiated tumors showed high expression of AR (p=0.022). Conclusion: Although not reaching statistical significance, the AR expression tended to correlate with the stage of disease and with the degree of differentiation in terms of an increased expression of AR in advanced, moderately and poorly differentiated tumors. Objective: Prostate lesions with atypical stromal component are rare and poorly characterized in terms of evolution and prognosis. Method: We retrospectively analyzed 3 cases of unusual prostate tumors diagnosed on prostate needle biopsy. The biopsies were performed due to an elevated serum PSA and/ or phenomena of bladder outlet obstruction. For the immunohistochemical (IHC) diagnosis there were used the following antibodies: CK AE1/AE3, PSA, PSMA, vimentin, SMA, ER, Desmin, PgR, CD34. Results: Two of the three patients, one 68 and the other 66 years-old, with serum PSA level of 34 ng/ml and 14.58 ng/ml respectively, were diagnosed with sarcomatoid carcinoma, the former presenting with liver metastases at diagnosis. In evolution, the death of the first patient occurred 3 months after the diagnosis and the second patient refused surgery. The third patient, 75 years-old, with a nodular prostatic mass of 3.3 cm, was clinically suspected to have an unusual malignant prostatic tumor considering that, despite his 7 ng/ml of serum PSA, he presented multiple bone metastases. The histopathological diagnosis was Stromal Tumor of Uncertain Malignant Potential. Conclusion: The prostate lesions with atypical mesenchymal component are rarities in urologic pathology. An accurate diagnosis relies on meticulous pathological examination techniques and supplemented, for rare cases, with other clinical and laboratory data.",

Immunohistochemical expression of bcl-2, bcl-6, MDM-2, p53 and CyclinD1 was quantified in tissue microarrays constructed from PT and corresponding nodal MET. Results: Frequency of MDM-2 positivity increased from PT (17 %) to MET (37 %, p < 0.001). This trend was not significant for bcl-2 (PT: 7 %; MET: 10 %, p=0.4) and bcl-6 (PT: 8 %; MET: 12 %, p=0.08).

This study investigates the assessment of the effects of methylfenidate on Histopathologic and Histomorphometric changes of testes and serum level of gonadotropin in adulthood which produces gametes and has Importance for future generations. Method: In this study 36 adult male mice (Balb/C) were used. After determining the body weight, the animals were divided randomly into two experimental groups of and one control group. The Experimental groups received Ritalin via gavage as follow: The group 1 received 2 mg/kg/day and the group 2 received 10 mg/kg/ day for a period of 40 days. After evaluation of body weight, general anesthesia was used for taking blood samples from the heart in order to measure gonadothropins levels in serum. Then for the purpose of body weighing and measuring of diameter of germinal epithelium the testes were removed and the possibility of any pathologic changes was considered. Results: The results showed that Methylphenidate with different doses could decrease germinal epithelium and also body weight significantly. Besides some significant changes in serum gonadotropins, without any pathological changes were observed. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that Methylphenidate administration in adulthood due to Influence of enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging was characterized as 8\u00d78\u00d77 cm sized welldemarcated left renal middle-superior polar mass with central necrosis and cystic changes. The contralateral kidney was normal. He underwent left radical nephrectomy by thoracoabdominal approach. Gross examination of the specimen revealed yellowish white 9\u00d79\u00d77 cm sized mass, with multifocal necrozis and cystic changes. Histopathology of these resection specimens; scattered spindle cells and foam cells, fine vascular network and necrosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed CD68-positive xanthoma cells. The tumor also stained positive for vimentin, CD34, but negative for cytokeratin, EMA, desmin, SMA and myoD1. A diagnosis of MFH was made. Conclusion: MFH is a primitive mesenchymal tumor with some histiosytic and fibroblastic differentiation Primary renal MFH is an extremely rare lesion. Because this malign mesenchymal tumor is indistinguishable clinically and radiologically from renal cell carcinoma diagnosis and histopathology of this rare lesion are discussed.",

The vast majority occur in the oral cavity and only a few specific extra-oral cases have been reported. We present a case of pulse granulomas in the wall of the urinary bladder, occurring in a 50 year-old gentleman with a concurrent history of diverticulitis and colo-vesical fistula. Pulse granulomas were recently described in the bladder in association with interstitial cystitis, in mesocolonic fat and mesocolonic lymph nodes in association with inflammatory bowel disease and in enterocutaneous and recto-salpingeal fistulas in association with diverticulitis. To our knowledge this is the first case reporting the direct association of the occurrence of bladder pulse granulomas in relation to diverticulitis. Method: The tissue sections were fixed with 10 % buffered formalin and stained with H&E. Results: Histopathological examination revealed several hyaline ring granulomas within the outer muscle layer and serosa of the urinary bladder, together with hyaline ring granulomata within the outer wall of the sigmoid colon associated with diverticula. Conclusion: It is important to differentiate pulse granulomas from parasites, hyaline ring vasculopathy, granulomatous inflammatory disorders and even malignancy. Objective: Micropapillary carcinoma (MPC) is associated with poor prognosis, and may lead to immediate cystectomy irrespective of stage.

Histologic and clinical data including stage and outcome were collected. Results: All groups show male predominance and similar age range. MPC showed the highest rate of nodal metastases (Table 1) . Patients with MPC tumor volume of >50 % showed the highest rate of nodal metastases of all other subgroups. The majority of patients with MPC died, a large percentage from unknown causes. Compared to MPC, SQ showed similar presentation at higher stages and similar survival, but a lower propensity for nodal metastases. In our cohort, GL presented at lower stages, showed slightly better survival, and a lower rate of nodal metastases, when compared to MPC. Our cohort included fewer cases of SmCa and NeCa. However, both patients with NeCa died of disease. Conclusion: MPC, particularly when it represents >50 % of tumor volume, shows higher rate of nodal metastases than remaining subgroups, and is associated with a larger percentage of patient deaths. Objective: M\u00fcllerian-like stroma with ER/PR expression is typical of renal mixed epithelial and stromal tumor and has been described in kidneys with obstructive pathology. WT1 overexpression is not reported in this setting. Method: Immunohistochemical study for ER, PR and WT1 in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (n=5), acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) (n=5), xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XP) (n=5), and renal lithiasis (RL) (n=5). Controls: fetal (<24 w, n=4; >24 w, n= 4) and adult autopsy kidneys (n=5). Results: Stromal ER was found in 100 % of ADPKD, ACKD, XP and RL; PR expression in 100 % of ADPKD, ACKD and RL and 80 % of XP, and nuclear WT1 in 20 % of XP and RL. ER were negative in 100 % of controls. We found PR expression in 100 % of fetal controls of second trimester. WT1 was negative in the stroma of adult controls (100 %). 80 % of fetal controls showed WT1 expression in the peripheral cortex. Conclusion: ER and PR expression is frequent in kidneys with chronic obstructive and inflammatory pathology. WT1 is expressed occasionally. More studies are needed to determine whether these findings are a consequence of renal obstruction or they are involved in its pathogenesis, as well as their potential therapeutic implications.",

Earlier we have shown that MP is associated with shedding of multicellular tumor fragments (MTF) into the circulation and pulmonary metastasis. We hypothesized that VEGF inhibition will destroy MP resulting in less MTF. Method: 8 ccRCC patients were treated for 4 weeks by daily administration of Sorafenib (400 mg bid). Three days after therapy, nephrectomy was performed and kidneys were perfused via the arteria renalis. Venous perfundate was filtered and processed to AgarCytoblocks for MTF. Treatment effects were studied using immunohistochemistry. Results: All tumors were ccRCC as demonstrated by high VEGF-A expression. None of the tumors showed MP after Sorafenib treatment. Tumors showed large areas of necrosis and fibrinoid necrosis of the blood vessels, concomitant with profound perivascular inflammation. 6/8 ccRCC patients (75 %) had MFT vs 33 % in a control group (p= 0.03 Fisher's exact test). Individual tumor cells in the MTFs showed increased mitotic activity. Conclusion: Sorafenib destroys MP in ccRCC, attacks tumor vasculature, causes extensive necrosis and inflammation. Post-treatment MTF are increased in venous perfundate. Care should therefore be taken with neo-adjuvant sorafenib treatment of ccRCC. Objective: Claudins are major transmembrane proteins of tight junctions. As the disruption of their function have important impact on tumorogenesis, invasion and metastasis. Claudins became a focus of interest for targeting therapies. Although their expression profiles have been studied in many organs, researches on Claudin expression in bladder are in limited number. The aim of this study is to present the differential expression of Claudins in invasive urothelial cell carcinoma (IUCC), noninvasive papillary urothelial carcinoma (NPUC), carcinoma in-situ (CIS), papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potentiall (PUNLMP) and control group (CG). Results: 83 cases (31 IUCC -further divided into:15 muscle invasive UCC, 16 UCC with lamina propria invasion-, 17 NPUC, 13 PUNLMP, 7 CIS and 15 CG) were evaluated with Claudin-1, 3, 4. Interestingly, high Claudin-1 and -3 score in CG (100 %, 80 %), decreased significantly in all non-invasive lesions (mean 18 %, 22 %). Claudin-4 expression appeared to decrease in IUCC vs. Others (%52 vs mean %82). Conclusion: Higher expression of Claudin-4 in low-grade and non-invasive lesions may be used as a diagnostic tool. In terms of Claudin-1 and -3, their decreased expression in non-invasive lesions when compared to CG and their trend to show more increased expression in IUCC needs to be studied further in larger studies.",

Conclusion: Although the limited sampling protocol provides statistically significant results, because of critical role of pathological assessment in treatment of prostatic adenocarcinoma, they can be found unsatisfactory for many pathologists. Objective: Initially described in embryonic neuroepithelium, nestin is an intermediate filament involved in cell differentiation and transiently related to vimentin, keratin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In tumoral and vascular proliferation, nestin is recognized in stem/progenitor cells. The octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT-4) is a biomarker of this lineage. Since there are few data concerning the presence of nestin in Leydig cells and testicular tumors, our aim was to investigate a series of Leydig cell hyperplasia and tumors. Method: 31 cases (13 hyperplasia, 14 adenomas, 2 malignant Leydig cell tumors and 2 lymph node metastases) and controls were immunostained with anti-nestin, vimentin, keratin, GFAP and OCT-4 antibodies. Results: Twenty-six (84 %) cases (tumors and hyperplasia) were nestin positive with mostly weak, finely granular cytoplasmic staining. Four (13 %) were negative, 1 (3 %) not interpretable. Vimentin was expressed in twenty-seven (87 %) cases. Seventeen (55 %) were focally keratin positive. Only three (10 %) showed OCT-4 positivity. All were GAFP negative. Conclusion: In Leydig cell hyperplasia, adenomas and malignant tumors nestin and vimentin are expressed frequently, sometimes with keratin. This would be a sign of epithelialmesenchymal transition. Further investigations are needed to understand the relationship with the malignant potential of these tumors.",

According to accepted medical knowledge, this type of tumor isn't linked to cryptorchidism, unlike germ cell tumors of the testicles. Herein, a case of Leydig cell tumor in a cryptorchid testis is described. Method: A 59-year-old, unmarried man was admitted for surgical repair of inguinal hernia. His past medical history included untreated bilateral cryptorchidism first noted in childhood, as well as poliomyelitis that presented at age two. The past surgical history and review of systems were noncontributory. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed two 3\u00d73 cm testicles at the level of the inguinal canal. He underwent bilateral inguinal orchiectomy combined with surgical repair of his inguinal hernia. Results: The right testis contained a solid, well-circumscribed, round, tan-colored tumor 1.5 cm in diameter. The histological appearance was that of a Leydig cell tumor exhibiting no mitotic figure. There was no clinical or radiological evidence of metastatic spread. Conclusion: Although cryptorchidism is considered to be a risk factor for developing germ cell tumors, there have been a few reported cases of Leydig cell tumors with a history of cryptorchidism. Our case adds to the evidence that there may be a link between the two conditions. Objective: CD44, E-cadherin, \u03b2-catenin are \"cell adhesion molecules\" and appear to influence development, inflammation, cancer invasion and metastasis. We studied the expression of these CAMs in prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa), high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and nodular adenomatous hyperplasia (NH). Method: 135 specimens of radical prostatectomies were assessed. These CAMs were determined by immunohistochemistry. All sections included PCa, HGPIN, and NH. The expression of these markers was evaluated with three scores. The correlation of immunopositivity with Gleason score and TNM stage was investigated. Results: CD44 was strongly expressed in 41.5 %, 46.7 % and 37.8 % of NH, HGPIN and PCa, respectively. E-cadherin immunostaining was higly detected in 71.1 %, 78.5 % and 63.0 % of NH, HGPIN and PCa areas while \u03b2-catenin immunostaining was exclusively membranous in 80.7 % of NH and nuclear/cytoplasmic in 70.4 % and 48.9 % of HGPIN and PCa areas. All markers were unrelated to Gleason score (p=0.352). CD44 and E-cadherin immunopositivities were inversely associated with TNM stage (p=0.021 and p=0.042 respectively); such an association was not observed in \u03b2-catenin (p=0.556). Conclusion: CD44 and E-cadherin decreased expression is probably associated with invasive potential of prostate cancer. \u03b2-catenin staining pattern in neoplastic lesions differs from that in non-neoplastic prostate lesions. Results: The loss of ECAD expression was significantly higher at the TIF when comparing with TSCP and NNM. The loss of ECAD was correlated with histological grade, infiltrative pattern, lymph node metastasis, perineural and vascular invasion. The vimentin expression showed association with histological grade, infiltrative pattern, T stage, lymph node metastasis, perineural and vascular invasion. Conclusion: The loss of ECAD and the gain of vimentin expressions occur more frequently at the tumor invasion front and are associated with classic factors of poor prognosis and low survival rates.",

However, it is sometimes difficult to identify an infiltration of chorion or detrusor muscle. Moreover, the evaluation of tumor grade is subjective and not reproducible. Method: Our objective is to study the prognostic value of the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Ki67 antigen, the tumor suppressor gene p53, the protooncogene c-erb B2, the receptor for Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF-R), the apoptosis suppressor gene bcl2, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA). Results: The study showed that the PCNA expression was significantly associated with the early recurrence (p=0.010) and the tumor stage (p=0.003). The Mib1 expression was correlated to the early recurrence (p=0.010), and tumor progression in stage and/or grade (p=0.007). The c-erbB2 expression showed significant association with the tumor grade (p=0.007). The prognostic value of other markers has not been proven. Conclusion: These findings may be useful providing better classification of bladder tumors thus the better management of patients. The c-erbB2 expression contributes to refine the tumor grading. PCNA and Mib1 can predict the early tumor recurrence; they could be relevant for the determination of endoscopic controls rhythms of patients. Objective: Primary urinary bladder neuroendocrine carcinoma (PUBNEC) is a rare tumor characterised by an aggressive behaviour and poor prognosis. Method: We report five cases of PUBNEC diagnosed in the departement pathology of Farhat Hached Hospital between 1990 and 2011. Results: Our population is composed by four mens and a woman. All patient are heavy smokers. The most common presenting symptom is hematuria and dysuria in all cases. One patient presented a complete urinary retention. A cystoscopic examination with transurethral resection was performed in all cases. The pathological examination with use of immunohistochemical markers of neuroendocrine differentiation were consistent with a large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma in four cases and a small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma in a case. A cystoprostatectomy was made in two cases followed by chemotherapy. Conclusion: The clinical presentation of PUBNEC is similar to other bladder cancers and is characterized by advanced stage at diagnosis and rapidly progressive disease. The diagnosis of poses several problems: a vesical metastasis has to be excluded and such lesions have to be differentiated from transitional cell carcinoma, lymphoma, paraganglioma and peripheral nerve neuroblastoma.

Method: It is described a case of ureteral IPT with pathologic and immunohistochemical features of IgG4-related IPT, fibrohistiocytic type. Results: The study case is a 82-year-old female with severe stenosis of the left ureter and hydronephrosis, who underwent to nephroureterectomy and endoscopic resection of multiple lesions in the bladder. The histological examination showed transmural fibrosing inflammatory lesion of the affected ureteral wall, with abundant plasma cells intermixed with many histiocytes, lymphocytes, fibroblasts and scattered eosinophils. The majority of infiltrating plasma cells were positive for IgG4. Bladder lesions showed similar histological features. The diagnosis was IgG4-related IPT, fibrohistiocytic type. Conclusion: IgG4-related IPT of ureter is extremely rare, with only few cases reported in literature. Recognition of this entity is clinically relevant because this type of IPT can be treated with steroid therapy and may be associated with sclerosing autoimmune disease in other organs.",

Method: We report the case of an 88-year-old man who was brought to our hospital due to sudden massive haematuria. Catheterization failed to obtain haemostasis so, a suprapubic incision and direct exploration of the bladder was performed. A large solid tumor was found with a shaggy haemorrhagic surface and biopsies were taken. Results: Histological examination revealed an infiltrating malignant neoplasm composed of variably pleomorphic ovoid neoplastic cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, bizarre tumor giant cells and prominent stromal osteoclastic giant cell reaction. Immunohistochemical examination was negative for cytokeratin, desmin, smooth muscle actin, PSAP, NSE, S100protein and HMB45 whereas it was positive for CD68 in a large number of tumor cells. Accordingly, the diagnosis of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with histological features compatible with giant cell MFH of the urinary bladder was made. The patient died 4 days after the diagnosis. Conclusion: In conclusion, MFH of the bladder should be kept in mind when facing with an undifferentiated malignant tumor.

Ozaydin * Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Dept. of Pathology, Ankara, Turkey Objective: The differential diagnosis of renal tumors can be problematic due to overlapping morphologic features. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential contribution of survivin expression in the differential diagnosis and determination of therapy modalities of these tumors. Method: This study consisted of 15 chromophobe (ChRCC), 15 clear cell (CCRCC) and 9 papillary (PRCC) renal cell carcinomas, and 13 oncocytomas. Sections were stained against survivin antibody. Results: PRCCs and CCRCCs showed diffuse and strong survivin expression. Survivin expression was strikingly prominent in type1 PRCCs and cystic CCRCCs. In CCRCCs, survivin expression was more pronounced in low grade areas than high grade and sarcomatoid areas. In ChRCC, survivin expression was more limited and weaker than that of oncocytomas and other malignant renal tumors. In non-neoplastic renal tissue, survivin expression was more pronounced in podocytes and atrophic tubules than other nephron parts. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that survivin may contribute to the differential diagnosis of renal tumors because of the partially unique staining patterns. It was purposed that knockdown of survivin reduced growth, induce apoptosis and enhance in vitro radiosensitivity of RCC cells. Taken together, to be known different survivin expression patterns in renal tumors may help to determine new therapeutic strategies for RCCs. Objective: There are several tumor-like lesions and miscellaneous neoplasms of rete testis. We present a case with adenomatous hyperplasia of rete testis (AHRT). Method: The patient was 24 years old with undescended testis and referred to our hospital. There was no clinical or endocrin abnormalities. Cryptoorchidism was unilateral and the other testis was normal. Right orciectomy was performed and sent to pathology labarotory for examination. Results: There was no tumoral lesion in gross examination but in microscobic examination there was gland like tubular structures. Some of these were back to back position with little intervening stroma and mild to moderate atypia. EMA and pancytokeratin immunohistochemistry findings with morphology confirmed the diagnosis of AHRT in this case. Conclusion: AHRT is a rare proliferatif lesion and can be confused with malignancy. It is incidentally realised in microscobic investigation. It may present as a very small lesion detected in microscobic examination or solid-cystic mass lesion which is macroscobically evident. Clinic history, localization, histologic features and immunohistochemistry are criterias for differentiating these lesions.We present this case for both surgeons and pathologists with its importance to be confused with malignancy. Objective: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of death in men. The localized disease often responds to conventional therapies like androgen ablation via castration and/or administration of chemical inhibitors but advanced disease resistant to any curative therapies is still challenge for investigators. There are increasing efforts to enhance the possibility of finding positive and sensitive immune markers for diagnosing and treating prostate cancer. Method: We applied immunohistochemical markers; AMACR and iNOS. Formalin-fixed parafin embedded tissues of 64 prostate needle biopsy specimens diagnosed as prostate adenocarcinoma between 2005 and 2010 years were enrolled in the study. Results: AMACR expression has been found in 58 (90.6 %) and iNOS expression in 54 (84.4 %) of 64 prostate adenocarcinomas.No significant relationship of AMACR and iNOS has been obtained (p>0.05). There was no significant correlation of histopathologic grade of the tumors with AMACR and iNOS expression (p>0.05). Conclusion: The expression of AMACR and iNOS might be important diagnostic immune markers for prostate adenocarcinomas especially in needle biopsies when the quantity and quality of tissue are limited.",

Method: IHC for Napsin-A (rabbit polyclonal antibody) was performed in a series of 334 cases of primary and metastatic renal tumors on TMA. Cytoplasmic immunoreactivity was scored: intensity (0-3+) and extent (% of tumor cells: 0-3). The 2 scores were added: positive case: combined IHC score>2; negative if combined score of 2 or less. Objective: The diagnosis of prostatic carcinoma can be challenging on needle core biopsies. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR/P63) antibody cocktail for prostate cancer diagnosis. A prospective analysis of 50 consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens and 50 prostate needle biopsy semples was performed to select histological sections showing foci of minimal prostatic carcinoma, high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and benign mimickers of prostatic carcinoma (atrophy, adenosis). Method: Serial histological sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Van Gieson and immunomarkers: AMACR and P63 using a prediluted antibody cocktail. Results: The cocktail was very useful in highlighting prostatic carcinoma associated with HGPIN (flat or cribriform) and distorted foci of minimal carcinoma. AMACR was positive with moderate and strong staining in almost all cases for which the immunohistochemical result converted the atypical diagnosis to a final cancer diagnosis. The cases whose diagnosis was changed from \"atypical\" to cancer were all highly suspicious for cancer based on HE histology and negative basal cell markers. Conclusion: This cocktail would be of diagnosis utility when limited tissue is available for histopathological evaluation of small diagnostically difficult foci (prostate needle biopsy and surgical specimens).",

The bladder urothelium showed foci of high-grade transitional carcinoma with lamina propria invasion. Conclusion: Initially, SFTs were thought to be of mesothelial origin. Then, these tumors have also been observed in extrapleural and extraserosal sites, which suggests a mesenchymal cell origin. The differential diagnosis should always include other spindle cells lesions such as sarcomatoid carcinoma, leiomyosarcoma and IMT. To date, this is the first reported case of association of urinary bladder SFT and high-grade urothelial invasive carcinoma.",

Mean tumor size: 4,24 cm (range: 1,6-11,5 cm); right kidney: 5, and left: 4 cases. Invasion into the perinephric or renal sinus fat was the most frequent worrisome feature: 7 tumors (77,8 %) and focal chromophobe carcinoma-like areas in 3 cases (33,3 %). Lymphovascular invasion, entrapped renal tubules-glomeruli, necrosis and mitosis were found in 2 (22,2 %) respectively. All but two ROs had at least 2 worrisome features. Followup was available for all cases (median 11 months; range 3-108): all patients were alive without recurrence or metastasis. Conclusion: RO is a tumor which often can show worrisome and atypical morphology.

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of p53 oncoprotein and Ki67 antigen in a series of transitional cell bladder carcinoma with papillary morphology (pTapapillary carcinoma and pT1) with histological grade and recurrence. Method: This study included 59 cases diagnosed with urothelial carcinoma with papillary morphology (pTa, pT1). Immunohistochemical expression of Ki67 and p53 were examined in each case, and were graded accordingly to the percentage of cells stained, in low, moderate and high-expression groups. Results: As described previously in other publications the expression of p53 and Ki67 has a relationship with histological grade. We also noted that of the 13 recurrences, 11 were associated with moderate to high expression of either p53 or Ki67, or both. Conclusion: We concluded that p53 and Ki67 expression combined with histological grade and pathological stage may be helpful in assessing more accurately the biological behaviour of urothelial carcinoma. And the overexpression of p53 and Ki67 are related with an unfavourable prognosis. Objective: Prostatic stromal hyperplasia with atypia is a rare lesion with fewer than 200 cases reported worldwide. It can be mistaken for sarcoma because of the presence of atypical, bizarre cells. Its malignant potential is uncertain. The follow up study of every case is important. Method: A 71-year-old man with previously diagnosed atypical prostatic adenostromal hyperplasia with atypia of stromal cells was hospitalized with urinary obstruction after transurethral resection of prostate made 6 years ago. Repeat TURP was performed and tissue specimens were investigated and compared with the initial biopsy. Results: The second biopsy showed the benign hyperplastic prostatic glands with atypical, bizarre, frequently multinucleated giant stromal cells between them. They displayed intense immunoreactivity for actin, vimentin and androgen receptors. The microscopical picture was identical to that seen in the first specimens. The nuclear abnormalities looked like in an atypical symplastic leiomyoma of myometrium. No evidence of sarcomatous or carcinomatous transformation, mitotic index evaluation was noted. Conclusion: This case maintains the viewpoint that the prostatic adenostromal hyperplasia with stromal cell atypia is a benign lesion. But it can recur and requires the repeat TURP or radical surgery.",

The tumor was composed of the characteristic for seminoma homogenous, clear cells arranged in nests and islands separated by septa and infiltrated by lymphocytes. Immunohistochemically the tumor cells were positive for PLAP, OCT3/4, CD117 and D2-40 and negative for CD30 and CK8.18. There was also a regular pattern of tubular structures infiltrated by the seminoma cells while retaining a low columnar type epithelium.

The tubular structures were positive for CK8.18 and negative for AFP, glypican-3 and OCT3/4. Conclusion: The presence of tubular structures with sphaerical eosinophilic globules creates a suspicion for a yolk sac tumor component. The absence of AFP and glypican-3 expression, the regular pattern of the tubular structures and their continuity with rete testis excluded this suspicion. Hyaline eosinophilic globules in rete testis should not be confused with the globules produced by yolk sac tumors.",

Nuclear beta-catenin protein has been detected by immunohistochemistry in a higher proportion of WTs, thus suggesting alternative genetic pathways leading to beta-catenin activation in these neoplasms. Method: Sixteen renal WTs and 7 secondary WT localizations were retrospectively investigated. The series included 17 paediatric patients, 10 females and 7 males, with a mean age of 4.5 years and a 34 year-old female patient. Immunohistochemical analysis of beta-catenin was performed and findings were reported for each neoplastic component (i.e. epithelium, stroma and blastema). Tumour DNA was extracted for direct sequencing analysis. Results: The majority of WTs showed moderate to strong membranous staining for beta-catenin in the epithelial (76.5 %) and the blastemal (60 %) components. Nuclear betacatenin expression was observed in combination with cytoplasmic staining in the mesenchyma and/or the blastema of two primary renal tumours. In these cases the deletion of codon 45 p.S45del and the missense substitution p.T41A were detected. Conclusion: Preliminary results of this ongoing study highlight beta-catenin cytoplasmic and membranous expression in the tumour cells of primary and metastatic WTs, with few cases demonstrating nuclear expression.

We report a case of a 57-year old woman with benign SFT of the left kidney. The tumour showed extensive pseudocystic change and mimicked renal cystic neoplasm. Method: A nephrectomy specimen showed cystic tumour beneath renal capsule and in peripelvic adipose tisssue. Histological sections were used for hematoxylin-eosin and for immunohistochemistry (antibodies against vimentin, smooth muscle actin, desmin, S-100 protein, CD117, CD99, bcl-2, CD34, CK18, AE1-AE3, EMA). Results: Microscopically the tumour showed uniform spindle cell proliferation with expansive tumour margins, without necrosis or hemorrhagies. Mitotic activity was 1 per 10 high power fields. Cystic spaces without epithelial lining contained eosinophilic proteinaceous fluid. Imunohistochemically tumour showed difuse positivity for CD34, CD99, bcl-2, vimentin and stained negatively for S-100 protein, cytokeratins, EMA, smooth muscle actin, desmin and CD117. Conclusion: SFT of the kidney is infrequent. Some renal SFT can undergo pseudocystic transformation and mimic renal cystic neoplasm both clinically and macroscopically. Objective: Renal angiomyolipomas are mesenchymal tumors that comprised of adipose tissue, smooth muscle like cells and abnormal thick walled blood vessels admixed in various proportions. Epithelial renal angiomyolipomas are rare variants and may exhibit atypia. In the literature epithelioid renal angiomyolipomas with atypia are reported to have malignant potential. Method: Left radical nephrectomy was performed due to renal mass with flank pain and hematuria. Results: In gross examination; 6.5\u00d73.5\u00d73 cm gray white mass with occasionally necrotic areas at the middle portion of left kidney renal sinus and perinephritic fatty tissue, macroscopically.

The central role of the EMT mechanism is attributed to Snail factor. The intermediate filament expression is changed through the progression of many types of neoplasms. These changes are organ or tissue specific and depend also on the degree of malignant transformation (genome instability acceleration). The expression changes of cytokeratin 18 (CK18) are signs of aggressive biological behaviour in some tumour types -e.g. colorectal and breast carcinoma (downregulation of expression) or CCRC (upregulation of expression). The expression of Snail and CK18 molecules and mRNA CK18 levels correlate to stage and grade of CCRC (according Messai et al. 2010) . Objective: Study was based on the expression of immunohistochemical markers (CK18, CK7, vimentin, Snail, CD10) in 15 cases with evaluation of the primary tumour and its metastasis. Results: The difference and similarity of intensity and percentage of positive neoplastic population between the primary and the secondary carcinoma will be presented. Conclusion: Snail and CK18 seem to be potential tumour progression factors and may be included in so called personalised medicine. Objective: Sarcomatoid carcinoma (SC) of the prostate is a rare variant of prostatic cancer representing less than 1 % of prostate tumors. Tumors are most commonly composed of an admixture of both malignant glandular and spindle cell elements. The sarcomatoid component can vary from 5 % to 99 %. Method: We report the case of a 63-years-old patient with an invasive tumor of the prostate for which he had a radical prostatectomy. Histopathological examination showed that the tumor was responding to an undifferentiated proliferation made of beaches and clusters of pleomorphic cells usually spindle-shaped, with eosinophilic cytoplasm, and elongated or oval nuclei, which are very irregular, sometimes monstrous, multinucleated, basophils with numerous mitotic figures. In some places, there were areas of glandular differentiation and foci of comedocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical study showed immunoreactivity of spindle and pleomorphic cells with cytokeratin and vimentin. Results: The diagnosis of sarcomatoid carcinoma of the prostate-grade Gleason 5+5 was confirmed. Conclusion: SC of the prostate is an exceedingly rare tumor. Retrospective analyses render prostate SC as one of the most aggressive prostate malignancies. The prognosis is dismal regardless of other histologic or clinical findings. extra-uterine extension (FIGO stage II-IV) were significant parameters of poor prognosis. No multivariate analyses were performed due series limitation. Conclusion: Detailed pathology evaluation, including histological subtype, and FIGO stage are essential in the adequate management decision/prognosis evaluation of U-LMS. Objective: Over 90 % of women with endometrial cancer show signs of uterine bleeding, so most cases are diagnosed at an initial stage. This study covers two patients who presented the first signs of this disease in an exceptional manner. Method: Case-1 A 71-year-old woman was afflicted with a six-month toxic syndrome. An omentum tumor was identified in the x-ray. Eleven days after the excision, she demonstrated oliguria, dysuria, and scant uterine bleeding. The pelvic ultrasound revealed a uterine mass. Case-2 A 56-year-old woman demonstrated disabling right inguinal pain. After an x-ray examination of her pelvis, a metastasis was suspected. A biopsy confirmed it. The immunochemistry pointed to a gynecologic, pancreatic or intestinal tumor. The computer tomography scan revealed a uterine mass. Results: The first case only suggested an estromal gastrointestinal tumor or a mesothelioma, misdiagnosing and missing the endometrial carcinoma. The second case was uncommon as bone metastasis is found with solid tumors but seldom occurs with endometrial cancer and even less so as a first sign. Conclusion: We must consider endometrial cancer at signs of uterine bleeding, however, further investigation is required in order to consider the 10 % who do not show the common signs.",

Ferreira * Hospital Santa Maria, Servico de Anatomia Patologica, Lisboa, Portugal Objective: Endometriosis is a benign disease characterized by the presence of functional endometrial tissue in ectopic locations. Retroperitoneal, liver or kidney involvement are extremely rare. Method: We present a case of a 52-year-old woman, which was referred to surgical consultation because of a retroperitoneal mass that was found on a routine abdominal ultrasonography (US). A subsequent CT scan showed a 12 cm tumor involving the liver, right kidney and adrenal gland. The gynecological US revealed ovaries with normal size and two probable uterine leiomyomas. She was submitted to a tumorectomy with segmental hepatectomy and nephrectomy. Results: Grossly, the tumor was 12\u00d78\u00d76 cm, invaded the kidney, the liver and a segment of diaphragm. It was white, fasciculate and with hemorrhagic focus. Histologically the tumor was composed of a biphasic proliferation of endometrial glands and endometrial stroma, both without atypia. The case was diagnosed as deep infiltrating extrapelvic endometriosis. With a 5 years follow-up, the patient is doing well and without evidence of disease. Conclusion: Despite being an extremely rare presentation, endometriosis can involve retroperitoneal organs and simulate a malignant neoplasm, even without a previous history of pelvic involvement. Objective: Malignant melanoma of the female genital tract is a multifocal disease resulting from a disorder of melanocytes Cotyledonoid dissecting leiomyoma is a benign smooth muscle tumor which can mimic a malignant lesion due to its alarming aspect. There are some variant forms of leiomyomas with an unusual infiltrative growth pattern. Due to its worrying appearance of the gross specimen, it is often mistaken for malignant lesion and it is important to be aware of this entity not to over treat this benign smooth-muscle neoplasm. We report a case of a 55 years old woman who underwent hysterectomy because of the suspect of a tumor growing from the right lateral uterine wall. On gross study the tumor measured 10 mm in diameter and was nodular, brown in color and irregular on cut section. Histological examination showed a nodular tumor composed of smooth muscle cells with a storiform pattern which dissects the uterine wall. The tumor was highly vascularized, included a myxoid component and showed some areas with invasion of vascular components. Cellular atypia, mitosis and necrosis were absent. The patient has had a good clinical course, without relapses until the date, what supports the fact that these tumors have a benign clinical behavior, even though they may have a malignant appearance.",

We presented a case of a 45-year-old woman whose leiomyoma was diffusely infiltrated by lymphocytes. Lymphoid infiltration was analyzed with immunohistochemical methods and infiltration was found to be polyclonal type. Method: A 45-year-old woman with abnormal uterine bleeding was prediagnosed uterine leiomyoma and she was applied total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salphingo-oopherectomy. The analysis of the sample sent to pathology lab showed two leiomyomas. Hematoxylin eosin -stained slides were prepared after sampling. \u0131mmunohistochemical stains were applied. Results: Microscopic examination of leiomyoma in greater diameter revealed a lesion with well-circumscribed borders composed of interlacing fascicles of bland monomorphic spindle cells diffusely infiltrated by lymphoid cells. The infiltrate not extended into the surrounding myometrium. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive staining with CD 20, CD3, CD68. It was seen that inflammatory infiltration was polyclonal and involved T cells, B cells and histiocytes. Leiomyoma with lymphoid infiltration was diagnosed. The postoperative course was uneventful within a 6 month follow up period. Conclusion: Leiomyoma with lymphoid infiltration first described in 1989 by Ferry et all. From that date on, the literature involves few cases. Because it is rare and differential diagnose with malignant lymphoma is crucial, we presented the case and reviewed the literature. Objective: Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia is divided into two groups: usual type and differentiated type. The differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia, which is frequently seen with invasive squamous cell carcinoma, can be confused with some benign lesions. The aim of this study is to analyse p16, p53, and Ki-67 expression characteristics of different histological types of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia, invasive squamous cell carcinoma, and benign lesions of the vulva. Method: In this study, immunohistochemical analysis of 18 vulvectomy cases with p16, p53, and Ki-67 was performed. Results: Of 18 patients who underwent vulvectomy, nine had invasive squamous cell carcinoma and nine had vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. Four additional vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia lesions were found accompanying the invasive squamous cell carcinomas. Nine benign lesions were found accompanying the invasive squamous cell carcinomas and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. Mean Ki-67 proliferation index was 32.3 % in the usual type of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia cases and 26.4 % in the differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia cases. No p53 expression was present in benign lesions. Conclusion: Ki-67 PI does not recognize the usual type or differentiated type of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. p53 positivity can be of value in distinguishing differentiated type vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia from benign lesions.",

Results: The median age was 58.04 years and median tumor size was 4 cm. Endometrioid adenocarcinoma was the commonest type (82.5 %); followed by MMMT (6.1 %) and Serous carcinoma (3.5 %). Grade 2 was the commonest tumor grade (42.1 %). Less than half of myometrial invasion was seen in 50 % of the cases, =/> half myometrial invasion was seen in 46.5 % of cases. (Information-not available in 4 cases). Parametrial involvement was seen in 5.3 % cases. The pTNM stage was not mentioned in 71.9 % reports. The median lymph node yield was 15. Conclusion: The compliance to adhere to minimum data information in carcinoma endometrium reports is generally good. Lymph node yield is reasonable. Parametrial involvement and mentioning of pTNM staging is to be done more meticulously. Use of proformas/checklists is recommended.",

Method: A 58-years-old woman presented with abdominal pain and fever. Abdomen CT showed a mesocolic mass adherent to the left kidney and the spleen. She underwent resection of a 22 cm long segment of the left colon with a circumscribed mesocolic tumor measuring 7\u00d710 cm. The tumor was infiltrating the subserosa of the large intestine. Intraoperatively normal ovaries have been identified. Results: Histologically the tumor is composed by monomorphous cells in solid nests developing cavities which contain serous or hemmorhagic fluid. The tumor cells have scanty cytoplasm and often grooved nuclei. Mitoses are very rare. The tumor cells were immunoreactive for vimentin, inhibin and progesterone receptors. The postoperative course was uncomplicated and the patient is free of disease 18 months later. Conclusion: Light microscopic and immunohistochemical features of the tumor are similar to those of ovarian granulosa cell tumors (GCT). Since the tumor was resected in toto and the mitotic activity of the cells is very low, we expect a favorable prognosis. Extraovarian GCT are very rare and only 7 cases have been published during the last 50 years. Probably these tumors arise from residual tissue of the genital ridge (so-called secondary mullerian system).",

Zubor, J. Danko, L. Plank * JFM CU, Dept. of Pathology, Martin, Slovakia Objective: Increased telomerase activity represents an early event in cervical carcinogenesis allowing cell immortality by recovering chromosomal telomeres. Thus, detection of TERC and TERT gene amplification might represent a diagnostic and valuable prognostic biomarker of cervical neoplasias. Method: Cervical smears from 13 patients classified according to Bethesda as NILM (n=3), ASC-US (n=2), L-SIL (n=2), H-SIL (n=4) and SCC (n=2) were analysed for TERC (3q26) and TERT (5p15) gene amplification by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in 100 cells per slide using a four-color FISH probe (FHACT\u2122). Results: The numbers of TERC and TERT copies, average ratio of gene copies and average number of cells with \u22654 TERC gene copies were highest in SCC, followed by H-SIL, L-SIL, ASC-US and NILM cases. Correlation between TERC/TERT amplification intensity and oncocytological findings was statistically significant (p<0.0001). Conclusion: FISH analysis of TERC and TERT genes could be effective tool for the diagnosis of cervical neoplastic lesions. Using together with cytology and HPV DNA testing it can achieve higher sensitivity and specificity to discriminate H-SIL and invasive carcinomas from L-SIL lesions. Objective: Ovarian stromal hyperplasia (OSH) is characterised by non-neoplastic overgrowth of the ovarian cortical. Mild hyperplasia of the cortical and medullary stroma is found in the ovaries of about one-third of perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. It is nearly always diffusely bilateral. We report a case of OSH associated with endometrial carcinoma (EC). Method: A 40-years-old caucasian woman, obese, smoker, with fatty liver, Gilbert\u00b4s syndrome and cholelithiasis. She had endometrial curettage biopsy for dysfunctional uterine bleeding for 5 month, which was diagnosed of complex atypical endometrial hiperplasia. A total abdominal hysterectomy whith bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. Results: The diagnosis was Well differentiated endometrioid EC and bilateral OSH with focal stromal hypertecosis. Conclusion: OSH of moderate to severe degree may be found in women with disorders associated with androgenic and estrogenic manifestations including EC, obesity, hypertension, and glucose intolerance, but these findings are less frequent and less obtrusive than in stromal hyperthecosis. Obese woman are at risk for developing endometrioid EC as a result of the increased capacity in adipose tissue to convert androstenedione to oestrone, and testosterone to oestradiol. A relationship in the origin of hormone-dependent endometrial pathology may exist between OSH, blood androgen levels and EC.",

Objective: Primary adenocarcinoma of the vulva is rare, and enteric differentiation is excepcional. Only a few cases of neoplasms of pure intestinal-type in the low genital tract have been reported. They are considered to arise from cloacal remants or from intestinal heterotopia. Method: We present the case of a 54 year-old woman, with a histerectomy performed 10 years before. On clinical examination a polipoid lesion in the vulvar vestibule was noticed. Biopsy revealed a tubular adenoma of intestinal type with a focus of adenocarcinoma. The first histologic interpretation was a metastatic intestinal tumor. Clinical examination, recto-colonoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen excluded this possibility. Results: The immunohistochemical study showed reactivity with citokeratin 20 but didn't with citokeratin 7. All this led to conclude that it was a primary intestinaltype adenocarcinoma of the vulva arisen from an adenoma. Conclusion: On our knowledge there are less than 100 reported cases of intestinal adenoma in the genital tract. They have been described also in the vagina and cervix but only a few developed an adenocarcinoma. It is important to be aware of this tumor type and to distinguish it from metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma in order to plan appropriate treatment.",

The underlying pathogenesis is still unclear and an effective method of treatment has not yet emerged. Method: Here we present a 32 years old female patient presented to our clinic with 7 years of unexplained infertility. Her diagnostic infertility work-up revealed no abnormality. However, at gynecologic examination there was a thick and hard granulation tissue at the cervix extending to the posterior vaginal wall. Transvaginal ultrasound was unremarkable except for increased endometrial thickness. Results: Cervicovaginal and endometrial biopsy with diagnostic hysteroscopy was performed which demonstrated ligneous inflammation of both cervix and vagina. Endometrial biopsy was reported as chronic non-specific endometritis with dense fibrin deposition. Conclusion:. The disease may also affect other organs including oral cavity and eyes. This unusual condition is difficult to treat and lack of awareness makes the diagnosis also problematic. Objective: Differential diagnosis LM vs STUMP may be controversial, especially regarding necrosis evaluation; few studies address the relation between different treatments and their morphological effects. We aim to characterize a series LMs and putative STUMPs harboring necrosis. Method: Consecutive putative STUMPs (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) and a series of LMs with necrosis diagnosed at CHSJ & IPOP-Porto. Clinical files, particularly previous hormonal treatment (HT), gross specimen and histology features. Results: 18 putative STUMPs and 35 LMs with necrosis. LMs mean age at diagnosis: 43 years; mean size: 9.0 cm (2.3-18); 45 % with other LMs; treatment: myomectomy (49 %) and hysterectomy (51 %); 23 % peri-partum, 8.5 % post-uterine artery embolization; 17 (49 %) previous HT: progestin (17 %), oral contraceptive-OC (20 %), hormonal-IUD (8.6 %), and medical assisted reproduction (8.6 %). STUMPs mean age at diagnosis: 45 years; mean size: 10 cm (2.0-20); 44 % with other LMs; low mitotic index-MI (mean 3.16; median 1/10HPF); slight cell atypia; variable ischemic/ tumor-type necrosis. Treatment: myomectomy (22 %), hysterectomy (83 %) and radiotherapy (11 %); 12 (67 %) previous HT: progestin (22 %), OC (39 %), hormonal-IUD (11 %); no recurrence in remaining cases (n=6): median follow-up: 97.5 months. Conclusion: LMs with necrosis and STUMP may display overlapping features. Diagnosis of STUMP should consider previous HT, detailed morphology (necrosis type/atypia/MI), to prevent overdiagnosis of STUMP. positivity. PLAP and Chromogranin were negative. Ki-67 nuclear positivity was found in less than 1 % of Sertoli cells and in about 1 % of Leydig cells in hyperplastic areas. Karyotype was 46xy. Conclusion: Although, surgical pathologists encounter TFS rare in a clinical practice, they should be aware of this condition, especially in lack of relevant clinical data, when it could be interpreted as a tumor. Objective: Frozen section (FS) diagnosis of ovarian mucinous tumors can be difficult due to the size of these tumors, heterogeneity and potential risk of metastasis from gastrointestinal (GI) neoplasms. Method: We reported 79 ovarian mucinous tumors submitted for (FS) evaluation between January 2007 and Avril 2012 was conducted. Results: FS and final pathology results were collected. The average tumor size was 22,1 cm (1-55 cm). The FS and final pathology diagnosis were concordant in 84,8 % (67/79) of the cases. Of the 12(15,1 %) discordant cases, one (1,2 %) was downgraded and 8 cases (13,9 %) were upgraded. Of the 30 tumors interpreted as borderline mucinous tumors (BMT) on FS, 8(26,6 %) were malignant at final diagnosis (4 ovarian, 4 GI), 21 (70 %) remain as BMT and 1 (3,3 %) was benign. Of the 18 benign tumors on FS, 3 cases (17, 6 %) were upgraded to BMT at final diagnosis. Tumors with a malignant diagnosis on FS (30 cases) were 100 % concordant with final diagnosis. Conclusion: Our study showed a 15,1 % rate of discordance between FS and final diagnosis. Given that GI origin is a possible finding, intraoperative assessment of the appendix should be performed in all mucinous ovarian tumors.",

Nechi, W. Jomaa, K. Ben Romdhane * Salah Azaiez Institute, Dept. of Pathology, Tunis, Tunisia Objective: M\u00fcllerian adenosarcoma (MA) is a distinctive type of uterine tumor, traditionally regarded as a low-grade variant of mixed m\u00fcllerian tumors. Method: Thirty one cases of adenosarcoma were examined during a period of 19 years (May 1993 -February 2012 . Results: Thirty tumors were of the uterine corpus and one of the cervix. The mean patient age was 54,2 years (range: 16 to 73 year). The main clinical manifestations were vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. Physical examination showed cervical/vaginal mass or pelvic mass. Treatment was known in 25 cases: Patients underwent hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in 17 cases and lymphadenectomy in 6 cases. Tumor size ranged from 2,5 to 12 cm (mean: 7.1 cm). Microscopically, sarcomatous overgrowth was found in 4 cases (13 %), heterologous elements in 5 (16 %). Eleven cases (35 %) had myometrial invasion involving the internal half of the myometrial thickness in 9 cases, and more than 50 % in 3 cases (9 %). The cervical tumor presented as an endocervical polyp without invasion of the cervical wall. Conclusion: Uterine MA are low-grade neoplasms capable of local recurrence and much less commonly distant metastasis. Surgical excision is the main treatment strategy with a good prognosis in the early stage disease. The 2 most important adverse prognostic factors are deep myometrial invasion and sarcomatous overgrowth.",

Method: Seventy-seven cervical biopsies that originally diagnosed as non-CIN (n = 31) and CIN (n = 46), were reviewed by three pathologists and re-classified as non-CIN (n = 54) and CIN (n = 23), based on agreement between at least two of three, to obtain a consensus diagnosis. Consensus diagnosis was defined as the \"Gold Standard\". Then immunostaining for Ki67, P16 and CK17 was performed on all cases and their results were compared with original and consensus diagnosis. Results: The overall agreement between original and consensus diagnosis was 67.5 % (Kappa = 0.39, P-value < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of Ki67 immunostaining were 95.6 % and 85.1 % and for P16 were 91.3 and 98.1 %, respectively.

There seems to be differences in WT1 expression among surface epithelial ovarian tumor subtypes. Method: Immunohistochemistry for WT1 was done on 35 serous & 3 mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, 9 borderline serous & 10 borderline mucinous tumors, 7 endometrioid ovarian carcinomas, 3 clear cell carcinomas, 1 malignant Brenner tumor, 2 metastatic adenocarcinomas and 6 endometrial adenocarcinomas. A tumor was considered negative if<1 % of tumor cells were stained. Positive reactions were graded :1+,1-24 %; 2+,25-49 %; 3+,50-74 %; 4+,75-100 %. Results: Of serous cystadenocarcinomaes, 30(85.7 %) were positive,4 showed reactivity of<50 % of the tumor cells and one were negative. All borderline serous tumors were positive. All mucinous tumors, endometrioid carcinomas, clear cell carcinomas, metastatic adenocarcinomas and primary endometrial carcinomas were negative. The single malignant Brenner tumor were positive for WT1. Conclusion: WT1 is a good marker to distinguish primary ovarian serous carcinomas from other surface epithelial tumors (especially endometrioid subtype) and metastatic carcinomas (especially endometrial serous carcinoma), other than malignant mesothelioma. Degree of expression is not an indicator to separate high grade borderline serous tumors from low grade ones. Objective: FATWO is a rare neoplasm originating from the mesonephric duct remnants that occurs predominantly in the broad ligament but also in the ovary. It is considered a lowmalignant potential tumor. However local recurrences and metastases have been reported. Method: A 45 year-old female, on routine gynecological physical examination, followed by pelvic ultrasonography and computer tomography was diagnosed with a mass at the right ovary. A salpingo-oopherectomy was performed. On gross examination a well-circumscribed, solid and focally cystic tumor measuring 10,5\u00d77\u00d75,5 cm arose in the ovarian hilus. Results: Microscopically the tumor consisted of mediumsized, ovoid to polygonal cells arranged in a solid, tubular and sieve-like pattern. Some cystic spaces were lined by low-cuboidal cells and contained amorphous, eosinophilic material. Cellular atypia and mitoses were rare. The tumor cells were positive for Vimentin, Inhibin-a (focally), CD10, cytokeratins 8/18, 19 and 7 (focally) and negative for cytokeratin 20, epithelial membrane antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen and a-fetoprotein. Conclusion: Histopathological and imunohistochemical findings consistent with an ovarian FATWO. Differential diagnosis includes endometrioid carcinoma, clear-cell carcinoma, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors (retiform variant) and rete ovarii adenoma. Surgical excision is the optimal treatment. Radiation therapy, chemotherapy or even targeting molecular therapy is questionable. M\u00fcllerian adenosarcoma is a rare mixed tumor of low malignant potential. Usually presented as a large endometrial polyp in postmenopausal women. They are associated with tamoxifen or radiation therapy. Microscopy shows a mixture of benign glandular epithelium and low-grade endometrial sarcoma is typically concentrated around the glands. The differential diagnosis is made with the adenofibroma, but now is doubted the existence of this tumor and is considered more of a distinct adenosarcoma. The treatment is total hysterectomy. Sisters of 24 and 16 years with a history of dysmenorrhea. Hysteroscopy was performed to the eldest one, in which multiple polyps are observed and partially resected. The pathological diagnosis was Mixed Mullerian tumor, adenofibroma/adenosarcoma. Total abdominal hysterectomy was performed. Histological examination showed a mixed tumor with glandular component and a low-grade sarcomatous, scarce mitosis, mild atypia and no necrosis. The diagnosis was: mullerian adenosarcoma. A year later, a hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy was performed to the youngest sister, that showed endometrial polyps with stromal predominance, and no significant atypia. With the diagnosis of mullerian adenosarcoma, and taking into account family history, total hysterectomy was performed. Adenosarcoma is a rare tumor whose family presentation is not described in the literature.",

We investigated the clinicopathological features of ovarian teratoma associated with GP, and compared immature teratomas (ITs) with GP to ITs without GP. Method: We investigated 16 patients with ovarian teratoma with GP and 27 patients with IT without GP, who were diagnosed at Samsung Medical Center (seoul) from January 1995 to August 2010. Results: Six patients with IT with GP (37.5 % of 16 patients) had recurrence. When IT with GP (n=15) was compared to IT without GP (n=27), patient of IT with GP showed larger tumor size (median, 19 cm vs. median 13 cm) (P<0.001), more frequent relapse (40 %, 6/15 vs. 3.7 %, 1/ 27) (P= 0.005), and frequently elevated pre-operative CA125 level (100 %, 12/12 vs. 50 %, 10/20) (P=0.004). Survival curves showed significantly shorter relapse-free survival in patients of IT with GP (P=0.002). Two-year relapse-free survival rates were 59.3 % and 96.3 % in IT with GP and IT without GP, respectively. However, all patients except one case of IT with GP alive. Conclusion: Ovarian IT with GP was characterized by larger tumor size and frequent elevation of preoperative CA125 level, and GP was associated with frequent relapse in patients with ovarian IT.",

The incidance of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia increases. Cytologic diagnosis og these lesions are substantially important. So we aim to identify the role of p16 and Ki67 immunostainings for predictive factors of cervical neoplasia. Method: The study was conducted January 2007 to January 2012. Ninety-three cases (mean age 43,9; range 22-71 years) diagnosed as squamous intraepithelial lesions were included, Objective: There are several prognostic factors in melanoma. It was suggested that HER-3 expression may influence the tumor behavior. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship of HER-3 expression with various prognostic factors. Method: HER-3 expression was evaluated in 52 melanomas, 26 without metastases and 19 with lymph node and 7 with distant metastases. Membranous, cytoplasmic and nuclear HER-3 expression was separately analysed. The staining intensity and percentage of positive tumor cells were evaluated. Results: The cytoplasmic staininig was seen in all cases, with average intensity of 2 and percentage of positive cells ranging from 5 % to 90 % (mean 48.8 %). The percentage of cytoplasmic HER-3 positive cells was inversely correlated with Clark and Breslow stage (R=\u22120.29 and R=\u22120.43). Cytoplasmic HER-3 reaction was significantly stronger in cases with lymph node metastases (2.3 vs. 1.8 p<0.03). In 22 cases a dot-like cytoplasmic reaction was seen. Membranous positivity was seen in 28 cases (54 %). Conclusion: HER-3 may play a role in melanoma progression. It may be involved in lymphatic dissemination. Further studies of prognostic significance of HER-expression in melanoma are needed.",

Our aim was to determine whether our sampling of WLE specimens was adequate, inadequate or excessive and to establish guidelines for these specimens. Method: 128 cases which underwent initial biopsy and subsequent WLE in 2010 were identified. We recorded the specimen size, macroscopic appearance, number of blocks sampled and margins of the original biopsy. Results: There was wide variation in the number of blocks sampled (range 1-27). Residual melanoma was identified in 7 of the cases (9.4 %) which had clear margins on the original biopsy. Of these, 4 had evidence of a pigmented lesion on macroscopic examination. The remaining 3 cases had margins of 1 mm or less on the original excision. No subsequent surgery was performed on these cases. Conclusion: Our study has shown that in WLE specimens with no evidence of a macroscopic lesion and in which margins of the original biopsy were clear by greater than 1 mm, little is to be gained from extensive sampling. Reduced sampling would result in saving laboratory resources with a predicted 49 % block reduction in our laboratory alone.",

Results: At surgery a mahagony-brown mass measuring 10 mm in diameter was removed and reported as oxyphil adenoma on frozen section. Histopathological examination revealed encapsulated adenoma composed of oxyphil cells with abundant, granular pink cytoplasm and a rim of normal parathyroid tissue. Mitotic figures were absent. Postoperatively, a decrease of the serum calcium down to 2.31 mmol/l was declared. The followup period was unremarkable. Conclusion: There appear to be a growing evidence that a big part of oxyphil adenomas of parathyroid gland can produce parathyroid hormone and contribute to the cases of primary hyperthyroidism.",

            "text": "Objective: Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common primary cutaneous lymphoma. Mycosis fungoides often develops slowly over many years, presenting with a generalized erythroderma, skin patches or plaques. The diagnosis of MF requires the integration of clinical and histopathologic findings. Narrowband UVB (NBUVB) is widely used to treat MF. To evaluate the effectiveness of therapy the histopathologic findings before and after NBUVB reviewed using GUITART criteria. Method: We enrolled 20 patients (12 women, 8 men; age range, 10-80 years; mean age, 45.5 years) with clinically and histologically proven MF. The patients received NBUVB phototherapy three times a week. A biopsy was performed 3 months after onset of the treatment and GUITART criteria used to scoring MF before and after therapy. Results: Phototherapy was reduced the primary intraepidermal atypical lymphocytes (P value=0.008), dermal atypical lymphocytes (P value=0.008), epidermotropism (P value= 0.001), density of infiltration (P Value=0.002) and lymphocytic infiltrate without inflammatory features (P Value = 0.046) in all patient. But the relationship between the reticular fibroplasia of papillary dermis and phototherapy was not proved (P value=0.18). Overall score of patients was significantly lower after phototherapy (P value=0.000). Conclusion: Our data suggest that NBUVB therapy is reduces histiologic score of MF and is effective for the treatment of Iranian patients.",

Histochemical review showed the reactivity of the colloid materials via the PAS, crystal violet and methyl violet staining. All the three cases were finally diagnosed as nodular colloid degeneration. Conclusion: NCD is a rare disease but it should be considered in any cases with a history of long exposure to the light.

Gundogdu * Ataturk University, Medical Faculty, Erzurum, Turkey Objective: Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Serum GPC3 was shown to be expressed in 40 % of melanomas (Ms) but GPC3 expression in Melanoma tissues had not been investigated.In this study, immunohistochemical analysis of GPC3 protein expression was investigated in histologic sections from Melanoma tissues. Method: 60 melanoma patients, twenty patients with insitu melanoma, twenty patients stage 0 and stage I melanoma, twenty patients stage II and stage III melanoma. All cases were stained with anti-GPC3 antibody. GPC3 expression was divided into 2 categories: negative (negative or weak cytoplasmic staining) and positive (moderate or strong cytoplasmic with membranous accentuation). Results: GPC3 immunopositivity. showed in 40,3 % of melanomas. GPC3 expression at stage 0, I, II, III were 44.4 %, 40.0 %, 41.6 %, 35 % respectively. Method: We report the case of a 77 year old man presenting with an erythematous plaque of the right hemithorax. Results: Macroscopically the lesion had irregular borders and was mildly infiltrative with a violet hue. Microscopic examination revealed tumor cells within lymphatic spaces, without infiltration of the adjacent stroma. The histologic and immunophenotypic characteristics of these cells were compatible with a carcinoma of lung origin. CT scan revealed a lung mass as well as multiple liver and chest wall metastases. Conclusion: Malignancies originating from the breasts, lungs and large bowl are the most common to involve the lymphatic net of the skin. Melanoma on the other hand is more frequently presenting with lymphangitic invasion, whereas inflammatory carcinomas may also affect lymphatic vessels and may be confused with erysipelas. The revelation of the primary origin is not always easy and differential diagnosis should also include gynecological malignancies, kidney and urinary bladder carcinomas. In our patient the diagnosis was established on the grounds of histology and immunohistochemistry, and was supported by the clinical and radiological findings. Objective: Inverted follicular keratosis (IFK) is almost always a solitary lesion occuring mainly in adult life. Men are affected twice as often as women. Pathologically, They can be confused with a variety of lesions, both benign and malignant. Squamous carcinoma is the most serious differential diagnosis. Method: We decribe a retrospective study about 7 cases of IFK diagnosed over a 18-year-period (1994-2012) . Results: We collected 7 lesions, all treated by surgical excision. Haemalum eosin sections were studied in all cases. All lesions were single. Five, of them, were situated on the face and two on the scalp. All the patients were adults with a mean age of 34 years, average between 19 and 66 years. They presented mostly as asymptomatic papules and all were small lesions. The different sections of the lesion showed skin well delineated endophytic epithelial proliferations with inverted papillomatous and acanthotic components containing several circumscribed squamous eddies. They was no atypia, mitotic activity necrosis or stromal invasion. Conclusion: IFK pose very real diagnostic problems unless one is aware of this entity. In fact, they may mimic malignant lesions especially squamous cell carcinoma, both clinically and pathologically.",

We examined an excisional biopsy specimen of the forehead. Method: HE, Stains all and Immunohistochemical stains were used. Results: Histology revealed dense lymphoid infiltrate showing nodular pattern in the dermis and in the subcutis. The lymphoid infiltrate predominantly composed of large centrocytes. There were areas where the neoplastic cells show spindle cell morphology with bizarre nuclei and in these areas the stroma were myxoid, mucinous. With immunohistocemical stains the neoplastic cells were positive for CD20, Bcl-6, and negative for CD5, CD10, vimentin, CD34, S100, actin, desmin, AE1/AE3. CD21 showed residual network of follicular dendritic cells in the background. Conclusion: Spindle cell lymphoma is a very rare variant of cutaneous follicle centre cell lymphoma and the presence of the spindled bizarre cells can cause differential diagnostic problems. The main differential diagnostic entities are primary or metastatic spindle cell sarcoma and spindle cell melanoma.

Method: We reviewed 115 skin biopsies of clinicopathologically diagnosed MF cases at Medical University of Ankara. We looked for a) epidermotropism, atypical lymphocytes, morphologic features in the epidermis, dermoepidermal junction and dermis b) immunohistochemical staining ratios of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD30 and expression loss of CD5, CD7. Results: Atypical lymphocytes) (96 %), dermal fibrosis (90 %), epidermotropism (86 % single cells, 44 % linear arrangement, 15 % Pautrier's microabscesses, 83 % 'haloed' lymphocytes), epidermal acantosis (72 %), basal vacuolar degeneration (focally 43 %, marked 15 %) and a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate were the most common and important features. Dermal edema (46 %) extravasated erythrocytes (34 %), spongiosis (27 %), eosinophils (17 %) and necrotic keratinocytes (14 %) were the less seen and non-specific ones. Immunohistochemical results correlated with a ratio of 78 % CD4, 22 % CD8 positive MF. Expression loss of CD7 was seen in 73 %, CD5 in 31 % of cases. Conclusion: Diagnosis of early MF requires the correlation of morphologic, immunohistochemical and clinical features. Also due to the disease's heterogenity, biopsies from different locations and rebiopsies will enhance the diagnosis.",

Method: Tregs were identified using immunohistochemistry for Foxp3 and recorded using image analysis in 55 cases of INSCC (and their adjacent IS, AK or benign tissue (BN), when present), in 18 cases of IS and 46 cases of AK (and their adjacent BN tissue). Statistical analysis was performed using the paired T-test. p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: In INSCC cases, \u03a4regs in the tumor were more numerous than the adjacent \u0392N (n=46) (mean 155 vs. 79, p <0,001). Additionally, adjacent IS had more Tregs than adjacent AK (n=6) (160 vs. 86, p=0,045). Significant differences between INSCC, and IS or AK were not observed. In IS and AK cases, \u03a4regs were more numerous than the adjacent BN (206 vs. 42, p<0,001 and 148 vs. 47, p< 0,001), respectively. Conclusion: Treg infiltration of the skin increases early from the precancerous AK, indicating early involvement of Tregs in the development of SCC. Objective: Mastocytosis is a rare disorder and its true incidence is unknown. Skin is most commonly involved, followed by the bones and the gastrointestinal tract. Method: Five men presented with many brown lesions in the trunk and one woman with multiple redish brown nonpruritic macules in the extremities. We used immunohistochemistry for c-kit and tryptase for the definite diagnosis. The expression of CD25 and CD2 were also evaluated. Results: Histology showed five cases of urticaria pigmentosa with severe diffuse infiltration of the papillary dermis by mast cells and one case of telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans (TMEP) with scattered mast cells around dilated capillaries and venules of the papillary dermis. The mast cells were positive to c-kit and tryptase and only in one case there was a coexpression of CD25 and CD2 >50 % of the mast cells. In that case involvement of bone marrow was observed and the diagnosis of indolent systemic mastocytosis was established according to WHO 2008 criteria. Conclusion: Urticaria pigmentosa is the most common form seen in adults while TMEP is an uncommon form that occurs exclusively in adults. The skin involvement in indolent systemic mastocytosis is a part of the spectrum of the disease.",

Our objective was to study whether computerized image analysis could be helpful. Method: In 34 patients biopsies of keratoacantoma-like lesions were taken at admission. One month later surgical excision was performed in growing lesions, whereas regressing lesions were left untreated. A final diagnosis was established combining clinical and histological evaluation, Digitalized images from KI-67 immunostained and hematoxylin counterstained sections of first biopsies were obtained. Tumor nuclei were marked interactively. An inhouse computer program analyzed the geometric relations between the nuclei. Nuclear gray values and their histogram entropy were calculated. Results: 27 keratoacnthomas and 7 keratoacantomalike squamous cell carcinomas entered this investigation. Basic variables of the geometric analysis did not differ between the two entities regardless whether all nuclei or only the Ki67 positive ones had been examined. Chromatin gray values were significantly lower and their histogram entropy higher in the keratoacantoma-like squamous cell carcinomas. Conclusion: Basic geometric variables do not seem to be different beteen both lesions, but a shift in the gray value histogram to lower values with increased entropy in carcinomas indicated important differences of the chromatin structure, Supported by FAPESP and CNPq.",

One month later an ultrasonography of the left breast showed a 5,5 cm mass which was excised with clean margins. Axillary lymph nodes were free of metastasis. Results: Results. The dermal tumor presented well demarcated basaloid epithelial nests with squamous differentiation focally connected with the epidermis. They showed peripheral palisading and high nuclear grade with pleomorphism, brisk mitotic activity and multiple prominent nucleoli. Atypical cells, arranged as strips, nests or isolated elements, were observed at the tumor edge, separated by a grey-zone from the overlying malpighian epithelium. Immunostains were positive for cytokeratins, melanocytic (S-100/HMB-45/ MART-1) and neuroendocrine (CD56/NSE/Cromogranin) markers. The 4,8 cm breast tumor corresponded to a high grade metastatic BCC with reactivity for epithelial markers, S-100 and CD56. Objective: Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) was described at first by Brocq and named by Brunsting et al. in 1930. Superficial granulomatous pyoderma (SGP) was described as a variant of PG in 1988. We present three cases of this rare variant. Method: There were two women and one man with age ranging from 40 to 78 years. All of them had a long history of a slowly enlarging, eritematous and ulcerative plaque in different areas including leg and breast skin. A biopsy was performed in all cases. Results: The superficial dermis showed neutrophilic inflammation with an admixture of granulomatous inflammation and sinus formation. There wasn't vasculitis and fat tissue was not affected. Conclusion: SGP is a rare variant of PG. Diagnosis of this entity generally is made on the basis of skin biopsy results with all features mentioned previously and a typical clinical appearance. Most of times, these lesions are diagnosed as granulomatous dermatitis, thinking in infectious pathology. This is the most important differential diagnosis, because SGP is responsive to corticosteroids. The pathogenesis of PG is unknown, though is now believed to altered neutrophil chemotaxis and some authors suggest that SGP may be a delayed-type hypersensitivity to an unknown antigen. Pathergy is the inciting factor in several patients.",

Selective BRAF inhibitors have demonstrated response rates far higher than standard chemotherapeutic options. BRAF mutation analysis is usually performed on primary tumour tissue; however, no conclusive data are available on the concordance of test results between primary tumours and corresponding metastases. We assessed the concordance of BRAF mutation status in a study of 16 primary BRAFnative tumours and their corresponding lymph node metastases. Method: 16 patients with histologically confirmed nonmutated BRAF MM who underwent surgical resection of the primary tumour and positive selective lymph node biopsy or lymphadenectomy were included. Mutation status was determined by means of a realtime PCR assay (Cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test, Roche Molecular Systems). Results: There was a 100 % concordance of the BRAF results in primary tumor and corresponding metastases in 16 analyzed pairs. Conclusion: Our findings show total concordance in BRAF status between primary BRAF native tumors and their paired metastases, and suggest that acquisition of BRAF V600 mutation in metastases from primary native tumors is a rare event.",

However, these semiquatitative methods have a high rate of false positives in Spitz/Reed nevi. We have compared semiquantitative histopathologic and dermatoscopic findings in a series of Spitz/Reed nevi. Method: We collected 19 cases (15 female and 4 men) of atypical Spitz and/or Reed nevi. All cases were microscopically confirmed. A histologic index (HI) was constructed scoring the following findings: symmetry, sharp demarcation, architectural dysplasia, melanocytic atipia and nest size, and compared with validated dermatoscopic scores (ABCD score, 7-point checklist and Menzies score). Distributions of these scores for the different dermatoscopic patterns were also analyzed. Results: Median age at presentation was 15 years (range 1 to 36). The HI varied from 0 to 5 points. We found a strong positive correlation between the HI and Menzies score (r=0,539, p=0,01). In addition, HI values differed significantly when the multicomponent dermatoscopic pattern group was compared with the other patterns (U =22, 5 Z =\u22122,25, p =0.01). Conclusion: Menzies is the only dermatoscopic score which strongly correlates with histologic findings in Spitz/Reed nevi and may be useful in the diagnosis of atypical lesions.",

Apart from standard surgery and local radiotherapy, targeted strategies with anti-CD20 (rituximab) has introduced new treatment modalities. Method: Woman, aged 82, with solitary skin lesion on her face. After surgical excision, histo-and immunohistochemistry with the ABC system on paraffin embedded tissue was performed. Results: Microscopically, a non-epidermotropic perivascular and periadnexal neoplastic infiltrate with a follicular growth pattern was observed. The lesion consisted of predominantly medium-sized centrocytes and several centroblasts enmeshed in a network of CD23(+) dendritic cells. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic lymphoid cells were CD20, CD79a, BCL2 and BCL6 positive. CD30, MUM1 and Ig were all negative. The patient received one cycle of rituximab and 6 months later is free of disease. Conclusion: Primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (CBCL) account for 25 % of cutaneous lymphomas. PCFCL is one of the three major categories of CBCL, recently classified by WHO, (the other two: PCMZL and PCDLBCL, leg-type). BCL-2, except for systemic follicular lymphoma, it can also occur in PCFCL, as in our case. PCFCL, usually locally treated with surgery and radiotherapy, could possibly offer a candidate for anti-CD20 targeted therapy, especially in multifocal lesions. Objective: Thirteen and ten years old male patients admitted with 4 months interval, having diffuse hemorrhagic papules on extremities and trunk. The first has not responded to methorexate previously. The second had varicella infection 3 months before and, his rushes spreaded out recently. Method: Multiple punch biopsies of the first patient revealed epidermal necrosis, basal vacuolisation and subepidermal diffuse infiltrate composed of CD3 and mostly CD8 positive T cells showing a striking angiocentric distribution. There were CD30 positive large cells with vesicular nuclei both in epidermis and dermis. Some of the vessels exhibited lymphocytic vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis. Punch biopsy of the second patient revealed subcorneal pustule, dyskeratosis and basal vacuolisation, papillary dermal edema, erythrocyte extravasation and severe lymphocyte-rich cellular reaction infiltrating the interface. Lymphocytes were CD3 and mostly CD8 positive. In between, there were large cells with vesicular nuclei exhibiting CD30 positivity. Results: Diagnoses were PLEVA based on the vascular and interface changes in accordance with clinical findings. Both patients responded to oral antibiotics. Conclusion: PLEVA is among the reactive conditions that can simulate CD30 positive lymphoproliferative diseases. Although CD8 positive lymphomatoid papulosis is defined in pediatric patients, no response was seen to oral antibiotics.",

Objective: Leptospirosis in humans usually courses with hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, and the putative mechanism may be related to nitric oxide production. Methylene blue is a known inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase, and have beneficial effects on clinical and experimental sepsis. Method: Serum creatinine and ionic changes were evaluated at various time points (4, 8, 16 and 28 days) in hamsters. We also determined the effect of methylene-blue treatment when used as adjuvant therapy combined with a late start of standard antibiotic (ampicillin) treatment. Results: Rather than K and Mg depletion, hyperkalemia and hypermagnesemia were observed during acute infection. These findings are probably associated with an accelerated progression to renal failure, since this model is not feasible to mirror the supportive therapy (including fluid expansion) that retards progression to the oliguric/hyperkalemic state. Infected hamsters at day 8 presented diffuse tubular cell swelling with mild or no nephritis. At days 16 and 28 they showed variable degrees of acute tubular changes, regeneration of tubular epithelia and nephritis. Survival and renal pathology did not differ among different treatment groups. Conclusion: Adjuvant methylene blue had no effect on the survival, renal pathology or Mg and K serum levels during acute-phase leptospirosis in hamsters.",

This work describes the intracellular changes in sialylation of skeletal muscle fiber during the process of its transformation into a nurse cell after occupation by the nematode Trichinella spiralis. Results: The study was performed at defined time points post infection. Lectin histochemistry with TML, MAL and SNA detected increased production of sialylated glycoproteins within the affected fibers, and it was evaluated by acidic ninhydrin reaction in muscle homogenates. Increase of total sialyltransferase activity was estimated by measurement of incorporated CMP-N-[14 C]-acetylneuraminic acid, and immunohistochemistry showed higher expression of \u03b1-2,3-sialyltransferases II and IV within the affected fibers. SNA lectin affino-blots showed at least four protein bands with approximate molecular weight between 126 and 159 kDa, which were more reactive to SNA compared to their counterparts from the control samples. Conclusion: It is evident that skeletal muscle injury induced by Trichinella activates biosynthesis of glycoproteins bearing sialic acids, which are not present in the normal muscle fiber. However, the protein identity, function and the biological significance of these sialoglycoproteins remain to be elucidated. BG051PO001 Objective: Protozoal and helminthic infestations of the central nervous system (CNS) are rare and their incidence is less than 1 %. They are more common among children, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals and tend to follow a fatal course. Method: We report 2 cases of cerebral amebic abscess occurring in 2 immunocompetent men. Results: They were 2 men aged of 43 and 18 years old. Headache; altered mental status and fever were common presenting symptoms. In the 2 cases the diagnosis of cerebral abscess was suspected on cerebral CT scan. Histopathologic analysis revealed extensive areas of necrosis and hemorrhage with granulomatous lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrate. other conditions such as malignancy and tuberculosis. It occurs normally in the mouth and tonsils, however, it can sometimes occur in the chest, abdomen, pelvis or other areas of the body. Method: We describe a retrospective study about 56 cases of actinomycosis diagnosed over a 21-year-period (1990-2011) . Results: The 56 cases were divided in 20 cervicofacial actinomycosis, 18 genito-urinary tract actinomycosis, 8 cutaneous actinomycosis, 7 abdominal actinomycosis and 3 cases occur in central nervous system. All patients were symptomatic. The most frequent symptom consisted in fever. The diagnosis was based on histologic study in all cases. Tissue histologic studies show suppurative and granulomatous inflammatory changes, connective proliferation, in which bacteria form typical granular colonies composed of radiating gram positive filaments. Conclusion: Diagnosis of actinomycosis is usually made retrospectively by means of histologic examination of surgically obtained specimens, but rarely preoperatively. It is generally treated with long term antibiotics.",

We have decided to research. Method: It was studied retrospectively for not to be under the influence. Randomly chosen from the archives, 65 parasitic appendix (41 women + 24 men) and 65 appendix vermiformis (41 women and 24 men) lengths were compared. The last 65 appendix materials of the appendixes which include parasites (56 E.vermicularis, 8 A.lumbricoides,1 T.saginata) and operated any causes were examined. Placeholder conditions such as fibrous obliteration and tumour were excluded. The premeasured length of the appendix in the series (65+65=130) were listed with the gender. Results: Appendix length in the control series: The length of appendix in men:7.15 The length of appendix in women:6.85 The length of appendix in both gender:6.95 cm. The length of parasitic appendix: The length of appendix in men:7.30 The length of appendix in women:6.76 The length of appendix in both gender:6.94.

Method: 50 Wistar male rats were randomized into 5 groups with 10 animals in each: Group1 -the healthy controls, 2-5 Groups were intraperitoneally introduced bacterial LPS 20 mg/kg. Group3-4 got \u00d7 105 allogeneic MSCs, Group4 -8.5 \u03bcg of recombinant EPO-beta, Group 5 -MSCs and EPO in the same doses. The morphological study of liver, spleen, thymus, lung and kidney was performed. Histological specimens were evaluated by qualitative, semiquantitative and quantitative methods. Results: In lung tissue the thickness of alveolar septums progressivly reduced from Group 3 to 5.In kidney and liver tissue the dystrophy of hepatocytes and nefrocytes and a blood vessel's dilatation in studied groups also reduced.In lien tissue we observed hyperplasia of white pulp in groups 4 and 5. Structural features of thymus were connected with patterns of T-lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation. Conclusion: Combined treatment with EPO and MSCs can reduce acute lung injury and kidney damage, cause hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue and enhance the immune response more than separate treatment in an experimental model of sepsis in rats.",

Method: A 28-year-old man, with active substance dependency, HIV-1 infection known for 7 years and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome for 3 years, was receiving tuberculostatic medication for disseminated tuberculosis and investigated for persistent fever. A liver ultrasonography confirmed a moderate hepatomegaly and showed multiple dispersed nodules in both lobes, with 1 to 3 cm of greater diameter. Results: A needle biopsy from one of the nodules showed a proliferation of spindle cells without atypia, grouped in intersecting bundles, with immunoreactivity to vimentin, CD68 and lysozyme and negative for CD34, pS100, SMA and desmin; a Ziehl-Neelsen stain revealed several acid fast bacilli in the spindle cells. They were PAS negative. Conclusion: Pseudotumoral lesions in hepatic tuberculosis usually correspond to granulomatous inflammation. A spindle cell proliferation, like that seen in other organs are more frequently associated with non tuberculous mycobacteria, is very rare. We found only another case in the literature of liver spindle cell pseudotumor associated with tuberculosis. This lesion must be differentiated from mesenchymal neoplasms.",

Method: We are presenting a 49 years old man with a 2 years history of diarrhea, malabsorption and weight lost (about 30 kg). Endoscopical examination revealed an unspecific, yet unusual pattern of lesions: small, yellow, multiple, slightly elevated patches involving duodenum and jejunum. Histological examination revealed numerous foamy macrophages in lamina propria with PAS (+), Ziehl-Neelsen (\u2212) material in cytoplasm. Results: Treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was initiated with a spectacular response: after 2 days of therapy the patient had normal stool and in 6 months he already gained back 20 kg. After 1 year of treatment the biopsy confirmed a partial remission with fewer macrophages persisting in lamina propria of duodenum. After 16 months of treatment (March 2012), very few macrophages with PAS (+) material are still identified on duodenal biopsy. Conclusion: WD is a potentially fatal disease with unspecific clinical and endoscopical signs that can be diagnosed on duodenal biopsies. Histological follow-up is a useful tool of managing the treatment and histopathological confirmation of the absence of foamy macrophages is mandatory in discontinuing therapy.",

Transurethral resection bladder tumor (TURBT) specimens showed SCUC, followed by cystoprostatectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, confirming the initial diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry was used on paraffin embedded tissue. Results: Microscopically, the tumor cells show a diffuse architectural pattern with occasional nesting, are small, uniform, with scant cytoplasm, nuclear crowding, nuclear molding, inconspicuous nucleoli and finely stippled chromatin. Numerous mitoses, Azzopardi phenomenon and foci of necrosis are present, as well as areas of urothelial carcinoma. Tumor cells are strongly (+) with Ker AE1/AE3, Cam 5.2 (dot-like perinuclear pattern), CD56 (the most consistent neuroendocrine marker), p53, ki-67(60 %), focally (+) with Synaptophysin and (\u2212) with Chromogranin, Ker34\u03b2E12, Ker7, Ker 20, TTF-1, LCA. Conclusion: Pathologic and immunohistochemical data identify SCUC. Differential diagnosis includes metastasis of a small cell carcinoma from another site",

Method: FNAs from Jan/2004 to Dec/2010 were reclassified in TBSRTC: nondiagnostic (ND), benign (B), atypia or follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS), suspicious for follicular neoplasm (FN), suspicious for malignancy (S) and malignant (M). FLUS and FN were classified according to presence of H\u00fcrthle cells as HCLUS and FN-HC. Results: A total of 828 FNAs (480 patients) were obtained: 46 ND (5.55 %), 682 B (82.). Thyroidectomies were performed in 125 patients (26 %): benign lesions in 83 (66.4 %), 7 (5.6 %) follicular adenoma and 2 (1.6 %) follicular carcinomas, 1 (0.8 %) medullary carcinoma, 21 (16.8 %) papillary carcinomas and 16 (12.8 %) papillary microcarcinomas (PMC). Risk of malignancy (RM) excluding PMC: B 1.4 %, AUS/FLUS/HCLUS 5 %, FN/FN-HC 11.1 %, SM 50 % and M 77.8 %. Conclusion: TBSRTC criteria led to more specific diagnosis.

Abe, Y. Iida, T. Onitsuka, T. Nakajima * Shizuoka Cancer Center, Pathology Division, Nagaizumi, JapanObjective: Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) is well known as a subtype of lung cancer. Our objective is to establish mucosal LCNEC (M-LCNEC) as a new entity in the head and neck regions. Method: We re-estimated 814 surgically resected specimens of the primary mucosal carcinoma in the head and neck regions during 2002-2009. The immunostainings for neuroendocrine (NE) markers such as CD56, chromogranin-A and synaptophysin were performed. In the cases, which were positive for>two NE markers, we re-diagnosed as \"M-LCNEC\". Results: Only eight cases (0.98 %) were re-diagnosed as M-LCNEC. All cases were male and their mean age was 64.6 years old. Three cases occurred in the oro-pharynx, four cases in the larynx and one case in hypopharynx. A half of the cases showed dead of disease. Histologically, M-LCNEC showed the organoid pattern growth of large basaloid cells, in which were seen the central necrosis, rosette formation, peripheral palisading, and high mitotic figures (>15/hpf). Immunohistochemically, M-LCNEC indicated to be positive for two or three NE markers. Conclusion: M-LCNEC, which occurs as mucosal lesion in the head and neck regions, indicated relatively poor outcome. We propose that M-LCNEC is a new clinico-pathlogical entity.PS-09-047 Expression of claudins \u22121, \u22123, \u22125, \u22127 and \u221211 on the progression of squamous cell carcinoma of the lip N.

Brizova, R. Kodet * University Hospital Motol, Dept. of Pathology and Molecular Medicin, Prague, Czech RepublicObjective: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are characterized by a gain of function mutations of the KIT or PDGFRA genes. Activated KIT and PDGFRA proteins are important therapeutic targets of the therapy with imatinib mesylate (IM). Although most patients with advanced GIST benefit from IM treatment, a portion of patients develop resistance to the agent. The most common mechanism of the acquired resistance of GIST is the acquisition of secondary mutations. Method: Mutation analysis was performed on genomic DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded or fresh frozen tumor tissues. Exons 9, 11, 13 and 17 of the KIT gene and exons 12, 14 and 18 of the PDGFRA gene were evaluated for mutation by PCR amplification and direct sequencing of the amplification products. Results: We analyzed 95 tumor samples acquired from 82 patients treated with IM. In 11 specimens from 7 patients we detected secondary mutations. Secondary mutations were clustered in exon 13 or exon 17 of the KIT gene. Conclusion: The acquired resistance is an important phenomenon of the targeted biological therapy failure. Molecular analysis of GISTs and detection of secondary mutations might become a clue to the design and management of second generation kinase inhibitors or alternative therapeutic strategies.

Bellan, W. Mwanda, L. Leoncini * University of Siena, Dept. Human Pathology and Oncology, Italy Objective: Immune activation of B-cells contributes to the increased frequency of B-cell malignancies observed in HIVinfected individuals. The Tat protein may participate in B-cell abnormalities as it may be released by infected cells. Tat increases the expression of specific cellular genes, as IL6, which may upregulate the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), which epigenetically regulates gene expression. Dyregulation of DNMTs results in abnormal patterns of DNA methylation, which is frequent in cancer. HIV is reported to upregulate DNMT1 expression. We have analyzed the expression of DNMTs and their regulatory microRNAs in HIV-positive tumors and in Tat-transfected cell lines. Method: HIV-positive and HIV-negative DLBCL and BL were tested for their expression of DNMTs by qRT-PCR and IHC. The expression of specific microRNAs was then investigated. The in vivo results were further confirmed in Tat-transfected human cell lines. Results: DNMTs were found upregulated both in HIV-positive primary tumors and in Tat-transfected cell lines. In accordance, the expression of specific microRNAs was found downregulated. Up-regulation of DNMTs resulted in the aberrant methylation of genes, as INK4/p16, and microRNAs. Conclusion: Dysregulation of DNA methyltransferases may result in the aberrant methylation of important tumor suppressor and cell cycle regulatory genes, eventually initiating neoplastic growth.

P\u00e1vai * UMF Targu Mures, Dept. of Anatomy, Romania Objective: The PI3K signaling pathway is antagonized by phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) activity. In human cells, the activation of PI3K signaling by mutations in PTEN can lead to activation of p53. Method: We studied immunoexpression of PTEN and p53 in 59 colon adenomas and polyps (A/P): hyperplastic polyps (HP), serrated adenomas (SA), tubular adenomas (TA), tubulo-villous adenomas (TVA), and 7 in situ carcinomas (CC), using the Ultravision Labeled Polymer System method. We established frequency (p53, PTEN) and intensity of the reaction (PTEN). Results: PTEN expression was decreased in 42 % of A/ P and in 57 % of CC. PTEN expression is more frequently lower in HP, A/P with dysplasia, A/P located in the left colon and in case of young patients. A/P are mainly p53+/PTEN+, while CC are p53+/PTEN\u2212. The majority of TA and SA are p53+/PTEN+, and HP are p53+/PTEN\u2212. Conclusion: p53 overexpression is associated with altered PTEN expression in colorectal carcinogenesis.

In MP however, the invasion by carcinoma cells caused a total or subtotal loss of Smoothelin in the cytoplasm of the smooth muscle cells. Conclusion: Expression of Smoothelin correlates to mechanical tension in the cells. The reliable difference in the IHC-expression of Smoothelinin MM and MP in normal colon is not seen in near infiltrating carcinomas.

Nikitin * Izhevsk State Medical Academy, RussiaObjective: Tumor cells immunophenotyping with the usage of flow cytofluorimetry, immunoenzymometric and immunofluorescence methods is quite expensive. The new method of cell surface antigens detection with the usage of immunological microarrays was proposed. Method: The microarray represents a solid substrate, on which the specified antibodies are immobilized in the particular places (\"stains\"). During the analysis the microarray is incubated with the cell suspension. The cells which possess determined cell surface antigens, specifically communicate within stains. Different cell surface antigens on various cells can be indentified through one microarray. Microarrays are manufactured on transparent and chemically-proof substrates and it allows to carry out the coloring of communicated cells for research with the help of light microscopy. The whole procedure can be performed on cells from the blood, bone marrow during 1-2 h. Results: With the help of microarrays we conducted researches dedicated to the study of various types of normal blood cells, cells of acute and chronic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The big spectrum of cell surface antigens and the histological types of cells which possess each type of defined antigens were simultaneously determined. Conclusion: The techniques of the combined research of cells proposed by us make microarrays convenient method for solving diagnostic and research problems.PS-12-024Epidemiology, morphology of nodal/exstranodal lymphomas in the Ural region of Russia N.

Method: We present the case of a 63 years old man with clinical diagnosis of hemorrhagic retroperitoneal tumor penetrating the tail of the pancreas, spleen, inferior cava vena and posterior gastric wall. Results: Gross examination reveals multiple whitish tumor fragments with necrosis and hemorrhage. Microscopically: round to spindle atypical cells and large non-neoplastic multinucleated giant cells infiltrating the pancreas. First impression is that it looks like a giant cell MFH infiltrating the pancreas. On closer examination we see can small areas of adenocarcinoma that have been better highlighted by citokeratin antibody. Immunohistochemically: the mononuclear tumor cells are positive for vimentin and part of them for p53 and CD68, the multinucleated giant cells are positive for CD68 and adenocarcinoma tumor cells for citokeratin. Conclusion: The diagnosis is made by the microscopic features associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma that sustains the pancreatic origin and exclude the giant cell MFH that, usually, arises in deep intramuscular soft tissue of the extremities.

Limon * Center of Oncology, Dept. of Tumor Pathology, Krak\u00f3w, Poland Objective: Tendosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) is a common neoplasm of synovium and tendon sheath. However, clonal chromosome aberrations characteristic for TGCT have been reported in no more than 30 cases. The aim of the study is a presentation of solitary TGCT with morphological, ultrastructural and cytogenetic analysis of tumour. Method: A 44 year-old male was operated on because of a nodule, localized in soft tissue of medial ankle region and attached to the tendon of flexor muscle of toes. Small fragments of fresh tumour tissue were taken for ultrastructural, flow cytometric and cytogenetic studies. Paraffin-embedded material was examined histologically and immunohistochemically. Results: Histologically, the tumor was built of ovoid and epithelioid mononuclear cells which present a moderate amount of cytoplasm and round nuclei with a single prominent nucleolus. Together with mononuclear cells, there was a moderate number of osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells, foam cells and siderophages. Both the mononuclear and multinucleated cells stained with CD68, whereas only giant cells were positive for CD45. At the ultrastructural level, mononuclear cells displayed features of both histiocyte-like and fibroblast-like cells. Cytogenetic studies detected a clonal translocation: 46, XY, t(1;2)(p13;q37)[5]/ 46, XY[6]. Conclusion: The clonal genetic aberrations support the concept of neoplastic nature of the TGCT.

To discriminate Luminal A and Luminal B Her2 negative tumors we used the Mitotic Activity Index with a cut-off of \u226510 for high proliferation (WHO 2003, Baak 2008). Agreement rates of CB and SSP and positive predictive values (PPV) of CB based IBCS were calculated. Results: IBCS of SSP came out with 52 % Luminal A, 22 % Luminal B Her2neg, 6 % Luminal B Her2+, 2 % Her2+, 11 % Triple-negative, and 8 % Special Type. The CB/SSPagreement rate of IBCS was complete with exception of Luminal B with only 33 %. Accordingly, the PPV of CB based Luminal A was 78 % whereas IBCS for all other types was 100 %. Both exceptions are due to underestimation of proliferation in CB. Conclusion: Agreement of IBCS in CB and SSP and the PPVs of CB based IBCS are generally high. This means that IBCS on CB specimen can be used for preoperative decision making in the vast majority of cases.PS-17-032 HER2 testing in Russia: The results of the 10 years of experience.

Method: Two cases of adenomyoepithelioma of the breast with malignant transformation by monophasic spindle population of cells are presented in a 56 and 41 year old patient respectivelly.Results: The underlying benign adenomyoepithelioma with typical biphasic architectural pattern was identified and represented at least 30 % of the tumor volume in each case. In both cases, malignant portion of tumor was composed of relatively uniform monophasic population of highly atypical cells. The malignant component in case 1 was positive for pan-cytokeratin, myoepithelial markers, and basal-type cytokeratins and also focally positive for luminal-type of cytokeratins; but negative for hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone) and HER-2/neu protein overexpression. The malignant component in case 2 was positive for spectrum of myoepithelial markers but negative for luminal cytokeratins and hormone receptors and HER-2/neu protein overexpression. Conclusion: The bilinear immunophenotype in the case 1 suggests that the malignant tumor may have developed from precursor multipotent stem cells that can differentiate into both luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells, while malignant component in case 2 appears to be the of pure myoepithelial phenotype.PS-17-079Primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the breast: Can it be suspected on histomorphologic grounds?

Therefore, we analyzed the immunotopographical distribution of cells expressing markers of dendritic cells and macrophages in thymus. Method: In paraffin sections of postnatal thymuses were performed immunostainings for S-100, CD1a, CD207 (langerin), CD11c, CD123, CD68 and CD163. The Streptavidin-Biotin Peroxidase labeled (LSAB) and the double LSAB/Alkaline Phosphatase/anti-Alkaline Phosphatase (APAAP) immunohistochemical procedures were used. Results: S100, CD1a, CD207, CD11c and CD123 positive cells, many of them with morphology of dendritic cells, were detected in the cortex and mainly in the medulla. These markers, except CD123, were also detected in cells of juvenile and immature Hassall Bodies (HB). CD68 and CD163 positive cells were detected in the cortex and the medulla but not in HB. Conclusion: The immunohistological detection of S100, CD1a, CD207 and CD11c positive dendritic cells in juvenile and immature HB may reflect an important role of HB in the cooperation of epithelial and dendritic cells in the process of T-cell differentiation.PS-20-005 Primary thymic carcinoma: Report of three cases P.

Otani * , Y. Wada, S. Izui * Centre M\u00e9dical Universitaire, Dept. of Pathol. Immunology, Geneva, Switzerland Objective: IgA nephropathy is known to be associated with structural aberrations of O-linked glycans in the IgA1 hinge region. We explored the nephritogenic potential of two different monoclonal IgA anti-IgG2a rheumatoid factors (RF) in relation to the possible presence of O-linked glycans in their hinge regions. Method: 6-19 or 46-42 IgA hybridoma was implanted into BALB/c mice, and serum levels of RF and renal lesions were assessed. The oligosaccharide profiles of both IgA RFs were analyzed by the MALDI linear-TOF MS. Results: In parallel to increases in serum levels of IgA RF, mice implanted with 6-19 IgA, but not 46-42 IgA, hybridoma developed acute glomerular lesions within 2-3 weeks. They were characterized by mesangial expansion with mesangial cell proliferation and IgA deposits accompanied by IgG2a and C3 deposition. The analysis of oligosaccharide structures revealed the presence of highly galactosylated O-linked glycans in the hinge region of 6-19 IgA, but not 46-42 IgA. Conclusion: Glomerular lesions resembling human IgA nephropathy were induced by 6-19 IgA anti-IgG2a RF, which is highly O-glycosylated in its hinge region. This experimental model could provide a useful tool to better define the immunopathological mechanisms critically involved in the development of himan IgA nephropathy.

Alterations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) expression may be involved in tumor regression. Method: We analyzed 35 cases of superficial spreading melanomas (22 cases with regression -6 segmentary regression (SR), 8 partial regression (PR) and 8 segmentary&partial regression (SPR); 13 cases with no regression ((NR); we investigated MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP11 and MMP13 immunohistochemical expression in both NR cases and nonregressed&regressed component in melanoma with regression. Results: MMP1 presented significantly lower expression in nonregressed component in both SPR and SR + SPR groups versus NR (P=0.041 and P=0.050); similar results were recorded in PRvsNR cases for MMP11 (P=0.037); all the other MMPs had similar expression in nonregressed component (irrespective of regression type) and NR. Nonregressed versus regressed component analysis in the same tumor identified overexpression of MMP3, MMP11 and MMP13 in nonregressed component (P < 0.05).Conclusion: Regression in melanoma is correlated with diminishing expression of MMP3, MMP11 and MMP13 in regressed component; certain types of regression associate MMP1 and MMP11 underexpression in nonregressed tumor.

Ramirez * Hospital Clinic Barcelona, Dept. de Anatomia Patologia, Spain Objective: There is an increasing number of bone needle aspirations. To evaluate the accuracy of this technique in the diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma we performed this study. Method: Retrospective series of patients with needle study of bone lesions, either by cytology (FNA) or biopsy (Core) that were diagnosed as metastatic bone disease, between 2003 and 2011. Results: The study included 167 CT-guided needle specimens (156 patients). Bone needle aspiration biopsy showed metastatic carcinoma in 153 aspirates (92 %). In 83.76 % of FNA we made the diagnosis of Metastasis: 40.8 % without specific site of origin & 59.2 % Specific site. On the other hand, in 94.25 % of Core we made the diagnosis of Metastasis: 14.6 % without specific origin & 85.4 % with specific site. Thus, the primary tumors were identified in 115 cases (68.9 %), with the aid of Immunohistochemistry (CK7 and CK20). In 2003 there were just 4 Core within the total number of 27 aspirates, but in 2011 there were 20 Core over a total number of 26. Conclusion: In patients with metastasis to bone, the needle biopsy is a very effective technique. The best results obtained in Core diagnosis can explain the upraising number of such procedures over the last 10 years.",

Solakoglu, L. Tunc, S. Percinel, S. Dizbay Sak,  A.  Kayi Cangir, C. Ates * Ankara University, TurkeyObjective: Intraoperative consultations are indicated to influence the type, nature and extent of surgery. The aim of the current study was to compare frozen section (FS) and final histological diagnoses (FHD) of thoracic surgery specimens and to investigate discordant diagnoses to enhance diagnostic accuracy of FS. Method: The diagnoses obtained by FS and FHD were compared in thoracic surgery specimens between 2005 and 2011 retrospectively. Specimen sites were divided into five groups (thorax/supradiaphragm, diaphragm, subdiaphragm, resection margins and lymph nodes) according to the indications of intraoperative consultations. Sensitivity and specificity of FS were calculated. Results: A total of 2949 (99.6 %) FS diagnoses and 2580 (87.2 %) FHD were obtained in 1612 patients. Concordance between FS diagnoses and FHD was 98 % for malignant and 97.5 % for benign categories. 15.3 % of intraoperative consultations were deferred. While 16 diagnoses were regarded as \"overdiagnosis\", 35 were interpreted as \"underdiagnosis\". Sensitivity and specificity of FS diagnosis and AUC (95 % confidence interval) were calculated to be 0.92, 0.94 and 0.9817 (0.9760-0.9861), respectively according to Binormal ROC Curve. Discordant diagnoses were mostly due to sampling errors and misinterpretation.

This is the first study to assess the surface marker and mucin phenotype in first degree relatives of gastric cancer patients. Method: 48 patients were prospectively recruited at out institution. Sections of gastric mucosa were stained immunohistochemically for CD10, MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC and MUC6, and scored based on stain extent and intensity. Results: Expression of CD10 was intermediate in 8 and 5 controls (p=0.02). MUC1 in superficial glands was intermediate in 12, high in 7 (p=0.015). In the deep glands MUC1 expression was intermediate in 8 and 2 controls, and high in 32 and 6 controls (p=0.66). One case show intermediate MUC2. MUC5AC expression was high in superficial mucosa in all cases and controls, and in the deep glands was intermediate in 8 and 2 controls (p =0.67). MUC6 was absent in superficial glands of all cases and controls, but highly expressed in deep glands. H. pylori was found in 8 cases and 2 controls (p=0.67). Conclusion: Gastric CD10 expression is reduced and MUC1 expression is increased in first degree relatives of gastric cancer patients. Primary gastric choriocarcinoma: Two case reports S. Haraoka * , A. Iwashita, I. Iwashita * Fukuoka University, Chikushi Hospital, Chikushino, JapanObjective: Choriocarcinoma is a malignant neoplasm secreting \u03b2-hCG that grows rapidly and metastasizes widely. Primary gastric choriocarcinoma is very rare. We report two cases of primary gastric choriocarcinoma, one of which combined with adenocarcinoma. Method: Two patients are 73-year-old woman and 77-yearold man. Gastroscopy revealed the protruded tumors with ulceration approximately 8.5 cm and 5 cm in size, respectively. In both cases, urine \u03b2-hCG was high. Both patients died 8 months and 1.5 months after the initial diagnosis due to distant metastasis. Results: Histological examination confirmed the choriocarcinoma composed of intimate admixtures of cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts, associated with hemorrhage and necrosis. In one case, a small area of well to moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma was contiguous to the choriocarcinoma component with relatively well-defined. The choriocarcinoma foci and adjacent adenocarcinomatous area showed positive immunoreactivity for \u03b2-hCG, but negative for CEA. However, adenocarcinoma component was positive for CEA, but negative for \u03b2-hCG. Conclusion: In coexistent choriocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the stomach, a transitional form of tumor cells is occasionally found, so that a retrodifferentiation theory from adenocarcinoma to choriocarcinoma is supposed.PS-06-027Gastrointestinal stromal tumors and rare synchronous neoplasms A. C. Iorgescu * , E. Stoica-Mustafa, C. Pechianu, V. Herlea * Fundeni Clinical Institute, Dept. of Pathology, Bucharest, RomaniaObjective: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are mezenchimal tumors which originatte from interstitial cells of Cajal or related stem cells from the gastrointestinal wall and have a typical immunoreactivity for CD117(c-kit protein). Their association with other gastrointestinal tumors has been reported rarely in literature most frequently with adenocarcinoma or lymphoma and less with neuroendocrine tumors or squamous cell carcinoma. Method: We present two cases of synchronous tumors. Results: First case is that of a 73 years old man who underwent surgery for gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma accompanied by a gastric stromal tumor. The second case refers to a 74 years old male with squamous cell carcinoma in the middle third of the esofagus coexisting with gastric stromal tumor with a very low risk.Conclusion: In literature there are reported less then 30 cases of sinchronous gastrointestinal stromal tumors with neuroendocrine tumors or scuamous cell carcinoma. A multidisciplinary approach is vital for treatment succes. The number of metastatic lymph nodes in adenocarcinoma of ampulla of Vater as a prognostic factor H.-J. Kang * , S.-H. Eo, E.-S. Yu, H. Cho, S.-M. Hong * Asan Medical Center, Dept. of Pathology, Seoul, Republic of Korea Objective: Although the increase of the number of lymph node (LN) metastasis indicates worse prognosis in carcinomas from other gastrointestinal tract organs, the prognostic implication of the number of metastatic LNs has not been well characterized in adenocarcinomas of ampulla of Vater (AAs).Method: The number of metastatic LNs was evaluated with 1058 surgically resected AAs having at least 12 examined lymph nodes from the population based SEER database. A complex pattern of survival versus the metastatic LNs was captured by censored local regression. The effect of metastatic LNs on patient's survival time was investigated by the adaptive partitioning algorithm for identifying the most significant cutoff points of metastatic LNs. Results: Two significant cutoff points (0 and 2) for the metastatic LNs were identified. These cutoff points segregated the patients into 3 groups with the statistically significant difference in median survival (no metastatic LNs, 478 cases, median survival time, 99 months; 1-2 metastatic LNs, 279 cases, 29 months; >3 metastatic LNs, 301 cases, 19 months, p<0.01). Conclusion: On the basis of the present results, we propose that the nodal classification of AAs should be further classified into N0 (no metastatic LNs), N1 (1-2 metastatic LNs) and N2 (>3 metastatic LNs). Correlation of expression of yes-associated protein and phosphorylated yes-associated protein with clinicopathologic parameters in esophageal squamous cell carcinomaK.-H. Kim * , J.-M. Kim, K.-S. Song * Chungnam National University, Cancer Research Institute, Daejeon, Republic of KoreaObjective: Yes-associated protein (YAP) has been investigated in carcinomas as a candidate human oncogene serving as a transcription co-activator in nucleus. The phosphorylated form of YAP (pYAP) locates to the cytoplasm, preventing cellular proliferation by spatially segregating YAP from the nucleus. Method: Samples from 142 patients of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) were studied using immunohistochemistry for YAP, pYAP and Ki-67. Results: In 142 cases of ESCC, higher nuclear expression of YAP was correlated with tumor diameter, pathologic T category (1 versus 2-4), pathologic TNM stage (I versus II-IV) and Ki-67 expression in univariate analyses. Higher nuclear expression of YAP was significantly associated with worse overall and disease-free survival from Kaplan-Meier plots. Multivariate analysis showed higher nuclear expression of YAP to be an independent prognostic marker for overall survival. The cytoplasmic expression of pYAP in ESCC was not correlated with Ki-67 expression and was higher than in the normal esophageal epithelium, whereas nuclear expression of pYAP was not different in the two tissues. Conclusion: Our results suggest that YAP shifts from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as a consequence of phosphorylation and is inactivated in ESCC. The nuclear expression of YAP is correlated with tumor growth and is an independent predictor for a worse prognosis of ESCC.PS-06-031Oesophageal metastasis from ovarian serous adenocarcinoma:A case report M.-M. Koumpanaki * , P. Xirou, E. Michalopoulou, B. Christoforidou, S. Barbanis, N. Vladika, F. Patakiouta * Thessaloniki, GreeceObjective: Oesophagus is an uncommon site of metastases, mainly originating from lung and breast. Ovarian carcinomas usually metastasize to pelvic structures and peritoneum and only two cases of ovarian metastasis to the oesophagus have been reported in the literature. We report a rare case of metastatic ovarian serous adenocarcinoma to the esophagus. Method: Our patient, a 67 year-old woman, was diagnosed with carcinoma of the left ovary 8 years ago. She received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent total hysterectomy. After a disease free interval of 5 years she complained of progressive dysphagia. An oesophageal biopsy was taken endoscopically. Results: Microscopic examination showed infiltration of oesophageal mucosa by a moderately to poorly differentiated papillary adenocarcinoma, immunohistochemically positive for CK8/18, CK7, CA-125 and WT-1. Morphological and immunohistochemical features of the neoplasm were consistent with metastatic ovarian serous adenocarcinoma to the esophagus. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy and was free of symptoms for 2 years, until recently, when her condition dramatically worsened.Conclusion: Oesophageal metastases are rare, constituting approximately 2,7 % of malignant oesophageal neoplasms, and must be differentiated from primary tumours. Metastatic neoplasms may reach the oesophagus by haematogenous or lymphatic dissemination. Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice and ultimate prognosis is poor. Lazar * , S.Taban, A. Dema, M. Cornianu, F. Baderca, D. Koukoulas, A. Goldis, I. Sporea * University of Medicine, Pathology, Timisoara, Romania Objective: Recently, the pathological aspects implicated in \"Correa's cascade\" of gastric carcinogenesis were assessed. Method: Our batch: 61 gastric cancer patients,43 males,18 females, average age=59.34 years. Witness group: antral biopsies from 96 patients with dyspeptic syndrome. We assessed the incidence of premalignant lesions. Results: Gastric carcinomas: intestinal type(IT)(62.3 %), diffuse type(DT)(27.9 %), and mixed type(MT)(9.8 %). IT develop on the background of atrophic chronic gastritis (ACG)(65.8 %), with intestinal metaplasia(IM). ACG: more frequent in IT vs. DT(65.8 % vs.29.4 %, p=0.0122). IM: significantly more frequently in IT(68.Our observations sustain the different histogenesis of cancers divided after Lauren classification and the etiopathogenic role of H.pylori in the development of gastric carcinomas. Assessment of type III IM is useful in early diagnosis of gastric cancer. The role of endo-biopsy in evaluating inflammatory and pre-neoplastic gastric lesions D. C. Lazar * , S. Taban, A. Dema, M. Cornianu, E. Lazar, F. Baderca, A. Goldis, I. Sporea * University of Medicine, Pathology, Timisoara, RomaniaObjective: Our aim was to assess the concordance between the endoscopic and histopathologic diagnosis of gastritis. Method: We included 96 dyspeptic patients; according to the Sydney system, we designed a protocol for description of endoscopic lesions and taking of the biopsies. years were. More severe gastritis: gastric body vs. antrum (p=0.041). In patients with endoscopic antral gastritis, histological confirmation had: sensitivity 97.9 %, specificity 50 %, PPV 98.9 %, NPV 33.3 %. In patients with endoscopic aspect of body gastritis, histological confirmation had: sensitivity 41.3 %, specificity 100 %, PPV 100 %, NPV 6.897 %. Infection with H. pylori:51 % of antral and 37.5 % of gastric body biopsies. Most cases of erosive antral gastritis, diffuse erythematous and petechial body gastritis were H. pylori(+). In some cases the endoscopy was normal, but histopathological examination identified H.pylori. Atrophy:48 % of antral and 54.2 % of gastric body biopsies, more frequent in older patients. Histopathological exam is mandatory for the diagnosis of gastritis, identifying pre-neoplastic lesions and confirmation of H.pylori.No concordance between endoscopic and histologic diagnosis of atrophy.PS-06-034 Coexistence of Mixed Adenocarcinoma with Neuroendocrine tumor G1 (MANEC) and Leiomyomas of the stomach M.-A. Lianou * , C. Magkou, M.-E. Kopaka, M. Chantziara, P. Kara, E. Gioti, D. Riga, M. Konstantinou, C. Lariou * Athens, GreeceObjective: Mixed adenocarcinoma of the stomach with a NET as the neurondocrine component of the tumor is rare, as well as intramural leiomyomas. We present a case of a combined mixed epithelial carcinoma and neuroendocrine tumor with a random finding of mesenchymal tumor. Method: A 72 year-old male came to our hospital complaining of abdominal pain. Endoscopic biopsy revealed the presence of invasive adenocarcinoma and a total gastrectomy was performed. Results: The histopathological report concluded the presence of MANEC. The neuroendocrine component comprised a NeuroEndocrine Tumor (NET) G 1, which showed a strong immunoreaction to Chromogranin A, Synaptophysin and CD56 and none to Gastrin, Serotonin and ACTH. Mitotic rate, Ki-67 measured 1 %. The immunohistochemical control of the exocrine component was positive for CK7, CK20. That of the incidental finding of four small leiomyomas was positive for a-SMA and Desmin and negative for CD117, DOG-1 and CD34. Conclusion: Gastric MANEC with a NET G1 component is a rare tumor. Gastric leiomyomas are also considered a rare finding. The coexistence of the two different neoplasms is even rarer, thus making it an interesting case report.Mel\u00e9ndez * , F. Climent, M. J. Pa\u00fales, M. Varela, J. M. Botargues, F. Rodriguez, E. Condom * Bellvitge Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, L\u00b4Hospitalet de Llobregat, SpainObjective: Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) in celiac disease (CD) are CD3+ and CD8+ and exhibit a polyclonal profile for T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement. In contrast, refractory CD (RCD) may be subdivided into type I (IELs polyclonal and normal phenotype) or type II (IELs monoclonal and/or aberrant phenotype). The aim was to analyze the RCD cases in our institution. Method: The clinical, pathological, immunophenotypical and molecular findings of 12 RCD cases were reviewed. Results: Our series comprised 7 men and 5 women with a median age of 57 years (range: 20-76). One patient had RCDI and 11 patients had RCDII. Six patients presented with no prior clinical or biopsy evidence of gluten sensitivity. Three patients developed RCDII after a history of CD of 12, 60 and 144 months and 1 of them developed EATL. Two patients presented IEL and EATL simultaneously. Phenotype was aberrant in 8 out of 11 and TCR was monoclonal in 10 out of 10 tested cases. Conclusion: In our series, 6 cases presented as RCDII de novo. The IEL phenotype study and the TCR rearrangement were useful for identifying cases with RCD. Molaei * , F. Lahmi, S. R. Fatemi, M. R.

            "text": "Conclusion: GCP is a unique type of chronic gastritis represented by a sessile elevated lesion along a suture line, occurring a long time after Billroth-II surgery or simple gastrojejunal anastomosis. When these findings are considered, it may be reasonable to speculate that there are close relationships among DGR, GCP and gastric stump carcinomas. Nour * , B. Y. Lamia, B. Wassila, B. Nizar, B. Khedija, D. Mohamed Hedi, S. Attafi * FSI, Gastroenterology, Tunis, TunisiaObjective: Primary gastric Hodgkin's lymphoma is reported in only 2 % of patients with primary gastric lymphomas. Most cases are observed in the course of systemic disease. Method: We report a case of Hodgkin's lymphoma that was complicated by gastrosplenic fistula manifesting as upper gastro-intestinal hemorrhage. Results: We report the case of a 52 years old man with a 10 years history of untreated Hodgkin's lymphoma. He was hospitalized for a massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The gastroscopy showed a large malignant ulcer of the small curve of the stomach. A gastric fistula on the posterior fundus was objectived. Histological examination of biopsies taken showed the ulcer to be benign and the edges of the orifice of the fistula to be Hodgkin lymphoma by detection of Reed Sternberg cells. A panel of immunohistochemical markers were stained for. A predominant expression of CD30 and CD15 were seen in the cells while being negative of CD3 and EMA. An abdominal CT demonstrated a cavitary splenic lesion with an air-fluid level and extravasation of gastric contrast into the hilum of the spleen, consistent with a gastrosplenic fistula. The diagnosis of gastrosplenic fistula from Hodgkin's lymphoma was made. Conclusion: Gastrosplenic fistula is an unusual occurrence and should be recognized as a possible complication of Hodgkin's lymphoma with splenic or gastric involvement. Oz Atalay * , G. Ozgun, O. Yerci * Uludag University, Dept. of Pathology, Bursa, TurkeyObjective: Tumors of the duodenum commonly arise around the ampulla of Vater, and most common tumor type is adenocarcinoma. A review of the English literature revealed a few cases of pure squamous cell carcinoma of the duodenum and only one case of adenosquamous carcinoma. Here, we reported a primary adenosquamous carcinoma of duodenum unrelated to papilla vateri.Method: A fifty-seven years old female was admitted to our hospital with weakness, constipation and back pain after meals. The endoscopic examination revealed a duodenal tumor distal to the ampulla of vater. Computed tomography also detected a mass in the head of the pancreas. After the endoscopic biopsy of duodenum was reported as 'adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation', Whipple procedure was performed. Results: Macroscopically, tumoral lesion was seen in duodenum, 2 cm distal to the papilla vateri, infiltrating the adjacent pancreatic tissue. Distal stomach and papilla vateri were tumor-free. Microscopic examination revealed adenosquamous carcinoma, and immunohistochemical-histochemical studies displayed the two different component of the tumor. One peripancreatic lymph node was metastatic. Conclusion: Adenosquamous carcinoma is an extremely rare tumor of duodenum. Only one case has been published in the literature so far. Although we assume that it may derived from the pluripotent stem cells, its exact pathogenesis is still unclear.PS-06-040Significance of mucin expression patterns, EGFR expression and HER2 expression/amplification in gastric carcinoma E. E. Pala * , U. Bayol, O. Akman, A. Ozguzer, S. M. Dogan * Tepecik Training and Research Hospital, Izmir, TurkeyObjective: The gastric carcinomas with MUC1 expression are more likely to be advanced stage. MUC5AC is expressed in diffuse type, MUC2 is expressed in mucinous carcinoma. EGFR overexpression commonly leads to radiation resistance. HER2 gene amplification has been detected in 10-20 % of gastric adenocarcinomas. Expression of these markers are important to predict clinical outcome and targeted therapy modalities. Method: Fifty-five patients were included to clarify the relationship between histopathologic features and immuno-Conclusion: Although we studied a small group, all the results were concordant with the literature data.PS-06-041 HER2 status in gastric cancer: A comparison of two novel in situ hybridization methods (IQ FISH and dual colour SISH) and two immunohistochemistry methods (A0485 and Herceptest) E. E. Pala * , U. Bayol, A. Ozguzer, O. Akman * Tepecik Training and Research Hospital, Izmir, TurkeyObjective: Contrary to breast HER2 testing, optimal ISH method and antibody for gastric HER2 testing is unclear. The aim of the study was to examine HER2 status in gastric adenocarcinomas comparing rabbit polyclonal antibody A0485 and Herceptest immunohistochemistry (IHC) with dual probe HER2 IQ fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and fully automated dual colour silver in situ hybridization (SISH) methods. Method: IHC and ISH were carried out on gastrectomy specimens of 88 patients. +++) in 12 cases by A0485 IHC. IHC (+) 3cases and (++) 3 cases were (\u2212) by Herceptest. IHC (\u2212) amplified one case was (++) by herceptest. All A0485 and Herceptest (+++) 12 cases were amplified and HER2 amplification was detected in 15.9 % of the cases by SISH and FISH. IHC (+) two cases showed focal heterogeneous low level amplification by SISH and IHC (++) 2 cases also showed focal amplification by FISH and SISH. Conclusion: In focal amplified cases it's diffucult to decide if the percentage of the amplified cells meet the '10 %' cut off value. The concordance between HercepTest/A0485 IHC and ISH is perfect in (+++) cases. But (+)/(++) rates are lower and less related with amplification in HercepTest than routine IHC. Pehlivanoglu * , B. Doganavsargil, M. Sezak, B. Sarsik, S. Sen * Ege University Medical School, Dept. of Pathology, Izmir, Turkey Objective: Amyloidosis is characterized by localized or systemic amyloid deposition. Although rectal biopsies are generally preferred for diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis, upper gastrointestinal tract is not infrequently involved. However, less is known about the presence, distribution and intensity of amyloid deposition (AD) in gastric biopsies. Method: Hematoxylin-eosine (HE) sections of endoscopic biopsies of 77 patients with systemic amyloidosis were reevaluated and Congo-red staining was used for definitive diagnosis. muscular and stromal AD. Stromal involvement was only seen in widely distributed cases. ADs tended to involve more than one localization as intensity increased (p<0.0001, chi-square). Conclusion: Upper gastrointestinal involvement is frequently seen in systemic amyloidosis. AD can be either vascular, stromal or muscular and easily be detected by HE.PS-06-043 Histopathological aspects of gastric neuroendocrine tumors with and without lymph nodes metastases and prognostic significance O. B. Popescu * , E. Stoica Mustafa, C. Pechianu, M. Hortopan, C. Stroescu, S. O. Dima, T. Dumitrascu, V. Herlea * Bucharest, Romania Objective: Gastric NETs are uncommon tumors with increasing incidence in the latest decades. The aim of this study was the histopathological analysis of 8 cases. Method: We present 8 cases of gastric NETs (surgical resected) diagnosed in Fundeni Clinical Institute between 2005 and 2011, reviewed according to the WHO 2010. The The type and stage of the gastric NETs are among the most important things for best management. With an exact diagnosis and adequate treatment has improved the prognosis. New players in gastric carcinogenesis induced by Helicobacter pylori? C. Popp * , G. Micu, S. Zurac, A. Bastian, L. Nichita, M. Olariu, T. Tebeica, A. Birceanu, R. Mateescu, F. Staniceanu * Colentina University Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Bucharest, RomaniaObjective: Popp and Micu are first authors in equal proportions Helicobacter Pylori (HP) induces a continuum of lesions (chronic gastritis, glandular atrophy, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasiacarcinogenetic cascade [CC]) evolving towards intestinal type gastric carcinoma, but also potentially reversible after HP eradication. Method: Our study included 3069 gastric endoscopic biopsies diagnosed using Sydney criteria by two independent fully trained pathologists. We evaluated several histopathological parameters, correlating the degree of inflammation, atrophy, metaplasia, regenerative hyperplasia and dysplasia with the presence of HP infection. Results: Some of our results confirmed theory of HP-triggered CC, several data suggesting the idea that there are understudied factors involved in modulating carcinogenesis. Correlations of intestinal metaplasia and activity of gastritis showed that the number of neutrophils is directly proportional with extension of intestinal metaplasia and inverse proportional with gastric atrophy (P=1.01028E-07), suggesting that the presence of neutrophils is the trigger of phenotype alterations leading to metaplasia. Simultaneous presence of numerous eosinophil granulocytes and very few neutrophils was identified associated with mild or absent intestinal metaplasia, supporting the idea that eosinophils favor regenerative changes to the detriment of intestinal metaplasia.Conclusion: This study identifies histopathologically quantifiable factors interfering in carcinogenesis which can influence management of HP infected patients.PS-06-045Gastric carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells C. Poulios * , T. Koletsa, G. Karagianopoulou, E. Vrettou, I. Kostopoulos * AHEPA Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Thessaloniki, GreeceObjective: Throughout the vast variety of gastric neoplasms, gastric carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells (OGCs) is one of the rarest. To the best of our knowledge only 9 other cases have been reported in the English literature. We present a case of gastric carcinoma with OGCs in an 81 year-old male patient. Method: We received a specimen of subtotal gastrectomy and lower esophagectomy. At the gastro-esophageal junction an exophytic tumor, 2.2 cm in greatest diameter, was observed. Multiple sections from the tumor were examined histologically and immunohistochemically. Results: Sections from the tumor showed gastric carcinoma of intestinal type, stage pT1bpN0. Diffusely among the neoplastic cells giant multinuclear cells, resembling osteoclasts, were observed. Those cells were positive for CD68, lysozyme, vimentin and negative for AE1/AE3, CK8/18, hHCG and LMP1. Moreover in a random section from the gastric fundus a spindle cell lesion was revealed, which was positive for CD117 and CD34 and was diagnosed as GIST. Conclusion: The presence of OGCs is an extremely rare finding in gastric carcinomas. Due to the low number of reported cases its prognostic value is under discussion. Furthermore this is the first reported case of co-existence with GIST.PS-06-046Assessment of human papillomavirus DNA in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma S. Saadi * , H. Piessevaux, P. Deprez, A.

Patsouris * University of Athens, 1st Dept. of Pathology, GreeceObjective: MAPK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase) pathway is considered a control regulator in various malignant tumors. In our study we examined the possible prognostic significance of MAPK pathway in Greek patients with esophageal cancer. Method: We searched for mutations in exons 18, 19, 20, 21 of EGFR gene, codons 12 and 13 of K-RAS gene and exon 15 of B-RAF gene by High Resolution Melting Analysis (HRMA) and Pyrosequencing in 44 esophageal carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 29 cases in order to evaluate expression levels of pERK (Extracellular -signal Regulated Kinase). Results: A somatic K-RAS mutation at codon 12 was detected in one laser microdissected squamous cell carcinoma, whereas none of the cases displayed mutations in EGFR and B-RAF genes. Elevated nuclear as well as cytoplasmic pERK expression (100 % and 62 % of cases respectively) was observed independently of EGFR and B-RAF mutational status. Increasing pERK nuclear and cytoplasmic expression as well as the intensity of nuclear staining was found to be significantly correlated with tumor grade in univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the presence of activated ERK despite the low frequency of upstream alterations, implicating ERK activation in the acquisition of a more aggressive phenotype in esophageal cancer. Silva * , J. M. Lopes, F. Carneiro, C. Souto Moura * Centro Hospitalar de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e2o, Servi\u00e7o de Anatomia Patol\u00f3gica, Porto, Portugal Objective: Gastroblastoma is a recently described gastric tumour that occurs in children and young adults, displaying epitheliomesenchymal biphasic features. Method: An 18-year-old female, asymptomatic until 4 months before admission, complained of abdominal pain. Imaging evaluation disclosed a solid and cystic tumour involving the stomach. The surgical specimen displayed a nodular, solid and cystic tumour with 10.5 cm largest dimension. Histologically, the tumour was biphasic with epithelial and predominantly mesenchymal components. The epithelial component was arranged in nests, cords and tubules; the mesenchymal component comprised short bundles of spindle cells, foci of multinucleated cells and variable myxoid/collagenous stroma. Tumour cell atypia was mild and mitotic index low. There was no evidence of lymphovascular/perineural tumour invasion. Lymph nodes were free of metastases. Immunohistochemically, epithelial cells expressed AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, CD56 and, focally, CD10; mesenchymal cells expressed vimentin, CD10 and, focally, CD56. Altogether, these features support the diagnosis of gastroblastoma. Conclusion: Gastroblastoma is a rare tumour (only 4 cases reported so far byMiettinen et al., 2009 and Shin et al.,  2010). In the differential diagnosis, synovial sarcoma, carcinosarcoma and teratoma should be considered. Gastroblastoma behavior remains unsettled, having been suggested to be a low-grade malignant tumour. Stoica-Mustafa * , C. Pechianu, V. Herlea* Fundeni Clinical Institute, Dept. of Pathology, Bucharest, Romania Objective: Mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas (MANECs, WHO,2010) of the gastrointestinal tract are rare neoplasms, presenting at least 30 % of each component. Aim: To increase the awareness of MANECs in gastrointestinal tract carcinomas. Method: We present a series of four cases of gastrointestinal MANECs admitted in Fundeni Clinical Institute (2007-2010)-two of the stomach, one of the colon and one of the choledocus.Results: All of the patients were males with the age range between 38 and 62 years. All of them underwent surgical resections. The tumors varying in size from 1 cm (choledocus) to 12 cm (stomach); all of them were infiltrative, invading the adjacent organs (except one case of the stomach). Microscopically, the tumors had two distinct components: adenocarcinoma with varied grade of differentiation (G1-G3) and neuroendocrine carcinoma, grade 2 or 3. One case had mixed lymph node metastases. The immunohistochemistry were performed in all cases and included panCK, CK7, 19, 20pozitive in epithelial component, Chromogranine, Synaptophysine, NSE-pozitive in neuroendocrine component and Ki67. One of the patients died in 2 days after surgery, other three were alive at the time of report. Conclusion: Gastrointestinal MANECs constitute a diagnostic challenge because of frequent identification only of one component of the neoplasm, which leads to an incomplete diagnosis and suboptimal treatment.Objective: GIST and adenocarcinoma combination are rare diseases, mechanism of its development is not clear. Histogenesis and morphogenesis of these oncological pathology discuss. Method: We have 3 cases of GIST and adenocarcinoma of the gaster, colon during 2000-2012 year. Clinico-morphological analysis was performed. Histological, imminohistochemical, histochemical techniques were used. Results: GIST demonstrated spindle-like and epithelioid types tumours, invading wall of the gaster with secondary changes (hemorrhages, necrosis, infalammation). In 1 case we found metastasis of GIST in gastric lymphatic nodes. Sizes of tumours were more than 5 cm in diameter. Adenocarcinoma was tubular, mucous types of the colon with deep invasive character of growth all wall the colon. Conclusion: We concider that combination of GIST of the gaster and adenocarcinoma of the colon have common pathogenesis. Cells of the GIST have multifunctional capacities. Combination of the GIST and adenocarcinoma can reflect mutations of the genes participating in its development but this position need to future investigation. Tomic * , I. Mrklic, A. Bendic, N.

Veits * , R. Wirtz, J. Drgac, T. Schulz, M. Vieth, R. Rieker * Klinikum Bayreuth, Institut f\u00fcr Pathologie, GermanyObjective: Lymphocytic oesophagitis is a poorly understood disease of unknown origin, said to be characterized by an epithelial infiltration of lymphocytes. Up to date only few and non-specific histological changes were described. Method: We collected 37 biopsies of 32 patients with lymphocytic oesophagitis (20 men, 12 women). Grading was done according to Purdy et al. and by the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (50/HPF as cut off value). The inflammatory cells were characterized by using the t-cell and chemokine STRATIFYER robot (STRATIFYER Molecular Pathology GmbH, Cologne, Germany). Results: Apoptotic keratinocytes could be detected in 71,4 % of severe cases (15/21) as well as in 25 % of mild cases (4/16) and were found in all epithelial layers. High levels of cytotoxic T-cells were present in 80 % of severe cases with apoptosis (12/15) and in 5 cases without apoptosis, mostly mild cases. Conclusion: Our data show that apoptosis is usefull in grading of lymphocytic oesophagitis, as it can be found predominantely in severe forms. Due to the presence of cytotoxic T-cells an underlying form of lichenoid inflammation can not be fully excluded in these cases. Further studies should focus on the question, whether our findings are a hint to an autoimmunologic mechanism or not.Objective: The homeobox protein CDX2 is a transcription factor involved in early intestinal differentiation and regulates the transcription of several intestinal genes, including intestinal mucin (MUC2). The genetic events responsible for the transdifferentiation that occurs in intestinal metaplasia (IM) are not well understood.Method: In the 6 year period between 2005 and 2010 a 152 gastric biopsies were examined at the Pathology Department of VNMU. Our panel of primary monoclonal antibodies included: CDX2 (1:100; DAKO, Denmark), anti-MUC5AC (1:100; Novocastra, UK), anti-MUC2 (1:100; Novocastra, UK), anti-MUC6 (1:100; Novocastra, UK).Results: CDX2 protein was strongly expressed in the nuclei of both goblet cells (GC) and absorptive cells (AC) in the foci of complete IM, but it was significantly decreased in the foci of incomplete. MUC5AC was expressed in the cytoplasm of both GC and AC in incomplete IM, whereas it was expressed in only a few GC but not AC in complete IM. MUC6 was expressed in several deeper glands of incomplete IM but not in complete IM. Conclusion: CDX2 can be used as an important marker in the pathological diagnosis of early gastric IM. IM with low expression of CDX2 and MUC5AC may serve as predictive markers for gastric cancer. Yalta * , F. \u00d6zyilmaz, S. Oguz, G. Kazindir, E. Tastekin, A. R. Hatipoglu, K.

Ensari * University of Ankara, Medical School, Turkey Objective: Reflux oesophagitis comprises patients diagnosed as endoscopic oesophagitis (EO) with minimal histologic abnormality and those showing \"microscopic oesophagitis\" (MO) with normal endoscopy. We, therefore, aimed to evaluate the discriminatory value of histologic criteria for both groups with reflux oesophagitis. Method: The study group comprised of 416 patients (145 children and 271 adults) who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy where 113 were diagnosed as EO. Histological assesment for basal cell hyperplasia (BH), papillary elongation (PE), dilatation of intercellular spaces (DIS), intraepithelial eosinophils, neutrophils and lymphocytes was performed. Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis.Results: All morphologic parameters were more commonly observed in patients without EO. The presence of severe PE (p=0.001) and DIS (p=0,01), together with high lymphocyte and neutrophil counts (cut off values of >10 and >2, respectively) (p<0.001) were the most discriminatory features for the diagnosis of MO. EO was significantly more frequently observed in children compared to adults (p< 0.005). The presence of DIS (p<0,001), PE (p=0,001), and high neutrophil counts (p<0.05) was significantly more common in adults.Conclusion:The results of our study suggest that endoscopic biopsy is necessary in all patients with or without EO for the diagnosis of reflux oesophagitis.Objective: Characterization of gastric cancer invasiveness seems to be one of most important predictor of clinical outcome, dependent on a G and pT grade. Moreover, image differs along tumor invasion line. From the other side, fractal measurement seems to be appropriate for complexity analysis. Thus we attempted to characterize gastric cancer invasion line using complexity measurements, fractal parameters as fractal dimension (D and \u039bD), lacunarity and image statistics. Method: The study based on 19 resectable gastric cancer cases, 13 Laur\u00e9n intestinal type gastric cancer and 6 diffuse type. Full depth gastric wall slides were stained with pancytokeratin. Serial digital images were collected, local pT, G, and image fractal measurements were established for each image. Results: The presence of necrosis played an significant role in estimating complexity only in Laur\u00e8n intetstinal type (lowering \u039bD and lacunarity). Histoarchitectonic elements in intestinal cancer type could be characterized by D, inflammation intensity was dependent on the length of the invasion line and \u039bD. The pT showed dependence on lacunarity, budding type reflected in D. In gastric cancer diffuse type only inflammation and pT showed dependence on fractal dimensions.Conclusion: Fractal analysis and image statistics provides a new diagnostic support in gastric cancer studies.

The aim was the assessing of histological features and other parameters influencing on the grade of TRG. Method: The study encompassed 66 cases with gastric cancer subjected to gastrectomy, after preoperative radio-chemotherapy(years 2003-2010)  in our Institute. The dependences between the TRG grade, and sex, age, tumor localization, tumor gross morphology, tumor histology, and invasion data were statistically assessed. (nonparametric methods). specific type of gastric cancer. Only histological type of tumor, pT and N stages were correlated with TRG grade. Conclusion: Tumor response to radio/chemiotherapy depends mainly on tumor histotype and clinical staging.PS-06-058Clinicopathological and prognostic significance of p53 and TGF-beta 1 in patients with gastric cancer Y. Ananiev * * Medical Faculty, Trakia University, Gen. and Clinical Pathology, Stara Zagora, BulgariaObjective: The aim of this study is to investigate p53 value and it relationship with TGF-beta1 expression, clinicopathological parameters and survival in patients with gastric cancer. Method: In 53 patients who had undergone gastrectomy for gastric cancer, the expression levels of p53 and TGF-beta1 in gastric cancer tissues were examined immunohistochemically (IHC). p53 gene alterations were examined by fluorescence microscope after in situ hybridization performing. Results: We found p53 expression in all of gastric cancer specimens. Also, 47.2 % of specimens were TGF-beta1 expression positive. The patients with p53 expression had worse prognosis after surgical therapy compared to those without. The median survival of p53-positive patients was 4.8 months whereas the median survival of p53-negative patients was 9.1 months (p=0.027; log-rank test). Also, 88.9 % from patients with p53-positive status is in T1-T2 stage vs. 37.8 % in T3-T4 (\u03c72=7.88, p=0.005).Conclusion: In conclusion our results suggest that low expression of p53 and TGF-beta1could be useful as a marker of poor prognosis and had prognostic value for gastric cancer patients.PS-06-059Primary gastric mantle cell lymphoma diagnosed from gastrectomy specimen: A case report S.

Dulinez * Belarussian Medical Academy, Bio-Medical Research Center, Minsk, Belarus Objective: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) have a spectrum from minimal indolent neoplasms to sarcomas. In this study the tumor behavior are compared with morphometric results. Method: Morphometric cellular parameters such as mean nuclear area (MNA), mean nuclear length (MNL), mean nuclear width (MNW), mean nuclear density (MND), mean cytoplasmic area (MCA) and mean nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio (MNCR) were evaluated in hematoxylin and eosin stained slides of 36 spindle-cell GISTs (11 benign and 25 malignant) by using a computer-assisted image analysis system. Morphometric results were compared with tumor behavior. Results: MNA, MNL, MNW and MCA are 50.57\u00b15.63, 15.35\u00b11.18, 4.49\u00b10.56 and 135.72\u00b113.85 mcm in benign GISTs, respectively. MND and MNCR are 179\u00b113.6 and 1:2.7 also in benign group. MNA, MNL, MNW and MCA are 51.03\u00b15.55, 14.75\u00b10.70, 4.72\u00b10.43 and 127.22\u00b111.58 mcm in malignant GISTs, respectively. MND and MNCR are 193.9\u00b1 16.6 and 1:2.5 also in malignant group. No correlation was found between morphometric features and gastrointestinal stromal tumor behavior (p>0.05).Conclusion: This study showed that the tumor cellularity and nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio aren't the parameters to predict aggressiveness of GISTs. These morphometric parameters may not be used in the prognosis of GISTs behavior.PS-06-062Signet ring cell carcinoma of stomach diagnosed with bone marrow metastasis: A case report G. S.

Findings of the UK NEQAS ICC & ISH external assessment service S. Parry * , K. Miller, J. Starczynski, N. Wong, B. Jasani, I. Nagelmeier, M. Ibrahim * UK NEQAS ICC & ISH, London, United KingdomObjective: Gastric cancer patients showing IHC 3+ & 2+ and ISH amplified expression benefit significantly from Trastuzumab treatment. With increasing numbers of laboratories carrying out gastric HER2 immunohistochemistry (HER2 IHC) testing, UK NEQAS ICC&ISH has developed a gastric HER2 IHC service to closely monitor staining methodologies and interpretation. Method: Participating laboratories were sent unstained composite slides consisting of 3+,2+,1+ and negative tumours to stain using their routine method. Participants were requested to return the slide along with a stained inhouse control section along with methodological details. Slides were assessed for quality of staining and interpretability by a panel of expert assessors.Results: Data showed an 'acceptable' pass rate of 54 % (N=89); Borderline pass 17 % and unacceptable staining in 29 %. In-house slides showed an acceptable rate of 33 %, borderline pass 38 % and unacceptable rate 29 %. The Ventana 4B5 system, used by 51 % (n=45), had an overall pass rate of 76 %. The second most popular method was the 'home-brew' (15 %, n=13), with a pass rate of only 15 %. Conclusion: Using 'home-brew' methods for gastric HER2 testing can result in misinterpretation of membrane staining. An EQA for gastric IHC testing can help ensure reliable results and rectify suboptimal performance.

De Falco * , K. Schurfeld, V. Calbi, M. Ogwang, M. Mwanda, L. Leoncini * University of Siena, Dept. Human Pathology and Oncology, ItalyObjective: Lacor Hospital is the second hospital of Uganda and serves almost 3 million inhabitants. In 2005, the figures were as follows: for the 34.498 patients admitted, 245.086 patients were treated in the out patient departments. There were available surgery, X-Rays and ultrasound, vaccinations, laboratory tests, but no pathology service was available until 2008. Method: In 2008 the Italian NGO\"Patologi oltre Frontiera\" launched a project aiming at establishing a pathology laboratory at Lacor. Spaces were assigned by the hospital and equipments for specimen processing were provided thanks to the Province of Bolzano, Italy. The project aims also at ensuring the local presence of pathologists, on a voluntary base. Results: 11 pathologists have been working at Lacor since 2008, for time periods of 1-4 months. The most frequent biopsy sites were: Soft tissue, Prostate, Skin, Uterus cervix, Lymph nodes, Liver, Breast. PAP smears were offered to women comming to the hospytal for different reasons (AIDS clinic, delivery, bleeding). At the moment no screening program is present at Lacor. Thanks to the establishment of a pathology service in loco, differential diagnosis was improved since 2008. Conclusion: The project is still ongoing. Future steps will include the establishment of immunohistochemistry, and the presence of a local pathologist, who will be trained and assisted by volunteer pathologists. Splenic localization of the peritoneal mesothelioma: Case report A. N. Deger * , C. Kocak * S.B. DPU. Kec. EA Hastanesi, Patoloji Bolumu, Kutahya, TurkeyObjective: Peritoneal mesothelioma is a very rare diagnosis. It accounts for 20-30 % of all mesothelioma type cancers. We report a case of a 65-years-old woman was operated because of mass in the spleen and was performed total splenectomy. Method: Operation specimen included spleen as well as various sizes of nodular peritoneal lesions. Sectioning of the spleen material revealed tumoral lesion ranging in size from 4\u00d73,5\u00d7 3 cm and it was located in hilus as well as it infiltrated parenchyma. On the other hands, multinodular tumoral tissues were observed and this tissues derived from periton.Tissue sections were prepared by H.E. and immunohistochemical stainings. Results: Microscopically, tumoral tissue consisted of atypical epithelial cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and with eosinophilic nucleolus and characterized by acinar or glandlike structures. Sections of tumoral tissue included atypical mitotic figures and necrosis focuses. In immunohistochemical examination, it was shown that calretinin, mesothelioma Ab-1, vimentin, pancytokeratin was positive.So, the tumoral lesion was diagnosed as peritoneal mesothelioma based on these findings. Conclusion: Peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare form of malignant mesothelioma, making up <30 % of diagnosed mesothelioma cases. The reported case refers to a particular localization of a peritoneal mesothelioma, the spleen, discovered only after a splenectomy.

Bab\u00e1l * Comenius University, Inst. of Pathology, Bratislava, SlovakiaObjective: Adjuvant arthritis (AA) is an induced systemic disease primarily with inflammatory joints destruction similar to human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Spleen and the thymus are organs of immune system involved in RA development. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are cells of first defence line participating at joints affection. First line therapy in RA is Methotrexate (MTX). The aim of the study was to evaluate histological changes of the spleen during AA and effect of MTX on granulocytes redistribution. Method: Tissues of spleen, thymus and knee joints were histochemicaly stained for detection of chloracetatesterase activity, which showed granulocyte infiltration that was morphometrically evaluated. Results: We observed significant reduction of spleen white pulp in AA and correction to normal level after MTX administration. The same was seen also in number of PMN. The opposite tendency was observed in knee joints with massive PMN infiltration in AA, which was significantly reduced after MTX administration. No significant changes were observed in the thymus. Conclusion: Our results indicated the connection between the PMN accumulation in sites of inflammation during AA mirroring their decreased number in the spleen and effect of MTX on spleen histological changes. This observation points to the eventual mechanism of MTX effect on lowering the inflammatory reaction in vivo.Objective: Liver transplantation is the only chance of rescue for patients with end-stage of many diseases of this organ.

Method: Causes of death of psychiatric patients was analyzed on 5 years autopsy records on Institute of Pathology, Medical Faculty, University of Belgrade. Equal number of randomly selected non-psychiatric cases (n=80) formed control group. Results: Life longevity of psychiatric patients was approximately 10 years shorter, than in control group (57.8 \u00b1 14.0 vs 68.3 \u00b1 11.8; p < 0.001) with significant predominance of males (55:25; p<0.001). Most common causes of death in decreasing order was: bronchopneumonia, pulmonary thromboembolism, COPD, hypertensive heart disease, left heart failure, acute cor pulmonale, diabetes mellitus and food aspiration. Bronchopneumonia (p< 0.01), acute cor pulmonale, diabetes mellitus and food aspiration (p<0.05) was more frequent in group of psychiatric patients. There was statistically significant high relative risk only for bronchopneumonia as cause of death in psychiatric patients (RR=1.79; 95 % CI=1.09-2.89) either they were hospitalized in psychiatric hospital or not (p>0.05). Contrary, pulmonary thromboembolism was more frequent in those hospitalized in psychiatric hospitals (p<0.05). Conclusion: Lung and heart diseases and diabetes mellitus are more frequent in psychiatric patients and cause earlier dying, particularly in males, than in those without psychiatric diseases. Kimiloglu Sahan * , F. A. Ahlatci, I. Ulusoy, N.

The typical radiographic appearance is that of a lucent nidus with surrounding dense cortical thickening. Method: We present a case of an intraarticular osteoid osteoma in 24 year-old man.He had progressive pain in the right patella, occured 1 year before hospital application and also the pain was not relieved by NSAIDs. The patient applied to the orthopaedic clinic of our hospital in March 2012. The Magnetic Resonance (MRI) imaging results showed the lesion in the anterior epiphysis of the proximal tibia. This lesion located subcortical and the diameter of the lesion was 6 mm. Results: Microscopically, the nidus was a well-demarcated osteoblastic mass and consisted of interlacking network of osteoid trabeculae with different levels of mineralization, rimmed by abundant short spindled or polygonal osteoblasts and numerous osteclast -like multinucleate giant cells. The diagnosis was osteoid osteoma. Conclusion: Because intra-articular localization is rare in osteoid osteoma and the pain was not relieved by NSAIDs in our patient, we present the case here.

Vala * Coimbra University, Medicine, Pharmacol. & Therapeutics, Portugal Objective: Nodular glomerulosclerosis occurring in nondiabetic patients is an unexplained renal condition that resembles Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions (K-W), associated almost exclusively with diabetic nephropathy. This study aimed to assess the presence of nodular glomerulosclerosis in dogs with non-diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) and evaluate similarities with human condition, and thus, establish the dog as a natural disease model for further studies. Method: Kidneys from dogs (n = 27) with non-diabetic CKD were evaluated for the presence of nodular glomerulosclerosis. Samples were stained with haematoxylin-eosin and periodic acid of Schiff. Lesions were classified as absent or present, the later, classified as non-convincing and convincing K-W like lesions. As in man, Kimmelstiel-Wilson like lesions may also occur in dogs in the absence of diabetic nephropathy and reveal similar microscopic aspects to the description related in humans and, that some factors, others than hyperglycaemia, may be responsible for the appearance of these lesions. Thus, dogs may provide a model of natural disease for further elucidation. Meggyesh\u00e1zi * , G. Andocs, T.

Immunohistochemical assays were performed for establishing the biological potential of the tumor (Ki67, p53, CD10, VEGF) and the final diagnosis was malignant phyllodes tumor. Conclusion: This is the first reported association of these two malignant tumors, in our knowledge, raising the question if is only an incidental association or there is a subsequent connection between them. 30 %). A 10 month old male with clinical history of fever and diagnosis of Infectious Mononucleosis (EBV+), presented with hepato-splenomegaly, high liver enzymes, and clinic hemophagocytic syndrome. Posteriorly he presented dyspnoea, bradycardia, seizures and death. Autopsy examination showed pleural effusion and ascites. Congestive lungs. Liver of 785 g, spleen of 130 g; both with congestive aspect, and multiple adenopathies (we send material to the hospital department of immunology). Histological examination showed on liver and spleen a prominent lymphocytic infiltrate, positive to CD4, CD8, LMP and EBER immunohistochemistry stain with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, also seen in lymphoadenopathies. There were T lymphocyte cell perivascular in brain and lung. Making an immunology and autopsy outcome of Xlinked lymphoproliferative disease. The diagnosis of XLP must be considered in males with fatal or near fatal EBV infecttion, HLH resulting from EBV or other viral disease, hypogammaglobulinemia or common variable immunodeficiency, lymphoma and family history of XLP.PS-07-031 Aneurysmal bone cysts of hands and feet: A clinical and pathological review of 10 cases out of a series of 78 Y.

Marszalek * Collegium Medicum Bydgoszcz, Dept. of Clinical Pathomorphology, PolandObjective: Autopsy-based morphologic diagnosis of early phase of myocardial infarction is a challenge. Therefore, specific diagnostic methods are needed to confirm the early myocardial infarction. Recent reports indicate that h-FABP and MYBPC3 protein are highly sensitive and specific markers for the early myocardial infarction. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of h-FABP and MYBPC3 proteins as markers of early myocardial infarction in autopsy tissue section. Method: 20 cases of myocardial infarction and 20 cases with suspected myocardial infarction were selected from 236 autopsy examination performed in 2006-2010 at the Department of Pathology. The control group consisted of 20 sections of normal myocardium. The immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using antibodies against h-FABP and MYBPC3. Results: h-FABP and MYBPC3 proteins revealed various expression levels in selected groups. The control group revealed strong cytoplasmic expression of both determined proteins. The expression of h-FABP and MYBPC3 in patients with suspected or diagnosed myocardial infarction was reduced. Conclusion: H-FABP and MYBPC3 proteins may be usefull markers in diagnosis of early myocardial infarction, especially in patients with uncertain cause of death.PS-07-035The Pathological Effects of Immobilization Stress on Testes Tissue and Serum Testosterone level in Rats P.

Several different subtypes of CHS have been described depending on etiology or according to the chemical nature of the crystals. Method: We report a 56 -year-old man with 3 year history of systemic mastocytosis with slight splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. Laboratory investigations showed severe macrocytic anaemia (Hb85g/L; Hct 0.251 L/L; MCV 108.2 fl; MCH 36.6 pg; RDW 17.1), slight leukopenia and eosinophilia. Results: Microscopic examination of bone marrow revealed sheets of polygonal or spindle-shaped mastocytes with no associated clonal hematological malignancy. Around mast cell infiltrates were interspersed histiocytes with abundant opaque cytoplasm containing eosinophilic crystaline inclusions (Charcot -Leyden crystals). Conclusion: We report a case of crystal storing histiocytosis of bone marrow in a 56-year-old men with systemic mastocytosis. Around 90 % of CSH is associated with lymphoproliferative or plasma cell disorders, but not all cases are hematologically related. Only small number of non-immunological variants of CSH is reported in the literature. Yigit * , A. Gunal, Z. Kucukodaci, A. Ozcan, O. Onguru * GATA, Dept. of Pathology, Ankara, TurkeyObjective: The number of mitotic figures in a particular microscopic area is an important criterion, changes the diagnosis or determines the prognosis of many tumors. These criteria are generally accepted for each case in the light of the original studies and determined by counting mitotic figures in certain number of fields. The detected number of mitotic figures is affected by the field of view. Field of view depends on the ocular diameter and magnification value. The ocular lens diameters of the old types of microscopes used in original literature were smaller than current microscopes with a narrower field of view. The purpose of this report was to emphasize these differences in the mitotic counting. Method: In this report, the mitotic counting criteria for pathological diagnoses were reviewed from the original literature. Whether there is a difference between original literature criteria and evaluation with current microscopes according to ocular diameter, field of view and assessed total area were investigated. Results: Review carried out was determined certain differences between the criteria of the original literature and evaluation with current microscopes.Conclusion: Due to wider field of view in modern microscopes used in the current, number of field counted in original criteria though to need correction. Analysis of Nestin expression in pediatric and adult cases of high-grade osteosarcoma I. Zambo * , M. Hermanova, D. Adamkova Krakorova, P. Mudry, K. Zitterbart, M. Kyr, K. Vesely, J. Sterba, R. Veselska * St. Anne\u00b4s University Hospital, 1st Dept. of Pathologic Anatomy, Brno, Czech RepublicObjective: Nestin, an intermediate filament protein, has been detected in different tumors. In addition, nestin expression is associated with worse prognosis in some malignancies. Our study analyzed clinical significance of nestin expression in pediatric and adult cases of high-grade osteosarcoma. Method: Using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, nestin expression was examined in osteosarcoma tissue samples taken from 45 patients [24 males, 21 females; median age 19 years (range 6-85 years)]. In both methods, the frequency of nestin + tumor cells was stratified into three categories and clinicopathological correlations were statistically analyzed. Results: Variable frequent nestin + tumor cells were identified in all examined osteosarcoma samples. In the entire cohort of 45 patients, high levels of nestin expression detected by immunofluorescence were associated with significantly worse clinical outcomes (OS, p=0,031; EFS, p< 0,001). However, only statistically nonsignificant trends for shorter survival were revealed using generally more sensitive immunohistochemistry. Analogical results were obtained when comparing groups of patients by age or gender.Conclusion: Despite significantly shorter survival rates observed in patients with high levels of nestin expression assessed by immunofluorescence, nestin does not seem to represent a powerful prognostic marker for patients with high-grade osteosarcomas. Benign atypical intravascular CD30+ T-cell proliferation: A reactive condition mimicking intravascular lymphoma R. M. Garcia Martin * , E. Riveiro Falkenbach, M. T. Fern\u00e1ndez Figueras, J. L. Rodriguez Peralto * Hospital 12 de Octubre, Dept. of Pathology, Madrid, Spain Objective: Intravascular lymphoma (IVL) is a very aggressive disease that can involve the skin in 40 % of the patients. The majority of IVL are of B-cell lineage, although cases with a T-cell phenotype and, rarely, natural killer (NK)-cell phenotypes have been reported. Indeed, two cases of intravascular large CD30+ T-cell lymphoma were described in the literature, both with a fatal outcome. Results: Herein, we report two patients with skin lesions showing an atypical intravascular CD30+ T-cell proliferation. The rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and T-cell receptor gamma gene studied by the polymerase chain reaction were polyclonal. Indeed, both patients did not present systemic disease and therefore exhibit a favorable outcome.Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the second report of a benign intravascular CD30+ T-cell proliferation that represents an intriguing differential diagnosis for intravascular lymphoma.Monday, 10 September 2012, 09.30 -10.30, Congress Hall Foyer 3rd Floor PS-08 Poster Session History of Pathology PS-08-001 Medical research through historical resources: Talking objects at the Pathology Museum of Florence R.

Seckin * * Ankara Numune Hospital, Turkey Objective: A system of pathology based on practice, training and research could be institutionalized in Turkey in earlier 20th. century. Until 19th. century medical education was theoretical. It is known that dissection and autopsy was allowed in 1841 and Turkish became the lecturing language in 1870 during Ottoman Empire era. Method: It is Prof.Dr. Hamdi Suat Aknar who had founded modern and organizational pathology in Turkey. After training in pathology in Germany(1900)(1901)(1902)(1903)(1904), he returned and remained as a dedicated professor until 1933. He was the first who taught pathology in systematic order. Along with his routine work and lecturing, Prof. Aknar conducted numerous researches basically on skin lesions and tumors. He published 40 articles in German and French. Results: Through the publications and presentations at the congresses, he obtained an important standing and became a well-known pathologist in Europe. He was selected as the member of editorial board of the distinguished journal Acta Cancrologica published in Budapest. He pioneered the first organized activities against cancer in Turkey and contributed to the foundation of the Society Against Cancer. Conclusion: Pathology, founded in Turkey under the leadership of Prof. Aknar, has further developed with the efforts of eminent scholars. Afrogheh * , A. F. Bezuidenhout, N. Mohammed, J. Hille * Cape Town, South AfricaObjective: Clear cell odontogenic carcinoma (CCOC) is a rare odontogenic neoplasm with a propensity for recurrence and distant metastasis. We report a case of CCOC of the anterior maxilla in a 53 year old male.Method: CT scans revealed a destructive lytic expansile lesion originating from the anterior alveolar process of the maxilla. Histology disclosed a biphasic neoplasm with nests of central clear cells and peripheral polygonal hyperchromatic cells with marked cytoplasmic eosinophilia. Results: The tumour cells were immunoreactive for MNF116, CK14, CK19, CK5 and EMA. Both cell types were negative for S100 protein, vimentin, SMA, RCC, CD10, CK7 and CK20. The proliferation index, Ki67, was low and its expression, similar to CK14, was confined to the peripheral cells. Electron microscopic examination showed desmosomes and tonofilaments confirming the squamous origin of the lesion. Conclusion: CCOC is a distinct odontogenic neoplasm of squamous phenotype. Surgical resection with wide tumour free margins remains the mainstay of therapy. Its overall high recurrence rate even after radical surgical excision, necessitate close follow up of the patients. \u00c1gota * , S. Mocan, M. Gyorgy, E. Horvath, T.

MF are also found in metabolic disorders and following application of cationic amphiphilic drugs. We posed the question: Can M. Fabry and metabolic and/or drug induced MF be differentiated by LM and EM? Method: Case reports of 7966 renal biopsies containing the terms myelin, phospholipid or Fabry were selected, then we noted sex, biopsy indications, drug therapy and pathological diagnosis. EM pictures were screened for frequency and distribution of myelin figures and curvilinear bodies (CLB). Results: MF were rare (n=42), mainly found in podocytes (31/42), less frequently in endothelial/mesangial cells (each 8/32) or proximal tubules (6/42). CLB were seen only once in podocytes. In most cases, usually, only few cells had single MF. CLB and foam cells were absent. The etiology was usually unknown. In one case, CLB were found with MF, alongside moderate numbers of MF in moderate numbers of podocytes. Foam cells were not seen. The patient had received chloroquine.Conclusion: In all cases with podocytic foam cells (12/31) and/or numerous MF in many podocytes and other renal cells, without detectable CLB, M. Fabry was present. Foam cells together with many MF are suspicious of M. Fabry, MF and CLB are indicative of chloroquine therapy.

Results: CASE 1:56 year old man with Chronic Renal Failure (CRF) secondary to IgA Nephropathy who recived a kidney transplant. Five years later the patient present asthenia, deterioration of renal function, proteinuria and hypertension. Allograft biopsy showed on light and electron microscopy characteristic features of TG, but also recurrent IgA Nephropathy with mesangial staining of IgA and mesangial electrodense deposits in the glomeruli. CASE 2:43 years old man. CRF secondary to Membranous Glomerulonephritis Kidney transplant on July 2000 with decrease renal funtion and proteinuria 9 years later. Allogratf biopsy showed again characteristic features of TG and granular IgG and C3 inmunostaining in glomerular basement membranes. Ultraestructural studies confirm the TG and the subepithelial deposits. CASE 3:52 year old woman CRF secundary to membranoprolipherative glomerulonephritis type 2(DDD). Third kidney transplant on August 2006. Renal function deterioration on March 2010. Allogratf biopsy showed characteristic features of TG on light and electron microscopy but also features of DDD with C3 deposition on inmunofluorescence and ribbon-like highly electrodense intramenbranosous deposits.Conclusion: We must consider the possibility of simultaneous transplant glomerulopathy and other recurrent or de novo glomerulonephritis in the graft biopsy.

There was no correlation between p16 expression and the presence of human papillomavirus infection in squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder or urothelial carcinoma with squamous differentiation. Conclusion: Human papillomavirus does not play a role in the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder and urothelial carcinoma with squamous differentiation. p16 expression should not be used as a surrogate marker for evidence of human papillomavirus infection in urinary bladder cancer.PS-22-019 PAX8 is expressed in the majority of renal epithelial neoplasms: A study of 223 cases using a tissue microarraybased immunohistochemical approach L. Cheng * , Y. Hu, A. Hartmann, C. Stoehr, D. Tacha, R. Montironi, A. Lopez-Beltran * Indiana University, Dept. of Pathology, Indianapolis, USA Objective: PAX8 is a cell lineage-specific transcription factor and plays a crucial role in organogenesis of the kidney, thyroid, and M\u00fcllerian duct. Previous study showed that PAX8 is a specific and sensitive marker for both renal and ovarian carcinomas. The purpose of this study is to investigate PAX8 expression using a new monoclonal PAX8 antibody in a larger number of renal epithelial neoplasms including clear cell renal cell carcinoma, papillary renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, and renal oncocytoma. Method: PAX8 immunohistochemical staining was performed on tissue microarrays containing 84 cases of clear cell renal cell carcinoma, 66 cases of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, 57 cases of papillary renal cell carcinoma, and 16 cases of renal oncocytoma. Results: PAX8 expression was detected in 93 % (78/84) of cases of clear cell renal cell carcinoma, 80 % (53/66) of cases of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, 95 % (54/57) of cases of papillary renal cell carcinoma, and 94 % (15/16) of cases of renal oncocytoma. Conclusion: PAX8 is expressed in the majority of renal epithelial neoplasms including renal cell carcinomas and oncocytomas and this monoclonal PAX8 antibody is more sensitive than polyclonal antibody to detect chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. These results showed that PAX8 is a valuable marker for nephric neoplasms.PS-22-020 Prostatitis as the presenting sign in Wegener granulomatosis: A case report M. Chorti * , N. Maounis, A. Kalogirou, A. Birbakou, A. Emmanouilidou, M. Demonakou, S. Legaki * Sismanoglion General Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Athens, GreeceObjective: Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is a systemic disease that is usually limited to the respiratory tract and kidneys. Prostate involvement is demonstrated histologically in 2-7 % of the patients. Method: A 41 years old male was hospitalized with symptoms of acute urinary retention due to acute prostatitis, was treated with antibiotics and demonstrated clinical improvement. He underwent transurethral prostatic biopsy and the diagnosis of acute necrotic prostatitis was rendered. A month later, he was admitted to our hospital with features of sepsis. Abdomen CT revealed prostate abscesses and thoracic cavity CT showed bilateral pleural effusion with single peripheral nodule on the left lobe. Bronchoscopy revealed nodules on the main right bronchus. Bronchial biopsy demonstrated candida inflammation. Red cell casts in urinalysis and C-ANCA seropositivity was demonstrated. Prostatic biopsy slides were reevaluated and showed histological features of acute necrotic prostatitis associated with vasculitis and scattered multinucleated giant cells.Results: Based on the combination of clinical, histological, biochemical and immunological features the diagnosis of WG was established. He received immunosuppressive therapy and showered significant clinical improvement. Conclusion: Prostate involvement can rarely be the presenting clinical manifestation of WG. Early diagnosis is important expediting aggressive immunosuppressive therapy which may limit a more severe systemic disease progression.PS-22-021Transitional cell carcinoma arising within the renal pelvis of a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: A case report A.

Our aim is to define the morphologic and immunohistochemical findings of 4 new cases. Method: Four cases of RCC with SGC have been identified in our files from 1990 to 2011. Histological slides were reviewed in all cases and inmunohistochemistry (CK7, AE1/AE3, CD10, RCC-Ma, EMA, CD117, AMACR, CAIX) performed in 3 cases. Results: Main clinicopathological data appear in theTable.All tumors were classic clear cell RCC with SGCs distributed along the tumor. SGCs showed emperipolesis and eosinophilic hyaline globules. SGCs immunostaining was similar to conventional clear cells (CD10, EMA, AE1/AE3, RCC-Ma, CAIX positive). Two cases showed extrarrenal extension.Conclusion: SGCs is a rare finding in clear cell RCC. The immunostaining of syncytial cells is similar to that observed in the adjacent clear cell RCC. This histologic variant seems to be more aggressive than conventional clear cell RCC; additional series are needed to delineate with certainty its clinical behaviour.PS-22-023Primary renal carcinoid tumor: Report of 2 cases A.

Method: An institutional archive search was performed for breast cancer diagnosed in women <50 in [2006] [2007] . Age at diagnosis, tumor histological type and grade, estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER and PR), HER2/neu, Ki-67 and p53 status as well as clinical course during the follow-up period were recorded. Patients were sub-classified into agegroups of 5-year intervals for statistical analysis. Results: Ninety of 516 carcinomas were diagnosed in women <50. They frequently displayed aggressive morphology, high proliferative activity, increased expression of p53 and high incidence of lymph node metastasis. We found a statistically significant decrease in HER2/neu over-expression with increasing age using 40 as the cut-off (<40: 42 %, \u226540: 11 %; p=0.0032, chi-square test). No significant age-related differences in ER or PR expression were observed within the group of women <50. Conclusion: We show that 40 should be used as the cutoff for defining young women; in whom breast cancer is most likely to over-express HER2/neu. The mechanisms behind this finding and its significance are yet to be elucidated. Objective: OSNA is a molecular assay for lymph node in breast carcinoma (BC) based on m-RNA detection of CK19. The aim of this study is to evaluate the rate of negative o heterogeneous immunohistochemical expression of CK19 in BC. Method: CK19 was assessed in 345 consecutive samples. Cases were categorized as positive, negative and heterogeneous. Other parameters recorded where histological type and grade (Nottingham) and molecular subtype (St. Gallen2011). Results: 319 cases (92.4 %) were CK19+. Ten (2.8 %) were CK19-and 16(4,6 %) were heterogeneous. There were 2 intraductal carcinomas, 1 heterogeneous and 1Ck19-. Among 24 invasive carcinomas, there were 9CK19-: 6 ductal, 2 papillary and 1 metaplastic. Three cases corresponded to G1, 4 G2, 1 G3 and 1T1mi not available. Five cases were Luminal A(LA), 1 Luminal B/HER2-(LB-), 1 HER2+ and 2 triple negative (TN). Among 15 heterogeneous cases, 13 were ductal, 1 metaplastic, and 1 atypical medullary carcinoma. Eleven were G3, and 4 G2. Four were LB-and 11 cases were TN. Conclusion: All lobular carcinomas expressed CK19 CK19 was negative in 2.8 % and heterogeneous in 4.6 % of BC. They represent a heterogeneous group but half of these cases are either G3 or TN. 74 % of heterogeneous cases were TN and 26 % LB-with no LA cases in this subgroup.",

It is composed by mucous, intermediate and epidermoid cells, similar to its salivary gland counterpart. Method: We present the case of a 67 years old man with a 2,2/1,6 cm breast tumor located under the nipple, poorly circumscribed, with increased consistency and central cystic area containing serous fluid. Tissue samples were preserved using 10 % formalin. All sides were stained using hematoxylin-eosin. Immunohistochemistry was performed using labeled streptavidin-biotin method. Results: Microscopic examination reveals islands and sheets of polygonal cell with clear/pale cytoplasm, \"signet cells\" figures, areas of squamous metaplasia and centrally located hyperchromatic nuclei, some with visible nucleoli and rare mitoses. Tumoral parenchyma contains ducts and cysts of varying sizes, with pale eosinophilic luminal accumulation PAS, D-Pas and Alcian Blue positive (mucin). Immunohistochemical tests were performed. Differential diagnosis was made among several benign and malignant lesions, the final diagnostic being mucoepidermoid carcinoma, low grade. Conclusion: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the breast is an extremely rare entity; however its specific morphologic and prognostic features (similar to its salivary gland counterpart) allow proper diagnostic.",

The aim of this case is to show how noninvasive cardiac investigations are sometimes not sufficiently conclusive for distinguishing between hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and the other cardiac diseases.Method: Thirty-one representative left ventricle biopsies were obtained following suspected HOCM. Samples underwent routine standard and special staining procedures. Five histologic parameters were used for assesment (disarray and hypertrophy of myofibers, myocardial short runs, perinuclear halo and bizarre nuclei and fibrosis) and graded from 0 to 3, presenting in summary Histological HOCM Index (HHI-ranging from 0 to 15). Results: The histological findings in EMB of thirty-one patients, in 8 (25,8 %) patients HOCM diagnosis was confirmed, in 6 (19,35 %) patients HHI was under or equal to 50 % (8) so HOCM diagnosis couldn't be confirmed, amyloidosis in one (3,22 %) patient, myocarditis in 4 (12,9 %) patients, dilatative CMP in 6 (19,35 %) patients and unspecific cardiac changes in 6 (19,35 %) patients.

Fleres, P. Pugnetti, E. Orlando, E. Maresi * University of Palermo, Section of Pathology, Italy Objective: Tubulocystic carcinoma of the kidney (TCRCC) is a rare variant of renal tumor showing unique gross and microscopic features. Several recent studies favour its inclusion within the papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) group. Method: Patient 1 was a 55 year-old man with a left asymptomatic renal mass incidentally discovered by sonography. Patient 2 was a 72 year-old man with aortic estenosis and coronary disease. A right renal mass was discovered in the work up for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass. Results: Both tumors were well circumscribed masses with \"sponge-like\" appearance. On light microscopy, the tumors were composed of ectatic tubules and cysts of variable size, lined by a single layer of tumor cells with eoshinophilic cytoplasm, apocrine appearance, rounded nucleus sometimes overlapping, and prominent nucleoli. IHC showed positive staining with CK7, e-cadherin, CD10, and AMACR. Conclusion: TCRCC has been recently recognized as a distinct subtype of PRCC by some authors. In fact, some few cases reported have histological transition between tubulocystic and papillary phenotypes on routine histological sections. Additionally, TCRCC shows trisomies of chromosomes 7 and 17. The exact location of this tumor within the 2004 WHO classification is a matter of debate. Objective: Our purpose is to evaluate HER2 protein expression in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. HER2/neu is a tyrosine kinase receptor (family of human epidermal receptors), showing overexpression in a large variety of tumor cells. Method: 30 bladder biopsy and cystectomy specimens were included in this study. The age of the patients ranged from 25 to 86 (mean 71). Among them 25 (83.33 %) were male and 5 (16.67 %) female. All cases were reevaluated histopathologically according to WHO 2004 grading system. HER2 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry (CB11) using the same criteria as for breast cancer. Results: All 30 bladder neoplasms were low-or high-grade urothelial carcinomas. HER2 protein overexpression was observed in 10 (33.33 %) cases (2+: 5 cases and 3+: 5 cases), while 20 (66.67 %) cases were negative (0: 3 cases and +1: 17 cases). Among HER2 positive cases 9 (90 %) were high-grade carcinomas, while 1 (10 %) was low-grade carcinoma. Among negative cases 14 (70 %) were lowgrade carcinomas, while 6 (30 %) were high-grade carcinomas. Conclusion: These findings indicate that HER2 protein overexpression is predominately correlated with high tumor grade in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and patients with these characteristics could be potential candidates for targeted therapy.",

Serizawa * Tokyo Medical University, Division of Diagnostic Pathology, JapanObjective: Primary mucinous adenocarcinoma of the renal pelvis is extremely rare and about 50 cases have been reported to date. We present a case of mucinous adenocarcinoma followed by renal cysts. Method: The patient is a 52-year-old male. A renal cyst in the right upper region was found incidentally. He had no symptom at that time. After 4 years, he came to the hospital because of hematuria and back pain. The examination revealed that the renal cyst was enlarged accompanied with solid lesion. The high serum level of CEA indicated malignancy and tumorectomy was performed. Results: Macroscopically, a renal cyst (15\u00d710 mm) in the right upper portion was adjacent to a solid mass (22\u00d717 mm). The tumor showed papillary growth (20\u00d7 15 mm) in renal pelvis. Microscopically, the tumor was consisted of adenocarcinoma with tubular or papillary structure, spreading from cyst wall to pelvis. The tumor cells contained mucin and some showed signet-ring celllike feature. Conclusion: Clinically, high serum level of CEA is a marker of mucinous adenocarcinoma originated from renal pelvis. In our case, the tumor has already from pelvis to cyst wall. We thought it originated form renal pelvis, however, the renal cyst is also a candidate for its origin. Results: An 8 cm tumour was revealed in Douglas cavity, histologically, deciduoid morphology was predominant with abundant atypical mitoses and massive neutrophyls infiltration.

Method: Our 47 years old patient had a primary amenorrhea. External genitals were female, without pubic and axillary hair. US confirmed cystic formation of the left gonad and lack of uterus. Tumor markers were normal but testosterone was high. Cystic formation of the left gonad was surgically removed, initially specified as a left ovary, as well as the other gonad. Pathohistological examination and karyotyping was done. Results: Immunohistochemical analyzes of the gonad sample reveal that Sertoli cells showed positivity for Inhibin \u03b1, Vimentin, CD99, CKAE1/AE3 and Calretinin and Leydig cells showed positivity for Inhibin \u03b1, Vimentin, CD99, CKAE1/AE3 and Calretinin, and weak positivity for S-100, Synaptophysin i NSE. Immunoreactivity for CD99 in hyperplastic areas of Leydig cells showed the most intensive Conclusion: We conclude that CD10 and P53 expression may be a useful adjunct marker in distinguishing BCC and benign adnexial neoplasm of hair follicle apparatus tumor. Objective: Pigmented purpuric dermatosis (PPD) comprises a group of vascular disorders of unknown etiology. Histologically, it is characterized by lymphocytic capillaritis in the papillary dermis. Method: A retrospective and monocentric study concerning the cases of PPD diagnosed in the department of anatomopathology La Rabta over 6 years (from 2006 to 2011). These cases were studied clinically and histopathologically. Hepatitis C and B profile was carried out to evaluate a possible relation. Results: 6 cases of PPD have been diagnosed; 2 men and 4 women, aged from 20 to 80 years. Only one patient tested positive for hepatitis C with an elevated viral load. she had a profuse eruption involving the trunk and the limbs of 4 years duration, contrary to the other patients in whom only the lower limbs were affected. she has been treated by alpha interferon and ribavirin with a disappearance of the eruption within 3 months. In the five other patients, the lesions resolved spontaneously within a period of 2 to 9 months. Conclusion: Hepatitis C may play a role in the pathogenesis of PPD especially when the lesions are profuse and longstanding. In our patient, the disappearance of lesions 3 months after the onset of interferon alpha therapy with a significative decrease of viral load is an argument supporting our hypothesis. Objective: Fibrolipomatous hamartoma of nerve is a benign lesion, very rare in medical practice, occurring in children or young adults. Case report: A 44 year old woman, G. N., presented with a slowly growing plantar mass in the right foot that had been present for 7 years. Neither the patient nor members of her family had a history of neurofibromatosis or other soft tissue tumors. She had no pain at rest, but she had shooting pain while running or walking. Physical examination revealed a mobile, tender mass located in the plantar soft tissue.",

            "text": "Method: After surgical excision, the lesion was well circumscribed, 20/10/8 mm, white colour with yellow areas. Tissues specimens were fixed in 10 % buffered formalin, routinely processed and embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 3 \u03bcm, then stained routinely by Hematoxylin -Eosin, than examined by light microscopy. Results: The lession is characterized by proliferation of mature fatty and fibrous tissue within the epineurium of the nerve accompanied by prominent concentric perineurial fibrosis. The histopathological diagnosis was fibrolipomatous hamartoma of nerve. Conclusion: The tumour usually affects nerves of the upper extremities, most commonly the median nerve. Involvement of other nerves is rare. The lesion is benign and the recommended treatment is surgical excision. Objective: Leishmaniasis refers to the spectrum of diseases caused by Leishmania species, which are Protozoa of order Kinetoplastida. Clinically leishmaniasis is divided into visceral (kala-azar), cutaneous, mucosal, and mucocutaneous syndromes. The final diagnosis of the disease, lesions of the parasites, as well as shown smear'lerde factor confirmed by histopathological and clinical evaluation. Method: In our study, 6 patients with the diagnosis of Leishmania cutaneous between 2006 and 2012 in Department of Pathology, Ataturk University Faculty of Medicine were presented. Results: Four (66.6 %) cases were females and 2(33.3 %) were males. Age ranging of cases was found from 0 to 60 years and median age 31.85\u00b112.15 years. The lesions were found on the face in patients. Facial skin biopsy specimens were taken in all cases. Giemsa-stained touch preparation of the skin biopsy revealed amastigotes inside macrophages, consistent with leishmaniasis. Lesions of 2 patients who have long been different from the rest of them were those who migrated to the Cukurova region. Conclusion: Leishmaniasis is public health problem in Southeastern Anatolia region of Turkey, especially in Sanliurfa and \u00c7ukurova region.",

            "text": "Autoimmune blistering skin diseases in East Anatolia N. Gursan * , O. Ceylan, H. Bilen, N. Akdeniz, M. Atasoy * Ataturk University, Medical Faculty, Erzurum, TurkeyObjective: Autoimmune blistering skin diseases can be divided into pemphigus diseases and subepidermal bullous diseases. In pemphigus, the autoantibodies are directed against intercellular contact structures; in the pemphigoid diseases, the autoantibodies are directed against adhesion molecules of the basal membrane zone. Method: A retrospective study of 102 cases of autoimmune blistering skin diseases obtained over a period of 7 years from 1st October 2005 to 31st December 2011 in the Department of Pathology, Medical Faculty of Ataturk University was designed. Results: In the present study, the mean age was 52 years and male: female ratio was 0,7. The most commonly affected sites were the buccal mucosa and the palate. %18 of cases, the oral cavity was the primary site of involvement. In histopathological examination we showed intraepithelial vesicle formation, subcorneal separation with acantholysis, and the presence of Tzanck cells in biopsy specimens. Conclusion: The incidence of autoimmune blistering skin diseases in our department increased in the past 7 years. Pemphigus vulgaris is the most common of these diseases. %70 of autoimmune blistering skin diseases was pemphigus diseases. Objective: Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) is the most common neutrophilic dermatosis. A dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate is the usual histological findings. The absence of histological image of vasculitis has been considered a characteristic of the disease and a distinctive feature of the other neutrophilic dermatoses. However, recent reports suggest that vasculitis should not exclude the diagnosis. Method: This retrospective study examines 32 cases collected over a period of 14 years (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) . We studied its clinical and histological characteristics. Skin biopsy specimens were reviewed to determine the prevalence of vasculitis. Results: Sweet syndrome is significantly more common in women than in men (sex-ratio=1/15). The patient's mean age was 51 years. Disease developed most often in autumn. Atypical presentation was noted in 18 patients. Skin biopsy revealed a sweet syndrome pattern in all cases. The prevalence of vasculitis (vessel wall damage with fibrinoid necrosis) was 28 % (9 of the 32 patients). Conclusion: Our series of patients is particular by the frequency of atypical clinical presentation and the presence of vasculitis in histologic examination, a feature that shouldn't exclude the diagnosis. It was suggested that vasculitis in Sweet syndrome represents an epiphenomenon rather than a primary immune-mediated process.",

Different structures (isolated or forming small clusters) with the morphological characteristics of amoeba trophozoites were identified in the areas of necrosis with and without an inflammatory reaction. The diagnosis of cerebral amebic abscess was then made. The 2 patients received antibiotic treatment. Conclusion: Cerebral amebic abscess is rare but has poor prognosis. It should be considered as a diagnosis for any patient with subacute and/or chronic meningoencephalitis without evident bacterial etiology. More effective antibiotic drugs can be chosen for post-surgical treatment; furthermore, better survival may be achieved by diagnosing the disease in early stages.",

Sementilli * Centro Universit\u00e1rio Lus\u00edada, Dept. of Pathology, Santos, Brazil Objective: Influenza virus pneumonia complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome is rare and has a high mortality rate. Patients with sickle cell trait are asymptomatic, however, complications with increased risk of thromboembolism can occur. Method: Case report: A 30-year-old woman with no preexisting medical conditions presented nonproductive cough and fever for 4 days. For the next 3 days, developed acute respiratory failure. She was treated for septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome without success with death. Expectoration and blood cultures were negative and the real-time polymerase (RT-PCR) of the thracheal swab was positive for influenza B virus. Results: The autopsy showed a diffuse necrotizing alveolitis and intra-alveolar hemorrhage with pulmonary infarction. There was no histological evidence of bacterial pneumonia. An evident blood cell sickling was observed associated with sickle cell trait. RT-PCR was also positive for influenza B virus in pulmonary tissue and the immunohistochemistry was negative for influenza A virus. Conclusion: Severe hypoxemia caused by the acute respiratory distress syndrome was a possible cause of the blood cell sickling and thrombotic events. Objective: Lupus vulgaris (also known as \"Tuberculosis luposa\") are painful cutaneous tuberculosis skin lesions with nodular appearance, most often on the face around ears nose, eyelids and lips, cheeks. \u0131t is still a major health problem in developing countries. Cutaneous tuberculosis is a rare form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Lupus Vulgaris (LV) is the most common form of cutaneous tuberculosis. LV should make differential diagnosis other granulomatous disease. All three cases of old female patient. Conclusion: Herein, three cases were presented which they treatment with correlation clinical and histopathological examination. Objective: Actinomycosis is a rare, chronic, and slowly progressive granulomatous disease caused by filamentous Gram positive anaerobic bacteria from the Actinomycetaceae family. It is often misdiagnosed because it can mimic Conclusion: The mean length of appendix in both series was about 6.95 cm. There were no important difference of the length of either parasitic appendixes or all cause appendectomy materials. In this study, it is concluded that there isn't an effect of the length of appendix on the settlement of bowel parasites. Objective: Cystic hydatid disease (CHD) is an infection produced by larvae of the parasite platyhelminth Echinococcus granulosus. Living in a rural area is an important risk factor for this disease. It is still an endemic disease in some regions of the world, particularly in many Mediterranean countries. The organs most commonly affected are the liver and the lungs. Method: We present a new case of multiple thoracic hydatidosis. Results: We present the case of a 37-year-old Caucasian man who presented chest pain and dyspnea. Chest-x-ray showed a well limited cardiac opacity of the upper lobe and of the right lung. Chest-CT-scan showed a mediastinal cyst evoking a hydatid cyst in the left ventricle associated to a right pleural effusion. The patient underwent surgery that consisted in the drainage of multiple pericardial cysts, cystectomy of a left ventricle cyst and right pleural cystectomy. Microscopic examination showed a pleura-pulmonary and cardio-pericardial hydatidosis. The patient was treated with albendazole and did not present complications or recurrences after 1 year of follow up. Conclusion: Multiple thoracic hydatidosis is rare. Cardiac location is the most challenging because it is difficult to manage and is life threatening. Treatment modalities are mainly based on surgery. Preventive measures are necessary to avoid disease recurrence. Objective: Lymphadenopathy is frequently present in HIV positive patients, especially in those with severe immune deficiency and consequently elevated risc of opportunistic infections and neoplasms. Considering the large spectrum of possible differential diagnosis a thorough lymph node analyses should be performed. Method: We examinated 30 peripheral lymph nodes from 27 patients from latero-cervical, axilar, inguinal and supraclavicular regions; 10 nodes (33,3 %) had diameter less then 1 cm. Results: Histopathological findings indicated mycobacterial infection in 15 patients (55,5 %), reactive hyperplasia in 7 patients (25,9 %), lymphoma in 3 patients, metastasis from Kaposi sarcoma in 2 and supurative inflamation in 1. Clinically suspected lymphoma was microscopically infirmed in all 4 cases. 4 cases of tuberculosis, 1 of lymphoma and 1 of Kaposi sarcoma metastasis were identified, all of them without prior clinical suspicion We identified tuberculosis, lymphoma and metastasis in 33,3 % of nodes smaller then 1 cm. Conclusion: In 74 % of cases lymph node biopsy identified tuberculosis or malignancy, and established a reliable diagnosis in various clinical suspicions. We consequently emphasize the importance of lymph node examination in the evaluation of lymphadenopathy in HIV positive patients, even is not prominent.
