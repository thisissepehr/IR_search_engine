            "text": "Life chaos, the perceived inability to plan for and anticipate the future, may be a barrier to the HIV care continuum for people living with HIV who experience incarceration. Between December 2012 and June 2015, we interviewed 356 adult cisgender men and transgender women living with HIV in Los Angeles County Jail. We assessed life chaos using the Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale (CHAOS) and conducted regression analyses to estimate the association between life chaos and care continuum. Forty-eight percent were diagnosed with HIV while incarcerated, 14% were engaged in care 12 months prior to incarceration, mean antiretroviral adherence was 65%, and 68% were virologically suppressed. Adjusting for sociodemographics, HIV-related stigma, and social support, higher life chaos was associated with greater likelihood of diagnosis while incarcerated, lower likelihood of engagement in care, and lower adherence. There was no statistically significant association between life chaos and virologic suppression. Identifying life chaos in criminal-justice involved populations and intervening on it may improve continuum outcomes.",

Furthermore, compared to people living with HIV (PLH) in the US general population, incarcerated PLH are often less likely to have met HIV care continuum milestones [2, 3] -engaged in care, received and adhered to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and achieved virologic suppression-at the time of incarceration [4] [5] [6] [7] . This disproportionate burden as well as the profound challenges in achieving the care continuum reflect how the incarcerated population represents one of the most socially and economically marginalized groups in the US [8] [9] [10] . Understanding the lived experience of navigating social and structural barriers to care in community settings may help us to improve the HIV care continuum among incarcerated PLH and those returning from custody.",

Their tool, the Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale (CHAOS), has since been adapted to adults to measure various aspects of stability and predictability in daily life, ranging from a person's perceived ability to organize a routine and keep a schedule, to their sense of certainty regarding their future housing or source of income [12] . While life chaos remains an underexplored concept in the health literature, a limited number of studies have demonstrated that it predicts important health outcomes. Life chaos predicted missed appointments and poor medication adherence among PLH [12, 13] and patients with chronic illness, [14, 15] as well as risky sexual behavior among men who have sex with men (MSM) [16] . In addition, life chaos was associated with structural barriers to HIV care-poverty, homelessness, and having unmet needs for financial, employment, and food support services-supporting its validity [12, 13] .",

Many come from communities where households and relationships are disrupted from high rates of incarceration [21] . Finally, social and economic marginalization due to overlapping stigmatized identities likely compound the life chaos. For example, incarcerated young black MSM often lose access to resources in their community due to homonegativity [22] and have higher rates of homelessness and lower rates of health insurance prior to incarceration compared to other incarcerated men [6] ; transgender women experience discrimination in employment, healthcare and family settings and victimization while incarcerated [23, 24] .",

Social support provides material resources or emotional support to buffer the effects of stressors [33, 34] , and can potentially counter the effects of life chaos [16] . On the other hand, social relationships may also be a source of HIV-related stigma, the devaluation and discrimination of PLH, which can be a potent barrier to continuum of care outcomes [35, 36] . For PLH with criminal-justice involvement, HIV-related stigma is associated with hiding one's HIV serostatus, refusing to take ART, and relapsing into substance use [18, 31, 32, 37] .",

To measure engagement in care, we asked whether participants who had been diagnosed more than 12 months prior to this incarceration had received at least one HIV primary care visit in the community 12 months prior to entering jail. We assessed ART adherence over the 30 days prior to incarceration using a scale of 0-100% rating scale, generally called a Visual Analog Scale [40] [41] [42] . Finally, we defined virologic suppression as viral load < 400 copies/ml on first viral load after jail entry. This cutoff was selected to account for viral blips that do not result in any clinically significant viral replication [5, 43, 44] .",

Life chaos-the perception of having an unstable, unpredictable, disorganized lifewas associated with elevated odds of HIV diagnosis while incarcerated among all participants, and with reduced odds of engagement in care and lower ART adherence among participants who were already diagnosed with HIV. However, our study did not support the hypothesized association between life chaos and viral suppression. The substantial associations of life chaos with several HIV care continuum variables remained significant and robust to the inclusion of multiple covariates that reflected the social environment of this vulnerable group of PLH. Consistent with our hypotheses, life chaos was associated with greater odds of being first diagnosed with HIV while incarcerated. Almost half of our participants were diagnosed with HIV during their current or a prior incarceration rather than through targeted or routine testing in the community, reflecting the concentration of medically-underserved individuals in the criminal justice system [58] . Routine HIV screening is critical not only for timely linkage to care and treatment for PLH, but also for reducing unrecognized transmission of HIV to others in the community [39] . HIV screening for those who are seronegative can also provide opportunities for risk assessment, counseling and further interventions such as pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent acquisition of HIV [59] .",

While we do not know why this occurred in our study, one possible explanation may be that virologic suppression, especially when measured using a single measurement [60] , is a downstream outcome that is not sensitive to the effects of upstream processes of engagement in care and adherence. Hence, life chaos may correlate with poor engagement in care and adherence to ART, but these processes may not be ultimately reflected in the viral load. First, virologic suppression is seen among patients with significant care gaps. In our study, among those who were diagnosed with HIV prior to this incarceration, 14% were engaged in care, while 68% were virologically suppressed. A recent study demonstrated a similar apparent discrepancy: a care gap of less than nine months had no association on viral load, and a gap of 12 months or more resulted in a quarter of previously suppressed patients becoming unsuppressed [61] . One explanation for this observation is that patients continue to take ART despite not engaging in care: a recent study based on a billings claim database showed that 40% of people with care gaps over six months continued to fill their ART prescriptions [62] . Furthermore, studies have shown that moderate levels of adherence as low as 75% can lead to virologic suppression [63] [64] [65] . Finally, reincarceration is common [66] . It is possible that participants received care and took ART during a previous jail stay within the 12 months prior to the current incarceration, and this may not have been reflected in the survey results. While life chaos is an underexplored concept, the literatures on some related concepts may shed light to potential mechanisms through which life chaos may be linked to care continuum outcomes. The perception that the future is uncertain is a central component of life chaos; similarly, time preference theory proposes that those who perceive that the future is uncertain are less likely to engage in healthy behaviors, because they do not value the potential health benefit in the future [67] . If chaos in effect measures future uncertainty, the association we found between chaos and HIV testing, engagement in care, and ART adherence may reflect our participants' lack of perceived benefit of these health-promoting activities. Another conceptually similar Table 5 Multivariable linear regression models describing the relationship between life chaos, social support, and HIV-related stigma with ART adherence among participants who were prescribed ART among HIV-positive cisgender men and transgender women prior to incarceration in LA County Jail, after multiple imputation (N = 284) Bold indicates coefficients or Odds Ratios that are statistically significant at the level of p < 0.05",

The same study found that transgender women were more likely to engage in HIV transmission risk behaviors compare to cisgender men. Transgender women experience disproportionate burden of HIV [72] , and risk behaviors may drive gender disparities among criminal justice-involved PLH. Interpretation of our findings is subject to limitations. First, our data are cross-sectional, which limits our ability to make causal inferences. Second, the interview was done prior to release from jail, so some participants may incorrectly recall their history prior to incarceration. While the restrictive environment of incarceration [18] may color the participants' recollection of life chaos prior to incarceration, our mean chaos score was similar to that found among under-resourced PLH in Los Angeles [12] . The data on HIV testing, engagement in care, and ART adherence are selfreported, and therefore subject to the challenges inherent to all studies using self-reported data. We did not collect data on prior incarceration. While interviews were conducted in a confidential manner, data may be biased with respect to the participants' willingness to report poor adherence and engagement with care. Finally, our results may not generalize to populations outside of Los Angeles County.",

At the individual level, our findings demonstrate the potential benefit of novel approaches to understand and address life chaos for PLH who experience incarceration in order to achieve HIV care continuum goals. Health care providers may identify patients who show signs of life chaos, such as having difficulty keeping their appointments or reluctance to schedule their next appointment, and offer supportive services, especially if they have experienced incarceration. Providers could partner with peer navigators or community health workers who may assist PLH in managing their life chaos, such as by scheduling or reminding them of their appointments or organizing transportation [38] , thereby making health care a source of stability in their lives. It will be critical to identify and address life chaos among PLH prior to their arriving in jail. It will be important to examine whether interventions that target the underlying factors associated with life chaos, such as housing, food, and income will change the perceptions of insecurity and uncertainty among vulnerable people, and also lead to better continuum of care outcomes in welldesigned prospective studies. At the community level, this may include addressing incarceration stigma-shame and discrimination of people who experience incarceration [57, 73, 74] -as this has been found be to a barrier for formerly incarcerated PLH to accessing care and other resources, such as housing, employment, and educational opportunities.",

In the multivariable model, life chaos remained associated with lower odds of engagement in care prior to incarceration (aOR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.87), as did older age (aOR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.10), while annual income over $10,000 (aOR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.01 to 5.23), and private health insurance (aOR = 5.59, 95% CI 2.04 to 15.29) were associated with higher odds. Average marginal effects estimates showed that a 1-point increase on the chaos scale decreases the probability of engagement in care prior to entering jail by about 6 percentage points; for example, increasing chaos from 3 to 4 on the 5-point scale would change this likelihood from 9.5 to 5.6%. 95% CI \u2212 16.90 to \u2212 0.46) was associated with lower ART adherence, representing an almost 9% decrease in selfreported adherence per one-point increase in the life chaos scale.
