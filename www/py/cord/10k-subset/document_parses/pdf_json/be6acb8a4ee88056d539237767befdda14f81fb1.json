We wished to determine whether overexpression of the NF-B inhibitor IB\u03b1 could modulate the severity of acute and prolonged pneumonia-induced lung injury in a series of prospective randomized animal studies. Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to undergo intratracheal instillation of (a) 5 \u00d7 10 9 adenoassociated virus (AAV) vectors encoding the IB\u03b1 transgene (5 \u00d7 10 9 AAV-IB\u03b1); (b) 1 \u00d7 10 10 AAV-IB\u03b1; (c) 5 \u00d7 10 10 AAV-IB\u03b1; or (d) vehicle alone. After intratracheal inoculation with Escherichia coli, the severity of the lung injury was measured in one series over a 4-hour period (acute pneumonia), and in a second series after 72 hours (prolonged pneumonia). Additional experiments examined the effects of IB\u03b1 and null-gene overexpression on E. coli-induced and sham pneumonia. Results: In acute pneumonia, IB\u03b1 dose-dependently decreased lung injury, improving arterial oxygenation and lung static compliance, reducing alveolar protein leak and histologic injury, and decreasing alveolar IL-1\u03b2 concentrations. Benefit was maximal at the intermediate (1 \u00d7 10 10 ) IB\u03b1 vector dose; however, efficacy was diminished at the higher (5 \u00d7 10 10 ) IB\u03b1 vector dose. In contrast, IB\u03b1 worsened prolonged pneumonia-induced lung injury, increased lung bacterial load, decreased lung compliance, and delayed resolution of the acute inflammatory response.

Activation of NF-B occurs in response to diverse stimuli, such as endotoxin, which bind to cell-surface receptors that in turn activate the canonic and/or noncanonic signaling pathway. This signaling cascade ultimately results in the phosphorylation and inactivation of the cytosolic inhibitor IB complex, which then dissociates, allowing NF-B to translocate to the nucleus to initiate gene transcription [5] . Inhibition of NF-B reduces injury in preclinical models of ALI, including ischemia-reperfusion [6] , endotoxemia [7] , and cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis [8] . However, NF-B also exerts important cytoprotective effects, promoting cell survival, resolution of inflammation, and wound repair [9] . Of interest, NF-B signaling plays a central role in the host response to lung bacterial infection [10] .

First, the finding that NF-B inhibition reduced the severity of acute pneumonia and decreased the host response induced ALI suggests that any benefit in this setting is mediated via a decreased host response to the instillation of E. coli [37] . This is consistent with the concept that in the early phases of pneumonia, secreted toxins, and the host immune response may be the predominant source of injury [37, 38] . This is supported by the fact that NF-B inhibition is protective in nonseptic inflammatory ALI models. Second, this effect was dose dependent, with lower and intermediate IB\u03b1 doses protective and the beneficial effects ablated at higher doses. This suggests a U-shaped dose-effect curve, reducing the therapeutic utility of approaches to inhibit NF-B in the setting of acute pneumonia. Third, IB\u03b1 worsened the severity of prolonged pneumonia, substantially increasing lung bacterial loads, and resulting in a persisting pulmonary inflammatory response. IB\u03b1, by inhibiting the early host response to E. coli instillation, may have led to a persistence of infection, ultimately worsening lung injury. Finally, the beneficial effects of NF-B inhibition in acute pneumonia were lost at the highest dose.
