CD28 was the first costimulatory molecule described on T cells; it was shown to augment T-cell stimulation when administered in combination with TCR signaling. [19] [20] [21] The CD28 interaction with its ligands (CD80/86) is essential to achieve optimal activation of na\u00efve T cells; if a signal is delivered through the TCR receptor in the absence of CD28 ligation, the T cell becomes anergic or dies prior to becoming small resting T cells. 21 CTLA-4 is expressed after TCR engagement and competes with CD28 for binding CD80/86 and when engaged provides a negative signal that puts the brakes on T-cell proliferation. OX40 was originally shown to have costimulatory activity on an Ag-specific CD4 T-cell line in vitro of similar potency to that of CD28. 22 While interaction of B7/CD28 is required for the optimal stimulation of na\u00efve T cells, 23 OX40-specific costimulation appears to be most important for the stimulation of effector T cells. 11, 24 Both CD28 and OX40 appear to play important but distinct costimulatory roles in the development of Ag-activated peripheral T cells and both signals are required for the optimal generation of memory CD4 T cells. 7 The remainder of this book chapter will focus on the mechanistic details of how OX40 functions to increase effector T-cell survival/function ultimately leading to increased generation of a functional memory response.

It is now evident that the extent of OX40L expression regulates the magnitude of OX40 signaling within activated T cells. 27 The OX40 ligand (OX40L) is a Type II transmembrane protein (TNF-family member) that was first identified in mice and shown to have \u00be67% homology to the human protein gp34. 28 Subsequently, studies revealed that the gp34 protein could bind to human OX40, demonstrating that gp34 is the human homologue of OX40L and to date this is the only known ligand that binds OX40. 8, 29 OX40L is expressed on activated APCs including B-cells, macrophages, DCs, NK cells, Langerhans cells, human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells, CD4 CD3-accessory cells and activated vascular endothelial cells and appears to be induced in a CD40-dependent manner. 25, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] The OX40L is also expressed by T cells and confer T:T-cell interaction that may also be important for OX40 signaling. 40 There were two sentinel studies describing OX40/OX40L knockout mice, which suggested that memory T-cell generation was impaired upon targeted disruption. 41, 42 The initial study challenged OX40 knockout mice with LCMV and influenza viruses. While these investigators observed no differences in Ag-specific CD8 T-cell memory and Ab responses, there was a significant decrease in viral-specific CD4 T-cell memory. In particular, there was a significant reduction in lung infiltration of CD4 T cells in virally infected OX40 knockout mice compared to controls. The second study described defective recall responses in OX40L knockout mice. This group immunized WT and OX40L ko mice with various Ag(s) and found defective proliferation and cytokine production within the CD4 T-cell compartment nine days following immunization. They also found defective Th1 and Th2 responses following restimulation in vitro, suggesting that the OX40 signaling can stimulate both Type 1 and 2 responses. 41 This study also revealed a decline in Ag-specific Abs (all isotypes) in KLH immunized OX40L ko mice and a slight decline in CD8 T-cell cytotoxicity. 41 Soon to follow was a manuscript detailing a marked decrease in CD4 T-cell memory following immunization of OX40 ko mice. 43 This study immunized mice with KLH either in alum (i.p.) or CFA delivered s.c. Similar to the previous study they found a marked decrease in Ag-specific cytokine production seven days after priming (effector T-cell stage). This study also investigated long-term survival of Ag-specific CD4 T cells and found a profound decrease in memory T-cell frequency and Ag-specific cytokine production in the OX40 ko mice. The frequency of long-term Ag-specific memory T cells decreased 11-fold and 23-fold in the CFA and Alum immunized OX40 ko hosts, respectively. This group further reported that an OX40-specific defect that led to decreased survival of Ag-stimulated T cells was in part due to decreased expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl. 7 CD4 T-cell memory responses within the lung are a critical component for the induction of asthma in mouse models. 44 OX40 expression by T cells appears to be an essential component of T-cell-mediated lung inflammation in asthma, as OX40 ko mice develop a tempered form of the disease. 44 In addition, this group found that Ag-specific long-term memory T cells (120 days post-Ag priming) were also dependent on OX40 signaling to induce asthma. 45 This data suggest that OX40 signaling of long-term memory T cells is critical for their effector function and blocking OX40 signaling in vivo may have clinical implications for individuals with asthma.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 220, "end": 223, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 224, "end": 226, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 561, "end": 563, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 736, "end": 738, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 933, "end": 935, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 936, "end": 938, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1200, "end": 1203, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1208, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1209, "end": 1213, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1214, "end": 1218, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1219, "end": 1223, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1224, "end": 1228, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1229, "end": 1233, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1234, "end": 1238, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1239, "end": 1243, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1244, "end": 1248, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1249, "end": 1253, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1372, "end": 1374, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1529, "end": 1532, "text": "41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1533, "end": 1535, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2359, "end": 2361, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2511, "end": 2513, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2635, "end": 2637, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 3396, "end": 3397, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3512, "end": 3514, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 3683, "end": 3685, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 3841, "end": 3843, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Role of OX40/OX40L Interaction in Memory T-Cell Generation and Function"}, {"text": "Recent literature has focused on two phenotypes of memory T cells that have separate functional properties, effector and central memory. [46] [47] [48] Effector memory T cells reside in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissue, where they elicit immediate function by producing cytokines and/or being cytotoxic with little clonal expansion upon reencountering Ag. [46] [47] [48] In contrast, central memory T cells are mainly located in the secondary lymphoid tissues, where they mediate long-lasting protection through clonal expansion. [46] [47] [48] A recent study showed a dramatic decrease in the effector memory population after Ag stimulation of OX40 deficient CD4 T cells compared to their WT counterparts. 49 There was no difference in these two populations three days after activation (as defined by CD62L and CD44), however as the cells became long-term memory T cells there was a dramatic loss in the effector memory population. The data also suggested that an OX40-specific signal generated early in the immune response is important to maintain these long-term effector memory CD4 T cells. 49 The importance of CD8 memory T-cell generation in the context of OX40 signaling has been studied in both viral and tumor model systems. 50 Initial studies used OX40 deficient T-cell receptor transgenic T cells (OT1) and compared them to WT cells upon adoptive transfer in tumor-bearing mice (EG7). These investigators found that the survival of the OX40 ko OT1 T cells was diminished compared to WT T-cell transfers into tumor-bearing mice and this also correlated with diminished anti-tumor activity. Transfecting the anti-apoptotic gene, Bcl-xl, into the OX40 ko CD8 T cells enhanced survival of these cells and increased their efficacy against an ova-expressing tumor. Another study investigated influenza-specific CD8 T-cell priming and memory T-cell expansion in the absence of OX40 signaling (OX40 ligand ko mice). 51 They found that primary expansion and memory CD8 T-cell survival was not affected in the OX40 ligand ko mice, however upon viral rechallenge the influenza-specific T cells within the OX40 ligand ko hosts showed defective recall responses.

When T-cell activation via TCR engagement with peptide/MHC occurs in the absence of a strong adjuvant, the local expression of OX40L is minimal. Therefore, in the absence of adjuvant, the Ag-stimulated T cells express OX40, but because OX40L expression on APC is limiting the majority of OX40 T cells will never encounter/engage their natural ligand. This may lead to apoptosis and limit the generation of memory T cells as depicted in Figure 1 . Evidence in support of this theory derives from two transgenic mouse models in which mice over express the OX40L. 27, 39 In both models, the investigators noticed a large increase in the proportion of T cells in the lymphoid compartments as the mice aged.

A subsequent report identified that a major difference between anti-OX40 and anti-CTLA-4 stimulated T cells was the upregulation of the IL-12 receptor `2 protein (signaling subunit). 54 This report went on to show that anti-OX40-mediated survival of Ag stimulated CD4 T cells was dependent on IL-12 signaling. The data also showed that there was a critical window of IL-12R upregulation, 4-7 days after antigen priming/OX40 stimulation and if the cells did not encounter IL-12 during that time frame they would undergo activation-induced cell death. 54 Exogenous OX40 agonist administration delivered in vivo also affects CD8 T-cell survival and memory development. The investigators of this study used the OT1 TCR transgenic model (specific for ova) and immunized these mice with soluble ova in combination with anti-OX40 or rat Ig. 5 The anti-OX40 Ab increased the initial expansion phase of Ag stimulated CD8 T cells two-fold compared to the controls. OX40 agonist administration also increased the long-term survival of the CD8 T cells, 5-10-fold. The surviving CD8 T cells were mostly of central memory phenotype and were functional upon re-encountering Ag. The OX40-stimulated CD8 T cells showed a large increase in IL-2 receptor expression early during the response, which might have conferred the increase in their survival. Anti-OX40 administration also greatly enhanced CD8 T-cell recall responses. Both proliferation and survival of the recall specific T cells was increased and was in part CD4-dependent. 5 Although, it is clear that direct expression of OX40 on CD8 T cells also plays a key role for the OX40 agonist effect observed in both primary and secondary responses. 5 OX40 agonists were also shown to increase the effector/cytotoxicity function of antigen stimulated CD8 T cells by upregulating granzyme B levels, through an IL-2-dependent mechanism. 55 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 199, "end": 201, "text": "53", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 544, "end": 546, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 911, "end": 913, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1195, "end": 1196, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1878, "end": 1879, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Providing an Exogenous OX40 Signal (OX40 Agonists) to Enhance Memory T-Cell Generation"}, {"text": "It is clear from the studies summarized above that signaling through OX40 on either CD4 or CD8 T cells has a dramatic effect on their effector function and survival.

What appears to make OX40 such a good target to alter T-cell function in vivo is its unique expression pattern, which is only upregulated after T-cell receptor engagement in vivo and quickly downregulated 24-48 hr after induction. Hence, in vivo expression at any time is extremely low, although OX40 is constitutively expressed on mouse T regulatory cells. The highest expression of OX40 is found at sites of inflammation, such as the colon in inflammatory bowel disease, the CNS in mice with EAE and in tumors/tumor-draining LNs in mice and humans with cancer.

One involves direct deletion of OX40 positive cells through a cytotoxic Ab, while the other targets the OX40 ligand in attempt to decrease OX40-specific signaling. 15, 37 Antibody directed deletion of OX40 T cells showed therapeutic promise in EAE, as it was able to ameliorate ongoing signs of disease. 15 This was accomplished using a ricin conjugated OX40-specific Ab that was shown to directly target myelin-specific T cells within the CNS of mice with EAE. This therapy led to a 2-log reduction in the myelin-specific T cells isolated from the CNS, which correlated well with a reduction in disease score. While this therapy worked well there has been some concern regarding this approach, because other cell types have more recently been identified to express OX40 including T regulatory cells and PMNs. 10, 56 The second approach involves agents that target/bind to the OX40 ligand, thus limiting OX40-specific signals in activated T cells. The OX40 ligand is upregulated at the site of inflammation in several autoimmune models 2 and hence OX40 ligand blockade was a logical extension for treatment of inflammatory disorders. Initial reports showed that injection of an OX40:Ig fusion protein was effective at inhibiting clinical signs of disease in EAE when administered after disease onset. 37 It was also shown that OX40 ligand blockade administered during a relapse episode was effective at tempering disease; however, as soon as treatment was stopped the mice relapsed. 37 Therefore, it appeared that blocking OX40 signaling was able to reduce T-cell effector function, but not eliminate the cells responsible for causing the disease. OX40 ligand blockade has been used to temper a variety of autoimmune/inflammatory models including asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, viral-induced lung inflammation, graft-vs-host disease, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. 2, 57 Genentech is now developing a humanized OX40 ligand Ab, which is currently being tested in a phase I clinical trial for asthma.

The initial report showed that both OX40L:Ig and anti-OX40 had similar activity to regress tumors in cancer-bearing mice. 14 Although, there has been a more recent report that suggests the OX40L:Ig fusion protein has better anti-tumor efficacy than the anti-mouse OX40 agonist Ab (termed OX86). 58 The OX40-specific anti-tumor efficacy has been observed in several tumor models, including sarcoma, melanoma, colon cancer, breast carcinoma, lung cancer, glioma, prostate cancer. 2 The anti-tumor efficacy generated by OX40 agonists is dependent on both CD4 and CD8 T cells and it has been shown that OX40 agonists do enhance tumor-Ag specific memory T-cell development. 14,59 Subsequently, another report has shown that anti-OX40 administration greatly augments the adoptive transfer of tumor-reactive T cells. 60 Anti-OX40 showed similar therapeutic efficacy to IL-2 in supporting tumor-reactive T-cell mediated destruction of lung-metastases. However, IL-2 in combination with adoptive immunotherapy did not support the eradication of brain metastases, while anti-OX40 showed powerful synergy to eradicate brain metastases. 60 It was not clear why anti-OX40 was able to augment the efficacy of T cells while IL-2 was not, but it may be linked to differential expression of T-cell surface proteins and their ability to help break the blood brain barrier.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 165, "end": 167, "text": "57", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 608, "end": 610, "text": "58", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 791, "end": 792, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1123, "end": 1125, "text": "60", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1438, "end": 1440, "text": "60", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Altering Memory T-Cell Generation/Function through the OX40 Axis for Therapeutic Benefit in Autoimmunity, Cancer and Hosts Harboring Chronic Pathogens"}, {"text": "While it is clear that OX40 agonists given as a single agent can enhance anti-tumor immunity in cancer-bearing hosts, there are models where its activity alone is not enough to cure mice of disease. Hence, there have been a number of studies that have attempted combination therapies with vaccines/cytokines and anti-OX40. 54, 61, 62 These combination therapies have included GM-CSF secreting whole tumor vaccines as well as the addition of innate cytokines, both of which showed promising synergy. 54, 61, 62 It was shown that anti-OX40 in combination with a GM-CSF secreting whole cell vaccine expressing the Her-2/neu tumor Ag was able to enhance CD8 T-cell responses and regress tumors (breast cancer model). 62 However, the vaccine alone showed very little anti-tumor efficacy, which correlated with a weak Her-2-specific CD8 T-cell response. It was subsequently shown that the increase in Her-2-specific CD8 T cells elicited via the combination treatment was dependent on anti-OX40 accentuating CD4 T-cell help. Another combinatorial approach that has shown great promise for tumor immunotherapy is combining anti-OX40 with innate cytokine(s), especially IL-12. One of the theoretical limitations of priming the immune system to tumor-specific Ags is the lack of \"danger\" signals (e.g., CpG, dsRNA, LPS, etc\u2026) known to elicit innate cytokines when tumor Ags are presented to the immune system in vivo. As previously mentioned, IL-12 is necessary to mediate the survival of anti-OX40-stimulated CD4 T cells and the combination of anti-OX40 and IL-12 in tumor-bearing mice showed synergistic therapy. 54 This combination was therapeutically effective in the poorly immunogenic prostate cancer model, TRAMP-C1, where neither IL-12 nor anti-OX40 alone showed any therapeutic efficacy. 54 IL-12 and anti-OX40 also showed dramatic therapeutic synergy in an active immunization model using a tumor-dendritic fusion vaccine injected directly into the spleen. 54 Whether IL-12 actually enhances survival of OX40 stimulated tumor-reactive T cells or increases Th1/Tc1 immunity was not directly ascertained in these models, but most likely both mechanisms are involved to enhance OX40-mediated tumor destruction. OX40 agonists have also been shown to enhance T-cell responses to chronic pathogens (e.g., viruses and bacteria). In particular, anti-OX40 was administered into mice harboring a chronic cytomegalovirus known to replicate in visceral organs (i.e., salivary gland). 63 The initial study showed that anti-OX40 enhanced viral specific effector T-cell differentiation leading decreased viral replication in the salivary gland. Subsequently this group treated mice during the initial stage of infection and found that anti-OX40 greatly enhanced CD8 T-cell responses during the early stages of infection, which led to protective immunity. 64 The OX40 agonist strategy was also beneficial against hosts infected with Cryptococcus neoformans, where the infection resides in the lungs and becomes persistent. 65 The persistence of this pathogen is characterized by immune deviation to a nonclearing Th2 response, leading to chronic eosinphilia in the lungs. 65 Administration of an OX40L:Ig fusion protein drove a cytokine switch from Th2 to Th1 and reduced the pathogen burden and reduced the eosinphilia. OX40-specific elimination of C. neoformans was dependent on IFN-a/IL-12, as injection of an OX40 agonist to IFN-a or IL-12 ko mice harboring the pathogen was not able to resolve the infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 323, "end": 326, "text": "54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 327, "end": 330, "text": "61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 331, "end": 333, "text": "62", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 499, "end": 502, "text": "54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 503, "end": 506, "text": "61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 507, "end": 509, "text": "62", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 713, "end": 715, "text": "62", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1605, "end": 1607, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1787, "end": 1789, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1957, "end": 1959, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2472, "end": 2474, "text": "63", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 2840, "end": 2842, "text": "64", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 3007, "end": 3009, "text": "65", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 3156, "end": 3158, "text": "65", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Altering Memory T-Cell Generation/Function through the OX40 Axis for Therapeutic Benefit in Autoimmunity, Cancer and Hosts Harboring Chronic Pathogens"}, {"text": "It is clear that OX40 agonists have potent immune stimulating properties in several disease models, which ultimately helps the host eradicate harmful/potentially lethal entities within the body.

However, in contrast to the mouse studies we found that the adjuvant affect lasted longer, up to a month after the injection. We also observed a transient in drop in lymphocyte counts in the peripheral blood seven days after the initial Ab infusion and this was followed by a rebound where the lymphocyte numbers increased over base-line values. Upon completion of the monkey studies, the FDA approved a Phase I clinical trial in patients with Stage IV cancer. So far we have treated 17 patients with relatively low toxicity and we have observed immune stimulatory effects in most of the patients post-anti-OX40 treatment. In particular we have observed an increase in cycling memory T cells starting with the CD4 T-cell population one week after Ab infusion, followed by CD8 T cells usually 2-4 weeks post-OX40 treatment. We have observed cycling T cells in both the central memory compartment (CD28 ) and effector memory (CD28 -) populations. The increase in cycling memory T cells usually lasts 28-days following Ab infusion, however in some patients this effect lasted during the entire two-month evaluation period.
