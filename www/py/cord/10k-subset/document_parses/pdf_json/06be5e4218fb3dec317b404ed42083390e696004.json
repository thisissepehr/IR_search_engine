Since astrocytes also have been found to be infected in vivo it seemed appropriate to test this cell type for interaction with a Borna disease virus-specific CD 4 + T cell line. Borna disease virus-infected astrocytes were found to be capable of presenting virus-specific antigen to virus-specific T cells in vitro. However, the response was significantly enhanced if the purified 38/39 kDa Borna disease virus-specific protein was added exogenously to the cultures. Beside the function as antigen-presenting cells for various antigens including virus-specific protein and myelin basic protein, persistently infected astrocytes were also found to act as target cells for a CD 4 + T cell line as shown in conventional 51Cr release assays after induction of MHC class iI expression by gamma interferon. Infection of astrocytes alone did not cause expression of this self antigen. It could be shown that the ability of CD 4 + BDV-specific T cells to mediate lysis was in part dependent on the stage of activation. Lymphocytes \"activated\" before testing exerted high lysis after only 4 h of coincubation with target cells, whereas \"resting\" T cells did not cause significant lysis until 12h of coincubation. The dependence of the interaction between effector and target cells on MHC class II antigen was demonstrated by the finding that antibodies to Ia antigens reduced lysis of target cells.",

The dissociated cell population was pooled and passaged through nylon wool (Fenwal Laboratories, Ill., U.S.A.) and seeded in RPMI 1.640 supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (1% v/v), L-glutamine (1% v/v) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Biochrom KG, Berlin, Federal Republic of Germany). After 8-14 days the cells were trypsinized and an aliquot was seeded on Lab-Tek chamber slides for further characterization. Primary astrocyte cultures were passaged weekly. The homogeneous astrocyte line F 10, cloned from a primary astrocyte culture by limiting dilution was provided by Dr. H. Wekerte, Munich. Astrocytes used as stimulator or target cells in appropriate assays were incubated with MHC class II-inducing recombinant mouse interferon gamma (rIFN-7) for 3 days prior to testing. The establishment of the T cell line NM 1 specific for the 38/39 kDa protein of BDV has been described previously [39] . Antigen-specific restimulation of this T cell line was performed in medium supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol (5 x 10-5 M; Merck, Darmstadt, Federal Republic of Germany), Nystatin (1 x 104I.U./ml), 1% autologous rat serum and 10-20~tg/ml BDV-specific 38/39kDa protein. After 3 days of antigen-specific restimulation, viable cells were purified by centrifugation over a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient and washed extensively thereafter. These freshly activated cells are referred to as \"activated\" T cells. These activated cells were then maintained for 10 days in medium supplemented with 10-15% supernatant from ConA-stimulated mouse spleen cells as a source for IL-2. Beyond 8 days of propagation in IL-2-conditioned medium these cells were referred to as \"resting\" T cells. The MBP-specific T cell lines Z 82 and S 19 (kindly provided by Dr. H.

Thus, these cells recognize their antigen only in context with syngeneic M H C class II antigens. In order to prove that the expression of M H C class II antigen was also essential for lysis, cytotoxicity assays were performed with rIFN-y treated BDV-infected astrocytes in the presence of antibodies to M H C class I (Ox 18) and class II (Ox 6) antigens. The results presented in Fig. 4 show that N M 1 cells again are able to lyse infected astrocytes in a time dependent manner, and furthermore, lysis was not inhibited by the mAb Ox 18. In contrast, antibodies against M H C class II (Ox 6) restriction elements suppressed cytolysis signifi-cantly.

The expression of CD 4 or CD 8 antigens was initially thought to be directly related to their function, where CD 4 + lymphocytes were described as noncytotoxic helper/inducer T cells and CD 8 + T cells were shown to exert cytotoxic or suppressor activity [38] . More recently, however, it has become evident that there is not necessarily a correlation between phenotype and function; it appears that the expression of CD 4 or CD 8 antigens on T cells is linked to their restriction by MHC class I or class II antigens, respectively, rather than to T lymphocyte function [50] .",

In the present study it is shown that persistently BDVinfected astrocytes only marginally induce an antigen-specific proliferation of NM 1 cells, whereas the presence of purified BDV-specific antigen triggered a stronger response. Furthermore, persistently infected astrocytes were as efficient in presenting MBP to specific T cells as their uninfected counterparts.

Regarding the first point, lysis mediated by MHC class Irestricted T cells is fast and mostly linear, in contrast to the rather prolonged period of effector/target incubation necessary to obtain significant lysis by MHC class II-restricted T cells. Another factor important for the outcome of cytotoxicity assays with CD 4 + T cells is related to the question of whether T cells are \"activated\" or \"resting\". It was clearly demonstrated that \"activated\" NM 1 cells cause much faster kinetics of lysis of target cells than \"resting\" NM 1 cells. This phenomenon seems to be dependent on the induction of MHC class II antigens on the respective target cells, since non-induced astrocytes are not lysed significantly at 4 h of cocultivation. However, after longer incubation periods untreated target cells were also lysed by \"activated\" T cells, although less effectively as compared to MHC class II-induced target cells. In contrast, \"resting\" T cells were not able to exert cytotoxic activity on untreated astrocytes. This latter finding underlines the MHC-dependence of the NM 1-mediated cytotoxic reaction.",

Since BDV is a noncytolytic virus, we cannot exclude that the late onset of immunemediated disease after BDV-infection might be caused by the low stimutatory activity of infected astrocytes. On the other hand, it is possible that the cellular immune response might be strongly influenced by BDV-antigen which is released from infected cells after immune-mediated lysis. In both cases the presentation of foreign antigen in association with class II MHC antigen might be possible, since alternative pathways of antigen presentation (endogenous vs. exogenous) have been suggested recently [51. Firstly, it has been demonstrated in several virus infections that protein processed by the endogenous pathway can not only be presented by MHC class I antigen, but also by class II MHC antigen [23, 36, 37] . Secondly, it has been shown that exogenously added protein can associate both with class I [12, 46, 48] and class II [1, 15] molecules for presentation to T cells.",

If BDVinfected astrocytes are also lysed in vivo as demonstrated in vitro by BDVspecific cytotoxic T cells, this might limit and ultimately terminate the stimulation of BDV-specific T cells, and consequently the immunopathological reaction.",
