They are typically prepared by overexpression and high-throughput purification and printing onto microscope slides. The arrays can be used to screen nearly the entire proteome in an unbiased fashion and have enormous utility for a variety of applications. These include protein-protein interactions, identification of novel lipid-and nucleic acid-binding proteins, and finding targets of small molecules, protein kinases, and other modification enzymes. Protein microarrays are thus powerful tools for individual studies as well as systematic characterization of proteins and their biochemical activities and regulation.",

These include enzymatic assays and interactions with proteins, lipids, small molecules, and nucleic acids ( 3, 8 ) . One advantage of protein microarrays is that an entire proteome can be screened in an unbiased fashion, thereby leading to the discovery of novel activities that were not anticipated. For example, screening of a yeast protein chip using biotinylated liposomes revealed many new lipid-binding proteins including enzymes involved in glycolysis ( 3 ) , and screening of a yeast proteome chip with yeast DNA revealed a novel metabolic enzyme, Arg5,6, that is associated with DNA and appears to regulate mitochondrial gene expression ( 9 ) .",

This study assigned candidate binding proteins for specific sequences, one of which was confirmed. Protein microarrays have also been used to assess antibody specificity ( 11 ) and for identification of autoreactive antibody in patients with diseases such as autoimmune diseases and cancer and thereby find candidate biomarkers and insights into the disease state ( 5 ) . Lastly, protein microarrays can be used to identify substrates of modification enzymes such as kinases and ubiquitation enzymes ( 12, 13 ) . (b) R3: 5 \u00a2 GGACCTTGAAAAAGAACTTC 3 \u00a2 . 5.

To date, two comprehensive expression libraries have been prepared that are suitable for production of yeast protein microarrays. Initially, a library was prepared in which 5,800 yeast ORFs were fused at their amino terminal coding sequences to glutathione-S -transferase and HisX6 coding sequences ( 3 ) . Subsequently, a movable ORF, or MORF, library was prepared in which 5,700 yeast ORFs were fused at their carboxy terminal coding sequences to His6 and IgG binding domain of protein A ( 14 ) . The MORF library contains GATEWAY-compatible sequences flanking the inserts, so the yeast ORFs can be shuttled into any vector. In each library the fusion protein is expressed from the GAL1 galactose promoter. A protocol for library construction is as follows: 3. Grow for several doubling times to an OD 600 of ~ 0.6-0.8.",

They include nitrocellulose and aldehyde surface chemistries for chemical attachment through lysines and affinity attachment methods such as nickelchelated slides for attaching His tagged proteins and glutathione for affinity attachment ( 15, 3, 16 ) . The different surfaces have advantages and disadvantages; nitrocellulose allows the attachment of large amounts of protein, and it along with chemical attachment methods results in random orientation of proteins away from the surface. It is likely that the activity of the attached molecule is lost for many molecules attached by these methods. Moreover, binding of probes to regions near the surface is likely to be sterically inhibited. Affinity attachment methods are more likely to retain activity and orient proteins away from the surface, although random presentation of protein surfaces from the slide is not attained. Different surfaces yield different backgrounds and it is prudent to test several surfaces whenever a new assay is employed. 1. Configure the contact arrayer and align the microscope slides (FAST, Path, or other types of slides see Note 1 ) to allow the maximum number of slides to be printed per run.

For each experiment, incubate two additional arrays with kinase buffer in the absence of kinase, which will serve as autophosphorylation reference slides.1. Care needs to be taken when printing samples with high glycerol content on surfaces other than nitrocellulose (nickel, ultrgap, etc.) in high humidity >40% because the spot diameter will differ and this could result in samples bleeding together.2. Probe-specific control spots must be added to each array. These include known concentrations of 3C protease (if used) as well as Alexa Fluor V5 antibody and V5-fusion constructs. These will be used to ascertain optimal probing conditions and antibody titer for protein probing experiments.3. Primers for sequencing of V5-fusions in pYES-DEST52 can be obtained from Invitrogen's Website. ORFs can be shuttles from any of the destination (DEST) vectors using the pDONR221 as an intermediary.4. When probing for protein-protein interactions, it is advisable to wash the arrays using three separate 50-mL conical tubes ",
