GSH acts as a nucleophilic scavenger and as an enzyme-catalyzed antioxidant in the event of electrophilic/oxidative tissue injury. Therefore, GSH has a major role as a protector of biological structures and functions. GSH depletion has been recognized as a hazardous condition during paracetamol intoxication. Conversely, GSH rescue, meaning recovery of the protective potential of GSH by early administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), has been found to be life-saving. Lack of GSH and electrophilic/oxidative injury have been identified among the causes of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Experimental and early clinical data (in ARDS) point to the role of NAC in the treatment of these conditions. Recently, orally given NAC has been shown to enhance the levels of GSH in the liver, in plasma, and notably in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Rescue of GSH through NAC needs to be appreciated as an independent treatment modality for an array of different diseases, all of which have one feature in common: pathogenetically relevant loss of GSH.",

Synthesis of GSH in the liver has been recognized as highly efficient, but other organs such as the lungs and the kindeys are also endowed with substantial synthesis capacities. Cell membranes in general are impermeable to the tripeptide glutathione. Hence, GSH is synthesised intracellularly only from the single amino acid constituents or their precursors [15, 24] . Since glycine and glutamate are abundantly available in the intracellular space, an adequate supply and transmembrane transport of cysteine into the cell becomes the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of GSH. Conversely, GSH can serve as a storage and transport form of cysteine in the extracellular space [30] . When intracellular cysteine is required, the breakdown of GSH is initiated by ?-glutamyl transpeptidase on the external surface of the cell membrane, followed by transmembrane transport of the single amino acid. Interestingly, enhancement of tissue glutathione concentration in the liver is achieved by feeding synthetic antioxidants. In mechanistic terms, this phenomenon has been attributed to a shift from predominantly hepatorenal towards enterohepatic circulation of glutathione through increased biliary glutathione flux [20] . The administration of exogenous N-acetylcysteine (NAC) also effectively meets intracellular needs of cysteine for the synthesis of GSH by supplementing precursor pools in a more physiological way [13, 27] .",

Obviously, successful protection results in a transient \"loss\" of GSH. Any single GSH moiety, once it is conjugated to electrophils and transported out in this form, and also when oxidized, is not immediately available for subsequent needs. Oxidized glutathione is reduced once again to the functional form via the glutathione reductase pathway. Under these conditions the loss of glutathione remains reversible. Conjugated GSH, however, is exported from the cell and processed to mercapturic acids, which are excreted in the urine. In these reactions, GSH is lost irreversibly and can be replaced only via ex novo synthesis. Irreversible loss of GSH occurs preferentially following oxidative stress. Under conditions of intense oxidative stress the rate of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) formation -through oxidation of GSH -is such as to surpass, and possibly exhaust, the intracellular glutathione reductase capacities; as a consequence an accumulation of intracellular GSSG will result. GSSG in turn, being toxic to the intracellular milieu beyond a critical concentration, is exported from the cell and hence lost to the reductase pathway [15, 27] .",

It is relevant that Cantin and coworkers [10] have reported increased levels of GSH in the alveolar epithelial lining fluid of healthy smokers.

It is thus somewhat surprising that the expansion of this knowledge to other states of GSH deficiency and electrophilic or oxidative injures in organs other than the liver became so tedious and cumbersome. But there were reasons. Direct detection of the electrophilic/oxidative attack in vivo, especially in the clinical setting, is still elusive and monitoring of the GSH/GSSG status is complicated, particularly when tissue parameters are more important than serum levels. Paracetamol intoxication is an acute event; by contrast, many of the other forms of glutathione stress, whether to the liver, the lung, or other organs, are more chronic than acute in nature, thereby leaving some space for other compensating defense mechanisms besides GSH and hence blurring the picture. Obviously the endogenous antioxidant defence mechanisms are working in concert, and although GSH is a \"first violin,\" the rest of the orchestra counts as well. Further, even with an identified lack of glutathione, often the question is: \"Does it matter? Is it relevant for a particular pathogenesis?\" Lastly, it was unclear whether the administration of NAC, either orally or intravenously, would increase the pool of GSH in a target tissue other than the liver. Fortunately the current state of the art shows that the concepts of GSH deficiency and rescue in electrophilic/oxidative tissue injury are steadily becoming more applicable in clinical medicine. Clearly, some of the questions raised have been answered, and if not totally so, then at least to an important degree. Some clinical examples that have attracted interest in this context will be discussed briefly.",

By the time of established ARDS the loss of GSH has already triggered subsequent events which fail to respond to GSH rescue [7] . Indeed, increased formation of GSSG has been found to be an extremely early indicator of pulmonary oxygen stress [14] . When NAC was administered in a 72-h intravenous regimen to a group of patients with early acute lung injury [31] and judged to be at risk of ARDS, the positive results of early administration became evident.

In addition, there is good evidence that high levels of reactive oxidant metabolites are being released by inflammatory cells in the lungs of IPF patients, resulting in important epithelial-ceU damage and inflammation [11] . In pathogenetic terms there is a certain similarity between ARDS and IPF, although the latter is of a chronic nature, contrasting with the dramatically acute events in ARDS. Since reactive oxygen metabolites which are released from inflammatory cells cause tissue lesions in IPF patients, it seems reasonable to assume a role for GSH deficiency in this part of the pathogenesis. Subsequently tissue injury itself becomes the appropriate stimulus for enhanced tissue repair including fibrogenesis as a correlate of scarring, and hence the result is tissue fibrosis. Recent in vitro evidence also indicates a role for GSH on this side of the pathogenesis of IPF [12] . Human lung fibroblasts, when incubated with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from IPF patients, displayed markedly increased proliferation. In the presence of physiologic concentrations of added GSH, however, the fibroblast proliferation was strongly suppressed. Similar effects were obtained by coincubation with cysteine or NAC but not with GSSG. Although the underlying mechanisms are thus far only partially clarified, the authors conclude that GSH in the extracellular milieu can suppress fibroblast proliferation in response to mitogens and that this activity is linked to the presence of a free sulfhydryl group. They also feel that GSH deficiency in IPF may favor fibroblast proliferation. GSH rescue in IPF patients would seem to be a promising addition to the treatment of this disease. So far, however, clinical data to this end are not available.",

            "text": "Glutathione deficiency has also been reported for symptom-free HIV-seropositive individuals [8] . GSH concentrations in plasma and alveolar epithelial lining fluid were found to amount to only 30% and 60%, respectively, of the levels detected in healthy control individuals. These data argue for a generalized deficiency of GSH, which is in contrast to the localized lack in IPF and somewhat similar to the pattern in ARDS. Four of the 14 HIV-seropositive individuals were on treatment with zidovudine, five had serological evidence of previous exposure to hepatitis B virus, and four had mild alterations in one of their lung function indices. It seems at least questionable whether these HIV-positives were still strictly symptom-free. Marked GSH deficiency and total absence of symptoms are hard to reconcile with each other. Is GSH deficiency in HIV-infected individuals epiphenomenal, or is it truly contributing to the course of the disease? Is there a role for GSH rescue in the treatment of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) ? Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the development of AIDS [18] . So far it is not quite clear whether oxidative stress is a cause or a consequence of GSH deficiency in HIV infection, but both conditions appear to be linked to each other interdependently in a vicious circle. In 1989 Dr6ge's group [16] reported that intracellular concentrations of GSH in blood monocytes and lymphocytes were slightly decreased in asymptomatic HIV-positive individuals when compared to normal controls, and stepwise stronger depletions were found in ARC (AIDS-related complex) or AIDS. In this last group, since at the time it was the only one treated, zidovudine treatment caused a certain recovery of the glutathione levels. On the other side, in vitro data show that thiol compounds such as NAC increased the ability of mononuclear cells from patients with ARC or AIDS to form T-cell colonies [34] and inhibited HIV expression after stimulation with human tumor necrois factor (TNF) [29] . Intracellular thiols were found to regulate the activation of nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NFKB) and thereby the transcription of the HIV virus [32] .",

DTC has a free thiol group in its molecule, and although it is not a precursor of GSH, a general sulfhydrylsparing effect is conceivable [4, 28] . Unfortunately, and in spite of rapidly accumulating evidence in the experimental setting, clinical data with respect to GSH rescue in HIV infection are not available, although the case for this treatment modality appears strong, particularly in the early stages of the disease.

For IPF and HIV infection, the concept of GSH rescue is less developed; in particular, clinical data are missing. In addition, these latter conditions are chronic in nature, as opposed to paraeetamol intoxication or early lung injury. Intravenous administration of NAC, although effective in acute situations, in a chronic regimen has considerable practial limitations, and the question arises whether oral administration would be equally trustworthy. Oral administration of NAC has been recognized as efficient as intravenous treatment for paracetamol intoxication, and GSH levels in liver and plasma are readily restored [19] .",

At this point it seems important that pathologies due to an excess of GSH have not been reported so far, but could become a potential threat in case of exaggerated GSH corrections.

Dieses Buch will dem interessierten Arzt mikrobiologische und infektiologische Grundkenntnisse vermitteln. Zwar bleibt das Buch in seinen klinischen Anteilen unbefriedigend, doch ist es in seinem mikrobiologischen Tell ausffihrlich und enth/ilt einige tabellarische Obersichten, die in vergleichbaren Kompendien vermiBt werden. Es ist als Einstiegslektfire ffir Medizinstudenten und junge Arzte geeignet, die sich einem Gebiet nS.hern wollen, das im Medizinstudium noch immer zu kurz kommt Daran gemessen, weist das Buch ein akzeptables Preis-Leistungs-Verhfiltnis auf.B.
