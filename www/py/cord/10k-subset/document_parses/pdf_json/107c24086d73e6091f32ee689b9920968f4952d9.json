In the endless spiral of staying ahead in retaliatory capability, some governments continue to a.

When the Iberian conquistadores explored the New World, one of their many discoveries was the use by the peoples of Central and South America of toxic substances to raise the effectiveness of their bow-and-arrow armories. Parreira brava (pareira, or Chondodendron tomentosum) is the Portuguese designation of a vine found in the Southern hemisphere, the source of a traditional diuretic treatment. Curare, another derivative term in Portuguese (from kurari, in Carib), and pareira are the sources of a strychnine-like substance capable of arresting motor-nerve reactions in physiological experimentation. They can, in sufficient dosages and with much accompanying pain, kill human beings. 3 Strychnine, an alkaloid, is found in the seeds of a tree native to India, Strychnos nux vomica. Strychnine was long used as a tonic and as a stimulant of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. But its effects on the overall human organism, highly toxic, finally excluded the substance from modern therapeutic use. 4 Poisons of this category were at the root of the formulation in 1675 of the Treaty of Strassburg (today Strasbourg, France), a protocol designed to ban poisoned projectiles. This pact became part of the-nearly-persistent Western taboo on the use of toxic weapons, a proscription finally broken in the 20th century with the episodic uses of \"poison gas\". Then came the brash use in 2002 of toxic agents by Russia's Alpha anti-terrorist team to overcome the seizure of hundreds of hostages in a Moscow theater by breakaway ethnic Chechens. This violent action took the lives of nearly 130 innocent theatergoers.",

Conscious of the historic abhorrence of stealth on the part of an enemy (at least in many of the Western cultures), Fulton sought to cope with the element of furtiveness during his blandishments for a contract from the French naval ministry in 1799. According to biographer Cynthia Owen Philip, the American inventor delivered to the French navy in July of that year, along with a letter of petition to do business, an essay on \"Observations on the Moral Effects of the Nautilus Should It Be Employed with Success\". Fulton's twofold purpose was \"to defend the submarine as a humane weapon and enhance his reputation as a humane inventor\". 5 (p.95) This justification for military submersibles \"exude[d] suppressed rage and frustration at the [French] government for not having accepted his magnanimous and humanitarian scheme\"\u2026 . 5 (p.95) If the French should not adopt his plan for an undersea vessel, Fulton foresaw the British and Americans quickly bringing their own submarines to perfection-as could lesser nations such as Denmark and Sweden. The latter would thus dispense with the large costs of building surface navies, ran his argument, simply by equipping themselves with underwater craft.",

This denial by Napoleon of an opportunity to gain a military advantage by the admission of a novel device into his armory is not unlike the Chinese denial of the use of gunpowder for warlike purposes; a decision taken in the 10 th century: an option that cost them dearly when faced with gunpowder-based British sea power in the 18 th century and thereafter.",

Fiedler devised a small model of his notion of a Flammenwerfer, capable of spurting a flame of burning petroleum product (most often oil) a distance of 18 m, and a larger model intended to be vehicle-borne-and with twice the range.

At that time a colleague described Haber as of lively spirit, impulsive, even capricious, a good lecturer who could discuss amicably almost any subject. Haber achieved his place in the pantheon of research, before the conflict, by co-developing the Haber-Bosch process for the synthesis of ammonia from its elements-and for which he would win the Nobel prize in chemistry awarded in 1919.

Here we have the epitome of dual use: scientifico-technological processes capable-through minor adjustments in production-of application to either civil or military/terroristic ends. Haber appears to have fancied himself a technical superstar of the war, explaining to scientific colleagues such as Otto Hahn that Imperial Germany's use of gas was justified by the first use of (tear) gas by the French against German troops in December 1914. First use by the French was not true, according to his principal biographers, Dietrich Stolzenberg and son Ludwig F. Haber. A few weeks later Russian troops on the Rawka River west of Warsaw were attacked by a non-lethal lachrymatory gas, xylyl bromide, known to German military engineers as T-stoff.

One-hundred fifty tonnes of chlorine were released from 6,000 pressurized cylinders in ten minutes over a sector 7,000 m wide, near Langemarck outside Ypres. The Franco-Algerian units were routed, but the Germans advancing (and still lacking promised masks) were impeded by pockets of gas. Nightfall came, as it were saving the day for the Allies, despite 5,000 killed and easily three times as many injured by the toxic clouds. 12 (pp.149-161) In actions that followed along this front, French and British forces retaliated in kind. Surviving soldiers were invalided, many of these men finally coughing themselves to death. The wartime occupation of chemist Haber, who was back in Berlin by 15 May 1915 to receive friends at dinner, was the direct cause later the same night of his wife's suicide. Fourteen-year old Ludwig Haber (whose mother was Haber's first wife), awakened by a gunshot, found his stepmother in a pool of blood in the family's garden. Immerwahr had used her husband's service pistol to do away with herself. \"Haber was, without a doubt, the originator of chemical warfare\", the Nobelwinning biologist Max Perutz maintains. 12 (p.81), 13 The earliest chemical-warfare assaults were primitive and risky maneuvers, therefore, with the gases used likely to be blown back by shifting winds literally into the faces of those launching them. Chlorine was the first agent used, unreliable in the pathological sense but with enormous psychological impact on French, British and (in Poland) Russian troops. The idea was to have \"gas clouds\" enter the respiratory system and deprive the organism of oxygen by inflaming the bronchi and the pulmonary air sacs. This caused a strain on the heart and, within 24 hours, pulmonary edema would follow with a drowning of the lungs. If the victim survived a gas attack, he became almost always a chronic invalid, society's charge.",

Plans included developing a methodology and timetable for the destruction of abandoned weapons, under the guidance of both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Chemical and Biological Arms Control Institute.

Atropine closes down the overly stimulated nerves, but this sedation can bring new risks; oxime drugs, on the other hand, can separate sarin from acetylcholinesterase so that this enzyme can resume its normal functions. Another counter-agent is ricin, made from the castor bean. Dissipated as a liquid or in aerosol form, however, ricin is toxic to the blood, leading to slow death by circulatory collapse.

The bacterium causing most such infections is called Clostridium perfringens, producing a protein known as alpha toxin.

In November 1942 the Japanese moved into Congshan and burned the infested dwellings, \"as the villagers were herded to a nearby slope to watch and wail as their possessions were incinerated.\" 35 At the war's end, perhaps as many as 2 million chemical projectiles remained in Manchuria, or northeastern China. Whereas the living germs stored in biological weapons have long since become extinct, chemical ammunition (loaded mainly with mustard gas) remains potent and perilous. The Chemical Weapons Convention requires that such stockpiles be destroyed by 2007. In December 1996 the Chinese and Japanese governments agreed to a combined effort to clean up the residual mess in Manchuria.",

Fort Wingate had been used at that time as an impact area for missiles fired from Dugway and other army installations. 36 A cause-and-effect link was not confirmed. Yet the suspicion remained, and at least one historian of biological warfare, Leonard A. Cole of Rutgers University, called for public disclosure by the Department of Defense. Indeed, during the same year the United States Congress called for the Department of Health and Human Services \"to examine the feasibility of shifting some biological defense research from the army to the National Institutes of Health\". 36 It is remarkable that physician, army colonel and biological-weapons builder named Kanatjan Alibekov (he calls himself a bioweaponeer), deserted in Kazahstan in 1992 from the Russian-directed biological-weapons program, where he was its first deputy-director. Alibekov has maintained, after establishing himself in the United States, that Russian stockpiling of anthrax bacteria and smallpox and plague viruses has not been interrupted-and that research on these agents continues under the guise of defensive readiness against biological attack by an adversary. Now known as Ken Alibek, the former Soviet specialist warned the world that the threat of biological terrorism, in either combat or civil strife, cannot be mitigated. Even if vaccination against every possible agent were feasible, Alibek prefers that the world of research concentrate on (a) preventing disease that might occur after exposure, and (b) treating diseases that do occur. Work of this type would also succor those contracting any dread malady under natural conditions.",

Three others (Egypt, Libya, Taiwan) were suspected of possessing them, and North Korea figured on some analysts' lists.

The Convention on Biological Weapons, first opened to ratification by its signatory nations in 1975, lacked sufficient measures for verification of adherence to a treaty designed to ban the manufacture, storage and use of biological arms.
