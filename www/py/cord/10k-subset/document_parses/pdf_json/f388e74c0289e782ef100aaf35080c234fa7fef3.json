With the emergence of new infections and re-emergence of known diseases, the books on infectious diseases might never be closed.",

The predicted emerging disease hotspots due to zoonotic diseases and vector borne pathogens are more concentrated in lower latitude developing countries (Jones et al 2008) . It is also feared that in all probabilities the next fl u pandemic too would raise its head from Asia. Multiple factors mentioned above are perhaps present and interacting with one another at the same time and at the same place. Main factors believed to drive the increased incidence, geographic range or both of emerging and re-emerging pathogens have been identifi ed by conducting a systematic review of emerging diseases literature. Changes in land use or agricultural practices and changes in human demographics and society are the most common drivers. Followed by poor population health (e.g. HIV, malnutrition); hospital and medical procedures; pathogen evolution (e.g. antimicrobial drug resistance, increased virulence); contaminating food sources or water supplies; international travel; failure of public health system; international trade and climate change (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria Sonya 2005) .",

In India, the research domains in emerging infectious diseases are in various stages of development i.e. basic and fundamental, applied and strategic, translational and operational. Some of our infrastructural facilities are comparable to the best in the world. We also have a large pool of talented scientists. But we have not always clicked as an orchestra to produce symphonies. India has had its share of emerging infections (Vibrio cholerae 0139, plague, Gp-B rota virus, HIV/AIDS, Nipah virus, chikungunya fever, Chandipura encephalitis, H5N1 infl uenza, etc.) laced with successes and controversies. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is the apex organization for health research within the country, and it has played a very signifi cant role in research on these organisms.",

            "text": "In late 1990s the ICMR stepped up its funding in communicable diseases which also accelerated research inputs for emerging infections diseases. One of the unparralled strengths of the ICMR is the network of institutes devoted to specifi c infectious diseases, and a chain of regional centres which are strategically located in areas where the chances of new and emerging infections raising their heads are high like in the North-Eastern part of the country, the Andaman Islands, and the like. The Government of India had started an Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) in 1997-1998. Surveillance forms an important cornerstone for control of emerging infections. The ICMR addressed the needs of the programme by providing inputs in capacity building, strengthening of laboratories, developing diagnostic tests especially the rapid ones, characterization of pathogens, surveillance of drug resistance, etc. In order to facilitate research in the unknown, new and exotic agents with minimal or no risk to the scientists and the environment, a chain of bio-safety level-3 laboratories has been set up with largest being at the National Institute of Virology's Microbial Containment Complex at Pune. A modern BSL-4 facilities is also under construction in the same complex. A BSL-3 laboratory for aerosol animal experiments has also became operational. A state-of-the-art modern biology laboratory complete with transgenic animal facility has been created as a support to research in enteric infections at Kolkata. The animal experiment facilities in almost all its Institutes have been upgraded to conform to accepted national standards. Obtaining good quality animals for laboratory experiments had become extremely diffi cult because of some strict regulations. The ICMR stepped in to fi ll this void and has started to set up a center for non-human primate breeding and research at Susnavgarh, Maharashtra. A world-class facility for providing biological resources especially the large animals is also expected to come up shortly in Genome Valley, Hyderabad. Microbial repositories for organism of major public health importance have been created, these repositories house large number of strains which are made available to other research organizations, for testing new tools, understating hostparasite interaction etc. Rapid molecular tools for virus identifi cation have been installed, (like real time polymerase chain reaction [PCR], nucleic acid sequence-based amplifi cation [NASBA] platform, micro-array technology). Other examples of some major equipments installed include confocal microscopes, sequencers, fl owcytometers, microarray facilities, highthroughput screening equipment, gas chromatography mass-spectroscopy, and DEXAs. Several of ICMR laboratories have been equipped with electron microscopes notably the digital cryo transmission electron microscope at Pune. It was with this frontline tool in rapid diagnosis that SARS virus was picked up, in a urine sample of a suspected person. The fi rst indication that encephalitis outbreak in Andhra Pradesh may be due to Chandipura virus in 2003 also come from electron-microscopy studies. Very useful information about circulating strains, seasonality and other epidemiological factors is emerging from surveillance for infl uenza, rotavirus, measles, leptospirosis etc. When chikungunya fever started in India in 2005 and spread to large number of states in 2006, it was an ICMR institute which created a diagnostic test and made it available to all the States. Early warning tools for dengue, Japanese encephalitis, malaria are being better refi ned using geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing. A warning to the impending Japanese encephalitis out break was given to Tamil Nadu Government in 2006. As many of the new and emerging infections are viruses, and realizing that there is an acute shortage of training virologist and infrastructure in the country, the ICMR is addressing this issue at two fronts. A Masters course in virology has been started at Pune, and it is planned to create regional centers of excellence in viral diseases in the country.",

Training courses of other support facilities are also organized, i.e. conventional diagnosis, diagnosis using tools of modern biology, rapid response modules, rapid assessment techniques, quality assurance and control and bio-safety measures.",

A beginning has been made of using gene and protein-based microarray, it should be expanded to detect pathogens, to monitor drug-resistance, characterize responses to recent infections, and facilitate development of new drugs and vaccines. Laboratories have acquired the ability to sequence microbial genomes in a few days, this period could be further shortened. Studies on host-vector-microbe interactions are few and far in between. They must be promoted to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of infectious diseases and host defences. Geographical information system and satellite imaging should be more extensively used to support surveillance and response. Tools for diagnosis, treatment and prevention need to be continually developed, laboratories for testing and fi eld sites for their evaluation need to be upgraded and maintained on long term basis. All this would require a very close interaction and bonding between the research community on one hand and the public health, agriculture and animal husbandry on the other. The importance of understanding the factors that increase contact between wild-life and humans in developing predictive approaches to disease emergence cannot be over emphasized. There is also a critical need for health monitoring and identifi cation of new potentially zoonotic pathogens in wild life populations, as a forecast measure for emerging infectious diseases.",
