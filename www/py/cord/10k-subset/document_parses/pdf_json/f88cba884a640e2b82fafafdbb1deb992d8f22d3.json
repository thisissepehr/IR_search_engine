Cytometric analysis of cell culture synchronized by contact inhibition revealed the elongation of the S phase of the cell cycle in EAhy 926 cells under the influence of influenza virus. This result was shown in an EAhy 926 culture infected with influenza virus and treated with nocodazole. Comparison of a lung carcinoma A549 cell line in which influenza virus causes G 0 /G 1 arrest and of an endothelial EAhy 926 cell line in which the same infection leads to S phase elongation allows it to be suggested that different effects of influenza virus on cell cycle dynamics depend on the origin of infected cells.",

Apart from the main function of maintaining homeostasis and regulation of the inflammation process in the organ ism, the endothelial cells are the basis of blood tissue barrier, i.e., they regulate the diffusion, active com pound transfer, and immune system cell migration from the blood flow to the surrounding tissues and back again; they also take part in the angiogenesis and endocrine processes (Petrischev and Vlasov, 2003; Lupinskaya, 2008) .The barrier function of endothe lium makes it a target for viral pathogens (Kota, 2012) . It was shown previously by our group that influenza viruses are able to reproduce themselves in the endot helial cells both in vitro and in vivo and to cause their death by apoptosis or necrosis (Azarenok, 2014) . According to recent data, the development of virus induced apoptosis is preceded by changes in cell cycle dynamics, with it being arrested at a certain phase (Stewart et al., 1997; Fehr and Yu, 2013) . Some DNA containing viruses (adenoviruses, papilloma viruses) have been shown to induce the S phase, thus allowing the reproduction of large number of viral genomes (Cheng et al., 2013) . The reproduction of the human immunodeficiency RNA virus is characterized by G 2 /M arrest of infected cells (Stewart et al., 1997; Li et al., 2010) . Other RNA containing viruses (SARS, influenza virus) are able to block cells' G 0 /G 1 exit (He et al., 2010) .",

Nocodazole treatment of EAhy 926 was per formed for 16 h with an end concentration of 0.05 \u00b5g/mL.

Uninfected EAhy 926 cells were used as control. The virus strain was provided by the Laboratory of Evolu tionary Variability of Influenza Virus, Influenza Insti tution, Ministry of Health, Russia. The infectious activity of the virus was found from titration of virus containing material in a 1 day culture of EAhy 926 with a titration coefficient of 10 and calculated by the generally accepted method (Reed and Muench, 1938) . A virus dose of TCID 50/cell had been chosen in a previous investigation as it does not induce early apo ptosis (Azarenok, 2014) . Twelve hours after the start of proliferation, the EAhy 926 cell culture synchronized at the G 0 /G 1 phase was incubated in a maintaining medium with virus for 1 h.

However, taking into consider ation the total cell number decrease during viral repro duction (Fig. 1) , these changes could be explained as results of different sensitivities of the cells at different cell cycle phases. Comparison of the cytometric data with the results of growth analysis allowed it to be sug gested that the chosen virus dose slowed down the rate of the S phase in the cells of infected human endothe lium culture. Nocodazole treatment of both control and infected cells (8 h after infection) was performed in order to prove this notion. The nocodazole syn chronized the EAhy 926 cell culture in the G 2 /M phase by disrupting the microtubules of the mitotic spindle. If the viral reproduction blocks or slows down the S phase of the infected cells, the following nocoda sole treatment will weaken or cancel the G 2 /M phase synchronization in the infected cultures. This effect was demonstrated in our experiments (Fig. 3) .",
