Miniaturization of key bio-diagnostic techniques, such as: nucleic acid detection and quantification, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA fingerprinting, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), results in substantial reduction of reaction volumes (expensive samples/reagents) and shorter reaction times. Droplet microfluidics (DMF) is one of several miniaturized bio-sample handling techniques available for manipulating clinical samples and reagents in microliter (10 \u22126 L) to picoliter (10 \u221212 L) volume regime. Electro-actuation of sample and reagent in the form of droplets in the aforementioned volume regime, using dielectrophoresis (DEP) and/or Electrowetting (EW) are achieved by means of patterned, insulated metal electrodes on one or more substrates. In this work, we have utilized electro-actuation based DMF technology, integrated with suitably tailored resistive micro-heaters and temperature sensors, to achieve chip based real-time, quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). This qRT-PCR micro-device was utilized to detect and quantify the presence of influenza A and C virus nucleic acids, using in-vitro synthesized viral RNA segments. The experimental analysis of the DMF micro-device confirms its capabilities in qRT-PCR based detection and quantification of pathogen samples, with accuracy levels comparable to established commercial bench-top equipment (PCR efficiency \u223c95%). The limit of detection (LOD) of the chip based qRT-PCR technique was estimated to be \u223c5 copies of template RNA per PCR reaction.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses, which belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae, are important pathogens of humans and animals. 1 Influenza viruses from three different genera are currently circulating in the human population: influenza A, influenza B and influenza C viruses. Of these, influenza A viruses have the greatest impact on the population, in terms of severity of disease and because of their greater capacity to generate new strains through a high rate of mutagenesis causing genetic drift. Influenza A viruses originated from wild aquatic birds whose population contains a very large reservoir of influenza A viruses from which new emerging strains can enter the human population, directly or through another species such as swine. These emerging influenza A viruses can on occasion trigger pandemics, the worst of which, to date, was the 1918 \"Spanish Flu\" pandemic which was also the worst natural disaster of the 20th century. 1 Influenza C is a more benign pathogen than influenza A or B, in term of severity of disease and reported cases; however it is under-diagnosed and underestimated because most clinical laboratories do not test for this agent. Recently ProvLab investigated the importance of this agent in Alberta. 2 Testing for influenza viruses is often required for patient care and is of the utmost public health importance. Molecular techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 3, 4 and immunoassays 5 have now become the methods of choice for virus detection in clinical samples. Real time, quantitative, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), which uses the well-known PCR technique for DNA amplification along with a specific molecular probe that allows for target detection in real time. 6 When this technique is brought to bear on RNA targets, such as the genome of influenza viruses, a preliminary step of \"reverse transcription\" is required to transcribe the RNA segment into a complementary DNA (cDNA) segment. Nowadays, this is almost always done through a \"one tube\" technique, involving a reaction mixture containing both a reverse transcriptase enzyme and a thermostable DNA polymerase, with the two enzymatic reactions performed serially through temperature control. 7 z E-mail: kaler@ucalgary.ca For influenza A testing, ProvLab has adapted an assay designed and implemented by the Centers for Disease Control, as described in, 8 and which uses the common methodology of hydrolysis probe for detection. 6 For influenza C, the real time RT-PCR method developed at ProvLab, 2 was in fact validated to work with either a hydrolysis probe or a beacon probe. 6 The beacon probe has the property that it can be used for both real time detection and post amplification detection, which was a useful stepping stone in some preliminary chip based post amplification viral screening experiments, not detailed in this report. 9 Miniaturization of nucleic acid amplification based pathogen detection methods promises to reduce the cost of these bio-assays, by utilizing ultra-low volume of samples/reagents (\u03bcL to pL) and furthermore enables shorter turnaround time (sample-to-detection time) due to faster reaction kinetics at the miniaturized scale. Such PCR micro-devices can either be implemented using conventional closed channel microfluidic 10, 11, 12 or droplet microfluidic technologies. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Chip based PCR amplification using closed channel microfluidics was first to be explored; 10, 12, [18] [19] [20] however, such methods suffer from problems such as: the requirement of valves and micro-tubes for sample loading and fluidic control, bio-adsorption in the exposed microfluidic channels etc. The closed channel microfluidic PCR chips clearly established the potential of chip based PCR technology. Droplet based PCR 21, 22 has recently emerged as a more popular alternative method for on-chip PCR reactions. In this method, PCR droplets are thermal cycled by either keeping the droplet stationary in a variable temperature control zone (static droplet PCR) 22, 23 or by moving the droplet continuously between two or more different temperature control zones (transport based droplet PCR). 21 The transport based droplet PCR technique is in many ways superior to the static method due to its shorter temperature ramp times, resulting in fast and more efficient chip based PCR reactions.",

The DMF electro-actuation method was preferred due to its precision dispensing, transport and mixing capability of ultrafine PCR reaction volumes over patterned surfaces. The two electro-actuation techniques: Electrostatic/Droplet dielectrophoresis (D-DEP) 16, 17 and Electrowetting (EW) 13, 14 have been leveraged through tailored microelectrode architectures to facilitate the required on-chip droplet manipulation. A different set of micro-electrode pattern was used to create resistive micro-heaters 23, 24 and resistance temperature detectors (RTDs), 24 required during the PCR thermal cycling. A nano-textured super hydrophobic (SH) surface 25 was engineered in order to prevent sample adsorption and droplet collapse, during the on-chip qRT-PCR detection. Performance of the integrated DMF device was analyzed in real-time chip based qRT-PCR detection of in-vitro synthesized influenza A and C virus RNAs during 30-35 PCR cycles. The reported work demonstrates the utility of the electro-actuation based qRT-PCR micro-device for detecting and quantifying the presence of viral nucleic acids with a detection threshold (limit of detection) of <5 viral nucleic acid copies per PCR reaction.",

Methods for chip-based temperature control can be classified as: contact or non-contact. In non-contact temperature control methods, 26, 27 heating and temperature cycling is achieved by using schemes such as: selective infrared heating, 26 laser induced heating 27 and thermocouple temperature sensing. Although effective, such methods often require specialized heating equipment (laser sources and other optical components) and additional temperature reference chamber (for accurate temperature measurement), which results in complicated micro-device design and relatively lower degree of integration and miniaturization. Contact temperature control methods can utilize commercial thermo-cycler, Peltier thermoelectric element designs 28 to achieve nearly the same thermal conditions as in case of the conventional PCR set-up. More recently, as an alternative, commercial micro-heaters and thermocouples have been integrated with microfluidic platform to create PCR microsystems. 28 Though having excellent performances, this micro-device requires manual placement/integration of commercial heaters and thermocouples, to the back side of the microfluidic chip, resulting in reproducibility problems related to their manual placement. As an alternative, microheaters and resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) sensors can be micro-fabricated on the same substrate, along with the microfluidic electrodes, to create a more compact PCR micro-device. 23, 24 These integrated thermal elements improve the overall thermal transfer from the heating element to the PCR chamber and increase the accuracy as well as the reproducibility of the required temperature. Among the contact temperature control methods, the micro-fabricated resistive heaters/RTDs have smaller power requirement, faster thermal response and higher heating ramp rates and are therefore preferred for the proposed qRT-PCR micro-device.",

Such EW droplet actuation schemes frequently make use of two patterned surfaces, separated by a gap which depends upon the size of droplets to be handled (see Figure 3a ). 13 In most popular EW electrode architectures, the lower substrate consists of large arrays of co-planer square or rectangular shaped electrodes, which are controlled and switched using interdigitized, programmable input. 13, 14 The top surface and the gap are utilized to facilitate a larger droplet deformation, which helps to reduce the droplet actuation voltage. The two surfaces, gap, electrode geometry and dielectric insulation are key components of modern EW based DMF, which can achieve droplet dispensing, mixing/splitting and extensive droplet transport of microliter to nanoliter sample volumes. 14 Single surface based EW schemes require relatively higher actuation voltages (>100 V pp ) and/or super hydrophobic surfaces, in order to induce the large contact angle change necessary for such EW droplet actuations. 31 EW actuation schemes provide versatile droplet handling capabilities but are often restricted by the sequential, digital actuation, requiring active electrode switching and hence a complex electrode architecture and electrical control/switching system.

In this study, we used a modification of our previous influenza A detection protocol that was validated at ProvLab, which consisted of using the TaqMan Fast Virus One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix. This master mix requires a smaller reaction volume (10 \u03bcL) and allows for faster thermal cycling. Amplification was performed by one-step RT-PCR using the TaqMan Fast Virus One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix, 0.8 \u03bcM each of sense and antisense primers and 0.2 \u03bcM of the labeled probe (see Table I ). Five \u03bcl of in-vitro RNA was combined with 5 \u03bcl of the master mix. The reaction parameters are described in Table II .

The top nitride layer is furthermore rendered super hydrophobic (SH) using a soft-lithography based nano-texturing technique, as reported in. 25 The nano-textured SH surface ensures a high droplet contact angle (CA \u223c 156 \u2022 ) while significantly minimizes the extent of sample adsorption and the resulting loss of CA. Advantage of such SH surfaces for DEP liquid actuation of TAQ DNA polymerase was studied in. 25 Experimental set-up and procedure.-The experimental set-up utilized in this work is illustrated in Figure 5 . It is comprised of a NI-PXIe-1062 (National Instruments, USA) system, used to control the microfluidic actuations as well as the on-chip thermal control units (TCUs). An isothermal plate (TOKAIHIT, Japan) is utilized to create and maintain a 50 \u2022 C base temperature during all operations. Fluores-cent Microscope (Olympus BX-51) based optical set-up consists of: suitable excitation/emission filters, a high gain photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu, Japan), color CCD camera (QImaging, Canada) and a high speed CMOS camera (Canadian Photonics Lab, Canada). The photomultiplier tube (PMT) is operated at a fixed, high gain (\u00d710 6 ) for quantification of the fluorescence signal during chip based qRT-PCR assays. The DMF chip was secured on a printed circuit board (PCB), attached to an isothermal plate and mounted onto a motorized XY microscope stage for imaging and data acquisition. The electroactuation of bio-fluids was accomplished using a waveform generator (TTi, USA) and a precision power amplifier (Fluke, USA) whereas, the TCUs were powered by a dual channel DC power supply (Power Designs Inc., USA). Figure 5 also shows the microchip-PCB assembly on the isothermal plate. In order to minimize evaporation of the PCR sample during the thermal cycling process, the microfluidic chip was immersed in PCR-grade mineral oil (Biomerieux, Canada), encapsulated within a Plexiglas fixture and an ITO coated glass cover, maintained at 50 \u2022 C during the qRT-PCR reactions. The presence of ITO coated heated top plate, to seal the mineral oil bath, resulted in reducing the evaporative and diffusion based sample volume loss to less than 10% of the reaction volume. The two integrated micro-electrode architectures used for the chip based qRT-PCR reactions are illustrated in Figure 6 . The microfluidic component in each structure consists of three sections: 1) dispensing and mixing section where the RNA sample droplet and PCR reagent droplet is mixed; 2) transport section which is maintained at 50 \u2022 C for the RT-reaction and subsequently transports the PCR droplet onto the thermal cycler section; 3) the on-chip PCR thermal cycler design which has two TCUs (maintained respectively at 65 \u2022 C and 95 \u2022 C) and a D-DEP electrode scheme to circulate the droplet between the two TCUs during the course of the qRT-PCR reaction. Micro-electrode 1 solely relies on D-DEP actuation for sample/reagent dispensing to thermo-cycling, with two metalized layers (Al) of herring-bone shaped D-DEP electrodes, separated by \u223c300 nm of Si 3 N 4 (see Figure 6a ). Micro-electrode 2 consists of single surface EW electrode array (Au/Cr) for dispensing, PCR sample/reagent mixing (electrode gap: 100 \u03bcm) and a linear, bidirectional D-DEP electrode scheme (Al) for PCR thermal cycling (Figure 6b ). Electrode pitch, gap and width for the mixing (pitch: 250 \u03bcm; gap: 50 \u03bcm) and transport (pitch: 300 \u03bcm; gap: 60 \u03bcm) micro-electrodes were optimized for 5\u03bcL and 10 \u03bcL droplet volumes respectively. Average droplet actuation speeds during the chip based qRT-PCR assays were found to be \u223c3 mm/sec.",

A logarithmic plot of the qRT-PCR curve yields a better observation of the very distinct reaction kinetics during the amplification process. Ct (threshold cycle) is defined as the intersection between an amplification curve and a threshold line, placed in the qRT-PCR curves above the signal noise floor. It can be shown to be related to the initial target concentration, in the PCR reaction. The equation below describe the exponential amplification of PCR: [4] Where, N i = initial copy number; N n = copy number at cycle n; n = number of cycles and E = efficiency of target amplification, with theoretical values between 0 and 1. When the reaction efficiency is a maximum (E = 1), the equation reduces to: N n = N i (2 n ) and the target DNA copy count increase by 2-fold at each cycle. The quantity of PCR product generated at each cycle decreases with decreasing efficiency, and the amplification plot is delayed.

The 50% sensitivity of detection at the lowest RNA concentration in sample A-4 could be a result of off-chip sample preparation. Efficiency of the qRT-PCR amplification, for each of the four influenza A sample was found to be \u223c 94.4%.",

            "text": "Chip based qRT-PCR with reduced PCR droplet volumes.-The qRT-PCR experiments reported thus far have all used 10 \u03bcL volume PCR droplets to achieve a droplet transport based qRT-PCR reaction. The PCR volume was maintained constant in order to compare micro-device performance with the conventional, off-chip PCR setup which requires a minimum of 10 \u03bcL PCR reaction volume. At this stage of proof-of-concept, it was important to match the sample preparation protocols of the conventional set-up to suitably compare the micro-device performance. However, since one of the promising advantages of leveraging micro-devices for bio-diagnostics is to substantially reduce the required bio-sample/reagent volumes; we investigated on-chip qRT-PCR reactions in PCR droplet volumes of: 1 \u03bcL, 2.5 \u03bcL, 5 \u03bcL, 7.5 \u03bcL and 10 \u03bcL. Results of this different volume qRT-PCR experiment are reported in Figure 12 . The different volume PCR droplets were all pipetted from a 40 \u03bcL PCR reaction mix (20 \u03bcL influenza C RNA sample + 20 \u03bcL PCR Master Mix). The 7.5 \u03bcL and 10 \u03bcL PCR droplets were successfully actuated over micro-electrodes 1 and 2 respectively to achieve transport based PCR reaction. However, due to the fact that the two micro-electrode structures were tailored for PCR volumes close to 10 \u03bcL, PCR droplets <5 \u03bcL were subjected to a static PCR thermal cycling, where they were positioned in one of the two TCUs and the thermal zone was cycled between the two temperature limits of 60 \u2022 C and 95 \u2022 C. Cycle time for static qRT-PCR was observed to be 2.5 times larger than that of transport based PCR assay. As a result of the slower ramp rates, the PCR droplet is exposed in the high temperature region (between 80 \u2022 C -95 \u2022 C) for a larger amount of time, per cycle during the entire qRT-PCR reaction. This coupled with the smaller droplet volumes, resulted in change in the PCR efficiency for the smaller 2.5 \u03bcL PCR droplet (see Figure 12 ). Furthermore, the 1 \u03bcL PCR droplet did not show any amplification and suffered from significant volume loss (\u223c25% of sample volume was lost during the first 10 cycles). The PCR efficiency for the 7.5 \u03bcL and 10 \u03bcL PCR droplets was close to \u223c95%; whereas the efficiencies of the 5 \u03bcL and 2.5 \u03bcL PCR were found to be \u223c90% and 78% respectively. The calculated PCR efficiency values indicate that the transport based chip qRT-PCR is superior to the static PCR method. The poor performance of PCR in the smaller reaction volumes can henceforth be attributed to the fact that the current experimental set-up and the micro-electrode structures were tailored to handle larger PCR droplets (close to 10 \u03bcL); however, this exercise does demonstrate the possibility of reducing the PCR reaction volumes to microliter or sub-microliter PCR droplets. Although from the view-point of clinical pathogen detection, the possible reduction of PCR droplet volumes is not a significant improvement since the point of emphasis for such applications is to lower the detection threshold which may often require sampling larger sample volumes for the qRT-PCR detection assays.",

It illustrates micro-electrode designs which offer integration of micro-heater/RTD sensor based TCUs, with DEP/EW based miniaturized droplet handling technology, on a single substrate, for achieving the on-chip qRT-PCR assays. The on-chip TCUs were simulated using COMSOL v4.2 and calibrated using Rhodamine B dye. Results of the on-chip qRT-PCR amplification and real-time detection of influenza A and C viruses are furthermore analyzed to establish standard quantitative PCR curves, which help establish the satisfactory PCR efficiencies for the micro-device. Limit of detection (LOD) for the qRT-PCR micro-device, based on the targeted detection of influenza A and C viruses, is estimated to be \u223c5 copies per PCR reaction. The success of the micro-device, in carrying out different volume qRT-PCR reactions, suggests the potential for further reduction of the required PCR sample and reagent volumes. The current micro-electrode designs restrict the chip usability to one PCR per chip however; work is currently underway toward developing multiplexed qRT-PCR microdevices, which can simultaneously accommodate eight or more qRT-PCR reactions per chip. Such multiplexed qRT-PCR chips are better suited for clinical experimentation, where numerous repeated testing of known and unknown viral samples is required in order to provide robust pathogenic bio-diagnostics.",
