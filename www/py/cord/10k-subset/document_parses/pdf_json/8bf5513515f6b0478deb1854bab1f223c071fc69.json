            "text": "West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to the human epidemic-causing dengue, yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis viruses 1 . In establishing infection these icosahedral viruses undergo endosomal membrane fusion catalysed by envelope glycoprotein rearrangement of the putative receptor-binding domain III (DIII) and exposure of the hydrophobic fusion loop 2-4 . Humoral immunity has an essential protective function early in the course of West Nile virus infection 5,6 . Here, we investigate the mechanism of neutralization by the E16 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds DIII. Structurally, the E16 antibody Fab fragment engages 16 residues positioned on four loops of DIII, a consensus neutralizing epitope sequence conserved in West Nile virus and distinct in other flaviviruses. The E16 epitope protrudes from the surface of mature virions in three distinct environments 7 , and docking studies predict Fab binding will leave fivefold clustered epitopes exposed. We also show that E16 inhibits infection primarily at a step after viral attachment, potentially by blocking envelope glycoprotein conformational changes. Collectively, our results suggest that a vaccine strategy targeting the dominant DIII epitope may elicit safe and effective immune responses against flaviviral diseases.",

We also established that one of these monoclonal antibodies, E16, protects mice from lethal West Nile virus challenge even if administered therapeutically 5 days after infection. Here we have examined the structural basis for E16mediated neutralization by determining the crystal structure of the Fab fragment in complex with West Nile virus DIII at 2.5 \u00c5 resolution (Supplementary Table S1 ). Our structure reveals that DIII adopts an immunoglobulin-like b-sandwich topology similar to that found in other flavivirus envelope glycoproteins, whereas the E16 Fab adopts a typical quaternary assembly (Fig. 1a) .

E16 contacts DIII with 18 residues spread along all six of its CDR (complementarity determining region) loops in addition to three V H framework residues (Supplementary Table S2 ).

The E16 epitopes are unencumbered in either configuration, although intact E16 antibody is unlikely to bivalently recognize these isolated oligomers due to extensive distal splaying of the Fab tails (Fig. 3a, b) . DIII undergoes an ,708 rotation towards DII in the dimer to trimer transition 2,3 , and E16 ligation per se could serve to hinder this conformational change. Moreover, E16 binds part of the linker that connects DIII to DI, and the N terminus of our truncated West Nile virus DIII fragment adopts a unique conformation that enables Tyr 302 to make contact with the E16 V H domain (Fig. 3c) . In envelope glycoprotein trimers, the flavivirus invariant Tyr 302 interacts with DI in a manner that would be disrupted if re-oriented as observed in the E16-DIII LETTERS",

Thus, the coincident mapping of our and other neutralizing monoclonal antibodies suggests that the structural epitope has a dominant role in flavivirus neutralization.",

The E16 epitopes are unencumbered in either configuration, although intact E16 antibody is unlikely to bivalently recognize these isolated oligomers due to extensive distal splaying of the Fab tails ( Fig. 3a, b) . DIII undergoes an ,708 rotation towards DII in the dimer to trimer transition 2,3 , and E16 ligation per se could serve to hinder this conformational change. Moreover, E16 binds part of the linker that connects DIII to DI, and the N terminus of our truncated West Nile virus DIII fragment adopts a unique conformation that enables Tyr 302 to make contact with the E16 V H domain (Fig. 3c) . In envelope glycoprotein trimers, the flavivirus invariant Tyr 302 interacts with DI in a manner that would be disrupted if re-oriented as observed in the E16-DIII complex. Thus, E16 binding could stabilize the mature state or alternatively restrict transition to the post-fusion conformation.",

With three envelope glycoproteins in the asymmetric unit, there are three potential Fab-binding environments (Fig. 3d) . Two binding modes are clearly allowed: one that closely circles the three-fold axis and a second disposed symmetrically about the icosahedral dyad that is permuted as an outer five-fold ring (Fig. 3e, f) . However, the DIII epitopes are too tightly clustered at the true five-fold axis to permit E16 engagement without steric overlap with adjacent DIII residues. Thus, we postulate that at saturation no more than 120 Fabs can bind the 180 envelope glycoproteins in the mature virion, with exclusion of Fab binding to DIII around the inner five-fold ring (Fig. 3g) . Additional exclusions may occur for intact antibody, although we note that E16 Fab alone neutralizes West Nile virus. This incomplete saturation is analogous to that observed in the decoration of papillomavirus by a neutralizing antibody, which blocks infection through a post-attachment mechanism 17 . We next tested whether E16 could block cellular attachment of West Nile virus. Binding assays were performed with Vero cells, a cell line permissive for West Nile virus infection. After a 4 8C incubation with West Nile virus in the presence of control (anti-SARS ORF7a), non-neutralizing (E22), or neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that map within (E16 or E24) or outside (E53 or E60) of DIII, cellassociated viral RNA was measured by fluorogenic polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) 18 . Importantly, the non-binding and non-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies do not inhibit virus binding. In contrast, E53 and E60 block virus attachment by 8-9-fold (P , 0.001) whereas E16 and E24, which recognize the same dominant DIII epitope, only inhibit binding by 3.5-fold (P \u00bc 0.003) (Fig. 4a) . The observation that E53 and E60 block virus binding more efficiently than E16 was not expected, as E53 and E60 are tenfold less potent in plaque reduction neutralization assays 8 .",

Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection occurs when antibody-virus complexes are preferentially internalized through Fcg receptors on myeloid cells. Although the in vivo consequences remain uncertain, many monoclonal antibodies efficiently enhance flavivirus infection of Fcg-receptor-bearing cells even when inhibitory in fibroblast neutralization assays 21 . We tested whether saturating concentrations of non-neutralizing (E5) or neutralizing (E16, E24 or E60) monoclonal antibodies enhance West Nile virus infection in macrophages. We found that whereas E5 and E60 augment infection 270-and 3,000-fold, respectively, E16 potently inhibits macrophage infection at the same concentration. Notably, when E16 is combined with E5 or E60, it completely blocks enhancement as judged by reduction of virus yield (Fig. 4c ) or viral RNA (data not shown). E24, which maps to the E16 dominant epitope, also blocks E5-and E60-dependent enhancement. Finally, the blockade of enhancement is not due to epitope competition as E16 and E24 do not cross-compete E5 or E60 for West Nile virus envelope glycoprotein binding (Fig. 4d and data not shown) . Collectively, these virological experiments strongly suggest that E16 blocks West Nile virus infection primarily after cellular attachment.",

Consistent with this, E16 inhibits West Nile virus infection primarily at a step after virus attachment. Moreover, our data suggest a potential advantage for interfering with post-attachment events, an emerging theme in other viral inhibition studies [22] [23] [24] [25] .
