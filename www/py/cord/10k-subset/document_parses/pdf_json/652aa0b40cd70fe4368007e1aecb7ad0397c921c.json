The main Italian infectious disease clinics were invited to fill in a questionnaire that regarded the number and type of hospital admissions, the country of origin, and demographic features (age, sex, and resident state) of immigrants. A total of 46 clinics including 2255 patients participated in the study. Most patients were men (63%) with an age between 16 and 40 years (63.4%) covered by the National Health Service (71%) and coming from Africa (44.3%). The main infectious diseases observed were: 378 (16.76%) cases of HIV infection, 303 (13.43%) cases of tuberculosis diseases, 282 (12.5%) cases of various forms of viral hepatitis, 177 (7.84%) cases of respiratory diseases, and 196 (8.69%) gastrointestinal diseases. Tropical diseases found were 134 (5.94%) including 95 cases of malaria (70.9%). In conclusion, a broad range of diseases was noted in immigrants which were directly correlated with conditions of poverty. Only a few tropical diseases were diagnosed and therefore the immigrant should not be considered as an infectious disease carrier.",

In fact, there was a higher rate of hospitalizations in Northern areas (up to 13%) versus 6.5% in the Central regions and less than 3% in Southern zones. These data reflect a disparity of immigrant distribution in Italy and indicate that Southern Italy is only an arrival point leading to a definite location in the Northern regions (according to the Caritas reports in 2002) (1). An another important result regards the resident status of all patients either clandestine or legal residents. Only 30% of all hospitalized immigrants were clandestine persons compared to those with a legal resident status, that is, national health services are frequented more often by regular citizens even though, legally, facilities are available to the entire immigrant population.",

The national health service for immigrants is actually ineffective in some cases (1, 4) and should be improved in order to avoid unnecessary hospitalizations.",
