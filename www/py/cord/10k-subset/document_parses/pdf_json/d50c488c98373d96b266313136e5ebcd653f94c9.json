The demand for the resource, i.e. the amount of an action which enables the resource to be obtained, at each of several prices can be measured experimentally. This is best done in studies where the income available, in the form of time or energy, is controlled in relation to the price paid for the resource. When demand is plotted against price, a demand curve is produced. In some studies, the slope of this demand curve has been measured to indicate price elasticity of demand but in recent studies (Kirkden et al., 2003) it has become clear that the area under the demand curve up to a particular point, the consumer surplus, is the best measure of strength of preference.

Nowadays most veal calves are fed milk replacers that contains a variable proportion of milk powder and which iron content is maintained at a low level. This results in relatively low blood haemoglobin levels. An average blood haemoglobin level at slaughter between 4.5 and 5.0 mmol/l is compatible with an acceptable meat colour. As haemoglobin levels increase, the number of animals whose meat is darker in colour increases. In order to prevent calves from having haemoglobin levels that are too low, early in the production phase, the iron supply in the milk replacer fed during the first 7-8 weeks of the fattening period (starter) is usually about 50 ppm, whereas iron supply in the milk replacer fed during the remainder of the fattening period (fattener) is 10 ppm. Moreover, blood haemoglobin levels are generally monitored, most intensively upon arrival at the fattening unit, and calves with levels below age-dependent thresholds are treated with iron, either individually or group-wise. Thus, blood haemoglobin levels usually gradually decline across the fattening period, and the lowest average levels are supposed to be reached during the last four weeks prior to slaughter.

A third group of potentially hazardous effluents are drug residues, such as antibiotics, which may be present in the excreta of farm animals after medical treatment and which are passed to the environment during grazing or spreading of animal manure where they may conceivably contribute to the formation of antibiotic resistance in certain strains of bacteria.

Aerial pollutants can give cause for concern for several reasons. E.g. an animal's respiratory health may be compromised by these pollutants. In fattening units, up to 100 % of all calves may show signs of pneumonia, pleuritis or other respiratory disease within the first three weeks of housing when the calves come together from different herds (see chapter on temperature, ventilation and air hygiene). The travel distance of viable bacteria from animal houses via the air is presently estimated at 250 m (M\u00fcller and Wieser, 1987) downwind why there is a possible transmission between animal houses. Very little is known about the distribution characteristics of dust particles, endotoxins, fungi and their spores, in the air surrounding animal houses. Recent investigations showed dispersion of staphylococcae sp. (bioaerosols) up to 500 m (Schulz et al., 2004 ) from a broiler barn. The contribution of calf production is presently unknown. It is estimated that calves produce about 5.3 kg fresh manure and 7.5 kg slurry per animal and day.

Alternatively, it has been suggested that hunger may also control the level of non-nutritive sucking and possibly cross-sucking (Jensen, 2003) . This idea is consistent with the observations that the duration of unrewarded visits to an automatic feeding station increased during gradual weaning (Jensen and Holm, 2003) , and that under practical farm conditions the frequency of cross-sucking among dairy calves around weaning is increased with decreasing availability or energy density of solid feeds (Keil et al., 2000; Keil and Langhans, 2001) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 333, "end": 351, "text": "(De Passill\u00e9, 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 494, "end": 517, "text": "(Jung and Lidfors, 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF180"}, {"start": 565, "end": 588, "text": "(Jensen and Holm, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}, {"start": 690, "end": 710, "text": "(Haley et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF160"}, {"start": 772, "end": 796, "text": "(Jung and Lidfors, 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF180"}, {"start": 797, "end": 819, "text": "Jensen and Holm, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}, {"start": 950, "end": 964, "text": "(Jensen, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF172"}, {"start": 1117, "end": 1140, "text": "(Jensen and Holm, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}, {"start": 1324, "end": 1343, "text": "(Keil et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}, {"start": 1344, "end": 1368, "text": "Keil and Langhans, 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Airborne effluents"}, {"text": "In contrast to other calves, white veal calves are not weaned, receive large amounts of milk replacer and usually obtain only restricted amounts of solid food.

This explanation may also fit the observations that veal calves fed either hay or a combination of concentrates and straw exhibited similar incidences of abomasal ulcers to those fed milk replacer only (Chain Management of Veal Calf Welfare, 2000; Veissier et al., 1998) .

Over time, formulations of commercially available milk replacers for veal calves (as well as those for dairy calves) have become more and more sophisticated. At the same time, economic pressures continuously prompt the industry to reduce feeding costs and to consider alternative components and raw materials. Originally, proteins in milk replacers were milk-based, and skim milk powder constituted the major protein source. Subsequently, milk replacers based on whey powder became available. Approximately during the last two decades, attempts have been made to replace animal-based proteins in milk replacers by vegetable proteins, mainly from soybean and wheat and, to a lesser extent, pea and potato. Initially, some of these attempts met with little success because of health problems in the calves. For example, compared to calves fed diets based on skim milk powder, calves fed milk replacers containing heated soybean flour developed severe immunemediated gut hypersensitivity reactions characterized by partial atrophy of the small intestinal villi, malabsorption, diarrhoea, and large infiltrations of the small intestine by immune cells, accompanied by the presence of high antibody titres against soy antigens in plasma and intestinal mucous secretions (Lalles et al., 1995a (Lalles et al., , 1995b (Lalles et al., , 1996 (Lalles et al., , 1998 Dreau et al., 1995; Dreau and Lalles, 1999) .

At present a number of processed plant proteins are successfully applied in combination with milkbased protein sources in milk replacers for (veal) calves, including hydrolysed soy protein isolate and hydrolysed wheat gluten. Recent research in the area of plant proteins in milk replacer formulas is focussed on understanding mechanisms underlying the flow of proteins in duodenal digesta, and the interaction of dietary peptides with the gut, in particular at the level of the mucus layer (Montagne et al., 2001 (Montagne et al., , 2003 (Montagne et al., , 2004 .

Recent findings regarding importance of floor and bedding materials Slatted floors have been used for many years as convenient for intensive housing for beef cattle but concerns have been expressed about their effects on animal welfare (SCAHAW, 2001) . The type of surface not only affects the movements of getting up and lying down, lying and resting behaviour of the fattening animals but also other behavioural traits and physiological indicators of stress (SCAHAW, 2001) . Moreover when cattle can choose between different floor types they prefer deep litter to slatted floor especially for resting. Many studies were conducted in order to analyse the floor comfort in the lying area in dairy and in beef cattle (for a list of references see Tuyttens, 2005; SCAHAW, 2001) . The group pens for veal calves do not have separate lying areas and therefore the animals spend all their time on the same surface. If the floor is too hard for lying or too slippery, discomfort, distress and injury may result. A suitable floor is very important for calves as adequate rest is essential for the good welfare of young growing animals, moreover a positive correlation between the amount of rest and growth rates has been observed for growing cattle (Mogensen et al., 1997; Hanninen et al., 2005) . Adequate resting is important both for sleep and temperature regulation. Veal calves are often housed on slatted floors, commonly made of hardwood, a product that is controversial because it often comes from unsustainable forestry in tropical countries (Stefanowska et al., 2002) , or on concrete floors due to the fact that bedding material is costly and requires more labour and can cause problems in manure handling systems. Wooden slatted floors can absorb liquid from manure and a wet surface is not comfortable for moving and lying (Verga et al., 1985) . Even if straw bedding provides better floor comfort to animals than slatted or concrete floors, suitable alternatives to reduce or eliminate the use of straw bedding are available for cattle (Tuyttens, 2005) . Recent studies have investigated the effect of the texture (how soft) and the thermal properties of floor on lying postures and resting behaviour of calves. In cool or drafty floors calves spent less time resting on the side and rest curled up in order to conserve heat (Hanninen et al., 2003) . In contrast with adult dairy cows which rested longer and lay down more frequently on softer floors, there was no effect of type of floor (concrete floor or rubber mats) on resting behaviour of dairy calves (Hanninen et al., 2005) . In another experiment where veal calves could choose to use a hardwood slatted floor surface or a synthetic rubber coated floor surface the calves preferred the wooden floor for lying (Stefanowska et al., 2002) . Moreover the animals rested in the drier part of the pen (Stefanowska et al., 2002) . From these studies it seems that the texture of the floor is not as important to calves as to older animals, whereas thermal comfort seems to affect lying and lying postures. Panivivat et al. (2004) investigated growth performance and health of 60 dairy calves bedded with five different types of materials (granite fines, sand, rice hulls, long wheat straw, wood shavings) for 42 days during August to October from birth. Overall average daily gain and dry matter intake of calves did not differ with bedding type, although during week 2, calves housed on rice hulls had the greatest dry matter intake and those housed on wood shavings had the lowest. During week 2, calves housed on granite fines and sand were treated more often for scours, and calves housed on long wheat straw received the fewest antibiotic treatments (week by bedding material interaction). Granite fines formed a harder surface than other bedding, and calves housed on granite fines scored the dirtiest. Long wheat straw had the warmest surface temperature, and rice hulls and wood shavings were warmer than granite fines and sand. Serum cortisol, alpha (1)-acid glycoprotein, immunoglobulin G concentrations, and the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio were not affected by bedding type. On day 0, coliform counts were greatest in rice hulls. After use, coliform counts were greatest in long wheat straw (week by bedding material interaction). Growth rates of calves bedded for 42 d with 5 bedding types did not differ; however, the number of antibiotic treatments given for scours was greatest on granite fines and sand; coliform counts in the bedding were highest in rice hulls before use and in long wheat straw after 42 days of use.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 243, "end": 257, "text": "(SCAHAW, 2001)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 467, "end": 481, "text": "(SCAHAW, 2001)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 753, "end": 768, "text": "Tuyttens, 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF346"}, {"start": 769, "end": 782, "text": "SCAHAW, 2001)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1249, "end": 1272, "text": "(Mogensen et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF247"}, {"start": 1273, "end": 1295, "text": "Hanninen et al., 2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1551, "end": 1577, "text": "(Stefanowska et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF317"}, {"start": 1836, "end": 1856, "text": "(Verga et al., 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF364"}, {"start": 2050, "end": 2066, "text": "(Tuyttens, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF346"}, {"start": 2339, "end": 2362, "text": "(Hanninen et al., 2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2572, "end": 2595, "text": "(Hanninen et al., 2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2782, "end": 2808, "text": "(Stefanowska et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF317"}, {"start": 2868, "end": 2894, "text": "(Stefanowska et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF317"}, {"start": 3072, "end": 3095, "text": "Panivivat et al.

Bioaerosols (micro-organisms, dust), low air temperatures together with high air humidity, gases such as ammonia, draught, insufficient air space and poor ventilation form a complex environmental situation which can be detrimental particularly for the respiratory health of young calves (Lundborg et al. 2005; SVC, 1995) . 9.6.1. Temperature and relative humidity A healthy calf consuming a sufficient amount of feed has a wide zone of thermal neutrality. There is no difference in the performance of healthy, normal eating calves at temperatures ranging between 0 \u00baC and 20 \u00baC provided it is dry and not exposed to draughts. Above 25 \u00baC conditions in confined calf houses can start to become uncomfortable. Moran (2002) suggests that the ideal temperature and relative humidity for calves are 17 \u00baC and 65 %, respectively. However, there is a large number of influencing factors to consider which can alter the situation for a calf substantially. Lower critical temperatures for a calf in calm air and full feed are different whether it stands (-3 \u00baC) or is lying on dry concrete (-6 \u00baC) or on dry straw (-8 \u00baC) (Thickett et al. 1990 ). The younger the animal the higher is its demand for the thermal environment. By 1 week of age, the lower critical temperature in still air is approximately 8 \u00baC (Webster, 1984) . This temperature can be significantly changed by draught, wet coat and feeding level. Young calves start to shiver at 8 \u00baC when they are exposed to draught even if their coat is dry and they are fed sufficient feed. When fed on maintenance only level shivering starts at 12 \u00baC. If their coat is wet and they are exposed to draught shivering starts at 13 \u00baC when on full feed and 19 \u00baC when fed on a low level (Moran, 2002) . No signs of shivering are observed at 3 \u00baC when the coat is dry with no draught and feeding is at a normal level. Cold stress in calves can be prevented by providing dry lying areas, appropriate feeding and draught free ventilation. Dry bedding such as straw significantly improves thermal comfort for the lying calf. In summer situations reduced feeding (but with sufficient water supply!) or feeding calves in the cooler evening or at a reduced animal density per pen and increased ventilation rates can help to lower heat stress. Heat stress can also be reduced through constructing sheds with insulated roofs and well ventilated walls. Calf houses with a solid wall construction and a high capacity to store energy combined with an efficient ventilation system can also contribute to create comfortable environmental temperatures for young calves kept indoors all year (DIN 18910, 2004) .

However, these models lack an insight into biophysical and biochemical mechanisms of cell and virus death. As long as we do not understand these mechanisms, the measures to reduce the air pollutants are limited to either increased ventilation or increased air space. The smaller the air space per animal the more sophisticated the ventilation system must be. The influence of air space was demonstrated by Wathes (1994) showing that doubling of the air space in a calf barn from 6 to 12 m\u00b3 per calf had the same effect on the concentration of airborne bacteria as a six fold increase in ventilation rate (air exchange rate). An air space of 6 to 8 m\u00b3 per calf was recommended by Hilliger (1990) from experience. 9.6.2.

Significantly high amounts of endotoxins were found in calf house air while bacteria and dust are relatively low compared with pig and poultry houses and suggest that a high number of Gram-negative bacteria are present in the air. The average concentration of 64 ng/m\u00b3 endotoxin given in Table 9 .1 represents about 640 EU (endotoxin units) according to the new nomenclature. It seems rather high in comparison to a formerly proposed occupational threshold of 50 EU for humans at the work place (Rylander and Jacobs, 1997) . It can be assumed that high endotoxin concentrations in calf house air may substantially contribute together with the other bioaerosol compounds and the physical environment to the high level of respiratory disorders in young calves up to 105 days (Assie et al., 2004) . In general, there is little detailed knowledge on the specific composition of bioaerosols in calf keeping systems and which factors cause respiratory diseases. Assie et al. (2004) found e.g. a tendency to higher repiratory disorders in non-weaned calves reared in loose-housing yards compared with tied-cow stalls. The highest incidence rates of cases were observed between November and January, while daily meteorological conditions obviously did not influence incidence rates.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 170, "end": 183, "text": "(Wathes 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF373"}, {"start": 1040, "end": 1067, "text": "(Rylander and Jacobs, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF292"}, {"start": 1318, "end": 1338, "text": "(Assie et al., 2004)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1501, "end": 1520, "text": "Assie et al.

(1994) showed the importance of good ventilation which removes dust and other respirable particles as well as noxious gases and is essential for calf health. Adequate ventilation is seen as vital to help to reduce the incidence of respiratory disease. Air inlets should be above calf height and the outlet at least 1.5 m above the inlet (Howard, 2003) . However, heating and ventilation in combination with an air filtration system significantly improved the environment in a calf house but did not completely eliminate pneumonia (Bantle et al., 1994) . This may have to do with other factors such as ambient temperature. In a recent study by Reinhold and Elmer (2002) some compromise in lung function (compared with controls) was seen in calves exposed to an ambient temperature of 5 \u00baC. 9.6.2.3.

Good ventilation systems provide this exchange. However, high air speeds close to the animals can lead to draughts and should be avoided. Draughts happen when part of an animal is hit by an air stream with a higher velocity than the ambient air movement and which has a substantially lower temperature than the surrounding air, causing a feeling of cold and physiological reaction in that particular part of the body. Draught can lead to poor welfare and disease when it continues and the animal cannot escape, e.g. when it is tethered. It is generally recommended that wind speeds around animals should be between 0.1 m/s in winter (least value) and about 0.6 m/s in summer. These values strongly depend on relative humidity and temperature of the air and whether the skin of the animals is dry or wet, full fleece or shorn. In confined buildings this complex relationship between the various factors is strongly influenced by the ventilation system and the ventilation rate which is necessary for the number of animals kept in the animal house. It seem useful to develop a more comprehensive model for the interaction of the different air quality compounds and the air exchange rate to improve our understanding of the welfare and health impacts arising from the air environment. 9.6.3. Ventilation Ventilation plays an essential role in improving air quality in calf barns. This applies to free ventilated and forced ventilated houses. Calculations of ventilation rates are usually based on heat removal in summer and moisture removal in winter, and give some guideline temperatures and humidities of the air which should not be exceeded (e.g. CIGR, 1994; DIN 18910, 2004) . Ventilation rates in calf barns can only be calculated satisfactorily for confined buildings. Minimum ventilation rates around 10 m\u00b3 per 100 kg live weight should be sufficient to keep the air quality within acceptable limits if the air distribution system ensures an even air exchange in all parts of the building. Such guidelines (CIGR) and Norms (DIN 18910, 2004) cannot guarantee healthy calves but they can substantially help in designing confined calf houses. It seems useful to standardise the air quality and ventilation requirements for confined calf houses in Europe in order to reduce respiratory disorders, suffering of the animals and economic losses.

A prospective study was carried out on 94 randomly selected beef herds in the Midi-Pyrenees region in France (Bendali et al., 1999) . The objective was to describe diarrhoea and mortality in beef calves from birth to 30 days of age. Calves (3,080) were followed from December 1995 to April 1996, and a total of 700 visits allowed records of herd management practices, individual data and environmental conditions to be collected. The incidence rate for diarrhoea during the neonatal period was 14.6%, and varied markedly between herds. Eighteen herds did not suffer from diarrhoea, while five herds had an incidence of more than 50%. Results indicate that 52% of diarrhoea appears during the first week and only 15% after the second week of life. The greatest risk of diarrhoea for a calf was during the first and second weeks of life (7.9 and 6.5 times, respectively). The month of birth was also significantly associated with morbility, the highest incidence was observed in December and March (17.6% and 23.6%, respectively) .

In a study of 122 dairy herds in south-west Sweden, Svensson et al. (2003) clinically monitored the health of 3081 heifer calves from birth until 90 days of age. 23% of the calves developed one or more diseases during this period. Most of the 317 diarrhoea cases were mild (68%) whereas of the 221 cases of respiratory disease 43% were severe. The total morbidity was 0.081 cases per calf-month at risk and the incidence rates of arthritis, diarrhoea, omphalophlebitis, respiratory disease and ringworm were 0.002, 0.035, 0.005, 0.025 and 0.009 cases per calf-month at risk respectively. Odds ratios were calculated for severe diarrhoea in calves born in the summer (OR: 1.7) and receiving colostrums through suckling instead of a bucket or nipple (OR: 1.8). It has been shown that calves left with their mothers have a delayed/longer time to ingest colostrum and often fail to ingest adequate volumes (Rajala and Castr\u00e9n, 1995) . Svensson and Liberg (2006) found that the health status of the mother cow 280-50 days before calving, length of dry period, retained placenta and somatic cell count were predisposing risk factors for respiratory disease in the calf. Svensson et al. (2003) were also able to demonstrate that the odds ratios for respiratory disease and increased respiratory sounds were increased in calves housed in large group pens with an automatic milk-feeding system (OR: 2.2 and 2.8). Similar results have been reported by Maatje et al. (1993) and Plath (1999) . There was a decreased odds ratio for respiratory disease if calving was supervised (OR: 0.7) . If birth was taking place in individual maternity pens or in tie stalls instead of in cubicle or group maternity pen, the odds ratio for increased respiratory sounds was 0.5 or 0.6 respectively. 30% of the diarrhoea cases were treated with antibiotics whereas 47% of the respiratory cases were treated using antibiotics. In another study of nine farms, Svensson and Liberg (2006) found that in pens for six to nine calves there was a significantly reduced risk of clinical respiratory tract disease (OR: 0.69-0.72) compared with pens with 12-18 calves and there was also an association with the age at transfer to the group pen. The risk of diarrhoea was not affected by housing the calves in differently sized groups. However, calves housed in large sized groups grew significantly less quickly (approximately 40 g/day) than calves housed in groups of six to nine. Serological responses to respiratory viruses (e.g. bovine respiratory syncytical virus, parainfluenza virus, corona virus and viral diarrhoea virus) showing that animals within a herd are usually either all seropositive or all seronegative, indicate that infections spread to all calves in the herd when introduced or activated (H\u00e4gglund et al., in press) and hence that aerosol is an important means for the spread of viruses. However, an infected animal is not equivalent to a diseased animal. It has been shown that calves housed in adjacent pens can maintain quite different levels of disease. Svensson and Liberg (2006) reported that calves in a group of 16 had a significantly higher incidence of clinical respiratory disease that calves in an adjacent pen kept in groups of 8. Engelbrecht (2005) reported calves transferred to group pens in a batchwise manner had significantly higher prevalence of diarrhoea and respiratory disease than calves in adjacent pens that were transferred to and from the group pen continuously. In both studies calves had no direct contact with calves in adjacent pens. These results indicate an important role of direct contact for the transmission of respiratory disease and hence the importance in disease control of decreasing direct contact between calves within the same building by means of solid walls. Svensson and Liberg (2006) also reported that the age at transfer from single pens to group pens was associated with the risk of respiratory disease, indicating that delaying transfer to after two weeks of age might be preferable for health reasons.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 235, "end": 257, "text": "Svensson et al.

The hazards were characterized in relation to the impact they have on the animal. The exposure to the hazard might vary between different rearing systems. For this purpose a set of different rearing categories was developed (Table 12 .1) as well as scoring categories for the hazard characterisation, exposure assessment and risk evaluation (Table 12 .4).

Criteria for invitation were the following; predominantly engaged in clinical practice; extensive clinical experience in calf medicine; and covering various geographical areas where calf production is significant in the EU. Another important criterion was that the consultant should not be affiliated with the calf production industry. In total 7 veterinarians accepted an invitation to assist in the exposure assessment. The experience of the individuals covered the various husbandry systems and important veal producing countries in Europe. The consultation group prompted that for the exposure assessment, a quintile distribution (i.e. five classes of 20% increments) of exposure classes be adopted. In some instances the estimates of the WG and the Consultation Group on exposure did not agree in which case the opinion of the Consultation Group was interpreted to represent the factual situation. In other instances the exposure could not be estimated due to lack of data, in which cases the risks were labelled \"uncertain\".
