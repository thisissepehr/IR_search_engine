In this study we analyzed the complete genome sequences of 122 SFTSV strains to determine the phylogeny, evolution and reassortment of the virus. We revealed that the evolutionary rate of three genome segments were different, with highest in the S segment and lowest in the L segment. The SFTSV strains were phylogenetically classified into 5 lineages (A, B, C, D and E) with each genome segment. SFTSV strains from China were classified in all 5 lineages, strains from South Korea were classified into 3 lineages (A, D, and E), and all strains from Japan were classified in only linage E. Using the average evolutionary rate of the three genome segments, we found that the extant SFTSV originated 20-87 years ago in the Dabie Mountain area in central China. The viruses were then transmitted to other areas of China, Japan and South Korea. We also found that six SFTSV strains were reassortants. Selection pressure analysis suggested that SFTSV was under purifying selection according to the four genes (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, glycoprotein, nucleocapsid protein, non-structural protein), and two sites (37, 1033) of glycoproteins were identified as being under strong positive selection.

Our analysis estimated that the evolutionary rate of three segments was different, with 4.16E-4 s/s/y (95%HPD = 8.99E-5 to 9.72E-4 s/s/y) in L segment, 6.76E-4 s/s/y (95%HPD = 3.92E-4 to 1.00E-3 s/s/y) in M segment and 1.09E-3 s/s/y (95%HPD = 5.43E-4 to 1.60E-3 s/s/y) in S segment, which was similar to that predicted for SFTSV in previous studies and other phleboviruses (E-4 s/s/y) [23, 32, 34] . The mean evolutionary rate of the concatenated sequences was estimated to be 6.73E-4 s/s/y (95%HPD = 2.35E-4 to 1.09E-3 s/s/y). Generally speaking, the M segment should have the highest evolutionary rate in bunyaviruses, as it encoded the two glycoproteins which play a role in interaction with receptors in the cell surface. However, higher substitution rates were observed in the S segment because of the variability seen at the nucleotide level, in the highly variable region of the NSs gene sequence for SFTSV.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 442, "end": 446, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 834, "end": 838, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 839, "end": 842, "text": "32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 843, "end": 846, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Temporal and spatial dynamics of RNA viruses are often reflected by their phylogenetic structure [46] . The inference of divergence events presented facilitated a better understanding of historical divergence and offered further opportunities to study viral demographic history and dispersal events [27] . Maximum clade credibility phylogenetic tree supported the TMRCA for all sampled SFTSV strains were found to be 42 (95% HPD = 20 to 87) years ago, and lineage E isolates were predicted to have diverged at the latest time. SFTSV existed earlier than its first description in central China and later in Japan and South Korea. The primary reason was that SFTSV was unknown, and lacked the corresponding detective methods and tools for the new virus. Secondly, changes in the working environment increased contact between the vectors and farmers. Lastly, virulence of the virus increased because of mutations and reassortment events. Our analysis indicated that central China was the geographic origin of the most recent common ancestor of SFTSV because of having the highest viral diversity in the area and viral strains distributing in four lineages sans lineage E. Furthermore, another aspect was the TMRCA from the MCC phylogenetic tree. In conclusion, these findings suggest that SFTSV originated in central China, which then spread to eastern China, northeastern China, and from Zhejiang Province in eastern China it spread to Japan and South Korea. Based on the genotype distribution of SFTSV and Bayesian analysis, Fu et al demonstrated that SFTSV strains in Zhoushan Islands were from central China and South Korea, and the virus in Japan were from South Korea [25] . In Fu's and our analysis, SFTSV strains in South Korea were classified into three lineages or genotypes. Within the three lineages, one included SFTSV strains only from Zhoushan Islands, South Korea, and Japan, while the other two included the virus from central and northeastern China, and South Korea. Thus, we inferred that SFTSV strains in the mainland of South Korea were transmitted from Liaoning, Shandong or Jiangsu province in China, while SFTSV strains in Jeju Island of South Korea were from Zhoushan Archipelago of Zhejiang Province of China. SFTSV in Japan were transmitted from Zhoushan Archipelago of Zhejiang Province of China or from Jeju Island of South Korea. However, while these predictions are suggestive of a potential origin for SFTSV, cautions must be exercised in their interpretation because limited SFTSV strains from limited areas were used in the analysis. In our study, only 8 strains from Japan and 6 from South Korea were used, which could affect the lineage classification of the phylogenetic analysis and the judgment of the virus origin and transmission routes. To obtain more accurate data of SFTSV lineage classification, origin and transmission routes, analysis should contain more complete genome sequences from South Korea and Japan. Although ticks were considered as a vector of SFTSV, ticks could not fly and with limited activity areas of the mammals, there must be a host to carry ticks from area to area efficiently. We inferred that the host should be migratory birds, but we had no evidence.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 97, "end": 101, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 299, "end": 303, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1671, "end": 1675, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "SFTSV glycoproteins exhibited the highest dN/dS ratio among the four genes. Theoretically, this might reflect the high antigenicity, which could be under selective pressure to evade the host humoral immune response as well as to adapt to their respective cell-surface receptors for attachment and entry [47] . Although we found two sites in the SFTSV glycoprotein under positive selection, we did not know if a mutation in the two sites could affect the virulence of the virus. Thus further research should be performed based on reverse genetics to identify the relationship between mutation of the sites and the virulence. The NS protein had the highest dN/dS ratio. We found that there were up to 5.2% diversity among all the amino acids of sampled NS genes. The NS protein is thought to affect virulence, primarily through its antagonism of interferon, helping the virus to evade host antiviral responses [18, 19] .
