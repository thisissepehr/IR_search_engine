A brief, sharp peak of admission follower respiratory tract diseases occurred \"unseasonally\" in August 1968, and was not associated with infections with viruses included in this study. Although we have no specific etiologic explanation for this peak, the data indicate that other infectious agents are etiologically related to these diseases. DISCUSSION This continuing surveillance study of virus infections in infants and young children with acute lower respiratory tract disease describes the cyclical pattern of occurrence of RSV infections. From the winter of 1966-1967 until April 1970 in Chicago, RSV epidemics occurred on a regular cycle with a periodicity of about 58 weeks. This cycle interval placed succeeding epidemics slightly later each year. Following the Spring epidemic in April 1970, the interval between this peak and the next was only 39 weeks, reorientating the epidemics to the colder months. Thus it appears that a four-year cycle of respiratory syncytial virus epidemics occurred with about three equal long cycles and one short one. Whether this four-year pattern was coinci-dental or will repeat during the next four years remains to be investigated. The most recent epidemic of RSV, however, occurred in March 1972 or at a relatively later time compared to the 1968 epidemic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 516, "end": 531, "text": "January 1, 1967", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 532, "end": 552, "text": "to December SI, 1971", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 558, "end": 602, "text": "1966-1967 1967-196S 1969 1970 1970-1971 1972", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1102, "end": 1112, "text": "DISCUSSION", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Population."}, {"text": "Data on the timing of RSV epidemics from other populations located in different large cities agree with our findings (6, 9, 10) .

As the susceptible pool of infants enlarges it is probable that a critical size is reached which encourages effective spread of the virus, and an epidemic is initiated. However, the short cycle epidemic of 1970-1971 is evidence against the hypothesis that the accumulation of a sufficient pool of susceptibles requires more than one year for an RSV epidemic to develop, unless the previous epidemic failed to exhaust the susceptible pool or new susceptibles entered the community at a higher rate.
