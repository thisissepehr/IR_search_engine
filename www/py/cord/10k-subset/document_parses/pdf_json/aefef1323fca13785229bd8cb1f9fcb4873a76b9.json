Recent models of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) have often made assumptions about how the disease spreads, such as uniform transmissibility and homogeneous mixing within a population. In this paper, we test whether these assumptions are necessarily correct, and offer simple solutions that may improve disease model accuracy. First, we use data and models of West African migration to show that EVD does not homogeneously mix, but spreads in a predictable manner. Next, we estimate the initial growth rate of EVD within country administrative divisions and find that it significantly decreases with population density. Finally, we test whether EVD strains have uniform transmissibility through a novel statistical test, and find that certain strains appear more often than expected by chance.",

Next, we model the cumulative number of individuals infected in administrative divisions at the first or second level in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to estimate the initial growth rate of EVD. We find this growth rate varies significantly, and appears to decrease with the population density within the administrative division.

A high Pearson correlation (0.96, p < 10 \u22123 ), and agreement with the normality assumption (p > 0.05, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test), also suggests a linear relationship between the arrival time and effective distance. Taking the slope of the plot gives us an effective velocity of spread, which we find to be 0.015 days \u22121 , which is much slower than for previous diseases (\u22480.1 days \u22121 ) 8 .

Despite the lower quality data, however, we can still use it to determine the most likely origin of EVD, which we compare to the known origin, Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou, Guinea. Quickly finding where a disease originated is important to help understand what caused it (e.g., what was the vector), and to predict where and when it will arrive, which can allow health workers to prepare 8 . Previously, it was found that the correlation between the arrival time and the effective distances from the disease origin is higher than correlations from areas where the disease did not originate 8 . We therefore ranked the correlation between the arrival times and effective distances from all the administrative divisions where Ebola was found between 2013 and 2016 ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S2 ), and found the true origin has the highest correlation. To determine the statistical significance of the ranking, we bootstrapped residuals of the linear regression between D eff and T a , with Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou as the origin, to accurately Figure 1 . The arrival time, T a , of EVD in a country versus (a) the great-arc length distance, D g and (b) the migration-based effective distance, D eff from the disease's point of origin (Guinea). Error is smaller than marker size. The migration network used to construct the effective distance comes from census microdata 13 . The linear relationship between arrival time and effective distance suggests that there is a constant effective velocity of disease spread, in agreement with previous work on other diseases 8 .",

In this section, we show that the cumulative number of Ebola cases within administrative divisions at the first or second level is well-approximated by a logistic function (Fig. 4a) . We use this finding to estimate the initial growth rate of EVD for each infected administrative division, where, to our surprise, we find that the initial growth rate decreases with population density. We emphasize that variations in EVD growth rates have been seen before 9,10 , but mechanisms that might drive this behavior were not proposed. The logistic function has been used to model initial stages of EVD 14 , and is equivalent to the Susceptible-Infectious (SI) model when 100% of individuals are initially susceptible 15 . To fit the SI model to our data, however, we would have to make a simplistic assumption that only a fraction p n of individuals are susceptible, in order to explain why a small fraction of the population is ever infected. We do not claim this describes the actual dynamics of EVD, although we will explain later why the cumulative number of cases should approximately follow this distribution. For an administrative division n, the cumulative number of infected individuals over time, t, by the logistic growth function is simply:",

Because small variations in q n very quickly become substantial variations in the infection size later on, we want to understand how q n varies across administrative divisions. When plotting q n versus population density ( Fig. 5 ) with more than 20 infections total, we notice that, although q n is \u2248 0.1 days \u22121 , which is similar to a previous EVD outbreak 16 , q n varies significantly across administrative divisions. This result contrasts with many previous models that assume a global parameter can describe the growth of Ebola 3-7 . Furthermore, we find that q n decreases significantly with population density (Spearman \u03c1 = \u2212 0.48, p < 10 \u22123 , n = 44), plausibly because better healthcare may exist in higher density areas. This contrasts with a previous model, which predicted a positive scaling relation between the mean growth rate and population of cities 11 , although we are not aware of research that explored how disease spread is affected by population density. Therefore, not only is the growth rate of Ebola unexpectedly heterogeneous, but the dependence on population density may help us understand why this is the case.",

In the SI model, 100% of individuals are eventually infected, therefore, to find agreement with data, our model has to assume a small proportion of individuals in each division are susceptible to the disease. This seems implausible; more likely, all individuals are susceptible and, as they become aware of an infection, they reduce their interactions or otherwise reduce the overall disease transmissibility. To demonstrate this hypothesis, we created a more realistic, although still simplistic, disease model, in which susceptible (s) individuals can become infected (i), but then recover or are removed 17 . In our data, all individuals who recovered or died were assumed to be \"removed\". The SIR model, like the SI model, significantly overshoots the cumulative number of cases in the absence of intervention. We counter-balance this effect with an exponentially decreasing disease transmissibility as a result of public health interventions 18, 19 . We call this model the Susceptible -Decreasingly Infectious -Recovered (SDIR) model.",

These values are extremes and might not be likely to be encountered often, however there has been at least one other report of RNA seen in semen 100 days afterwards 27 . The length scale of 0.5 degrees, however, is roughly the distance between prefectures, which probably explains why the peak is at this bandwidth.

To quantify our small \"surprise\" of seeing a new s strain, we can write the equation: where I is the indicator function that a new infection's strain is s or not, and p(s) is the probability that the infection strain is s (See Fig. 8 ). On average, the difference between our prediction and data, S s , defined as should be 0, where the sum is over all sequences between the first and last appearance of strain s, and m is the number of sequences that satisfy this constraint.

Interestingly, we also find the values of SL1 appear to fluctuate, possibly because we only have 9 SL1 datapoints, versus 37, 19, 13, and 36 datapoints for GN1, GN2, GN3, and GN4, respectively. Most other strains have a success metric indicating a stronger strain than expected by chance probably because few strains are concurrent in time, and therefore, comparing S s across strains is difficult. Our method may be compared to the method used by Meyer, Elias, and Hohle 28 , who compared the success of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) strains. Common surveillance algorithms were found to be practical but these appear to be more useful for a chronic rather than an acute outbreak, such as EVD.",

            "text": "First, EVD appears to spread with a constant effective velocity through a migration network, in disagreement with the homogeneous mixing hypothesis (Figs 1 and 2 , and Supplementary Fig. S1 ) commonly used to model diseases like Ebola. By taking into account the role a migration network has in disease spread, we can predict where EVD will arrive with greater accuracy than before. This method can also accelerate the process of identifying the index case by determining which administrative division is the origin through arrival time-effective distance correlation maximization. Second, we find that the growth of EVD at the finer spatial resolutions can be well described by three scaling parameters, and the initial growth rate decreases with the population density, contrary to our intuition, which suggests that a population density-dependent EVD model may more accurately predict the spread of Ebola when the disease first arrives at an administrative division. One plausible explanation for this result is that higher population density areas receive better healthcare than other areas, but more work is necessary to understand this behavior. Finally, we find a wide variation in the transmissibility of different strains of EVD, which suggests that modeling each disease strain, when this information is known, can improve the prediction task by reducing the heterogeneity of the data. In addition, our method may improve vaccination strategies if vaccines are made for particularly transmissible strains as well as the most common ones. One way to take these factors into account would be through a meta-population model on top of a migration network with high spatial resolution. A meta-population model treats areas such as cities, districts, or countries as nodes on a network, with links connecting them to represent the flow of individuals from one area to another. Diseases within each area (node) are modeled with a compartmental model, under the assumption that the homogeneous mixing approximation is more accurate in smaller areas than for the entire network. Previous work has already found that a meta-population model 8 , or spatio-temporal model 2 , can accurately predict the spread of diseases. Finally, strain-dependent transmissibility may further improve model accuracy. . We define Q s to be the difference between the prediction and actual event. (b) S s , the expectation value of Q s , should be 0 if s is no more transmissible than the disease as a whole. If S s < 0, then we would say that s is more transmissible than the typical strain, while the opposite is true if S s > 0.",

All three data sets include the West African countries most affected by EVD as well as Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Senegal, and Togo, which had few, if any, EVD cases.

Four gravity model parameters were used to estimate the traffic between administration areas. Three were fit to migration using cell phone data in Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, and Senegal, respectively, while the final one was fit to IPUMS data. We found that all produce similar fits, and work equally well to estimate the effective distances between areas. In addition, using population data from Geohive (next section), we created a radiation migration model, found to more accurately estimate migration patterns than gravity models 29 , we therefore used this for all figures that use migration networks in this paper.
