Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of advances in spinal surgery on patient outcomes in the treatment of Scheuermann kyphosis (SK). Summary of Background Data: SK is one of the most common causes of back pain in adolescents. Trends in diagnoses and surgical treatment and approach to SK have not been well described. Methods: SK patients aged 0e20 years in KID were identified by ICD-9 code 732.0. KID-supplied year-and hospital-trend weights were used to establish prevalence. Patient demographics, surgical details, and outcomes were analyzed with analysis of variance. Results: A total of 1,070 SK patients were identified (33.2% female), with increasing incidence of SK diagnosed from 2003 to 2012 (3.6e7.5 per 100,000, p ! .001). The average age of operative patients was 16.1AE2.0 years and did not change (16.27e16.06 years, p 5 .905). The surgical rate has not changed over time (72.8%e72.8%, p 5 .909). Overall, 96.3% of operative patients underwent fusion, with 82.2% of cases spanning >4 levels; in addition, 8.6% underwent an anterior-only surgery, 74.6% posterior-only, and 13.6% combined approach. From 2003 to 2012, rates of posterior-only surgeries increased (62.4%e84.4%, p ! .001) whereas the rate of combinedapproach surgeries decreased (37.6%e8.8%, p ! .001). Overall complication rates for SK surgeries have decreased (2003: 20.9%; 2012: 11.9%, p 5 .029). Concurrently, the rate of >4-level fusions has increased (43.5%e89.6%, p ! .001), as well as the use of Smith-Peterson (7.8%e23.6%, p ! .001) and three-column osteotomies (0.0%e2.7%, p 5 .011). In subanalysis comparing posterior to combined approaches, complication rates were significantly different (posterior: 9.88%, combined: 19.46%, p 5 .005). Patients undergoing a combined approach have a longer length of stay (LOS) than patients undergoing a posterior-only approach (7.8 vs. 5.6 days, p ! .001). Conclusions: Despite unchanged demographics and operative rates in SK, there has been a shift from combined to isolated posterior approaches, with a concurrent increase in levels treated. A combined approach was associated with increased complication rates, LOS, and total charges compared to isolated approaches. Awareness of these inherent differences is important for surgical decision making and patient education.

SK is often confused for adolescent postural kyphosis; thus, a physical examination and radiographic analysis are necessary to differentiate the two conditions [14] .

Surgical interventional is indicated in SK patients for a large kyphotic curve, pain following conservative treatment, neurologic or cardiopulmonary impairments [11, 15] . Differences in outcomes for posterior-only procedures versus anterior-posterior surgeries have been described in the literature. A study from 1956 demonstrated that posterior-only surgeries were associated with some failed treatment for SK, possibly because of inadequate correction or lack of support from the anterior portion of the spine [16] . Thus, anteriorposterior combined-approach surgeries for SK were proposed, though with initial increased morbidity rates for patients undergoing combined-approach procedures [11] . Temponi et al. in 2011 compared posterior-only surgeries (with Smith-Peterson osteotomies) with combined-approach procedures and found that combined-approach surgeries achieved more correction of the curve but were associated with increased complication rates [11] . Advances in materials and implants used in spine surgery and technology available then led to a shift toward posterior-only approach surgeries for SK to avoid the high morbidity rates with combined-approach procedures. These posterior-only surgeries with associated pedicle screws and Smith-Peterson osteotomies have been reported as achieving and maintaining better correction and had fewer complications than combined-approach procedures in the treatment of SK [17] [18] [19] .

In addition, the KID database does not include any radiographic information, limiting our knowledge of the severity of the deformity preoperatively. KID also does not have the granularity to parse out the exact number of levels fused or the specific instrumentation used, which could potentially impact our findings.
