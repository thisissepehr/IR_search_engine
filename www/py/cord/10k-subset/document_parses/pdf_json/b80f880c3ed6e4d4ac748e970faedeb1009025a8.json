Previous studies have shown a reduced incidence of VAP with the use of inhibitors of biofi lm formation, such as silver coating of the ETT, although mortality benefi t is controversial [1] . In a prospective observational study, Gil-Perotin and colleagues [2] analyzed the relationship between endotracheal aspirate (EA) cultures (collected twice weekly), the presence of biofi lm at the time of extubation (defi ned by scanning electron microscopy), and the concordance of cultures from EA (just prior to extubation) and biofi lm cultures. In intubated patients (n = 75) during the 7-month study period, bacterial growth was present in 87% by surveillance cultures, and biofi lm formation was observed in 95% of all ETTs. Biofi lm was present as early as after 24 hours of intubation and was not associated with the duration of intubation, the administration of selective digestive decon tamination, systemic antibiotics, or immuno suppression. Acinetobacter baumannii (32%) and Pseudo monas aeruginosa (22%) were the predominant organisms on surveillance cultures and achieved a concordance of 69% with ETT cultures on extubation. Despite a high prevalence of airway colonization and biofi lm formation, only 17 episodes of VAP occurred during the study period (19%). Although appropriate therapy was given in 93%, the etiologic pathogen persisted in 50% of patients in the biofi lm culture, and persistence in biofi lm was commonly associated with treatment failure. Th ese fi ndings demonstrate the high prevalence of biofi lm formation in ETTs and the potential implication of bacterial survival in biofi lm as a reason for treatment failure in VAP, validating the current focus on reducing or eliminating bacterial biofi lm formation.",

Patient-centered and preventative strategies assume paramount importance in this era of limited health-care resources, in which eff ective targeted therapy is required to achieve the best outcomes. Risk stratifi cation using severity scores and infl ammatory biomarkers is a promising strategy for identifying sick patients early during their hospital stay. The emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens is becoming a major hurdle in intensive care units. Cooperation, education, and interaction between multiple disciplines in the intensive care unit are required to limit the spread of resistant pathogens and to improve care. In this review, we summarize fi ndings from major publications over the last year in the fi eld of respiratory infections in critically ill patients, putting an emphasis on a newer understanding of pathogenesis, use of biomarkers, and antibiotic stewardship and examining new treatment options and preventive strategies.",

In 89 patients with CAP, the mean plasma concentrations of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein were signifi cantly higher than in 63 healthy control subjects (85 versus 45 ng/mL, P <0.001 and 48 versus 10 ng/mL, P <0.001). However, the levels were not diff erent from patients with non-respiratory infections and did not correlate with disease severity or etiologic pathogen. Male patients with CAP had higher concentrations of SLPI compared with females, raising the possibility that this mediator may be one of the ways to explain sexdependent diff erences in the immune response.",

Of the 1,288 unique proteins identifi ed in all patients, 75 distinct proteins were unique to patients with ALI, but there were diff erent patterns of expression in those with and those without VAP. Patients with VAP and ALI had persistent infl ammation with upregulation of proteins related to activation of anti-bacterial and immunologic pathways, whereas reparative mechanisms had been initiated in the lungs of ALI patients without VAP. Th e investigators recognized three proteins -S100A8, lactotransferrin (LTF), and actinin 1 (ACTN1) -which could be combined to create a good discrimination between patients with and those without VAP (93% sensitivity and 94% specifi city). In another study using mass spectro metry analysis, Xiao and colleagues [6] applied matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-fl ight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectro metry to identify the etiologic agents from 70 patients with CAP by using throat-swab samples. Th e MALDI-TOF methodology identifi ed 210 of the 212 colonies that had been identifi ed on blood agar. However, it is still not clear whether this highly sensitive test can distinguish colonization from infection. Further studies are needed to measure the diagnostic utility of these new mass spectroscopy tools to determine whether, in the proper clinical context, they might become rapid and cost-eff ective methods for identifying the presence of pneumonia and the etiologic pathogens, thus helping to lead to a more focused and responsible antibiotic use.",

Th e authors compared the levels of three biomarkers -N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), midregional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP), and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) -with the pneumonia severity index (PSI) and CURB-65 score for predicting short-and long-term mortality; 63% of patients belonged to PSI class 4 and 5 combined, but the CURB-65 scores in the same cohort showed that only 17% patients were high-risk (groups 3 to 5). Th e levels of NT-proBNP (r = 0.53, P <0.001), MR-proANP (r = 0.57, P <0.001), and BNP (r = 0.47, P <0.001) gradually increased with increasing severity of CAP, which was classifi ed according to the PSI score. Th e 30-day mortality rate in the cohort was 11%, but in those who died, the levels of all three biomarkers were high. Multi variable regression analysis noted NT-proBNP (cutoff admission level was 1,935 pg/mL) and PSI (calculated cutoff for admission was 101 points) to be independent predictors of death. Furthermore, the levels of biomarkers correlated with plasma creatinine and epidermal growth factor receptor but did not correlate with CRP level, leukocyte count, or oxygen saturation. Th e predictive potential of the NPs was independent of antibiotic treatment, appropriateness, and duration of therapy. Th us, a combined assessment using categorical PSI score and NT-proBNP levels seemed benefi cial over a single-marker approach for short-and long-term risk stratifi cation. However, the authors pointed out that elevated NP levels should be used with caution in patients with renal failure or heart failure. Th e fi ndings are consistent with a recent meta-analysis of 12 studies, showing that BNP and NT-proBNP are powerful predictors of mortality in patients with sepsis [9] .",

In a meta-analysis, Schuetz and colleagues [13] compared data from 14 trials, in which 4,221 adults with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) were enrolled and in which the initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment were based on PCT guidance. All of the studies were either European or Asian and consisted of patients with initial suspicion of ARIs. Adherence to PCT-based algorithms was variable (47% to 91%), and in none of the trials were caregivers or patients blinded to group allocation. Th e PCT group and control group had similar characteristics, and CAP was the most common diagnosis (48%), followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). PCT levels were higher in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), but there was no diff erence in mortality in the various treatment settings (primary care, emergency room, and ICUs) in both the PCT group and control patients (5.7% versus 6.3%, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.94); however, patients in the PCT-guided group had less antibiotic exposure (adjusted diff erence in days, \u22123.47) in all clinical settings and across all ARI diagnoses. Treatment failure was similar in the two groups (PCT: 19.1% versus 21.9% in controls, adjusted OR 0.82). Even though the adherence to the PCT-guided protocol was variable (especially in the ICU), the lower antibiotic expo sure, with similar mortality and treatment failure, is striking. Nonetheless, further studies are needed, especially in the critical care setting, to conclusively prove that PCT-based treatment is safe.",

Th e study enrolled a total of 935 patients, of whom 51% (n = 473) had at least one risk factor for acquiring MDR bacteria on admission according to the American Th oracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) 2005 HCAP guidelines (hospitalization for at least 2 days in the pre ced ing 90 days, residency in a nursing home or extended-care facility, home infusion therapy including antibiotics, home wound care, chronic dialysis within 30 days, family member with an MDR pathogen, antimicrobial therapy in the preceding 90 days, and immunosuppression). Patients with at least one risk factor for MDR pathogens had more severe pneumonia on admission and a higher prevalence of severe sepsis compared with those without (45% versus 29%, P <0.001; 31% versus 21%, P = 0.001). S. pneumoniae was the most common pathogen isolated in both study groups, but there was a higher prevalence of MDR pathogens in patients with risk factors compared with those without (6.1% versus 0.9%, P <0.001). Of all the risk factors, hospitalization in the preceding 90 days (OR 4.87, 95% confi dence interval (CI) 1.90 to 12.4, P = 0.001) and residency in a nursing home (OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.12 to 11.24, P = 0.031) were independent predictors of infection with a resistant pathogen and mortality, emphasizing the fi nding that not all of the studied risk factors contributed equally to the risk of infection by MDR pathogens. Th e authors developed a clinical prediction score for determining the risk of MDR, using four variables (comorbid conditions, nursing home resident, hospitali zation in preceding 90 days, and chronic renal failure: 0.5, 3, 4, and 5 points, respectively). A score of greater than 0.5 had a sensitivity of 0.75 and a specifi city of 0.71 for determining the risk of MDR pathogens. But more importantly, among patients with a score of not more than 0.5 on entry, the prevalence of resistant bacteria was 8%, compared with 38% in those with a score of at least 3 (P <0.001). Th e fi ndings suggest a way to stratify patients with HCAP, so that not all would have required empiric broad-spectrum therapy.",

In addition, it is unclear whether the authors were reserving ICU admission for only the most severely ill, late in the course of illness, since 84% of the entire population needed mechanical ventilation, a relatively high number, suggesting that the ICU had not been used expectantly, and early in the disease process and therefore leading to higher mortality.",

Moran and colleagues [20] defi ned the incidence and risk factors for this infection in a prospective study of 627 patients from 12 emergency departments across the US during two infl uenza seasons (2006-07). MRSA was isolated from 2.4% of all patients and 5% of patients admitted to the ICU, mortality rate was 14%, and all isolates were of the USA 300 strain. Th ose who had MRSA isolated were sicker on admission and were more likely to have multiple infi ltrates or cavities on chest imaging, be intubated, or require vasopressors, compared with other patients. Other features associated with commu nity-acquired MRSA were nursing home admission in the previous year, close contact in the previous month with someone with a skin infection, and severe illness (coma, intubation, and need for vasopressors). Th e authors concluded that empiric therapy for MRSA should be considered in patients with severe CAP until MRSA is ruled out. Th is conclusion is at odds with the fi ndings in another study that found a similar incidence (3.2%) of MRSA in 621 ICU patients with CAP [21] . In that study, 57 patients received empiric MRSA therapy, and there were no diff erences in mortality, length of stay, or time to clinical stability [21] . Th e specifi c therapy of MRSA may be important, particularly if the organism present produces exotoxins such as the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). In a study of 133 patients with PVLpositive CAP, most of which was MSSA, the presence of MRSA did not increase mortality, but the use of therapies with anti-toxin eff ects (clindamycin, rifampin, and linezolid) was associated with a reduced mortality (6.1% versus 52.3%, P <0.001), although only about one third of patients received this therapy [22] .",

A group of French investigators evaluated the risk of developing pneumonia and bloodstream infections in relation to the presence of hypothermia of all causes in 6,237 medical ICU patients [24] . Hypothermia was classifi ed as mild (35.0\u00b0C to 35.9\u00b0C), moderate (32\u00b0C to 34.9\u00b0C), or severe (<32\u00b0C), and the cumulative incidence of at least one documented episode of hypothermia was 30% (1,849 out of 6,237). Seven hundred twenty-four patients (12%) developed nosocomial pneumonia, and 320 patients (5%) acquired bloodstream infections. Th e risks of developing pneumonia were 24.4% with severe hypothermia and 11.7% with no hypothermia, but the rate of lung infection was not increased by mild or moderate hypothermia. In multivariate analysis, severe hypothermia increased the risk of ICU infection in patients who did not present with severe sepsis or septic shock, and the hazard ratio was 2.76 (95% CI 1.44 to 5.28, P = 0.0009). A lack of eff ect noted in those with infection on admission may have been related to the early use of antibiotics in this population. Th is study, though interest ing, was retrospective and off ers no good information about the impact of antibiotic use or the etiology of hypothermia. However, consistent with these fi ndings is the obser vation in previous studies that therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest is a risk factor for early-onset nosocomial pneumonia [25] .",

Forel and colleagues [26] studied the incidence and outcomes of VAP in 339 patients who were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, placebo-con trolled, doubleblind trial of cisatracurium besylate and who were ventilated with LPV for severe ARDS. VAP was diagnosed in 28.9% of included patients, the daily risk for bacterial VAP increased until day 9 and then decreased, and the median time of onset was day 10 of ARDS ( Figure 1 ). Patients who had tracheostomy, enteral nutri tion, or subglottic secretion-drainage device had fewer episodes of VAP. ICU mortality rate was higher in patients with VAP compared with non-VAP patients (41.8% versus 30.7%, P = 0.05), but VAP was not an independent predictor of mortality in multivariate analysis.

In an eff ort to make the defi nitions of ICU-acquired pneumonia in ventilated patients more objective, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a number of investigators have proposed looking for ventilator-asso ciated complications (VACs) rather than VAP. To make the process objective, the defi nition of VAC has generally relied on changes in oxygenation and not required a chest radiograph, although many patients with VAC probably do not have pneu monia. With this approach, VAC occurs when there is a rise in fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) needs by at least 0.2, or a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) increase by at least 3 cm of water, for at least 2 days after 2 days of stability or improvement. If there is fever and a new antibiotic is started for at least 4 days, then an infectious VAC (IVAC) is defi ned. Th e IVAC population is then divided into possible or probable VAP, depending on clinical data (but not a chest radiograph) and culture results [27] .",

In Australia, Hayashi and colleagues [29] , using an electronic medical record, applied the defi nition of VAC and identifi ed 153 of 543 patients who met this defi nition. Of those with VAC, 47 had positive respiratory cultures and 40 received antibiotics, docu ment ing that VAC was much more common than VAP. Interestingly, the presence of VAC correlated with increased ICU length of stay, days on mechanical ventilation, and antibiotic use but not with mortality [29] . Although this new approach is interesting, it remains to be seen whether the rate of VAC can be infl uenced by preventive measures and by improve ments in quality of care, both of which are necessary if the monitoring of VAC rates is to be clinically meaningful.",

Only 62% of these events occurred in patients admitted to the ICU, and in this population, 52% were on vasopressors and 56% on mechanical ventilation. Cardiac arrest occurred earlier in the ICU than on the ward (at a median of 18.9 versus 28.4 hours), and of those with cardiac arrest on a medical ward, 52% were undergoing cardiac monitoring. Myocardial infarction and ischemia were present in 13.4% of patients with pneumonia, and the most common cause of cardiac arrest was an arrhythmia, generally not a shockable rhythm (asystole or pulseless electrical activity). In general, the fi ndings are alarming because they suggest that patients with CAP in the hospital, or even the ICU, commonly have cardiac ischemia and that the event may be abrupt and without warning. Since time-sensitive interventions are important in preventing adverse cardiovascular events, it is important to identify pneumonia patients who might have myocardial ischemia or sepsis-related cardiomyopathy, but more studies are needed to defi ne how to recognize these individuals at an early time point.",

Although earlier studies showed that VAP rates were reduced when surveillance was being done, it remains unclear whether this reduction was an artifact of observation (Hawthorne eff ect) or a true improvement in care. Benet and colleagues [32] took advantage of an interesting opportunity to observe the impact of disrup tion in the surveillance system for health care-acquired infection in one hospital. In a quasiexperimental study design from a single center in France, data from a medical-surgical ICU with surveillance disruption due to staff restructuring in 2007 (group A) was selected as the intervention group and compared with a medical ICU with continuous surveillance (group B), which served as the control group [32] . Prior to the disruption, period 1 (2004-6), and afterwards, period 2 (2008-10), both units had continuous surveillance in place. Th e VAP rate (number of VAPs per 100 intubated patients) increased in the intervention unit from period 1 to 2 (7.8% to 17.1%, P <0.001), whereas the VAP rate did not change signifi cantly in the control ICU during the same period (7.2% to 11.2%, P = 0.17). In unit A, between periods 1 and 2, the all-cause mortality (13.5% versus 18.8%, P = 0.028) and length of stay (12.2 versus 15.3 days, P = 0.038) increased, but this did not occur in unit B. Th e authors theorized that the worse outcomes in unit A were due to lack of data feedback and counseling during the year of surveillance disruption. However, the authors did not provide data on VAP prevention measures and compliance in either group.",

FQs can also be used as a second-line anti-TB therapy, and their empiric use in CAP may result in the emergence of drugresistant TB. In a retrospective study from Taiwan, investigators examined 77 patients who had culture-confi rmed pulmonary TB that was initially diagnosed as severe CAP and who were admitted to the ICU [36] . Patients were divided into two groups, depending on whether their initial treatment included an FQ. Forty-three patients (56%) were in the FQ group, and 34 (44%) were in the non-FQ group. Th e 100-day mortality rates were 40% and 68% for the FQ and non-FQ groups, respectively (P = 0.02, OR for death 0.36, P <0.01).

Although the study was retrospective and relatively small, the fi ndings did demonstrate that, con trary to classic teaching, the empiric use of FQs in severe CAP that later proves to be TB does not lead to a delay in proper treatment and may actually have a possible mortality benefi t. Th e reasons for benefi t are not clear, but in the study, molecular diagnostic methods for TB were not being used, and thus there was a long delay before the diagnosis of TB was established with conventional methods. In this setting, FQs may have reduced the infectious burden of TB since 65% of the FQ-treated patients had sputum conversion on quinolone monotherapy.",

Several earlier studies and one recent randomized trial have suggested that steroids have the benefi t of leading to a more rapid resolution of fever and hypoxemia and less need for mechanical ventilation [37] . Polverino and colleagues [38] , in a retrospective study, found that routine steroid therapy had no benefi t in patients with CAP if it was not used for another established indication. In a population of 3,257 patients with CAP, 260 received corticosteroids, generally because of chronic respiratory illness or a severe clinical presentation, but there was no benefi t in mortality and there was a longer length of stay (9 versus 6 days, P <0.01). Th e lack of benefi t also applied when those with a more severe illness (PSI classes IV and V) were examined. Th e mixed fi ndings of steroid benefi t may refl ect the fact that there is a subset of CAP patients who can benefi t, but steroids are being used in a non-selective fashion. Remelts and colleagues [39] analyzed data from a previous random ized controlled trial of steroid therapy in CAP and found that in the subset of patients with high cytokine levels and low cortisol (23 out of 275 patients), steroids substantially reduced mortality compared with placebo. However, in patients with high cytokine levels and high cortisol and in those with low cytokine levels, steroids had no benefi t compared with placebo.

Using an open-label randomized design, investigators from Korea randomly assigned 109 medical ICU patients with HAP to empiric therapy with imipenem (0.5 g every 6 hours) plus vancomycin (15 mg/kg every 12 hours), followed by de-escalaton (54 patients) versus conventional therapy (non-carbapenem, non-vancomycin empiric antimicrobials) without de-escala tion (55 patients) [40] .

Th e conventional therapy group received antibiotics according to the ATS 2005 guidelines, except that none received carbapenems or vancomycin: piperacillin/tazobactam plus ciprofl oxacin (63.6%), piperacillin/ tazobactam plus aminoglycoside (20%), and ceftazidime plus either ciprofl oxacin or amino glycoside (9.1%). Th e initial antimicrobial was adequate more often in the deescalation group com pared with the conven tional therapy group (75.9% versus 48%, P = 0.035), particularly for MRSA, and broad-spectrum agents were discontinued more often in the former group (vanco mycin was discontinued in 83.3% and imipenem/cilastatin in 84.8%). Interestingly, there was no measure able outcome benefi t to the de-escalation protocol, there was no diff erence between the two groups in overall length of ICU stay or mortality, and patients in the de-escalation group had a higher incidence of emergence of MRSA in subsequent cultures, compared with the conventional group (27.6% versus 9.5%, P = 0.059). It is diffi cult to understand the lack of benefi t of the de-escalation approach, particularly since it did lead to more initially adequate therapy and less antibiotic usage, although relatively few patients had VAP (<10%) and more patients in the de-escalation group had MDR pathogens than in the control group.",

Doripenem has shown to have in vitro activity against P. aeruginosa that is better compared to other carbapenems. In an eff ort to optimize the duration of VAP therapy (including infection with MDR Gramnegative bacteria), a multicenter randomized doubleblind study was done to compare a 7-day course of highdose (1 g) doripenem given as a 4-hour infusion, to a 10day course of 1 g dose imipenem each given every 8 hours. Th e investigators hypothesized that by using a highly active carbapenem given by prolonged infusion, it would be possible to optimize the killing of potentially resistant Gram-negative bacteria, facilitating shortduration therapy for these organisms [41] . Th e study was prematurely stopped because of documented inferiority of the 7-day regimen, particularly for VAP caused by P. aeruginosa. Th e microbiological intent to treat (MITT) population (167 patients: 79 doripenem and 88 imipenemcilastatin) was the subset of patients who had received at least one study drug and had at least one Gram-negative pathogen identifi ed in signifi cant concentrations in BAL, sensitive to imipenem.

All-cause 28-day mortality was also higher in the doripenem arm com pared with imipenem, though not signifi cantly (21.5% versus 14.8%), but mortality was statistically higher for patients with P. aeruginosa who were treated with doripenem.

Patients who had severe infection and who required meropenem were randomly assigned either to the infusion group (n = 120) (loading dose of 2 g of meropenem followed by a continuous infusion of 4 g of meropenem over 24 hours) or to the bolus group (n = 120) (2 g of meropenem over 30 minutes every 8 hours).

Patients who received the infusion regimen also had a shorter ICU stay, lower total dose of meropenem, and fewer days on meropenem.

To address the criticism of the retrospective nature of these data, a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study comparing linezolid with vancomycin for documented MRSA nosocomial pneumonia was conducted [44] . Patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous linezolid (600 mg every 12 hours) or vancomycin (15 mg/kg every 12 hours, with the dose optimized, based on trough levels and renal function) for 7 to 14 days.

Th e relative 'improvement' in mortality with vancomycin in this study may have been related to the fact that vancomycin dosing was optimized and that patients failing vancomycin could be treated with linezolid (unlike in earlier studies). In this latter circumstance, if the salvage therapy prevented mortality, although the patient would be a vancomycin clinical failure, the patient was also reported as vancomycin non-mortality.",

Th e investigators found that mortality was lower (34% versus 40%, P = 0.042) when therapy was given with a combination therapy that included at least two antimicrobials with diff erent mechanisms of action (given in 28.3%) compared with monotherapy and with combination therapy that did not include agents with two diff erent mechanisms of action (given in 71.7%). When diff erent class combination therapy was administered, the most commonly used agents were beta-lactams, quinolones, aminoglycosides, and carbapenems, in that order. Unfortunately, the study did not have microbiologic data to explain the mechanism for benefi t of the combination therapy, but the authors speculated that it may have been due to a synergistic eff ect of using two agents with diff erent mecha nisms or could have been the result of including immunomodulatory agents such as macrolides and quinolones.",

Data from a single-center mixed ICU with positive blood cultures for Candida species were included in the retrospective analysis, which documented that when Candida bacteremia was treated in the ICU, it was more often non-ICUA infection than infection arising in the ICU (82 patients: 46.3% in ICUA and 53.6% non-ICUA).

Although the authors did not provide a clear explanation of the reported diff erences in mortality among patients with a higher APACHE II score, the fi ndings could be related to early institution of prophylactic anti-fungal therapy in sicker patients in the ICUAC group compared with the non-ICUAC group.",

One mechanism that allows this progression is termed 'quorum sensing' (QS), a process by which organisms promote their own proliferation into biofi lm by the release of QS-regulated virulence factors in the form of rhamnolipids (class of glycolipid). Macrolides, such as azithromycin, have been shown to interfere with QS and thus could prevent VAP by interfering with organism growth to high concentrations in biofi lm. Considering these concepts, van Delden and colleagues [53] conducted a randomized double-blind multicenter trial in 92 patients with P. aeruginosa to determine whether therapy with 300 mg/day azithromycin, in comparison with placebo, could prevent VAP. Overall, there was no benefi t to the use of azithromycin, but there was a slight decline in the frequency of VAP (4.7% versus 14.3%, P = 0.16). However, 23 patients in the azithromycin arm and 18 in the control group had organisms with either high or intermediate levels of rhamnolipid production, and in those patients (who presumably had QS-dependent colonization), the use of azithromycin led to a nearly signifi cant reduction in VAP (P = 0.07). As a proof-of-concept study, the data are interesting and suggest that this novel approach to VAP prevention in patients with P. aeruginosa colonization may merit further study.",

Arvaniti and colleagues [54] conducted a prospective observational study to defi ne the role of colonization pressure (carriers' patient-days \u00d7 100/all patients' patient-days) and patient-related factors in the acquisition of MDR A. baumannii infection in ICU patients. Th e investigators collected screening samples on admission to the ICU, and the colonization pressure and absolute number of carriers were measured on a weekly basis. Of the 284 patients screened, 16 patients (5.6%) were positive on admission and 32 patients (15.7%) developed acquisition during the ICU stay. Acquisition of A. baumannii correlated with weekly colonization pressure (P = 0.004) and with the number of carriers per week (P <0.001). More than one carrier per week increased the acquisition risk proportionately (2 or 3 carriers, OR 12, P = 0.028; 4 or more carriers, OR 25, P = 0.004). Medical patients with extended administration of antibiotics (OR 1.24) and longer duration of mechanical ventilation in the ICU (OR 1.08) were the most vulnerable to acquisition. Although similar results were obtained with previous studies on MRSA and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, the present study is the fi rst to demonstrate a correlation between colonization pressure and subsequent Acinetobacter acquisition in the ICU. Th e study suggests that appropriate ICU infection control strategies should include assessment of colonization pressure and patient-related risk factors to avoid endemic MDR Acinetobacter-related nosocomial infections.",
