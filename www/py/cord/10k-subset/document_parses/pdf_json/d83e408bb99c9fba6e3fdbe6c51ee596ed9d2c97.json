The recent emergence of Lyme disease in Quebec, Canada is a good example of a complex health issue for which the public health sector must find protective interventions. Traditional preventive and control interventions can have important environmental, social and economic impacts and as a result, decision-making requires a systems approach capable of integrating these multiple aspects of interventions. This paper presents the results from a study of a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach for the management of Lyme disease in Quebec, Canada. MCDA methods allow a comparison of interventions or alternatives based on multiple criteria. Methods: MCDA models were developed to assess various prevention and control decision criteria pertinent to a comprehensive management of Lyme disease: a first model was developed for surveillance interventions and a second was developed for control interventions.

For example, larvicides used in attempts to control WNv during the 1999-2007 outbreak in Canada were found to be toxic for some wild bird and fish species, and their use was publicly criticized by local media and experts [6] .

Multiple MCDA algorithms exist to analyse different types of decision problems, one of which consists of ranking and comparing alternatives based on multiple criteria that can be evaluated using either quantitative and/or qualitative indicators [13] . In the absence of quantitative data for a criterion in a specific context, MCDA methods allow for the incorporation of qualitative evaluations, for example based on expert opinion. Moreover, it offers the possibility, if needed, for a participatory approach with stakeholders concerned by a particular issue, allowing them to actively engage in all stages of the decision analysis supported by MCDA. As such, MCDA methods are well suited for complex, transdisciplinary and multi-sectoral decision-making problems such as zoonotic disease management [14, 15] . The use of MCDA in public health has thus far been limited but is emerging as a complementary method for evidence-based public health [16] [17] [18] . It has been used in different contexts, such as for the prioritization of general health issues, including zoonoses [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , and to compare potential alternatives or interventions for public health management. For this later goal, most published studies have been in the field of environmental health, but some more recent studies were done to prioritize interventions for infectious diseases management [24] [25] [26] . Fewer studies have attempted to confront zoonotic or animal related disease problems with an MCDA approach: one such study used MCDA to compare strategies for the elimination of carcasses following a hypothetical event of food-industry targeted terrorism [27] , another used MCDA to compare different methods of quarantine and control during animal disease epidemics [28, 29] .

The incidence of Lyme disease has been increasing annually in North America, particularly in the north-eastern United States where more than 20,000 cases are reported annually [31] . In the Canadian province of Quebec, the incidence of Lyme disease has thus far been low (0.5 per 100 000 in 2011 according to a recent report by the Quebec National Institute of Public Health [32] compared to rates of 60.3, 67.3 and 76 per 100 000 in the same year in the neighbouring states of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont respectively [33] ), but could grow to 8 000 cases annually by 2050 in the southeast and the central southern parts of Canada [34] [35] [36] [37] . The first autochtonous human case of Lyme disease in Quebec was reported in 2008 (Quebec National Institute of Public Health, unpublished observations). Black legged tick populations, the vector of B. burgdorferi, are now recognized as having become established in the southern part of the province, with up to 13% of ticks infected with B. burgdorferi [37] . Given these changing dynamics, the Quebec public health authorities have expressed the desire to proactively respond to this public health concern and to develop a Lyme disease management plan. As such, this is an ideal context for the use of MCDA methods for zoonotic disease management. In the Quebec health system, public health responsibilities, including Lyme disease prevention, are shared between provincial and regional public authorities. The Ministry of Health and Social Services, supported by the National Institute of Public Health in Quebec, is the provincial authority and first level responsible for applying provincial public health programs in collaboration with regional authorities [38] . Each of the 18 administrative regions of the province has their own Health and Social Services Agency. No province-wide program for Lyme disease management currently exists due to the fact that the disease is presently only concentrated in the southern part of Quebec and has affected only a few regions.

A participatory approach (focus groups, individual interviews, questionnaires) with a group of stakeholders was adopted for this study. A stakeholder was defined as a person representing an organisation or a group with direct responsibilities or with specific interests in Lyme disease management. This included representatives of governmental or non-governmental organisations, health professionals and experts (different from the research team). Stakeholders were asked to represent the preferences of their organisation and not their own preferences. To make this possible, they were invited to consult other colleagues in their organisation throughout the MCDA process. Stakeholders participated most intensively in the problem definition stage, identification of the extended stakeholders group, identification of key decision issues, translation of these issues into measurable criteria, identification of Lyme disease intervention strategies (steps 1 to 5) and weighting of the criteria (step 7). The identification of issues (step 3), the definition of criteria (step 4) and the selection of interventions (step 5) were done using an iterative process with the stakeholders: the research group proposed a first set of interventions and criteria along with their definitions, indicators for each criteria and appropriate measurement scales based on their understanding of the major surveillance and control issues for Lyme disease.

Each stakeholder was asked to create model-specific weighting schemes based on the stakeholder's perceived importance of criteria for decision-making in line with their organisational affiliation. This was done by first distributing 100 points among the criteria categories and then re-distributing the category specific points to all criteria within each category.

PROMETHEE methods enable fully comparative rankings of a set of alternatives [11] . The decision map, which is called a GAIA plan and is generated by the D-sight software, is a two-dimensional graphical representation of a stakeholder's position, dictated by their individual preferences (ranking of interventions). The decision map is referenced with a decision axis (in red), which points toward the \"best\" interventions in accordance with the group scores of interventions on all included criteria. The proximity of stakeholder's positions within the GAIA plan represents proximity in their overall preferences. This graphical representation of stakeholder values can be used to identify potential coalitions or clusters of positions among stakeholders and to identify positions that are distinctive from that of other stakeholders by their distances in relation to others or to the decision axis. Similarly to positioning stakeholders, the GAIA plan also positions all interventions in relation to the overall decision axis. Multi-criteria analyses carried out in D-sight assess the performance of interventions over all criteria resulting in numerical scores for each intervention. Dsight uses specific algorithms based on a pair wise method of analysis to calculate scores (PROMETHEE I and II) [33] . The intervention scores and weighting schemes set by stakeholders can be combined to produce three sets of results of particular interest in our study: 1) group rankings of the interventions, representing an ordered ranking of most preferred to least preferred intervention that takes all weighting schemes and intervention performance scores into account; 2) individual rankings for each stakeholder, representing the most preferred to least preferred intervention for a particular stakeholder given their specific weighting scheme; and 3) individual performance of interventions for every criterion, showing how an intervention performs on every criterion independently of all stakeholder weighting schemes. Intervention scores represent the relative performance of an intervention with respect to another, and as such scores do not have individual meanings by themselves.

Stakeholder's positions (represented by S1-8 in this figure) are determined by the combination of the intrinsic performance of interventions and by the stakeholder's weighting scheme. The closer a stakeholder is to the decision axis (for example S2 and S7 in this map), the more important their agreement with the best consensual interventions (i.e. first ranked interventions), and vice-versa. Interventions located close to the decision axis (CONT0, CONT3a and CONT11 in Figure 2 ) are the preferred interventions for the group, and correspond to the three best ranked interventions in Table 5 . A long decision axis indicates strong decision choice power whereas a short decision axis indicates that the compromise solution is close to the origin [42] . The worst ranked interventions are diametrically opposed to this axis (CONT6b, CONT6a, and CONT8). In Figure 2 , all eight stakeholders point toward the right of the x axis, meaning that there are no major discordances in their preferences. Stakeholder 6 and stakeholder 8 are located somewhat apart from the rest of the group's preferences and had the most different preferences and individual rankings.

However, any variations in the weight of the \"PHC1-Reduction in human cases incidence\" criterion beyond the range of 27.5 to 38.2 will result in a change in nature of the top ranked interventions for stakeholder 3 indicating that the results are more sensitive to this later criterion.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of MCDA models to document stakeholder engagement in the prioritization of Lyme disease management interventions, and the first use of such an approach to analyse public health interventions for an emerging zoonosis tackling surveillance and control interventions in a comprehensive manner. One of the key observations resulting from this study pertains to the list of criteria identified for use in the different fields of interventions relating to Lyme disease management. The general criteria categories demonstrate the comprehensiveness of the models and lend support to the use of MCDA methods as concrete applications of a \"One Health\" approach to zoonoses management. The list of criteria could likely be generalized or adapted for use with other vector-borne and zoonotic disease management problems. As an example, four of the general categories (public health, animal and environmental health, social impacts and strategic, economic and operational impacts) and several criteria identified with a different group of stakeholders for two other MCDA models developed to address communication strategies for Lyme disease in Quebec by the research team were identical to those identified for SURV and CONT models (MCDA-Lyme Consortium, 2012, data not shown). Furthermore, the criteria identified in this study correspond directly to the dimensions which should be integrated when analysing public policies, as identified and recommended by the Canadian National Collaborating Centre for Healthy Public Policy. This centre recently published a method for synthesizing knowledge about public policies, integrating six dimensions [43] , which can be directly correlated to our list of criteria as shown in Table 8 . This observation reinforces the fact that MCDA methods have the potential to improve public health decisions in line with the most recent national recommendations for evaluating public policies. The observed variations in stakeholder's weighting of criteria was expected and can be explained as a result of differences in values, perspectives, objectives and expertise of the participating stakeholders, which is desirable within a interdisciplinary and multi-sectoral approach. On the other hand, changing the scenario from \"emergence\" to \"epidemic\" was found to have little effect on the results, which was unexpected for the research team. Although some additional weighting was given to the public health criteria by several stakeholders during the epidemic scenario, the changes were not sufficient to produce clear differences in the overall rankings of interventions between scenarios. More weight for public health criteria and social acceptability criteria during the epidemic scenario were expected but not clearly observed in this study. One hypothesis is that the description given of the epidemic scenario was not sufficiently alarming to prompt important differences in stakeholder weighting schemes between scenarios. Further analyses are needed under real epidemic situations to validate these observations and to correlate the findings of the MCDA analysis with actions that would actually be implemented by stakeholders in such situations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1971, "end": 1975, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2047, "end": 2054, "text": "Table 8", "ref_id": "TABREF11"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In both models, performance evaluations of interventions used qualitative categorical indicators for every criterion. If ordinal scales were better suited for the evaluation of certain criteria, as was the case for the SEC4 (complexity) criterion, numeric scales were used to incorporate more precision for other criteria, such as PHC1 (reduction in human case incidence), SEC1 and SEC2 (costs for the public and the private sectors). Moreover, experts who contributed to the evaluation of certain parameters were also stakeholders on the MCDA process for the CONT model. If this approach can be interesting for the appropriation of the decision-making process by the stakeholders, it could also introduce bias in the evaluation of parameters, as preferences and expertise can vary among them. This reflected the data quality which was available at the time of the study and is the main limit of this study. Lyme disease is emerging in Quebec, and very few field studies have been performed to date. The data quality evaluation performed in the models was useful for identifying gaps in the scientific knowledge on public health intervention efficacy and impacts in the Quebec context. For the vast majority of interventions and criteria, expert opinions were the most effective way to obtain the data required to complete the models. More time and resources could be used to counter this weakness: field studies can be realized with the objective of increasing the precision of performance evaluations in models. For example, to assess the social acceptability of different control interventions, a Delphi survey was conducted among the stakeholders. A more representative survey conducted among the target population could increase the precision of this performance measure. Furthermore, additional analysis using the same MCDA model structure in other geographical areas where Lyme disease epidemiology is better characterised would provide an opportunity to validate the present model. The first position occupied by CONT0 (status quo-basic preventive communications) in the group ranking for the CONT model was expected. The current communication method in place involves the diffusion of general information via the public organisation's web interface. This intervention is a baseline intervention upon which stakeholders should build (but not eliminate) and include additional interventions to improve Lyme management.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "For the SURV model, the top two ranked interventions were SURV2a (active surveillance of I. scapularis by flagging or dragging) and SURV2b (active surveillance of I. scapularis by trapping of small rodents).

SURV model revealed similar observations. Even if these results represent only the views of a small group of stakeholders, greater differences could have been expected. For example, from stakeholders working for public environmental organisations, one could have expected stronger preferences for low environmental impact interventions, when compared to public health professionals. This observation demonstrates that public health protection is still a strong commonly held value, despite expertise and sectoral differences between stakeholders. In this study, there were no representatives from the general public or from public interest groups. This was a methodological choice made after discussion with participating stakeholders and in light of the exploratory nature of the objectives. The inclusion of such groups, either as representatives of the general public or of representatives of select interest groups (for example members of the Canadian Lyme disease foundation, CanLyme, or public park users) could help diversify the range of expressed preferences and concerns, an important dimension that should be considered in public health decision making.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Analysis of the intervention profiles allowed identification of complementary interventions for all models.

Other types of variation, for example on performance parameters of interventions, have to be simulated manually by changing parameters in the matrix. This was not realised in a systematic manner for this study but would be an interesting further step, particularly on parameters which are not supported by the scientific literature. This could help to identify which would be the more urgent knowledge gaps to tackle to consolidate decision-making in this context. Except for sensitivity analysis, the evaluation of a MCDA model's validity is rarely mentioned in the scientific literature [44] . A framework for MCDA model validity testing would be of great use for public health research. This framework could include more extensive sensitivity analysis on weights and parameters, as well as a standardised approach to assess how accurately the model captures issues of importance to decision-makers. Building on this study's experience, the authors believe that MCDA approaches offer a structured and systematic process for identifying gaps in the scientific knowledge relating to important decision issues, and can be of great use to guide research priorities in public health in a context of finite and sometimes scarce resources. Another major advantage of formal decision analysis methods is the long-term utility it can confer to decision-makers. Once the matrix is completed (i.e. criteria, interventions and performances have been identified), stakeholders can re-evaluate their weights on each criteria as the epidemiological situation of the disease changes, and can observe the impacts on intervention prioritization. Used in this manner, MCDA models could be adapted and potentially used with real-time decision-making methods.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 719, "end": 723, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Some challenges arose during the study. First, depending on the scope and depth of the analysis, the MCDA process can be time-consuming: given the participatory approach used in this study, a significant time commitment was needed for meetings and discussions. Experts recommend a minimum of six months to complete an MCDA process with participative components. However, in this case, two years were needed to put together the research team and complete the study. Public health experts had no experience with MCDA methods, and the learning process demanded time and resources. This is not surprising and prolonged timelines have been observed in other multidisciplinary teams [7] . As such, MCDA approaches may be best suited for strategic public health planning rather than for daily decisions and emergency situations, unless MCDA models are already developed. Creating weighting schemes was also challenging and not intuitive for the majority of stakeholders. Individual support was needed in several cases, and participants needed a good understanding of the MCDA process to perform the weighting. Methods exist to facilitate the weighting process in MCDA approaches, such as the use of card sets to help order criteria before attributing numerical values [45] .

Results showed that despite different weighting schemes among stakeholders, both models revealed a good level of agreement with regards to preferred interventions for surveillance and control of Lyme disease. The reliance primarily on expert opinion for development of the performance matrices underscores the need to enhance scientific knowledge on issues of importance for decision-making for Lyme management in Quebec. Overall, explicit decision analysis methods present themselves as an interesting systematic approach for the management of complex public health issues and particularly for emerging infectious diseases arising from human populations interacting with animals and the environment. Future steps should include an assessment of the applicability and usefulness of the proposed models for program-level decision support pertinent to the prevention and control of Lyme disease in Canada. Moreover, building on the outcome of this project, future projects should evaluate the utility of MCDA for structuring a formal decision analysis approach for other complex public health issues (e.g.: prevention of foodborne and waterborne diseases, antimicrobial resistance, influenza, and environmental health issues) as well as within various ongoing processes and prioritization settings targeting effective multi-sectoral engagement. The development of a methodological framework for MCDA model validation would also be of great interest for the public health sector.
