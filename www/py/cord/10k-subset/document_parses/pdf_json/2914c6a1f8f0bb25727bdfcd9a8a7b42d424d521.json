As of August 2010, the virus had already caused more than 18 449 deaths in at least 214 countries worldwide [1] . The World Health Organization officially announced the step-down of pdmH1N1 to postpandemic phase on 10 August 2010, and the virus was expected to circulate as a seasonal virus in the human population thereafter [2] . Gene segments of the pdmH1N1 virus are derived from multiple lineages, including the Eurasian swine, the classical swine, and the triple reassortant swine lineages. Multiple genetic reassortment events of viral components have taken place and thus gave rise to this novel pandemic virus [3] . Clinical symptoms of pdmH1N1 infection are usually mild, possibly due to the cross-protection offered by memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes established from previous exposure to seasonal influenza [4] .",

Although the H9N2/G1 virus was found mainly in poultry, it has the ability to transmit across species, and with its genetic similarity to the highly pathogenic H5N1, it also poses a threat of becoming pandemic [7] .",

However, other studies have shown that the antiviral function of MBL may vary among different strains of influenza viruses, depending on the number of potential glycosylation sites on the viral hemagglutinin (HA) globular domain [17, 18] . Influenza virus-infected epithelial cells and macrophages can initiate a cellspecific response that includes the transcription and release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines [19, 20] . Although some studies have indicated that MBL may regulate proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine release from phagocytes in response to bacterial stimulation [21, 22] , little is known about its immunomodulatory role in influenza [23] .",

Accumulating evidence has suggested that MBL exhibits in vitro anti-influenza virus properties by direct neutralization, inhibiting influenza virus hemagglutination, binding to the influenza virus as an opsonin, and activating the complement system through the lectin pathway [14, 16, 23] . However, these properties vary among different virus strains and subtypes [17, 18] .

            "text": "We demonstrated that despite these 2 strains of viruses being bound by rhMBL via the CRD of MBL at the physiological level, they infected both MBL WT and MBL KO mice effectively. Our results are consistent with a recent in vitro study by Job et al [18] , in which MBL was found to bind to pdmH1N1 fairly in vitro but the virus was resistant to the antiviral activity of MBL. The number and position of potential glycosylation sites on the viral HA globular domain determine the binding affinity between MBL and the virus. Even though MBL can physically bind to the virus, the binding may be insufficient for executing any antiviral function. Arguably, Chang et al [23] recently reported that MBL deficiency increases susceptibility to infection with influenza A virus Philippine 82 H3N2 (Phil82), which is a human strain. We reconcile with the suggestion that MBL effects would differ depending on strains of influenza A virus and thus MBL causes variable antiviral activities and host responses. The degree of glycosylation on the globular head of the HA molecule is believed to be essential for MBL to exhibit its antiviral properties. For Phil82 virus, the high-mannose oligosaccharide at residue 165 of the HA molecule has already been shown to be crucial for the neutralization by MBL [31] . Although pdmH1N1 virus contains a single potential glycosylation site at the base of the HA globular head (Asn 104 ), it lacks potential glycosylation sites on the globular head region of HA (Asn 142 , Asn 144 , Asn 172 , Asn 177 , and Asn 179 ) [18] . To our knowledge, binding of MBL on H9N2/G1 virus is not well documented in the literature. Therefore, we analyzed the potential glycosylation sites on HA of H9N2/G1 virus based on an in silico approach as suggested by Job et al [18] . The HA sequence data was retrieved from GenBank (AAF00706.1) and we used NetNGlyc 1.0 server to predict the number of potential glycosylation sites. We found that there was no potential glycosylation sites near residue 165 of the HA molecule of H9N2/G1 virus. We speculate that as a result of the absence of potential glycosylation sites near the receptor-binding domain of the HA globular head of both pdmH1N1 virus and H9N2/G1 virus, MBL fails to interfere with the viral binding to target cells despite its ability to bind the virus. This can adequately explain the discrepancy between the present in vivo data and Chang's study [23] .",

            "text": "In this study, MBL WT mice were found to have a more severe disease in terms of greater weight loss and worse lung pathology than MBL KO mice during either pdmH1N1 or H9N2/G1 virus infection. This suggests that MBL may contribute to the disease severity seen in the MBL WT mice. To elucidate the mechanisms, we investigated the immune response, such as production of cytokines and chemokines at various time points during the infection. Most cytokines and chemokines were detected with similar kinetics, with the peak on day 7 following influenza virus infection in both MBL WT and MBL KO mice. These data suggest that the most critical phase of influenza infection occurs around day 7 after infection, and this is Interestingly, we found that MBL contributed to a more severe proinflammatory response by increasing the production of several proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, and IFN-c. Interleukin 1a and IL-1b are multifunctional proinflammatory cytokines produced readily by influenzainfected leukocytes. They are capable of inducing fever, anorexia, and weight loss [32] . Enhanced production of these cytokines can contribute to the acute lung immunopathology after influenza virus infection in mice [33] and induce gene expression of other cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-a [34, 35] . Despite the abundance of IL-6 following the influenza virus infection, in vivo studies showed that it does not contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection because the mortality and morbidity observed in mice infected with H5N1 are comparable in both MBL WT and IL-6 deficient mice [36, 37] . Tumor necrosis factor a is readily produced by influenza virusinfected leukocytes and can activate macrophages, stimulate dendritic cell maturation and neutrophils, further enhance the inflammatory response, and activate efficient antigen presentation system in the infected site [20, 38] . Excessive production of TNF-a causes tissue injury, hemorrhagic shock, and death in mice [39, 40] . Interferon c is also an important proinflammatory cytokine that has different functions, including the activation of macrophages, differentiation of Th1 from T cells, enhancement of antigen presentation, and expression of the chemokine gene [41, 42] . These proinflammatory cytokines are commonly found in the acute-phase response to influenza virus infection and may induce immunity but also cause damage to the host tissue [43] . These cytokines were also increased in our infected murine lung, with significantly higher levels in MBL WT mice than in MBL KO mice on day 7, coinciding with body weight loss and lung histological findings. Interleukin 10, an antiinflammatory cytokine, was also significantly higher in MBL WT mice than in MBL KO mice on day 7. Interleukin 10 deficiency was reportedly protective in high-dose influenza virus infection [44] , implying that increased IL-10 may be deleterious to the host. As a consequence of such an overwhelming ''cytokine storm'' [45, 46] , the MBL WT mice were found to have a worse disease course than in the MBL KO mice, including greater body weight loss and more severe lung inflammation.",

The concentrations of cytokines shown are mean 6 standard error of the mean of 5 mice per group and 2 mice per mock treatment group. *P , .05, **P , .01, ***P , .001. consistent with the result showing the peak of body weight loss around day 7.",
