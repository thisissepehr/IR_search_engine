Modelling approaches can sometimes fail to predict disease spread, which may partly be due to the number of unknown sources of variation in host behaviour. The European badger is a wildlife reservoir for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in Britain and Ireland, and individual behaviour has been demonstrated to be an important factor in the spread of bTB among badgers and to cattle. Radiotelemetry devices were deployed on 40 badgers from eight groups to investigate patterns of den (sett) use in a highdensity population, where each group had one or two main and three to eight outlier setts in their territory. Badgers were located at their setts for 28 days per season for 1 year to investigate how patterns differed between individuals. Denning behaviour may have a strong influence on contact patterns and the transmission of disease. We found significant heterogeneity, influenced by season, sex and age. Also, when controlling for these, bTB infection status interacting with season was highly correlated with sett use. Test-positive badgers spent more time away from their main sett than those that tested negative. We speculate that wider-ranging behaviour of test-positive animals may result in them contacting sources of infection more frequently and/or that their behaviour may be influenced by their disease status. Measures to control infectious diseases might be improved by targeting functional groups, specific areas or times of year that may contribute disproportionately to disease spread.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Heterogeneities in behaviours between individuals are pivotal to the ecological and evolutionary processes of mammalian populations (Dall et al. 2012) .

In the first instance, such heterogeneities may be driven by fixed parameters such as sex and age (Altizer et al. 2003) . Some studies have found that sexually mature males may be more important in the spread of parasites than females, for example in terms of exhibited behaviours and also the greater susceptibility of males to infection due to testosterone-induced immunecompromise (Zuk and McKean 1996; Perkins et al. 2003; Skorping and Jensen 2004) . Alternatively, differences could be more under the control of the individual, with studies showing that individuals displaying more exploratory behaviours have a greater probability of contracting and/or transmitting disease (e.g. Natoli et al. 2005) . For example, cattle and deer were found to vary in the level of 'curiosity' that they show to dead possums (a potential host for bTB) on pasture, which in turn is likely to influence their probability of exposure to the pathogen (Sauter and Morris 1995) . In the second instance, the behaviour of infected animals can be important if it is in some way different from that of healthier individuals.

Most territories in highdensity populations contain between three to six dens, loosely categorised as 'main' or 'outlier' setts (Neal and Cheeseman 1996; Roper 2010) . In general, there is one, or more rarely two, main sett(s) per territory serving as the primary, yearround social group residence(s) (Neal and Roper 1991) . Speculation remains as to the function of generally smaller, but more numerous, outlier setts that have fewer entrance holes and tend to be only occupied intermittently (Kruuk 1978; Harris et al. 1989; Macdonald et al. 2004) . Individuals have been shown to vary in the extent to which they use main vs outlier setts (Roper et al. 2001; Kowalczyk et al. 2004; B\u00f6hm et al. 2008) . In a study carried out at Woodchester Park, Gloucestershire, a significant positive correlation was found between the number of setts in a territory and the positive bTB status of the group (Rogers et al. 2003) , which raises the possibility that the use of outlier setts may be related to disease dynamics (also suggested by Roper et al. 2001) . Field evidence from badger populations infected with bTB strongly suggests that transmission risks for this disease in badgers are closely related to the extent of movement between social groups (Vicente et al. 2007 ) and associated behaviours such as aggressive encounters (Jenkins et al. 2012) . There is some evidence that bTB test-positive badgers range more widely and/or use outlier setts more frequently than apparently uninfected individuals (Cheeseman and Mallinson 1981; Woodroffe et al. 1999) .

The findings have implications for the time of the year and the location of effort for targeting disease management strategies. While at this stage we are unable to disentangle the cause and effect of our findings, we speculate on the potential mechanism (s) underlying the observations. Additionally, when controlling for the fixed factors and testing the random effect of 'individual', we still found significant variation for this term. Repeatability analysis showed that individual heterogeneity was consistent between the seasons in which the animal was tested. Together, these results highlight the potential importance of individual behaviour for the dynamics of disease transmission in a wildlife population (Barber and Dingemanse 2010) . Badgers that tested positive for bTB were more likely to use outlier setts compared to those that tested negative, with these differences being most pronounced in summer and autumn. This provides a putative mechanism that might help to explain the finding by Rogers et al. (2003) that the more occupied setts there were in a territory, the higher the TB index of the group, assuming a correlation between occupancy rates and frequency of outlier use by individual badgers. It is also consistent with previous observations that badgers infected with M. bovis ranged more widely than apparently uninfected individuals (Garnett et al. 2005) . While bTB status was inferred from a combination of imperfect diagnostic tests (see Supplementary Material for further discussion), they are nonetheless the most sensitive tests currently available for identifying established infection with M. bovis in a live animal . Furthermore, the tests are of high specificity and, crucially, the rate of false negatives would not have been expected to vary according to the degree to which individuals used main or outlier setts.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1330, "end": 1358, "text": "(Barber and Dingemanse 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1620, "end": 1640, "text": "Rogers et al.

There may be a link between ranging more widely and the frequent use of outlier setts, which may also result in an increased risk of exposure to infectious agents. Also, setts themselves may be a source of infection, the constant temperature, darkness and high humidity characteristic of badger setts being conducive to the prolonged survival of M. bovis (Jackson et al. 1995) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 681, "end": 702, "text": "(Jackson et al. 1995)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A number of studies of other species have reported that bolder animals that elicited a greater number of encounters with con-specifics were more likely to be infected by parasites and diseases than timid individuals (e.g. Natoli et al. 2005; Easterbrook et al. 2007; Boyer et al. 2010 ). Using repeatability measures developed by Nakagawa and Schielzeth (2010) , we found that those animals that used outlier setts more frequently relative to other individuals in one season were more likely to do the same in the following season (relative to other individuals). There may also be other individual-level factors that influence the probability of infection; for example, in vertebrates, immune system functioning (and its effectiveness) depends on the innate availability of particular major histocompatibility alleles and also previous exposure to parasites (Woelfing et al. 2009; Sin et al. 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 222, "end": 241, "text": "Natoli et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 242, "end": 266, "text": "Easterbrook et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 267, "end": 284, "text": "Boyer et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 330, "end": 360, "text": "Nakagawa and Schielzeth (2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 859, "end": 881, "text": "(Woelfing et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 882, "end": 898, "text": "Sin et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Parasite infection may result in animals being excluded from a group or spending more time in marginal areas if they are less able to compete for resources.

Anecdotal observations suggest that, in general, when badgers are diseased, injured or elderly they are more likely to exhibit 'unusual' behaviours with reports of them moving to outlier setts to die. In the present study, although animals that used outlier setts to a greater extent were more likely to be Stat-Pak positive (a correlate of progressed disease), they did not exhibit levels of bite wounds consistent with increased aggression from conspecifics.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 187, "text": "Cheeseman and Mallinson (1981)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Sett use was also shown to be influenced by an interaction between sex, age and season, which is consistent with other studies (e.g. Roper et al. 2001 ) and can in part be explained by reproductive behaviours. From February to May cubs are born and mothers are suckling dependent young (Woodroffe et al. 2005b) . During this time, females utilised the main sett to a greater extent than both sub-adult and adult males. The younger non-breeding females spent the similar amounts of time at the main sett as breeding R the estimate of repeatability, SE the standard error, CI the Bayesian credibility intervals, n the number of pair-wise comparisons females, but there is little evidence that badgers exhibit alloparental behaviours (but see Woodroffe 1993) or where it has been observed that it provides significant fitness benefits (Woodroffe and Macdonald 2000; Dugdale et al. 2010 ). Extra-group paternity among badgers is high (Carpenter et al. 2005; Dugdale et al. 2007) , and although atypical for group-living terrestrial carnivores, both male and female badgers may seek extra-group mating opportunities. Thus, the use of outlier setts by both sexes may be a symptom of spending more time at the edges and/or outside their resident territory. These results are consistent with mature males making forays into the territories of other social groups for mating opportunities in spring and females doing the same in autumn when they are not rearing young. All animals spent a greater proportion of time at the main sett in winter and markedly less time there in summer. In the colder months, nest chamber sharing in the main sett may confer thermoregulatory benefits (Kaneko et al. 2010) , while in the summer badgers may use outliers more often and frequently move between setts to prevent ecto-parasites such as fleas from accumulating in their bedding (Butler and Roper 1996; Roper et al. 2001; Stewart and Macdonald 2003) . Badgers in TB-endemic areas that frequently use outlier setts may have disproportionate epidemiological significance. Focusing effort on outlier setts, as well as main setts, might therefore expedite the objectives of any management intervention targeted at badger setts (e.g. vaccination and/or culling). If resources are limited, it may be cost-effective for the intervention to be targeted at main setts in autumn as a greater proportion of animals were found to be resident at main setts during this time (and still active unlike in winter), but in the case of an oral vaccine delivered in bait, this should be weighed against the benefits of targeting susceptible cubs when they first emerge from the setts in spring (Delahay et al. 2003) .
