The common causes includes sepsis, pneumonia, aspiration, etc. Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health problem in most of the developing world, and the epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome has resulted in a resurgence of TB the world over. Tuberculosis is a disease of protean manifestations with lungs being the most commonly involved site. Untreated pulmonary TB carries a mortality of 50% with the most common cause of death being extensive fibrocavitary disease and respiratory failure [2] . Tuberculosis can cause ARDS, and this usually occurs in the setting of disseminated disease such as miliary TB. There have been case reports and small case series describing association of ARDS and pulmonary TB [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] ; however, TB is rarely recognized as a cause of ARDS. In fact, in none of the recent reviews does TB figure in the list of ARDS [1, 8] . Despite being a public health problem of significant magnitude in India [2] , the largest series of TB and ARDS reported from India included only six cases of TB and ARDS over a 12-year period [4] . Although TB is a treatable illness, there has been a persistently high mortality (69-80%) in patients with severe pulmonary TB and acute respiratory failure [3, 6] . This is probably due to delayed recognition of the fact that TB can cause ARDS and acute respiratory failure [5] . Herein, we describe our experience with \"tuberculous ARDS\", and alert the clinicians that tuberculosis can cause ARDS and must figure in the differential diagnosis of \"cryptic\" ARDS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 149, "end": 152, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 663, "end": 666, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 880, "end": 883, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 884, "end": 886, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 887, "end": 889, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 890, "end": 892, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 893, "end": 895, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1025, "end": 1028, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1029, "end": 1031, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1109, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1227, "end": 1230, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1390, "end": 1393, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1394, "end": 1396, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1508, "end": 1511, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The records of patients admitted to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) with a diagnosis of ARDS between July 1997 to June 2004 were reviewed.

The probable reason for better outcome of tuberculous ARDS in this study could be that the diagnosis was suspected clinically, and anti-tubercular therapy was instituted empirically (median time to initiation being 3 days) based on clinical diagnosis. This can also account for the shorter duration of mechanical ventilation in our patients. Also delayed treatment is known to contribute to mortality in ICU patients with pulmonary TB and acute respiratory failure [5] . However, this conclusion has limitations in that we cannot exclude the possibility that the decreased mortality is due to a selection bias. Also the retrospective design of the study and small numbers makes it difficult to draw any firm conclusion.
