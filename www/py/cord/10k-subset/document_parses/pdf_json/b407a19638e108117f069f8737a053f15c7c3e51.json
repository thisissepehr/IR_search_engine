Several findings have confirmed that HMPV is an epidemic virus. First, HMPV occurred in regular winter and spring-summer outbreaks during the entire study period. Second, the infected children initially had high viral levels but a short viral shedding time. Finally, no asymptomatic controls had an HMPV-positive culture, although a few had low levels of HMPV as detected by PCR. On average, HMPV was detected in 7.3% of all children admitted with RTI during the whole period, but it varied considerably from only 2.6% to 12.4% per season. Most previous studies from countries in the Northern hemisphere measured the occurrence over shorter periods but found relative similar figures and seasonal variations [1, 3, 8, [13] [14] [15] . HMPV appeared mostly from January to April and regularly caused outbreaks lasting a median of 5 months, peaking in the winter months. Smaller outbreaks with a median duration of 2.5 months occurred during the spring and early summer months and coincided with a reduction in the total number of children admitted with RTIs. In addition, the occurrence of HMPV from January to March was quite similar in both odd and even years, in contrast to observations from southern Europe, with alternating epidemics in winter and spring-summer every other year [15, 34] . We speculate as to whether this difference may reflect the colder climate in our country compared with southern Europe [35] . RSV outbreaks occurred in every season, lasted an average of 5 months, and most often peaked in January to March.

Two European studies reported HMPV-related hospitalization rates comparable to ours. A study from Spain [23] , based on 3 seasons, reported that 2.6/1000 children <3 years old were hospitalized, and in a single-season study from the United Kingdom [22] the reported hospitalization rate was 1.3/1000 children <6 years old.

The hospitalization rates of children with RSV-related LRTI in our study were in line with findings from previous Norwegian [36] , European [37, 38] and American studies [39, 40] , thereby confirming that HMPV causes hospitalization less often than RSV in Europe and the United States.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 522, "end": 525, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 526, "end": 529, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 530, "end": 533, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 640, "end": 644, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 784, "end": 788, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 982, "end": 985, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 986, "end": 990, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 991, "end": 995, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 996, "end": 1000, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1001, "end": 1005, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1184, "end": 1188, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1200, "end": 1204, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1205, "end": 1208, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1230, "end": 1234, "text": "[39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1235, "end": 1238, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "To test the hypothesis that low detection rates and low levels of HMPV in healthy children may be a result of virus shedding after previous RTI, we first measured the rate of HMPV-positive samples among a group of asymptomatic children. A few percent had a positive PCR test with high Ct levels, thus corresponding to low viral loads, but all were virus negative by culture. We also studied a group of children with HMPV infection with repeated specimens sampled, who had low Ct values (high viral loads) and a high rate of positive cultures initially. During the progress of the disease, these children improved clinically, viral loads gradually decreased and all became virus negative by culture after 13 days. Despite these changes, half of the children were still virus positive by PCR test after 13 days and all were virus negative only after 28 days. Taken together, our observations and those of others [1, 30, 31, 41, 42] , suggest that a positive PCR test for HMPV in healthy children is unlikely to indicate an asymptomatic infection, and we speculate whether it instead indicates the presence of small amounts of viral nucleic acids after a previous HMPV infection. Others [41, 43] have demonstrated a 2-3-week-long shedding time in children with RSV infection, which, in a similar way may explain the low detection rate of RSV at low viral levels in the present study's controls. As indicated by the hospitalization rates, the incidence of severe HMPV infection, decreased by age. In addition, only 1% of previously healthy children were admitted with recurrent HMPV infections elicited by unknown or different HMPV subtypes. Previous research has shown that most children become seropositive during the first 5 years of life [44] , and data from experimental studies suggest that certain HMPV subtypes may not stimulate an adequate immune response in all cell types [45] . However, our clinical data indicate that healthy children usually develop a robust immunity against most HMPV subtypes during childhood. On the other hand, outside a hospital setting, others have shown that HMPV may still cause recurrent mild RTI in children [46] and adults [47] . Moreover, children [48] and adults [49] with impaired immunity may be prone to severe HMPV infections, even with a high seroprevalence at all ages [50] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 910, "end": 913, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 914, "end": 917, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 918, "end": 921, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 922, "end": 925, "text": "41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 926, "end": 929, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1184, "end": 1188, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1189, "end": 1192, "text": "43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1738, "end": 1742, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1879, "end": 1883, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2145, "end": 2149, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2161, "end": 2165, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2187, "end": 2191, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2203, "end": 2207, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2315, "end": 2319, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "It is a strength of the present population-based study that we prospectively enrolled children at all ages from the same county in mid-Norway, and to the only existing pediatric hospital in this region during a long period.
