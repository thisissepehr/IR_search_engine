The agent causing CCHF is a Nairovirus. The virus is typically transmitted to humans through tick bites. CCHF is a life-threatening disease observed endemically over a wide geographical regions in the world, and there is limited information about pulmonary findings in CCHF patients. Purpose We aimed to investigate the pulmonary findings belonging to a large CCHF patient cohort and to determine if there is any relationship between laboratory findings and disease severity. Materials and methods A total of 165 patients who were diagnosed with CCHF and examined through chest X-ray (CXR) due to respiratory symptoms at their first examination and/or during their hospitalization were included in this study. In addition to demographical and laboratory findings of the patients, chest X-rays were also examined. Results Of the 165 patients examined, 96 were male (58.2%) and 69 were female (41.8%). The mean age was 51.64 \u00b1 17.95 years (4-81 years). Single and/or multiple pathological findings were detected in 93 patients (56.4%) as a result of chest X-ray during their first examination. On chest X-ray, consolidation in 74 patients (44.8%), pleural effusion in 64 patients (39.8%), ground glass opacity in 49 patients (29.7%), and atelectasis in 30 patients (18.2%) were detected.

The number of patients with respiratory symptoms was much higher in our study than the number of patients in the other studies. The pathophysiological mechanism of pleural effusion has not been clearly demonstrated in CCHF. However, it has been stated that it can share similarities with mechanism of pulmonary pathologies such as pleural effusion, pneumonitis, hemoptysis, and alveolar hemorrhage in other febrile viral hemorrhagic diseases [15, 16] . It has been suggested that pulmonary findings emerge due to the increase in capillary permeability in febrile viral hemorrhagic diseases. Particularly, virus in the circulatory system causes an increase in pulmonary capillary permeability causing capillary endothelial damage [17] . In a study performed on dengue hemorrhagic fever, a total of 468 CXR taken from 363 patients were examined and parenchymal infiltration and pleural effusion were observed in more than half of the patients on the third day of follow-up. These findings were stated as the most frequent radiological findings. Moreover, these radiological findings were found to be closely related to laboratory findings of leukocyte count, platelet count, APTT, ALT, and albumin levels in the same study [18] . Similar to other febrile viral hemorrhagic diseases (in particular to dengue hemorrhagic fever), clinical conditions must be kept in mind in CCHF. Replacement therapy was also performed with blood and blood products in some patients with sudden decrease in hemoglobin values and with alveolar hemorrhage findings in our study. In conclusion, pleural effusion and other findings related to pulmonary involvement can be seen in CCHF due to endothelial damage caused by viral load in the circulation, increased capillary permeability, and hemorrhages due to low platelet.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 578, "end": 582, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 583, "end": 586, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 865, "end": 869, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1357, "end": 1361, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the study by Akta\u015f et al.
