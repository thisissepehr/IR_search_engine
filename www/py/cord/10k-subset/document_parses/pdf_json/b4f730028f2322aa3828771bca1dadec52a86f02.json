Therefore, our primary aim was to compare the concentration of L-lactate to the concentration of neutrophils in sputum and systemic markers of infection. Because it is difficult to differentiate viral and bacterial infection on the basis of clinical presentation in LRTI, our secondary aim was to evaluate if L-and D-lactate may serve as markers of local inflammation as representatives of neutrophils and bacteria, respectively. Methods -Patients with acute LRTI were prospectively recruited. Sputum samples were collected and analysed for neutrophil count, L-lactate and D-lactate. We had data on pathogens from sputum cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (atypical bacteria, virus) and C-reactive protein (CRP) from blood. Results -In 44 sputum samples from 32 patients, the median (interquartile range (IQR)) sputum neutrophil granulocyte count was 0.615 9 10 7 cells/mL (0.236-1.575). The sputum neutrophil granulocyte count was associated with sputum L-lactate (p = 0.011) and CRP (p = 0.018), but not with D-lactate (p = 0.177). There was a strong association between sputum D-lactate and L-lactate (p < 0.0001).

Sampling should preferably have been done before initiation of antibiotic treatment, as culture of common pathogens in LRTI (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae) is difficult after initiation. Thus, it is likely that some of the cultured samples from infected participants contained non-viable bacteria that could not be identified in the clinical laboratory and which potentially could have been found if a different PCR had been used.

This suggestion may be further verified by comparing to blood-derived biomarkers proposed to discriminate between bacterial and viral or non-bacterial LRTI such as procalcitonin (29) . As L-lactate is widely available to measure in laboratory settings, we recommend further studies to focus on the usefulness of this marker, and how it represents the invasion of leucocytes into the lungs. Furthermore, L-lactate should be evaluated as a marker to monitor treatment response directly in the lung, which may be more sensitive than systemic markers such as CRP. Finally, as patients admitted with LRTI often stop producing sputum early in the course of infection, L-lactate should be tested in patients who are intubated or having a tracheostomy, where routine
