We identified sequences of viruses that represented 30 viral families and taxonomically unclassified viruses. The vertebrate virus sequences detected most frequently represented gyroviruses (genus Gyrovirus, family Anelloviridae). Gyroviruses include chicken anemia virus (CAV) and several novel viruses (designated Gyrovirus 1 through Gyrovirus 4) identified in chickens and humans. 15, 16, 35 Domestic birds are the presumed hosts of gyroviruses, and CAV is ubiquitous in poultry. CAV sequences have been reported in 2% and 51% of human fecal specimens. [36] [37] [38] Chicken anemia virus can cause immunosuppression in chickens. There is no evidence that it can infect humans. Accordingly, we and others posit that the presence of CAV sequences in human feces is due to ingestion of CAV-infected poultry. [39] [40] [41] Although we did not identify a single virus as a candidate trigger for UC, we identified a higher prevalence of anellovirus sequences in feces of children with UC relative to IBS controls. Our results are similar to those reported by Norman et al, where an increase in anellovirus sequences was detected in patients with IBD. 6 To what extent anelloviruses can trigger or influence the course of human disease is unclear. Anelloviruses are ubiquitous in humans, although their exact prevalence is difficult to estimate because their extremely high sequence divergence impedes epidemiological surveys. 42 It is estimated that more than 90% of the human worldwide population is infected with at least 1 type of anellovirus. 42, 43 Although they have been detected in fluid and tissue samples representing a wide range of human diseases, they are also found in in healthy individuals. [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] Some studies suggest that anelloviruses may impact the severity of inflammation through the regulation of inflammatory cytokine homeostasis. It has been proposed that a higher prevalence of anelloviruses may alter the balance of proinflamatory cytokines and that anelloviruses may indirectly augment disease. 43 Further studies will be required to determine whether anelloviruses impact the course of UC. We enrolled UC patients at diagnosis and before treatment, avoiding potential confounding effects of therapy upon the stool virome. However, enrollment was limited to only 70 UC patients with moderate to severe disease activity. We do not know, therefore, whether our findings apply to those with mild disease. We do not have detailed dietary history on the UC subjects because their inclusion in PROTECT only began at their diagnostic colonoscopy. We recognize other limitations in our study. Adolescents with IBS-and not healthy children-were used as controls. Though there are no data suggesting alterations in stool virome in IBS, an altered microbiome has been reported in IBS. 50 We only analyzed stool specimens and not rectal biopsy tissue, potentially limiting viral detection. A potential limitation of our capture approach is that it is based on probes designed from viral sequences that have been deposited in Genbank. While we cannot exclude the possibility that yet uncharacterized viruses with extreme genetic diversity would escape detection, VirCapSeq-VERT can detect novel viruses with as little as 60% nucleotide identity to viruses present in the probe set. We also acknowledge that this pilot survey represents a limited sample set and is not a prospective full scale epidemiologic study. Nonetheless, our findings do not support a role of an active viral infection in the onset of UC and may shift the focus toward other potential infectious, genetic, or environmental triggers.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 594, "end": 597, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 598, "end": 601, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 602, "end": 604, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 766, "end": 770, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 771, "end": 775, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 776, "end": 780, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1019, "end": 1023, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1024, "end": 1028, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1029, "end": 1033, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1360, "end": 1361, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1635, "end": 1637, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1756, "end": 1759, "text": "42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1760, "end": 1762, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1916, "end": 1920, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1921, "end": 1925, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1926, "end": 1930, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1931, "end": 1935, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1936, "end": 1940, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1941, "end": 1945, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1946, "end": 1950, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2260, "end": 2262, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 3039, "end": 3041, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Supplementary data is available at Inflammatory Bowel Diseases online.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SUPPLEMENTARY DATA"}, {"text": "The authors wish to thank the PROTECT investigators, research coordinators, and patients and families for their help in completing this study.
