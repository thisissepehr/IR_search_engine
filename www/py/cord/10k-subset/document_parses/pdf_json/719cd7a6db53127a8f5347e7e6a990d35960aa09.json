            "text": "Purpose -There are many differences in how authorities handle the dead during mass death incidents involving disasters and pandemics. These differences would suggest that planning for a disaster death and planning for a pandemic death should be done separately. This may be true to some extent, however, there are many similarities between the two that this article will seeks to examine. The main objective of this study is to show that planning for both disasters and pandemics should either be done by a single entity that coordinates both types of responses, or by agencies that communicate closely and frequently. Design/methodology/approach -This study compared mass death incidents predominantly within the Canadian historical record, including disasters and pandemics. It took a specific look at the influenza pandemic of 1918 in North America and how the dead were handled. Findings -Both disasters and pandemics offer unique challenges in handling the dead and documenting the incident. In a pandemic the cause of death is usually clear, while in a disaster it is not always understood. However, the similarities they hold in common must not be overlooked. They will involve immense and complicated amounts of paperwork, cause a shortage of supplies (be it medical, food or otherwise) and create the need for assistance. Originality/value -The research finds that though disasters and pandemics are often handled differently by the various agencies involved, they should be treated alike and dealt with in the same manner.",

            "text": "However, while there are major differences between disaster mass death and pandemic mass death, a closer look at the two suggests there are also many parallels. Both pandemics and disasters can lead to problems of locating and collecting the dead. Both can lead to identification issues. Both require paperwork as death is recorded and certified. Both can lead to shortages of facilities and personnel: even finding enough persons to dig graves can be an issue. Both require decisions about whether there should be mass graves. Both can have a widespread impact, making it difficult for communities to assist each other. Both can impact emergency personnel. These similarities suggest planning for both should be done if not by a single entity, then at least in parallel. While this article draws substantially on Canadian material, it includes examples from the USA to show that the issues there are much the same. The limited material available from UK sources suggests that this would also be true for the UK. In short, if Canada, the USA or the UK experience a repeat of the 1918-1920 pandemic there will be problems dealing with the dead, many of them comparable to what happens after a major mass death disaster. Planners should keep that in mind.",

Instead of bodies being at an easily controllable site, they are often spread over a wide area. Instead of being left in place until they are photographed and data about them is recorded, they are often collected by ordinary persons and taken to public locations such as schools, police stations, churches and recreational facilities. That happened in Darwin (Australia) after a cyclone, in Rapid City (South Dakota) after a flood, and in Kobe ( Japan) after an earthquake (Hershiser, 1974; Scanlon, 1979; Nishimura 1997a, b, c) . However, that DPM 20,2 research also suggests that once that initial response is over, the handling of the dead is taken over by law enforcement and forensic professionals and those who knew the dead are excluded until the dead are identified. Only then are the bodies released so their families can carry out whatever rites they wish. That is exactly what happened in Thailand after the Indian Ocean tsunami: the bodies were collected and laid out in rows on the grounds of temples but gradually they were taken under control by foreign police and forensic scientists operating with the permission of the Thai government (Scanlon, 2006b) . Only after they were formally identified were they released to relatives.",

In Sri Lanka, for example, after the tsunami, the mosques used their public address systems to warn that unless people quickly identified a body, it would be buried in a mass grave. One reason for this was a conviction -though incorrect -that bodies constituted a disease threat. In Indonesia, where there were thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands dead, there were hasty efforts to identify some dead before most were buried in mass graves. In Canada, as recently as Hurricane Hazel, which struck the Toronto area in 1954, bodies were collected by volunteers, and identified by those who knew them or said they knew them.

Here, behind the partition, we had three rows of bodies, men, women, and children in order of age. Each body was covered with a blanket (Kennedy, 1976, pp. 125-6) .",

Because only one relatively intact body was recovered after the crash of Swissair 111, the passengers and crew were identified using various forensic techniques; but when the oil rig Ocean Ranger, an American-flagged vessel, capsized in the Atlantic off Newfoundland, since most bodies were intact, the identities were confirmed by persons who knew the dead and by personal effects on the bodies[2].

More specifically, there is a wide range of books, chapters, articles and papers about what happened in Canada during the 1918-1920 influenza pandemic (important Canadian works include Andrews, 1977; Bacic, 1999; Belyk and Belyk, 1988; Herring, 1994; Herring and Sattenspiel, 2003; Humphries, 2005; Johnson, 1997; Jones, 2002 Jones, , 2005 Jones, , 2006 Jones, , 2007 Keer, 1994; Kelm, 1999; Lux, 1997; MacDougall, 1986 MacDougall, , 2007 McGinnis, 1976 McGinnis, , 1981 O'Keefe and MacDonald, 2004; Palmer et al., 2007; Pettigrew, 1983; Phillips, 2004; Quiney, 2002) [3]. This literature continues to expand: Johnson, whose early research was done in Kitchener, Ontario, recently produced a book on the British experience in 1918-1920 based on his doctoral dissertation at Cambridge (Johnson, 2006) . Despite this extensive and growing literature, there is still nothing focusing on pandemic death [4] . Nevertheless, accounts dating back to the seventeenth century show that dealing with the dead has always been a major problem in pandemics. Miquel Parets (1991) , writing about the plague that struck Barcelona in 1665, vividly describes the collection of bodies:",

For example, while identification is usually a problem in a disaster and rarely a concern in a pandemic, there have been identification issues in a pandemic. In Drumheller, Alberta, for example, in 1918, the local druggist was asked to figure out who had died and where their bodies had been taken after the pandemic subsided: It was an impossible task. Although the patients' names had been attached to their beds when they were brought in, many of them had got up and wandered in their delirium. Sometimes they fell into someone else's bed with a name tag on it, and if they died there, no one knew who they were (Pettigrew, 1983, p. 98 ).",

But morgues have also been set up in armories, unused hangars at airports and military bases, hockey rinks, school basements, a town hall, a movie theatre, an empty store, a pizza parlor or a church hall. Bodies have also been taken to a church hall (Molly Corbett Beaton Institute, n.d.). In 1916, after forest fires killed hundreds of persons in Northern Ontario, one small morgue was set up at McNabb's funeral home in Cobalt. The main morgue was in Matheson, where two tents were used to handle bodies. There were piles of coffins beside the tents, some labeled \"full\" and others labelled \"empty\". Soldiers collected bodies of humans and horses and brought the human bodies to the tent morgues (The Daily Nugget, 1916 ).

Various city departments, including the House of Detention, sent men to cemeteries and they, plus volunteers, did the job. The Bureau of Highways offered a steam shovel to dig trenches in Potter's Field for the burial of the poor and friendless. Such was the confusion and the speed with which the dead were thrust into the ground that it was apparent that there would be some, perhaps many, cases in which relatives would want to move their dead to family plots or even to other cemeteries, so the bodies were tagged for identification if they should later be disinterred (Crosby, 1989, p. 83 ). Johnson (2006) notes precisely the same problems in the UK during the 1918-1920 pandemic: [. . .] a massive strain on the economies, on families, on medical personnel and facilities, and even on cemeteries and morgues. The funeral industry showed the strain as many towns ran out of coffins and coffin makers, grave diggers and others were put on extended hours, while cemeteries opened for longer hours (p. 206).",

In a pandemic, the impacts -and the problems of dealing with the dead -are usually spread over wide areas, perhaps over much of the world. That makes it difficult for one community, one region or one country to provide assistance to another. While that is less common in a disaster, it can happen. During the 1998 Eastern Ontario ice storm, 65 communities declared a state of emergency at the same time (Scanlon, 1999) . That made mutual aid difficult to impossible and made it very difficult for the provincial government to provide effective support. Not surprisingly the Regional Municipality of Ottawa Carleton called upon the Army to assist. There were similar problems during an earlier ice storm that struck the area around Rochester, New York. Similarly, while it is true that pandemics are more likely to impact emergency personnel than disasters that is not always the case. When the munitions ship exploded in Halifax in 1917, it killed all the senior officers of the fire department and injured so many soldiers and soldiers' families that the military was unable to respond for some time to the needs of the civilian population.",

Given those criteria, the tsunami was a close to a worst-case scenario. There was no list. There were hundreds of thousands of bodies. They were recovered very quickly. The only positive was that most bodies were in good condition. Brondolo's model was developed as a result of his experience with a terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and an air crash, not a pandemic. But a look at the 1918-1920 pandemics suggests the same criteria could apply and the results would be similar to the tsunami. In 1918-1920, there was no list of the dead. Bodies were recovered very quickly. The numbers were not necessarily that large on a local basis but the overall totals were overwhelming. And, once again, just as after the tsunami the bodies tended to be in good condition.",

However, it is also clear that there are often many similarities between both types of mass death. There may well be problems in locating and collecting the dead.
