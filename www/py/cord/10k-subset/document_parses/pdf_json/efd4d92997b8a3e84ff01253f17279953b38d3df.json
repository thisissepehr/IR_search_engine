Mothers may have been misclassified if vaccinated at alternative locations (eg, pharmacies, workplaces), but we believe it likely that any exposure misclassification was nondifferential. Recent CDC data on 2009-2010 influenza season vaccine uptake among pregnant women showed that they were significantly more likely to be vaccinated at the recommendation of their medical provider. Further, vaccine coverage in our study population was higher than 2009-2010 state vaccine coverage estimates for Georgia and Maryland [35] . Moreover, underestimation of coverage was likely to result in conservative OR estimates due to nondifferential misclassification of vaccine exposure.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 696, "end": 700, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "We conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate the effect of defining vaccination during pregnancy as between LMP and infant's date of birth.
