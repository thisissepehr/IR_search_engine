Novel approaches in the life science like the One Health paradigm require integrated methodologies in order to link and connect heterogeneous information from databases and literature resources. Current publications in the life sciences are increasingly characterized by the employment of trans-disciplinary methodologies comprising molecular and cell biology, genetics, genomic, epigenomic, transcriptional and proteomic high throughput technologies with data from humans, plants, and animals. The literature search engine LIVIVO empowers retrieval functionality by incorporating various literature resources from medicine, health, environment, agriculture and nutrition. LIVIVO is developed in-house by ZB MED -Information Centre for Life Sciences. It provides a userfriendly and usability-tested search interface with a corpus of 55 Million citations derived from 50 databases. Standardized application programming interfaces are available for data export and high throughput retrieval. The search functions allow for semantic retrieval with filtering options based on life science entities. The service oriented architecture of LIVIVO uses four different implementation layers to deliver search services. A Knowledge Environment is developed by ZB MED to deal with the heterogeneity of data as an integrative approach to model, store, and link semantic concepts within literature resources and databases.",

As a results, many researchers are forced to rely on the few databases licensed by their institution or library, or they need to rely on free but limited sources such as PubMed and Google Scholar, restricting their literature search results to only a fraction of the relevant literature available. ZB MED -Information Centre for Life Sciences is a non-profit organization with the mission to supply specialized literature in the life sciences at a national and an international level. ZB MED hosts the largest stock of life science literature in Europe while offering specialized search portals for literature search in life sciences.

In order to increase the precision of search queries, results are automatically analyzed and enhanced with descriptors providing semantic structure for fine-tuning the query. For this purpose, three multilingual life science thesauri are used (MeSH, UMTHES and AGROVOC). These are also used for subject indexing of the meta-data listed in LIVIVO, enhancing the content-based indexing of the original data. Index terms can later be used in the portal for refining the precision of the search. For example, a query for the German term Antibiotika-Resistenz is connected to the thesauri automatically finding documents with the terms Antimicrobial drug resistance and antibiotic / antimicrobial resistance.

In several cases, costumers are interested in using the search service of LIVIVO as a data driven service without any functionality of the web portal. Therefore, a high-performance, standardized and automated interface is available as encapsulated service, namely a Z39:50-and SRU interface. This encapsulated service is docked on the same layer as the web interface and the portal software in the service oriented architecture. This datadriven service features almost the complete functionality for searching and filtering queries as the web portal. The option to make use of LIVIVO's search capacities without using the web portal creates novel user scenarios. Examples of the novel user scenarios are the integration of LIVIVO as a discovery service into existing portal solutions. Another example is the integration into literature management systems such as EndNote 11 , RefWorks 12 , and Citavi 13 .",

            "text": "In order to realize the One Health paradigm, it is necessary to connect and interlink interdisciplinary knowledge domains by resolving the heterogeneous properties of data and information in databases and literature resources. In the domain of life sciences, the different knowledge layers have to be modeled by different entities, processes, and relationships for achieving an integrated knowledge environment [5] . Entities and their interactions are represented by processes with their relationships. The representation requires different views that depend on the respective domain. The domain context of pharmaceutical compounds interacting with patient groups needs a different environment for representing the knowledge than cellular processes of interacting cellular components. Hence, the ZB MED Knowledge Environment (ZB MED KE) is introduced in order to provide a general and persistent data layer for being able to model, store, and link semantic concepts within literature resources and databases of the life science domain. The ZB MED KE enables data curation, data enrichment, quality assurance, and export into the LIVIVO search database. The data enrichment of the literature resources is conducted with the annotation of life science concepts as standoff annotations in document texts. The semantic enrichment is prototypically implemented using a UIMA 14 mining workflow which also preserves the relational properties of the semantic concepts using a Neo4j 15 -based graph database [8] . The ZB MED KE is visualized in Fig. 2 . There are several stages of expansion for the ZB MED KE involving natural language processing and ontology mapping.",

In literature retrieval, the specificity of a knowledge resource for a specific domain is getting blurred by the overlay of generic concepts. There, specific concepts that represent the highest granularity of retrieved information are perturbed because of the high frequency of generic concepts [9] . Therefore, a mapping amongst the various knowledge resources has to be achieved in order to link common and generic concepts for the purpose of emphasizing highly specific concepts for the respective knowledge domain. This is required to improve the user experience in literature retrieval by providing a better resolution of semantic concepts that are used for query expansion, aggregation of search results, and concept based ranking methods. The standard scoring method is the fraction of term frequency and inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). TF-IDF is used for normalizing search results of matching terms according to the frequency of the terms in the complete corpus. In case of domain specific concepts, similar ranking function are derived as fraction of the concept frequency and the inverse document frequency (CF-IDF) [4] . The CF-IDF poses novel challenges compared to TF-IDF because concepts usually comprise spelling variants, synonyms, or even abbreviations because they have a large impact on the accuracy of the relevancy ranking.

Therefore, current work on LIVIVO focuses on the development of linguistic approaches for named entity recognition and named entity disambiguation. These approaches are highly dependent on the syntax, the semantics, and the life science context. Ambiguous abbreviations and acronyms are frequently used in the life sciences [14] . Methodologies like Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging can support the correct identification in the process of natural language processing. Furthermore, LIVIVO needs to deal with the detection of redundant content. Redundant content occurs, as LIVIVO compiles a variety of data sources which contain in part reciprocally or even intrinsically redundant content. Redundant content occurs when the same publication has multiple records in the literature resources. From the user's perspective, these occurrences should not be regarded as different citations. Redundancy may emerge in the LIVIVO data base at different levels that requires filtering in multiple steps. The identification of redundancies will include the disambiguation of document identifiers, type, and authors.",
