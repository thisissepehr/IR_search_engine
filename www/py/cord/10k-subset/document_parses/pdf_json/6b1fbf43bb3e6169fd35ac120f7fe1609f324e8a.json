When the infections were further analyzed by the specific virus involved, RSV proved to be much the most virulent of the agents identified. RSV infection was accompanied by pneumonia in 13 children and by wheezing, often severe, in 24. Influenza A virus, o n the other hand, appeared to infect without producing any lower airway obstructive symptoms, and other respiratory viruses were intermediate in virulence between these two. Because of the selective pathogenicity of RSV in young asthmatic children, we considered that studies directed toward prevention of infection by this virus were warranted. When live attenuated RSV vaccines were developed (4, 6 , 14, 15) and began t o show promise in young normal children (8, 9) , we undertook trials of these vaccines among hospitalized children at NJH under carefully controlled conditions. At the time our tests were done the vaccines had been shown by Kim et al. (8, 9) t o produce asymptomatic infections in most children with pre-existing serum neutralizing antibody t o RSV, and mild, usually upper, respiratory symptoms in children without antibody. The purposes of our studies were several fold. Because the pathogenesis of wheezing with natural RSV infection in young asthmatic children is unexplained, it was possible that a live attenuated vaccine would be fully as virulent as natural infection in these subjects. The studies were, therefore, designed in part t o answer the question of whether, in carefully conducted trials in progressively younger subjects, infection with an \"attenuated\" strain of RSV would be associated with wheezing in an asthmatic child.
