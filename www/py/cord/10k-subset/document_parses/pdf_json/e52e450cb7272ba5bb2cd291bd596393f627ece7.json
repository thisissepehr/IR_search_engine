The B. aryabhattai strain produced 2.8 g/L PHBV, equivalent to 71.15% of cell dry mass in a medium supplemented with propionic acid, after 48 h incubation. The optimum temperature and pH for the copolymer accumulation was 31 \u00b0C and 7, respectively. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses confirmed the polymer obtained as PHBV. The differential scanning calorimetry analysis revealed that the melting point of the material as 90 \u00b0C and its thermal stability up to 220 \u00b0C. The average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index of the sample was estimated by gel permeation chromatography analysis and observed as 128.508 kDa and 2.82, respectively. The PHBV showed tensile strength of 10.3 MPa and elongation at break of 13.3%. The PHBV and their blends with PEG were tested for cytotoxicity on human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) and the cells incubated with PHBV/PEG2kDa blends were 99% viable, whereas with the PHBV alone showed comparatively higher cytotoxicity.

Owing to their biodegradability and physical properties similar to most of the synthetic plastics, PHAs are considered as a green substitute for petroleum-derived plastics. Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is the first discovered, most common and simplest form of PHA found in bacteria (Lemoigne 1926) . The inferior physical properties of PHB such as brittleness, high crystallinity and instability during the melting stage hinder their wide-spread applications ). The copolymer of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) and 3-hydroxyvalerate (3-HV), namely poly(3hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) is synthesized in bacteria especially when the growth medium contains organic acids .

Therefore, when propionic acid is supplemented in the culture medium constituted for PHB production, it acts as a direct precursor that triggers the formation of 3-HV, in addition to 3-HB.

Among these polymers, PEG lacks toxicity, antigenicity and consequently does not induce any immunogenicity on human cells. Hence PEG has been commonly applied in a wide range of therapeutic formulations, and it will be eliminated from the body through kidneys (Catoni et al. 2013) . The blending of PHAs with PEG improves the surface hydrophilicity of the polymer; thereby increases the cell viability and it has been reported to be effective in improving the biocompatibility of PHBV (Shabna et al. 2014; Monnier et al. 2016) .

The PHB accumulation study in this strain (Pillai et al. 2017a ) and the reports on PHBV accumulation in other Bacillus spp. suggested the optimum incubation period of 48 h for maximum polymer yield (G\u00fcng\u00f6rmedi et al. 2014; Moorkoth and Nampoothiri 2016) and hence the incubation period was set as 48 h in all the shake flask experiments. The GC-MS analysis revealed the monomer composition of the obtained polymer. The main peaks were corresponding to 3-hydroxybutyric acid methyl ester, pentadecanoic acid methyl ester and hexadecanoic acid methyl ester. The 3-hydroxybutyric acid methyl ester is the monomer methyl ester of 3-HB, whereas the pentadecanoic acid methyl ester and the hexadecanoic acid methyl ester are the trimer and tetramer methyl esters of 3-HV and 3-HB respectively (Bhuwal et al. 2014) . These oligomers might have been formed as a result of incomplete digestion of the polymer sample during the methanolysis. The chromatogram of PHBV standard also showed the methyl esters of 3-hydroxybutyric acid and pentadecanoic acid. These observations confirmed the obtained polymer as PHBV. The 1 H NMR analysis demonstrated the resonances for the methyl group (-CH 3 ), methylene group (-CH 2 -) and methine group (-CH-) from both the 3-HB and 3-HV monomer units. The 13 C NMR spectrum provided the signals for the methyl (-CH 3 ) groups, methylene (-CH 2 -) groups, ester (-O-CH-) groups and carbonyl carbon (-C-) atoms from the 3-HB and 3-HV monomers. The chemical shift signals were in agreement with the previous findings of Abd-El-Haleem (2009) and Aramvash et al. (2016) which again confirmed that the polymer obtained from the B. aryabhattai was PHBV.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 164, "end": 188, "text": "(Pillai et al. 2017a, b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 341, "end": 365, "text": "(G\u00fcng\u00f6rmedi et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 366, "end": 396, "text": "Moorkoth and Nampoothiri 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 489, "end": 510, "text": "(Pillai et al. 2017a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 816, "end": 835, "text": "Kumar et al.
