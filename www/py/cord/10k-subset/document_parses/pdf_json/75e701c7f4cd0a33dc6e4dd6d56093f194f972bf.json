Recessive CLPP mutations were recently observed in the human Perrault variant of ovarian failure and sensorineural hearing loss. Here, a first characterization of CLPP null mice demonstrated complete female and male infertility and auditory deficits. Disrupted spermatogenesis already at the spermatid stage and ovarian follicular differentiation failure were evident. Reduced pre-/post-natal survival and marked ubiquitous growth retardation contrasted with only light impairment of movement and respiratory activities. Interestingly, the mice showed resistance to ulcerative dermatitis. Systematic expression studies detected up-regulation of other mitochondrial chaperones, accumulation of CLPX and mtDNA as well as inflammatory factors throughout tissues.

These two enzymes show high phylogenetic conservation, but their complementary roles are not understood. Mitochondrial LONP1 contains domains with protease and ATPase activity on the same polypeptide, and is considered as the main factor for proteolysis of soluble substrates in the matrix compartment. Furthermore, mutant LON/PIM1 yeast strains also exhibit defects in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (2) . In contrast, mitochondrial CLPP lacks ATPase activity and each subunit contains only the domain for digestion of small peptides without ATP requirement. Through association with the ATPase and chaperone CLPX, activation of CLPP as serine protease occurs for the ATP-dependent digestion of larger proteins (2) . Both CLPP and CLPX have been studied intensively in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and other prokaryotes (3) . Purification and structural biology studies showed that hexameric rings of the ATPase CLPX or specific other AAA+ (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) proteins of the HSP100 family (CLPA, CLPC) (4,5) depend on ATP in order to bind two heptameric CLPP rings at either end, thus forming a barrel-shaped CLPP proteolytic chamber. Unfolded substrates are translocated by CLPX into this cylinder to be cleaved in fragments with an average product length of 10 residues. These products are further degraded to free amino acids by exopeptidases (3) . CLPX determines substrate specificity of the complex. CLPX was found to recognize specific unstructured peptide sequences and usually unfold the corresponding proteins. The unstructured domains are named degrons, such as the C-motif 1/ssrA tag (6) . Degrons are thought to be exposed, e.g. in nascent peptides on stalled ribosomes, as well as in unassembled subunits of ribosomes and other macromolecular complexes (3) . Several specific degrons were characterized in detail. Individual repair proteins like RecN are synthesized at high levels during cell stress, but efficiently removed by the CLPXP protein complex upon return to the unstressed state, to avoid deleterious effects (7, 8) . Similarly, a degron in sigmaS, the master regulator of general stress response in E. coli, is responsible for CLPXP recognition and degradation in growing cells (9) . With a slightly different mechanism, the degron in RseA ensures its degradation by CLPXP in times of cell stress, thus derepressing the sigmaE factor to induce genes responsible for the envelope stress response (10) . Interestingly, CLPXP-mediated degradation of the bacteriophage repressor and of the O protein as an initiator of phage DNA replication (11, 12) vary with growth conditions and thus modulate the bacteriophage lysis-versuslysogenization decisions, i.e. bacterial immunity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 152, "end": 155, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 554, "end": 557, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 865, "end": 868, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 972, "end": 975, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1533, "end": 1536, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1783, "end": 1786, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1954, "end": 1957, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2222, "end": 2225, "text": "(7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2226, "end": 2228, "text": "8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2392, "end": 2395, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2609, "end": 2613, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2751, "end": 2755, "text": "(11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2756, "end": 2759, "text": "12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Eukaryotic cells contain CLPP and CLPX orthologs in the mitochondrial matrix.

Mouse embryonal stem cells with insertions of the genetrap construct within the Clpp gene were commercially available from the Texas Institute for Genomic Medicine (TIGM). Embryonal stem cell lines IST11134F10 (line F) and IST13563G11 (line G) with GeneTrap insertions in heterozygous state at Clpp intron 1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 1A) , were obtained and a reduction in Clpp transcript levels to 50% was demonstrated by real-time RT -PCR (data not shown).

Almost complete absence of Clpp transcripts due to the GeneTrap insertion was observed in all tissues studied from Clpp 2/2 animals (Fig. 1B) .

The relevance of additional bands with CLPX immunoreactivity cannot be interpreted in absence of a CLPX-knock-out tissue, but it is important to note that two isoforms of Clpx mRNA were previously described in testis (40) . Similar amounts and parallel regulation of CLPP and CLPX would be expected in view of their cooperative functions and of previous proteomic data reporting similar intermediate levels in 14 mouse tissues (41) , but previous reports on Clpp mRNA showed the levels to vary between tissues (39, 40, 42) .

To study assembly/stability of Clpp 2/2 OXPHOS complexes and supercomplexes, heart muscle, liver and brain mitochondria were analyzed by blue native electrophoresis. Mitochondrial complexes in Clpp 2/2 brain appeared normal (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4D , left lanes), while a decrease in respiratory supercomplexes was observed in the heart and the liver (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4D , central and right lanes). Heme stain for complex IV revealed 60% residual monomeric complex IV in mutant liver mitochondria as measured by densitometry (data not shown).

However, obvious structural pathology of mitochondria was not observed. Thus, the absence of CLPP leads to abortion of spermatogenesis at an early stage before spermatid generation. Similarly, in Clpp 2/2 ovaries the follicular granulosa cell layers appeared reduced, with a higher amount of apoptotic bodies in comparison with matched controls (Fig. 3C) . Overall, the size of ovaries and the ratio of corpora lutea versus follicles before rupture were reduced for Clpp 2/2 , suggesting impaired oogenesis and a disrupted ovarian cycle (Fig. 3D ). These findings appeared to be a quite faithful model of human ovarian failure due to the recently discovered Clpp missense and splice site mutations (22) and provide mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of this variant of human Perrault syndrome, where streak ovaries with few scattered follicles had previously been described (49, 50) .

A recent publication reported CLPP missense and splice site mutations (22) in Perrault syndrome, but CLPP mutations were not yet linked to male infertility and lack of sperm. Possibly the phenotype in Testis, heart, liver and brain protein levels documented by quantitative immunoblots with densitometry were analyzed with Student's t-test for significant differences, and the linear fold-change and the P-value were represented in this overview (n \u00bc 3 versus 3, mouse age 5 months). Significant up-regulations are highlighted in red, significant down-regulations in green. ns, non-significant; nd, non-detectable. mice varies from human, but it is also conceivable that the murine CLPP null mutation has a stronger fertility phenotype than the human CLPP missense/splice site mutations, which may cause only partial CLPP activity loss. Thus, it will be important to screen male patients with a syndrome of azoospermia, short stature and neural dysfunction for CLPP mutations. Conversely, it will be important to conduct systematic screening of the auditory deficit in Clpp 2/2 mice assessing the affected tissue also with histology and molecular profiling. It is well known that auditory nerves are exceptionally sensitive to mitochondrial dysfunction, e.g. to altered import of mtRNA (88, 89) . Beyond the severe gonad-and audition-specific pathologies, CLPP absence caused five marked effects that were ubiquitous. First, the accumulation of CLPX; second, the up-regulation of mitochondrial matrix chaperones; third, the elevated levels of mtDNA; fourth, the induction of an inflammatory signature and finally, the growth retardation affecting all tissues. Therefore, it is important to consider what the likely causal chain of events between these findings could be. Our data show that the absence of CLPP leads to CLPX accumulation in spite of downregulated Clpx transcript levels. The likeliest explanation is that CLPX degradation is reduced and depends on CLPP, and that the pathologically increased CLPX protein levels are insufficiently compensated by decreased transcript levels. In contrast, the elevated levels of other mitochondrial matrix chaperones through transcriptional up-regulation might constitute the crucial compensatory effort which prevents earlier pathology in tissues like the brain. The elevated CLPX levels may be responsible for mtDNA accumulation, since a recent report showed CLPX to act not only as chaperone for unfolded proteins, but to be also important for the condensation of mtDNA, similar to TFAM (56). It is well established that the elimination of mitochondrial number as well as mtDNA reaches its physiological maximum during the maturation of germ cells. During spermatogenesis, the number of mtDNA nucleoids should be reduced from 10 000 or 1000 copies per cell to 100 copies per spermatozoon. During oogenesis, mitochondrial number would decrease while going through a quality control bottleneck, before expanding to 100 000 copies per oocyte (90, 91) . Therefore the selective and strong testis and ovary pathology in the CLPP null mice might be due to the pathological accumulation of CLPX and mtDNA. While depletion of mtDNA has been described as a consequence of mutations in numerous genes (92) , a strong accumulation as in CLPP null tissue has not been documented previously. Our data establish CLPP as a modifier factor for the reduction of mtDNA levels.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 188, "end": 192, "text": "(86)", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 343, "end": 347, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1559, "end": 1563, "text": "(88,", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 1564, "end": 1567, "text": "89)", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 3263, "end": 3267, "text": "(90,", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 3268, "end": 3271, "text": "91)", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 3515, "end": 3519, "text": "(92)", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The CLPP effect on inflammation and infection defense factors could be interpreted in the light of two observations made in prokaryotes.

Thus, in spite of the vast differences the bacterial and eukaryotic immune defense systems, CLPP deficiency might modulate antiviral defense. In this case, a novel functional parallel between the mitochondrial CLPXP machinery and the cytosolic proteasome would become apparent, since the latter is well known to respond to infections and inflammations via interferon-gamma exposure by adapting its composition and proteolysis pattern, thus serving as immunoproteasome (95) . Thus, although our mice were bred and aged in individually ventilated cages, with the absence of pathogenic infections being documented in regular health screens, we cannot exclude an undetected viral exposure of some mice that might explain our data partially. However, the transcriptome analyses documented a genotype-dependent elevation of immunity factors in every one of several mice and tissues, and the cellular analyses of splenocytes in independent animals confirmed this genotype-dependent effect. Furthermore, almost all mice in both Clpp 2/2 lines across their lifespan showed resistance against ulcerative dermatitis. This skin condition is typical of murine C57BL/6 substrains during aging, does not respond to antibiotic or corticosteroid treatment, and is thought to arise from pruritus due to follicular dystrophy, with later bacterial superinfections by skin commensals (44, 96) . This general reduction of vulnerability of Clpp 2/2 animals toward an inflammatory disease is a strong argument that the CLPP effect on immunity occurs irrespective of infections. Mitochondrial damage can by itself lead to inflammatory responses of the host cells. Our data demonstrate that Clpp 2/2 deletion leads not only to the induction of mitochondrial chaperones, but also to transcriptional up-regulation of proteasome subunits and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis factors, suggesting that non-degraded CLPP substrates are released from mitochondria to the eukaryotic cytosol. This appears possible, since C. elegans CLPP was shown to modulate the peptide efflux from isolated mitochondria (18) and since retrograde export even of T cell subsets analyzed for their expression of CD25/CD44/CD62L/Ly6C also showed several significant changes. Statistical analysis was done by using SPICE (117) . Significance (alpha \u00bc 5%) in Student's t-test is indicated by +, significance in the Wilcoxon rank test by #. entire proteins across the mitochondrial membrane pore is possible (97) . Eukaryotic cells recognize the appearance of microbial fragments by specific receptors for the typical formylated amino acids and hypomethylated CpG dinucleotides, eliciting responses of innate immunity against such PAMPs (pathogenassociated molecular patterns) (52) (53) (54) (55) . Similarly, LC3B-deficient mice with impaired autophagic degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria and subsequent accumulation of mtDNA in the cytosol were recently demonstrated to have significantly higher secretion of interleukins IL-1beta and IL-18 (98) . Thus, we speculate that eukaryotic tolerance to mitochondria is challenged intrinsically in Clpp 2/2 animals by exposure to accumulating mtDNA and to the release of formylated amino acids.

Resulting mitochondrial dysfunction leads only to light bioenergetic deficits, is particularly well compensated for in brain, but is detectable in the muscle and the liver. In contrast, Clpp deletion leads to marked ubiquitous up-regulations in the levels of several mitochondrial matrix chaperones and of various inflammatory factors. At the cellular level, T-cell activation is observed in the spleen, while selective apoptosis occurs among spermatids and follicular granulosa cells. Histological findings were massive in the testis and the ovary with macroscopic tissue shrinkage. At the organism level, the presence of CLPP is a prerequisite for female and male fertility, corroborating the recent implication of CLPP in human Perrault syndrome. Additional age-associated phenotypes are apparent with severe growth retardation, as well as reductions of spontaneous activity and survival, contrasting with resistance to ulcerative dermatitis.

(B) Acoustic startle tests showed absent locomotor responses to millisecond 120 dB burst noises in Clpp 2/2 F mice at ages 12-18 months (n \u00bc 5 versus 5). Similarly significant observations were made in aged Clpp 2/2 G mice and at 115 dB (data not shown). (C) Skin pathology during a defined aging period is common in mice with C57BL/6 background and was evaluated in a one-time effort for all mice housed in cages with reported cases. Twenty Clpp 2/2 mice (11 F line, 9 G line) and 25 matched WT controls (17 for F, 8 for G) were scored as affected by alopecia, or as affected by ulcerative dermatitis (with skin lacerations and bleeding wounds) or as unaffected. Alopecia showed similar frequencies (F line 7 WT versus 8 Clpp 2/2 mice, G line 1 WT versus 1 Clpp 2/2 ), but ulcerative dermatitis exhibited significantly (P \u00bc 0.03) reduced frequencies inClpp 2/2 versus WT mice (F line 4 WT versus 0 Clpp 2/2 mice, G line 5 WT versus 1 Clpp 2/2 ).
