They are globally widespread, infecting a large variety of terrestrial animals, birds, insects and even fish. Moreover, they are capable of surviving and circulating in both sylvatic and urban environments, causing considerable human morbidity and mortality. The re-emergence of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in almost every part of the world has caused alarm to many health agencies throughout the world. The mosquito vector for this virus, Aedes, is globally distributed in tropical and temperate regions and capable of thriving in both rural and urban landscapes, giving the opportunity for CHIKV to continue expanding into new geographical regions. Despite the importance of alphaviruses as human pathogens, there is currently no targeted antiviral treatment available for alphavirus infection. This mini-review discusses some of the major features in the replication cycle of alphaviruses, highlighting the key viral targets and host components that participate in alphavirus replication and the molecular functions that were used in drug design. Together with describing the importance of these targets, we review the various direct-acting and host-targeting inhibitors, specifically small molecules that have been discovered and developed as potential therapeutics as well as their reported in vitro and in vivo efficacies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Alphaviruses belong to the Togaviridae family, are mainly arthropod-borne viruses that are transmitted by vectors such as mosquitoes and can be found widely throughout the world except Antarctica. [1] [2] [3] Alphaviruses cause various clinical manifestations ranging from febrile illnesses to neurological diseases. 4 Infections with Old World alphaviruses such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Semliki Forest virus (SFV), O'nyong nyong virus (ONNV), Sindbis virus (SINV), Mayaro virus (MAYV) and Ross River virus (RRV) commonly cause febrile illness and painful arthralgia or polyarthralgia. 5 In contrast, encephalitis is mainly caused by New World alphaviruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV). 6 Functionally, an alphavirus particle comprises a single-stranded positive-sense RNA and delivery system. 7 The delivery system involves a protein shell that consists of capsid protein (CP), glycoproteins and a host-derived envelope that is acquired when the virus buds through a cellular membrane. 7, 8 This protein shell surrounds, stabilizes and protects the positive-sense RNA genome, which encodes non-structural proteins (nsPs) and structural proteins. 2 The nsPs (i.e. nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4) aid in the production of new viral RNA strands, while the structural proteins consist of the CP, envelope glycoproteins E1, E2, E3 and the residual polypeptide 6K, which ultimately make up part of the mature virion. 2 Table 1 illustrates the essential known functions of each alphavirus protein. 9 For any given virus, a detailed understanding of the processes involved in its replication cycle is vital for the design of drugs that selectively inhibit viral replication without interfering with host cell function. As illustrated in Figure 1 , the replication cycle of alphavirus can be summarized in three main stages, which are virus entry, intracellular replication, and maturation. At the beginning of the replication cycle, alphavirus infects host cells by engaging its E2 glycoproteins with the cell surface receptors and then enters the cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. 10 As the virus-containing endosome matures, the acidic environment that develops within the endocytotic vesicle destabilizes the envelope glycoprotein structure. 2, 11 The resulting conformational change initiates fusion between the virus and late endosomal membranes, leading to the emptying of the nucleocapsid into the cytosol (Event 1).

Arbidol (Figure 3 ) was originally licensed in Russia for treatment of influenza and other respiratory viral infections. 40 Time-ofaddition studies showed that arbidol demonstrated greater antiviral activity against CHIKV when treatment was before infection, suggesting that arbidol blocks the earliest stages of the CHIKV replication cycle (i.e. virus attachment and/or virus entry). 41 Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of similar analogues of arbidol were also investigated. 42 Of these analogues, two arbidol tert-butyl ester derivatives, 1 and 2, possessing a sulphoxide group, demonstrated similar activity to arbidol but better cytotoxic profiles ( Figure 3 ). 42 Signs of resistance were observed when cells infected with a mutant CHIKV were treated with arbidol. 41 Since the position of this mutation was localized in the E2 domain, where interactions between E2 and cell receptors occurred, it was believed that arbidol and its derivatives demonstrate anti-CHIKV activity through blocking the interactions between E2 and surface receptors during CHIKV attachment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 304, "end": 306, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 534, "end": 536, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 835, "end": 837, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1101, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1206, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1394, "end": 1396, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1498, "end": 1500, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 722, "end": 731, "text": "(Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1382, "end": 1390, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Inhibitors of virus attachment and entry"}, {"text": "Phenothiazine compounds, i.e. chlorpromazine, ethopropazine, methdilazine, perphenazine, thiethylphenazine and thioridazine, are drugs that have been used in the treatment of psychotic and allergy diseases (Figure 3) .

[47] [48] [49] The antiviral action of chloroquine involves inhibition of virus entry by increasing the endosomal pH above the critical value needed for the low-pH-dependent fusion reaction to occur, hence preventing the fusion of E1 protein and transfer of virus nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. 47 However, chloroquine was not effective when administered in mice infected with SFV. Instead the drug enhanced SFV replication in vivo and aggravated the disease. 50 In addition, results of a double-blind placebocontrolled randomized trial in CHIKV-infected patients did not yield convincing data on its efficacy. 51 Obatoclax, an anticancer drug, is an antagonist of the prosurvival Mcl-1 protein, which triggers apoptosis in cancer cells.

Since they could not obtain enzymatically active CHIKV nsP1, they investigated the mechanism of 3 against VEEV nsP1 and results showed that 3 inhibited the activity of VEEV nsP1, specifically the in vitro guanylyltransferase (GT) activity, hence causing significant inhibition of VEEV replication. 54 In addition, a CHIKV mutant possessing a P34S substitution in nsP1 was also found to be highly resistant to the antiviral effect of compound 3. 54 S-Adenosyl methionine (AdoMet) and S-adenosyl homocysteine (AdoHcy) are natural substrates of alphavirus nsP1 mRNA capping machineries.

Thiazolidinones, i.e. compounds 4-8 (Figure 3) , demonstrate antiviral activities against CHIKV and limited cytotoxic liabilities at their active concentrations. 57 A molecular docking study revealed that these inhibitors established crucial hydrophobic interactions with S2 and S3 pockets of CHIKV nsP2 and hydrogen bonding interactions with a key residue (Tyr1047), suggesting that these thiazolidinone derivatives could be inhibitors of CHIKV nsP2 protease. 57 In another strategy for small-molecule drug discovery, a virtual screening method was utilized.

Replacement of the cyclopropane ring in hydrazide 9 with an alkene moiety resulted in hydrazide 10 (Figure 3 ), which demonstrated a slightly improved antiviral profile. 58 A new class of hydrazide-based nsP2 inhibitors was also designed and generated by employing computational pharmacophoric replacement and using hydrazide 9 as a lead. 59 Of these, hydrazide 11 (Figure 3 ) not only showed inhibition of the cleavage of peptide substrate by CHIKV nsP2 in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based cell-free protease assay, but also demonstrated anti-CHIKV activities at low micromolar concentrations. 59 Interestingly, reduction of both viral RNA synthesis Review JAC and infectious virus production was observed when cells were pretreated with hydrazide 11, suggesting there could be other modes of action associated with this compound. 59 Moving forward, it would be interesting to analyse the inhibitory properties of the individual cis/trans isomers of hydrazide 11 as stereochemistry could be a major determinant of compound activity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 300, "end": 302, "text": "53", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 471, "end": 473, "text": "53", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 488, "end": 490, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 944, "end": 946, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1091, "end": 1093, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1348, "end": 1350, "text": "55", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1523, "end": 1525, "text": "56", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1738, "end": 1740, "text": "56", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2027, "end": 2029, "text": "57", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2326, "end": 2328, "text": "57", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2823, "end": 2825, "text": "58", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 3114, "end": 3116, "text": "58", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 3283, "end": 3285, "text": "59", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 3560, "end": 3562, "text": "59", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 3797, "end": 3799, "text": "59", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 192, "end": 202, "text": "(Figure 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1901, "end": 1911, "text": "(Figure 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2656, "end": 2665, "text": "(Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 3043, "end": 3052, "text": "(Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 3309, "end": 3318, "text": "(Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Inhibitors of virus replication and protein synthesis"}, {"text": "A peptidomimetic strategy was also employed in the design of small-molecule inhibitors of CHIKV nsP2 in which these peptidomimetic inhibitors were modified from specific amino acid sequences, such as Ala1861-Gly1862-Gly1863-Tyr1864 (AGGY), which is the natural substrate of CHIKV nsP2 protease. 60, 61 The studies led to the identification of peptidomimetic 12 (Figure 3) , which demonstrated a maximum of 100% inhibition of CHIKV replication at 68.2 lg/mL concentration. 61 Molecular modelling revealed that peptidomimetic 12 binds to CHIKV nsP2 via covalent interaction between its a-b unsaturated ketone functionality and the catalytic residue S1013 in nsP2. 61 Quinazolinone compound CID15997213 (Figure 3 ) demonstrates potent in vitro activity against various VEEV strains (TC-83 and V3526) and WEEV as well as good in vivo antiviral efficacy. 62 A mutation at two key residues (Y102C and D116N) in the N-terminal region of nsP2 in a drug resistance study indicated that the Review site of action of CID15997213 could be the nsP2 viral domain. 62 CID15997213 was utilized as a starting point for a classical structure-activity optimization study due to its preliminary promising anti-VEEV activity and good physiochemical profile.

This suggests that favipiravir possibly inhibits CHIKV replication via interference with RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity. 68 A molecular hybrid of isatin-b-thiosemicarbazone and benzimidazole, MBZM-N-IBT (Figure 3) , was developed for investigation against in vitro CHIKV infection. 69 This hybrid compound not only reduced viral protein and RNA production at 200 lM concentration, but also inhibited CHIKV infection in the early and late phases of replication, which indicates multiple mechanisms for its anti-CHIKV activity. 69 In addition, molecular docking studies revealed favourable binding affinities of MBZM-N-IBT with the homology models of CHIKV nsP1, nsP3 and nsP4. 69 A class of natural products (i.e. secopregnane steroid glaucogenin C and its monosugar-glycoside cynatratoside A of Strobilanthes cusia and three new pentasugar glycosides of glaucogenin C of Cyananchum paniculatum) were found to possess effective inhibition against alphaviruses such as SINV and EEEV at nanomolar concentrations. 70 These steroid-containing compounds, including secopregnane steroid glycoside 13 (Figure 3) , suppress the expression of SINV subgenomic RNA (sgRNA), predominantly without affecting the accumulation of viral genomic RNA. 70 From the study, the mode of action of these compounds may involve alteration of the structure of the sgRNA promoter, thereby affecting the binding of the transcription complex to the sgRNA promoter, resulting in a decreased expression of sgRNA. 70", "cite_spans": [{"start": 295, "end": 298, "text": "60,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 299, "end": 301, "text": "61", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 472, "end": 474, "text": "61", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 662, "end": 664, "text": "61", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 850, "end": 852, "text": "62", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1052, "text": "62", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1426, "end": 1428, "text": "63", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1624, "end": 1626, "text": "63", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1894, "end": 1896, "text": "64", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 2232, "end": 2234, "text": "65", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 2400, "end": 2402, "text": "66", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2511, "end": 2514, "text": "67,", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 2515, "end": 2517, "text": "68", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 2630, "end": 2632, "text": "68", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 2917, "end": 2919, "text": "68", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 3078, "end": 3080, "text": "69", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 3322, "end": 3324, "text": "69", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 3472, "end": 3474, "text": "69", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 3806, "end": 3808, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 4029, "end": 4031, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 361, "end": 371, "text": "(Figure 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 700, "end": 709, "text": "(Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1265, "end": 1274, "text": "(Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2069, "end": 2079, "text": "(Figure 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2272, "end": 2281, "text": "(Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2999, "end": 3009, "text": "(Figure 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 3889, "end": 3899, "text": "(Figure 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Review"}, {"text": "Dioxane was discovered as a suitable ligand that bound nicely to the hydrophobic pocket of the SINV CP in protein crystallization studies. 71 Employing the crystal structure of this hydrophobic pocket in a molecular docking study, a series of dioxane-based antivirals that were predicted to bind to the hydrophobic pocket were synthesized and evaluated against SINV replication. 72, 73 Although the most potent dioxane-based compound, 14 (Figure 3) , demonstrated inhibition against SINV replication, it did not demonstrate any inhibition of the nucleocapsid assembly in the CP assembly assay. 72, 73 Picolinic acid (PCA;

Of these, the predominant mechanism of action is inhibition of inosine-5 0 -monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which leads to a depletion of cellular GTP pools and is needed for virus replication. 94 A derivative of ribavirin, ribavirin-5 0 -sulfamate (Figure 4) , was also described to inhibit SFV replication. 95 Another nucleoside analogue, 6-azauridine (Figure 4) , is a broad-spectrum antimetabolite that inhibits both DNA and RNA virus replication of CHIKV and SFV, 93 while replacement of the adenine or guanine core in a nucleoside with 4-fluoroimidazole resulted in 5-fluoro-1-b-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (5-FICAR; Figure 4) , which showed antiviral activity against SINV. 96 The carbocylic analogue of cytidine, carbodine (Figure 4) , has been shown to deplete CTP pools by inhibiting CTP synthetase (which converts UTP into CTP) and thereby inhibits RNA synthesis in the replication cycle of a range of DNA and RNA viruses. 97 Review pure carbodine compounds [(!)-carbodine and (#)-carbodine] were screened against VEEV-induced CPE. 98 Interestingly, (!)-carbodine did not exhibit any activity whereas (#)-carbodine demonstrated potent in vitro and in vivo antiviral efficacy. 98 Cordycepin (3 0 -deoxyadenosine; Figure 4 ) is known to influence replication of several viruses via reducing the poly(A) content of viral mRNA. 99,100 However, antiviral studies against SFV infection demonstrated that cordycepin did not specifically inhibit the synthesis of poly(A) sequences; instead it inhibited the synthesis of the virus RC. 101 Mycophenolic acid (Figure 4) , a weak organic acid and wellknown immunosuppressive agent, was first isolated from the fungus Penicillium stoloniferum and demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral activity against replication of several viruses, including CHIKV. 102, 103 Similar to ribavirin, the mechanism of action of mycophenolic acid in vitro is based on inhibition of cellular IMPDH activity. 94, 103 Brefeldin A, a macrolide lactone antibiotic produced by the fungus Eupenicillium brefeldianum, inhibits SINV protein synthesis and RNA replication, possibly due to its interference with the formation of vesicles that were required for viral RNA synthesis. 104 Harringtonine (Figure 4) , a cephalotaxine ester derived from the Japanese plum yew, Cephalotaxus harringtonia, is known to be an inhibitor of eukaryotic protein synthesis. 105 It not only demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of CHIKV during the early events of CHIKV replication after virus entry, but significantly reduced CHIKV RNA and the synthesis of nsP3 and E2 proteins at its noncytotoxic concentrations (1 or 10 lM). 106 The mechanism of action of harringtonine has been suggested not to be specific to CHIKV, instead being exercised through inhibition of the eukaryotic large ribosomal unit, thereby suppressing viral protein translation, leading to a decrease in the levels of RCs and viral RNA. 106 Lanatoside C, an approved cardiac glycoside that acts by inhibiting the Na ! -K ! -ATPase ion pump, was demonstrated to have potent inhibitory activity against various RNA viruses, such as DENV, CHIKV and SINV. 107 As optimum levels of intracellular Na ! and K ! in the cytosol environment are important for proper replication of various DNA and RNA viruses, increased levels of intracellular Na ! and reduced intracellular K ! caused by lanatoside C affected the replication of CHIKV and SINV. 107 Similarly, another inhibitor of the Na ! -K ! -ATPase ion pump, digoxin (Figure 4) , showed enhanced inhibition of CHIKV when extracellular Na ! was introduced, but exhibited no or marginal inhibition of CHIKV when extracellular K ! was introduced. 108 Digoxin displayed a broadspectrum inhibitory effect against other alphaviruses, such as RRV and SINV. 108 In addition, mutation of the valine at residue 209 in nsP4 to isoleucine was observed in digoxin-resistant CHIKV populations, suggesting that digoxin could be inhibiting CHIKV replication by disrupting RNA synthesis. 108 Although digoxin is known to be cytotoxic owing to its narrow therapeutic index in treating heart diseases, 109 the observed in vitro CHIKV inhibition by digoxin was not due to its cytotoxicity (i.e. toxicity only occurred at a dose 20 times its EC 50 for antiviral activity). 108 Preclinical studies using an in vivo mouse

initiation factor 2 signalling pathway. 113 Continuing the efforts to improve the physiochemical properties that contribute to the in vivo blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of indole 16, the

discovered as possessing better metabolic stability in MLMs (half-life 15-19 versus 9 min), improved aqueous solubility and nearly equivalent passive permeability as measured in a BBB-parallel

[122] [123] [124] [125] For this reason, an inhibitor of the MAP kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Ag-126 ( Figure 5 ), was evaluated and found to possess inhibitory activity against VEEV replication in its non-toxic concentration range during early and late events of the virus replication cycle. 123 Another natural product, berberine ( Figure 5 ), was also found to impede alphavirus replication through inhibiting the phosphorylation of ERK, thereby affecting the egress of progeny virions, since it did not affect virus entry and enzymatic activity of the viral RC. 126 In vivo antiviral efficacy studies of berberine revealed that it could behave as both an antiviral agent (i.e. reducing viral load in infected mice) and an anti-inflammatory agent (i.e. decreasing joint swelling in infected mice). 126 Interestingly, berberine demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral activity against other Old World alphaviruses such as SINV and SFV, 127 while Ag-126 demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral activity against New World alphaviruses such as EEEV and WEEV. 123 On the other hand, a kinase inhibitor library containing 4000 compounds was screened against in vitro CHIKV infection and among the 72 primary hits, 6 compounds containing benzofuran, thiazole and pyrrolopyridine core structures were identified.

Nuclear transport inhibitors such as mifepristone, ivermectin and leptomycin B have been shown to inhibit VEEV replication by altering VEEV CP localization and activity. 140 Of these, leptomycin B, a well-documented CRM1 inhibitor and Streptomyces metabolite, was very potent in restricting the CP to the nucleus, making it unavailable at the cytoplasm to form viable virions. 140 Since leptomycin B is rather cytotoxic, there is a need to investigate a new generation of CRM1 inhibitors. Hence, a series of selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) compounds, such as KPT-185, KPT-335 ( Figure 5 ) and KPT-350, which are analogues of selinexor, was explored. 141 These compounds confine VEEV CP to the nucleus, leading to a depletion in the amount of cytoplasmic CP (i.e. intracellular CP) and released CP (i.e. extracellular CP), as demonstrated in western blot analyses. 141 This leads to a decrease in virus assembly and/or release of mature virions. Serial passaging of VEEV-infected cells in the presence of KPT-185 resulted in mutations within the nuclear localization and nuclear export signals in the CP (i.e. T41I, K64E or K64M), confirming that this SINE compound exerts its antiviral activity by targeting CP localization. 141 Bortezomib ( Figure 5 ) is a dipeptidyl boronic acid that specifically and reversibly inhibits the ubiquitin proteasome. 142 As a result, the early stage of the VEEV infectious cycle was affected by bortezomib during the fusion stage, when the VEEV CP was K48 ubiquitinated for proteasomal degradation for the release of the viral RNA. 143 Bortezomib treatment also decreased the multiplication of other virulent New World alphaviruses. 143 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 231, "end": 235, "text": "132,", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 236, "end": 239, "text": "133", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 426, "end": 429, "text": "134", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 648, "end": 651, "text": "134", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 840, "end": 843, "text": "134", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 939, "end": 942, "text": "134", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1095, "text": "135", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 1277, "end": 1281, "text": "136,", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 1282, "end": 1285, "text": "137", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 1388, "end": 1391, "text": "138", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 1539, "end": 1542, "text": "138", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 1890, "end": 1893, "text": "139", "ref_id": "BIBREF136"}, {"start": 2213, "end": 2216, "text": "140", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 2420, "end": 2423, "text": "140", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 2707, "end": 2710, "text": "141", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 2921, "end": 2924, "text": "141", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 3282, "end": 3285, "text": "141", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 3407, "end": 3410, "text": "142", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 3622, "end": 3625, "text": "143", "ref_id": "BIBREF140"}, {"start": 3723, "end": 3726, "text": "143", "ref_id": "BIBREF140"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 448, "end": 456, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 1470, "end": 1478, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 2635, "end": 2643, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 3299, "end": 3307, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "Modulators of cellular functions that assist virus replication"}, {"text": "A number of reported direct-acting and host-targeting inhibitors of alphaviruses have been highlighted, with the emphasis on their mechanisms of action.

Despite the selective antiviral activity of direct-acting inhibitors such as favipiravir, CID15997213 and ML336 against the functions of alphavirus elements compared with host cellular targets, the use of direct-acting inhibitors in treatment regimens can lead to the rapid selection of resistant viruses. On the other hand, host-targeting inhibitors such as digoxin, bortezomib, berberine, Ag-126 and SINE compounds represent an alternative approach, and may increase the barrier to resistance and achieve broadspectrum antiviral coverage against a range of alphaviruses.
