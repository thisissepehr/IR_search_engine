It is believed that the use of CPB is associated with the activation of multiple inflammatory pathways [7] . A few proinflammatory cytokines elevate in response to tissue injury, transfusion and endotoxic challenge, and lead to systemic proinflammatory status [19] [20] [21] [22] . This systemic proinflammatory status results in neutrophil influx [22] , pulmonary coagulopathy [22] , capillary endothelial damage [23] and increased pulmonary vascular permeability [24] , which are the characteristic findings in ARDS. In this case, an indicator of systemic inflammatory response might be helpful for alarming the development of ARDS. Although the mechanism has not yet been completely clarified, it is believed that bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract and the associated release of endotoxin during CPB may play an important role in stimulating the liberation of PCT [18] . Therefore, PCT might serve as an indicator of the inflammatory response caused by CPB, and thereby warning the development of ARDS. Moreover, patients with higher PCT levels have significantly longer durations of surgery and CPB in our study, and (weak) positive correlations were also found. This is somehow explained by that a longer CPB time would lead to more proinflammatory cytokine release and a more profound inflammatory response. For instance, it has been reported that the magnitude of complement activation is proportional to the duration of CPB [25] . We used a cut-off value of 7.0 ng/mL for patient assignment in this study. This cut-off value was obtained from our previous retrospective case-control study in a similar study population, and more than 100 cases were enrolled in that study between 2010 and 2014 (unpublished data). Therefore, the present study was actually a prospective validation of elevated PCT as a predictor of ARDS. Using the data of this study we performed ROC curve analysis again and obtained an optimal cutoff value of 6.5 ng/mL. Two patients who were in the control cohort should be assigned to the PCT-elevated cohort if 6.5 ng/mL was chosen as the cut-off value, and the sensitivity would be slightly improved (51.9% to 59.3%) with no difference in specificity.

In our study, the overall incidence of ARDS was 9.1%; this is comparable to the previous report (10.2%), which used the term \"acute lung injury\" [5] . The incidence of moderate-to-severe ARDS was 2.7%, which was also close to previous studies (that defined ARDS as a PaO 2/ FiO 2 ratio < 200) [1, 2, 26] .

The possible explanation is that ARDS is a heterogeneous syndrome that encompasses lung injury from both direct and indirect sources. A sepsis-like inflammatory response and endothelial damage caused by CPB leads to an extrapulmonary ARDS, which is more homogeneous and recruitable. Therefore, in spite of severe reductions in oxygenation, these patients are less likely to develop ventilator-induced lung injury which worsens the lung injury and is associated with death. Once the inflammatory response ceases and the endothelial damage recovers, patients can rapidly recover. One more reason is that our patients were having elective surgery, which means that they had a better underlying health condition. There were 6 patients who developed pneumonia, which happened after the sampling of PCT. This means that pneumonia was less likely be the reason for the elevation of PCT. However, the PCT-elevated cohort had a higher incidence of pneumonia as well. This is probably because of the longer duration of mechanical ventilation in the PCT elevation cohort, which is the risk factor of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
