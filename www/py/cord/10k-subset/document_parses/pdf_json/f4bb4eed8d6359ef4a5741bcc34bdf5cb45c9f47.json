Preoperative TOE to analyse the extent and mobility of the tumor. Close cooperation with anesthetics and Urologists. Start with mobilization of the affected kidney. No irrevocable steps until resection guaranteed, mobilization of IVC infra and supra hepatically.If IVC is involved always institute CPB. Venous cannulae: SVC, Right femoral vein.Prepare to use brief period of Total Circulatory Arrest (TCA) if the tumor is involving the suprahepatic IVC and protruding into the Right atrium. Repair the Cavotomy with the use of a pericardial patch.Conclusions:Success of IVC surgery depends on careful patient selection and attention to detail.

Ireland (Elaine.Mulligan@southerntrust.hscni.net) Background: NIV is an established part of treatment of patients with Type 2 Respiratory Failureespecially secondary to COPD. NIV should be available to all such patients when admitted in acute medical wards. Aim: NIV audits have previously been carried out in 2004 and 2006. We compare results of 2008 with previous audits and assess if BTS guidelines are being adhered to. Method: We obtained records of 20 patients who received NIV in 2008 and compared with previous results using the BTS audit tool. Results: Patient data registration is improving. There were 46 patients treated with NIV in 2008 from August 2007 to August 2008. There were 26 males and 20 females. All patients had type 2 respiratory failure in all three audits. The majority of patients had underlying diagnosis of COPD Performance status was poor in most patients in all three studies. ICU consultation remains high. Respiratory team involvement has improved. Planned weaning off NIV is better. Conclusions: Documentation has improved since previous 2 audits. however lack of sufficient equipment and shortage of trained staff restrict liberal use in COPD patients.

During family screening his daughter was discovered to have a carotid body tumour but without OSA.At presentation, his Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI) was 19.6, and his Epworth Score was 19 out of possible 24. After resection of both carotid body tumours, his AHI score fell to 4.3, and he was symptomatically improved and he was able to return to work.This unusual case highlights the need to investigate patients with OSA for an underlying treatable cause.
