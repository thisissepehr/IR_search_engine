            "text": "Acinar cells have been difficult to maintain in primary or secondary cultures over extended periods of time. The most successful monolayer culture system reported to date requires basement membrane substrates. We report here a technique for culture of rat parotid acinar cells which does not rely upon basement membrane supports for maintenance and growth. The procedure involves gland excision, treatment to chelate metal ions, enzymatic digestion with collagenases and hyaluronidase, removal of fat and red blood cells by gravimetric separation, and nylon mesh filtration to yield a homogeneous suspension of small aggregates and single cells. The cells were examined for: a) morphology, Mentity, and growth; b) macromolecular synthesis; and c~ secretory output. They were healthy, peroxidase positive, and growing for up to 10 d. Protein synthesis increased from the point of cell layer formation at 3 to 4 d, through 10 d, while DNA synthesis decreased. As in other studies, amylase secretion fell sharply between 2 and 4 d in culture and remained low. Although previous studies indicated that the initial isolation protocol left these acinar cells unable to thrive in monolayer culture except in the presence of basement membrane substrates, the modified technique reported herein allows these ceils to attach, spread, and grow on a wide variety of commercially available plasticware. This method lends itself readily to long-term analysis of rat parotid acinar cell metabolism without the complications of dedifferentiation, cell loss through culture manipulation common in suspension cultures, or complex interactions between bioactive supports and cell surfaces.",

Although extensive information about the morphology of tile salivary glands, composition of saliva, and events leading to secretion of saliva is available, very little information can be found regarding the temporal and topographic aspects of the synthesis of salivary macromolecules.

In this study a system for isolation and culture of rat parotid acinar cells as monolayers, which requires culture on a special substrate of reconstituted basement membrane gel prepared from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor extracts and coated onto Falcon Primaria plasticware, was reported. This support allows cells to be maintained for periods up to 21 d, during which they undergo growth and division.

Several of the main constituent molecules of basement membranes have also been demonstrated to modulate protein synthesis and secretion. Laminin-rich gel supports are required for the sustained secretion of albumin by rat bepatocytes (4), and collagen gels are necessary for casein synthesis and secretion in mouse mammary epithelial cells (13) .

The washed pellets were suspended in 2 ml of distilled H20 and solubilized with 50 tal 5 N NaOH.

Based on previously published methodologies 127,28}, the isolation protocol summarized in Table 1 was developed. Several major modifications from the starting procedure should be noted. Only rats of at least 30 d of age were used, to ensure that the acini of their parotid glands had matured to adulthood (34}. Euthanasia by asphyxiation in CO2 vs. cardiac puncture, in combination with the particular surgical field presentation we use, results in minimal connective tissue, fat, and red blood cell contamination in our preparation. This modification also allows us to eliminate a second gravimetric cell separation step required by the starting protocol, so long as the subsequent centrifugation's time does not exceed 3 min.",

Purity of both the collagenases and the hyaluronidase is critical to maintaining high cell viability along with structural and functional integrity (27,40}. The high cost of the particular type of hyaluronidase we employed prompted the decision to lower the concentration used. This had no adverse affects on the results obtained. However, when hyaluronidase was omitted entirely from the enzyme solution, cell viability was reduced from 83.7% in an otherwise identical experiment to 63.8% without hyaluronidase. The number of viable cells fell from 9.64 X 107 to 6.81 X 107 between the two isolations. Reduction of the incubation period in this mixture from 1 h to 45 rain produced a cell dispersion that permitted us to omit the required 500-tam nylon mesh filtration of the initial method. Lack of the hyaluronidase necessitated relnstitution of the 500-tam nylon mesh filtration step and introduced a need for greatly increased mechanical shearing forces during all three filtrations.

For our research needs, the rat parotid acinar cells must continue to express the same pattern of exocrine activity found in vivo in mature acini, particularly with regard to salivary peroxidase production. To begin, amylase activity was measured, as this enzyme accounts for about 30~ of the total parotid saliva protein content (26) and is, therefore, easily quantitated. Amylase activity fell sharply with the transition from cell aggregates to layers (Table 3L Values at Days 4 and 6 dropped to 15 and 6% of the activity measured in Day 2 culture medium, respectively. By Days 8 through 10, activity had leveled off to only 4% of that seen in cultures of freshly isolated cells. Exocrine secretion in salivary gland cells is stimulated by alpha-and beta-adrenergic receptor activation (2, 7) . Amylase secretion by rat parotid acinar cells in response to treatment with a beta-agonist, isoproterenol, and epinephrine, a mixed alpha-and beta-agonist was investigated. Acute stimulation of acinar cell cultures with both 100 /~M isoproterenol and 100 /~M epinephrine for 30-min periods, concentrations and time frames found optimal for secretory amylase output by parotid gland slices (1), resulted in increased amylase secretion throughout the incubation period of 10 d ( Table 3) . As expected, stimulation was minimal on Day 2, when amylase secretion is already near maximal. For the remaining culture period, isoproterenol stimulated amylase secretion by 306 + 19.3% over that of untreated cultures, whereas epinephrine stimulation increased amylase output by 233 + 11.5%. In both instances, susceptibility to secretagogue stimulation remained at consistant levels throughout the experiments.",

Because these cells do stain for peroxidase with DAB, we tested the possibility that peroxide concentrations were below the detection limits of the assays. Medium from overnight suspension cultures with 3.62 X 106 cells/ml was assayed by the ABTS method and found to contain 484 mU/ml of peroxidase activity. This would mean that the 10 ~ cells of a standard 35-mm dish culture could be expected to secrete a total of about 134 mU of peroxidase into 4 ml of medium, yielding a final concentration of ~33.5 mU/ml. This value lies at the lower limit of reliable detection by either method (24) and is an indication that the failure of the assays with medium from monolayer cultures is due to extreme dilution of the peroxidase. The inability to detect enzyme activity with acute secretagogue stimulation suggests that salivary peroxidase is not sufficiently responsive to the agonists tested under the culture conditions employed in our studies for detection by the Nbs/SCN-method. In addition, analysis of cell homoge- nates from cultures given acute secretagogue stimulation with isoproterenol and epinephrine as described above did not have detectable peroxidase activity, indicative of no intracellular accumulation of enzyme to a measurable level.",

            "text": "Previous studies {28) indicate that the sharp drop in amylase secretion is unique; other secretory proteins maintain consistent levels in acinar cell cultures when grown on Falcon Primaria Matrigel-coated dishes. Rat pancreatic acinar cells behave likewise in culture (6) . Both the parotid glands and saliva of rats undergoing chronic isoproterenol administration display a similar reduction in amylase activity with a concomitant increase in proline-rich protein synthesis (17) . To test if this is the case for cell layers grown on Linbro plastic, cultures were established as described and placed in 3sS-amino acid labeling medium (methionine-, cysteine-, sulfate-free complete medium/IP) 28 h before analysis. The choice of this labeling agent was made because the majority of all protein secreted by the parotid gland is in the form of proline-rich proteins (around 70% of the total), sequencing studies of which have indicated an absence of sulfur-containing amino acids (3). Cultures were incubated in this medium for 4 h before radioisotope addition to permit clearance of unlabeled proteins in secretory granules already formed in the cells. After 24 h of continuous labeling, protein isolation, and quantitation, 100 /~g of protein from Days 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 culture medium was applied to an SDS-PAGE gel. Analysis of autoradiograms by scanning densitometry revealed that amylase levels do drop over the experiment's course (Fig. 6) , in the same pattern as the enzyme activity measurements in Fig. 4 . However, other bands displayed significant changes, including the consistent appearance of bands of molecular weight greater than 200 kDa, possibly mucinlike proteins, on Day 6 but not thereafter. The incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids into secreted proteins dropped sharply at Day 10, an indication of diminishing metabolic activity. Under the same conditions of this experiment, salivary peroxidase was not detected as a discrete band on the gels, not unexpected given that this; protein is a minor component of saliva, present in the concentration range of 1 to 10 /~g/ml (38) . The total protein concentration in whole saliva equals 2.8 to 3.2 mg/ml (26) . The results obtained in Fig. 4 with regard to both protein and amylase levels in the cultures, taken together with the 3sSamino acid labeling study suggests this method disrupts only amylase secretion, leaving export of other proteins intact.",

This method minimizes cell loss through sequential feedings and permits easy separation of cells from their secretory products. We are now in a position to address the issue of determining what specific effects upon rat parotid acinar culture are exerted by individual basement membrane component molecules both alone and in different combinations. Further, culture of highly attachment positive rat parotid acinar cells as we have described may prove useful in pursuit of immortal strains from these primary cells with all possible avenues of study typical of such cell lines.
