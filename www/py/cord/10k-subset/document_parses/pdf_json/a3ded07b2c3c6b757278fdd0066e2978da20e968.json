After treatment, microbial and physicochemical analysis was carried out. Among various sterilization conditions, the largest number of pathogen in black pepper powder was inactivated by UV-A and UV-C combined with TiO 2 coating. The microbial count of black pepper powder treated simultaneously with UV-A and UV-C was less than that of black pepper powder treated with alone. The inactivation effect of UV-A and UV-C was increased when TiO 2 coating was combined. Moisture content was decreased with increasing treatment time, but color did not change.

Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) is a photocatalyst that is used to make an antimicrobial surface and has proved to be effective for sterilizing a wide range of microorganisms, including endospores (Foster et al., 2011) . TiO 2 does not produce byproducts, can be used repeatedly, and has the advantages of being stable and non-toxic under UV irradiation. (Yemmireddy and Hung, 2015) . TiO 2 has also been approved by the American Food and Drug Administration for use in human food, drugs, cosmetics, and food contact materials (Chawengkijwanich and Hayata, 2008) . The mechanism of action of TiO 2 is due to the production of reactive oxygen species(ROS) with strong oxidizing power when UV light is irradiated at wavelengths of less than 385 nm . When microorganisms are exposed to \u00c1O 2 and \u00c1OH produced by photocatalyst, oxidative damage occurs in cell walls, cell membranes, DNA, and RNA . The oxidation of unsaturated phospholipids destroys the cell membrane, and the increase of ion permeability induces cell death by inducing oxidation of the internal cellular components (Alrousan et al., 2009) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 188, "end": 208, "text": "(Knorr et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 209, "end": 227, "text": "Ojha et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 421, "end": 442, "text": "(Foster et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 579, "end": 606, "text": "(Yemmireddy and Hung, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 751, "end": 786, "text": "(Chawengkijwanich and Hayata, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1302, "end": 1325, "text": "(Alrousan et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Ultraviolet rays have a antimicrobial effect against many kinds of microorganisms including viruses (Guerrero Beltr\u00c1n and Barbosa C\u00c1novas, 2004) and are used to sterilize air, water, and surfaces of food or cooking utensils (Gay\u00e1n et al., 2011) .
