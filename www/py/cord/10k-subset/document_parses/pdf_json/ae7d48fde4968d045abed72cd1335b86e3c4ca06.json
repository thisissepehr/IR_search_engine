We analyzed data on HS patients transplanted in Europe to identify the risk factors for graft failure.

It might be that the higher degree of HLA mismatch 23 exerts a stronger graft-versusmarrow (GvM) effect. The fact that this GvM effect is associated with subclinical GvHD might be due to the fact that CB cells have a more naive phenotype. This might make the marrow more sensitive to GvM in comparison to the known target organs of GvHD. Another explanation might be the increased pluripotential capability of the CB stem cell, relative to adult stem cell, with higher proliferative potentials in comparison to BM. [24] [25] [26] We are aware from animal studies that the addition of mesenchymal stem cells to the SCT product results in less graft rejection, due to the immunomodulating potential of these cells. 27, 28 Other advantages of CB include (1) lower rates for acute GvHD and extensive chronic GvHD in comparison to unrelated donors, [29] [30] [31] [32] (2) immediate availability, 23 reducing the period between diagnosis and SCT (in this study 7.5 months), which might improve the long-term outcome, (3) reduced likelihood of transmitting infection (viral) and (4) the suggestion that a more primitive stem cell population might have a greater capacity for transdifferentiation. [24] [25] [26] This latter capability might be particularly important in SCT for inborn errors of metabolism, by theoretically improving delivery of enzyme to bone, cartilage and brain tissue.

Other groups have increased immunosuppression by adding fludarabine to a myelo-ablative regimen (Flud-MA) which, in the multivariable analysis, was found to be a predictor for a higher 'alive and engrafted' rate, in contrast to the results from the univariable analysis (P \u00bc 0. 19) .
