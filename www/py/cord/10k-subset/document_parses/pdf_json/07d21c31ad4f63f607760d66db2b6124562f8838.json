            "text": "Porcine gamma interferon is a cytokine produced by activated T cells and NK cells with broad-spectrum antiviral activity and immunomodulatory function. However, pIFN-\u03b3 is a secretory protein that has a short half-life in organisms and is easily inactivated, making it difficult to apply widely in clinics. Therefore, we tried to optimize the expression of pIFN-\u03b3 in Pichia pastoris to obtain a large amount of highly active, easily purified pIFN-\u03b3 protein in vitro. Through C-terminal sequence analysis, we found a signal sequence (EKREAEAE) that was easily enzymolysed by a signal peptide enzyme, resulting in degradation and inactivation of the pIFN-\u03b3 protein. In this study, we optimized the pIFN-\u03b3 gene recombination sequence and mutated the 3' end of the pIFN-\u03b3 gene, resulting in a higher expression level and stronger biological activity, as well as a significant upregulation in the expression of the interferon-stimulated genes Mx1 and OAS1 in IPEC-J2 jejunal epithelial cells. Our data also showed that the fermentation process could significantly improve productivity. A recombinant Pichia pastoris strain with the optimized pIFN-\u03b3 gene could obtain a high yield of pIFN\u03b3 protein, up to 9536 mg/L, after staged incubation for 0-24 h at 28\u02daC, pH 6.0, and 50% dissolved oxygen (DO), followed by incubation for 24-72 h at 25\u02daC, pH 6.0 and 30% DO. These data demonstrated, for the first time, that the expression level of pIFN-\u03b3 in Pichia pastoris was improved significantly by gene optimization with 3' end mutation and a fermentation process that maintained good biological activity, which is beneficial to the application of pIFN-\u03b3 in animal husbandry.

            "text": "Interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) is a cytokine with antiviral and immunomodulatory functions produced by activated T cells and NK cells [1] [2] [3] . The total porcine interferon gamma IFN-\u03b3 (pIFN-\u03b3) gene is 501 bases and encodes 166 amino acids. Twenty-three amino acids compose a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 the signal peptide, and 143 amino acids of pIFN-\u03b3 function in the activity of the mature protein [4] . pIFN-\u03b3 mainly participates in the immune regulation effect by activating the body's own immunity against viral attack [5] . The antiviral effect of interferon does not directly kill the virus but rather binds to cell surface receptors [6] to induce cells to produce enzyme-active antiviral proteins ADAR, PKR, Mx, OAS, and RNaseL, which degrade viral RNA, inhibit viral replication and translation, and inhibit viral shell formation to achieve antiviral effects [7] [8] [9] . Studies have shown that pIFN-\u03b3 can significantly inhibit the proliferation of reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) [6] and plays an important role in anti-swine fever virus (CSFV) cellular immunity [10] . A study also showed that pIFN-\u03b3 could enhance the immune response of piglets to dysentery antigens and played an important role in anti-Salmonella infection. pIFN-\u03b3 has broad application prospects due to its highly effective antiviral and immunomodulatory effects. The researchers also used different expression systems to express pIFN-\u03b3, but most of them have a problem with low protein expression or activity, which limits the further application of pIFN-\u03b3 [11] .",

            "text": "Under normal circumstances, the interferon species in animals is highly specific, has low expression levels and is difficult to extract and purify, Wang Li et ., al studies found that E.coli, Baculovirus can improve the co-expression level of interferon, while the expression products need to undergo degeneration, complex re-purification, which were seriously affecting the biological activity of interferon [11] [12] [13] , so research and development of a biological system for efficient production of interferon has aroused the attention of scholars globally. pIFN-\u03b3 was first expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) by genetic engineering, and with the improvement of extraction process, the pIFN-\u03b3 protein extraction rate reached 95%~97%, while the other 3% 5% was E. coli protein, which could easily cause substantial side effects such as fever, allergy and other adverse reactions. To express recombinant pIFN-\u03b3 with high efficiency, low cost and few side effects, in recent years, research on the expression system of methanolic yeast has progressed rapidly [14] . This system is regulated by the methanol-regulated alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter, which strictly controls the expression of exogenous genes [15] and has high stability and high secretion. The host bacterium Pichia pastoris has little endogenous protein secretion but highly active exogenous protein secretion, which is beneficial for downstream separation and purification operations and large-scale fermentation production; therefore, Pichia pastoris is a suitable eukaryotic expression system for exogenous genes [16] . In our previous studies, we found that interferon could not be purified by nickel-column affinity chromatography. By analysis of the 3' end of the gene, we found that the amino acids in positions 126-132 of the C-terminus may be similar to the cleavage site of the secreted \u03b1 signal peptide before its secretion. C-terminal peptides would be cleaved, and pIFN-\u03b3 protein with a complete C-terminus would fail to be secreted. After the optimization of the 3'-peptide chain, a large increase in biological activity was observed in yeast. In addition, it is well known that the fermentation process, especially the fermentation tank technology, is very important for the production of foreign proteins secreted by Pichia pastoris. Pichia pastoris does not affect normal growth and metabolism due to the accumulation of fermentation products. It is also easy to expand from shake flask culture to high density fermentation without affecting the expression level of exogenous genes, so it has great potential for high density fermentation; however, the expression system of Pichia pastoris has a great difference in the expression of different exogenous proteins, reaching up to 12 g/L or as low as only 1 mg/L, a 10,000-fold difference [17] . This difference in expression of the foreign protein stems, on the one hand, from the characteristics of the foreign gene itself, and on the other hand, from the fermentation conditions, with the latter having an important influence. The effect of temperature on the activity of yeast fermentation products, the physical properties of fermentation broth and the direction of biosynthesis, as well as the DO in the fermentation matrix, are very important to the growth of aerobic microorganisms. Therefore, in this study, we used the Pichia pastoris eukaryotic expression system, regulating the 3' end-DNA and fermentation process for enhanced production and biological activity of pIFN-\u03b3 in recombinant Pichia pastoris, to ensure the high-level expression of the protein at the transcription and translation levels, which laid a foundation for the construction of high-yield strains of pIFN-\u03b3 Pichia pastoris. The use of secretory expression greatly simplifies the subsequent purification steps and costs of the target protein and facilitates its industrial production.",

We designed a cloning approach based on synthetic overlapping primers and a PCR assembly strategy to construct a synthetic pIFN-\u03b3 fragment without the signal peptide sequence (GenBank: NM_213948). The pIFN-\u03b3 cDNA (GenBank: NP_999113) was used as a template for optimization to generate a set of twelve overlapping oligonucleotides. A mixture of the oligonucleotides was used in the first-round PCR procedure consisting of ten cycles, using KOD-FX polymerase to generate the coding sequence. Then, the region for the Xho\u2160 restriction site and KEX2 cleavage site of the \u03b1-factor signal sequence of P. pastoris were added to the 5' terminus of the synthesized fragment in the second-round PCR using the primer pIFN-\u03b3-forward. At the same time, the region for the Xba\u2160 restriction site was linked to the 3' terminus using the primer pIFN-\u03b3-reverse, which was inserted into the expression vector pPICZ\u03b1A to construct the plasmid pPICZ\u03b1A-pIFN-\u03b3 1 (S1 Fig) . The other region for the Xba\u2160 restriction site was linked to the 3' terminus using the primer pIFN-\u03b3-reverse with six histidine (His) tags.

The Pichia pastoris expression system is an excellent eukaryotic expression system developed in recent years: it has a strong AOX promoter, an exogenous protein that has a certain function in translation modification, and the advantages of primitive nuclear biological molecular genetics and simple operation. To date, more than 1000 exogenous proteins [25] have been successfully expressed by the Pichia pastoris expression system. However, there are some defects in the expression system of Pichia pastoris: some exogenous proteins are easily degraded by Pichia pastoris, there are still some exogenous proteins in the system that cannot be expressed or have low expression, and some exogenous proteins may have excessive glycosylation modification.",

[30] studied the expression of T-cell immune toxin by Pichia pastoris and found that the cDNA sequence was rich in A/T bases, which led to the early termination of transcription. After the A/T content and distribution were adjusted by codon optimization, the target protein was successfully expressed. In this study, the gene sequence optimization software developed by the State Key Laboratory of Pest Control and Resource Utilization at Sun Yat-Sen University, the COStar optimization tool, was combined with the optimization software Eugene, the mRNA local energy and the Pichia pastoris codon optimization table to comprehensively reconstruct the pIFN-\u03b3 coding sequence. There was a certain amount of exogenous protease expression inside and outside of the cells of the host bacterium Pichia pastoris, so that most exogenous proteins were subject to degradation during both intracellular expression and secretory expression, which was also an important factor affecting the expression. Degradation led to a decrease in the yield of the target protein, and the fragments formed by degradation also caused great difficulty in separation and purification, especially for the degradation products with small differences in the molecular weight of the target protein.",

By analyzing the C-terminal sequence of the pIFN-\u03b3 protein, it was found that the LRKRKRS sequence of the C-terminal amino acid is similar to the signal peptide sequence (EKREAEAE) and is easily enzymolysed by the signal peptide enzyme, resulting in degradation and inactivation of the pIFN-\u03b3 protein. Therefore, we mutated the arginine at positions 129 and 131 of the C-terminal end of the pIFN-\u03b3 protein to histidine (LRKRKRS mutation to RKHKH), thereby allowing the pIFN-\u03b3 protein to be secreted without degradation, and we added a histidine tag at the end of the C-terminus for easy purification and further research.",

The culture temperature of Pichia pastoris is suitable between 28~30\u02daC, but 28\u02daC is the optimum temperature for yeast body growth. It was found that the proper temperature reduction of Pichia pastoris is beneficial to the secretion of exogenous proteins, which may be due to the high temperature formation of disulfide bonds, which altered the structure of target proteins and seriously affected protein activity and yield [23] . At the same time, dissolved oxygen in the fermentation substrate was very important for the growth of aerobic microorganisms.

Compared with that, the expression level of pIFN-\u03b3 in this study was up to 9557 mg/L [33] [34] . By using a fermentation tank for large-scale fermentation, the expression level of exogenous protein could be increased 10~100 times that of a common shaker because the ventilation of flask fermentation was not ideal, and the density of fungal growth and the expression of exogenous protein were strongly affected. It was found that in the process of large-scale fermentation of Pichia pastoris, if the DO is less than 20%, it will affect growth and metabolism. If the DO is more than 60%, the cells will have oxygen poisoning. Therefore, the effective control of DO in large-scale fermentation is very important for the expression of exogenous proteins [21] . Through our study on the fermentation conditions of gradient temperature and gradient DO, it was found that the recombinant Pichia pastoris strain could obtain a high yield of pIFN-\u03b3 protein after stepwise variable temperature fermentation (0-12 h incubation at 28\u02daC and 50% DO and 24 h-72 h of incubation at 25\u02daC, pH 6.0 and 30% dissolved oxygen, up to 9536 mg/L). Meanwhile, analysis of porcine interferon activity by qPCR showed that the expression of the OAS1 and Mx1 genes in IPEC-J2 cells could be significantly improved by the pIFN-\u03b3 gene C-terminal mutation in 4 strains. The target proteins upregulated by the C-terminal peptide-specific amino acid mutations are more likely to be stimulated by the cells. We speculated that the integrity of the C-terminus of the pIFN-\u03b3 peptide chain is important for the formation or maintenance of the pIFN-\u03b3 spatial two-polymer structure. The structure of the C-terminal end was not complete, which resulted in the decreased activity of pIFN-\u03b3. After the C-terminal mutation of the pIFN\u03b3 sequence, the secreted expression of pIFN-\u03b3 protein contained a complete peptide chain structure and maintained high biological activity. Meanwhile, we also found that the pIFN-\u03b3 protein expressed by gene optimization was still active after high temperature treatment, indicating that the C-terminal mutation strategy is beneficial to the maintenance of the stability and biological activity of the pIFN-\u03b3 protein structure.",
