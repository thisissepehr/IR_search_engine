A hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay using guinea pig red cells and pseudoviruses expressing hemagglutinin of a representative A(H7N9) strain (A/Hangzhou/ 1/2013) was conducted for determining the HI titers of the serum samples, as previously described [7] .",

HI titers of 10 were detected in 3 of 123 serum samples (2.4%) from healthcare workers and 9 of 585 serum samples (1.5%) from the nonhealthcare workers.

These results also implied that A(H7N9) might not be able to cause asymptomatic or subclinical infection. To the best of our knowledge, no case of asymptomatic A(H7N9) infections have been reported so far. This also suggests that people may be unable to acquire H7N9-specific immunity through asymptomatic or subclinical A(H7N9) infection, which may explain why people lack population immunity against A (H7N9) viruses. However, more extensive serological investigation on the asymptomatic or subclinical A(H7N9) infection among different high-risk groups at different regions should be performed. A serum sample with a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer of \u226540 from a patient with influenza A(H7N9) infection admitted to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (SHAPHC) was included as a control in the HI assay. The study was reviewed and proved by the ethics committee of SHAPHC, and written informed consent was provided to the participants.",
