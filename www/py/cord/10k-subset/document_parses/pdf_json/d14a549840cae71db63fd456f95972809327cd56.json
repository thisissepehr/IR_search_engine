Recently, we observed a higher incidence of coronary lesions in KD patients with high anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titer. Therefore, we hypothesized that KD patients diagnosed with concurrent streptococcal infection have poor prognosis, with respect to treatment response and development of coronary artery lesions. Methods: A retrospective review was performed in 723 patients with KD who were admitted to 2 major hospitals between June 2010 and September 2017. Results: Among 723 patients with KD, 11 initially showed an elevated ASO titer (>320 IU/mL) or elevated follow-up ASO titer after treatment. Of these patients, 5 showed no response to the first intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, 3 had abnormalities of the coronary arteries. This is a significantly higher proportion of patients with a high ASO titer (n=3,27.3%) than those with a normal ASO titer (n=53 [7.4%], P=0.047). A severe clinical course was seen in 81.8% of patients in the high ASO group versus 14.5% of patients in the normal ASO group. Conclusion: It is not certain whether acute streptococcal infection may cause KD, but this study revealed that KD with high ASO titers showed higher rates of severe clinical course.

In Japan, several group A streptococcal serotypes showed a bimodal distribution, with peaks in December to February and again in May to June and a prominent nadir of infections in September. 23) In Korea, a seasonal pattern was observed in which KD occurred more often in early summer (May, June, and July) and winter (January and February), and occurred less often in the spring and fall. 24) Of the 11 KD diag noses, 4 were made in early summer (2 in May, 1 in June, and 1 in July), and 3 were made in winter (1 in January, 2 in February).
