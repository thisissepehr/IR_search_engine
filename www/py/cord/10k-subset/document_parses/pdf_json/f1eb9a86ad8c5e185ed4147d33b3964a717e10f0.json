Over the last years, the use of the latter cell source has increased for several reasons: (1) The majority of PBSC is less committed than their BM counterparts; 1 (2) the engraftment kinetics were found superior after transplantation of recombinant human (rh) granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized PBSC; 2 and (3) both the short-term side-effects and the collection procedure seem acceptable for healthy donors. 3 Only 25-30% of patients eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) have an HLA-matched sibling donor, and only half of the remainders find an HLA-matched unrelated donor. In vivo and/or in vitro T cell depletion has been applied widely to reduce complications from acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). 4, 5 This procedure has shown to be associated with a higher risk of graft failure, 6 leukemia (GVL) effect in patients with malignancies, and with long-lasting immune deficiency. 7 Animal studies have demonstrated that a dramatic increase of stem cell dose might overcome HLA barriers. 8 In man, the combination of T celldepleted BM with PBSC from G-CSF-mobilized haploidentical donors led to sustained engraftment in patients suffering from advanced leukemia. 9 To reduce the risk of rejection and relapse, these patients were treated with highly myeloablative and immunosuppressive chemotherapy including single dose total body irradiation (TBI) which might have adverse longterm effects in young children. Our aim was to apply conditioning regimens that were sufficiently cyto-and immunotoxic to control malignant disease on the one hand and enable engraftment of highly T cell-depleted PBSC on the other hand. We wanted to gain information on hematopoietic reconstitution by very close monitoring of the donor/patient chimerism, with particular emphasis on early detection of rejection or non-engraftment, because long-lasting aplasia raises the risk of severe infections.",

Although the transplantation of T cell-depleted, partially matched BM from relatives has a relatively long history, 16 it has been associated with a higher incidence of graft failure and severe infectious complications. 17 To overcome this obstacle the number of infused hematopoietic precursor cells was increased by adding PBSC from the same donor 18 to the BM grafts. For the donor, this procedure is associated not only with adverse effects such as stem cell mobilization by growth factors, but also with potential complications and discomfort during general anesthesia and BM harvesting. On the other hand, it was demonstrated that the transplantation of allogeneic PBSC from HLA-identical donors, whether T cell depleted or not, is associated with sustained engraftment and with decreased transfusion demand, but not with a higher incidence of acute GVHD compared to BM. 19 Therefore, our intention was to confirm that a trilineage engraftment is possible by transplanting exclusively PBSC obtained from haploidentical parental donors. 20 Only three of all parents had a favorable HLA constellation (two HLA loci mismatched), and the criteria for donor selection (father or mother) were therefore CMV serology, younger age, higher body weight and the feasibility of aphereses from peripheral veins. All donors were monitored during stem cell mobilization and aphereses, and after harvesting. In accordance with others, 21 the procedure was well tolerated in all instances, and no severe side-effects occurred.

T cell depletion by rosetting techniques 22 and by the use of monoclonal antibodies 23 for prevention of acute GVHD were performed. Particularly in BMTs from HLA-mismatched donors this goal was hard to meet. Especially rejection, 24 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated B cell lymphoproliferative disorders 25 and relapse of leukemia during the time of T cell reconstitution 26 were sometimes the price that had to be paid for an effective T cell reduction. In our study we accomplished a highly effective T cell depletion by combining two CD34-positive selection procedures and additionally, ATG was given for preconditioning. The CD34 + cell fraction contained a median of 5 \u00d7 10 4 T cells per kg of the recipient's body weight as determined by FACS analysis. The application of high doses of horse or rabbit ATG were tolerated without severe side-effects and could contribute to an additional graft rejection and GVHD prophylactic effect. In fact, with the methods applied, incidence of GVHD was low. It needs to be investigated within a larger cohort of patients whether this regimen is able to reduce the occurrence of leukemic relapse. Furthermore, because of our early, very exact engraftment monitoring, we could document not only the first signs of myeloid engraftment, but also rapidly prove the definite presence of recipient CD8 + cells due to the FACSsorted lymphocytes. We achieved myeloid engraftment due to rapid re-conditioning and transplantation of parental PBSCs in all patients with graft failure. Alas, one patient with DNA fragility succumbed due to organ toxicity. Our data demonstrate that even without BM cells, the myeloid engraftment was comparably fast with ANC \u03fe500/l on median day 12. In addition, the appearance of lymphocytes occurred within 12 and 144 days ( Table 3) . The time up to T cell engraftment was independent not only of the T cell numbers transplanted, but also of the HLA constellation, the CMV status and the conditioning regimen. This early reconstitution might be influenced by the young age of the recipients and the therefore enhanced thymic regeneration but also due to the absence of late acute or chronic GVHD.",

In our heterogeneous group of patients it was not possible to apply a uniform conditioning regimen. In all leukemia patients the regimen-related toxicity after first PBSCT was low, although the children had advanced disease and had been heavily pre-treated. When using alternative donors BU-based regimens have been associated with an increased risk of graft failure. 27 Others have published data showing successful engraftment with an irradiation-free conditioning regimen. 28 In our study, one patient, who received a BU-based regimen, had no engraftment. This was also true for another patient conditioned with a TBI-containing regimen. We speculate, that this was due to relatively low numbers of transplanted CD34 + cells which might have been below a critical threshold. Rejection occurred in two patients not conditioned with thiotepa. This drug seems to play an important role in conditioning for patients who receive an extensively T cell-depleted transplant. 29, 30 After rejection both patients experienced sustained engraftment receiving melphalan and thiotepa but the toxicity of the second conditioning was fatal in one patient with FA.",

The conditioning regimen applied induced remission of leukemia refractory to chemotherapy in nine patients. We could also show that an irradiation-free conditioning regimen enables complete engraftment after haploidentical PBSCT. Using very close monitoring of the donor/patient chimerism, it was possible to detect graft failure at a very early stage and carry out the appropriate re-conditioning and subsequent SCT. Our study indicates that the methods introduced justify further investigations to optimize SCT from HLA-mismatched family donors. We suggest that this transplantation model should be further developed, since it is readily available for most patients who lack an HLA-matched donor and is possibly more economic in comparison to transplantations from unrelated donors.",
