The review is focused on the results obtained at the Gauze Institute in the area of chemical modification of natural antibiotics (eremomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, etc.) directed toward modification of their antibacterial and/or antiviral activity. A special emphasis is placed on the study of the mechanisms of action of these antibiotics, which could be the basis of a rational approach to their chemical modification involving the transformation of the inner binding pocket and the peripheral regions of the molecules that participate in the formation of their complexes with targets. The recently discovered antiviral activity of modified glycopeptides antibiotics is also discussed. A possibility of obtaining new highly active anti-HIV-1 and anti-HIV-2 preparations on the basis of hydrophobic derivatives of the aglycones of glycopeptide antibiotics was demonstrated. New semisynthetic derivatives of antibiotics that exhibit a high antibacterial activity in vivo, have good pharmacological characteristics, and are promising for practical use are described.",

Until recently, the glycopeptide vancomycin ( I ) remained the only antibiotic effective at infections caused by multiresistant Gram-positive bacteria; teicoplanin ( II ) was also used on a limited extent. The usage of vancomycin for the past decade has led to the appearance of staphylococcus and enterococcus strains also resistant to vancomycin (and to other antibiotics of this group). GRE and GISA are especially dangerous. In the end of 1990s, enterococci responded for 12% of all hospital infections in clinics of some cities of USA; and >15% resistant enterococci of them cause a very high death rate, 42-81% from the number of infected patients (see [1] p. 16 ]. Now the situation has even more worsened, and practically, there are no drugs for the treatment of such patients. The search for new preparations of group of polycyclic glycopeptides active toward the multidrugresistant bacteria is now carrying out in the leading pharmaceutical companies and laboratories of the world [2] .",

Biosynthesis of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan includes two stages: transglycosylation, the formation of linear peptidylpolysaccharide (immature peptidoglycan) from fragments, lipid-II-pentapeptides, and lacing of the linear peptidylpolysaccharide with the formation of a three-dimensional structure, the mature peptidoglycan [7] [15, 16] by the example of many derivatives of glycopeptide antibiotics that the introduction of hydrophobic n-alkyl, p-substituted benzyl, or other substituents of related types at various positions of molecule (not only at COOH group or N'-amino group of the disaccharide residue at AR4) imparts the antibiotic of the activity toward GRE [2, 15, 16] . It has earlier been presumed that a hydrophobic fragment should be attached to 3'-amino group of the disaccharide fragment of vancomycin, eremomycin, or chloroeremomycin, which is similar to the N-replacement by a fatty acid of the aminosugar at AR4 in natural teicoplanin (II). Unlike vancomycin, teicoplanin is active toward some GRE.",

In the case of eremomycin, vancomycin, and chloroeremomycin, the reaction of reductive N'-alkylation predominantly proceeds at the N'-amino group of sugar, but it also appreciably touches the N-terminal NHMe group of the peptide chain of antibiotics [18, 19] . , and also the derivatives of other substituted amino acids proved to be less active. The substituted vancomycin (Ie) is more active than vancomycin at the sepsis of the mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus (ED 50 1 mg/kg in comparison with ED 50 2 mg/kg for vancomycin) and, what is especially important, substantially more active than vancomycin at the tissue infection of mice infected with S. aureus [17] .",

The activities of the hydrophobic derivatives of the antibiotic aglycones [e.g., (IVc), (IVg), (IVh), (Vb), (Vc), and (VId)] against SARS-CoV and Fe-CoV were within the range EC 50 ~ 20-30 \u00b5M. A number of hydrophobic compounds, e.g., (Ic), showed a high activity (EC 50 < 0.1 \u00b5M) against the varicella zoster virus (VZV). Some derivatives were active toward other envelop viruses of the series Retroviridae, Flaviviridae, and Coronaviridae [HSV (herpes simplex virus), CMV (cytomegalovirus), and BVDV (bovine viral diarrhoea virus) [36] .",

These peptides and aglycones of the antibacterial glycopeptides have a common structural motif; however, they differ in sizes of macrocycles, amino acid sequences, and stereochemistry of two amino acids A and E corresponding to amino acids 3 and 7 of vancomycin. Chloropeptins I and II and kistamycins A and B also manifest antiviral properties, but possess a reduced antibacterial activity [38] [39] [40] It has been shown as a result of the chemical and biological studies that chemical modifications allow the changes in antimicrobial properties: in the spectrum of antibacterial activities and in the activity toward resistant bacteria, including resistant enterococci with the altered binding target. A more considerable change in the spectrum of activities consists in that they acquire antiviral properties. It was established that a number of structural elements are necessary for the manifestation of activity toward glycopeptide-resistant bacteria and envelope viruses (the presence of a hydrophobic substituent of a certain size ~\u00eb 10 -\u00eb 15 ). However, the presence of carbohydrate moieties in structure are critical only for the exhibition of antibacterial activity. The manifestation of antiviral properties requires a peptide core in glycopeptides; some additional changes can deprive a molecule of a possibility of binding to bacterial receptors. ",
