With the goal of universal coverage, the Vietnamese government issued the first SHI law (Decree No. 63) in 2008, which expanded coverage to people experiencing poverty by fully subsidizing premiums for this group and informal-sector workers. To increase universal health coverage, the SHI law was revised in 2014 and SHI became mandatory for all citizens [3] . According to a report from the Vietnam Social Security (VSS), Vietnam has achieved a remarkable increase in SHI coverage; the number of health insurance card holders reached 83.5 million (88.5% of the total population) in 2019 [4] . As part of the transition from donor-based to SHI-based HIV service delivery, a Prime Minister's Decision (No. 2188/QD-TTg) was issued in 2016 that introduced a new goal of 100% SHI coverage (hereafter referred to \"universal SHI coverage\") for PLHIV by 2020.

In addition, two finance-related variables (individual income and employment) were not associated with lack of a SHI card in the logistic regression analyses. Various recent policies and schemes introduced by central and local government (e.g., subsidies for premiums for people living in poverty and near-poverty, allocation of local budgets for purchasing SHI cards) might have successfully contributed to the expansion of SHI.

Considering that women and older people are more likely to develop psychiatric disorders such as depression [32, 33] and anxiety [34, 35] , which may be triggered by loneliness or social isolation [36, 37] , more attention should be paid to their unique needs to prevent mental illness in these groups.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 272, "end": 276, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 708, "end": 712, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 823, "end": 827, "text": "[32,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 828, "end": 831, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 844, "end": 848, "text": "[34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 849, "end": 852, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 912, "end": 916, "text": "[36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 917, "end": 920, "text": "37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Factors associated with concerns about decentralization"}, {"text": "A strength of the present study is the uniqueness of the data, which reflect patients' voices about the current HIV financial and service transition obtained from one of the largest HIV patient cohorts in Vietnam, with a response rate of 100%.

First, as this was a single-center study, the participants who were receiving HIV services at a central urban hospital may not be representative of Vietnam's entire HIV population. Second, we used a cross-sectional design, which limits the extent to which causal inferences can be drawn for the associations identified.
