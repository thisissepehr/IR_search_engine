In an attempt to control these diseases, the development of chemotherapeutic agents is being actively pursued. The purpose of this coordinated study was to determine the antiviral activity of two pyrimidine compounds, 6-azauridine (AZU) and 5-iododeoxyuridine (IDU), in 10 viral infections of five animal species. Pyrimidines have received a great deal of attention as broad-spectrum antiviral agents in clinical as well as in laboratory studies. Schabel and Montgomery [1] listed 115 pyrimidines that have been tested in vivo. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has established, under the Antiviral Substances Program, a series of experimental viral infections in animals to enable the rapid evaluation of antiviral substances. These experimental models were selected to: (1) include representative agents from a number of major groups of viruses, (2) use a variety of animal species, and (3) simulate potentially treatable viral infections in man. The models used in these studies include Herpesvirus hominis types 1 and 2 and murine cytomegalovirus (CMV) in mice, vaccinia virus and Shope fibroma virus (SFV) in rabbits, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus and swine influenza virus in swine, feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) and feline panleukopenia (FPL) viruses in cats, and ferret distemper virus in ferrets.

Pharmacological evaluation of the two agents and thorough studies of their effect on the pathogenesis of the diseases were beyond the scope of this study. Although the studies reported here do not preclude effectiveness of these two agents in other viral infections of humans or experimental animals, they provide minimal support for more extensive evaluations of IDU and AZU efficacy in human trials.
