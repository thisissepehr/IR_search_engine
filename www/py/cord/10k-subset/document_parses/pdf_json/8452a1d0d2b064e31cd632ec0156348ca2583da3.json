While there are robust data examining the clinical course of dengue and malaria, the outcomes of these infections among the pregnant population, however, are not well described. Using retrospective data from a single institution, the present study sought to assess outcomes of pregnant women admitted with a dengue or malaria infection. Among the 85 patients included in the analysis, the majority were unemployed and had no antenatal booking. The cohort was relatively young with a median age of 28 years. Furthermore, more women had contracted dengue fever compared with malaria (56% vs. 21%). Of note, two fifths of the patients received a blood transfusion during admission; one quarter needed intensive care; and more than 14% required intubation. In addition, while patients with dengue became symptomatic and presented to the hospital at an earlier gestational age, patients with malarial infections were more likely to deliver low birth weight infants. Moreover, patients with multiple infections were more likely to deliver preterm and have higher WBC and ALT levels. In the current study one particularly alarming finding was the relatively high mortality rate of 7%. Collectively, these data demonstrate that women contracting dengue and/or malaria infections during pregnancy are at high risk of developing severe illness that can be fatal. There has been much interest in the outcomes of dengue and malaria in pregnancy; however, the consequences of these infections for the pregnant female remain unclear. For example, while Friedman et al. found that mothers with symptomatic dengue infections during pregnancy were more likely to deliver preterm and have low birth weight infants [12] ; in a separate study, Tan et al. reported equivocal perinatal outcomes among women with and without dengue infection [24] . In the present study, we found that most dengue patients delivered at term, with an average gestational age of approximately 38 weeks. Furthermore, babies born to mothers infected with dengue were, on average, of normal birth weight (mean weight [g] = 2969, SD = 577). In addition, the finding of the present study that mothers infected with malaria were more likely to deliver low birth weight babies (mean weight [g] = 2394, SD = 840) is in accordance with that of previous investigators [25] . The mechanism through which malaria causes low birth weight is thought to be related to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) [25] . In fact, it is estimated that in certain parts of Africa, up to 70% of the risk of IUGR is attributable to malaria [26] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 193, "end": 197, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 198, "end": 201, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1900, "end": 1904, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2023, "end": 2027, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2520, "end": 2524, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2654, "end": 2658, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2776, "end": 2780, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Importantly, in the present cohort, most patients were young, unemployed, and did not have their pregnancy registered with an obstetrician.

Of note, Pakistani society is widely acknowledged to be patriarchal with gender norms restricting women's mobility, access to health services, and professional opportunities [27, 28] . In an ethnographic analysis, Mumtaz and Salway reported that women's subordinate position within the household, economic dependency, and the taboos surrounding pregnancy contribute to the reduced utilization of antenatal services [27] . Additionally, there is growing evidence that education level is closely tied to improved health. For example, higher levels of female education have shown to be correlated with increased utilization of antenatal care [27] .

Indeed, previous authors have also noted the dengue case fatality rate to be higher among pregnant patients relative to the non-pregnant population [29] .

In contrast, in the overall cohort, one quarter of patients required ICU admission. In this context, the data in the current study are derived from a tertiary care center, and the high mortality rate should be interpreted with the caveat that patients at tertiary care hospitals are more likely to have severe disease. Of interest, in the current study the platelet levels were deranged below the lower end of normal with up to 40% of patients receiving a blood transfusion. The degree of thrombocytopenia among patients infected with dengue/malaria is an indicator of clinical severity and is thought to be due to platelet lysis by the complement cascade, platelet consumption secondary to disseminated intravascular coagulation, and disruption of the hematopoietic cells by the pathogens [30, 31] . Moreover, the diagnosis of dengue/malaria in pregnancy is made challenging due to similar symptomatology (such as thrombocytopenia, impaired liver function, and decreased urine output) as other pregnancy-related conditions such as pre-eclampsia.
