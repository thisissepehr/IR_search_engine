Different rhinovirus serotypes varied widely in their susceptibility to the antiviral agent. The MICs for 50% CPE reduction ranged from 0.004 to 15 gg/ml. The yields of the most susceptible serotypes were reduced by a factor of 1,000 to 10,000 after single round high multiplicity infections in presence of low concentrations of the compound. The inactivation of some but not all serotypes in a time-, concentration-and temperaturedependent way by R 61837 indicated a direct interaction between the drug and the viral particles. The antiviral activity of the compound was confirmed in the human target cells for rhinoviruses by experiments using nasal polyp explant cultures.",

Rhinoviruses have been shown to be the primary cause [4] . In the current classification system devised for rhinoviruses, 100 serotypes that can each cause colds have been accepted as distinct [8] . The widespread nature of the disease, the economic burden and the impracticality of vaccine development stimulate the search for effective chemotherapeutic agents. R 61837 or 3-methoxy-6-[4-(3-methylphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]pyridazine ( Fig. 1) is a new antirhinoviral compound. The present work describes its marked activity against representative rhinoviruses in HeLa cell culture and human nasal polyp organ cultures. ",

They were then serially diluted until non-inhibitory drug levels were reached and plaque assayed react with 5gg/ml of R61837 (solubilized in DMSO or 10% HPI3CD) and incubated at different temperatures (4, 20, and 33 \u00b0C for 1, 10, 30, 60, 120, or 240 minutes). Thereafter, each virus-drug mixture, as welt as control virus suspensions with the same solvent concentration but without R61837, was diluted with MEM until non-inhibitory concentrations of the compound were reached and titrated for residual viral infectivity in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 6b , the speed of the virus-drug interactions was slower at 4 \u00b0C and 20 \u00b0C than at 33 \u00b0C but eventually, about the same amount of virus was inactivated. The nature of the solvent did not appear to influence the binding between virus and drug.",

The virus-drug mixture and the virus controls were first treated with chloroform in an attempt to extract the drug bound to the virus to non-inhibitory levels and then plaque assayed. Preliminary experiments had shown that one chloroform treatment of a R61837 solution in 10% HP[3DC reduced the free drug concentration by a factor of 482. This allowed us to reach non-inhibitory levels of free drug and to determine the remaining infectivity of the viral particles by plaque assay. The results (not shown) indicated that, using this procedure, only 20 to 30 per cent of the original infectivity of low titrated samples of HRV 9 could be regained after interaction with drug levels between 200 ng/ml and 200 gg/ml.",

The infectivity of the less susceptible serotypes (HRV 63 and HRV 29) was not reduced by previous incubation with the compound, while the infectivity of the more susceptible viruses (HRV 9, 15, and 76) was reduced by between 70 and 90%, at least if they were incubated with the highest drug concentrations.

The data presented here show that R61837 is active against rhinoviruses and coxsackievirus A21, with MICs as low as 0.005gg/ml (0.018gM) for some serotypes. The compound was shown be active in single-round, high multiplicity infections as well as in multi-round, low multiplicity infections. The antiviral effects of R 61837 were confirmed in two cell types: HeLa cells and human nasal polyp exptants. We first used nasal polyp organ cultures to grow rhinoviruses, but parallel cultures from the same polyp did not always produce comparable amounts of progeny virus (results not shown). Human epithelial cells derived from nasal polyps and cultured in a monolayer replicated HRV 9 in a more reproducible way. They represent an easily obtainable alternative to human embryo nasal organ cultures [16] and are very valuable for assessment if a compound exhibits its antiviral activity in the natural host cell of the virus. Compounds which show antiviral activity only if tested in particular cell types have already been described [16, 19] .",

Chalcone and RMI 15,731 were found to bind to most of the serotypes tested and could be extracted from these viruses by chloroform, while dichloroflavan inactivated RV 16 only, although it was highly active against other serotypes in a CPE reduction test. R61837 could not be removed by dilution or chloroform extraction from some of the serotypes tested in the present study. As shown for chalcone, the MIC values were lower for serotypes which were bound tighter to R 61837. As for dichloroflavan, not all the serotypes tested bound the drug irreversibly. Susceptible serotypes, inhibited by R61837 in the CPE reduction test (Fig. 2 ) and in the virus yield reduction test (Fig. 3) but not inactivated after dilution (Fig. 6c) were apparently bound to the drug in a way which was totally reversible by dilution.",
