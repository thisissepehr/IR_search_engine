This arthritis is of importance to rheumatologists because it may provide the first spontaneously occurring model for the human disease. A preliminary study suggests that canine RA can be responsive to gold salt therapy (4). It is also intriguing that epidemiologic studies (5,6) have shown a greater exposure of human RA patients to dogs and other pets during the 5 years prior to onset of disease than for osteoarthritics and patients with other miscellaneous minor musculoskeletal problems. Examples of coincidental arthritis in pets and owners have been found. Household dogs of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (7) have also recently been suggested to be clinically and serologically involved.
