CPV was demonstrated in 56 (30%) of these samples; the weekly rate of positive CPV identification was remarkably constant at -30% even though clinical and often post-mortem findings strongly supported a diagnosis of CPV enteritis. The simplest, most sensitive and most rapid method for detection of virus was haemagglutination (HA) which was twice as sensitive as isolation of virus and 8 times as sensitive as electron microscopy (EM). Forty nine of 56 (88%) samples positive for CPV were from dogs < 1 year old and 44 (79%) CPV-positive samples were from pups < 6 months old; only one sample from a pup < 2 months old (pup was 7 weeks old) was positive. An additional 68 samples (53 faeces and 15 intestinal contents) were submitted from Beagle dogs that were part of a colony of -1200 dogs. Epidemiological data pinpoints the entry of CPV into the colony in November 1978 at which time most dogs including pups < 6 months of age developed antibody to CPV without developing clinical disease.
