Type A viruses have the greatest genetic diversity, harboring numerous antigenically distinct subtypes of the two main viral surface glycoproteins; so far, 18 hemagglutinin (HA) and 11 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes have been identifi ed. All possible combined 16 \u00d7 9 subtypes, except for H17-18 and N10-11 subtypes, which are detected only in bats (mammals) and exhibit functions completely different from those of the other subtypes [ 2 -4 ] , are maintained in waterfowls, mainly in wild ducks. These avian viruses are occasionally transmitted to other species that are immunologically na\u00efve, in which they may only cause outbreaks or may acquire mutations so as to be effi ciently transmitted between new hosts, and they can lead to a pandemic in human populations.

Also, the virus is capable of evasion of adaptive immune responses: evasion of the preexisting humoral or neutralizing antibodies and seasonal vaccines by antigenic variation in HA and NA antigens [ 23 ] , and evasion of cellular immune response by amino acid substitutions in cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes of viral proteins, resulting in a decrease in CTL response [ 24 ] .

This attachment mediates internalization of the virus into the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. While an early endosome gradually matures, the acidity in the endosome gradually increases. The low pH activates the integral membrane protein M2 of infl uenza virus, which is a pH-gated proton channel in the viral lipid envelope, conducting protons into the virion interior. Acidifi cation of the virus interior causes weakening of electrostatic interaction, leading to dissociation of M1 proteins from the viral RNP complexes (unpacking of the viral genome). The low pH in late endosomes also triggers a conformational change in HAs, resulting in exposure of their fusion peptides that immediately bind hydrophobically to the endosomal membrane (fusion), followed by release of vRNPs into the cytoplasm. During the course of the endocytic pathway, sialidase of NAs has been shown to be active [ 26 ] , possibly in order to promote HA-mediated fusion [ 27 ] ; however, further studies are needed to determine the exact mechanisms of this NA function. It should be noted that HA fusion will not occur if the HA protein (HA0) is not cleaved to form HA1 and HA2 by a membrane-bound host protease either before or during the release of progeny virions or with incoming viruses prior to endocytosis at the cell surface ( see Subheading 5.2 ) . Infl uenza A virus structure. Infl uenza A virus particles are roughly spherical in shape with sizes ranging from 80 to 120 nm in diameter, and each particle is enveloped by a lipid bilayer derived from the host cell membrane. Inside the envelope, each of eight (\u2212) ssRNA genomic segments are wrapped with multiple nucleoproteins (NPs) and bound to RNA polymerases (PB1, PB2, PA) forming the vRNPs. The inner layer of the lipid envelope is attached to M1 molecules bound to vRNPs and to NS2. The outer layer of the lipid envelope is spiked with HA, NA, and M2 molecules with a ratio of about 5/2/1. See color fi gure in the online version The number of nucleotides and that of amino acids may vary depending on the host and strain of infl uenza A virus b NS3 was experimentally found during the adaptation of a human virus within a mouse host [ 19 ] The vRNPs in the cytoplasm are immediately imported into the nucleus most probably by nuclear localization signals in proteins composed of vRNPs, and the viral RNA polymerase transcribes the (\u2212) vRNAs primed with 5\u2032-capped RNA fragments, which are derived from cellular mRNAs by a cap-snatching mechanism, to viral mRNAs and replicates the unprimed (\u2212) vRNAs to complementary RNAs, (+) cRNAs, used as templates to generate (\u2212) vRNAs (transcription and replication). The viral mRNAs are subsequently exported to the cytoplasm for translation into viral proteins by the cellular protein-synthesizing machinery. Viral proteins needed for viral replication and transcription are transported back to the nucleus.

Efforts for prevention of the next pandemic, either by minimization of crossinfection between species or rapid identifi cation of novel strains, constitute an essential and primary step for preventing infl uenza infection in human beings. Interspecies transmission of infl uenza A viruses between animal hosts including pigs, horses, and birds, as well as humans, has occasionally been detected, but successful propagation and transmission in their new host have been restricted. In the past 95 years, only four infl uenza A virus strains led to sustained outbreaks in human populations and started pandemics ( see Table 2 ; also see Fig. 5 ). The pandemic virus induced humans to develop immunity that provides selective pressure and drives the virus to evolve their antigenicity. The resulting 1918-derived H1N1 virus, which had antigenic change annually, caused an epidemic with lower death rates and triggered human immunity to the virus over time. Somehow the 1918-derived H1N1 virus underwent dramatic genetic change with acquisition of three novel gene segments, avian-like H2, N2, and PB1 gene segments, resulting in emergence of the H2N2 pandemic in 1957 and disappearance of the 1918-derived H1N1 virus from circulation.

After that, H1N1 Russian/77 variant became epidemic yearly until the 2009 H1N1 pandemic emerged, and the virus disappeared from humans.

Airborne infl uenza in humans is caused by type A, B, or C, prevalent in the rainy season in several tropical regions, such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil, and in winter (November-April for the Northern Hemisphere and May-October for the Southern Hemisphere), due to virus stability and host vulnerability to infection. Types A and B cause annual epidemic infl uenza typically due to virus antigenic variation (minor change); generally, they do not cause severe disease except in people under conditions as indicated [ 115 , 116 ] . Type C usually causes only mild illness in humans [ 148 ] . Type B is restricted to humans, though occasionally found in seals [ 149 ] and ferrets [ 150 ] , type C can be isolated from humans and pigs and is found in seropositive dogs [ 151 ] , and type A viruses have natural reservoirs in the intestinal tract (40 \u00b0C) of wild birds (harmonious interactions with the virus allowing the production of variety of subtypes without selective pressure) and are transmitted via feces to domestic birds (intestinal tract, 40 \u00b0C) and from domestic birds to other animals (respiratory tract of pigs, 39 \u00b0C) if they are able to fi ne-tune for transmission to and replication in the new host. So far, only H1N1 Spanish/18, H2N2 Japan/57, H3N2 Hong Kong/68, and H1N1 Swine/09 have been successfully established in humans. Currently only H3N2 Hong Kong/68 and H1N1/09 variants are circulating in humans. Epizootic infl uenza A viruses still cross to humans occasionally, and thus qualitative surveillance of the next pandemic zoonoses is needed. See color fi gure in the online version each of which has evolved to prevail with the host attempting to escape from or restrict the infection by various means including host immunity and apoptosis and the virus evolving strategies to block/evade host clearance mechanisms and to support its propagation including entry to the host cell and use of the host cellular machinery for each step of its life cycle [ 153 ] . LPAI and HPAI viruses can sometimes infect other animals but with limited transmission, including wild birds [ 154 ] , pigs [ 75 ] , and humans [ 155 ] , and cause mild to severe and fatal diseases (assessed by the number of severe cases and deaths) depending on the followings: (1) environmental factors, such as cold weather facilitating viral infection, (2) susceptibility and response of each host, which are accounted for by host genetics and other factors including age and health status, and (3) virus strain, with each virus strain having distinct pathogenic profi les in different host species: more research is needed to understand viral pathogenesis. For effi cient transmission in humans, a nonhuman virus acquires mutations through either an adaptation or reassortment mechanism for suffi cient human-tohuman transmission, providing a chance for the virus to further evolve until it can achieve suitable interactions with host factors for effi cient replication and transmission in human populations and eventually leading to a pandemic. Viral factors believed to play key roles in generating an infl uenza virus with pandemic potential are HA and PB2. Homotrimeric HA carries the followings: (1) antigenic sites, which if new, are not recognized by the host immune system, (2) receptor binding sites, which if they have 190D and 225D in H1 HA, 226L together with 228S (or 224K in H5 HA) in H2, H3, H5, or H7 HA, and 226L in H9 HA, are believed to confer virus preferential binding to a human-type receptor, (3) glycosylation sites, which if there is loss of glycosylation at 158-160, are believed to enhance HPAI H5N1 virus binding to a humantype receptor, and (4) stalk domains with T318A or H107Y, possibly being acquired for sustained and effi cient human-to-human transmission of the H5 HA variants. Viral PB2 with 271A together with 627K/591R/701N enhances HA binding to human-type receptors, enhances respiratory droplet transmission, supports viral growth in a mammalian host at 33 \u00b0C, and facilitates effi cient viral replication in the human upper respiratory tract.

HPAI H5N1 viruses have caused sporadic human infections since 1997, and the pandemic phase is currently at level 3 ( see Table 2 , small clusters of disease in people). A new LPAI H7N9 virus reassorted between avian viruses in poultry just crossed species to infect humans in February 2013 and is now (January 2014) at pandemic level 3. Except for the pandemic 1918 virus, past pandemics emerged from an existing human strain picking up new genes (new to human immunity but effi cient replication in the human upper respiratory tract) from an avian and/or swine virus(es). This evidence suggested that new variants that have emerged via reassortment acquire major change in their genetic materials fi tting with a new host condition more easily and faster than do variants that have emerged via point mutations alone, which have gradual changes in their genetic materials. Thus, avoiding intermediate host infection with more than one infl uenza virus strain should be important for preventing/delaying the next pandemic. More knowledge of the molecular requirements of reassortment at levels of viral and host factors could lead to a better understanding of how appropriate viruses emerge, leading to strategies for effi cient prevention and antiviral interventions.

In addition to surveillance of human infection, extensive surveillance of infection of these viruses to other animals and back to migratory birds should be carried out since control of the viral spread into other regions relies on early recognition. Continuing surveillance is important for understanding how a pandemic emerges and establishing strategies for effi cient control and treatment if a pandemic arises as well as for prevention and control of the next pandemic.

( a ) 18 HA subtypes are phylogenetically classifi ed into six clades segregated into two groups as indicated in the chart. ( b ) HA forms a homo-trimeric precursor (HA0) by which each monomer consists of HA1 and HA2 (PDB: 1rd8) and the C-terminus of HA2 anchors each monomer in the viral membrane. It provides four events important for the entry of infl uenza virus into the host cell. ( c ) Antigenicity. HA1 is a major viral antigen with fi ve important antigenic sites as indicated. ( d ) Cleavage. HA0 with a single basic residue is cleaved by extracellular proteases into HA1 (~329 amino acids) and HA2 (~221 amino acids). HA0 with multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site (residues 324-329) in HPAI viruses is cleaved intracellularly in the trans-Golgi compartment by ubiquitous proteases. Two amino acids in the cleavage sites that are critical for the recognition by proteases are underlined . ( e ) Attachment. HA1 carries a receptor binding site at the membrane-distal tip, which is formed by 190-helix, 130-loop, and 220-loop. Amino acid substitutions in this binding site and virus-receptor binding assays revealed two amino acid residues critical for determinants of virus binding preference: at positions 190 and 225 for H1 virus (E190 and G225 HA preferring \u03b12-3 receptors, and D190 and D225 HA favoring \u03b12-6 receptors) and at positions 226 and 228 for H2 and H3 viruses (Q226 and G228 HA preferring \u03b12-3 receptors, and L190 and S225 HA preferring \u03b12-6 receptors).Left panel : Crystal structures of HAs of A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) interactions with 3\u2032SLN (PDB: 3ubq) and with 6\u2032SLN (PDB: 3ubn) and those of A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) interactions with 3\u2032SLN (PDB: 4BSD) and with 6\u2032SLN (PDB: 4BSC). Circular broken lines indicate amino acids that interact with Neu5Ac and are highly conserved among different H1-H16 HA subtypes, except position 155 (V/I for increased binding to Neu5Gc). The other broken lines indicate amino acids involved in interactions with internal sugars of the glycan receptor. ( f ) Fusion. At acidic pH, the cleaved HA in HA1 ( gray )-S-S-HA2 ( green ) form is conformationally changed. The N-terminal HA2 fusion peptide (residues 1-23) buried inside the interior of the HA molecule at neutral pH pops out and is quickly inserted into the host endosomal membrane, leading to membrane fusion (modeled in right panel ).
