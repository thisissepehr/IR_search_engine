An i. p. inoculum of 10 ~ PFU of MCMV was fatal for more than two-thirds of infant mice (1-7 days of age), and disseminated viral infection was documented by isolation of virus from body organs. In contrast, weanling and adult rats did not become ill as a result of infection with a larger inoculum of 10 7 PFU. Itowever, these older MCMV infected rats did show transient reversals of T helper/suppressor cell ratios and alterations of immune cell function as detected by in vitro spleen cell proliferation assays. Seven days after MCMV infection, there was a generalized increase in 3H-thymidine incorporation by spleen cells in both resting (unstimulated) cultures and cultures exposed to mitogens (Con A, PHA, LPS) and to MCMV antigen. At 14 days, the spleen cell proliferation in the unstimulated cultures returned to normal but was depressed compared to controls in response to Con A. These observations show that laboratory rats are susceptible to MCMV infection and that assymptomatic infection may occur and cause transient alterations in lymphocyte subsets and in their reactivity to mitogens.",

The virus pool was prepared by inoculating three week old Swiss-Webster mice intraperitoneally (i. p.) with 104 PFU of salivary gland pool of virus and harvesting salivary glands from survivors 14 days after inoculation. Salivary glands were minced and disrupted by homogenization and a 10 percent suspension was made in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) with 10 percent heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (GIBCO). The suspension was then clarified by centrifugation (1200rpm, 15 minutes) and stored at -80\u00b0C. This pool contained 8.5 \u00d7 10 s PFU/ml infectious virus by plaque assay on mouse embryo fibroblast cell cultures. The final inoculum was found to be free of contamination with mycopIasmas by culture and fluorescent antibody staining. All experimentally infected animals received 0.1 or 0.2 ml of a 10 -I dilution of virus in MEM by i.p. injection.",

Although cytomegaloviruses will occasionally grow in cell cultures derived from different species (KIM and RAre, 1971), infectivity and pathogenicity for other spepies is rare. MCMV appears to represent an exception to this rule. B~UGGE-MAN et al. (1982) reported that MCMV would grow on rat cells and PRISCOTT and TYn~ELL (1982) recently reported that the Osborn strain of MCMV was infectious for infant Sprague-Dawley rats when given by the I. C. route, causing 23 percent mortality. The greater mortality seen in our study was probably related to our use of a larger inoculum of virus (106 vs 103), although virus and rat strain differences are probably also important. Our observations indicate that susceptability of laboratory rats to MCMV infection is not strain specific, and that infeetion can occur after i. p., as well as, i.e. inoculation.",

These changes were smaller in magnitude than the depressive effect on the response to Con A that Boss and WHEELOOK (1975) SaW in mice following infection with MCMV. In an earlier study, HOWARD et al. (1974) reported depressed lymphocyte proliferation in mixed lymphocyte cultures tbllowing MCMV infection of mice. Cytomegalovirus infections of humans have also been associated with depression of lymphocyte reactivity to stimulation with the mitogens Con A and PHA (RI~AI~DO et al., 1980) . The greatest differences between MCMV infected and control animals were seen in response of spleen cells to stimulation with MCMV antigen. This four-to six-fold increase is consistent with a vigorous immune response to eytomegalovirus infection. Our failure to deteet a response to MCMV antigen in control rats injected with mouse salivary gland is further evidence for the specificity of the spleen cell response to MCMV antigen. The lymphocyte response to MCMV antigen was greatest seven days after infection, and a decline in responsiveness to MCMV antigen was seen after the first week, most notably at 14 days. The possibility that active CMV infeetion may decrease the magnitude of the cell-mediated immune response to CMV antigens has been reported to occur in children and adults with CMV infection (REYNOLDS et al., 1979 , LEWN et al., 1979 .",

The general increase in total mononuelear cells observed following MCMV infection suggests that the reversal of Th/Ts ratios in the MCMV-rat model are due primarily to an increase in the Ts population. The marked reversals seen following CMV infections in humans have been associated primarily with increases in Ts lymphoeytes and to a lesser degree with decreases in total Th cells (CARNEY et al., 1981) .

The early (7 day) increase in reactivity of spleen cells following MCMV infection does not seem consistent with an increase in Ts lymphocytes. This discrepancy could be related to the presence of circulating immunostimulating lymphokines shortly after infection and to a relatively delayed appearance of functional Ts cells. Our monoelonal antibodies to the Ts cell subset measure surface antigen markers only and not functional activity. The suppression of responsiveness of spleen cells to Con A at 14 days correlates with an increase in funetionM Ts cell activity at that time and is consistent with the observations of CARNEY et al.
