The data in our study was retrieved through a retrospective review. This type of data collection is inherently associated with certain limitations, arising from variable data entry into the electronic medical records. In addition, the available data on the nutritional status of patients included in this series was limited to albumin levels and BMI. Albumin has been widely established as a standard nutritional serum marker and has been used in numerous studies within the medicine, general surgery, and orthopaedic literature 2,3,5,9-16 . However, our study does not provide any information on clinical nutrition assessment scales or other nutritional serum markers that may be relevant to orthopaedic patients, such as micronutrients. Moreover, our data is limited to patients with femoral shaft fractures. A femur fracture model was chosen for the purpose of this study as we intended to capture a young orthopaedic trauma patient population with high-energy injuries. As femoral shaft fractures are typically the result of a high-energy injury, we feel that our study population appropriately represents this group of patients. However, one must be cautious when extrapolating our data to patient populations with other injury profiles. Our study identified obesity as an independent risk factor for wound complications. However, we also acknowledge that due to the relatively small sample size, our study may be underpowered to detect other significant risk factors for surgical site complications. Finally, the data recorded in this study reflects a single-institution experience. Thus, it must be assumed that prevalence and type of malnutrition is subject to geographic variations. Comparing and contrasting our findings with data from the literature is challenging given the paucity of nutrition studies in this specific patient population. Ihle et al. 21 reported the prevalence of malnutrition to be 22.3% in patients admitted to a German trauma center. Their patient population included both traumatic as well as elective admissions and patients were classified as malnourished using a clinical nutrition assessment scale. Regarding risk factors for malnutrition, our study identified age, female gender, diabetes, smoking, and ASA class 3 o r4 as risk factors for hypoalbuminaemia. This is consistent with previous investigations. Bohl et al. 22 who reported hypoalbuminaemia to be associated with female gender as well as diabetes. In patients undergoing elective total joint arthroplasty. Furthermore, our findings are in accordance with previous investigations in patients with hip fractures which recorded an association between malnutrition and medical co-morbidities 23 . Lastly, poor nutritional status was significantly correlated with older age in our study, which is in line with Ihle et al., who also found their elderly patients to have a higher prevalence of malnutrition 21 . Our study found that obesity was a significant predictor of surgical site complications in orthopaedic trauma patients with high-energy injuries. This is in line with the experience of elective orthopaedic procedures that have reported similar results [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .
