            "text": "A phylogeny has been calculated by maximum likelihood comparisons of the concatenated consensus protein sequences of 29 tobamoviruses shown to be non-recombinant. This phylogeny has statistically significant support throughout, including its basal branches. The viruses form eight lineages that are congruent with the taxonomy of the hosts from which each was first isolated and, with the exception of three of the twenty-nine species, all fall into three clusters that have either asterid or rosid or caryophyllid hosts (i.e. the major subdivisions of eudicotyledonous plants). A modified Mantel permutation test showed that the patristic distances of virus and host phylogenies are significantly correlated, especially when the three anomalously placed viruses are removed. When the internal branches of the virus phylogeny were collapsed the congruence decreased. The simplest explanation of this congruence of the virus and host phylogenies is that most tobamovirus lineages have co-diverged with their primary plant hosts for more than 110 million years, and only the brassica-infecting lineage originated from a major host switch from asterids to rosids. Their co-divergence seems to have been 'fuzzy' rather than 'strict', permitting viruses to switch hosts within major host clades. Our conclusions support those of a coalesence analysis of tobamovirus sequences, that used proxy node dating, but not a similar analysis of nucleotide sequences from dated samples, which concluded that the tobamoviruses originated only 100 thousand years ago.",

            "text": "Knowledge of a pathogen's origin(s) and its rate of evolution provides a crucial framework for understanding its biology. However, for most viruses, this information can only be inferred indirectly, as viruses leave no fossils and so existing populations provide the only certain information of them. Many recent reports of statistical analyses of the gene sequences of viruses collected on different dates conclude that extant viruses have large mutation rates and must therefore have originated in the past few hundred or thousand years, but doubts about these interpretations Sharp and Simmonds 2011; Duch\u00eane, Holmes, and Ho 2014) , and clues of much more ancient origins of some viruses, are forcing a re-think. Much of the doubt has arisen from evidence of viruses or virogenes integrated in the genomes of plants (Bejarano et al. 1996; Geering et al. 2005; Chiba et al. 2011; James et al. 2011; Lefeuvre et al. 2011; Lyttle, Orlovich, and Guy 2011; Kondo et al. 2013; Filloux et al. 2015) and animals (Gifford et al. 2008; Katzourakis et al. 2009; Belyi, Levine, and Skalka 2010a, b; Gilbert and Feschotte 2010; Horie et al. 2010; Taylor et al. 2010 Taylor et al. , 2011 Worobey et al. 2010; Han and Worobey 2012) , where the taxonomy of the integrated genes and their 'hosts' indicates an ancient origin. Attempts to establish ancient origins by phylogenetic evidence of co-divergence of host and virus (e.g. Wu et al. 2008 ) have proven to be more controversial (De Vienne et al. 2013 ). In the tests reported here, we used new methods to re-examine the evidence for and against co-divergence for tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and its relatives in the genus Tobamovirus.",

Holmes (1951) was perhaps the first to comment, albeit indirectly. He noted that the Nicotiana spp. and other solanaceous plants, that responded to infection by TMV in a hypersensitive manner, are all natives of Central and South America, whereas Nicotiana species that are most susceptible to systemic TMV infection are mostly found in North America, southern South America, and Australia. Holmes argued that these differences resulted from the selection of TMV-resistant plant populations in Central and South America, and hence that this region was probably the 'original habitat of tobacco-mosaic virus in prehistoric times'.",

Their sequence relationships, represented as a Darwinian tree, were found to correlate with their serological relationships. If those viral proteins had evolved at much the same rate as similar proteins of cellular organisms (i.e. cf. 1% per million years), then the differences between them suggested that tobamoviruses had origins as ancient as their plant hosts, which first appeared as fossils more than 100 million years ago. This timing has since been supported by several lines of circumstantial evidence (Gibbs 1999; Gibbs et al. 2008 Gibbs et al. , 2010 Gibbs et al. , 2011 , notably the possibility of co-divergence with their longterm eudicotyledonous hosts, because the relationships of the genomes of different tobamovirus species reflects the relationships of their hosts (Lartey, Voss, and Melcher 1996; Gibbs 1999) , and as the relevant host clades diverged at least 100 million years ago (Magall on and Castillo 2009; Magall on, Hilu, and Quandt 2013) , it suggests that the tobamoviruses did too.",

Pag an et al. (2010) used dated samples to estimate that present-day tobamovirus replicase genes evolve at rates similar to those of most other viruses, and concluded that 'under these rates, a conservative estimate of the time of origin of the sampled tobamoviruses is within the last 100,000 years, and hence far more recently than proposed assuming co-divergence'. In contrast, Stobbe et al. (2012) inferred the phylogeny of the genus Tobamovirus using the same algorithms and found that by 'calibrating the virus tree with dates of host divergence . . . resulted in predictions of divergence times of family specific tobamovirus clades that were consistent with the times of divergence of the host plant orders', which 'supports the idea that these viruses have co-diverged with their hosts since radiation from a common ancestor'. Stobbe et al. had thus obtained statistical support from, in essence, proxy 'node dating' that their phylogeny resulted from an ancient co-divergence, however the internal branches of their phylogeny had poor statistical support.",

We used different methods and obtained a tobamovirus phylogeny, that was better supported, especially its internal (basal) branches, and checked its congruence with the hosts' phylogeny. Our aim was to provide independent support, or otherwise, for codivergence. We inferred phylogenies by maximum likelihood (ML), to contrast with those obtained by Bayes coalescence and mentioned above, and we used simple procedures to minimize 'mutational noise' at the tips of the tree, and thereby increase statistical support for the internal branches of the phylogeny; the concatenated amino acid sequences of all three tobamovirus genes were compared rather than individual gene sequences, and the consensus sequences for tobamovirus species were used rather than sequences from individual isolates.",

Wasabi mosaic virus sequences were so close to the youcai mosaic virus population, they were treated as such. The Accession Codes of the 185 sequences in the resulting alignment are given in Supplementary Data Table 1 ; a few tobamoviruses are represented by single sequences, and the 67 for TMV are the most for a single species. The genomic sequences were separated into their constituent ORFs (i.e. the separate genes for the replicase, movement, and CPs, including any overlapping regions of each gene). They were aligned using the encoded amino acids as guide by the TranslatorX server (Abascal, Zardoya, and Telford 2010; http:// translatorx.co.uk) with its MAFFT option. The ORFs were analysed both separately, and in combinations, but mostly as the complete concatenated ORFs (concats) of each genome. The latter were tested for the presence of phylogenetic anomalies using the full suite of options in RDP4 (Martin and Rybicki 2000) . Sites in the aligned protein sequences with more than five gaps were removed using POSORT, a DOS command line program available at http://192.55.98.146/_resources/e-texts/README-POSORT.pdf. Consensus protein sequences were derived for each of the species using the 'Create Consensus Sequence' function in BioEdit (Hall 1999) . This function examines each site in the species alignments and determines whether any amino acid at that site is present at or above the selected frequency and, if one is, records that amino acid in the consensus. When more than one type of amino acid exceeds the selected frequency, then one of those possibilities is chosen at random and recorded in the consensus sequence, and if none exceeds the selected frequency then a gap is recorded.",

            "text": "Three simple strategies were used in an attempt to minimize the 'mutational noise' in individual sequences so that the phylogenetic signal from the basal regions of the tobamovirus tree could be detected more easily. First the gene sequences were translated into the amino acid sequences they encoded to remove synonymous codon differences, which are mostly isolate specific. Next, sites in the sequences that included more than five sequences with an alignment gap were removed to minimize the influence of species-specific indels. Finally, consensus amino acid sequences were derived for each of the twenty-nine species using the 'Create Consensus Sequence' function in BioEdit (Hall 1999 ) over the range from 0 to 100 percent consensus. The relationships of the aligned degapped species concats were assessed using PhyML. Trees calculated from the consensus sequences, unlike those calculated from the nucleotide sequences, had a single unbroken statistically significant pathway through their basal regions. Furthermore, the log-likelihood support for individual trees correlated with the threshold level used to obtain the consensus sequences from which each was inferred; the greater the consensus level of the amino acid sequences, the greater the log likelihood support of the tree (Fig. 2) . Figure 3 shows the topology and branch support for the 100 percent consensus tobamovirus species tree. The unbroken pathway of statistically significant support spans the basal region of the tree (broader branches: SH-support of 1, 0.951, and 1), and links the top right cluster (CMtV through to CGMtMV) to the bottom twin clusters (YMV to StFBV, and TmGMV through to TMV). The other four smaller clusters (top left) form two well-supported pairs, but their attachment to the statistically supported pathway is undecided (SH-support 0.102 and 0), indicating uncertainty in whether they are linked to it as pairs or separately.",

Nonetheless the distribution of primary hosts of the viruses in Fig. 3 , as revealed by their names, is strikingly nonrandom.

Similarly, all the viruses first isolated from cucurbits form a single cluster (top right of Fig. 3) , and similarly the viruses isolated from brassicas, cacti, hibiscuses, legumes, and passifloras; each form their own small clusters in the phylogeny, even though the individual members of most pairs were isolated by different virologists from infected plants that were separated from one another and often found on different continents.",

Three CP genes however appeared to be from phylogenetically distinct tobamovirus taxa; Nigerian tobacco mosaic virus (NTMV; AY137775) was most closely related to, but distinct from TMGMV, tropical soda apple mosaic virus (AY956381) was likewise related to PMMtV, and a distinct CP gene (KF702319) of a CGMMV from luffa was a recombinant of two CGMMV lineages and therefore grouped with neither.

To simulate this possibility the tobamovirus phylogeny (Fig. 3) was modified by collapsing (shortening) its internal (basal) branches while maintaining their terminal (distal) regions and branching pattern. Two levels of shortening were tested (Fig. 4) . First all basal branches were shortened to the level in the phylogeny where the Solanaceae-infecting and Brassica-infecting tobamoviruses diverged. This removed the differences of branch lengths in the basal half of the tree but, as a result, the original Mantel test correlation of 0.786 (P \u00bc 1e\u00c006) decreased to 0.705 (P \u00bc 0.009). In a more stringent test, all lineages were shortened to the basal divergence of each host group (Fig. 4) and, as a result, the correlation decreased to 0.111 (P \u00bc 0.091). By comparison, when the host:virus linkages were completely randomized, the mean correlation of ten tests was 0.0015 (60.040) P \u00bc 0.474 (60.249). These tests indicate that the congruence between the topologies of host and virus phylogenies involves both the basal and distal regions of the virus tree, and that an ancient host switch is significantly more likely than a recent one.",

These results allow us to discuss with more certainty whether the tobamoviruses have codiverged with their hosts or have infected and adapted to preexisting host lineages, because co-diverging viruses and hosts will have trees with similar topology, whereas viruses adapting to pre-existing host lineages will have phylogenies that differ from those of their hosts, as is found with many plant viruses (e.g. potyviruses; Gibbs, Nguyen, and Ohshima 2015) . Therefore, the fact that most of the tobamoviruses form three groups of lineages that are congruent with the three groups of eudicotyledonous host plant lineages, asterids, rosids, and caryophyllids, clearly supports the co-divergence conclusion. Furthermore, using a modified Mantel permutation test to compare the phylogenies of nine plant and twenty-nine tobamovirus lineages we obtained strong statistically significant support for the congruence of the host and virus phylogenies, especially when the data for the brassica-infecting tobamoviruses was removed. It is clear that all the tobamoviruses, except those found in brassicas, have probably co-diverged with their eudicotyledonous hosts, since they formed the asterid, rosid, and caryophyllid lineages around 112.9 million years ago (Magall on and Castillo 2009; Magall on, Hilu, and Quandt 2013) . The published conclusion that the tobamoviruses are no more than 100,000 years old (Pag an et al. 2010 ) is probably incorrect, and is based on the assumption that estimates of evolutionary rates and dates calculated for individual virus species, using isolates collected over a few decades at most, can be extrapolated back into deeper evolutionary time. As virus populations are of finite size, selection or random events will constantly prune the population tree over time, and will ensure that current populations are not a fully representative sample of all the ancient populations. Wertheim and Worobey (2009) stated that coalesence methods give dating estimates that 'are seriously compromised by unaccounted-for biases', probably resulting from the combined effects of sequence change saturation and purifying selection (Wertheim and Kosakovsky Pond 2008; Ho et al. 2011; Duch\u00ea ne, Holmes, and Ho 2014) . Furthermore, the evolutionary constraints within stable populations may differ considerably from those that occur during speciation, and/or 'emergence' (Gibbs, Nguyen, and Ohshima 2015) . Wertheim et al. (2013) suggested that new substitution models must be devised and tested, and we suggest that corroborative studies based on more traditional evolutionary correlations, like those we report in this article, are also required.",

One dataset examined was all 185 tobamovirus sequences, and the other was the sixty-seven sequences from the species TMV, that are part of the 185 sequence dataset. For these comparisons, each sequence alignment was separated into two alignments, one consisting of all the codons that only differed synonymously (S changes; Fig. 5A and C), the other the codons that had differed non-synonymously (NS changes; Fig. 5B and D); 51 percent of the codons in the TMV sequences had only S differences and 33 percent were conserved unchanged, whereas in the 185 tobamovirus sequences 92 percent were NS codons and only 7 percent were S. NJ trees calculated from these alignments were then compared by pairwise plots of their patristic distances with NJ trees calculated from the amino acid sequences encoded by the complete sequences. These graphs show the relative rates of accumulation of nucleotide and amino acid changes from the branch tips (bottom left corner) to the base of the tree (top and right sides). Note that if S and NS changes were accumulating at the same rate as the amino acid changes (i.e. the 'nucleotide clocks' were synchronized with their 'amino acid clocks'), then one would expect points in their patristic distance graphs to be clustered along linear diagonals, whereas changes in the relative rates would be indicated by deviation from those diagonals, and a trend asymptotic with the axes would indicate saturation.",

The differences for all sixty-seven TMV sequences ( Fig. 5A and B) are, at most, 0.200 S and 0.293 NS nucleotide s/s and 0.067 amino acid s/s. The clustering of all points >0.25 amino acid s/s in the 185 tobamovirus sequence diagrams (Fig. 5C and D) is broadly parallel to the x-axis indicating that S changes mostly saturate by 0.15 nucleotide s/s. In contrast, NS changes (Fig. 5D) show no sign of saturation, and they trend along a diagonal with a separate final cluster comprised of all the distance comparisons linked through the basal branches of the trees. Note that as the S codons mostly vary only in the third nucleotide position, the sites that actually vary in the S codons saturate at around 0.6 nucleotide s/s. In summary then, changes in S codons dominate the nucleotide changes within species but become saturated probably before the amino acid changes exceed 0.3 s/s. As a result, any phylogenetic information they contain is obscured by saturation before they contribute information to the inferred phylogeny of the base of the tree. In contrast, the NS codons, and the changed amino acids they encode, accumulate more slowly than the S changes. They provide phylogenetic information even in the basal branches of the tree of the known tobamoviruses, and show no evidence of saturation.",

            "text": "The tobamoviruses seem to have co-diverged in a 'fuzzy' rather than 'strict' pattern. This is shown by the tobamoviruses of two plant lineages that are hosts of most (known) tobamovirus species, the Solanaceae and Cucurbitaceae. Over the long term, the tobamoviruses seem to have co-diverged widely within each of these plant taxa rather than tracking the evolution of individual plant species. In the Solanaceae, for example, the genera Anthocercis and Nicotiana are members of the subfamily Nicotianoideae, whereas Brugmansia, Capsicum, Nicotiana, and Solanum (Lycopersicon) are from the sister sub-family Solanoideae (S\u00e4 rkinen et al. 2013 ). These groupings are not congruent with the relationships of the tobamoviruses from these species. Figure 3 shows that those isolated from Anthocercis and Nicotiana (TmGMV, TMV, and YTmMtV) are scattered among those with primary hosts from the Solanoideae. Similarly, the two most closely related cucurbit-infecting tobamoviruses are nested within a cluster in Fig. 3 , but were isolated from species of Cucumis (KGMtMV) and Cucurbita (ZGMtMV), respectively, whereas the others were all from Cucumis species. Fuzziness of co-divergence is also shown by Rehmannia mosaic virus, which is clearly a solanaceous tobamovirus, yet was isolated from a species from the Lamiales, which are close relatives of the Solanales. Fuzzy co-evolution could also explain some anomalies in the topology of the base of the tobamovirus tree, as this part of the tree records events when the proto-tobamovirus population was probably infecting a single protoeudicotyledonous population, for whereas the relationships of the asterid-infecting tobamoviruses and their asterid host families are congruent (Plumeria and FMV are sisters to the others), those of the rosid-infecting tobamoviruses and their hosts are not (legumes and cucurbits are the closest related of the rosid hosts). Nonetheless, the two tobamoviruses from cacti (i.e. caryophyllids) are linked in the basal region of the phylogeny to the asterid-infecting frangipani mosaic virus (host Plumeria: Gentianales), and this is congruent with recent molecular taxonomies of plants, which place the caryophyllids as a sister group of the asterids rather than the rosids (Magall on and Castillo 2009; Jiao et al. 2012; Zimmer and Wen 2013) .",

            "text": "If we accept that the tobamoviruses are at least 110 million years old, then many of the branches in their phylogeny span millions of years, whereas the existing populations of the viruses and their hosts are much more recent. This is clearly shown by the present population of ORSV, a recombinant, which Pag an et al. (2010) showed to have a 'Time to Most Recent Common Ancestor' of 43-47 years, yet acquired its genes from two ancestors that diverged from others around 30 million years ago; so there is no evidence from the existing data when, during that long period, the recombination occurred and gave rise to the proto-ORSV. It is also likely that many of the present tobamovirus populations may have spread quite recently from species within their preferred primary host taxon to their current host species, indeed only two of the viruses in this study were isolated from wild plants in their natural environment; passion fruit mosaic virus from Passiflora incarnata in the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve of Osage Co., OK, USA (Stobbe et al. 2012) , and yellow tailflower mild mottle virus from Anthocercis littorea in south west Western Australia (Wylie, Li, and Jones 2014) . Holmes (1951) noted that TMV had clear host links with the Americas, but this feature is not unique to the tobamoviruses that infect Solanaceae. The cacti, from which two tobamoviruses have been isolated, are iconic Central and South American plants, as too is Plumeria rubra, the host of FMV, so further sampling for tobamoviruses of these plant groups, and other long-lived endemics of that region, especially 'core eudicots', would be of great interest.",

Branches are arranged radially, and are coloured blue, red, or black to show those linked only to rosid, or asterid, or mixed hosts, respectively. The SH-support measure for individual branches is shown, and the branches that have statistically significant support through the base of the tree are bold. The 'ORSV-REP' is where the consensus replicase gene of ORSV diverged, and 'ORSV-MP/CP' is where its consensus MP/ CP concat diverged (see text). Acronyms for the viruses are: BmMtV, Brugmansia mild mottle virus; BPMtV, bell pepper mottle virus; CFMtMV, cucumber fruit mottle mosaic virus; CGMtMV, cucumber green mottle mosaic virus; CmMtV, cactus mild mottle virus; CMtV, cucumber mottle virus; CYMtV, Clitoria yellow mottle virus; FMV, frangipani mosaic virus; HLFtPV, Hibiscus latent Fort Pierce virus; HLSV, Hibiscus latent Singapore virus; KGMtMV, kyuri green mottle mosaic virus; MMV, maracuja mosaic virus; OPV, Obuda pepper virus; PapmMtV, paprika mild mottle virus; PFMV, passion fruit mosaic virus; PmMtV, pepper mild mottle virus; RCNaV, rattail cactus necrosis associated virus; RehMV, Rehmannia mosaic virus; RMV, ribgrass mosaic virus; SHMV, sunn-hemp mosaic virus, StFBV, Streptocarpus flower break virus; TmGMV, tobacco mild green mosaic virus; TMV, tobacco mosaic virus; ToMtV, tomato mottle virus; ToMV, tomato mosaic virus; TVCV, turnip vein-clearing virus; YMV, youcai mosaic virus; YTmMtV, yellow tailflower mild mottle virus; ZGMtMV, zucchini green mottle mosaic virus.",
