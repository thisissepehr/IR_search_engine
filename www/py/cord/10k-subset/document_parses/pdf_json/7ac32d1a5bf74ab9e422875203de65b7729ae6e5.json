CD66a, CD66b, CD66c and CD66d mAb binding to neutrophils triggers an activation signal that regulates the adhesive activity of CD11/CD18, resulting in an increase in neutrophil adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Molecular modeling of CEACAM1 using IgG and CD4 as models has been performed, and three peptides from the N-terminal domain were found to increase neutrophil adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers. The peptides were 14 amino acids in length and were predicted to be present at loops and turns between b-sheets. To better understand the amino acid sequences critical for this biological activity, in the present study we examined the other neutrophil CEACAMs and the highly homologous CEACAM, CEA. Molecular modeling of the N-terminal domains of human CEACAM8, -6, -3 and CEA was performed. Twenty peptides, each 14 amino acids in length, that were homologous to the previously reported peptides from the N-domains of CEACAM1, were synthesized and tested for their ability to alter neutrophil adhesion. Only one new peptide, from",

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family members appear to play a role in a wide variety of normal and pathological processes, including: cancer, embryonic development, bacterial infection, viral infection, in\u00afammation, pregnancy and cell adhesion (1\u00b14). The CEACAM gene family belongs to the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene superfamily (for review see Refs 1,3\u00b16). Structurally, each of the human CEACAMs contains one N-terminal domain of 108\u00b1110 amino acid residues, homologous to Ig variable domains, followed by a differing number (0\u00b16) of Ig C2-type constant-like domains. The structure of the N-domain is predicted to be a stacked pair of b-sheets with nine b-strands (7). CD66 mAbs react with members of the CEACAM family (8\u00b117). In CD terminology, mAbs belonging to the CD66 cluster are classi\u00aeed according to their reactivity with each family member, as indicated by a lower case letter after`CD66' as follows: CEACAM3, but not CEA, are expressed on human neutrophils, where they are`activation antigens' in that their surface expression is increased following neutrophil activation by various stimuli. CD66a, CD66b, CD66c and CD66d mAb binding to the neutrophil surface trigger an activation signal that regulates the adhesive activity of CD11/CD18, and increases neutrophil adhesion to HUVECs (27\u00b132,35). CEACAM1 is frequently downregulated in carcinomas (36\u00b140), and may function as a tumor suppressor in some models of cancer (41\u00b146). CEACAMs are also important in bacterial infections, where pathogenic Neisseria meningitidis and N. gonorrhea interact with CEACAMs via Opa proteins. The binding site for these Opa proteins has been localized to the N-domains of CEACAMs (47\u00b156). CEACAM1 also functions as a receptor for murine hepatitis virus (57\u00b161).",

Clearly, dimerization of CEACAMs could affect binding of other signal regulating molecules.The mechanisms by which CEACAM family members transmit signals (e.g. activation in neutrophils or growth regulating signals in epithelial cells and carcinomas) are unclear. In addition to the considerations described above, CEACAM1 is phosphorylated in neutrophils and colon cancer cells(12,62,63,66), and protein kinase and phosphatase activity may associate with CEACAMs(62,64,65).CEACAM1 contains an immune tyrosine inhibitory motif (ITIM), as well as a motif similar to an immune tyrosine activating motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain (2,62), and phosphorylation of ITAMs and ITIMs can result in binding of protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases, respectively, which can modify signal transduction (64,65). CEACAM family members appear to be involved in a wide variety of important biological processes, and their differential expression provides the possibility for diverse interactions. For example, CEACAM1, CEACAM8, CEACAM6 and CEACAM3, but not CEA, are expressed on neutrophils; CEA is expressed on many tumor cells but not leukocytes; CEACAM8 is expressed on neutrophils but not epithelial cells; CEACAM6 is expressed on both neutrophils and epithelial cells (reviewed in Refs 1,2,4,13). In addition, the surface expression of these molecules in other cells may also be regulated; for example, CEACAM1 expression is induced on HUVECs by c-IFN (14). CEACAM members may play an important role in in\u00afammation, as each of the CEACAM family members expressed on neutrophils are capable of transmitting activation signals, CEACAM1 is also present on T-lymphocytes and a subset of NK cells (86), and CEA expression by tumor cells is correlated with resistance to NK/LAK cell mediated lysis (87,88). It is possible that CEACAM family members could contribute to the immunosuppression often found in patients with cancer. Some bacteria bind to neutrophil CEACAMs (13,47\u00b156,89,90), and this interaction may result in signal transduction resulting in modi\u00aecation of neutrophil activity. It is possible that surface expression of CEACAM family members may modify the signal transduction capabilities of other cell surface CEACAM molecules. In summary, the data suggest that three peptide motifs from the N-terminal domain of CEACAM1 are involved in the interaction of CEACAM1 with other ligands, and can initiate signal transduction in neutrophils. One peptide motif from the N-domain of CEA can also initiate signal transduction in neutrophils, and this may represent a region of CEA that can interact with CEACAM1, CEACAM6, or other ligands. Each of the four active CEACAM peptides has a unique amino acid sequence. The amino acid substitutions in the homologous peptides from other CEACAMs, compared with that found in the active peptides, that result in loss of activity provide further information on the critical amino acids generating the sequence necessary for biological activity.(1992) Identi\u00aecation of three new genes and estimation of the carcinoembryonic antigen family.

To determine if an alteration in the surface expression of CD11/CD18 could contribute to the effect of the CD66e-3 peptide on neutrophil adhesion, CD11b expression was analyzed by\u00afow cytometry. Because CD11 and CD18 are translocated to the cell surface only when they are complexed with each other, the use of a directly labeled CD11b mAb was used to demonstrate upregulation of CD18 as well as CD11b. When neutrophils were incubated with HBSS for 15 min at 378C and then reacted with a PE-labeled CD11b mAb, CD11b expression was readily detected by\u00afow cytometry (MCF5584) (Fig. 3, left, upper panel).
