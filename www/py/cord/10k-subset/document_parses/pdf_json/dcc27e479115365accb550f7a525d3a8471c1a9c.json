[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Additionally, even though there is a well-recognized association between GVHD and protection from relapse, 6 severe acute GVHD does not confer protection from relapse of leukemia 4, 6 and is more apt to be associated with poor survival. 7, 8 Compounding the problem, those undergoing reduced intensity SCT are often elderly or have comorbidities, which puts them at significant risk for mortality in the event of developing severe GVHD. In addition, their related donor pool is limited, resulting in greater reliance on unrelated donors and increasing the risk of GVHD.

However, despite the improvement in lymphoid engraftment, relapse and late opportunistic infections limited successful outcomes in patients treated in the second cohort. Grades III and IV acute GVHD remain major risk factors for treatment-related mortality in allogeneic SCT recipients conditioned with reduced intensity regimens such as 2 Gy TBI and fludarabine (hazard ratio 9.5; 95% confidence interval 4.7, 19) . 4 Patients receiving URD transplants fare poorly, with a 15 and 26% cumulative incidence of grades III and IV acute GVHD at 1 year and a corresponding mortality rate of 18 and 29% reported with two different GVHD prophylaxis regimens consisting of extended course MMF and CsA. 5 To address this problem, the group at Massachusetts General Hospital has adapted their murine model to the clinical setting, using CY, thymic irradiation and either ATG or MEDI-507 (a-CD2) to facilitate allogeneic SCT with matched and mismatched related donors, reporting a low incidence of grades II-IV acute GVHD (29%). 27 However, nearly 50% of patients required DLI for mixed donor-recipient chimerism. A more recent update of this trial reported a 27% incidence of graft loss among 82 patients, with graft loss occurring over the first few months with declining T-cell chimerism despite DLI. 28 Similar to the findings reported in this trial, we observed a low incidence of acute and de novo chronic GVHD in our patients; however, a number of patients developed GVHD after DLI given for disease persistence or progression, negating the beneficial effect of acute GVHD risk reduction seen early on following transplant.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1331, "end": 1339, "text": "4.7, 19)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1342, "end": 1343, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1619, "end": 1620, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1943, "end": 1945, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2218, "end": 2220, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We also observed poor outcomes in most patients who failed to achieve near complete donor chimerism (X90% donor-derived hematopoiesis) early on following transplantation. This was most likely attributable to the high dose of ATG used in our study, with resultant significant delay in lymphoid recovery secondary to T-cell depletion contributing to both graft loss as well as relapse seen in these patients. Although delaying stem cell infusion following ATG and intensifying host immunosuppression by increasing the TBI dose in the second cohort has resulted in more robust lymphoid engraftment, the disease relapse rate remained high in this later cohort of patients. This may largely be due to the poor prognosis of the patients we treated, that is, patients with persistent or untreated high-risk MDS, AML and post-autograft recurrence of multiple myeloma, but a role for in vivo T-cell depletion in producing higher relapse rate cannot be excluded. It remains to be determined whether this strategy would be more successful in patients traditionally treated with non-myeloablative transplants, that is, heavily pretreated chemotherapy-sensitive CLL, follicular and mantel cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and first-remission multiple myeloma. Other patients may require a greater degree of pretransplant cytoreduction before undergoing ATGbased non-myeloablative conditioning.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Despite the negative outcome of this trial, there are several lessons to be learned from this study. Even though moderate levels of residual recipient chimerism (410%) early on appear to confer a greater risk of treatment failure in our small heterogeneous group of patients, several elderly patients with MRD SCT maintained disease remission even though they had mixed recipient-donor hematopoietic chimerism (5-10% recipient DNA), suggesting a beneficial impact of residual host hematopoiesis. In a murine allograft model, superior DLI-mediated antitumor effect was observed in mice which were mixed chimeric as opposed to full donor chimeric, with the host MHC class I expression being critical for these antitumor responses. 29 Greater effectiveness of adoptive immunotherapy in the setting of mixed chimerism is also illustrated by canine studies in which DLI given to recipients of BMT from DLA-identical donors, following 10 Gy TBI and ATG, resulted in conversion to full donor chimerism without GVHD, when given around day 60, whereas earlier infusion resulted in lethal GVHD. 30 Another explanation for this observation may be through invoking the immune homeostatic effects of lympho-depletion, which is recognized for its immunostimulatory effect in patients undergoing therapy for cancer and may indeed have a similar role in the setting of T-cell-depleted non-myeloablative allografts incorporating strategies to perform adoptive immunotherapy with DLI. 31, 32 All these lines of reasoning suggest a potential beneficial effect of adoptive immunotherapy with DLI on the platform of early mixed chimerism achieved by T-cell-depleting regimens. Such conditioning regimens may in the future also allow an assessment of tumor-specific vaccines in the context of an allogeneic SCT.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 729, "end": 731, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1085, "end": 1087, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1467, "end": 1470, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1471, "end": 1473, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Establishment of early donor-derived hematopoiesis without significant GVHD in the setting of T-cell depletion suggests a role for the KIR-dependent activity of donorderived NK cells in establishing donor hematopoiesis. In our patients a rapid normalization of NK cell counts following transplantation was observed. This early NK cell recovery may be particularly useful in recipients of URD transplants, where a trend toward fewer relapses in patients with missing KIR Ligands, belonging to HLA-C1, C2 or Bw4 sero-groups, has been observed; 33 indeed, our small data set seems to mirror this observation. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that patients receiving T-cell replete URD allografts are more likely to have poor KIR reconstitution when compared with recipients of T-cell depleted URD BM, with the improved KIR reconstitution correlating with improved survival. 34 The authors of that study concluded that T cells in the graft affect early NK cell development in recipients of unmanipulated BM, skewing it toward a KIR-deficient CD56 hi IFN-g-secreting phenotype, contributing to GVHD. We speculate that the robust engraftment without acute GVHD that we see following URD hematopoietic SCT may be attributed to ATG affecting NK cell reconstitution by altering the T-cell content of the graft. The rapid reconstitution of CD16/ 56 dim NK cells that we observe may also be related to the positive outcomes seen in URD recipients with missing KIR ligands, as these cells are known to mediate cytotoxicity against tumor targets. 35 Given the nearly universal disparity in KIR genotypes in unrelated donorrecipient pairs, the use of URD with such ATG-based conditioning for transplanting high-risk elderly patients becomes an attractive option as a means of maximizing the potential for GVL effects while reducing GVHD risk. 36, 37 Donor-recipient tolerance achieved through SCT is being intensively investigated as a means for achieving solid organ allograft tolerance.
