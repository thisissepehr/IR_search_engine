Methods: From December 2000 to November 2002 in the Section of Radiology I of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Modena, Italy), 11 patients with transplanted bowel were studied with different methods: traditional radiologic evaluation with contrast agent (all patients), evaluation of transit time with radiopaque markers (five patients), ultrasonographic (US) evaluation of the intestinal wall and Doppler US of the vascular axes (five patients), computed tomographic (CT) evaluation (all patients), and magnetic resonance (MR) evaluation of the bowel and the vascular axes (five patients). Traditional contrast examination enabled evaluation of the gastroesophageal transit and cardia functionality; anatomy and integrity of the anastomoses (proximal and distal); time of gastric emptying; morphology, tone, and kinesis of the transplanted small bowel loops and time of global transit. The study of transit with radiopaque markers was carried out in five patients to define the time of transit through the entire transplanted bowel, confirm recovery of intestinal motility, and identify possible abnormalities. The US examination was carried out in five patients to evaluate the morphology, thickness, and echo structural features of the intestinal loops. Color Doppler was performed to visualize the superior mesenteric artery and a wall arteriole of the sampled loop.

The protocol for MR evaluation of the bowel included coronal single-shot fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequences, axial and/or sagittal single-shot fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequences, coronal fast multiplanar spoiled gradient-echo (FMP-SPGR) sequences, coronal FMPSPGR sequences with and without administration of intravenous paramagnetic contrast agent, and axial or sagittal FMPSPGR fat-saturated sequences performed after dynamic gadolinium administration. Results and conclusion: The study of transit with radiopaque markers was useful in patients with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction because it identified recovery and normalization of motility. Traditional contrast examination of the gastrointestinal tract continues to play an important role in transplanted patients because it is a simple examination that allows evaluation of the graft anatomy and recovery of motility of the residual native bowel and the transplanted loops. Moreover, it plays a crucial role in early detection of major postoperative complications such as intestinal obstruction, perforation, fistulas, and anastomotic complications (stenosis and dehiscence). CT examination is crucial for the detection of fluid collections, abscesses, and fistulas because it can serve as a guide of drainage and during follow-up of patients with Gardner syndrome can be used to investigate all possible sites in which desmoids might arise in addition to their relation to the graft. Because patients with transplanted bowel are generally rather a young population of reproductive age and because of technologic advances, MR may represent an effective method that does not use ionizing radiation and can therefore substitute for traditional radiologic evaluation. US represents a quick examination technique that is easily available and well tolerated by patients, and it has a role to play in the follow-up of transplanted patients and in the identification of major postoperative complications.

Although the absorptive capacity of the transplanted bowel has been dealt exhaustively by the current literature, the issue of motility has not been analyzed in depth [1] . Intestinal motility is regulated by a delicate and complex neural enteric system that can be easily damaged, even during technically successful surgery. However, the bowel can react by activating compensatory mechanisms through neurohormonal feedback that helps it regain adequate motility [1] . Some studies have demonstrated that graft motility between meals, although not coordinated with that of the residual native bowel, remains intact. Nevertheless, despite the importance of this motility in preventing bacterial overgrowth, motility after meals regulates intestinal transit and, hence, influences nutrient absorption. A recent study conducted in animal models concluded that, despite complete extrinsic denervation and prolonged ischemia, the enteric nervous system can generate and sustain a coordinated motility after meals [1] . According to the study, the only anomaly that can arise is an accelerated transit due to increased tone (or nonrelaxation) of the transplanted ileal smooth muscle. In various works reported in the literature, intestinal denervation has been associated with accelerated transit, abnormal propulsive contractions, and giant, migrating motor complexes. However, the exact meaning of these associations is unknown. Transit remains accelerated for 2 months after transplantation and gradually decreases. In some cases, accelerated transit can cause malabsorption.

The first examination is usually performed 1 to 2 weeks after surgery to analyze graft anatomy and proximal and distal enteric anastomoses and to study motility by analysis of gastric emptying and of tone and kinesis of small bowel loops. In addition, morphologic analysis of intestinal loops is important. The caliber and pattern of the mucosa can be altered in several complications such as acute and chronic rejection and intestinal infections. The traditional radiologic study with contrast agent is potentially useful in early diagnosis of major complications of transplantation such as anastomotic dehiscence, obstructions, fistulas, motility alterations, rejection, and enteric infections [4] . Unless a particular complication is suspected, checkups are repeated on a monthly basis until every clinical and radiologic finding appears normal.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 994, "end": 997, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the group of patients studied, proximal anastomosis appeared to gastroesophageal, gastrojejunal, or duodenojejunal, whereas the distal anastomosis appeared to be ileorectal or ileocolic.

Intestinal peristalsis can be noticed from the very first checkups, even though the transit time varies from individual to individual more notably than in nontransplanted patients. A certain delay in gastric emptying can be observed, particularly in the first 2 months after transplantation. However, this aspect tends to improve and usually disappears within 6 months. In multivisceral transplants, pyloroplasty usually attenuates gastric atony that might arise in the early postoperative phase. At an early stage, a rather common finding is represented by thickening of mucosal folds, which is visible in the early postoperative months, and which, as reported in the literature, may be related to the presence of a wall edema due to surgery, an ischemic insult to the graft, and lymphatic stasis resulting from interruption of lymphatic drainage [4] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 304, "end": 307, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 308, "end": 310, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1161, "end": 1164, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In six patients, contrast examination of the bowel demonstrated intestinal obstruction that was subsequently confirmed surgically.

The development of adhesions is a rather frequent complication because transplanted patients undergo several abdominal surgeries before transplantation. This dramatically increases the risk to develop viscero-visceral and wall-visceral adhesions in the abdomen and pelvic cavity, which are responsible for graft displacement in the abdomen and actual interruptions of transit. In one case of adhesive bands, surgical exploration, other than indicating the presence of several adhesions, showed a retractile mesenteritis that was characterized by marked thickening of the mesenteric root, thickened and conglomerated graft loops, and an ileal loop matted by an adhesive band.

Subsequently, a more specific study of duodenal loops disclosed remarkable contrast leakage at the level of the front wall, in the area between the second and third duodenal sections.

At the thoracic level, lung parenchyma can be extensively involved; at the abdominal level, the liver and gastrointestinal tract are the areas more frequently affected by the disease. Imaging of PTLD is similar to that of lymphoproliferative disorders that develop in other conditions of immunodeficiency, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Both cases are characterized by marked extra lymph nodal involvement (80%). Some investigators have reported a marked tendency of lymphoproliferative disorders to develop in the same anatomic region as the transplanted organ, with involvement of the graft itself [8] . In contrast, some investigators [9] have pointed out that this is true for lung and liver transplants, where there is a prevalent involvement of the thorax and abdomen, but not, e.g., for heart transplant, where thoracic and graft involvements are rare. In our patients, we identified two cases of PTLD. In one case, we observed a prevalent involvement of lymph nodes in the cervical mediastinal area; in the other case, the areas affected were rhinopharyngeal and pulmonary parenchymal. In both cases, the most evident manifestations occurred outside the anatomic region where the graft was located, without any involvement of the graft itself. In addition, in our cases, CT was the reference technique for the detection and evaluation of all affected sites and for the monitoring of the disease over time.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1015, "end": 1018, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1867, "end": 1870, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1905, "end": 1908, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 651, "end": 657, "text": "Fig. 6", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "CT can easily highlight hematomas and often permits, by intravenous contrast study performed in different vascular phases, detection of vascular leaks.

In recent years, the use of MR has widened significantly thanks to the introduction of sequences with respiratory gating or quick sequences that are performed in apnea to prevent respiratory artifacts. The value of MR imaging in patients with inflammatory intestinal disease or neoplasm of the small bowel has been widely documented [12] . The intrinsic ability to contrast soft tissues, the possibility of multiplanar studies (the coronal plane is the best for the study of small bowel anatomy), the availability of axial images for a panoramic study of extraluminal pathologic conditions, dynamic sequences after intravenous contrast administration for evaluation of vascular axes, and contrast enhancement of the intestinal wall are among the main advantages of MR, not to mention the absence of exposure to ionizing radiations [12, 13] . The existing literature stresses in particular the role of some sequences, such as SSFSPE T2-weighted, breath-hold T2-weighted turbo spin-echo, and SPGR T2-weighted sequences in the coronal plane with and without contrast agent, whose application is long established in the functional and morphologic study of the intestinal wall in Crohn disease [12] [13] [14] .

Moreover, echographic wall stratification, characterized by five different layers, alternately hyper-and hypoechoic, appeared normal. Color Doppler depicted blood flow, which was adopted as a reference parameter, i.e., resistance index, which was calculated for the mesenteric artery and a peripheral arteriole sampled on the wall of an intestinal loop. In our small group of patients, we observed high variability between resistance indexes. In particular, in one patient, a decrease in resistance index at the level of the wall vessels was apparent without any visible consequence on mesenteric vessels. In that patient, initial signs of rejection had been identified 2 days previously during endoscopic and biopsy controls. Inflammatory intestinal pathologies have been reported to identify a wall hyperemia, which Doppler visualizes as low-resistance flow signals. In addition, a sharp decrease in peripheral resistance was related to an initial hyperemia in one patient.
