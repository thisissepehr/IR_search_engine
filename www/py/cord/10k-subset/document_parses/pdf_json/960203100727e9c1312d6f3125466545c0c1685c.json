This new track of outbreak science describes the functional use of models, clinical knowledge, laboratory results, data science, statistics, and other advanced analytical methods to specifically support public health decision making between and during outbreak threats. Outbreak scientists work with decision makers to turn outbreak data into actionable information for decisions about how to anticipate the course of an outbreak, allocate scarce resources, and prioritize and implement public health interventions. Here, we make three specific recommendations to get the most out of modeling efforts during outbreaks and epidemics. Together these recommendations constitute the foundation of an integrative field that is \"outbreak science\": 1: Be prepared: Establish functional model capability and foster relationships before the emergency begins In many of the recent communicable disease public health emergencies, a suite of academic and government modelers produced important analyses, but few were specifically tasked and funded to do so in a coordinated, functional fashion. The reactive (rather than prospective) mobilization of modelers and computational epidemiologists in public health emergencies is not new. Rapid development and deployment of infectious disease models was important during the 2009 influenza pandemic, chikungunya, and SARS [9] [10] [11] . Models helped decision makers to understand the likely trajectory of the outbreaks, the risk of international spread, and the potential impact of interventions. Although identified as influential at the time, few if any investments in permanent capabilities to integrate such analyses into the decision-making process have followed.",

Understanding the functional relationship between the public health end-users and model developers is critical to improving capacity during outbreaks. A recent pilot study (n = 29 respondents) in Australia suggests a disconnect between model end-users and model developers, with overall infrequent use of modeling in public health practice due to factors such as a lack of in-house modeling expertise, variable trust and/ or comprehension of model outputs, and uncertainty regarding whether models could answer the most important operational questions on the most relevant temporal and spatial scale 13 . Similarly, state and local health officials in the US reported reluctance in translating pandemic influenza epidemic models into public health action, despite the respondents' familiarity with such models 14 . More recently, a limited evaluation of 39 influenza public health practitioners from three US public health organizations indicated that approximately one in five had direct communication with modelers, 67% felt that models should be more relevant to public health questions, and 59% wanted more frequent communication with model developers 15 .",

Without opportunities to gain experience, modelers do not necessarily understand or anticipate the needs and preference of decision makers. Improved communication and collaboration between the two stakeholder groups would improve the quality and utility of models and the decisions they support. This suggestion is not novel, yet the need clearly remains in 2019 13, 15 . To improve these connections, we advocate systematically measuring perceptions of both model end-users and model developers to identify what are the key barriers to functional model development and implementation. For example, stakeholder surveys, focus groups and other qualitative data can identify whether the public health priorities as interpreted by model developers are aligned with end-users, whether end-users trust or prefer particular models (or modelers) over others, and whether major gaps are present in end-user modeling literacy and/or model developer communication.",

We call for cross-cutting outbreak science fellowship programs in which epidemic modelers partner with experts from other disciplines including clinicians, basic scientists, computational biologists, veterinarians, entomologists, epidemiologists, environmental scientists, and those in operational public health. Ideally, these programs would involve rotations in the field to experience challenges like rapidly changing information, varying quality of data, critical inter-personal relationships between and within institutions, and evolving public health priorities. The CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service program, a good model for training public health practitioners in applied epidemiology, could serve as a template for a similar program that provides academic modelers and other stakeholders with training in applied infectious disease modeling. Furthermore, training programs of this kind can facilitate research opportunities, as called for in recommendation #2, that investigate relationships and processes between modelers and end users, document current challenges to model implementation during epidemic response, and identify best practices needed to promote integration of modeling into public health.",

To be successful, building working relationships is as necessary as building quantitative modeling capacity. Rather than waiting for the next pandemic, we should use opportunities between pandemics to fine tune model development and implementation and formally measure and redress any disconnect between model developers and model-users.",

With sufficient investment in the development and growth of the field, those trained in 'outbreak science' will become vital contributors in helping public health professionals navigate the many difficult decisions that come with infectious disease emergencies. Additionally, they will serve as a key link between quantitative modelers and public health decision makers in an era of increasing epidemic threats. ",
