Then, VE-VPs (n = 93) patients were 1:1 propensity matched to D-VPs (n = 93) based on age; source of admission (emergency room, general wards, intensive care unit); chronic and acute comorbidities; and lactate, heart rate, systolic, and diastolic pressure at vasopressor start. A riskadjusted Cox proportional hazard model was fitted to assess the association between VE-VPs and day 28 mortality. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed also including those patients requiring VP support for less than 6 h. Results: Patients subjected to VE-VPs received significantly less resuscitation fluids at vasopressor starting (0[0-510] vs. 1500[650-2300] mL, p < 0.001) and during the first 8 h of resuscitation (1100 vs. 2600[1600-3800] mL, p < 0.001), with no significant increase in acute renal failure and/or renal replacement therapy requirements. VE-VPs was related with significant lower net fluid balances 8 and 24 h after VPs. VE-VPs was also associated with a significant reduction in the risk of death compared to D-VPs (HR 0.31, CI95% 0.17-0.57, p < 0.001) at day 28.

In fact, information about the \"pre-vasopressor\" period in septic shock is quite limited because most of the current evidence on early goal-directed resuscitation comes from randomized controlled trials in which patients received a pre-determined amount of fluids as a prerequisite to be included (5-7). We retrospectively studied this \"pre-vasopressor\" phase in patients with sepsis requiring VP support for at least 6 h, followed by a sensitivity analysis including a minority using VP support for less than 6 h. Those in which VP was started < 1 h from the first fluid load (VE-VPs) received significantly less amount of resuscitation fluids at both pre-vasopressor and early resuscitation period, the net fluid accumulation at 8 and 24 h was significantly lower and they also had a significant lower mortality.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Observational studies and post hoc analysis of previous clinical trials suggest that greater accumulation of fluids is related with worse clinical outcomes [12, 18, 44] , which agree with our results. Such effect of VE-VPs on the lower net fluid accumulation in our study was apparently mediated by the limiting fluid administration more than by increased fluid elimination. Although the lower mortality of patients in which norepinephrine was precociously initiated might have several potential explanations, a more rapid restoration of blood flow in combination with lower fluid accumulation could early restitute tissue perfusion and avoid the harm mediated by fluid overload. Interestingly, VE-VPs patients had the same blood pressure at time of first fluid bolus as patients with D-VPs, suggesting that the differences between groups were related to the timing of vasopressor initiation more than to the severity of hypotension. All patients included in our study followed a quantitative resuscitation protocol in which fluid responsiveness was repeatedly tested during the initial resuscitation period aiming to achieve some tissue perfusion goals. Remarkably, although receiving lower amount of resuscitation fluids for achieving the same resuscitation goals, patients in the VE-VPs group had a significantly lower mortality, which is in line with studies showing that norepinephrine may reduce preload dependency [45] due to recruitment of preload reserve from the unstressed blood volume, thus leading to lower fluid requirement. Unfortunately, although biologically plausible, the observational nature of our study does not allow confirming whether a more precocious mobilization from nonstressed to stressed blood volume by early introduction of vasopressors might have influenced the requirement of resuscitation fluids.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 156, "end": 160, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 161, "end": 164, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 165, "end": 168, "text": "44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1421, "end": 1425, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A previous observational study suggested that delayed introduction of VP support after initial fluid loading [46] might be related with worse clinical outcomes.

In contrast, in our study, hypotension was rapidly corrected in both VE-VPs and D-VPs groups, and the time-course of mean arterial pressure was quite similar between them, at least after vasopressor introduction. Nevertheless, time elapsed between the first hypotension episode and the introduction of VP support was significantly shortened in the VE-VPs, which is in line with studies suggesting that shorter hypotension times are associated with better outcomes in septic shock [33, 34] .

A recent randomized trial addressed the issue about the early introduction of norepinephrine in patients with septic shock [36] . Nevertheless, very low and non-titrated doses of norepinephrine were used while the idea of administering a fixed dose of fluids before to start of the \"non-blinded\" vasopressor support was maintained. Importantly, the rate of achievement of lactate clearance after 6 h of resuscitation was extremely low and did not differ from those not receiving the study low dose of vasopressor. In contrast with this, our patients received a MAP-targeted dose of norepinephrine along with other resuscitation maneuvers directed to restore tissue perfusion. Furthermore, early introduction of VPs in our study Early use of vasopressors could change the course of hemodynamics in septic shock. A recent experimental model of endotoxemia suggested that fluid resuscitation might paradoxically increase vasopressor requirements compared with an early and isolated use of VP [11] . In the same line, our data suggests that lower doses of norepinephrine could be required when VP support is introduced very early, at least during the first 6 h of resuscitation (see Additional file 1: Figure S4 ).

Indeed, fluids were administered based on the same criteria of fluid responsiveness in all patients. In addition, this study is not a probe for the \"1-h bundle\" recently proposed [8] but rather a hypothesis generator about the benefits of early start of vasopressors in septic shock, emphasizing that patients of the VE-VPs group received the immediate start of norepinephrine without completing a predefined volume or resuscitation fluids.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 565, "end": 568, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "All"}, {"text": "Nevertheless, important limitations should be mentioned. First, the nature of this study and, therefore, the lack of control by randomization and blinding might limit the validity of conclusions. Admittedly, although propensity scores were constructed incorporating baseline characteristics likely influencing the decision for an early start of VP support, other nonidentifiable potential factors might not have been included. In addition, the small sample size introduces a risk of missing important differences at baseline that might contribute to the observed differences in mortality instead of early vasopressor introduction. Second, also due to the nature of our study, it is not possible to establish causal mechanisms leading to differences in clinical outcomes between the groups. Nevertheless, we speculate that the combination of shortening of hypotension time, lower pre-vasopressor and post-vasopressor fluid requirements, and, consequently, lower net fluid accumulation could have influenced clinical outcomes. Third, acute renal failure, acute renal replacement therapies, and digital ischemia were easily tracked. However, other adverse consequences of the early use of vasopressors cannot be ruled out. Fourth, we are not able to identify if the decision of the early start of vasopressors relied on some particular doctors, which could constitute a potential factor of confusion. Finally, although the single-center design might restrict a potential generalization of our results, exclusions were very limited so that this trial reflects the overall spectrum of patients with septic shock.
