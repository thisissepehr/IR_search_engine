Median CD4 ? count was 330 cells/lL (IQR 131-589 cells/lL). 41 % had AIDS at time of diagnosis. 94 % of patients presented with locoregional disease and 6 % with late stage breast cancer. 52 % had ER ? tumors. 6 % had HER-2/neu tumor expression and 21 % had triple negative disease. The 5 year PFS was 50 % (95 % CI 34-64 %), the 5 year OS was 44 % (95 % CI 29-58 %), and the Breast cancer-specific survival was 57 % (95 % CI 40-70 %).

It is well established that since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals has increased, while the incidence of both opportunistic infections and AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs) has dramatically decreased [4, 5] With this shift, the rate of Non AIDS-Defining Cancers (NADCs) has risen and now accounts for the majority of cancers in HIVinfected persons [6] . For breast cancer, however, initial reports documented a decrease incidence in cohorts from HIV patients relative to the general population [7] [8] [9] [10] . Later studies have suggested that the risk has increased significantly in the last years and is now approaching the risk of the general population [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .
