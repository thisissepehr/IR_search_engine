Here, we evaluated whether HBV RNA could act as an early monitor of pegylated interferon responses. Methods We analyzed a phase 3, multicenter, randomized cohort of 727 HBeAg-positive non-cirrhotic patients receiving a 48-week treatment of PegIFN\u03b1-2a or PegIFN\u03b1-2b and a 24-week treatment-free follow-up. Serum levels of HBV RNA, HBV DNA, HBeAg, and HBsAg were measured at weeks 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72. Results HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg loss at week 72 were observed in 217 (29.8%) and 21 (2.9%) patients, respectively. During the 48-week treatment, HBV RNA decreased more rapidly than HBV DNA and HBsAg, but HBV RNA and HBeAg shared similar dynamics with positive correlations. Multivariate regression analyses consistently revealed the significance of HBV RNA at weeks 0, 12, 24, and 48 to monitor HBeAg seroconversion but not HBsAg loss. Although baseline HBV RNA only showed a modest AUC performance, HBV RNA with a significant increase of AUC at week 12 outperformed other HBV biomarkers to forecast HBeAg seroconversion (p value < 0.05). HBV RNA \u2264 1000 copies/mL was an optimized cutoff at week 12 that offered better prediction than other HBV biomarkers. This optimized cutoff plus patient age, HBV genotype B, and HBeAg offered a strong estimation of HBeAg seroconversion (accuracy 95.2%, true negative rate 99.8%). Conclusion HBV RNA at week 12 is an effective monitor of HBeAg seroconversion in HBeAg-positive patients treated with pegylated interferons.",

HBeAg seroconversion rates were generally higher in HBeAg-positive patients receiving interferon therapies than nucleos(t)ide analogs. To offer better treatment responses, the assessment of pre-treatment viral factors (e.g., HBV genotypes), on-treatment viral factors (e.g., HBV DNA, HBsAg), host and environmental factors (e.g., patient age, ALT) is recommended for the initiation and continuation of HBV therapies [2] [3] [4] .

As a potential predictor of treatment responses, serum HBV RNA is associated with intrahepatic cccDNA levels [10] and the persistence of viral infection and rebound [11] . For instance, an early decrease of HBV RNA effectively predicted HBeAg seroconversion in 62 patients receiving either lamivudine or tenofovir [12] .

First, dynamic changes of HBV RNA in large-scale cohorts of interferon-treated patients remain poorly understood, since previous studies focused mostly on nucleos(t)ide analogs. Second, it is ambiguous if HBV RNA acted as an effective predictor of interferon responses, particularly in a large cohort with non-responders. Third, to offer better responses, it remains unclear whether HBV RNA in combination with known HBV biomarkers could offer better predictive performance. Last, it remains unclear whether HBV RNA could predict HBsAg loss which is generally considered as a functional \"cure\" that signifies a favorable outcome of antiviral treatments [14, 15] . To address the above questions, we assessed HBV RNA in a longitudinal cohort of 727 HBeAg-positive patients who randomly received PegIFN\u03b1-2a or PegIFN\u03b1-2b. Based on this large-scale cohort, our findings support the hypothesis that even at the early interferon treatments, HBV RNA is a strong monitor of HBeAg seroconversion, despite its modest role in the prediction of HBsAg loss.",

In the absence of DNA polymerase and cDNA primers, HBV RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA under the temperature of 50 \u00b0C for 30 min. After adding DNA polymerases and cDNA primers, the cDNA amplification was performed by an activation step at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 50 two-step cycles (each cycle 15 s at 95 \u00b0C and 30 s at 60 \u00b0C), and a cooling step down to 25 \u00b0C for 10 s. The fluorescence of cDNA was detected and measured by the 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems \u00ae ). More details are provided in our Supplementary.",

Fourth, a standard software, Cutoff Finder, was applied to optimize biomarker cutoffs [21] . The standard bootstrap resampling method was applied to generate 1000 randomized datasets in the fivefold cross-validation to avoid overestimation. The robustness of biomarker cutoffs was confirmed by bootstrapping resampling and cross-validation. Sixth, predictor importance estimates were measured by random forest classification (500 decision trees) with curvature tests for splitting predictors and surrogate splits for handling missing values. Since missing data only appeared in 1.1% of our dataset, our analyses used all available cases when variables of interest were present-a known approach called pairwise deletion.

Our study reveals three major findings that support the use of HBV RNA as an early on-treatment factor to estimate PegIFN\u03b1 responses. First, HBV RNA is not only positively correlated with traditional HBV biomarkers but also acts as a strong predictor of HBeAg seroconversion and a modest predictor of HBsAg loss. Second, HBV RNA at week 12 is an early predictor and its optimized cutoff at approximately 1000 copies/mL effectively forecasts HBeAg seroconversion, supporting the hypothesis that the suppression of HBV RNA at a low level may lead to better treatment [22] . Serum HBV RNA was previously reported as a potential biomarker to estimate treatment outcomes of HBV polymerase inhibitors [11, 12, 23, 24] or PegIFN\u03b1-2a in a small cohort of 76 responder-enriched patients [13] . In our study, HBV RNA was evaluated using a randomized phase 3 cohort of 727 HBeAg-positive patients. Our univariate and multivariate regression analyses consistently revealed the predictive value of HBV RNA in the SR prediction at weeks 0, 12, 24, and 48 (Table 2) . Moreover, we observed that HBV RNA was positively correlated with HBeAg, HBV DNA, and HBsAg at all sampling points, which was in agreement with the literature results [25] . HBV RNA decreased faster than HBV DNA and HBsAg at the early treatment period, whereas its decreasing pattern in SR patients was similar to HBeAg, supporting its potential to predict HBeAg seroconversion (Fig. 2) . In contrast, HBV RNA was only a modest predictor of HBsAg loss in our analyses. This was in agreement with a recent review which highlighted that HBsAg was a key predictor of HBsAg loss, but other biomarkers seemed less effective [26] .",

In agreement with previous findings on nucleos(t)ide analogs [12] , our study revealed the effectiveness of HBV RNA at week 12 to predict HBeAg seroconversion for interferon treatments. By monitoring HBV RNA dynamics over 72 weeks, we found that fast decreasing HBV RNA at week 12, but not the baseline HBV RNA, was a sound predictor of HBeAg seroconversion. A recent study, however, reported that HBV RNA outperformed HBeAg at baseline in 76 response-enriched patients treated with PegIFN\u03b1-2a [13] . This disagreement might be due to their cohort which only included responseenriched patients (n = 76, SR = 51%) screened from two different clinical trials (n = 271, SR = 32.1% and n = 130, SR = 36.2%). Despite this, our results and literature results support that low levels and fast decreases of HBV RNA are likely associated with treatment success even in the early period [23, 24] .",

Furthermore, early discontinuation of interferon treatments could be considered in HBeAg-positive patients who showed HBV RNA > 5.2 log 10 copies/mL at week 12, because more than 95% of these patients were unable to achieve HBeAg seroconversion. In addition to the predictive performance of individual biomarkers, our study proved that multivariate combinations of HBV RNA plus HBeAg, patient age, and genotype B offered high levels of positive predictive value (95.2%) and specificity (99.8%).
