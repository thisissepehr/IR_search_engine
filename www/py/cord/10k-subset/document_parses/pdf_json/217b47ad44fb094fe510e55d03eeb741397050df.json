This raises questions on the importance of lipid metabolism in flying-foxes that consume a predominantly low fat diet. Decreased levels of total protein, albumin and globulin levels were reported for animals in poor condition which is consistent with other studies of Pteropus species [24, 39] and may be due to a lower proteinaceous plane of nutrition. The erythrocyte panel demonstrated significant increases with improving body condition, consistent with previously reported findings that haemoglobin and red cell count are positively associated with general body condition and survival [13] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 611, "end": 615, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 616, "end": 619, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 916, "end": 920, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The presence of only a small number of injured or ill animals examined in this study is normal within a wild population, as seriously injured or sick wild animals would likely succumb to death by predation or natural attrition.
