Here we classify selected European hydrophytes into`attribute groups' based on the possession of homogenous sets of characteristics, and explore the correspondence between these attribute groups, or individual attributes, and habitat use. 2. Non-hierarchical clustering was used to assign 120 species to twenty groups based on a matrix of categorical scores for literature-and field-derived information covering seventeen intrinsic morphological and life-history traits. Subdivision of some of these traits produced a total of 58 attributes (i.e. modalities). The robustness of this classification was confirmed by a high rate of reclassification (92%) under multiple discriminant analysis (MDA). The phylogenetic contribution was explored using ordination methods with taxonomy at family level acting as a covariable. 3. Our approach differed from earlier classifications based on growth or life form because we regarded growth form plasticity as a property of the species and its range of growing conditions, rather than of each individual population, and we considered additional (e.g. regenerative) traits. However, some conventional life form groups were preserved (i.e. utricularids, isoetids, hydrocharids and lemnids). 4. Some parallels existed with established theory on terrestrial plant growth strategies, but we used strictly intrinsic attributes relevant specifically to hydrophytes and our groups could not be decomposed into three or four primary strategies. Only finer levels of partitioning appear to be of fundamental and applied ecological relevance in hydrophytes. 5. A principal components analysis ordination based on 26 attributes related to physical habitat utilization separated species and their attribute groups along axes relating to: (a) flow, substratum grade and organic matter content, scour frequency, and sedimentation; and (b) depth, water level stability and biotic disturbance. A MDA applied to species ordination scores indicated only a modest overall correspondence between attribute groups and habitat use (54% correct reclassification). Poor reclassification was the result of intergroup overlap (indicating alternative sets of attributes for a given habitat) or high intragroup variance in habitat utilization (indicating commonality of attributes between different habitats). These results are interpreted in terms of trade-offs between resistance and resilience traits,`functional plasticity' in traits, phylogenetic dependence in some groups and methodological constraints. The predictive potential of hydrophyte groups and their limitations are discussed. 6. Redundancy analysis revealed a highly significant correlation between traits and habitat use (P < 0.01). Our attribute matrix explained 72% of variation in physical habitat use with eight attributes (i.e. turions, anchored emergent leaves, high or low body flexibility, high root:shoot biomass ratio, free-floating surface or free-floating submerged growth form, and annual life history) explaining half of this variation. 7. Most attributes were mapped in accordance with habitat template predictions, although tests were confounded by the underlying correlation between spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The main features were: (a) a trade-off between resistance-type traits (related to stream lining, flexibility and anchorage) in more spatially heterogenous riverine and littoral zone habitats, and resilience type traits (i.e. turions, very small body size and free-floating growth forms) in spatially simple, rarely disturbed habitats, such as backwaters and canals; and (b) a shift from high investment competitive traits with a low reproductive output in deep stable habitats to classically ruderal and desiccation resistance traits in shallow fluctuating habitats.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Over the last 20 years, the use of various biological traits to assemble species into coherent non-taxonomic groups has provided a valuable alternative approach for studying the ecology of a wide range of vegetation types (Friedel, Bastin & Griffin, 1988; Grime, Hodgson & Hunt, 1988; Leishman & Westoby, 1992; Boutin & Keddy, 1993; Golluscio & Sala, 1993; Murphy et al., 1994; Smith, Shugart & Woodward, 1997) , although botanists have long been aware of the basic concept (Du Rietz, 1931) . Functional approaches of this type are appealing because they synthesize large complex data sets, which are readily accessible only to taxonomists and habitat specialists, into smaller, more general and easily interpreted sets of attributes, including traits of known or potential adaptive value (Keddy, 1989; Korner, 1993) .

We have resorted to the simple term attribute groups' since we share the reservations of Chapleau, Johansen & Williamson (1988) concerning the (ab)use of the term`strategy'. We have also resisted the rather vague term`functional group' because the mechanistic relationship between traits and functions in hydrophytes is still poorly understood in many cases, and we have been unable to define specific functions. However, the traits which we use are of potential functional significance (sensu Lincoln et al., 1982) , and our groups could be regarded as functionally distinct in that each reflects a different emphasis on key plant processes such as resource acquisition, growth, reproduction and dispersal/colonization (Botkin, 1975) . Keddy (1992) has recommended that, rather than defining the functions (and traits which might best measure these functions) at the outset, a pragmatic approach is to measure a large number of traits on a large number of species and see what patterns emerge. Our species\u00b4traits matrix is the product of exhaustive literature searches and extensive fieldwork in European freshwater habitats which we believe offers a pragmatic alternative to large-scale experimental screening.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 51, "end": 76, "text": "Woodward & Cramer,z 1996)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 194, "end": 216, "text": "Chevenet et al., 1994)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 481, "end": 519, "text": "Chapleau, Johansen & Williamson (1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 886, "end": 907, "text": "Lincoln et al., 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1112, "end": 1126, "text": "(Botkin, 1975)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1141, "text": "Keddy (1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "We then examine the relationship between attribute groups, species attributes and habitat utilization. Grace (1993) has described`a partial correlation between the syndrome of functional attributes and the habitat relations' in a study of clonal propagation methods in aquatic angiosperms, while expressing the need to consider entire growth form and life history in order to improve the predictiveness of this relationship. We believe that focusing jointly on individual attributes and plant attribute groups is preferable to considering traits in isolation since real species represent alternative combinations of attributes. We use a matrix of scores for physical habitat variables (subdivided as above into habitat characteristics) based on the known overall range of occurrence of individual aquatic macrophytes within north-western Europe rather than focusing on a particular site or type of aquatic habitat. An advantage at this scale is that the direct match between species and environment is less likely to be obscured by the history of the local environment and the chance dispersal of organisms (Townsend & Hildrew, 1994) . If the environment is viewed as a nest of sieves through which species are sorted according to the traits they display before they can occupy a particular habitat, then two questions can be posed depending on the chosen perspective: (1) How much variation in the expression of a trait at the species or assemblage level can be explained by measurements of environmental variables? (Is mesh size a good predictor of particle diameter?); and (2) To what extent is current habitat utilization the product of existing traits? (Can particle diameter be used as an indicator of mesh size?) Here, because we are dealing with habitat utilization, i.e. the partial product of trait filtering, rather than extrinsic measurements of the environment, only the second question is pertinent.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 103, "end": 115, "text": "Grace (1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1107, "end": 1133, "text": "(Townsend & Hildrew, 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "We use the habitat template concept of Southwood (1977 Southwood ( , 1988 as a context for this study.

Finer levels of coding were considered but rejected as being too subjective. Information was treated at the attribute level (e.g. Leishman & Westoby, 1992; , which differs from the fuzzy coding approach (Chevenet et al., 1994) in which the trait is the basic entity. The latter was not applicable because our categorical scores (0, 1 and 2) were not sufficiently discriminant. In the case of hydrophytes, fuzzy coding would seem better suited to detailed studies of a discrete habitat type, geographical area or other subset of species (e.g. Bornette et al., 1994) . Thus, the data consisted of a matrix of 120 species by fifty-eight attributes (`Appendix 2') summarizing the attributes displayed by populations across the extent of the realized niche of a species (sensu Begon, Harper & Townsend, 1996) within its European range. Attributes were not weighted to compensate for overrepresentation of some traits (Leishman & Westoby, 1992) because we felt that assigning weightings could as easily introduce as eliminate bias. Here, the relatively high number of attributes should be sufficient to give a broad characterization of species without an a priori assumption that some attributes were more important than others (Montalvo et al., 1991) . We also could not transform our data to ranked form to correct for skewness because of the large number of tied scores, and because ranking would exaggerate or reduce the difference between scores for different attributes depending on the distribution of scores. Species were classified into homogeneous groups in terms of their attributes. Since the relative adaptive significance of each attribute was unknown, the classification required was clearly non-hierarchical (Gauch, 1982; Grime et al., 1988) . The procedure has been described fully by Grime et al. (1988 and Hunt & Bossard (1993) , and is considered more rigorous and objective than the agglomerative polythetic hierarchical clustering techniques which have been widely favoured in functional classification (e.g. Leishman & Westoby, 1992; Boutin & Keddy, 1993; Kindscher & Wells, 1995; Chapin et al., 1996) . Because a sensible initial partition is required to allow nonhierarchical clustering to function optimally (Payne et al., 1993) , we generated several alternative hierarchical classifications to act as starting points by applying average linkage and group average clustering to a euclidean distance similarity matrix using GENSTAT 5 (Payne et al., 1993) and TWINSPAN clustering algorithms using VESPAN (Hill, 1979) . Group number was fixed at twenty on the basis of the pattern of cluster fusion or subdivision, and the change in within-group percentage similarity. Salvinia natans was removed from this stage of the analysis because it was consistently isolated under the different clustering treatments. Non-hierarchical clustering was performed using GENSTAT 5 run to generate twenty to two groups, with the globally optimal partition determined by the minimisation of the within-cluster sum of squares S criterion (Gordon, 1981; Grime et al., 1988) . The optimal number of groups (g) is determined with the stopping rule criterion (C g ) of Krzanowski & Lai (1988) .

Axis 2 is best regarded as a gradient of increasing temporal heterogeneity from generally deep, stable, rarely disturbed sites (low scores) to shallow, fluctuating and more frequently disturbed habitats. Eleven groups showed reasonable habitat differentiation over the first two axes, while group 20 was separated from the remaining groups on the third axis (shift from habitats with moderate-high sedimentation rates to coarse-bedded, rarely disturbed habitats with low sedimentation rates).

Based on the species scores from the first five axes of the habitat PCA, MDA offers an independent test of the correspondence between attribute groups and the distribution of their members in terms of habitat use.

Although attributes related to resource acquisition were largely excluded from our analysis, the classification still reflects underlying correlations between morphology and ecophysiology in isolating the carnivorous bladderworts (group 14), and the isoetids (group 20); the latter incorporate a suite of well-known ecophysiological adaptations to survive low inorganic carbon availability (e.g. crassulacean acid metabolism, mycorrhizal roots, root foraging for sediment interstitial CO 2 , large lacunal air spaces; Farmer & Spence, 1986; Bowes, 1987) . The presence of aerial tissue in the form of floating or emergent leaves also provides access to atmospheric CO 2 , and sets apart groups 12, 13, 15 and 17 which are exclusively submerged. However, there is experimental evidence of significant within-group variation in factors including HCO 3 \u00b1 affinity (e.g. groups 4 and 16; Maberly & Spence, 1983; Bodner, 1994; Maberly & Madsen, 1998) , acidity tolerance (e.g. group 8; Maessen et al., 1992) and N-NH 4 + tolerance (e.g. groups 4 and 13; Dendene et al., 1993) which must reflect adaptations at the cellular level. These are likely to translate to differences in trophic preferences independent of attribute group composition. Aquatic macrophytes have previously been`shoehorned' into Grimes' C-S-R classification using selected traits (e.g. R\u00f9rslett, 1989; Murphy et al., 1990) , which it is tentatively assumed, despite the considerable differences in selection pressures in aquatic environments and their multidimensional nature, have a broadly transferable functional role. Some parallels with our groups exist, but we have deliberately avoided the use of strategy labels because these are almost inevitably context-sensitive (Smith et al., 1993) , and thus, potentially misleading when considered out of context. The isoetids (group 20) have often been regarded as the classic stress tolerators of aquatic habitats, in view of attributes such as wintergreenness, small stature, longevity and high below-ground relative to above-ground biomass (Farmer & Spence, 1986; R\u00f9rslett, 1989; Boutin & Keddy, 1993) , but even within this Fig. 3 Redundancy analysis ordination diagrams depicting the distribution of (a) selected trait attributes and attribute groups, and (b) habitat characteristics. See the text for details. The attribute groups are located at the centroid (arithmetic mean) of the axis scores of their member species. The labels are placed immediately to the right of their scores. Minor adjustments have been made in some cases to avoid overlap. relatively robust group, some strong ruderal (e.g. Subularia aquatica) or competitor (Juncus bulbosus) affinities exist. Groups 3, 4, 13 and 15 display several typically competitive traits (e.g. high dense canopy, extensive lateral spread, storage of photosynthate as capital for the next season: Grime et al., 1988; Kautsky, 1988; Murphy et al., 1990) , but as Bornette et al. (1994) have pointed out, the lemnids (group 18) can achieve competitive dominance with a markedly different combination of attributes (freefloating surface tiny leaves; budding). Groups 8, 9, 10 and 11 conform more closely to primary or mixed ruderal strategies, as might be expected of hydrophytes occurring near the interface with terrestrial habitat, but most other groups have no obvious terrestrial analogue. When drawing comparisons with the C-S-R classification, it should be borne in mind that hydrophytes exist within a restricted region of the template envisaged for terrestrial vegetation and that the groups recognized may represent variants of a subset of the strategies reported for terrestrial plants. According to R\u00f9rslett (1989) , for example, most hydrophytes display characteristically stress-tolerant and/or ruderal traits within the overall context of plant strategies. In this study, we sought to use an attribute data-set based on intrinsic properties (sensu Steneck & Dethier, 1994 ) relevant specifically to hydrophytes, i.e. the combination of attributes reflecting the potential expression of the genotype. Thus, our groups do not necessarily possess suites of trait attributes which correspond clearly to the strategies proposed by Grime et al. (1988) or Kautsky (1988) . Further attempts to cross-match classifications are probably of little value since only the finer levels of partitioning (highest level strategies sensu Wiegleb Table 7 Correlation coefficients between sample scores which are linear correlations of explanatory variables and individual trait attributes (n = 120), and the independent contribution of trait attributes to an explanation of variance in habitat utilization (total = 0.724) using redundancy analysis.

Some pairs of groups overlap even though within-group variance in habitat use may be low (9 versus 10, 12 versus 13, 16 versus 17 and 18 versus 19). Leps, Osbornova-Kosinova & Rejmanek (1982) and MacGillivray et al. (1995) have also noted trade-offs between resistance and resilience in grassland communities. Contrasting phenology and complementary responses to flooding-related distur-bance in rivers (resistance, through streamlining and fixed depth of rooting, versus population resilience, through rapid growth from vegetative fragments or seeds, and/or intact plants surviving in spatial refugia), could offer a mechanism for coexistence in patchy and temporally heterogenous habitats by Ranunculus fluitans or R. penicillatus (group 16), and Zannichellia palustris and/or Groenlandia densa (group 17), for example. Similarly, contrasting emphasis on propagation via fragmentation and seed production could assist temporal niche partitioning between groups 12 and 13. 4 Within-group variation in habitat use is high. This appears to be the main cause of very low rates of correct reclassification (groups 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 13) . This may be because some borderline species are poorly classified in terms of their traits, or because the trait profile for a group is varied and different traits are important in different parts of the habitat range of the group, but are`drowned out' in classification by a common subset of redundant traits. It could also be because of`functional plasticity' \u00b1 a common trait or set of traits which can perform different functions, and therefore, is successful in different habitats. For example, group 16 contains several dissected-leaved species. Hottonia palustris and Myriophyllum verticillatum are typical of standing waters where dissected leaves might enhance gas exchange or uptake of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), or reduce selfshading. By contrast, Ranunculus fluitans and R. penicillatus are typical of moderate to fast-flowing rivers where diffusion gradients, DIC availability or selfshading are less significant constraints, but dissected leaves will reduce drag through form reduction. The final members, M. spicatum and M. alterniflorum, occur under both sets of conditions. Similarly, waxy, strap-shaped floating leaves (e.g. group 1) are responsive to fluctuating water levels, offer protection from desiccation and enable rapid coverage of wet mud if water levels subside, yet also provide effective stream lining in flowing waters. Grace (1993) has further emphasized the variety of functions performed by hydrophyte tissues involved in clonal propagation, in addition to the basic objective of numerical increase. Hence, the rhizomes common to group 3 species could provide effective anchorage in rivers, support through buoyancy and protection from anoxia in semi-fluid, organic-rich sediments, as well as contributing significantly to resource storage.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 182, "end": 207, "text": "Townsend & Hildrew, 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 406, "end": 448, "text": "Leps, Osbornova-Kosinova & Rejmanek (1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 453, "end": 479, "text": "MacGillivray et al.

This might apply especially to groups 7 and 8, two monophyletic groups featuring critical taxa (Callitriche and Ranunculus subgenus Batrachium, respectively) in which species are of uncertain origin, poorly separated because of morphological reduction, and therefore, distinguished mainly on the basis of ecologically trivial characteristics, and in the case of group 8, are known to hybridize freely and form persistent sterile or fertile populations (Cook, 1970) . Redundancy analysis indicates that trait attributes can explain a significant degree of the variation in habitat use. Unfortunately, comparisons with the predictions of Townsend & Hildrew (1994) are partially confounded by an underlying correlation between high spatial heterogeneity and scouring (a source of disturbance in rivers and exposed lake shores) and the dominance of the second axis by water level fluctuations. Thus, the RDA and habitat PCA extract similar axes to those recognized by Cellot et al. (1994) in developing an environmental framework for river floodplain habitats on the Upper Rho \u00c3 ne (i.e. spatial axis based on sediment grain size and organic matter content, and temporal axis based on variation in water depth). This reflects our rather catholic definition of hydrophyte and our`global' view of freshwater habitats. Hence, members of group 12, which are intolerant of desiccation in the established phase but include many typically pioneer species (Wade, Vanhecke & Barry, 1986; Kautsky, 1988; which recruit rapidly from the seed bank following re-wetting (as in temporary marshes or rice fields; Grillas, 1990; Triest, 1986) , are relegated on the temporal heterogeneity axis by the inclusion of species tolerant of temporary or even permanent exposure.

The strong association between temporally variable habitats, and various resilience (small body size, short-lived perennial life history, high reproductive output, early reproduction and spread by stolons) and resistance type attributes (anchored emergent/ heterophyllous leaves, waxy leaves, nodal rooting and the ability to produce a persistent amphibious growth form) is also consistent with predictions. As would be expected in shallow water habitats with fluctuating water levels, life stages susceptible to desiccation are penalized. Several attributes appear to be general features of the vegetation of early successional environments (Prach et al., 1997) and hydrophytes occurring at the land\u00b1water interface (e.g. groups 8, 9, 10 and 11) exhibit many of the classic characteristics of terrestrial ruderals (R\u00f9rslett, 1989) . Bornette et al. (1994) also observed that heterophylly, high regeneration potential, reproduction by fragmentation, anchorage and desiccation tolerance were common attributes of hydrophytes in temporally variable floodplain habitats. In the spatially complex, temporally intermediate sites, the emphasis is on resistance traits related to stream lining, anchorage and flexilibility, despite the fact that these habitats are often also temporally heterogenous in terms of susceptibility to scouring or sedimentation. On coarse substrata with low sedimentation rates, an intercorrelation with resource-poor environments is reflected in attributes such as wintergreeness and inflexible tubular leaves. Large to very large body size and leaf area are high investment attributes expected in more temporally stable habitats, but are clearly compatible with moderate flows and intermittent scouring if combined with high flexibility and/or firm anchorage through rhizomes or nodal rooting.

This is perhaps because disturbance in the form of desiccation exerts such strong selection pressure on hydrophytes that spatial refugia become effectively irrelevant. However, in the case of disturbance by scouring or sedimentation, river marginal habitats may offer partial refugia for larger species penalized by high hydraulic resistance, such as Nuphar lutea, Sparganium erectum or Potamogeton perfoliatus. Among the isoetids (group 20), short stiff leaves with copious lacunal spaces, high root:shoot biomass and evergreeness are best seen as morphological correlates of ecophysiological adaptations to maximize carbon gain and conserve resources rather than specific adaptations to wave disturbance (Farmer & Spence, 1986) .

Since turions offer little protection from prolonged desiccation, this mechanism of clonal propagation is most strongly developed in permanent aquatic habitats.
