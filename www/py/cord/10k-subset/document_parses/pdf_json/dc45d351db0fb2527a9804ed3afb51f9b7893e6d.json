Six nursing home norovirus outbreaks occurring in South Carolina, U.S. from 2014 to 2016 were examined. We aimed to quantify the contribution of symptoms and other case characteristics in norovirus transmission using the reproduction number (R Ei ) as an estimate of individual case infectivity and to examine how transmission changes over the course of an outbreak. Individual estimates of R Ei were calculated using a maximum likelihood procedure to infer the average number of secondary cases generated by each case. The associations between case characteristics and R Ei were estimated using a weighted multivariate mixed linear model. Outbreaks began with one to three index case(s) with large estimated R Ei 's (range: 1.48 to 8.70) relative to subsequent cases. Of the 209 cases, 155 (75%) vomited, 164 (79%) had diarrhea, and 158 (76%) were nursing home residents (vs. staff). Cases who vomited infected 2.12 (95% CI: 1.68, 2.68) times the number of individuals as non-vomiters, cases with diarrhea infected 1.39 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.87) times the number of individuals as cases without diarrhea, and resident-cases infected 1.53 (95% CI: 1.15, 2.02) times the number of individuals as staffcases. Index cases tended to be residents (vs. staff) who vomited and infected considerably more secondary cases compared to non-index cases. Results suggest that individuals, particularly residents, who vomit are more infectious and tend to drive norovirus transmission in U.S. nursing home norovirus outbreaks. While diarrhea also plays a role in norovirus transmission, it is to a lesser degree than vomiting in these settings.

Human challenge studies have found that vomiting, compared to diarrhea, is more likely to result in environmental contamination potentially leading to transmission through fomites and airborne droplets [26] . In household norovirus outbreaks, however, primary cases with diarrhea, but not vomiting, have been associated with higher secondary attack rates [27] .

Outbreak reports have shown that nursing home outbreaks often start with single index cases [14] , however the relative infectiousness of index cases (compared to non-index cases) has not been examined in these settings. We found that outbreaks tend to start with one or more cases who infect substantially more individuals compared to later cases. There are multiple possible explanations for this greater infectiousness of index cases. First, as an outbreak progresses and more individuals become ill and later immune, there is a natural decrease in the reproduction number. However, we found that index cases generally had substantially greater R Ei 's compared to cases with onset dates only a few days after outbreak initiation, before a sufficient number of susceptibles could accumulate to explain this pattern. We also found that R 0,1 (the basic reproduction number for index cases) tended to be substantially larger than R 0,2-4 (the basic reproduction numbers for cases on days 2-4), even under the extreme assumptions that all individuals were initially susceptible and that the total population consisted only of reported cases in the outbreak. If the observed declines in R Ei had been due to a natural decrease in susceptibles alone, we would expect the calculated R 0i values to remain relatively constant over time. Because this was the most extreme assumption, the differences between R 0,1 and R 0,2-4 estimates became even more pronounced when the population was assumed to have some level of immunity (e.g., 50% susceptibility). Therefore, these results suggest that index cases are more infectious than subsequent cases for reasons other than the natural decreases in susceptibles alone. Second, index cases may have been more infectious than non-index cases due to intrinsic case characteristics (e.g., vomiting). Under this hypothesis, the median R Ei may be~1.0, meaning that most cases in the outbreak are only moderately infectious, but a highly infectious case is required to initiate an outbreak. This hypothesis is supported by a recent paper that found that vomiting in norovirus index cases was associated with an increased risk of nosocomial outbreaks [28] . Third, rapid implementation of effective outbreak control measures could curtail transmission. Lacking data on the timing and type of control measures, we could not explicitly account for this in our calculations. Results may be due to any one of these explanations, or some combination thereof.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 94, "end": 98, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 193, "end": 197, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2286, "end": 2290, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "U.S. nursing home residents have an increased risk of norovirus gastroenteritis [8, 14] , but evidence for their relative infectiousness compared to staff was lacking. While staff clearly can transmit norovirus [12, 14] , studies of nosocomial outbreaks in the Netherlands have shown that symptomatic patients have the largest contribution to virus transmission in those settings [29] . The role of residents (vs. staff) in norovirus transmission in U.S. nursing homes may depend on the average level of mobility and dependency of residents. If nursing home residents are generally mobile, self-sufficient, and able to gather in communal rooms, they may be more likely than staff to contribute to norovirus transmission. Conversely, more self-sufficient residents may be more likely to identify symptoms of norovirus and self-quarantine, thus transmitting less. We did not have information on residents' mobility or dependence on nursing care for this study, so were unable to include these variables in our analyses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 80, "end": 83, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 84, "end": 87, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 211, "end": 215, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 216, "end": 219, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 380, "end": 384, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We note a number of limitations of our study. First, all analyzed outbreaks took place in South Carolina, so results may not be generalizable to norovirus outbreaks in nursing homes in other U.S. states or elsewhere. Nursing home staffing levels vary widely across states [30] , as do infection control training resources and healthcare-associated infection reporting [31] . Additionally, because all outbreaks were caused by genogroup II, and the two outbreaks genotyped were caused by GII.4 Sydney, results may not be generalizable to non-genogroup II or non-GII.4 outbreaks.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 272, "end": 276, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 368, "end": 372, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Second, symptomatic cases may go unreported, particularly in the early stages of an outbreak, which could lead to an overestimate of the infectiousness of index cases. Relatedly, index cases may have been misclassified if true index cases were missed. For norovirus, it's also possible that asymptomatic cases could contribute to transmission. However, studies have found that asymptomatic individuals in nosocomial outbreaks contribute significantly less to transmission than symptomatic individuals, leading us to believe that bias from missing asymptomatic cases is likely minimal [29] . Additionally, some reported cases could be sporadic or caused by a different etiologic agent. Furthermore, only the date of symptom onset, not time, was considered when calculating R Ei 's. Because norovirus has a relatively short incubation period, it is possible, although unlikely, for primary and secondary cases to have the same symptom onset date. The method we used to calculate R Ei assumes that such cases cannot infect each other. Third, we excluded 9 cases with R Ei = 0 from the regression analyses, however including them in the main regression analysis only strengthened the associations between all three predictor variables and infectiousness. The association between vomiting and increased infectiousness remained the strongest. Lastly, we used a serial interval distribution estimated from household transmission associated with norovirus outbreaks in child daycare centers in Sweden and assumed a similar serial interval in our U.S. nursing homes. Unlike transmission in the households, where it was clear that the child daycare center attendee/staff infected others in the home, identifying transmission pairs in nursing home outbreaks is difficult, precluding direct estimation of serial intervals in these settings. The true serial interval may be longer or shorter in nursing homes. Regardless, we found that our main finding of the importance of vomiting in transmission was robust when using different values of the serial interval.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 584, "end": 588, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Because there is currently no publicly available norovirus vaccine, sound prevention and control measures are key to controlling norovirus outbreaks, but the present body of published literature does not provide an evidence-base for the value of specific measures [10] . These study results lend support for measures that focus on cases who vomit, particularly if those cases are residents (vs. staff). Results indicate that rapid response to a vomiting event may be effective in reducing the size and duration of norovirus outbreaks in nursing home settings, and support measures that reduce exposure to vomit, such as thorough cleaning and disinfection with a chlorine-based disinfectant, isolation of the case, and implementing antiemetic treatment after the first vomiting episode [26] . While cleaning with a chlorine-based disinfectant and isolation of cases are currently recommended control strategies, there are generally little data about the implementation and timing of these control measures in norovirus outbreaks [10] . Furthermore, the use of antiemetic drugs for the prevention and control of norovirus outbreaks is not widely recommended [32, 33] . The important role of vomiting in transmission shown in our results suggests that the use of antiemetic drugs in nursing home outbreaks should be further considered. Information on type and timing of control measures was not available for this study. Future studies should collect such data and evaluate the effects of specific control measures using similar analytical methods to the approach used here.
