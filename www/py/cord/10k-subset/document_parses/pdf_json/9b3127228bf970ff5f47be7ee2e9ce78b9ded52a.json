By their structure, some VLPs are thought to be capable of stimulating proliferation of dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells. Thus, antigen-specific B and T cell responses are markedly enhanced when epitopes are coupled to VLPs. The regular array of epitopes on the surface of chimeric VLPs is thought to allow efficient crosslinking of antigen-specific immunoglobulins on B cells, leading to B cell proliferation and production of antibodies. Exposure of the immune system to a repetitive array of self-peptides is an effective mechanism of breaking immunological tolerance and producing auto-reactive therapeutic antibodies. Therefore, there is currently significant interest in VLP-epitope display systems for induction of antibodies for disease therapy and prophylaxis, as well as for induction of peptide-specific T cell responses for immunotherapy of cancer and chronic disease. There are well-established methodologies for recombinant production of VLP-epitope display systems that use self-assembling capsid proteins of several different viruses, most notably papillomaviruses, hepatitis B core and surface antigens, and various bacteriophages, including the leviviruses MS2 and Q\u03b2. Many of these are easily produced in various eukaryotic expression systems, and some may also be manufactured in bacteria. The scientific literature is replete with examples of plantproduced recombinant virus particle and VLP epitope display-based vaccines that show utility, mainly as prophylactic vaccines against infectious diseases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Research on the use of recombinant virus-like particles as epitope carriers started in the mid-1980s, where in addition to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) (Haynes et al. 1986 ), hepatitis B surface and core antigen particles, yeast Ty Gag particles and poliovirus virions were shown to be effective carriers that significantly enhanced the immunogenicity of linked epitopes (Valenzuela et al. 1985; Delpeyroux et al. 1986; Adams et al. 1987; Clarke et al. 1987; Burke et al. 1988; Delpeyroux et al. 1988; Martin et al. 1988 Martin et al. , 2003 Clarke et al. 1990 ). However, VLP epitope display technology has only recently moved toward practical development of vaccines for use in human and veterinary medicine. It is interesting to note that two promising malaria vaccines based on epitope display on the surface of VLPs are being tested in humans. The product that is most advanced in clinical evaluation is a promising malaria vaccine based on display of a large part of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein, in chimeric recombinant HBsAg particles. This vaccine, RTS,S, which is being developed by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, shows promising efficacy in human vaccinee volunteers challenged with P. falciparum , and a phase III efficacy trial in children in Mozambique is planned for the near future (Moorthy et al. 2004 ). The Malaria Vaccine Initiative, in collaboration with biotechnology company Apovia Inc., is conducting a phase I trial with recombinant HBcAg particles displaying a B cell epitope from the circumsporozoite protein fused to the major immunogenic domain of the core protein, and a universal T-helper epitope at the carboxy-terminus (Birkett et al. 2002; Moorthy et al. 2004 ). These are good examples of how VLP-epitope display products are starting to show their promise for addressing infectious diseases. Thus far, only one plant VLP-based candidate vaccine has been tested in humans: a candidate rabies virus vaccine (Yusibov et al. 2002) , and as far as we are aware there are no plant-produced VLP products that are nearing commercialization. The focus of this review is on some of the practical issues that must be considered in order to bring plant-produced virus particle and VLP-based epitope display systems into commercial use. In light of the fact that our primary interest is in TMV-based VLP and virion peptide display, we will concentrate our discussions on the TMV platform technology, and review some of the scientific, manufacturing, and regulatory issues that must be addressed in order to commercialize this technology.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 150, "end": 169, "text": "(Haynes et al. 1986", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 369, "end": 393, "text": "(Valenzuela et al. 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 394, "end": 417, "text": "Delpeyroux et al. 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 418, "end": 436, "text": "Adams et al. 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 437, "end": 456, "text": "Clarke et al. 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 457, "end": 475, "text": "Burke et al. 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 476, "end": 499, "text": "Delpeyroux et al. 1988;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 500, "end": 518, "text": "Martin et al. 1988", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 519, "end": 539, "text": "Martin et al. , 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 540, "end": 558, "text": "Clarke et al. 1990", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1353, "text": "(Moorthy et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1687, "end": 1708, "text": "(Birkett et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1709, "end": 1728, "text": "Moorthy et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1976, "end": 1997, "text": "(Yusibov et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "TMV has been studied as a model antigen for over 50 years (reviewed in Van Regenmortel 1999) .

Years before the mechanism of presentation of antigen to cells of the adaptive immune system by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) was understood, Loor (1967) demonstrated in rabbits that 14 C-labeled TMV virions were rapidly and effectively transported from the site of injection to proximal lymph nodes and then to the spleen. With remarkable foresight, both Loor (1967) and Marbrook and Matthews (1966) showed that the particulate nature of viruses is essential for their immunogenicity because disassembled plant virus coat protein induced lower titer antibodies and poorer immune memory in animals immunized with equivalent doses of intact and disassembled viruses. In the 14 C-labeling experiments referred to above, Loor also showed that the particulate nature of viruses is important for uptake by and activation of APCs since far lower amounts of labeled coat protein were transported by APCs to lymphoid organs in animals immunized with disassembled virus in comparison with intact virus particles (Loor 1967) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 58, "end": 92, "text": "(reviewed in Van Regenmortel 1999)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 553, "end": 564, "text": "Loor (1967)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 767, "end": 778, "text": "Loor (1967)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 783, "end": 811, "text": "Marbrook and Matthews (1966)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1414, "end": 1425, "text": "(Loor 1967)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Overview of Technologies for Display of Peptides on the Surface of Tobacco Mosaic Virus"}, {"text": "The first demonstration that VLPs derived from TMV coat protein could display antigenic epitopes was reported by Haynes et al.

The structures of the virion and coat protein have been determined by x-ray diffraction (Watson 1954; Namba and Stubbs 1986) . The virion contains approximately 2,130 coat protein subunits, each approximately 17.5 kDa, arranged in a right-handed helix with 16.3 subunits per turn. Each subunit of the coat protein tolerates insertion of epitopes at one of three solvent-exposed positions: the N-terminus, at or near the C-terminus and in a surface-exposed loop corresponding to amino acids 59-65. The density with which epitopes may be displayed on rodshaped viruses such as TMV is unmatched by any competing VLP system. For example, it is possible to display greater than 2,100 copies of an epitope on the surface of TMV, compared to 180 on a T=3 particle such as HBcAg VLP or 420 on a T=7 particle such as papillomavirus VLP. Table 1 summarizes the most significant reports of display of immunogenic peptides on the surface of TMV. Overall, these data show that TMV-based peptide display vaccines can be applied for prevention of infectious disease. Of all of these publications, the results presented by Fitchen et al.

For example, screening for fusion accumulation in different hosts, cultivated under growth-room conditions, illustrated that epitope stability was a function of the particular host/epitope combination (Fig. 3 a) .

Promising vaccine candidates whose production requirements dictate production in the field should, therefore, be evaluated under actual growth conditions early in the product development cycle.

Large Scale Biology Corporation has developed a method compatible with the processing of large masses of plant material (Garger et al. 2000 (Garger et al. , 2001 . The process was validated through the purification of a TMV coat protein fusion displaying a malarial epitope (Turpen et al. 1995; Pogue et al. 2002) . This procedure is illustrated schematically in Fig. 5 a. Briefly, the infected plant tissue was harvested and homogenized in the presence of 0.5 l water/kg of biomass. Removal of the plant fiber yielded a crude extract, or \"green juice\" that was adjusted to pH 5 and heated to 45-50\u00b0C. After incubation for approximately 10 min, the juice was cooled to below 10\u00b0C and a low-speed centrifugation step employed to separate the coagulated Fraction I proteins from the virus-containing supernatant. Ultrafiltration was employed to concentrate the supernatant 40-to 50-fold, prior to virus precipitation by the addition of polyethylene glycol ( M r 8,000) and sodium chloride, each at 4% w/v.

Operating at scale, this process yielded 0.6-1 kg of purified TMV fusion product per acre of infected plant material. The final purity of this TMV malarial epitope fusion was greater than 95% (Pogue et al. 2002) . To evaluate the generalizability of this process, we have used a scaled-down version of the procedure, which faithfully mirrors the principal parameters for the production process, e.g., centrifugation conditions and holding times at the different temperatures. The process (outlined in Fig. 5a ) has yielded good recoveries, with final purities comparable to the malarial epitope coat protein fusion, for 30%-40% of the peptide fusions evaluated.

The resistance of each fused peptide to proteases is an additional characteristic that must be evaluated. In vivo proteolysis has been alluded to above (Fig. 3) ; however, this is not necessarily predictive of stability during processing, as the loss of cellular compartmentalization with homogenization will expose the TMV fusion to additional proteolytic activities. One approach consists of incubating in-process samples, e.g., the initial supernatant, at 20-22\u00b0C (room temperature) for 2 h and evaluating stability by gel analysis, upon completion of the purification. For the peptide fusion shown in Fig. 6 , excellent stability was obtained at bench-scale under standard processing conditions, where temperatures were maintained below 10\u00b0C (with the exception of the heat-treatment step). In contrast, with the room temperature incubation, substantial truncation was observed.

Coat fusion #3 precipitated as expected, leaving a clear supernatant, while incomplete precipitation was observed with coat fusion #4 . For coat fusion #4 , higher polyethylene glycol concentrations were required to obtain full precipitation of the virus, leaving a clear supernatant (PEG SUPERNATANT #2 ) are typically of a longer duration. In summary, while each TMV peptide fusion modifies the particle surface properties and consequently its processing and purification characteristics, our experience has been that with the appropriate modifications, the majority of fusions evaluated can be made to conform to a general and scaleable production process, yielding a final product of acceptable purity. For those cases where limited solubility persists despite processing modifications, alterations to the peptide itself may prove beneficial. Koo et al. (1999) noted that TMV displaying a ten amino acid peptide from the S2 glycoprotein of murine hepatitis virus was relatively insoluble, even though the recombinant coat protein expressed effectively and formed virus particles. When this peptide was flanked by additional S2 glycoprotein sequence, the TMV fusion was soluble and readily purified. This suggests that tiling around problematic peptides of interest may yield sequences with improved solubility characteristics when displayed on the surface of TMV. An alternative approach would be the introduction of compensatory sequences, in a manner similar to that described earlier in the context of improving virus-host compatibility, see for example Smith et al. (2006) . For both approaches, immunogenicity testing in the appropriate model systems would be required to ensure the altered TMV fusions retain their desired properties.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1509, "end": 1528, "text": "Garger et al. 2000)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2989, "end": 3006, "text": "Koo et al.

However, issues relating to sterilization and TMV inactivation, discussed below, will impact the formulation steps, in particular relating to final product pH, ionic strength, and possibly the timing of adjuvant incorporation. An area where additional excipient testing may be of interest relates to the solubility of the TMV fusion. Wild-type TMV is inherently soluble and can be stored at concentrations above 20 mg/ml for several years at 4\u00b0C, with no visible signs of aggregation, degradation, or precipitation. However, the solubility characteristics of the virus can be changed dramatically by the addition of peptide fusions, and we have noted several examples where visible precipitation occurs with storage at 4\u00b0C, even at relatively low concentration (1-2 mg/ml). Addition of the appropriate excipient may prevent this from occurring, and we have found that aggregation state can be modulated and controlled through addition of excipients. Protein-protein aggregation is typically viewed as a negative for protein biologics since it may adversely affect activity and half-life (Patro et al. 2002) .

Although the methods that we have developed for purification of TMV generally yield product with very low endotoxin and bioburden loads, the implementation of a method or combination of methods to permit TMV fusion vaccine sterilization, to eliminate residual bioburden, is a priority. One possibility is serial 0.45-\u00b5m sterile filtration, since 0.2-\u00b5m filtration is typically employed with tissue culture-derived biologics to ensure the absence of mycoplasma, which is not a concern for plant-derived products. TMV passes readily through 0.45-\u00b5m membranes. However, the introduction of 0.2-\u00b5m filters was prompted by the identification of diminutive bacteria, that consistently penetrated 0.45-\u00b5m filters (Bowman et al. 1967 ).

When tested with a TMV fusion displaying a peptide from the VP2 capsid protein of CPV, the conditions required to inactivate bioburden resulted in cleavage of the coat protein, producing an illdefined product that was difficult to qualify.

These agents are typically employed to inactivate viruses and bacterial toxins employed as vaccines, but they should prove equally effective at eliminating residual bioburden. Formaldehyde, which acts as a microbicide due to its peptide cross-linking activity, is employed in the manufacture of at least eight vaccines licensed for use in the United States (Offit and Jew 2003) . Following treatment, the remaining free formaldehyde may be neutralized by the addition of sodium bisulfite (Martin et al. 2003) . In spite of the widespread use of formaldehyde, it is not considered the ideal inactivant, as the inactivation reaction is neither linear nor first order (Wesslen et al. 1957 ) and extended inactivation periods are required (up to 60 days). Furthermore, since the nucleic acid remains functional, incomplete inactivation is possible, as has occurred with a foot-and mouth disease (FMD) vaccine and an early inactivated polio vaccine (Bahnemann 1990; Brown 2001) . Consequently, inactivants that target nucleic acids may be more appropriate. One option is \u03b2-propiolactone (BPL), which functions by alkylating nucleic acids, thereby abolishing replication. It is currently employed in the inactivation of the cell culture-derived rabies virus vaccine (Perez and Paolazzi 1997) that is currently licensed in more than 20 countries and gained FDA approval in the United States in 1997 (Dreesen 1997) . BPL is considered a possible carcinogen in humans, but it undergoes rapid hydrolysis in aqueous solution, and the breakdown products are nontoxic (Perrin and Morgeaux 1995) . Of greater concern is the fact that BPL reacts with several amino acids, which could impair the immunogenicity of the coat protein-displayed epitopes, a point that has also been raised with regard to formaldehyde inactivation (Brown 2001) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 507, "end": 527, "text": "(Offit and Jew 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 638, "end": 658, "text": "(Martin et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 815, "end": 835, "text": "(Wesslen et al. 1957", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1094, "end": 1110, "text": "(Bahnemann 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1111, "end": 1122, "text": "Brown 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1410, "end": 1435, "text": "(Perez and Paolazzi 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1542, "end": 1556, "text": "(Dreesen 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1705, "end": 1731, "text": "(Perrin and Morgeaux 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1960, "end": 1972, "text": "(Brown 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Final Product Release and Stability"}, {"text": "A promising alternative is the use of aziridine compounds, such as binary ethylenimine (BEI), which also function through the alkylation of nucleic acids. Following virus inactivation, the residual BEI is hydrolyzed by the addition of sodium thiosulfate, which is itself innocuous. Although ethylenimines have been shown to react with proteins (Kasermann et al. 2001) , their impact on epitope conformation and accessibility was substantially less than either BPL or formaldehyde treatment (Blackburn and Besselaar 1991) . LSBC has evaluated BEI as a means of eliminating bioburden from investigational vaccine preparations. To date, approximately ten different TMV epitope fusions have been tested with the BEI procedure. We have determined conditions that effectively inactivate bioburden and in all cases the displayed epitopes retained antigenicity (Palmer et al., 2006) . This procedure can be readily incorporated into veterinary vaccine production, since BEI inactivation is already used in the preparation of the current FMD vaccine, which is distributed globally and is the highest volume viral vaccine manufactured (Bahnemann 1990) . BEI inactivation has not yet been approved for use with human biologics; however, no toxicity or tumorigenicity has been observed in the billions of livestock vaccinated with aziridine-inactivated products (Brown et al. 1998 ). In addition, a chemically related compound, PEN110, is currently in phase III clinical trials as a method of pathogen eradication in red blood cells, for patients requiring acute and chronic transfusions (Wu and Snyder 2003) . For these reasons, the aziridines have been proposed as a universal method for pathogen inactivation in blood products, as well as in biopharmaceutical manufacture (Brown et al. 1998) , and appear, from our experience, to be readily applicable to the preparation of TMV peptide vaccines. BEI treatment also eliminates TMV infectivity (LSBC, unpublished data). Inactivation of TMV may be important in developing these products for use in veterinary medicine, since state Departments of Agriculture regulate movement of infectious plant pathogens. We, and others, have shown that TMV is incapable of replication in mammalian cells, so elimination of infectivity is not a human or animal safety issue per se, but rather a plant health concern.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 344, "end": 367, "text": "(Kasermann et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 490, "end": 520, "text": "(Blackburn and Besselaar 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 853, "end": 874, "text": "(Palmer et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1141, "text": "(Bahnemann 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1350, "end": 1368, "text": "(Brown et al. 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1576, "end": 1596, "text": "(Wu and Snyder 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1763, "end": 1782, "text": "(Brown et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Final Product Release and Stability"}, {"text": "Once formulated, sterilized and vialed, the TMV fusion enters a stability study to ensure that protein integrity is maintained and to evaluate shelf life.

The concept of using vaccination to break immune tolerance to self-antigens and induce antibodies that may act therapeutically is a new and exciting one (Bachmann and Dyer 2004) . It is well known that the best way to achieve this is through linkage of critical B cell epitopes to virus-like particles (Fehr et al. 1998; Chackerian et al. 2002) . The report by Fitchen et al. (1995) provides data showing that TMV particles may be useful for the display of self-peptides in the development of therapeutic vaccines for induction of autoantibodies for the treatment of chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, allergy, obesity, and drug addiction, and various infectious diseases, among others. These are drug targets of many vaccine and pharmaceutical companies. Therapeutic vaccines against chronic diseases also frequently require functional T cell immunity, directed against chronically infected or cancerous tissues, TMV displayed peptides do indeed promote functional T cell responses (McCormick et al. 2006) . A fundamental requirement for therapeutic vaccines to be effective is that they activate professional APCs that can prime T cells reactive against target cells and tissues, and induce a strong Th1-biased immune response. The data published by Loor (1967) suggest that TMV particles are engulfed by APCs and rapidly transported to lymphoid organs for presentation to T cells. However, recent data suggest that different VLPs have very distinct properties when their abilities to activate the innate immune system are compared, and that the use of adjuvants, as well as elegant molecular engineering strategies can be applied to modulate the activity of epitope-display vaccines (Chackerian et al. 2002; Storni et al. 2004 ). Investigation of the interaction of plant virus particles with the innate immune system is an area of research that must be addressed in order to make plant virus-based epitope carriers competitive with other systems.
