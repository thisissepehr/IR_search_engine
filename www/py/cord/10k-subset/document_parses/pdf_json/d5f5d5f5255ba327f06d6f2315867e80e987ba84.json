Severe combined imunodeficiency syndrome (T\u2212, B+, NK+), B lymphoproliferative disease and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis triggered by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were diagnosed. As his clinical situation deteriorated rapidly, BMT was performed with unmanipulated marrow stem cells from his EBV-positive HLA-identical sister after conditioning with dexamethasone (1.75 mg/kg/day), cyclophosphamide (114 mg/kg) and etoposide (10 mg/kg), with no immunosuppression given post transplant. Engraftment occurred on day 6 with explosive proliferation of donor CD8 + T cells. The patient died 3 days later from acute respiratory distress syndrome. Autopsy revealed full donor engraftment and no signs of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or B lymphoproliferative disease. Thus, transplanted T cells can expand very rapidly within days after BMT and clear EBV lymphoproliferative disease and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.",

Cardinal symptoms are fever, hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia. 6 Without treatment, mortality from infection-associated HLH is as high as 50%. If virus-associated HLH worsens despite anti-viral therapy, chemotherapy with steroids and etoposide or even BMT is recommended. 6, 7 We report a case of sibling bone marrow transplantation in an infant with SCID (T\u2212, B+, NK+) with fulminant B lymphoproliferative disease and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis due to EBV infection. Conditioning consisted of reduced intensity chemotherapy with dexamethasone, etoposide and cyclophosphamide. LPD and HLH were effectively controlled and rapid engraftment with full donor chimerism was achieved. However, the patient died due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on day 9.",

Both LPD and HLH were effectively controlled by this regimen.",

At autopsy, aspergillus pneumonia was detected in the right lower lobe and bronchopneumonia in the left lower lobe. In addition, there was a diffuse interstitial infiltrate of cytotoxic donor lymphocytes. These lymphocytes represented an overwhelming response of EBV-specific cytotoxic donor T cells in the face of the EBV load. Acute trapping of these lymphocytes in the lungs contributed to the diffusion capacity blockage with the result that the patient could not be adequately oxygenated by mechanical ventilation and ultimately died. ARDS has also been described in patients receiving donor T cells to control EBV-associated LPD. 11 It may be speculated whether earlier administration of dexamethasone, a higher dose or the use of low-dose cyclosporine could have delayed the overwhelming CD8 response. In addition, rituximab may have helped to reduce the EBV load before transplantation in order to reduce the risk of overwhelming T cell expansion post BMT.",
