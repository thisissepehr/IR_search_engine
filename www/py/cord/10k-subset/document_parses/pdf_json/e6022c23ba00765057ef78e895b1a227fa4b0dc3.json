To this end, we propose a simple model of infection that enables to study the coincidence time of two random walkers on an arbitrary graph. By studying the coincidence time of a susceptible and an infected individual both moving in the graph we obtain estimates of the infection probability. The main result of this paper is to pinpoint the impact of the network topology on the infection probability. More precisely, we prove that for homogeneous graphs including regular graphs and the classical Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi model, the coincidence time is inversely proportional to the number of nodes in the graph. We then study the model on power-law graphs, that exhibit heterogeneous connectivity patterns, and show the existence of a phase transition for the coincidence time depending on the parameter of the power-law of the degree distribution. We finally undertake a preliminary analysis for the case with k random walkers and provide upper bounds on the convergence time for both the complete graph and regular graphs.",

In Mickens and Noble (2005) , the authors derive a threshold for the persistence of the epidemic by computing the average number of neighbours of a given node. Using a similar approach but with different mobility patterns, Nekovee (2007), Rhodes and Nekovee (2008) explore the evolution of the number of devices that are infected in terms of the contact rate between users.",

The information is transmitted between users who happen to be in each other's range. As in the case of static networks (Pittel 1987) , one may be interested in the time it takes for the rumour to be known to all users. To this end we need to understand how information is transmitted between an informed and an ignorant user. This is also relevant to patterns of opinion formation and propagation of trends on social networks (Amini et al. 2009 ). Our work gives some insight on the impact of the network structure on the likelihood of successfully transmitting the rumour.",

More precisely, we consider a simple and stylised mathematical model of the spread of infection as follows. There is a finite, connected, undirected graph G = (V, E) on which the individuals perform independent random walks following a certain rate transition matrix Q. The infection can pass from an infected to a susceptible individual only if they are both at the same vertex. We assume that the probability of the virus being passed over a time interval of length \u03c4 is 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03c4 ), where \u03b2 > 0. The parameter \u03b2 is known the infection rate. We shall focus a single infected and a single susceptible individual and ask what the probability is that the susceptible individual becomes infected by time t. This probability has been studied in the case of a complete graph in Datta and Dorlas (2004) . Here, we extend their results to a much wider class of graphs.",

In Section 2, we present our model and state our main results that relate the coincidence time of the two walkers to the stationary distribution of a (general) random walk on a graph which enables us to upper bound the probability of infection at a given time t. In Section 3, we analyse the case of the standard continuous random walk and instantiate our results for regular graphs, the Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graph and power-law networks. In Section 4, we present a more detailed analysis for the complete graph and regular graphs in the case of k \u2265 2 walkers providing tighter bounds than the ones derived in Dimitriou et al.

For p as above, the probability of connectivity tends to 1 as n tends to infinity, so conditioning on connectivity does not alter any of the estimates we shall derive later for the coincidence time on such graphs.
