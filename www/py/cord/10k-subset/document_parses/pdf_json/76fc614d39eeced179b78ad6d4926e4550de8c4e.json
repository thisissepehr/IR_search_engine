On initial examination he was alert and oriented to time and place, had preserved strength in all limbs, although presenting with very frequent clusters of myoclonus. Initial investigation with a head CT showed multiple foci of extra axial bleeding, distributed over the frontal and parietal areas. The electroencephalogram (EEG) confirmed the suspected diagnosis of myoclonic seizures, exhibiting generalized polispike-slow wave complex. Due to the multiplicity of bleeding sites, with no obvious reason for spontaneous bleeding other than regular anticoagulation, the patient was submitted to a whole-body FDG-PET in order to exclude the possibility of dural metastatic implants. FDG-PET showed areas of cortical hypermetabolism adjacent to the bleeding foci, probably reflecting an epileptogenic mechanism of cortical activation. There was no evidence of hypermetabolism directly over the extra-axial areas of bleeding, what ruled out the hypothesis of dural metastasis. A diagnosis of spontaneous subdural hematomas associated to anticoagulation was given after all other causes were excluded. The patient was treated with sodium valproate and had sustained improvement of the myoclonic seizures. The bleeding areas were eventually reabsorbed, but the patient died from complications of cardiac failure.",

The pathophysiology of the triphasic response appears to be early hypothalamic dysfunction, subsequent release of vasopressin from the degenerating pituitary and, finally,depletion of vasopressin stores. It has been difficult to identify patients at risk, but predisposing factors appear to relate both to the disease (macroadenoma, microadenoma, craniopharyngioma) and to the surgery (degree of manipulation). Successful prevention probably involves a psychological switch by not waiting until frank dysnatraemia has developed, but to act as soon as urine output and tonicity change.

In addition, ketamine has direct negative ionotropic effects and may raise pulmonary artery pressures. Caution should be employed when ketamine is used in RSE in patients with other independent risk factors for cardiac events.

Recurrent clinical seizures occurred for 6 days prior to transfer to our institution. His exam demonstrated diffuse hyperreflexia and coma; EEG demonstrated up to 2.5Hz frontally-predominant rhythmic delta but no unequivocal seizures. Extensive workup revealed no evidence of infectious, toxic, or immune-mediated encephalitis. MRI demonstrated bithalamic injury and a region of questionable periventricular nodular heterotopia in the right parietal region. Subsequently, he developed recurrent clinical and unequivocal electrographic seizures from the right parieto-occipital region. Five periods each lasting >48 hours of anesthesia-induced EEG burst suppression failed to stop seizures, qualifying him as super-refractory status epilepticus. After 6 weeks of failure to wean from anesthetia, invasive monitoring for seizure localization was carried out using strips and depth electrodes. Multiple seizures were recorded, localizing to the medial occipital lobe, which was subsequently resected along with the region of pathologyconfirmed heterotopia. Seizures gradually improved, requiring 7 anti-seizure drugs and a ketogenic diet. He regained consciousness with preserved higher cognitive functions (language, memory) and personality 6 months later as his antiseizure drugs were successfully decreased.

In prospective studies, IOH was found in up to 28% of patients with SAH compared to only 3% in retrospective studies suggesting under-reporting. This is likely because IOH is found more often in higher severity bleeds where patients cannot self-report visual loss due to decreased LOC. Patients with IOH are more likely to have worse neurologic outcomes and die more often than those with lower grade bleeds without the development of IOH. Along with fundoscopy, hand held ultrasound may be used for bedside diagnosis. ERM development is the most common intraocular complication from Terson's syndrome and occurs in 15-78% of patients. Complete or near complete return of visual acuity is less likely without surgical intervention. Visual acuity has been show to recover better and faster if PPV is performed within 90 days.
