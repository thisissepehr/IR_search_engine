It is accomplished via placement of an intrathoracic bar. This in turn provides immediate correction of the defect, but typically results in significant postoperative pain. Traditional approach has made use of TE as the gold standard for pain control during thoracic procedures. Placement is usually at the T5-T6 level or immediately below it. Continuous infusions using a combination of local anesthetic with or without opioids are usually initiated. TE may be used alone or in combination with PCA. Disadvantages of thoracic epidural are the risk of spinal hematoma, cord ischemia, epidural abscess, and profound hypotension due to subsequent sympathectomy. Enter ultrasound-guided placement of bilateral PVB with continuous infusion of local anesthetic as an alternative. Currently there is no consensus as to what the best technique is for pain control, but using regional anesthesia with a multimodal pain management approach may represent the best option. Current studies contain data with relatively small groups of patients. Future studies will need to compare existing techniques head to head with larger patient populations to determine their efficacy.",

Mirroring this trend, our institution adopted the idea of providing these services to our pediatric patient population. Incorporating the use of PNB in the setting of ambulatory surgery for the pediatric population presents its own unique challenges. The purpose of this presentation is to describe the elements involved in rolling out an ambulatory peripheral nerve block catheter program, describe our institutional evolution in regional anesthesia, and to briefly address evidence based-research in support of regional anesthesia use in this setting.",

At the center of the selection process is the ability to communicate with the family via telephone upon discharge to monitor the effectiveness of the block, and diagnose any potential complications. The necessary elements to establish an ambulatory PNB program includes the availability of experts in regional anesthesia around the clock, ultrasound technology, and availability of catheter supplies and infusion devices. In our institution, utilization of regional anesthesia began primarily with services geared toward arthroscopic procedures of knee and shoulder using single shot techniques. This step was followed by placement of continuous infusion catheters to patients who were originally scheduled for admission, and ultimately progressed to include ambulatory patients. The program was successfully initiated in October 2012. An initial query reflecting the first 2 years of activity showed that 78 patients benefitted from the program. The majority of patients received lower extremity catheters. No major complications occurred, including screening for skin infections, bleeding and local anesthetic toxicity.",

Several studies have stated that various apps are crucial or even potentially dangerous in clinical use. Patients who are using an app for skin cancer detecting lean on its reliability. For technically skilled persons it is not surprising that sensitivity of these apps which are using unclear ambient light und the ordinary build-in camera of the phone is low, but by far not for all potential users. Further apps undertake drug doses calculations. This is practical, particularly for children's medicine or to convert opioid equivalences. However, a wrong opioid dosage conversion can lead to life threatening harm. For the decision whether to use an app or not, it should be taken into account that most app developers have little or no formal medical competence. Lastly the physician should balance risks of harm against anticipated benefits for the respective clinical field of application. In order to be make that possible, it is necessary to identify potential risks including diverse risk types concerning software, hardware, sensors, display, user interface, network issues etc. A relatively easy framework to evaluate potential risks by an app will be introduced. It considers the probability of an event occurring that could lead to harm, the severity of the consecutive harm and the likelihood of a clinical error being detected. A few examples out of hundreds apps that are useful for the anesthesiologist in the field of emergency care, operation theatre and intensive care unit will be presented. Potentials and all types of risks will be identified for each, leading to a risk category A to D aiming in sensitization of the sophisticated modern anesthetist to circumspectly using the next \"discovered\" app for clinical purposes. The global economic and financial crisis is having crucial impact on European healthcare systems (1) . Pressures in health come from the requirements of an ageing population, the introduction of expensive medical technologies and greater community expectations for access to health services. However, it is evident that public hospitals could provide better care by being more efficient and reducing wasteful spending. Operating theatre (OT) services represents a significant proportion of hospital costs. In 2011-12, approximately 210,000 patients in New South Wales (NSW) had elective surgery accounting for 45% of all public admissions. This is estimated to cost approximately $1.3 billion each year or about 17% of NSW Health's inpatient services budget. OT costs averaged more than half total episode costs in a study of Australian general surgery cases. (2) Increasing the OT productivity is a wise strategy to reduce costs. One of the key methods is proper OT management and optimization of the whole process involved in the treatment of the surgical patient. The goals for OT management are: improving productivity and efficiency while maintaining high quality of care at all times. Improving efficiency means shorter case durations, rational scheduling of various types of surgery, and minimizing nonoperative time by reorganizing OT tasks. Information technology (IT) can support decision making to manage OT efficiency. Hereinafter an example of IT implementation in an operating theater.",

Utilizing simulation in the operating room environment for fiberoptic intubations to perform the fiberoptic intubation safely, calmly, and with confidence, it was elected to recreate the airway and perform a simulation prior to intubation. The airway was simulated using common tubing from the OR of approximate size, shape, and angles of pediatric larynx, trachea, and bronchi. The passage contained landmarks marked with different colors to serve as checkpoints. Several studies have been conducted in order to specifically evaluate the efficacy of bronchoscopy simulation (1). The literature has been conflicting in outcomes. A study at Penn State Hershey Medical Center found extreme standard deviations in skills when learning nasal endoscopy on a fiberoptic simulation (2) . Another study found that using a simulator could advance resident skills to levels similar to that of attendings (1). Proper use and training with the simulation equipment is paramount in creating a realistic environment (1). Simulation has been proven useful in the education of specific skill sets during anesthesiology residency. Most simulation training involves the fabrication of the operating room setting removing the learner from the operating room.

Unfortunately, there is a lack of simple and universal denominator for the magnitude of surgical invasiveness and there is no assessment tool that encompasses both, spatial as well as temporal aspects of an intervention, as well as qualitative distinction between different organs and tissues. A versatile tool to assess the invasiveness of surgery-as the \"Preliminary Universal Surgical Invasiveness Score\" (pUSIS) is intended to be-would necessarily encompass all possible stressing effects of the intervention on the targeted organs/tissues as well as on the whole body. The result should be expressed in a numerical value and applicable on any kind of surgery. For this scope pUSIS has been proposed (1). This purely observational evaluation system has been created according plausible considerations and experience, but has not yet been validated. This circumstance is the reason why it has the term \"preliminary\" in its name. Therefore a 3-phased plan for introduction of this new scoring system has been drawn: (1) this recent pilot study is a first step to prove the feasibility of pUSIS on a limited number of routine elective surgical cases, (2) a \"Delphi Exercise\" with a group of experienced surgeons and anesthesiologists to discuss and (re)-evaluate the components of pUSIS in the light of the results from this pilot study, and finally (3) a prospective multi-center validation study on a large number of cases which will obtain the final version of the scoring system. In the 1st phase, the multicenter pilot study, pUSIS values from all 80 surgeries ranged from 8 to 36. The lowest median pUSIS value of 11.5 was found for laparoscopic chole-cystectomy, the highest was 24.5 for open thoracic surgery. As extremes we found the lowest score at 8 in laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the highest score at 36 in a total hip replacement. The durations (mean\u00b1SD) of surgery ranged from 37\u00b1 15 min for laparoscopic cholecystectomy to 162\u00b145 min for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. We can conclude, that pUSIS promises to become a first step in introducing of a useful, simply obtainable, universal assessment tool for quantification of magnitude and stressing capacity of individual surgical operations. Potential benefits of having a finally validated and approved USIS are manifold in the context of decision making, outcome research and evaluation of surgical performance.",

However, at the end of the surgical procedure, recovery from such an intense block can be significantly prolonged, and pharmacologic reversal with traditional cholinesterase inhibitors is contraindicated. With the introduction of sugammadex, the surgical and anesthetic goals could be achieved by establishing intraoperative profound neuromuscular block with an aminosteroid NMBA that would maximize surgical exposure at low intra-abdominal pressure (8-10 mmHg), followed by rapid (\\5 min) and complete neuromuscular reversal with sugammadex. The literature on the actual benefits of such an approach, however, remains divided. This review will present the scientific evidence for the role of deep neuromuscular block in improving surgical exposure, decreasing intraoperative hemodynamic instability, and improving postoperative analgesia and recovery.

The circuit comprises an air/oxygen blender, an active humidifier, a heated circuit, and a single patient use nasal cannula. The system delivers adequately heated and humidified oxygen at up to 60 L/min of flow, coming close to matching peak inspiratory flow rates. This rate of oxygen delivery is considered to have a number of physiological effects: reduction of anatomical dead space, a PEEP effect, a high and relatively constant fraction of inspired oxygen, and good humidification.",

The Lecture will focus particularly on this role of HFNO. Intranasal administration is an attractive option for drug delivery. Available devices vary in accuracy of delivery, dose reproducibility, costs and ease of use. We present an evaluation of a new generation nasal delivery device for systemic and direct nose-to-brain delivery-Sipnose. We used the device to administer 3 mg intranasal Midazolam (5 mg/ml) as a part of premedication before induction of general anaesthesia. We recorded bi-spectral index value (BIS) to monitor sedation, the time until minimum recorded BIS, the sedation score evaluated by the attending anaesthesiologist, presence of the bitter taste reported by the patient and physician feedback. We compared the results with intranasal administration of same Midazolam dose using a standard commercial device. The concentration of midazolam in the blood was determined for both groups. The study population consisted in 8 ASA I&II patients for each group. Mean BIS value was 74.50\u00b1 3.196 in Sipnose group vs 87.25\u00b11.840 in commercial pump group, p= 0.0019. The time until minimum BIS value recording was 5.875\u00b1 1.619 s for Sipnose group versus 10.00\u00b11.464 s in the commercial pump group (p=0.039). Subjective assessment performed by the attending anaesthesiologist found Sipnose effective in 100% times, versus 12.5% for the standard commercial pump. Bitter taste was reported by 75% of patients from standard pomp group and by 12.5 of patients from Sipnose group. Physician feedback was excellent in 100% for the Sipnose group and only in 25% from standard pomp group.

The patient benefits from more extensive surgeries that require constant perioperative monitoring of vital signs. According to internal data of St Vincent Hospital, France (2012), in this context it is worth to mention that 74% of hospitalized patients take chronic medication; in every second case the anesthesiologist it the first doctor that analyzes in details these medications; 16% of patients practice self-medication, and in 30% of cases the name, dosage, administration regimen cannot be mentioned from various reasons. But chronic medication of the patients can interfere with the anesthesia, surgery, postoperative care or with the range of risks and complications, afferent to the perioperative period. It has become quite difficult for the anesthesiologist, a multi-tasking specialist by definition, to keep in active memory all the existent recommendations (and keep them up to date), regarding perioperative management of a large spectrum of drugs. Thus, own research have revealed that the rate of drug management errors was 28.5% regarding antihypertensives, 50.0% regarding antidepressants, 40.4% regarding anticoagulants and antiagregants, 15.4% regarding oral anti-diabetic medication (personal data). In order to diminish the probability of errors and afferent iatrogenic consequences, a soft based on an Excel (Microsoft) platform was elaborated, designed to assist the anesthesiologist in the perioperative management of chronic medication of the patient. The theoretical base of the recommendations given by the soft were made from official current recommendations of European national medical societies regarding the subject.",

Another problem was the used headset whose microphone was not to the side of the mouth, leading to understanding issues when casualties screamed in the background.",

Further studies should be created by using a better audio connection and to examine if a video connection which gives the doctor the possibility to experience the situation from the viewpoint of the paramedic could improve the results further.",
