Acute systemic immune activation, such as pro-inflammatory cytokine production, lymphocyte activation and vessel congestion, is evident; however, how these pathological events affect each tissue or organ is not understood well. Current interventions for malaria are based on the administration of anti malarial drugs aimed at killing parasites and on supportive care to reduce systemic symptoms, such as coma, high fever, severe anaemia and acidosis. In this Review, we emphasize the need to focus on host interactions with Plasmodium parasites at various tissue levels and the importance of targeting local and specific organ failure and/or pathologies during, as well as long after, infection. These pathologies might be critical for determining diagnostic as well as therapeutic targets for the development of novel adjunct therapies to be used in combination with current antimalarials. We describe new evidence and new ways of targeting infected tissues of a few, but not all, unique organs such as the brain, gut and bones. We initially summarize how the blood tissue plays a central role in the initial pathogenesis caused by Plasmodium parasites, following which we explore the interaction of infected blood tissue with specific organs composed of multiple, unique interacting tissue layers. Largely owing to limitations of space, topics regarding the sporozoite stages of infection in the liver and those on the innate immune recognition of Plasmodium para sites 28, 29 are out of the scope of this Review. In fact, Plasmodium parasites do possess several ligands used to manipulate host cell invasion that could potentially be exploited as host factor targets for anti-malaria therapy 30, 31 , a notion close to the topic of this Review, but we exclude and leave this to an excellent recent article focusing on this topic 32 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1803, "end": 1806, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2026, "end": 2029, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Pathology within the blood tissue Blood is a tissue (BOX 1) that is formed by the plasma and blood cells (that is, erythrocytes, platelets and leukocytes) and is primarily located in the blood vessels.

Plasmodium parasites (a merozoite form) are released into the bloodstream from liver hepatocytes within specialized vesicles called merosomes 33 and continue a repetitive erythrocyte-invasion cycle in the blood tissue. Merozoites released from the liver enter into erythro cytes through a very dynamic and complex process 34, 35 (FIG. 1) . Once erythrocytic infection is established, continuous destruction of erythrocytes due to schizont rupture contributes to anaemia. A moderate degree of anaemia is caused simply by the naturally occurring life cycle of para sites in erythrocytes. However, studies in both humans and mice have clearly indicated an increased removal of infected and uninfected erythrocytes that plays an essential and major role in severe malarial anaemia [36] [37] [38] . Clinical observations and mathematical modelling have suggested that for each infected erythrocyte, approximately 10 uninfected RBCs are removed during malaria 37 . Chronic anaemia may also be mediated by the generation of self-reactive anti-phosphatidylserine antibodies 42 . Phosphatidylserine on infected erythrocytes is thought to be pathologically exposed to the immune system during malaria, leading to the generation of anti-phosphatidylserine antibodies. Under usual circumstances, uninfected erythrocytes, mainly young cells called reticulocytes, express high levels of CD47, a 'do not eat me' signal 43, 44 , which allows them to escape from phagocytosis. However, young erythrocytes generated during malaria expose phosphatidylserine earlier, thus leading anti-phosphatidylserine antibodies to bind to uninfected erythrocytes and facilitate their clearance, contributing to chronic anaemia. One of the outcomes of the destruction of high numbers of erythrocytes during malaria is an increase in intravascular haem release 45, 46 , which is an important factor for neutrophil activation 47 but in turn could be the reason for increased oxidative damage and thus decreased macrophage function and the neutrophil exhaustion observed during malaria. This implies that not only erythrocytes but also blood tissue components including various leukocytes collectively react to the presence of Plasmodium parasites (covered previously by seminal review articles 35, 48, 49 ) and their related products in the blood circulation and tissues (FIG. 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 331, "end": 334, "text": "34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 786, "end": 790, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 791, "end": 795, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 796, "end": 800, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1413, "end": 1416, "text": "43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1836, "end": 1839, "text": "45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2268, "end": 2271, "text": "35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2272, "end": 2275, "text": "48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 338, "end": 346, "text": "(FIG. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2345, "end": 2353, "text": "(FIG. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Erythrocytes undergo extensive deformation and remodelling after invasion by Plasmodium parasites.

Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection in mice shows a similar sequestration phenotype [52] [53] [54] [55] , and in this instance, sequestration via CD36 may be beneficial for the survival of the parasite 56 . It is believed that infected erythrocytes, mostly those in the schizont stages of parasite infection, adhere along with activated leukocytes (mainly CD8 + T cells) to the endothelial cells of small blood vessels in the brain via binding to CD36, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM1) [57] [58] [59] [60] . However, endothelial cell acti vation can occur without direct adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelial cells, possibly as a result of metabolites produced by leukocytes or parasites 61 . Indeed, there are unidentified soluble factors released by iRBCs that cause endothelial cell pathology 62 . In line with this, endothelial cells, iRBCs, platelets, leukocytes and monocytes were shown to increase their release of extracellular vesicles during Plasmodium infection, and this contributed to inflammation and correlated with disease severity 63 . Extracellular vesicles are mostly released from iRBCs during schizogony and contain RBC components, parasite proteins and various RNAs that can activate innate immune cells 64 . In addition, endothelial cells have been shown to act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) through the phagocytosis of merozoites and the presentation of malarial antigens to CD8 + T cells, which leads to IFN\u03b3mediated and perforin-mediated disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) 61 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 596, "end": 600, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 601, "end": 605, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 606, "end": 610, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 611, "end": 615, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1107, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1108, "end": 1112, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1117, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1118, "end": 1122, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Sequestration and inflammation."}, {"text": "Most of these models of malaria-induced pathology are still under debate, and more evidence from both humans and animal models is clearly needed.

Therefore, the interaction of perivascular spaces with small blood vessels may vary depending on the anatomical location and unique architecture of the tissue, for example, in the brain cortex, spinal cord, cerebellum or olfactory bulb.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 391, "end": 394, "text": "53,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 854, "end": 858, "text": "101,", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Neurovascular coupling"}, {"text": "The back of the eye ball is lined by the retina, with the optic nerve in the middle and going through to the brain.

The retina is rich in photo receptors, nerve cells and complex blood vessels, especially capillary structures (FIG. 3b) . Retinal changes (such as haemorrhages, multiple peripheral and macular patchy whitening areas and papilloedema) have been commonly observed in children and in adults who develop sudden comatose cerebral malaria symptoms after a few days of fever [103] [104] [105] . These retinal changes occur in areas that show high sequestration of parasites accompanied by thrombi (composed of fibrin and platelets) 106, 107 , which cause impaired capillary perfusion 108, 109 and are well correlated with the severity of disease 110 . Interestingly, other areas in the eye, such as the optic nerve head, ciliary body and iris, are similarly affected by iRBCs 110 , indicating that specific blood vessel similarities may occur within other parts of the brain. Retinal homeostasis is maintained through neurovascular coupling involving astrocytes, M\u00fcller cells (a specific type of glial cell found in the retina) and resident retinal microglia, with M\u00fcller cells, pericytes and astrocytes mainly ensheathing the retinal blood capillaries 111 . The observation that the accumulation of fluid between processes of M\u00fcller cells and photoreceptor cells in the macular area produces intra-retinal spaces in human cerebral malaria 107 suggests that these areas represent perivascular-space-like areas in the retina that support immunological events similar to those that occur in the perivascular spaces in deep brain areas.

The olfactory bulb is situated on the cribriform plate, located on top of the nasal sinus. Although the olfactory bulb has several characteristics that distinguish it from the brain, it is covered by similar meningeal structures and by the CSF and is thus included in the CNS. However, in contrast to other parts of the brain, olfactory nerves initiate from the nasal mucosa and terminate in the olfactory bulb through the cribriform plate, which is also the route of the blood vessels surrounding olfactory nerves. These olfactory nerves project any signals for odour to the olfactory bulb and to the brain. Inside the olfactory bulb, very dense blood capillaries are oriented in different directions (radially and tangentially) with thin astrocyte end-feet surrounding the vessels (FIG. 3c) . Owing to complex structural interactions of nerves through the cribriform plate, capillaries, microglia and astrocyte endfeet in this region, the olfactory organ is considered to be the gateway of the otherwise well-protected brain to the outside world. It is known that several molecules, cells and even pathogens can gain access to the brain parenchyma through this route 113 . By use of 11.7 T MRI in mice, it was discovered that the olfactory bulb is the first region during experimental cerebral malaria to show vascular leakage and bleeding 53 , a phenomenon possibly related to the unique small capillary trabecular structure of the olfactory bulb. This was also directly visualized and confirmed by intravital two-photon microscopy during cerebral malaria 53 . These dense and directionally structured olfactory blood capillaries 114 , which are thought to be leakier than those in the brain cortex or pons 115 , are a suitable scaffold for iRBCs 53 . Sequestration of iRBCs in the olfactory bulb capillaries results in astrocyte and microglia activation 53, 76, 98 and in the loss of tight junction integrity, and these parasite-mediated events lead to olfactory dysfunction and loss of smell, which could be a valuable early diagnostic marker for cerebral malaria. Moreover, astrocytes surrounding small trabecular capillaries in the olfactory bulb were found to sense changes in the vessels and secrete cytokines and chemokines, such as CC-chemokine ligand 21 (CCL21), which are involved in the accumulation of pathological CXCR3 + CD8 + T cells in the olfactory bulb 53 . Expression of CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7), which is the canonical receptor for CCL21 and CCL19, was shown to be essential for antigen cross-presentation by CD8\u03b1 + dendritic cells and for the activation of CXCR3 + CD8 + T cells in the spleen during cerebral malaria 53 . By contrast, CCL21 secreted from astrocytes played a role in the recruitment of pathological CXCR3 + CD8 + T cells in the olfactory bulb via its non-canonical receptor CXCR3 (REF. 53) . A pathological role for several chemokines and chemokine receptors (including CXCchemokine ligand 4 (CXCL4), CXCL10 and CXCR3) is well recognized in experimental cerebral malaria 116 , but the study discussed above 53 highlights how the specific role for chemokines in cerebral malaria might differ depending on the tissue and organ environment.

There is a gut-vascular barrier comprising endothelial cells, enteric pericytes and enteric glial cells that is very similar to the barriers found in other parts of the body (such as the BBB) and that actively blocks bacterial dissemination from the gut epithelium to the blood 130 .

Arteries in the bone marrow unite and become specialized vessels called bone marrow sinusoids, which allow cells to pass between the circulation and bone marrow 131 . Without any cyto adherence, Plasmodium parasites can invade and multiply in nucleated erythroblasts located in extravascular spaces of the bone marrow [132] [133] [134] . The parasites can survive and hide in these erythroid precursors and develop into gametocyte stages [135] [136] [137] , likely assisting in the continuous success of malaria transmission to mosquitoes. However, it is still not known why Plasmodium parasites preferentially differentiate into gametocytes in the bone marrow and whether a specific bone marrow niche is required to support the development of gametocytes. Unlike haematopoietic niches, which are located adjacent to sinusoids, erythroid niches are found throughout the bone marrow and are generally located away from the sinusoids, although they move closer to the sinusoids as they mature 138 . This may suggest a major role for the erythroid niche in Plasmodium gametocyte development. From an immunological point of view, it has recently been shown that CD8 + T cells produce IFN\u03b3 in response to infected MHC class I-expressing erythroblasts residing in the bone marrow; by contrast, mature erythrocytes residing in the blood circulation lack any MHC molecules and cannot present antigens to CD8 + T cells 132, 139 .

Although it is not precisely known how Plasmodium products are retained long term in the bone marrow, it is possible that engulfment by macrophages or other phagocytic cells, such as bone-resident osteoclasts, or trapping by extracellular matrix in the bone marrow contributes to this phenomenon 27 . Chronic bone loss during malaria infection is mediated by over-activation of osteoclast resorption activity.
