The 1918 pandemic killed at least 40 million people worldwide and pandemics in 1957 and 1968 caused hundreds of thousands of deaths.

Four of these differences are in the extracellular domain of M2, which is encoded by a reading frame that overlaps with that of the completely conserved M1 carboxyl terminus, indicating that it came from a source that differs markedly from the currently known avian sequences. It is possible that some of these four changes reflect human adaptation. If this is the case, it would indicate that the MA genome segment might have been retained in the 1918 pandemic virus from the previously circulating human influenza virus 21 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES"}, {"text": "The non-structural (NS) genome segment is unusual among influenza gene segments in that two distinct alleles, A and B, are found in wild birds. Phylogenetic trees of both NS1 and NS2 position the B allele as an outgroup, and sequences of strains found in gulls and H7N7-subtype equine strains also form distinct clades. The topography of the other large clade is similar to that of M1, with a mammalian clade containing human and swine subclades, and an avian clade containing one subclade of Eurasian birds and another of North American birds and horses. The NS phylogenetic tree differs from the M1 tree in that a small group of old, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (previously called fowl plague viruses) is found at the root of the mammalian clade. The 1918 NS sequence, as with all the other 1918 gene segments, is found within and near the root of the mammalian clade 20 . NS1 sequences are more diverse than M1 sequences, making it difficult to generate a consensus avian sequence. Within the Eurasian avian clade, sequences differ by as many as 25 nucleotides and six amino acids (comparing A/Chicken/Victoria/1/85 (H7N7) and A/Chicken/Hong Kong/220/97 (H5N1), for example). Within the North American avian clade, sequences differ by as many as 16 nucleotides and two amino acids (comparing A/Pintail/Alberta/119/79 (H4N6) and A/Gull/Delaware/475/86 (H2N2)). Given this diversity, as the 1918 NS1 sequence differs from the most closely related avian sequence, A/Mallard/New York/6750/78 (H2N2), by 24 nucleotides and four amino acids it seems possible that the 1918 NS segment was acquired directly from an avian strain. Eighty years later, the human NS1 lineage (using A/Shiga/25/97 (H3N2) as an example) had accumulated another 39 nucleotide and 33 amino acid differences from the 1918 strain, consistent with the hypothesis that the 1918 NS had not circulated in humans for a long time before the pandemic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 884, "end": 886, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Non-structural proteins"}, {"text": "NS2 sequences are more conserved than NS1, with avian sequences varying from each other on average by 10 nucleotides and 1-3 amino acids.

Since 1918, modern human NS2 sequences (again using A/Shiga/25/97 (H3N2) as an example) have accumulated another 26 nucleotide and six amino acid changes.
