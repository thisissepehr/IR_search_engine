Therefore, non-pharmacological interventions will be important, including the use of respirators and/or medical masks, which is able to confer respiratory protection. [4] [5] [6] If hospitals are to continue to function adequately during a pandemic, reliable access to effective protection strategies for healthcare workers (HCWs) will be imperative. Reducing transmission to HCWs may not only help support the healthcare workforce, but may also prevent influenza transmission to patients. 7 It is commonly acknowledged that adherence with an intervention can change with perception of risk during a pandemic or an out-break of unknown origin. Since the epidemic of SARS in Beijing in 2003, awareness and commitment to infection control increased, including the use of masks among HCWs. However, we are not aware of the exact rate of and adherence to mask-wearing after the SARS outbreak in 2003. Furthermore, we commonly assume that frontline HCWs are at increased risk of respiratory infection, but to the best of our knowledge there is no data examining this in our setting.

Their efficacy is graded on the level of protection the material offers, assuming a perfect fit and optimal compliance. 16 Medical masks are designed to protect the environment from respiratory droplets produced by the wearer. Research studies on the filtration and fit of medical masks show wide variation in penetration of aerosol particles (4% to 90%) and a higher amount of face seal leakage when compared to respirators. 17 The fit of cloth masks/cottonyarn masks, which are widely used in Asia, is likely to be even looser than medical masks and hence, cloth masks are likely to have a lower level of protection, suggested by the higher efficacy of medical masks found in this study.
