Five rats that were randomly selected and killed immediately upon arrival in our laboratory were subsequently found to have Pneumocystis carinii organisms in their lung tissue. An order placed to the Harlan Sprague-Dawley Company (Indianapolis, Ind) for gnotobiotic rats yielded the same result -all six of the animals shipped were infected with P. carinii. The methods and the results of this serendipitous investigation have been published in detail and should serve as a warning to those who employ \"germ-free\" research animals [3] . The Charles River Company refunded us for their \"germ-free\" rats after I visited their facility and demonstrated appropriate histological techniques for screening for P. carinii.
