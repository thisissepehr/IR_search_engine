Intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography was performed by specialized cardiovascular anaesthesiologists to confirm the preoperative diagnosis and extent of the valvular lesion. Using a standard sternotomy approach, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established via cannulation of the ascending aorta and right atrium or the venae cavae. Cardiac arrest was induced by a single dose of histidine-tryptophanketoglutarate solution or intermittent cold-blood cardioplegic solution through the coronary orifice. The diseased valves were carefully inspected, and the feasibility of valvular repair was considered after complete debridement of the infected tissues. The decision of valve repair or replacement was dependent on the surgeon's discretion regarding the degree of valvular destruction and patient characteristics, including heart function, comorbidities, and preoperative haemodynamics. For infected mitral valves that were repairable, the Carpentier principle was applied 17 , and ring annuloplasty was used to ensure the long-term durability of repair. In Regards to infected aortic valves that were repairable, a pericardium patch was usually used for reconstructing the valvular defects following debridement. If valve replacement was necessary due to limited healthy tissue, the prosthetic choice was based on the patient's individual preference after a detailed discussion before surgery. Before patients were weaned off CPB, haemostasis and good competency of the treated valve were confirmed, and a global assessment of cardiac function was performed. postoperative care and interventions. After undergoing surgery for endocarditis, all patients were transferred to a specialized cardiovascular intensive care unit (ICU) for further treatment and observation. At 8 hours post-surgery, a ventilator-weaning protocol was initiated if there was no active bleeding, unstable haemodynamics, persistent arrhythmia, or signs of organ malperfusion. Renal replacement therapy was applied if acute renal failure developed after surgery, according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria 18 . Further survey imaging, endovascular intervention, and surgical exploration for bleeding or malperfusion were performed, if indicated. Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows (version 22.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test whether the continuous variables were normally distributed. Data were presented as means \u00b1 standard deviation for normally distributed variables, whereas medians and interquartile ranges were used to describe non-normally distributed data. The independent t test was performed for comparison of normally distributed data and the Mann-Whitney U-test was used for non-normally distributed data between the two study groups.

In-hospital mortality rates and postoperative complication rates were higher in this population than in non-elderly patients.

Therefore, higher in-hospital mortality and complication rates are expected in this population. In the present study, the elderly group demonstrated a higher EuroSCORE II-estimated risk, which also addresses the inferior short-term outcome. The aging process is associated with numerous ionic, molecular and biochemical www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ changes in the heart 22,26 . These age-related changes can affect cardiac morphology and reduce the physiologic function. Therefore, cardiac aging results in decreased mechanical and contractile efficiency, and may increase the rate of cardiomyocyte apoptosis after cardiac surgery. In our study, approximately 20% of elderly patients required mechanical support following surgery, and >60% of the mortality in the elderly group was associated with postoperative myocardial failure.

The central nervous system is the most common destination of embolism, followed by the spleen, kidneys, lungs, and liver. In our study, the elderly group had a relatively lower incidence of preoperative septic emboli-related complications than the non-elderly group. We suggest several reasons for this finding. First, contrast-enhanced imaging may have been arranged more conservatively for patients in the elderly group due to the lower reserved renal function. Second, the symptoms and presentations of emboli-related complications in the elderly may not be apparent and, therefore, could have been overlooked. When the emboli-related complications have progressed to a serious stage, the timing of surgical treatment may be delayed, and the outcome is compromised. Finally, no patients in the elderly group experienced preoperative intracranial haemorrhage or cerebral mycotic aneurysm. These two cerebral complications could increase the surgical risk and induce permanent neurologic deficits. According to previous studies 15, 29 , 13% of hospital mortality and 24% of postoperative cardiac and cerebrovascular complications were reported in this high-risk subgroup.
