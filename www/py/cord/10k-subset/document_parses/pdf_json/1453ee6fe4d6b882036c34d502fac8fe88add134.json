We studied the phylogenetic relationship of 46 FMDV serotype A isolates of Indian origin collected during the period 1968-2005 and also eight vaccine strains using the neighbour-joining tree and Bayesian tree methods. The viruses were categorized under three major groups -Asian, Euro-South American and European. The Indian isolates formed a distinct genetic group among the Asian isolates. The Indian isolates were further classifi ed into different genetic subgroups (<5% divergence). Post-1995 isolates were divided into two subgroups while a few isolates which originated in the year 2005 from Andhra Pradesh formed a separate group. These isolates were closely related to the isolates of the 1970s. The FMDV isolates seem to undergo reverse mutation or convergent evolution wherein sequences identical to the ancestors are present in the isolates in circulation. The eight vaccine strains included in the study were not related to each other and belonged to different genetic groups. Recombination was detected in the L pro region in one isolate (A IND 20/82) and in the VP1 coding 1D region in another isolate (A RAJ 21/96). Positive selection was identifi ed at aa positions 23 in the L pro (P<0.05; 0.046*) and at aa 171 in the capsid protein VP1 (P<0.01; 0.003**).",

FMD causes severe economic loss in developing countries. Seven serotypes (A, O, C, Asia-1, and South African Territories 1, 2, and 3) have been identifi ed serologically, and multiple subtypes occur within each serotype. The foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) consists of a singlestranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 8500 bases surrounded by four structural proteins (VP1 [1D], VP2 [1B] , VP3 [1C] , and VP4 [1A]) to form an icosahedral capsid. The genome also codes for eight non-structural proteins (L pro , 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C pro and 3D-RNA dependant RNA polymerase) (Grubman and Baxt 2004) .",

The predominant serotype reported in India is type O, while serotype A has been identifi ed in 10% of outbreaks. The uncontrolled movement of animals, low vaccination coverage and antigenic variation within and between serotypes are factors that cause problems in controlling FMD outbreaks (Azad et al 1995) . Extensive studies on the genetic and antigenic variation of FMDV serotypes O and Asia-1 have been carried out worldwide. Unlike serotype O and Asia-1 virus, serotype A isolates have shown extensive antigenic variation (Arrowsmith 1975; Belwal et al 1986; Belwal et al 1987; Armstrong et al 1994; Azad et al 1995; Araujo et al 2002) . Several workers (Tosh et al 2004; Mittal et al 2005; Jangra et al 2005; Mohapatra et al 2008) have studied genetic and antigenic variation in Indian FMDV isolates. Continuous monitoring of the disease is essential to understand the epidemiology of the virus and the mutations that occur over a period of time. Recently, Nagendrakumar et al (2006) reported the need for continuous monitoring of the isolates in order to update the primers and probes used for the detection of Indian FMDV isolates. The present study reports the analysis of the leader protease (L pro ) and P1 coding sequences of FMDV type A virus isolated from various parts of the country between 1968 and 2005.",

All the isolates were related to the A 22 subtype and none of the Indian strains showed a relationship to the A 5 or A 10 subtypes. The various FMDV serotype A isolates could be broadly classifi ed as belonging to the South American, European, Euro-South American and Asian lineages. The Indian isolates were derived from a single major lineage that diverged from the Globally, FMDV type A is classifi ed into 10 major genotypes (genotypes I-X) based on the 1D (VP1) gene sequence with >15% nucleotide divergence among the genotypes (Tosh et al 2002a) . Since then, more variant strains have emerged in different parts of the world and the present study identifi ed three more genotypes belonging to the A IRAN 96 and A IRAN 99 lineages from the Middle East, and A 21 KENYA 64 and A EGYPT 06 from Africa. Earlier studies have shown that the Indian isolates have four distinct genotypes (Tosh et al 2002a) . Examination of the complete 1D region in the present study showed that most of the Indian isolates belong to only two major genetic lineages, though newer virus strains have appeared over time and appear to have evolved from existing Indian serotype A virus strains. Only one Indian isolate (A ORS 64/84) could be grouped with the vaccine strain A IVRI which, in turn, could be grouped with A 10 HOLLAND 42. Similar fi ndings were reported by Tosh et al (2004) wherein the phylogenetic relationships between 35 Indian type A FMDV isolates were reconstructed by Lb gene sequences using quartet-puzzling steps. The possibility of the virus originating from outbreaks in animals that had been administered a vaccine containing partially or incompletely inactivated virus could not be ruled out. Outbreaks due to escape of live virus in vaccine preparations have been documented earlier (King et al 1981) . In P1 phylogeny, the genotype distinctions were supported by bootstrap values \u226598 of the 1000 bootstrap replicates. However, as reported by Tosh et al (2002a) , IND 17/77 (genotype IV) was supported by low bootstrap values that could be due to limited phylogenetic information on related viruses. The probable extinction of genotype IV was the explanation provided, since none of the isolates were grouped with genotype IV in both the phylogenies. Further, the isolates were clustered into distinct genetic subgroups (<5% divergence) within genotypes VI and VII. Examination of the P1 phylogeny (phylogenetic trees not shown) showed temporal grouping patterns of the isolates rather than geographical clustering within subgenotypes, indicating their widespread distribution. This geographical intermixing of isolates could be due to unrestricted animal movement in the country. Partial vaccine coverage, indiscriminate movement of cattle within India and involvement of small ruminants in the epidemiology might have contributed to the distinct evolutionary pattern in India. Similar fi ndings have been reported by Araujo et al (2002) , wherein a high degree of genetic and antigenic variability was seen among the strains of serotype A FMDV isolated from foci of FMD in Brazil in 1994 and 1995. Such variability was particularly evident when these viruses were compared with the A 24 BRAZIL 55 strain.",

Genetic comparison of the L pro and VP1 coding sequences of A IRAN 96 and A IRAN 98 reveal that these two isolates are related to one of the earliest vaccine strains A IND 57/79. The similarity of the sequences may be due to the extensive mutations that occurred in these two isolates, which reverted to those isolates that were in circulation earlier rather than being introduced from outside sources. However, the VP1 and L pro trees show non-congruous results and it is only in the VP1 tree that the Middle Eastern and A IND 57/79 viruses look similar. This suggests a common origin for these Middle East Asian and Indian viruses, perhaps due to a recombination event or due to back mutations in VP1. The current WRL reports reveal that the outbreaks of 2005 in Iran and Turkey were caused by isolates that were different from both A IRAN 96 and A IRAN 99 but similar to A 22 IRAQ 64 (WRL- FMD Network Report 2006) , and this could be an evidence for reverse mutations or, more likely, convergent evolution. This may be due to vaccine pressure and re-emergence of old virus strains. However, it must be noted here that A IRAN 99 does not relate to A IND 57/79 or any of the Indian isolates, at least on comparison of the VP1 coding sequences, though it belongs to the same geographical area as the other Middle East Asian isolates.",

Until recently, there was only one report available on recombination within the FMDV coat proteins involving isogenic parents (King et al 1982) . The report of Tosh et al (2002b) provided direct evidence of recombination in the structural protein-coding region in type A FMDV involving two heterogenic parents. One Indian serotype A isolate A IND 170/88 was discovered as a recombinant of genotypes VI and VII that circulated in India. Recombination, particularly in the structural protein-coding region, may provide selective advantage to the virus, as the pre-existing immunity towards either of the parental viruses may not afford complete protection. This is of particular concern in countries where multiple FMDV genotypes co-circulate (Tosh et al 2002b) . In our study, we found that recombination can also occur at the 5' end of the virus, which includes the L pro coding region. However, the progenies of the isolate A IND 20/82 failed to establish themselves into separate genetic groups over a period of time. Also, the recombination event in the VP1 region of isolate A RAJ 21/96 showed that recombination can occur at any place in the genome. However, it was not necessary that such recombinant virus strains could become ancestors to form a distinct genetic group. Moreover, this isolate was not neutralized by any of the reference vaccine sera except rabbit convalescent sera raised using A TNAn 90/94. This could be due to a sharing of the immunodominant sites that are present in the VP1, VP2 and VP4 regions but not in the VP3 region, which matched with A IVRI and A ORS 64/84.",

            "text": "Studies based on monoclonal antibody-resistant mutants have identifi ed 36 amino acid sites that are critical in the antigenicity of FMDV type A (Thomas et al 1988; Baxt et al 1989; Bolwell et al 1989; Saiz et al 1991) . Mittal et al (2005) identifi ed six additional sites. In this paper, we report another site (171 in VP1) that is under positive selection. Incidentally, this site is present within the major immunodominant site or the antigenic epitope within the G-H loop and is a conformation-dependent site. However, positive selection of site 154 described by earlier workers (Tosh et al 2003) was not signifi cant (P>0.05) in our study. This could be due to the epidemiological nature of the disease and the distinct evolutionary pattern that different virus strains in India underwent. Aggarwal and Barnet (2002) found that the antigenic sites reported are far from complete, and yetunidentifi ed sites might also be important in the induction of a protective immune response. Importantly, some of these sites may be present in and around the loop region of structural capsid proteins such as 171, which was signifi cant in the Indian isolates compared. It was previously proposed, through amino acid sequence alignments, that L pro of FMDV belongs to the family of cysteine proteinases (Gorbalenya et al 1991) . Recently, the crystal structure of the FMDV L pro from O1Kaufbeuren was determined (Guarn\u00e9 et al 1998 (Guarn\u00e9 et al , 2000 , confi rming Cys51 and His148 to be the catalytic residues as well as the papain-like fold. As expected, the catalytic triad of the proteinase (Cys52-His149-Asp164) was conserved. In this study, no difference was found in the length of L pro . However, it has been reported that in type A isolates from Kenya, namely, KEN/37/84 and KEN/1/76, the leader proteinase L pro was found to be 202 and 201 amino acids in length, respectively. All the European type A, O and C isolates had 201 amino acids. The corresponding region of the SAT serotypes, and the type A and O isolates from West Africa had 199 residues. The most variable regions in L pro were found to be a-helices 2 and 3, b4, the loop to b5 as well as the C-terminal extension (CTE). The evidence for positive selection in the L pro region indicates that the immune mechanisms are active even at the L pro region where the viral protein initiation sites are present. The viruses circulating in these regions are under immune pressure in some part of their evolutionary path due to a low level of antibodies. Therefore, antibody-combining sites are more likely to be under positive selection due to immune pressure (Tosh et al 2003) ; however, positive selection in the L pro region identifi ed in this study shows that some intracellular selection pressure is in operation for the initiation of viral replication in the host. Such a selection may be responsible for selective binding of the ribosome for initiation of virus protein synthesis resulting in the generation of virus that can cause clinical signs even in vaccinated animals. Such a hypothesis needs to be confi rmed using in vitro studies using modifi ed L pro sequences encoding these changes in the amino acid sequences. The signifi cance of positive selection on residue 23 is important as it is close to the second initiation codon (AUG) in the open reading frame (ORF) of the viral genome, as most of the viral proteins are said to be initiated from the second initiation codon in FMDV to produce L b predominantly rather than using the fi rst initiation codon in the ORF to synthesize L pro .",

This fi nding indicates that the Indian isolates were derived from a single major lineage related to A 22 represented by A 22 IRAQ 24/64, and later diverged into different sublineages. Five major sublineages (L1, L2, L3, L4 and L5) could be recognized. The predominantly circulating sublineage L5 consisted of Indian isolates that emerged after 1994. Post-1995, the virus diverged into many groups and the latest of them were isolates from the state of Andhra Pradesh, A APS 44/05, A APS 50/05, A APS 55/05 and A APS 66/05. None of the Indian isolates except ORS 64/84 was related to the vaccine strain A IVRI. Incidentally, this vaccine strain was closely related to A 10 HOLLAND 42. A signifi cant fi nding is that the L pro region of A IND 57/79 closely matched that of A IRAN 98, while A IND 19/76 and A IND 5/68 closely matched that of A IRAN 96.Serotype A isolates of the world were grouped as European, Euro-South American, South American, African and Asian (tree not shown). The Asian group of viruses constitutes those predominantly of Middle Eastern origin and those from the Indian subcontinent. The virus strains from the Indian subcontinent have evolved into different genetic groups during the past 37 years and post-1995, serotype A viruses established themselves as the major genetic groups. Most of the circulating viruses had evolved from this lineage. The recent isolates of 2005 were categorized into a separate subgroup and were closely related to A IND 57/79. Based on the NJ tree analysis, the FMDV serotype A virus was divided into 13 distinct genetic groups (G-I to G-XIII) and the Indian isolates could be classifi ed under four genetic groups (G-IV, G-VI, G-VII and G-XII). The vaccine strain A IND 17/82 represents G-VI and A IND 17/77 was placed in G-IV. A IVRI was grouped with European isolates in G-I, which included A 10 HOLLAND 42.Vaccine strains A 24 BRAZIL 55 represented the South American isolates (G-V). Further, the isolates of South American origin were categorized in three different genetic groups (G-I, G-II and G-V). A 22 IRAQ 24/64 representedFigure 1a.
