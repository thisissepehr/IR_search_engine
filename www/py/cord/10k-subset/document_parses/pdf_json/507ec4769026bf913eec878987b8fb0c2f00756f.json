The range of 5-year survival rates post-PM-ectomy in several large patient series is 35-48% for miscellaneous neoplasms. [12] [13] [14] The bleaker prognosis for HCC may be attributable to its naturally malignant characteristics and that should serve as a reminder of the importance of prognostic factors when selecting candidates for PM-ectomy. Widely investigated in the literature, the prognostic factors are DFI, PM number and size and complete PM resection. The results of prognostic analysis for HCC PM-ectomy have only been reported for one sample of 20 patients; however, no significant factor affecting overall survival was identified. 2 In the present series, the host and PM factors did not significantly influence overall survival. Of the primary tumor factors, high alpha-fetoprotein level (?100), close resection margin (<1 cm) and short DFI (<12 months) were associated with a significant decrease in the overall survival from univariate analysis. Peng et al. also indicated that high alphafetoprotein level was a significantly unfavorable prognostic factor in patients undergoing curative hepatectomy of primary HCC. 15 Nakajima et al. demonstrated that positive resection margin decreased the disease-free survival but did not affect overall survival. 2 In our study, DFI was an independently prognostic indicator from multivariate analysis (Table 2) , however, the significance demonstrated by Nakajima et al. was not confirmed. 2 These researchers defined DFI as the interval between primary liver surgery and PM diagnosis, however, we suggest that the interval to cancer recurrence (not restricted to lung) can better reflect the aggressiveness of the primary tumor. The shorter DFI is because of the more aggressive biology of the primary tumor, and ultimately determines the poorer overall survival. 12, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] In the present study, DFI remained a significant factor in Cox\u00d5s model, where DFI (in months) is taken as a continuous variable, avoiding the bias inherent in adoption of a single, occasionally arbitrary, cutoff value in univariate analysis. Should the patient with unfavorable factors not be considered as a candidate for PM-ectomy? What is the minimum DFI for HCC PM-ectomy? These questions cannot be answered based on the currently available information. Our data show that the overall survival for patients with shorter DFI (<12 months) was still superior to that of analogs treated nonoperatively. 1, 9 However, we cannot arbitrarily conclude that all patients with PM from HCC should undergo PM-ectomy. Although selection bias and small sample size are the limitations of the present study, conducting a prospective, randomized trial is problematic because of the small number of candidates available for HCC PM-ectomy.

However, the opinion against thoracoscopic approach is largely based on the inability to perform bimanual palpation of the whole lung to detect subclinical lesions missed with traditional CT scan. 24 It appears likely that the probability of this false negative finding will decrease as CT imaging technology and related techniques continue their rapid and seemingly inexorable advance. The multislice spiral CT improves nodule detection because the entire lung can be scanned at high resolution during a single breath hold without an intersection gap.

Larger number of PMs is associated with higher risk of PM recurrence and more frequent follow-up is mandatory for patients at risk of disease recurrence.
