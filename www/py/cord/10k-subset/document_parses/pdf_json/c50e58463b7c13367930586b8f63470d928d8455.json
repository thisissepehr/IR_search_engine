The author hereby proposes that the transmission on the avian flu virus through the N-95 mask is feasible. Indeed, the possibility that SARS, a virus of similar size to the avian flu, can pass through the N-95 mask has also been reported [4] . In addition, the N-95 mask also has about a 10% leakage problem around the mask [3] . It should also be noted that N-95 masks, at best, provide a seal with external leakage in the 3%-5% range. This assumes that the wearer of the mask has been properly fitted for the mask and is wearing the mask properly. The amount of inspired air that would bypass the filter and be brought around the filter and into the respiratory tract may be considerably larger. This is most apparent in individuals who are not wearing a mask correctly or who are not adequately trained in the proper fit of an N-95 mask. This is particularly problematic for family members and nonmedical personnel who may wish to use N-95 masks to prevent transmission of respiratory viruses. Therefore, there is no doubt about the possibility of the avian flu virus passing through the N-95 mask.",
