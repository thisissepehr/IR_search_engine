In order to precisely and rapidly address this concern, we used whole genome sequencing (WGS) and we could rule out a clonal outbreak by comparing all the sequenced strains and by detecting the identification of 14 to 32 core-genome SNPs in the three pairs of closely related strains. This number of SNPs was much higher between the Swiss isolates taken less than 3 months apart compared to the 0-4 SNPs difference reported by Engelthaler et al. [4] when comparing clonal isolates drawn during a similar 3-month period. Moreover, Beres et al. [27] described a mean rate of 1.7 SNP/strain/year in the core genome, dating divergence of our closest isolates at about 8 years before sampling. We are confident that even the isolates bearing only 14 SNPs of difference in their core genome (ISR7 & ISR8) did not come from the same clone because they also had variations in their accessory genomes with different phage regions. Thus, this study showed the high discriminatory power of WGS, its possible application in clinical microbiology and emphasized the Fig. 1 Phylogenetic representation of the sequenced strains during our study and the complete GAS genomes publicly available on NCBI. The phylogenetic tree was made using Parsnp and is based on the core genome alignment of our 11 isolates (in red), the currently 51 complete genomes available on NCBI (Table S1 ) and seven other genomes of S. pyogenes recently sequenced in our institute (from CV1 to CV7, taking part in another study). The tree was rooted at midpoint. Stars indicate bootstraps below 0.9 limitation of emm-typing and MLST, which did not allow differentiation of closely related strains of S. pyogenes. The use of WGS enabled rapid (<10 days) exclusion of a clonal outbreak, which reassured clinicians and public health authorities. This short time-to-result period had a positive impact on sparing hospital hygiene/public health measures, thus reinforcing its cost-effectiveness. All strains were recovered from severe invasive GAS infections and thus, the analysis of the virulome was very interesting. However, the major limitation of the investigation of the genetic basis of the virulence of particular strains is the exhaustiveness of public databases. Here, we used only the curated and commonly used VFDB. Interestingly, all the isolates encoded between 2 to 5 genes homologous to known superantigens (mean = 4), but only five patients developed a toxic shock syndrome, thus supporting the evidence that the finding of CDS does not correlate with virulence [9] . Consistent to previous observations [28, 29] , emm22 and emm89 isolates lacked the complete has-operon, although they were collected from patients with severe clinical presentation, thus emphasizing that hyaluronic acid capsule is not a prerequisite for increased virulence. Moreover, emm28 isolates (ISR9 and ISR11) had a premature truncation in the hasA product and did not produce an increased amount of hyaluronic acid despite the presence of mutations in covS, generally associated with increased hyaluronic acid production. In total, three mutations found in the regulatory genes rocA and covS (ISR1, ISR9 & ISR11) were previously correlated to more virulent phenotypes [24, 25] .
