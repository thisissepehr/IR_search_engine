There is a paucity of data for use of HFOV for 2009 H1N1 influenza ARDS and whether early application of HFOV decreases mortality in this subgroup of patients with severe ARDS. We performed a retrospective analysis of 19 patients who received HFOV as a rescue therapy for 2009 H1N1 influenza with severe ARDS to study the outcome predictors. Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital ethics committee has approved use of HFOV as a rescue therapy in severe ARDS and consent was obtained from next of kin. Inclusion criteria were the presence of severe ARDS (PaO 2 /FiO2 \\ 100) due to H1N1 influenza virus infection, the application of a maximal support of conventional mechanical ventilation (PEEP equal or greater than 12 cm H2O), and the use of HFOV as a rescue therapy. Patients who received HFOV treatment for less than 24 h were excluded from the analysis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abbreviations"}, {"text": "Out of the 19 patients studied, 10 survived (52 %).

In the whole cohort there was a significant improvement in PaO 2 /FiO 2 at 24 h, after initiation of HFOV (77.89 \u00b1 32.50 vs. 121.78 \u00b1 37.94, p = 0.005). Earlier application of HFOV was the only significant independent predictor of survival (p = 0.045) on multivariate logistic regression analysis. Survival odds ratio was 7.05 (95 % CI, 1.04-47.78) for every day of reduced conventional ventilation.

A recent meta-analysis had reaffirmed this suggestion [3]. However, Casper Bollen et al, [4] had suggested that prolonged conventional ventilation prior to HFOV is not associated with higher mortality. Patients in this case series, randomized to the HFOV group had received conventional ventilation at higher tidal volumes (9.30 \u00b1 2.20 ml/kg of predicted body weight), prior to initiation of HFOV.
