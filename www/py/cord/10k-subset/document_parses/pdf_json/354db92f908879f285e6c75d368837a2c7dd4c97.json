Unfortunately in many countries, especially developing countries, this gas is still used. Thirty-eight cases of methyl bromide poisoning were reported in the literature. CH3Br poisoning is usually accidental, and related to chronic, or acute exposure.

His vital signs were blood pressure: 156/57 mmHg, heart rate: 103/min, and body temperature: 95\u00b0F (35\u00b0C). The first examination of the patient revealed cerebellar signs such as ataxia, apraxia, and dysarthria. The initial level of consciousness was normal (Glasgow Coma Score (CGS) 15). The head CT scan was normal, without ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Because of meningeal signs, a lumbar puncture was performed and found only 2 cells per mm 3 . The neurological investigations were completed by a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), confirming the absence of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. A brainstem stroke was also discarded, and the basilar artery was permeable.",

There was indeed a de novo ST elevation and a Pardee wave in the inferolateral territory, with mirror images in the anterior territory. The transthoracic echocardiography revealed kinetics abnormalities in the corresponding territories and a decreased left ventricle ejection fraction at 30%. The patient also presented ventricular fibrillation, reversed after three external electric shocks. Given the fact that the patient was highly unstable, presented acute renal failure, and in the hypothesis of a septic shock, we decided not to perform an angiocoronarography immediately. The cardiogenic shock was controlled after 4 days of cardiotropic treatment by dobutamine, and the electrocardiogram was back to anterior state within 48 h, under cover of a treatment by double platelet anti-aggregation. One month later, the LVEF increased at 50%.",

The assumption of a myocardial infarction induced by the methyl bromide himself was then not confirmed. The major etiological hypothesis for this cardiac and/or coronary distress is a side effect of the severe initial shock with low cardiac output. Indeed, initial cardiac ultrasound showed localized kinetics abnormality, well correlated with electrocardiogram, which did not suggest a stress cardiomyopathy such as Takotsubo (no contrast between apex and basis of the left ventricle). A direct cardiotoxicity of the methyl bromide is quite unlikely because no similar case has been described in the literature.",

A normal renal function was finally reached in 16 days, with a creatininemia at 90 \u03bcmol/L, and a normal urinary output. This renal failure seems to be of renal type. On the first blood sample from the emergency ward, creatinine level is already more increased than the urea is. The natriuresis was never locked.

            "text": "As far as pathophysiology is concerned, several mechanisms seem to be the cause of the methyl bromide toxicity. Most of the authors have described a cellular toxic effect. Indeed, following a methylation reaction, the methyl bromide conjugates itself with glutathione to make methylglutathione, which is highly toxic for the respiratory chain [17] [18] [19] [20] . A second cause often described is the modulation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptor within the cerebellar and vestibular systems [9, 16, 21] . A third hypothesis attributes toxicity to methyl bromide metabolites such as methanethiol and formaldehyde [17, 19] . Another suggested mechanism is that methyl bromide rapidly inhibits creatine kinase activity in all regions of the brain and in other target organs. Creatine kinase is an enzyme catalyzing the conversion of adenosine triphosphate and creatine to adenosine diphosphate and phosphocreatine [22, 23] .",

Our patient presented all of them, except for seizures, which are however quite frequent in this intoxication [4] . Several complications have been described such as ARDS and acute kidney injury. Our patient experienced all these complications. Some authors reported the use of extrarenal epuration [25, 26] , but they highlight the importance of the earliness of this treatment.
