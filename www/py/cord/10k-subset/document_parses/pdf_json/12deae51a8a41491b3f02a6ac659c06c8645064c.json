It was observed that dietary low or supernutritional Se did not make renal appearance pathological changes in chicken. Low Se significantly reduced total antioxidant capability (T-AOC), glutathione (GSH) content, but malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the kidney increased and decreased glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) activity with changes in their mRNA levels. Super-nutritional Se (3.0 mg/kg) increased T-AOC and GSH contents then made them reduce, but it reduced MDA content significantly, elevated then reduced Gpx activity, and decreased TrxR activity with changes in their mRNA levels. Dietary low Se downregulated the mRNA expressions of Gpx1-4, Txnrd3, Sepn1, Selw, Sepx1, Selh, and SEPSECS. At super-nutritional Se, most selenoproteins were upregulated in chicken kidney, but Sepp2 and Sep15 was only upregulated in Se excess (5.0 mg/kg) bird. These results indicated that dietary Se status stabilizes normal renal physiology function via regulation of the selenoprotemic transcriptions and selenoenzyme activities in avian.",

Poultry is sensitive to Se content of diet [10] . Se deficiency manifested as deformation and necrosis [11] in sheep, cattle, horses, and chickens [12] . The kidney can be ruled out as a product of metabolism in the organism and maintain electrolyte balance. It could also be influenced by Se deficiency or excess, such as predominant pathological changes were convoluted tubule necroses. Concentration of free Se is the greatest in the renal cortex [13] . Se could protect the renal antioxidant function from oxidative damage [14] , and Se deficiency or excess causes a lot of selenoprotein resultant metabolic disorders in pig kidney [15] . Evidence of cellular damage (i.e., histopathologic and physiologic, including oxidative stress) was found in kidney systems of young snowy egrets [16] . Se can protect against oxidative damage which leads to the overproduction of free radicals that exert deleterious effects on the kidney [23] .",

The mRNA for a selenoprotein has two distinctive properties: UGA in the open reading frame (ORF) and a specialized stem-loop structure in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3'UTR) . The stem-loop structure is known as a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element [18] .Three unique trans-acting factors are vital for selenoprotein synthesis. tRNA[ser]sec has the anticodon for UGA. It is initially charged with serine, which is then phosphorylated by O-phosphoseryl-tRNA[ser]sec kinase [19] . The phosphoserine attached to tRNA[ser]sec is converted to selenocysteine by selenocysteine synthase, using monoselenophosphate as the Se donor [20] . Selenocysteyl-tRNA[ser]sec binds to another vital trans-acting factor, the specific elongation factor EFsec [21] . EFsec binds to the third vital trans-acting factor, SECIS-binding protein 2 (SBP2). In addition to binding EFsec, SBP2 has binding si tes for the SECIS element and t he ribosome. Selenoproteins play an important role in the kidney function. There are intriguing relationships between Se physiology and several derangements associated with acute and chronic kidney disease. Selenoproteins and selenoenzyme can protect the normal function of the kidney [22] . However, effects of dietary Se on selenoproteome in chicken kidney are yet unclear.",

Several selenoproteins have been characterized as antioxidant enzymes, serving to alleviate damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) [23] . Some antioxidant enzymes contain Se called selenoenzymes; the most important metabolic roles of Se in cells are due to its function in the active site of these enzymes, for example glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) [24] . Gpx activity is essential for avoiding peroxide-generated oxidative damage and is provided by different families of enzymes, namely selenoglutathione peroxidases (Gpx; EC 1.11.1.9; glutathione: hydrogen-peroxide oxidoreductase) [25] . The thioredoxin (Trx) system catalyzes the reduction of protein disulfides such as in ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme essential for DNA synthesis [26] ; thioredoxin peroxidases (peroxiredoxins), critical enzymes in the defense against oxidative stress [27] ; and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Most selenoproteins in the kidney are intracellular enzymes with their activities relying upon a single selenocysteine residue in their main structures [28] . Although 24-25 selenoprotein genes were identified in mammals [26] , only a few studies have determined collective responses of these genes to dietary Se concentrations ranging from deficiency to moderately high levels in chicken kidney [29, 30] . The transcriptional response of Se is dependent selenoprotein genes. Thus, systematic data are needed to link selenoprotein and relationship between Se, selenoproteins, selenoenzymatic, and antioxidant function in the kidney, and associated study on poultry is still a vacancy.",

In this study, compared with those fed with a normal Se diet, chicken fed with a low or super-nutritional Se diet display significant decreases in renal Gpx activities. It is interesting that Gpx1-4 mRNA levels increased in excess I group, whereas Gpx activity decreased. We suppose that super-nutritional Se (3.0 mg/kg) could enhance mRNA levels, but regulation of mRNA translation can be affected by many factors, such as microRNAs, or the precursor protein translation requires some modification and activation, and this process requires effects of other selenoproteins.",

TrxR is much more vulnerable to oxidative damage than Gpx [44] ; hence, its changes were different from Gpx.

In this study, to obtain whether low or super-nutritional Se would affect the renal selenoprotein transcription, mRNA expressions of all avian selenoproteins were analyzed in chicken kidney. It reported that 20 selenoprotein mRNAs in mice kidney were identified, including Gpx1, Selh, Sepw1, Selm, Txnrd1, Dio1, Sep15, and Sels that were significantly downregulated in Se-deficient kidney. In this study, Dio1, Dio2, Dio3, Selk, Selu, and Sepp1 had the same trend that increased significantly in low Se and 3.0 mg/kg Se excess but decreased significantly in 5.0 mg/kg Se excess. These results suggested that dietary Se status influenced the expressions of selenoprotein mRNAs in chicken kidney. In low Se diet, these selenoprotein mRNAs' levels increased significantly but selenoenzyme activity and antioxidant capacity decreased. One possible explanation could be the mobilization of the Se from the liver to the kidney [45] . A selenoprotein hierarchy is when Se supply is insufficient to support full expressions of all L stands for low-Se group whose dietary Se content was 0.028 mg/kg, S stands for standard group whose dietary Se content was 0.15 mg/kg, EI stands for excess I group whose dietary Se content was 3.0 mg/kg, and EII stands for excess II group whose dietary Se content was 5. the selenoproteins, the synthesis of some of them is downregulated so that others can be expressed more fully. Moreover, we suggest although Se deficiency made selenoprotein mRNAs' expression higher, these selenoproteins did not exert function or too many selenoproteins accumulating in the kidney competed with each other leading to selenoproteins not used rationally in the kidney. A 3.0 mg/kg Se excess can increase kidney function and promoted selenoprotein mRNAs' expression; however, 5.0 mg/kg Se excess might become a harmful accumulation, decrease selenoprotein mRNA level, and then damage antioxidative function. We also suggest that too much Se could cause organism disorder and lead to cell autophagy. Even more noteworthy is Sepp1 is a biomarker of Se status, the kidney is dependent on hepatically derived Sepp1 protein as a Se source, and Selu could potentially be a molecular biomarker of Se status too. Both of them may be near the top of the abundance hierarchy, so their mRNA levels increased in low Se diet. However, it needs to be further validated.",

Insufficient Se influenced organism antioxidant capacity that decreased these selenoprotein mRNA levels. Se status on mRNA regulation occurs at post-transcription; organism can reduce some selenoprotein mRNAs to save more important selenoproteins in chicken kidney because of hierarchy.

It was discovered that low or 5.0 mg/kg Se excess levels did not affect Selo or Seli. Sepp2 mRNA levels kept on increasing in low-Se and 5.0 mg/kg Se excess groups. Selh decreased all the time in low or super-nutritional Se, and Selm decreased in Se excess. These results may be due to different selenoproteins in different animal disaffinity. Insufficient Se resulted in selenoenzyme activity decrease, but mRNAs were not reduced in the meantime; 5.0 mg/kg Se excess causes selenoenzyme activity decrease with mRNAs decreasing. Se deficiency may not decrease some mRNA transcription, b u t p r e v e n t m R N A s ' t r a n s l a t i o n i n t o s o m e o f selenoproteins, and Se excess directly affects the expression of mRNAs. Ultimately, it results in the decrease of selenoenzyme activity. These discrepancies from observation let us begin to further analyze on synthesis factors related to selenoprotein.",

What we can see in our research is that dietary low Se made PSTK, Secp43, SPS2, and SAR mRNA levels increase significantly. All these gene mRNA levels increased significantly in 3.0 mg/kg Se excess. They, Rows represent the probe sets. RNA gene expression is shown using the indicated pseudo color scale from green (\u221210) to red (+ 10) relative to values. Green squares represent increased significantly (P < 0.05), red squares represent decreased significantly (P < 0.05), and gray squares represent no significant difference (P > 0.05) however, decreased in the 5.0 mg/kg Se excess samples. Some selenoproteins seemed to change as the same trend of these genes. The amounts of selenoprotein expression changes were not fully consistent with these factors. Some selenoproteins could be expressed in other ways and this conjecture should be further discussed. It reported that SBP2 is potentially reduced by the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems, facilitating its relocation to the ribosomes and reinitiation of selenoprotein translation [46] . SECp43 plays a role in the formation or stabilization of the EFSec-SBP2-Sec tRNA [Ser]Sec complex and promotes the formation and subcellular localization of the SPS1/SLA/SECp43 complex. SECp43 may also assist in the decoding of multiple UGA-Sec codons in selenoprotein and in preventing degradation of selenoprotein mRNAs by the nonsense-mediated-decay pathway [47] . Some genes can directly affect the function of selenoenzyme, resulting in kidney function to reduce, and these genes might influence each other, all linked with one another. One of these factors damaged cause of selenoprotein synthesis interruption, other related factors accumulated. We can also suggest that in low-Se diet, description of selenoprotein synthesis regulation occurs at or before the beginning of the translation for polyclonal antibody protein or UGA encoding selenocysteine terminal polypeptide; description of selenoprotein synthesis regulation occurs at or before the beginning of translation.",

From this observation, the concept of a selenoprotein hierarchy developed. In the present study, it was observed that dietary low or super-nutritional Se did not make renal appearance pathological changes in chicken. However, dietary low Se downregulated the mRNA expressions of Gpx1-4, Txnrd3, Sepn1, Selw, Sepx1, Selh, and SEPSECS. At super-nutritional Se, most selenoproteins were upregulated in chicken kidney, but Selm and Selh were downregulated. These results indicated that dietary Se status stabilizes normal physiology function via regulation of the selenoprotemic transcriptions. We hypothesize that hierarchy of regulation of the transcriptions of selenoproteome makes an important role for renal Se metabolism and transport in avian.",
