At a median of 7 days (range 1-11 days) after mechanical ventilatory support had been initiated, the pulmonary leak index for gallium-67-labelled transferrin (upper limit of normal 14.1 \u00d7 10 -3 /min) was determined. Results The pulmonary leak index ranged between 7.5 and 14.0 \u00d7 10 -3 /min in the patients studied. Two of the four patients were administered a course of aciclovir, and all four patients survived. Conclusion The normal capillary permeability observed in the lungs suggests that that HSV-1 is not pathogenic in the critically ill.

Immunodepressed patients may be susceptible to transmission and acquisition of viral diseases; alternatively, viral reactivation may occur and may contribute relatively little to morbidity and mortality. Indeed, reactivation of human herpesvirus-6 is common in critically ill patients and does not worsen outcome [16, 17] . In immunocompetent patients, however, isolation of HSV-1 may be associated with viral pneumonia, even if reactivation rather than primary infection is responsible [6, 8, 18] .
