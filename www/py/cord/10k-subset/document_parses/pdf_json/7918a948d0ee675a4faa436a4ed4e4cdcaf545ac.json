There was increased distribution of A\u03b21-40 in regions of acute vascular disruption, resulting in lower BBB permeability.

Introduction: Embolization of the draining vein during endovascular treatment of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) may result in venous outflow obstruction and hemorrhage. Anaesthesiologist can use deliberate hypotension to reduce blood flow through AVM which may be somehow helpful to prevent this scenario. Adenosine-induced cardiac arrest may facilitate the embolization too. The goal of our study was to improve the results of endovascular treatment of AVM using adenosine-induced cardiac arrest. Methods: After obtaining informed consent 13 patients (8 male, 5 female) were selected for adenosine-induced cardiac arrest during endovascular AVM embolization. Main age was 40,8\u00b16 years old. 9 of them were evaluated as III class ASA, 4 as IV. Endovascular treatment in all cases was performed under general anaesthesia. Propofol, fentanyl, rocuronium were used to induce anaesthesia, then all the patients were intubated and ventilated with parameters to keep EtCO2 32-35 mm Hg. Sevoflurane 2,1-2,6 vol% (12 cases) or desflurane 6 vol% (1 case) were used to maintain anaesthesia. Hemodynamic monitoring consisted of ECG, pulsoximetry, non-invasive blood pressure measurement. Onyx or/and Squid were used as embolic agents. CT was performed to every patient just after procedure as well as neurological examination. Results: Adenosine dosage was 0.875-1.26 mg/kg. Time of consequent cardiac arrest was 10-40 sec. There were 10 cases we administered adenosine for 1 time, in one case we had to administer it twice, in one Fig. 1 (abstract P014) .

However, cause-specific mortality is rarely reported, probably due to the difficulty of its classification. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the agreement between two expert ICU physician in the classification of the cause of death of patients supported with ECMO for either respiratory or cardiac support. Methods: Two Intensive Care Unit (ICU) expert staff physicians independently reviewed the entire medical records of all ECMO patients who died before ICU discharge from January 2011 to September 2019 at Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Milan. They were asked to choose the cause of patient's death among six categories. In case of disagreement, a third expert adjudicated the case. The two reviewers were also asked whether, in their opinion, bleeding during the last 24 hours contributed to death. ELSO definition of major bleeding [1] during the last 24 hours was also recorded for each patient. Results: Two-hundred and two patients were supported with ECMO of whom 70 (34.6%) died.

Tidal volume distribution was recorded in each condition using electrical impedance tomography, and compared to never-ventilated, spontaneously breathing subjects (NV). Results: Dorsal ventilation changed from 49% during MV breaths to 54% during MV+TTDN breaths, compared to 60% in the NV group (p=0.035).

Introduction: Shock is a common complication of critical illness in patients in intensive care units (ICUs), who are undergoing major surgery. This condition is the most common cause of death in postsurgical ICUs. Nowadays, there are different ICU scoring systems for predicting the likelihood of mortality, such as APACHE or SOFA. Nevertheless, they are used rarely because they also depend on the reliability and predictions of physicians. In these sense, gene expression signatures can be used to evaluate the survival of patients with postsurgical shock. Methods: mRNA levels in the discovery cohort were evaluated by microarray to select the most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between groups of those that survived and did not survive 30 days after their operation. Selected DEGs were evaluated by quantitative real time polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) for the validation cohort to determine the reliability of the expression data and compare their predictive capacity to that of established risk scales.

Introduction: Autotaxin (ATX, Enpp2) is a secreted enzyme present in biological fluids that catalyses the production of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA is a bioactive phospholipid evoking various cellular responses in most cell types. Upregulated ATX levels have been reported in various chronic inflammatory diseases. Given the established role of LPA in the inflammatory response, we investigated a possible role for the ATX/LPA axis in LPS-induced endotoxemia. Methods: LPS was injected intraperitoneally (20 mg/kg) in mice producing 50% ATX levels (ATX df/+ , heterozygous null mutant mice), in mice producing 20-30% reduced ATX levels upon inducible inactivation (R26CreER T2 /Enpp2 n/n mice) and in mice expressing 150-200% increased ATX levels (Enpp2-Tg mice). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. ATX activity was measured using the TOOS activity assay. Results: ATX df/+ mice that produce almost 50% reduced serum ATX levels show increased survival compared to their littermate controls. For the inducible inactivation of ATX, Enpp2 n/n targeted mice were crossed with the R26Cre-ER T2 mice and tamoxifen induction enabled temporal control of floxed gene expression. R26CreER T2 /Enpp2 n/n mice were more protected against LPS-induced endotoxemia compared to control mice. Enpp2-Tg mice overexpressing autotaxin and showing a 2-fold increase in plasma levels do not display improved survival rates compared to control group. Conclusions: ATX participates in systemic inflammation, as reduced ATX levels in circulation decrease lethality of mice from caused by LPS. The excess amount of circulating ATX does not exacerbate the systemic inflammatory response to LPS. Introduction: Pneumonia (Pn) is a prevalent and severe infectious lung disease.

Preclinical studies evaluating neuroinflammation in normal-lung MV models have not been reported. Microglia and reactive astrocytes take part in neuroinflammation and are important targets of investigation. They are responsible for modulating neuronal connections, assisting in establishing stronger synaptic connections and maintaining tissue homeostasis. Methods: Our study investigated the percentage of iba-1-positive cells (microglia), and the percentage of GFAP-positive cells (astrocytes) in the total number of cells counted (positive and negative cells per marker) in the hippocampal tissue of human-size pigs with noninjured lungs after 50 hours of lung-protective MV (MV group), compared with never-ventilated (NV) pigs. The cells were counted by machine learning software IMAGEJ. Lung-protective MV was defined as: driving pressure less than 15 cmH 2 O, tidal volume of 6ml/kg and peak pressure less than 30 cmH 2 O. Results: Six NV and six MV pigs were used in this study. The percentages of iba-1-positive cells in the hippocampus were 7% (42705 iba-1positive cells/589888 total cells) and 32% (65655 iba-1-positive cells/ 205006 total cells) respectively in the NV and MV groups (p<0.01). The percentages of GFAP-positive cells were 9% (35941 GFAPpositive cells/406235 total cells) and 18% (91156 GFAP-positive cells/ Fig. 1 (abstract P130).

The analysis is carried out using defined reagents of the external (EXTEM), internal pathways (INTEM), fibrinogen (FIBTEM) or methods to diagnose pathological or iatrogenic disorders. Limited channels may decrease time availability under certain circumstances. The combination of reagents could allow for the same information from a smaller amount of examination. We have designed the IFiTEM test, which combines internal pathway activator with a platelet aggregation inhibitor (cytochalazin D). Methods: Prospective observational study approved by the local ethical board of the University hospital, Plzen in a cohort of 80 patients over 18 years in whom a ROTEM assessment was indicated during routine perioperative or intensive care. Conventional coagulation (serum fibrinogen and platelet count) and routinely performed methods (EXTEM, INTEM, FIBTEM) were examined. The experimental IFiTEM test was performed using a combination of liquid reagents by adding cytacholizin D to the INTEM test. The maximal clot firmness (MCF), the difference of the MCF with and without the added inactivator (dIN=MCF(INTEM)-MCF(IFiTEM); dEX=MCF(EXTEM)-MCF(FIBTEM)) and conventional tests were examined. Results: Results of the ROTEM and standard laboratory tests are displayed in the Figure 1. A close correlation was observed between the MCF of EXTEM vs. INTEM (r = 0.97) and FIBTEM vs. IFiTEM (r = 0.89). Correlation between MCF(IFiTEM) and fibrinogen serum level (r=0.82) was comparable to the MCF(FIBTEM) (r=0.88).

Point of Care (PoC) devices measuring INR are commercially available but limited validation studies have been conducted for measuring INR values in intensive care patients. We therefore sought to determine whether INR measurements measured using a PoC device correlate with concurrently measured laboratory (LAB) INR values in adult intensive care patients. Methods: Using blood already collected for clotting profile measurements as part of clinical management in a convenience sample of adult ICU patients, we concurrently measured INR values using a PoC (Roche CoaguChek Pro II) and LAB (ACLTOP750 Instrumentation Laboratory) devices. The relationship between devices was assessed via correlation, Bland-Altman agreement and diagnostic predictive values.Results: In 72 independent paired INR measurements using PoC (range 1.0 -2.4) and LAB (range 0.9 -1.4) devices in 37 ICU patients (1 -4 samples/patient) we determined a Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.76 and Bland-Altman mean difference (bias) 0.01; 95% limits of agreement 0.33 (Figure 1). A PoC INR \u2264 1.2 had a 0.96 negative predictive value for a LAB INR \u2265 1.4 and a PoC INR \u2265 1.3 had a 1.0 positive predictive value for a LAB INR \u22651.4. Conclusions: PoC device INR measurements correlate relatively well with LAB measurements within this target INR range of interest in adult intensive care patients. The likely value of PoC device INR measurements for future sepsis associated coagulopathy studies requiring a threshold level of coagulopathy would be as a negative predictive tool for screening potential participants.

Understanding the experiences and related memories of potential donors' family members (FM) in a follow up clinic is crucial to identify the most relevant factors affecting OP and the associated outcomes. Our aims were to describe the effects of all phases of OP on the psycho-social wellbeing of FM, and then to gain insight into the possible causes of family refusals to organ donation (OD).Methods:Mixed-method study involving FM at 3 and 12 months after patients' death. Psychological profile was evaluated with validated tools: PWBS (psychological well-being scale), STAI-Y (state trait anxiety inventory form Y), BDI-II (Beck Depression Inventory -II), IES-R (Impact of Event Scale -Revised), ICG (Inventory of Complicated Grief). Traumatic memories were assessed with a 4-point scale. Satisfaction with care was measured with FS-ICU (family-satisfaction ICU). Content analysis was based on audio-taped semi-structured interviews. Results: 29 FM were enrolled; 18 (62.1%) were female, mean age 54.9 (DS 15.7); 11 were spouse (37.9%), 10 (34.5%) sons, 4 (13.8%) parents, 4 (13.8%) other relatives. All FM but one were Italian, 96.5% consented to OD. DBD and DCD processes were analyzed. Quality of Life's more affected dimensions were personal growth and autonomy; mean values of BDI-II (10.2), IES-R (25.2) and ICG (21.7) were below the clinical cut-off. FM showed slight symptoms of anxiety. Traumatic memories were more frequent and intense in relation with the very early stages of the process (out-of-hospital rescuing/emergency department) and with the communication of bad prognosis and death(Figure 1). Satisfaction with care was fair good.Conclusions:Preliminary data suggests that the early stages of OP and the communication of bad news deserve attention.

Veno-venous (VV) ECMO is an effective bridging strategy for patients listed for transplant, with end stage respiratory failure, who acutely deteriorate. Methods: A retrospective observational study of patients supported by VV ECMO whilst awaiting lung transplantation, over a 67-month period (March 2014-October 2019) at Harefield Hospital, in the UK. Results: 32 patients with an acute deterioration of their end-stage lung disease required VV ECMO support as a bridge to transplantation (BTT). The mean age was 34.8 years (range 19-57), 62% were male patients. Aetiology included; end stage cystic fibrosis (n=24, 75%), pulmonary fibrosis (n=4, 12.5%), previous lung transplant failure (n= 2, 6.3%), bronchiectasis (n=1, 3.1%) and pulmonary hypertension (n= 1, 3.1%). Average duration of ECMO support pre-lung transplant was 11.1 days (range 1-39 days). Cannulation was femoral-femoral (n= 20), Avalon Elite\u00ae (n = 6) and femoraljugular (n= 6). 19 patients (59.4%) underwent lung transplant on VV ECMO support, the others required conversion to veno-arterial (VA) ECMO or cardiopulmonary bypass, most commonly due to hemodynamic compromise. Average duration of invasive ventilation post-transplant was 19.8 days, with 18 patients (56.3%) requiring a tracheostomy. The mean ICU stay was Fig. 1 (abstract P069).

However, patients requiring intubation despite VV ECMO (n=7), pre-transplant had a far higher mortality (n=5, 71.4%).

However, there is little evidence if PP is able to improve outcome in veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) patients. Therefore, we performed a retrospective analysis of patients treated with PP while ECMO support.Methods:We report retrospective data of a single-center registry of all patients treated with veno-venous ECMO for severe ARDS between October 2010 and Mai 2018 at the Interdisciplinary Medical Intensive Care Unit at the Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Germany. ECMO weaning success and survival were analysed before and after propensity score matching. Moreover, predictive factors for survival in patients with PP while ECMO were analysed.Results: A total of 158 patients with complete medical data could be analysed (age 52.2 years, 67% male). 38 patients (24.1%) received PP while ECMO therapy. There was no difference in ECMO weaning rate (47.4% vs. 46.7%, p=0.940) or ICU and hospital survival (36.8% vs. 36.7%, p=0.984, Fig. 1 A) between patients with and without PP while ECMO therapy. Propensity score matching confirmed this finding (survival: 36.8% vs. 42.1%, p=0.639). However, early initiation of PP while ECMO support (cut off via Youden-Index <0.71 days) was associated with superior survival in univariate and multivariate analysis (Odds ratio 20.6 [95%-CI 1.4-312.9], p=0.029,", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF18": {"text": "abstract P077).

The aim of this study was to study predictors of intraoperative cardiac complications in pts underwent major noncardiac surgery with neuraxial block. Methods: This prospective observational study was done in 360 high risk for cardiac complication pts, underwent elective major noncardiac surgery with neuraxial block [spinal, thoracic (TE) or lumbar epidural (LE) anesthesia] alone or combined with GA & admitted to the SICU during Jan 2017-Sep 2019. Pts with ESRD or underwent arterial vas surgery were excluded. Study data included: pts demographic,comorbidities,ASA class, preop hypertensive med (beta adrenergic blocking agent, ACEI/ARB, vasodilator), intraoperative cardiac complications [significant hypotension (SBP<90 mmHg or MAP<65 mmHg>10 mins) requiring fluid resuscitation or inotropic agent, serious cardiac arrhythmias needed medication or intervention, PMI, cardiac failure, cardiac arrest, cardiac death), within 72 hours postoperative organ dysfunction (AKI, stroke) & 30days mortality. Results: Among the studied pts (age 65+16yrs), 72% was ASA III, 54% had hx of HTN. 64% underwent major abdominal surgery, 21%, 8% & 72% received spinal, spinal plus GA and TE or LE plus GA subsequently. 79% had serious intraop cardiac complications (80%, 15% & 4% had significant hypotension, PMI & cardiac arrest subsequently), 39%, 3% & 11% had AKI, ischemia stroke&delirium subsequently. 30 days mortality was 13%. From multivariate variate analysis showed age>75 yrs, hx of HTN, preop beta-adrenergic blocking agent, vasodilator, combined beta-adrenergic blocking agent & vasodilator or ACEI/ARB, high dose local anesthetic agent were significant predictors of intraop serious cardiac complications.

The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Continuous data is presented as mean (SEM). Categorical data is presented as % and analysed using a chi-squared test. A p value of <0.05 was used to determined significance. To allow for multiple comparison between data, a Bonferroni calculation was used to determine significance at a p value of <0.01. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for noradrenaline dose and area under the curve (AUC) was calculated.Figure 1). A noradrenaline dose of 0.25\u03bcg/kg/min on day 1 and 0.15 \u03bcg/kg/min on day 2 had a 70% sensitivity and 70% specificity for mortality. Median noradrenaline dose was an excellent prognostic indicator on day 3 (AUC =0.911 [0.878 -0.943]) and day 4 (AUC = 0.908 [0.879 -0.948]). A noradrenaline dose of 0.1\u03bcg/kg/min on day 3 and 0.05 \u03bcg/kg/ min on day 4 had a 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity for mortality. In patients who survived, vasopressors were weaned off within 4 days in 90% of cases. In those who died, death occurred within 4 days 88% of the time.Conclusions:Noradrenaline dose has a good prognostic ability in septic shock. In this septic shock cohort, the majority of patients that died did so within 4 days. Furthermore, the majority of survivors were weaned off vasopressors within 4 days. Therefore, by day 3 and 4, small doses of noradrenaline had an excellent prognostic ability for septic shock.P188 Early vasopressor use in the emergency department is associated with survival in patients with septic shock M Chotalia 1 , M Bangash 2 , T Matthews 2 , D Parekh 2 , J Patel 2 University Hospitals Birmingham, NHS Foundation Trust, Critical Care and Anaesthesia, Birmingham, United Kingdom; 2 University Hospitals Birmingham, NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, United Kingdom Critical Care 2020, 24(Suppl 1):P188 Introduction:This study evaluates whether vasopressor use in the emergency department (ED) and vasopressor use within four hours of arrival to ED is associated with survival in patients with septic shock. The optimal timing of vasopressor administration in septic shock is unknown. Emerging evidence suggests early administration in non-intensive care settings may improve outcomes[1].Methods:Patients with a diagnosis of septic shock (Sepsis 3) who were admitted to intensive care directly from the emergency department (ED) between April 2016 and July 2019 at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham were included. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Early vasopressor use was defined as the administration of metaraminol or noradrenaline within 4 hours from arrival in ED. Continuous data is presented as mean (SEM) and analysed using an unpaired t-test. Categorical data was analysed using Fishers exact test. Results: 87 patients had septic shock and were admitted to intensive care directly from ED. Patients were 61% male, aged 64.7\u00b11.9 years, and had a 44% 90-day mortality. Seventy-nine percent of patients had vasopressors in ED; 56% within 4 hours. The first vasopressor was metaraminol in 60% of cases.

Our aims were to check the validity of the previous US measures in predicting HF diagnosis and prognosis.Methods:This review was based on the PRISMA guideline . The systematic search of the literature published from 1941 through 30 October 2019 explored the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases. Inclusion criteria: studies who investigated the reliability, the accuracy in predicting HF diagnosis and death or re-hospitalization of the IJV, IVC diameter, IVC collapsibility index (IVC-c = IVC max -IVC min / IVC max X 100) and Common Carotid US measures in adult (>18 yrs) with HF. Five researchers selected studies using inclusion criteria and then assessed their quality using the QUADAS-2 guidelines. The key words for literature search were: common carotid, internal jugular veins, inferior vena cava, ultrasonography and heart failure.Results:We collected 744 studies: 727 excluded with reasons, 18 studies were included for the final analysis: 4 on IJV, 13 on IVC, 1 on Carotid US. A IJV ratio < 4 predicts death and readmission : HR=2.7-10. A IVC \u22652 cm and IVC-c \u226415% showed an high accuracy in HF diagnosis and a moderate validity in predicting death and re-admission : AUC=0.63-0.78; HR=1.1-5.8 for IVC; AUC=0.63-0.74, HR=0.7-6.8 for IVC-c. The LVET ( time interval between end diastole and the dicrotic notch of Common carotid artery Doppler waveform showed a good validity in predicting HF diagnosis: AUC=0.81 (95% CI, 0.72-0.87).The studies collected showed a moderate quality according to QUADAS-2 guidelines. Conclusions: Because few reports have been published on this topic the conclusions of this review should be confirmed. The IJV and IVC ultrasound measures seem to have a moderate accuracy in predicting diagnosis, death and hospitalization in patients with Heart Failure. More than 7-million transthoracic echocardiograms are performed annually in the US. These studies may reveal structural and functional cardiac abnormalities that inform clinical care in the intensive care unit. And yet, little is known about the epidemiology of baseline echocardiography, specifically among patients admitted to intensive care with sepsis.Methods:We studied electronic health records of 1,076,925 adult patients from 12 hospitals at UPMC from 2013 to 2014. Eligible patients were those with Sepsis-3 at presentation who required intensive care during hospitalization. Demographics, comorbidities, illness acuity, and baseline echo parameters (within 1-year prior to incident sepsis hospitalization) were abstracted. An abnormal echocardiogram was defined as LVEF<50%, LV diastolic dimension >6 cm, moderate/severe RV dysfunction, or moderate/severe valvular stenosis/regurgitation. We compared characteristics of patients who did and did not receive an echo, those with normal and abnormal studies, and patients stratified by in-hospital mortality. Results: Among 43,086 adults with sepsis, 8,077 (18%) had baseline echocardiographic data within 1-year of admission, on average 131 (SD 103) days prior to presentation(Figure 1). Most septic patients had abnormal echo studies (N=5782, 72%). Most septic patients admitted to intensive care have abnormal baseline echocardiography. A reduced LV ejection fraction and severe right sided heart disease were more common among deaths than survivors.Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Lund, Sweden; 2 Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, Diagnostic Radiology, Lund, Sweden Critical Care 2020, 24(Suppl 1):P194", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF78": {"text": "position K Mnif 1 , O Doukali 2 , E Unluer 3 , R Ammar 2 , C Ben hamida 2 , M Bouaziz 2 University Hospital Habib Bouguiba Sfax, Intensive Care Unit, Sfax, Tunisia; 2 university hospital habib bouguiba sfax, intensive care unit, sfax, Tunisia; 3 S.B.U Bozyaka Egitim ve Arastirma hastanesi, emergency department, izmir, Turkey Critical Care 2020, 24(Suppl 1):P195Introduction:In critically ill patients, due to long period of supine position, lung water accumulation in posterior areas,outside of lung or heart diseases, can be induced and B-lines can be observed.

However, data on p-wave measurements in critically unwell patients are lacking. This study aimed to determine whether P wave indices in our sample diverged from previously established reference values in healthy subjects.Methods:Digital ECG recordings of 49 critically ill patients admitted to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital were collected from the Clinical Information System. 19 patients were excluded due to absent or inadequate data. ECGs of 30 patients were converted to images and analysed with a new technique in ImageJ to allow measurement of P wave indices. P wave indices included P wave axis, PR interval, mean, maximum and minimum durations, dispersion, and P wave terminal force in V1 (PTFV1). Results were compared to reference values described in previous studies[1 -3].Fig. 1 (abstract P196). Ultrasound image showing the needle path and vessels in the oblique approach was greatly lower than values recorded in previous studies (66 (59, 72), 123 \u00b1 12, 111.4 \u00b1 14.7)[1,2,3]. Measurements in 6 patients demonstrated abnormal PTFV1 values of \u22654000\u03bcVms. Abnormal P wave axis was found in 5 patients. 1 patient displayed both abnormal PTFV1 and P wave axis.Conclusions:Our preliminary results demonstrate that mean maximum P wave duration, dispersion, and PR interval were altered in patients with NOAF compared to healthy subjects. 37% of patients had abnormalities in PTFV1 or P wave axis. Further research is warranted to investigate differences of p-wave characteristics in critically ill patients who do and those who do not develop NOAF.University Heart Center, Clinic and Policlinic for Vascular Medicine, Hamburg, Germany; 2 University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Center for Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Hamburg, Germany; 3 University Heart Center, Clinic and Policlinic for Cardiology, Hamburg, Germany; 4 University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Hamburg, Germany; University Medicine G\u00f6ttingen, Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany Critical Care 2020, 24(Suppl 1):P198", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF80": {"text": ", C Sandroni 1 , S Cacciola 1 , AM Dell\u00b4Anna 1 , M Pittiruti 2 , MG Annetta 1 , G Chiuri 1 , M Antonelli 1Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

To date, no publication describes the applicability of advanced hemodynamic monitoring in these patients.Methods:From March 2017 onwards we conducted a prospective, single center pilot study including all patients with an acute spinal cord injury. We excluded patients that had a preexisting cardiac condition as well as patients suffering from sepsis. Measurements were performed using the PiCCO system (Pulsion, Munich, Germany) at least 3 times a day. Results: Until December 2019 25 Patients (mean age 56 \u00b1 20 years, range 18-82) with a total of 337 measurements were included. In 19 Patients the levels of C2 to C7 were affected. Three patients had a lesion of the thoracic level and 3 subjects suffered from lumbar paraplegia. Our preliminary results do show a difference of the mean SVRI in patients suffering from acute spinal cord injury when compared to the reference range of healthy individuals. Furthermore, the SVRI is reduced in both subjects under vasopressor therapy and patients that did not receive catecholamines. We assume a complex adaptation of the cardiovascular system that can compensate for the loss of vascular resistance in the absence of vasopressors without affecting the cardiac index.P201 Establishing a focused critical care echocardiography programme in a developing world intensive care unit D Hall 1 , J Harrington 1 , M Murali 2 , TY Wang 2 , N Shamambo 2 Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; 2 University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia Critical Care 2020, 24(Suppl 1):P201", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF81": {"text": ": 26 Zambian doctors who work with critically ill patients (16 anaesthetists, 8 paediatricians, 2 physicians) were enrolled.

The predictive value of phase angle on 6 month survival after ICU admission F Stellingwerf, M Koopmans, H Buter, EC Boerma Medical Center Leeuwarden, Intensive Care, Leeuwarden, Netherlands Critical Care 2020, 24(Suppl 1):P389 Introduction: Phase angle, derived from bioimpedance analysis (BIA), reflects tissue quality and quantity in which cell mass, membrane integrity and hydration state are represented. Phase angle, as a measure of body composition, changes with the physical condition of patients and is associated with survival in several disease states and during ICU admission. We questioned whether phase angle can be used as a predictor of long term ICU outcome.Methods:A single-center prospective observational cohort with consecutive patients, admitted to the ICU between June 2018 and June 2019. Demographic data, APACHE III, comorbidity and phase angle in the first 6 hours after ICU admission were collected and the ICU-, hospital-and 6 months survival were registered.Results: Of 1025 patients included 8.5% (87) died within 6 months after ICU admission. Patients who died had a higher APACHE III score (95 [71-128] versus 56 [46-68] p<0.001), and more often sepsis or malignancy. The phase angle was lower among non survivors (4.9\u02da[4.0-5.9] versus 5.4\u02da[4.7-6.4] p< 0.001). The cut-off value for the phase angle, determined with the ROC is 4.6\u02da.

Risk adjusted mortality for high risk admissions (Figure 1) showed a significant difference (Log rank p<0.001) in mortality between patients with a phase angle beneath 4.6\u02da.

We performed a logistic regression analysis with age, sex, SOFA, DIC, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, ECMO, ALB, lymphocyte count and CRP. Independent risk factors were age, sex, and ALB.Conclusions:Among patients with infection, there was ADL weakening as PACS, and its risk factor other than age was female sex and poor nutritional status on admission.NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Glasgow, United Kingdom; 2 University of Glasgow, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Glasgow, United Kingdom Critical Care 2020, 24(Suppl 1):P391 Introduction: Unplanned readmission to acute care following hospital discharge after critical illness has a significant impact for patients, caregivers and the healthcare system[1]. Drivers for unplanned readmission include pre-ICU functional status as well as the social circumstances which a patient returns to[2]. At present, there is limited understanding of the impact of cognitive function and whether this plays a part in the readmission process. The aim of this study was to undertake cognitive screening during the readmission episode to understand if ongoing cognitive impairment was still present in this patient group. Methods: Ethical approval was granted from the West of Scotland Research Ethics Service (approval number 19/WS/0091). We used a single centre cohort study design. Using a clinical database, we identified those patients who had an ICU admission \u2265 3 days who were readmitted to acute care within 90 days of hospital discharge. The researcher attended the ward and after discussion with the current direct care team and screened patients using the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) tool[3].Results:The cut-off scores were: 24-30-have normal cognition; 19-2-mild cognitive impairment; 10-18-moderate impairment and \u2264 9 severe impairment. Baseline demographics of this cohort are shown inFigure 1. 11 patients were screened during a readmission to acute care. 8 patients were found to have normal cognition (72.7%). 23.3% of patients had some degree of cognitive impairment: 2 (18.2%) had mild cognitive impairment and 1(9.1%) had moderate impairment.Conclusions:In conclusion, patients discharged from ICU have continuing cognitive impairment.

Retrospective analysis of data, adjusted for ICNARC score was performed on CC emergency admissions using STATA 14, combining CFS, patient demographics and outcome data from our electronic records. Logistic regression was used for mortality prediction. We defined non-frail as CFS<4. An age cut-off of 70 years was used for the age adjusted model, as remaining life expectancy (RLE) at age 70 years has recently been shown to be equal to RLE at age 65 years before[2]. Results: Total number of patients was 556 (male-58%) of which 140 (16.5%) died in hospital. Importantly, in the patients <70 years (n=529), 137(48%) had CFS<4. The number of elective and emergency admission were 292(34%) and 556(66%) respectively. The risk for mortality (OR) in the adjusted model with age and CFS cut off were 2.65 (1.61, 4.35) and 2.35 (1.44, 2.83) respectively. Both of these mortality prediction models, one incorporating age cut-off 70 and the other based on CFS, show equal performance of discrimination (AUROC 0.88)(Figure 1).Conclusions:Our data supports an association between increasing CFS and mortality for the CC population independent of age.

Risk factors for dysphagia in ICU patients following invasive mechanical ventilation P Zuercher, NV Schenk, C Moret, D Berger, R Abegglen, JC Schefold University Hospital Bern, Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Bern, Switzerland Critical Care 2020, 24(Suppl 1):P401 Introduction: Dysphagia is common and independently predicts death in ICU patients. Risk factors for dysphagia are largely unknown with sparse data available only from mostly small cohorts without systematic dysphagia screening. We investigated risk factors for dysphagia in ICU patients post invasive mechanical ventilation. Methods: Post-hoc analysis of data from a large monocentric prospective observational study (\"Dysphagia in mechanically ventilated ICU patients, DYnAMICS\" [1]) using comprehensive statistical models to identify potential risk factors for dysphagia in 933 primary ICU admissions. In DYnAMICS, patients were systematically screened for dysphagia at the bedside within 3 hours from extubation using the two-step Bernese ICU Dysphagia Algorithm. Screening-positivity was followed within 24 hours by a confirmatory exam, identifying 116 ICU patients suffering from dysphagia. Results: After adjustment for typical confounders, baseline neurological disease (OR 4.45, 95%-CI: 2.74-7.24, p<0.01), emergency admission (OR 2.04, 95%-CI: 1.15-3.59, p<0.01), days on mechanical ventilation (OR 1.19, 95%-CI: 1.06-1.34, p<0.01), days on renal replacement therapy (OR 1.1, 95%-CI: 1-1.23, p=0.03), and disease severity (APACHE II score within first 24 hours; OR 1.03, 95%-CI: 0.99-1.07, p<0.01) remained independent risk factors for dysphagia post mechanical ventilation (Figure 1). Increased body mass index reduced the risk for dysphagia (6% per step increase, OR 0.94, 95%-CI: 0.9-0.99, p=0.03). Conclusions: In ICU patients, baseline neurological disease, emergency admission and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation appeared as prominent independent risk factors for dysphagia.

Cardiovascular medications may be discontinued on ICU admission. Whether they are appropriately reinitiated after the acute illness and on hospital discharge is unclear. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review study in a tertiary ICU from April 2016 to April 2017. Our medications of interest were ARBs and ACEIs. We collected baseline characteristics, APACHE II and SOFA scores on admission and whether patients were on chronic cardiovascular medications before hospitalization. Our outcome of interest was the re-initiation of the same class of cardiovascular medication at hospital discharge. Results: Data from the first 199 ICU survivors were analyzed. Median age was 68 (interquatile range (IQR)=18) years and 42.2% were female. The APACHE II and SOFA scores on admission were 14 (IQR=11) and 4 (IQR=4) respectively. 99 (49.8%) of patients were mechanically ventilated and 77 (38.7%) needed vasopressor support during their ICU stay. There was a total of 80 patients on either ACEIs or ARBs before hospitalization. Among them, 40 patients (50%) was re-prescribed an ACEIs or ARBs at discharge and none of them stayed on renal replacement therapy at discharge. Univariate logistic regression showed that SOFA score (odds ratio (OR)=1.20 [1.004-1.425], p= 0.045) and the need of vasopressor support (OR=3.66 [1.419-9.467], p=0.0073) were associated with ACEIs and ARBS not being reinitiated(Table 1).Conclusions:A significant proportion of ACEs and ARBs are not re-initiated at discharge. Future studies need to address this discrepancy.P403Predicting medication related problems in a post-ICU population using demographic and in-ICU clinical dataC Purdie 1 , P MacTavish 2 , T Quasim 1 , P Henderson 1 , J McPeake 2 , M Shaw 3 University of Glasgow, School of Medicine, Glasgow, United Kingdom; Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Intensive Care Unit, Glasgow, United Kingdom; Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Clinical Physics Department, Glasgow, United Kingdom Critical Care 2020, 24(Suppl 1):P403Introduction: During critical illness, chronic therapies are often withheld and subsequently not restarted, and ICU-specific treatments can be inappropriately continued once discharged. Critically ill patients also experience many transitions of care, which may also cause issues with on-going medicine management. Additionally, patients are often prescribed new medications, which they may not understand how to take effectively, or which may cause adverse events.

Based on PC 1 to 3 (explaining 70.25% of the variance), three groups of swappable variables were identified: (1) days on RRT, days in hospital and cumulative midazolam dose, (2) days in ICU, days on gastric tube, days on invasive mechanical ventilation and cumulative propofol dose and (3) APACHE II score. The first member of each group was selected as representative variable 1.03 per day, 95% CI: 1.01-1.05, p=0.02), number of medications at ICU discharge (OR 1.15 per medication, 95% CI: 1.04-1.28, p=0.01), and WHO Step 2 analgesia at the InS:PIRE clinic (OR 5.20 vs WHO level 0, 95% CI: 2.07-13.20, p=0.001). Conclusions: Length of days in hospital, the number of medications at ICU discharge, and WHO step 2 analgesia prescription are all associated with increased odds of developing an MRP.

Critically ill patients are also experience higher numbers of transitions of care, which may also cause issues with on-going medicine management. Additionally, patients are often prescribed new medications which they may not understand how to take effectively, or which may cause adverse events. We aimed to categorise the nature of the Medication Related Problems (MRPs) found in this population.

However data on mobilization practices on ICU patients are inadequate. The aim of this study was to document physiotherapy intervention practices on ICU Cardiac Surgery patients at the Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center.Methods:For this study, of the 221 patients that were subjected to cardiothoracic surgery, 159 were assessed for the effects of early mobilization on the duration of ICU hospitalization. Physiotherapy intervention was recorded on the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th day of ICU admission.Results:Physiotherapy practice consisted of respiratory physiotherapy and mobilization interventions such as active and passive limb mobilization, sitting in bed and transferring from bed to chair. The proportion of patients mobilized, was 18% (\u039d=29/159) within 24 hours from ICU admission, 53% (\u039d=46/87) in day 3, 54% (\u039d=22/41) in day 5 and 62% (N= 15/24) in day 7. The duration of stay in the ICU was reduced in patients who were mobilized compared to bedridden, (28 \u00b1 37 vs 66 \u00b1 92 hours, p = 0.001).Conclusions:Early mobilization rates of patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery appear reduced in the ICU Cardiac Surgery compared to international literature. Physiotherapy interventions practices are associated with decreased ICU length of stay.Intensive Care Unit, Fracastoro Hospital, Emergency Department, San Bonifacio, Verona, Italy; 2 Intensive Care Unit, Fracastoro Hospital, San Bonifacio, Verona, Italy Critical Care 2020, 24(Suppl 1):P406Introduction:The purpose of our retrospective study is to compare 2 groups (patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -ALS-or neurological disease and patients non neurological disease) of tracheoventilated patients in a considered period to highlight differences in ICUFig. 1 (abstract P404).

Methods: 24 tracheostomized adult patients, cuffed cannulae, 24 hours of home ventilation, cannula change every 60 days at home, in the period 2015-2019, classified in 2 groups (group A: patients with ALS or neurological diseases -62.5% -and group B: patients without neurological diseases ex. pulmonary diseases -37.5%). We consider VAP with ICU recovery and mortality due to VAP or other causes in the 2 groups. Clinical, radiological and microbiological criteria have been used for diagnosis of VAP. The results is expressed as percentage and as average and standard deviation. Results: VAP with ICU recovery involved 50% (12/24) of the patients [average 1.83 and standard deviation 0.79] (66% group A vs 22% group B). The deaths for VAP 4/12 (33% -26% group A vs 0% group B). Mortality for other causes 5/24 (20.5% -13% group A vs 33% group B). Conclusions: Comparing the 2 groups, VAP with ICU recovery and mortality for VAP in ICU are more frequent in group of neurological patients; mortality for other causes is higher in the group of non neurological patients.P407 Prognostic factors of heterotopic ossification in critically ill patients AG Vassiliou 1 , I Dimopoulou 2 , E Jahaj 2 , Z Mastora 2 , SE Orfanos 2 , A Kotanidou 2 National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, 1st Department of Critical Care Medicine & Pulmonary Services, GP Livanos and M Simou Laboratories, Athens, Greece; 2 National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, 1st Department of Critical Care Medicine & Pulmonary Services, Athens, Greece Critical Care 2020, 24(Suppl 1):P407 Introduction: Heterotopic ossification (HO) is the formation of bone in soft tissues and constitutes a potential complication of patients hospitalized in the ICU. The exact pathogenetic mechanisms of HO are unknown.Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) induce bone formation, while signaling through the receptor activator of NF-\u03baB (RANK) and its ligand (RANKL) regulates osteoclast formation, activation and survival in normal bone modeling and remodeling. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) protects bone from excessive bone loss by preventing RANKL from binding to RANK. In the present study we investigated these molecules as possible biomarkers of HO development in ICU patients.Methods:We measured the levels of BMP-2, RANKL and OPG on ICU admission, and thereafter on days 7 and 30 in the sera of 28 critically ill patients using ELISA.Results:Nine of the 28 patients developed HO in the ICU or during the 30day follow-up period. Our results showed that on admission to the ICU, the patients who developed HO had significantly lower BMP-2 levels compared to patients who didn't [566.7 (216.7-883.3) pg/ml vs. 1300 (566.7-2817) pg/ml, respectively, p= 0.037]. RANKL levels were also decreased in the HO patients on admission [1.495 (0.285-2.465) ng/ml vs. 2.465 (1.535-6.67) ng/ml, p= 0.048], while OPG levels were similar in both groups. In the HO patients, on day 7, the levels of BMP-2 were slightly elevated, whereas on day 30 they tended to increase (p= 0.064). The patients who did not develop HO had stably elevated levels during the 30 days. A small elevation was noted in RANKL levels in the HO patients, while OPG levels remained unaltered at all time points, for both groups.Conclusions:In our cohort of critically ill patients, those who will develop heterotropic ossification have significantly decreased levels of BMP-2 and RANKL on admission, suggesting that these molecules may be used as prognostic markers to identify patients who will develop this debilitating condition. The transfer of patients from the intensive care unit (ICU) to the general wards is a challenging transition of care. This project focused on the handover of patients between ICU and the general wards in a district general hospital where there was no formal handover system in place. A baseline survey found 100% of foundation year 1 (FY1) doctors felt medications were unclear when rewriting ICU drug charts from the electronic notes. Junior doctors were often unaware patients had been transferred. This resulted in significant delays in drug charts being rewritten and missed or delayed medications. Our aim was to reduce the median time delay in drug charts being rewritten by 50% in 4 months.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF172": {"text": ". 1 (abstract P408).

There is an increasing proportion of DDH from intensive care units. Secure DDH can improve health system, resource utilization, and costs. Methods: We evaluated the characteristics and clinical outcomes of 3118 patients admitted to the CICU between 2014 and 2019. The sample was divided into two groups: DDH group=373; discharge after ward (DAW) group=2745. The analysis was performed by SPSS version 22.0 software, significance level of p <0.05. Data normality was assessed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For the comparison between continuous variables the Wilcoxon test was used and for the categorical variables the chi-square test was used. Results: Discharge directly to home increased from 49 (1.57% of all survivors) patients in 2014 to 82 (2.82%) patients in 2019. Regarding the baseline characteristics of DDH group, it was found mean age 66.23\u00b113.93, male predominance 57.10%, main hospitalization diagnoses: arrhythmias 24.10%, stent implantation 24.90%, unstable angina 13.40%.

The ultimate goal of a CCRT is to prevent cardiopulmonary arrest, stabilize patients' condition and help in optimizing the care provided by the primary team in general wards. Septic patients managed by CCRT are most likely to be initiated on one or more antimicrobials, frequently on an empiric basis. The objective of this study was to compare the quantity and quality of antimicrobial use among CCRT patients during three identified stages of their management; before CCRT activation, during and on day four after CCRT activation[1].Methods:Two hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia were utilized for this study. Tertiary care hospitals serve over 750,000. Include 1300-beds, 15 different intensive care units, and 50-inpatient wards. All patients above 15 years and managed by the CCRT during the study period were eligible to be included in the study. Case-control design was used to compare septic (cases) and non-septic (controls) CCRT patients, recruited prospectively for five months (January to May 2018).Results:A total of 315 CCRT patients were included: 157 with sepsis (cases) and 158 without sepsis (controls). Average age was 61.1 \u00b1 20.4 years and 54.6% of the patients were males. Among the 157 septic patients, 97 (61.8%) had a defined septic focus with pneumonia the main diagnosis (33.6%). 60 (38.2%) had no defined septic focus. The most frequent triggers for CCRT activation were changes in respiratory rates (29.5%). An antimicrobial was used during CCRT activation in 96.2% of cases and 65.2% of controls (p < 0.001). Meropenem (51.4%), vancomycin (41.3%), and piperacillin/tazobactam (28.6%) were the most frequently used antimicrobials. More cases were likely to be admitted to ICU than controls (43.9% versus 28.5%, p=0.004). There were no differences in the development of antimicrobial adverse events (31.8% versus 27.2%, p = 0.270) or in mortality (4.5% versus 1.3%, p = 0.104) between cases and controls.Conclusions:The fact of no de-escalation of antimicrobials were noticed in majority of CCRT patients; this led to the importance of establishing an antimicrobial stewardship hospital wide program.:1.

Screening patients admitted into ICU for multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDR) nasal and fecal carriage, has become a rule in Romania. Our objective was to weekly monitorize colonization with MDR bacteria and the persistance of carriage of such pathogens, among patients admitted to our hospital ICU and also, to determine the incidence for nosocomial infections associated with this colonizations,considering that colonization precedes infection. Methods: Prospective observational study:from 01/10/2017 to 15/08/2018 -we have included all adult patients admitted directly to ICU (first admittance only) or with previous general wards admittance for less then 48 hours. We performed nasal and rectal swap screening for MDR bacteria: Meticilin Resistant Staphilococcus Aureus (MRSA), ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-EN), Carbapenemases Producing Gram negative Bacteria (CBP-GNB), Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE), during hospitalisation, on day 0,7 and 14. Results: We have included 75 patients, 34 women, average age 62,9 yrs with average length of hospitalisation of 15 days. Upon admission: 35 patients were colonized with MDR bacteria, in day 7-65 colonized patients and 39 in day 14.Upon admission we had 5 MRSA, 25 ESBL, 6 CBP and 18 VRE strains. 13 patients had more then one strain colonization. Conclusions: MDR bacterial colonization is frequent in patients admitted to ICU. Colonization with MDR bacteria during hospitalisation in ICU increased with the length of stay. Colonization could represent a risk factor for increased rates of infection, especially with CBP-GNB and VRE. Active surveillance program for indentification of MDR bacteria colonized patients is necessary and useful.P413 Impact of candidaemia on mortality of critically ill burned patients A Agrifoglio, L Cachafeiro, E Herrero, M S\u00e1nchez, A Garc\u00eda de Lorenzo Hospital Universitario La Paz, Intensive Care Medicine Service, Madrid, Spain Critical Care 2020, 24(Suppl 1):P413Introduction: Sepsis due to Candida is an uncommon but a significant cause of death in burns patients. Candida spp. represents the main cause of fungal colonization in burned patients. The incidence of invasive candidiasis occurs between 2 and 21% of burned patients, with an attributable mortality between 30-90% and the incidence of candidaemia is around 3-5%. The aim was analyze the incidence, mortality and risk factors associated with the development of candidaemia in a population of burned patients.Methods:A retrospective-observational study was conducted (2012-2019) about all patients admitted to our Critical Care Burn Unit and had any microbiological isolation by any Candida species. We collected: demographic and epidemiological data, severity scores, characteristics of burns, risk factors, organic supports, days of hospital stay and mortality. Results: 588 burned patients were admitted. 8 candidaemia were diagnosed: 5 C. albicans, 1 C. parapsilosis, 1 C. tropicalis, 1 C. glabrata. 5 patients were colonized by yeasts in their burns. The candidaemia were treated empirically with echinocandins. 84% of the patients the mechanism of the burn was the flame. The medians were: age: 47 years; 6 men; TBSA: 42%; depth, 32%; ABSI: 8, APACHE-II: 18. The average hospital stay in the ICU was 45 \u00b1 9 days. All patients on mechanical ventilation at the time of the diagnosis of candidaemia, and all of them also required norepinephrine for septic shock. All had a central venous catheter, urinary catheter, parenteral nutrition and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. 3 patients (38%) died, both with candidaemia due to C. albicans.Conclusions:Although the incidence of candidaemia in our population is very low, almost half of the patients who develop it die during admission for refractary septic shock. TBSA > 30%, multiple colonization by Candida, parenteral nutrition, broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, central venous catheter and urinary catheterization continue to be the main risk factors for opportunistic fungal infections.P416Ventilator-associated pneumonia due to multidrug-resistant Klebsiella spp.: antibacterial resistance and predictors of ICU mortality D Adukauskiene, A Dambrauskiene, A Ciginskiene Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Medical Academy, Kaunas, Lithuania Critical Care 2020, 24(Suppl 1):P416Introduction:The aim of the study was to evaluate the antibacterial resistance of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella spp. isolates as pathogens of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and to determinate predictors of ICU mortality.Methods:Retrospective data analysis of patients (pt) treated in ICU with MDR Klebsiella spp. strains as pathogens of VAP during three years period was carried out. Results: Data of 71 pt were evaluated. All tested strains of MDR Klebsiella spp. were resistant to ampicillin, piperacillin, cefuroxime. Resistance to amoxicillin/cla-Fig. 1 (abstract P414). Sensitivity analysis of the cost savings associated with POCT vs. formal lab testing. This table highlights what factors have the largest impact on cost between these 2 methods (31.1%).The ICU mortality was 26/71 (36.6%). Statistical significant differences of survivors vs non-survivors were found in median of neutrophilosis on diagnosis day 80.9% (IQR 72.6 -83.6) vs 87.5% (IQR 81.4 -9.7), p < 0.001,and between proportions of septic shock on diagnosis day10 (22.2 %) vs 14 (53.8%), p = 0.007, renal failure 20 (44.4%) vs 21 (80.8%), p = 0.003, renal re-2%), p = 0.005 disease. Odds ratio (OR) for ICU mortality for RRT was OR 4.64 (95% CI 1.16-18.62), for septic shock OR 4.01 (95% CI 1.17 -13.67), and for neutrophilosis OR 1.16 (95% CI 1.05 -1.28). Conclusions: VAP due to MDR Klebsiella spp. was associated with the high rate of antibacterial resistance to aminopenicillins, 3rd generation of cephalosporins, fluoroquinalons, aminoglycosides, but carbapenems. The ICU mortality was 36.6%. The RRT, septic shock and neutrophilosis on diagnosis were predictorsfor ICU mortality in patients with VAP due to MDR Klebsiella spp.Vitebsk State Medical University, Vitebsk, Belarus; 2 Minsk Scientific and Practical Center of Surgery, Transplantation and Hematology, Minsk, Belarus Critical Care 2020, 24(Suppl 1):P417 Introduction:It has been known about possibility of microorganisms to create specific multi-layered structures called biofilms. Non-cellular deoxyribonucleic acid actively participates in regulation of properties of biofilms. Thus, in biofilms transfer of genetic information including genes responsible for sensitivity to antibacterial drugs occurs much more often than in single-living bacterial cells. However, despite the involvement of extracellular deoxyribonucleic acid in adhesive processes and intercellular interactions, its role has not been fully understood. Methods: 238 isolates isolated from sputum and pharynx of 175 patients during 2016-2019 were studied. Patients were divided into two groups: the 1st group of 139 people (79,4%) had severe respiratory infections, the 2nd of 36 people (20,6%) -respiratory infections of moderate severity.Results:A method was developed for determining percentage of deoxyribonucleic acid in microbial community using 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride. Average age of the 1st group was higher than the second (p<0.05). Pseudomonas aeruginosa had the largest mass of biofilm and percentage of deoxyribonucleic acid in group 1, 48,25 [30.5-70.1] mcg/ml and 5.21[2.17-7.67] %, p = 0.04. A strong relationship was found between percentage of deoxyribonucleic acid in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and severity of disease, r = 0.73, p<0.05. The incidence of adverse outcomes in isolating antibiotic resistant isolates was higher than in antibiotic sensitive (p<0.05). Analysis of results made it possible to propose fatal outcome when mass of microbial biofilm is > 47.5 mcg/well and percentage of deoxyribonucleic acid is >2.33% (p<0.01).Conclusions:Pathogens with high biofilm weight and percent of deoxyribonucleic acid cause disease progression and death. Implementation of rapid molecular blood culture diagnostics in the clinical management of sepsis is essential in providing fast pathogen identification and resistance gene testing.The Genmark ePlex blood culture panels offer a broad antimicrobial spectrum with minimal hands-on time and around 1.5h time to result. By implementing ePlex analysis when the department of clinical microbiology is closed, the test can be optimally used in terms of clinical impact and costs.Methods:Prospective ePlex testing on consecutive non-duplicate positive blood cultures, primarily from the emergency room, incubated at a satellite incubator at the 24h/7day open department of Clinical Chemistry. The routine bio-medical analysts performed the analyses. The result, except findings of CoNS, was made available to the attending physician. Cultures were transferred to the Department of Clinical Microbiology for conventional diagnostics the next day. The ePlex results were compared to conventional diagnostics for pathogen identification and time to result.

Continued surveillance and finding a suitable drug is of central priority. This study examines Klebsiella pneumoniae and other nosocomial infections in the intensive care unit of Aseer Central Hospital, determines their antibiogram, and evaluates predictors of mortality.Methods:The present investigation was a retrospective cross-sectional study based on data collected from patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Aseer Central Hospital, Saudi Arabia (2018-2019). Demographic, microbiologic, antimicrobial treatment and outcomes were collected from 150 patients with bacteremia, pneumonia, and other infections.A total of 150 patients were included (2018, n= 68; 2019, n= 82). Identification of isolates and in vitro susceptibilities were done by Vitek 2 system. Collected data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and regression models.Results:One hundred and fifty patients were included in our study (51 females and 99 males). The clinical specimens were mainly derived from respiratory (60.0%), followed by blood (16.7%), urine (11.3%), wound and skin swab (4.7%), CSF (2.7%), pus, discharge and swab (2.7%), and abdominal fluid and aspirate ((2.7%). Mortality was 36.0% (54/150*100); Klebsiella pneumoniae was responsible for 27 case (27/ 54*100 = 50%). Acinetobacterspp. (35.2%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.3%) infections while the remaining organisms accounted for 5.6%. The overall in vitroresistance was 49.5% and shown an increase in 2019 (p <0.01)(fig 1).Conclusions:Half of the ICU mortalities were caused by K. pneumoniae . The frequency of K. pneumoniae and its resistance to antimicrobials was high and obviously rising as for other gram-negative bacteria. Our results suggest that attention should be paid to strengthen measures for better infection control measures.P420 Patterns of presentation and predictors of ICU mortality among HIV infected patients AE Laher 1 , RW Maphula 1 , GA Richards 2 University of the Witwatersrand, Emergency Medicine, Parktown, Johannesburg, South Africa; 2 University of the Witwatersrand, Critical Care, Parktown, Johannesburg, South Africa Critical Care 2020, 24(Suppl 1):P420Introduction: Data on the outcomes of HIV infected intensive care unit (ICU) patients in developing countries is limited. There are more people living with HIV in South Africa than any other country in the world. This study aimed to describe the patterns of presentation as well as determine factors that influences mortality in HIV infected patients at an ICU facility in Johannesburg.Methods:Consecutive medical records of 204 HIV infected individuals admitted to the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital adult ICU during 2017 were reviewed. Data was described and subjected to univariate and multivariate analysis.Results:Of the 903 total admissions during the period analysed, 204 (22.6%) were HIV infected. Ninety-five (46.6%) patients wereFig. 1 (abstract P419). Clustered bar count of dominant microorganisms causing ICU infections according to patient's outcomes (2018-2019) Fig. 1 (abstract P418). Result of consecutive positive blood cultures analyzed with ePlexadmitted for sepsis related illnesses, 69 (33.8%) for post-operative care and 40 (19.6%) for non-sepsis related illnesses. HIV infected patients had a median length of ICU stay of 5 (2-9) days and ICU mortality of 33.3% (n=68). On multivariate analysis of significant parameters identified from the univariate analysis, requirement for inotropes/vasopressors (p=0.009), mechanical ventilation (p= 0.037) and a non-sepsis related diagnosis (p=0.030) were associated with an increase in ICU mortality. The Risk Adjusted Mortality Ratio (RAMRobserved ICU mortality rate/ APAHCE II predicted ICU mortality rate) was 0.51, which indicates that the APACHE II score overestimated ICU mortality in HIV infected patients by approximately two-fold.Conclusions:Inotrope/vasopressor administration, mechanical ventilation and a non-sepsis related diagnosis is significantly associated with mortality in HIV infected patients in the ICU. The APACHE II score overestimates mortality in HIV infected ICU patients.P421Impact of beta-lactamase detection reagent on rapid diagnosis of ESBL-producing pathogens using urine samples in patients with gram-negative bacteriuria J Yoshimura 1 , Y Ooi 2 , Y Umemura 1 , K Yamakawa 1 , S Fujimi 1 Osaka General Medical Center, Division of Trauma and Surgical Critical Care, Osaka, Japan; 2 Osaka General Medical Center, Department of Clinical Laboratory, Osaka, Japan Critical Care 2020, 24(Suppl 1):P421", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF176": {"text": "The reference standard was the result of urine culture and the antibiotic susceptibility test according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.Results:We included 331 urine samples during the study period. One hundred ninety eight patients diagnosed UTI among them. ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae was isolated from 73 samples. Cicabeta reagent showed sensitivity of 79.5% and specificity of 99.2% in patients with Gram-negative bacteriuria. Sensitivity and specificity were improved 89.7% and 100%, respectively when it was performed in patients with UTI.Conclusions:Cica-beta reagent would be an efficient test for the detection of ESBL producing pathogens in urine. Because it could provide immediate information about ESBL, it might be a point-of-care test to predict causative pathogens and guide appropriate antibiotics in patients with UTI.P422Effect of bundle approach on preventing hospital-acquisition of drug-resistant pathogens in intensive care units A Ota 1 , M Kawanami 1 , J Yoshimura 2 , Y Umemura 2 , K Yamakawa 2 , S Fujimi 2 Osaka General Medical Center, Nursing Department, Osaka, Japan;Osaka General Medical Center, Division of Trauma and Surgical Critical Care, Osaka, Japan Critical Care 2020, 24(Suppl 1):P422Introduction:The increasing emergence and spread of drug-resistant pathogens all over the world has become catastrophic world health problems. In fact, we experienced an uncontrollable outbreak of multidrugresistant pathogens and ICU closure for 3 weeks in January 2013. Based on the experience, we built an infection control bundle including contact precautions for every patient in the ICU, carrying personal alcohol-based hand rubs, cohorting patients who acquired drug-resistant pathogens, active surveillance cultures once a week, and enhanced environmental disinfection in January 2013. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the systemic infection control bundle approach against acquisition of drug-resistant pathogens.Methods:This was a retrospective historical control study conducted from April 2008 to March 2019 in 18-bed ICU of a tertiary care hospital in Japan. Every patient admitted to the ICU during the study period was eligible. Patients were divided into 2 groups: Conventional (from April 2008 to December 2012) or Intervention (from January 2013 to March 2019).The primary outcome was the number of hospitalacquired MRSA. We defined hospital-acquisition as the isolation of MRSA after 48 hours of hospitalisation.Results:A total of 13,047 patients were included during the study period. There were 5,128 patients in the control group (39.3%) from 2008 to 2012 and 7,919 patients in the intervention group (61.7%) from 2013 to 2019. The hospital-acquisition of MRSA was observed 284 patients (5.5%) in the control group and 150 patients (1.9%) in the intervention group.

Introduction: Especially extracorporeal cardio pulmonary bypass (CPB) is known to induce severe inflammation. Postoperative inflammation is associated with a sepsis like syndrome including endothelial barrier disruption, volume depletion and hypotension. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a signaling lipid regulating permeability and vascular tone. In septic humans decreased serum-S1P levels could be identified as marker for sepsis severity. We addressed three main issues: (1) Are serum-S1P levels affected by cardiac surgery? (2) Are potential alterations of serum-S1P levels related to changes of acute-phase proteins, S1P sources or carrier? (3) Is the invasiveness of the surgery a factor that may influence serum-S1P levels? Methods: 46 elective major cardiac surgery patients were prospectively enrolled in this study. Serum samples were drawn pre-, post-procedure and on day 1 and day 4 after surgery. We analyzed S1Pand its potential sources: Red blood cells (RBC) and platelets.

AQP4 genetic variants represent biomarkers associating with outcome after traumatic brain injury and intracerebral hemorrhage [3] [4] . Linking AQP4 genetic polymorphism to the course of sepsis has not been studied. Methods: Study cohort included 124 ICU patients diagnosed according to SEPSIS-3 consensus.
