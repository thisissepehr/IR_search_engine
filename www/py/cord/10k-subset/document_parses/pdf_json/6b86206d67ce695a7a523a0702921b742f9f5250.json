            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication is dependent on the formation of specialized membrane structures; however, the host factor requirements for the formation of these HCV complexes remain unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1) halts the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid, and negatively modulates HCV replication. Unsaturated fatty acids play key roles in membrane curvature and fluidity. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that SCD-1 inhibition disrupts the integrity of membranous HCV replication complexes and renders HCV RNA susceptible to nuclease-mediated degradation. Our work establishes a novel function for unsaturated fatty acids in HCV replication. M any viruses have evolved different mechanisms by which to alter the membrane components of the hostcell endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in order to form membranous structures that support viral replication 1-5 . Membrane alterations are observed with multiple classes of viruses exemplified by the Flaviviridae (e.g. hepatitis C virus (HCV), Coronaviridae (SARS), and Picornaviridae (polio virus)) 3 . Virusmodified ER includes interconnected membranous structures that contain multiple single or double membrane invaginated piths, each housing and protecting viral replication complexes from host defences 3,6,7 . In the case of HCV, which chronically infects ,2.35% of the world's population 8 , virus-induced piths/webs enable HCV RNA to hide from endogenous host defenses 3 . Further, hepatic lipid droplets (LDs) bound to the HCV core protein also blocks access to host defences 9 . Finally, the high radii of curvature of HCV-induced modified ER membranes provides a platform for replication and concentrates viral components for protection and efficiency 3,10,11 . Small molecules that inhibit host and viral proteins governing formation of these virus-modified membranes can serve as chemical probes to study the roles of these protected environments and also represent novel antiviral strategies.",

Specifically, the nature of fatty acids have been shown to affect the packing of phospholipid fatty-acyl chains, inducing either positive or negative curvature, depending on the structure and size of the lipid and fatty acid head group 12,13 . For example, oleic acid (OA) augments membrane fluidity in physiologically relevant phospholipid membrane bilayers and also enables negative curvature 14 . As such, we examined the effects of oleic acid and its involvement in HCV-induced negatively curved membranes. A key enzyme in the biosynthesis of oleic acid is stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) 15 . In humans, SCD-1 is highly expressed in the liver, while the other isoform, SCD-5 is primarily expressed in the brain and pancreas 15,16 .

The monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) products of SCD-1 enzymatic activity are shuttled as substrates for the synthesis of membrane phospholipid fatty-acyl chains, triglyceride biogenesis, and cholesterol esterification ( Fig. 1) 12, 17, 18 . A variety of small molecule inhibitors have been used to show that inhibiting lipogenesis negatively affects HCV replication 19 . To determine whether HCV replication is dependent on SCD-1 activity, we treated human hepatoma cells (Huh7) stably expressing an HCV replicon with the SCD-1 inhibitor A 20 (Fig. 2) . Dose dependent reduction of viral RNA replication was observed following 96 hr treatments with inhibitor A (EC 50 structural classes [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] , were also tested against genotype 1a and 1b HCV replicons, with EC 50 values for inhibition of viral replication measured as low as 0.74 nM (Supplementary Table S1 ). Inhibition by the SCD-1 inhibitors compared well with the direct-acting antiviral (DAA) inhibitor B 25 that inhibits HCV NS3 protease with an EC 50 value of 8.3 nM (Fig. 2e) . In some cases SCD-1 inhibitors (Supplementary Table S1 ) blocked HCV replication to a low level but did not abolish all replication as seen in DAA treatments, indicating a different mechanism of action for the SCD-1 inhibitors as demonstrated by a lack of inhibitory effect on in vitro NS3 protease and NS5B polymerase activity (Supplementary Table S2 ). Similar levels of inhibition of HCV replication and virus production were observed in a full-length genotype 2a (JFH-1 T ) 26 model (Fig. 3) . These results suggest that SCD-1 activity is highly advantageous full-length virus (JFH-1 T ) used in this study. All replicons encode for a neomycin (neo) resistance gene used as a selectable marker, and expression of HCV polyprotein is driven by encephalomyocarditis (EMCV) internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). All replicons are flanked by the HCV 59 untranslated region (UTR) and 39UTR. Both SGRs encode for NS3-NS5B. HCV SGR-Luc/Ubi (genotypes 1A and 1B) also encodes a luciferase reporter tag (luc) followed by a ubiquitin (ubi) gene. (B) Chemical structure of SCD-1 thiazole analogue inhibitor A.

The error bars represent standard error of the mean (n $ 3). (D) Chemical structure of NS3 protease inhibitor B.

Because MUFAs such as OA are highly incorporated into triglycerides, it is conceivable that there would be a reduction in storage of these neutral lipids in LDs upon SCD-1 inhibition 15 . Thus, we treated Huh7 cells, with and without a HCV subgenomic replicon, with the SCD-1 inhibitor A at concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 1 mM. We then performed cellular imaging using coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, a label-free method for LD detection 28, 29 and voxel analysis, which quantifies lipid volumes from the threshold CARS signal specific for LDs 30 . We detected a small change in LD density when Huh7 cells stably expressing an HCV subgenomic replicon were treated with concentrations well above the EC 50 value for inhibitor A (Fig. 5) . The LD size and cellular distribution did not change in cells treated with inhibitor A below 250 nM. This indicates that there is no appreciable reduction in LD size or density at concentrations of SCD-1 inhibitor that can cause inhibition of HCV replication. At concentrations above 250 nM, we observed a significant reduction in cellular lipid content.",

Specifically, we postulated that the pharmacological blockade of SCD-1 would alter membrane composition, fluidity and/or the curvature required for functional HCV replication complexes. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the cellular localization of double-stranded (ds) HCV RNA, a species normally localized to intact replication complexes, upon treatment with varying concentrations of SCD inhibitor A (Fig. 6 ). Using an antibody specific for dsRNA 30 and Huh7 cells stably transfected with HCV replicons, confocal microscopy revealed that in untreated cells, ds-HCV RNA exhibits a punctate staining pattern within the cytoplasmic space of the cell (Fig. 6a ). Under mock treatment, a similar punctate pattern was also observed, as expected (Fig. 6b) . However, upon addition of 100 nM of SCD-1 inhibitor A, we detected a diffuse dispersion pattern of ds-HCV RNA intermediates that are consistent with a significant change in localization (Fig. 6c) . We reasoned that the exclusion of ds-HCV RNA from HCV-modified membranes caused the down-regulation of HCV replication since the RNA is no longer protected from endogenous nucleases and is likely no longer associated with host and viral proteins that mediate replication, as previously reported 30 . This is consistent with SCD inhibitor A affecting HCV modified membranes.",

            "text": "To examine this possibility, we performed an in situ RNAse protection assay (RPA) based on a previously published methodology 9,31 . Miyanari et al. showed previously that HCV RNA in replication complexes remains intact in the presence of a membrane permeabilizing detergent (digitonin) and exogenous nucleases 9,31 . However, upon disruption of the ER membrane integrity using an additional non-ionic detergent (NP-40), HCV RNA became susceptible to nuclease-mediated degradation. We sought to investigate whether inhibitor A exerts a similar effect on the structural integrity of HCV altered membranes as NP-40, by inhibiting SCD-1 and lowering oleate levels. This is consistent also with the ability of oleic acid to rescue the effect (Supplementary Table S1 ). We performed comparative PCR for HCV RNA levels followed by densitometry to quantify the magnitudes of HCV RNA degradation after probing for nuclease accessibility to HCV RNA (Fig. 7 , and Supplementary  Fig. S4 ). The RPA was performed during mock ( Fig. 7a ,b lanes 1-6) and SCD-1 inhibitor A (Fig. 7a ,b lanes 7-11) treatments to examine the influence of SCD-1 on the nuclease and detergent resistant properties of viral RNA at replication complexes. Cells were treated at a concentration yielding ,50% reduction of HCV RNA by PCR (n 5 5) (Fig. 7b ,c and Supplementary Fig. S4 ). This was performed to ensure that we would be able to observe additional reduction of HCV RNA levels by endogenous and exogenously added nucleases. 28S and 18S ribosomal RNAs are susceptible to degradation by cytoplasmic nucleases, and their degradation is a positive control for both cell membrane permeabilization and nuclease activity ( Fig. 7a,b) . As expected, in treatments containing both nuclease and digitonin, 28S and 18S rRNA are readily degraded (Fig. 7a ,b, lanes 3 and 9), whereas HCV RNA is not. In the absence of digitonin, the exogenous nuclease fails to enter the cytoplasm, and as expected, no degradation is observed (Fig. 7a ,b, lane 6). Additionally, when NP-40 was added in the absence of nuclease and digitonin, ribosomal RNAs remained intact ( Fig. 7a ,b, lanes 4 and 10). SCD-1 inhibition alone has no effect on the integrity of ribosomal RNA bands ( Fig. 7a,b, lane 7) . Interestingly, we observed that for digitonin and nuclease treated cells, inhibitor A ( Fig. 7a ,b, lane 9) reduced HCV RNA levels similar to the effects of NP-40 ( Fig. 7a ,b, lane 5). This suggests that the SCD-1 inhibitor disrupts the structural integrity of HCV modified membranes to a similar extent to that of NP-40, which allows exogenous nucleases access to HCV RNA. For inhibitor A as well as digitonin plus nucleases treated cells, the HCV RNA levels showed above 50% reduction in HCV RNA levels (See Fig. 7a ,b, lane 8 vs 9). This further supports the notion that SCD-1 inhibitor treated HCV replicon containing cells are more susceptible to nucleases where SCD-1 inhibitor-induced membrane perturbation allows nuclease access into the replication complexes to degrade HCV RNA to a greater extent than mock treated cells. After repeating the exogenous nuclease protection assay (n 5 5), we observed that HCV RNA levels in digitonin, nuclease, and inhibitor A treated HCV replicon containing cells showed no statistically significant difference in comparison to digitonin, nuclease, and NP-40 treatment, which further confirms that the effects of inhibitor A mimic NP-40 treatment in disrupting the protective environment of the membranous webs (Fig. 7c) . As expected, no significant degradation of HCV RNA was observed in cells treated with digitonin only (Fig. 7a,b, lane 1) , NP-40 only (Fig. 7a,b, lane 4) , and nuclease only (Fig. 7a ,b, lane 6), in both mock and SCD-1 inhibitor A (Fig. 7a ,b, lanes 8 and 10) treated groups. Ultimately, the RPA demonstrates that reduced oleate from SCD-1 inhibitor treatment caused a change in the nuclease resistant HCV replication complexes, which then become accessible to endogenous or exogenously added nucleases.",

We found that at a dose of 100 nM there was a significant decrease in the numbers of membranous webs, consistent with HCV knockdown, and a dramatic change in the structure of the membranous webs (Fig. 8) . Specifically, double membrane vesicles, a proposed site of HCV replication, displayed a distorted morphology (Fig. 8c,f) and increased prevalence of small vesicles was observed. Collectively, these observations are consistent with SCD inhibition altering and ultimately blocking the formation HCV-induced specialized membranes. EM imaging of Huh7 SGR cells at a dose of 500 nM showed almost no membranous webs and drastically fewer LDs compared with control cells ( Supplementary  Fig. S5 ), consistent with our observations using CARS microscopy (Fig. 5) . Table S1 ) via luciferase assays. In parallel, the cell-based enzymatic activity of SCD-1 was measured, as described in Materials and Methods. (A-B) For each inhibitor, the EC 50 of HCV inhibition is plotted against the EC 50 of SCD-1 inhibition. (C) HepG2 cells were similarly treated with each SCD-1 inhibitor, and EC 50 of SCD-1 inhibition in HepG2 cells is plotted against the respective EC 50 of SCD-1 inhibition in Huh7 SGR-Luc/Ubi cells. Discussion HCV, like other viruses, partitions its genome into membranous compartments in order to increase viral replication kinetics and shield the viral genome 33, 34 . However, our current understanding of the biogenesis of HCV-associated membranous webs is limited. While it is well established that HCV hijacks host lipid homeostasis to facilitate its pathogenesis 19, 35, 36 , there is an emerging body of evidence that these lipid pathways play an important role in HCV's formation of membranous replication complexes. This includes the modulation of phosphoinositide signaling and cholesterol synthesis to induce the formation of the HCV replication compartments 2,37 . Previous work analyzing the role of fatty acid biosynthesis in HCV pathogenesis has had a central focus on its relevance in HCVinduced hepatic lipid accumulation. Our study demonstrates an important role for unsaturated fatty acids in the formation of HCV-induced membranous compartments.",

Cells were harvested with trypsinization and subsequently quenched with complete media and then passed through a 70 mm cell strainer. Cells were centrifuged at 800 rpm for 5 minutes and then resuspended in fresh media to 200,000 cells/ml. Cells were transferred at 80 ml per well to 96-well plates (Costar 3595) and incubated at 37uC and 5% CO 2 . After overnight incubation, 10 ml of compound or DMSO control in DMEM media/5% DMSO was transferred to each well and the plates were incubated at 37uC and 5% CO 2 . Fifteen minutes later, 10 ml of a sonicated media containing 14 C-stearic acid (final concentration 0.4 mCi/ml) was added to each well and plates were incubated for 4 hours at 37uC and 5% CO 2 . Cells monolayers were washed with PBS and subsequently lysed by incubation at 65uC for 1 h with 2N NaOH. Cell lysates were acidified with phosphoric acid, and lipids were extracted with acetonitrile.

A representative integrity gel is shown (n 5 5) illustrating 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA integrity after digitonin, micrococcal nuclease, and NP-40 treatments. Degradation of 18S and 28S rRNA bands is observed only upon permeabilizing the plasma membrane with digitonin, and treatment with exogenous micrococcal nuclease (Lanes 3, 5, 9, 11) . Comparative RT-PCR was performed on HCV RNA to illustrate the relative HCV RNA abundance (cropped image below the RNA integrity gel) in the presence and absence of inhibitor A after treatments with digitonin, micrococcal nuclease, and NP-40. (B) Average HCV RNA abundance is shown from comparative PCR detecting HCV RNA. Densitometry was performed to calculate the HCV RNA abundance. All values were normalized by Lane 1 (no treatment). (C) Schematic model for SCD-1 inhibition-mediated disruption of HCV replication. Inhibition of SCD-1 alters HCV RNA's susceptibility to exogenously added nucleases by disrupting membrane HCV-associated membranes at the replication complexes. Multiple models are depicted for HCV RNA's susceptibility to endogenous nucleases (En nuc) and exogenous nucleases (Ex nuc). The size of the red arrow represents the magnitude of HCV RNA degradation by endogenous and exogenous nucleases under the different treatments including digitonin, micrococcal nucleases, and/or NP- 40. www.nature.com/scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 4 : 4549 | DOI: 10.1038/srep04549",

            "text": "Role of SCD-1 in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. Multiple enzymes, that include acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), catalyze the conversion of acetyl-CoA into long chain fatty acids (LCFAs). Palmitoyl-CoA (C16:0) can undergo sequential long-chain elongation (LCE) to form stearoyl-CoA (C18:0). Both of these fatty acids represent substrates for SCD-1, which catalyzes their desaturation at carbon-9 forming a cisdouble bond. The SCD-1 catalyzed products, palmitoleoyl-CoA (C16:1) and oleoyl-CoA (C18:1), are directly incorporated in triglycerides (TGs), cholesterol esters (CEs), and phospholipids (PL). These lipids are crucial to the formation of cytosolic lipid droplets (cLDs), luminal LDs (luLD), and lipid-rich membranes, which are platforms for HCV replication and assembly.www.nature.com/scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 4 : 4549 | DOI: 10.1038/srep04549",
