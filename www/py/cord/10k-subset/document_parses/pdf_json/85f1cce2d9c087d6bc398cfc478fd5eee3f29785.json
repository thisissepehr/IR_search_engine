Since the introduction of modern medicine by missionary doctors in the 19 th century [2] , modern epidemiological studies have been conducted in China, first by Western doctors, and then gradually superseded by their Chinese colleagues in the 1930s [3] . Since the 1950s, huge reductions in the incidence of infectious diseases like measles and schistosomiasis have been achieved through national vaccination programmes and environmental intervention programmes [1, 4] . The adoption of the Open Door Policy in 1978 marked the beginning of remarkable social and economic development unprecedented in China's modern history. However, rapid industrialization and urbanization are accompanied by many social problems, from the increasing rich-poor, urban-rural, coastal-interior disparity to heavy environmental pollution. Changes in disease profile with the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases as a result of an aging population with a successful one-child policy posed new challenges in the 21 st century [1] . The SARS epidemic in 2003 exposed how a lack of transparency and delayed dissemination of information on the part of the Chinese government made an epidemic of then unknown aetiology a global problem [3] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 125, "end": 128, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 216, "end": 219, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 380, "end": 383, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 593, "end": 596, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 597, "end": 599, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1146, "end": 1149, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1352, "end": 1355, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Epidemiologists from the non-Chinese world may wonder what resources of scientific knowledge and epidemiological information China (whose health research serves a fifth of the world's population) may offer us.

However, 13 years have gone by, and the Chinese medical and scientific literature is still largely terra incognita outside China [6] . Recent enthusiasm among Westerners in learning the Chinese language [7, 8] may rekindle their interest in this untapped resource.

This paper is intended to serve as a guide. This article will first provide a general overview to Chinese biomedical journals. Next, Chinese bibliographic databases will be described, using Wan Fang and iLib as examples. Chinese journals in epidemiology and public health will then be discussed, followed by a comprehensive examination of issues arising from switching the publication language to English, the effect on impact factors and Open Access. Lastly, the problems of language bias and quality of articles will be discussed. Three appendices are included.

I have chosen as examples, the three flagship general medical journals in greater China, namely, the Chinese Medical Journal, the Journal of the Formosan Medical Association and the Hong Kong Medical Journal. These journals provide a vivid illustration of how the decision to publish in Chinese or English is influenced by socio-political factors. Chinese Medical Journal The Chinese Medical Journal (CMJ) is the oldest English medical journal published in China. Its history can be traced to the China Medical Missionary Journal , founded in March 1887 in Shanghai by the China Medical Missionary Association ( ) to foster the exchange of experiences and information among Western medical missionaries who worked in Christian hospitals in China. It was renamed Chinese Medical Journal in 1907. In November 1918, the Chinese Medical Association ( ) was founded and started to publish a bilingual National Medical Journal of China ( ). In January 1932, the Chinese Medical Journal and the English section of the National Medical Journal of China merged and", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "(A Power-Point presentation of the History of the Formosan Medical Association and its Journal, written in Chinese, can be found at [94].) Hong Kong Medical Journal The Hong Kong Medical Journal ( ) [95] is the official journal of the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine and the Hong Kong Medical Association (HKMA) [96]. Its history can be traced to the Hong Kong Chinese Medical Association (HKCMA), the predecessor of HKMA, which was founded in the British colony in 1920 [97]. The society journal, the Bulletin of t h e H o n g K o n g C h i n e s e M e d i c a l A s s o c i a t i o n ( ) was established in 1948 (Note) [98]. As the HKCMA was renamed as HKMA in 1970, the Bulletin was renamed the Bulletin of the Hong Kong Medical Association ( ) (volume 22 continues) [99], which was later continued by the Journal of the Hong Kong Medical Association (Chinese title unchanged) in 1985 (volume 37 continues) [100]. It was superseded by the Hong Kong Medical Journal in 1995 (starting from volume 1). Articles are published in English with Chinese abstracts. As in other former British colonies like India or Singapore, the colonial legacy of creating a class of bilingual elites in Hong Kong rendered local medical publication in Chinese unnecessary and the use of English as the medical language in Hong Kong removed the language barrier in international communication of the medical profession. Note: Volume numbering of the Bulletin of the Hong Kong Chinese Medical Association started in 1948 as volume 1. It skipped publishing in 1950 and continued in 1951 as volume 3. Again in 1959, it skipped publishing and it continued in 1960 as volume 11", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Mainland Chinese journals indexed in List of Journals Indexed for

Fang database that requires subscription. (Only the Chinese abstract is available freely online in HTML format.) Thus, if one is unable to read Chinese, then his/ her search is limited to 'Titles' and 'Authors' for the articles required. A new approach must be adopted if Chinese scientific journals aspire to secure a wider readership and a higher citation rate. Since the Scientific Electronic Library Online [32] can provide free online access to English abstracts of Spanish and Portuguese journal articles, it would seem appropriate for the Wan Fang database to move towards a similar standard. Of course, English abstracts are available for journals indexed by PubMed or ISI Web of Science. Here, I introduce journals that are of particular interest to epidemiologists. The top general medical journal in mainland China is the Open Access English semimonthly Chinese Medical Journal [33], abbreviated as Chin Med J (Engl) or the CMJ, and its sister periodical in Chinese, Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi, the National Medical Journal of China. Both are MEDLINE-indexed. The CMJ has an impact factor (2006) of 0.615 (Table 1) (For the history of CMJ, please refer to Appendix 2.)There are 105 journals under the category of \"Preventive medicine and hygienics\" in the Chinese portal of the Wan Fang database and in iLib[34,35] as of 21 February 2007, which covers journals in epidemiology, preventive medicine, occupational health, toxicology, health economics and hospital management.Chinese core journals and VIP impact factor A few pieces of data can help us evaluate the quality of these journals. Although Science Citation Index Expanded and MEDLINE are primarily bibliographic databases with their main purpose being to search scientific and medical literature, they are sometimes used as pointers to indicate journals of importance. However, as language bias is suspected among these English-language indexing services, it is important to look at the data produced by the Chinese themselves. Among the 5000+ Chinese journals, some are classified as 'core journals'. According to Sun[36], these are indexed by at least one of the following three indexing systems. The first one is Comprehensive Lists of Titles of Chinese Core Journals (zhongwen hexin qikan yaomu zonglan) published by The National Library of China every four years. The latest one was published in 2004 which is available at[37] (username: gjtsg; password: tsgbkb; provided by National Library of China, see[38]). Its function is similar to that of MEDLINE: to indicate which are the top journals for a given field. It takes into account the bibliometric data from 52 databases or abstracting services, awards given by the national General Administration of Press and Publication, indexing by important indexing services (both national and foreign) as well as qualitative peer-review by specialists in the disciplines. InTables 4, 5and 6, those journals that were indexed in the Comprehensive Lists 2004 are indicated as 'Chinese core journals 2004' accordingly. The other two 'core journal' databases are the Chinese Science Citation Database[39] managed by the Chinese Academy of Science, and the Chinese Science and Technology Paper Citation Database managed by The Institute of Scientific and Technical Information of China (cf.[6,26]).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF6": {"text": "lists 21 journals in epidemiology, preventive medicine and public health.

Three versions of the journal had been published to serve three different readerships: the Japanese-occupied region by the Shanghai version, the Free China by the Chengdu version and overseas by the Washington D.C. version. Normal publication resumed in Shanghai in 1946 (volume 64).After the establishment of the People's Republic, the Chinese Medical Association moved from Shanghai to Peking (Beijing) in 1951. Since then the Chinese Medical Journal has been published in Beijing. During the Cultural Revolution, the publication of the CMJ was interrupted. It was re-named China's Medicine(1966- 68). Its publication ceased in 1969 and was reestablished as the Chinese Medical Journal in 1975 (Note).In 1979, following the Open Door Policy, a new editorial committee was formed and the CMJ resumed its academic vigour and quality as the flagship journal of the Chinese Medical Association, a window for the world of the achievements of the Chinese medical profession.For many years, the CMJ had been the only English medical journal published in China, amidst many other journals published in Chinese. From its inception as a journal founded by Western doctors for their own medical communication, it has become the bridge for the Chinese medical profession to communicate their research outputs with the outside world. Henceforth, the use of English by the CMJ, should be interpreted as a deliberate act on the part of the Chinese to communicate cross-culturally to the rest of the world. (A brief history of the Chinese Medical Journal, written in Chinese, can be found on the CMJ website[87].) Note: The year 1975, as the date of resumed publication of the CMJ, is correct according to the CMJ website[33] and the British Library Integrated Catalogue[88]. However, one can find evidence among American medical literature that the CMJ resumed publication in January 1973 as volume 1 number 1[89]. Obviously this was warmly welcomed in the West as a sign of the Chinese medical profession going back to normal after the upheavals in the early years of the Cultural Revolution[89][90][91][92][93]. According to the British Library Integrated Catalogue, the CMJ was resumed published in January 1975 as volume 1 number 1. Since January 1979, the pre-Cultural Revolution sequence of volume number was resumed and the CMJ was continued at volume 92.The Journal of the Formosan Medical Association Taiwan had been under Japanese colonial rule from 1895 to 1945. The Journal of the Formosan Medical A s s o c i a t i o n ( , also known as ) was established in 1902 by Japanese doctors in Taiwan (also called Formosa by the Portuguese) and was first published in Japanese, with an English titleEmerging Themes in Epidemiology 2008, 5:20 http://www.ete-online.com/content/5/1/20 Taiwan Igakkai Zasshi from 1931. From 1934, articles could also be written in European languages, like German. Its publication was interrupted in 1945 as the Second World War was drawing to a close. After the Second World War, when Taiwan was returned to the Republic of China, its publication resumed with Chinese language as the major medium. In 1987, it split into an English version and a Chinese version. In 1992, it switched to English completely and changed its English title from Taiwan I Hsueh Hui Tsa Chi to the current title.
