Conversantly, if the damage is too severe and ER function cannot be restored, this signaling branch triggers apoptosis. BH3-only family member Bim is essential for ER stress-induced apoptosis. However the regulatory mechanisms controlling BIM activation under ER stress conditions are not well understood. Here we show that downregulation of the miR-106b-25 cluster contributes to ER stress-induced apoptosis and the upregulation of Bim. Hypericin-mediated photo-oxidative ER damage induced Perk-dependent cell death and led to a significant decrease in the levels of miRNAs belonging to miR-106b-25 cluster in wild-type but not in Perk -/-MEFs. Further we show that expression of miR-106b-25 and Mcm-7 (host gene of miR-106b-25) is co-regulated through the transcription factors Atf4 and Nrf2. ER stress increased the activity of wild-type Bim 3 0 UTR construct but not the miR-106b-25 recognition site-mutated Bim 3 0 UTR construct. Overexpression of miR-106b-25 cluster inhibits ER stress-induced cell death in wildtype but did not confer any further protection in Bim-knockdown cells. Further we show down regulation in the levels of miR-106b-25 cluster in symptomatic SOD1 G86R transgenic mice. Our results Ir J Med Sci (2013) 182 (Suppl 4):S117-S142 S133",

Moreover, the World Health Organisation predicts by the year 2020, depression will be the leading cause of disease burden in developed countries. Despite being of benefit to a large number of patients, current antidepressants are hampered by a slow onset of action, a significant percentage of non-responders and side effects. Hindering the development of novel therapeutics is the fact that large gaps remain in our knowledge surrounding the molecular pathophysiology underlying depression and in the therapeutically relevant molecular mechanisms of antidepressants.",

As a-synuclein oligomers and protofibrils are largely recognized as the toxic intermediate species negatively affecting dopaminergic neurons, strategies aimed at improving endogenous defences against protein misfolding may represent a potential disease-modifying approach for Parkinson's disease. One such approach is to harness the properties of heat shock proteins which contribute towards maintaining a balance between protein synthesis and degradation in the cell [1] .",

OSA is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and recognised as an independent risk factor for daytime hypertension. Sympathetic activity is commonly increased in OSA patients and animal models exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). Studies of the relationship between CIH, hypertension and sympathetic activity focus on renal sympathetic activity primarily and report sympathetic hyperactivity; however the lumbar sympathetic chain (LSC) has been relatively neglected. We hypothesised that CIH would induce systemic hypertension and sectioning of the LSC would cause a greater drop in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and a greater increase in femoral vascular conductance (FVC) compared to sham controls.

Upper airway muscles such as the sternohyoid are pivotal in the control of airway calibre, therefore muscle weakness could increase the propensity for airway narrowing or collapse giving rise to further exposure to intermittent hypoxia. Increased susceptibility to CIH in female rats was a surprise finding in view of a majority of studies (animal and human) highlighting that males are at increased risk of respiratory instability during early life. Recent evidence from this laboratory has indicated that blood brain barrier permeability is increased in aged mice, and in transgenic mice which overexpress amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1, which is a commonly-used animal model of Alzheimer's disease. Infiltration of circulating cells, including T cells, has been shown to accompany the increase in blood brain barrier permeability in both aged and transgenic mice and therefore it is possible that the presence of these T cells in the brain may contribute to the reported microglial activation and astrogliosis. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of Th1 and Th2 cells on glial activation. Isolated microglia and isolated astrocytes were prepared from brains of postnatal 1-day old C57BL/6 mice. Cells were cultured in DMEM for 14 days prior to treatment. CD4 + T cells were isolated from spleens of 12 month-old C57BL/6 mice and stimulated ex vivo with anti-CD3/CD28 (1 lg/ml) in the presence of IL-12 (10 ng/ml) to produce pro-inflammatory Th1 cells or IL-4 (10 ng/ml) and anti-IFNc antibody (5 lg/ml) to induce anti-inflammatory Th2 cells. Cytokine release from these T cell lines was assessed to confirm cell phenotype. To generate amyloid b (Ab)-specific T cells, splenocytes were treated with Ab (15 lg/ml) plus polarizing cytokines to induce Th1 and Th2 cells, Ab specific CD4 + T cells were then purified after a 5 day cell culture.",

Perinatal depression has been estimated at 12-18 % [1] and, if left untreated, may have negative consequences in the offspring. However, a consequence of pharmacological treatment with drugs such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine will be the exposure of the offspring via placental transfer and breast milk. Such exposure may affect neuronal development, and thus behaviour in later life. As controlled neurodevelopmental studies in humans are not possible, animal models represent a viable alternative approach. This study aimed to investigate the effects of maternal exposure to fluoxetine throughout the prenatal and/or neonatal periods, on offspring behaviour later in life, in the rat. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 6-8/group) received vehicle (distilled water) or fluoxetine (5 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage throughout gestation and/or lactation to give four separate groups (vehicle, prenatal fluoxetine, neonatal fluoxetine and prenatal + neonatal fluoxetine). Locomotor activity in the open field (OF) and anxietylike behaviour in the elevated plus maze (EPM) were assessed in male and female offspring (n = 6/group) at 8, 12 or 16 weeks of age; spatial memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) and recognition memory in the novel object recognition (NOR) test were measured at 11 and 14 weeks of age respectively. Data were analysed using Two-Way ANOVAs followed, where appropriate by post hoc Student-Newman-Keuls tests and p \\ 0.05 was deemed statistically significant.",

In the pre-eminent model follicle culture system, mouse ovarian follicles are cultured in a gas phase oxygen concentration of 20 %. However, our laboratory has shown that this may not provide adequate follicle oxygenation, as evidenced by superior follicle growth and development under conditions of increased oxygen. Enhanced in vitro oxygen levels may, however, result in follicular oxidative stress due to excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.

In human term pregnant myometrium, water bath experiments were used to investigate the effect of the met-enkephalin analogue [D-Ala2, D-met 5] enkephalamide (DAMEA) on contractility. A confocal immunofluorescent technique and real time PCR were used to determine the expression of protein and mRNA respectively for two opioid receptor sub-types. DAMEA had a mild but significant utero-relaxant effect on human term pregnant myometrium with no effect on contraction frequency (20 %; p \\ 0.01 at 1 9 10 -4 M compared to timed matched controls). In the presence of naloxone the uterorelaxant effect observed with increasing concentrations of DAMEA was abolished (p \\ 0.01 at 1 9 10 -5 and 1 9 10 -4 M). Mu and delta opioid receptor protein sub-types were identified and mRNA for these proteins was demonstrated.",

Uterine atony is consistently the most common cause of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) [1] . Guidelines emphasise the use of oxytocics in a sequential manner for the management of uterine atony associated with PPH including ergometrine. However little is known about the mechanism of action of ergometrine as an oxytocic [2] . Ergometrine may act through 5-HT receptors as research in rodents points to the 5-HT 2A receptor subtype being coupled to pathways that stimulate contraction [3] . We investigated the effect of ergometrine in the presence and absence of ketanserin (a selective 5-HT 2A receptor antagonist) on the contractility of term human myometrium. With institutional ethical approval myometrial biopsies from term parturients undergoing elective caesarean section were obtained (n = 7). In vitro contractile responses to a range of ergometrine concentrations (10 -10 to 10 -5 M) in the presence and absence of ketanserin (10 -7 M) were analysed. Control strips were run simultaneously. The effects of ergometrine with and without ketanserin were compared using two-way repeated ANOVA with Bonferroni post tests where appropriate. p \\ 0.05 was considered significant. Ergometrine exerted a significant concentration dependent uterotonic effect compared to time matched controls at 10 -7 (p \\ 0.05) and at 10 -6 and 10 -5 M concentrations (p \\ 0.001). Frequency of contractions significantly increased only at 10 -5 M concentration (p \\ 0.01). The addition of ketanserin (10 -7 M) did not alter either the uterotonic effect or the effect on contractile frequency of ergometrine.",

Glycoconjugates (glycolipids, glycoproteins and proteoglycans) are found in abundance on all cell surfaces in nature, forming a dense array of glycans (known as the glycocalyx). The glycosylation pattern of a cell can change rapidly depending on the physiological states, stresses of cell-cell interaction, local environment and pathological state. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) initially discovered in 1996 have a role in endothelial repair and angiogenesis [1] . Our group has shown that pre-incubation of EPCs in osteopontin (OPN), a heavily phosphorylated glycoprotein enhances their therapeutic benefit after transplantation in a model of hind limb ischemia. Furthermore, OPN expression is down regulated in the transcriptomic studies in diabetic patients compared with healthy subjects [2] . OPN is a heavily phosphorylated molecule secreted by different sources in the body and has multiple domains that facilitate OPNintegrin binding in various cell types. EPCs play a central role in vascular biology but the mechanism of action of exposing EPCs to OPN is poorly understood. Our current aim is to characterize this glycoprotein and generate its different glycoforms to understand the role of OPN glycosylation in angiogenesis/wound healing.",

Some of these have been reported previously, however we have also identified a number of genes which have not previously been implicated in MM disease progression [1] . A gene coding for a sialyltransferase shown to be upregulated in this analysis is responsible for the transfer of sialic to terminal positions of glycoprotein carbohydrate groups. These residues are key determinants of sialyl Lewis X, a tetrasaccharide known to play a vital role in cell to cell recognition. Cellular trafficking in MM is mediated in the bone marrow by selectins. The common minimum binding determinant for all selectins is sialyl-Lewis X; therefore formation of this determinant is critical to myeloma biology. The observed up-regulation of this gene in the microarray studies was validated using RT-PCR in MM cell lines and primary samples. Expression of the corresponding protein expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry on primary bone marrow sections from MM patients, which demonstrated specific golgi staining compared to controls. Lectin microarray analysis of membrane protein extracts from MM cell lines showed binding to sialic acid-specific lectins, which supports the hypothesis that MM cells have altered sialylation.",

In addition to treating depression, antidepressants such as amitriptyline are a first-line treatment for chronic pain. Thus, common neural substrates may underlie the co-morbidity of these disorders. Alteration in astrocyte activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both depression and chronic pain.

Sialic acids occur predominantly as terminal sugars on the glycan chains of glycoconjugates on the cell surface and of individual glycoproteins. A unique feature of sialic acids is their structural variability, with more than 50 naturally occurring modifications. The sialic acid, N-glycolyl neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) occurs widely in most mammals. However, evolutionary forces have removed the gene capable of making Neu5Gc, from the human genome, therefore raising questions about its role in both immune response and human diseases. Neu5Gc has been reported to be present in altered glycan phenotypes in humans associated with cancer development. Though the role of Neu5Gc in cancer is not clear, it is hypothesized that it contributes to cancer progression via induction of inflammatory response and angiogenesis, thus acting as a facilitator in tumor invasion [1] . Neu5Gc has also been reported to be present on a number of recombinant therapeutic proteins produced in non-human cell lines, such as NS0, SP2/0 and CHO systems [2] . Here, the presence of Neu5Gc has been demonstrated to be responsible for inducing an immune response, thereby compromising the overall safety and efficacy of the drugs. Thus, a need exists for rapid identification and detection of this non-human sialic acid both in clinical cancer diagnosis and within the biopharmaceutical industry for monitoring drugs intended for human use.",

Zwacka National Centre for Biomedical Engineering Science, Molecular Therapeutics Groups, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a potent and specific inducer of apoptosis in tumour cells. In order to achieve efficient delivery of TRAIL to tumour tissue, we made use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that are known to be able to infiltrate tumors and deliver their gene therapeutic payload. Furthermore, we exchanged the consensus wild-type TRAIL for variants that contain specific changes in the amino acid sequence and consequently act selectively through either TRAIL-receptor1 (DR4) or TRAIL-recep-tor2 (DR5). These different TRAIL variants were expressed from constructs that contained the signal peptide from the human factor IX gene, a furin cleavage site, an isoleucine zipper and the ectodomain of TRAIL (aa114-aa289). After initial tests, these expression cassettes were integrated into adenoviral vectors that were subsequently used to transduce MSCs. The resulting TRAIL-secreting MSCs were termed MSC.sTRAIL wt , MSC.sTRAIL DR4 and MSC.sTRAIL DR5 . When these MSCs were mixed with human colorectal cancer Colo205 cells, MSC.sTRAIL DR5 triggered three times more times apoptosis than MSC.sTRAIL wt, whereas MSC.sTRAIL DR4 had almost no apoptosisinducing activity on Colo205 cells. In contrast, on HeLa cervical carcinoma cell MSC.sTRAIL DR4 had a superior effect, and normally TRAIL resistant pancreatic cancer cells could be driven into apoptosis by MSC.sTRAILs, when combined with XIAP inhibition in the tumour cells. Furthermore, treatment of HCT116 cells with MSC.sTRAILs in combination with 5-FU resulted in a synergistic cytotoxic effect. All those findings demonstrate that the use of TRAIL-receptor selective variants can greatly enhance the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-delivered TRAIL as part of an individualised and tumour specific treatment approach.",

In the delivery system, heparin binds to a peptide which has been covalently cross-linked to a fibrin matrix. Growth factor in turn binds to the heparin, and growth factor release is governed by both binding and diffusion mechanisms, the purpose of the binding being to slow growth factor release. The governing mathematical model, which in its original formulation consists of six partial differential equations, is reduced to a system of just two equations. It is usually desirable that there be no passive release of growth factor from a device, with all of the growth factor being held in place via binding until such time as it is actively released by invading cells. However, there will inevitably be some passive release, and so it is of interest to identify conditions that will make this release as slow as possible. In this poster, we identify a parameter regime that ensures that at least a fraction of the growth factor will release slowly. It is found that slow release is assured if the matrix is prepared with the concentration of peptide greatly exceeding the dissociation constant of heparin from the peptide, and with the concentration of heparin greatly exceeding the dissociation constant of the growth factor from heparin. Also, for the first time, in vitro experimental release data is directly compared with theoretical release profiles generated by the model and a satisfactory agreement has been found.",

Furthermore, females are up to twice as likely to experience depression and chronic pain disorders, whereas males have an increased risk for developing schizophrenia, indicating that stressful early life events may elicit sex-dependent alterations in physiological function. The present study aimed to determine the effect of early life stress on affective behaviours and nociceptive responding in adulthood, and if such alterations are influenced by the sex of the animal. Male and female Wistar pups were subjected to maternal deprivation (MD: n = 20) or left undisturbed (non-MD: n = 20) for 24 h on postnatal day 9 (PND 9). Affective behaviour was examined using the open field test (locomotor activity and anxietylike behaviour), holeboard test (exploratory/investigative behaviour) and elevated plus maze (anxiety-like behaviour) in adulthood (PND 70-88). Nociceptive responding of the hind-paws to mechanical (von Frey), thermal (hot plate) and cold (acetone-drop test) stimuli was also examined. Data were analysed using ANOVA followed by Fisher's LSD post hoc test. P B 0.05 was deemed significant.MD females, but not males, exhibited a significant increase in locomotor activity (distance moved) in the open field test when compared to both control females and MD males (control females: 1,697 \u00b1 152 cm; MD females: 2,149 \u00b1 118 cm; MD males:",

The main differences in HbA 1c were observed between Ireland and the UK (p = 0.001) and the UK and Germany (p = 0.012). In TS the main differences observed were between Ireland and the UK (p = 0.01) and the UK and Germany (p = 0.004), the main PAID differences observed was between Ireland and Germany (p = 0.004). There were differences observed between Ireland and the UK (p = 0.000) and Ireland and Germany (p = 0.046) in the EQ-5D.It is clear that differences exist across the healthcare systems and between participants from Ireland, the UK and Germany at baseline. Identifying these differences and understanding why these differences occur will help inform decision-makers of the most effective strategies to managing type 1 diabetes.The authors acknowledge grant support from the HRB Health Services R&D Award Aptamers are oligonucleotides (DNA or RNA) which have a capacity to bind with a variety of biomarker with high affinity and specificity. Here we describe the development of aptamers against the Neu5Gc. The most commonly used methodology for finding and developing aptamers is termed SELEX [2] (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment). In SELEX, specific nucleic acid aptamers are isolated from a diverse pool of randomized nucleic acids containing more than 10 12 different sequences, by successive rounds of selection and re-amplification.We started with a 60 bp synthetic DNA library pool with a 30 bp random variable region and flanking constant regions permitting reamplification. In total, ten rounds of solution-phase panning were carried out against Neu5Gc-spacer-biotin and bound aptamers were isolated utilising streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Three rounds of negative selection were also performed to increase further the specific DNA binders against Neu5Gc-against the spacer-biotin alone, Neu5Ac-spacer-biotin, and against bovine and human serum albumin (BSA and HSA, respectively). The outputs of each panning round were evaluated for ability to specifically bind Neu5Gc presented as conjugates of BSA and biotin. DNA pools demonstrating a higher binding were cloned into E. coli direct sequencing and selected sequences tested.The authors acknowledge grant support from Science Foundation Ireland.

Sharma 2 Arrythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) has been linked to several causative mutations in desmosomal proteins such as plakoglobin and plakophilin-2. These proteins are required to ensure correct adhesion between cells undergoing high levels of mechanical stress, a feature of particular importance in cardiomyocytes. A plakoglobin knockdown model in zebrafish has already been established and characterized, demonstrating cardiac defects including decreased heart rate, cardiac oedema and blood pooling [1] . This model also displayed increased expression of Wnt target genes suggesting a signaling role for plakoglobin. Further evidence for plakoglobin as a positive regulator of Wnt signaling was the ability of Wnt inhibitor Dikkopf-1(Dkk1) to rescue the gross morphological defects of the plakoglobin knockdown phenotype.Here we evaluate the global knockdown of plakoglobin as a model for the human congenital heart condition ARVC, by examining the mRNA expression of several ARVC-related genes. One of the key diagnostic features of ARVC is the replacement of cardiomyocytes with fibro-fatty tissue. To investigate if this aspect of the human condition is replicated in our morphant embryos mRNA expression levels of adipogenic transcription factor Wnt5b and adipogenic marker ppar-c were also examined. The signaling role of plakoglobin was also further investigated by assessing the ability of Wnt inhibitor Dikkopf-1 to rescue the plakoglobin knockdown phenotype.Desmoplakin, a required component of desmosomes, and connexin-43, a gap-junction protein known to be affected in human ARVC [2] show reduced mRNA expression at 72 h post-fertilization (hpf) compared to control morpholino-injected siblings. Surprisingly, adipogenic genes Wnt5b and ppar-c also show reduced expression compared to controls.Dikkopf-1 can rescue the gross phenotypic defects observed in plakoglobin morphant embryos, but cannot compensate for the loss of the plakoglobin protein in cell-cell junctions, as phenotypically ''rescued'' embryos injected with plakoglobin morpholino and Dkk1 mRNA demonstrated when cell-cell borders in the cardiac epithelium were examined by transmission electron microscopy. Control morpholino-injected embryos and embryos over-expressing Dikkopf-1 were found to have comparable numbers of desmosomes at cell-cell borders, however plakoglobin knockdown embryos and embryos ''rescued'' by co-injection of Dkk-1 displayed decreased numbers of desmosomes, indicating that though Dkk1 can restore Wnt signaling to normal level it cannot compensate for the ultra-structural defects resulting from loss of plakoglobin.The authors acknowledge grant support from the Thomas Crawford-Hayes Trust Fund.Complex carbohydrates are involved in molecular and cellular recognition, most chronic diseases and in immune response. Sialic acid is a family of nine carbon sugar that is critical in immune recognition and the half life of molecules in vivo. Human cells are predominantly covered with the form of sialic acid N-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) whereas most other mammals also posses N-glycolyl neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc): a form homo sapiens are unable to synthesize due to a genetic mutation in the CMAH gene responsible for converting Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc. There is also evidence that Neu5Gccontaining glycoconjugates occur frequently in cancer patients and in in vitro systems. Recently, it has been shown that tumor-associated Neu5Gc can interact with low levels of naturally occurring circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies thereby facilitating tumor progression via chronic inflammation in human-like Neu5Gc-deficient mouse model [1] . There is therefore increased interest in the biology of this non-human sialic acid. The availability of specific binders for Neu5Gc would be very useful for these studies, both as analytical reagents and also as interrogation tools.",
