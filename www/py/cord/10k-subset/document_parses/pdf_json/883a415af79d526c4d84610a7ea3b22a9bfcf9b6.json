            "text": "Purpose. Traditionally, vaccines have been administered by needle injection. Topical immunization through the intact skin with either protein-or DNA-based vaccines has attracted much attention recently. We sought to enhance the immune responses induced by DNA-based vaccines after topical application by developing novel ethanol-in-fluorocarbon (E/F) microemulsion systems to aid in the delivery of plasmid DNA (pDNA). Methods. Ten different fluorosurfactants were selected or synthesized and screened by pseudo-phase-diagram construction for their ability to form E/F microemulsions. Plasmid DNA was successfully incorporated into E/F microemulsions using several different fluorosurfactants and perfluorooctyl bromide as the continuous fluorocarbon phase. For several reasons, Zonyl \u00ae FSN-100 (an ethoxylated nonionic fluorosurfactant) was selected for further studies. In vivo studies were performed in mice to assess pDNA expression in skin and immunologic responses after topical application of this system using a luciferase-encoding plasmid (CMV-luciferase) and a CMV-\u2424-galactosidase-encoding plasmid, respectively. Results. Plasmid DNA incorporated into E/F microemulsion using FSN-100 as the surfactant was found to be stable. After topical application of this E/F microemulsion system, significant enhancements in luciferase expression and antibody and T-helper type-1 biased immune responses were observed relative to those of \"naked\" pDNA in saline or ethanol. For example, with the E/F microemulsion system, the specific serum IgG and IgA titers were increased by 45-fold and over 1000-fold, respectively. Conclusion. A novel fluorocarbon-based microemulsion system for potential DNA vaccine delivery was developed.",

            "text": "Traditionally, vaccines have been comprised of proteins, live attenuated viruses, or killed bacteria. However, DNA vaccines have attracted much attention recently. Besides being able to elicit humoral immune responses, protein antigens encoded on plasmids expressed by the transfected cells can be presented endogenously through the MHC class-I pathway and thus lead to the generation of a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response or cellular immune response (1) . Other potential advantages of DNA vaccines include stability, costeffectiveness for manufacture and storage, safety, and the potential to present multiple antigens on one plasmid (2) . Until recently, intramuscular injection (i.m.) has been the primary method to administer DNA vaccines. The i.m. route has proven to be very effective in eliciting protective and thera-peutic immune responses in small animal models. However, recent studies involving primates and humans have shown that the potency of these DNA vaccines was very limited and variable (2) . Consequently, there exists a clear need to improve the potency of DNA vaccines for human immunization and/or to explore alternative routes for administration.",

For example, the viable epidermis of skin contains Langerhans cells (LC), immature dendritic cells (DC) believed to be the most potent antigen-presenting cell (APC). Although LCs account for only 1-4% of the total cells in the epidermis, they cover over 25% of the skin area because of their \"dendritic\" structure (3) . In fact, as an alternative to i.m. administration, researchers have investigated the administration of DNA vaccines to the skin using intradermal needle injection (i.d.)

            "text": "Recently, a growing body of evidence has pointed out the advantages and feasibility of topical immunization on skin (7, 8) . Skin is available and readily accessible, which makes topical application convenient. Moreover, topical immunization could be much less expensive because the strict sterility requirement for parenteral vaccines is unnecessary for topical administration. The feasibility of topical immunization with protein-based antigen was first demonstrated by Glenn et al. (7) . Subsequent work by this group and others showed that this means of immunization is viable for a variety of protein antigens in animal models ranging from mouse to sheep, dog, and even human (9) (10) (11) . The first successful DNA immunization on skin by the topical application was reported in 1997 by Tang et al. and Niemiec et al. (8, 12) . Thereafter, several reports have been published that demonstrated improved efficiency and the elucidation of possible mechanisms for the induction of immune responses (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . The potency of immunization using \"naked\" pDNA alone by the topical route has proven to be quite low (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . Consequently, pDNA has been complexed with cationic liposomes and polymers, and/ or coated on the surface of preformed cationic nanoparticles to elicit stronger immune responses.",

(1999) , by complexing HBsAg-encoding pDNA with Lipofectin \u00ae and applying the complexes on shaved or unshaved skin, demonstrated little or no enhancement of immune responses in mice over \"naked\" pDNA alone. Fan et al., using skin graft transplantation, demonstrated that the presence of normal hair follicles was required to elicit an immune response to the expressed antigen, indicating a possible mechanism for topical DNA immunization (14) . However, Watabe et al. showed that, when applied topically to Balb/C mice, an influenza virus A/PR/8/34 matrix (M) gene containing plasmid complexed with DC-Chol/DOPE liposomes, produced a stronger immune response and enhanced protection against influenza virus challenge, relative to the \"naked\" pDNA alone (17) . For these studies, the keratinocytic layer of the skin was artificially removed before dosing, making the immunization no longer noninvasive. By coating pDNA on preformed chitosan-based nanoparticles, Cui and Mumper found that these chitosan-based systems produced both detectable and quantifiable levels of luciferase expression in mouse skin 24 h after topical application to shaved skin and significant enhancements in antigen-specific IgG titer to expressed \u2424-galactosidase at day 28 (15) . The IgG titer with selected chitosan-based nanoparticles was up to 32-fold greater than that in mice immunized with \"naked\" pDNA alone. Further, when pDNA was coated on the surface of novel cationic nanoparticles engineered from microemulsion precursors, the resulting IgG titer was enhanced 16-fold over that produced by \"naked\" pDNA alone. These pDNA-coated nanoparticles were also found to elicit significantly enhanced splenocyte proliferative immune responses (16) .",

The hair covering the back of the mouse was shaved with an A5 \u00ae Single-Speed Clipper (Oster Professional Products, Mc-Minnville, TN). The skin was wiped with an alcohol swab and allowed to air dry for 5 min. One hundred microliters of each formulation (pDNA, 5 g) was dripped onto the skin with a pipette and subsequently spread, if necessary, with the pipette tip to cover an area within a circle having a diameter of 2.3-2.5 cm. Care was taken to disperse the formulations over the skin without applying pressure. After 24 h, mice were killed, and the skin was collected and immediately frozen to \u221220\u00b0C in 2-mL conical screw cap microtubes (Quality Scientific Plastics) filled with zirconia/silica beads (10-20, 1 mm diameter, Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). The skin samples were cut into small pieces (\u223c2 \u00d7 2 mm) and crushed three times using a Minibead Beater (Biospec Products) for 1 min each at 5000 rpm. After each minute, the samples were cooled down on ice to minimize protein damage from the heat created during bead beating. Then 100 L of 1\u00d7 reporter lysis buffer (Promega) was added to the homogenized samples. After brief vortexing at room temperature, the samples were frozen and thawed for three cycles and subsequently spun down at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant fluid from each sample was collected. Luciferase expression in each sample was assayed by adding 100 L of reconstituted luciferase assay solution (Promega) to 20 L of each sample and counting in Dynatech Microlite \u00ae 1 plates in an ML2250 Dynatech Luminometer (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, CA). The peak values for each sample and negative control as reported from the Luminometer were recorded. Protein concentration in the samples (20 L) was determined using the Coomassie \u00ae Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce). As recommended by Dynatech, luciferase expression data were reported as the ratio of the peak values of the samples to that of the negative control, divided by the total amount of protein in the 20 L of samples assayed. A one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher's protected least significant difference procedure (PLSD) was used to analyze the data. A result of p \u0545 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.",

These six fluorosurfactants and the maximum amount of ethanol incorporated into each stable clear microemulsion using a perfluorooctyl bromide/ fluorosurfactant ratio of 70:30 w/w ratio are listed in Table II . As expected, no E/F microemulsion could be formed with the octanoic acid because this molecule is not fluorinated and has very limited solubility or miscibility with perflubron. The microemulsions shown in Table II were clear and stable throughout the microemulsion window, except for the system made with D4. The use of D4 produced a slightly opaque system. The use of D6 and D7 resulted in microemulsions that apparently solubilized a very high amount of ethanol in perflubron. However, it is very likely that these were actually reversed fluorocarbon-in-ethanol (F/E) systems. For some reason, no microemulsion windows were formed using D8, an ester of PDFOA.

The high level of specific IgA titer in the serum of mice immunized topically with the pDNAincorporated fluorocarbon-based microemulsion is expected to be mostly monomeric IgA. A significant level of highaffinity specific IgA secreted on the mucosal surface is required to neutralize microbial toxins and animal venoms. It is also required to prevent viruses and bacteria from colonizing and thereafter infecting cells. Although it would be of interest to measure the IgA levels in local mucosal epithelial fluid (e.g., nasal fluid and vaginal fluid), the high IgA titer in the serum suggests that the local mucosal IgA level should also be enhanced (27) . Nevertheless, future investigations in our laboratories with this system will include the measurement of local mucosal IgA.",

            "text": "The mechanisms of the immune response induction by the noninvasive topical immunization remain largely unknown. However, Fan et al., using skin graft transplantation, demonstrated that the presence of intact hair follicles was required for the elicitation of immune responses (14) . It is believed that hair-follicle transport of this E/F microemulsion system is the most probable mechanism because it is unlikely that highly charged hydrophilic macromolecules such as pDNA could penetrate the intact stratum corneum (21) . It was found that the expression of luciferase in mouse skin was enhanced when the pDNA was incorporated into the fluorocarbon-based microemulsion system, as compared to pDNA in normal saline or ethanol. Therefore, enhancement of antigen expression in localized skin may be related to the enhancement in the observed immune responses. However, it should be cautioned that, in general, no direct correlation has been observed between the levels of gene expression and immune responses (6, 30) . Plasmid DNA may be picked up by Langerhans cells (LC) in the skin epidermis, which, after activation, migrate to the local lymph nodes for antigen expression and presentation (2) . No information is available about what cell type was transfected (i.e., the follicular keratinocytes, local LCs) or the mechanism(s) of antigen presentation. It is not known whether it was an MHC class II-restricted presentation of antigens that were secreted by transfected somatic cells or a direct presentation of antigens that are produced endogenously in the transfected dendritic cells (DC). Studies are under way in our laboratories to answer these questions. However, it is apparent that the immune response enhancement was related to some effects caused by a combination of the fluorocarbon and the fluorosurfactant, FSN-100. Unlike any previous topical application of pDNA formulations in aqueous media (15, 16) , the perflubron-based microemulsion system, when applied to the skin, without any assistance, spread immediately and completely covered the shaved skin area. Thus, better coverage of the E/F microemulsion over the skin area may have contributed, in part, to the immune response enhancement reported in these studies. Further, the presence of a fluorosurfactant may have enhanced the uptake of pDNA into the hair follicles.",

However, in the present studies, no adverse effects or gross in- flammatory reactions were observed after topical application (\u223c40 mg) to shaved mouse skin, even after repeated applications.",

Actually, as mentioned earlier, pDNA was also successfully incorporated into the PDFOA-containing microemulsion system. However, this system was not investigated further. PDFOA is an acidic fluorosurfactant, which may be deleterious to the incorporated pDNA. In addition, in a preliminary mouse study to assess the topical application of E/F microemulsions using PDFOA as the surfactant, severe toxic effects were observed including death.",
