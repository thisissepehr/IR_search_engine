About 20 years ago, the crude mortality rate of septic shock exceeded 50 % in nonselected populations [1, 2] .

Nevertheless, most epidemiological and interventional studies about septic shock report crude mortality rates that make deaths directly related to the initial septic process or to secondary nosocomial infections hardly distinguishable. The negative results of interventional studies in sepsis despite a robust scientific rationale should then question about the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to death of septic patients. Lastly, a number of ICU patients die after therapeutic limitations as a result of withholding or withdrawing life support decisions that were not accurately reported within studies. With respect to the current trends in epidemiology and outcome of septic shock and to the design of future interventional trials in the field, a better comprehension of the clinical course of septic shock is required beyond the common but gross endpoint of vital status.

Hence, it is our usual policy of full engagement for a 3-day time frame for most septic patients. Allocation of the cause of death was aimed to identify the disease responsible for fatality rather than the final common pathways of terminal organ failures. Disorders responsible for death were determined by analysis of the medical file by two independent physicians (FD and DG), and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. ICU-acquired infections were defined as new infections acquired more than 48 h after ICU admission. Decisions to withholding or withdrawing life support were also collected.

Although the visual aspects of survival curves from retrospective or prospective studies provide a gross evaluation of death kinetics in the course of septic shock, specific and reliable data about the timing of deaths are scarce. We herein provided an original comprehensive analysis of modalities of death in septic shock. Because obtaining an accurate etiological diagnosis is of paramount importance in the outcome of critically ill patients, we aimed at describing the primary cause of death as a disease and not as accumulation of organ failures. With respect to the high prevalence of comorbidities and high severity scores on admission, the in-hospital mortality rate of septic shock was 45 % in the present unselected cohort. This is in line with the in-hospital mortality rate of 48.6 % in a recent French cohort of septic shock with similar features, including a similar prevalence of comorbidities (65 %) [5] . The current mortality rate of the ANZICS cohort was reported seemingly lower (22 %), but it encompassed both severe sepsis and septic shock, and the prevalence of comorbidities was only 35 % [4] . The extent of multiple organ failure accounted for the large majority of early deaths in the present cohort. However, the 3-day mortality rate was only 14.3 %, compared to the 3-day mortality rate of 27 % in a cohort of septic shock patients managed in the ICU during the early 1990s [20] . Two French and Spanish multicenter observational studies that included both severe sepsis and septic shock patients in 2001-2002 reported consistent mortality rates of 13.3 and 14.8 %, respectively [21, 22] . Altogether, these data suggest that the overall improvement in the outcome of septic shock is at least partially due to a decrease in the early mortality rate. It is likely that the Surviving Sepsis Campaign bundles for early and aggressive resuscitation of severe sepsis and septic shock contributed to decrease the number of early deaths [23, 13] . Interestingly, admission SOFA scores were similar between alive and late deceased patients, suggesting that late deaths were less related to the initial severity, and were rather dependent on subsequent development of lethal ICU-acquired complications and/or therapeutic limitations.

ICU-acquired mesenteric ischemia is most often associated with microvascular abnormalities. Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia is a common complication of shock regardless of the underlying etiology and is often considered as the main contributor to terminal multiple organ failure in relation with breaches in the digestive mucosal barrier [30] . Thus, mesenteric ischemia might reflect the severity of shock, and individualizing it as an alternative or independent cause of death is debatable. Yet, the diagnosis is often difficult and is based on the combination of clinical manifestations, biological markers of cell lysis, and suggestive abdominal CT scan findings. A definite diagnosis might be confirmed by digestive endoscopic examination, even up to exploratory laparotomy when highly suspected. In a recent multicenter study of 780 critically ill patients with mesenteric ischemia, the diagnosis was based on CT scan findings in 58 % of patients while it could be proven by surgery and digestive endoscopy in 27 and 15 % of patients, respectively.

Altogether, these results highlight the pejorative impact of quantitative or functional defective phagocytosis on early outcome of septic shock. In contrast, patients with previous corticosteroid treatment seemed relatively preserved from early mortality but were more likely to die later. This finding is intriguing but could be related to the impact of corticosteroids on maintenance of vascular response to vasopressors or immunomodulatory properties toward the overwhelming inflammatory response of septic shock [34] [35] [36] . Cirrhosis is well known to be associated with a high mortality rate in case of septic shock and was rather found to be associated with late mortality.

The major limit certainly lies in the retrospective design of the study. However, we included all consecutive patients within the study period, and the collection of data was almost exhaustive.
