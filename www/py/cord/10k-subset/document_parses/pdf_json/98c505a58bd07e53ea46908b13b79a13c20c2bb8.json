ZFNs are synthetic restriction endonucleases, custom designed to cut DNA at specific sequences. They consist of a zinc-finger domain that recognizes specific DNA sequences and a nuclease domain. Genes encoding the ZFNs are delivered to plant cells in an expression plasmid. Depending on the method, the expression plasmid may additionally contain a short template sequence or a stretch of DNA to be inserted. The ZFNs create a double-strand break (DSB) at a specific site in the DNA. The double-strand break stimulates the cell's repair mechanism, the process of homologous recombination and the insertion of DNA. Essentially three methods are in development: ZFN-1, ZFN genes are delivered to plant cells without a repair template. The ZFN binds to a specific DNA sequence and generates a site-specific DSB. Gene repair mechanisms of the plant cell intervene to repair the break and generate site-specific mutations, which consist of changes of single or few base pairs, short deletions or insertions. ZFN-2, ZFN genes are delivered to plant cells along with a short repair template, consisting of a DNA sequence homologous to the targeted area with the exception of a point mutation.

Both approaches aim to confer a new property to the modified plant.
