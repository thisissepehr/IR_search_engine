Registries for these disorders have provided important epidemiological data and shown both racial and geographical variations. The clinical features of 76 patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders registered in Kuwait National Primary Immunodeficiency Registry from 2004 to 2006 were recorded. Ninety-eight percent of the patients presented in childhood. The prevalence of these disorders in children was 11.98 in 100,000 children with an incidence of 10.06 in 100,000 children. The distribution of these patients according to each primary immunodeficiency category is: combined T and B cell immunodeficiencies (21%), predominantly antibody immunodeficiency (30%), other well defined immunodeficiencies (30%), diseases of immune dysregulation (7%), congenital defects of phagocyte number, function or both (8%), and complement deficiencies (4%). The consanguinity rate within the registered patients was 77%. The patients had a wide range of clinical features affecting different body systems. Primary immunodeficiency disorders are prevalent in Kuwait and have a significant impact into the health system.",

Patients with PID are prone to develop recurrent, serious, and unusual infections. The patients are also prone to develop non-infectious presentations. These include, but not limited to, neutropenia, autoimmunity, absence lymphoid tissues or lymphadenopathy, enteropathy, failure to thrive, dermatitis, malignancies, and atopy [1] [2] [3] [4] . Recent advances in molecular biology have helped identify the primary biologic defect in a growing number of these disorders. PID are classified into eight categories according to the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases Classification Committee [5] :",

Many physicians do not often consider the possibility of immunodeficiency early enough in the differential diagnosis or they consider themselves inadequate to evaluate the immune system [6] . Currently, no screening is performed for these defects at birth, during childhood, or in adulthood. Therefore, PID are usually detected only after the individual has experienced recurrent infections that may or may not have caused permanent organ damage [7] [8] [9] . Early diagnosis by increasing awareness of physicians about these disorders is important so life saving treatment and precautions can be implemented to decrease mortality and morbidity and to improve the quality of life [10] [11] [12] .",

Interestingly, this finding is consistent with a previous report about PID in Kuwait [27] . These differences could be due to racial background. This was clearly documented in multiple reports: higher frequency of selective IgA deficiency in Latin Americans compared to both the Japanese and Australian population [14, 20, 23] ; elevated number of ataxia-telangiectasia in Costa Ricas compared to Switzerland [14, 21] ; high prevalence of complement deficiencies in Ireland and North Africa [17, 28, 29] ; and increased prevalence of humoral immunodeficiency in Arabs compared to the western population [19] . The very high rate of consanguinity in our registry (77%) could also account for these differences, with a particular increase in the autosomal recessive diseases. Under-diagnosis of some milder forms of PID like selective IgA deficiency and IgG subclasses deficiency may also play a role in these differences. Common variable immunodeficiency, which presents later in life compared to other PID, is the most common PID reported in Iran, Ireland, Australia, and Norway, with a frequency of about 25% of all PID patients [13, 17, 20, 25] . In our registry where the mean age of presentation was 15 months and 90% of the patients presented before the age of 3 years, only two patients with common variable immunodeficiency (3%) were registered. This could also be the cause of lower frequency of predominantly antibody immunodeficiency.",

Examples are the higher occurrence of atopic and autoimmune disorders in patients with predominantly antibody immunodeficiency, while skin and gastrointestinal manifestations were more prominent in patients with combined T and B cell immunodeficiencies. This finding is in agreement with previous reports [1] [2] [3] [4] . Early diagnosis by increasing the index of suspicion of physicians and subspecialists about these disorders is important so life saving interventions can be done to decrease mortality and morbidity and to improve the quality of life [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] .",

None of the patients developed significant complications to BCG vaccine compared to the reports by others [13, 24] . The practice in Kuwait until 2005 is to vaccinate children with BCG at school age when all forms of serious PID like combined T and B cell immunodeficiencies, Wischott-Aldrich syndrome, and chronic granulomatous disease have presented and fortunately been diagnosed. The vaccination policy has changed, and BCG vaccine is currently given at 3 months of age; it will be interesting to review the effect of this change on the occurrence of complications related to BCG vaccine after few years. It is important to emphasize that patients with recurrent, serious, and unusual infections should be screened for PID. Physicians should be educated about the ten warning signs of PID so early interventions with intravenous immunoglobulins and immune reconstitution can be used to prevent significant tissue damage, morbidity, and mortality [30, [35] [36] [37] [38] .",
