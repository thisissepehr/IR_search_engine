All had previously presented severe infectious processes, accompanied by diverse organ failure accompanied by the Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in all cases. Two patients died and the three survivors suffered severe motor deficiencies. Electromyographic studies revealed axonal damage which predominately affected motor neurons. Cerebrospinal fluid was normal in all1 the patients except one, who showed a moderate increase of lymphocytes. The common causes of polyneuropathy were excluded, but in all cases a nutritional disorder was detected, based on laboratory values of proteins, serum albumin and transferrin. We conclude that polyneuropathy is relatively frequent among critically ill patients and must be closely monitored because of diagnostic difficulties and the repercussions on the progress of these patients. In spite of uncertainties about its cause, it appears to be related to severe infectious processes, ARDS, and nutritional disorders.",

Circulatory failure: heart failure, shock or the need for vasoactive drugs for more than 24 h. Renal failure: plasma creatinine higher than 2 mg/dL in the absence of a previous renal disease. Hepatic failure: serum bilirubin level increased by 3 mg/dL over baseline or serum transaminases levels greater than twice normal.

Metabolic failure: hypoproteinemia (serum total proteins less than 5.5 g/dL) or hyperglycemia (plasma glucose over 200 mg/dL) or metabolic acidosis.

These features were reversible and may directly be related to the same central or peripheral neurological damage or be due to so-called septic encephalopathy [17] , a functional disturbance produced by toxic and metabolic disorders without a characteristic organic lesion. Although in other structural studies [14] no lesions were present in several of the cases of encephalopathy, diffuse micro-abscesses, central pontine myelinolysis, diffuse micro-hemorrhages, and multiple cerebral infarctions were encountered in others [18] .",

Further differences are based on cerebrospinal fluid analysis, which shows protein elevation with albumin-cytological dissociation, while in the polyneuropathy of critically ill patients, the cerebrospinal fluid is usually normal, except for slight protein elevation occasionally. Finally, histological findings which show areas of axonal degeneration without inflammatory changes establish additional differences with the Guillain-Barr6 syndrome. In spite of these differences and because some cases of Guillain-Barr6 syndrome with an axonal pattern have been described [20] , polyneuropathy in critically ill patients could be regarded as a variant of this syndrome [21] . The appearance of a series of phenomena which affect various organs which has been termed multiorganic failure has been referred to when dealing with severe infectious processes [8] . The cause of this syndrome seems to be a disorder of the oxidative metabolism at the cellular level produced by hypoxia secondary to hypoperfusion. This produces an alteration of the basic source of energy for cellular metabolism, namely ATP. An increase in the use of ATP takes place, which causes ADP and AMP to accumulate; they are then catabolized into degraded products of purine, and, because of the hypoxia, can cross cell membranes and may directly produce cellular damage [22] .",
