The spread of TB is highly dependent on people migration between cities or regions that may have different contact rates and different environmental parameters, leading to different disease spread speed in the population. In this work, a metapopulation model, i.e., networks of populations connected by migratory flows, which overcomes the assumption of homogeneous mixing between different regions was constructed. The TB model was combined to a simple demographic structure for the population living in a multi-patch environment (cities, towns, regions or countries). The model consist of a system of differential equations coupling TB epidemic at different strength and mobility between the patches. Constant recruitment rate, slow and fast progression to the disease, effective chemoprophylaxis, diagnostic and treatment are taken into account to make the model including the reality of people in the sub-Saharan African countries. The basic reproduction number (R 0 ) was B S. Bowong computed and it was demonstrated that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if R 0 < 1. When R 0 > 1, the disease-free equilibrium is unstable and there exists one endemic equilibrium. Moreover, the impact of increasing migration rate between patches on the TB spread was quantified using numerical implementation of the model. Using an example on 15 inter-connected patches on the same road, we demonstrated that most people was most likely to get infected if the disease starts in a patch in the middle than in border patches.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Tuberculosis (abbreviated as TB for tubercle bacillus) is a common deadly infectious disease caused mainly by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) that primarily attacks the lungs (pulmonary TB). TB can also affect the central nervous system, the circulatory system, the genital-urinary system, bones, joints and even the skin. MTB spreads mostly through contact with active pulmonary TB persons, although [1, 2] and not from latently infected persons. MTB transmission depends on the number of infectious droplets expelled by a carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, duration of the exposure and virulence of the MTB strain [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The transmission chain can therefore be broken by isolating patients with active disease and starting effective anti-tuberculosis therapy [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Nowadays, about 95% of the estimated 8 million new TB cases occurring each year are in developing countries, where 80% occur among people between the ages of 15-59 years [1] , although several strategies for TB control propagation are implemented. The reason of these fails might on the heterogeneity of the countries and difficulties to access to treatment in some places. In fact, heterogeneity plays an important role in many infectious disease processes. For instance, spatial heterogeneity is a strong determinant of host-parasite relationships. In modeling spatial or geographic effects on the spread of a disease, a distinction is usually made between diffusion and dispersal models. In diffusion models, spread is made to immediately adjacent zones, hence the phenomenon of traveling waves can appear. These models traditionally use partial differential equations (PDE). However, there are some important situations that cannot be modeled by PDE. This is the case when the space considered is discrete. For example, when sparsely populated regions have to be considered, the human population is located in patches. The organization of human-hosts into well-defined social units such as families, villages or cities, are good examples of patches. Another example arises in the study of the human African Trypanosomiasis. For situations where human can travel a long distance in a short period of time, dispersal models are more appropriate to capture heterogeneity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 406, "end": 409, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 410, "end": 412, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 629, "end": 632, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 633, "end": 636, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 637, "end": 640, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 641, "end": 644, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 645, "end": 648, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 789, "end": 792, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 793, "end": 796, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 797, "end": 800, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 801, "end": 804, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 805, "end": 808, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 981, "end": 984, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "When considering dispersal models, there is an approach based on the metapopulation concept. The population is subdivided into a number of discrete patches which are supposed to be well mixed. Then in each patch, the population is subdivided into compartments corresponding to different epidemic status. This leads to a multi-compartment system. At this point two formulations are possible. The first one assumes that an infective in one patch can infect susceptible individuals in another patch. This assumption gives rise to a family of models which have been well studied [6] [7] [8] . The seminal model of [7] is the prototype of such systems. This formulation assumes that there is a spatial coupling between patches, but that individuals (vectors or hosts) do not migrate between patches. They make short 'visits' from their home patches to other patches. A number of theoretical studies have focused on the mathematical modelling of the spread of infectious diseases in heterogeneous complex metapopulations. Sattenspiel and Dietz [9] introduced a SIR epidemic model with population mobility. A two-patch model of trypanosomiasis is considered in [10] to explore control strategies through numerical simulations. Wang and Mulone [11] have computed the basic reproduction ratio R 0 for a SIS model, with \"true action mass\" on two patches. In [12] , Arino and van den Driessche computed the basic reproduction number R 0 for a SEIRS model with mass action and constant population on n patches. Fromont et al. [13] studied a SIR model with density-dependent dynamics on n patches and applied this model to the Feline leukemia virus infection on cats. A SIS model with \"pseudo mass action\" and vital dynamics on n patches was considered in [14] . They computed the basic reproduction number R 0 and proved the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) whenever R 0 < 1 when infective and susceptible individuals have the same dispersal rate. They have also proved the permanence of the disease when R 0 > 1. A local study of a SIR model on n patches has been studied by Lloyd and Jansen [15] . Using the framework of Arino and van den Driessche [11] , Ruan et al. [16] studied the global spread of SARS. They computed the R 0 . Arino et al. [17] considered SEIRS multi-species epidemic models on n patches with migration, which could be used as vector-hosts models. They computed R 0 and obtained by simulation, epidemic waves on a ring of patches. In [12] a review on epidemiological metapopulation models was given. A SIS model on n patches, with true action mass and with migration, where infective and susceptible individuals can have different migration rates has been studied by Allen et al. [18] . They computed the R 0 , proved the global asymptotic stability of the DFE when R 0 < 1 and have shown that there exists a unique endemic equilibrium when R 0 > 1. All the previous examples, except those in [12, 17, 19] have considered directly transmitted diseases. More recently in [20] , the authors studied a SEI model of TB on two patches, with true action mass and different migration rates of susceptible and infective individuals. However, a number of theoretical studies was carried out on the mathematical modelling of TB transmission dynamics [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] .

For instance, in sub-Saharan Africa, many people move a lot from place to place to go from Home to work and back or to visit family or friends. Moreover, it is well known that due to the symptoms of the disease, infectious were not able to move. Thus, in our model, we intend to take into account limitation movements of infectious and show that it can have an impact in the spread and the force of the infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "We consider the spread of TB on complex metapopulations, i.e., networks of populations connected by migratory flows. Each population within the metapopulation is composed of subpopulations of each of the various epidemiological status. Ordinary differential equations (ODE) are used to model the local interactions of these subpopulations within each compartment as well as the migration of subpopulations between adjacent compartments. Here, a patch may represent a city, a town, a region or a country, and population movements between patches may be justified by the migration or travel among patches. We distinguish n patches. For overall patches, we divided the infective class into two subgroups with different properties: (i) diagnosed infectious and (ii) undiagnosed infectious. Based on the fact that diagnosed infected are educated about the disease and its infectivity, and undiagnosed in many villages or regions in Africa do not know their TB-status due to the absence of hospital in rural areas, education, mentalities and so on, we assume that the transmission of the infection from diagnosed infectious to susceptible individuals is frequency-dependent (standard incidence), while the transmission of the infection from undiagnosed infectious to susceptible individuals is density-dependent (simple mass action), i.e., non-limited. We compute the disease-free equilibrium and the basic reproduction number R 0 . We show that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when R 0 < 1. Using implicit function theorem, we show that there exist a unique endemic equilibrium in a small neighborhood of the isolated endemic equilibrium for weak (small) migration rates. Numerical studies are presented to validate analytical results. Comparing to existing results [30] , our work differs from these studies in that our model in addition to undiagnosed infectious, our model also considers the natural recovery and traditional medicine (practiced in sub-Saharan Africa).

Upon adequate contacts with active TB, a susceptible individual becomes infected but not yet infectious. A proportion p i of the latently-infected individuals develops a fast active TB and the remainder (1 \u2212 p i ) develops a latent TB and enters the latent class E i . Among latently-infected individuals who develop a fast active TB, a proportion f i is assumed to undergo a fast progression directly to the diagnosed infectious class I i , while the remainder (1 \u2212 f i ) enter the undiagnosed infectious class J i . Once latently infected with MTB, an individual will remain so for life unless reactivation occurs. Latently infected individuals are assumed to acquire some immunity as a result of infection, which reduces the risk of subsequent infection but does not fully prevent it. Once latently infected, an individual can follow a chemoprophylaxis. We assume that chemoprophylaxis of latently infected individuals reduces their reactivation. We denote by \u03b1 i the rate of chemoprophylaxis of latently-infected individuals in patch i. Thus, \u03b1 i E i is the number of latently-infected individuals who received chemoprophylaxis in patch i.

In other word, increasing the number of person moving from patches with high TB transmission to patches with better TB control might lead to a decrease of the overall cases. We also found that the disease propagation is function of the population size, and population size change speed of convergence to the disease free equilibrium when R 0 < 1. Numerical simulation revealed that TB propagation in the patch with higher transmission rate was faster when the patch was not connected to other patches. The position of the patch with higher disease outbreak changes the number of infected in neighbors patches. Restriction on TB status for travelers was found to delay the propagation of the disease, but could not stop the disease if a better control was not applied in the patch with higher disease outbreak.
