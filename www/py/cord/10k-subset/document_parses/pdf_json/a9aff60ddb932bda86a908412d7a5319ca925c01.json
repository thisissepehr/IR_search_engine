We conducted a systematic review to identify the knowledge gaps around childhood pneumonia in Bhutan. Methods: We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect and Google scholar from conception to 3rd December 2018, World Health Organization, UNICEF, Bhutan's Ministry of Health and other local databases for relevant reports. We included any report describing pneumonia in Bhutanese children with regards to the burden of the disease, aetiology, related risk factors, clinical and prognostic characteristics, surveillance systems and national preventive strategies. Two review authors identified the records. We summarized the findings narratively. Results: We included 44 records. Although with notable decreasing trends, pneumonia is still accountable for a high burden and mortality rate in Bhutanese children. The national surveillance system focuses mainly on influenza identification but has recently introduced other viral aetiology to monitor. We found very scarce or no data with regard to the bacterial aetiology, related risk factors and clinico-radiological and prognostic characteristics. Conclusion: There is a dearth of data regarding the epidemiological, microbiological, clinical and radiological characteristics of pneumonia in children in Bhutan, leading to challenges while implementing evidence-based management and effective national preventive strategies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In 2015, pneumonia was ranked as the single biggest killer of post-neonatal children worldwide. With an estimated 15\u00b75% attributable fraction of all deaths in children under 5 years of age, pneumonia is believed to be responsible for the deaths of around 900,000 children every year [1, 2] . The main burden remains disproportionately concentrated in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where pneumonia is one of the most frequent triggers of health facility consultation, and one of the most common causes of hospitalization, representing a huge load for the overburdened and fragile health care systems [3] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 283, "end": 286, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 287, "end": 289, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 650, "end": 653, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "The world has achieved considerable progress in reducing child mortality in the last two decades [4] , and reductions in pneumonia-attributable mortality are partly responsible for such a massive public health achievement [1] .

Although substantial progress has been achieved, the toll of preventable deaths related to pneumonia remains intolerably heavy. Better implementation of the strategies shown to be effective to prevent and treat childhood pneumonia seems crucial to further reduce the burden of pneumonia. Once implemented, adequate national surveillance systems are required to evaluate their progress towards the reduction of the disease burden. To this end, it is imperative to collect reliable local data to determine the burden of the disease, the main pathogens involved, risk factors contributing to the disease, and to describe epidemiological trends. However, reliable local data are often scarce or entirely missing in LMIC, where the main burden of pneumonia remains concentrated, leading to challenges when it comes to evaluating the preventive strategies implemented [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 97, "end": 100, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 222, "end": 225, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 527, "end": 530, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 531, "end": 534, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 535, "end": 538, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1403, "end": 1406, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Bhutan is a small country (38,394 km 2 ) locked in the Himalayas between India and China [9] .
