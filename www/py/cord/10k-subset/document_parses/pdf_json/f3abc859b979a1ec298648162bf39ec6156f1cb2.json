Before initiating the spontaneous breathing trial, the TFC was measured using the electrical cardiometry technology. Patients were followed up after extubation and divided into successful weaning group and failed weaning group. Both groups were compared according to respiratory and cardiovascular parameters. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the ability of TFC to predict weaning outcome. Results: The number of successfully weaned patients was 41/64 (64%). Twenty (31%) patients had impaired cardiac contractility, and of them, 13/20 (64%) patients were successfully extubated. Both groups, successful weaning group and failed weaning group, were comparable in most of baseline characteristics; however, the TFC was significantly higher in the failed weaning group compared to the successful weaning group. The area under the ROC curves (AUCs) showed moderate predictive ability for the TFC in predicting weaning failure (AUC [95% confidence interval] 0.69 [0.57-0.8], cutoff value > 50 k\u03a9 \u22121 ), while the predictive ability of TFC was excellent in the subgroup of patients with ejection fraction < 40% (AUC [95% confidence interval 0.93 [0.72-1], cutoff value > 50 k\u03a9 \u22121 ). Conclusions: Thoracic fluid content showed moderate ability for predicting weaning outcome in surgical critically ill patients.

Measurement of the TFC depends on the impedance cardiography phenomenon which changes according to the resistance of thoracic contents to electric current [9] . The presence of lung congestion is an important cause for weaning failure especially in cardiac patients [12] . Lung congestion may also be triggered by the SBT due to the increase in the left ventricular afterload [13] , as well as the increase in the venous return and the subsequent increase in the cardiac preload [14] . The TFC is an index for both extra and intra-vascular thoracic fluid; however, the TFC showed good correlation with ultrasound in estimation of extravascular lung water [10] . Therefore, high TFC value could be an indirect measure of lung congestion and/or hypervolemia which is a known risk factor for failed weaning. This assumption is supported by previous reports in which the TFC was able to follow up the hemodynamic effect of diuretics [15] and to evaluate the thoracic fluid in patients with heart failure [16] . The TFC was also able to follow up the change in the patient body weight and the volume of the ultrafiltrate removed during hemodialysis [17] . The TFC showed good correlation with fluid balance during cardiac surgery [18] . Thoracic fluid content had been classically assessed through thoracic bio-impedance technology. In the last few years, TFC had been also measured using the newer electric cardiometry technology. The electrical cardiometry-based TFC showed useful results in evaluation of the volume status of patients undergoing autologous blood transfusion [9] . In late preterm and term newborn, TFC correlated with the occurrence of respiratory distress in the first 24 h after birth [19] . Our group had recently evaluated TFC in pre-eclamptic mothers and reported that TFC could detect mothers with high risk for pulmonary edema [10] .

This explanation is supported by Dessap et al.'s [20] findings in their randomized controlled trial in which they reported that a brain natriuretic peptide-guided protocol for weaning showed better patient outcomes compared to traditional weaning protocol. Dessap et al. had found that the value of brain natriuretic peptide, as a marker of hypervolemia, in guiding weaning is restricted to cardiac patients only [20] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 354, "end": 358, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 718, "end": 722, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Discontinuation of mechanical ventilation is usually a challenging decision in critical care practice. Premature failed weaning leads to prolonged intubation and increases morbidity and mortality [21] . On the other side, delayed weaning is also associated with serious complications [22] . Daily assessment for readiness-to-wean had been a routine recommendation for every mechanically ventilated patient [23] ; however, this approach might be associated with premature extubation leading to weaning failure; thus, meticulous research is continuously conducted for reaching accurate parameters for predicting weaning failure. Various parameters had been previously reported as predictors of lung congestion-related weaning failure such as pulmonary artery occlusion pressure which requires the presence of pulmonary artery catheter [14] , impaired left ventricular systolic function [8] , and impaired left ventricular diastolic function [24, 25] ; both are assessed using echocardiography. Brain natriuretic peptide was reported as another predictor for weaning outcome [7] . In our study, we introduced a simpler parameter that could be measured without the need for blood samples nor operator experience. Thoracic fluid content has many advantages over the previously mentioned predictors for being easily measured by younger physicians, or even by paramedics. Moreover, TFC could be easily interpreted with no inter-observer variability because it is presented in numerical values which have minimal fluctuations. We believe that there is no single parameter that can predict weaning outcome; therefore, assessment of readiness-to-wean should include different factors which evaluate respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological status of the patient. Thoracic fluid content can help the process of patient weaning especially in cardiac patients who represents 25% of the patients with failed extubation [12] . An elevated TFC could be an alarming sign in cardiac patients to initiate diuretic therapy before extubation. Our study had some limitations: (1) It is a single center study. (2) All our patients were either trauma patients or emergency surgical patients. Thus, our findings need to be confirmed in future studies in other patient populations.
