            "text": "INTRODUCTION. Fluid therapy is one of the cornerstones of hemodynamic management in critically ill patients. Although the aim of fluid therapy is to improve regional tissue perfusion, its adequacy is judged by the effect on cardiac stroke volume (SV). It is as yet unknown whether an increase in SV through a fluid challenge (FC) can also improve common parameters of regional perfusion. And if so, whether it is possible to predict the effect of a FC on regional perfusion parameters by performing a passive leg raising. METHODS. Critically ill patients, receiving invasive hemodynamic monitoring and requiring fluid therapy, were eligible for enrollment. They underwent a 30\u00b0passive leg raising (PLR) followed by a fluid challenge of 250 ml colloids. During the PLR and FC, stroke volume and cardiac output (CO) were measured as well as sublingual microcirculatory perfusion (sidestream dark field imaging), peripheral flow index (photoplethysmography of the finger) and tissue blood flow of the skin (laser Doppler flowmetry). RESULTS. 35 patients were included in our study, of which 15 (43%) were fluid responsive (FR; more than 10% increase in SV). Baseline SV and CO were significantly lower in responders than in non responders, as well as the sublingual perfusion. In the responsive patients sublingual vessel density and skin tissue blood flow increased following FC (Fig. 1) , whereas PFI on the finger remained low. During the PLR no changes in any parameter were observed. Fluid responsiveness was best predicted by SV response to PLR (AUC 0.88 \u00b1 0.08, p \\ 0.01) and baseline SV (AUC 0.79 \u00b1 0.08, p \\ 0.01), followed by baseline sublingual vessel density (AUC 0.76 \u00b1 0.09, p \\ 0.05). It was not possible to predict the response effect of FC on regional perfusion by performing a PLR. CONCLUSIONS. In septic patients, parameters of regional perfusion are not related to systemic hemodynamic parameters and do not respond uniformly to fluid administration. In fact, it is questionable whether regional perfusion does benefit from fluid therapy at all following initial resuscitation. As such, the PLR has no value in optimizing regional perfusion.",

However, arrhythmia resulted in discontinuation of the study drug in some patients, which was converted to open label norepinephrine in all cases. We conducted a per-protocol analysis limited to patients in whom the study drug was not discontinued. OBJECTIVES. To evaluate in a per protocol analysis the impact on outcome of dopamine and norepinephrine for the treatment of shock. METHODS. In a prospective, randomized study (NCT00314704), 858 patients received dopamine and 821 norepinephrine, according to a protocol described in detail elsewhere (1). Briefly, patients were randomized within 4 h max of the onset of shock to receive either dopamine (max dose 20 mcg/kg min) or norepinephrine (max dose 0.19 mcg/kg min). When the desired mean arterial pressure (MAP) could not be reached with these max doses, an open label norepinephrine was added. In the presence of problematic arrhythmias, physicians were allowed to discontinue study drug and to replace it by any vasopressor agent while blinding of initial allocation was maintained. According to our predefined analytical plan, we analyzed patients in whom study drug was not discontinued. Kaplan-Meier curves for estimated survival were compared using a log-rank test. RESULTS. The study drug was discontinued in 65 of the 1,679 patients enrolled, leaving 1,614 patients in the per-protocol analysis. Discontinuation occurred more frequently in dopamine than in norepinephrine-treated patients (52 vs. 13 patients, p \\ 0.05), so that 806 patients in the dopamine group and 808 patients in the norepinephrine group were exposed to study drug during the entire shock episode. Kaplan-Meier curves for estimated survival showed a increased mortality rate in dopamine treated patients (p = 0.031, Fig. 1 ).",

The selected incidents were then incorporated into an Access database (Microsoft Office 2007) and the description of each incident was read and reviewed. We analysed 968 tracheostomy-related critical incidents reported to the UK National Patient Safety Agency over a 2 year period, identified by key letter searches. We categorized the records to identify recurring themes and then performed root cause analysis where possible. RESULTS. We identified 1,541 incidents from the NPSA incident database originating from hospital wards during the study period having the defined letter sequences. Of these incidents, 968 were associated with tracheostomies; 453 directly affecting patients with the remaining 515 not directly affecting individual patients. In the 453 incidents where patients were directly affected 338 (75%) were associated with some identifiable patient harm of which 83 (18%) were associated with more than temporary harm. In 29 incidents (6%) some intervention was required to maintain life and in 15 cases the incident may have contributed to the patient's death.

(SPV) are reliable predictors of fluid responsiveness in controlled mechanically ventilated patients [1] . PPV and SPV are calculated using an intra-arterial catheter. It is unknown whether an arterial pressure signal obtained with the Nexfin TM system [2] using only a finger cuff can be used to calculate PPV and SPV. OBJECTIVES. To validate PPV and SPV measured with a finger cuff. METHODS. After their arrival on the ICU, sedated and mechanically ventilated patients after Coronary Artery Bypass Graft surgery (CABG) were included. Intra arterial pressure (IAP) was measured using an arterial catheter inserted in the radial artery, and non-invasively, using the finger cuff of the Nexfin TM monitor (BMEYE, The Netherlands). We took the mean value of PPV and SVV in a 1-min time interval before and after the administration of a fluid challenge. Agreement of the PPV and SPV measured by the finger cuff and from the IAP signal were assessed using the method described by Bland and Altman. RESULTS. Nineteen patients were included and twenty-eight volume challenges were analyzed, resulting in 56 simultaneous measurements. PPV and SPV measured by the finger cuff correlated with PPV and SPV from IAP (r 2 = 0.92, P \\ .0001 and r 2 = 0.93, P \\ .0001, respectively), see Figure 1 . The mean bias was -0.95 and -0.22% for PPV and SPV respectively, and limits of agreement were -4.3 and 2.4% for PPV and -2.2 and 1.7% for SPV (see Figure 2 ). There was no correlation between the bias and the mean value of the two measurement methods. The correlation between changes in PPV and SPV measured by the two different methods was r 2 = 0.82 (p \\ .0001) for PPV and r 2 = 0.83 (p \\ .0001) for SPV. CONCLUSIONS. In ventilated ICU patients, PPV and SPV can be reliably calculated using the Nexfin TM monitor. REFERENCE(S). (1) Kramer, A., et al., Chest, 2004. 126(5) .

The transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) technique with integrated pulse contour analysis (PiCCO \u00d2 -system) enables continuous monitoring of cardiac index (CI) after calibration by TPTD [1] . This monitoring technique is applied in patients with lung failure who undergo prone positioning (PP) which has been shown to potentially improve pulmonary gas exchange [2] . OBJECTIVE. We sought to determine the influence of a modified PP (135\u00b0) on the accuracy of pulse contour derived CI (PCCI) without recalibration by TPTD. PATIENTS: After approval by our institutional review board and written informed consent by a legal surrogate we studied 16 critically ill patients (11#, 5$, age 20-71 years) who were mechanically ventilated due to acute lung injury following lung contusions or acute respiratory distress syndrome. METHODS. All patients were prone positioned and had received an extended haemodynamic monitoring (PiCCO \u00d2 , Pulsion Medical Systems AG, Munich, Germany). Before turning from supine position (SP) to PP, CI was measured by TPTD (TPTDCI) and PCCI was calibrated. Ten minutes after positioning, PCCI was read from the monitor and then recalibrated by TPTD. After 8-10 h, PP was ended and measurements were performed analogously to prone positioning. Volume management between the respective time points remained unchanged. Linear regression analysis and Bland-Altman plots were used for statistical analysis. All data are given as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, range in brackets.",

There is also a large interindividual variation in bias. The use of norepinephrine may provoke the error. OBJECTIVES. To compare 5 cardiac output techniques to the reference TTE method, which allows accurate measurement of the aortic flow section and of velocity time integral of aortic pulsed wave Doppler signal to measure CO. METHODS. Monocentric prospective study included patients requiring invasive blood pressure and hemodynamic therapeutic intervention. TTE CO measurement was performed with aortic diameter measured in parasternal long axis view at the the aortic leflets, and velocity time integral measured using five apical view averaged on 5 cardiac cycles. TOD CO was measured only when the PAC insertion was decided. TTE, USCOM \u00d2 , Mostcare \u00d2 and VIGILEO \u00d2 were performed in all patients. Each value was the average of 5 successive cardiac cycles with 3 consecutive measurements. Each patient could have several measures. RESULTS. 24 mechanically ventilated patients (60 \u00b1 20 years; SOFA 8 \u00b1 3.5) were investigated allowing to obtain 252 measurements (117 under norephinephrine). Diagnostics: brain injury (n = 9), sepsis(n = 9) and others (n = 5).1 patient had the 6 methods (9 measurements), 13 patients had 5 techniques (115 measurements), 9 patients had 4 techniques (69 measurements), 6 CONCLUSIONS. All methods correlated more or less with TTE CO, with a slope close to identity, and a low intercept. The best correlation was obtained between Mostcare \u00d2 and TOD. Agreement for almost all methods was large, within an acceptable range. For the pulse contour method, Mostcare is correlated better than Vigileo with TTE CO. The arterial signal has to be accurate as possible and requires a high quality chain for measurement avoiding overdamping or underdamping to allow effective signal digitalization. INTRODUCTION. The lithium indicator dilution technique is attractive in paediatric intensive care because it is non-invasive. However, it requires calibration. The reliability of cardiac output measurement data rests on the reproducibility of the calibration factor (CF).",

A second patient had non-paroxysmal Afib. SVVstd showed abnormally high values ranging between 25 and 35%. Patient was a non-responder to fluid and had a CO ranging between 10 and 12 l/min. NewSVV showed more realistic value of 11% depicting a non-responder range. The third patient had periods of Afib followed by normal sinus rhythm (NSR). SVVstd algorithm had abnormally high SVV values ([ 35%) during the Afib. During NSR, both algorithms correlated well with SVV of 7%. (Fig. 1.) CONCLUSIONS.

It has also been suggested that the quality of postoperative analgesia could decrease delirium incidence and reduce duration of hospital stay in the elderly patients. However, the ideal postoperative analgesia management of elderly surgical patients in intensive care units remains to be determined. Since, continuous epidural analgesia provides the required level of analgesia to support early mobilization and significant reduction in pulmonary and cardiovascular morbidity in the early postoperative period, we postulated that the use of low dose of continuous epidural morphine might improve postoperative analgesia and reduce undesirable side effects in elderly patientsTherefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of morphine administered via epidural patients controlled analgesia and intravenous tramadol + metamizol on postoperative pain control and side effects in elderly patients after major abdominal surgery.",

Although the ideal ITU sedation practice is not known, many units use a protocol-based approach incorporating best practice consensus. The use of daily interruption of sedation infusions can reduce oversedation and is included in our current guidelines. OBJECTIVES. The audit assesses compliance to our current protocols for sedation scoring and adjustment of sedation infusions. Provision of sedation breaks in patients sedated more than 1-day is evaluated. METHODS. Retrospective review of ITU inpatients' daily record charts during June and July 2009 at Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust in two 16-bedded ITU. 184 charts were reviewed. RESULTS. Our guidelines recommend hourly sedation scoring from 0600 h to midnight and 3 hourly scoring from midnight till 0600 h; at 0000, 0300 and 0600 h. 86% of the reviewed charts did not have a recorded hourly score. 81% did not have 3 hourly scores overnight. 75% of the charts contain Ramsay score -2 or -3; 29% of the charts contain Ramsay score 2 or 3. Per protocol, sedation infusion is stopped at Ramsay score -2 or -3 but in 71% of cases this did not occur. A sedation bolus should be given at a score of 2 or 3. 56% did not receive a recorded bolus. Our guidelines advocate restarting a sedation infusion at a lower rate after it has stopped and the patient is less sedated and increasing the rate after a bolus is given. However, correct infusion rate adjustments were only performed in 46% of cases. Often, rates were changed but without first stopping, or administering a drug bolus.",

Review of the current guidance is required to address appropriate frequency of formal scoring, nurse-led compulsory sedation breaks and pharmacokinetic education about the necessity to stop or bolus before infusion rate alterations. INTRODUCTION. Daily interruption of sedation has been shown to decrease length of stay in ICU 1 . Recent national guidance in Scotland 2 promotes DIS as part of a care bundle to decrease ventilator associated pneumonia. A 6 week retrospective first round audit was completed prior to the introduction of DIS and demonstrated 30% of patient hours where sedation could be improved. A second round audit of current practice was therefore undertaken to assess the impact of DIS on sedation levels. Our aim was to identify the frequency of periods where sedation levels were undesirable and investigate any clinical reason behind these. OBJECTIVES. To assess whether DIS would improve sedations levels of our patients already managed with a simple sedation algorithm (SA) aiming at a Ramsay sedation score level 3-4 3 . METHODS. Six months following the introduction of DIS, a second period of 6 weeks was studied retrospectively where the ICU daily charts were examined to look at: demographic data, sedation score, and whether DIS had been successfully carried out. RESULTS. 21 cases were identified: 13 males and 8 females with an average age 61 years and similar illness severity scores to the first group. DIS was carried out on 44 patient days, omitted on 3 days and contraindicated on a further 36. 1,395 patient hours were examined. 419 (30%) were excluded due to contraindications such as refractory hypoxia, drug overdose, and end of life care. The remaining patient hours were compared to the first round group [1,540 patient hours with 308 contraindications (20%)] using the Mann-Whitney test as shown in Fig. 1 .",

Despite a large number of recent publications on delirium and increasing awareness amongst critical care professionals most of the units in our region do not routinely assess for delirium. Without regular assessment most delirium will go unrecognised and thus opportunities to instigate preventative measures and early management will be missed. METHODS. Six patients aged 20-45 years old (4 females) who all sustained brain injury with cerebral oedema alongside other traumatic damage (i.e., fractures, abdominal trauma) are hereby presented. Upon admission to the ICU all patients received large propofol doses (25-30 ml/h of propofol infusion 2%), in an attempt to lower cerebral metabolic demand along with vasopressors to maintain a normal mean arterial pressure. Three to 5 days following admission all patients developed metabolic acidosis (base deficit ranged from -6 to -12 mmol/L), hyperkalemia (potassium concentration ranged from 5.8 to 6.9 mmol/L), evidence of muscle cell degradation (creatine kinase and myoglobin concentrations ranged from 30,000 to 49,000 U/L and from 1,900 to 2,700 lg/L, respectively) and lipaemia (triglyceride concentrations ranged from 4 to 4.4 mmol/L).

Reported prevalence of delirium in critical care varies widely from 20 to 80%. Despite this, delirium remains grossly under-recognised and is often thought to be temporary and of little consequence in critical care. It is however one of the most frequent complications and, after adjusting for age, gender and severity of illness is an independent risk factor for prolonged length of stay and mortality (1) . Current recommendations are for the assessment and diagnosis of delirium using simple validated tools (2) .

Tracheostomy was done in 19.5% patients with a delay of 15 \u00b1 7 days. There were 3 late-onset VAP episodes and the rate of VAP per 1,000 ventilator days was 4.57. The VAP were caused by Candida albicans, Enterobacter aerogenes and Pseudomona aeruginosa. The length of ICU stay was 17.6 days. Mortality was 26% (only one patient with VAP). The rate of compliance with ventilator care bundle was 100%. The rate of VAP per 1,000 ventilator days after implementation of the bundle decreased significantly (Table 1) . There is currently no consensus on the diagnostic criteria for ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) which has led to significant variation in the reported incidence (9-28%) 1 . ICUs need a reliable and accurate diagnostic system so that the efficacy of measures to reduce the incidence of VAP can be assessed, and if VAP is to be considered as a quality indicator of performance. OBJECTIVE. To establish a process to diagnose VAP that can be used for continuous surveillance and to assess the effect of new therapeutic interventions.",

            "text": "METHOD. Potential diagnoses of VAP were identified prospectively by a senior intensive care doctor and clinical data was collected to calculate a modified clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) 2 . Each case was subsequently reviewed at a multidisciplinary team (MDT) review forum with intensive care and microbiology clinicians. The case details, modified CPIS and semiquantitative microbiological culture results were used to reach a consensus view on the diagnosis. A pilot audit performed over a 6 week period in 2009, gave a VAP incidence of 5% (6 VAPs; 118 ventilated patients; 483 ventilator days) . A change to our ventilator care bundle was subsequently instigated, with the addition of chlorhexidine paste to daily mouth care before repeat surveillance. RESULT: 366 patients were admitted to the critical care unit over 112 days. 199 patients were ventilated during a total 759 ventilator days. 12 patient episodes were identified as potential VAP and discussed at the MDT forum. 3 cases were diagnosed as VAP (incidence 1.5%) and 1 patient diagnosed as tube associated pneumonia. The other cases were excluded either due to clinical circumstances (n = 5) or absence of positive microbiology (n = 3). CONCLUSION. We have developed a process for identifying and diagnosing VAP within our critical care unit that continues to be used for ongoing surveillance. Collaboration between the intensive care team and the microbiology department, along with a MDT forum, has been fundamental to this process. Our data highlights the difficulty in diagnosing VAP and the need for multidisciplinary expertise. Of the 12 patient episodes prospectively identified as potential VAP, 9 were deemed not to be VAP when clinical data and results were available for review at the MDT forum. The reduction of VAP incidence between the pilot study and subsequent screening suggests benefit from the introduction of oral chlorhexidine, however we recognise other contributing factors. Controversially, ICUs in the UK are increasingly being asked to provide data on VAP incidence as a quality indicator. We believe that we have a process that is robust and allows us to accurately monitor the incidence of VAP. INTRODUCTION. Bacterial biofilm within the internal surface of the endotracheal tube (ETT) may contribute to ventilator-associated pneumonia. The gene expression pattern of those bacteria, embedded within biofilm matrix, greatly differs from their planktonic counterpart and allows survival benefits and increased virulence.",

Early oscillation also appears to reduce the need for other adjunctive therapies. Further studies of early HFO strategy are warranted. INTRODUCTION. Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is a novel method for patient triggering of pressure support. Instead of relying on conventional pressure or flow triggering, the peak diaphragmatic EMG signal (Edi) is used to precisely synchronise patient demand with ventilatory assist. Although, the physiology and science underpinning NAVA has been described, less is known about its clinical application and efficacy (1) . In particular, clinical superiority over conventional pressure support has not been established.",

In this study we show that neurally adjusted ventilatory assist can be safely and effectively be introduced into a 'non-expert' intensive care unit.

Arterial blood gases, respiratory rate, and discomfort were assessed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Discomfort was assessed by asking patients to rate their discomfort with the used device by using a numerical scale from 0 (no discomfort) to 10 (maximum imaginable discomfort). Discomfort symptoms were also assessed for the dryness of the delivered oxygen (dryness of the mouth, throat, nose, difficulty to swallow and throat pain). Incidence of desaturations and interface displacement was also assessed. OBJECTIVES.

We extracted patients with acute respiratory failure requiring either invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation in 32 Spanish ICUs during the 3-month period of the validation of the Sabadell Score (1). We recorded demographic parameters and treatments received during the ICU stay. Patients were followed until hospital discharge or death. RESULTS. We analyzed 4,132 patients, of whom 1,602 (39%) received only invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and 529 (13%) received NIV. NIV succeeded in 50% of patients, but the other 50% required intubation. NIV failure was more common in neurologic (70%) and post operatory (13%) and less frequent in coronary patients (11%). Mortality was lower than predicted in NIV patients (22 vs. 33%) and similar to predicted in IMV patients (27 vs. 29%). Mortality was lower than predicted in patients in whom NIV was successful (12 vs. 28%) and (similar or slightly lower than to predicted) in those in whom NIV failed (32 vs. 38%). CONCLUSIONS. Routine use of NIV seems to confer a benefit, even when it fails and intubation is needed. REFERENCE(S Tables 1 and 2 shows the parameters on respiratory muscles. INTRODUCTION.

During critical illness alterations in blood flow are thought to predispose to organ dysfunction and hemodynamic therapy is often targeted at maintaining organ perfusion.

Anemia is a common adverse effect of oncologic diseases as is the therapeutic options required for their treatment. However, as blood transfusions are directed at correcting for anemia and intrinsic hypoxic conditions, little evidence exists claiming that blood transfusions have successfully resolved anemic challenges as storage can significantly deteriorate RBC function. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of RBC transfusions on sublingual microcirculatory perfusion and tissue oxygenation in anemic oncology patients. METHODS. Eight consecutive ambulatory patients scheduled to receive 3 packed RBC transfusion bags were selected for this study. Baseline sublingual microcirculation functional capillary density (FCD) was measured using sidestream dark-field (SDF) imaging prior to and after 30 min of the completion of the last infused blood bag. Sublingual mucosal oxygen saturation (StO 2 ) was measured at the same anatomical location and time points using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). RESULTS. Figures 1 and 2 Capillary refill time (CRT) is a generally accepted method of assessing the circulatory status of a patient. We have previously showed that using 4.5 s as the upper limit of normality in critically ill patients could discriminate patients with a more unfavourable outcome 1 . However, this upper limit of normality was defined based on variation of CRT in an adult healthy population 2 . The best CRT in critically ill patients, therefore, should still be redefined. OBJECTIVES. We aimed to define the best CRT as predictor of organic and metabolic dysfunction in an intensive care unit (ICU) population. METHODS. Capillary refill time was measured by applying firm pressure to the distal phalanx of the index finger for 15 s, and a chronometer recorded the time of returning to normal colour. We performed receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to detect the best CRT consistent with severe organ and metabolic dysfunction, as evaluated by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) [11 and acidosis (lactate [2 mmol/L and BE\\ -3 mEq/ L), respectively. In addition, we performed logistic regression analysis using the cutoff CRT as binary to investigate its estimated odds ratio (Exp(B)).",

We found that 5.5 s is the best time to define prolonged CRT in critically ill patients, and that using this CRT cutoff value could discriminate patients with a more severe organ and metabolic dysfunction. 1 INTRODUCTION. Impairment of microcirculation in acute situations is associated with organ failure and depends on macrocirculation but also on specific factors (1) . Micro-perfusion, assessed by tissue hemoglobin saturation (StO 2 measurement) or micro-blood flow (laser Doppler, LD) are easy to use and non invasive methods. The obtained data could be an end point in critical care resuscitation or optimization. OBJECTIVES. To assess the impact on microcirculation of cardiovascular (CV) support on the basis of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cardiac output (CO), to evaluate when microcirculatory parameters improved or not the modifications observed in MAP and CO. METHODS. Observational study: measure of CO, MAP, SVCO 2 , and lactate, thenar NIRS (InSpectra 650; Hutchinson Technology) baseline StO 2 , with performance of an arterial occlusion test (3 mn, 300 mmHg) so calculate occlusion-OS and reperfusion slopes-RS (1). Similarly, forearm skin blood flow velocity (LD, BLF21D, Transonic Systems) basal LD, and post-ischemic peak velocity LDmax) (1) were measured. Data were collected before and after CV optimization (fluid loading, vasoactive or inotropic drugs). Patients were defined: macrocirculatory responders (R) when CO increased more than 10% versus nonresponders (NR); microcirculatory responders (RS+) when RS increased more than 10% versus nonresponders (RS-). Statistical analysis: nonparametric tests (Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney test). RESULTS. 32 patients (86% in shock) were studied. 20 had sepsis (63%), 5 hemorrhage (16%), 4 pulmonary oedema (12%), or other (9%). 50 therapeutic optimization challenges were performed:40 fluid challenges (500 ml, 0.9% NaCl), 4 dobutamine 5c/kg/min, 3 nitrates, 1 diuretic, 1 electric shock and an increase in dosage of norepinephrine. In R group (n=28, 56%), CO was increased associated with MAP (p \\ .0001), SVCO 2 (p = .001) and decreased lactate (p = .02).",

In the NR group, both the macro or the microcirculation did not change. Since no microcirculatory differences between R and NR were observed, patients with good or poor microcirculation could not be detected. The study based on microcirculatory responses showed 50% of responders (RS+). In this group, baseline StO 2 (p = .002), basal LD (p = .04) and LDmax (p = .01) increased in a large amount in association with an improved CO and MAP (p = .0076 and p = .0008). In the RS-group, CO and MAP were also improved (p = .0002 and p = .006). CONCLUSIONS. Improvement of macrocirculatory parameters can improve microcirculation but not in all patients. Improvement in microcirculation may also be a target, regardless the effects on macrocirculatory parameters. This concept has to be tested prospectively. INTRODUCTION.

INTRODUCTION. Approximately 1% of patients require temporary circulatory support due to cardiogenic shock following cardiac surgery. These patients are at risk of a mismatch between oxygen delivery and demand and carry a substantial mortality and morbidity risk. Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO 2 ) is the still the ''gold standard'' for the determination of the ratio between systemic oxygen delivery and consumption (DO 2 /VO 2 ratio) in cardiac surgery patients. A nonivasive technique is thought to be cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy determining cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO 2 ).",

This three-center, double blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial is ongoing (estimated enrollment = 350 patients) and aims to asses the efficacy of combined vasopressin and epinephrine during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and of steroid administration during and after CPR. Post-arrest neurological recovery was defined as Glasgow Coma Scale Score[9 documented at least once by 2 study-independent physicians in patients not receiving sedation for at least 24 h. We identified a total of 65 patients who were subjected to at least one post-arrest assessment of their neurological status. Subsequently, we used backward stepwise logistic regression, and assessed the following potential predictors: cause of cardiac arrest (cardiac vs. non-cardiac); area of cardiac arrest occurrence (monitored vs. non-monitored); use of therapeutic hypothermia; number of CPR cycles; mean arterial pressure and serum lactate at 15 min following resuscitation; and patient group allocation. RESULTS. The sole independent predictor of post-arrest neurological recovery was the occurrence of the cardiac arrest in an area of monitored patient care (i.e., intensive or coronary care unit, and operating or emergency room): odds ratio: 3.83, 95% confidence interval = 1.26-11.63; P = 0.018. The sole independent predictor of survival to hospital discharge with neurological recovery was the serum lactate concentration at 15 min after resuscitation: odds ratio: 1.22; 95% confidence interval = 1.02-1.46. CONCLUSIONS. The results of this preliminary analysis suggest that post-arrest neurological recovery seems to depend more on the use of pre-arrest patient monitoring rather than the employed CPR protocol. Also, patients with lower, early post-arrest serum lactate concentration seem to have a better chance of surviving to hospital discharge without concurrent, severe neurological deficits.

Among 380 patients, the age (mean \u00b1 SD) was 65 \u00b1 10.8 years and more frequently male (65.3%). 34.7% were angioplasty. The radial approach was used in 203 patients (53.4%; 64.8% with 5F arterial sheaths and 35.2% with 6F), and the femoral approach in 177 patients (46.6%). There was no difference in the baseline characteristics of the patients. The time required for the procedure and the fluoroscopy time were longer in the radial group (p = 0.06). A cross over was more often necessary in the radial group (10 patients, 2.6%) due to radial artery spasm, deviousness, loop, unstable catheter or artery dissection. Only one patient required cross over from femoral to radial approach (0.26%) due to serious deviousness in iliac artery. The intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and Rotablator always were done by femoral approach. The incidence of complications was higher in the femoral approach group (20.9 vs. 12.8%, p = 0.015). In the radial approach group, the most important complication was wrist haematoma (0% radial artery occlusion checked with Allen test), however the femoral approach complications were: inguinal haematomas (13.5%), big haematomas required blood transfusions (2.8%), femoral artery pseudoaneurysms (2.8%), arteriovenous fistulas (0.6%), retroperitoneal haemorrhages (0.6%), strokes (0.6%).

In order to determine the efficacy of antibiotic impregnated CVCs in our clinic we evaluated retrospectively the data of the cultures of CVCs and blood obtained from patients during their stay at ICU within the last 2 years (January 2008 till August 2009). CONCLUSIONS. Surprisingly, there was no difference in the incidence of the CVC and bloodstream infections in both groups. We can conclude that the strategy of using MRimpregnated CVCs did not reduce the incidence of catheter related BSI. Although earlier studies have indicated that MR-impregnated CVCs are cost saving [3] , our data add further proof to the suggestion that the cost effectiveness of these catheters is at least uncertain. RESULTS. From all patients, 27 (42.1%) developed infection from any reason during the ICU stay. 8 patients developed CRBSI, 12.5% of the total patient number and 29.62% of the patients who developed any infection. We recorded 9 episodes of bacteremia due to CVC during 735 days of CVC placement stay, 12.24% while the standard limit is four episodes of CRBSI per 1,000 days CVC placement. During the year 2009, we chanced our practice in order to avoid as risk factors as we can, using only antimicrobial/antiseptic impregnated catheters, improving our hand hygiene and aseptic technique, using only chlorhexidine and semipermeable polyurethane dressings and making catheter replacement at scheduled time intervals as a method to reduce CRBSI. The previous year the recorded CRBSI incidence was 18.7% respectively.",

Our survey proves that with strict adherence to guidelines and following infection control protocols diligently the risk of CR-BSI from all line types can be reduced. CONCLUSION. This study implies that the scale of CRBSI may be higher than is currently recognised and that the blood culture positivity rate for CRBSI is 79%(152/192). As concurrent antibiotic therapy may reduce blood culture and CVC tip positivity, the blood culture rate of 79% suggests that CRBSI has an inherently high blood culture positivity rate despite concurrent antimicrobial therapy.

The incidence and mortality of bacterial infections significantly increase with age. Aging is associated with an impaired immune response, which causes not only an increased susceptibility for infections, but also a poor inflammatory response against them. Procalcitonin (PCT) is an inflammatory biomarker used as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in bacterial infections. There is no data regarding the diagnostic yield of PCT in elderly patient populations. In this study we sought to identify the relationship between age and the magnitude of PCT response in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS. Patients, who were admitted to ICU between January 2008 and December 2009, with the diagnoses of severe sepsis, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (COPDE) were included into the study. Patients' demographics, APACHE-2 scores, admission PCT values, intensive care and hospital outcomes were extracted from a database of prospectively collected clinical data. RESULTS. We studied a total of 189 admissions (92 female/97 male, mean age \u00b1 standart deviation 60.6 \u00b1 18.7 years). Median (interquartile range-IQR) APACHE 2 score was 23 (18-31); the ICU and hospital mortalities were 32.8 and 41.8%, respectively. Median (IQR) admission PCT levels were 7.9 (1.7-24.7) ng/ml in patients with severe sepsis (n = 91), 0.6 (0.2-3.4) ng/ml in patients with pneumonia (n = 60) and 0.2 (0.1-0.3) ng/ml in patients with COPDE (n = 38). There was a negative correlation between age and PCT levels (Spearman correlation coefficient: r = -0.21, p = 0.004); the median (IQR) PCT levels were 3.8 (0.4-22.5) ng/ml in patients\\60 years-old and 1.1 (0.2-6.6) ng/ ml in patients C60 years-old (p = 0.005). In subgroup analyses it was found that the inverse correlation between age and PCT levels mainly arised from patients with severe sepsis (r = -0.23, OBJECTIVES. We intend to define the role of PCT in the initial evaluation of the patient with a suspected sepsis admitted to the ICU.",

The Ethics Committee of the centre has approved this study. We included all patients admitted to our Unit with diagnosis of sepsis since June-2009. We measured PCT (lgr/mL) at admission and at the second and third day of stay beside the routine screening for the source of infection. Then we analyzed the relation of PCT with culture results. Chi-square and ANOVA have been used for the analysis. (Fig. 1 ). PCT at admission showed an Auc of 0.53 (0.38-0.69) for discriminating bacterial infection. We detected higher mortality in those patients with bacterial infections and sustained high levels of PCT the third day ( Fig. 2) (p \\ 0.05). Figure 1, 2 CONCLUSIONS. In the initial approach to the septic patient, PCT does not seem in our experience useful as an aid in decision-making but an early decrement of serum levels can be a marker for response and for a better outcome of patients with bacterial infections.",

C-reactive protein (CRP, mg/dL), procalcitonin (PCT, ng/ mL), and Interleukin-6 (IL-6, pg/mL) were measured after patient's discharge on daily stored sera. An independent overall clinical evaluation after patient's discharge, aware of the clinical course but blinded against biomarker's measurement, an ''a posteriori'' ACCP-SCCM classification, was chosen as reference standard for all comparisons.

PCT concentrations [0.5 lg/L were regarded as positive. CRP was measured by immunoturbidimetric analysis using the Roche Modular P. A positive blood culture was regarded as infection, with exclusion of the coagulase negative Staphylococcus aureus since this organism doesn't induce PCT expression. Every CRP request of the ICU during 1 month was accompanied by a PCT, WBC, and eosinophil count. CONCLUSIONS. PCT at randomly measured at the ICU doesn't seem to contribute to an earlier diagnosis of sepsis. PCT measurement seems to be useful only when sepsis is suspected and a blood culture request has been summoned. However, its non-specificity for infection, as demonstrated by the high number of PCT-positive, no blood-culture requested patients (concerning mostly post-cardiac arrest and post-heart surgery patients), makes it difficult to apply routinely. The recently displayed effort of various companies to market PCT in combination with CD64 and neopterin (other potential markers of infection) supports the conclusion that not one marker by itself can substitute the golden standard of blood culture today.

In this prospective observational study we sought to investigate the role of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients admitted to the ICU with suspected 2009 H1N1 infection.",

Maximal oxidative capacities (Vmax) and complexes I, II and IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain were determined using glutamate-malate (Vmax) and succinate (Vsucc) as substrates in the GC permeabilized fibers and freshly harvested liver and lungs isolated mitochondria. Tissue superoxide anion production was assessed with dihydroethidium (DHE) in thin sections of frozen GC. Data are expressed as mean\u00b1SEM and analyzed with ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-hoc test; a p value\\0.05 was considered significant. Esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction is associated with frequent postoperative complications due to a (surgery induced) systemic stress response, provoked by the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines. In elective postoperative esophagectomy patients, we previously showed that levels of serum CRP are associated with the occurrence of postoperative complications and reduced survival. Plasma NGAL (pNGAL) and urine NGAL (uNGAL) are early predictors of acute kidney injury, however sepsis/sirs seems to accelerate their production even in the absence of AKI. OBJECTIVES. We examined the role of pNGAL and uNGAL as early indicators of postoperative complications at the ICU in patients undergoing elective esophagectomy surgery METHODS. In a prospective follow-up cohort study, data of a total of 49 patients admitted to the ICU following elective esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction were collected in the period from September 2007 to April 2008. Patients who developed AKI at the ICU were not included in this study.

Medizinische Klinik, M\u00fcnchen, Germany, 2 Technical University of Munich, Transplantationszentrum M\u00fcnchen rechts der Isar, Chirurgische Klinik, M\u00fcnchen, Germany INTRODUCTION. The shortage of donor organs in the Eurotransplant region results in late allocation at a time when liver disease is already very advanced. The severe condition of patients at that stage negatively affects outcomes of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). To support decision-making in these situations, clinical data are urgently needed. OBJECTIVES. To evaluate outcomes of liver transplantation (OLT) in ICU-patients with multi-organ failure due to advanced Acute on Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF). METHODS. In our centre, patients on the waiting list for OLT are not automatically excluded from the procedure, if their condition deteriorates to multi-organ failure. A consensus of the team in each individual case is based on criteria such as the previously manifested will of the patient, exclusion of current infection, absence of neurologic damage or other organ damage expected to impair the possibility of rehabilitation. We retrospectively analyzed a database comprising data from evaluation for the waiting list of all patients transplanted in our center since implementation of the MELD-score for allocation. Only cirrhotic patients treated on our intensive care unit before transplantation were included. Patients treated on the ICU before retransplant for primary graft failure were excluded from analysis. Data are presented as median (25 th -75th percentile). Wilcoxon or Mann-Whitney U tests were used for comparisons of paired and unpaired data, respectively. RESULTS. From January 2007 until September 2009 15 patients (7 m, 7f; age 58 (52-65) years) fulfilled inclusion criteria. Cirrhosis was due to alcohol (n = 7), HCV (n = 3), alcohol+HCV (n = 2), alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (n = 1), budd-chiari-syndrome (n = 1) or cryptogenic (n = 1). Upon ICU admission ICU, APACHE II scores were 26 (22-31), SOFA scores 11 (8-14); MELD 25 (21-34). After 14 (3-21) days on the ICU, directly before transplantation, SOFA scores had deteriorated in all patients to 18 (17-21) and MELD scores to 35 (25-38). 7 patients had renal replacement therapy and 4 patients were on single-pass albumin dialysis. The 30-day-mortality was 27%, hospital mortality 47% and 1-year mortality 60%. In hospital survivors, surprisingly, SOFA scores (14 (11-16) vs. 8 (8-11); p = 0.029) and INR (3.1 (2.5-3.5) vs. 1.9 (1.3-2.1); p = 0.006) upon admission to the ICU were significantly higher than in non-survivors. There were no significant differences in age, gender, MELD scores or use of extracorporeal treatment in survivors vs. non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS. Liver transplantation in selected cirrhotic ICU-patients with multi-organ failure is not medically futile. Outcome, however, is much worse than usually considered acceptable. OBJECTIVES. This work tries to study the clinical profile and the results with the immediate postoperative outcome of patients suffered from pancreas-kidney transplantation (PKT) and only pancreas transplantation (PT) admitted in our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) setting. METHODS. Prospective study during 4 years (from 2006 to 2009). We recorded epidemiological, demographical and clinical data, surgical and postsurgical complications, therapy, morbidity and mortality rate, length of stay in ICU, organs survival, etc. The data were expressed in mean\u00b1typical deviation, median and percentages. RESULTS. We recorded 47 patients. Table 1 expresses some of the data. The mean age was 41.8 \u00b1 7.7 years old male 74.5%. PKT from unic deceased donor: 83%. PT: 17%. The mean ischemia time was 12.4 \u00b1 2.4 h for the kidney and 10.27 \u00b1 3.4 for the pancreas. The most frequent surgical complications were bleeding (4.3%), technical difficulties (12.8%) and anesthetic complications (4.3%). Postoperative immunosuppression consists in methyl-prednisolone, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and thymoglobulin (as our protocol recommends) and was administered to the 100% of the patients. Prophylactic antibiotic and antiviral therapy (ampicillin, ceftriaxone, fluconazole and gancyclovir) was given to almost the 95% of the patients. Table 2 expresses the blood test results. The mean insulin requirements per day during the stay in ICU was 0 (0-8.5) IU. Table 3 represents the complications in the ICU. The first leading cause of reoperation was vascular thrombosis (50%) followed by intraabdominal bleeding (20%). CONCLUSION. The clinical profile of this patient in our setting is a 42 years old man, with high blood pressure, retinopathy, dialysis, pancreas-kidney transplant recipient, with unic decesed-donor. He needs no insulin or minimal requirements. The principal complication is pancreatic vascular thrombosis that frecuently leads to removal of the graft. (1) . In a clinical practice, a specific marker to evaluate and predict ischemic-reperfusion injury in liver transplantation (OLT) is not available. Poor organ perfusion and high PCT levels appeared to predict early graft failure only in the cardiac donor (2) .",

Professionalism is herein mainly learned 'on the job' from role models. Formal teaching courses and sessions addressing professionalism aspects were nevertheless valued, and learning from own and others' mistakes was considered especially useful. Selfreflection as a starting point for learning professionalism was stressed. The latter can e.g. be stimulated by means of assessment, structured feedback and use of portfolios, for which guidelines are now being developed within the CoBaTrICE project. Introduction: During the past decades there has been an increase in mass casualty events with changing geopolitical and climate situations. In a mass casualty event comprehensive care for the individual is expected [4] . To meet these obligations further education in disaster medicine seems obligate [1] . Therefore the German Home Department responsible for mass casualties passed a concept for student education in disaster medicine [2] .",

Some were targeted at the beginner seeking a basic understanding of echo whilst others were aimed at the enthusiast preparing for examinations.

Two online surveys were conducted in February 2010, with invitations to participate via e-mail. The survey population included all anaesthesia and intensive care medicine consultants in the local tertiary neurosciences centre and all trainees for these specialties in the Northern Ireland Deanery. First year trainees were excluded. RESULTS. The response rate was 61% for consultants and 50% for trainees. In total, 35 consultants responded with over 50% having no experience of MRI at consultant level, even though 70% worked in areas where MRI skills could be required. 54 trainees completed the survey, with 70% having experience of MRI in the elective setting, all of whom had been directly supervised by a consultant. 65% of trainees had experience of critical care transfers for MRI, but this was in an unsupervised capacity more than 50% of the time. Despite this, 44% of trainees did not feel competent to work in MRI unsupervised. Web based learning was found to be a poorly utilised MRI training tool, particularly among consultants.",

Following the 1999 report: ''To err is human. Building a safer health system'', by the Institute of Medicine, which had a great impact on the media, ''patient safety'' is included as an strategic line in most health systems. Training in patient safety is essential to implement safety culture and as a result improve it. For that reason we developed a training program (3 courses) in 2009 for 15 physicians and 30 nurses from our ICU. OBJETIVE. Patient safety training program assessment. METHODS. We designed a 17 h course (70% practical), using simulated scenarios common in ICU clinical practice. We pointed out the relevance of human factors such as teamwork and communication, and its leading role in the genesis of error. We discussed a ''sentinel case'', using the root-cause analysis method, and analysed an ICU process through failure mode and effects technique. Adverse events reported to the Department website were reviewed. Participants and instructors discussed specific aspects about insertion of central venous catheter, prevention of nosocomial infection and improvement of security in the different groups of ICU patients, highlighting the need for fidelity to the established protocols for this purpose. Finally, participants completed a survey that assessed various aspects in a score from 1 to 5. Results indicated the most and least interesting aspects and suggestions for improvement were included. RESULTS. 45 assessment surveys were analysed. Participation rate was 100%. Overall results: appropriate and clear targets, accomplished goals and utility (4.4) , appropriate content objectives and organization (4.3) , time invested in development activity and oral presentations (4.1), faculty competence (4.6) , interest and faculty adaptability to the group needs (4.7), degree of satisfaction and practices (4.5) . Most interesting comments: practice of root-cause analysis (33.3%), continued participation and motivation (25.7%), practices with HPS and group discussions (22.2%), importance of human factors (20%), theory and practice good balance (15.6%). Least interesting comments: too condensed contents (13.3%), few scenarios (6.7%)Suggestions: do it again(33.3%), enhance preventive medicine sessions (15.6%), increase course duration (13.3%). CONCLUSIONS. Overall assessment was positive. Adaptability and competence of teaching staff have been the most valued aspects; too condensed contents and oral presentations were the least valued. Practice of root-cause analysis ease of participation, ongoing motivation, HPS scenarios and group discussions are the most appreciated activities. Final Comment: good acceptance has encouraged us to continue in 2010 to complete participation of all interested professionals. INTRODUCTION.

Endotracheal intubation is a routine procedure to protect the airway in critical care, that is performed by a wide variety of clinicians from different specialities with different levels of experience in airway management. Serious complications can result from misplacement of an endotracheal tube (ETT) in a main stem bronchus. A widely recommended method for the prevention of this complication is bilateral auscultation of the lungs; but this method frequently provides only inconclusive results (1) . Other routinely used tests to verify correct endotracheal tube placement include observation of symmetric chest movements, and inserting the ETT to a specific depth, but it remains unclear which of these tests detects endobronchial intubation best.",

Our results suggest that the hierarchy of the methods used to assess the correct ETT insertion depth should be changed and that clinicians should rely more on depth of ETT insertion than on auscultation. This is especially true for physicians with less experience in airway management and in situations where auscultation is difficult or impossible. Min USA) , uses a new probe measuring hemoglobin saturation at a lesser depth (15 vs. 25 mm before), with more data output (1value/2 s vs. 1value/3.5 s). The new device contains automated software to compute parameters such as occlusion and reperfusion slopes of StO 2 obtained during and after a vascular occlusion test (VOT). OBJECTIVES. To compare NIRS parameters obtained with the 2 devices used simultaneously in healthy volunteers and critical care patients to test if the new device gave similar results than the older one. METHODS. Micro-oxygenation parameters were collected simultaneously with the 2 different NIRS models, one on each thenar eminence, before (baseline) and during a 3 min upper arm (brachial artery) VOT in 25 patients (15 septic shock (G1), 10 trauma (G2)), compared to 21 healthy volunteers (HV)(G3). NIRS probes were then shifted to the contra lateral thenar eminence and a second VOT was performed. StO 2 occlusion and reperfusion slopes from both devices were calculated in all groups by the same software, using linear adjustment (R 2 C 0.90 to be valid); p \\ 0.05 was considered significant. Following parameters were collected in patients: SAPS II and SOFA scores, macrohemodynamic (heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac output (CO) and SvO 2 (mixed venous O 2 saturation) or ScVO 2 ), and metabolic parameters (pH, Base Excess, and lactate). RESULTS. Median \u00b1 IQR. Patients (G1and G2) did not differ for macrohemodynamic or metabolic data, except MAP (74 (67-86)mmHg vs. 92 (78-102)mmHg; p = 0.05). Baseline NIRS StO 2 values were similar for both groups and for both devices, but were lower than in HV. During VOT, reperfusion slopes were also lower in patients than in HV regardless the device used. The minimum StO 2 during VOT, occlusion and reperfusion slopes were significantly different between the 2 devices: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.18, 0.16 and 0.26, respectively, and Bland and Altman poor agreement and large bias. CONCLUSIONS. Data obtained with Model 650 largely differ from those obtained with Model 325, regardless of the studied population for both StO 2 baseline and slopes. These differences appeared more pronounced in HV than in patients. Such differences may result from muscle depth, number of data output allowing to more precise linear adjustment, or the minimum value reached during occlusion. It becomes hazardous to compare data obtained with these 2 devices either in HV or in critically ill patients. CRRT is used increasingly for the management of acute renal failure in critically ill patients. One major problem with CRRT is coagulation of the filters, leading to decreased efficacy and increased costs. Regional anticoagulation with citrate is an effective and established form of anticoagulation during CRRT in critically ill patients (1, 2) . OBJECTIVES. The aim of this study was to investigate the filter life span during regional anticoagulation with citrate and regarding cost effectiveness. METHODS. This observational, retrospective study was performed in a mixed surgical and trauma ICU in a university hospital. Clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Citrate CRRT was performed using commercially available equipment and fluid solutions (Multifiltrate \u00d2 with integrated CiCa \u00d2 -system; Fresenius Medical Care; Germany). To maintain stable metabolic and hemodynamic conditions we used an internal standard protocol for citrate CRRT. Reimbursement for CRRT is calculated on procedure related rates (according to German DRG). Data are shown as mean or median and standard deviation. RESULTS. f50 patients treated with citrate CRRT from April 2008 through December 2009 were evaluated ( Table 1 ). The mean circuit lifetime of CRRT for all Patients was 49\u00b124 h (Fig. 1) . Mean daily costs per patient were calculated as 264 EUR and mean benefit for CRRT as 3095 EUR (Table 2) . 1 Commercially available interstitial glucose sensors have already been evaluated for this purpose with promising results. 2 However, because of the range of medications administered in the ICU, potential interference with sensor performance must be characterized. To minimize the undesired offset caused by these medications, an interference rejection membrane (IRM) was uniquely developed for a new subcutaneous glucose sensor for in-hospital monitoring. The novel IRM was studied within the ICU setting to gain a realistic picture of its performance in clinical use.",

Airway management has progressed dramatically in the last 10 years but the most significant advance has been video laryngoscopy. Several devices have been introduced since, the most important currently available are the GlideScope \u00d2 , C-MAC \u00d2 , McGrath \u00d2 , Pentax Airway Scope \u00d2 , Airtraq \u00d2 , among others. A common practice has been to abandon direct laryngoscope intubation (DLI) after 3 attempts and move onto advance airway devices such as video laryngoscopy which is becoming the first choice when available. Although DLI is successful in the majority of patients, poor glottic exposure is more likely to require prolonged or multiple intubations attempts and therefore be associated with complications such as oxygen desaturation or airway and dental injuries. In the intensive care environment an airway should always be considered a difficult airway due to scarce time to perform assessment, to make decisions and to act. Should the use of video laryngoscopy be implemented as a routine for airway management in a critical care setting ?",

Hypovolemia is a common complication in many clinical scenarios and its detection is considered of prime importance. In previous clinical studies, tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2 ) measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been explored for this purpose; however, results are disappointing. It has been suggested that the sensitivity of NIRS for detection of hypovolemia might be improved when NIRS is applied in combination with a vascular occlusion test (VOT). NIRS in combination with a VOT, consisting of a 3-min period of arterial occlusion followed by reperfusion, allows quantification of muscle deoxygenation during ischemia (StO 2 downslope; a measure of muscle oxygen consumption rate) and muscle reoxygenation after ischemia (StO 2 upslope; a measure of microvascular reperfusion rate).",

Subsequently, the mean \u00b1 SD gray scale intensity in a sliding 5 9 5 pixel window was calculated and the SDvalue was assigned to the window center pixel, creating an SDF contrast image. This is a simple and rapid algorithm for vessel wall detection as a pixel window at a tissue-vessel junction will have a high SD-value due to the presence of both light tissue cells and dark red blood cells. CONCLUSIONS. Here, we introduce and validate a rapid automated method for quantification of microvascular density in SDF images. As this algorithm detects vessel walls rather than vessel lumen, smaller and larger vessels have similar contribution to the microvascular density assessment. A limitation, however, is that vessel diameters cannot be detected with this algorithm. The preliminary results confirm the proof of concept of the SDF image contrast analysis software, however, further research is required for its optimization. The criteria believed to be necessary for the implementation of HCS in practice were that his name would be written{106(66)}, the document dated{96(60)} and signed{93(58)}. Physicians in private practice wanted date(p = .04) and signature(p = .004) more often than in institution. 96(60) physicians thought that the patient must be competent at the designation' time of HCS, especially those who possess advances directives(p = .003) and a HCS(p = .04) themselves. 58(36) thought the HCS should know about the patient's wishes regarding treatment and care objectives.",

Assessment of satisfaction with the quality of care provided to patients hospitalized in intensive care units, in most cases, is transferred to the relatives of the same, given the context of the patient himself unable to speak. The diagnosis of the needs of families of critically ill patients has been the subject of several studies. Aiming to assess the needs of relatives of patients admitted to the PICU (Polivalent Intensive Care Unit), we conducted studies in particular through an adapted version of the questionnaire CCFNI (Critical Care Family Needs Inventory) developed from the adaptation made by Johnson and col.

Facing the stressful situation, the family may feel disorganized, helpless and with difficulties to mobilize themselves, enabling the rise of different types of needs.

A total of 24 relatives, representing 20 patients thought to be at the end of life, were interviewed. Half the patients represented were female, with diagnoses including infection, hypoxic brain injury, malignancy and liver failure. The participants were aged 28-80 and included a range of ethnic groups and religious affiliations. Non-participant observations of care took place for 15 and clinical note review for 16 of these patients. Data from the interviews with staff describe that an existing withdrawal of treatment document was working well but could be developed further along with suggestions for amendments. The interviews with relatives, observations and review of clinical notes show 4 key themes: communication, decision-making, patient and family needs, and symptoms and their management. Through discussion at ITU End of Life Group meetings, a consensus was reached to pilot a complex intervention comprising an amended withdrawal document; a psychosocial assessment; education and awareness-raising; palliative care team input and increased psychosocial support. The psychosocial assessment document was deemed valuable to all patients and was rolled out for all patients admitted to ITU. Initial evaluation shows greater staff awareness. Documentation of end of life issues and the collaborative research process has improved communication between ITU and palliative care staff. INTRODUCTION. Consumer-centric healthcare is a key component of NHS policy. When patients are critically ill, family members act as surrogates. Family members alone may inform patients of events that occurred, and provide physical, emotional and socioeconomic support during rehabilitation. Thus, high family satisfaction (FS) is important. The FS-ICU instrument was developed in Canada to quantify family satisfaction 1 and benchmark Intensive Care Units (ICUs). We have piloted and validated previously an adaptation of the FS-ICU such that its language was appropriate for the UK 2 . To date, no intervention has demonstrated improvement in the FS-ICU for a critical care unit. We hypothesise that provider-driven interventions fail to recognise central issues. Co-production is a framework that enables creation of parity between providers and consumers by validating both individual worth and specialised knowledge 3 . There are no published data on the use of co-production in intensive care. We undertook to co-produce interventions targeted to improve family satisfaction. The FS-ICU instrument will be used as an objective measure of their efficacy.",

Figures from the SOAP study for non specialist centres do not appear to reflect the experience of specialist oncology centres. Historically there has been a negative perception of the prognosis for patients with haematological malignancies requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU).

Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity for both women and men. Although men are affected in greater numbers, women have been shown to have worse outcomes and higher mortality. OBJECTIVES. This study aims to examine gender differences in risk factors, angiographic severity, treatment and in-hospital mortality after STEMI. METHODS. In this retrospective study, the medical records of 619 patients with an admitting diagnosis of STEMI from Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Emergency Department (TTSH ED) between 1st January 2009 and 31st December 2009 were reviewed. We extracted the data from the electronic records of the emergency case notes and inpatient discharge summaries. RESULTS. Of the 619 patients studied, 123 (19.9%) were women and 496 (80.1%) men. Four hundred and forty-nine (72.5%) patients underwent coronary angiography. One hundred and seventy (27.5%) patients did not undergo coronary angiography, majority (65.3%) were elderly aged C65 years (men 34.1% and women 31.2%). Between women and men, there was no significant difference between the number and distribution of diseased coronary vessels (including triple vessel and left main stem diseases). Regardless of age, men were frequently treated with a coronary artery stent (67.9%). Elderly women (aged C65 years) were more often treated conservatively (67%) while those younger women (aged B64 years) were frequently treated with a coronary artery stent (62.1%). In-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher for women than men (6.5 vs. 3.8%, p = 0.013). Amongst the patients treated conservatively, elderly women had the highest in-hospital mortality when compared to the other patients (women C 65 years 19.2 vs. women B64 years 2.7%; men C65 years 13 vs. men B64 years 6.8%). Compared to men, women were significantly older (p \\ 0.001; 95% CI 12. 6-17.6) , more likely to have a history of hypertension (73.2 vs. 50.2%; p \\ 0.001), diabetes (45.5 vs. 28.2%; p \\ 0.001), hyperlipidemia (63.4 vs. 46.6%; p = 0.001), peripheral vascular (5.7 vs. 1.2%; p = 0.006) or ischemic heart diseases (28.5 vs. 15 .7%; p = 0.002) and less likely to be smokers (12.2 vs. 57.7%; p \\ 0.001) or consume alcohol (0 vs. 10.1%; p \\ 0.001).",

H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, Paris Diderot University, Hematology Department, Paris, France INTRODUCTION. AML is considered as an oncology emergency as a proportion of patients experience life threatening complications within the first hours or days after diagnosis. Early death had been shown to be statistically related to high white blood cell (WBC) and monoblastic leukemia 1-3 , with leukostasis and lysis syndrome as the most deadful events. OBJECTIVES. To evaluate the relationship between timing of ICU admission and outcomes in high risk AML patients at the earliest phase of the malignancy (before any chemotherapy) METHODS. Retrospective study in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Adult patients with newly diagnoses AML from 1998 to 2008 were included. Patients admitted for an immediate life sustaining therapy (ventilation, vasopressors or renal replacement therapy) were excluded. 42 patients admitted directly to the ICU (Early admission) were matched for age, WBC and FAB subtype with 42 patients primarily admitted in hematology ward. Datasets were extracted from medical charts. RESULTS. 84 patients were included (42 early admitted to the ICU and 42 admitted first to the wards). Median follow up was 10.3 months. Median age was 46.5 years (36-57). FAB M4 or M5 was retrieved in 58% of the patients. Karyotype was favorable for 30% and poor for 19%. Median WBC was 103 9 10 9 L -1 . No statistical difference was seen for demographic and hematological parameters between early admitted patients and matched controls. Among the 42 patients admitted first to the wards (controls), 20 were subsequently admitted to the ICU (Lately admitted) and 22 remained in ward during the entire treatment course (Never admitted). The median time between diagnostic and ICU admission of this last group was 4 (1-9) days. Strikingly, patients lately admitted had more frequently dyspnea,oxygen requirement, high respiratory rate, low diastolic arterial pressure and lower first 24 h urine output. Lately admitted patients were less likely to receive the complete dose of induction chemotherapy (68 vs. 88%) Furthermore, Late admission resulted in increased use of invasive mechanical ventilation (60 vs. 33%) and vaso-active drugs (60 vs. 16%). These differences resulted in longer stay in ICU and decreased survival. CONCLUSION. Patients at the earliest phase of High risk AML who are lately admitted to the ICU experience worse outcomes, with increased use of life-sustaining therapies and higher mortality, compared to patients early admitted to the ICU. Physiologic parameters at the time of AML diagnosis such as respiratory rate, diastolic blood pressure, SpO 2 , or oxygen need are likely to help clinicians distinguish those patients at risk of late ICU admission and subsequent adverse outcomes. Studies are needed to assess the right place for newly diagnosed AML with physiological abnormalities but no organ dysfunction. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained tachyarrhythmia in the community. It has a prevalence of *10% in those over 75 years of age (1) . The chronic health consequences of chronic AF are significant. It can cause impaired cardiac function, a fivefold increased risk of stroke and decreased life expectancy (2) . AF is also the commonest arrhythmia in the critically ill, though a recent systematic review (3) was unable to recommend evidence based standards due to the heterogeneity of the studies. OBJECTIVES. A retrospective cohort study to assess the impact that chronic AF has on the outcome from critical illness. METHODS. All patients admitted with chronic AF between 27/04/2006 and 05/09/2009 were identified. We recorded age, APACHE II and predicted hospital mortality, actual ICU and hospital mortality, past medical history, admitting diagnosis, medication, echo findings, anticoagulants given, therapy instituted, and any further events between ICU and hospital discharge. The only data collected for the patients who did not develop AF was their age, APACHE II and predicted hospital mortality and actual ICU and hospital mortality. Data analysis using Chi square test and Mann-Whitney U test were used where appropriate. RESULTS. 1168 patients were admitted to the ICU over the study period, 46 of which had a history of chronic AF (3.9%), the remaining results are shown in Table 1 . ",

Interestingly, there was no difference in ICU and hospital mortality between the 2 groups. Despite the chronic AF group being older with significantly worse APACHE II scores. Indeed the hospital mortality (30.4%) of those patients admitted with chronic AF was over 30% less than predicted hospital mortality (44.2%). Why patients with chronic AF are outperforming expectation is not clear. It could be that APACHE II is over estimating the severity of illness in these individuals, or is there something about the way chronic AF is treated that affects the response to critical illness, for example, anticoagulation therapy? One of the major outcome measurements in burns centers is still mortality after severe burns. There are many predictive factors in admission as well as factors that are related with all the course of the disease responsible for survival after severe burn. Many centers have a minimum standard of burn survival or LA50 (the body surface area that kills 50% of people) and also have generated computer models of death probabilities based on age and TBSA (total body surface area) burned.

Most patients were admitted from the Department of hemato-oncology ward of the Hospital (72.3%), 6.6% of the emergency department and 21.2% of another hospital. The ICU mortality was 42.3%, with a corresponding hospital mortality of 75.2%. The discriminative capacity of the severity scores, as assessed by the area under the ROC curve (aROC) was 0.775 for SAPS II and 0.713 for APACHE II. For the delta SOFA calculated for each organ dysfunction, progression of respiratory dysfunction/failure and cardiovascular failure demonstrated the best discriminative power (aROC of 0.718).",

More than half of these patients (59%) did not have any chronic GEH disease. The patients were admitted most often from the emergency department (57%). The most frequent admission diagnosis was gastrointestinal bleeding (50%) followed by hepatic diseases including hepatic failure and acute hepatic encepahalopathy, biliary tract infection (15%), pancreatitis (5%) and enteric diseases including massive diarrhea and bowel obstruction (5%). On admission median APACHE II and glasgow coma scores were 18 [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] and 15 [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , respectively. Acute kidney injury (defined by RIFLE criteria risc, injury or failure) was found in 59 (%44) patients. The most common RIFLE class was class failure (22%).

The prescription of stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) in critically ill patients is relatively commonplace due to the association between physiological stress and gastrointestinal (G.I.) bleeding. However, recent guidelines recommend that only patients who are mechanically ventilated, and/or have a coagulopathy warrant prophylaxis.

All patients admitted to the ICU of neurotrauma, which underwent a tracheostomy after admission. Data were collected: affiliation, Cause of admission, average stay, indication of tracheostomy, tracheostomy time delay from its indication, place of performance of the procedure (ICU or operating room), perioperative complications (event during transfer to operating room, event during surgery: hypoxia, hypotension, arrhythmia, bleeding, premature extubation, false cannulation, cardiac arrest, pneumothorax or death), and postoperative complications in the first week (bleeding, difficulty in changing cannula, stomal infection, pneumothorax, death CONCLUSIONS. Tracheostomie is a simple surgical technique and 64.81% of tracheostom\u00edes could be safely performed in the ICU, saving hours of scheduled interventions in the operating room. There were no serious event during the transfer to the operating room or during the performance of tracheostomy. Tracheostomized patients in ICU, had a higher incidence of hypotension during surgery, although this complication in any case was serious or required treatment with vasoactive amines. When the tracheostomy is performed in the operating room, the delay shows a tendency to be higher, although this difference is not SS INTRODUCTION. The concept of tight glyceamic control in critically ill has led to the rise of number of insulin infusion protocols designed to keep the blood sugar (BS) in predefined range. At the same time monitoring practices and patients populations vary greatly between intensive care units and thus so do the results. The matter is complicated by the absence of a widely agreed common glyceamic control indicators against which protocols can be evaluated and compared (1).",

Our study shows that reasons for sampling are often relatively weak and sampling is promoted by ICU protocols. Frequent sampling does not change management for a large proportion of samples and may cause anaemia. There are financial implications to frequent sampling-at the time of the study each sample cost \u00a31.50 (\u20ac1.71) to process. Each unit of blood transfused cost \u00a3140 (\u20ac159). We have considered ways to reduce sampling including changing the glucose protocol to capillary sampling, using 1 ml syringes, increased use of end tidal CO 2 monitoring, protocol redesign and education of staff. REFERENCE(S It has been reported that tight glyceamic control is associated with net savings in terms of length of stay on the ITU and critical care bed occupancy (1) . Whilst it might be true for the overall length of stay, there is as yet, an un-quantified effect of frequent blood sugar measurement on the overall available nurse-patient time (2) . There is finite amount of nurse-patient time within any given shift and so prioritizing nursing care will be an important factor in critically ill and high dependency patients. This is specifically important for any saving to be realized from the introduction of automated blood sugar measurement devices (3). OBJECTIVES.

In keeping with widely published data regarding survival to discharge after in-hospital cardiac arrest, the high mortality rate of 50% for this cohort of patients emphasises the importance of early recognition of abnormal physiology and timely intervention. With the sensitivity, specificity and validity of EWS yet to be validated and no clear benefit proved from the introduction of MET/outreach teams, an alternative strategy for earlier recognition of critically ill patients is needed. Our data suggests that arterial blood gas sampling, an essential investigation central to the recognition of critically ill patients is being consistently overlooked and is an important factor influencing outcome. RESULTS. Attended patients were 2,787, with mean age of 58, 7 years, and women represent 41, 2% of them. Most demanding services were Internal Medicine (31%) followed by General Surgery, Haematology and Nephrology. Global data may be seen in Table 1 . With regards to admissions to the ICU of these patients, Table 2 depicts the proportion between requested admissions, and refusals. INTRODUCTION. Tradicionally, critical care interventions are highly intensive, expensive and brief. Critical illnesses and interventions that we use, can both contribute to postICU disability: catheter-related bacteraemia, polineuropathy, resistant organism, nutricional problems, complications of tracheostomy, prolonged analgesic. All these factors and a premature discharge from an ever full ICU, can even have an impact on occult mortality after discharge from ICU (between 6 and 20%). In our Unit a follow up program have been implanted. When patients are about to be discharged from ICU, ICU clinicians selected those considered to be recoverable but fragile enough to have poor prognosis.",

Thirty sheep (35-40 kg) were operatively prepared for chronic study, and were randomly allocated either to sham, control, rhAPC, CEF, or rhAPC/CEF groups (n = 6 each). After tracheostomy, acute lung injury and sepsis was produced in all groups, following an established protocol (1, 2) , except the sham group that received the vehicle. The sheep were studied for 24 h in an awake state and were ventilated with 100% oxygen. PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was determined intermittently. CEF (3 g) was administered intravenously 1 and 13 h post injury. RhAPC was given as a continuous infusion (24 mcg/kg/h), starting 1 h post injury. The animals were resuscitated with Ringer's Lactate Solution to maintain filling pressures and hematocrit. Lung tissue was obtained during necropsy and analyzed for myeloperoxidase (MPO) using a commercially available kit. Statistical analysis: two-way ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc comparison.

MPO levels of combined rhAPC/CEF (90 \u00b1 20*) showed no difference to sham, but were significantly lower than controls or rhAPC or CEF alone. CONCLUSIONS. Combined administration of rhAPC and ceftazidime in ARDS associated with septic shock improved oxygenation more than CEF or rhAPC alone, and prevented the onset of ARDS. Seleno-compounds, such as sodium selenite (Na 2 SeO 3 ) show conflicting clinical results in the treatment of sepsis. Efficacy, as well as mechanism of action of Na 2 SeO 3 , are unclear, with prevailing opinion that it acts as an anti-oxidant. However, Na 2 SeO 3 has also oxidant properties that could have a paradoxical therapeutic role in septic shock by reducing over-activated phagocytic cells. Indeed, in septic sheep, high dose Na 2 SeO 3 injection as bolus rather than continuous administration resulted in a beneficial effect on survival time, macro and microcirculation (1). OBJECTIVES. To investigate at the endothelial level the mechanism of action of a bolus injection of a high oxidative dose of Na 2 SeO 3 .",

During sepsis the availability of ARG, the substrate for endothelial NO production, is tempered as a consequence of increased inflammatory NO synthase (iNOS) activity. The reduced endothelial NOS (eNOS) activity and vascular NO production is believed to result in endothelial and vascular dysfunction. A shortage of ARG availability for eNOS is considered the main cause of the dysfunction. Previous studies have indicated CIT as an important, if not exclusive, mediator for eNOS-derived NO production.

In this controlled randomized doubleblinded study 25 anaesthetized and ventilated pigs (37.1 \u00b1 5.1 kg) were enrolled after approval by the local governmental commission. METHODS. By continuous infusion of endotoxin (Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B4, Sigma-Aldrich; 7.8 \u00b1 2.0 lg/kg/h) over a time period of 3.5 \u00b1 0.2 h, septic shock was induced. Hemodynamic stabilization was performed by either use of the vasopressor norepinephrine alone (control group; n = 5) or in combination with levosimendan (0.4 lg/kg/min; n = 10) or dobutamine (15.0 lg/ kg/min; n = 10). In a setting of 10 h of measurements and treatment heart rate (HR), MAP, central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) and cardiac output (CO) were recorded continuously and evaluated hourly. Beside norepinephrine requirement and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO 2 ) mean survival time and survival rate within the measurement period were analysed. RESULTS. After endotoxinemia septic shock was marked by reduction of CO and SVO 2 [p \\ 0.05]. Mean survival time and survival rate were superior in levosimendan treated animals ( Table 1 ). Norepinephrine consumption was lowest in the levosimendan group. After 10 h, CO of surviving animals was highest in the levosimendan group and statistically different compared with the control group. Comparison of parameters HR, MAP, CVP and MPAP showed no differences between treatments. CONCLUSIONS. The complementary use of the calcium sensitizer levosimendan provides potential survival advantage in endotoxemic septic shock. Beside an increase in CO, improvement of regional organ perfusion or protection could be an explanation and has to be shown by further analysis. REFERENCE(S METHODS. The study group consisted of 100 patients with shock on vasopressor support and control group had 100 normotensive patients. Arterial and capillary samples were taken simultaneously and were tested immediately at the bedside. The results of the paired measurements were analysed as a scatter plot by Bland and Altman method and were expressed as a correlation coefficient. Values were considered to disagree significantly when the difference exceeded 20%. RESULTS. Mean arterial and capillary sugars (mg/dl) in study and control groups were 164.7 \u00b1 70 and 157.4 \u00b1 68.9, and 167.1 \u00b1 62.2 and 167.5 \u00b1 61, respectively. On Bland-Altman analysis, 6% in study group and 5% in control group were out of range (acceptable limit \\ 5%) [ Figures 1, 2] . Correlation between capillary and arterial values was less in the study group (r = 0.917, p \\0.001 vs. r = 0.979, p \\ 0.001). In addition, the disagreement between capillary and arterial values was more than 20% in 18% of the patients in the study group vs. 3% in control group (p = 0.015) (ISO standard \\ 5%). CONCLUSIONS. Capillary blood glucose monitoring can be applied reliably to patients in ICU. However, caution must be exercised in patients with shock in whom arterial blood may be preferred.",

Effective TGC with SPRINT resolved organ failure faster, and for a greater percentage of patients who had similar admission and maximum SOFA scores, compared to a matched retrospective conventional control cohort. These morbidity reductions mirror the reduced mortality seen with SPRINT. These results suggest that reduced organ failure, assessed by SOFA, is a fundamental element in reduced mortality when TGC is implemented effectively. INTRODUCTION. Tight glycaemic control was reported to reduce mortality in selected surgical critically ill patients and lowering of blood glucose (BG) levels was recommended as a means of improving patient outcomes (1) . However, this approach has been linked with significant risk of hypoglycaemia. Recently, several studies have confirmed significant associations between variability of BG levels and patient outcomes (2).",

A 100% response rate was obtained. We asked about the existence of a protocol for cooling, which patients were cooled, duration of cooling, by what particular method(s) cooling was achieved and how temperature was monitored during cooling. RESULTS. 8 out of 10 (80%) adult ICUs in NI institute therapeutic hypothermia routinely as part of their post-resuscitation care. Only 2 out of the 8 units (25%) have a protocol for institution and maintenance of hypothermia. All units that utilise hypothermia do so regardless of the initial cardiac rhythm. 5 out of 8 (62.5%) ICUs target a temperature of 32-34\u00b0C with 3 out of 8 (37.5%) targeting a temperature of 34-36\u00b0C. All units utilise surface cooling methods with 2 out of 8 (25%) also using cold intravenous fluids occasionally. 6 out of 8 (75%) units cool for 12-24 h, 1 (12.5%) unit 12-48 h and 1 unit 24-36 h. All units use more than one method of temperature monitoring during cooling. All units sedate patients during cooling and 5 out of 8 (62.5%) also routinely curarise patients during cooling. The 2 units that do not currently use therapeutic hypothermia cited lack of resources/funding as the main obstacle to adopting this evidence based practice. CONCLUSIONS. The practice of therapeutic hypothermia post cardiac arrest has been embraced by the majority of ICUs in NI. There appears however to be variation in the target temperature and duration of hypothermia once instituted. ICUs that cool patients appear to do so regardless of initial cardiac rhythm. Regional protocolisation of this therapeutic modality may help standardise practice across NI ICUs. REFERENCE(S We compared our data with those from 2008 retrospective audit [3] . The method of TH was via surface cooling technique together with cold intravenous saline infusion but not IVCD. Total 73 patients presented with cardiac arrest: 31 underwent TH (22 OOH VF/VT and 9 OOH non-VF/VT). In 2009, there was an overall improvement in adherence to the audit standards, as shown in Table 1 : Table 2:   TABLE 2 Hospital survival rate of TH % GCS 15 of the survivors at ICU discharge 2008 12/31 (39%) 7/12 (58%) 2009 12/28 (43%) 11/12 (92%) CONCLUSIONS. Introduction of IVCD has led to an improved compliance with local and ILCOR TH guidelines. Although the total numbers are small, there has been an increase in the patients discharged with GCS 15 from our ICU using IVCD. There are areas that require further improvement, notably the time to reach target temperature and prevention of rebound hyperthermia.

Nielsen 1,2 , and the TTM-trial study group 1 Helsingborg Hospital, Department of anesthesia and intensive care medicine, Helsingborg, Sweden, 2 Lund University, Department of clinical sciences, section of anesthesia and intensive care medicine, Lund, Sweden INTRODUCTION. Experimental studies and previous clinical trials suggest an improvement in mortality and neurological function with induced hypothermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Previous trials have included highly selected populations and the optimal target temperature is not known. OBJECTIVES. To evaluate differences in efficacy and safety with target temperature management at 33 and 36\u00b0C for 24 h after OHCA of presumed cardiac cause. METHODS. Intervention: Patients will be managed with 24 h of temperature control at 33 versus 36\u00b0C according to randomisation. Temperature control will be delivered with temperature management equipment at the discretion of the trial sites. To facilitate cooling, when applicable, and to stabilise the circulation all patients will be treated with 30 ml/kg of crystalloid infusion (4\u00b0C or room temperature according to treatment arm). DESIGN. Randomised trial with 1:1 concealed allocation of 850 OHCA patients to temperature control for 24 h at 33 versus 36\u00b0C with blinded outcome assessment. Sample size is based on a relative risk reduction of 20% with a risk of type-1 error of 5% and a power of 90% with a 5% loss to follow-up. CONCLUSION. This study demonstrated that health care professionals, despite guidelines, are hyperventilating simulated cardiac arrests patients. Suboptimal ventilation was a problem across all the backgrounds investigated; although doctors performed best here, they were still found to be hyperventilating to an unacceptable level. Hyperventilation has a number of deleterious physiological effects and is associated with poor outcomes. Increased training, awareness and recertification may be the answer, and certainly improves short term compliance with guidelines. However, these effects may be short lived and other changes may be needed. A reasonable course of action may be the use of paediatric (1L) self inflating reservoir bags as a first line device. This simple measure may ensure delivery of more guideline consistent ventilation, independent of the level of experience. ",

Sixty-six adults with witnessed cardiac arrest of cardiac origin unrelated to poisoning or hypothermia undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation without return of spontaneous circulation (duration: 155 min [120-180], median, [25-75%-percentiles]) were included in a prospective cohort-study. ECLS was implanted under cardiac massage, using a centrifugal pump connected to a hollow-fiber membrane-oxygenator, aiming to maintain ECLS flow C2.5 l/min and mean arterial pressure C60 mmHg. INTRODUCTION. Due to the human lifespan increasing, people are living longer. Cardiac arrest (CA) in old people could be seen as a natural end of life process and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in this setting as a disturbance. Therefore, the question of prognosis in patients has been raised when performing CPR in the elderly. Data from the 1980s found 6month mortality in 94% of patients over 80 suggesting that CPR in elderly people could be futile (1) . The recent progresses in the management of resuscitated patients, such as mild hypothermia, were not evaluated in patients older than 75 years (2, 3) . In a recent study, we found that age [60 years was an independent pejorative prognostic factor (4) . Hence there is virtually no data of prognosis factor of elderly patients after CA. Our aim was to determine the prognosis factors in patients older than 75 years successfully resuscitated.",

We also find that the ICH score is higher than in the 07-09 sample, which is attributed to the admittance in the ICU of patients with the ultimate goal of organ donations. In the evolution, it can only be observed a longer stay in patients from the second sample, likely because they are more serious patients with a higher ICH score. The analysis of the two groups has not been conclusive when it comes to assessing the improvements that might have come out in these last years, although it is necessary a deeper analysis of the data. INTRODUCTION. Sodium dysbalances are frequent medical complications in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Hyponatremia is more frequent but it is associated with better outcome than hypernatremia. The aim of this study was to observe differences in outcome between hyponatremic and hypernatremic patients with SAH.",

This investigation has shown that the majority of patients admitted to our NeuroICU have less than optimally placed ICP sensors. Inappropriately deep sensors appear more common in surgical patients, particularly following craniotomy. The impact of this on patient outcome is unknown and would require further study. This study has highlighted we need to implement new methods to improve the accuracy of our ICP sensor placement. Graduated marks on the sensor sheath during manufacture may assist accurate placement. CONCLUSIONS. If ICP is largely used, it remains below 50%. 40% of the cases have been monitored with at least 3 techniques suggesting an acceptance tendency for a multimodal monitoring. Among these techniques, the control of PCO 2 seemed considered important as the use of TCD to assess perfusion and vessel tone. On-going analysis of these data will provide information on the therapeutic strategy performed and the impact on outcome. INTRODUCTION. Raised intracranial pressure (RICP) can be evaluated sonographically by measuring the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD). A wide variation in the threshold measurement of ONSD for RICP has been reported in literature. It is likely that exaggeration of the hypoechoic edge artifact around the dura by high frequency ([10 MHz) linear transducers and uncertainty over whether to measure 3-mm behind the papilla or behind the globe (posterior margin of sclera) could have resulted in such differences.",

Multiple linear regressions with constructive and defensive changes in practice as dependent variables and copying strategies as independent variables are summarized in Table 1 . Participants were more likely to make constructive changes if they coped by seeking social support (p = 0.015) and accepting responsibility (p = 0.041).

Reasons for high risks are e.g. sedation and analgesia, immobility, malnutrition and hemodynamic or oxygenation problems as well as poor identification or unsystematic assessment of the risks. In our unit, we performed a 6 months retrospective review of pressure ulcer risks for all patients (n = 747) using Jackson-Cubbin calculator.

Firstly, the Jackson-Cubbin pressure area risk calculator was translated into Finnish. A few changes which have an effect on pressure ulcer risk were added; weight limits were also defined with BMI values, Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy was added in deducted points as well as 24 h limit for blood transfusions and limits for hypothermia from 35 Celsius or under. Secondly, standardized guidelines for different risk levels were developed; if patients have a high risk specialized mattresses should be used and changes of positions and beds should be stressed. Thirdly, an electronic evolution form for patient information system was planned and implemented. Finally, a systematic education program for ICU personnel including special lectures, material demonstrations and familiarization by the nurse responsible for wound care was started. RESULTS. After the development project and systematic education the knowledge of personnel about pressure ulcer risks and care has increased. Risk points are counted once a day for every patient using the electronic form. All the mattresses at the ICU have been changed to medium and high risk mattresses and are chosen for a patient related to the risk assessment points. CONCLUSIONS. A reliable assessment scale, systematic measurement and continuous evaluation and education are crucial for identification of high risk pressure ulcer patient at the ICUs. With a systematic measurement and recognizing high risk patients we can also improve patients' quality of life and reduce the cost caused by pressure ulcers.

To examine associations of anemia and transfusion with adverse outcomes in patients with SAH, and better define Hb level thresholds associated with these. METHODS. Retrospective, observational study of consecutive patients with SAH admitted to ICUs at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville and Rochester, USA, over 6-year period. Data included demographics, nadir Hb, blood transfusion, ALI/ARDS, vasospasm, radiographically confirmed cerebral infarction, APACHE and WFNS. Primary outcome was association of anemia and transfusion with death and secondary outcomes were vasospasm, cerebral infarction and ALI/ARDS. RESULTS. We identified 333 patients, mean age was 56 (\u00b114), 206 (62%) were females. Mortality was 17%. Seventy-two (22%) of patients were transfused. 155 (46%) patients had vasospasm and 108 (33%) cerebral infarction. There was a strong association between transfusion and increased mortality (p = 0.001), vasospasm (p = 0.007), cerebral infarction (p \\ 0.001) and ALI/ARDS (p \\ 0.001)",

OBJECTIVES. Seeking the impact of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and apelin (APL) exogenous administrations on: ACTH & corticosterone blood contents, and respective pituitary and adrenal gland receptor expression (V1b, APJ) in a rodent model of endotoxin challenge. METHODS. A rodent model of endotoxin (LPS E. Coli 055:B5, 10 mg/kg I/P)-induced HPA axis has been selected to study the committment of AVP/APL and related receptors (V1b/ APJ). Rats (n = 6) were equipped with subcutaneous osmotic minipumps (Alzet, 2001) containing: saline, APL-13 (10, 100, 1,000 lg), or AVP (37.5, 75 lg) for 18 h. RESULTS. Without LPS challenge, exogenous APL administration did not alter ACTH & corticosterone blood contents whereas high dosage of exogenous AVP significantly increased corticosterone blood content (p \\ 0.05 vs. control). LPS I/P challenge induced a huge increased of blood ACTH & corticosterone, both culminating at 1.5 h (6-and 23-fold increases respectively, p \\ 0.05 vs. baseline), which was normalizing at 18 h for ACTH whereas corticosterone remained high. This dissociation validates the model, matchs with human observations, and suggests non ACTH-dependent corticosterone release after LPS challenge",

To determine if PCT and/or C-Reactive protein (CRP) levels at admission in Intensive Care Unit can help identify associated bacterial infection in patients with influenzae pneumonia. METHODS. A nationwide registry (REVA) was set up in France during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Levels of PCT and CRP at ICU admission were compared between patients presenting with Influenzae pneumonia associated or not with a bacterial coinfection. RESULTS. 137 patients were included, 48 of whom received antibiotics prior to hospitalization. Of the remaining 89 patients, 43 (48%) had documented bacterial co-infection. The bacteria involved in the co-infections were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 22, 16.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 11, 8.3%), Streptococcus A group (n = 6, 4.5%). Figure 1 shows the initial values of procalcitonin and CRP. Median values for both PCT (28.9 vs. 0.74 ng/ml, p \\ 0.001) and CRP (263 vs. 95 mg/l, p = 0.008) were significantly higher in patients with bacterial coinfection. The area under the ROC curve was 0.88 and 0.79, respectively for PCT and CRP. A cutoff of[0.8 ng/ml for PCT (sensitivity 91% and specificity 59%) best identified patients with bacterial co-infection. For CRP, a cutoff of[220 mg/l (sensitivity 75%, specificity 78%) best identified patients with bacterial co-infections. Comparison of the 2009 H1N1 pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia group revealed no differences except for a higher SAPS 3 in the latter",

We designed a prospective study of patients admitted in Emergency Department (ED) and Medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in a University Hospital. Inclusion criteria were acute dyspnea with SpO 2 B 92% and/or respiratory rate C25 b/min. Patients with obvious myocardial infarction or pneumothorax were excluded. All clinical and biological data were recorded and biomarkers sampled. An independent blinded expert panel classified the patients according to all the available data including response to treatment and outcomes blindly to biomarkers' results. The roles of biomarkers were assessed quantitatively and then using terciles of the distribution. The contribution of the biomarkers in the diagnosis was assessed using AUC-ROC curves and by multiple logistic regression taking into account other clinical and biological explanatory variables. RESULTS. 342 consecutive patients (52% male, med age 74 years, 28 day mortality 17%) were enrolled. The final diagnosis was severe sepsis for 126 (36.9%) (pulmonary: n = 104, non-pulmonary n = 22).

Although there was a trend in uNGAL and pNGAL towards complicated patients 48, 60 and 72 h postoperatively, it was nonsignificant. Nonetheless, plasma and urine NGAL may herald the onset of organ dysfunction in order of a postoperative SIRS response. Further validation of serum and urine NGAL as early biomarker for postoperative complications in patients without AKI, and improvement in early detection of inflammatory response in esophageal cancer patients are therefore warranted. 0232 EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY ASSISTED BY DA VINCI VS.

Comparative analysis of morbidity, mortality and hospital length of stay of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) by conventional surgery and by Da Vinci (DV) robot assisted surgery in our hospital. METHODS. Observational, prospective and retrospective study, between 2006 and 2009, of 71 patients with RP by conventional surgery (not admitted to ICU) and 94 patients with RP by DV robot assisted surgery, which were admitted in ICU directly from the surgery room. Surgery time, blood transfusions in the surgery room, mechanical ventilation (MV) time, and noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) use were recorded. Dependent variables were the length of surgery, postoperative complications, hospital length of stay and mortality. Data are expressed as mean, median or percentage, using the Student test to compare means and Chi square to detect possible associations between variables. RESULTS.",

Due to advances in haematology treatments such as bone marrow transplant and intensive chemotherapy, haematology oncology patients have an improved life expectancy. They are frequently subject to profound immunosuppression and physiological derangement requiring critical care support. With studies suggesting outcomes similar to those of critically ill non-cancer patients, factors such as disease prognosis, chemotherapy and renal replacement therapy (RRT) may play only minor predictive roles.

In the recent time, the trend towards minimally invasive surgery and the development of interventional services in non-surgical specialties has spurred considerable interest in bedside percutaneous tracheostomy (PCT). It has overcome surgical tracheostomy in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) because of the ease of procedure and minimal complications. Thrombocytopenia and deranged PT/APTT, which are common findings in an ICU, has been considered as relative contraindications for PCT. The objective of this study was to assess the safety of PCT in such patients.METHODS. 1,000 patients, who underwent PCT, were included in the study. Baseline hemoglobin, platelet counts, PT-INR, APTT were recorded. Patients having severe thrombocytopenia (\\40,000) and deranged PT/APTT with INR[ 2.5 received platelets and plasma transfusion respectively. Bleeding complications were recorded during and after PCT. All PCT's were performed under videobronchoscopic guidance.",

Mean systemic (MAP), central venous (CVP), pulmonary artery (PAP) and pulmonary artery occlusion (PAOP) pressures, as well as Q T , RABF, RCBF and UO were monitored for 5 h after the initiation of the E. coli infusion. Means were compared by ANOVA (factorial o repeated measures) and the post hoc Scheff\u00e9's test. RESULTS. In the control group, no significant hemodynamic changes were observed, whereas Sep-10 showed a fall in MAP, Q T , RABF, RCBF and UO, as well as an increase in PAP, as compared to the control group. Sep-17 showed a less marked fall in MAP, RABF, RCBF and UO as compared to Sep-10, and Q T was similar to the control group. CONCLUSIONS. This sepsis model is characterized by profound changes in systemic and renal hemodynamics. Aggressive fluid resuscitation prevents the sepsis-induced fall in Q T , so that the renal function and hemodynamics in sepsis can be studied under conditions of normal systemic blood flow.

Over a 2 year period 127 ICU patients with clinical conditions associated with acute respiratory failure (ARF), requiring mechanically ventilation were enrolled in the study. All patients were treated with high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) to control bronchial secretions. HFCWO was performed twice per day for 15 min per session. Patients served as their own control.CONCLUSIONS. These data suggest efficacy and tolerance in airways clearance secretions in mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care units.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGMENT. Partial funding support in the form of devices was provided by Hill-Rom Inc.INTRODUCTION. Transfer of clinical/physiological knowledge in medical devices such as mechanical ventilators is getting popular in order to shorten the time spent on the ventilator and to improve patient's safety. Several closed loop systems (SmartCare \u00d2 , IntelliVent \u00d2 ) already available on the market need further investigations to assess whether ventilation and arterial blood gases obtained with such closed loop systems fit the user's expectations as compared to conventional ventilation i.e. manual setting of the ventilator. However little is known on what ventilation and arterial blood gases are ''desirable''.They were more discussions on ''desirable'' ranges in chronic hypercapanic patients as compared to ALI/ARDS patients.REFERENCE(S).

Age and number of days receiving CMV prior to HFOV were identified as the significant predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS. Our results suggest that HFOV has benefits in improving efficiency in gas exchange and security in the mechanical ventilation rescue treatment in patients with severe ARDS. Significant higher mortality was observed in prolonged CMV prior to HFOV.

OBJECTIVES. The aim of this work was to assess the change in the Murray Lung Injury Score after ventilation with HFOV. METHODS. The study assessed how HFOV settings such as Continuous Distending Pressure (CDP) and Amplitude (DP) impact on differences in the Murray Lung Injury Score (MLIS) and its individual components. RESULTS. Between June 2006 and August 2009 36 patients underwent 49 trials on HFOV. Results show that there was a mean reduction in the MLIS of 0.34 after ventilation with HFOV, p value \\0.001.INFLUENCE OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY OF DIAPHRAGM ON THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE ON RESPIRATORY PATTERN DURING NEURALLY ADJUSTED VENTILATORY ASSIST",

Serrano-Simon 1 1 H.U. Reina Sofia, Cordoba, SpainINTRODUCTION. Percutaneous aortic valve implantation (PAVI) is an alternative therapy for patients with aortic valve stenosis who have a high risk for serious complications after surgery aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Because of the close proximity of the aortic valve to the atrioventricular node and bundle of His, the development of new cardiac conduction disorders (CCDs) after surgical SAVR is not uncommon. The incidence of permanent pacemaker implantation after PAVI ranges from 20 to 33%. Persistent AV block after SAVR requiring PPI have been shown to increase mechanical ventilation times, intensive care unit stay, and overall hospital stay.",

In recent years, different aspects of catheter-related bacteremia (CRB) have changed, including the appearance of multiresistant Gram-positive cocci, the knowledge of limitations of the antibiotics most commonly used for the treatment of this condition (glycopeptides), and the introduction of new active antibiotics against these pathogens.OBJECTIVE. This article analyzes trends in incidence rates, etiologies, and multiresistant markers of pathogens more frequently involved in CRB (including primary bacteremia) in Spanish Intensive Care Units (ICUs).MATERIAL AND METHODS. Prospective, observational and multicenter study, with voluntary participation of 74, 105, 112 and 121 ICUs from 71, 97, 103 and 112 hospitals, respectively, between the years 2005 and 2008 (both inclusive). Data included in the ENVIN-HELICS register was used.RESULTS. The rates of this complication have decreased and the incidence of CRB was around 5 episodes per 1000 central venous catheter-days. One-third of the episodes were associated with an important systemic response (severe sepsis or septic shock). Multiresistant Gram-positive cocci were the most frequent, although Gram-negative bacilli were isolated in 30% of the cases and fungi (different Candida spp.) in 6%. Staphylococcus epidermidis and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus persisted in a proportion greater than 80%, whereas methicillin-resistant S. aureus decreased to less than 40%.CONCLUSIONS. Empirical antibiotic treatment in extremely severe situations should consider coverage of the most frequent pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacilli as well as fungi in special situations.EFFECT OF CARE BUNDLE IMPLEMENTATION ON CATHETER RELATED BLOODSTREAM INFECTION ON THE INTENSIVE CARE UNITP.

Vakalos 1 , P. Tassioudis 1 , D. Papadopoulos 1 1 Xanthi General Hospital, ICU, Xanthi, Greece INTRODUCTION. Short term central venous catheters (CVC) are widely used in ICU patients, to administer intravenous fluids, medications, parenteral nutrition and to monitor hemodynamic status. The major complication remains the catheter related bloodstream infections (CRBSI). The risk of CRBSI varies according to the intravascular device, the duration of catheter placement and the use of proven preventative strategies.OBJECTIVES. The aim of our study was to record the incidence of CRBSI in relation with the total number of day's central venous catheter placement during the year 2009 and to compare the data with the year 2008 and to evaluate the difference.METHODS.During the year 2009, 64 patients admitted to our ICU and included retrospectively to our study. Mean age: 58.2 years, mean APACHE II score at admission: 16.8, mean length of stay (LOS): 12.68 days, recorded mortality: 21.47% and predicted mortality: 26.8%. Total number of ICU stay: 812 days.

'Defervescence of sepsis after removal of culture-positive central venous catheters (CVCs) 0 has been advocated for diagnosis of catheter related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) even without positive blood culture 1 . However, most studies report CRBSI incidence only when blood cultures, and CVC tip, are positive-standard definition 2,3 . We examined the effect of inclusion of defervescence criteria on CRBSI incidence in a Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) population, and examined the effect of concurrent antibiotic therapy at time of CVC removal.METHODS.Study was carried out in a 525-bed tertiary referral hospital over 12-years. CRBSI incidence was compared when standard definition was utilised (positive CVC tip culture and positive blood culture), versus when 0 defervescence criteria 0 was included. Sepsis defervescence was defined as fall in temperature, white cell count and sepsis resolution after CVC removal, with positive CVC tip culture, but negative blood cultures. CRBSI episodes where a blood culture was omitted were excluded.RESULTS. Study population included 1,365 patients in whom 2,536 CVCs were utilised over 15,234 CVC days. There were 192 CRBSI episodes in 165 patients. 152 CRBSI episodes met only the standard criteria for CRBSI; 40 episodes met defervescence criteria. Overall, patients were receiving antibiotics at the time of CVC removal in 104 of the 192 episodes [mean annual incidence 57% (\u00b1Std dev 0.14%)].Standard definition alone resulted in an average incidence of 10.6 per 1,000 CVC days (\u00b15.8 SD). This increased to 13 per 1,000 CVC days (\u00b16.4 SD) when defervescence criteria were included. Inclusion of defervescence criteria increased CRBSI incidence by an average of 2.5 episodes per 1,000 days (\u00b11.4 SD) or 27% p \\ 0.001; 95% CI(1.61-3.339).",

In our 32-beds mixed ICU, prospective surveillance of primary bacteremia and of microbiologically documented catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) is performed according to standardized definitions. New guidelines for central venous catheter (CVC) dressing combined a CHX-impregnated sponge (BioPatch \u00d2 ) with a transparent occlusive dressing (Tegaderm \u00d2 ) and planning for refection every 7 days. To contain costs, Biopatch \u00d2 was used only for internal jugular and femoral sites. Other elements of the prevention were not modified (overall compliance to hand hygiene 65-68%; non coated catheters except for burned patients [173 out of 9,542 patients]; maximal sterile barriers for insertion; alcoholic solution of CHX for skin disinfection).FigureDressings needed to be changed every 3-4 days. The decrease of catheter-related infections we observed in all consecutive admitted patients is comparable to that recently showed in a placeborandomized trial 2 . Further generalization to all CVC and arterial catheters access may be justified. CONCLUSIONS. Our data strongly suggest that combined with occlusive dressings, CHXimpregnated sponges for dressing of all CVC catheters inserted in internal jugular and/or femoral sites, significantly reduces the rate of primary bacteremia and CRBSI.REFERENCES.

O'Connell 2 1 Mid Western Regional Hospital, Dooradoyle, Limerick, Ireland, 2 Mid Western Regional Hospital, Limerick, Ireland INTRODUCTION. Health care associated infections present an enormous challenge to patient safety and quality of care in the Irish health Service.There is rising concern about MRSA infection rates in Ireland, particularly in the current era of service centralisation. A large proportion of hospital acquired MRSA bacteraemias occur in the ICU, and have been associated with a mortality rate of 48.3% 1 . A reduction in MRSA bacteraemia is a key component in reducing both Intensive Care and hospital morbidity and mortality.OBJECTIVES. The objective of this study was fourfold. We aimed to measure the incidence of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in the Mid Western Regional Hospital, the percentage of these which were methicillin resistant (MRSA), to identify the percentage of cases attributable to central venous catheters (CVC's) and to determine the reason for any change in MRSA rates.METHODS. A RetrospectiveSystematic Chart Review of patients with confirmed SA bacteraemia during the 5 year period from January 1st 2005 to 31st December 2009 was performed. Patients with SA-positive blood cultures were identified from the microbiology laboratory reporting system. RESULTS. The annual number of cases of Staphylococcus aureus infection ranged from 54 to 76. The percentage of cases attributable to MRSA increased from 34% in 2005 to 43% in 2009. Additionally, there was an increase in the incidence per 1000 bed days used (BDU) from 0.13 (2005) to 0.19 (2009). The number of clinically significant MRSA isolates increased from 69% in 2006 to 91% in 2009. CVC-associated MRSA rates in 2007 were 24%. In 2009 this increased to 30%. Hospital activity increased by 20% in 2009, compared to the preceding 3 years. DISCUSSION. MRSA bacteraemia rates in Ireland are higher than internationally accepted norms 2 . The trend in MRSA bacteraemia rates between 2005 and 2008 was comparable to that nationally but a marked increase was noted in 2009. The increased rate coincides with a large increase in hospital activity. Increased staff workload is shown to increase rates of MRSA colonisation, and MRSA bacteraemias. Higher levels of infection increases patient length of stay leading to a vicious cycle characterised by further infection control failure. The number of CVC-related MRSA bacteraemias also increased, probably due to increased patient turnover and staff workload. CONCLUSIONS. MRSA bacteraemia rates decreased steadily between 2005 and 2008 but increased in 2009, in line with increased staff and hospital activity. This confirms that increasing levels of hospital activity can lead to a large rise in clinically significant bacteraemias. If an increase in hospital workload is planned additional infection control procedures should be put in place. REFERENCES. 1. Robinson JO et al.

Rodriguez Villanova 1 1 Hospital Universitario Carlos Haya, UCI, M\u00e1laga, Spain, 2 Hospital Universitario Carlos Haya, M\u00e1laga, SpainOBJECTIVES. Analyzing the evolution of primary and secondary catheter infection in an intensive care unit of a third level hospital during 5 years, and the cause of the changes observed in this period.METHODS.Patients under study were admitted to the ICU and stayed more than 24 h. The follow-up period was 3 months and the study was carried out from 2005 to 2009. Analyzed variables were: bacteraemia cases per 1,000 days with catheter, APACHE, age, and isolated germ. We questioned whether the changes were due to the inclusion of new services in our intensive care unit (in 2007 we opened a postoperative ICU service, mainly devoted to urological and maxillofacial surgery) or the launching of a Zero bacteriaemia campaign. Nosocomial infection was defined as one that is acquired during hospitalization and was not present neither in the incubation period nor at the time of admission. Zero Bacteriaemia is a protocol for prevention of bloodstream infections related to central venous catheters in Spanish ICUs. The standardized intervention for the prevention of bacteriaemia related to the insertion and management of catheters was based on: proper hand hygiene, disinfection of skin with chlorhexidine, total barrier measures during insertion, avoidance of femoral access, removal of unnecessary catheters and hygienic catheters handling. observed an increase in the incidence rate related to the change of the microorganism in these infections (with an increase in those caused by Staphylococcus coagulase negative), with more resistance to oxacillin, methicillin, and also related to the inclusion of patients with a higher APACHE.CONCLUSIONS. Incidence rates of primary and secondary bacteriaemia to catheter infection changed because another service was introduced in our UCI(postoperative maxillofacial and urology) since 2007. There was a drop in the rates in 2009 which could be related to the implementation of the Zero bacteriaemia protocol.

Kyriakou, PICU, Athens, Greece OBJECTIVES. To asses the epidemiological and antimicrobial susceptibility data for nosocomial Gram-negative bacteremia in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) over a four-year period. METHODS. Positive blood cultures from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2007 collected from PICU patients were reviewed for microbial etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility. Patient charts were studied to determine the epidemiological data, source of infection, antibiotic treatment and outcome.RESULTS. In total, 689 patients, ranging in age from 18 days to 14 years, were admitted to our PICU. Forty-three episodes of nosocomial bacteremia involving 51 Gram-negative bacteria occurred in 34 (4.9%) patients (17 males, 17 females). The mean time from admission to the development of bacteremia was 30 days(3-125 days), while the mean PICU length of stay was 43 days(5-218 days). Admitting diagnoses included: respiratory failure (18), multitrauma (4), sepsis (4), other (8). Sources of bacteremia in most cases included intravascular catheterization (26) and intubation(14). Twenty patients (59%) have severe underlying disease. Ten patients (29.4%) died, but only one death attributed directly to the bacteremia. The majority (81.4%) of bloodstream infections were monomicrobial. Eight bacterial species were identified: Enterobacter spp. 35.3% (18), Klebsiella spp. 25.5% (13), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 15.7%",

We aimed to characterise immune specific responses to influenza A H1N1v and lymphocyte populations in peripheral blood and broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) in ICU patients ventilated for influenza pneumonia during the 2009/2010 pandemic.METHODS. Nineteen patients with proven H1N1v influenza infection (8 male, 11 females, median age 33 years) underwent simultaneous blood sample and BAL (n = 28) at various time from influenza symptoms. days from flu symptoms], and predominated on CD8 cells. In BAL, median lymphocytosis was 3% (0-35), enriched in CD8 cells when compared to blood. Those CD8 cells in BAL differentiated overtime with an accumulation of effector memory 45RA -CCR7 -CD27cells (Rho = 0.63, p = 0.05) and senescent CD57+cells (Rho = 0.42, p = 0.04). Very high frequencies of T cells (up to 10% of CD4 and 6% of CD8) specific for both the nucleoprotein and the hemagglutinin influenza proteins in Elispot IFNg and/or intracellular cytokine assays were observed in BAL for 3 patients. In blood, all patients displayed T cell memory responses to H1N1v in lymphoproliferative assays whereas memory responses to other recall antigens (CMV, HSV, PPD) were poor; Elispot IFNg assays showed hemagglutinin-specific, but poor nucleoprotein-specific effector T cells. Nine/10 patients tested seroconverted to H1N1v virus.CONCLUSIONS. Both cellular and humoral influenza-specific responses are detectable during severe H1N1v infection. Influenza-specific effector T-cell responses are relocated to the lung, whereas memory T-cell responses to other pathogens are diminished. These data offer new insights into the immunopathology of severe influenza pneumonia. CORTICOSTEROIDS THERAPY IN ICU'S DEEP NECK INFECTIONS T. Garcia 1 , M. Rios 2 , J.M. Pereira 2 , J.A.

In Spain, the incidence of meningococcal disease is 1.54 cases per 100,000 adults per year, and is the leading cause of meningitis and septicemia in young adults. We now provide a detailed description of clinical features, management and outcome in the patients admitted to our unit in the last year.MATERIAL. From November 2008 to February 2010 all patients with the diagnosis of meningococcal disease were identified. Demographics, clinical, management and outcome data were recordered. Date are expressed number/number assessed (%) or median (IQR).RESULTS.A total of 22 episodes of meningococcal meningitis occurred. The prevalence of the classical triad of fever, neck stiffness and change in mental status was low (11/22)-seeTable 1. The median age was 42.5 years (intercuartile range, IQR, 27-55). Acute of illness,defined as duration of symptoms before admission less than 24 h,was present in 10 of 22 (45,4%) patients. Change in mental status (defined as a score on the Glasgow Coma Score B 14) was present in 19/22 (86.36%) of the patients. Seizures before admission were present in only 2 of 22 patients. Focal neurologic abnormalities were present in 6 of 22 patients (27.2%), including aphasia in 1 patient, cranial nerve palsy 5. At presentation, signs of septic shock were present in 7 of 22 (31%) evaluated patients. Rash was present in 11/ 22. Hypotension was associated with presence of rash in all the patients (11/11). Neuroimaging (CT) was done on presentation in all the patients. CT abnormalities were found in 3/22 patients (cerebral edema in 2 patients and 1 with subdural empyema). Lumbar puncture was performed in only 16/22 (73%) of the patients, the main reason to do not perform it was coagulopathy. In all the patient, at least 1 individual CSF finding predictive of bacterial meningitis was present. Initial antimicrobial treatment consisted of a third-generation cephalosporin plus vancomicine. Delayed mean time of antibiotics administration was 3 h (IQR 0, 20 min-6 h). Adjunctive steroid treatment was administered to 9 patients (41%). All the CSF culture and or PCR yielded N. meningitides all of then serogroup C. Positive blood cultures were obtained in 7/22 patients (31.8%), and it seems to be more related with the presence of rash. Of 22 patients, 6 (27.3%) died; 4 of the 6 within 24 h. Refractory septic shock was the leading cause of mortality in 3 patients and 2 patients of brain death; 1 additional patient died of nosocomial infection. Outcome, was graded as favorable (GOS = 5) in 14/16 (87.5%) and unfavorable (GOS \\ 5) in 2/16 (12.5%).",

Despite advances in medical, surgical, and critical care techniques Infective Endocarditis (IE) is a severe disease with high in-hospital mortality rates. Since 2008 our ICU is part of a multidisciplinary IE group (Infectious Disease, Cardiology, Cardiovascular Surgery Department and ICU) and we participate in the Spanish register of endocarditis (GAMES).OBJECTIVES. We analyze the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment and morbi-mortality of IE in a tertiary care hospital.METHODS.It is an observational prospective study of 36 patients diagnosed of definite IE according to the modified Duke scheme between March 2008 and February 2010. We collected the information from clinical history and used the SPSS 18.0 software to perform the statistical analysis (descriptive).RESULTS.Of the 36 definite IE 41.7% were females, 58.3% males and the median age was 65.3 years. Native valves were implicated in 23 patients (65.7%), prosthetic valves in 11 (31.4%) and implantable defibrillator in 1 patient (2.9%). Nosocomial IE was found in 11 patients (30.6%). Valves involved: aortic 15 (42.9%), mitral 13 (37.1%), tricuspid 2 (5.7%) and C two locations 2 (11.4%). Previous chronic illnesses measured with Charlson ageadjusted index were 5.25 \u00b1 2.4. Previous IE was found in 4 patients (11.1%). Transesophageal echocardiography showed vegetations in 50%, valvular damage in 11%, perivalvular complications in 18% and low EF in 11% of patients. Blood cultures were positive in 89%. Causative agents: S. aureus 22%, S.mitis 17%, S. epidermidis 14%, E. faecalis 11%, S. bovis 8%, S. salivarius 9%, T. whippelii 5%. PCR was made in 13 patients (37%) on cardiac valves.CONCLUSIONS. IE is a severe and difficult to diagnose disease with high in-hospital mortality. Early recognition and treatment should be focused to reduce its mortality.SEPSIS AND MENINGITIS IN PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE. CLINICAL LAB-ORATORY FEATURES AND OUTCOMEG. Sideri 1 , G. Sideri 1 , A.

Patients with deep neck infections (DNI) usually present with neck pain, odynophagia and dysphagia and sometimes swollen neck or dyspnea.OBJECTIVES. Our aim was to evaluate whether admission variables could predict severe infection (SI) or complicated outcome (CO) and if SI was associated to CO in DNI drained surgically and admitted to the ICU.METHODS.Retrospective study of adult patients admitted for urgent surgical drainage of DNI and admitted to the ICU, between 01/2006 and 03/2010. Admission variables: patient characteristics, signs, symptoms, location of the abscess, time between symptoms and hospital admission and between hospital admission and surgery, lab and microbiological results, SOFA score, Apache2 and SAPS2.SI was defined as septic shock/severe sepsis on ICU admission, mediastinitis, empyema or necrotizing fasciitis.CO was defined as tracheotomy, re-intubation, critically illness myopathy, length of stay in ICU [7 days, renal replacement therapy and mortality.Associations were determined by Chi-square test.

Kidney transplant recipients are at risk for life-threatening events related to decompensation of co-morbid conditions, infection, drug-related toxicity, and malignancy. Although pulmonary complications are frequent, few studies have assessed severe pulmonary involvement in kidney transplant recipients. OBJECTIVES. To evaluate acute respiratory failure (ARF) in renal transplant recipients. METHODS. Retrospective observational study in nine transplant centers in consecutive kidney transplant recipients admitted to the ICU for ARF in 2000-2008. RESULTS. Of 6,819 kidney transplant recipients, 452 (6.6%) required ICU admission, including 200 admitted for ARF. The most common causes of ARF were bacterial pneumonia (35.5%), cardiogenic pulmonary edema (24.5%), and extrapulmonary ARDS (15.5%). Pneumocystis pneumonia occurred in 11.5% of patients. Mechanical ventilation was used in 93 (46.5%) patients, vasopressors in 82 (41%), and dialysis in 104 (52%). Hospital-and 90-day mortality rates were both 22.5%. Among the 155 day-90 survivors, 115 (74.2%) were dialysis-free, including 75 (65.2%) who recovered prior renal function. Factors independently associated with hospital mortality were shock at admission (odds ratio [OR], 8.70; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3.25-23.29), opportunistic fungal infection (OR, 7.08; 95%CI, 2.32-21.60), and bacterial infection (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.07-5.96). Four factors were independently associated with day-90 dialysis-free survival: renal SOFA score on day 1 (OR, 0.68/point; 95% CI, 0.52-0.88), bacterial infection (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21-0.90), 3 or 4 quadrants involved on chest X-ray (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21-0.91), time from hospital to ICU admission (OR, 0.98/day; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99), and oxygen flow at admission (OR, 0.93/l; 95% CI, 0.86-0.99).",

Many hospital care intervention programs have been started afterwards to reduce preventable adverse events. Beside direct patent care activities, improvement of patient safety culture (PSC) is an important objective of overall patient safety 2 .CONCLUSIONS. IZEP and COMPaZ are valid PSC measurement and interventions tools.Outcomes of the COMPaZ survey provides a quick insight. Learning opportunities are connected to low and high scoring dimensions. IZEP provides comprehension of PSC on a ward level. It improves awareness of PSC and it's importance. Evokes discussion about strengths and weaknesses and improvement measures are more steady due to local ownership. To improve PSC inserting only COMPaZ and IZEP is not enough.

AHRQ publication 04-0041.INTRODUCTION.Intensive care medicine is a relatively new specialty, which was created in the 1950s, after invent of mechanical ventilation, which allowed caring for critically ill patients who otherwise would have died. Over the years, intensive care medicine developed further and became a truly multidisciplinary speciality, encompassing patients from various fields of medicine and involving specialists from a range of base specialties, with additional (subspeciality) training in intensive care medicine. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the introduction of non invasive ventilation in 2007, and opening of first multidisciplinary ICU in Banja Luka heralded a new age of intensive care medicine.OBJECTIVES.The main aim of the study is to analyze the number of admissions, high severity scores, needs for mechanical ventilation and outcomes of treatment during the first year in medical ICU in Banja Luka University hospital.METHODS. This study is designed as a retrospective study.CONCLUSIONS. These results confirmed the need of these kinds of units in the country. In spite of still suboptimal personnel training, creation of ICU in Banja Luka may serve as example for other developing countries in the region. However, in order to achieve modern ICU standards and follow European trends toward harmonisation of medicine, Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to take up this challenge by recognizing intensive care medicine as a distinctive specialty, by implementing a specific training program and by setting up multidisciplinary ICUs in acute care hospitals.

These results are the basis of an ongoing clinical trial in human subjects.Pooled data for the MBP measurements CONCLUSIONS. The Finometer offers a feasible method of continuous BP monitoring in a cohort of haemodialysis patients. This reflects its potential use in a population with a high prevalence of co-morbidities experiencing significant haemodynamic stress, not just healthy individuals in the context of cardiovascular research. REFERENCE(S). 1. Schutte AE et al. Journal of Human Hypertension, 2004. Thromboelastography (TEG) and standard coagulation tests are carried out at temperature of 37\u00b0C thus omitting effects of hypothermia. Ramaker et al. tested in vitro different conditions including hypothermia. They found out significantly impaired K and Angle a, whereas maximum amplitude MA significantly increased(1). Rapid TEG has not been so far tested in hypothermia. OBJECTIVES. To compare the results of TEG with heparinase and Rapid TEG during mild therapeutic hypothermia when the blood was analysed at actual temperature (hypothermia) and 37\u00b0C (normothermia). METHODS. Twenty patients after CPR where therapeutic hypothermia (32-34\u00b0C) was indicated for 24 h were included into the study. Patients were observed for 36 h, TEG measurements were done in 12 h intervals. Standard coagulation tests, blood count and dose of anticoagulants/ antiaggregants were also monitored. Data are shown as median (IQR). Wilcox match pair test was used for the statistical analysis, p \\ 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS. Pooled TEG results when therapeutic hypothermia was reached (n = 40) are presented inTable forboth kaolin-heparinase (KH) and Rapid TEG samples.In hypothermic KH-TEG all parameters connected to cloth formation were different than those measured at 37\u00b0C. Cloth strenght parameters were not different. In hypothermic Rapid TEG, only parameter R and thereby ACT were slightly different than normothermic values. CONCLUSIONS. The cloth formation parameters of TEG measured during hypothermia were significantly different from the parameters measured at 37\u00b0C. The coagulum strength was not influenced by hypothermia. Rapid TEG was less able to track hypothermia influence on coagulation. Clinical significance of our findings remains to be determined.",

Brunner 1 , R. Kitzberger 1 , W. Miehsler 1 , H. Herkner 2 , C. Madl 1 , U. Holzinger 1 1 Medical University of Vienna, General Hospital, Dept. of Medicine III, Vienna, Austria, 2 Medical University of Vienna, General Hospital, Dept. of Emergency Medicine, Vienna, Austria INTRODUCTION. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been proposed to optimize glucose control in critically ill patients. To achieve strict glucose regulation, accurate and reliable CGM systems (CGMS) are essential.OBJECTIVES. Evaluation of a subcutaneous CGMS for use in critically ill patients.METHODS. 2045 CGMS sensor glucose values of 174 critically ill patients were compared to arterial reference blood glucose levels, determined by a blood gas analyzer. CGM data was recorded continuously for up to 72 h using a subcutaneous CGM sensor (CGMS Gold TM ; Guardian \u00d2 ; Medtronic, Northridge, CA, USA). The correlation of both methods and the differences between CGMS and reference values were calculated, as well as the conformity of CGM values with ISO criteria. Influence of covariates on the absolute value of the bias was examined by multivariable random coefficient modeling.RESULTS. The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.92, showing strong correlation between the two methods. Mean difference \u00b1 SD between CGMS and reference values was -0.100 \u00b1 0.641 mmol/L (CGMS minus reference) and absolute difference \u00b1 SD 0.441 \u00b1 0.475 mmol/L. According to the insulin titration error grid analysis 99.1% of CGMS values were in the acceptable treatment zone. No CGMS measurements were found in the life-threatening zone. 92.9% of the CGMS glucose values met the ISO criteria. Multivariable random coefficient modeling revealed that only the covariates age (0.003 mmol/L per additional year), glucose level (0.014 mmol/L per additional mmol/L glucose) and rank of measurement per patient (-0.015 mmol/L per rank) had a significant influence on the difference of CGMS to the reference value.CONCLUSIONS. The subcutaneous CGMS is reliable for use in critically ill patients and showed glucose values with a strong correlation to arterial reference blood glucose levels, determined by a blood gas analyzer.A TEST BENCH FOR TIGHT GLYCEMIC CONTROL ALGORITHMS BASED ON A SET OF VIRTUAL ICU PATIENTSA.

Desaive 1 1 University of Liege, Liege, Belgium, 2 University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand,3  Christchurch Hospital, Christchurch, New Zealand INTRODUCTION. Mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) after the first few days is strongly associated with organ failure rate and severity. This study uses the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score to evaluate the impact of a successful tight glycemic control (TGC) intervention (SPRINT) on organ failure, morbidity, and thus mortality.OBJECTIVES.To determine if effective TGC reduces the rate, level or number of organ failures in providing a platform for reduced ICU mortality.METHODS.A retrospective analysis of clinical data from 2003 to 2007 totalling 784 ICU patients and 6574 patient days. The data includes 371 patients (3358 patient days) on the SPRINT TGC protocol (August 2005-April 2007) and 413 matched retrospective patients (3,216 patient days) from the 2 years prior to the implementation of SPRINT in 2005, matched by APACHE III. Cohort details including glycemic and mortality outcome are in[1]. SOFA score was calculated daily for each patient. The effect of the SPRINT TGC intervention is assessed by the percentage of patients each day with a total SOFA score B5, and by trends over time. Organ-failure free days (all component SOFA scores B2) and total number of organ failures in each cohort (SOFA component scores[2)  are examined.RESULTS.Admission SOFA scores were similar (p = 0.20). Patients reached similar maximum SOFA scores (p = 0.76) in similar times (median: 1 day; IQR:[1, 3]) for both cohorts (p = 0.99). Median length of stay was similar (p = 0.94) with 4.1 days (SPRINT) and 3.8 days (pre-SPRINT). The percentage of patients with total SOFA B 5 is significantly different over time (p \\ 0.001), rising over the first 21 days to 85% for the Pre-SPRINT cohort and *93% for the SPRINT cohort, with clear separation from days 1-2 onward (p \\ 0.001).

Philips 1 1 St Georges University of London, Intensive Care Medicine, London, UK, 2 St Georges University of London, Renal and Transplant Medicine, London, UK, 3 St Georges University of London, Analytical Unit, London, UK INTRODUCTION. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) has been shown to cause a decrease in the hepatic metabolism of drugs in vivo and in vitro. The impact of acute kidney injury (AKI) on hepatic drug metabolism is untested. A single time point determination of midazolam concentration, 4 h after intravenous administration, accurately predicts total midazolam exposure and thus metabolism in critically ill patients. Midazolam metabolism is a measure of hepatic activity of cytochromes P450 (CYP3A) 3A4 and 3A5 that are involved in the metabolism of [50% of widely used drugs.METHODS. All patients admitted to the adult intensive care unit were considered unless they had received a benzodiazepine in the previous 24 h, had acute or chronic hepatic failure, were pregnant or were being administered major CYP3A inhibitors i.e. macrolide antibiotics or an imidazole anti-fungal. 1 mg midazolam was given intravenously at time 0 and serum collected at 4 h. Serum midazolam concentration was determined by mass spectrometry: T 4 [mid]. Patients were categorised using the AKIN/RIFLE criteria.

The possibility of kidney function impairment by artificial colloid solutions was shown in a few recent investigations. One of the probable mechanisms of acute renal failure (ARF) is hyperoncotic kidney injury during administration of hyperoncotic solutions in patients with unstable renal perfusion pressure.OBJECTIVES.To determine the incidence and risk factors of ARF required renal replacement therapy (RRT) in patients with intracranial hemorrhages (ICH).METHODS.A retrospective analysis of 274 patients with ICH admitted to the neurosurgical ICU from 01/10/2008 to 01/04/2009 was performed. 118 pts treated in ICU more than 3 days were selected for subsequent analysis. All patients had risk factors of ARF (vancomycin and aminoglycosides administration, hyperosmolar solutions infusion, vasopressors). Patients were divided into 3 groups depending on colloid solution they were treated with (85-6% HES 130/0.4/9:1; 24-6% HES 130/0.42/6:1; 9-10% HES 200/0.5). Average amount of infused HES did not exceed safe recommended daily dose. Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) staging system was used for ARF determination. AKIN stage III was the indication for RRT.We used multiple linear regression analysis and odds ratio (OR) to determine rick factors of mortality and ARF.RESULTS.We did not find significant differences in SOFA score, artificial lung ventilation necessity, vasopressors use, serum creatinine and urea levels during 28 days of observation in pts treated with different types of HES. The incidence of ARF required RRT was 5.9%. Vancomycin administration was the main rick factor of ARF (regression coefficient b = 0.146; sb = 0.058; P = 0.01). Risk of ARF was lower in pts treated with tetrastarches (6% HES 130/0.4/9:1 vs. 10% HES 200/0.5, OR 0.01 (95% CI 0.0005; 0.23, P = 0.004), 6% HES 130/0.42/6:1 vs. 10% HES 200/ 0.5, OR 0.09 (95% CI 0.008; 0.99, P = 0.049)). ARF development was associated with significant increase of length of stay in ICU (pts without 20)  days; pts with ARF-28 (15;43) days, P = 0.013) and inhospital mortality (pts without ARF-24%; pts with ARF-100%, P \\ 0.05). The main risk factors of inhospital mortality were ARF (b = 0.449; sb = 0.138; P = 0.001), pneumonia (b = 0.413; sb = 0.076; P \\ 0.01) and hyperosmolar solutions administration (b = 0.233; sb = 0.075; P = 0.002). We didn't find any correlation between inhospital mortality and type of HES (6% HES 130/0.4/9:1 vs. 10% HES 200/0.5, OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.07; 1.2, P = 0.09); 6% HES 130/0.42/6:1 vs. 10% HES 200/0.5, OR 0.4 (95% CI 0.08; 1.91, P = 0.25); 6% HES 130/0.4/9:1 vs. 6% HES 130/0.42/6:1, OR 0.74 (95% CI 0.28; 1.97, P = 0.74).CONCLUSIONS. The incidence of ARF required RRT in patients with ICH is 5.9%. ARF is associated with significant increase of length of stay in ICU and inhospital mortality. Vancomycin and 10% HES 200/0.5 are the main rick factors of ARF required RRT.CONTINUOUS HEMODIAFILTRATION IN PATIENTS WITH HYPEROSMOLAR NONDIABETIC ENCEPHALOPATHY AFTER CARDIAC SURGERYT. Mukhoedova 1 , Z. Unarokov 1 1 State Research Institute of Circulation Pathology, Department of Extracorporeal Detoxification, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation INTRODUCTION. Hypernatremia in critically ill patients associates with severe neurological disorders and increasing mortality. Continuous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) can be a method of choice when traditional therapy is noneffective. The gradual slow correction of sodium (0.5-1 mmol/l/h) and serum osmolarity is very important to avoid cerebral edema. High-sodium solutions for CVVHDF have been suggested to be used in recent years. OBJECTIVES. To investigate the effect of CVVHDF with high-sodium solutions in patients with hypernatremic hyperosmolar nondiabetic encephalopathy after \u00f1ardiac surgery. METHODS. Fourteen patients after \u00f1ardiac surgery with hypernatremia were treated from April 2005 to November 2009. Mean age 56.6 \u00b1 2.7 years. Twelve patients were on vasopressor support, 13 patients on mechanical ventilation. All patients had Acute Kidney Injury in the stage Injury or Failure. APACHE II severity was 28.2 \u00b1 0.9. All patients had the severe cerebral disorder, severity of a Glasgow score was 8.3 \u00b1 0.7 (from 4 to 12). Four patients had cerebral infarction, identified by tomography. The mean pre-CVVHDF urea was 26.4 \u00b1 2.4 mmol/l, sodium -160.2 \u00b1 1.2 (to 175) mmol/l, and glucose level between 5.2 and 14.1 (10.2 \u00b1 0.7) mmol/l. Calculated osmolarity was 366.2 \u00b1 2.1 mosm/l. CVVHDF was performed on Multifiltrat (Fresenius Medical Care) and Prismaflex (Gambra Medical). 10% sodium chloride was added to replacement and dialysate solutions to avoid concentration of natrium less than serum one to 5-10 mmol/l. The concentration sodium in solutions was changing in CVVHDF. RESULTS. CVVHDF was started on 2.3 \u00b1 0.2 postoperative days; mean time was 60.3 \u00b1 9.1 h. The reduction rate of sodium level -0.5 to 1 mmol/l/h. Twelve patients with correction of sodium concentration had recovery cerebral functions after 12-56 h CVVHDF.",

Tsidemiadou 1 1 Thriassio General Hospital of Eleusis, Intensive Care Unit, Latsion Burn Center, Athens, Greece INTRODUCTION. The impact of acute kidney injury (AKI) on the outcome of ICU patients has well been recognized. However, there is no consensus on the definition of AKI. The most widely used classifications are RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage kidney disease) and AKIN (Acute Kidney Injury Network).OBJECTIVES. This study investigated AKI as predictor of ICU mortality, comparing the corresponding predictive ability of RIFLE and AKIN classifications as well.METHODS. Prospective cohort study of critically ill patients admitted in a multidisciplinary ICU. Patients were daily evaluated for the presence of AKI using RIFLE (1) and AKIN criteria(2). Data recorded were: age, gender, admission category (medical, elective surgical, emergency surgical, trauma, burn), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score at admission, daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, implementation of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), use of nephrotoxic agents, ICU length of stay (LOS) and ICU mortality. Data were analyzed with logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with statistical significance set at p \\ 0.05.RESULTS.One hundred fourteen patients (72 male, 42 female) were included in the study. Age (mean \u00b1 SD) was 51.7 \u00b1 20.5 years, APACHE II score 17.6 \u00b1 8.3. AKI was recorded in 41 patients (36.0%) with RIFLE criteria (23.7% risk, 7.0% injury, 4.4% failure and 0.9% loss) and in 46 (40.4%) with AKIN criteria (21.1% stage 1, 6.1% stage 2 and 13.2% stage 3). ICU mortality was independently associated with APACHE II score at admission [odds ratio (OR) = 1.2, p = 0.001] and with AKI [OR = 9.2 (95% confidence interval 3.1-27.5)  in the RIFLE-AKI model and OR = 9.1 (95% confidence interval 3.2-27.5)  in the AKIN-AKI model]. The predictive ability of RIFLE and AKIN scores at the beginning of AKI and that of the maximum RIFLE and AKIN scores in the ICU was poor [areas under curve (AUCs) \\ 0.7]. However, bivariable models with APACHE II score and the initial RIFLE or AKIN score showed a very good predictive ability for ICU mortality (both AUCs = 0.872, p \\ 0.001). AKI based on RIFLE criteria displayed 71.4% sensitivity and 85.2% specificity for predicting ICU mortality, while the corresponding estimates for AKI based on AKIN criteria was 65.7% sensitivity and 83.6% specificity.CONCLUSIONS. AKI is an independent risk factor for ICU mortality. Development of AKI, defined by either RIFLE or AKIN criteria, is significantly associated with a ninefold increase of ICU mortality. AKI defined with the RIFLE criteria was a more sensitive predictor of ICU mortality compared with AKIN-defined AKI.REFERENCES. 1. Bellomo et al. Crit Care 2004;8:R204-R212 2. Mehta et al.

Dal Pizzol 1 1 Universidade do Extremo Sul Catarinense, UNESC, Crici\u00fama, BrazilINTRODUCTION. Acute renal failure (ARF) is long recognized as a severe disorder. The most common etiology of ARF in ICU is acute tubular necrosis. Hypotension, as a result of sepsis, heart failure, or severe hypovolemia, is a common cause of acute tubular necrosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated as important effectors of tubule cell injury in both isquemic and toxic acute tubular necrosis. ROS have several deleterious effects on cells including lipid peroxidation, oxidation of cell proteins and damage to DNA.OBJECTIVES. We hypothesized that the association of NAC and DFX decrease oxidative stress and inflammatory markers, therefore attenuates the acute kidney injury in patients with shock admitted to an ICU.METHODS.Prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study design was approved by ethics committee. Informed consent were obtained from patients or their legal surrogate. Were included patients who had new onset of at least 30 min of hypotension or vasopressor medications use (March-December of 2009). Patients were randomized by a research nurse to receive NAC + DFX or placebo, based on a randomization scheme. A dose of NAC was 50 mg/kg by 4 h followed by 100 mg/kg/day for 48 h. A single dose of DFX (1 g) was administered intravenously at a rate of 15 mg/kg/h, both doses diluted in glucose 5%.",

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a well-known, serious complication after cardiac surgery. Despite the magnitude of the problem and the fact that cardiac surgery has been a feature of modern hospital practice for several decades, the mortality of postoperative AKI remains high, ranging 40-60%.OBJECTIVES. We aimed to evaluate pre and perioperative risk factors of an impairment of renal function in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB)METHODS.For this retrospective analysis we enrolled 2339 consecutive patients undergone cardiac surgery with CPB in a 3-years period. To assess risk factors in this population for developing postoperative AKI, defined as a postoperative serum creatinine [ 2.0 mg/100 ml, we studied the influence of 20 perioperative variables, that were analysed with v 2 test, and relative risk calculated by logistic regression analysis and expressed with 95% confidence interval. A p value \\0.05 was considered significant.RESULTS.A postoperative AKI as above defined was found in 197 patients (8.42%). Mortality rate in these patients was 11.16%, and 44 patients (22.33%) required a Renal Replacement Treatment (RRT).

Recently continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has been increasingly utilized for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury. However, when and how to implement CRRT remains unclear in those patients, especially in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). We hypothesized that isovolemic continuous hemodiafiltration expecting less hemodynamic compromise might be beneficial in refractory oliguric patients with ADHF.AIMS.To evaluate the effects of isovolemic continuous hemodiafiltration on clinical course in refractory oliguric patients with ADHF.METHODS.We retrospectively reviewed 135 consecutive patients treated with CRRT admitted to Intensive and Cardiac Care Unit, Nippon Medical School Hospital between 2006 and 2009. Patients who complicated cardiogenic shock, who were preventive dialysis for contrast-induced nephropathy or who were maintenance dialysis for end-stage kidney disease were excluded.RESULTS.Of the 135 study patients, ten underwent isovolemic continuous hemodiafiltration. 60% were women, mean age was 75 years, mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 44%, and ischemic etiology was 70%. Before continuous hemodiafiltration, mean serum creatinine was 3.7 mg/dl and mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 12.5 ml/ min/1.73 m 2 . Average dialystate and replacement fluid was 996.9 \u00b1 180.6 ml/h. Significant diuresis was observed at 2.2 \u00b1 1.5 h after initiation of isovolemic continuous hemodiafiltration. Six of 8 survived patients did not need any mechanical fluid removal and any increment of injected vasopressors and were successfully weaned from continuous hemodiafiltration. Median length of duration using continuous hemodiafiltration was 4.6 days and length of stay in ICU was 20 days. Among the survived patients, mean serum creatinine before discharge was 2.9 mg/dl and mean eGFR was 23.0 ml/min/1.73 m 2 .CONCLUSIONS. Isovolemic continuous hemodiafiltration for ADHF patients with refractory oliguria might produce beneficial effects of dieresis without hemodynamic compromise and renal dysfunction.PROGRESSION OF ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY IN CRITICALLY ILL ICU PATIENTS. RISK FACTORS AND IMPACT ON MORTALITY P. Kontou 1 , A. Giakamozis 1 , A. Lavrentieva 1 , G. Vasiliadou 1 , M. Bitzani 1 1 G. Papanikolaou Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece INTRODUCTION. Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurrence rate, etiological factors and impact on morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients are evaluated in numerous recent studies. The impact of progression of acute kidney injury on mortality and the risk factors for the progression have not been sufficiently analysed in prospective clinical studies.OBJECTIVES. To apply the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage kidney disease) criteria to critically ill ICU patients and to evaluate the overall incidence of AKI, the progression of AKI and the risk factors that influence the progression of renal injury.METHODS. The predisposing factors for AKI development and for progress of non-failure AKI classes (Risk and Injury) to Failure class were evaluated. Intraabdominal pressure and lactate levels at the first diagnosis of AKI were recorded for each patient. The APACHE II and SAPS II scores were used to grade the illness severity. Sepsis was diagnosed according to current definition criteria. For the diagnosis of multiple organ dysfunction or failure, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA) was calculated. A corresponding organ SOFA subscore C3 was considered as organ failure.RESULTS. Data of 364 patients were studied. The incidence of AKI was 32.9% (120 patients). Patients with AKI had higher mortality than those without AKI (53.3 vs.14.3%, p = 0.001). Patients who progressed to higher RIFLE class (n: 40) had higher mortality rate compared to those who improved their renal function (n: 69), (77.5 vs. 34.8%, p = 0.01). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the independent risk factors for progression of AKI were the severity of organ dysfunction assessed by SOFA(OR 1.167, 95% CI 1.3-1.04, p = 0.008), the cardiac subscore of SOFA (OR 1.645, 95% CI 2.26-1.2, p \\ 0.001), the number of organ failures (OR 1.543, 95% CI 2.1-1.1, p = 0.003), the presence of septic shock (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.61-1.23, p = 0.02), the high intraabdominal pressure (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.36-1.09, p \\ 0.001) and the high lactate levels (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.36-1.09, p \\ 0.001) at the onset of AKI.CONCLUSIONS. We observed a high incidence of AKI in our patients. Presence of AKI and progression to more severe RIFLE classes influenced mortality of ICU patients. Sepsis associated multiple organ failure, abdominal hypertension and hyperlactatemia seem to contribute to the negative progression of AKI in critically ill patients.THE EFFECT OF ANTIOXIDANTS IN RENAL FUNCTION OF CRITICAL ILL PATIENTS UNDERGOING IMAGING STUDIES WITH INTRAVENOUS RADIO-OPAQUE AGENTS E.

Multivariable analysis showed successful coronary angioplasty to be an independent predictive factor of survival, regardless of the post-resuscitation ECG pattern (OR = 2.06; 95% CI[1.16-3.66]).CONCLUSIONS. Successful immediate coronary angioplasty is associated with improved hospital survival in patients with or without ST segment elevation. Our findings therefore support the use of immediate coronary angiography in survivors of out of hospital cardiac arrest with no obvious non cardiac cause of arrest regardless of the ECG pattern.THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA POST CARDIAC ARREST: A SURVEY OF CURRENT PRACTICE IN NORTHERN IRELAND INTENSIVE CARE UNITSD.

Wakatsuki 1 , A. Keeton 1 , D. Pogson 1 1 Queen Alexandra Hospital, Department of Critical Care, Portsmouth, UK INTRODUCTION. International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) guidelines[1]  recommend therapeutic hypothermia (TH) for patients with out of hospital (OOH) ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT) to improve neurological outcome. Intravascular cooling device (IVCD), Icycath \u00d2 was introduced in 2009 in our hospital in addition to protocolised care of TH. OBJECTIVES. To audit the effectiveness of IVCD in adhering to the local[2]  and ILCOR guidelines for therapeutic hypothermia. METHODS. A retrospective audit of the patients admitted with cardiac arrest to the Department of Critical Care (DCC) at Portsmouth Hospital in 2009 was conducted. Our standards included 100% of eligible patients after OOH VF/VT should undergo TH. During TH, 100% should achieve: target temperature (34\u00b0C) within 4 h, to be maintained in target range (32-34\u00b0C) for at least 12 h, and re-warmed at a rate of 0.25-0.5\u00b0C/h. Furthermore, no patient should have temperature \\31\u00b0C during TH and C38\u00b0C within 48 h after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). RESULTS. 70 patients (26(37%) OOH VF/VT, 7(10%) in-hospital (IH) VF/VT, 14(20%) OOH non-VF/VT, 23(33%) IH non-VF/VT) were admitted to DCC in 2009 after cardiac arrest. 100% of eligible OOH VF/VT patients underwent TH. In total, 28 patients received TH (23 OOH VF/VT, 3 OOH non-VF/VT and 2 IH VF/VT). Of those, IVCDs were used in 23(82%) patients.",

Chaudhry 1 , S. Anipindi 1 1 Midstaffordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, Department of Anaesthesia, Stafford, UK INTRODUCTION. Sudden Cardiac Arrest is the leading cause of death today. 1 There is paucity of appropriate guidelines for OHCA patients admitted to Critical Care after Return of Spontaneous Circulation(ROSC). 2 Survival to Critical Care and Hospital discharge after successful resuscitation is an understudied subject and warrants attention. OBJECTIVES. To study the effect of Age,APACHE 2 Score, Mean Arterial Blood Pressure, Hypothermia, Cardiac Index and Glycaemic control during post resuscitation period on Critical Care and Hospital survival in patients admitted to Critical Care subsequent to ROSC after OHCA. METHODS. Retrospective analysis of data pertinent to 46 patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit after resuscitation from OHCA between 2006 and 2008. Logistic (log linear) model was used to analyse Age, APACHE 2 Score, Mean Arterial Blood Pressure, Hypothermia, Cardiac Index and Glycaemic control affecting Critical Care(CCU) and Hospital survival of these patients. Wald test was used to verify the significance of each parameter individually and in combination with all other variables. Both dependent variables (Survival from CCU and from Hospital) were analyzed and the results summarized separately. RESULTS.

Of 19/66 patients who survived C24 h with stable circulatory conditions permitting neurological evaluation, four became conscious and were transferred for further cardiac assistance, while three became organ donors. Ultimately, one patient survived without neurologic sequelae after cardiac transplantation. Using multivariate analysis, only pre-cannulation peripheral venous oxygen saturation (SpvO 2 , 28% [15-52]) independently predicted inability to maintain targeted ECLS conditions C24 h (odds ratio for each 10%-decrease [95%-confidence interval]: 1.65 [1.21; 2.25], p = 0.002). The area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve was 0.78 [0.63; 0.93]. SpvO 2 cut-off value of 33% was associated with a sensitivity of 0.68 [0.50; 0.83] and specificity of 0.81 [0.54; 0.96]. SpvO 2 B8%, lactate concentration C21 mmol/l, fibrinogen B0.8 g/l, and prothrombin index B11% predicted premature ECLS discontinuation with a specificity of 1.CONCLUSIONS. SpvO 2 is useful to predict the inability of maintaining refractory cardiac arrest victims on ECLS without detrimental capillary leak and multiorgan failure until neurological evaluation.PROGNOSIS OF ELDERLY PATIENTS AFTER SUCCESSFUL RESUSCITATIONFOR CARDIAC ARREST D.

The source of infection was: 53.1% respiratory, 30.6% abdominal (others: 10.2%). 28.6% of the patients required urgent surgery. 39.6% had bacteremia. 49% infections were caused by gram positives, 18.4% gram negative and 2% virus (remaining unknown). The mean delay of ACP infusion was 23 h. 68.8% of treatments were finished without interruption, 8.3% were temporarily stopped and 23% were not finished (mortality: 16.7%). 25% patients had bleeding events. There was no therapy-related death. ICU stay was 20.5 \u00b1 20.1 (1-94) days and 44.1 \u00b1 37.1 days in hospital. Respiratory failure duration was 10.2 \u00b1 13.8 days (16.4 \u00b1 18.8 days of mechanical ventilation), hemodynamic failure 4.9 \u00b1 3.1 days and renal failure 9.5 \u00b1 9.9 days. Mortality: 38.8% (ICU), 42.9% (hospital). Statistically significant factors related to mortality were (univariable analysis): organ dysfunction(2 vs. [2) 4.8 vs. 66.7% (p = 0.034), APC indication (MOD vs. MOD + APACHEII [ 25) 38.1 vs. 61.9% (p = 0.005), renal failure 95.2 vs. 4.8% (p = 0.002), PaO 2 /FiO 2 relation (208.8 vs. 152.1, p = 0.05), amount of vasopressors (2.3 vs. 0.6 mcg/kg/min; p = 0.002), pH (7.3 vs. 7.2, p = 0.003), bicarbonate (22.3 vs. 18.6, p = 0.01, base deficits (-3.6 vs. 8.5, p = 0.003), APACHEII (18.9 vs. 25.1, p = 0.03) and ICU stay (25.2 vs. 14.1, p = 0.00).",

The Medical Assessment Unit (MAU) in our District General Hospital (with 500 beds) provides assessment and treatment of acute medical patients from General Practice (GP) referals and the Emergency Department (ED). Patients arriving in MAU are first triaged by the nurses before assessment by junior doctors. The Early Warning Score (EWS) is an indepenently verified scoring systems used to prioritise patient assessment. Appropriate referal to Critical Care Outreach teams and Intensive Care Units can be triggered by nurses or doctors according to the EWS score. Clear and seemless referal pathways and communication between those involved with acutely unwell patients is essential. OBJECTIVES. To measure key performance indicators in the MAU and identify specific areas for improvement. METHODS. Retrospective audit of all admissions to Medical Assessment Unit during 1 week in 2009. The following parameters were recorded for 149 patients admitted. Patient ages ranged from 16 to 94: [3. Of these, only 4 were reviewed within 1 h. 7. 100% of patients reviewed within 15 min. CONCLUSIONS. In the UK, early warning scores have been developed to trigger early review. The most sophisticated intensive care becomes unnecessarily expensive terminal care when the pre-ICU system fails to refer in a timely manner. Our results showed that when a patient was recognised as being unwell, they were seen rapidly by the outreach team. However, not all new admissions had their EWS documented, overlooking an important opportunity to risk stratify patients before formal medical clerking. Our Critical Care Outreach team have prominent role in education to identify abnormal physiology early, and take action as appropriate. Immunological host reactions are primarily believed to determine the clinical course of this disease. An overwhelming inflammatory response to microbial invasion may be involved in the pathogenesis of SIRS, sepsis and multiple organ failure. It is important to block the inflammatory response and stop or alleviate sepsis injuries. Immunotherapy is regarded as effective approach to improve the immunological function. OBJECTIVES. Immunomodulation in the critically ill is an appealing notion because of the abnormal immune responses. The aim of this study is to evaluate the immunomodulation and its mechanism to improve immune function and prognosis in sepsis. METHODS. Experimental part:CLP model were divided into three groups including sham group, control group and experimental group. Control group only used antibiotic and experimental group used antibiotic plus immunomodulation. Blood collection were made after CLP model in 3, 12, 24 and 48 h. Lymphocyte counting, CD 4 +, CD 8 + T lymphocyte and CD 4 /CD 8 ratio were checked. The apoptosis of lymphocyte in thymus and spleen and survival rate were checked. Clinical part: Prospective analysis seventy patients conformed to the enrolled standard. It was divided into two groups at random. One was control group with regular therapy, the therapy group with Ulinastatin plus Thymosin-a 1 in a week. The immune index before and after therapy in the 0, 1st, 3rd, 7thday was observed. RESULTS. Experimental part: Lymphocyte, CD 4 + T lymphocyte and CD 4 /CD 8 ratio in experimental group increased more significant than in control group (P \\ 0.05). Lymphocyte apoptosis index of thymus and spleen in control group increased more significant than in experimental group (P \\ 0.05).72 h-survival rate in experimental group was higher than in control group. Clinical part: CD 4 + T lymphocyte, Lymphocytes and HLA-DR CD 14 + had more significant increase in therapy group than in control group (P \\ 0.05). Twenty patients died in the control group and thirteen patients died in the therapy group (P \\ 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. Immunomodulation in sepsis can improve immune function and alleviate the lymphocyte apoptosis and extend the survival time. In recent years, the antiinflammatory effects of niacin by reducing nuclear factor jB (NF-jB) activation have attracted attention. However, the protective effects of niacin on the development of acute lung injury and systemic inflammatory response during sepsis have not been studied.OBJECTIVES. We performed this study to determine whether niacin attenuates acute lung injury (ALI) and improves survival during sepsis and the beneficial effects of niacin are associated with the down-regulation of NF-jB pathway.METHODS. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a dosage of 10 mg/kg was injected into the tail vein to induce endotoxemia in rats. Then, vehicle, low dose niacin (360 mg/kg), or high dose niacin (1180 mg/kg) diluted in distilled water with same volume (3 ml/kg) was administered once to the rats through orogastric tube, respectively. We observed the survival of the subjects. At 6 h post-LPS injection, we measured serum tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, lung cytoplasmic phosphorylated inhibitor jB-a (p-IjB-a), IjB-a, nuclear NF-jB p65 expressions, NF-jB p65 DNA-binding activity, and ALI occurrence.RESULTS. High dose niacin improved survival during sepsis. Niacin induced dose-dependent reduction of serum TNF-a, IL-6 levels, lung cytoplasmic p-IjB-a, nuclear NF-jB p65 expressions, NF-jB p65 DNA-binding activity, and ALI occurrence in endotoxemic rats. In contrast, niacin preserved lung cytoplasmic IjB-a expression dose-dependently in endotoxemic rats.CONCLUSIONS. Niacin attenuated acute lung injury and improved survival during sepsis in rats. The protective effects of niacin were associated with the down-regulation of NF-jB pathway. Niacin can be considered as a therapeutic agent for sepsis.",

Peris 3 1 University of Florence, Postgraduate School of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Florence, Italy, 2 University of Florence, Department of Critical Care Medicine and Surgery, Florence, Italy, 3 Careggi Teaching Hospital, Anesthesia and Intensive Care Unit of Emergency Department, Florence, Italy INTRODUCTION. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a frequent complication in critically ill patients. There is emerging evidence that AKI can lead to chronic kidney disease and that even only partial renal recovery after AKI is associated with a higher long-term mortality.OBJECTIVES. We investigated whether measurement of renal resistive index (RRI) by ultrasound could predict renal function recovery after AKI.METHODS. RRI has been determined in patients who had been admitted (Jan 2008 -Feb 2010 to our mixed Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and referral trauma center (Careggi Teaching Hospital, Florence, IT) and developed AKI. RRI measurements were performed within 24 h from AKI diagnosis, according to RIFLE criteria. Renal recovery was defined as the return to the normal renal function parameters.RESULTS. Patients studied were 38 (29 male vs. 9 female) with a mean age of 58.9 \u00b1 20.9 years. AKI was due to sepsis (n = 11), shock (n = 8), rhabdomyolysis (n = 7), abdominal compartment syndrome (n = 8) and major surgery (n = 4). Mean length of ICU stay was 17 \u00b1 12 days. At discharge 18 patients showed a complete recovery of renal function, while 20 patients had persistent altered renal function parameters or needed renal replacement therapy (RRT); mortality rate was 18.4% (7/38) . RRI measured at AKI onset was significantly higher in patients with persistence of renal failure than in patients with complete renal recovery (0.89 \u00b1 0.13 vs. 0.72 \u00b1 0.14, p \\ 0.001). RRI [ 0.75 had a sensitivity of 81% (95% CI 67-90%), a specificity of 70% (95% CI 53-82%) and a positive likelihood ratio of 2.75 (95% ) for persistent renal dysfunction at the discharge.CONCLUSIONS. Our findings suggest that Doppler-based determination of RRI at the onset of AKI can identify those patients who are at greater risk for no complete recovery of renal function. Further studies on larger populations are required to confirm these preliminary results so to promote therapies dedicated to this high risk population.CONCLUSIONS. APACHE2 score on admission, Hypothermia and Mean Arterial pressure are not statistically significant, but Age approached significance at 10% level in CCU survival. Blood Sugar Control is not statistically significant at 5% level but approached significance as p value was less than 0.10 for CCU survival. For Hospital survival,age is significant at 5% level; Apache2 score on admission and Mean Arterial Pressure are significant at 10% level while Cardiac Index, Hypothermia and Glycaemic control are not statistically significant . In 2008 the Intensive Care Society (ICS) published a care bundle for the management of patients following cardiac arrest 1 . The American Heart Association now recommends regionalisation of post-resuscitation care following out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), in a centre capable of providing rapid therapeutic hypothermia, 24 h emergency angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as necessary 2 . OBJECTIVES. The audit's purpose was to evaluate work load, treatment and outcomes of OHCA on the ICU following publication of the ICS care bundle and inception of a 24 h PCI service in our hospital. METHODS. Retrospective audit of OHCA patients admitted to ICU from 12/2008 to 12/2009 to examine number admitted, cause of arrest, treatment and mortality. Predicted mortality from the ICNARC model 3 was used to calculated standardised mortality ratio (SMR). Comparison was made with an audit of OHCA patients between 03/2007 and 03/2008. The sample was subdivided into subgroups with cardiac and non-cardiac cause for OHCA. The Chi-square test was used in analysis. RESULTS. COMPARISON CONCLUSIONS. We demonstrated: 1. a significant increase both in the absolute number of OHCA and the proportion due to cardiac causes, due in part to in-region transfers for emergency angiography/PCI. 2. a significant increase in the use of angiography and PCI, increasing use of therapeutic hypothermia and IABP. 3. improved survival from previous audit. 4. better than predicted survival, particularly in the 'cardiac' group. This audit lends support for the protocolised ICU care of post-OHCA patients in a regional centre able to offer 24 h emergency PCI. There is scope for increased use of cooling for arrests of all causes, and extending provision of angiography/PCI to VF arrests and those of unknown cause 2 . REFERENCE(S). 1 . Despite all the research, education and training that has gone into the field of CPR during the last 50 years, survival rates remain bleak for the majority of patients 2 . So, what is lost in translation? Much of the problem is that what the medical community is being trained to do is not being replicated in clinical practice 3 . Given this discrepancy, along with the deleterious outcomes, we conducted a manikin-based study to assess the quality of ventilation delivered during simulated CPR, in a large UK centre. OBJECTIVES. To demonstrate whether UK-based medical personal were adhering to ventilation guidelines and to see how this result varied across specialities. METHODS. A simulated cardiac arrest scenario was undertaken by 97 (a-0.05, Power-90%) participants from a range of medical specialties. Participants were asked to asynchronously ventilate our manikin for a period of 1 min during which time Tidal Volumes (TV), Minute Volume (MV) and Ventilation rates (VR) were recorded. To help limit outside influence, at no point during the trial was any feedback about ventilation technique or ALS principals discussed with the participant. RESULTS. The mean and SD across the sample population for the MV, VR and TV were 13.1 L min -1 (SD 7.3), 21.2 min -1 (SD 9.1) and 647 ml (SD 170) respectively. Comparison of groups can be seen in Table 1 INTRODUCTION. Mild hypothermia reduces cerebral blood flow (CBF) without concurrent increase of cerebral oxygen extraction rate in the first 24 h after cardiac arrest, indicating a lower cerebral metabolic activity with a preserved metabolic coupling.OBJECTIVES. The aim of this study was to assess the cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen extraction in patients treated with prolonged hypothermia, as previously was performed in newborn infants with perinatal asphyxial encephalopathy 1 .",

In this prospective observational study 9 comatose patients after cardiac arrest were treated with prolonged hypothermia for 72 h. After 72 h patients were passively rewarmed. Mean flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MFV MCA ), reflecting CBF, was measured after 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96 and 108 h after admission to the ICU by transcranial Doppler (TCD). Jugular bulb oxygenation (SjbO 2 ) and arterial oxygenation were measured at intervals of 6 h. INTRODUCTION. Isoflurane is a volatile anesthetic known for its direct vasodilating effect on cerebral vessels, producing a CBF increase. Moreover, it has been shown in animal studies that Isoflurane has neuroprotective properties, inducing tolerance to ischemia when used as a preconditioning agent. At the present time, Isoflurane is not used as a sedative agent in NeuroICU because of the fear of an increase in Intracranial Pressure (ICP) caused by the increase in CBF. However, SAH patient at risk for vasospasm may benefit from an increase in CBF. The ischemic risk will peak at day 5-7, leaving a window of opportunity for neuroprotection.",

The small population of this pilot study phase causes a lack in statistical significance, however our data already suggest that Isoflurane induces a marked cerebral vasodilatation and an increase in rCBF compared to Propofol.

AT SHORT AND LONG TERM AND ITS CORRELATION WITH SEVERITY SCALES,  SCALES OF QUALITY OF LIFE AND ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT  M There is not a consensus about which scales should be used to define the outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. OBJECTIVES. The purpose of this study was to determine the risk factors and impact on functional outcome and quality of life 6 months after spontaneous SAH due to ruptured intracranial aneurysms. METHODS. We performed a prospective study of 46 patients with aneurysmal spontaneous SAH admitted to our centre from July 2008 to August 2009. Diagnosis of SAH was done by CT and ethiological diagnosis by brain angiography. We paid attention to previous pathological history, clinical characteristics at admission and radiological characteristics. The severity was measured by the Hunt-Hess (HH), WFNS, GRAEB and Fisher scales. The 6 months outcome was assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and modified Rankin scale. The basic activities of daily living were evaluated with the Barthel Index. Moreover, patients were asked about their subsequent incorporation to their previous occupation. We divided our population into two groups depending on the clinical grade at admission (Hunt-Hess scale): Group I, HH 1, 2 or 3; and group 2, HH 4 or 5. Long-term followed up continues. RESULTS. During the year of study a total of 46 patients have been included. The mean age of patients was 55 years with a prevalence of 65% in women, being arterial hypertension and smoking history the main factors of related risk. The angiography was performed in 95.6% of the patients. An aneurysm was confirmed as the origin of the bleeding in 78.3%. Poor clinical grade at admission (HH 4 or 5) was associated with APACHE II, SOFA, glucose, more SAH computed tomography on admission, and infection and ICU stay. There is 29% mortality in the series. After a 6 months period, group 2 patients (HH 4 or 5 grade) had a severe disability and functional dependence to perform instrumental and basic activities of daily living (p = 0.001). Only 35% of patients were able to return to their previous occupation 6 months after the initial bleeding.",

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) remains a therapeutic challenge due to unacceptably high levels of mortality and morbidity.

Traumatic SAH (tSAH) occurs in as high as 60% of patients with TBI, and is associated with a twofold increase in risk of death. Statins may be an alternative for conventional treatments of vasospasm due to their beneficial pleiotropic effects on cerebral vasomotor reactivity as well as absence of negative haemodynamic influence.OBJECTIVES. The goal of our study was to examine the effects atorvastatin therapy on cerebral vasospasm after aSAH and tSAH as well as on short term outcomes of ICU patients (length of stay and severity of condition upon discharge from ICU).

Interventions In the intervention group, blood pressure will be raised with norepinephrine or additional dobutamin in case of low cardiac output. When clinical improvement occurs, hypertension will be continued for 48 h, after which the dose norepinephrine will be tapered daily, but resumed in case of clinical deterioration. When no clinical improvement occurs within 24 h, induced hypertension will not be continued. Patients in the reference group will be treated according to the standardised SAH treatment protocol of the participating centre including oral nimodipine and normovolaemia without haemodilution. Main outcome measurement The modified Rankin scale at 3 months after the SAH, will be compared between patients who were randomized to induced hypertension and patients who were randomized to no induced hypertension.

PaO 2 , PaCO 2 , ICP and CPP were comparable between groups. GLU art was 5.3 \u00b1 0.6 mmol/l in Group I, 7.5 \u00b1 1.1 mmol/l in Group II, 11.8 \u00b1 1.2 mmol/l in Group III and 16.6 \u00b1 2.9 mmol/l in Group IV.

Arterial blood glucose elevation has led to significant increase in brain glucose levels. But brain glucose levels were in normal ranges during hyperglycemia. Glucose levels in ''intact'' brain tissue: 1.16 \u00b1 0.79 mmol/l (Group II), 1.76 \u00b1 1 mmol/l (Group III), 1.24 \u00b1 0.53 mmol/l (Group IV).

We didn't find out any significant differences in L/P ratio at different blood glucose levels. However, low glucose levels in ''intact'' brain tissue (B1.4 mmol/l; 0.7\u00b10.4 mmol/l; n = 123) were accompanied by significant increase of L/P ratio (34.2\u00b115.8 vs. 27.6\u00b111.4 at normal brain glucose levels (C1.5 mmol/l; 2.3\u00b10.7 mmol/l; n = 54)). We didn't notice any significant differences in L/P ratio in ''lesioned'' brain tissue at different brain glucose levels, opposite to intact brain tissue.

Hyperglycemia is not accompanied by high glucose levels and brain metabolism impairment in ''intact'' and ''lesioned'' brain tissue in severe patients with aneurismal SAH.

The Codman TM strain-gauge catheter was used in all cases, 20 (87%) were male, 3 (13%) were female. Mean age was 36 years (range 14-86). Median reported GCS at the scene of injury was 3 (range 3-15), median GCS prior to intubation was 7 (range 3-15). Median APACHE score was 16 (range 5-36). All patients were discussed with the neurosurgical referral centre. Patients were monitored for a median of 2 days (range [1] [2] [3] [4] . ICP was raised in 15 patients (65%). Elevation of ICP triggered the following interventions: 13 patients (87%) received hyperosmolar agents, 8 patients (53%) were treated with therapeutic hypothermia, 2 patients (13%) with barbiturate coma and none of the patients received steroids. 5 patients were transferred to a neurosurgical centre (33% of patients with elevated ICP, 22% of total). Complications comprised one minor intracranial haematoma and one monitor failure. Review of documented care bundles for head-injury patients revealed: Head-up tilt in 96%, gastric protection in 91%, normoglycaemia in 91%, early enteral nutrition in 96%, appropriate thromboprophylaxis in 87%, appropriate sedation in 96% and appropriate analgesia in 96%. 87% survived to hospital discharge.CONCLUSIONS. In our audit the majority of patients received specific treatment for raised ICP, which might have gone undetected without invasive ICP monitoring. At the same time most patients were managed without neurosurgical intervention. In light of the paucity of neurocritical care beds [2] this approach appears to help to select a suitable subgroup of patients needing transfer to a specialist centre. Our data adds weight to the evidence that ICP monitoring is a valuable and safe monitoring modality in a non-neurosurgical ICU if used appropriately within established guidelines and in collaboration with a neurosurgical referral centre.

Mean PbO 2 was calculated for the duration of their intensive care admission. At a median of 11.6 months (range 237-702 days) they underwent magnetic resonance imaging, including DTI. Apparent diffusion coefficient ADC (maps) were created, ADC calculated in regions of interest in the frontal lobes, splenium of the corpus callosum and thalami, and correlated with mean PbO 2 using Spearman's Rho. Ethical approval was obtained from the Local Research Ethics Committee, and assent from next-of-kin was obtained in all cases.RESULTS. Mean PbO 2 was inversely related to ADC in both frontal lobes (r = -0.73 and -0.72; p = 0.025 and 0.031), and with the ADC in the thalamus bilaterally (r = -0.87 and -0.80; p = 0.002 and p = 0.010). In contrast, no correlation was seen between mean PbO 2 and ADC in the splenium of the corpus callosum, a common site of traumatic axonal injury (TAI; p = 0.265).CONCLUSIONS. The inverse correlation of mean PbO 2 associated with ADCs in the monitored brain region is unsurprising, but the correlations observed with contralateral regions and deep grey matter suggest that the burden of tissue hypoxia has a significant impact on secondary neuronal loss across the brain. In contrast, the lack of correlation with ADC changes in an area at risk of TAI suggests a less significant impact of hypoxia on the progression or maturation of TAI. The correlations with measures of thalamic microstructural injury are particularly significant, since they establish a clear link between acute physiology, tissue fate in key brain regions, and clinical outcome. INTRODUCTION. Earlier studies have suggested that autonomic dysfunction is associated with poor outcome in traumatic brain injury (TBI).OBJECTIVES. This study was performed to assess changes in baroreceptor sensitivity and heart rate variability as indices of autonomic dysfunction in relation to ICU management variables during early TBI.METHODS. Ten patients (3 females/7 males) with a median age of 31 (interquartile range, IQR, 20-51) admitted to ICU following TBI were prospectively studied for the first consecutive 6 days. All patients were sedated and mechanically ventilated with ICP monitoring in place. High fidelity signals at 300 Hz were sampled for ECG and invasive arterial pressure (radial) to monitor baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS) based on three or more consecutive beats in which successive systolic pressure and RR intervals increased or decreased with the threshold set at 1 mmHg and 5 ms, respectively. Heart rate variability (HRV) was analysed by Fourier transformation in the low (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequency (HF, 0.15-0.4 Hz) domains. The LF/HF ratio and total power (0.01-0.6 Hz) were also calculated for HRV. Management variables included use of inotropes, vasopressors, ICP, use of decompressive craniectomy, ICU length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Statistical significance was set at p \\ 0.05 using Mann-Whitney one-way ANOVA and Spearman correlation tests.",

Extracranial organ dysfunctions are extremely common in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Although it has been shown that development of TBIinduced multiple organ failure (MOF) is associated with a poor outcome, the underlying mechanisms leading to MOF after TBI have not been investigated.OBJECTIVES. To investigate in vitro the effect of plasma from TBI patients developing different degrees of organ failure on human endothelial cells.METHODS. Ten consecutive severe TBI patients were included. GCS, ISS and SOFA score were recorded at admission; SOFA was also recorded after 2 days. Plasma samples were obtained at the same time points. Adhesion of freshly isolated human neutrophils on spontaneously transformed human umbelical vein endothelial cells (ECV 304) was evaluated after 4 h in vitro stimulation with 10% of plasma collected from TBI patients 2 days after admission. Expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was assessed by immunofluorescence. To determine the impairment of the endothelial cell barrier function, trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and permeability to FITC-dextran were measured. Plasma from healthy volunteers were used as control. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. Results from different experiments were compared by unpaired t test.RESULTS. Ten male patients were enrolled, mean age 35 \u00b1 15, GCS 7 \u00b1 1, ISS 32 \u00b1 9, SOFA was 5.3 \u00b1 1.8 on admission and 8 \u00b1 1.6 on day 2. Plasma derived from TBI patients increased the adhesion of neutrophils on ECV 304 cells (80 \u00b1 15 vs. 48 \u00b1 7 cells/field, p \\ 0.01), induced a significant reduction of TEER (130.1 \u00b1 1.8 ohm/cm 2 vs. 139.1 \u00b1 1.9 ohm/cm 2 , p \\ 0.001) and caused a concomitant increase of endothelial permeability to dextran (132.5 \u00b1 27.2 vs. 97.5 \u00b1 7.2%, p \\ 0.05) compared to control (healthy plasma). A visual up-regulation of ICAM-1 expression was also observed. There was a significant correlation between delta SOFA score (day 2-day 0), calculated excluding GCS, and neutrophil adhesion on endothelial cells exposed to plasma from TBI patients (p = 0.009, R 2 = 0.70).CONCLUSIONS. Plasma from patients with TBI causes the increase of endothelial permeability and neutrophil adhesion, which correlates with the development of extracranial organ dysfunction expressed by SOFA. These results suggest a mechanism potentially responsible for the development of MOF after traumatic brain injury.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGMENT.

Nine relatives of people hospitalized for at least 24 h in ICU were interviewed. The data were analyzed by the use of procedures of analysis of Grounded Theory. RESULTS. The hospitalization of a family member in ICU produced discomfort for her, as the uncertainty of recovery, the fear of loss and the sudden physical separation of the relative. The interaction between the huge discomfort of life threat and the separation from the relative, in turn, spawned other discomforts in the daily lives of families, expressed by two categories. The first one, having difficulties to answer psychobiological needs, meant for the family member the experience of sleep deprivation, loss of appetite and constant concern with the relative. The second one, suffering a discontinuity in the daily life, meant to the family the disruption of daily activities with the relative, irritability front other family members, removal of the routine of home, loss on work performance and studies and difficulties to enjoy the leisure and recreation.CONCLUSION. The coping of illness and hospitalization of a relative in intensive care produced discomfort for family members, characterized by changing of the routine of the daily life and care for oneself. The family's attention is primarily directed toward the ill relative. It starts to experience the routine of a hospital and disrupts the organization of familiar and personal life, it finds itself suffering a break from daily life.

This is a qualitative study of inductive nature. Data was collected along the time of the study by in-depth interviews, to six relatives of each patient, after discharge the intensive care unit. For data analysis we followed the steps of the phenomenological method, according to Max van Manen (1990) . RESULTS. From data analysis, the results were divided in 5 categories: 1) Relative needs; 2) ICU environment; 3) relative's Feeling; 4) Nurses role and 5) Suggestions. All this categories were grouped in a central theme called ''Being a relative in a general intensive care unit''. The results show that relatives of patients admitted to the intensive care unit often require complete knowledge of the medical condition of the patient, a specific area for that purpose and a comfortable waiting room. They express the need to be near the patient and participate in care. They feel fear and anger with the situation that inevitably are forced to live and think, mostly, that nurses are effective and efficient in meeting the needs of the patient and family. CONCLUSIONS.

The comfort is a positive, subjective and dynamic experience, which changes in time and space, which is the result of the interactions that the individual sets with himself, with those around him and with the situations he faces, without losing view that every family is unique and can experience this process in a proper way.

The data were collected in four ICUs in the city of Feira de Santana, Bahia, Brazil, after approval by ethics and research committees. All 20 clinical nurses of ICUs were interviewed. The Brazilian adaptation of the Critical Care Family Need Inventory (INEFTI) was used for measuring the degree of importance of 43 needs of family members, valued at increasing levels from 1 to 4. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis, needs with a mean score [3 were defined as having the greatest importance.RESULTS. The nurses identified 70% of needs as important for family members. The items related to Security ''to be sure that the best possible treatment is being offered to the patient'' (3.90 \u00b1 0.31), and the Information ''to talk to the doctor every day'' (3.80 \u00b1 0.41), were pointed out as the most important, with consistent results with the literature. Some needs of Support ''to have general guidelines on the ICU at the first visit'' (3.80 \u00b1 0.41) and Comfort ''to have a bathroom near the waiting room'' (3.20 \u00b1 0.76) were also identified as important. However, the needs of Proximity, like being close to their relative was not identified as important to the family for all nurses.CONCLUSIONS. The nurses identified the need for security and information as important, however the wish that the family has to be near their relative was not considered important, as described in the literature 1, 2, 3 . A movement of nursing towards the family can be perceived, so nurses should plan their interventions based on knowledge of the demands of the family in order to promote care for the relief of immediate distress and anguish, which will consequently encourage the recovery of the ill relative REFERENCE(S). Nurse Educator, realized that with an ongoing critical care nursing shortage world wide, even when retention is high, some turnover is inevitable necessitating an orientation tool to guide charge nurses in assigning new hires to critically ill patients. Impetus for this clinical orientation tool arose from observations that new hires were often overwhelmed or disengaged at the bedside, and patient assignments did not consistently foster the development of critical care skills.",

(1) has previously been claimed to show an association between improvement of score (or lack of) over time and survival status (2) . Severe sepsis in patients is associated with considerable mortality. Activated Protein C (APC) is a mediator of the inflammatory and coagulation systems, which has shown decreased mortality in severe sepsis (3) Beyond 48 h SOFA scores showed further distinct improvement over the APC infusion period in the Survivor group, whereas minimal improvement was seen in the Non survivors.Change in daily SOFA scores CONCLUSIONS. Our analysis appears to agree with Levy's previous findings of increasing SOFA (albeit modified) scores and mortality. We, however, looked at a different treatment period, (APC infusion rather than first day of sepsis) but, nonetheless, found the same association of increasing score and mortality and decreasing score and survival. The mean age in survivor group was considerably less than that in non survivors and this age discrepancy largely accounts for the difference in mean APACHE score (3 points) between groups. The depicted trend in SOFA scores is more apparent beyond the initial 48 h of treatment, and suggests that improving SOFA scores and outcome prediction is possible beyond the previously reported 48 h. Our numbers are small, but lend support to the predictive potential of repetitive SOFA scores and outcome.OBJECTIVES. This real-life registry was implemented to describe clinical characteristics of patients treated with drotrecogin alfa (activated) (DAA) in France and the use of this drug.METHODS. This national multicenter observational study, proposed to intensive care units (ICUs) which used DAA, was conducted by data abstraction from hospital files of patients admitted in ICUs and treated by DAA. Two sets of data were obtained: a) retrospective data collected between January 1st, 2006 and beginning of the prospective phase in each site; b) prospective data for patients treated until November 2009. This current analysis aimed to describe the patients retrospectively enrolled and treated between January 2006 and April 2009. Statistical analysis was mainly descriptive. CONCLUSIONS. This study showed a good concordance between the target population and population treated by DAA in terms of treating patients with higher disease severity. Patients treated in real-life had a particularly severe sepsis as shown by the SAPS II score of 60 and high number of organ dysfunctions at time of infusion initiation. The 1-month observed mortality was lower than the predicted hospital mortality of 68% with this level of SAPS II. INTRODUCTION. Mortality in Severe sepsis is variously described, but is often up to 50% (1) . Activated Protein C (APC), a mediator of the inflammatory and coagulation system has shown a decrease of hospital mortality from 34.9 to 29.7% (2) At 1 year post APC we found that 23 patients (56%) out of 41 were still alive (5 patients are still less than 1 year post APC and therefore not eligible for consideration).",

This study is limited in size, but demonstrates further favourable evidence to support the administration of APC for patients with severe sepsis, and appears to contradict the Cochrane findings (3) . We have shown that our hospital survival has improved since initial report (4) . We attribute this improvement in SMR to better targeting of APC to the more severely ill septic patients (as evidenced by the increased APACHE score).Longer term survival data was also encouraging, 56% of our patients were alive at 1 year, post APC. This should be considered against an initial predicted survival to hospital discharge (never mind 1 year) of 47.5%. We find this result very promising, it would appear that initial survival advantage with APC is in fact sustained beyond hospital discharge. OBJECTIVES. Medication errors reported in a self reporting medical incident system were systematically analyzed to identify root causes and obtain preventive measures METHODS. All medication incidents received within 1 year in a 8-bed mixed ICU, were analyzed by 2 trained persons in analyzing medical adverse events. The systematic approach consisted of five steps. 1. Description of the incident in a causal tree. 2. All causes were classified into the 5 main categories according to the PRISMA 2 incident analysis tool (technical failure, organization failure, human failure, patient related and non classified). 3. All medication errors were categories into the 5 broad stages of medication process (prescription, transcription, preparation, dispensation and administration). 4. The recovery phase of all near miss were analyzed. 5. Development of an action matrix based on the most suitable solution (equipment, procedures, information/communication, training and motivation) for each root cause.",

So far, 125 persons have participated: 95 nurses and 30 medical doctors (8 were residents in training), all of them actively working in an ICU. In total, 74% of the respondents knew that a PiCCO CO measurement is performed intermittently by transpulmonal thermodilution and on a continuous basis by arterial pulse contour analysis. About 53% is convinced that a PiCCO measurement is an invasive procedure, while in fact it is considered minimally invasive. Opinions are divided upon the indications for PiCCO measurement. Some participants do not know that the measurement of extravascular lung water provides valuable additional information in pts with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and some even believe that PiCCO can also measure pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. The basic knowledge on CO calibration is insufficient: 50% do not know that the temperature of the injection fluid should best be below 8\u00b0C and only 6% know that the volume of the calibration fluid depends on the patients' weight. 63% faulty believe that the patient has to be in the supine position to perform a measurement and 75% is not informed on the fact that the CO obtained should not differ more than 15% from the mean CO value. Only 50% of the respondents carry out a rapid flush test before each PiCCO measurement and only 34% know that the calibration fluid has to be injected in less than 10 s to obtain a correct measurement. Finally, 33% believe that it is necessary to input the CVP value to calculate a correct CO, although 83% of the respondents correctly knew what to do in case the delta T\u00b0is too small and 85% could correctly interpret the 3 thermodilution curves displayed in the survey.CONCLUSIONS. From these data we can conclude that a big variation exists in the knowledge on the basic principles and the practical implementation of PiCCO measurements. Some confusion exists with regard to the terminology used. We conclude that (as with any new technique) high quality education on PiCCO measurements is necessary for ICU personnel. This education can be facilitated by a good protocol, that can be implemented by nurses and doctors at the bedside to avoid human errors.",

A cross-sectional surveyed of doctors and nurses in three intensive care units with various size, level of care and staff to patient ratio of Hong Kong hospitals. Totally 209 ICU doctors and nurses have been included in this study. A modification of Safety Attitudes Questionnaire developed by Sexton and colleagues in 2006 was adopted. RESULTS. The overall response rate was 64.11%. There were no significant difference of perception of teamwork and patient safety attitude among 3 studied ICU's doctors and nurses. However, ICU (A) and ICU (C)'s doctors demonstrated more positively and showed significant different in perceptions of teamwork (p = 0.014; 0.017) than nurses. Regarding patient safety attitude, ICU (A)'s doctor also showed significant difference (p = 0.018) and rated more positively than nurses working in the same clinical area. A highly statistically significant association between patient safety attitude and teamwork was shown in the Spearman rho statistics with r s (134) = 0.61, p = 0.000. CONCLUSIONS. The rate of agreement on teamwork and patient safety attitude were higher in ICU doctors. They were more likely to perceive effective teamwork and patient safety in the working area. Nurses tended to rate both items lower. As teamwork has been shown to have strongest relationship with patient safety issues, more attention should be given to improve teamwork for ICU nurses. TNF is upregulated within the alveolar space early in the course of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and plays a major role in the pathogenesis. We previously found in knockout mice that two TNF receptors play opposing roles during VILI, with p55 promoting but p75 preventing pulmonary oedema. This suggests that specific blockade of the p55 receptor within the alveoli is a potential therapeutic strategy for VILI. Domain antibodies (dAbs) are the smallest antigen-binding fragments of the IgG molecule, which may have advantages over complete antibodies due to their small size (short half life, enabling regional delivery) and monovalent binding (no receptor cross-linking). OBJECTIVES. We tested the effects of an intratracheally (i.t.) delivered dAb that binds to and inhibits the mouse p55 receptor (Biopharmaceutical R&D, GlaxoSmithKline), on pulmonary oedema and inflammation during VILI. METHODS. C57BL6 mice were ventilated with a high-stretch protocol (plateau pressure 12.5-13.5cmH 2 O, tidal volume 20-22 ml/kg, PEEP 3cmH 2 O, O 2 with 2-4% CO 2 ). Immediately after the start of high-stretch, mice were given an i.t. bolus of non-specific 'dummy' dAb or p55-specific dAb (25 lg in 50 ll) and ventilated for up to 4 h (1-hit model). As a 2-hit model, 20 ng LPS was included in the dAb bolus. Respiratory elastance (Ers) and blood gases were monitored, and BAL performed at termination. In the 2-hit model, lung cell suspension was analysed for intravascular margination of neutrophils (PMN), and BAL fluid (BALF) assessed for PMN infiltration and alveolar macrophage (AM) activation using flow cytometry. RESULTS. High-stretch ventilation produced deteriorations in Ers and PO 2 , and high BALF protein in both models. Treatment with the p55-specific dAb substantially attenuated all of these changes in the 1-hit model (Table 1 ). In the 2-hit model, p55 blockade prevented deteriorations in Ers and PO 2 , and significantly decreased PMN margination, intraalveolar PMN infiltration and ICAM-1 expression on AMs (Table 2) . INTRODUCTION. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) triggers a variety of molecular responses within the lungs. However, the contribution of these pathways to lung repair has not been identified.OBJECTIVE. To identify the molecular mechanisms involved in lung repair after VILI.METHODS. VILI was induced in mice by ventilation using high pressures (25 cmH 2 O) without PEEP for 90 min. After this, pressure was decreased to 15 cmH 2 O and PEEP increased to 2 cmH 2 O for 4 h more to promote lung repair. We quantified histological damage, protein content in alveolar lavage (BALF) and different molecules in lung tissue (collagen, matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9, TNFa, IFNc, IL-4, IL-10, MIP-2 and LIX) in the different conditions (baseline, after injury and after repair). Additionally, survivors and non-survivors to the repair phase were compared. The effects of the differentially released mediators were studied in a wound model using murine alveolar cells cultured in presence of BALF obtained from ventilated animals, and human alveolar cells and BALF from ventilated patients. Results were compared using an ANOVA, with a significance level of p = 0.05.",

So far, histological data on Critical Illness Myopathy (CIM) primarily refers to muscle biopsies taken during protracted critical illness (after weeks), repeatedly describing pronounced type-II muscle fibre atrophy.OBJECTIVES. We speculate that type-II fibre atrophy develops during early critical illness in patients with non-excitable muscle membrane which predicts CIM. (1) METHODS. Due to their elevated risk for CIM, critically ill patients with SOFA scores C8 on 3 of 5 consecutive days within the first 8 days after ICU admission were eligible for inclusion into this prospective, observational study. Preexisting IDDM or neuromuscular disorder, pregnancy, BMI C 35 kg/m 2 , age \\ 18 years, or pretreatment[4 days on other ICU constituted exclusion criteria. Surgical muscle biopsies were taken from vastus lateralis muscles between day 5 and 8 after first SOFA C 8 and postprocessed according to standard procedures (isopentane, liquid nitrogen, ATPase/toluidineblue staining). We assessed muscle membrane excitability after direct muscle stimulation, abnormal muscle membrane excitabilty indicating CIM (1). After quantifying fibre-type specific median cross sectional areas (CSA) with ImageJ-Software, we compared fibre-type specific CSA in patients with and without non-excitable muscle membrane.

Our findings demonstrate that nonexcitable muscle membrane indeed is associated with a histomorphological correlate previously linked to CIM. These results highlight the need to focus on early critically illness in order to investigate pathophysiological aspects of CIM. Bacterial sepsis is a major threat in neonates born prematurely, and is associated with elevated morbidity and mortality. Little is known on the innate immune response to bacteria among extremely premature infants. OBJECTIVES. Identify innate immune defect in premature infants as risk factor for the development of neonatal sepsis. METHODS. We compared innate immune functions to bacteria commonly causing sepsis in 21 infants of less than 28 wks of gestational age, 24 infants born between 28 and 32 wks of gestational age, 25 term newborns and 20 healthy adults. Levels of surface expression of innate immune receptors (CD14, TLR2, TLR4, and MD-2) for Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria were measured in cord blood leukocytes at the time of birth. The cytokine response to bacteria of those leukocytes as well as plasma-dependent opsonophagocytosis of bacteria by target leukocytes were also measured in the presence or absence of interferon-c. RESULTS. Leukocytes from extremely premature infants expressed very low levels of receptors important for bacterial recognition. Leukocyte inflammatory responses to bacteria and opsonophagocytic activity of plasma from premature infants were also severely impaired compared to term newborns or adults. These innate immune defects could be corrected when blood from premature infants was incubated ex vivo 12 h with interferon-c. CONCLUSIONS. Premature infants display markedly impaired innate immune functions, which likely account for their propensity to develop bacterial sepsis during the neonatal period. Maturation of the innate immune response to bacteria can be induced by interferon-c ex vivo and represents a promising strategy to prevent neonatal sepsis. The anaphylotoxin C5a impairs neutrophil phagocytosis in animals 1 and humans 2 with sepsis. Although dependency on the phosphoinositol 3-kinase delta (PI3Kd) pathway has been identified 2,3 , greater understanding of the mechanism will allow novel therapeutic options. OBJECTIVES.

These were investigated simultaneously, both by classical microbiology and microbial methods, using the system of pathogen-specific probes with Real Time PCR for 30 agents. Each sample was tested simultaneously with the universal PCR detection system for bacteria and fungi with the subsequent sequenation.RESULTS. An agreement between the two compared examination methods was found in 46% of samples and disagreement in 24% of the samples. 5% of the results were classified as ''not possible to interpret''. In 25% of the samples, MBM detected the presence of other agents, which were not confirmed by cultivation. In 50% of cases, the MDP results did not contribute to the decision to change the ATB. In 45% of cases, a modification of ATB treatment followed; a change, reduction or stopping the administration of the drug. In 5% of cases, ATB was changed without any direct connection to the results.

Concerning previous health status 49.3% were healthy and 5.2% were dependent for daily living activities. 34.5% were retired. More than 60% had new complaints after discharge. Only 39.6% of the previously professionally active patients resumed their work and only 49% of the retired were able to maintain their normal activity. Almost 40% of patients had new psychiatrics symptoms and only 8.7% were being followed by Psychiatry: 17% were on benzodiazepines and 9.5% on anti-depressants. 11.4% of the patients had symptoms suggestive of diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) having a PTSS-14 superior to 49. Regarding Beck Inventory, 38% were considered to have a depression, with 20.9% having moderate to severe depression. After the interview 21% were oriented to a psychiatric consultation. 72% of depressive patients had new symptoms (p \\ 0.01). Of the previously active patients who did not resume normal activities, a significant (p \\ 0.01) part was depressed (73.8%). The same is true for the retired patients (59.2%), p = 0.002. Longer Hospital and ICU lengths of stay were related with development of depression (p = 0.048 and p = 0.028, respectively). Patients with higher SAPSII were more prone to develop PTSD. Women had more PTSD than men (p = 0.003). Patients in risk of PTSD and depression were younger (p = 0.011; p = 0.009, respectively). As with depression these patients also had more new complains and did not return to work. INTRODUCTION. Mild hypothermia improves outcome after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Modes of action for it are manifold, though one way might be reduction of basal metabolic rate (BMR). Therapeutic hypothermia was able to reduce BMR in patients with traumatic brain injury and critically ill patients with fever.OBJECTIVES. In the present study we investigated the metabolic effect of therapeutic hypothermia in patients after successful CPR.METHODS. 25 patients after CPR were treated with therapeutic hypothermia (33\u00b0C) for 24 h and subsequently rewarmed with a rate of 0.4\u00b0C per hour until 36\u00b0C was reached. All patients received standardized sedoanalgetic medication and neuromuscular blockers. Indirect calorimetry was performed at 33, 34.5 and 36\u00b0C, as well as between 36.5 and 37.5\u00b0C and 48-72 h after CPR. For statistical analysis repeated measures ANOVA, linear and logistic regression were used.",

Therapeutic hypothermia (33\u00b0C) was associated with a reduction of BMR by 22 \u00b1 6% compared to 36\u00b0C. In this regard no difference was found between patients with good and bad neurological outcome (good outcome vs. bad outcome: 24 \u00b1 4 vs. 19 \u00b1 7%; p = 0.479). Concerning substrate oxidation rates only fat oxidation rate showed a temperature dependency (10 g/day/1.5\u00b0C; p \\ 0.0001). In contrast to protein oxidation rate (good outcome vs. bad outcome: 45 \u00b1 51 vs. 49 \u00b1 70 g/day; p = 0.751) patients with good neurological outcome had a significantly higher fat oxidation rate (good outcome vs. bad outcome: 144 \u00b1 57 vs. 110 \u00b1 47 g/day; p = 0.039) and a significantly lower glucose oxidation rate (good outcome vs. bad outcome: 21 \u00b1 77 vs. 74 \u00b1 99 g/day; p = 0.029) as compared to patients with bad neurological outcome.CONCLUSIONS. In patients after CPR mild therapeutic hypothermia (33\u00b0C) was associated with a reduction of BMR by 22%. A linear relation between temperature and BMR was detected. Fat oxidation rate was temperature dependent in contrast to protein and glucose oxidation rate. A significant difference in glucose and fat oxidation rates was found between patients with good and bad neurological outcome. OBJECTIVES. Our goal was to determine whether its institution after resumption of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) improves survival and neurological recovery in an experimental model of cardiac arrest in rabbits.METHODS. Ventricular fibrillation was induced in anesthetized rabbits. After 5-min of untreated fibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was attempted using external massage, electric shocks and intravenous epinephrine. After ROSC, rabbits randomly underwent either normothermic life support (Control group with conventional ventilation until weaning) or hypothermic support with rapid cooling (TLV group). In this last group, a 32\u00b0C hypothermia was induced by 20-min of TLV using a perfluorocarbon. Subsequently, the perfluorocarbon was removed from the lungs and rabbits were conventionally ventilated with maintenance of hypothermia during 3 h. Rabbits were further warmed and weaned from ventilation. In both groups, hemodynamic and biochemical parameters were monitored, as well as survival and neurological recovery. After 7 days, survivors were finally euthanized for post-mortem analyses. Neurological dysfunction was assessed by a 0-100% scoring system evaluating reflexes, postural reactions and behaviour (0%: no dysfunction; 100%: brain death).RESULTS. Ten rabbits were randomized to the control group and 10 to the TLV one. Defibrillation was obtained using 1.4 \u00b1 0.3 and 1.5 \u00b1 0.3 electric shocks, respectively. Subsequent ROSC was observed after 2.3 \u00b1 0.3 and 2.4 \u00b1 0.3 min, respectively. Oesophageal and tympanic temperatures were rapidly reduced in the TLV group, achieving 32.5 \u00b1 0.2 and 32.5 \u00b1 0.3\u00b0C within 30-min versus 37.5 \u00b1 0.5 and 37.1 \u00b1 0.3\u00b0C in Control, respectively. In the TLV group, rabbits returned to normothermia within 2-3 h after the hypothermic episode. Throughout follow-up, no significant difference in blood pressure was observed between both groups (e.g., 82 \u00b1 3 and 82 \u00b1 5 mmHg in Control vs. TLV at 1 h after cardiac arrest, respectively) whereas heart rate was decreased throughout hypothermia in TLV vs. Control (e.g., 174 \u00b1 6 vs. 221 \u00b1 7 beats/min at 1 h following cardiac arrest, respectively). Lactates's concentration and epinephrine dosages were not significantly different between groups. Importantly, neurological dysfunction was significantly attenuated in TLV vs. Control (e.g., 5 \u00b1 3 vs. 32 \u00b1 9% after 48 h). In Control, 5/10 (50%) rabbits survived throughout the follow-up and the others died or should be euthanized earlier following severe disability. In the TLV group, survival was significantly increased as 9/10 rabbits survived to the entire follow-up (90%).CONCLUSION. Ultra-fast cooling induced by TLV after ROSC improves survival and neurological recovery following 5-min of experimental cardiac arrest in rabbits.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGMENT. (CA) . TH involves at least 12 h of induced hypothermia (33-34\u00b0C), mechanical ventilation and sedation. TH may affect sedation through changes in pharmacology. Still, no clinical studies have investigated the use of sedation during TH. OBJECTIVE. To compare the efficacy of two sedation protocols for patients treated with TH. METHODS. Open, randomised, controlled, population based study of patients treated with TH (33-34 C for 24 h) after CA in two Norwegian university hospitals. Patients were randomised to sedation with remifentanil + propofol (RP) or fentanyl + midazolam (FM). Baseline characteristics (age, sex, BMI, SAPS-II) and cardiovascular variables during study drug infusion (blood pressure, heart rate, use of fluids, vasopressors and inotropic drugs) were recorded. The primary end point was defined as time from stop of sedation to extubation. RESULTS. Sixty patients were randomised. One patient was withdrawn by next of kin. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. For two patients in the RP group, and one in the FM group, study drugs were stopped shortly after allocation due to cardiovascular instability. The RP group had lower heart rates and more patients needed noradrenaline infusions than the FM group (57.3(14.4) (mean(SD)) vs. 66.2(15) beats/min, p = 0.05, and 21 vs. 10 patients, p = 0.004, respectively). Other circulatory variables were similar. Reasons to not stop sedation or not extubate after stop of sedation were; cessation of ICU treatment (n = 15), need for mechanical ventilation (n = 10), inadequate awakening (n = 6), seizures after stop (n = 4), and other (n = 4). Sedation was stopped according to protocol in 35 of 59 patients. Median (range) time from stop of sedation to extubation for the 17 patients who could be extubated according to protocol was 0.25 (0-0.72) vs. 12.7 (0. 5-26.4) h in the RP and FM group, respectively, p = 0.002. ''Cerebral performance category'' on day 13-15 was similar in the two groups.",

However, the benefit from a short time to extubation is limited by that only one-third of the patents can be extubated according to protocol. The RP group had lower heart rates and needed more noradrenaline. No major differences were observed for outcome.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGMENT. NTNU.",
