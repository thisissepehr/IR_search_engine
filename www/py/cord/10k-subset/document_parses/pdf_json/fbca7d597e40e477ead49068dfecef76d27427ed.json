During the early twentieth century, while British and other European countries expanded colonisation, this disease was recognised with increasing frequency in the native populations and in the soldiers who lived in the tropical areas of Asia and Africa [3] . During this time, it acquired the name by which it is now known widely-tropical pyomyositis. The suitability of this designation was confirmed by another epidemiological study from East Africa, which discovered that the disease was found commonly only in regions with a truly topical climate, i.e. a fairly constant high temperature and high relative humidity [4\u2022\u2022] .

But when muscle trauma is present, there is sequestration of elemental iron leading to predisposition for haematogenous invasion by bacteria with subsequent abscess formation [18] . The initial episode of trauma resulted in a staphylococcal skin lesion and, possibly, a bacteraemia that seeded sites of previously bruised muscle. Sources of muscle trauma have ranged from bicycle accidents to strenuous aerobic exercises [19] . These cases also may explain the predilection of the disease to occur in warmer humid climates, concomitant skin infections and muscle trauma, which is more likely to occur in a climate in which children can play or work outside wearing fewer cloths for most of the year.

Plain films may show a soft tissue swelling or even a widened fascial plane suggestive of a mass lesion, seldom useful in the diagnosis but appropriate to exclude any suspected bony pathology.

In early stages, TP may be treated conservatively with antibiotics alone or antibiotics and percutaneous aspiration. However, a surgical decompression may subsequently be required in 50 % of them [45\u2022 ]. An important role of systemic antibiotics is to prevent the formation of further abscesses, especially in children with proven bacteraemia. Empirical antimicrobial therapy for pyomyositis will depend upon local epidemiologic and susceptibility patterns. Because S. aureus is the most likely agent, a semisynthetic penicillinase-resistant penicillin should be the preferred antibiotic in communities with relatively little MRSA. Usually, nafcillin or oxacillin 150 to 200 mg/kg can be administered intravenously every 6 h.

In settings where CA-MRSA is prevalent in significant proportions, one should strongly consider coverage for CA-MRSA in the empirical treatment regimen [46\u2022] . Although literature does not support the use of more than one sensitive drug for the treatment of S. aureus, in the present scenario, it would be wise to use combination of antistaphylococcal antibiotics, initially. The number of sensitive drug could be minimised once culture and sensitivity reports are available. In India, the choices for empirical therapy could be clindamycin alone, cloxacillin along with clindamycin or a combination of cloxacillin, clindamycin and amikacin. Combination therapy should be stressed more especially in a critically ill child having fulminant sepsis, as a complication of TP by S. aureus. Clindamycin may have a role in cases of acute bacterial myositis of malignant type because of the Eagle effect, which showed superiority of clindamycin over penicillin in the treatment of streptococcal myositis [47] . Bickles et al. recommended cloxacillin with the addition of aminoglycoside if patients are immunocompromised or in a state of sepsis [47] . Zimbelman et al. recommend clindamycin with or without penicillin as superior to B lactamase antibiotic alone [48\u2022] . Clindamycin 40 mg/kg/day divided every 8 h could be a reasonable option also for penicillin hypersensitivity. Vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid are the options for clindamycin-resistant CA-MRSA. Dose of vancomycin in children should be 60 mg/kg/day divided every 6 h, and in adolescents, dose is usually reduced to 45 mg/kg/day, divided every 8 h. Where available, a glycopeptide antibiotic closely related to vancomycin called teicoplanin can be substituted for vancomycin; the teicoplanin loading dosage is 10 mg/kg IV every 12 h for three doses, followed by 10 mg/kg once daily [49] .

There are reports of increasing proportion of CA-MRSA clones worldwide including India, Australia and the USA [13\u2022\u2022, 21\u2022]. Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is a bacterial exotoxin secreted by Staphylococcus strains that are either methicillin sensitive or methicillin resistant. This toxin is known to cause leukocyte destruction and tissue necrosis in children. There is suggestion in the literature to request PVL status of all S. aureus isolates in suspected musculoskeletal sepsis [22\u2022]. Recent study from Texas, USA, showed an increase in the prevalence of CA-MRSA in cases of pyomyositis. Of the 24 available S. aureus isolates, 15 (63 %) were CA-MRSA. CA-MRSA, USA300, pvl-positive S. aureus isolates caused more severe disease [21\u2022]. Similar trends of increasing prevalence of CA-MRSA are being observed from other parts of the world including Japan and India [23\u2022, 24\u2022]. Recently published reports regarding prevalence of CA-MRSA among isolates of S. aureus was 64 % (28/44) in Japan and 46 % (140/305) from India [23\u2022, 24\u2022]. Clindamycin resistance is another emerging problem among the cases of CA-MRSA [24\u2022]", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Clinical spectrum and aetiology of pyomyositis cases", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Sl. no. </td><td>Study </td><td>No. of cases </td><td>Males (%)\n</td><td>Common muscle groups involved\n</td><td>Pus/blood culture positivity (S. aureus)\n</td><td>Proportion of CA-MRSA\n</td><td>h/o muscle trauma\n</td></tr><tr><td>1. </td><td>Moriarty P. et al.
