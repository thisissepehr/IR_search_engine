Nevertheless, the RNA can also form secondary structures by intramolecular base-pairing. Results: We show that the nucleotide distribution within codons is biased in all taxa of life on a global scale. Thereby, RNA secondary structures that require base-pairing between the position 1 of a codon with the position 1 of an opposing codon (here named RNA secondary structure class c 1 ) are under-represented. We conclude that this bias may result from the co-evolution of codon sequence and mRNA secondary structure, suggesting that RNA secondary structures are generally important in protein-coding regions of mRNAs.

On the one hand, stable structures in mRNAs can slow down ribosomes (Chen et al., 2013; Tholstrup et al., 2012; Wen et al., 2008) , arguing against a high number of very stable RNA structures in coding regions. On the other hand, a recent study of yeast mRNAs found a positive correlation of mRNA secondary structure with protein abundance, without affecting mRNA half-life (Zur and Tuller, 2012) . For this finding, Mao et al. first sight. By computational methods they found that moderate RNA secondary structures may increase ribosomal density and therewith translation rate (Mao et al., 2014) . Their interpretation is that the first ribosomes that encounter the coding region are slowed down by RNA secondary structures. Then, all following ribosomes catch up closely to create a line of migrating ribosomes which will disable reformation of RNA secondary structures and thus translate the mRNA with high efficiency. Taken together, synonymous codons in mRNA protein-coding regions are globally selected in all taxa of life in a way that the need to form RNA secondary structures in which a codon position 1 is required to pair with the codon position 1 of another codon is reduced. In turn, this means that mRNA CDSs evolved to allow the formation of RNA secondary structures using synonymous codons, underlining the general importance of such RNA secondary structures for the function of mRNAs in cells.
