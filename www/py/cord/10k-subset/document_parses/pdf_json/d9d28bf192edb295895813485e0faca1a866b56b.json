Case-Diagnosis/Treatment Our patient experienced nephrotic syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by influenza A/H1N1 virus infection at 5 years of age. A diagnosis of IgA and IgG2 deficiency and SLE was made on the basis of severe proteinuria, hematuria, hypocomplementemia, high anti-DNA antibody and antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers, and malar rash. However, these clinical signs and symptoms and laboratory features disappeared after the administration of methylprednisolone pulse therapy and prednisolone. For the 5 years following the initial treatment for SLE, the patient experienced a number of infections and had a low serum total IgG level; she was eventually diagnosed with CVID. The administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was required to prevent subsequent infections, and no relapse of SLE was observed. Conclusion We report the development of CVID in an IgAand IgG2-deficient patient with SLE on the basis of multiple episodes of infection. To prevent the development of CVID in IgA-and IgG2-deficient patients with SLE, it is important to prevent immune dysregulation by the avoidance of infections through the use of IVIG therapy.",

While this form of immunodeficiency is not usually associated with any specific symptoms, patients with IgA deficiency present with an increased frequency of allergies, autoimmune diseases, and malignancies. The high susceptibility to infection observed among these patients is almost always associated with a concomitant IgG2 deficiency. A number of autoimmune disorders have been reported to be associated with IgA deficiency, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [2] , rheumatoid arthritis, and celiac disease [3] . It has also been reported that the concurrence of SLE and IgA deficiency occurs at an approximate prevalence rate of 1-4.6%.",

Chest X-rays revealed bilateral, diffuse alveolar, and interstitial infiltrates. His oxygen index (OI) was 54. A diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by influenza A/H1N1 virus was made on the basis of the chest X-ray findings, the low OI value, and the elevated influenza A/H1N1 virus titers. He required artificial pulmonary ventilation and was treated with hypothermia and positional drainage.

A renal biopsy was performed, revealing diffuse global thickening of the glomerular capillary walls. No mesangial cell proliferation or increase in the mesangial matrix was found. Immunofluorescence staining revealed diffuse granular deposits of IgG and C3 in the glomerular capillary wall. Electron microscopy detected extensive global subepithelial deposition of electrondense material with spike formations. The pathological diagnosis was diffuse membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN).

A markedly lower frequency has been reported in Mongoloid populations, such as 1/18,500 in Japanese and 1/4100 in Chinese populations, suggesting a genetic basis [1] [2] [3] [4] . It has a variable familial and sporadic occurrence in the general population, often with a positive family history of immunologic abnormality. At onset, our case was suffering from severe pneumonia and ARDS caused by the influenza A/H1N1 virus. In general, there have been few reports on ARDS caused by the influenza A/H1N1 virus; consequently, in this respect, our patient represents a unique case. The development of ARDS might be associated with the immunosuppressive state resulting from his IgA and IgG2 deficiency. A variety of other associated diseases and immunologic abnormalities have been observed in patients with IgA deficiency. It has been estimated that the concurrence of SLE and IgA deficiency occurs at an approximate prevalence rate of 1-4.6% [5] [6] [7] [8] . Our patient experienced many infections and a gradually decreased serum total IgG level for 5 years after the concurrent SLE and was eventually diagnosed with CVID. Agarwal et al. [9] reported that autoimmune diseases affect about 20% of CVID patients and are commonly the first manifestation of immune deficiency. In their study, these authors found that autoimmunity was present before the diagnosis of CVID in 17.4% of 224 patients .",

Immune deficiency may also potentiate the virulence of an external vector and lead to an occult or latent chronic viral infection. Alternatively, host antigens may be altered and subsequently participate in its pathogenesis [10] . In our case, immunosuppressive drugs, including MPT and PDN, were given to inhibit the activation of SLE. Our patient experienced many infections, including acute pneumonia and parotitis, due to his immunodeficiency. He also had a low serum total IgG level and developed CVID. Thus, in terms of the pathogenesis of CVID in our patient, we speculate that immune dysregulation in our immunodeficient patient was triggered by the numerous episodes of infection.",

He subsequently suffered from frequent infections, including acute pneumonia and parotitis, but had no relapse of SLE. The PDN dose was gradually tapered over 20 months, and he continued to show a low total serum IgG1 level, with IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 levels of 184, 16, <5, and <5 mg/dl, respectively, and an IgM level of 324 mg/dl. T cell and NK cell functions were normal, and B cell function was decreased as follows: CD1a, 0.3 (normal range <3.",
