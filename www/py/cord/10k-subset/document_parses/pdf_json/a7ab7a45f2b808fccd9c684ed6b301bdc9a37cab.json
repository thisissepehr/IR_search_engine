            "text": "The main concerns about a new influenza pandemic are the disease burden and associated mortality it may cause. These are largely due to pneumonia resulting from extension of the viral infection to the lower respiratory tract. The initial lung damage may be complicated by concomitant or subsequent bacterial pneumonia, which has been shown to be a major cause of mortality during the Spanish influenza epidemic in 1918, before the use of antibiotics [5] . In the current outbreak of new H1N1 influenza, bacterial coinfection was registered in only 20% of the cases investigated [6] . In contrast to the damage caused by the virus infection to the tracheobronchial epithelium in uncomplicated influenza, damage to the alveolar epithelium has severe consequences for the gas exchange function of the respiratory tract. It allows fluid from the alveolar capillaries to flood the alveolar lumina, causing severe-and in some cases fatal-respiratory dysfunction [7] . On the basis of the observed relatively low case fatality rate in humans, it is assumed that the virulence of the new H1N1 virus is low. However, it is acknowledged that these figures are uncertain because of too limited data [8] . Therefore, the potential of the new H1N1 virus to cause lower respiratory tract disease in humans is still poorly understood. In a previous publication, we used intranasal inoculation of influenza virus into ferrets mainly to model the transmission of the new H1N1 virus in humans [9] . Here, we use intratracheal inoculation of influenza virus into ferrets as a model of influenza pneumonia in humans. This intratracheal route of inoculation is an appropriate model of infection in humans, which is commonly thought to occur through inhalation of infectious droplets or airborne droplet nuclei [10] . We have used this route of inoculation successfully in previous studies involving both ferrets [11] and macaques [12] [9] .",
