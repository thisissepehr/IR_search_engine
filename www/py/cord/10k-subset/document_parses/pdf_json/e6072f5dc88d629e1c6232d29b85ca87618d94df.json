OSE is a simple, rather primitive mesothelium with both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics. In contrast to mesothelia elsewhere, OSE retains the properties of relatively uncommitted pluripotent cells that has the ability to differentiate diversely in response to different stimuli (2) . As it progresses to malignancy, OSE becomes more committed to an epithelial phenotype of the Mullerian duct in association with increased E-cadherin expression than to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal conversion (2, 3) . This unique characteristic distinguishes ovarian cancers from other cancers, which usually become less differentiated than the epithelium from which they arise during tumorigenesis and lose E-cadherin expression with progression (4) . Moreover, ovarian cancers can metastasize by exfoliating small nodules of cohesive tumor cells from the primary tumor into the peritoneal cavity. Tumor cells can often aggregate and form spheroid-like structures that subsequently implant and invade into peritoneal tissue through E-cadherinmediated adherens junction (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 413, "end": 416, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 629, "end": 632, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 633, "end": 635, "text": "3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 867, "end": 870, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1190, "end": 1193, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1194, "end": 1197, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1198, "end": 1201, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1202, "end": 1205, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1206, "end": 1209, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Aberrant activation of hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway has recently been reported in various human cancers (8) , such as basal cell carcinoma (9) , prostate cancer (10), pancreatic cancer (11, 12) , gastrointestinal malignancies (13) (14) (15) and ovarian cancers (16) . In mammals, there are three HH ligand proteins: Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Indian HH and Desert HH. In the absence of ligands, the pathway is inactive. The transmembrane protein receptor Patched functions as a tumor suppressor that inhibits Smoothened (Smo) from activating downstream signaling components and Gli-mediated transcription of target genes (17, 18) . Activation of the pathway is initiated through binding of any of the three ligands (Shh, Indian HH, Desert HH) to Patched, alleviating Patched-mediated suppression of Smo and activating a signal cascade that leads to the translocation of active form of Gli, a zinc finger transcriptional factor, to the nucleus and further activates targeting genes expression (17, 18) .

Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed that after KAAD-cyclopamine blocking, significant downregulation of E-cadherin transcripts concurred with downregulation of the target gene Gli1 mRNA ( Figure 6D ).

In our study, the correlation of Gli1 overexpression and poor survival can be explained by the cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis-promoting effect and apoptosis-inhibiting effect of Gli1 overexpression. Such changes were associated with increased expression of VEGF, MT1-MMP and b1 integrin, which play critical roles in ovarian carcinogenesis (5, 41, 42) . MT1-MMP is the critical determinant of matrix degradation and invasion in ovarian cancer cells, whereas integrins play important roles in the metastatic process through their participation in both cell-cell contacts and interactions with a large variety of extracellular matrix protein (43) . VEGF is thought to contribute to ovarian tumor progression by stimulating angiogenesis and to promote ascites accumulation by increasing the permeability of diaphragmatic and tumorassociated vasculature (44) . Overexpression of Gli1 in cancer cells also induced increased expression of Bcl-2. It is known that Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic gene and is an important chemotherapy-resistant factor (45) . Overexpression of Bcl-2 may result in accumulation of cells in the G 0 phase of cell cycle division and contribute to chemoresistance (45) . Thus, aberrant activation of HH may result in cancer cell resistance to apoptosis through participation of death receptor pathway. Ectopic expression of Gli1 may also facilitate spread of the ovarian cancer cells. The increased expression of E-cadherin, in association with Gli1 overexpression, may facilitate the attachment among tumor cells to form aggregates or spheroids and tumor cells to adhere and invade the peritoneal mesothelial lining, thus contribute to their ability to colonize new sites, resulting in transcoelomic spread of ovarian cancer (5, 6) . Peritoneal ovarian cancer spheroids have been shown to be protected from apoptosis induced by radiation and therapeutic drugs (46) . The coexisting overexpression of vimentin has been considered to be accelerating cancer cell invasiveness in breast cancer (47) .

Snail is also an early Gli1-responsive gene in the skin and Gli1 can directly induce Snail transcription (53) . Induction of a conditional Gli1 transgene in the basal keratinocytes of mouse skin led to rapid upregulation of Snail transcripts and to cell proliferation in the interfollicular epidermis. Established Gli1-induced skin lesions exhibited molecular similarities to basal cell carcinoma, including loss of E-cadherin expression mediated by the Snail (54) .
