Some studies have demonstrated an association between CMV disease and increased mortality rates, prolonged intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and nosocomial infections. However, there is a considerable controversy whether such association represents a causal relationship between CMV disease and unfavorable outcomes or just a marker of the severity of the critical illness. Detection of CMV using polymerase chain reaction and CMV antigenemia is the standard diagnostic approach. CMV may have variety of clinical manifestations reflecting the involvement of different organ systems. Treatment of CMV in critical care is challenging due to diagnostic challenge and drug toxicity, and building predictive model for CMV disease in critical care setting would be promising to identify patients at risk and starting prophylactic therapy.

CMV infection according to that literature can occur as a result of reactivation of latent CMV or reinfection with an exogenous strain. Recurrent infection in immunocompromized patients is the detection of CMV genetic or molecular material in a patient who had previous documented infection and who has not had virus detected for an interval of at least 4 weeks during active surveillance [4] . Recurrent infection could be due to reactivation (if the detected strain is the same as the primary infecting strain) which is the most common mechanism of acquiring the disease in adulthood, especially in immunocompromized population (seropositivity of the donor or recipient has been recognized as the most likely mechanism of acquiring the disease after organ transplant; therefore, it is the recommended strategy for starting CMV prophylactic treatment across most guidelines) [5] [6] [7] , or new infection (different strains) [4] . Additionally, de novo primary infection may occur in adults but is rare. However, the distinction between the three scenarios, reactivation, new strain infection, and de novo primary infection, is difficult in practice, unless the patient is followed for a long time or the infecting source CMV genetic strains have been characterized.",

Variation in diagnostic methods used including selecting different specimens, some used serum, while others used urine, saliva, or bronchoalveolar lavage samples, tests were performed at different points in the ICU stay and testing time and frequency was not standardized in all studies as some left it up to the judgment of the treating team. Recent studies showed that CMV disease typically occurs within the first 2 weeks of critical illness. A study performed by Kalil and Florescu [34] showed that the diagnosis rate of CMV infection increased significantly (from 1 to 21%) when patients who spent five or more days in the ICU were screened, pointing to a threshold in timing for the window to develop CMV in critical care setting. In a recent systematic review that included 13 studies (nine prospective and four retrospective), the incidence of CMV disease in critically ill patients, defined as the detection of antigenemia, DNAemia, or positive viral culture from blood samples with or without other clinical specimens, ranged from 0 to 36%. Notably, the reported incidence of the disease was much higher in studies that screened the patients weekly than those that screened only once within the first 4 days of admission to the ICU (6-33 vs. 0.8-1.2%), indicating that the disease happens frequently beyond the first 4 days post-admission. Among the studies using PCR detection (which is the most sensitive diagnostic test for CMV), the mean and median times of detection ranged from 4 to 12 days after ICU admission [8] .",

However, lung involvement may be less recognizable in immunocompetent critically ill patients especially if they were intubated for other reasons, but few studies demonstrated that the prevalence of this disease in immunocompetent critically ill patients may be as high as 50% in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia or ICU-acquired acute respiratory distress syndrome [36] . However, CMV disease is not necessarily the pathologic cause of ICU-acquired pneumonia and discrimination between a causal or associative relationship is challenging because the diagnosis depends on quality of the respiratory sample, pathologist skills, and variation of the diagnostic test. As an example of this variation, Coisel et al. [37] studied patients mechanically ventilated who are seropositive for CMV and found significant increased mortality in CMV-positive group; in addition, the diagnostic yield of BAL CMV PCR was 73% in comparison with the detection of CMV antigenemia which was 46%. Heininger et al. [38] studied patients admitted with severe sepsis of whom 31% developed ICUacquired pneumonia and have shown slightly different diagnostic yield of tracheal aspirate CMV PCR of 70 versus 62% using blood CMV PCR. In a previous study, the same authors included only CMV surgical seropositive patients and found equal diagnostic yield between BAL PCR and blood PCR. Chiche showed different results, as the diagnostic yield of BAL was 26% (using CMV shell vial culture) compared to 85% using CMV antigenemia [26] . Papazian et al. [39] studied patients with ventilatorassociated pneumonia and made histologic diagnosis of CMV pneumonia in 29% of the patients. The study found that BAL shell vial culture had a sensitivity/specificity of 53, 92% in comparison with histologic diagnosis. Ong et al. [40] studied immunocompetent patients with ARDS and found a CMV reactivation incidence of 27%, which was associated with significant increase in ICU mortality. ",

Because IgG seropositivity is long lasting, the measurement of IgG antibodies is not a reliable method to diagnose CMV infection. Critically ill patients may develop immune paralysis (anergy) that limits their ability to mount immune responses; therefore, it is important to note that negative serology does not exclude CMV infection.

Potential answers to these questions will hopefully be answered by currently ongoing trials related to CMV in critical care. \"Cytomegalovirus Control in Critical Care trial\" (NCT01503918) is addressing the safety and success rate regarding preventing reactivation of latent cytomegalovirus infection in critically ill patients when treated with one of two different antiviral regimens: \"Valaciclovir/Aciclovir or not. \" \"Study of Ganciclovir/Valganciclovir for Prevention of Cytomegalovirus Reactivation in Acute Injury of the Lung and Respiratory Failure\" (NCT01335932) is addressing whether administration of ganciclovir in CMV-seropositive patients reduces serum IL-6 levels in immunocompetent adults with severe sepsis or trauma-associated respiratory failure based on the hypothesis that pulmonary and systemic CMV reactivation amplifies both lung and systemic inflammation mediated through specific cytokines. \"Preemptive Treatment of Herpesviridae trial\" (NCT02152358) is addressing whether preemptive treatment by ganciclovir (for positive CMV viremia) or aciclovir (for positive HSV oropharyngeal PCR) is able to increase the number of ventilator-free days at day 60 in ICU patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation having evident viral replication.
