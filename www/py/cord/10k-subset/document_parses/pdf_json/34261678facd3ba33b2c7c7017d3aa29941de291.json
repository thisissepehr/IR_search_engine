            "text": "With the consideration of mechanism of prevention and control for the spread of viral diseases, in this paper, we propose two novel virus dynamics models where state feedback control strategies are introduced. The first model incorporates the density of infected cells (or free virus) as control threshold value; we analytically show the existence and orbit stability of positive periodic solution. Theoretical results imply that the density of infected cells (or free virus) can be controlled within an adequate level. The other model determines the control strategies by monitoring the density of uninfected cells when it reaches a risk threshold value. We analytically prove the existence and orbit stability of semi-trivial periodic solution, which show that the viral disease dies out. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the main results.",

Many serious diseases, such as ebola, AIDS, avian influenza, and SARS, are caused by viruses. The control and hence eradication of diseases is one of the major concerns in the study of viral epidemiology. Since viral reproduction always involves host cells and uses the cellular machinery for the synthesis of their genome and other components, there have been two methodologies used to mimic these processes by mathematical models. Perhaps the earliest and simplest classical virus dynamics model was developed by Kermack et al. in [1] and Anderson et al. in [2, 3] as follows",

[15] found that the turnover of free virus is much faster than that of infected cells, which allowed them to make a quasisteady state assumption-that is, the amount of free virus is simply proportional to the number of infected cells. Therefore, the density of infected cells y in model (1) also can be considered as a measure of the free virus load.",

These include the existence of the threshold value, which is the index for the persistence and extinction of a viral disease; the local or global stability of virus-free equilibrium and the virus equilibrium; the existence and stability of periodic solutions, to name just a few (see, e.g., [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] ). Particularly, Nakata [26] studied the global dynamics of a viral infection model with a latent period and nonlinear function which denotes the incidence rate of the virus infection in vivo. Wang and Zhao [27] considered the investigation of the effects of periodic drug treatment on a standard within-host virus model. Ball et al. [28] examined the dynamics of strain replacement in a simple model that includes a convex trade-off between rapid virus reproduction and long-term host cell survival. Lang and Li [29] investigated the consequences of a more general CTL response and show that a sigmoidal response function gives rise to complex behaviors previously unobserved.",

For example, of many strategies, the efficient ways for elimination or control of malignant neoplasm are still chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy in clinical treatment in recent years. The clinical data show that the course of these treatments for some viral diseases is relatively short but the density of various cells in vivo changed radically, which in nature is submitted to short temporary effects that are negligible compared to the process duration. These short-time perturbations are often assumed to be in the form of impulses in the modeling process.",

Particularly, the state-dependent impulsive control strategies are applied widely to the prevention of spread of infectious disease due to its economic, high efficiency, and feasibility nature. This idea can be found in many other areas like agricultural production and fishery industry; where the control measures, such as catching, poisoning, releasing the natural enemy, and harvesting, are taken only when the number of population reaches an economic threshold value. Following this idea, the dynamic behaviors of population, epidemic and language models with state-dependent impulsive effects are considered, and the existence and stability of positive periodic solution by the Poincar\u00e9 map, properties of the Lambert W function, and analog of Poincar\u00e9 criterion are obtained [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] .",

The main purpose is to investigate the state feedback control strategies which govern whether the viral disease dies out or not, and further to examine how the state feedback control strategies affect the prevention and control of viral disease. This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we introduce two novel virus dynamics models where the state feedback control strategies are considered, some basic definitions, and an important lemma. The density of infected cells (or free virus) as control threshold value, and some sufficient conditions are presented in Sect. 3 for the existence and orbital stability of positive periodic solutions. In Sect. 4, the existence and stability of semi-trivial periodic solution are obtained, where the density of uninfected cells is the control threshold value. The numerical simulations are carried out in Sect. 5 for illustration. Some concluding remarks are presented in Sect. 6.",

Firstly, choosing the density of infected cells or free virus as a control threshold value, some sufficient conditions on the existence and orbitally asymptotical stability of positive order-1 or order-2 periodic solution of model (3) are presented by the Poincar\u00e9 map, the analog of Poincar\u00e9 criterion and qualitative analysis method. This amounts to that we can control the density of infected cells or free virus at a low level over a long period of time by adjusting control strength. It is concluded that the state feedback control strategies are feasible and effective. Further, choosing the density of uninfected cells x as control threshold value, we obtain that the existence and orbitally asymptotical stability of periodic solution. In particular, the existence and orbitally asymptotical stability of semi-trivial periodic are obtained. This implies that infected cells or free virus y dies out if we control the density of cells x within a certain range. It provides theoretical basis for finding a new measure to prevent and control the spread of viral disease.",
