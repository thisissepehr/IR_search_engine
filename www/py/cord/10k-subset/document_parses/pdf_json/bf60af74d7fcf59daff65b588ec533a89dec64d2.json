Nevertheless, vvECMO is a procedure associated with high costs and resource utilization. The aim of this study was to assess published models for prediction of mortality following vvECMO and optimize an alternative model. Methods: Established mortality risk scores were validated to assess their usefulness in 304 adult patients undergoing vvECMO for refractory lung failure at the University Medical Center Regensburg from 2008 to 2013. A parsimonious prediction model was developed based on variables available before ECMO initiation using logistic regression modelling. We then assessed whether addition of variables available one day after ECMO implementation enhanced mortality prediction. Models were internally validated and calibrated by bootstrapping (400 runs). Predictive ability, goodness-of-fit and model discrimination were compared across the different models. Results: In the present study population, existing mortality prediction tools for vvECMO patients showed suboptimal performance. Evaluated before vvECMO initiation, a logistic prediction model comprising age, immunocompromised state, artificial minute ventilation, pre-ECMO serum lactate and hemoglobin concentrations showed best mortality prediction in our patients (area under curve, AUC: 0.75). Additional information about norepinephrine dosage, fraction of inspired oxygen, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen concentrations the first day following ECMO initiation further improved discrimination (AUC: 0.79, P = 0.03) and predictive ability (likelihood ratio test, P < 0.001). When classifying patients as lower (<40%) or higher (>80%) risk based on their predicted mortality, the pre-ECMO and day1-on-ECMO models had negative/positive predictive values of 76%/82% and 82%/81%, respectively. Conclusions: While pre-ECMO mortality prediction remains a challenge due to large patient heterogeneity, evaluation one day after ECMO initiation may improve the ability to separate lower-and higher-risk patients. Our findings support the clinical perception that chronic health condition, high comorbidity and reduced functional reserves are strongly related to survival during and following ECMO support. Renewed evaluation the first day after ECMO initiation may provide enhanced guidance for further handling of ECMO patients.

The harmful effect of anemia is greater than the increased risk explained by the need for transfusion [20] . Thus, associated comorbid conditions may confound the role of anemia as a risk factor.

Such a model might aid in the decision to wean the patient from ECMO. However, due to smaller patient numbers caused by earlier weaning or death, a preliminary day 7 model for the remaining 193 patients (126 survivors and 67 non-survivors) showed wide CIs for the odds ratios and was not significantly better at predicting mortality than the day 1 model (P = 0.25, data not shown). Thus, it seems that a substantially larger study would be needed. Furthermore, any model aimed at predicting withdrawal of futile therapy has to be extremely accurate in order not to lead to erroneous decisions.

While previous models have based their variable selection on univariate analyses, we employed a method combining clinical experience and judgment with computer-based statistics. Nevertheless, the inhomogeneous study population makes overfitting a persisting challenge and the ability of a predictive model to estimate the prognosis of individual patients with high accuracy remains limited. The usefulness of a prediction model rather lies in the assistance it may provide for the discrimination between higher-and lower-risk patients in order to help identify potential candidates for ECMO support and give guidance for rational and ethical resource utilization [6, 11] . We, therefore, categorized patients into three groups with significantly different probabilities of survival. It may be argued that our defined high-risk group was very small, but we kept this cut-off because of its potential clinical usefulness. Categorization of patients may also be helpful for future external and internal validations in order to compare institutional variations in indications and practice of ECMO. However, although the risk score may function as a useful supplementary tool for clinicians, thorough clinical evaluation on a case-to-case basis still remains the cornerstone of ECMO handling.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 800, "end": 803, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 804, "end": 807, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Challenges related to mortality prediction in vvECMO patients"}, {"text": "Conventional rescue therapies, such as prone positioning and use of neuromuscular blockade, were not registered in all patients in the UKR database. A part of our study population dates back to 2008 when the advantages of prone positioning were not universally accepted and neuromuscular blockade was only rarely used in Germany. Hence, the quality of conventional treatment which may be associated with mortality irrespective of the other factors included in the model could not be evaluated in this study. In the calculation of the PRESERVE scores, all patients were assigned to 'no prone positioning pre-ECMO.' However, this may contribute to overestimating mortality risk with PRESERVE in our patient population. Furthermore, the PRESERVE score used mortality six months post-ICU discharge as the end-point, while the present study only followed patients up to hospital discharge. Mid-and long-term outcomes are important in ARDS patients receiving vvECMO support. Unfortunately, in the past, long-term outcomes of our patients and healthrelated quality of life were not reevaluated, as many patients were retrieved from distant hospitals after our team implanted ECMO as a rescue procedure to allow transport to our center.
