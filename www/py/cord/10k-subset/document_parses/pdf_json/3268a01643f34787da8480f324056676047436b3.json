There has always been much confusion relating to terminology. Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain, and meningoencephalitis is inflammation of both the brain and meninges (Cherry, Shields, and Bronstein, in press ). The term emcephalopathy refers to an illness with neurologic findings suggestive of encephalitis but without inflammation of the brain. Encephalitis is often classified as primary or postinfectious/parainfectious. In primary encephalitis the illness is due to the direct invasion and replication of an infectious agent within the brain, whereas postinfectious/parainfectious occurs after, or in combination with, another noncentral nervous system illness or following the administration of a vaccine or other product.",

It is most often due to reactivation of latent infection but it can be related to a primary infection or reinfection by a second HSV-1 strain. It occurs in all age groups. In neonates, herpes encephalitis is most often due to disseminated HSV-2 infection acquired during the birth process. Encephalitis in older children is almost always due to HSV-1. HSV-2 rarely causes encephalitis outside of the newborn period except in immunocompromised persons. However, aseptic meningitis due to HSV-2 is a not an infrequent illness associated with recurrent genital HSV-2 infection. Varicella (chicken pox) is complicated by varicella-zoster virus (VZV) encephalitis in $0.3 per 1000 cases (Cherry, Shields, and Bronstein, in press ). Primary infection with VZV results in latent infection in dorsal root ganglia. Reactivation of virus leads to zoster, and between 0.5% and 5% of patients with zoster may have encephalitis. Other herpes group viruses (EBV, CMV, HHV-6, and HHV-7) may occasionally cause encephalitis. There is a particular risk of encephalitis with these viruses in immunocompromised patients due to reactivation of latent virus. In primary infection with EBV resulting in infectious mononucleosis, about 1% of cases will develop encephalitis during the course of the illness. Encephalitis is uncommon in primary CMV infection except in congenital infections. HHV-6 is a common cause of febrile convulsions in infants but it is an uncommon cause of encephalitis.",

In general, most cases in temperate climates occur in the summer or fall reflecting arboviral and enteroviral etiologies.

Arboviruses are zoonoses in which humans are infected accidentally by an arthropod vector. Most commonly, mosquitoes or other insects acquire arboviruses by biting infected birds. Encephalitis in horses and mules may be the first indication of incipient trouble in a geographic area.",

Serologic studies in encephalitis can be very useful but most often they are done inappropriately. The demonstration of a significant titer rise to an infectious agent is most important. This requires the collection of both an acute-phase and a convalescent-phase specimen. In general, these specimens should be studied at the same time. Except for a few specific IgM antibody tests, the examination of an acute-phase specimen alone results in misdiagnoses. Particularly problematic in this regard is the examination of enteroviral antibody panels. Also problematic is the examination of the CSF for antibodies to infectious agents.",
