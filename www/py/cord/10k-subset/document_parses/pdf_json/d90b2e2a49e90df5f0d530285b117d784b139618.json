Despite their potency in vitro, these drugs have limited use in vivo for treatment of acute primary EBV infection as well as EBV associated malignancies due to toxicity and non-specific antiviral activities. The reason for antiviral failure may be that most of the symptoms and signs of acute EBV are not directly due to viral cytopathology in infected tissues, but to immunopathic responses to EBV-infected cells, particularly EBV-infected B-lymphocytes and also the levels of acyclovir achieved in the oropharynx, particularly after oral administration of the drug are inadequate as compared to titres that are produced by acyclovir given intravenously [1] . Valacyclovir is the Lvalyl ester of acyclovir. This modification increases acyclovir bioavailability by 3-to 5-fold compared with oral acyclovir [6] . Pharmacokinetic data suggests that dose of valacyclovir regimen of about 30 mg/kg/day gives similar AUC as that with acyclovir given 250 mg/ m 2 intravenously [7] . Due to its improved absorption with higher serum concentrations, this drug is preferable to acyclovir for the treatment of EBV infections [8] . Common adverse drug reactions associated with valacyclovir therapy are the same as for acyclovir, its active metabolite, and include: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and headache [9] .",

Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CVT) occurs in neonates with an incidence of at least 0.67 per 100,000 per year [5] . However, this impact is likely underestimated for several reasons as the lack of knowledge of this condition by many clinicians, the difficulty in obtaining a correct radiological diagnosis and, above all, the absence of a specific clinical presentation [6] .

This may occur concurrently with leukemia or may precede the occurrence of leukemia by weeks to months [5] [6] [7] [8] . In our first patient, imaging studies showed a mass lesion wedged between the pancreas and liver, producing compression of the biliary channels and so we considered the jaundice to be obstructive even though the alkaline phosphatase levels were normal. The mass was a granulocytic sarcoma causing extrinsic compression of the biliary tree. In our second patient, AML presented as a stricture of the biliary tree producing obstructive jaundice. In this scenario, the major differential diagnosis to be considered is a secondary sclerosing cholangitis which in children could be due to langerhans cell histiocytosis, immunodeficiency, sickle cell anemia or autoimmune diseases.
