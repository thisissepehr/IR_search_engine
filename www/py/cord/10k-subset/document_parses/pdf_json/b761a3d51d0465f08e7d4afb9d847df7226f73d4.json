However, common metrics of malaria transmission such as parasite prevalence are under powered in elimination contexts. China has achieved major reductions in malaria incidence and is on track to eliminate, having reporting zero locally-acquired malaria cases in 2017 and 2018. Understanding the spatio-temporal pattern underlying this decline, especially the relationship between locally-acquired and imported cases, can inform efforts to maintain elimination and prevent re-emergence. This is particularly pertinent in Yunnan province, where the potential for local transmission is highest. Using a geo-located individual-level dataset of cases recorded in Yunnan province between 2011 and 2016, we introduce a novel Bayesian framework to model a latent diffusion process and estimate the joint likelihood of transmission between cases and the number of cases with unobserved sources of infection. This is used to estimate the case reproduction number, Rc. We use these estimates within spatio-temporal geostatistical models to map how transmission varied over time and space, estimate the timeline to elimination and the risk of resurgence. We estimate the mean Rc between 2011 and 2016 to be 0.171 (95% CI = 0.165, 0.178) for P. vivax cases and 0.089 (95% CI = 0.076, 0.103) for P. falciparum cases. From 2014 onwards, no cases were estimated to have a Rc value above one. An unobserved source of infection was estimated to be moderately likely (p>0.5) for 19/ 611 cases and high (p>0.8) for 2 cases, suggesting very high levels of case ascertainment. Our estimates suggest that, maintaining current intervention efforts, Yunnan is unlikely to experience sustained local transmission up to 2020.

However, traditional metrics used to measure malaria transmission are not suitable in elimination settings. China is one example of a country approaching elimination, with aims to eliminate the disease by 2020. Using a detailed individual level dataset of the times and locations of people showing symptoms of malaria, we use approaches adapted from the study of how information spreads through social networks to estimate the likelihood of transmission occurring between cases. This information is used to estimate how many people we expect each case to go on to infect. In elimination settings, this number is an indication of how quickly elimination will be reached and how likely we are to see a resurgence in cases once elimination is achieved.

This reduction has been attributed to a combination of socioeconomic improvements and the scale-up of interventions to control malaria [5] . In 2010, China set out an ambitious plan for the national elimination of malaria by 2020 (the National Malaria Elimination Programme, NMEP).

There is also some uncertainty in our estimates of current and future R c , although the 95% credible intervals of these estimates remain below 1. It is important to note that even with low R c values it is still possible for locally-acquired cases to occur following importation, however the probability of sustained chains of transmission decreases as R c decreases. There also is more uncertainty in our estimates of risk in areas that have not observed many cases. It is difficult to determine whether an absence of cases is due to a lack of detection, a lack of importation events occurring or a low underlying receptivity to transmission. However, it is worth noting that the greatest uncertainty in our spatiotemporal risk estimates of R c >0 tends to be in areas of high elevation (elevation > 3000m), where there is unlikely to be transmission. Given the large numbers of imported cases, it is important to highlight these uncertainties and ensure control measures are maintained.

This pattern could be an artefact of human movement, with both periods associated with seasonal movement and holiday periods-the Chunyun period occurs in China for Chinese New Year and the holiday week of the National Day in October and is associated with intranational travel to visit family. During this time, there is often movement from cities to rural areas, and so in these contexts there may be more opportunities for infection to occur as more people are exposed to bites from suitable vectors.

This definition might include people who travelled abroad within the week prior to illness onset, but biologically their infection could not have been obtained during that time given the incubation period. However, in the absence of alternative information, travel history may provide a better indication of the likely importation status of a case than attempting to infer importation without this information, however there could be scope in future work to allow for incorrect travel history.

Additionally, since China launched the Malaria Elimination Action Plan in 2010, Yunnan Province has special fund to support enhanced malaria surveillance with a high sensitivity, as it was identified as a key province with endemic malaria. The healthcare units at township level are required to screen malaria in febrile patients, so that the possibility of missed diagnosis or underreports of malaria in the patients with fever is likely to be low. Due to the low levels of malaria in China, immunity is likely to be low and therefore asyptomatic infection is less likely. For those who do have no fever or mild symptoms, we assume they have limited capacity to transmit malaria as their gametocyte density is likely to be low.

The serial interval distribution of treated, symptomatic P. falciparum malaria, previously characterised using empirical and model based evidence [30, 31] was adapted to inform the prior distribution for the relationship between time and likelihood of transmission between cases in China. We analysed P. vivax cases and P. falciparum cases separately. The prior distribution was defined to be flexible enough to reflect both the biology of P. vivax and P. falciparum as well as the dominant vector species in Yunnan (recent surveys in Yunnan province have found Anopheles sinensis to be the dominant vector species in mid-elevation areas and rice paddies and Anopheles minimus s.l. the dominant species in low elevation areas [13, 32] and to allow for possible variation in transmission dynamics, for example due to untyped infections or delays in seeking treatment. In addition, there is a possibility of a small number of asymptomatic or undetected and therefore untreated infections contributing to ongoing transmission, which will typically have a longer serial interval. We use a shifted Rayleigh distribution (a special case of a Weibull distribution), to describe the serial interval of both species, which can be varied by changing two parameters: \u03b1 and \u03b3. The parameter \u03b1 governs the overall shape of the distribution, and \u03b3 is the shifting parameter accounting for the incubation period between receiving an infectious bite and the onset of symptoms (Fig 1A) . The \u03b3 shifting parameter was fixed at 15 days to account for the extrinsic incubation period within the mosquito and the minimum time between infection and suitable numbers of gametocytes in the blood to lead to symptom onset [33] . The prior for the \u03b1 parameter determining the shape of the distribution was given a Normal distribution with mean 0.003 and standard deviation 0.1 (illustrated in Fig 5) , giving an expected time between symptom onset of one case and symptom onset of the case it infects of 36 days, with the parameter value in the 2.5 percentile of prior having an expected serial interval of 21 days and the equivalent parameter from the 97.5 percentile having an expected serial interval of 60 days. By comparison the expected values for treated P. falciparum from existing literature range between 33 and 49.1 days (95% CI = 33-69) [30, 31] . Depending on how much uncertainty there is in the serial interval (SI) of malaria, the prior for \u03b1, the shaping parameter for the SI of malaria, may be varied. We explored the effects of different priors on the likelihood and posterior estimates. We used the same mean value for \u03b1 (0.003) but set the \u03b1 prior to standard deviation between 1 and 0.01.
