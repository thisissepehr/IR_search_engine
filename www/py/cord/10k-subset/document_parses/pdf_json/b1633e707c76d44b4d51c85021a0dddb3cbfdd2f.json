            "text": "Background: This study aimed to study the osteo-preservative effects of captopril, an inhibitor on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), on bone mass, micro-architecture and histomorphology as well as the modulation of captopril on skeletal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and regulators for bone metabolism in mice with bilateral orchidectomy. Methods: The orchidectomized (ORX) mice were orally administered with vehicle or captopril at low dose (10 mg/kg) and high dose (50 mg/kg) for six weeks. The distal femoral end, the proximal tibial head and the lumbar vertebra (LV) were stained by hematoxylin and eosin, Safranin O/Fast Green and massontrichrome. Micro-computed tomography was performed to measure bone mineral density (BMD). Results: Treatment with captopril increased trabecular bone area at distal metaphysis of femur, proximal metaphysis of tibia and LV-4, moreover, high dose of captopril significantly elevated trabecular BMD of LV-2 and LV-5. The mRNA expressions of renin receptor, angiotensinogen, carbonic anhydrase II, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were significantly decreased in tibia of ORX mice following treatment with captopril. The administration with captopril enhanced the ratio of OPG/RANKL mRNA expression, the mRNA expression of transforming growth factor-beta and the protein expression of bradykinin receptor-1. Conclusions: The inhibition on ACE by captopril exerts beneficial effects on trabecular bone of ORX mice. The therapeutic efficacy may be attributed to the regulation of captopril on local RAS and cytokines in bone.",

It is well-known that osteoporosis-related fractures due to low-trauma or fragility result in heavy health-related costs, substantial disability and mortality among postmenopausal women and older men [1] . Osteoporosis is now recognized as a major threat to health in aging people. Men sustain bone loss of approximately 0.5-1% per year from the sixth decade despite not undergoing a menopausal transition as women do [2] . Overall, the trend of age-adjusted prevalence of osteoporosis was similar between women and men [3, 4] . However, the mortality and morbidity caused by osteoporotic fractures are greater in men with testosterone deficiency-induced osteoporosis than those in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis [5, 6] .",

The expression ratio of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL), both of which are secreted by osteoblasts, determines the maturation of osteoclasts. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and carbonic anhydrase (CA)II produced from osteoclasts are responsible for resorbing organic proteins and inorganic minerals, respectively. Bradykinin manages bone metabolism through modulating osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis by binding to its receptor. Recently, various cytokines like tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 are found to play major roles in bone health. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components exist in tissues and organs, namely tissue RAS, participating in kinds of pathophysiologic processes [7, 8] . Recent animal studies indicated the existence of RAS components in trabecular bone [9, 10] , and cell studies found the expression of angiotensin receptors in primary osteoblasts [11] , suggesting there locally exist RAS components in bone micro-environment. The previous functional studies indicated that the skeletal RAS displays key biological actions on mediating bone metabolism [12] [13] [14] .",

Treatment of ORX mice with captopril significantly suppressed these changes of CAII, MMP-9 and OPG/RANKL. Similar results were reported by others that captopril increased the ratio of OPG/RANKL in bone [18] and serum [33] of OVX rats. Both MMP-9 and CAII, produced from osteoclasts, are enzymes to dissolve organic component and inorganic substance of bone, respectively [27] .

In vivo studies showed that the administration of animals with RAS inhibitors could reduce TNF-\u03b1 expression in tissue [37, 38] , similarly, in this study captopril dramatically decreased mRNA expression of TNF-\u03b1 in bone of ORX mice. In addition, TGF-\u03b2 is an important modulator for bone formation and repair. The present study showed the down-regulation of TGF-\u03b2 in bone of ORX mice, which was in consistent with early study [39] . The increase in TGF-\u03b2 expression in response to captopril treatment was found in ORX mice in this study, and the similar action of captopril on TGF-\u03b2 was also reported in human lung fibroblasts [40] . Our study indicated that the regulation of captopril on TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2 might be involved in its protective effects on bone tissue of ORX mice. Although treatment with captopril attenuated bone injury in ORX mice, we found that captopril at high dose in this study induced the elevation of renin protein expression in bone. The compensatory increase in renin expression is a common problem for ACEIs due to the disruption of the feedback inhibitory loop in renin production [41] . The increase in RAS activity might ultimately limit the therapeutic effectiveness of ACE inhibition. Thus, the clinical practice currently suggests the application of RAS blockers with aliskiren, one renin inhibitor which could suppress the first and rate-limiting step within RAS [42] . While, whether the combination of ACEI with aliskiren could synergistically ameliorate bone impairments induced by testosterone deficiency need to be further clarified.",
