The close relationship of the 'modern' (group 2) sexuals suggests that these are also too closely related to the agamospermous polyploids to form only one of the genomes involved in the origin of the latter. Rather, these sexuals may result from rediploidization from facultatively agamospermous polyploid Taraxacum, of the kind described by Richards (1970 Richards ( , 1986 and Muller (1972) . In this sense they are truly 'modern' (post-agamospermous) sexual diploids.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 735, "end": 749, "text": "Richards (1970", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 750, "end": 767, "text": "Richards ( , 1986", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 772, "end": 785, "text": "Muller (1972)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "With the possible exception of T. serotinum (Ser), the group 3 'primitive' diploid sexuals are all fully self-compatible, and probably largely selfing in nature. The scarcity of heterozygous loci in these single accessions (Het = 0.001) supports this supposition. The low SI values obtained between selfing (group 3) accessions suggest that group 3 populations may have been separated geographically, and by their breeding system, for a sufficient period of time to allow considerable genetic differentiation. Van Soest ( 1958) and Furnkranz ( 1969) suggested that the primitive diploid sexual species, with a fragmented distribution in the Mediterranean basin, from sections of the genus such as Tarazacum section Leptocephala ( T. bessarabicum) and T. section Serotina ( T . serolinum and T. pyropappum) are relicts from a Tertiary distribution around the ancient Tethys Sea and are therefore from 20M, to 5Ma old.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 542, "end": 549, "text": "( 1969)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "It is difficult to assess the length of time that T. aristum has been isolated from other Taraxacum species in Australia. Richards (1973) has suggested that species in 1. section Antarctica evolved from species in T. section Arctica, which occur in arctic America and elsewhere at high latitudes, having migrated down the American mountain chain. Whether these species then dispersed to Australasia before the final separation of the Gondwanaland mass (i.e. before 40Ma) or whether they have resulted from more recent long-distant dispersal is problematic. Either way, the date at which such populations dispersed southwards away from the Eurasiatic homeland of the genus, is likely to be placed well before the Pleistocene. The present study suggests that the degree of differentiation of Turaxacum taxa, as assessed by isozymes, may largely be a function of the age of separation of these taxa. The supposedly 'primitive' nature of such species at T. bessarabicum, T. serotinum, T. pyropappum and T. aristum is tentatively supported by their distant relationships to each other, and to 'modern' Taraxacum, although sampling is inadequate. The very close electrophoretic resemblance of taxonomically and chromosomally diverse 'modern' taxa suggests that they may have diverged very recently from a common agamospermous stock, and that 'modern' diploid sexuals may also have derived from this stock by rediploidization.
