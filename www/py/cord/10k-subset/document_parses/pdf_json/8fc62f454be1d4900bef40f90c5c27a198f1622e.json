Along their life cycle, some insect viruses, such as viruses from the Dicistroviridae family, withstand dehydrated conditions with presently unknown consequences to their structural stability. Here, we use atomic force microscopy to monitor the structural changes of viral particles of Triatoma virus (TrV) after desiccation. Our results demonstrate that TrV capsids preserve their genome inside, conserving their height after exposure to dehydrating conditions, which is in stark contrast with other viruses that expel their genome when desiccated. Moreover, empty capsids (without genome) resulted in collapsed particles after desiccation. We also explored the role of structural ions in the dehydration process of the virions (capsid containing genome) by chelating the accessible cations from the external solvent milieu. We observed that ion suppression helps to keep the virus height upon desiccation. Our results show that under drying conditions, the genome of TrV prevents the capsid from collapsing during dehydration, while the structural ions are responsible for promoting solvent exchange through the virion wall.",

            "text": "Viral modes of infection divide into two main routes: vertical transmission, which is from a host to its progeny, and horizontal transmission, which occurs through direct or indirect host-to-host contacts. The horizontal route can include a large variety of environmental agents like aerosol spread, and food or water up-taking. Since it is assumed that most viruses are highly sensitive to desiccation [1] , the ability of the virus to stand ambient conditions is a limiting factor for virus spread. In this respect, aspects like resistance to dehydration and virus spread through contaminated fomites, are important factors that affect the transmission of several viral human diseases [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Nevertheless, the molecular determinants by which viral structures resist desiccation remain unknown.",

Their structures show some common features: they are spherical structures of about 30 nm in diameter, built of 60 copies of four different peptides, and lack of an outer lipid bilayer envelope. These protein shells are compact with no obvious holes through which the internal solvent could be exchanged with that of the surrounding external milieu. However, the capsid presents cavities that traverse along the five-fold icosahedral axes. These cavities are constructed by an annulus formed by the five symmetry-related amino acid side chains, and this constriction is of about 0.4 nm in diameter. In many virus structures, an electron density is observed at this point, and has been interpreted as coordinated divalent cations that seem to block the cavity [10] [11] [12] [13] . These metal ions are accessible from the external solvent and can be removed by chelating agents [10, 14, 15] . Although the putative function of these ions most likely relates to capsid stability, their structural role has not been experimentally determined yet.",

These three empty particles were chemically characterized; their structures were solved at low resolution by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reconstructions [18] , and one of them at medium resolution by x-ray crystallography [19] . These studies allowed us to conclude that the three empty particles, and most likely the ones observed by direct TEM images taken from fresh feces, are almost identical to the atomic structure of full particles obtained by crystallography. Another conclusion was that the misprocessing of the precursor of the capsid proteins can produce different peptides, but even so they are able to assemble into spherical particles of the same diameter (~30 nm).

In the case of TrV, the virus may remain intact for years within infected dead insects [21] , showing that the capsid resists the proteases and nucleases released by the decaying corpses. Additionally, both CrPV and TrV are shed in the insect's feces and represent a source of infection [22, 23] . Once the feces are deposited on the field or in insect nests, they are exposed to hot and dry ambient conditions (figure S1, supplemental information SI (stacks.iop.org/ JPhysCM/30/104001/mmedia)).

            "text": "Atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides both high-resolution images and physical properties of virus particles in liquid milieu [24] . AFM topographies allow for measuring the integrity of individual virus particles adsorbed on a solid substrate. Specifically, the particle dimensions (height and width) are an important indicator of the virus' structural integrity. This way, any structural change of the particle would result in a decrease of height [25] , which may reflect either a structural collapse or just deformation. For instance, virus particles adsorbed on a surface in solution normally present a similar height to the nominal diameter obtained from the structural models [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Although it might depend on the virus-surface interplay [32] , the interaction between virus capsids and the surface is usually not strong enough to induce important alterations on their structure in liquid. However, the subsequent desiccation by removing the water from the surface modifies the virus structure, which renders a height considerably lower than the hydrated values [33] . This structural alteration of the virus is due to several mechanisms. First, the lack of water contributes to the destabilization of the native folding and association of capsid subunits [34] . Second, capillary forces occurring during the final desiccation steps pulls the virus structure toward the substrate [33] . Third, dehydration changes the genome folding and its interaction with the viral capsid. The magnitude of this structural change deeply depends on the presence of viral genome inside the viral cavity. For instance, phage phi29 exhibited disrupted structures keeping about 6% and 36% of the hydrated height for empty and dsDNA full particles, respectively. Furthermore, full virus particles expel their genome out of the capsid shell [33] . The capillary forces of the water menisci formed in the virus during the last stages of dehydration triggered these structural changes. Specifically, freeze drying of virus structures avoid menisci formation and reduce virus collapse during dehydration process [30] . These forces strongly depend on the existence of nanometric channels and pores at the virus shell that regulate the way that the water escapes from the virus [35] .",

These two particles could be easily separated by using a sucrose gradient centrifugation, and characterized by UV absorption spectroscopy and TEM [17] . The average yield per gram of dry feces of mTrV and Ecap was about 0.25 mg and 1.2 mg, respectively. When the starting material was the abdomen of dry insect corpses, the Ecap content with respect to mTrV was higher than that resulting from dry feces (Materials and Methods, MM). The diameter of both mTrV and Ecap particles as measured with dynamic light scattering (DLS) and as estimated from TEM experiments was about 30 nm. This value is coincident with the size determined from the crystallographic structure [13] and from cryo-TEM reconstructions [18] (figure 1(A)). After being treated with chelating agent, the samples of both particles did not experience any structural change, neither in height nor shape (SI figure S2 ). Moreover, we did not observe the disassembly by-products that could be indicative that removing ions from the structure affected particle stability. Figure 2 (A) shows a typical AFM topography of a single TrV particle obtained in the liquid condition. As usual [26, 27] the topographical profile, indicated by the blue arrows and depicted in figure 2(G) (blue), indicates that the particle height (~30 nm) is very close to the nominal diameter provided by the crystallographic atomic model (PDB code 3NAP; figure 1(A)).

This treatment most likely removes the cation from each hydrophobic gate located at the five-fold symmetry axis [40] . The topographical profiles of the particles imaged in liquid milieu (figure 2(C)) show once more a height similar to the nominal diameter (blue, figure 2(G)). After desiccation, the chelated particle results again in a featureless structure (figure 2(D)). However, its profile (red, figure 2(G)) reaches higher values (~27 nm) than particles with ions still located at the hydrophobic gates. For the sake of comparison, figures 2(E) and (F) show examples of empty Ecap under liquid and dried conditions, whose profiles (figure 2(G)) show a dramatic collapse of the structure in air conditions.

The main role these ions play in the capsid is structural, in the sense that they confer to the overall structure certain properties that are not associated with large changes in the protein fold. This can be illustrated by the fact that in both HRV14 and HRV16 the metal ions may play a role in viral disassembly, but no conformational changes are observed in the viral structures when the ions are removed [10] . In the case of TrV, it is also observed that the five-fold cavity of the virions capsid that contains the cations changes subtly changes in response to the capsid without cations [19] . It is obvious that in order for a cation to be part of a protein atomic structure, very stringent electronic conditions have to be fulfilled. However, if the protein structure is almost the same for both cavities (with and without ions), where does the structural difference reside? In light of our previous results modeling the solvation of the TrV capsid [40] , the presence of the cation at the five-fold symmetry axis could determine the hydration of the cavity. ",

TrV capsids demonstrate a similar behavior, and empty Ecap particles collapse dramatically after desiccation. In this case, we find that empty particles reduce their height to 9 nm, about 30% of the hydrated value ( figure 3) . However, mTrV capsids decrease their height to 84% of the hydrated value. This fact reveals that ssRNA in TrV, as dsDNA in other viruses, is an important contributor to keeping the virus structure under desiccation. In fact, the height of collapsed Ecap structures is very close to the thickness of two TrV capsid walls (~6 nn, figure 1(B) ). However, the most striking feature we found is that, in contrast with other viruses such as phi29 bacteriophage or the Minute Virus of Mice [33] , TrV capsids keep their genome inside after desiccation. This property seems quite adequate for TrV, which withstands stringent drying during long periods along its horizontal transmission, whereas feces dry in a few hours. If RNA leaves the capsid during dehydration, it seems very unlikely for it to be packed back in again without expressing new protein shells: this only happens in the cell environment. Consequently, for viruses transmitted through the fecal-oral route, retaining the genome inside the capsid during ambient exposure might constitute a necessary condition to complete the infection cycle.",

Nevertheless, one of the necessary features that permit the horizontal transmission of the virus in dry natural environments may be that the TrV capsid maintains its genome under stringent dehydration conditions. This feature could affect the recovery of TrV structural and infectious characteristics under proper hydration conditions, either in feces or the insect digestive tract. Therefore, a challenging experiment consists of characterizing the capsid structures with AFM after rehydrating the dried viruses adsorbed on the surface. Figure S6 (SI) presents an example of such experiment, showing a very inhomogeneous sample of unidentified specimens where it is difficult to separate virus particles from debris. We think that our experiment is probably not mimicking the natural rehydration conditions, and more effort should be invested in addressing this issue. We speculate that TrV being capable of keeping RNA inside under dehydrated ambient conditions is the result of evolutionary adaptation of this and other similar viruses to favor horizontal transmission.",

            "text": "Meanwhile, calculations show that the water density within cylindrical cavities with a diameter below 0.7 nm can be described as in a liquid-vapor transition [47] . This behavior depends on the pore diameter and hydrophobic/hydrophilic character of the amino acid lining the cavity. More recent experimental studies done in non-biological nanopores gave direct evidence of hydrophobic gating modulated by applying a voltage across the pore [48] . Our previous simulation of the TrV capsid [40] found that the hydrophobic barrier is removed if the divalent cation is placed in a point in the cavity that crystallographic studies assign to a coordinated ion [13] . When the ion is present, the cavity is fully hydrated and water molecules enter the hydrophobic neck, forming a line [40] . Due to the key role water molecules play in biological systems, the conduction of solvent and ions through proteins attracts the interest of both theoretical and experimental studies. In particular, the aquaporin family of water pores provides a remarkable example of water conduction through long (ca. 2 nm) and narrow (about 0.3 nm) means of traversing a protein body [45, 49, 50] . Since virus wall is the border of the virion with the external environment, its structure and porosity determine the release of water during desiccation [35] . In this respect, the hydrophobic character of the 12 transversal channels at the pentons of TrV capsid seems to influence the structure of virus particles after desiccation. Chelated particles, where the divalent ion has been removed from the channels, keep about 90% of the hydrated height ( figure 3) . However, the presence of divalent cations in TrV particles preserves about the 84% of the hydrated height ( figure 3) . When the hydrophobic character of the channels is active (chelated particles), virus capsids exhibit a larger height. We interpret that the hydrophilic character of these channels favors the water to escape from the virus cavity, removing water from the RNA. However, the hydrophobic channels (without ions) do not promote the water to leave, and the RNA remains hydrated. We suggest that the hydrated nucleic acids prevent virus deformation more efficiently than a dehydrated genome because the presence of water stabilizes the RNA's folding and structure [51] [52] [53] [54] . It is important to remark that both chelated and nonchelated particles do not result in collapse, but deformed structures after dehydration. However, according to figure S5, mTrV particles show higher deformation because their full width at half maximum (FWHM) is larger than that of the chelated mTrV. The ions' role of facilitating water escape contrasts with the intuitive thinking that the presence of ions should block the viral cavity. The presence or absence of ions might be useful in a natural environment in two ways. It is important to shuttle the water in and out to, on one hand, maximize virus stability during dry conditions and, on the other hand, allow hydration when needed for activating the virus for infection again.",

The insects are held at 28 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C, 60% \u00b1 5% relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 12:12 h (light:dark). Since insects of this colony composed of about 300-400 individuals die due to the infection, the colony is maintained by the incorporation of 100 monthly healthy nymphs free of TrV. The triatomines are in 400 cm 3 plastic containers covered with a nylon mesh, and are provided with vertical paper strips as resting places. The insects are fed every 15 d and prior to feeding the paper is removed in order to collect the dry fecal material.",

A fourth small protein, VP4, is disordered and buried at the capsid interior in contact with the RNA. The dashed red line approximately contours a penton made of 5 \u00d7 VP1-3. The close-up view shows the entrance of the cavity located at the five-fold symmetry axis. (B) Lateral view of a slab showing the penton with the cavity that traverses the capsid along the five-fold axis (for the sake of clarity, one protomer, i.e. three proteins, were removed). The surface represented corresponds to the solventaccessible area. The short arrow indicates the approximate position of the crystallographic electron density attributed to a divalent ion[13].",
