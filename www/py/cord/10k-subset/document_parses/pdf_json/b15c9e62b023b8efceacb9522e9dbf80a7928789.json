            "text": "Damage to the integrity of heparin sulfate (HS) in the endothelial glycocalyx is an important factor of glomerular filtration barrier dysfunction, which is the basic pathological feature of acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is a common clinical critical illness with few drugs options offering effective treatment. Phillyrin (Phil), the main pharmacological component of Forsythia suspensa, possesses a wide range of pharmacological activities. However, the effects of Phil on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AKI have yet to be reported. The aim of the present study is to analyze the effects of Phil on HS damage and inflammatory signaling pathways in LPS-induced AKI. Results revealed that Phil reduces pathological changes and improves renal function in LPS-induced AKI. Further analysis indicated that Phil effectively protects against glycocalyx HS degradation in LPS-stimulated EA.hy926 cells in vitro and LPS-induced AKI mice in vivo. The protective effect of Phil on HS damage may be associated with the isolate's ability to suppress the production of reactive oxygen species, and decrease expression levels of cathepsin L and heparanase in vitro and in vivo. In addition, ELISA and Western blot results revealed that Phil inhibits the activation of the NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways and decreases the levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1) in LPS-induced ARDS mice. In general, protection against endothelial glycocalyx HS damage and inhibition of inflammatory responses by Phil may be used as treatment targets for LPS-induced AKI.",

            "text": "Endothelial glycocalyx damage has an important impact on the pathogenesis of renal injury. The glycocalyx covers the surface of the vascular endothelial cells to regulate the glomerular filtration barrier function. Proteoglycans, such as heparin sulfate (HS), are the main component and form the skeletal of the glycocalyx. Glycocalyx HS is susceptible to degradation by a number of enzymes and oxidative damage. Marjolein Ggarsen et al. [7] reported that heparanase (HPA) degrades glycocalyx HS in the diabetic wild type mice. Henry Puerta-Guardo et al. [8] reported that cathepsin L is associated with dengue virus NS1-induced the endothelial glycocalyx damage. Excessive oxidation produces a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which induce oxidative damage in kidney tissues and the endothelial glycocalyx [9, 10] . Activation of inflammatory signaling pathways (e.g., NF-\u03baB and MAPK) can also induce excessive inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2) and affect renal vascular cell function, thereby leading to kidney damage. However, the mechanism of glycocalyx HS damage in LPS-induced AKI is unknown.",

Basement membranes and podocytes play important roles in glomerular filtration membranes [22] . The glycocalyx is essential for glomerular filtration [23, 24] and composed of HS, chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, and syndecan, among which HS is the most abundant. The glycocalyx coats the insides of the vessel lumen and is closely related to physical barriers and information transmission. An incomplete glycocalyx structure can lead to insufficiency of glomerular filtration and urinary albumin [23] . Therefore, protecting the endothelial glycocalyx against damage can help ameliorate kidney injury. In this study, the results confirmed the mechanism of damage of the endothelial glycocalyx HS in EA.hy926 cells and mice and showed that Phil significantly improves this damage.",

The NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways play an important role in mediating the inflammatory response. As the upstream signals of the inflammatory response, NF-\u03baB and MAPK are activated to induce downstream inflammatory responses, which produce excess inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2. AKI can initiate the inflammatory cascade associated with renal ischemia/ reperfusion injury and aggravate the development of renal injury [26] . The inflammatory response has a close relationship with the endothelial glycocalyx; indeed, this response can damage the endothelial glycocalyx and accelerate the spread of inflammation [27, 28] .
