Cyclic neutropenia is a relatively rare blood disorder characterized by regular cycling of neutrophil numbers and an associated periodic clinical syndrome of malaise, fever, mucosal ulcerations, infections, and lymphadenopathy (1, 2) . In some human cases (1) (2) (3) (4) and in the gray collie dog, a naturally occurring animal model (5) , other peripheral blood cell elements also cycle, prompting the term cyclic hematopoiesis (CH). Cycles occur with striking regularity between 14 and 30 days apart but are usually constant for an affected individual. About 25% of human cases have a genetic origin, with an autosomal recessive or dominant trait, and onset can be in infancy.",

Pharyngeal aphthous ulcers were noted by his father, who is a physician. The child was treated symptomatically with antipyretics and, after 3 days, was much improved, although the ulcers took about 10 days to entirely resolve. Sixteen days after onset of this first episode, the clinical syndrome and mouth ulcers recurred, then recurred again 14, then 21, days later. These episodes were not obviously associated with infections. While the mouth ulcers were present, occasional flecks of blood were noted in the stools. Immunofluorescence assay for herpes simplex virus and virus cultures of the ulcers were negative. At 4.5 months, the child developed a moderately severe laryngotracheobronchitis and was hospitalized for I 0 days. A general physical examination, including detailed opthalmologic exam, was negative. Tonsils, adenoids, and lymph glands were present, and the child had no dysmorphic features.",

Conditions were similar to those previously published (8) . Band intensity indicated a greater donor contribution to mononuclear-cell than to PMN-cell preparations. (Data not shown) DISCUSSION This child presented with strikingly periodic clinical signs and symptoms, and serial blood studies revealed oscillation of all cells, prompting an initial diagnosis of cyclic hematopoiesis. Less characteristic and disturbing aspects of his disease included a less regular periodicity, with attacks occurring 13-21 days apart, and quite severe and prolonged clinical attacks. However, in CH the lack of association between the duration and extent of neutropenia and the severity of clinical symptoms has been well documented (1) , and the absolute relationship of these has been questioned. Family studies and long-term follow-up of affected patients indicates that some individuals can have regular neutrophil cycles but remain free of clinical symptoms (1). Also, a clinical recovery, but no effect on neutrophil cycles, has been observed in patients treated with steroids (1, 9) , lithium (10, 11), or G-CSF (12) . These findings have raised the possibility that the clinical signs and symptoms are related to something other than neutropenia.",

Cases associating hypogammaglobulinemia and neutropenia (13) (14) (15) , or cyclic neutropenia (9), have been reported but there is little record of outcome in these patients. In some, there has been resolution of neutropenia with exogenous gammaglobulin therapy (I3, 14) but this had no effect on our patient. In other disorders of acquired or congenital neutropenia, affected children do not periodically develop the mouth ulcers that characterize CH and were a prominant feature of this child's disorder. Reticular dysgenesis, a severe immune deficiency with agranulocytosis, was ruled out by the presence of lymphoid tissue and bone marrow granulocyte precursors (16) . The documentation of normal numbers of functional T lymphocytes (albeit, periodically) initially ruled out a classic disorder of SCID. Moreover, this course was atypical from previously described cases of SCID, and to our knowledge, children with SCID have not been described with CH or mouth ulcers. The milder Nezelof variant (T-cell deficiency with immunoglobulins) was negated by the agammaglobulinemia. This patient did show relative increases in T-suppressor cells; patients with hematopoietic inhibitory T cells have been identified (17) and this can be associated with cyclic neutropenia (11) . However, we feel that this was not the etiology of our patient's blood dyscrasia because lymphocytes were virtually absent in bone marrow and blood prior to transplantation. This deficiency may have facilitated engraftment without prior chemotherapy.",

Retrospective review of his lymphocyte profiles detailed in Table I shows that he never manifested a normal distribution of cells. Progressive immune dysfunction could have occurred through failure to generate mature, functional T cells. Cycling of other blood cell elements might have resulted if periodic failure to generate lymphoid progenitors led to a periodic fluctuation in response of stem cells to other lineage specific early differentiation factors. The marked rise in numbers of other blood cells in the absence of lymphoeytes prior to transplantation supports this possibility. No metabolic defect was demonstrated in this patient's cells. His erythrocytes and a proportion of his neutrophils and lymphocytes have remained of recipient origin posttransplant. It is interesting that no recipient-derived lymphocytes were detected by cytogenetic analysis of 75 cells at 7 months posttransplant, compared to detection of 5% recipientorigin cells at 3 years posttransplant. It may be that not enough cells were counted earlier, although possible that there has been expansion of recipient cell clones over the years since transplant. We feel that these studies rule out a primary defect of the pluripotent stern cell and raise the possibility that this patient was deficient in a growth factor influencing the very early differentiation of lymphoid cells. Initially, he showed partial immune function and produced IgM and IgA prior to becoming agammaglobulinaemic, then developed combined immune deficiency. We wonder if this indicates the existence of a transplacentally derived maternal hematopoietic factor capable of acting on the bone marrow stem cell. Experience with G-CSF therapy has indicated that it is possible for peripherally infused hematopoietic factors to correct cyclic neutropenia (12) .",
