In 1918, for example, the pandemic virus appeared to produce at least 4-fold higher mortality across the entire age spectrum than did the pandemic virus of 1889.

This is an alarming observation, since these pathogenic HAs exist in nature around the globe in the wild waterfowl reservoir and will remain in existence for the foreseeable future, constituting a threat that must be prevented because it cannot be eliminated.

Yet it is far from clear that HI antibody alone reliably prevents asymptomatic or symptomatic infection in humans. In experimental human challenge studies, HI antibody is not a reliable determinant of protection [43] , and some persons with significant levels of HI antibody can be repeatedly infected by the same virus to which they have preexisting antibody (Memoli and Taubenberger, unpublished data) .

What was different about those persons who, in 1918, went on to develop severe and fatal disease?

It is noteworthy that to evaluate the \"universality\" of a putative universal vaccine, we must challenge humans with live or live chimeric viruses that are not among those that currently circulate in humans, including mammalian and avian IAVs with subtypes other than H1N1 and H3N2 (out of the 144 possible HA/NA subtype combinations found in nature).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Experimental Study in Universal Vaccine Development"}, {"text": "Without such research, a vaccine's universality remains unproven even for the viruses with which humans continually come into contact, and its utility as a stockpiled prepandemic or pandemic control vaccine would therefore be doubtful.

The best future influenza vaccines will ideally elicit robust and persistent protective immune responses to multiple epitopes on multiple influenza proteins expressed in multiple anatomical compartments, and immune responses capable of being productively recalled upon wild virus exposure.

mortality associated with, 4 pandemic influenza viral descendants of the 1918 pandemic virus that arose by antigenic shift, 1955-2016. A, Antigenic changes in postpandemic viruses. The colored bars represent prevalence of the 1957 H2N2 pandemic virus (red); the 1968 H3N2 pandemic virus (blue); the unexpected return of a 1950s-era descendant of the 1918 pandemic virus, presumably released accidentally from viral storage (amber); and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus (green). Antigenic drift changes of sufficient magnitude to require reformulation of the annual vaccine for use in the Northern Hemisphere are represented on the y-axis. Notably, the 1968 H3N2 has been drifting at a greater rate (an average 0.70 significant genetic changes per year) than the other 3 pandemic viruses (an average of 0.27 genetic changes per year for the 3 combined). Antigenic changes in postpandemic influenza viruses have been associated with antigenic drift, which introduces new epitopes or new glycosylation sites, and by intrasubtypic reassortment of an antigenically different HA of the same subtype, represented by vertical hash marks. B, Annual excess mortality rates attributed to influenza. Data are missing for some early years. The figures are obtained from or extrapolated from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data to reflect excess all-cause mortality, the most common calculation method available for all of the years, although arguably represent overestimations of mortality.
