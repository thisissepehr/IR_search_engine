The influence of the PEEP level was investigated on bacteriology and histology in a model of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Subjects: Nineteen New Zealand rabbits. Interventions: The animals were mechanically ventilated with a positive inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH 2 O and received either a zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP, n=6), a 5 cmH 2 O PEEP (n=5) or a 10 cmH 2 O PEEP (n=4). An inoculum of Enterobacter aerogenes was then instilled intrabronchially. The nonventilated pneumonia group (n=4) was composed of spontaneously breathing animals which received the same inoculum. Pneumonia was assessed 24 h later. Main results: The lung bacterial burden was higher in mechanically ventilated animals compared with spontaneously breathing animals. All animals from the latter group had negative spleen cultures. The spleen bacterial concentration was found to be lower in the 5 cmH 2 O PEEP group when compared to the ZEEP and 10 cmH 2 O PEEP groups (3.1\u20ac1.5 vs 4.9\u20ac1.1 and 5.0\u20ac1.3 log 10 cfu/g, respectively; p<0.05). Lung weight and histological score values were lower in the spontaneously breathing animals as well as in the 5 cmH 2 O PEEP group compared with the ZEEP and 10 cmH 2 O groups.

Although our results do not allow us to draw clear conclusions regarding this point, our histological data provide some interesting clues. We observed that adding 5 cmH 2 O PEEP was associated with a trend toward a reduction in lung injury in animals with pneumonia ventilated with a low tidal volume. Such findings could illustrate how PEEP reduces pulmonary-to-systemic bacteria translocation by preventing VILI in infected lung areas, as suggested elsewhere [26, 30] . Although speculative, other mechanisms could be considered. Thus, PEEP has been shown to reduce lung edema, to allow surfactant preservation and to redirect the blood flow into poorly aerated alveoli (e.g., infected lung areas) [1] . In addition, PEEP could have reduced the spleen perfusion. However, since we used a pressure-controlled ventilator, the three groups were not submitted to the same V T s and this may account for the differences observed in terms of lung injury. Therefore, the V T reduction subsequent to the addition of 5 cmH 2 O of PEEP could account, at least in part, for its benefit.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 376, "end": 380, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 844, "end": 848, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 849, "end": 852, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1083, "end": 1086, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "When a 10 cmH 2 O PEEP was applied (hPEEP group), significantly more bacteria were recovered from spleen cultures than in the lPEEP group. Concurrently, lung injury including pneumonia severity and emphysema-like lesions in non-pneumonic regions tended to be greater in the hPEEP than in the lPEEP group, possibly reflecting the extent to which the well-aerated lung regions were inflated, whereas poorly aerated alveoli could not be recruited because of the pneumonic lung stiffness. Our findings would be in accordance with the results of studies that attempted to assess lung aeration distribution in humans with ARDS. Indeed, some authors have shown that when lung injury was primary, i.e. aspiration or bacterial pneumonia, the addition of high PEEP could be deleterious since its application resulted in overinflation of the normally aerated lungs rather than in recruitment of the remaining poorly aerated lung [6, 31, 32] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 918, "end": 921, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 922, "end": 925, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 926, "end": 929, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Finally, some experimental studies have suggested that high PEEP levels might attenuate lung inflammation, resulting in a reduction in bacterial clearance [29, 33, 34] .

The assessment of inflammatory cells and biomarkers was not performed in the present study and we could therefore not corroborate these findings.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 155, "end": 159, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 160, "end": 163, "text": "33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 164, "end": 167, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 306, "end": 310, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "There are some limitations of our model. First, experimental results should been taken cautiously, especially when small animal species are studied. For example, small animals seem to be more prone to VILI and bacteria translocation from the lung than larger animals [1] . Second, the fact that the randomization to the different PEEP levels occurred before bacterial instillation could be questioned and may account for the different rates of pulmonary-to-systemic translocation, due to variable bacteria distribution. We tried to minimize this putative effect by performing a similar recruitment maneuver following the bacterial inoculation in animals from all PEEP groups. In addition, no significant difference was found between these groups in terms of lobar bacterial concentrations (data not shown). Third, since invasive monitoring was not used, one cannot rule out hemodynamic modifications that may have played a role in the systemic spread of the infection and in the ventilator-induced diffuse alveolar damage. Fourth, V T may have changed during the 24-h period of ventilation, due to changes in the lung mechanical properties in relation to the development of pneumonia. Therefore, the direct effect of PEEP on the pneumonia features cannot be ascertained. Fifth, since neither PaCO 2 nor arterial blood pH was monitored, an effect of hypercapnic acidosis on lung injury cannot be excluded. However, greater PaCO 2 values should be expected in the hPEEP group when compared to the lPEEP group, assuming that V T was lower in the former, that could in turn be lung protective [34] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 267, "end": 270, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1589, "end": 1593, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, our results suggest that the addition of PEEP is probably helpful in animals with bacterial pneumonia and submitted to a low V T [36] . However, the end-expiratory volume, if excessive, could be an important determinant of the degree of lung injury, as previously described in non-infected animals, which could, in turn, influence the systemic spreading of the infectious process [37] . These results should be taken as a word of caution by the clinician when setting the PEEP level in patients with pneumonia who require MV. It would be of interest to investigate in further in vivo or in vitro studies whether over-distension per se may impair local lung and/ or systemic immune defense against bacterial infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 144, "end": 148, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 395, "end": 399, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Ventilation-induced lung injury.
