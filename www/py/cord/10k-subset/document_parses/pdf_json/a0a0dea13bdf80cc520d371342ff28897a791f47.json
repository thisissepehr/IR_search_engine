Samples were collected on four sampling campaigns over a one-year cycle. Significant differences were found in the water column in dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, phosphate and total phosphorus concentrations between the fish farm and the control. The increase in the dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate concentrations at the fish farm modified the stoichiometric ratios between nutrients, with silicate acting as limiting nutrient at the fish farm 11% more than at the control. Nevertheless, chlorophyll a concentration in the water column was higher at the control station, probably due to the fouling of the underwater fish farm structures. Significant differences were found in sediment concentrations of organic matter, total phosphorus and redox potential between the fish farm and the control. The Canonical Correlation Analysis indicated that organic matter, total phosphorus, redox potential and% of gravels accounted for 68.9% of the total variance in the species data.

The largest source of waste in aquaculture is organic matter coming from the fish feed (Sanz-L azaro & Mar \u0131n 2011). Generally speaking, approximately 1/4 of the nutrients added via fish feed are incorporated into the fish meat itself, whereas 3/4 remain in the water (Holmer, Wildfish & Hargrave 2005) . This organic matter is relatively rich in organic carbon and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, released in particulate and dissolved form. The release of dissolved nutrients can provoke an enrichment of surrounding waters, giving rise to an increase in primary production in the affected areas (FAO 1992) , which in turn alters the composition of the algae species found in this area. The increase in algae biomass can lead to greater turbidity and lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the water column owing to the decomposition of algae biomass (La Rosa, Mirto, Favaloro, Savona, Sar a, Danavaro & Mazzola 2002; Garren, Smriga & Azam 2008) . Nevertheless, the impact of fish farming tends to be more noticeable in the benthos than in the water column, as the waste from the cages tends to accumulate around and under the fish cages (Vita & Marin 2007; Yucel-Gier, Kucuksezgin & Kocak 2007) . This accumulation of organic matter at the sediment surface increases the metabolism of the sediments which leads to increased oxygen consumption (Holmer & Kristensen 1992; Morata, Sospedra, Falco & Rodilla 2012) , as oxygen is used by aerobic bacteria as an electron acceptor in respiration.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 393, "end": 427, "text": "(Holmer, Wildfish & Hargrave 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 733, "end": 743, "text": "(FAO 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 997, "end": 1059, "text": "Rosa, Mirto, Favaloro, Savona, Sar a, Danavaro & Mazzola 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1060, "end": 1087, "text": "Garren, Smriga & Azam 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1280, "end": 1299, "text": "(Vita & Marin 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1300, "end": 1337, "text": "Yucel-Gier, Kucuksezgin & Kocak 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1512, "text": "(Holmer & Kristensen 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1513, "end": 1552, "text": "Morata, Sospedra, Falco & Rodilla 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Although organic matter is considered to be the greatest source of pollution from fish farming, there are other contaminants that can have an adverse effect on benthic communities, such as the metals Cu, Zn and Cd (Dean, Shimmield & Black 2007) as well as chemotherapeutic agents (Davies, Mchenery & Rae 1997) .

Spisula subtruncata (da Costa, 1778) was found at the fish farm in the sampling taken at the beginning of summer, with an abundance of 552 individuals m \u00c02 .

The dominant current direction among all measurements made at both sites was found to be northeast. This minimizes the possibility that the control station could have been influenced by fish farm waste, as the control station had been situated upcurrent from dominant sea currents. At both the fish farm installation and the control station, the water temperature during each sampling campaign varied according to the season. At the beginning of summer, no thermocline was observed, although there was a gradual decrease in temperature from the surface to the bottom due to the increase in incident solar radiation (Fig. 1a) . The lower DO concentrations in the water column observed at the fish farm with respect to those seen at the control station were due to oxygen consumption produced by fish respiration, consumption of organic matter through aerobic decomposition and the nitrification of the reduced forms of nitrogen. In every case, values were found to be higher than the 'farm's critical value' (3.7 mg L \u00c01 ), as per the recommended criteria established by Abo and Yokayama (2007) for sustainable aquaculture production. The highest DO values were observed in winter and spring, probably due to the lower temperature and greater primary production respectively. The highest concentrations of DIN in the water column registered at the fish farm installation were due to supplies of both NH 4 + and NO 3 \u00c0 +NO 2 \u00c0 . Ammonium nitrogen (Table 2) is the principal form of nitrogen that is excreted by the fish (Dosdat 2000; La Rosa et al. 2002; Aksu & Kocatas 2007) as well as the first component released by decomposition of organic matter in the water column and sediment. The particulate portion of the nitrogen from the fish farm which was deposited in the sediment was rapidly decomposed biochemically and reincorporated into the water column (Christensen, Rysgaard, Sloth, Dalsgaard & Schwaerter 2000; Aguado 2001; Cromey, Nickell & Black 2002) . The highest value of NH 4 + was found to be 11.4 lM, which meant that, given the temperature, salinity and pH of the water, 2.65% of this concentration was in the form of ammonia (Johansson & Wedborg 1980) , that is, 5.2 lg NH 3 . L \u00c01 . This value was substantially lower than the maximum NH 3 value recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (<100 lg NH 3 . L \u00c01 ) to avoid negative effects on fish growth. It was also lower than the levels recommended by Wajsbrot, Gasith, Krom and Popper (1991) for gil-thead seabream fish farms to avoid adverse effects on growth and survival (< 64 lg NH 3. L \u00c01 ). The differences observed in NO 3 \u00c0 +NO 2 (Table 2) , found in greater concentrations at the fish farm was probably due to the NH 4 + that was quickly oxidized to the less toxic NO 3 \u00c0 and NO 2 \u00c0 (Dosdat 2000) as well as from faecal nitrogen and non-ingested feed. We found generally lower concentrations of DIN during the sampling campaigns of spring and the beginning of summer compared with those of autumn and winter. This reflects the typical dynamics known for the western Mediterranean, caused by summer stratification of the water column due to shallow pycnoclines and maximum phytoplankton growth and nutrient uptake in the upper water layer due to increased temperature and irradiance (Maldonado et al. 2005) . We also observed differences at the fish farm installation compared with the control site, especially during the autumn sampling campaign for concentrations of PO 4 3\u00c0 and TP in the water column. This can be attributed to the excretion of phosphorus by fish in the form of dissolved orthophosphate, organic phosphorus compounds or non-ingested feed, which also contained phosphorus (Jover 2000) . The peaks found at intermediate depths for both DIN and de PO 4 3\u00c0 at the fish farm installation were probably due to fish excretion and the location of the fish in the cages when the samples were taken. In floating sea cages, the density of the fish can be affected by environmental gradients such as temperature, currents and variations in light (Juell & Fosseidengen 2004) . Fish are attracted to the optimum areas and avoid unfavourable areas. This causes high densities of fish in favourable areas with less competitive fish confined to the other areas and in lower densities (Johansson, Juell, Oppedal, Stiansen & Ruohonen 2007; It should be noted that significant differences were seen in the majority of nutrients analysed in the water column, with respect to other studies. The high spatial resolution of the water column parameters may have contributed to these results. There are studies such as that conducted by Kaymakci et al. (2010) in which significant differences were not observed for any of the parameters measured in the water column (oxygen or nutrients) at eight fish farms around Salih Island and at control station at each fish farm. However, there are other studies which have shown significant differences in some of the water column parameters measured at sea fish farms with respect to control sites. For instance, La Rosa et al. (2002) also found significant differences in PO 4 3\u00c0 concentrations; they did not, however, find differences in DIN. Yucel-Gier et al. (2007) found significant differences in NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations, although they did not find differences in NH 4 + , NO 2 \u00c0 and PO 4 3\u00c0 . Aksu and Kocatas (2007) also found significant differences in NH 4 + y PO 4 3\u00c0 concentrations, but not in DO, y NO 3 \u00c0 + NO 2 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 91, "end": 116, "text": "Aguado and Garc \u0131a (2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1221, "end": 1244, "text": "Abo and Yokayama (2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1669, "end": 1682, "text": "(Dosdat 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1683, "end": 1703, "text": "La Rosa et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1704, "end": 1724, "text": "Aksu & Kocatas 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2007, "end": 2066, "text": "(Christensen, Rysgaard, Sloth, Dalsgaard & Schwaerter 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2067, "end": 2079, "text": "Aguado 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2080, "end": 2109, "text": "Cromey, Nickell & Black 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2291, "end": 2317, "text": "(Johansson & Wedborg 1980)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2584, "end": 2624, "text": "Wajsbrot, Gasith, Krom and Popper (1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 2925, "end": 2938, "text": "(Dosdat 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3424, "end": 3447, "text": "(Maldonado et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 3832, "end": 3844, "text": "(Jover 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 4195, "end": 4222, "text": "(Juell & Fosseidengen 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 4428, "end": 4481, "text": "(Johansson, Juell, Oppedal, Stiansen & Ruohonen 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 4772, "end": 4794, "text": "Kaymakci et al.

Although it is not present in the waste produced by aquaculture (Maldonado et al. 2005) , silicate was also measured to calculate the stoichiometric ratios of nutrients, as another effect of increased nitrogen and phosphorus in the water column is the alteration of the stoichiometric ratio DIN:PO 4 3\u00c0 :Si. The criteria applied by Justic, Rabalais, Turner and Dortch (1995) were used in this study to identify the limiting nutrients at the fish farm and control station. Table 3 shows the percentages of cases in which each nutrient acted as a potential limiting nutrient, only taking into account nitrogen and phosphorus, as these nutrients are the ones that are added into the system by the aquaculture activity. It was observed that phosphorus was the limiting nutrient at the fish farm in three out of four sampling campaign (autumn, winter, beginning of summer), whereas phosphorus only acted as limiting nutrient at the control station in winter. This is probably attributable to the fish farm activity which releases just as much nitrogen into the system as it does phosphorus; however, nitrogen is released in far greater quantities. Moreover, much of the nitrogen is released in dissolved form whereas phosphorus is mostly in particulate form (Yucel-Gier et al. 2007 ; (Table 4) , it is observed that Si acts as the limiting nutrient at the fish farm facilities 11% more than at the control station. This may be explained by the fact that aquaculture releases are limited, mainly DIN and PO 4 3\u00c0 . Moreover, the limiting nutrient at the fish farm was mostly found to be PO 4 3\u00c0 (43%), followed by Si (33%), whereas the limiting nutrients at the control station were found to be PO 4 3\u00c0 and DIN, showing similar percentages (around 30%). It is also important to point out the higher levels of nutrients in the areas surrounding the fish farm, as these changes in the nutrients ratios generated by this activity could bring the increase of toxic phytoplankton species such as dinoflagellates in certain times of the year. Olivos, Mas o and Camp (2002) and Vila, Garc es, Mas o and Camp (2001) observed a relationship between the nutrient runoff along the continental water and/or the changes in the nutrients ratios induced by anthropogenic activities seasonal incidence and an increase in the presence of harmful dinoflagellates along the Catalan Coast and the North-western Mediterranean respectively. However, despite the greater availability of nitrogen and phosphorus in the areas surrounding the fish farm, we found higher concentrations of Chl-a at the control station. This runs contrary to the general prediction that a greater availability of nutrients should lead to an increase in Chl-a concentrations. This could be due to many factors: the hydrodynamics of the study area might have contributed to the dilution and dispersion; also, the potential effects of the various substances used in aquaculture (to control diseases and antifouling substances) on primary production and/or the role of macroalgae and suspensivores associated to the submerged structures of the fish farm. The hydro-dynamics of the study area (current velocity was found to range between 3 and 10 cm s \u00c01 ) could have added to dilution and dispersion, but this would also have affected nutrients such as phytoplankton biomass. We were also aware that this facility did not use antifouling substances as part of its management practices; thus, there was considerable biofouling. In addition, this study measured Chl-a concentrations in the water, which is not equivalent to the total primary production that may be taking place in the area; the role of macroalgae and suspensivores associated to the submerged structures of the fish farm and their direct consumption of nutrients and phytoplankton respectively was not taken into account. There are studies which attribute increased mussel growth (Cook & Black 2003) and macroalgae (Chung, Kang, Yarish, Kraemer & Lee 2002) to the nutrient enrichment of the water column in fish farms. Cook, Black, Sayer, Cromey, Angel, Spanier, Tsemel, Katz and Eden (2006) observed higher fouling biomass and different community compositions in fish farm installations as opposed to those of control sites. Although we did not measure biofouling biomass associated to the submerged fish farm structures directly, we were able to observe, albeit indirectly, significant growth at the fish farm installation. The dry weight of the valves found in the sediment under the cage was between 775 and 1247 g m \u00c02 . This was the result of the cleaning operations in place at the fish farm, where removal of biomass was not adequately handled and therefore much of said biomass ended up in the sediment under the cages. Cugier, Struski, Blanchard, Mazuri e, Pouvreau, Olivier, Trigui and Thi ebaut (2010) claim that the wild suspensivores associated to shellfish farming are key elements in the control of primary production and concentrations of chlorophyll a. Our study highlights the importance of researching vertical profiles in the water column as a means of evaluating the impact of fish farming. We found that at the fish farm installation there were lower concentrations of DO and higher concentrations of DIN, PO 4 3\u00c0 and PT than in the reference zone due to the aquaculture activity. The increase in the DIN and PO 4 3\u00c0 concentrations at the fish farm modified the stoichiometric ratios between nutrients, with Si acting 11% more as a limiting nutrient at the fish farm than at the control. Nevertheless, Chl-a concentration was higher at the control station. On the other hand, the seasonal changes observed in the majority of the variables studied in the water column were mainly due to the typical seasonal weather patterns of the Mediterranean (La Rosa et al. 2002; Maldonado et al. 2005) , since they occurred both at the fish farm and the control station.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 443, "end": 466, "text": "(Maldonado et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 711, "end": 753, "text": "Justic, Rabalais, Turner and Dortch (1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1632, "end": 1655, "text": "(Yucel-Gier et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 2409, "end": 2438, "text": "Olivos, Mas o and Camp (2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 4268, "end": 4287, "text": "(Cook & Black 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 4303, "end": 4344, "text": "(Chung, Kang, Yarish, Kraemer & Lee 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 4407, "end": 4479, "text": "Cook, Black, Sayer, Cromey, Angel, Spanier, Tsemel, Katz and Eden (2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 5117, "end": 5201, "text": "Cugier, Struski, Blanchard, Mazuri e, Pouvreau, Olivier, Trigui and Thi ebaut (2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 6160, "end": 6177, "text": "Rosa et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 6178, "end": 6200, "text": "Maldonado et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 851, "end": 858, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}, {"start": 1658, "end": 1667, "text": "(Table 4)", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}], "section": "Water column"}, {"text": "The differences between the fish farm and the control station in the percentage found in the sediment fraction (> 2 mm) were due to the shells coming from the fouling removal performed on the submerged structures of the fish farm. The OM content was consistently higher under the cages than at the control station, a finding which is known to occur under fish farm cages located in open seawater (Karakassis, Tsapakis, Hatziyanni, Papadopoulou & Plaiti 2000; Mantzavrakos et al. 2007; Borja, Rodr \u0131guez, Black, Bodoy, Emblow, Fernandes, Forte, Karakassis, Muxika, Nickell, Papageorgiou, Pranovi, Sevastou, Tomassetti & Angel 2009 ). OM in sediment mostly originates from non-ingested fish feed, either due to over-feeding or poorly managed diet. Accumulation of fish faeces, cultivated fish mortality and cage cleaning may also increase OM in the sediment (Molina & Vergara 2005) . The highest OM content was found under the cages in summer, due to the higher rates of organic matter deposition from the seabream production, which varies seasonally. As temperatures increase, fish metabolism increases and more fish feed is administered. This leads to greater excretion rates and fish feed wastage. This accumulation of organic matter at the sediment surface increases the metabolism of the sediments which leads to increased oxygen consumption (Morata et al. 2012) , as oxygen is used by aerobic bacteria as an electron acceptor in respiration.

The TP concentrations in sediments under fish cages in the Mediterranean Sea observed by authors such as Karakassis et al. (1998) and Porrello et al. (2005) , were of an order of magnitude that was similar to the concentrations found in this study. Eh in the sediments is a key factor in determining the biochemical transformation of organic matter as well as distribution, type and physiological activity of bacteria and other microorganisms found in the sediment (Teasdale, Minett, Dixon, Lewis & Batley 1998) . Eh was measured in the uppermost sediment layer. We found sediments under the cages to be consistently more negative, with the greatest negative value observed in early summer possibly due to the higher OM content.

The OM also partly explained the distribution and abundance of the species. There are greater quantities of OM under the cages ( Fig. 2a) and this produces a decrease in oxygen concentrations in the sediment, which affects species that show high sensitivity to oxygen depletion (Diaz & Rosenberg 1995) . In natural conditions, hypoxia is often associated with increased ammonia and hydrogen sulphide (Wu 2002) , substances which are toxic to most organisms. Although the CCA explained most of the variability in the two study zones as well as giving high correlations between the environmental and biological variables, other environmental variables not measured in this study were also a probable cause of the low diversity found below the cages. For example, other contaminants from fish farming activities, namely metals and chemotherapeutic agents may also adversely affect benthic fauna (Davies et al. 1997; Dean et al. 2007) , which may also lead to the disappearance of some species. Pinedo, Garc \u0131a, Satta, De Torres and Ballesteros (2007) classified the macrofauna of the Western Mediterranean area, according to each species sensibility/tolerance to organic enrichment in particular. Species were grouped into four categories: 1sensitive; 2 indifferent; 3tolerant; 4opportunist species. According to this classification system, species such as Ampelisca spinipes belong to group 1 (species which are very sensitive to organic enrichment and present under unpolluted conditions) and species such as Apseudes latreilli, Nephtys hombergi, Goniada maculata, Pectinaria koreni and Glycera sp belong to group 2 were only observed at the control station. At the CCA, these species appeared to the right on the factors diagram. However, Capitella capitata, the dominant species in the fish farm installation (Fig. 5c) and responsible for the high dominance of the macrofauna under the cages (Fig. 4 ) was classified as a member of group 4, that is, as an opportunistic species (in pronounced unbalanced situations). These are deposit feeders which proliferate in reduced sediments. The CCA showed that this species is associated with high values of OM, TP and gravel and highly reducing conditions in sediments. Karakassis et al. (2000) also found Capitella capitata to be the dominant species among macrofauna under two marine fish farms in the Mediterranean Sea. Capitella sp. is thought to be an indicator par excellence of anoxic conditions (Rosenberg 2001; Wu 2002) .

The fish farming activity also generated a significant change to the structure of the benthic community under the fish cages, with a notable decrease in specific richness and nearly a nine-fold increase in abundance.
