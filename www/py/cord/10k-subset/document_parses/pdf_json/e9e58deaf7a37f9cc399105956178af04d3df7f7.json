Reinvention can enhance (or impede) the likelihood of an IS innovation's acceptance and further diffusion. This paper reports on a case study of BioSense, an interorganizational system that was designed as an early detection tool for bio-terror attacks and subsequently modified to better serve this need as well as to operate as a public health system for pinpointing geographic clusters of dangerous/ acute disease outbreaks. By examining the interplay among the political and organizational dynamics and technical properties of the BioSense system, we shed light on processes affecting reinvention in an interorganizational context. We discuss our findings in light of theories of the diffusion and reinvention of innovations. We use Rogers' (1995) list of factors supporting reinvention to structure the discussion of the fidelity and uniformity of the innovation within the processes it supports in adopting health services organizations.",

            "text": "Innovation diffusion theory proposed that adopterswhether individuals or organizations-sometimes adapt or \"reinvent\" an innovation as they gain experience using it (Rogers 1995 ; see also Rice and Rogers 1980) . Herein, we prefer Rogers' term \"reinvention\" to refer to these innovation changes, to distinguish our work from prior IS research where the term \"adaptation\" describes how organizational processes and procedures are changed to accommodate the innovation, without actual changes to the IT artifact itself (see for example Cooper and Zmud 1990) . Reinvention usually enhances the likelihood of an innovation's acceptance and further diffusion. Reinvention may affect an individual user (as when an individual customizes software developed by someone else to suit his/her specific requirements) or an organization (as when a new scheduling system is introduced to reduce patient waiting time in a medical facility, then modified to better suit the needs of the adopting organization and/or its users). Rogers (1995) proposed that reinvention can be spurred by a variety of factors, including: Although Rogers called for further research on reinvention especially from an organizational perspective (versus user-adopted technologies, which have been extensively studied), few researchers have focused on reinvention. Hays (1996) studied how state policies enacted as laws were reinvented as they were diffused into subsequent states, finding that policies were reinvented based on a combination of social learning, political characteristics, and contextual factors. Lewis and Seibold (1993) consider two components of innovation reinvention, distinguishing between fidelity (how well the reinvention matches the original intent of the design or intended use) and uniformity (referring to the degree of similarity of use across users). They illustrate their framework in a single organization by studying characteristics of adopting individuals. When considering an innovation that is intended to be adopted by a large number of potentially dissimilar organizations, studying both aspects of fidelity and uniformity at the organizational level is likely to increase understanding of the importance and complexity of reinvention in a largescale diffusion (informal) or dissemination (formal) effort.",

One review of the extensive diffusion-ofinnovations literature (Chin and Marcolin 2001) concludes that while much attention has been given to factors affecting potential adopters' attitudes and intentions, further study is needed on \"the technological context and interactions such as interface design, data structures, training, and actual usage behavior...\" (p. 9, emphasis added).

In addition, unlike the corporate or government sectors, multiple hierarchies exist in the social networks of the medical professions (West et al. 1999; Dopson et al. 2002) . Doctors have flatter, more informal networks than nurses' hierarchical ones. As a result, doctors are more likely to be effective at influencing peers to adopt or reinvent innovations.

In 1928 all states were required to report on 29 \"notifiable\" diseases, and in 1961 CDC was given responsibility for aggregating and publishing the states' surveillance data. Unfortunately, many diseases are tracked via separate data collection processes and systems, leading to a proliferation of incompatible applications and databases (Potts and Fraser 2000, p. 5) .

It is not very effective in responding quickly and effectively to outbreaks of rapid-onset, highly contagious diseases. For example, in 1993 a waterborne parasitic infection in Milwaukee sickened 400,000 and killed 100 people (Foldy 2004) . This traumatic event sparked several local early detection initiatives in that region, but over the next decade little progress was made on a nationwide basis. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Julie Gerberding, traditional surveillance procedures, which aim to confirm that a particular disease is involved, emphasize data accuracy and completeness at the expense of timeliness. Dr. Gerberding stated that during the post-9/11 anthrax attacks in fall of 2001 \"the style of not wanting to make a decision until you have all the data gathered and you have the nice tied-up package was a deterrent to effective decision making on a day-to-day basis\" (as quoted in Altman 2002 ; see also Henning 2004; Stolberg and Miller 2001) .",

As compared with disease surveillance, syndromic surveillance analyzes the symptoms that patients are experiencing (versus confirmed diagnoses, which of necessity come later). With this context in place, we now introduce Biosense, followed by a discussion of its reinvention led by its early adopters and proponents. . In the same year, Harvard Medical School physicians in the health care informatics program at Children's Hospital Medical Center in Boston began developing a pre-diagnostic syndromic surveillance system. Both initiatives involved capturing patient chief complaints data. Dr. Kenneth Mandl recalled that interest in bio-terror surveillance was already rising before September 11, 2001 and accelerated rapidly after the attacks:",

[Based on a proposal prepared in 1999] we received funding from the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality in 2000 for a bio-preparedness contract. The work we were doing became very, very popular in 2001. [Even before the 9/11 attacks], early in 2001 the federal commitment to bio-surveillance went from $50 million a year to more like $300 million a year. After the attacks in 2001, things really heated up. Since we were already on the ground and running, we expanded quite rapidly and I developed a contract with the Massachusetts Dept of Public Health to run the Massachusetts Surveillance System (MSS).\" Thus, before September 11, 2001, work was already underway (in Boston and Pittsburgh) to develop regional syndromic surveillance systems for rapid detection. At the national level, efforts were initially focused on developing standards and common systems for traditional disease surveillance, but after the 9/11 anthrax attacks the CDC sponsored work on real-time pre-diagnostic syndromic surveillance at the national level, with the BioSense system.",

NEDSS is responsible for routine disease surveillance (primarily the traditional but consolidated notifiable disease program, which emphasizes reporting of confirmed disease outbreaks), while Bio-Sense is for syndromic surveillance, i.e., less precise early detection, based on chief complaints, laboratory orders and other data that help identify symptom clusters (Henderson 2003) .

As discussed in the literature review, Rogers (1995) found that reinvention can be spurred by one or more of six factors: Changes in adopters' knowledge about what the technology can do, adopters' attempts to simplify innovations that are perceived as overly complex (\"simplification\"), adopters' need to customize a general-purpose tool (\"customization\"), adaptation to multiple problems, local \"pride of ownership\", and encouragement (or pressure) by a change agent. Consistent with Rogers, we found evidence of reinvention corresponding to many of these factors. Recognizing that not all of these factors pertain to the reinvention of a particular innovation, in the following sections we emphasize where and how these factors come into play as we present how Biosense was adapted by its users and designers. To begin, we note adaptation-related issues related to the fidelity and uniformity of the BioSense innovation, in its dissemination among adopting organizations.",

Several argued that an alert physician was more likely to note an early instance of symptoms indicating a possible bio-terror attack or unusual disease outbreak, as had happened in the 2001 anthrax attacks. So, very early in the BioSense rollout, the first shift came in re-articulating the goal of BioSense away from noting the first instance of an occurrence of symptoms that might point to an outbreak, to what the designers referred to as \"situational awareness\": using data to confirm (or disconfirm) an outbreak, to pinpoint where resources are most needed and to direct resources away from localities that do not show clusters of chief complaint symptoms. BioSense rapidly delineates geographic clusters of diseases or symptoms, and (even more important, in the view of one informant) helps to verify that a possible cluster is not cause for concern. Our informants emphasized also that BioSense was designed to spot geographic and time trends in sanitized (or de-identified) data, not to reveal nuances of individual patient data.",

As time passed and criticism intensified, participants came to realize that the BioSense tools that allowed chief complaints data to be shared and analyzed among hospitals could, with some modification also be used to confirm suspicions of naturallyoccurring outbreaks, such as SARS or West Nile virus, as well as food-or water-borne contamination and other communicable diseases.

By doing so, he increased the likelihood of institutionalizing the system by promoting its use in routine situations, and it was no longer reserved for detection of very unlikely events.",

Asked about this, an informant explained that in the absence of bio-terror attacks, a consensus had developed among participating hospitals, statisticians and public health officials that they should expand (or customize, in Rogers' terms) the system to include symptoms and complaints associated with naturally-occurring outbreaks. With this move to officially condone the dual uses of the system, its designers became supportive change agents for BioSense's institutionalization into users' routine processes.

Individuals' reactions to BioSense clearly demonstrated the need for simplifying data entry. Minimization of manual input was considered especially important. Early syndromic surveillance efforts relied on doctors, nurses and administrators to manually fill out checklists of symptoms and other data. This was found to be infeasible; clinicians feel they are simply too busy providing care to take extra time to record information that is not immediately valuable to them. One doctor noted: \"If for your bio-surveillance system you require a nurse, administrator or physician to click off new data elements on a daily basis or a per patient basis-even worse!-you're no longer in business.\"",

While much clinical transaction data is now recorded in the national HL7 standard, free-text descriptions of chief complaints are not yet standardized (there is not yet a fully standardized nomenclature for physicians to describe what they hear from their patients). The codes for various procedures and tests are also not yet uniform; while these tend to be homogeneous within a care setting, they are not standardized across settings.

For example, a study reported by Tyre and Orlikowski (1994) revealed that the process of reinvention (which they termed \"technological adaptation\") was heavily influenced by timing, with the greatest amount of reinvention taking place shortly after adoption. Routinization subsequently led \"the technology and its context of use to congeal, often embedding unresolved problems into organizational practice.\" Rather than observing a process of continuous adaptation (as was predicted by many in the literature) Tyre and Orlikowski observed long periods during which the innovation was not changed, punctuated by occasional short-lived episodes of reinvention. Thus, longitudinal studies remain the gold standard for learning about post-adoption behaviors including reinvention.",

There was no single stakeholder that initiated the expanded mission of Biosense.

They recommended expanding the system to include syndromic surveillance for rapid onset diseases such as influenza and later for an even broader set of medical conditions. Meanwhile, some stakeholders balked at replacing locally developed efforts with one imposed on them by a national body. Physician opinion leaders promoted and eased implementation efforts among their professional peers.

These factors served to reinvent the mission over time, leading to increased flexibility by adapting Biosense to a broader scope of problems. BioSense continues to be an important tool for use in the (hopefully rare) event of a bio-terror attack, but in addition it is already serving as a useful tool for use by public health officials and clinicians in more common outbreaks of naturally occurring acute diseases.

They used their extensive professional networks to obtain funding to demonstrate how patient data could be repurposed to detect patterns among symptoms and treatments. At the same time, the government was intent on finding a way to address the homeland security fear of a bio-terror attack, which loosed the purse strings to fund syndromic surveillance projects. The critical events of 9/11 and the anthrax scare plus the availability of data collected in health care IS further helped to grown nascent programs.

The system as originally envisioned was intended to detect infrequent or even highly unlikely events (a bioterror attack). Given the low likelihood of such an occurrence, the added value of the system to any one locale could easily be overshadowed by the added \"cost\" of complying with its extensive data entry requirements. By extending its coverage to more detection of conditions that occur more frequently (such as influenza), the value of the system increased to adopting organizations. The incorporation of a new BioSense Influenza Module for the 2008 flu season is evidence of this transition (Lipowicz 2008) . Indeed, prior research has found that routine use of a system that also supports emergency situations can greatly increase the acceptance of such a system. For example, the public safety network CapWIN was initially envisioned to support largescale emergency collaboration. It was only when its value was demonstrated for day-to-day public safety support that it gained a critical mass of adopters (Fedorowicz et al. 2006 (Fedorowicz et al. , 2007 .
