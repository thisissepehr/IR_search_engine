Information about disease severity can be obtained by investigating intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, especially when historical comparisons can be made with cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted in 155 ICUs contributing to the GiViTI national database. To assess the impact on ICU workload, the occupancy rate during the epidemic phase was compared with influenza periods in previous years. A logistic regression model was developed to assess the prognostic importance of A(H1N1) influenza. Results: The characteristics of the 319 A(H1N1) cases were similar to those reported in other studies, confirming the young age of patients (mean 43 years) and the higher prevalence among pregnant women and obese people. At the epidemic's peak (October-December 2009) the occupancy rate did not significantly differ from the same period of the previous year, and was significantly lower than the 2009 seasonal influenza outbreak (January-March 2009). Compared with CAP of other origin (3,678 patients), A(H1N1) pneumonia was associated with a lower risk of death. However, after adjusting for confounding this was no longer the case (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.59-1.31; p = 0.52). Conclusion: This study confirmed the specific features of critically ill A(H1N1) patients (i.e., young age, pregnancy, obesity). The pandemic did not increase ICU workload compared with other periods.

Looking at the raw data, obesity seemed to be a less important risk factor for ICU admission in Italy than in Australia and Canada. However, adjusting for the lower prevalence of obesity in Italy [21] , these differences disappear.

In the absence of detailed information, we cannot ascribe the increase in ICU admissions at the beginning of 2009 to seasonal influenza. In other words, we cannot state that patients with 2009 seasonal influenza were more prevalent in the ICUs than those with A(H1N1) influenza, at their corresponding peaks. Nevertheless, on comparing the density of CAP per 1,000 ICU beds in the last 7 years (Fig. 3) with the incidence of seasonal influenza provided by the Ministry of Heath (see ESM) the two phenomena are seen to clearly overlap. This suggests that at least the peak in ICU CAP may be related to seasonal influenza. At any rate, the observation that the Italian ICUs were not overcrowded . The average weekly occupancy rate was obtained by dividing the number of occupied beds each hour by the total number of beds available in the ICUs, and averaging the hourly rates over the week. This provided a very precise estimate that takes account of patients staying just a few hours in the ICU Fig. 3 Density functions of CAP during the seasonal influenza periods in different years during the A(H1N1) influenza outbreak, proves that the ICU system, which already has very high occupancy rates, was able to absorb the H1N1 wave without additional workload. However, we do not know whether this was achieved by transferring critically ill patients, delaying elective surgery, or by other strategies.
