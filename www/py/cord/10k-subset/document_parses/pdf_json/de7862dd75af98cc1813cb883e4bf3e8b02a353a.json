Third, intervention of risky behaviors or treatment of already infected patients through active participation of medical professionals is equally important in minimizing the impact of the existing prevalence of this disease. Improved knowledge of diagnosis, treatment and patient care among point-of-care medical professionals could play a very important role in limiting the spread of this disease. Fourth, adaptations of successful strategies and avoiding the mistakes made by other countries through international collaborations have to be an integral part of this battle against the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China. Finally, active researches in understanding of the basic biology of the AIDS virus in an effort to find a cure or to develop a potent vaccine against this viral infection should be the ultimate goal of this pathogen-host or HIV/AIDS-human interaction.",

Although it is not our intention to do so exhaustively, it covers epidemiology, social behavior, governmental policies, and roles of non-governmental organizations, patient care and treatment, as well as areas of basic science research. This special issue is intended to provide a comprehensive and primary scientific reference to those who are interested in HIV/ AIDS in China. To my knowledge, this is the first attempt in the scientific community to describe HIV/AIDS in China in such a comprehensive way through scientific publications. Another unique feature of this special issue is that all of the articles included here are contributed by experts in this special field.",
