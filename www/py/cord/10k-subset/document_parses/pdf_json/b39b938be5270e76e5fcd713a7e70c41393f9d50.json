Barton\u00edkov\u00e1 Antibiotic resistance can be transferred among strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by conjugation [1] , transduction by wild-type phages as well as by generalised transducing phages, such as F-116 or G-101 [2] [3] [4] [5] , or by transposition of integrons [6] . While determinants of resistance can be transferred by conjugation from Pseudomonas aeruginosa to, for example, Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis recipient strains, transduction by bacteriophages is a species-specific event. Nevertheless, it could be also an important factor contributing to the dissemination and spread of antibiotic resistance among Pseudomonas aeruginosa in clinical settings [5] .",

This phage, in contrast to bacteriophages described previously, exhibited two rather peculiar properties: the frequency of transduction was unusually high (10 -5 to 10 -6 in comparison with, for example, 10 -7 to 10 -9 for phages 37, 38, and 40 [5] ), and the phage AP-103 was lytic to a single recipient strain, i.e., the PAO strain, and showed no evidence of a lytic reaction to ML recipient strains, i.e., to Pseudomonas aeruginosa ML-1008, ML-1292, or ML-M-88. Nevertheless, it transduced genes of antibiotic resistance to both PAO and ML series of strains.",

The sterile phage lysate AP-103 was added to each recipient strain in an amount sufficient to obtain a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 pfu/cell. The time allowed for phenotypic expression of transduced determinants was 60 min. The surface of antibiotic-containing plates (with 100 mg/ml of streptomycin, kanamycin, or carbenicillin, or 30 mg/ml of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, or aztreonam) was then inoculated with a mixture of bacteria plus the phage. Identical plates were inoculated in parallel with the control (recipient bacteria only, without phage added). Antibiotic-containing plates were then incubated at 35 7C for 36 h and 48 h, and number of transductants was recorded. Transductants were then picked from each experimental plate and examined by an indirect selection procedure for their complete spectra of transduced resistance.",

Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that some phages, including phage AP-103 described here, transduce genes of antibiotic resistance, mainly in a block of resistance determinants, to several recipient strains at an unexpectedly high frequency, which might play an important role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance among nosocomial strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",
