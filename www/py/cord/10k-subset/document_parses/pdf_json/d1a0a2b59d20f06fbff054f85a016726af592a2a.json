Furthermore, regarding the nylon fiber system as an artificial but relevant model for endothelial cell adherence [2] the observed inhibition by PGE1 of adherence and CL response seems to be of marked pathophysiological importance. Since the contact activation/stimulation of neutrophils was inhibited and less inflammatory mediators were produced, less endothelial cell and tissue structure damage can be produced in an in vivo system. The good correlation of adherence and CL production in absence and in presence of PGE1 indicated that the oxygen radical production is nearly exclusively caused by adherence-mediated stimulation and can be inhibited by PGE1. As a result, PGEI may be a drug to prevent inflammationinduced damage of capillary endothelial structures in different disorders, e.g. the adult respiratory distress syndrome. The present study is based upon the theory that polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL, neutrophils) play an important role in inflammatory reactions [4] . Further investigations hypothesize that affection of endothelial cells (EC), mediated by lipopolysac-% control charide (LPS)-stimulated neutrophils, is rather caused by oxygen derived metabolites than by lysosomal enzymes [5, 7] . In-120 vestigations, performed with endothelial cells, have shown a respiratory burst stimulation of neutrophils during adherence of neutrophils to EC and amplification of this process by previous LPS-priming of neutrophils [3] .",

Granulocytes are obviously sensitised by activated complement deposited in excessive quantities in pancreatic parenchyma. Later on, the release of toxic oxygen metabolites from activated granulocytes persists in a systemic circulation level and becomes independent of the inflammatory process in the pancreas. Stimulating agents, such as zymosan, zymosan-activated plasma, or endotoxin drastically increase the release of toxic oxygen radicals from sensitised granulocytes, causing an even greater damage to the organs. That is why chemiluminescence response of granulocytes is much higher in systemic blood than in blood from the portal vein after 24 h. Our study gives rise to the assumption that complement-induced activation of granulocytes and the release of toxic oxygen metabolites are essential pathogenetic factors in the development of MOF as sequela of acute pancreatitis. We believe that the prognosis of this disease can be considerably improved by therapeutic use of antioxidants. Macrophages are crucially involved in the regulation of various immune reactions. They represent a heterogeneous group of cells not only due to their different tissue origin but even more attributable to distinct activation stages during which they acquire additional receptors, metabolic functions and capacities. Reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) such as the superoxide anion radical (Oy) or hydrogen peroxide (H2Oz) contribute to the development of cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities and also play an important role in inflammatory processes [4] . The amount of ROI production strongly correlates with macrophage activation where-at fully activated cells are the most effective producers after addition of appropriate stimuli [3, 5] . ROI decay leads to the emission of small amounts of light but this chemiluminescence (CL) is enormously intensified in the presence of chemical amplifiers such as luminol and lucigenin [1] . In the report we describe a method for the determination of lucigeninenhanced CL of resident or in vivo preactivated mouse peritoneal macrophages using a 96-well microtiter system (Amerlite research luminometer).",

Using DPA as fluorescer in a concentration of 150 rag/1 in ethanolic DCC-solution and in the presence of 1 mol/1 oxalic acid solution, determination of H 2 0 : can be achieved down to limiting concentration of 10-8 mol/1 at pH = 1, with peak maximum within 0.4 s and the reaction being completed to 80 p.c. within 2 s after start. This shows that this procedure can also be used for the determination of enzymes or substrates which are in direct relation to H202 (e.g. systems catalyzed by oxidase or peroxidase). Acridinium esters are highly chemiluminescent molecules with high quantum yield and rapid reaction kinetics [5] . DNA probes can be labeled with acridinium esters using alkylamine linker arms to approximately the same specific activity as the free ester. We have identified conditions in which acridinium ester linked to unhybridized probe is hydrolyzed to a non-chemiluminescent form, while ester linked to hybridized probe is protected [1] . We have incorporated chemiluminescent labeled probes into a homogeneous DNA probe assay referred to as the Hybridization Protection Assay (HPA) and applied the assay to the detection of Hepatitis B (HBV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) DNA sequences. Rapid and sensitive detection methods for screening large numbers of samples in a simple format are needed for clinical diagnoses as well as basic research endeavors, particularly in clinical syndromes in which currently available tests or serological tests cannot be used to follow the course of infection. HIV and HBV are present in levels too low to allow consistent detection by direct methods. Detection of these low levels of virus is made possible by specific amplification of viral nucleic acids by enzymatic methods including the polymerase chain reaction or PCR [4] or transcription-based amplification methods [2] . Current methods for detection of the specific amplification products include visualization after gel electrophoresis and hybridization in solution or to immobilized targets. These methods require many steps and several hours to days to complete, and often involve radioisotopic DNA probes. We demonstrate that HPA is a rapid and sensitive method for detection of HIV and HBV DNA amplified by PCR.",

Ten microliters of the PCR reaction were denatured at 95\u00b0C and hybridized to AE-labeled probe at 60 \u00b0 C, followed by a differential hydrolysis step at the same temperature. After differential hydrolysis, remaining chemiluminescence was a direct measure of the amount of hybrid formed. Detection of chemiluminescence was performed with a Leader I luminometer.

A single band was seen on EtBr-stained agarose gels, confirming the specificity of the primer sequences. When dilutions of HBV cloned DNA were amplified and then analyzed by HPA, reactions containing as few as 10 copies of input HBV DNA gave chemiluminescent signals significantly above background, even when only 10% of the sample was analyzed. The quantitative capabilities of HPA were demonstrated by analyzing serial dilutions of HBV + serum. The assay showed a linear response over three logs of target dilution. One HBsAg + serum was positive by HPA even when diluted 10V-fold prior to amplification. We have also applied HPA to specifically detect HIV-1 DNA amplified by PCR using gag-region primers described in Ou et al. [3] . Amplifications containing less than 10 copies of input HIV-I DNA gave signals significantly above background.
