Moreover, readiness of an individual to this or that behavioral program can be determined by genetic factors. In this study, mice of different genetic strains were used, but no significant effect of the genotype on behavior of mice was revealed. Therefore, data from different genotypes were combined and results of one-way analysis of variance are shown. Acute (single) administration of camphecin had no effect on locomotor activity in the center and at the periphery of OF, as well as on the number of rearings ( Table 1 ). The animals demonstrating high physical activity and intensive rearing in the test were considered low emotional with high exploratory motivation. Exploration of central squares of OF by animals attests to low fear. However, experimental mice receiving single camphecin injection showed significantly increased freezing time in OF in comparison with the controls (Table 1) , which was interpreted as increased anxiety. Grooming time and autonomic activity (number of fecal boluses) also indicated increased anxiety in OF [3] . No changes in grooming time were observed in mice receiving single camphecin injection in comparison with the control group. At the same time, autonomic activity was reduced after camphecin administration (Table  1) , which can indirectly attest to changes in the tone of the parasympathetic regulation centers [5] .
