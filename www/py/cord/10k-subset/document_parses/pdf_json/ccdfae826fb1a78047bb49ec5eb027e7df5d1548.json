Here, we investigated whether histone deacetylases (HDACs) are activated in RTECs during T cell-mediated inflammation. Human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line HK-2 was cultured in the presence or absence of recombinant interferon gamma (IFN-g) 200 U/ml plus tumor necrosis factor alpha(TNF-a) 5 ng/ml. The HDAC activity was determined on the expression levels of acetylated H3 and a-tubulin by immune blot assay. To determine the functional activity of HDAC inhibitor SB939, we analyzed the immune stimulatory phenotype of HK-2 cells such as class II MHC molecule, CD80, CD86, and CD40 by flow cytometry. We found that HDAC activity was markedly increased in HK-2 cells by treatment of IFN-g/TNF-a within 12 hours. Treatment of pan-HDAC inhibitor SB939 in HK-2 cells completely prevented HDAC activity. SB939 treatment predominantly inhibited upregulating CD40 expression but not MHC class II, CD80, and CD86. MCP-1 was significantly inhibited more than IL-6 and TNF-a by SB939 treatment. Our results demonstrate that 1) HDAC activity is increased in RTECs in response to 2) which further facilitates T cell-mediated inflammatory responses through CD40 and MCP-1.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Immune complex (IC) deposition leading to vasculitis has been described in autoimmune disorders, as has the association between IC disease and complement deficiency. We present a patient with complete C3 deficiency and concurrent hypogammaglobulinemia treated with intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIg) who exhibited a vasculitis temporally associated with IVIg treatments. A 14-year-old male originally presented at 6.5 years of age with complicated pneumonia and a history of recurrent sinopulmonary infections. Immunologic work-up revealed hypogammaglobulinemia which was treated with immunoglobulin therapy for several years when he developed an episodic vasculitis. Further evaluation revealed a homozygous mutation causing complete absence of the C3 component of complement. While optimizing his immunoglobulin dose for immunoprotection, a temporal association was made between larger, more frequent IVIg infusions and episodes of leukoclastic vasculitis. This case uniquely demonstrates the well-established propensity towards IC deposition in a complement deficient patient. A large bolus of ICs, as supplied by infused IgG binding to circulating antigens, overwhelms the patient's faulty clearance mechanisms leading to episodes of vasculitis. Transitioning to lower dosage immunoglobulin infusions ameliorated this problem, eliminating further vasculitic episodes. severity and mortality, possibly by promoting regulatory T cells (Tregs) . However, few data have been reported about the impact of this drug on overall T cell population. The present work aims at investigating the mechanisms by which RAPA impacts GVHD in a humanized mouse model of GVHD (NSG mice infused with human PBMCs). We observed that RAPA injections significantly reduced xenogeneic GVHD lethality and severity. RAPA dramatically reduced human cells chimerism in RAPA mice and increased CD4 + /CD8 + T cells balance due to a lower proliferation of CD8 + T cells. In addition, the frequencies of naive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were higher and the CD4 + T cells s h o w e d a r e d u c e d e f f e c t o r p h e n o t y p e (CD45RO + CD27 -). Further, the differentiation of helper T cells (Th1, Th2 and Th17) was significantly decreased in treated mice. Tregs were positively affected as RAPA up-regulated their expression of BCL-2 and KI67 as well as their STAT5 phosphorylation level, leading to higher Treg frequency in treated mice. Altogether these data suggest that RAPA ameliorates GVHD by lowering cytotoxic and effector CD4 + T cells frequency as well as promoting Tregs. met criteria for complete DiGeorge anomaly with either a heart defect or hypoparathyroidism. Eighty two percent of athymic patients with CHARGE syndrome transplanted before 2013 survived at least two years post-thymus transplantation. In the first 2 years after thymus transplantation, all surviving patients with CHARGE syndrome developed na\u00efve CD4 T cells. Conclusions: The data suggest that many athymic patients have CHARGE syndrome. Recognition of T cell deficiency in CHARGE patients is critical for prompt referral for thymus transplantation. Introduction:The measurement of T cell receptor excision circles (TREC) on routine newborn screening (NBS) enables the early diagnosis of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID). Here we report a case of a newborn with low TRECs on NBS that led to an early diagnosis of properdin deficiency carriage. Case Report: A 9 day old, full term, female newborn, presented with low TREC levels. The infant's nursery course was complicated by Streptococcal pneumoniae septic shock, respiratory failure, and E. coli tracheitis during her first 2 weeks of life. TREC values were 93, 0, 0, average of 31 copies/\u03bcL. Immune evaluation revealed a low AH50 (36, reference range \u2265 46) at 18 days of life, which was repeatedly low (15) at 5 weeks of life. CBC, lymphocyte enumeration, immunoglobulin levels, CH50 and MBL were unremarkable, and chronic granulomatous disease assay was negative. TREC levels repeated at 2 weeks and at 5 weeks of life were normal. Evaluation of the AH50 pathway revealed a low properdin level (18.2 mcg/ml, reference range 22.3 -67.6), normal Factor B and mildly elevated Factor D, consistent with the diagnosis of properdin deficiency carriage. Conclusion: Infants with primary immunodeficiency have diverse clinical presentations, and complement deficiency should be considered in the differential diagnosis. An abnormal NBS with low TREC level can help identify other immunodeficiencies besides SCID. Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID), the most common primary immunodeficiency, is often complicated by the development of autoimmune disease, malignancy, and lung disease. Patients with CVID may present with generalized lymphadenopathy that can be easily mistaken for lymphoma. Cases: Patient 1 is a 50-year-old healthy male who was diagnosed with generalized lymphadenopathy on CT and PET scans that was suggestive of malignancy. Lymph node biopsy showed noncaseating granulomas without evidence of lymphoma. Immunoglobulin levels were low with poor vaccine response. IL-2 receptor was elevated at 1363U/mL (normal 109-663U/ mL). He was diagnosed with CVID with granulomatous disease. Patient 2 is a 63-year-old female with diagnosis of CVID, sarcoidosis, bronchiectasis, and remission from B-cell lymphoma. Surveillance CT and PET scans were suggestive of relapsed lymphoma. Lymph node biopsy showed reactive lymphadenopathy. Further evaluation found these lymph nodes to represent benign clonal lymphoid hyperplasia and not relapsed lymphoma. IL-2 receptor was markedly elevated at 2,735U/ml. Discussion: These cases demonstrate how lymphadenopathy may masquerade as malignancy. The lymphadenopathy is likely a result of immune dysregulation from CVID. IL-2 receptor, a biomarker for inflammation, may be used to monitor disease progression in these patients over time. 1 Shire, Cambridge, MA, 2 Shire, Bannockburn, IL Rationale: Treatment satisfaction (TS) is an important consideration for Ig treatment.

Methods: Twenty-five patients with biopsy-proven GLILD underwent whole exome sequencing to identify monogenic mutations, which were confirmed with Sanger sequencing. Response to immunosuppressive therapy was ascertained by chart review. Results: 8/25 patients were found to have mutations in genes known to cause a CVID-like disorder including TNFRSF1 (n = 4), CTLA4 (n = 2), KMT2D (n = 1) and XIAP (n = 1).

More severe mutations lead to mevalonic aciduria, resulting in mental retardation. We present a 17-year-old male with a history of short stature who initially presented at age two with knee swelling that progressed to chronic arthritis. His clinical course was notable for organomegaly, colitis, perioral ulcers, anemia, and elevated zinc levels and inflammatory markers. Fevers were never a prominent symptom. He was initially diagnosed with hyperzincemia with elevated calprotectin and trialed on multiple immunosuppressants, finally achieving improvement of the inflammation and anemia with anakinra. Methods: Whole exome sequencing was performed. Results: Sequencing demonstrated two mutations in the mevalonate kinase (MVK) gene: a c.118 C > T resulting in an R20Y substitution (inherited from his father) and a c.803 T > C resulting in an I268T substitution (inherited from his mother). Conclusions: We report a case of HIDS presenting as progressive arthritis without fevers, which is a nearly universal finding with HIDS.

Patients with CD40L deficiency are potentially highly predisposed to cryptococcal infection, and this interaction should be studied further. Isolating Cryptococcus from a male patient should raise suspicion of this disease. A subset of patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) develop granulomatous and lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLILD)-a restrictive lung disease for which no standardized treatment has been established. Combination chemotherapy with azathioprine and rituximab has been shown to improve symptoms, chest imaging and pulmonary function testing. We report three unique cases of successful treatment of GLILD with rituximab as a single agent. Case 1: A 25 year-old woman with CVID was on chronic prednisone for three years for treatment of her GLILD. She was started on rituximab single therapy, resulting in reduction of her prednisone use, and clinical improvement. Case 2: A 66 year-old woman with CVID and GLILD presented with decompensating respiratory symptoms, and worsening of both imaging and functional studies of the lung. Due to her history of lymphoma, azathioprine was not given. She was treated with rituximab therapy alone, with improvement in her clinical symptoms and lung function. Case 3: A 30 year-old woman presented with CVID and GLILD at the age of 20. She developed Mycobacterium terrae infection while on infliximab therapy for the GLILD. There was concern that use of azathioprine may cause a worsening of mycobacterial infection, thus she was started on rituximab alone for treatment of GLILD, with symptomatic improvement after four weeks of rituximab treatment. Rationale: Ig reduces infection rates in patients with PIDD by raising trough levels that are affected by Ig dose, interval, and bioavailability. A population PK model was developed based on weekly (QW) dosing data to simulate Ig exposure with CUVITRU, the new SCIG 20%, to compare 6 dosing intervals and to determine the dose adjustment factor. Methods: Data from 2 phase 2/3 studies in patients (\u22652 yrs) treated with IVIG 10% and SCIG 20% QW were used to characterize Ig population PK with nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. A model simulated Ig exposure for 1000 patients with SCIG 20% dosed daily (QD), every 2 days, every 3 days, twice weekly (BIW), QW, and every 2 weeks (Q2W).

Conventional NK cells are important innate effector lymphocytes that play a crucial role in early host defense against different pathogens as well as malignant transformation. By their cytotoxic ability and secretion of cytokines and chemokines, they build a bridge between innate immunity and adaptive immunity. However, their role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the frequency and function of NK cells in the peripheral blood and terminal ileum of CD patients. The frequency of NK cells among Lineage (-) CD45 (+) CD127 (-) PBMC was similar between CD patients and healthy donors while its frequency was significantly increased in the inflamed terminal ileum. Also, we noticed that the peripheral NK cells of CD patients had significantly downregulated degranulation ability compared to donors. This indicated compromised cytotoxicity. At the same time, intestinal NK cells were potent IFN-rproducers and their enrichment in the inflamed mucosa suggested their potential contribution to the tissue damage process of CD patients. Overall, the phenotype and function of NK cells among CD patients are organ-specific and contextdependent. Better understanding about the NK cell biology in CD patients definitely could offer potential therapeutic opportunities for better outcomes. Measurement of an individuals ability to respond to polysaccharide antigens is a crucial test to determine adaptive immunity. Currently the response to Pneumovax is utilized but with the success of Prevnar, measurement of the response to Pneumovax may be challenging. The aim of the study was to assess the response to Typhi Vi vaccination in both pediatric and adult control groups and patients with antibody deficiency. In the control groups, >95% of the individuals had pre vaccination concentrations <100 U/mL and there was significant increase in concentration post vaccination (p < 0.0001) with >94% achieving \u22653 fold increase in concentration post vaccination (FI). The response to Typhi Vi vaccination was significantly lower in both pediatric (p = 0.006) and adult (p = 0.002) antibody deficiency groups when compared to their age matched control groups. 11% and 55% of the pediatric and adult antibody deficiency groups did not obtain a response >3FI. When grouped into those individuals with hypogammaglobulinemia (HYPO) or common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), both groups had a significantly lower median FI than the control group. The data suggests that measurement of the response to Typhi Vi vaccination could represent a complementary assay for the diagnosis of antipolysaccharide production deficiency. hypothyroidism, and nephrotic syndrome (glomerulonephritis membranoproliferative type I).

A heterozygous mutation p.E1010A was found in PIK3CD in the C-lobe of kinase domain described in ExacBrowser with a very low frequency, 5/120,286 (0.004%). The clinical phenotype associated with PIK3CD patients included chronic diarrhea in 25%, associated with cryptosporidium at least in 3 patients and glomerulonephritis and hypothyroidism in a subset of patients.

A single center, retrospective chart review of 347 primary immunodeficiency patients between January 2012 -May 2016 was done. SAD was classified as mild, moderate, severe or memory (Orange et. al. JACI 2012) . Immunological phenotypes, numbers of infections and hospitalizations before and after therapy were recorded. T-test, Wilcoxin rank sum and Fisher exact tests were used to compare differences between groups. 31 patients met SAD criteria. 20 patients received IgGR, 11 were treated with prophylactic antibiotics or received no treatment (no-IgGR). Median rate of infections in IgGR was 1/year and 2/year in no-IgGR (P = 0.92). Median rate of hospitalizations was 36% in IgGR and 12% in no-IgGR (P = 0.35). 8/20 on IgGR had severe SAD. 50% of patients with severe SAD on IgGR had severe infections vs. 25% of the non-severe phenotype (p = 0.33). Immune phenotype analysis is underway. Although our data did not show a statistically significant difference in the rate of infections or hospitalizations in SAD patients, there was a trend toward fewer infections in IgGR group. Severe SAD was associated with higher hospitalization rates even after IgGR. Prospective studies comparing IgGR to no-IgGR in SAD are warranted. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most frequent symptomatic primary immunodeficiency. Objectives: (1) Identify the agents of viral rhinosinusitis (VRS) in nasal wash samples of CVID patients and controls; (2) define cytokines and chemokines and the antiviral immunity gene expression. Patients and controls were examined when presenting VRS. The evaluation was repeated when all individuals were asymptomatic. Results: 43 samples of 34 controls and 22 samples of 14 CVID patients were collected. CVID patients had more and longer infections requiring more antibiotics than controls. CXCL10, CXCL8 CCL2, CCL5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1 beta and TNF were increased in both groups during VRS. CVID patients showed increased gene expression than controls presenting VRS. Without VRS, gene expression in CVID patients was lower than controls. The greater variation of gene expression in CVID patients suggests an imbalance of immune response, local inflammation and consequent tissue damage.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1927, "end": 1953, "text": "(Orange et. al.

She has chronic oral candidiasis due to Candida albicans that repeatedly recurs after systemic antifungal therapy. She has history of neonatal sepsis, multiple Grampositive odontogenic and cervical abscesses, abdominal wall necrotizing fasciitis, and culture-negative osteomyelitis. Immunoglobulins were normal except for mildly elevated IgE. Lymphocyte populations were normal. Circulating Th17 cell numbers after PMA/ionomycin culture were normal. Conclusions: This is the first report to characterize LIFR deficiency (SWS) as a potential cause of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and bacterial infections. This phenotype suggests imbalances in JAK-STAT activation despite normal number of circulating Th17 cells. Patients with CVID may have lymphoid hyperplasia; some have risk of lymphoma. However, distinguishing between benign and malignant lymphoid proliferation in CVID may present challenges. We present 4 cases (3 males; 1 female) with previous diagnosis of CVID (age at diagnosis: 27-46 years) in which NH lymphoma was suspected (age at suspected diagnosis: 37-63 years) based upon #1 bone marrow CD5-l B cell predominance, no IgH clonal excess #2 nodal k B cell predominance, IgH clonal increase; #3 k B cell predominance and IgH clonal increase in a node #4) B-cell lymphocytosis, clonal B-cell population with excess kappa light chain. On this basis, 3 were diagnosed with Bcell marginal zone lymphoma and 1 with diffuse large Bcell lymphoma. Chemotherapy (rituxan, bendamustine; rituxan alone; cytoxan, prednisone and vincristine) was given to 3 patients and suggested for the fourth. Review of pathology did not validate lymphoma in these cases. As previously published, light chain excess/and or IgH rearrangements suggesting clonality may occur in lymphoid tissue in some CVID subjects, leading to requirements for experienced pathologists as well as cytogenetics, and additional morphologic markers. Background: Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (Waldmann's disease) is a rare disease caused by dilated intestinal lacteals resulting in lymph leakage into the small bowel and protein-losing enteropathy (PLE). Case report: We report on an 11 year-old girl diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) at 8 years due to r e c u r r e n t r e s p i r a t o r y b a c t e r i a l i n f e c t i o n s a n d hypogammaglobulinemia. She had low antibody responses to vaccines, low memory B cells and T cells. She had history of PLE as a toddler diagnosed as allergic enteropathy. She also had intermittent right lower leg edema. Monthly intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was started with improvement of edema. After 2 years, leg edema reappeared and hypoalbuminemia was detected. A labeled albumin scintigraphy showed marked enhancement in the small bowel demonstrating PLE. Ileoscopy showed leukoplakia suggestive of primary intestinal lymphangiectasia, which was confirmed through ileal biopsy. Follow-up was notable for fast clearance of monthly 800 mg/kg IVIG (trough IgG <300 mg/dL). A low-fat diet with supplementary medium-chain triglycerides was started with decrease in edema and increase in albumin and IgG levels. Conclusions: Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia shares immunological phenotype with CVID and may mimic this condition, particularly in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Objective: Autoimmune cytopenias (AIC) are common in children and the majority of cases self resolves or respond to first line therapy with steroid and high dose immunoglobulins. Patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) are prone to immune dysregulation and autoimmunity that may not respond to conventional treatment. To investigate the relationship between AIC and PID, we reviewed the natural history and treatment outcome of AIC in our tertiary care facility. Methods: In a single institution retrospective analysis, we reviewed the demographics, clinical and immunological phenotypes, and treatment of patients with AIC from 2013-2016. Results: We identified 165 patients with clinical and/or laboratory-confirmed AIC. Underlying PID was confirmed in 16 patients (10%). Mean age of onset of AIC did not differ between the groups with and without PID (6.7 vs 6.8 years, p = 0.93). AIC preceded the diagnosis of PID in a majority of cases (62.5%). Spectrum of PID associated with AIC was wide including T and/or B cell disorders. More patients with PID had multilineage cytopenia (9/16, 56% vs 9/149, 6.2%, p < 0.001) and required second-line therapy for AIC (9/13, 69.2%) than those without PID (21/85, 24.7%) (p = 0.001). Conclusions: Our data indicate a wide spectrum of PID may present with AIC as first sign of an underlying immune dysregulation and often require treatment with second-line therapy. Results are classified as normal, unsat, abnormal or critical abnormal. Flow cytometry is done for any abnormal result in a term infant and critical abnormal in a premature infant. Premature infants can have abnormal TREC values initially but repeat tests usually normalize. We report data demonstrating a trend for abnormal TREC results on second specimens despite previous normal TREC. Methods: Since June 1st, 65,214 infants have been screened for SCID. 54,593 were term (>2500g), 9560 were low birth weight (LBW), and 1061 were very low birth weight (VLBW) (1000g -2499g and <1000g respectively). Georgia is a one test state. We reviewed the total number of abnormal TREC NBS and the numbers with a prior normal TREC NBS. Results: There were 159 abnormal TREC NBS (0.24%). 46 infants had normal BW (0.08%), 56 had LBW (0.58%) and 57 were VLBW (5.37%). 55 infants had a previously normal NBS. LBW infants were most often affected (20/56). The median Cq for normal TREC was 30.75 for TREC and 22.9 for RNaseP. None of the infants with a previously normal NBS had a primary immune deficiency. Conclusions: Premature infants are more likely to have an abnormal subsequent NBS for SCID compared to term infants. Many of these infants are critically ill and require frequent blood transfusions which may result in a dilution of TREC in the DBS. Although ALPS diagnostic criteria are clearly established, differential diagnosis with other PIDs can be an issue if no mutation is found. A 12yo boy diagnosed with ALPS since he was 2years old was referred to us due to disease progres-sion. Although biochemical and clinical phenotype fully matched the diagnosis of ALPS (TAB), bone marrow showed wrinkled tissue paper features suggesting Gaucher Disease (GD), confirmed by \u03b2glucosidase dosage. Symptoms improved after enzyme replacement. Reticuloendothelial cells involvement in GDmay impair immune-system and show with ALPS phenotype. GD should be considered in ALPS diagnostic work-up. Reports about non-granulocytic cell lines in SCN and their family members are limited. The study included 17 children with SCN and 24 non-neutropenic family members. They were evaluated for CD95, CD95L, annexin on the L, PNL, Mo; cell cycle of L and PNL; L. subsets ; cell senescence of leukocytes by SA beta galactosidase; thrombocyte aggreg.; in vitro bleeding time by PFA-100; cell morph. by light, electron and fluorescent microscope. The HAX1, ELANE, G6PC3, CSF3R mutations were tested. Annexin on L, Mo and PNL of both patients and parents were significantly higher than the control. CD95 and CD95L displayed variable results. Leukocytes of 25% and 7.7% of patients and parents were positive for SA-b-gal. The cell cycle analysis showed G1 arrest and apoptosis in L of one patient and parents. Mutations, HAX1 (6); ELANE (2); G6PC3 (2) The NK and CD4 values were below the 25th percentile for age in 58.3%/ 50% of the patients and 84.6%/46.2% of the parents. Thrombocyte aggreg. were abnormal by 66.6% and 63.2%; dense granule number/thrombocyte was low by 53.8% and 28.5%; in vitro bleeding time was prolonged by 33.3% and 16.6%, respectively. Ultrastructure revealed that leukocytes and thrombocytes were dysmorphic, thrombocyte adhesion, aggregation, release were defective. Pluripotent stem cells are involved in SCN irrespective to the genetic defect and non-neutropenic family members are also affected.

These diseases are fatal, unless treated by allogeneic HSCT, where GvHD is one of the major complications. Recently there is an increased awareness on the role of the intestine in educating the immune system. We aim to investigate whether altered homeostasis of the intestinal tract may influence the disease phenotype and the clinical course by controlling cell fate determination. We recruited thirteen patients with congenital immune dysregulations and autoimmunity. Five of them underwent HSCT and were monitored over the treatment. Fecal microbiota composition at the patient's diagnosis and before and at different times after HSCT was analyzed for each patient by NGS. A normal and elevated biodiversity is present in patients with mild phenotypes and a depletion of microbial community and with prevalence of potential pathogenic bacteria is observed in patients with severe disease. Treatment with HSCT induces a modification of gut flora with a recover of a normal composition in patients with disease resolution and a disruption of biodiversity in subjects with no successful treatment. The work contributes to understand gut homeostasis and represents the first step in identifying new biomarkers to predict the onset and severity of immune dysregulation and possible new therapeutic approaches. An ALPS diagnosis is made if an individual has 2 required criteria and one primary accessory criterion, including a disease-causing mutation. We report here a family of 3 individuals with a mutation in FAS who were diagnosed by genetic testing, although the index case had nearly-normal laboratory. The index case is a 6 yo male who presented with a temporary purpura, edema, and joint pain, in the absence of fever, with normal hematologic studies, but with persistent splenomegaly. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis was found on skin biopsy, and HSP was suspected. His mother is a 32 yo female who underwent splenectomy at age 4 due to refractory immune thrombocytopenia. She has been healthy and has not maintained follow-up for the condition. The maternal uncle was born with heart block and hepatosplenomegly, and developed chronic active hepatitis and hypogammaglobulinemia with elevated IgM. Despite IVIG and intermittent steroid courses for cytopenias, he developed cardiomyopathy and expired. The index case had ALPS panel testing, which was positive only for minimally elevated TCR a/b DNTC of 70/mcL, not suggestive of ALPS. However, whole exome testing was positive for c.443 + 1G > A in FAS gene, which his mother also shared. These cases show that variation of phenotype and partial penetrance may delay diagnosis.

Heather, PhD 2 , Gabriel Wong, MD/PhD 3 and Mark Cobbold, MD/PhD 2 , Rationale: Growing evidence suggests global disruption of the adaptive immune response in CVID, with abnormalities in both the B and T cell compartments. We sought to further evaluate the role of the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in immune dysregulation and the pathogenesis of autoimmunity in subsets of CVID patients. Methods: We evaluated the TCR repertoire to investigate subsets of CVID patients (including CVID associated enteropathy (CAE)) to identify TCR clonotypes specific to each group. We used a published database of 587 healthy donors (HD) to evaluate the incidence and frequency of these clonotypes to determine their specificity to patients with CAE. Results: Several candidate TCR\u03b2 clonotypes were identified that appeared to be associated with CVID, and 34 specifically with CAE. Using the HD database, we found that there were several TCR clonotypes present at extremely low rates in this database (1 found in just 2 HDs and the remainder (33/34) found at very low median frequencies (median = 0, range 0-2.3E-06)). Conclusions: We identified distinct CVID specific clonotypes with relative specificity to CAE patients. This data supports the dysregulation of T cells within this CVID subset. We plan to use these clonotypes to identify paired \u03b1\u03b2 sequences to determine if there is an autoimmune T cell targeting identifiable antigens, which could be driving autoimmune manifestations in CVID. Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA BACKGROUND: Immunodeficiencies are associated with inflammatory bowel disease. The frequency of primary immunodeficiencies in an unselected cohort of patients with Very Early Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease (VEO-IBD) is not known nor is there a recognized screening approach. METHODS: A joint Gastroenterology-Immunology clinic was established. We enrolled 110 consecutive VEO IBD patients (with onset of IBD before 5 years of age). Whole exome sequencing, flow cytometry and pathology review was performed. RESULTS: Features that differed in the VEO-IBD clinic compared to later onset were higher rates of ostomies and colectomies, as well as higher levels of apoptosis, eosinophils and villous blunting. 18% had abnormal B cell maturation, 18% had T cell subset abnormalities. 15% had low NK cells. Three patients had confirmed mutations in PIDD genes (ZBTB24, XIAP, ITK) and all had abnormal lymphocytes on flow cytometry. Five more patients had candidate genes identified with confirmation pending and all have lymphocyte abnormalities. Three bone marrow transplants have been performed which have been curative and gene-targeted therapies have also been effective. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of children with monogenic immunodeficiencies can define appropriate treatment and bone marrow transplantation can be curative. Screening flow cytometry appears to have high sensitivity. A 10 year-old female patient presented with cervical lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, recurrent otitis media and sinusitis since 5y. At age of 7y, she developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia responsive to corticosteroid and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) but presented CMV and P jirovecii pneumonia during corticosteroid therapy. The chest CT showed ground-glass opacities, pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. At age of 9, a progressive decrease in IgG levels was observed and IVIG replacement was initiated. Radiologic follow up showed worsening of pulmonary findings demanding an open lung biopsy. Histology revealed interstitial infiltration of T and B lymphocytes. Infection and neoplasia were ruled out and GLILD was characterized. We initiated immunosuppression with azathioprine and rituximab (375mg/m 2 /week -4 weeks). Azathioprine was switched to mycophenolate sodium due to GI intolerance. Radiological and lung function improvement was noticed after 2 months of treatment. Genetic analysis showed a heterozygous mutation in the CTLA4 gene (c.436G > A:p.G146R). Targeted therapy was proposed with abatacept. CTLA4 deficiency led to an early GLILD manifestation with rapid progression. Rituximab and azathioprine/mycophenolate was effective while awaiting specific treatment. Rationale: Rituximab (RTX) is a mAb used in broad range of conditions. Despite recent reports of a subset of patients who develop prolonged, symptomatic hypogammaglobulinemia (HGG), many patients do not undergo immunologic evaluation prior to initiation of RTX. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patients who received RTX at Partners HealthCare. We evaluated the frequency of immunologic evaluation pre and post RTX, correct identification/documentation of HGG, and compared healthcare encounters for infections pre and post RTX. Results: Of the 5,891 patients who received RTX, 52.4% did not have Ig levels checked prior to initiation of RTX. Of those that had, 23.8% had HGG. Over 1/2 of patients with moderate to severe HGG and over 1/3 of those with mild HGG did not have the diagnosis of HGG coded in their chart. There was a statistically significant increase in infections after RTX in the overall population (p < 0.0001) and in the subset with cancer/ autoimmune conditions. Patients with a diagnosis of HGG had more infection related healthcare encounters (p < 0.0001). Patients treated with IgG replacement had fewer infection related healthcare encounters on average, and this was particularly notable for pneumonia and sepsis. Conclusions: Many patients are not being screened or properly identified as having HGG when initiating RTX and this may contribute to excess morbidity and mortality.

When comparing B cell subpopulations, memory and switched-memory B cells were both lower in CVID patients (24.5 vs 39.8% and 2.07 vs 9.96%, respectively). Autoimmunity (44.6 vs 21.6%), interstitial lung disease, granulomas, splenomegaly, lymphoid malignancies, and any noninfectious complications (65.3 vs 30.9%) were significantly more prevalent in CVID patients. Recurrent sinopulmonary infections could not differentiate the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Hypogammaglobulinemic patients with recurrent sinopulmonary infections who have normal B cell subpopulations and do not display noninfectious manifestations should be more accurately diagnosed with IgG deficiency instead of CVID. Introduction: Primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and select related disorders are caused by bi-allelic mutations in PRF1, encoding perforin, or UNC13D, STXBP2, STX11, RAB27a, LYST and AP3B1, encoding proteins involved in cytotoxic lymphocyte degranulation. Screening tests are used to quickly distinguish primary HLH, facilitating treatment. The chromium release natural killer cell (NK) function assay can screen for all genetic diseases, and is part of the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria, but combining flow cytometric tests to measure perforin expression and CD107a upregulation can also screen for all diseases. It is unknown which approach yields better diagnostic accuracy. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed test performance in 1604 patients referred to our clinical lab for HLH evaluation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "BACKGROUND"}, {"text": "For each test, we used ROC analysis to determine optimal diagnostic thresholds for detecting bi-allelic mutations, and calculated the diagnostic parameters.

The specificity of the NK function, perforin, and CD107a tests were 72%, 99.5%, and 73%. Conclusion: NK function is less sensitive for detecting primary HLH compared to perforin and CD107a tests. Perforin and CD107a testing could replace or augment NK cell function testing as one of the HLH diagnostic criteria. Conclusions: Gammaplex 10%, the first 10% IVIG with a 15min titration schedule, allows shorter infusion durations than a 5% IVIG product, with a similar tolerability profile. We present an 18yo male with lymphopenia, renal disease (FSGS), and neuropathy associated with novel compound heterozygous missense variants in SGPL1. SGPL1 encodes sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase (S1PL), which terminally cleaves S1P. Lymphocytes express S1P receptors, and S1P gradients are critical for trafficking. A larger cohort of patients demonstrated that a genetic deficiency of S1PL activity leads to a novel syndrome of lymphopenia, FSGS, neuropathy, and adrenal insufficiency (J Clin Invest, In Press). Our patient has a history pneumonias and gastroenteritis, with normal antibody responses to vaccination. He His lymphocytes had normal proliferation to mitogens relative to total lymphocytes or CD3 + cells. TREC copies relative to CD3 + T cell count was normal, suggesting the lack of peripheral homeostatic expansion and cellular dilution of thymic-derived T cells. CD45RA/RO was normal for age; however CD62L + naive T cells were decreased. These results are consistent with a defect in lymphocyte trafficking. Comprehensive phenotypic analysis utilizing mass cytometry (CyTOF) is ongoing. In summary, we provide the first description of lymphopenia and primary immunodeficiency associated with monogenic loss-of-function variants in SGPL1.

Background: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been used for Primary immunodeficient patients and no access to subcutaneous (SC) route was available in Brazil until recently. The choice of route is not a simple decision considering that SC administration is not approved for the public health system. Aim: We describe our reality in shifting the route of IV administration for 3 patients. Methods: 1)17-year old male patient with cerebral palsy due to kernicterus. Due to seizures, he receives phenitoin and a secondary hypogammaglobulinemia was diagnosed. Other drugs did not result in improvement of clinical manifestations and he was diagnosed after pneumonia and sepsis. Systemic adverse reactions and restricted venous access indicated SCIG. 2)6-month female child from consanguineous parents and SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) was diagnosed. SCIG was introduced after Bone Marrow Transplantation due to difficult venous access. 3)9 month-old girl, with hypogammaglobulinemia, anemia, recurrent fever and failute to thrive. She received IVIG, but SCIG was introduced due to the facilities of home care. Only one is supported by private insurance. The main difficulty was the absence of experience with the route and product.

Excellent family acceptance. by profoundly deficient HLA class \u00cf expression and lack of cellular and humoral immune responses to foreign antigens. The disease is also referred to bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) type \u00cf. Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome (BLS) represent the second commonest type of PIDs after SCID seen in Saudi population. The major aim was to assess common clinical, immunological manifestations and the underlying molecular genetic defects of MHC II deficiency in Saudi Arabia. Ninety three (93) patients with MHC II deficiency were identified at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research centre. Clinical, immunological data were reviewed. 50 were males and 43 females. The vast majority of these cases are for children of consanguineous parents. Median age at diagnosis was 16 months. Recurrent chest infections and chronic diarrhea were the most common clinical presentation. Absent of MHCII expression, low CD4 and poor lymphocytes response to antigens was the commonest immunological defects. Four common RFXANK gene mutations were identified in seventy nine patients in whom DNA was available for study. Results roots out from these studies will benefit patients and their families in terms of counseling, disease prevention and prenatal diagnosis. A 24-year old female was referred to the immunology clinic for recurrent infections. She had a history of immune thrombocytopenic purpura which was treated with IVIG and two doses of rituximab. Initial consultation revealed no detectable IgG, IgA, or IgM. The absolute B cell count was 30 cell/\u03bcL with less than 1% CD 27 + B cells. Absolute CD 4 and CD8 T cells were 380 cell/\u03bcL and 870 cell/\u03bcL respectively with the CD4:CD8 ratio of 0.4.

We assemble these variants into a blacklist and show that it can reduce the number of variations per exome after public database filtering by 74%, including 8,500 variants with no public frequency. We show an extremely low false-negative rate and that blacklists from other projects are similarly efficient in filtering NPV from their exomes. We demonstrate that our PID blacklist removes NPV from other exome cohorts, allowing this approach to be applied to small cohorts. We provide practical examples of blacklist usage in PIDs. Our blacklist reduced the number of candidates in a patient with IKZF1 haploinsufficiency from 2,741 to 466, an 83% reduction. When applied to analysis of genetic homogeneity, blacklists allowed identification of highly significant STAT1 enrichment in 209 patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (p = 3.46x10 -7 ). Thus, blacklists are a highly effective tool for removing NPV from patients' exomes, allowing streamlined discovery of disease-causing mutations in patients. We studied four patients from two families who had Hodgkin's l y m p h o m a , p e r s i s t e n t E B V v i r e m i a , a n d hypogammaglobulinemia. Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the CD70 gene were identified in both families by WES/ WGS. The homozygous frameshift mutation in one family led to absence of CD70 expression. The homozygous in-frame deletion in the other family resulted in a mutant protein that was not able to bind to its receptor CD27, rendering it biologically nonfunctional. In the patients, lymphocyte subsets were normal, except for reduced numbers of EBV-specific effector memory CD8 + T cells, 2B4+ or NKG2D+ expressing CD8 T cells, and memory B cells. T cell proliferation was normal when stimulated by PHA, PMA/ionomycin, or immobilized mAbs specific for CD2/CD3/CD28. However, T cell activation, when stimulated by autologous EBV-LCL, were impaired. Additionally, in vitro expanded EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells showed impaired cytotoxicity against autologous EBV-transformed B cells. Blocking CD70/CD27 interactions with an anti-CD70 antibody reduced T cell activation, but did not affect the cytotoxicity of normal EBV-specific CD8 + T cell clones against EBV peptidepulsed autologous EBV-LCL. Thus, autosomal recessive CD70 deficiency causes a new combined immunodeficiency mainly presenting as susceptibility to EBV-associated diseases, similar to what is seen in CD27 deficiency. Monogenic inborn errors of immunity, such as IRF7 deficiency, have been shown to result severe infectious diseases in otherwise healthy children. To examining the genetic epidemiology of life-threatening viral infections in children, over 500 children admitted to the intensive care unit with confirmed or suspected influenza infection or RSV were enrolled through the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigator's (PALISI) Network and targeted sequencing was performed for 69 genes that are either known antiviral innate immune genes or had strong experimental evidence for restriction of influenza virus replication. Preliminary analyses revealed couple loss-of-function mutations and some rare or novel missense variants with computational deleterious predictions. For example, we identified one patient with a homozygous stop-gain mutation in the MBL2 gene and no detectable mannose binding lectin protein in blood. Our study showed the potential that high throughput genetics screening approach could successfully identify inborn errors in immunity in patients with severe respiratory virus susceptibility. The precise role of KMT2D in terminal B cell differentiation, especially with regard to mucosal immunity, remains undefined. Methods: Utilizing the Kmt2d+/BetaGeo KS1 mouse model (mKS1), we performed baseline humoral phenotyping, and challenged mice with OVA-cholera toxin intranasal vaccination. Results: Compared to wild-type controls, mKS1 mice have significantly decreased serum IgA levels, increased IgM concentrations, and splenomegaly. Following vaccination, mKS1 mice had poor anti-OVA IgA production and reduced IgA-secreting cells in the bone marrow and spleen compared to controls. We present a Caucasian male patient with very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) who underwent autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) and developed relapse of severe refractory colitis leading to diagnosis of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) deficiency. The patient had onset of chronic diarrhea early in life. He was diagnosed with Crohn's disease at 5 years of age and was treatment-refractory with eventual steroid-dependence despite receipt of infliximab. By age 15 years, the patient was TPNdependent despite prior proctocolectomy and underwent auto-HSCT. Symptoms improved following transplant and his immunosuppression was weaned. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a constellation of heritable connective tissue disorders presenting with variable severity of symptoms including skin hyperextensibility, fragility, delayed wound healing with atrophic scars, easy bruising, joint hypermobility, muscle hypotonia, cardiovascular malformations (e.g., mitral valve prolapse), and arterial rupture. 1 The literature suggests that the prevalence of primary immunodeficiencies may be increased in patients diagnosed with connective tissue disorders. 2,3 Here, we describe three patients previously diagnosed with EDS that were found to have various immunodeficiencies. Case 1 is a 38 year old woman with EDS with hyperextensibility, arthralgias, Chiari malformation, increased skin elasticity, and easy bruising found to have transient IgG1 deficiency and low CH50 and C1r. Case 2 is a 49 year old woman with EDS with hypermobility with persistent idiopathic T cell lymphopenia and suspected mast cell disorder. Case 3 is a 25 year old woman with EDS consisting of hypermobility and tracheomalacia with IgA deficiency and recurrent sinopulmonary infections. More research is needed to determine the molecular and genetic underpinnings of immunodeficiency in EDS patients.

Currently, no pharmacological intervention is able to control disease progression in patients with SAVI. However, promising results have been obtained targeting the type I interferon receptor signaling pathway using Janus Kinase inhibitors. Combining peripheral blood interferon signature analysis and molecular sequencing, we identified two patients with mutation in TMEM173. Both patients presented with skin involvement and progressive severe interstitial lung disease with restrictive features by spirometry. Echocardiographic indirect signs of pulmonary hypertension were present in one case. On a compassionate basis, we started treatment with the JAK1/2 inhibitor, Ruxolitinib. We observed improvement of respiratory function in both patients with an increase in forced vital capacity, discontinuation of oxygen therapy and resolution of echocardiographic abnormalities. Clinical control of skin lesions was also obtained and both patients were able to taper steroids. We conclude that targeting interferon receptor signaling represents a promising therapeutic option for patients with SAVI syndrome and severe lung involvement. Objective: To identify and describe the myelosuppression effect of Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) used as a prophylactic treatment on a variety of primary immune deficiency (PID) patients. Method: A retrospective study of existing data for all PID patients who received TMP-SMX as a prophylaxis dose in Qatar. Data comprised of: patients' age, type of PID, CBC results (WBC, Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, RBC, Hemoglobin, and Platelet counts) at baseline, first seen, and at maximum myelosuppression was observed during the period of TMP-SMX administration and collected. Results: A total of 120 subject were reviewed, 43 were included in this study. Chronic granulomatous disease and Severe combined immunodeficiency represent about 60% of the studied group (35% & 25% respectively). Suppression in at least one cell line was observed in 95% of studied subjects however, the suppression below the normal value for age were seen on an average of 55% of the study population. The suppression was seen highest in absolute neutrophil count, then RBC followed by absolute lymphocyte count and lastly platelets (68.5%, 50%, 46.6%, and 35% of studied group, respectively). Conclusion: Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis was highly suspected to cause myelosuppression (especially neutrophil count) in PID patients. Future larger prospective study is required to confirm this association. Division of Allergy and Immunology, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL CVID epidemiology has been described almost exclusively at large referral centers and centralized databases such as the USIDNET. These data demonstrate the high morbidity of noninfectious CVID sequelae. To establish the frequency and severity of noninfectious sequelae at a large tertiary care center, we conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of patients with CVID diagnosed or treated at Partners HealthCare Network Hospitals in Boston, MA (including the Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women's Hospitals). Our cohort of 201 CVID patients was comparable to the USIDNET with regard to native immunoglobulin levels, B-cell immunophenotype, and noninfectious disease complication rates. Using unbiased clustering, we statistically differentiated the Partners cohort into noninfectious disease sequelae endotypes including atopic, lymphoproliferative, and auto-antibody-mediated. Furthermore, we observed discrete immunophenotypes (e.g. total and subclass immunoglobulin levels, B-/T-cell subsets, and B-/T-cell function) that were endotype-specific. These data demonstrate the power of the USIDNET in validating smaller cohort analyses and of unbiased statistical approaches in elucidate novel or unexpected correlations between immunophenoptype and divergent clinical outcomes, which is of particular importance in the heterogenous CVID population. Background: Mutations in NCF1 result in autosomal recessive p47 phox CGD, with impaired reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Identification of the specific genetic defect is complicated by two highly conserved (>98%) pseudogenes. The NCF1 gene has a GTGT at the start of exon 2 while the pseudogenes (NCF1B and NCF1C) delete one GT (\u0394GT). Unequal recombination may lead to replacement of the NCF1 GTGT with pseudogene \u0394GT. Sequence identity between the wild type gene and pseudogenes precludes standard Sanger sequencing. Method: ddPCR was used to differentiate the number of GTGT alleles and \u0394GT alleles at the NCF1 locus in each gDNA sample. Result: The ratio of GTGT alleles to total NCF1 alleles (2:6, 1:6, or 0:6) was used to assort DNA into normal subjects, CGD carriers, and CGD patients, respectively. Over 85% of p47 phox CGD patients (102/119) lacked the GTGT allele. Unexpectedly, analysis of normal subjects revealed that a significant proportion (14%) exhibited >2 GTGT alleles without increased p47 phox protein expression or the ROS production. Conclusion: ddPCR is effective identifying patients and carriers with p47 phox CGD. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a primary immunodeficiency of phagocyte oxidative metabolism resulting in susceptibility to certain bacterial and fungal infections. Gastrointestinal manifestations in CGD have prevalence between 30-40%.

All patients had failed therapy with at least prednisone and azathioprine and were steroid dependent. All were on prophylactic antibiotics and antifungals. Results: All patients had improvement in symptoms; none were able to completely taper off steroids. All experienced recrudescence of symptoms. One patient on hemodialysis developed papilledema and sagittal sinus thrombosis after 8 doses; vedolizumab was stopped. One patient developed pneumonia after 2 doses, and inguinal adenopathy after 5 doses; drug was continued. Conclusions: Overall only one patient discontinued the drug secondary to thrombosis. Vedolizumab has promising activity in CGD related colitis, however it remains a bridge to more definitive therapy such as hematopoietic transplantation. Program for Cell and Gene Therapy and Center for Immunity and Immunotherapies, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA Background: Studies suggested that soluble factors in plasma from patients with active (aBD) and inactive Beh\u00e7et's disease (iBD) stimulate neutrophil function. We have identified soluble CD40 Ligand (sCD40L) as one of these factors. Methods: Patient groups: aBD (n = 30), iBD (31), healthy controls (HC; 30). sCD40L plasma level was measured by Luminex. The effect of pooled plasma from each group on neutrophil NET release was evaluated in the presence or absence of sCD40L blockade by recombinant CD40 (rhCD40-muIg). NET formation was quantified on coverslip-plated neutrophils. Results: sCD40L plasma levels were significantly higher in iBD (median/range x10 3 = 17.2/2.4-19.3) and aBD (18.3/0.4-19.9) compared to HC (0.5/0.3-26.7; p < 0.001). NET formation was constitutively increased in BD compared to HC and was increased by aBD plasma. sCD40L blockade decreased NET formation in all groups, especially in neutrophils of BD patients (Table) . Conclusion: Plasma from BD patients increase NET formation. Increased concentration of sCD40L may be associated with neutrophil hyperactivity in BD. The prevalence of hypogammaglobulinemia in this cohort appears to be higher than the published data.

Increasing diagnostic complexity can result in complications and worse prognosis. AIM: to develop a discriminant model for PID dx, based on demographic, clinical and lab attributes from patients evaluated for recurrent infections and immune problems. METHODS: In MedSys we identified patients whose diagnosis included the term immunodeficiency. Of the resulting list we excluded those without confirmed diagnosis, clinical history, blood count or serum immunolgobulins. A database was built of patients with confirmed or ruled-out PID. In half the dataset, a linear discriminant model was developed through the backward stepwise method using JMP11. The model was then cross-validated in the rest of the cases. RESULTS: Of 368 identified patients, 233 were included, 45 without PID. In the training dataset the model was built of 10 variables (neutropenia, lymphopenia, low/high IgG, urinary/ mucocutaneous infection, lymphadenitis, encapsulated bacteria, no isolate, and current age); when applied to the validation set and the whole dataset, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity remained around 80%. DISCUSSION: Performance is encouraging. Identified attributes might serve as red flags in a detection system to extract PID patients. Cytopenia and leukemia may occur.

Background: At now, data on antibiotic prophylaxis in primary antibody deficiency patients are uncertain. We are studying the role of azithromycin on primary antibody deficiency patients. Methods: We are conducting a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled-double-blind trial on 89 patients with COPD and exacerbations. The aim of the study is evaluating efficacy and safety of azithomycin low-dose (250 mg 3 consecutive days a week) for 24 months vs placebo. In patients under azythomycin we expect a decrease of COPD exacerbations (reduction of dyspnea, cough, sputum), no use of additional antibiotics, an increase of respiratory volumes, an improvement of the Health Related Quality of Life measures. Results: The study started on June 2014 and will last 30 months (therapy: 24 months, follow-up: 6 months).

Conclusion: To our knowledge our study is the first one on antibiotic prophylaxis in primary antibody deficiencies patients. Autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) is a multisystem disorder caused by mutations in STAT3 gene and presents with recurrent respiratory and cutaneous infections. We report the case of an adult female who was referred due to recurrent skin infections since childhood. She also had asymmetric facies, scoliosis, high serum IgE (>2000 IU/mL), eosinophilia and bronchiectasis and was diagnosed as AD-HIES according to the NIH clinical scoring system. The proband reported six family members with the same phenotype and two of them were also referred for evaluation (1 daughter and 1 son), both fulfilling diagnostic criteria for AD-HIES. Long-term prophylaxis with azithromycin (500 mg p.o., twice a week) was started in June/2011, in association with topical skin antiseptics. Physical examination, routine laboratory tests and assessment of macrolide toxicity were performed at scheduled outpatient visits (every 3-6 months). All three patients tolerated very well the proposed protocol and had no serious infection during follow-up period (57 months). Self-reported improvement of quality of life by the patients was particularly noteworthy. He developed severe chronic anemia with iron deficiency, unresponsive to intensive iron replacement. IgG levels were persistently low, despite adequate IVIg therapy. Celiac disease or relevant gastrointestinal bleeding were ruled out. Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy showed diffuse lymphangiectasias. Histological examination of intestinal biopsies revealed numerous red blood cells within dilated mucosal lymphatic vessels. Octreotide (200 mcg/day, SC) and weekly SCIg infusions (10g/wk.) were started. Six weeks after treatment a marked improvement in anemia and body iron stores was observed, with serum IgG levels > 900 mg/dL.The patient had mild facial dysmorphisms and pectus excavatum. Noonan syndrome type 8 was diagnosed by whole exome sequencing (WES) that showed a mutation in RIT1 gene, predicted to be deleterious (Chr1:155.874.287; c.295T > G;p.Phe99Val). Noonan syndrome type 8 has been associated with mutations affecting genes involved in p38-MAPK pathway but without hypogammaglobulinemia or significant enteric protein loss. This report emphasizes the importance of recognizing unusual clinical findings associated with hypogammaglobulinemia as well as the role of WES for diagnosis of new immunodeficiency phenotypes. Here we present a case of multiple T inkin brain abscesses successfully treated with antifungals. Methods: Gomori methamine silver, periodic acid Schiff stains, brain heart infusion and sabouraud dextrose agar cultures were used. Results: 21 y old male with CGD (gp91phox) presented with headache and became unresponsive. CT Scan showed multiple right temporal lobe ring-enhancing lesions, cerebral edema, and i m p e n d i n g h e r n i a t i o n . U r g e n t d e c o m p r e s s i v e hemicraniectomy was done. Neurological status improved; he was extubated next day with left pronator drift and minor arm weakness. Cultures grew T inkin sensitive to Liposomal Amphotericin-B (L-Ampho-B) and Voriconazole. Complete resection carried a high chance of visual field deficit, which was an unacceptable risk to our patient. He was treated with L-Ampho-B and Voriconazole. 6 weeks later, MRI showed significant decrease in the abscesses, so he continued on Voriconazole alone, then switched to Posaconazole for better therapeutic levels. Most recent MRI showed no enhancement indicating complete resolution of the infection. Conclusion: Broad spectrum antifungal therapy alone can be considered when surgical resection carries a high morbidity risk.

Laboratory tests revealed slightly low levels of IgM 76,8 and normal serum levels of IgG 988 mg/dL, IgA 219,2 mg/dL, IgE 332 UI/mL, CD3 + 2692 cel/mm3, CD4 + 1565 cel/mm3, CD8 + 943 cel/mm3, CD19 + 506 cel/mm3, CD16 + /56 + 689 cel/mm3 and Howell-Jolly bodies were determined in peripheral blood smear. The patient received immunization for encapsulated bacteria. Due to infections, antibiotic prophylaxis was started, with improvement of infections. IS is related to homozygous mutation in the GDF1 gene. We decided to investigate the patient by the SNP-array. The result revealed duplication of approximately 4.3Mb, extending from 16q24. Monogenic causes for severe manifestations of common allergic disease shed light on the pathogenesis of atopy, although severe infectious and other syndromic phenotypes often accompany such diseases. We performed next-generation sequencing on a cohort of patients with severe atopic dermatitis regardless of comorbidities, but with evidence of familial inheritance. We found 8 individuals from 4 families harboring distinct, novel heterozygous mutations in CARD11, a lymphocyte scaffolding protein involved in antigen receptor (AgR) signaling to NF-kB and mTOR. Significant infections beyond the skin were documented in some, but not all of these patients. In contrast to known immunologic diseases associated with CARD11, these atopy-associated CARD11 mutations led to dominant interfering, hypomorphic activity upon AgR stimulation in transfected T cell lines. Primary patient T cells also showed impaired AgR-induced activation of NF-kB and mTORC1, which is critical for promoting Th1 and preventing Th2 responses. Defective mTORC1 signaling and IFN-gamma production was partially rescued by supplementing with excess glutamine, which requires CARD11 for import into T cells. Our findings indicate single hypomorphic mutations in CARD11 can cause potentially correctable cellular defects that lead to severe atopic disease sometimes in the absence of other syndromic features.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "5335: 16q24 DUPLICATION AND IVEMARK SYNDROME: A NOVEL GENOMIC CAUSE?"}, {"text": "Our clinical laboratory designed a comprehensive SCID panel as well as two B+ and B-subpanels which include genes from the comprehensive panel.

Methods: Retrospective chart review. Genetic testing was performed by next generation sequencing. Results: A healthy 30-month old male developed relapsing multilineal autoimmune cytopenia with 1.5-2% TCR alpha beta CD4-CD8-T cells and hepatosplenomegaly concerning for ALPS-like disease that required escalation of therapy from steroid to rituximab to mycophenylate mofetil and sirolimus. Patient's condition was complicated by interstitial pneumonia and infections with H1N1 and CMV. Patient developed macrophage activation syndrome; primary HLH was excluded. At 62 months, he underwent alpha beta T cell depleted haploidentical stem cell transplant and is doing well two years post-transplant. A hypomorphic homozygous RAG1 mutation (R507G) was found via next generation sequencing.

Background: CGD occurs as a result of a defect in any one of 5 phox subunits of NOX2. As a results phagocyte oxidative metabolism is impaired as measured by a dihydrorhodamine (DHR) assay. Rarely severe G6PD deficiency can result in an abnormal DHR leading clinicians to believe the patient has a genetic mutation in NOX2. Method: An 8-year-old boy was referred for CGD evaluation in the setting of recurrent pulmonary infections, failure to thrive, anemia, jaundice and an abnormal DHR. The DHR was more characteristic of autosomal recessive CGD; however the patient's mother appeared to have two populations of cells indicative of an X-linked carrier.

Primary immunodeficiency disorders (PID) are among \"rare\" or orphan diseases with prevalences between 1: 25,000 to 1: 50,000. It is wrongly thought that PID are childhood pathologies contributing to the fact that Internal medicine physicians are not familiar with these conditions. Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most common PID in adulthood with its highest peak in the second and third decades of life. The Immunology clinic at the Hospital Universitario del Valle in Cali, Colombia has diagnosed during 12 months of operation 5 adults who meet the diagnostic criteria for CVID (PAGID/ESID 1999) . These are 2 women and 3 men aged between 20 and 41 years, in whom other causes of hypogammaglobulinemia were ruled out and have a marked decrease (<2DS for healthy adults) of IgG, IgA and/or IgM in serum, in addition showed poor response to protein vaccines (HBsAg/Tetanus) as well as polysaccharides (Pneumovax). As has been reported in the literature all cases present increased susceptibility to bacterial infections and pulmonary complications. The 2 women present autoimmune cytopenias. A higher index of suspicion in PID allows earlier diagnosis, improvement in quality of life and prognosis. The creation of the clinical immunology clinic in the city of Cali is an effort to improve the diagnosis of PID in both adults and children. The volume and diversity of large-scale biological data available in the public domain continues to grow. This data has the potential to be reused to answer questions beyond those envisioned when the data was generated; however, few immunologists have sufficient bioinformatics expertise to do so. We used OMiCC, a free online platform that enables programming-free meta-analysis of public gene expression data and facilitates \"crowdsharing\" the work of annotating and constructing data compendia. We organized an \"OMiCC Jamboree\" to evaluate if biologists without bioinformatics training could use OMiCC to identify and annotate public gene expression datasets and design proper disease versus control comparisons for meta-analysis. Twenty-nine volunteer NIH biologists gathered to search and annotate public microarray data of human autoimmune conditions and the corresponding mouse models. Meta-analyses across studies explored 1) gene expression signatures for each disease, 2) pan-disease signatures, and 3) cross-species signatures. A large number of differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways were identified for each disease, with substantial overlap among diseases both within and between species, including pan-disease and pan-species signatures such as those associated with interferon. Supported by the Intramural Research Programs of NIAID and CIT, NIH. Several studies have shown that subcutaneous Immunoglobulin (SCIG) is as good as Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) preventing infections in PID. SCIG has been proposed as an alternative as efficient as IVIG in the immunomodulatory treatment (IT) of many neurological diseases and other diseases. Aim: Follow up of 48 patients (p) with SCIG treatment during 6 years. Material: Two Groups (G), G1:41p with PID with IG replacement treatment, G2: 7p with IT. The product was administered at 1 or multiple injection sites by push, in each site a maximum of 20 ml in children and 35 ml in adults. Results: G1: The mean dose was 133mg/kg/w.G2:Dose was 300 mg/ Kg/w. G1: The mean serum IgG level was 1205 mg/dl. Levels were better and stable. Efficacy: Among the G1 p, the annual rate of infection was 1,2 p/year. 1 XLA suffered an Enterovirus Encephalitis and 1 CVID presented Pseudomona aureus Sinusitis. G2: All patients presented remission. Tolerance: 50% presented mild episodes related with the injection site and only one p presented 2 moderate adverse reactions Conclusion: SCIG administration by push was generally well tolerated with no systemic or clinically significant adverse reactions and is an effective alternative to IVIG. Stable serum IgG steady-state levels are crucial in order to provide optimal protection against infections and therapeutic Immunomodulatory activity. Background: APECED is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by chronic candidiasis and autoimmune diseases due to mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene.

Results: sCD40L and plasma from BD, but not from CD40Ldeficient patients, stimulated O 2 production (Table) . Similar results were observed for H 2 O 2 production. Mac-1 expression was constitutively increased in BD neutrophils. PBMC and CD4+ T cells from BD showed higher CD40L expression.

Cutis laxa (CL) is a rare connective tissue disorder with skin laxity and incompletely characterized systemic manifestations. Both acquired and inherited forms of CL exist. Inherited CL includes autosomal dominant CL (ADCL), multiple types of autosomal recessive CL (ARCL) and X-linked CL (XLCL). Previously we reported EBV-associated smooth muscle tumors in a child with CL and NK cell deficiency. Later, whole exome sequencing of this individual revealed a homozygous mutation in the gene ATP6V0A2, the causative gene defect in ARCL type 2A (ARCL2A). Here we report NK cell defects in an expanded cohort of ARCL2A patients and the consequences of ATP6V0A2 silencing in the NK cell line NK92. As described in our original patient, ARCL2A patients lacked NK-cell mediated cytotoxicity and had a decrease in NK cell frequencies and effector molecules. As a disease control, ADCL patients carrying ELN mutations did not show this phenotype. Silencing of ATP6V0A2 in the NK92 cell line led to a recapitulation of the cohort NK cell phenotype with a decrease in natural cytotoxicity related to reduced lysosomal acidification and perforin processing. Taken together these data suggest ATP6V0A2 mutations result in a decrease of perforin, leading to impaired NK cell mediated cytotoxicity. These findings help provide insight into both NK cell cellular biology and the complex clinical manifestations of CL.

Usual features include combined immune deficiency, recurrent infections, and ectodermal dysplasia. We report a female with recurrent infections, hyper IgM, and no ectodermal dysplasia who was found to have a heterozygous IkBa mutation. METHODS: Immunophenotyping, functional flow cytometry, and gene sequencing were done. RESULTS: The patient presented in infancy with E. coli bacteremia and numerous respiratory and gastrointestinal viral infections. She had no ectodermal dysplasia. Immune evaluation at 5 months found leukocytosis (43,000 cells/uL), elevated IgM (425 mg/dL) and normal IgG (237 mg/dL). Immunophenotyping showed expanded na\u00efve T cells with normal proliferation to PHA, but no response to CD3 stimulation. Vaccine responses were poor. Sequencing identified a previously characterized heterozygous IkBa mutation (p.S32I), which causes a phosphorylation defect that prevents ubiquitin mediated degradation. She has been treated with IgG replacement and antimicrobial prophylaxis, but not BMT. CONCLUSIONS: Hyper IgM and variable ectodermal dysplasia are well described in NEMO deficiency but not in AD-EDA-ID. This case expands the spectrum of findings reported in AD-EDA-ID to include hyper-IgM and lack of ectodermal dysplasia.

At our day 50 endpoint, GFP + FOXP3 hi T cells were present in spleen, liver, lung, peripheral blood and bone marrow. Compared with Teff cells, long-term engrafted eTreg made IL-10 and IL-4 but lacked IFN\u03b3 and IL-2. Our gene editing thus allowed us to override endogenous silencing of FOXP3 to enforce stable FOXP3 expression in T cells. For future clinical use, we have successfully generated antigen specific eTregs with the goal of producing stable, functionally active antigen-specific eTregs for treating candidate autoimmunities. There is not a consensus about clinical and immunological abnormalities in patients with Selective IgA Deficiency (SIgAD). Also, no genetic defect(s) related with SIgAD have been reported.

Results: The de novo mutations in LYN were detected by NGS and lead to p.Y508* (pt1) and to p.Y508F that was studied in the Lyn up/up mice (pt2). Pt.1 presented with hydrops fetalis and neonatal onset of skin neutrophilic vasculitis, hepatosplenomegaly, testicular pain, increased transaminases and C-reactive protein (CRP), thrombocytopenia, anemia and detectable autoantibodies. Post-splenectomy, he developed leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. Liver biopsy showed bridging fibrosis. Clinical response to prednisone and IVIG was partial. B lymphocytes showed constitutive phosphorylation of Lyn and downstream kinases. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib normalized Lyn phosphorylation in pt. B cells and was initiated with significant clinical and laboratory response. Pt.2 presented with a neonatal-onset purpuric skin rash, abdominal and testicular pain, headaches, arthralgias, oral ulcers and increased CRP. Partial response to steroids and colchicine and significant clinical response to etanercept were observed. Conclusion: Activating mutations in Lyn kinase cause a novel immunedysregulatory syndrome of neonatal-onset of neutrophilic vasculitis and systemic inflammation. Introduction: Limited reports of liver disease in DOCK8 deficiency identify cholangitis and cryptosporidia infection. We evaluated liver function tests (LFT), cryptosporidia in stool, liver imaging and liver biopsies in our DOCK8 deficient cohort. Methods: Retrospective review of LFT's, liver imaging/ biopsies, cryptosporidia studies and outcome of 46 DOCK8 deficient patients. We compared cryptosporidia PCR and staining methods when available. Results: We reviewed the records of 46 DOCK8 deficient patients. 11 of 41 patients with liver imaging had abnormalities, with ductal dilation most frequent, and was associated with LFTs abnormalities. Four biopsies showed cholestatic liver disease, including ductopenia. Cryptosporidia was identified (stain or PCR) for 4/9 patients with abnormal imaging and abnormal LFTs, and was not found in any with normal LFT's and liver imaging. Two patients were PCR positive for cryptosporidia without diarrhea and with negative stains for cryptosporidia. Two patients with cryptosporidia and significant liver pathology died post-BMT from liver failure, one after liver transplant pre-BMT. Conclusions: LFT abnormalities and bile duct abnormalities are common in DOCK8 deficiency. Cryptosporidia infection likely plays a role in the pathogenesis of these abnormalities and should be increasingly recognized with molecular techniques of detection. Immunoglobulins at time of MPGN diagnosis -IgG 4.6g/L, IgA 6.8g/L, IgM 0.26g/L. In 2014 he was found to have IgG <1.7g/L, IgA 2.5g/L, IgM 0.16g/L, absent isohaemagglutinins and absent B cells (CD19 < 1%). Genetic analysis confirmed a missense mutation in BTK (c.1100c > A, p.A367E, SH2 domain) consistent with XLA. The patient was commenced on SCIG and continuous oral antibiotics and has a current steady state IgG of 5.5g/L. He has persistent proteinuria, exacerbated by intercurrent chest infections. His bronchiectasis symptoms have improved. This is a rare and interesting case of immune complex mediated disease in XLA, illustrating the potential for residual B cell function. It highlights the interplay between humoral immune deficiency and autoimmunity, and the difficulty in managing such patients. MIRAGE (myelodysplasia, infection, restriction of growth, adrenal hypoplasia, genital phenotypes, and enteropathy) is a newly described syndrome in patients with heterozygous mutations of SAMD9. Immunodeficiency in these patients has not been well described. We report a 15 month old male with a history of failure to thrive, adrenal insufficiency and severe respiratory viral infections requiring intubation two times in the pediatric intensive care unit. Sequencing of SAMD9 showed a heterozygous missense mutation. SAMD9 has been described to play a role in the innate immune response and defense against viral pathogens. Exome sequencing also showed a variant of unknown significance in WAS, but WASp protein expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes was normal. Bone marrow evaluation revealed myelodysplasia with the cytogenetic finding of monosomy 7. His immune evaluation was significant for hypogammaglobinemia (IgG: 190 mg/dL), B-lymphopenia (101/mm 3 ), CD4 T-cell lymphopenia (625/mm 3 ) with an inverted CD4:CD8 ratio of 0.7. Phenotyping showed highly immature CD4 and CD8 T-cell lineages and absent immature CD19 B cells with significant B-lymphopenia. IVIG was started for hypogammaglobinemia.

At presentation refractory warts and disseminated mollusca were visible. The patient also had a history of bacterial infections (pneumonia at 18 months, recurrent otitis media) and intractable diarrhea. Blood analysis showed intermittent neutro-and monocytopenia and microcytic anemia. IgG2, IgA and IgM and switched memory B cells were low. DOCK8 expression was normal. No mutations in GATA2 and CXCR4 were detected. At age 6 he presented with knee pain traced down to the m. gastrocnemius and corresponding on MRI to vasculitis with myositis. This led to the suspicion of DADA2, supported by low plasma DADA2 activity. CECR1 sequencing is pending. In depth immunologic analysis will be presented.

We describe a patient followed for 15 years who displays a wide range of antibody deficits who ultimately met the criteria for CVID.Methods: Chart review of clinical symptoms, immune system labs, B cell counts, and pulmonary function testing were analyzed. Summary of Results: The patient presented at the age of 38 with recurrent sinusitis and otitis media with low IgG1 and IgG2. She responded to pneumococcal vaccination and was treated with prophylactic antibiotics. At sixmonth, her IgG1 normalized, but her IgG2 remained depressed. Over time, she developed more frequent and severe episodes of sinusitis along with declining IgG levels. Her IgA fell below normal 3 years later. Her total IgG fell below 500 mg/dl, and she demonstrated a reduction in FEV1 and FEF 25%-75% at age 45. She was started on gammaglobulin and responded with normalization of pulmonary function. Throughout her clinical course, her IgG, IgA and B cell counts varied remarkably. Conclusions: The progression to and course of CVID can be quite variable.

Methods: We report discordant long-term immune reconstitution following HSCT in 3 siblings with XLP, two of whom received matched sibling transplants from a sister who is a disease carrier, while the other received a matched unrelated transplant. Results: At 7 years post reduced intensity transplant, all had 100% donor chimerism, none developed severe GVHD, and all were off immunosuppression. The two with the carrier donor have normal SAP expression in around 60% of T cells. However, they have poor B cell reconstitution and inability to discontinue immunoglobulin replacement, along with T-cell lymphopenia and poor T cell proliferative responses to mitogens and antigens. This is in marked contrast to that of the other sibling who received a matched unrelated HSCT. He has excellent B and T-cell immune reconstitution, and is currently off immunoglobulin replacement. The asymptomatic female sibling donor has normal lymphocytes and immunoglobulins, with non-skewed bimodal SAP expression. Conclusions: HSCT from female XLP carriers could lead to poor immune reconstitution. Further studies are warranted to understand the role of the SAP-deficient donor immune fraction in long-term immune reconstitution.

Vander Lugt, MD 3 and Kelly J. Walkovich, MD 3 , Background: High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is standard treatment for Kawasaki disease (KD).Case: A 16-year-old male presented with syncope, aseptic meningitis and immune hemolysis (IH) requiring packed red blood cell transfusion five days after receiving IVIG. He was diagnosed with atypical Kawasaki disease (KD) based on 10-day history of fever associated with bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, bilateral conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue, high CRP and low albumin. He received high dose IVIG (Gamunex); two days later he developed rash, headache, vomiting, and syncope. His hemoglobin dropped from 13.9 to 5.7 g/dL with elevated reticulocyte count, decreased haptoglobin and IgG + direct antiglobulin test.Conclusion: IH is a rare underreported complication of IVIG administration for KD with incidence of 0.36% to 16%. Among 24 reported cases of IVIG-related IH in children, 61% were treated for KD. Risk factors include: non-O blood group, high dose IVIG (>2g/kg) and underlying immune dysregulation. Additionally, newer, isosmolar liquid products have been accused of increased incidence of IVIG-related hemolysis. Usage of low titer product as well as a high index of suspicion for IH with monitoring of hemoglobin and clinical status, especially after high dose IVIG, appear to be key elements to mitigate the risk of significant hemolysis.5392: CEREBELLAR DEGENERATION IN A PATIENT WITH IPEX SYNDROME Ariane Soldatos, MD, MPH 1 , Suk See DeRavin, MD, PhD 2 , Mark Gorman, MD 3 , Bibiana Bielekova, MD 1 , Steven Jacobson, PhD 1 , Emily C.

In 2013, we showed that heterozygous coding mutations in ribosomal protein SA (RPSA) underlie autosomal dominant ICA in 8 kindreds. This was surprising as mutations in 13 other human ribosomal proteins, such as RPS19, cause Diamond Blackfan Anemia. None of these ribosomopathy patients have been reported with asplenia. Since then, our cohort has doubled in size. Twenty out of the 46 ICA kindreds now included were found to carry a RPSA mutation. We identified mutations in the coding and noncoding region of the gene. We performed a thorough clinical evaluation of patients with ICA and assessed penetrance at the splenic and infectious level. Strikingly, 6 different RPSA mutations were incompletely penetrant at both levels. Asplenic adults frequently develop auto-immunity. We additionally carried out molecular experiments to differentiate the functional and structural impact of the observed coding and non-coding mutations on RPSA. We will present data showing human ribosomal mutations can be hypomorphic in ICA, as has been previously described for SBDS in Schwachman-Diamond Syndrome. RPSA mutations thus consistently underlie around half of ICA cases.

Conditioning regimens were myeloablative (MA) (6), modified MA (2) and reduced intensity (2). Donors were matched sibling (1), haploidentical sib (1), matched unrelated (MUD) (7) and mismatched unrelated (1). 2 MUD HSCT patients previously underwent HSCT from an affected sib resulting in engraftment failure. All are alive and well (incl. no new vascular events). Follow-up ranges from 8m to 9y. Plasma ADA2 enzyme activity normalized in those tested (7/9), as early as D + 14 (myeloid engraftment) along with a drop in inflammatory cytokines as evident from prospective monitoring in 1 patient. Post-HSCT auto-immunity (cytopenia) was reported in 4, graft versus host disease grade 2 in 1, grade 1 in 2/10 patients. In conclusion: HSCT is a safe and effective treatment for DADA2. University of South Florida, Tampa, FL Background: Immunodysregulation in CGD leads to autoimmunity, hyperinflammation, and granuloma formation. Cardiovascular and kidney disease occur more commonly in p47phox deficiency. Methods: 24 specimens from 7 patients with CGD (3 XL, 3 p47 phox , 1 p22 phox ), 4 XL carriers, and 4 healthy controls (HCs) were evaluated. Clinical assays for autoimmunity, hypercoagulable risk and the Clot Formation and Lysis (CloFAL) spectrophotometric time series assay were performed. Results: Conventional thrombophilia testing results were mostly negative/normal; APAs were present in 2 out of 7 with CGD. Using the CLoFAL assay, CGD patients were hypercoagulable (Coagulation Index (CI) 5.9 \u00b1 1.8) compared to HCs (CI 3.6 \u00b1 1, p 0.01). Hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis worsened when patients were acutely ill (CI 4.7 \u00b1 0.6 vs 7.4 \u00b1 1.6, p 0.0043) (Fibrinolytic Index (FI2) 10.6 \u00b1 1.6 vs 7.8 \u00b1 0.9, P 0.0081) and resolved post HSCT (CI 5.9 \u00b1 1.8 vs 3.2 \u00b1 1.6, p 0.02) (FI2 9.3 \u00b1 1.9 vs 12.8 \u00b1 2.4; p 0.012). No defect was present in XL carriers. Conclusions: CGD patients have hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis that is more severe during acute illness and corrects after HSCT. The mechanism does not appear to be autoimmune or clotting factor mediated but may stem from endothelial damage propagated by hyperinflammation.

Immunodeficiency can occur in many congenital syndromes; pattern recognition of these features is imperative to establishing the correct diagnosis. Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is a rare primary immune disorder caused by defects in the lymphocyte cytolytic pathway. FHL type 5 (FHL5) is due to syntaxin binding protein 2 (STXBP2) gene mutations. We report two male siblings with FHL5. The first boy, 10 years old, was diagnosed at 3 months with his first activation. He suffered from severe TPN-dependent chronic diarrhea since birth, for which an endoscopy revealed microvillous atrophy. At 6 months, he underwent HSCT from an umbilical cord donor, which he later rejected (chimerism 10%). Despite initial good chimerism, his severe and intractable diarrhea persisted. He has been treated for over 12 catheter-associated bacteremias and numerous thromboses. The second sibling, 5 months old, was diagnosed soon after birth due to the presence of severe diarrhea also requiring TPN. At 2 months, a spontaneous HLH episode occurred. A unique HSC donor compatible with both siblings has recently been found. HSCT is currently being considered, along with an eventual small bowel transplant if HSCT is successful. Our cases highlight that STXBP2 mutations can be associated with severe diarrhea, which, when present, further complicate management because of the absence of curative measures despite HSCT. Although gut transplant could potentially improve quality of life, it has not been reported yet in these patients. Introduction: Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an Xlinked disorder caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes the Wiskott-Aldrich protein (WASp). Classical WAS is characterized by microthrombocytopenia, recurrent infections, extensive eczema and increasead susceptibility to autoimmunity and/or malignancy. Pyoderma gangrenous (PG) is an uncommon neutrophilic dermatosis that presents as an inflammatory and ulcerative disorder of the skin, with unclear reasons for the development of the inflammatory process. However, findings suggest that immune system dysregulation may contribute to PG. We report herein a case of PG in a patient with mutation in the WASp gene.

Ferritin levels greater than 10,000 have previously been reported to be highly sensitive and specific for HLH. Case presentation A previously healthy 5-week-old female infant presented to the emergency department with cough, fever and irritability. Labs were significant for anemia, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase. The patient\u00d5s ferritin was noted to be significantly elevated at 15,451 ng/mL (upper limit-150 ng/ mL) while triglycerides and fibrinogen were within the normal range. Soluble IL-2 level was elevated at 3,315 U/mL (upper limit-710 U/ml). Bone marrow biopsy showed rare hemophagocytes but an otherwise normocellular marrow with appropriate trilineage hematopoiesis. NK cell functionality assay was normal. Microbiologic studies revealed no infectious organisms in the blood or CSF. DNA sequencing showed no pathogenic mutations in genes previously linked to familial HLH, however, a potentially deleterious mutation to the PIEZO1 gene was identified. Discussion This case presents a patient with HLH-like immunodysregulation noted to have a mutation in the PIEZO1 gene. Introduction: STAT 1 gain-of-function (GOF) mutations were initially though to be associated only with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. However, subsequent reports have show that STAT1 GOF can lead to infections by histoplasma capsulatum, coccidiodes immitis and other intracellular organisms. We report here the only case we are aware of disseminated leishmaniasis caused by a GOF STAT1 mutation. Case Report: 4 year-old boy presenting with low grade fever and severe astenia for 2 weeks, with hepatoesplenomegaila, pancitopenia and liver failure, evolving to shock and respiratory failure. A bone marrow aspirate showed a hypocelular bone marrow, with hemophagocytosis and the presence of Leishmania. He was treated with lipossomal amphotericin and the HLH 20014 protocol was initiated, (without etoposide). After 8 weeks, the patient was still in serious condition, with fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated ferritin and splenic nodules.

X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder (XLPDR) is a rare syndrome characterized by skin hyperpigmentation, and immune dysfunction leading to recurring infections and sterile inflammation. Additional phenotypic characterization of the disorder remains important. Methods. Clinical phenotyping of the affected family was performed, including immunological tests and skin biopsies. Assessment for the XLPDR intronic mutation and analysis of interferon stimulated gene expression in circulating blood cells were performed. Results. We report the identification of a new case of XLPDR arising in a non-consanguineous family. The main manifestations in this case included skin hyperpigmentation, typical facial features, hypohidrosis with abnormal sweat test, recurrent lung infections, corneal scarring, enterocolitis, and urethral strictures. Dramatic activation of interferon stimulated genes was noted in circulating blood cells and an intronic point mutation in POLA1 was found, identical to previously reported cases.Conclusions. XLPDR is a rare disorder characterized most significantly by skin hyperpigmentation, facial features, and lung infections, which often prompt an erroneous initial diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. This case confirms that this disorder is a type I interferonopathy and also indicates a complete lack of allelic heterogeneity in this disease. questionnaire. Immunoglobulin route of administration, therapy setting, clinical and immunological data were collected. RESULTS: CVID_QoL, EF and RF scales correlated with age. The duration of disease did not influence HRQoL. No difference were observed between patients receiving SCIG and IVIG; no correlation was found between IgG trough level or Ig serum level at diagnosis and CVID_QoL scores. Being female, underweight, admitted in hospital, having a previous diagnosis of cancer or chronic comorbidities, taking polymedication and having an unexplained persistent entheropathy proved to be major risk factors associated with a poor health status. The number of infection correlated with a poorer HRQoL status. The experience of pneumonia, relapsing episodes of diarrhea (>4 for year), sinusitis and bronchitis (>2 for year) was associate to more severe CVID_QoL scores. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the impact of immunological, clinical and therapy-related factors on the burden of disease in patient with CVID assessed by CVID_QoL. Herpesviruses infect the majority of the human population though few cases result in severe or disseminated infections in immunocompetent patients. Patients with deficiencies in NK cell development or function may suffer from severe, sometimes lethal, infections with DNA viruses such as HSV1 (Herpes Simplex Virus 1). However, few monogeneic causes of functional NK cell disorders have been described to date. Here we describe a case report of a 17-year-old female with a history of severe and frequently recurring HSV1+ gingivostomatitis associated with decreased NK cell function. Clinical testing revealed a novel combination of normal NK cell percentage, perforin/granzyme levels, and CD107 degranulation but severely attenuated cytotoxicity against K562 target cells. Microscopy analysis of patient NK cells revealed normal conjugation with K562 targets, but reduced cytotoxic granule convergence and MTOC polarization. Mass cytometry (CyTOF) and whole exome sequencing were used in parallel to investigate these findings. A novel heterozygous mutation in the N-terminal SH2 (nSH2) domain of PLCG2 (G595R) was revealed, correlating to diminished PLCG2 phosphorylation assayed by CyTOF.
