            "text": "Human cathelicidin has a high degree of homology with other mammalian species. The gene has been mapped to chromosome 3 and has four separate exons (8) . The first exon encodes a signal piece and a part of the propeptide sequence, while exon 2 and 3 code for another portion of the pro-piece. The fourth exon encodes for the C-terminal amino acids that make up the effector peptide, and an untranslated region (Fig. 1) . The human cathelicidin is synthesized as pre-pro-protein (9) . After removal of the signal peptide component by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the propeptide is stored as an inactive form in gran-ules in human myeloid-derived cells. Following exocytosis, the pro-protein is activated by proteinase-3 at a specific site between an alanyl and leucyl residue (Fig. 2) , releasing the antimicrobial peptide from the cathelin domain (10) . However, in different tissues, different proteases may activate LL-37. For example, LL37, present in seminal fluid, is activated by prostate-derived protease gastricsin when incubated at a pH corresponding to the vaginal pH, suggesting a potential role for preventing infection following sexual intercourse (11) . Although LL-37 is stored in neutrophil granules, high concentrations of this peptide are present in the plasma. Values of 1.2 \u00b5g/mL have been reported (12) . Neutrophils, which store cathelicidin intracellularly in an inactive form, generally do not release their granule proteins until they are outside the circulation and thus are unlikely to be the source of the high level seen. The high level of LL-37 maintained in the plasma appears to be owing to complexing of the C-terminal end to lipoproteins (very low-density lipoprotein [VLDL], low-density lipoprotein [LDL] and high-density lipoprotein [HDL]), which prevents renal clearance of the protein. The exact role of the binding to lipoproteins is unknown, but it has been postulated to protect cells from the cytotoxicity of high levels of cathelicidin, or to maintain high levels in the serum as an antibacterial defense mechanism, or both.",

IL-1\u03b2 is a proinflammatory cytokine whose processing and release is tightly regulated (29) . It is a key early component of the inflammatory response. Human epithelium shows little response to LPS exposure with regard to the production of the defensin family of antimicrobial peptides (30) . However, monocytederived cells stimulated with LPS promoted a significant production of \u03b2 defensins in human epithelial cultures. This increased defensin mRNA production is mediated by IL-1\u03b2, released from monocytic type cells (31) . The porcine cathelicidins have also been shown to induce IL-1\u03b2 release (32) . Working with human monocytes, we have demonstrated that LL-37 enhances IL-1\u03b2 processing and accelerates the release of mature IL-1\u03b2. This activity was inhibited with P2X 7 inhibitors, suggesting that the effect of LL-37 on IL-1\u03b2 is mediated through activation of the P2X 7 receptor (33) . This again highlights the ability of antimicrobial peptides not only to function as part of the innate immune system, but also to form important links to the adaptive immune response.",

Experiments suggested this interaction occurs through a G-coupled protein receptor, formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1). Also, the chemotactic effect was not inhibited with human serum, administered at a dose that was known to block the antimicrobial effects of LL-37 (36) . Further studies have demonstrated that LL-37 also has chemotactic effects on mast cells. These cells, normally resident in tissue, increase at sites of inflammation, an effect believed mediated through G proteinphospholipase C signaling pathway (37) .

Using the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model of angiogenesis, Koczulla et al. (38) . showed new vessel growth after exposure to a 5 \u00b5g pellet of LL-37. A control peptide had no such effect. Also, the placement of a LL-37 pellet in a rabbit muscle resulted in both angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation) and arteriogenesis (growth of existing vessels). In vitro experiments demonstrated that the cathelicidin caused a dose-dependent proliferation of human umbilical vein epithelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, LL-37 caused enhanced sprouting of endothelial cells from cultured hamster aortic root rings. The mechanism whereby LL-37 exerts its angiogenic effect is believed to be through binding to FPRL1, a G protein-coupled receptor. Other cellular responses to LL-37 are mediated by this receptor (36) . Supporting this finding was the observation that pertussis-toxin (a G proteincoupled receptor inhibitor) eradicated the angiogenic effects of LL-37 on HUVECs. Additionally, a synthetic FPRL1 agonist hexapeptide (Su peptide) was able to mimic the proliferative effects of LL-37 when applied to HUVECs. Thus, the finding that an antimicrobial peptide has angiogenic activity, in addition to chemotactic activity, highlights the role of LL-37 not only in host defense, but also wound repair.",

For example, Neisseria gonorrhea has an energy dependent efflux pump, the mtr pump (multiple transferable resistance) that enhances resistance to a range of membrane-damaging compounds. This mtr pump allows Neisseria gonorrhoeae to withstand the damaging effect of cationic antimicrobial proteins like LL-37 (47) . Hemophilus influenza, on the other hand, uses a form of molecular mimicry to circumvent the assault by LL-37. It does so by expressing phosphorylcholine on its cell surface. Because this phospholipid is also found on host-cell membrane in the form of phosphatidylcholine, it camouflages itself as a eukaryotic cell and escapes much of the lethality induced by antimicrobial peptides, which work by targeting differences between bacterial and host membranes (48) . Other bacteria such as Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Enterococcus fecalis use an assortment of proteinases to degrade and inactivate LL-37 (49) . Some bacteria, such as Shigella, can downregulate LL-37 expression in epithelial cells and monocytes, thus enhancing its invasiveness (50) . In certain diseases, the microenvironment may affect the functioning of antimicrobial peptides. For example, in CF, F-actin and DNA, present in the airway lumen, can bind and inactivate the microbicidal effects of LL-37. Reversal of this assocation can result in restored antimicrobial activity (51) . In the case of the defensins, the high-salt microenvironment dramatically diminishes their antimicrobial effects (52) .",

These cells use genetically predetermined \"pattern recognition receptors\" to identify invading organisms. Once binding occurs, the cells attempt to phagocytose the pathogen. A further effect is the release of cytokines, which attract neutrophils, and cause activation of the adaptive immune response. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have recently been identified as being a major class of receptors that respond to conserved microbial molecules called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). For example, TLR-4 recognizes and binds Gram-negative bacterial LPS (60) . TLRs act as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immunity (61) . DCs, sentinel cells present in the skin and mucosa, possess TLR receptors. Upon stimulation, they function as antigenpresenting cells (APCs) to T cells, which allows for the clonal expansion of T and B cells. These expanded clones then can interact specifically with particular microorganisms. As previously noted, LL-37 has multiple effects on macrophages, increasing cytokine production, receptor expression, and chemokine release. Through its effects on DCs, it can promote a TH1 response. This again demonstrates how the innate and adaptive immune systems are interlinked.",

CF is a common autosomal recessive hereditary disorder in people of Northern European descent. In most instances, it is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7. The CFTR gene encodes a protein that functions as a cAMP-regulated chloride channel in the apical membrane of epithelial cells. Mutation of this protein results in chronic respiratory infections and chronic inflammation with resultant progressive damage to the lungs. The reason for this predisposition for infections seems to result from the high salt content of CF airway secretions, which inactivate many lung antimicrobial peptides (69) . The \u03b2 defensins, a major antimicrobial component in the lung, are inactivated in this environment, which compromises the hosts ability to eradicate infectious organisms (70) . 217} Although progress has been made in the treatment of CF, novel therapies are needed in order to prevent the inevitable progressive lung destruction resulting from infections and inflammation. Correction of the CFTR defect in animals results in a return of normal bactericidal killing, but progress in translating this finding to humans has been problematic (71) . In an effort to overcome this problem, cathelicidin peptides, being less affected by salt concentrations, have been evaluated for their capacity to kill resistant bacteria frequently found in the CF airways. Cathelicidins from different species have been found to have activity against a large array of bactericidal isolates from CF patients. Some of these peptides may be capable of being synthesized at a pharmaceutical scale for production and administered via aerosolization (44) .",

Levels correlated with A-a gradient (a reflection of the severity of lung injury) but not BAL neutrophil count, suggesting it is not simply the release of preformed LL-37 from extravascular neutrophils that accounts for the higher levels. Local production from epithelial cells or tissue macrophages may be responsible.",

            "text": "It is prescient to think that replacing a deficiency of cathelicidin may have therapeutic implications. Though synthetic cathelicidin mimics have not yet been developed, a related antimicrobial peptide has been successfully synthesized. A protegrin, initially isolated from porcine leukocytes, which appears to be analogous to the human defensins, was used as a template to manufacture an analog, called iseganan (77) . It is currently in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of oral mucositis secondary to systemic chemotherapy. Other prospective uses of iseganan include control of respiratory pathogens in patients with CF and reduction of oral bacteria to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia. However, in order to advance the production and clinical testing of peptide-based therapeutics, technical hurdles of synthesizing large quantities of complexly folded peptides must first be overcome (78) . Recently, the use of cathelin-like peptides coupled to human IgG has been shown to be effective in protecting mice from polymicrobial sepsis. The benefit was owing not simply from the LPS neutralizing capacity, but also the ability of the construct to kill bacteria and sterilize the blood (79) .",
