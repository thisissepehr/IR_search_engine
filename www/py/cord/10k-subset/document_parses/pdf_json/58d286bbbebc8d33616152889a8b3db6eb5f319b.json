Also, through any of several mechanisms, a number of viruses may become latent in cells only to r e -emerge at a later time to produce disease. As replicating agents, they have the potential of serving as a continuing or increasing antigenic challenge to the infected animal. Considering the complexity of the mechanisms by which viruses can cause disease, it is not surprising that vertebrate evolution has provided a number of defenses to deal with viral infection. These include specific and nonspecific mechanisms operative at a number of levels. Particularly relevant is the involvement of the immunologic network which is itself a highly complex interacting system of cellular and humoral elements. This includes various roles played by macrophages, B and T cells in the induction of an immune response to a virus, as well as the effector functions of antibody, macrophages, and various lymphocyte subpopulations in dealing with viruses and virus infected cells. While this review will focus selectively on the role of antibody and complement in neutralizing viruses, it is important to keep in mind that these humoral elements do not function alone in vivo but rather operate together with the cellular arms of the immune system in a coordinated manner.",

Some of the C3b formed by cleavage of C3 by this enzyme attaches to membranes.

However, on the surface of particles termed activators, the bound C3b is protected from detruction by the control proteins fl 1H and C3b inactivator, by a mechanism which is not presently clear. The bound C3b on this protected surface is able to interact with factors B and D-to generate a protease, C3-b~B~, which is able to cleave large amounts of C3 into the typical fragments C3a and C3b.

C5a and Ba interact with neutrophils to induce their directed migration into the area of complement activation, a property termed chemotaxis.

These molecules possess another site, termed a stabele binding site, which is recognized by cells having receptors for C3b or C4b such as neutrophils and B lymphocytes. C3b and C4b are thus able to form a bridge between complement coated viruses, bacteria, immune complexes, and neutrophils and various types of effector cells. In this context C3b and C4b may be considered opsonins as they mediate adherence of the complement activating surface to phagocytic cells such as neutrophils.

            "text": "These various biologic activities of the activated complement system represent the individual aspects of an integrated system serving to produce an inflammatory reaction and thereby confine an injurious or infectious process to the area of complement activation. For example, with the generation of the C3a and C5a fragments there is release of histamine from mast cells or basophils which in turn produces changes in permeability with edema and smooth muscle contraction. The C5a fragment and Ba bind to leukocytes and trigger their directed movement into the area of complement activation where they become adherent to the specific sites on C3b and C4b. In turn, these cells attempt to ingest the particles or pathogens to which these molecules are adherent, and in this process release enzymes which activate additional complement proteins and amplify the process. Separate from these considerations, complement, through the recognition site on B lymphocytes for C3b and C4b may play a role in the early stages of an immune response which would be particularly relevant with agents such as retroviruses, which activate complement directly without the participation of antibody. Alternatively, and to the detriment of the host, the bridging activity of C3b and C4b may mediate the attachment of a virus bearing these molecules to cells with C3b and C4b receptors, such as B lymphocytes, and perhaps thus facilitate infection by focusing such viruses on the surface of these cells. Complement possesses an additional, as yet not understood, physiogenic role in vivo which is suggested by the very high frequency of autoimmune disease in individuals with congenital absence of Clr, Cls, C2, and C4. The mechanism by which the absence of these components predisposes to these diseases is not clear. However, the absence of C2 and C4, which are encoded within the major histocompatibility complex, may indicate a defect in a gene involved in the immune response. Rapidly accumulating evidence indicates that genes in the major histocompatibility complex are involved in determining susceptibility to certain diseases. Alternatively, the components of the classical pathway may be important in the clearance of viruses which may in turn be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. A number of recent reviews have detailed the reactions and biology of the complement system: Schreiber et al. 1, 55] , Hugli and Mtiller-Eberhard [24] , Mtiller-Eberhard [38] , Rosen and Lachmann 1-50], Osler [45] , Reid and Porter [49] , Cooper and Ziccardi [9] , Fearon and Austen 1-13].",

Some enveloped viruses like pox and herpes viruses are more complex while others such as togaviruses, rhabdoviruses, and arenaviruses are less complex. The basic structure is a lipid containing membrane enveloping a nucleoprotein core. The core contains the viral nucleic acid and various proteins including a nucleocapsid protein, and usually a polymerase enzyme for nucleic acid transcription. The membrane surrounding the core and protecting these internal elements is ir~ the form of a lipid bilayer derived from and thus generally similar in lipid composition to that of the host cell. Proteins in the viral envelope are virtually all specified by the viral genome, although host cell proteins may be present occasionally. Some of the proteins are hydrophobic membrane (M) proteins which are not expressed on the virion surface, while others, which are invariably glycosylated, project outward from the virion membrane. These external glycoproteins give enveloped viruses a negative charge and hydrophilic properties. The surface glycoproteins may attach to the virion at the outer membrane surface, or in some cases penetrate the envelope and associate with internal viral structures. In some virus systems (e. g., retroviruses), a small transmembrane-protein may be linked to a larger protein [26, 53] . The surface glycoproteins often appear as spikes or knobs in electron micrographs and commonly react with neutralizing antibodies.",

These same external features are recognized by the effector elements of the immune system such as antibody and the various cytotoxic lymphocyte populations.

Polio virions with altered isoelectric point, achieved by antibody binding or by pH variation absorbed to but did not penetrate the cell membrane. Viral preparations, including those inactivated by single-hit kinetics, may contain a small 'persistent fraction' which is not neutralized by antibody. This fraction as discussed by Daniels [10] , may be associated with 'non-neutralizing' antibodies sterically interfering with the attachment of 'neutralizing' antibodies. It seems likely that the addition of complement to such preparations could significantly reduce the size of the persistent fraction, and evidence for this has been provided in the herpes simplex virus system by Wallis and Melnick [62] .",

Numerous in vitro studies dating back to Gordon's report in 1925 [19] have shown that fresh serum, presumably complement, enhances in vitro neutralization of many viruses and is a requirement for inactivation of some viruses [33] . In some cases participation of C1, C4, C2, C3, and/or properdin was assessed employing older methods based on the use of sera depleted of individual complement components termed R reagents.

These complement-dependent effects do not require lysis, and it is likely that many viruses which undergo complement-dependent lysis are in fact neutralized before completion of the lytic process. As just noted complement can lyse viruses which contain lipid in the envelope.

            "text": "When examining antibody and complement interactions with viruses, it is important to consider the host cell from which the virus has been derived. This is because the surface properties of an enveloped virus are altered by the cell in which it is grown. These host cell modifications are frequently due to the assimilation of cellular lipids, glycolipids, and carbohydrates into the viral envelope [29, 30, 51, 58] . Accordingly, enveloped viruses may be inactivated by antibody to various antigenic moieties of the membrane of the host cell from which they were derived [30, 51] , and complement may augment that inactivation [64] . Viral inactivation and viral lysis by antibody to cells has been demonstrated or inferred in several instances [3, 6, 22, 64] . As was shown by Welsh [64] , lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) passed through L-929 cells, a mouse cell line, was inactivated by fresh but not heated normal human serum, while LCMV passed through three other cell lines from various species was not. By using complement depleted and restored sera, it was shown that LCMV passed through L-929 cells was inactivated via the classical complement pathway. Reactivity of normal serum with the L-929 cell derived virus was eliminated by absorbing the serum against L-929 cells; furthermore, it was shown by immunoprecipitation that antibody with specificity for L-929 cells bound to the LCMV passed through L-929, but not through BHK cells. Welsh [64] concluded that natural antibody in human serum to the cells of origin of the virus could activate the classical complement pathway leading to inactivation of the virus. Natural antibodies are commonly heat labile, of low titer, and reactive against lipid moieties [-68 ], rendering them difficult to detect.",

Theoretically, this might reflect changes in the lipid constituents of the viral membrane, but no definitive evidence for this has been documented. There are many substances which can directly activate the classical complement pathway in the absence of antibody including proteins such as pl5E of retroviruses, lipids like lipid A of lipopolysaccharide, some lipid bilayer membranes and cholesterol, nucleic acids, and simple chemicals like sodium urate crystals. The alternative pathway is generally initiated without the participation of antibody by several agents including complex carbohydrates. It would thus not be surprising to find that viruses derived from certain cells directly activate the classical or alternative pathways due to acquisition from the cells of substances which possess complement activating ability. In this context, Welsh [64] observed that Newcastle disease virus (NDV) grown in chick embryo cells was inactivated by human serum whereas NDV grown in HeLa cells was resistant to such inactivation. No evidence for antibody involvement was obtained. Thiry et al. [61] also found marked differences in susceptibility of VSV to inactivation and lysis by human serum depending on the cell of origin in what also appears to be an antibody independent reaction.",

Antibody alone produced a halo of 30 nm in diameter which was increased up to 70 nm in the presence of complement. The protein halo was most clearly seen when fowl complement, which is non-lytic for this virus, was used.

When low concentrations of C4 were employed the addition of C2 and C3 to the mixture led to neutralization. Subsequent studies by Daniels et al. [-11] further documented that lysis was not involved as later reacting components were unnecessary, a conclusion also reached by other workers [69] . Daniels et al. [-12] postulated that complement potentiated the neutralization of HSV by covering the viral surface with additional protein. Wallis and Melnick [62] filtered complement treated HSV-antibody complexes through membranes of varying pore size to analyze the mechanism by which complement enhanced neutralization. They found that whereas HSVantibody complexes passed through the membranes, the complexes were unable to pass through membranes with much larger pore sizes after they had been incubated with complement. Although they interpreted these data as indicating that complement aggregated the HSV-antibody complexes, later studies ofNotkins et al. [39] indicated that complement does not aggregate antibody sensitized HSV as detectable by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The impaired ability in Wallis and Melnick's study [62] of antibody and complement coated HSV to pass filters may then be due to the accumulation of complement protein on the viral envelope with resulting increase in viral diameter.",

Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugal studies showed that the sedimentation rate of 125i_radiolabeled polyoma virus was increased from 240 S to 260 S on addition of 2.18 molecules of IgG anti-polyoma antibody/virion and further increased to approximately 450 S on addition of fresh serum. Serum also neutralized the sensitized virus. Paired experiments with polyoma virus surface labeled with 12Siodine and internally labeled with 3H thymidine showed the external and internal labels co-sedimented after treatment with antibody and complement indicating that the virus was not lysed. Studies with isolated complement components in place of serum showed that purified Clq crosslinked and neutralized polyoma virus sensitized with the same limited amounts of antibody (Fig. 3 ) but these properties were not retained by C1. Thus the presence of Clr and Cls in the C1 molecule rendered some of the binding sites of Clq unavailable for agglutination of virus particles. Neither agglutination nor neutralization occurred on sequential addition of C4 and C2 to the virus-antibody C1 mixture. On adding C3, however, dramatic aggregation and neutralization occurred (Fig. 3) . The crosslinking was a property of activated C3, presumably C3b, as mixtures lacking C2, which is essential for C3 activation, did not aggregate the virus. Since C3b does not generally mediate agglutination reactions, its ability to crosslink virions was unexpected. Such a reaction could occur, however, if polyoma virions possess C3b receptors. Under these conditions, C3b attached to one virion by its labile binding site could attach to the C3 receptor on another virion by its stable binding site. Preliminary evidence indicates that aggregation of antibody sensitized polyoma virus particles by el, C4, C2, and C3 may be explained in this manner.",

Purified complement components were used to show that C1, C4, C2, and C3 were sufficient to neutralize antibody sensitized NDV. Although the mechanism was not investigated it is probable that neutralization on completion of the C3 step is the result of envelopment of the virus with complement proteins as also postulated by Linscott and Levinson [333. Although later studies by Apostolov and Sawa [3] showed that NDV can indeed be lysed by complement, Linscott and Levinson's work [33] clearly showed that neutralization occurs prior to lysis. Radwan and coworkers [47] found that equine arteritis virus (EAV) could be neutralized by antibody and fresh complement at 2 \u00b0 C without release of labeled RNA. In subsequent studies [483 this group observed that CI, C4, C2, and C3 neutralized EAV sensitized with high antibody concentrations and the addition of C5, C6, C7, C8, and C9 did not further potentiate neutralization although it did induce lysis. Some neutralization was also observed with elevated C4 concentrations at the C 1,4 step. Although'the mechanism of the non-lytic neutralization was not delineated, it is probable that it is secondary to envelopment by complement protein.",

The term 'immune virolysis' was coined by Berry and Almeida [6] to characterize the effects of antibody and complement on AIBV. In examining negatively stained AIBV preparations by electron microscopy, they observed that antibody and complement-treated samples displayed numerous 10 nm lesions in the viral envelope which they termed 'holes'. They likened these to similar lesions previously observed by Borsos et al. [7] to be characteristic of the action of complement on antibody sensitized red cells. These lesions were thought then to be the actual lytic 'holes' in the membrane, a conclusion now known to be incorrect although the lesions do represent C5b-9 dependent alterations in the ultrastructure of the lipid bilayer membrane. Other morphologic changes in AIBV preparations treated by antibody and complement, also observed by Almeida and her coworkers [2, 6] are loss of viral morphology, increased viral size, apparent flattening of the virus, and increased stain penetration and radiolucency. These morphologic changes coupled with the presence of the typical 10nm lesions provides support for viral lysis. An example of changes of this type in a murine leukemia virus (MuLV) treated with antibody and complement is shown in Fig. 4 . With certain enveloped viruses additional changes have been observed including disintegration of the envelope with release of viral cores as well as varying degrees of degradation of the nucleic acid.",

Using thin section electron microscopy of LCMV treated with antibody and complement and then pelleted on filters, these workers described what appears to be a sequence of events leading to lysis (Fig. 5) . The earliest changes were coating of the viral envelope with a halo of complement protein accompanied by thickening of the envelope, blurring of the lipid bilayer structure with membrane swelling, and progressive separation of the envelope from the electron dense core. Finally, there was disintegration of the RNA cores and ultimate rupture of the envelope with expulsion of the degenerating cores. Another approach widely used to show viral lysis is a demonstration of release of internal viral constituents. Oroszlan and Gilden [44] used this approach with AKR-murine leukemia virus containing 3H-uridine labeled RNA. Antibody and complement released the 3H-RNA as well as the major (internal) group specific antigen (now called p 30) as assayed by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The RNA (and p30) was found at the top of the gradients in an RNAse sensitive form while untreated virus sedimented well into the gradient. Other similar approaches applicable to certain viruses include exposure of RNA labeled virus to antibody and complement, followed by incubation with RNAse to degrade the nucleic acid, and finally addition of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to precipitate intact virus or undegraded RNA. The reduction of TCA precipitable counts is an indication of viral lysis [47, 59] .",

Many polyanionic substances, such as yeast cell walls, agarose, insulin, and bacterial lipopolysaccharides activate the alternative C' pathway without the participation of antibody. It would, therefore, not be surprising if viruses with their arrays of repetitive glycosylated membrane proteins would activate the alternative pathway. However, there is little firm evidence to document alternative pathway activation. As early as 1949 Ginsberg and Horsfall [18] observed that NDV, mumps virus, and influenza A and B viruses (grown in chicken eggs) were directly inactivated by normal non-immune sera. Later studies by Wedgwood et al. [63] attributed this inactivation to a property of the properdin system. While the existence of a separate properdin system was questioned by most of the scientific community at that time [21, 46] , recent work has amply substantiated the existence of the properdin system or alternative pathway [14, 17, 20, 35, 52] . According to Wedgwood et al. [63] the inactivation of NDV required magnesium but not calcium (like the alternative pathway) and properdin-depleted sera only inactivated NDV after restoration of properdin. Properdin was consumed on adding NDV to serum. These findings and other studies in the paper suggested alternative pathway involvement.",

VSV had previously been reported to be inactivated by normal serum from several species including sera genetically deficient in late reacting complement components [41] . Normal, non-immune human sera neutralized up to 5 logs/ml of VSV derived from hamster, mouse, or human cell lines when mixed in equal volume with the virus [37] , and this reaction did not require components reacting after C3. Sera depleted of factor B were active, indicating that the reaction did not proceed by the alternate pathway. Sera lacking C2 or C4 were ineffective, documenting the classical pathway participation. Thus non-immune neutralization of VSV like immune neutralization, examined earlier by Leddy et al. [31] proceeds through the classical complement pathway and occurs with completion of the C3 step. Antibody does not appear to be required for this reaction for the following reasons. First, normal sera do not significantly inactivate VSV after heating as \u2022 a Exact findings were not described would be expected with classical heat stable neutralizing activity. Second, human IgG, IgA, and IgM did not neutralize VSV when tested in concentrations encompassing and exceeding normal serum concentrations, and IgG also did not sensitize VSV for neutralization by human serum. Third, absorption of normal serum with normal cells and cells expressing VSV antigens did not reduce the neutralizing activity. Fourth, immunoglobulin free Clq and C1 bound to VSV and to the isolated glycoprotein of VSV, G protein.",

These findings suggested a requirement for another serum factor in addition to C1, C4, C2, and C3, for VSV neutralization. In searching for the accessory factor in human serum, manuscript in preparationl observed that the density of intact infectious VSV was markedly reduced from 1.19 gm/ml to < 1.065 gm/ml after incubation in fresh or heated normal human serum but was unchanged on incubation in delipidated serum (Fig. 6) . Studies with serum lipoproteins indicate that very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and not chylomicrons, low density lipoproteins, or high density lipoproteins had the ability to attach to VSV and strikingly reduce its density (Fig. 7) . Present experiments are directed toward determining whether the VSV-VLDL complex, which is the normal state of VSV in the presence of serum, has enhanced ability to bind and activate C1. There could be some relationship between these findings and Leong et al.'s studies [32] on antibody and complement-independent neutralization ofxenotropic MuLV by mouse serum VLDL. ",

[-65] . Inactivation is associated with lysis of the viral particles, as retroviruses treated with fresh human serum release radiolabeled viral RNA as well as RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RDDP) activity [8, 25, 65, 66] . Several lines of evidence indicate that antibody is not required for retroviral lysis. First, antigenically unrelated viruses grown in many kinds of cells are susceptible, and all of the normal human sera tested to date (over 50) lysed retroviruses. Similar amounts of antibodies to many different kinds of antigenically unrelated viruses and/or different cells is obviously highly unlikely. Second, in a classical test for neutralizing antibody, heated human sera did not inactivate retroviruses. Third, fluoresceinated anti-human IgG, IgA, or IgM did not stain cells expressing retroviruses which had been incubated with human serum. Fourth, agammaglobulinemic human sera mediated retroviral lysis. Fifth, the ability of fresh human sera to lyse retroviruses was not impaired by absorption with cells expressing such viruses. Finally, normal human serum or pooled human immunoglobulin did not sensitize retroviruses for lysis by guinea pig complement, although human serum from a volunteer immunized with Rauscher leukemia virus (R-MuLV) and thus containing antibody did do so. Sera genetically deficient or immunochemically depleted of C2, C4, or C8 failed to lyse retroviruses ( Table 2 ), but sera depleted of factors B or D did lyse retroviruses Fig. 7 . Effect of VLDL on VSV. VSV was incubated alone or with VLDL and subjected to sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The direction of sedimentation is to the left. Flotation of VSV by VLDL is apparent although at reduced efficiency [8, 65] . Addition of purified C4 to C4-depleted serum restored the virolytic capacity [8] (Fig. 8) . These studies document the requirement for the classical pathway and completion of the complement reaction sequence for lysis. Cooper et al. [8] also showed that immunoglobulin free 1251-1abeled C l q bound directly to retroviruses (Fig. 9 ). This interaction leads to activation of purified C1 (Fig. 10) . Thus in this system the C l q subunit of C1 subserves a specific recognition function normally associated with antibody. Binding of C1 via C l q leads to activation of C1 and thus the classical pathway which is accompanied by deposition of complement proteins on the viral envelope and lysis on completion of the complement reaction sequence.",

These investigators labeled the surface proteins of M o l o n e y -M u L V with ~25I and separated them by isoelectric focusing. C l q binding and C5b-9 generation by the retrovirions after incubation in serum were properties of a surface protein with an isoelectric point of 7.5 and a molecular weight of about 15,000 daltons. Because of the molecular weight, location on the viral surface, and certain chemical properties, the complement activating peptide was referred to as p15E. However, Jensen, Robey, and Van de Woude (personal communication) have recently shown that Fab molecules directed against the p60 precursor protein of the p30, p15, and p12 proteins of M1-Moloney sarcoma virus blocks the human C-mediated lysis of retroviruses. Fab molecules directed against the p30 or gp69-71 proteins did not inhibit virolysis. These workers suggested that the pl5c or p12 proteins may also be C1 receptors. An unusual feature of complement-dependent lysis of retroviruses is the failure of complement from most non-primate species to mediate the reaction. Whereas normal sera from humans, and other primates like gibbons, monkeys, baboons, and apes, and, to a lesser degree, cats, lysed retroviruses, sera from guinea pigs, mice, chickens, rabbits, rats, pigs, dogs, and cows did not [16, 56, 65, 66] . Although one report found that rabbit sera could inactivate retroviruses [56] these authors did not rule out the possibility of heterophile antibody in the specific sera examined. In seeking an explanation for these findings, found that whereas either human or guinea pig Clq was able to bind to retroviruses, only human C1 and not guinea pig C1 was activated by retroviruses. Studies with hybrid C1 molecules containing various combinations of human and guinea pig C1 subcomponents were utilized in further characterizing the species specificity. These studies showed a requirement for the presence of human Cls for C1 activation by retroviruses. Interestingly, human and guinea pig Cls were interchangeable for activation of C1 hybrids by immune complexes or aggregated IgO. It is therefore probable that human Cls may show some type of recognition for viral determinants.",

It also inactivates retroviruses propagated in human diploid cell lines [66] . The significance of these findings are unclear, but it is interesting to note that retroviruses are seldom if ever isolated from man [-15] and never have been isolated from human serum. Humans, including laboratory workers handling milligram quantities, seldom develop an antibody response to retroviruses, yet they are not tolerant as antibody can be generated by immunization with formalin-treated virus [23] (Table 1) . It seems logical to propose that human complement provides a major defense mechanism against retrovirus infection. It can be argued that certain primates are infected with retroviruses even though their sera can lyse them [16, 56, 66] . However, viremia in these animals is rare, and the only viremic primate thus far discovered had no ability to lyse retroviruses [16] . Cat complement lyses retroviruses, although less efficiently than primate sera, and cats frequently become viremic with feline leukemia virus. However, in the absence of data a concerning the integrity of the cat complement system in such animals the role of complement in retroviral infections remains open.",

During these times they are susceptible to control by the immune system. This review has selectively focused on h u m o r a l defenses, primarily antibody and the complement system, operative in neutralizing viruses. Although several mechanisms by which a n t i b o d y alone can neutralize viruses have been identified, these may be grouped into two categories. First, antibody can contribute a coat of protein to the virus and thus [16, 56, 66] RDDP release [66] RDDP release [16] RDDP release [56] RDDP release [16] RDDP release [16] RDDP release [56] RDDP release [66] RDDP release [66] physically interfere with attachment, penetration, or other steps involved in infection. Alternatively, as antibody is bivalent and viruses are multivalent antigens, antibody may aggregate virus and thus reduce the net number of infectious particles. Antibody alone would be anticipated to play a major role in neutralization only when large amounts of avid antibody were present, for example late in a viral infection or on re-infection. Antibody always exists together with complement in the circulation in vivo and many studies have demonstrated the marked ability of complement to potentiate the neutralizing ability of antibody in vitro. Complement-dependent potentiation of the antibody effects would be expected to play a major role early in infection when limited amounts of antibody of relatively low affinity were present. Complement has been found to enhance antibody-dependent neutralization by non-lytic as well as lytic mechanisms, depending on the virus and probably antibody involved. Complement may neutralize without lysis by contributing an additional layer of complement protein to the viral surface with resulting interference with the ability of the virus to infect. Complement also neutralizes at least one virus by agglutination leading to a reduction in the number of infectious particles. While both of these effects represent non-destructive amplification of the effects of antibody alone, the other mechanism by which complement enhances the effects of antibody is by lysis which irreversibly inactivates the virus. Many, if not most viruses with lipid containing envelopes are susceptible to lysis by complement.",

Complement neutralizes such viruses either by contributing an envelope of protein and interfering with infection or, in the case of lipid containing viruses, by lysis. With viruses susceptible to direct inactivation, i. e., retroviruses, a structure on the viral envelope directly interacts with the first complement component and activates it, leading to viral lysis with completion of the sequence. With viruses of this type, complement would be expected to serve as a first line of defense and to prevent blood or lymph-borne infection. Support for this concept comes from the fact that retroviruses uncommonly, and possibly never, infect man whereas they produce several kinds of disease and are often oncogenic in non-primates. Complement from most non-primates is not triggered by retroviruses and accordingly the viruses cannot be inactivated until much later after antibody has appeared in such species. Further studies are needed to determine whether human complement functions in this manner in vivo and prevents infection of man with such viruses or alternatively, whether it selects against retrovirus producing cells and allows cells harboring retroviruses to persist in a latent state.",
