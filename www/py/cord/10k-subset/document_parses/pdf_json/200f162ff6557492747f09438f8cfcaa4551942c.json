            "text": "There is an increasing focus on the management of care of children with complex care needs (CCNs), defined as multidimensional health and social care needs, in the presence of a recognised medical condition or where there is no unifying diagnosis [1] . The provision of care closer to home has been identified internationally as an important objective for this population [2, 3] . This supports a child-centric approach to care within a health service that is increasingly focused on enhancing integrated care delivery. Given the growing population of children with CCNs, little is known about the structures and processes currently in place across the EU to support the care requirements of these children and their families. This was therefore an important area of focus within the Models of Child Health Appraised (MOCHA) project, funded by the EU under the Horizon 2020 programme. We examined the structures and processes of care in place for children with CCNs and identified key characteristics for effective integration of care for these children at the community and acute care interface across 30 European Union (EU)/ European Economic Area (EEA) countries. Three specific exemplars were chosen for examination in each of the following areas: traumatic brain injury, long-term ventilation (LTV), and intractable epilepsy. The exemplars were developed by a team of clinical and academic experts and ratified by the external advisory board to the project. The advisory board comprised of European medical, paediatric, and policy bodies, and civil society groups, including the youth subgroup of the European Patients' Forum [4] . This paper specifically reports on the findings on the constituents for the effective care for children assisted with LTV in the home.",

This is supported by a study in the United Kingdom, from 1994 to 2010 which showed a 30-fold increase in prevalence between 1994 and 2010, from 0.2-6.7 per 100,000 [5] , and more recent data available across the EU. This includes data from Italy showing a prevalence of 4.2 per 100,000 [6] , and a report from Austria showing a prevalence of 7.4 per 100,000 [7] . This is supported by trends reported internationally. For example, the number of children receiving LTV at home in Canada increased from 2 in 1991 to 156 in December 2011. This study found a twofold increase in the number of invasive ventilation initiations in the second 10 years, n = 45 (2001-2011) compared to the first 10 years, n = 21 (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) [8] . Children are reliant on LTV for a variety of reasons which may include chronic lung disease due to prematurity, congenital airway malformations, hypoventilation syndrome, neuromuscular diseases, and spinal cord injuries [9] . Therefore, these children often have frequent readmissions to hospital, are cared for by numerous health and social care providers, and are resource intensive in terms of care delivery at home [10] [11] [12] [13] . Data from studies that have investigated long-term outcomes for these children are scarce; those that exists indicate reduced long-term health related quality of life [14] . An examination of the structures and processes, and an exploration of the key constituents required for enhanced care, was therefore required to provide key foundational knowledge for the development of care services for these children and their families.",

Max has been ventilator dependent since he was born and is considered to have a life-threatening condition. A tracheostomy tube was placed at 6 weeks of age due to the need for ongoing ventilation. Max spent the first 3 months of his life in intensive care, followed by 4 months in a step-down/transitional care unit. At present Max has the following: impaired pulmonary function, developmental delay in fine and gross motor skills, and speech and language difficulties. His prognosis for weaning off the ventilator does not seem favourable at the moment and ideally he requires the healthcare input of the following healthcare professionals: community nurses, specialist consultants (respiratory, paediatrician, neurology), community general practitioner, pharmacist, speech and language therapist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, social worker, dentist, home care nursing team and respite care services.

Norway reported that it had all of the structures and processes in place for three domains: screening, assessment and referral; access to care; and care coordination. Three countries reported that they had the structures and processes in place for two of the six domains: Estonia -screening, assessment and referral and access to care; The Netherlands -care coordination and community-based care; and Croatia -communitybased care and family-professional partnerships. A further seven countries reported that they had all the structures and processes in place for one of the domains, all of which were varied. The only similarity in this finding was that Denmark and Portugal had all core components in place for screening, assessment and referral, while the Czech Republic and Lithuania had all core components in place for access to care.",

The OT 'individualised care' refers to the clinical readiness of parents to take care of their child on LTV following their discharge from hospital. Linguistically appropriate information was identified as a key constituent to effective individualised care, to support equity of care and optimum readiness for caring for the child at home. It was also suggested that parents are best supported in their transition to home when they have the opportunity to gradually increase their care input, according to their own perceived level of readiness to become the child's primary caregiver. A phased stepdown plan was identified as an appropriate way to facilitate this, whereby parents increase their input in to the clinical care of their child in an incremental manner.",

In terms of specialist medical and nursing input, this refers to linking the acute care team with the community care team, to ensure the community care team would have a full picture of the clinical care needs of the child transitioning to home.

Timely access to specialist unscheduled care was identified as critical to the safe and effective care of the child assisted with LTV. In the data returned this was referred to as the ability of families to access a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and a Paediatric Emergency Department (PED) 24/7. The need for a pathway for care, where the parameters for access were clearly understood was identified as critical to support this. In the event of a child having significant respiratory dysfunction immediate access to a PICU was identified as optimum. The OT 'pathway to non-urgent specialist care' emerged from four basic themes (BTs): monthly specialist home visit, psychological and psychiatric support, hospice and respite care, and complex care centres.

The OT 'infrastructure' emerged from data provided by the CAs on key issues that influence the opportunities for optimum integration of care at the acute community interface. These included geographical variation in access to care, challenges with transport and difficulties with volunteer support. Many countries highlighted concern about inequity in access to care for children on LTV. The CAs reported that resource allocation to support care for children on LTV can vary according to funding in different geographical areas and they also highlighted that access to specialist care, to support the child transitioning to home, varied considerably between urban and rural locations. In some cases this would mean that if a child lived outside an urban centre the family may not be able to access sufficient care for their child to live at home. Challenges were also identified regarding the transport of children assisted with LTV regardless of the child's geographical location, with ambulances often too small for the ventilation material. The OT 'standards of care delivery' emerged from three BTs: governance of care in the home, national strategy and data access and communication. The issue of governance of care in the home emerged a number of times in comments from the CAs. The majority of CAs reported a number of challenges in governance of care in the home including lack of governance of care agencies and inadequate education of nursing and care staff to care for a child on LTV in the home. This challenge was explained by some CAs by the fact that the number of children on LTV in their country was not very high, and thereby the experience of caring for them was limited. Lack of available clinical expertise in this area was also attributed to an overall shortage of healthcare professionals in many countries.",

A further challenge identified is the persistent lack of respite care and the need for an enhanced provision of this service in the home. However, such a service is not a panacea for enhanced care in the community. Specific care risks have been identified for this service, reflecting wider potential problems in the delivery of care at the interface of community and acute care. Communication at the point of the initial referral and ongoing communication pathways, primarily regarding the documentation and handover of care, is a well-recognised challenge in literature on respite care and in wider literature on documentation and safe and effective handover practices [20] [21] [22] [23] . Given the variety of statutory agencies, and the reliance on NGOs, in the care of these children, there is the potential of misinterpretation or miscommunication of information.",

            "text": "A further challenge to enhanced integrated care is the current state of advocacy. While the majority of countries reported the involvement of the family in the development of the plan of care prior to discharge, few countries take into account the voice of the families in the development of policies or national frameworks for care delivery to these children. Given the well-documented complexities involved in adapting to the role of the primary care giver for parents, the inclusion of the voices of these families has the opportunity to positively influence care delivery. There is evidence in wider literature on the care of children with CCNs that there are numerous and varied characteristics of a family that need to be understood to support family preparedness for discharge to home that goes well beyond clinical readiness to care. This includes issues relating to language, culture, race and ethnicity [24] [25] [26] , family structures and support systems [27] [28] [29] and capacity for coping [30] [31] [32] . The fact that the majority of countries do not currently collect data on the experience of care from the perspective of the parents/guardians or siblings of children assisted with LTV, suggests a persistent paternalistic health service with a limited appetite for identifying and addressing the real needs of the child and family. Understanding these experiences is important to identify specific ways that integration of care can be enhanced in a meaningful way.",

We urge caution when interpreting the data as it is always possible that some of the findings might have reflected general issues on LTV as opposed to commentary on the specific scenario presented. Although the use of the scenario afforded the possibility to create a realistic care delivery situation, it is acknowledged that there is concern about the use of hypothetical situations to elicit opinion. Nonetheless, we consider that we received rich contextual data from the CAs, as we relied on a large number of respondents, across a large number of culturally diverse countries. This was supported by the development of a glossary of terms to enhance a consistent understanding of terminology. The perspective of children and families was not included in this part of the MOCHA project and it would be important to include this perspective in further work in this area.",
