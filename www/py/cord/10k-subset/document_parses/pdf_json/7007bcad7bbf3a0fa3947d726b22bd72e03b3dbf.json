An imbalance between these two reactions can lead to a deficient response to infection. Thus, an excessive pro-inflammatory response, or a deficient anti-inflammatory response, could lead to septic shock or secondary organ damage, and conversely, a deficient pro-inflammatory or enhanced anti-inflammatory reaction could lead to persistent infection [14] . The main pro-inflammatory cytokines so far identified as being important in CAP are tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), lymphotoxin-a (LTA), interleukin (IL)-l and 6, and the principal anti-inflammatory mediators appear to be IL-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-lra).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 749, "end": 753, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Genetic Predisposition"}, {"text": "The host response against pulmonary infection is represented by the innate and adaptive components of the immune system.

One of these is the lectin pathway, mannose-binding lectin (MBL) being one of the opsonins. Several genetic polymorphisms (mutant alleles with a frequency in the general population of > 1 %) are associated with a low plasma concentraion of MBL.

One of the best studied polymorphisms is TNF-308. This polymorphism is associated with two patterns of secretion. Carriage of A allele is associated with high TNF-a levels and is associated with septic shock [20] , even in CAP [21] , whereas polymorphisms associated with low TNFa levels (G alleles in locus TNF-a-308) have a protective effect against the development of septic shock, but a trend to a greater risk of developing respiratory failure has been documented [21] . As mentioned earlier, another polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with TNF-a-308 is the LTA +250 polymorphism. Thus, carriage of A alleles of LTA 250 is also associated with high-TNF levels, and inversely, carriage of G alleles is associated with low blood TNF levels, and both loci (LTA +250 and TNFa-308) are in linkage disequilibrium. Similarly, the same authors reported more recently an association of carriage of heat shock protein (HSP) 70-2 + 1267 AA genotype and risk of septic shock in patients with CAP, with a stronger association than the LTA 250 genotype described eariier [22] , Anti-inflammatory cytokines are able to counterbalance harmful effects of the inflammatory response. In pneumococcal disease, IL-10 is one of the best studied anti-inflammatory mediators. In humans, the IL-10-1082 gene promoter polymorphism is associated with high IL-10 inducibility (G genotype) [23] .

The polysaccharide capsule was considered the primary virulence factor of S. pneumoniae because although pneumococcus exists in encapsulated and unencapsulated forms, only encapsulated strains have been recovered from cHnical specimens. Classical studies carried out by Avery and Dubos [25] demonstrated that loss of the capsule is accompanied by a 100,000-fold reduction in the virulence of pneumoccocL On the basis of differences in capsular polysaccharide structure, pneumococci can be divided into 90 serotypes, but less than 30 serotypes account for up to 90% of invasive disease in humans. Recent epidemiological studies report the dominant role of individual serotype in determining invasiveness. Brueggemann et al. [26] compared the distribution of invasive isolates with carriage isolates and showed that the potential of pneumococci to cause invasive disease differs by serotype. These authors observed that serotypes 6B, 19F, and 23F are commonly carried but have low invasiveness. Other serotypes, such as serotype 1, 5 or 7F, are rarely carried but they are common causes of invasive disease in some countries due to their high invasiveness. Other authors [27] have reported an association between capsular serotype and mortality; serotypes 3, 6B, and 19F were associated with higher mortality (25% vs 0%) when compared with serotypes 1 and 7F. A recent study has demonstrated that pneumococcal clones of serotype 1 and 7F, primarily infect previously healthy individuals and behave as 'primary pathogens' [28] .

The virulence properties of pneumolysin are directly dependent on the action of autolysin. The role of pneumolysin is crucial particularly in the early stages of pneumococcal infection. Pmeumolysin has the ability to lyse cell membranes, activate complement, and stimulate the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-ip [30] . Other studies have reported that low concentrations of pneumolysin are able to inhibit neutrophil and monocyte respiratory response, chemotaxis, bactericidal activity, and production of lymphokines and inmunoglobulins [31] . The cytolytic properties of pneumolysin cause damage to ciliated bronchial epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, and pulmonary endothelium. The result is that the ability of ciliated bronchial cells to clear mucus and particles from the lower respiratory tract is reduced, facilitating the bloodstream spread of infection [32] . In a recent study in a mouse model, Witzenrath and coworkers demonstrated that pneumolysin may play a central role in early acute lung injury (ALI) in pneumococcal pneumonia by causing impairment of pulmonary microvascular barrier function and severe pulmonary hypertension [33] . \u2022 Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) exhibits structural and antigenic variability between different pneumococcal strains, but is present in most pneumococcal clinical isolates [34] .

Surprisingly, few studies have recorded the administered empiric antibiotic therapy, dose, route, and interval of administration, and the definition of discordant therapy has been based only on the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Furthermore, given the complexity of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antibiotic therapy (peak serum concentrations, time above MIC, mechanisms of resistance of different antibiotics) categorical classification based on an arbitrary MIC cut-off for the administered antibiotic seems simplistic [44] One of the most important studies about this point analyzed the factors affecting mortality in a cohort of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia during the period 1995-1997.
