Only recipients of the inactivated vaccine were included in the present study (Institutional Review Board approval number 990325). The recipients were categorized on the basis of their vaccine-induced responses into the following groups: (1) poor responders, defined as vaccine recipients with a prevaccination hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibody titer of !1:16 who achieved a !4-fold increase in HI titer to both the H1N1 and H3N2 vaccine components after the first vaccination; (2) adverse responders, defined as vaccine recipients with a temperature \u044338.3\u040aC after the first vaccination; and (3) normal responders, defined as vaccine recipients with a \u04434-fold increase in HI antibody titer to both the H1N1 and H3N3 vaccine components and a temperature of \u044038.3\u040aC after the first vaccination. All subjects categorized as poor and adverse responders who had archived serum specimens available were included in the present study. Approximately the same number of subjects was selected from normal responders, who were matched for age, sex, and race to the poor and adverse responders. Genomic DNA was extracted from serum by use of a QIAamp blood kit (Qiagen), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions [5] . DNA extracted from 200 mL of serum ranged from 150 to 1000 ng (on the basis of measurement of optical density at 260 nm), and \u223c20 ng of DNA was used in PCR amplification. PCR was used to amplify a 119-bp region of exon 1 that contains codons 52, 54, and 57 and to detect and determine the alleles in these codons. Polymorphisms were determined by RFLP analysis through the digestion of PCR products with the restriction enzymes BanI, MboII, and MluI (New England Biolabs), followed by separation on 4% gel with ethidium bromide staining [10] . A real-time allele-discrimination PCR assay was used to detect and discriminate alleles \u03ea238 and \u03ea308 SNP in the TNF-a promoter region and \u03ea592, \u03ea819, and \u03ea1082 SNP in the IL-10 promoter region, by use of the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). PCR amplification was performed by denaturation at 95\u040aC for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 92\u040aC for 15 s, and then annealing and extension at 62\u040aC for 1 min. After PCR, the genotype of each sample was attributed automatically by measuring allele-specific fluorescence with the ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System, by use of the SDS software for allelic discrimination (version 2.2.2; Applied Biosystems).

Because very few subjects were determined to be homozygous for all 8 tested SNPs, all alleles with heterozygous and homozygous mutations were combined for statistical analysis. A multinomial logistic regression was performed for a global test in which the 3 response groups were analyzed simultaneously to obtain an overall P value for the 3 groups. Unconditional univariate logistic regression was used to test the association between host polymorphisms and varied vaccine-induced responses as well as to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The wild type of the SNPs was treated as the reference category for the OR calculation. The probability of the logistic regression was modeled for an abnormal response (either poor or adverse) for MBL-2 and for an adverse response for TNFa and IL-10.

Inflammatory responses must be finely tuned: too strong a response produces adverse events after vaccination, whereas too weak a response attenuates the immune responses. The Th1-like TNFa is a potent immunomodulator and proinflammatory cytokine that has been implicated in the pathogenesis and development of various infectious diseases. In contrast, the Th2-like IL-10 is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that plays a role in down-regulating cell-mediated and cytotoxic inflammatory responses. Several polymorphisms in the promoter regions of the genes for these 2 cytokines have been reported that affect the transcriptional regulation of the 2 genes.
