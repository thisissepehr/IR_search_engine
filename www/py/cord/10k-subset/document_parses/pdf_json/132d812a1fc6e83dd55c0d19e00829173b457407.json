The effects of interferon treatment on the initial episode of genital herpes are shown in figures 2-5. Our previous study [11] on the effect of interferon on the reactivation of oral herpes virus showed that of the disease parameters studied, shedding of virus was the one most sensitive to interferon. The duration of shedding of virus in the present study is shown in figure 2 . Patients whose lesions healed before they stopped shedding virus were not followed up to the cessation of shedding. Therefore, we used life-table analysis to make the best use of our censored observations (Le., data from patients still shedding HSV at the last visit associated with the initial episode of herpes). Half of the group receiving interferon had stopped shedding HSV from a genital site (vulva, cervix, vagina, or any combination of the three) by day 10 (median duration of shedding); half of the group receivingplacebo was still shedding virus on day 14. From day 6 of treatment until day 16, the day after the end of treatment, the cumulative P value associated with the Mantel-Haenzel statistics is <.05, a result confirming the impression given by figure 2 that the duration of shedding was shortened while interferon was being given. Thereafter, the rates are no longer different; after the last observation, on day 32, the adjusted global Mantel-Haenzel statistic is not significant. By that time, however, the percentage of subjects shedding virus was <20070 in both groups. In 770/0 of subjects, the vulva was the last site from which virus was isolated. Because cultures were taken on each day at different sites, some of which had no lesions, we decided to calculate geometric mean titers for the groups from the maximum titers obtained on each day for individual patients. As shown in figure 3 , the mean of the maximum HSV titer was reduced by f\\J10-fold (90070) in the group receiving interferon during the latter part of the treatment period.

The sum of the areas of the measurable lesions was used to calculate the mean of the areas for the two groups ( figure 4 ). The striking difference (which is not, however,statistically significant) seen between treatment groups is partly due to two subjects in the placebo group who had very extensive lesions. After treatment ended on day 14, the group receiving interferon actually had a slightly larger mean lesion area than did the placebo group; however, only small lesions were still present at this time in most subjects.
