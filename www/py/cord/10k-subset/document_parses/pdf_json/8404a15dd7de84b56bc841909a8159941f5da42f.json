Li et al. (2009) have opened the discussion on the modeling principles of environmental transmission, addressing the topic from a very general perspective. Using a paradigmatic mathematical model, they demonstrated that environmental transmission appears like direct transmission in certain situations where the density of the pathogens in the environment remains approximately constant. Notably, Li et al. (2009) and Spicknall et al. (2010) emphasized that environmental transmission is empirically recognized as mediating the spread of human respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis, SARS and influenza. However, most of the modeling work on these diseases uses a direct transmission mechanism, despite difficulties in defining the notion of infectious contact. The direct transmission incidence term is typically defined based on the principle of proportional mixing between susceptible and infected individuals. Relaxing this principle by using complex contact networks between individuals still relies on the notion of infectious contact.

Indeed, in the case where the persistence time of the pathogen is small (i.e., \u03b7 is large and t is thought as a slow time), V is a fast variable (i.e., |dV /dt| = O(\u03b7)) while S and I are slow variables (i.e., |d S/dt| = O(1), |d I /dt| = O(1)). However, a direct approach using 1/\u03b7 as the only small parameter does not provide the expected outcome: V vanishes in the zeroth order in 1/\u03b7 [c.f., Eq. (3)] and the resulting slow system has only a disease free state and no epidemic threshold.For pathogen to remain present in the environment when its decay rate is large (i.e., \u03b7 1) and the number of shedders is small (i.e., I = O(1) during disease invasion), we must also have that shedding rates are large; i.e., \u03c9/\u03b7 = O(1). Hence, the slow system associated to our model is given by d S/dt = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bcS \u2212 \u03c1 S f (\u1e7c (I )), (23) d I /dt = \u03c1 S f (\u1e7c (I )) \u2212 (\u03bc + \u03b3 )I,", "cite_spans": [{"start": 65, "end": 80, "text": "(Fenichel 1979;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 81, "end": 95, "text": "Sakamoto 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 96, "end": 120, "text": "Berglund and Gentz 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A Calculation of the direct transmissibility parameter using the slow-fast dynamics formalism"}]}
