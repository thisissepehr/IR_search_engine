Pulmonary clearance of IAV was reduced, and pulmonary inflammation and severity were increased in Sftpa\u2212/\u2212mice compared with wildtype mice [10, 11] . SP-A was also found to disturb the host inflammatory response to IAV infection in mouse models without directly influencing viral growth and spread, and even without demonstrable viral binding, at least when the virus was resistant to neutralization by SP-D [9] . Insufficient amounts of surfactant, particularly SP-A, have been observed in prematurely born infants with respiratory distress syndrome (pRDS). The haplotype 1A 0 or SFTPA1-SFTPA2 haplotypes containing 1A 0 have been repeatedly associated with the development of pRDS, whereas SP haplotypes containing 1A 1 were found to be protective against that condition [5, 15] . These findings parallel those observed in our study, suggesting that 1A 0 and 1A 1 might influence the inflammatory response and the severity of H1N1pdm infection without binding to IAV.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 602, "end": 606, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 607, "end": 610, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 871, "end": 874, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1236, "end": 1239, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1240, "end": 1243, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Human SP-A1 and -A2 have similar in vitro hemagglutination-inhibition activity of IAV strains exhibiting non-or poorly glycosylated hemagglutinins heads [14] . However, in all functional assays, SP-A2 is more active than SP-A1 [5, 15] . So it is not surprising that among all the genetic variants of collectins analyzed in our study, only a few alleles and haplotypes of SFTPA2 were associated with H1N1pdm severity in hospitalized patients. Furthermore, the effect of the SFTPA2 variants on the need for ICU admission was detected in the first few days of hospitalization, as would be expected for components of the innate immunity involved in inflammation and defense against IAV infection. The significance of the functional differences between variants at SFTPA1 and SFTPA2 is poorly understood [5, 15] . The variant rs1965708 produces an amino-acid change at residue 223 (Q223K), located in the CRD of SP-A2, and might directly influence the binding properties to either IAV or the antiinflammatory receptor SIRP\u03b1. Residue 9 (rs1059046, T9N) is located in the signal peptide, and it is unknown whether this variant may affect the protein. It is, however, worth noting that haplotypes 1A 0 and 1A 1 differ precisely at residues 9 and 223. A role of SNPs at regulatory regions in haplotypes 1A 0 and 1A 1 in translation and/or RNA stability of SFTPA2 cannot be ruled out [5, 15] . Interestingly, SP-A2 1A 1 variants were shown to have a lower activity for enhancement of TNF-\u03b1 in macrophage-derived THP-1 cells than other variants, such as 1A and 1A 0 , particularly after oxidative stress [28, 29] . These data suggest that the protective effect of the SP-A2 1A 1 variant in the severity of H1N1pdm infection could be due to its lower proinflammatory activity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 153, "end": 157, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 227, "end": 230, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 231, "end": 234, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 799, "end": 802, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 803, "end": 806, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1374, "end": 1377, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1378, "end": 1381, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1593, "end": 1597, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1598, "end": 1601, "text": "29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Irrespective of the causal SNP(s), our data suggest that the haplotype 1A 0 of SFTPA2 is associated with a higher severity after H1N1pdm infection, whereas the SFTPA2 haplotype 1A 1 was associated with a dominant protective effect against severe forms of H1N1pdm infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We acknowledge several limitations of our study.

Nevertheless, considering odds ratios and a significance level of 5%, the power of the associations of rs1965708-C with the development of ARDS and septic shock was 84%, and more than 88% for the need for MV. In the haplotype analysis, statistical power was 88.56% for the effect of the haplotype 1A 1 on ICU admission (90.62% for the effect in a dominant model). No correction for multiple comparisons was performed in these comparisons, but, as expected by in vivo and in vitro studies among the human collectins, only SP-A would be expected to influence H1N1pdm infectivity, and significant associations were repeatedly observed with several clinical phenotypes. Furthermore, the observed associations were found to be independent of age, gender, risk factors predisposing to severe H1N1 infection, and development of either secondary bacterial pneumonia or bacteremia. Variants of SFTPA2 were clearly associated with functional parameters of gas exchange, underscoring their role in the severity of H1N1pdm-induced lung injury.
