The literature supports its accuracy, as well as its role as a point-of-care modality. Differentiating pulmonary processes such as pneumothorax [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , pulmonary contusion [12] , heart failure [13, 14] and ARDS [15] with chest ultrasound have shown high diagnostic effectiveness. Chest radiographs remain the standard of care for the diagnosis of pneumothorax [3] , despite lower overall accuracy as compared to ultrasound. As our case illustrates, care must be taken with some rare, misleading artefacts. The emergency physician must maintain a high index of suspicion when the chest radiograph does not match the patient presentation. Point-of-care chest ultrasound is gaining support as a diagnostic tool which is easy to perform, readily available, safe and timesaving, and should be recognised as a necessary skill for the emergency physician [16].
