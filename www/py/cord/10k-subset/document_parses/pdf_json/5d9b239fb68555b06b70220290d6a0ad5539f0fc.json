Australia antigen in monolayer cultures of differentiated human embryo liver cells 3 proved unpredictable. More recently, however, the induction of progressive changes in such cultures has been reported after inoculation with a known infective hepatitis serum. There was progressive involvement of the normal cellular components of the cultured liver cells, as demonstrated by specific fluorescent antibody attachment, first in the cytoplasm, then in the perinuclear membrane and finally condensation in the nucleoli. Similar progressive changes have been observed in cells of liver cultures inoculated with supernatant fluid which has been passaged in culture once 4 \u2022 Virtually identical fluorescent changes have been reported in liver cells cultured from biopsy material obtained from a patient with circulating Australia antigen. After six passages of the cells, the cultured cells still contained Australia antigen in the nuclei and the antigen was also detected by radioimmunoassay in the supernatant fluid 5 \u2022 More reliable changes can be obtained, however, by using small fragments of tissue maintained in synthetic media as organ cultures. These can be used to propagate certain viruses that are difficult to grow in conventional cell cultures. A technique has now been developed for maintaining human embryo liver organ cultures for at least 10 days. These cultures support the growth of type 3 adenovirus 6 , and they have been used for the inoculation of serum specimens from patients and carriers of type B viral hepatitis with some encouraging results 7 \u2022 Human livers, obtained after abdominal hysterotomy, from 10-16-week-old embryos were prepared for organ culture as soon as possible after dissection, usually within 3--4 h. The tissue was washed in Hanks balanced salt solution and cut into fragments of approximately 2 cm 3 \u2022 Three fragments were placed on sterilized stainless steel grids, which fit into the centre well of a Falcon disposable plastic organ culture dish (Fig. 1 ). Eagle's minimum essential medium with 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 100 U of penicillin, 100 ).lg of streptomycin and 50 U of 'Nystatin' ml. -l, was added to the centre well until the tissue was bathed but not immersed in the medium (0.8 ml.). The pH of the medium was maintained at 6.8 and the cultures incubated at 35\u00b0 C. A sample of 0.1 ml. of serum from three different sources was used for inoculation. Serum P.J.G. was obtained from a former blood donor who was implicated in three cases of serum hepatitis. His serum was shown to be infective by volunteer studies and Australia antigen has been demonstrated repeatedly in his serum 8 \u2022 Serum R.B. was collected from a jaundiced patient admitted to a London hospital with viral hepatitis and Australia antigen was subsequently detected serologically. Serum G.C. was obtained from an apparently healthy volunteer blood donor whose blood had caused two deaths from post-transfusion hepatitis in transfused recipients.
