The Second Meeting of West European Societies of Biological Psychiatry is organised by the three founding countries, Belgium, France and Germany. Other West European countries will join us to support the Meeting: we are really happy to welcome our colleagues from Switzerland and Austria to Strasbourg. We are also pleased to announce that the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry again supports our Meeting. Like in human history, mutations and transitions are commonly seen by each of us on the path of our lives. Today we have a better knowledge of how much psychiatric disorders have their origin in continuous or repeated phenomena and how much continuous psychological modifications could influence and impact on the general course of psychiatric disorders.",

Cognitive deficits are now considered to be core symptoms of patients suffering from schizophrenia to such a general extent that virtually all cognitive functions are regarded as defective. However, cognitive functions are not equally disturbed. Recent meta-analyses and reviews of cognitive impairments in schizophrenia have consistently shown that, along with attention and executive functions, episodic memory is particularly impaired. Episodic memory is itself a complex cognitive function, however, and it is necessary to differentiate between its intact and impaired aspects. A better understanding of the functional mechanisms underlying the episodic memory dysfunction in schizophrenia is a prerequisite for unraveling its neural correlates in neuroimaging studies and, more generally, for developing an integrated approach to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. It is also crucial for developing cognitive remediation. Empirical evidence of episodic memory dysfunction in schizophrenia will be reviewed, with reference to various theoretical models of episodic memory. All the studies converge to show a significant impairment of episodic memory, which is impaired in its critical feature, conscious recollection. They also show a defect of autobiographical memory and associated conscious recollection. The episodic memory dysfunction results from a predominant failure of strategic processing at encoding, although an impairment of strategic processing at retrieval cannot be ruled out. The possibility that it is not the execution of the encoding strategies that is defective, but their self-initiation by the patients is plausible. These findings may explain some behavioral abnormalities associated with schizophrenia, notably inadequate functional outcomes in everyday life. They may have also implications for cognitive remediation and better social and work functioning of patients with schizophrenia. In a prospective-longitudinal study maternal anxiety was measured at 12-22, 23-32 and 32-40 weeks of pregnancy, with the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. 72 firstborns of 86 mothers, recruited at the Obstetrical and Gynecological Board consultations of a University Hospital were followed up to age 8-9, and 58 up to age 14-15. At the age of 8-9 hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that maternal state anxiety during pregnancy explained 9% of the variance in self-reported anxiety, as measured with the State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children. Effects remained when controlling for child's gender, parents' educational level, smoking during pregnancy, birth weight and postnatal maternal anxiety. At the age of 14-15, HPA-axis function was measured through establishing a saliva day-time cortisol profile (shortened version); during a week-end day 3 saliva samples were provided, namely immediately after awakening, at noon and in the evening. Severity of depressive symptoms was measured with the Children's Depression Inventory. We tested the following two hypotheses: (a) that maternal anxiety during pregnancy predicts altered HPA axis function (e.g., a flattened cortisol profile) in the adolescent offspring; (b) that altered HPA axis function mediates the association between prenatal maternal anxiety and depressive symptoms in these adolescents. Repeated measurements regression analysis and ordinary least-squares regression analyses indicated that maternal anxiety at 12-22 weeks of pregnancy was in female and male offspring associated with a diurnal cortisol profile that was attenuated due to elevated cortisol secretion in the evening. Moreover, in female adolescents this flattened cortisol curve was associated with depressive symptoms. Effects remained when controlling for covariates such as smoking during pregnancy, birth weight, obstetric risk, postnatal maternal anxiety and Tanner puberty phase. Our results indicate that maternal anxiety during pregnancy enhances neurobiological vulnerability to depressive symptoms, possibly by altering (or 'programming') foetal physiology. They also demonstrate the mediating role of HPA axis dysregulation in linking an adverse foetal environment to depressed mood.",

A number of functional candidate genes such as the CRH receptor 1 and the AVP receptor 1b have been investigated, and converging evidence from animal and human studies suggests a role in the vulnerability for MDD. Recently, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) has been the focus of attention. GR downregulation could explain the relative deficiency of the negative feedback regulation of the HPA axis seen in MDD. Mice with a genetically reduced GR expression exhibit normal baseline behaviors but demonstrate increased helplessness after stress exposure, a behavioral correlate of depression (1) . Similar to MDD patients, these mice have a disinhibited HPA system and a pathological dexamethasone/corticotropin-releasing hormone test. In the human GR gene, several polymorphisms have been described that alter the function or the expression of the gene. Recently, two independent publications found evidence for association between MDD and GR polymorphisms (2, 3) . While the genetic association findings in MDD are still to be considered preliminary and awaiting confirmation, the overall evidence for the involvement of the human GR gene in the pathophysiology of MDD is becoming more consistent. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a stress-related disorder caused by traumatic experience. PTSD is characterized by structural changes in many brain regions (including the hippocampus) associated with persistent cognitive intrusions, avoidance and arousal. Most people recover from these structural changes and symptoms following psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy. However, this recovery is followed by relapse within months after the end of treatment, in about 40% of cases. Today, only continuation of medication (with mainly antidepressants) beyond symptom elimination is known to improve hippocampal functioning and to prevent PTSD relapse. Given the potential link between hippocampal functioning and PTSD relapse, we have hypothesized that hippocampal high-frequency stimulation, known to increase synaptic efficacy in hippocampal outputs, would prevent symptom recovery in animal models of fear return. We found that fear extinction in rats was followed by potentiation of synaptic efficacy in hippocampal-medial prefrontal cortex outputs. In our first model (based on artificial induction) of fear return, we observed that suppression of this potentiation with hippocampal low-frequency stimulation provoked the recovery of the extinguished fear during the retention test of extinction. In our second model (based on behavioral induction) of fear return, we found that rats submitted to a chronic mild stress procedure before fear conditioning failed to develop potentiation of hippocampal-medial prefrontal cortex synaptic efficacy following extinction, and displayed fear return during the retention test of extinction. Finally, hippocampal highfrequency stimulation restored potentiation of hippocampalmedial prefrontal cortex synaptic efficacy and prevented fear recovery. These data suggest that a loss of potentiation of synaptic efficacy in hippocampal outputs constitutes a potential key mechanism of PTSD relapse. A brain stimulation that increases hippocampal activity following termination of PTSD treatment may therefore reduce risk of PTSD relapse.",

Dr. Guislain, Dept. of Neurophysiology, Gent, Belgium Cognitive evoked potentials are well suited to capture the fast dynamics of cortical generators within the narrow time window of 1-800 msec. As such, their role in clinical psychiatry is very promising both on a diagnostic and a therapeutic level. Yet to be successful, their variance has to be contained by rigid adherence to basic standard evaluation and test protocols underpinned, as far as the practitioner is concerned, by an in-depth knowledge of technical, signal analytic and clinical psychophysiological principles and insights, all forged by hands-on training and study. Specific aspects of averager technology are discussed in the light of those ERP dynamics (peaks versus components) and sources of variance in stimulus response time interval and its effect on global averages are specifically mentioned. A tool bag of novel techniques that has been developed recently should be ported to the clinical daily workplace in order to push the temporospatial resolution of the qEEG-ERP as a multifunctional probe in cognitive and affective brain (dys)function. This is illustrated with some examples. It is concluded that those developments in clinical psychophysiology are about to open up a set of new windows on the brain with special emphasis on their power to identify consistent endophenotypes in several psychiatric pathological entities. The actual consensus about some of those clinico-physiological correlations is presented to the general practitioner who needs to overview those elements at the glimpse of an eye.",

In all studies reporting positive results on depression, rTMS treatment was spread over a period of two weeks or more, on a daily basis. Some, but not all previous 'healthy volunteer' studies, reported a mild transient increase in self-rated sadness after a single rTMS session. More recent studies, using larger sham-controlled volunteer samples failed to replicate these findings. Although subjectively experienced mood constitutes an important output of emotion, it gives only limited insight into the neurocircuitry of emotion: Emotionally generated physiological responses (e.g. stress hormones, such as cortisol) or brain reactions to visual stimuli (e.g. emotional pictures) might operate independently of verbal reports and might provide the opportunity to track psychological events in real time.",

Universit\u00e9 Lyon, EA4166, Centre Hospitalier Le Vinatier, Bron, France Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a new promising tool in psychiatry as demonstrated by the growing body of literature since its first use in depression in 1993. In a brief description of the literature, we will examine the large number of treatment variables which could explain the range in response rates: the choice of stimulation parameters, the indistinct site of stimulation; the usefulness of neuronavigation, rTMS as an Add-on therapy, the adequate sham technique, and the better indication. Several meta-analyses examined the antidepressant efficacy of rTMS and found evidence for statistical benefits but the clinical interest remain limited. Last year the first multicentric study with large sample and without antidepressive medication which compared rTMS and placebo in depressive patients was published: results are in accordance with previous works with standardized criteria. The authors showed a significant effect of rTMS compared to placebo after 30 sessions using high frequency to the left dorso lateral prefrontal cortex. Also they used very higher parameters than in previous publications; they obtained only a moderate effect. Moreover, one important question concerns laterality and frequency: should we treat our patients with low or high frequency to the right or the left dorso lateral cortex? Others works are needed before publishing recommendations for the use of rTMS in major depression. For this purpose, we develop at present a French multicentric blinded sham controlled study with the aim to answer questions regarding the utility of rTMS in depression.",

Several TMS-paradigms reflect inhibitory or facilitatory mechanism in the motor cortex: 1. cortical silent period (CSP) the general degree of inhibitory mechanisms within the sensorimotor loop, 2. intra-cortical inhibition (ICI) and facilitation (ICF) the excitability within one motor cortex and 3. ipsilateral silent period (ISP) the inhibitory mechanism between both motor cortices. Hyperactivity is one of the most outstanding symptom of ADHD, it seems to be reduced in adults. In childhood several dysfunctional patterns of motor system excitability could be demonstrated by TMS experiments. Such investigations were not published for adult ADHD patients. We investigated 21 adults with ADHD without psychiatric comorbidity and without any neurological disorders and compared them with an age-and sex-matched control group (single-pulse TMS: CSP, ISP; paired-pulse TMS: ICI, ICF). Correlations with clinical characteristics (subscores of the CAARS) were analyzed. The investigation was repeated after a stable dose of MPH. While ICI and ICF were not significantly changed in patients, ISP findings showed a decreased duration, whereas the latency was not different to that of normal subjects. The shortened duration was negatively correlated with the CAARS subscore for hyperactivity. These results are in contrast to the recently published data in ADHD children, which described a decrease of ISP duration as well as prolongation of latency and a normalization of both parameters after an intake of a stable dosage of MPH. MPH improved the remaining impaired ISP (shortened duration) in our ADHD adults, too. These data suggest that ISP could be understood as a solid neurobiological characteristic of deficient inhibitory motor control in ADHS as well in child as also in adulthood. It seems to normalize partially during transition into adulthood, probably due to a normalization of an underlying maturation deficit on synaptic level. Since MPH as an indirect dopamine agonist improve these inhibitory mechanisms, the role of dopamine and the dopamine-hypothesis is to be particularly discussed.

There is ongoing controversy over the validity and prevalence of PEABP. Confusion has resulted from attempts to apply adultderived diagnostic criteria to children without allowance for developmental differences and from use of excessively inclusive signs. However, there is a growing consensus that this disorder may not be rare, when considering its atypical presentation, as a varying developmental expression of bipolar disorder. Compared to adult population, PEABP is characterized by co-occurring symptoms of major depression and mania, a more chronic course, a poor response to mood stabilizers, and a high level of comorbidity, particularly with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).",

Controlled studies involving this young population lack and many questions concerning PEABP treatment remain unanswered. Neurological soft signs (NSS) are frequent in patients with schizophrenia and their biological relatives. Neurological impairments (sensory dysfunctions, gait and balance impairment, dyscoordination, etc.) seem to be associated with the genetic risk for schizophrenia, even when the disease itself is absent. Their presence might be a valuable composite intermediate phenotype for genetic studies (Gourion et al, 2003) . Cohort studies in general population showed that presence of NSS increase the risk for an individual to later present schizophrenia (Leask et al, 2002) . Literature about ''At Risk Mental States'' for psychosis lacks for studies evaluating the possibility of such subtle anomalies to predict risk for transition to psychosis. In order to address this question, we have started a longitudinal prospective study in at risk mental states. Preliminary analyses were conducted in order to examine whether hypothesis NSS are associated with more cognitive impairment and neurodevelopmental anomalies. 60 young adults presenting ''at risk mental states'' have been included for a year in our program.",

Cognitive difficulties are present in a large majority of patients, both at disease onset (Saykin et coll., 1994) and after the first years of treatment (Harvey et coll., 1999) . How cognitive difficulties evolve across the entire lifespan in patients with schizophrenia has been less thoroughly studied and results are still debated (Kurtz, 2005) . A first view, based on observations of patients experiencing a severe worsening in cognitive abilities with aging, especially after 65, consider schizophrenia as a ''neurodegenerative disorder'' (Harvey et coll., 1999; Friedman et coll., 2001) . Alternatively, others describe a relative consistency of cognitive performances across age, when compared to healthy controls (Zorilla et coll., 2000; Heaton et coll., 2001) . According to the latter view, schizophrenia is considered as a ''static encephalopathy' '. The aim of the present study was to use a comprehensive neuropsychological battery to evaluate whether cognitive deficits that are observed early in schizophrenia further decline when patients get older. In order to do so, we examined the interaction between aging and neuropsychological abilities in a cross-sectional study carried-out in 83 patients with schizophrenia and 65 healthy controls.

After the 1980s, schizophrenia began to be viewed within a neuro-developmental model.

Several neurohistological studies have been conducted using the brains of schizophrenic patients obtained upon autopsy. There appears to be too few cells in the superficial layers of the cortex and too many cells in the deeper layers. This suggests, in deed, that the neurons failed to migrate as far as they should have. This displacement prevents the optimal establishment of neural connections. But why do the symptoms begin so much later than the underlying neural events? We have evidence of cellular disruption in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic patients. This area is not fully myelinated and therefore not fully mature until late adolescence. Perhaps a disruption in cell migration occurs in the second trimester, but the effects of this problem are not completely appreciated until the prefrontal cortex is called on to perform cognitive operations some two decades later. On the other hand, following Kraepelin (1871) , the key pathophysiology of schizophrenia is neurodegeneration. Patients with schizophrenia experience clinical deterioration that leads to occupational and social dysfunction. Recent brain imaging data suggest that early progressive brain volume changes in the first year after the diagnosis of schizophrenia predict the 5-year outcome of schizophrenia. The patients who had the largest decrease in grey matter in the first year had the highest negative symptom scores and were less likely to live independently 5 years after this first evaluation. Neurodevelopmental abnormalities and later neurodegeneration are not exclusive processes. In fact, both may predominate at different illness stages and in different subtypes of that condition.",

Based mainly on the description of prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia in DSM-III and its revision as well as on findings of 'high risk' research, the 'ultra-high risk' (UHR) criteria were suggested in 1998 as the first definition of an imminent risk of frank psychosis predicting conversion within 12 months. They consist of attenuated psychotic symptoms (APS) in terms of five DSM-IV criteria of schizotypal personality disorder, of brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms and the combination of a risk factor for psychosis, i.e. a schizotypal personality disorder or a positive family history for psychosis, and a recent, yet persisting significant decline in functioning. Besides an average 12-months conversion rate of 38% in UHR-subjects mainly at risk by APS and not receiving special anti-psychotic treatment, studies of UHR-samples have reported various impairments and aberrations for this clinical group incl. high frequency of 'co'-morbid psychiatric conditions, neurocognitive deficits and structural brain aberrations, such as an increase in gyrification. Based on the German psychopathological tradition, i.e. the basic symptom concept, in 2001, a complimentary approach to an even earlier was proposed defined by subtle, subclinical, selfexperienced disturbances of thought processes and perception. At a 20%-conversion rate in persons reporting these symptoms, the overall conversion rate to schizophrenia in a first prospective study with a nearly 10-years mean follow-up period was as high as 65%.",

The aim of the session is to analyse if an early diagnosis of dementia has real implications on the medical strategy and management and if this really influences the disease course. When a patient comes to us presenting signs and symptoms of an early dementia we all try hard to make a proper and detailed differential diagnosis.",

With the development of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) that may not to be efficacious in the treatment of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), there is an increasing need for distinguishing FTD from AD. Moreover, a different prognostic profile of FTD versus AD strengthens the need for (early) differential diagnosis. Despite striking neuropsychological and behavioural differences between FTD and AD, clinical diagnostic criteria often fail to differentiate FTD from AD. Although a combination of behavioural, neuropsychological and physical findings was useful in distinguishing FTD from AD, behavioural quantification appeared to be more sensitive than cognitive testing in FTD. However, frequently used behavioural assessment scales lack sensitivity for FTD as they have specifically been developed for AD. Therefore, behavioural assessment scales that are based on systematic behavioural observation of frontal lobe symptoms might be helpful tools for diagnosing FTD. We therefore developed the Middelheim Frontality Score (MFS), a disease-long clinical and behavioural assessment tool that measures frontal lobe features. The MFS consists of ten items that are scored either zero (absent) or one (present) yielding a total maximal score of 10. In order to assess discriminatory power and intra-and interrater variability, a prospective study was set up, including patients with probable AD (n=400) and FTD (n=62). Applying a total MFS score of 5 as cut-off for discriminating FTD from AD, specificity and sensitivity values of 89% were achieved. Intra-and inter-rater variability was calculated in different study populations by means of retest correlation, revealing moderate to strong positive correlations of high statistical significance. We hypothesise that the discriminatory power of behavioural observation will even be higher in the earliest disease stages given the relatively low mean MMSE scores of AD patients (13. 9\u00b16.9 ) that were included in the latter study.",

Counseling and support of caregivers is as important as in Alzheimer's disease. (3) Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) differs from Alzheimer's disease (AD) in terms of marked fluctuation of symptoms, vivid visual hallucinations, intolerance of antipsychotics, and Parkinsonian symptoms. Cholinesterase inhibitors are probably as effective as in SAD. For the treatment of psychotic symptoms atypical antipsychotics should be used with caution. Management must take into account attentional problems and movement disorder. Dementia in Parkinson's disease is clinically similar to DLB, but motor symptoms are more prominent and precede cognitive decline by several years. There is marked slowness of information processing. The movement disorder is treated by medications that enhance dopaminergic neuro-transmission. Cognitive impairment may respond better to cholinesterase inhibitors than in SAD. (4) Clinical features of progressive supranuclear palsy include lack of coordination, stiffness of neck and trunk, difficulty with voluntary eye movements, motor slowing, proneness to falls, and subcortical dementia. Response to dopaminergic agonists is usually poor. Non-pharmacological management should include physiotherapy. (5) Corticobasal degeneration is characterised by poor coordination, akinesia, rigidity, myoclonus, postural instability, limb dystonia, and cognitive impairment. Dopaminergic drugs are rarely beneficial. Tremor and myoclonus may be controlled with clonazepam. Rigidity may respond to baclofen. (6) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) affects both upper and lower motor neurons throughout the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include muscular weakness, atrophy, fasciculations, cramps, dysarthria, and dysphagia. ALS can be associated with a frontal lobe dementia. Riluzole prolongs survival by 3 to 6 months. Treatment should include occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and speech therapy. (7) Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder caused by excess trinucleotid repeats on chromosome 5. Essential features are hyperkinetic movement disorder (chorea), postural instability, Parkinsonism, dystonia, personality change, and subcortical dementia. Chorea may respond to dopamine antagonists, and physiotherapy is essential. The identification of clinical and neurobiological correlates of suicidal behaviour has led to the formulation of an explanatory stressdiathesis model. This model incorporates clinical characteristics such as impulsive aggression, mental pain and hopelessness, and biological characteristics relating to disorders of the serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission systems and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Moreover, the association between these biological and clinical characteristics is becoming clear. Neuropsychological processes involving attention, memory, emotion recognition and decision making may be crucial for our understanding of this relationship. Genetic epidemiology provides support for the findings from earlier studies suggesting a genetic predisposition to suicide studies by showing that interplay between genetic and environmental influences may lead to the development of the predisposition to suicidal behaviour. A number of candidate genes have been identified. In addition, the study of gene expression in brain regions of interest and the study of the effects of gene polymorphisms on brain structures yield interesting results. While these findings increase our insight in the neurobiological mechanisms underlying suicidal behaviour, for the clinician there is emerging evidence that biological testing can supplement clinical judgment in predicting the risk of suicidal behaviour. There are opportunities for new therapeutic targets aiming at the prevention of the development of the diathesis or of its fatal consequence, i.e. suicide.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Further research is warranted, but patients with severe, longstanding, treatment-refractory OCD or MDD may benefit from DBS in the ventral part of the anterior limb of the internal capsule. Basal ganglia consist of central grey nuclei which process cortical information and send back an efferent message to the frontal cortex. The three cortical functional territories, motor, associative and limbic, process motor, cognitive and emotional information and transmit distinct output to separate regions of the basal ganglia. Many aspects of psychiatric disturbance have been linked to dysfunction of the basal ganglia, or their connections with other brain regions. Thus, in Tourette syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD), current pathophysiological models favour a dyfunction of the striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical circuit. In Parkinson's disease (PD), non-motor therapeutic effects of high frequency subthalamic nucleus stimulation, suggest that modulation of downstream associativo-limbic regions in the basal ganglia could improve behavioural disorders as it has been shown in Tourette syndrome. Given its organisation and its position, and in spite of its small size (10 \u00b7 6 \u00b7 3 mm), the subthalamic nucleus can receive and process information from diverse sources. Recently, we suggested that the three functional modalities (sensorimotor, cognitive and emotional) could be combined in the very small volume the subthalamic nucleus which thus would serve as a nexus for the integration of motor, cognitive and emotional components of behaviour (1) . The role of the subthalamic nucleus in the control of behaviour, the improvement of anxiety, repetitive behaviors, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and OCD in PD patients treated by stimulation of the STN (2) (3) (4) , the long-term effects and safety of subthalamic nucleus stimulation in PD patients, and the possibility to focus high frequency stimulation to a small finely-defined structure using validated procedures led us to propose the subthalamic nucleus as a target for the treatment of highly-resistant OCD. Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is sometimes a highly disabling side effect of antipsychotic treatment for which medical treatment often gives disappointing results. There has been a renewed interest in surgical treatment for various movement disorders in recent years.",

G Our research group has focused on the reduction of processing speed in schizophrenia, and its contribution to a cluster of symptoms defined as psychomotor slowing. In the first part of this lecture an overview will be given on psychomotor symptoms in schizophrenia. Four groups of symptoms have been described, some of them in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, e.g. by Kraepelin and Bleuler: (1) catatonic symptoms, (2) psychomotor slowing, (3) neurological soft signs (NSS), (4) and extrapiramidal dysfunctions. We will focus on the symptomatology and course; the interrelationships; the relationships with positive, negative, cognitive, and depressive symptoms; the assessment; the neurobiology; and treatment options.In a second part research data of our group will be presented on psychomotor slowing, as measured by the Symbol Digit Substitution Test, and by computerized analysis of performances during copying tasks. It will be argued that in psychomotor slowing a distinction has to be made between sensorimotor and cognitive slowing, that these processes are unrelated and are differentially influenced by antipsychotic medication. Thirdly the symptom of stereotypy will be observed, using a newly designed computerized Stereotypy Test Apparatus (STA). Differences are described between stereotypy and perseveration during the course of the illness. Differential effects are found on STA performances between atypical antipsychotics and conventional neuroleptics. Finally it is proposed that the domain ''Processing Speed'' in the MATRICS-initiative has to be delineated from psychomotor slowing in order to properly assess cognitive functioning in schizophrenia. Furthermore, psychomotor slowing and stereotypy seem to have different characteristics than the established cognitive deficits in schizophrenia: they seem to be associated with positive symptoms, they tend to increase in later stages of the illness, and are unaffected or even tend to worsen by treatment with conventional neuroleptics.",

Dept. of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Georg August University, Goettingen, Germany Modern neuroimaging techniques make it possible to determine brain structural and functional characteristics in schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. In part, these characteristics may serve as intermediate phenotypes, i.e. biological markers, which may help to clarify genetic and other pathophysiological factors that are involved in the pathogenesis of psychoses. In this talk, recent findings from studies using structural and functional MRI will be presented. First, the potential neuregulin-1 risk haplotype HAP ICE appears to be associated with low hippocampal volume and, in this way, may contribute to the vulnerability for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Second, genetic polymorphisms of serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission seem to differentially affect neurofunctional subsystems of working memory, which are considered to represent promising endophenotypes both in schizophrenia and in bipolar affective disorder. Third, both neurocognitive and neuro-physiological parameters acquired during specific testing of working memory performance may provide important information for differential diagnosis between different types of psychoses. Finally, there is evidence that brain imaging may also help to predict clinical outcome, treatment response and the potential for relapse after treatment. In conclusion, neuroimaging contributes to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, and may allow more individual and effective treatment planning in the future. Pharmacotherapy is the keystone of treatment for mental conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. Prediction of both efficiency and adverse drug effects of antipsychotic and antidepressants would help to reduce prolonged hospitalization and therapeutic failures, and improve compliance and long term prognosis of those severe and frequent disorders. Pharmacogenetic studies are ongoing since twenty years, trying to improve this prediction. They mainly focused on clinical improvement for antidepressant response. For antipsychotics, side-effects as tardive dyskinesia and weight gain and clinical improvement have been assessed in pharmacogenetic studies. Current knowledge on genetic prediction of general response and drug-induced side effects will be reviewed and then the key issues that need to be taken into consideration in designing and interpreting pharmacogenetic studies of psychotropic drugs will be discussed.",

In the elderly and as patients age, psychotropic use and pharmacological treatment becomes more complicated due to an increased risk of adverse drug events. These risks are associated with age-related physiological changes and individual variability in drug metabolism related to several factors, the most frequent of which is polymedication as a result of coexisting chronic illnesses. Comedications induce drug interactions that depend on the patient's metabolic capacity linked to the genetically determined cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP450) function. In the elderly the most frequent is polymedication as a result of coexisting chronic illnesses. The potential use of pharmacogenetics in children and elderly psychopharmacology will be discussed. To give an overview of the special situation of child and adolescent psychopharmacology in Europe. Modern psychopharmacology started with the use of stimulants for treating children with disruptive behaviors in the 30 th of the last century. All further development like the introduction of neuroleptics or antidepressants had been based on experiences in adult patients and often data on children and adolescents are lacking. At the moment, we still have a high proportion of so called off label use (using medication approved for adults but non approved in that age group) in child and adolescent psychiatry in Europe. Based on international comparisons for the main substance classes marked differences in prescription rates between the US and Europe will be demonstrated. Local trends like prescription of herbal compounds in Germany will be described (Fegert et al., 2006) . The new EU regulation (K\u00f6lch et al., 2007) will increase the number of GCP conform studies in psychopharmacological medication in children. Anyhow some IRFs very important to everyday practice like the combination of psychosocial interventions and medication are only studied in publicly founded NIMH sponsored trials like the MTA study, TADS etc. (Vitiello et al., 2004) . Our increasing knowledge on developmental neurogenesis in the brain and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences from adults should lead us to a more careful evaluation of psychotropic medications in children. The debate on potential harm of SSRIs, suicidality and related warnings of the FDA and European regulatory agencies makes clear that we need more age specific data on new medications and a well organized post marketing surveillance for all psychotropic substances used in children and adolescents. A therapeutic drug monitoring multicenter network including serum level measurements as well as standardized documentation of drug efficacy and drug safety could be one of the first solutions to that problem (Gerlach et al., 2007) . EEG mapping studies in untreated depressed patients as compared with normal controls demonstrated a decrease in absolute power in all frequency bands, an augmentation of relative delta/theta and beta and a decrease in alpha activity as well as a slowing of the delta/ theta centroid and an acceleration of the alpha and beta centroid, reflecting a decrease in vigilance.",

Contrarily, citalopram increased P300 source strength in the left prefrontal cortex and precuneus, reaching to the posterior cingulate.

At the beginning, PTSD research was primarily focused on war veterans and victims of bodily assault or rape. Starting in the early 90s, PTSD after civilian traumas such as motor vehicle accidents was diagnosed increasingly more often. Recent publications showed that PTSD can also follow serious somatic diseases. A Survey is given on published studies exploring the incidence of posttraumatic disorders after severe medical states and associated treatment modalities. Awareness during anaesthesia, prolonged ICU treatment (ARDS, septic shock), burns, and successful resuscitation after cardiac arrest, coronary artery bypass surgery, organ transplantation and cancer were all linked to the development of PTSD. Prevalence of PTSD in these medical conditions lies around 5-10%, and it is therefore considered an important comorbidity. Unfortunately, diagnosis and treatment of PTSD are not well enough established yet and thus do receive too little attention in the treatment regime of somatic illness.",

Lately brain imaging techniques using different radio ligands have been used successfully and replaced simple blood-flow measurements which could not yield a difference between different diseases. Although interesting findings have been obtained in depression, anxiety disorders as well as in schizophrenia and dementia, there is still a lack of data to identify characteristic and discriminative characteristics between these disorders. This is partly due to the nature of the studies since each receptor system necessitates individual measurements. The serotonin transporter has been studied most intensively and lower values have been obtained in depressed patients in hypothalamic regions. For example, anxiety disorders have been studied with respect to the 5HT1A receptor and again a lower activity has been found in these disorders. Interestingly higher 5HT1A receptor findings have been obtained in schizophrenia in specific limbic areas. Future aspects of neuroimaging monoaminergic function include not only a standardised methodology with regard to the timing of the measurements in the circadian rhythm but also taking into account the seasonal variations as well as the menstrual cycle. Furthermore, the combination with genetic data seems to be important because monoaminergic function has been shown to be under control of genetic influences, e.g. the serotonin transporter polymorphism. Neuroimaging of monoaminergic function is right now a research tool but hopefully will be available in the future also for diagnostic and specifically therapeutic purposes to find the right type of therapy. Ethical implications of ECT in adolescents are analyzed in the light of general medical ethics, which include five prominent principles: respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-nuisance, justice, and cautiousness. As adults, adolescents with acute psychotic impairment raise an inherent conflict between the respect for the patient's autonomy on one side, and the principle of beneficence on the other. However, this age group presents particular dilemmas: (i) As any adolescent suffering from a psychiatric illness is a highly vulnerable subject, society asks for particular attention. The consequence of potential overprotection is that the adolescent may remain untreated because of unrealistic fears regarding ECT. (ii) Some of these fears are linked to the cognitive secondary effects of ECT. Although preliminary data are reassuring, more empirical research on this population should be encouraged as only one follow-up study is available. (iii) Cautiousness recommends the use of ECT in limited indications: catatonia, mood disorders, and intractable acute psychotic disorders. In these indications, efficacy is reached in 80% (50 to 100 %) of the cases according to 9 recent studies that included 211 adolescent ECT treatments. This debate should also include patients' and families' experiences and views on ECT. Two independent groups recently showed that most adolescents patients who were given ECT, and their parents, had overall positive views on the treatment. They both considered ECT as a helpful treatment. Despite some frequent memory impairment, many of them will accept this therapy again if necessary.",

            "text": "Conclusion: We conclude that ethical options in clinical practice must be evaluated empirically with respect for the consequences on the patient. There is no ethical reason to ban the use of ECT in adolescents. Dogmatic views should be set aside. Epidemiological data show that the prevalence of depression in old age is high, is often underdiagnosed and undertreated, has a high rate of recurrence and is associated with significantly increased mortality. Because the prevalence of suicidal ideation is also relatively high in the old age, effective suicide prevention is especially needed for this age group. In addition, older patients experience more and longer major depressive episodes together with increased general medical comorbidities. Considerable comorbidity exists with dementia, stroke and Parkinson's disease, where patients often suffer from depressive symptoms. The response to antidepressant treatment in the elderly apparently does not differ from treatment response in younger patients. However, relapse rates are higher, and the longitudinal outcome is less favorable than for middle age. The more adverse longitudinal course in old age may more plausibly be explained by medical comorbidity, immobility and psychosocial factors than by age itself. It is also generally accepted that elderly depressed patients are particularly prone to the side effects of antidepressants, particularly cardiovascular side effects and treatment-related cognitive dysfunction. ECT has been shown excellent clinical effectiveness in geriatric patients. Despite specific side effects such as greater cognitive impairment, efficacy is greater in older than in younger patients. Recent improvements in the use of ECT include methods to maintain good therapeutic efficacy together with better tolerability concerning cognitive disturbances. Modified ECT techniques, including unilateral and bifrontal brief pulse wave stimulation and anesthesia with muscle relaxation substantially further enhance safety and tolerability. A reduced mortality in comparison to other treatments has been shown. Therefore to date on the long term no absolute medical contrain-dications to the use of modified ECT in geriatric patients, particularly in patients at specific medical risks, are encouraged. All potential benefits and risks have to be estimated on an individual basis. In the case of specific risks, interdisciplinary counseling may be necessary. Potentially higher somatic risks must be compared with the risk of insufficiently treated or prolonged psychiatric illness to optimize treatments especially in the old age. The chart analysis of more than 5000 electroconvulsive treatments confirms a good efficacy and tolerability especially in the group of older patients. Significant shorter treatment intervals until sufficient treatment response and remission could be observed especially in the group of patients older than 60 years. Efficacy, tolerability and safety data will be presented and discussed. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a safe and effective treatment for severe mood and psychotic disorders. When discontinued, however, without post-ECT treatment high relapse rates are seen within the first 4 to 6 months (Sackeim et al., 2001) . Psychopharmacologic treatment after an ECT-course is recommended to decrease relapse rates. A number of patients, however, are refractory to psychopharmacologic treatment. In these cases, maintenance ECT can be of help. In recent randomised controlled trial, a fixed number of maintenance ECT sessions was as effective as the combination of lithium and nortriptyline (Kellner et al., 2006) . Unfortunately, other randomised trials are virtually lacking. These are urgently needed, so as to provide the necessary evidence for maintenance ECT to gain its proper position in 'evidence based' treatment guidelines. ",

We used fMRI and visual alcohol-associated and control cues in 1) a block design and 2) a single-event design to assess brain activation in altogether 22 detoxified alcoholics and control subjects. Furthermore, we examined dopamine synthesis rate, D2 receptor availability and mu-opiate receptor availability in alcoholics. Patients were followed for three months and alcohol intake was recorded. In detoxified alcoholics, alcohol craving was associated with decreased dopamine synthesis rates and D2 receptor availability and increased mu-opiate receptor availability in the ventral and central striatum. In the fMRI study with a block design, alcohol-related versus neutral visual stimuli activated the putamen, anterior cingulate and adjacent medial prefrontal cortex in alcoholics compared with healthy controls. Increased functional activation to alcohol cues in the medial prefrontal cortex correlated with decreased D2 receptor availability in the ventral striatum. A multiple regression analysis showed that in alcoholics, the amount of subsequent alcohol intake was associated with the intensity of cueinduced brain activation but not the severity of alcohol craving, amount of previous alcohol intake or duration of abstinence before scanning. In the single-event design, brain activation elicited by positive stimuli in the frontal cortex and ventral striatum of alcoholics was negatively correlated with the prospective relapse risk. These studies show that 1) alcohol craving is modulated by dopamine dysfunction and elevated mu-opiate receptors in the ventral striatum, 2) the degree of brain activation elicited by alcohol pictures presented in a block design in the anterior cingulate, medial prefrontal cortex and striatum was associated with the prospective relapse risk, and that 2) high brain activation elicited by emotionally positive cues was correlated with a low risk of relapse.",

Within a neuro-cognitive framework addiction can be conceptualized as a dual-process pathology. On the one hand different neuro-cognitive functions and dimensions are being identified that are reflective of an increase in salience attribution regarding substance use and related cues. These cognitive dimensions include attention processes, which play an important role on an implicit, unconscious level. Changes in these cognitive processes develop in the course of addiction and drive cue-reactivity, craving and ultimately relapse. On the other hand, and recently in the centre of addiction research, is the involvement of cognitive self-control mechanisms in the pathogeneses of addictive processes. These so-called higher order cognitive functions operate on a more explicit, conscious level and deficits in their functionality seem to be one of the most robust findings in addiction research, replicated within a variety of different addicted populations. Specifically, these cognitive dimensions that reflect selfcontrol within an ecological, real life context such as decision-making are proposed to be a neuro-cognitive hallmark of addiction. Importantly, impairments in self-control have been related with a poorer course as reflected by treatment dropout and relapse.",

First it is debatable whether deficits in self-control are specific to addictive processes or whether they represent a more global deficit underlying different disinhibitory pathologies. Second, it remains to be explored whether these deficits represent a vulnerability factor predating the development of an addiction or if they are a consequence of the (neurotoxicity) chronic substance use. Within the context of this presentation both questions will be discussed. Previous attempts to identify predictors for the treatment response in alcoholism have mainly concentrated on social and personality variables. Project MATCH was such an attempt which finally failed. The same holds true for similar attempts in pharmacotherapy. Therefore, we set out for a large oligocentre trial ''Project PREDICT' '. 432 patients are randomly assigned to treatment with acamprosate, naltrexone or placebo. At baseline patients are assessed with a battery of interviews, questionnaires and biological examinations (e.g. genetics). Specific emphasis is put on patients' individual pathways into relapse. It is determined whether relapse drinking represented a positive reinforcer (''reward craving'') or a negative reinforcer (''relief craving''). This is assessed with questionnaires, the startle reflex and fMRI. We hypothesize, that patients who are a priori identified as ''positive reinforcers'' better respond to naltrexone.",

The MPFC may also be implicated in the onset and maintenance of low mood and in the increase vulnerability to develop a depressive episode in response to stressors. Emotions do not only serve to assign a particular value to objects or events forming the content of consciousness, but can directly influence perception and thus shape the content of consciousness and action. Functional neuroimaging studies in humans reveal neural mechanisms by which sensory and motor processes can be modulated by the affective significance of stimuli, and act in parallel to mechanisms of attention that are under conscious control. For instance, perception may be biased towards fearful relative to neutral faces, or towards angry relative to neutral voices, with enhanced activation of sensory brain regions involved in processing the corresponding stimuli (i.e., within visual or auditory cortex, respectively). Such enhancement in processing emotionally significant stimuli seems to depend on modulatory feedback influences from limbic brain areas such as the amygdala, which project directly to sensory cortical areas, and operate partly outside awareness. Amygdala activity can also influence motor output systems and thus contribute to attentional mechanisms underlying the interruption of current motor plans in the presence of threat signals. However, such activity in amygdala and other emotional brain areas may vary as a function of various individual factors, including anxiety and personality traits.",

Rostock University, Dept. of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Rostock, Germany Individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) are characterized by emotional instability with intense, rapidly rising emotions. They have been described as highly vigilant for social stimuli, especially for social cues that signal social threat or rejection and social situations have been shown to be potent triggers for emotional arousal and affective instability in BPD. Neurobiological data suggest that affective instability is associated with structural and neurofunctional abnormalities in the amygdala and its prefrontal interconnections, particularly the orbitofrontal and the anterior cingulate cortex, representing automatic and intentional aspects of emotion regulation. Affect dysregulation interacts with cognitive functioning prominently in two domains. On the one hand, inhibitory capacities, processed in the prefrontal cortex, have been shown to be restricted when emotional distractors have to be suppressed for the benefit of goal-directed behavior. On the other hand, increasing data suggest that emotional hyperreactivity interferes with the cognitive evaluation of social stimuli, e.g. facial emotion recognition, thereby leading to a specific pattern of altered emotion recognition in BPD. Behavioral and neuroimaging data is presented followed by the discussion of clinical implications and suggestions for future research. Introduction: Decoding emotional messages from faces is critical for survival and adaptation to our social environment.

The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system dysfunction is the most characteristic biological alteration found in a large proportion of severely depressed patients. The HPA axis is hyperactive and baseline cortisol levels are usually elevated, with alteration of the hormone secretion pattern. Accumulating evidence suggests that the combined dexamethasone (DEX)/corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) test is highly sensitive to detect HPA system abnormalities in depressed patients. In one study, we evaluated whether the DEX/CRH test has a predictive value for the risk of depressive relapse in outpatients who are in clinical remission from a major depressive episode. Thirty-eight depressed outpatients (23 women, 15 men) in remission (MADRS score \u00a3 8) underwent the DEX/CRH test and were followed for 12 months regarding the occurrence of a new depressive episode.

These results will be discussed in light of other recent clinical and preclinical studies. In elderly patients who suffer from depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment the clinical decision between the diagnoses of depression and dementia may be difficult. In addition, patients with dementia and depressed patients frequently show a disturbance of sleep. Sleep EEG registration in depression revealed a characteristic sleep EEG profile concerning distinct alterations of sleep architecture and REM-sleep (reduction of SWS, increase and advance of REM-sleep). In dementia polysomnographic assessment has been done less intensively, mainly in patients with dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT). The most significant polysomnographic finding in DAT is a reduction of REM-sleep, which may reflect impaired cholinergic neurotransmission. Therefore, predominantly REM-sleep variables clearly differ between depressed patients and patients with DAT. In this presentation polysomnographic data in dementia and depression will be reviewed. In addition, own long term studies in patients with different types of dementia and in depressed patients will be presented. The polysomnographic findings of these studies will be discussed with respect to differential diagnosis, prediction of treatment response and the long term course of both diseases.

Our findings suggest the suitability of investigating vulnerability marker in combination with a SNP based whole genome approach in complex disorders like depression. Three guidelines have been published on depression: Acute and continuation treatment of major depressive disorder 1 ; Maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder and treatment of chronic depressive disorders and subthreshold depressions 2 ; Treatment of unipolar depressive disorders in primary care 3 . WFSBP guidelines are developed by special WFSBP task forces which include members of the WFSBP as well as non-WFSBP colleagues seen as international experts in the relevant field. The task forces are composed with the aim to include knowledge and experience in the guidelines from every part of the world, not only the western hemisphere. The evidence criteria used in the preparation of these guidelines are adapted from the Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) treatment recommendations. The core characteristic of these evidence criteria is that meta-analyses are not seen as the most important factors for a high grade of evidence, but the results of well-designed studies. This approach is closer to the decision process of the most important regulatory authorities such as the FDA or the EMEA/CPMP. The WFSBP guidelines on the biological treatment of major depression will be presented and discussed. The shift from normal affective behavior to affective dysfunctions is transient. Affective symptoms characterize most of the important psychiatric disorders, and as a consequence lack nosological specificity. They are nevertheless of high clinical significance and thus, knowledge of the neurobiological basis of the affective symptoms is of high importance in our quest for achieving better therapeutic accessibility. The amygdala, an essential key structure in the cerebral limbic network, is supposed to execute an evaluative associative function, combining external cues with internal responses thereby assessing and defining the valence, relevance and significance of stimuli. It is its extensive connectivity with various cortical and subcortical areas that enables fast automatic but also more conscious deliberate responses. As such it is also the focus of interest in our studies of the pathophysiological mechanisms of emotional impairments in psychiatric disorders. The direction research in this area has to take is to improve quality management, to obtain more detailed information about the neurobiological correlates of psychiatric diseases, to use new opportunities these improvements give not only to evaluate therapeutic intervention but to implement new therapeutic approaches. This may lead to a more detailed characterization of affective dysfunctions with the aim to improve diagnoses as well as therapy in patients.",

Although emotion dysregulation is not an essential feature, DSM-IV mentions possible 'associated descriptive features' such as low frustration tolerance, temper outbursts, mood lability and dysphoria. A competing diagnostic approach like the Wender Utah criteria for the diagnosis of ADHD in adults gives more importance to symptoms of emotion dysregulation. Besides a retrospective childhood diagnosis and ongoing difficulties with both inattentiveness and hyperactivity, a diagnosis of ADHD can be made in the presence of at least two of five other additional symptoms, among others: 'affective lability', 'hot temper, explosive short-lived outbursts' and 'emotional overreactivity'. Recently the British Association for Psychopharmacology published evidencebased guidelines for the management of ADHD in adolescents and in adults. They present an extended checklist of adult symptoms including 'irritability, impatience or frustration' and 'affective lability or hot temper'. According to different contemporary authors mood instability is extremely common in adult ADHD and can lead to diagnosis of minor affective disorders or personality disorders. However, this issue is controversial. According to McGhough and Barkley: ''permitting symptoms of irritability and hot temper to qualify one for the disorder creates an automatic confound of ADHD with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and possibly the dysphoric form of bipolar disorder. Likewise, the inclusion of symptoms of mood lability without further clarification may further confound the delineation of this disorder from other mood disorders in adulthood''. In daily clinical practice we are thus confronted with differential diagnostic problems leading to different treatment options, in particular pharmacotherapy. In adults with ADHD, randomized-controlled trials with atomoxetine and methylphenidate OROS\u00d2 have shown that symptoms of emotion dysregulation show a treatment response similar to other (core) ADHD symptoms. However, in case of a bipolar spectrum disorder these medications seem not without risk of inducing mania.",

In addition, recently, a highly selective noradrenergic re-uptake inhibitor (Atomoxetine) has become available for the treatment of ADHD, which also effectively reduces symptomatology. The wealth of data supporting the short-term efficacy and safety of these drugs in the treatment of children is contrasted by a dearth of data on long-term effects of psychopharmacological treatment on structural and functional brain development. Rodent studies suggest that stimulants may persistently alter the dopaminergic system with long-term effects that extend beyond termination of treatment.",

Center for Psychiatric Neuroscience, Dept. of Psychiatry, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland Recent theoretical and empirical research on schizophrenia converges on the notion that core aspects of the pathophysiology of the disorder may arise from a disconnection syndrome that causes impaired communication between and within specialized brain areas. Moreover, converging evidence speak in favor of an abnormal susceptibility to oxidative stress in schizophrenia. A decreased level of glutathione (GSH), the principal non-protein antioxidant and redox regulator, was observed both in cerebrospinal-fluid and prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia patients. Moreover, patients have an abnormal GSH synthesis most likely of genetic origin: Two independent case-control studies showed a significant association between schizophrenia and a GAG trinucleotide repeat (TNR) polymorphism in the GSH key synthesizing enzyme glutamate-cysteine-ligase (GCL) catalytic subunit (GCLC) gene. The most common TNR genotype 7/7 was more frequent in controls, whereas the rarest TNR genotype 8/8 was three times more frequent in patients. The disease-associated genotypes correlated with a decrease in GCLC protein expression, GCL activity and GSH content. These results suggest that GSH synthesis dysfunction represent a vulnerability factor in schizophrenia. Such a redox dysregulation during development could underlie the structural and functional anomalies in connectivity: In experimental models, GSH deficit induces anomalies similar to those observed in patients. (a) Morphology: decrease in normal spines in prefrontal pyramids and in GABA-parvalbumine but not of -calretinine immunoreactivity in anterior cingulate (b) Physiology: impairment of NMDA-dependant synaptic plasticity and of dopamine modulation of NMDA-induced Ca 2+ response. (c) Cognition: deficit in olfactory integration and in object recognition.",

This functional defect could represent a neural basis for impaired social interaction and communication in schizophrenic patients. Psychopathological phenomena may be related to disturbances of physiological brain circuits, like motor circuits for psychomotor disturbances or language loop for language related pathophysiological phenomena like auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH). Modern neuroimaging techniques like functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Electrical Source Imaging are technologies that are well suited to be used in the undertaking of understanding psychopathological phenomena e.g. in schizophrenia from a patho-physiological perspective. We have investigated the psychopathological phenomena of AVH in schizophrenic patients using fMRI, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), spontaneous and stimulus related electrical brain activity with the aim to understand why patients are so convinced about the external sources of their sensations and which brain structures are involved in the their generation. Hallucinating patients demonstrated partly a variable increase of blood flow, depending on the clinical picture and all of them showed an increase in the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe during hallucinations in a fMRI investigation.",

            "text": "During the hallucinations an increase of faster frequencies of the spontaneous EEG could be observed in the superior temporal lobe, faster EEG frequencies are commonly associated with increased mental processing. Additionally auditory evoked potentials suggested a reduced amplitude of the component N100, which is thought to be generated in areas in and around primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe. DTI results, which depict the integrity of white matter connections in the brain, suggested an abnormally high neuronal coherence in the most important fibre tract connecting frontal and temporal speech areas (temporal section of the left arcuate fascicle). In summary these results indicate an increased activity of the early auditory cortices during hallucinations (contrary to findings demonstrated in healthy subjects during inner speech), which could be one mechanism responsible for patients conviction that their hallucinations are generated externally. Furthermore the results suggest that these pathophysiological mechanisms may be due to neurodevelopmental disturbances in language related physiological brain circuits. Besides the problem of drug-resistant depression, over the last decade the view has become increasingly widespread that achieving remission is just as important as response 1 . Follow-up data show very clearly that non-remitters have a much higher risk of relapse/recurrence or even chronicity than remitters. The problems of under-diagnosis and under-treatment of depression also need to be addressed. It is hoped that new mechanisms of action can overcome the limitations of traditional antidepressant medications. Unfortunately, some of the recent developments that raised the most interest either turned out to be less effective than hoped, such as the substance P antagonists, or did not yet lead to a drug likely to be marketed in the near future, such as CRF antagonists. On the other hand, the first melatonergic antidepressant, agomelatine, is a successful new development. Agomelatine is a melatonergic MT 1 and MT 2 receptor agonist with 5-HT 2C receptor antagonistic properties, and has shown antidepressant efficacy and favourable tolerability in several clinical trials in patients with major depression. Beside depression, anxiety disorders are one of the most common mental illnesses. Although anxiety disorders are treatable, less than 30% of sufferers seek treatment.",

Drug treatments include benzodiazepines, 5-HT 1A partial agonists, tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) 2 .

In comparison to the benzodiazepines, the principal advantage of these drugs is that they have no risk of dependency. Drug development is evolving fast and is aided by improved brain imaging techniques, better animal models, and an increased knowledge of genetic markers. This should result in a change in the pharmacotherapy of depression, anxiety and psychiatric diseases in general, if not in the short term then certainly in the next 50 years.

The problem is that several bacterial agents may be involved appearing as mixed infections. There is a gap of understanding of the role of hearths, though such infections are frequent. There is some impression, that repeated reactivations may increase the risk of psychiatric disease presumably from an increasing prevalence of autoimmune mechanisms (eg. epitopespreading).

Introduction: Many neuro-psychiatric diseases are characterized by a significant peripheral enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS have a microbicidal action since the host defence function through high ROS-concentration has a direct toxic effect on bacteria. On the other hand low ROS-concentrations stimulate cell proliferation through activation of redox-sensitive intracellular signalling mechanism. The intracellular mechanisms on metabolic activity and the interaction with ROS have not been sufficiently studied.",

The practice of evidence-based medicine makes it necessary for the DSM classification system to re-examine if Major Depression has got objective physical signs occurring with some consistency and should these be included among the diagnostic criteria. In Major depression one may observe retardation of movements and diminished gestures and expressions. There is often a combined sense of inner restlessness, of unquiet brooding. The patient may appear tired, self-concerned, bored, and inattentive and display a loss of interest in the surroundings. Anxiety is a conspicuous and an integral element of affective state and may be expressed by severe restlessness and agitation. Anxiety can be so profound that the diagnosis of depression can be a matter of speculation only. Muscle tension, wringing of hands, weeping and moaning, repeating over and over in a monotonous and stereotyped way phrases expressive of misery are all important clinical signs of Major depression. Similarly tachycardia, dry tongue/mouth, sweaty palms and/or bodily extremities, cold clammy skin, pallor, pupillary dilatation, tremor, and the fluctuations in blood pres-sure with wide pulse pressure are all important that give away the underlying distress.",

This could also explain a large placebo response and a narrow therapeutic response in recent randomised controlled clinical trial. Furthermore, since in most such clinical trials HDRS was used to measure the therapeutic response it may be considered that the use of HDRS was not in accordance with the diagnostic practice that HDRS proposes to follow. Hence it is possible that in recent years a truncated use of the HDRS has occurred in research on Major depression. This view requires a further examination. Bagby et al draw the inference that HDRS is flawed and has become lead weight as it only partly relates to the operationalization of depression in DSM-IV. The reverse should be the case. The onus should be on the DSM classification system to revise the diagnosis of Major depression and to include the physical signs. This would also help exclude depressions with unstable pathologies, day to day and homeostatic upsets. Introduction: Impulsivity is being recognized as a core feature of bipolar disorder, as much as a state as a trait. Although very few studies have focused on this relationship, it has been suggested that exploring its neurobiology could help to elucidate the pathophysiology of this illness. Impulsivity and aggression have been considered key factors in suicide attempts, and together with sensation seeking it appears strongly linked to substance abuse which, in turn, may increase impulsivity, facilitating comorbidity.",

Nevertheless, many cancer survivors experience positive growth as they adjust to changes brought about by their illness. In particular, religious and spiritual faith provides patients diagnosed with cancer with important tools for coping with their illness and should be recognized by diagnosing physicians. Future research should refine current screening procedures and develop interventions to better address either PTSD or posttraumatic growth in cancer survivors.",

Introduction: Social phobia is an anxiety disorder defined by excessive fear reactions that are triggered by social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. In social phobia, gaze aversion could be a central component of the etiology of social phobia and most of the cognitive and behavioral therapy programs take into account this into account. The emotions of the people around a social phobic person seem to model this gaze aversion.

Introduction: Suicidal behaviour and impulsive aggressive behaviour towards others probably share a dysfunction in the brain serotonergic system.

Dysfunctional emotion processing might be a serotonin-mediated commonality predisposing to suicidal or aggressive behaviour. During the last years, several studies have demonstrated that electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythms are modulated during cognitive processing. Those results have allowed proposing that simultaneous theta-(3-7 Hz), alpha- (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) , beta-(14-30 Hz) and gamma-(30-70 Hz) frequency band oscillations are required for unified cognitive operations. Specifically, alpha-amplitude modulations have been recently associated to attentional processes and consciousness. Despite those evidences, the temporal relation of EEG oscillations with attention mechanisms has not been well studied. Moreover, although it has been reported that spontaneous alpha oscillations are associated to the parieto-occipital cortex, it remains unknown which areas are associated to the attention-dependent alpha activity. We present the results of an EEG study where human subjects had to perform a spatial attention task. This task has demonstrated its ability to reflect the attentional modulation on the activation of early visual areas such as V1, V2, V3 and V4. Specifically, checkerboards are presented either to the left or to the right visual hemi-field while the attention is directed either to the right or to the left. Subject's task is to detect a very small change in the color of the checkerboard in the attended hemi-field. Analysis of the data includes spectral analysis using Morlet wavelets in order to determine both the evoked and the induced oscillations involved in the process.",

Other patients have to be included to confirm this results. ASL imagery technique appears to be an appropriate method for investigating functional abnormalities in psychiatric disorders. (Premack and Woodruff 1978) . Recently, neural correlates of mentalizing have been investigated by means of the classical Prisoners' Dilemma Game (PDG). Therefore, participants were scanned using fMRI while playing against alleged human or computer opponents (Kircher et al. submitted, Krach et al. submitted, Rilling et al. 2004 ). The results show that subjects attribute greater intentions and thoughts to a human opponent rather than to a computer implicated by stronger activations of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, what exactly manifests the observed differences in mentalizing and their neural correlates remains unclear. We hypothesise that the degree of anthropomorphism and embodiment of the game partner will modulate cortical activity in previously detected ToM networks as the mPFC/ACC. Here we present the results of an fMRI study where participants had to play a classical PDG against four opponents with a stepwise increase in anthropomorphism and embodiment: a laptop computer partner (CP), a functional robot designed with two Lego Mindstorm sets (FR), the anthropomorphic robot BARTHOC Jr. (AR) and a human partner (HP). The results document a widespread overlap of activation in the mPFC irrespective of the partner being played. Directly contrasting the conditions revealed a significantly stronger signal change during the humanhuman interaction opposed to all other game partners. However, both types of robots elicited stronger activity in the medial frontal cortex than the computer partner. In conclusion, the present study is the first to apply functional neuroimaging methods to study human-robot interaction on a higher cognitive level such as ToM. The results of our studies are expected to have a severe impact on the design of social robots and the understanding of the functioning of ToM. Specifically in the group of autistic patients -characterized by an impaired ToM ability on humans, but exhibit a preference of robotic compared to human partners in an initial interaction (Dautenhahn et al. 2002 ) -the question of whether mentalizing might be facilitated when engaging with robotic agents is of major interest for psychiatry research. Introduction: Binding is essential for associating parsed information into coherent representations. Troubles of such a process could lead to deleterious combinations or thought disorganization in schizophrenia. It has been demonstrated that binding is disturbed in episodic memory (Danion et al., 1999; Luck et al., submitted) , due to prefrontal and hippocampal dysfunctions (Lepage et al., 2006) . However, little is actually known about binding in working memory and its pathophysiological basis. Aim: We used an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approach to study the neural basis of the binding process in a working memory task.",

The disconnectivity hypothesis proposes that schizophrenia results from poor anatomical connections. Theoretically, its functional counterpart should be disintegration. Integration is thought to allow segregated neurons to interact as a coherent whole. This can be assessed by functional connectivity between pairs of regions. But new algorithms also allow to assess integration at the whole brain level. Areas of coherent activity form an integrated ''core''. The noninteracting part is referred to as the ''rest''. We used two fMRI studies of 13 stabilized medicated schizophrenic subjects compared to 11 matched controls. Subjects performed a lexical decision task in the first part and retrieval task in the second. Then we select a completely different imaging modality to study 6 patients and 6 matched controls with MEG. Participants were required to perform a verb generation task on semantic indices. Cores did not differ from the rests, neither in terms of anatomical distribution nor of functional integration. However, the cores were badly isolated from the rests and the rests were overly integrated in schizophrenic subjects. Furthermore, within the cores, anterior-posterior correlations were defective in patients (e.g. between the frontal and the parietal cortices) whereas frontal left-right correlations were excessive. Correlation was absent when considering medication but was significant for negative symptoms. Results were replicated in both fMRI studies and in the MEG study. Thus, it appears that schizophrenia entails a deleterious combination of too much ''noisy'' integration (into the rest) but also too little ''significant'' integration (defective anterior-posterior functional connectivity).",

The aim of this study is to explore the binding potential (BP) of 5-HT1 A by the 18F-MPPF in unmedicated subjects with severe acute depression.

We handle only 4 dimensions and need models like Weygandt's T-A-M-model for ''bipolarity'' for understanding. Kathleen Askland 2006 proposed the bipolar spectrum to be due to the interaction of alterations of neurochemical capacity (!range) and neuroelectrical modulation (!tonicity) driven by genes for transmitter systems and ion-channels respectively. Using a 3Dmodel derived from Kraepelin (1913) it is argued that neurochemical capacity ''corresponds'' to the T-axis (representing 4-D-''Thought''-knowing that) and neuroelectrical modulation to the A-axis (summarizing higher-dimensional ''Action''-knowing how i.e. psychomotricity). 1 ",

It clarifies Kraepelin's cryptic illustration '' Fig.228'' showing two of six possible phaselagged T-A-M-sinus curves. These were borrowed from electrical RCL-circuits, which behave like spring-pendula. 2 . The cyclical T-A-M-model: a loop is inserted into the CUBE, which is made out of an approach wave closed to form a perception-action-cycle (quietness! need! appetitive planning ''Thought''! ecologic encounter by ''Action''! consumption!\u2026). This cycle, when tilted, can generate the above sinus curves. It is attracted by the cubes corners (mixed states, anxiety disorders, basic emotions). 3 . The model predicts that psychomotoric systems (A) express ''tonicity'' and are more influenced by changing ion channels and vice versa that symbolic search systems (T) express ''range'' and are more influenced by changing main transmitters. Tonicity and range of ''Mood'' seem less illuminating. 4 . Deformed loops depict temperaments. Cholerics use quick frugal models (T) for ongoing affairs: their loop rapidly leads to ''Action'' or ANGER. As a spring-pendulum they have a weak ''T''-spring; sanguines with a stiff ''T''spring search for truthful, but too slow models. ANGER-FEAR (Lara 2006 ) is a skewed dimension in the T-A-plane. 5 . A graphical synopsis of these models and present evidence is shown. Friedel E., Schlagenhauf F., Park S.Y., Kahnt T., Wrase J., Str\u00f6hle A., Heinz A. Dept. of Psychiatry, Charit\u00e9 Hospital, Berlin, Germany Fear and anxiety depend on amygdala function. A functional polymorphism of the human serotonin transporter gene (SCL6A4) has been associated with amygdala activation by emotionally salient faces, anxiety as well as mood disorder in healthy controls. Several studies showed that SCL6A4 genotype accounted for about 30% of the total variance in amygdala response during the presentation of aversive but not affectively positive visual stimuli, which were equally salient. S-allele carriers also showed stronger prefrontalamygdala connectivity.",

Nauczyciel C., Hellier P., Drapier D., Millet B. Affiliation Universit\u00e9 Rennes 1, France Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a non invasive, painless new technique in the treatment of depression. Metaanalysis showed that it was more efficient than placebo and its efficacy enhanced with the knowledge of stimulation parameters. However, the target zone, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is still located using an inaccurate standard method (SM) which might have therapeutic consequences. We needed to determinate and assess the different sources of inaccuracy of the SM before assessing therapeutic consequences. In a methodological study, we determined 3 sources of inaccuracy of the SM: cap repositioning, interjudge variability of coil positioning and distance between real and standard DLPFC. We used a neuronavigation system allowing us to locate accurately DLPFC on subject's brain and to record the coordinates of any point targeted. A healthy volunteer and 9 depressed unipolar patients were recruited: -Cap repositioning: 30 records of 1 point on the prefrontal cortex of the subject's brain after 30 cap repositioning by a trained clinician; Interjudge variability of the coil positioning, -10 records of the standard DLPFC by 10 trained clinicians, -Interindividual anatomic variability: distance between real and standard DLPFC for each subject. The methodological study showed that cap positioning was reliable with a standard deviation < 5mm in the 3 axis. The interjudge variability was important with a standard deviation > 5 mm in 2 of the 3 axis. Interindividual anatomic variability was congruent with the previous study: 50% of the patients had a distance higher than 20mm and 33% of the patients were correctly targeted. The main sources of error of the SM were the interindividual anatomic and the interjudge variability whereas cap repositioning was reliable. The neuronavigation system allowed us to correct these errors and to make reproducible studies to assess the therapeutic impact of an accurate stimulation of the DLPFC in the treatment of depression using rTMS.",

Environment. and Human Sciences, Nagoya, Japan Introduction: Recently, the number of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases has increased, raising the important issue of dysfunction of higher brain functions after the onset of cerebral infarction. Cilostazol, an antiplatelet agent used to treat cerebral infarction, inhibits platelet aggregation, increasing cerebral blood flow. Therefore, it may be effective for cerebrovascular dementia (Watanabe et al., 2006) . However, it is suggested that the apoptosis of nerves, cerebral ischemia-related inflammatory response, and oxidative stress are involved in the mechanism of cognition disorder following cerebral infarction.",

            "text": "Standardized Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (sLORETA) is a widely used technique for source localization. However, this technique still has some limitations, especially under realistic noisy conditions and in the case of deep sources. To overcome these problems, we present here swLORETA, an improved version of sLORETA, obtained by incorporating a singular value decomposition based lead ) eld weighting. We show that the precision of the source localization can further be improved by tomographic phase synchronization analysis based on swLORETA. Phase synchronization analysis turns out to be superior to standard linear coherence analysis, since the latter cannot distinguish between real phase locking and signal mixing. It has been proposed that, in schizophrenia, basic cognitive impairments like masking represent a vulnerability factor originating disorders in more complex cognitive functions. However, how such impairments relate with each other remains to be unravelled. Here we propose to explore the ability to distinguish events in time, basing our approach both on phenomenological issues that relate time with consciousness and on an experimental approach allowing to evaluate judgments of simultaneity in patients. The choice of this paradigm is motivated by the fact that performance is independent from a memory, persistence or bias effect. It thus allows to isolate a time component more easily than duration evaluation or masking. Two bars are displayed on a computer screen, and participants judge whether they are simultaneous or not. Simultaneity judgments are contrasted with the effects of subthreshold priming, which influences simultaneity judgments. Nineteen outpatients and their individually matched controls, participated in the study. Patients showed higher thresholds than controls in all tests. This contrasted with subthreshold priming effects, which were uniform across groups and allow to eliminate an effect of bias. Subjective evaluation of simultaneity is impaired in patients. Whatever the origin of this impairment it may have a large impact on cognitive functions, inasmuch the normal consciousness flow requires the integration of successive moments, past, present and future. The present results suggest that these 'moments' are enlarged in patients. The method used in the present study represents an original way to asses disturbances related to time in patients with schizophrenia. Processing visual information involves automatic grouping processes and top-down attentional processes that help to reorganize information. Many studies have now suggested that grouping in vision is impaired in patients with schizophrenia, but without distinguishing between automatic and top-down processes. We used a paradigm derived from Beck and Palmer (JEP, 2002) in 30 patients with schizophrenia and 30 matched controls. Subjects decided whether series of stimuli with geometrical features included, or not, two consecutive identical stimuli. The manipulation of proximity defined pairs of two figures. Patients, like controls, benefited from grouping by proximity: they were faster and more accurate when the two identical stimuli belonged to the same group than to different groups of figures. However patients had difficulties reorganizing information. Reorganization of information was explored by means of three experimental blocks that were defined by the percent of target-present trials where the targets belonged to the same pair (within-group trials) or to different pairs (between-group trials): 25-75%, 50-50%; 75-25%. Recordings of ocular movements and behavioural data showed that healthy volunteers control the exploration of between-group regions independently from within-group regions. Hence healthy volunteers were able to prioritize selectively objects even if they were part of different groups. Patients were able to prioritize pairs of objects defined by proximity when targets belonged more frequently to the same pair. This shows that they take into account the experimental manipulations as well as controls. However, they were unable to prioritize objects that were part of different groups selectively. The results suggest that healthy volunteers create a representation involving pairs of figures that belong to different groups. Such representations help to focus on group parts without fragmenting information. Patients with schizophrenia appear to be impaired in the building of such representations, which might severely impact on the way they explore and adapt to a complex environment. Purpose: Recent research on RBC membrane in patients with schizophrenia showed a significant increase in the percentage of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) on the external membrane leaflet. Increase in the external PE percentage was found in 2/3 of a schizophrenia population (n=65). Age, sex and antipsychotic treatment were not associated with this PE abnormality. This result could be associated with the membrane lipid modifications described in the patient with schizophrenia population, showing in particular a total membrane PE and PC decrease along with a compensatory PS increase. Membrane abnormal PE distribution is under scrutiny as it seems to be a stable trait associated with the disease or some of its endophenotypic characteristics. Both bipolar disorder (BP) and schizophrenia (SCZ) are multi factorial diseases likely to share common biological predispositions. A recent publication studying the sPLA2 activity, an enzyme involved in membrane modelling and known to be increased in serum of schizophrenia patients, showed an increased activity only in bipolar patients with a history of psychosis. It suggests a possible association between PL metabolism and endophenotypic psychotic manifestations (Ross et al., 2006) . We wanted to address the question whether the PE membrane biomarker described in patients with schizophrenia could also exist in a subgroup of bipolar patients in particular those with a history of psychosis. In order to address the first point, a membrane PE distribution analysis was performed on RBC membranes from patients suffering from bipolar I disorder.",

Current models suggest that these structures are also implicated in cognitive and emotional processing (Alexander 1980; Parent 1986) . Although the exact nature of the processing of motor, cognitive and emotional modalities in the basal ganglia is still unknown, several observations from high frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) and neuroimaging suggest that the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a basal ganglia nucleus which is part of the striato-pallidonigral pathways, operates some kind of integration of motor, emotional and cognitive information (Mallet 2007) .",

Introduction: The term of Theory of Mind (ToM) has been coined in reference to the capacity of inferring mental states (1) . A conceptual approach, Relational Frame Theory (RFT), has tried to investigate perspective-taking skills, a capacity to adopt someone different points of view among temporal, spatial and interpersonal dimensions. According to RFT, perspective-taking skills are needed to infer others' mental states (2) . Patients with schizophrenia show difficulties in inferring mental states (3) . This impairment could be involved in delusion of persecution (4) and in disorganized thought (5) . Schizotypy, a personality disorder with proneness to schizophrenia, shares characteristics with this illness on several dimensions (6) . Impairments in ToM have also been observed in this population (7) . RFT view has never been tested neither in schizotypy nor in schizophrenia.",

Contrary to the international guidelines, we clearly see an increase in the atypical antipsychotics association without a decrease of the use of typical antipsychotics, and with a risk of adverse drug reactions. Financial loads are worsened by growing dosages and by associations of expensive drugs. Introduction: There is a growing body of evidence that oxidative stress, caused by reactive oxygen species, plays a substantial role in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders.

EDDH, Nancy, France In March 2000, the Lisbon Council defined the development of the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world as a strategic goal. Pharmaceutical innovation and clinical research add a significant value to this development, both in public and private health sectors. However, the European Commission noted in 2001 in a report analysing the competitiveness in European Pharmaceuticals that: ''Europe is lagging behind the USA in its ability to generate, organise and sustain innovative processes that are increasingly expensive and organisationally complex''. Since new and innovative medicines should be available to European patients as quickly as possible, this flaw in the EU treatment development has become not only an industrial problem, but a major politic concern. One of the identified structural Achilles 'heels provoking the erosion of clinical research in Europe is that research and development in EU is hindered by fragmented research systems and a lack of coherent and integrated approach between public and private sectors. In the same time, the United States of America have undoubtedly succeeded in co-ordinating public and private research, especially in clinical trials. Part of the reasons for its success relies in relative facility of cooperation between public and private institutions strengthened by the pragmatic action of the National Institutes of Health. In France as well as in many EU countries, public institutions have to jump over huge inconveniences in setting up and conducting clinical trials, and consecutively obtain poor competitiveness. In parallel, despite private groups of investigator are able to conduct large clinical trials in an efficient manner, they often lack studies for which they are available. However the French Government tries to create modern legislative framework and initiatives to ensure that public and private sectors will operate smoothly. The present presentation will examine these various initiatives like PHRC, Clinical Investigation Centres, foundations, contribution of private groups of investigators\u2026 in a European perspective.

Serotonin syndrome due to a single serotoninergic agent is a rare condition and there have only a couple of cases been reported up to date. We recommend that the physicians should know the diagnostic criteria of this syndrome and should have a lowered threshold to make the diagnosis. A 72-year-old patient with probable diffuse Lewy body disease (DLB) who developed a dropped head syndrome is presented. 1 Noticeable head flexion started after two days treatment with the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine which was initiated because of severe confusion, delusions and visual hallucinations. The patient could maximally lift her head 20 degrees. Painful neck rigidity was noticed, particularly in case of backward extension (video fragment 1). One week after olanzapine withdrawal, the patient's posture started to improve slightly (video fragment 2). From time to time, the patient was able to drink with nearly full neck extension, which was interpreted as being a sensory trigger. Repeated needle electromyography showed marked myopathic changes in dorsal paraspinal muscles and sustained contraction of the right splenius capitis muscle. Further improvement was achieved by starting a treatment with benserazide-levodopa. Because of peak-dose dyskinesias, entacapone was associated. Because of persisting severe delusions despite treatment with a maximal daily dose of rivastigmine, aripiprazole 10 mg was started. Four months later, a remarkable recovery of the head drop was noticed (video fragment 3). In conclusion, this is the first report of a case with dropped head syndrome in a patient with DLB. Dropped head syndrome has been reported in Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. 2, 3 Its underlying pathophysiology remains to be elucidated. Our clinical and electrophysiological observations suggest neck extensor myopathy due to axial rigidity or focal neck dystonia, induced by dopamine receptor blockade. This hypothesis is underbuilt by the fact that improvement was achieved after withdrawal of olanzapine and following the start of a treatment with levodopa. Due to its partial dopaminergic agonistic effects, treatment with aripiprazole might have had beneficial effects too.",

Indeed, the serotoninergic system has a crucial role in both depression and anxiety, but the implication of norepinephrine remains debated. On a clinical point of view, NRIs and SSRIs improve rates on the Hamilton scale as well as on the social adaptation and self-evaluation scale.

Even if this selectivity is high at the transporter site, reboxetine may activate the serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Thus, through inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake, reboxetine promote activation of a2-adrenergic receptors on those serotoninergic neurons, responsible for an increase in their firing rate and serotonergic release in the rat prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (1) . Accordingly, the functional response to NRIs should not be norepinephrine restrictive.",

These observations highlight the difficulty to predict the therapeutic profile of antidepressants on the sole basis of their presumed mechanism of action. Here we report a case of reported exposure to Baclofen toxicity and a subsequent withdrawal state. This occured in a 45 year old patient suffering from progressive spastic quadriparesis of unknown origin, on oral Baclofen, with no previous psychiatric diagnosis, who following elective insertion of an intrathecal Baclofen pump (ITB) went from a comatose state to a fulminant psychotic episode. During the planned elective intrathecal surgical insertion of the Baclofen pump, the patient was inadvertently given a twenty times higher than usual daily dose as a result of which she became progressively drowsy and unresponsive (GCS 3). The pump was promptly stopped and within 24 hours she regained consciousness but developed vivid visual, auditory and tactile hallucinations. She was found to experience intensive feelings of derealisation and depersonalisation and appeared to have developed a complex paranoid delusional system. On assessment she also reported Schneiderian first rank symptoms but interestingly, otherwise appeared cognitively intact, fully orientated throughout and with retained attention. A withdrawal reaction was diagnosed and Baclofen reintroduced. Although the patient's mental state improved following the reestablishment of Baclofen, the elaborate delusional ideation and feelings of depersonalisation continued prompting introduction of Risperidone 1 mg nocte. Over the following days further improvement was noted and eventually Risperidone was stopped. Once discharged, the patient was followed in the psychiatric outpatient clinic where she continued to report some altered perceptions but no psychotic symptoms during the next few months. In conclusion, ITB therapy is increasingly used to treat medically intractable spasticity. There needs to be a greater awareness of the dangers of Baclofen toxicity and withdrawal including its neuropsychiatric effects. Of interest, Baclofen is a well known GABA B receptor agonist. In recent studies of rodent models activation of GABA B receptors with Baclofen it was reported to reverse sensory gating deficits (1), a known endophenotype of psychosis. The pathophysiology of the effect of Baclofen in humans in producing psychotic symptoms during withdrawal states, such as were present in our patient, is as of yet unclear but warrants further investigation. Introduction: Women have a higher prevalence of major depressive disorders (MDD) than men. However, there is an ongoing controversy about whether men and women respond equally well to antidepressant medications. Some studies suggested that allelic variation of the serotonin transporter genelinked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR: long (L) or short (S)) could influence emotions in males and females in opposite directions. L allele has also been associated with higher antidepressant response but some replications found contradictory results. We assessed the potential role of Gender x Genotype interactions to explain these conflicting results.",

It depends on the treatment, the patient, the patient's environment, the physician and the illness. In schizophrenia, a low level of insight (i.e., awareness of the disorder) is thought to weaken compliance, but the link is not well-established. Our aim was to study the relations between compliance, insight and therapeutic alliance in a population of patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, and to identify clinical and sociodemographic risk factors responsible for poor compliance. We used the self-scored MARS (Medication Adherence Rating Scale) to measure compliance, the SUMD (Scale to assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder) to measure insight, and a specific self-questionnaire to measure therapeutic alliance. Our results confirm that low insight and a weak therapeutic alliance are correlated to poor compliance. The gravity of the illness, the severity of the overall disability and addictive disorders are also liable to weaken compliance.",

To assess the influence on performance of self versus external pacing, each trial was constituted of a 12s period of synchronisation followed by a 24s period of continuation. Results: These preliminary results suggest that schizophrenia is characterised by a timing deficit. Time intervals are shortened, hence, patients accelerate and this is especially observed when subjects are to act upon an internal representation of the rhythm to produce (i.e. during continuation).

Body dissatisfaction is commonplace for teenage girls and is associated with dieting and unhealthy weightcontrol behaviours. The idealisation and pursuit of thinness are seen as the main drivers of body dissatisfaction, with the media prominent in setting thin body ideals. Multiple impulsive behaviours are common in adolescent's eating disorders, and multiimpulsive patients appear to do more poorly in treatment.

Introduction: Lateralisation investigation evaluates the efficiency of connective fibres describing the advantage of one brain hemisphere over the other. The result of this is the description of the lateralisation index as the indicator of cognitive skill, covering the range of -100 for the total advantage of the right hemisphere to 100 for the left hemisphere. Despite the fact that the physiological pattern was confirmed a long time ago (1, 2) , it is still an intriguing fact whether lateralisation potential correlates with other indicators. It is well known that this indicator is not constant. It is different in left and right hand individuals, it may also undergo certain modifications; it changes, for example, in musicians (3) or in sleep deprived individuals (4) . Certain changes are also quite probable to take place with age, expressing diminishing of the intellectual potential.",

Dept. of Psychiatry, CHU Nancy, France Tobacco use is a major public health problem in Europe. Both prevalence and types of tobacco use vary from one country to another according to Tobacco Control policies. In France the 1 st February 2007 decree set out the Government's strategy for tackling smoking in France. Tobacco free areas were installed in all public zones including hospitals. Cigarette smoking is more frequent among psychiatric patients with a smoking prevalence among those with schizophrenia 2 to 3 times higher than in the general population. If quitting smoking for these patients is more difficult, in contrary to a common view, these patients are as motivated to quit smoking and try to quit as often as non-psychiatric smokers. Their greater difficulty in quitting smoking is, as least in part, due to their higher level of tobacco addiction, and to their lower confidence in their ability to quit smoking. Until recently, most physicians considered a smoking cessation as almost impossible for these patients. Consequently, these patients experience earlier smoking related morbidity and mortality. Indeed, ischemic heart disease is the first cause of death among patients with schizophrenia, and this high rate of smoking, results in a 20 % reduction of their life expectancy. In respect to patients with schizophrenia, the usual smoking cessation programmes (nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, varenicline \u2026) may not be efficient and appropriate. Specific smoking cessation programs have been developed but most of the evaluated programs included only younger non deficient subjects. To our knowledge no study has evaluated smoking cessation in older patients with chronic deficient schizophrenia. In this case report, we will describe the smoking cessation in a 57 year old man with chronic deficient schizophrenia, kleptomania and nicotine depen-dence. It will be shown that cigarette smoking should not be considered ''as normal'' for patients with deficient schizophrenia. Encouraging them to quit smoking, treating them, and supporting their efforts, should be almost ''mandatory''. For smokers unable or unwilling to quit, harm reduction can be proposed as an alternative.",

They show less willingness and are less involved in the maintenance program. They have to stick longer to it and their observance is weaker. Alcohol misuse is the main cause for their increased mortality ad morbidity rate. Several reasons for alcoholic relapse have been identified among alcohol addicts, such as alexithymia for a start; 40,8% of drug addicts seem to be suffering from that ''difficulty to identify one's feelings and to tell them from physical sensations''. Besides, self-esteem may be weaker in alcoholics and drug addicts than in sample population. Eventually, several studies on temperament have underlined the connection between some emotions or features of temper -such as selfdirectedness-and alcohol dependence.

But with regard of the construct definition or its measurement, the discussion remains open. The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) is extensively used worldwide in psychiatry and psychology research. Unlike the original concept of a one-dimensional construct, it proposes a three-subtrait structure of impulsiveness (namely cognitive, motor and non planning) that has been operationalised in recent versions of this instrument. The difficulties in different studies to clearly identify cognitive impulsiveness subtrait originally conceptualized lead to a new label as an antinational factor. The BIS is a 30item self-report instrument with overlapping items and items with weak intercorrelations. The aim of the study was to validate a short form of the BIS-11 with as few as 5 items for each substraits.",

It is usually seen in schizophrenia or dementia; however some organic etiologies such as B12 deficiency, migraine, hashimoto thyroiditis, drugs (adrenaline, atropine methonitrate, morphine) and AIDS related pneumocystis pneumonia were identified.",

The severity of the delusional misidentification decreased and the patient gained insight towards his condition during the 30 day clinical follow up at the hospital. The psychiatric examination revealed a complete remission of the CS on discharge. The final diagnosis was delusional disorder (axis I) and B12 deficiency (axis III).

Siblings have repeatedly been found to have intermediary values called vulnerability markers (e.g. cognitive abnormalities). Thus, this abnormal intermediate DA response in siblings may be considered as a biological marker of vulnerability. This intermediate reaction could be explained by a serotonin over-activation in response to stress which could modulate a genetic abnormal DA reactivity. Thus, the serotonergic activity should be taking account in development of preventive strategies.

Dept. of Psychiatry, CHU Clermont Ferrand, France    Evaluation of anxiety in schizophrenia is important from a clinical, psychopathologic and therapeutic point of view, but reliable, standardized, and widely accepted specific tools are scarce and of difficult use. Therefore, we built-up a specific scale (EAS) to specifically evaluate anxiety in schizophrenic patients. This is a hetero-evaluated scale, since the capacity of perception and expression can be modified in schizophrenia, and the observer can take into account objective manifestations. Twentynine items were selected by combining items of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, (HAM-A), the Tyrer's brief scale for anxiety (BSA), Bobon's AMDP-AT anxiety scale and the Comprehensive Psychiatric Rating Scale (CPRS). A Likert-formatted questionnaire was independently revised by each investigator. The Delphi method was therefore used to further evaluate the pertinence, reliability and limitations of the questionnaire by an expert committee. A study designed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the EAS scale in 200 schizophrenic patients was already set up. Analysis of unidimensionality, internal consistence and item responses will allow an estimate of the precision and reliability of the EAS scale. Independent evaluation of each patient by 2 investigators will allow estimating inter-rater reliability. External validity will be estimated by analyzing correlations between the EAS scale and other reference scales: HAM-A, the Visual Analog Anxiety Scale and the anxiety/depression factors of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale of Schizophrenia (PANSS). The use of the EAS scale can facilitate diagnosis, follow up and treatment of anxiety in schizophrenia.SIMULTANEITY PERCEPTION DISENTANGLES DIFFERENT KINDS OF SCHIZOPHRENIC DISORDERSFoucher J.R., Lalanne L., Giersch A., Elliott M.A., Pham B.T.  ULP/ HUS/ INSERM, Psychiatry, Strasbourg, France    Although schizophrenia is generally approached as an entity, everybody acknowledge that it indeed corresponds to multiple diseases. Karl Leonhard once proposed to distinguish 35 diseases in what we currently define as the psychosis spectrum, based on their clinical picture and evolution. Twenty-four overlap with schizophrenia and/or schizo-affective disorders1  .These come together in three main families for which different therapeutic implications (e.g. neuroleptic response) together with different etiology (hereditary vs. ontological event, i.e. neurodevelopmental) were subsequently ascertained 2 :",

            "text": "Introduction: Cognitive deficits have been described in patients during major depressive episode. Several studies show that depressed people have difficulties in being specific in autobiographical memory. However, due to methodological and conceptual issues, little attention has been paid to episodic autobiographical memory in depression.Aim: The present study investigated the specificity of autobiographical memories among twenty-eight depressed patients; the relationship between autobiographical memory, depression and quality of life. Alternatively, we also evaluated the effect -on autobiographical memory -of antidepressant therapy ((clomipramine (150 mg / day) or venlafaxine (150 mg / day)) in acute depressed patients.Patients and Methods: During an episode of major depression and after remission (J0, J4, J32-46, J74) we investigate 28 patients compared with 28 normal volunteer controls. Among patients 14 patients were treated with clomipramine (150 mg/day) and 14 patients with venlafaxine (150 mg/day). Efficacy variables included the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D 21 ) total score, HAM-D 21 depressed mood item score, scores on the Montgomery \u00c5 sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scales, and rates of response (based on change from baseline HAM-D or MADRS score or CGI-I score). Quality of life was assessed with the Beth Israel/UCLA Functional Status Questionnaire (FSQ). We used neurocognitive tests (Della Salla autobiographical memory interview, the Dritschel's autobiographical fluency task, a free recall task, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, visual analogical scale, Semantic Verbal Fluency test) exploring attention, implicit, anterograde, retrograde memory and an autobiographical memory test.Results: Our preliminary findings confirm a negative effect of depression on autobiographical memory with a significant but incomplete improvement after remission. The effects and differences between clomipramine (150 mg / day) and venlafaxine (150 mg / day) will be presented and their implication in clinical practice will be discussed.Conclusion: Improvement in depression is associated with decrement of depressive symptoms but also with cognitive improvements. Our results will be presented and their implication in clinical practice will be discussed. Prospective studies are warranted to study the effects of potential differences among antidepressant therapies on long-term cognitive outcomes in depression. Modern biological psychiatry should probably also emphasize on the relevance of physical symptoms and signs during care management [1] . Psychiatric physicians probably face a new era where integrative medical practice will become the rule.",

Furthermore we asked for the degree of importance regarding physical examination and whether the present situation should change. The results were stratified and correlations with sex, age and main activity (stationary/in-patients or ambulatory/out-patients) were carried out.Results: We report the preliminary results of 105 responders (response rate 42%, mean age 43.7 years, 63 males). 36.2% used their stethoscope and 22.9% performed standard neurological examination during clinical activity of the last 7 days. 20% reported that a physical symptom or sign changed their diagnostic or treatment attitude during the last day.Psychiatrists treating mostly in-patients performed more physical examinations but there was no significant difference between academic and non-academic hospitals. Younger male psychiatrists tend to perform more often physical examination than any other group.Nevertheless the majority of all interviewed psychiatric physicians attributed a high degree of importance to physical health in their patients and agreed that the actual situation regarding the positioning and the management of physical health in daily psychiatric practice should change or improve.Conclusion: The topic whether psychiatrists should somewhat get physically closer to their patients from time to time is always hotly debated since the beginnings of our speciality as a whole [2, 3] . It is striking that despite recent efforts in several countries to improve the skills of psychiatrists in this area of clinical practice, the literature reporting the actual state of the art is extremely rare and poor [1] [2] [3] .Financial Support: Daniel Neu is supported by a research grant from the National Funding for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Research, Culture and Superior Education of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg. Introduction: Informing patients on their medicines is a patient right. What does current information provision on antidepressants to patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital look like? What is the current practice of health care professionals? What are the experiences of patients?",

            "text": "Aim: This study aims to explore current practice on drug information provision on antidepressants in psychiatric hospitals from the point of view of health care professionals as well as patients with a depression.Patients and Methods: A qualitative study in eight Flemish psychiatric hospitals consisting of semi-structured interviews with separate interview guides for health care professionals and for patients. Interviews were tape recorded, verbatim transcribed and analyzed using NVivo7.Results: Interviews with 9 patients and 34 health care professionals were performed and analyzed.Patients get information on antidepressants, firstly, through psychiatrists and, secondly, through nurses. Hospital pharmacists have a supporting role.The approach in giving information depends on patient characteristics and his/her mental state. Information is provided mainly orally. Leaflets are not frequently distributed. Patients also get information on antidepressants during psycho-educational sessions. On request, patients can read a package insert under supervision of a health care professional.Health care professionals pay attention to non-verbal cues of patients to verify if information has been understood. Information is repeated when the first instruction was not clear for patients. Patients as well as health care professionals are satisfied with current practice on information provision. Health care professionals reported lack of time and lack of interdisciplinary contacts as negative aspects. Patients indicated that health care professionals take too little initiative to give information about medicines. Positive aspects reported by health care professionals are the hospitals' openness and the opportunity for patients to ask questions to psychiatrists as well as nurses. Suggestions for improving practice are: providing more medication information to patients, in particular on side-effects; enhancing the availability of easy readable information; and organizing continuing education for nurses on medicines.Conclusion: Patients are informed about their antidepressants through various pathways.",
