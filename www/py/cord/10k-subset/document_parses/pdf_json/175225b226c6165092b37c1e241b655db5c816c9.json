The most prominent threat to their survival is habitat destruction/fragmentation from both logging and agricultural activities. The second most serious threat relates to the development of roads associated with logging. Such roads allow access and transport to and from remote areas, and provide an infrastructure for the commercial bush meat industry. Disease is usually considered the third most serious threat, and has risen in public awareness due to the highly publicized outbreaks of Ebola virus in western Africa that resulted in high mortality in chimpanzees and gorillas [Morell, 1995] . In protected areas (i.e., conservation areas and national parks) where deforestation and bush meat practices are a lesser threat, disease is rated as the primary threat.",

            "text": "In 1997 the Population Habitat Viability Assessment conducted by the Conservation Breeding Specialist Group (CBSG) in Uganda designated disease introduction as a major risk to the sustainability of the two populations of mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei) in the protected areas of the Virunga Massif and Bwindi Impenetrable Forest [Werikhe et al., 1997] . These parks have sharp boundaries between the forest and the human communities, with few existing buffer zones. The human communities around the mountain gorilla parks have a density of 423-538 people per square kilometer (2002 Rwanda Census) and a population growth rate of approximately 3.7% per year [Butynski, 2001] . The mountain gorilla populations have the highest percentage of humanhabituated individuals of any ape species and are subjected to intense research and ecotourism programs. These factors, which are compounded by agricultural practices at the boundaries of the park, promote contact between gorillas and humans and domestic animals, and thus increase the potential for the introduction and transmission of infectious diseases. Health care within the human and domestic animal populations around the parks is less than optimal and there is poor sanitation. Research has shown through genetic sequencing that the same enteric organisms (Giardia, Microsporidea, and Cryptosporidea) are circulating among humans, cattle, and gorillas in and around the park [Nizeyi et al., 1999 [Nizeyi et al., , 2000 [Nizeyi et al., , 2002 . The prevalence of antibiotic resistance to Enterococcus and E. coli in mountain gorillas has been found to be higher than expected for wild populations of animals, and has a pattern similar to that of human and cattle antibiotic resistance in the Bwindi area (Byarugaba, unpublished data). Gorillas share a 498% genetic similarity with humans [Hacia, 2001] and are susceptible to many human diseases, as well as zoonotic diseases associated with livestock.",

Although an outbreak may be defined by a single case, the term often implies that several individuals are affected. Important considerations in the investigation of an outbreak of infectious disease includes determining that an outbreak is in fact occurring and defining the extent of the population at risk. Given that data gaps in knowledge of the baseline prevalence of clinical signs and diseases in the mountain gorilla exist, outbreak assessment may initially prove to be the most challenging task. In the past, the identification of an outbreak was based on the collective experience and subjective judgment of the park manager and veterinarians. Currently, outbreaks are defined on the basis of past clinical observations and the new data being amassed by IMPACT TM , and the veterinarians and park managers can confirm or override the program at any point. One benefit of this system is that IMPACT TM records and updates the prevalence rates of clinical parameters and signs both spatially and temporally as it monitors for health. This was one of the faults of previous nonuniform health data collection methods, which frequently recorded data only from unhealthy animals.",

Non-outbreak assessments usually deal with individual welfare issues. If the prevalence of abnormal clinical signs is higher than expected, as we see in Table IV , the scenario would be assessed as an outbreak (see Fig. 1 , level 4). Outbreak risk assessment would more likely involve population welfare. Risk assessment is the process of estimating the implications of a disease/ hazard introduction, and results in a final estimation or characterization of the risk. Risk assessment is a logical process by which risks are evaluated based on available scientific information. This standardized format for risk assessment supports veterinarians in making evidence-based decisions in the field. It also provides organization to vital communication efforts among field personnel, the park authority, veterinarians, and other NGO stakeholders. In order for the process to work and to ensure transparency, both the assumptions made and the factors that contribute to certainty in estimates of risk must be fully elucidated and documented.",

Therefore, the assessment is primarily qualitative in nature. Although qualitative risk assessment is not as desirable as quantitative assessment, it has been recognized as a valid tool by the World Trade Organization, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, and the Organization of International Epizootics. This decision tree must function in the stochastic world of veterinary medicine in a field situation. Therefore, it must deviate from decision mechanisms used in human medicine. These deviations include dependency on observed clinical signs rather than verbal communication for patient assessment, the risk and difficulties of performing routine physical exams on gorillas, and the need, in the majority of cases, to anesthetize the animal for sample collection and treatment. Available human diagnostic tests may or may not be validated for gorillas, and thus have questionable diagnostic value. Although the risk-assessment decision-tree process is initiated by qualitative data, quantitative data should also be collected for confirmation or to reduce uncertainty in the characterization of risk. Over time, IMPACT TM will acquire the quantitative data needed to help make the decisions objective.",

This paper presents two methods by which outbreak risk can be assessed. The first method, disease diagnosis, is derived from clinical signs or diagnostic test results (see Table V for examples). The categories of low, medium, and high risk are derived from data on morbidity and mortality rates from human medicine, experience with nonhuman primates in captivity, and limited disease experience in wild ape populations. Table V updates occur as new information becomes available. The second method, which is used for cases in which a definitive diagnosis cannot be made, incorporates a combination of clinical signs, postmortem examination results, and estimated transmission and mortality rates (Table VI) . Data are analyzed by the IMPACT TM system and placed into risk categories and implementation strategies that are then confirmed by veterinarians. The risk categories were compiled from past experiences by a team of experienced field and captive primate veterinarians, as well as veterinary and human epidemiologists. Table VI is dynamic and will constantly be updated as IMPACT TM incorporates its own data into the decision tree.",

Clinical signs are characterized by the likelihood that they are infectious or noninfectious, as well as the likely route of introduction. If the signs are human-induced and life-threatening, and treatment is beneficial and practical, immediate intervention is warranted. If the situation is non-human-induced, whether infectious or noninfectious, then the following decision-making criteria are utilized: assistance is necessary, consultation other experts, such as epidemiologists and Geographical Information System (GIS) experts, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization should be utilized. Table IV shows a scenario with a higher-than-normal prevalence of abnormal clinical signs, and Table VI shows a medium-risk outbreak situation in which the rate of transmission is high (Z1 new case/day) but the mortality rate is low (no mortality observed). One of the deficiencies of previous health data collection systems is that normally only data from unhealthy animals were recorded. One benefit of IMPACT TM is that it constantly incorporates new data, including those from normal, healthy individuals, and adjusts baseline prevalence rates accordingly.

Clinical respiratory outbreaks are common and usually pose the greatest risk to infants. In the past, even if an infant died with respiratory signs and other gorillas were showing similar signs, the dead infant would be left until the mother dropped it. This eliminated the possibility of performing a diagnostic postmortem examination. Now, if an infant dies with suspicious signs of infectious disease and/or other animals are showing signs of clinical illness, the mother is anesthetized, examined, sampled, and sometimes treated, while the dead infant is recovered for a thorough postmortem examination.

They are generally strong enough to break these snares free from their grounding, but are usually left with ropes or wires attached to their limbs. This is one example of a non-outbreak situation because it usually only involves one animal and there is no potential for the problem to be transmitted to other gorillas. The fact that snares are human-induced and often life-threatening calls for immediate intervention.",
