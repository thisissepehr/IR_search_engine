However, the structural features of the complete PSV genome remain largely unknown. To analyze the structural features of PSV genomes, the full-length nucleotide sequences of three Korean PSV strains were determined and analyzed using bioinformatic techniques in comparison with other known PSV strains. The Korean PSV genomes ranged from 7,542 to 7,566 nucleotides excluding the 39 poly(A) tail, and showed the typical picornavirus genome organization; 59untranslated region (UTR)-L. Three distinct cis-active RNA elements, the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 59UTR, a cis-replication element (CRE) in the 2C coding region and 39UTR were identified and their structures were predicted. Interestingly, the structural features of the CRE and 39UTR were different between PSV strains.

The genomic RNA of picornaviruses harbor several distinct cis-active RNA elements which are required for viral RNA replication; an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 59UTR, a cis-replication element (CRE) within the ORF [3] [4] [5] [6] or the 59 UTR [7] , the 39 UTR, and the 39 poly(A) tail [3] .

In a previous report [12] , PSV strain V13 was predicted to include three stem-loop structures in the region of the 39UTR using nine nucleotides of the terminal part of the 3D coding region. In the present study, the Korean viruses KS04105, KS05151 and KS055217 plus the Chinese YC2011 strain each appear to have these 3 stem-loop structures (X, Y and Z), but the csh strain showed only two stem-loop structures (X and Y) since the sequence was shorter. The domain Z, in which the stop codon (UGA) is located, is the most conserved region of the 39UTR within PSVs, whereas domains Y and X were considered more variable regions ( Figure 5B , 5C), as they show heterogeneity in both length and nucleotide sequence. The differences between the 5 different PSV strains and the csh strain appear attributable to an incomplete 39 terminal sequence for the csh 39 UTR region. Moreover, five strains, except for the strain csh, were predicted to have an intramolecular kissing RNA interaction between the X and Z domains. Due to the lack of 39 terminal sequence of csh 39 UTR region, no intramolecular kissing RNA interaction could be predicted (Fig. 5D) . Interestingly, the V13 strain showed intramolecular interaction of 7 nucleotides, but the three Korean and one Chinese strains had intramolecular interaction of 8 nucleotides. The 39 UTR plays an important role in picornavirus replication. Serial passage of mutant viruses in which such interactions were disrupted resulted in production of revertants in which the tertiary kissing interaction was restored, indicating the functional importance of the interaction in the enterovirus 39UTR [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] .
