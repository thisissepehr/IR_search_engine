It is endemic to certain parts of the world with intense transmission rates in sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia. The majority of imported cases are seen in travellers or migrants from malaria-endemic countries. 4 In Canada, there are 300-1,000 cases reported annually; however, it is estimated that only 50% of cases imported into Canada are reported to Health Canada. 5 There are five species of Plasmodium known to cause malaria in humans: falciparum, vivax, malariae, ovale, and the extremely rare knowlesi (which is found only in areas of South East Asia). Worldwide, falciparum malaria is the most common species seen in imported cases. Cases of severe malaria are caused almost exclusively by the falciparum species, making it responsible for the greatest degree of morbidity and mortality. 1, 6 People living in high-endemic areas can acquire a degree of immunity due to repeated exposure to Plasmodium falciparum. These individuals rarely become critically ill when infected and can tolerate the parasite without symptoms developing. 7 The exact mechanism of this immunity is unknown; however, it is rapidly lost if the individual moves away from the endemic area. 8 The malaria-immune naive traveller or individuals who have previously lived in the area (and consider themselves immune) are particularly at risk of developing severe malaria.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 282, "end": 283, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 440, "end": 441, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 868, "end": 870, "text": "1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 871, "end": 872, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1114, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1244, "end": 1245, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epidemiology"}, {"text": "Knowledge of the life cycle of the Plasmodium parasite helps explain some of the clinical manifestations and complications of the disease (Figure) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 138, "end": 146, "text": "(Figure)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Plasmodium life cycle"}, {"text": "Malaria parasites are spread by female Anopheles mosquitos that bite and inoculate their saliva, containing sporozoites, into the bloodstream of humans. Within a few hours, the sporozoites move to the liver, enter hepatocytes, and begin to divide. The sporozoites eventually form mature tissue schizonts which contain daughter merozoites (known as exoerythrocytic schizogony). After a period of incubation in the liver (5-15 days in falciparum malaria), schizonts rupture and release thousands of merozoites into the circulation which then enter erythrocytes. Asexual reproduction within erythrocytes (known as erythrocytic schizogony) eventually results in hemolysis of the red blood cells, releasing thousands more daughter merozoites into the bloodstream. This rupturing of erythrocytes and release of merozoites gives rise to clinical symptoms and promotes further erythrocyte infection, with each cycle of erythrocyte infection taking approximately 48 hr. Some merozoites differentiate into male and female gametocytes through a sexual erythrocytic stage, at which point, they become infectious to female Anopheles mosquitos that bite the infected human. Sexual reproduction of these gametocytes in the mosquito (sporogenic cycle) eventually leads to production of new sporozoites that move to the mosquito salivary glands ready to be injected into a new human host with the next bite. Malaria can also be transmitted in utero through blood transfusion, intravenous drug use, needlestick injury, and organ transplantation. [9] [10] [11] Pathophysiology Many of the effects of severe falciparum malaria on the various organ systems are a consequence of changes in the structure and function of parasitized erythrocytes. The very presence of the parasite in the erythrocyte reduces its cell membrane deformability and contributes to hemolysis by increasing the osmotic fragility of the red blood cell. The expression of certain membrane glycoproteins leads to adherence (i.e., increased ''stickiness'') of erythrocytes to the vascular endothelium (i.e., cytoadherence). This process, known as sequestration, results in the microvascular obstruction of capillaries and small venules of vital organs and occurs in the pulmonary, cerebral, cardiac, renal, and hepatic circulations. The infected erythrocytes can also stick to uninfected circulating red blood cells in a process known as rosetting, which further contributes to microvascular obstruction. 12 The pathogenic effects of malaria have also been attributed to parasitized erythrocytes promoting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. 13 These cytokines, e.g., tumour necrosis factor and interleukin-1, have multiple effects, including systemic inflammatory response (SIRS), fever, hyperdynamic circulation, and direct myocardial suppression. Inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase is also activated by the cytokines, leading to an increase in NO production as part of the SIRS response. Despite the increase in NO production, the sequestration and rosetting of red blood cells still results in microvascular occlusion. The cytokine hypothesis also suggests that release of these cytokines ultimately leads to death from severe malaria through direct mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired oxygen utilization. Thus, this process gives rise to functional cellular hypoxia rather than simply the effects of the vaso-occlusive phenomenon. [13] [14] [15] Diagnosis Malaria usually presents as an acute febrile illness ten to 15 days after inoculation with non-specific symptoms of headache, myalgia, fatigue, chills, fever, and vomiting. In falciparum malaria, deterioration can occur rapidly and result in multiple organ failure and death. The non-specific nature of both the presenting symptoms and the basic laboratory investigations used in patients with this symptom constellation may result in a missed diagnosis. Usually a high index of clinical suspicion is required for prompt diagnosis. Specific tests designed to look for malaria should be requested in individuals who had a risk of exposure in the preceding year or in those with a history of previous malaria infection. 16 Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films are the reference standard for diagnosis of malaria, where the asexual form of the parasite can be viewed microscopically within the erythrocytes. 17 Importantly, a single negative blood film does not exclude a diagnosis of malaria as there may be parasite sequestration deep within tissue capillaries which obscures visible parasitemia on the blood film. 18 If there is a high clinical suspicion of malaria, blood microscopy should be repeated at intervals of eight to 12 hr for up to 48 hr. 19 Characteristic morphological features of the erythrocyte and Plasmodium parasites viewed under microscopy help determine the malaria species. 20 Rapid diagnostic tests based on dipstick immunoassays for specific malaria antigens or enzymes are useful diagnostic adjuncts, particularly with a negative blood film or in the absence of expert microscopy. Nevertheless, these rapid diagnostic tests do not quantify the level of parasitemia, which is necessary in guiding appropriate treatment and response. 21 Once malaria is diagnosed, it is important to assess disease severity in order to initiate the appropriate treatment. This is generally based on species subtype, percentage of parasitized erythrocytes, and the degree of organ impairment. Empirical treatment should be initiated only if parasitological tests are inaccessible and there is a strong clinical suspicion of malaria infection. 22 Table 1 summarizes the World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of severe falciparum malaria. 23 It is important to exclude human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in any patient diagnosed with malaria as co-infection is common. The immunosuppression caused by HIV co-infection increases the degree of parasitemia and the severity of malaria and also reduces the efficacy of treatment. 24, 25 Treatment and drugs Treatment recommendations based on species subtype and severity of disease are provided by the WHO and are summarized in Table 2 . 23 Patients with a diagnosis of falciparum malaria should be admitted to hospital for at least 24 hr. Management in the critical care unit should be considered for those patients with clinical or laboratory features of severe malaria as deterioration can occur rapidly.

Respiratory failure can progress to acute lung injury (ALI) or adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the need for mechanical ventilation. The exact pathophysiology of developing ALI/ ARDS in malaria is not fully understood. It is thought to involve a combination of factors, including parasite sequestration in pulmonary capillaries and host immune responses, both of which can initiate direct lung damage and lead to thickening of alveolar septa, intra-alveolar hemorrhage, and pulmonary edema. A post-treatment inflammatory response can also persist and lead to an ALI/ARDS picture even when the parasite count is declining. 38 Preoperative assessment of respiratory function should include noninvasive pulse oximetry, arterial blood gas analysis, chest radiograph, and an assessment of the need for supplemental oxygen and postoperative critical care management. Mechanical ventilation can be challenging due to ventilation/perfusion mismatching and reduced lung compliance that occurs in the context of ALI/ARDS. As ALI/ARDS treatment trials are lacking in patients with malaria, recommendations for ventilation follow nonmalaria ARDS treatment guidelines. 38 A lung protective ventilation strategy is advised with the application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), limiting tidal volumes to 6 mL\u00c1kg -1 and plateau pressures to \\ 30 cm H 2 O. 39 In patients with concomitant cerebral malaria, achieving normocapnia is essential to prevent further rises in intracranial pressure (ICP) that could precipitate cerebral herniation. Lung protective strategies may have to be sacrificed to achieve normocapnia in the presence of raised ICP.

Post-mortem examination has shown evidence of microvascular obstruction in coronary capillaries caused by parasitized erythrocytes, leading to ischemic cardiomyopathy in some patients. 41 Severe malaria infection may also be associated with direct myocardial dysfunction. 42 Levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a sensitive marker of left ventricular dysfunction, have been shown to be elevated in patients presenting with severe malaria. 43 Parasite toxins, host immune mediators, metabolic acidosis, and decreased NO levels have all been implicated as causative for direct myocardial dysfunction. Conduction defects and nonspecific electrocardiogram abnormalities can occur, particularly in patients on quinine therapy. 44 Preoperative cardiac evaluations should include an electrocardiogram, transthoracic echocardiography, and laboratory biomarkers of cardiac dysfunction. When available, intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography and cardiac output monitoring should be considered to help guide appropriate inotropic and fluid therapy for the hypotensive patient and to distinguish between cardiogenic and distributive shock. There remains a degree of uncertainty about the optimal fluid management strategy in patients with severe malaria. Patients with malaria are particularly vulnerable to developing pulmonary edema from fluid overload, and there is a fine balance between keeping the patients underfilled, which may worsen perfusion and acidosis, and overfilled, which may precipitate pulmonary edema. In the absence of volume depletion or hypotension, patients with severe malaria should receive fluids conservatively. 19 It is generally advisable to keep the intravascular volume at the lowest level while still allowing adequate systemic perfusion; early inotropic support is preferable to excessive intravascular filling. 18 Nevertheless, the point at which inotropic agents should be commenced in patients with severe malaria is yet unknown. Since malaria can be associated with profound acidosis, if inotropic support is instituted, it may be preferable to avoid or limit the dose of epinephrine as this agent can increase lactate production and exacerbate acidosis. 45 Dopamine, dobutamine, or norepinephrine have been used in the treatment of severe malaria and are suitable alternatives.

It is diagnosed by confirmation of peripheral malaria parasitemia coupled with altered consciousness, in the absence of other causes of coma. 47 Cerebral symptoms are thought to be caused by obstruction of the cerebral microcirculation by parasitized erythrocytes. 48 Parasitic sequestration leads to a static blood flow, localized tissue hypoxia, acidosis, and inflammation, which results in venous congestion, raised ICP, altered consciousness, and convulsions. 49 Nevertheless, cerebral edema is not considered to be responsible for coma. 50 Cerebral autoregulation becomes disrupted in those with intracranial hypertension. 49 Seizures must be treated promptly with a benzodiazepine (e.g., midazolam or lorazepam), though prophylactic therapy is not recommended.
