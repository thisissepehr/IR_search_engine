In this paper, we systematically study how the recovery rate affects the susceptible-infected-removed spreading dynamics on complex networks, where synchronous and asynchronous updating processes are taken into account. We derive the theoretical effective epidemic threshold and final outbreak size based on the edge-based compartmental theory. To validate the proposed theoretical predictions, extensive numerical experiments are implemented by using asynchronous and synchronous updating methods. When asynchronous updating method is used in simulations, recovery rate does not affect the final state of spreading dynamics. But with synchronous updating, we find that the effective epidemic threshold decreases with recovery rate, and final outbreak size increases with recovery rate. A good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the numerical results are observed on both synthetic and real-world networks. Our results extend the existing theoretical studies and help us to understand the phase transition with arbitrary recovery rate. Published by AIP Publishing. [http://dx.",

The difference of recovery rate among real diseases and the accompanying effects on the human health have been well known, while the important role of recovery rate in the prediction of effective epidemic threshold has not been systematically studied. In this work, the effect of recovery rate on the effective threshold of epidemic outbreak is systematically studied. We first develop a novel theoretical framework based on the edge-based compartmental theory. The developed theory predicts that recovery rate does not affect the spreading dynamics with asynchronous updating, but with synchronous updating, the effective epidemic threshold decreases with the recovery rate, and the final outbreak sizes increase with the recovery rate for a given effective transmission rate. It should be noted that in asynchronous updating the networks are more resilient to spread the disease. To verify the accuracy of the theoretical predictions, we numerically predict the effective epidemic threshold using the variability measure on random regular networks, where the numerical results agree well with the theoretical predictions. Moreover, we investigate how the recovery rate affects the epidemic outbreaks with synchronous updating on scale-free networks and real-world networks and find the same variation trend of effective epidemic threshold. This work provides us a deep understanding of the effective epidemic threshold and would promote further studies on phase transition of epidemic dynamics.",

[1] [2] [3] Examples include the spreads of mumps, varicella, rabies, and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). 4 In the SIR model, an infected node can transmit a disease to each of its susceptible neighbors with infection rate b.

In this context, a critical value of the effective transmission rate k \u00bc b=l (or the effective epidemic threshold k c ) exists above which the final fraction of recovered nodes is finite. 5, 6 In previous studies, it is pointed out that the effective epidemic threshold decreases with the average connectivity hki under the assumption of homogeneous mixing. 4 Considering the heterogeneity of connectivity, the heterogeneous mean-field (HMF) theory 7-9 was employed to predict the effective epidemic threshold, which can be expressed as",

Here, we develop an edge-based compartmental theory [32] [33] [34] to derive the effective epidemic thresholds for the SIR model with arbitrary recovery rate, in both asynchronous and synchronous updating spreading processes. The proposed theory could be considered as supplementary to the existing theories, and it predicts that the effective epidemic threshold is independent of (decreases with) the recovery rate in asynchronous (synchronous) updating spreading processes. We further validate the theory based on extensive numerical simulations on synthetic and real-world networks. In most cases, our theoretical predictions are in a good agreement with the numerical effective epidemic thresholds identified by the variability measure, 35, 36 which has been confirmed to be effective for identifying the SIR effective epidemic threshold. 37 Although there exist some differences between the theoretical predictions and numerical results in networks with disassortative mixing, the theoretical effective epidemic threshold displays the same trend to that of the numerical effective epidemic threshold.",

Thus, we obtain a trivial conclusion: the effective epidemic threshold and final outbreak size is not affected by the recovery rate. According to the asynchronous updating method, the recovery probability p r and time interval Dt can be rewritten as N I \u00f0t\u00de=\u00bdN I \u00f0t\u00de \u00fe kE A \u00f0t\u00de and 1=l\u00bdN I \u00f0t\u00de \u00fe kE A \u00f0t\u00de. When the effective transmission rate k \u00bc b=l is fixed, the change of recovery rate l does not affect the recovery probability p r and infection probability 1 \u00c0 p r , while only alters the relative size of time scale Dt \u00bc 1=l\u00bdN I \u00f0t\u00de \u00fe kE A \u00f0t\u00de. Therefore, the recovery rate does not change the effective epidemic threshold and final outbreak size in the asynchronous updating spreading process. The developed theory can describe the phenomena very well.",

The theoretical predictions are very close to the simulated results for SFNs with c \u00bc 4:0, while there are some difference between them for SFNs with c \u00bc 2:5. This can be explained by the fact that for scale-free networks with small degree exponent c and large network size N, the strong degree heterogeneity leads to the result that the high degree vertices connect preferentially to low degree ones, and as a consequence, such networks show disassortative mixing. 41 The actual disassortative mixing pattern contradicts with the theoretical assumption that the network is uncorrelated, which results in the difference between the simulated result and the theoretical prediction. While for the networks with large degree exponent c \u00bc 4:0, the degree distributions are relatively homogeneous, thereby the edge-based compartmental theory could provide the relatively accurate predictions.",

For the case of asynchronous updating, the recovery rate only alters the time scale of SIR spreading dynamics but does not affect the phase transition and final state.

We numerically identified the effective epidemic threshold k c with the variability measure, which has been confirmed to be effective for identifying the SIR effective epidemic threshold, and found that k c indeed decreases with l for the case of synchronous updating. As the infection and recovery events may happen consecutively in the synchronous updating process, the mean infection ability of a single infected node is enlarged by large recovery rate. The results showed good agreements between the theoretical predictions and the simulated results on RRNs. To explore the university of these conclusions, we further carry on these studies on scale-free and real-world networks, where the similar phenomena were observed.

Moreover, there still exists a certain gap between the theoretical predictions and the simulated results for some disassortative networks, and thus the more accurate analytic approximation of the effective epidemic threshold (e.g., message-passing approach 21, 22 ) for SIR dynamics with arbitrary recovery rate remains an important problem.",
