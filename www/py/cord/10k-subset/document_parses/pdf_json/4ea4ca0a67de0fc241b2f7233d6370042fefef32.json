The RT-ABCDE strategy, a novel concept and an essential method, should be a routine strategy for disease control and prevention. It should be proposed and applied in both clinical and preventive medicine. KEY WORDS human disease, management, prevention, RT-ABCDE strategy After confirming the diagnosis of acute and chronic diseases, an effective therapeutic treatment will follow, which includes Western medicine and Chinese herbs [i.e., Danshen Drop Drills (\u4e39\u53c2\u6ef4\u4e38) and Artemisinin Qinhaosu], non-drug therapy, surgical operations or interventional therapy [i.e., anti-tumor therapy (including surgical resection, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or interventional embolism)], anti-hypertension treatment [for which seven core principles should be followed seven core principles (SeCP)] (23) , the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF, including six kinds of biomedical engineering therapy) (24) , reconstructive treatment [such as percutaneous intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, valve replacement, atrial or ventricular septal defect operation and microsurgery (such as re-attachment of amputated fingers)], destructive \u2022 149 \u2022 Chin J Integr Med 2008 June;14(2):147-150 Zhang SJ, Zhang H, Wei YJ, et al.

A general survey is also an examination regularity that covers a wider range of population and is usually conducted once every 3 to 5 years or even 10 years. Special examinations for females, such as breast and gynecological examinations may be helpful in finding common tumors early, including breast cancer and cervical cancer. Routine prenatal screening can effectively decrease the occurrence of congenital heart diseases (5) .

At present, along with the wide spread of lifestyle diseases such as tumors, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, obesity, gastrointestinal diseases, as well as four infectious diseases (tuberculosis, hepatitis B, AIDS and schistosomal disease) and allied health issues, it has become more urgent to use more effective strategies in controlling human diseases.",

Special biochemical indices such as brain natriuretic peptide(21, 22)  , carbohydrate antigens 125, C-reactive protein, cardiac troponin \u2160, carcinoembryonic antigen, alpha fetoprotein, cytokines, inflammatory mediators, the four markers for tumor diagnosis, the activity of drug metabolism enzymes (DME) and hereditary or genetic polymorphism all play an important role in diagnosing, prognosticating and preventing related diseases. The objectives of the clinical treatment are as follows: (1) to keep biochemical and physiologic indices within the normal range and to sustain homeostasis; (2) to correct the abnormal biochemical and physiological index, (3) and to achieve a clinical cure. In addition, as for the congenital or genetic indices, early lifestyle intervention may prevent or decrease the possibility of the expression of genetic diseases.Treatment Antagonistictherapy (such as radiofrequency catheter ablation, splenectomy, subtotal gastrectomy, total resection of the uterus, etc.), and anti-inflammatories, anti-clotting, anti-thrombin, anti-embolic, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and brain resuscitation (recently reverse CPR(25)), anti-oxidative stress, anti-apoptosis, anti-aging as well as psychological intervention(26)  . Therapeutictreatment, as the major measure for the treatment of human diseases, should be given as early as possible. A lot of new techniques and novel methods are being developed and under clinical trials. Therefore, right treatment is very important to save a patient's life. Doctors should select rational and scientifi c strategies of mono-therapy and/or combination therapy, including invasive and non-invasive measures as mentioned above to support, supplement or substitute the abnormal and insuffi cient function of human organs in diseases. Along with the rapid progress of medical science and technology, various new treatment methods and strategies appear. Great successes have been achieved in modern medicine marked by minimally invasive surgery (26) and regenerative medicine including gene therapy, molecular cloning, stem cell transplantation and tissue engineering (27,28) , all of which have become \"hot\" fields in biomedical science in the 21st century. As gene therapy should follow the \"3Y\" principle (29) , in clinical practice, the \"3Y\" principle also needs to be emphasized to better enforce the RT-ABCDE strategy for the management and prevention of human diseases. The RT-ABCDE strategy and SeCP-based synthetic program for hypertension are updated methods and are worthy of promotion for clinical practice. At the same time, both clinical and basic research scientists agree that it is very important to integrate the clinical sciences with public health. It is necessary to further understand the mechanisms for some diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus (31,32) , cancer and infectious diseases. On the other hand, it is time for health policy makers to consider the RT-ABCDE strategy as an essential and routine method for use in clinical and preventive medicine.",
