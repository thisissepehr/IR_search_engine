The most frequent cause of the common cold in adults is rhinoviruses. The ubiquitous common cold is one of the most frequently occurring diseases in the world. In the United States, adults usually develop two to four colds per year, while children have six to eight per year.' The search for an effective therapeutic agent against the common cold continues. A cold treatment that is even only partially effective in relieving cold symptoms could markedly reduce physical malaise and economic losses associated with the morbidity and lost working hours accompanying colds.",

The zinc-containing lozenges had 13.3 mg zinc per lozenge. The placebo lozenges were prepared from the same flavored hard-candy base and contained 5% calcium lactate pentahydrate. The placebo and zinc-containing lozenges were reported to have identical physical characteristics. However, organoleptic properties of the two lozenges did differ, since the zinc-containing lozenges were more astringent. Nonetheless, masking appears to have been maintained in this study because neither the placebo group nor the zinc group correctly guessed that they were getting the active medication.",

Resolution of the cold was defined as cessation of all symptoms, i.e., a total symptom score of 0, or resolution of all but one mild symptom, a total symptom score of 1. For analysis of treatment effect, the symptom list was reduced from 10 symptoms to 7 by combining tke symptoms of hoarseness, sore throat, and scratchy throat into a category called \"throat symptoms.\" Likewise, nasal drainage and nasal congestion were combined into \"nasal symptoms.\" Patient adherence to treatment was calculated as the number of lozenges consumed based on the total count of returned medication.

Patients who wrote their diaries from memory were also considered nonadherent. Patients were considered adherent if they took 4 or more lozenges per day for the first 4 days of the study and if they took no antibiotics. One patient withdrew from the study on the first day because of intolerance to the zinc-containing lozenge.

Surprisingly, subjective assessment of whether the treatment received had any effect on relieving symptoms of the cold revealed no difference between the two groups, despite the positive effects of the zinc treatment on the duration of cold symptoms. Side effects from the medication were assessed in two ways. During the study, the subjects were asked an open-ended question wherein they listed all of the side effects of the medication they were taking. Seventeen of the 49 subjects taking the zinccontaining lozenges reported that no side effects developed with their medications before the conclusion of the study. A comparison of duration of cold symptoms in this subgroup compared with that in the 32 patients in the zinc group who reported some side effect of the lozenge found no significant difference in the duration of cold symptoms. Thus, perception of a medication-related side effect did not influence the reporting of duration of the cold symptoms within the zinc group.",

No microbiological diagnosis of the common cold was obtained. The authors suggest that the timing of studies of this natGre could have a critical effect on the study outcome. The timing of their study in October preceded the influenza season. Moreover, the absence of fever in the patients at baseline suggests that certain viruses, such as influenza, parainfluenza, and adenovirus, were unlikely causes of the colds in their patients. A significant difference in baseline symptoms between the placebo and zinc groups (sore throat and possibly sneezing) may indicate that different viruses were responsible for the colds in the two groups; however, this difference between the groups diminished within the first 12 hours of the study. There was no chemical verification of compliance to the two dosing regimens. Furthermore, the results of this study do not necessarily apply to either pregnant women or immunocompromised patients because these patient groups were excluded from the study.",
