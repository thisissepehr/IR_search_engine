The role of atopy and IgE levels, as well as their relationship to clinical disease expression have not been defined. We hypothesized that an allergic diathesis modulates rhinoviral colds and have initiated studies of normal, atopic and asthmatic subjects employing experimental rhinoviral infection, with measurements of symptom scores, viral shedding and cultures, albumin in nasal washes and serological responses. Twenty-two subjects (11 normal, 5 atopic, 6 atopic and asthmatic) participated and were inoculated with human rhinovirus serotype 16 (HRV 16). Measurements of neutralizing antibody and viral culture were performed at screening, pre-inoculation, during the cold and at 8-10 weeks convalescence. Daily symptoms were noted, nasal washes done, IgE measured and atopy was diagnosed by skin tests. Seventeen volunteers developed clinical colds as assessed by symptom scores, virus shedding was demonstrated (with positive culture) in all subjects and a fourfold or higher seroconversion occurred in 11/22. Neutralizing HRV antibody developed unexpectedly in 10 subjects between screening and inoculation and the presence or absence of this pre-inoculation antibody determined subsequent severity of colds in normal but not in atopic subjects. Atopic antibody positive individuals developed severe clinical colds that were independent of preinoculation antibody in contrast to normal subjects who developed mild colds in the presence of a neutralizing antibody {P = 00\\). Both atopic and normal antibody negative subjects developed severe colds. This differential response was matched by nasal wash albumin levels which were significantly increased (^ = 0 01) during the cold in atopic (but not in normal) volunteers with pre-inoculation antibody.

A high percentage of subjects developed clinical colds as measured by symptom scores and atopic volunteers tended to have moderate to severe colds irrespective of preinoculation neutralizing antibody. This contrasted with normal subjects who had only mild symptoms when preinoculation antibody in excess of 1:2 dilution was demonstrated. This relatively subjective observation was supported by changes in nasal wash albumin levels found during the cold. Naclerio et al.

Tissue events may not parallel serum markers and serum IgE may thus not reflect levels of IgE or other atopy-associated mediators in nasal and other tissues. Alternatively, although the symptom score that we employed is sensitive to detect colds, it may be relatively insensitive in the presence of severe symptoms and not suitable to discriminate between moderately severe and very severe colds. Lack of such distinction will naturally hamper correlations sought with IgE levels, Atopic individuals may therefore exhibit an increased sensitivity to the consequences of a common cold, prompting the suggestion that allergic tissues were 'preprimed' by the existing allergic disease [21], Although the mediators involved in cold symptoms are not defined, it can be speculated that the quantities of various cytokines (for example IL-8, GM-CSF) as well as inflammatory mediators (leukotrienes, kinins) may be amplified in atopic tissues, causing more severe symptoms when released, Kinins are potent vasoactive peptides identified in nasal secretions during colds; they cause vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, and are probably generated in the nose during a cold [16] , Additionally, because intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is the cellular receptor for the major group of HRVs and may be upregulated in allergic inflammation, atopic individuals may be predisposed to higher rates of HRV infection and even further increases in ICAM-1 accompanied by the nasal recruitment of mediator cells able to amplify existing inflammation [22] , In summary, our studies employing an experimental HRV disease programme in normal and atopic volunteers yielded significant upper airway cold symptoms of greater severity in the atopic group.
