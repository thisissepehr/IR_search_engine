Our aim was to study body weight change after a hypercaloric high fat diet in lean and overweight people. 7 lean men (BMI=22.7 kg/m 2 , aged 25.2years) and 6 overweight men (BMI=26.7 kg/m 2 , aged 42.6years) received for 56 days, in addition to their usual diet, 760 kcal/day (79% fat). On day 0, 14 and 56, blood samples were taken and resting metabolic rate and substrate oxidation were measured by indirect calorimetry. On day 0 and 56, body composition was assessed by DEXA, visceral and subcutaneous fat by abdominal MRI and physical activity by actigraph. Insulin sensitivity was measured by Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (40mUI/m\u00b2/mn). Results: no difference in insulin sensitivity was seen after overfeeding. Weight gain was significantly higher in overweight group, even after age adjustment (3.7kg vs. 1.16kg p=0.04). Abdominal fat was stored in subcutaneous adipose tissue for overweight subjects and in visceral fat for lean subjects (Delta visceral fat=-2.5cm 3 vs. +19cm 3 p=0.05; Delta subcutaneous fat=+ 44cm 3 vs. -14cm 3 p=0.05). We found a negative correlation between FFA and BMI, and in the overweight group only, an early lipolysis inhibition (FFA D0=415 vs. FFAD14=306 mmol/l p=0.04) associated with triglycerides rise (TGD0=1075 vs.TGD14=1473 mmol/l p=0.03) and insulin rise (InsD0=8.6 vs. InsD14=13.7mU/l p=0.03). Fat oxidation was lower at day 14 (OxLD0=0.86 vs. OxLD14=0.7mg/kg/mn). None of these results were found in the lean group. Conclusions: Overweight subjects show higher susceptibility to weight gain than lean subjects due to early lipolysis inhibition and fat oxidation decrease.",

For this purpose, male and female Wistar rats were fed for 6 months with a normal-fat (NF) or an HF-diet. Body weight, blood metabolites, and the expression of genes involved in the fuel metabolism and partitioning in white adipose tissue (WAT), skeletal muscle and liver were measured. Female rats fed with HF-diet showed increased expression of genes related with energy influx in WAT (GLUT4, CD36, LPL) and with lipid utilization in muscle (PPAR-alpha, CPT1M). In contrast, male but not female rats showed increased hepatic PPAR-alpha and CPT1L mRNA expression, suggesting enhanced lipid handling and oxidation by this organ, and had higher triacylglycerol content in liver. These results show sex-dependent differences in fuel uptake and utilization between tissues in response to an HF-diet, with a higher capacity of females to store fat in adipose tissue and to oxidize fatty acids in muscle. These adaptations can help to explain the lower tendency of females of suffering from obesity-linked disorders under conditions of HF-diet consumption.",

Calorie restriction (CR) in rodents extends lifespan and restores a youthful growth hormone (GH) secretory pattern. Aim: To evaluate the effect of different types of CR for 6 months on 11h GH secretory dynamics. Methods: Forty-three (36.8\u00b11.0y) overweight (BMI 27.8\u00b10.7) men and women were randomized to either; Control=100% of energy requirements; CR=25% restriction; CR+EX=12.5% CR +12.5% increase in energy expenditure by exercise; LCD=low calorie diet until 15% weight reduction followed by weight maintenance. At baseline and month 6 we assessed changes in body composition (DXA), abdominal visceral fat (CT) and GH secretory dynamics (11-h of 10-min blood sampling). Results: Weight change at 6 months was (CR: -10\u00b11%, CR+EX:-10\u00b11%, LCD:-14\u00b11%). There were significant reductions in total fat mass (CR:-24\u00b13%, CR+EX:-25\u00b13%, LCD: -31\u00b12%) and abdominal visceral fat (CR:-28\u00b14%, CR+EX:-27\u00b13%, LCD:-36\u00b12%) in the 3 intervention groups. Mean 11h GH concentrations were not changed in CR or control but increased by 41\u00b18% in CR+EX (p<.0001) and 53\u00b18% in LCD (p<.0001) at month 6 owing to both increased secretory burst mass (CR+EX: 34\u00b113%, LCD: 27\u00b122%, p<0.05) and amplitude (CR+EX: 34\u00b114%, LCD: 30\u00b120%, p<0.05) but not to changes in burst frequency, inter-burst interval or GH half-life. Fasting ghrelin concentrations were significantly increased from baseline in all intervention groups however total IGF-1 concentrations were increased only in CR+EX (10\u00b17%, p<0.05) and LCD (19\u00b14%, p<0.001). Conclusion: Short-term CR in humans can modify growth hormone secretion in a manner that is opposite to the changes reported with aging.",

The aim of this study was to analyse whether alterations in uncoupling protein (UCP) expression in white and brown adipose tissues (WAT and BAT, respectively) and in skeletal muscle may be responsible for the effect of trans-10,cis-12 CLA on the size of body fat depots in hamsters. Animals were divided into three groups and fed an atherogenic diet with different amounts of trans-10,cis-12 CLA (0 control, 0.5, or 1 g/100 g diet) for 6 weeks. CLA feeding reduced adipose depot weights, but it had no effect on body weight. Leptin mRNA expression decreased in both subcutaneous and perirenal WAT depots, in accordance with lower adiposity, whereas resistin mRNA expression was not changed. Animals fed CLA had lower UCP1 mRNA levels in BAT (both doses of CLA) and in perirenal WAT (low dose), and lower UCP3 mRNA levels in subcutaneous WAT (high dose). UCP2 mRNA expression in WAT was not significantly affected by CLA feeding. Animals fed the high dose of CLA showed increased UCP3 and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-I (CPT-I) mRNA expression levels in skeletal muscle. In summary, induction of UCP1 or UCP2 in WAT and BAT is not likely to be responsible for the fat-reduction action of CLA, but the increased expression of UCP3 in skeletal muscle, together with a higher expression of CPT-I, may explain the reported effects of dietary CLA in lowering adiposity and increasing fatty acid oxidation by skeletal muscle.",

However, studies have reported prevalence varying from 1 to 12; penetrance remains elusive with non-obese carriers reported recently and clinical expression variation along the life is also uncertain. We provide a comprehensive molecular and phenotypic characterization of MC4R-induced obesity in a large European population. We sequenced the gene in 2,856 obese individuals and 2,677 non-obese controls and in the families of the mutation carriers. Newly identified missense mutations were functionally characterized. We also provided obesity-related phenotypes, including questionnaire-based appetitive behaviour. Forty-three obese probands (1.46%) and four non-obese controls (0.15%) carried MC4R pathogenic mutations; familial penetrance was 60% for heterozygotes. The longitudinal study of relatives with available data evidenced an age-dependent penetrance (21% at 20years vs. 60% at >40yrs) suggesting MC4R-deficiency as a late-onset obesity disorder. Comparing the 97 carriers with their 81 WT relatives, we observed that the risk of obesity decreased across generations: it is multiplied by 3.4 for children carriers and by 1.7 for adults >52yrs (p=9.6 10 -4 ) but the risk to become obese after 52 when carrying a pathogenic mutation remains significant (p=10 -11 ).",

The richest source of this compound is Polygonum cuspidatum and grapes. The interest of RSV has been increased for more than ten years and, during this time, RSV was found to exert numerous beneficial effects including the protection against cardiovascular disease, anticancer properties, inhibition of free radical generation. RSV is able to inhibit insulin secretion and to increase insulin sensitivity. Moreover, RSV appeared to be a modulator of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, an important regulator of energy balance and a dietary compound reducing metabolic disturbances induced by a high-calorie diet, suggesting its anti-obesity properties. However, the direct influence of RSV on adipocyte functions is unknown. The aim of the experiments was to investigate the effects of RSV on lipolysis and on the antilipolytic action of insulin in rat adipocytes. Cells, isolated from epididymal fat tissue of male Wistar rats, were incubated for 90 minutes with 100 \u03bcM RSV and lipolytic factorsepinephrine (0.06, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 \u03bcM) or dibutyryl-cAMP (a direct activator of PKA; 0.06, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 mM). The lipolysis was evaluated by the measuring of the amount of glycerol released to the incubation buffer. RSV significantly enhanced epinephrinestimulated lipolysis, but did not change lipolysis induced by dibutyryl-cAMP. In the further studies, isolated adipocytes were incubated with epinephrine (0.5 \u03bcM) in the presence of insulin (10 nM) and RSV (1, 10 and 100 \u03bcM) . It was found that the inhibitory action of insulin on epinephrine-induced lipolysis was attenuated by RSV. Similar effect was demonstrated in adipocytes exposed to epinephrine and H-89 (a direct activator of PKA; 50 \u03bcM) -the antilipolytic action of H-89 was diminished in the presence of RSV (1, 10 and 100 \u03bcM). The stimulation of epinephrine-induced lipolysis and the attenuation of the antilipolytic action of insulin in adipocytes exposed to RSV seems to be independent on the estrogenic properties of the tested compound since these effects were not alleviated by blockade of intracellular estrogen receptors. Results obtained in the present study revealed for the first time that short-term exposure to RSV enhances adipocyte lipolysis and thereby contributes to reduced lipid accumulation in these cells.

A growing number of clinical studies validate a relation of insulin resistance and breast cancer in obese patients. We hypothesised that high plasma insulin levels cause aberrant insulin signalling in breast epithelial cells which may be responsible for an increase in cell proliferation, indicative of potential carcinogenesis and increased cancer progression. It was of particular interest to determine any differences of high insulin concentrations in activating the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI-3 kinase) pathway or the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathway, the latter being linked to increased cell proliferation. We used two cell line models to investigate the carcinogenic (MCF-10A, immortalised breast epithelial cells) and cancer progression (MDA-MB-231, ER-negative breast cancer cells) potential of insulin. Insulin treatment (100 nM, 24 h) increased cell proliferation in MCF-10A cells, but had no cell proliferative effect on MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally expression of PCNA as marker of proliferation was tested. The use of PI-3 kinase and MAP kinase specific inhibitors (Wortmannin and PD98059, respectively) demonstrated both pathways being responsible for the observed increase in cell proliferation (MCF-10A). Simultaneous treatment with both inhibitors eliminated insulin induced cell proliferation entirely. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was examined as specific activity measurement of MAP kinase pathway. Insulin induced higher phosphorylation levels in MCF-10A cells than in MDA-MB-231. These preliminary results suggest that insulin may initiate carcinogenesis of breast epithelial cells by increasing cell proliferation rather than increasing cancer progression of existing tumours. These effects may be mediated by insulin activating both the PI-3 kinase and the MAP kinase signalling pathways. Funding: Research relating to this abstract was supported by NHS Grampian Endowment Trust and Research & Development Initiative, The Robert Gordon University Insulin resistance is a main feature of obesity and type II diabetes. Activity of MAP Kinase family members, including ERK, is increased in adipose tissue from obese and type II diabetic animals and patients. Strong evidences suggest that activation of MAPK is implicated in the down-regulation of insulin signaling and action in insulin resistance state. We have shown that mice lacking ERK1 are resistant to high fat diet induced obesity and protected from insulin resistance due to a decrease in adipogenesis and a higher post-prandial metabolic rate. To investigate the role of ERK1 in the development of insulin resistance in obese mice, we generated leptin-deficient mice (ob/ob) invalidated for ERK1 (ob/ob-erk1-/-). We found that ob/ob-erk1-/-mice remained as obese as ob/ob mice but are not hyperglycemic in the fed state unlike ob/ob mice. Glucose tolerance test and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp showed an improved insulin sensitivity of ob/ob-erk1-/-mice. This phenotype could be explained by a decreased visceral adipose tissue inflammation, known to be implicated in insulin signaling defect, because mRNA expression of inflammatory markers is decreased in adipose tissue of ob/ob-erk1-/-mice. Further, expression of genes coding for Glut4 and lipogenic enzymes is also diminished. In contrast no differences were observed in subcutaneous adipose tissue. We also demonstrated that ob/ob-erk1-/-are protected from liver steatosis with a reduction in liver triglycerides content and a reduction in ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) expression. Our data suggest that the specific targeting of erk1 could be of particular interest to fight obesity and insulin resistance. We evaluated the effect of skeletal muscle mitochondrial uncoupling on energy and glucose metabolism under different dietary challenges. Transgenic HSA-mUCP1 mice with ectopic expression of uncoupling protein 1 in skeletal muscle and wildtype littermates were fed for 3 months semi-synthetic diets with varying macronutrient ratios (energy % carbohydrate:protein:fat): HCLF: (41:42:17), HCHF (41:16:43); LCHF (11:45:44) . Body composition, energy metabolism and insulin resistance were assessed by quantitative NMR, indirect calorimetry, and insulin tolerance test, respectively. Finally, plasma metabolites were measured and gene expression in muscle, liver and white fat determined using real time PCR. In wildtype, both high fat diets led to an increase in body weight and fat. HSA-mUCP1 mice considerably increased body fat on the HCHF diet but stayed lean on the other diets. Irrespective of differences in body fat content, HSA-mUCP1 mice were much more insulin sensitive and had lower insulin levels and liver triglycerides compared to wildtype. Respiratory quotient and gene expression indicated overall higher carbohydrate oxidation of HSA-mUCP1 but a preferential channeling of fatty acids into muscle rather than liver at high fat diets compared to wildtype. Evidence for increased lipogenesis in white fat of HSA-mUCP1 mice suggests an increased energy dissipating substrate cycling. We conclude that skeletal muscle mitochondrial uncoupling does not protect from the development of obesity in all circumstances. Rather it can lead to a \"healthy\" obese phenotype by preserving insulin sensitivity and a high metabolic flexibility and thus protecting from the development of obesity associated disturbances of glucose homeostasis. Supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) Recent data has shown that germ free mice inoculated with gut microbiota from obese diabetic mice gain more fat than mice inoculated with flora from lean mice. However, it is not clear whether gut microbiota is involved in insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of the gut microflora in the pathophysiology of diabetes by modulating the intestinal microbiota of ob/ob diabetic mice using an antibiotic treatment. A 2 week administration of norfloxacin and ampicillin (1g/l each in drinking water) reduced the cecal bacterial DNA concentrations below detection limit, indicating that the number of intestinal bacteria was significantly reduced by the treatment. Similarly, the concentration of plasma lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria was also lower in mice receiving antibiotics. In addition, the treated ob/ob mice showed a much improved glycemic control with normalized basal glycaemia, restoration of liver glycogen storage and increased oral glucose tolerance. Elevated plasma adiponectin concentrations in the treated mice supported the beneficial effects of the antibiotic treatment. These benefits were independent of food intake or body weight, since pair-fed mice weighed less but were as insulin resistant as the control animals. Hepatic triglycerides were also lower in the treated mice, and this result was associated with an up-regulation of hepatic fatty acid oxidation gene CYP4a10. In summary, present results indicate that gut microbiota modulation via antibiotics alters the metabolic and inflammatory status associated with insulin resistance, and results in improved glycemic control in obese and insulin resistant ob/ob mice.",

            "text": "The nuclear receptor PPAR\u03b1 plays a major role in the control of lipid metabolism by regulating the expression of genes of \u03b2-oxidation, ketogenesis and peroxisomal oxidation pathways. PPAR\u03b1 is highly expressed in liver and brown fat, tissues with high fatty acid oxidation rates. Surprisingly, PPAR\u03b1 is also expressed in human white adipose tissue, where PPAR\u03b3 is abundant. Our group has shown that in human mature adipocytes, activation of PPAR\u03b1 with its agonist GW7647 leads to enhanced expression and activity of the glycerol kinase (GyK) gene, probably as a result of direct activation of GyK transcription by PPAR\u03b1. We further investigated this unexpected role for PPAR\u03b1 in regulation of white adipocyte gene expression. Pangenomic micro-arrays were used to compare mRNA profiles of human mature adipocytes treated with GW7647 or with PPAR\u03b3 agonist, Rosiglitazone. A one class analysis using SAM software established two lists of 1700 genes whose expressions were significantly modified by BRL or GW7647 treatment (FDR< 5%). A two class paired comparison of these lists, that has been validated by RT-qPCR, yield 80 genes differentially expressed between treatments. Five genes were more expressed when PPAR\u03b1 was activated and the expression of 75 genes was higher with PPAR\u03b3 agonist. PPAR\u03b1 activation upregulates genes of the \u03b2-oxidation pathway and downregulates genes of the glycolytic pathway. To assess the impact of PPAR\u03b1 on adipocyte metabolism, the glycolytic flux and palmitate oxidation are measured in adipocytes where PPAR\u03b1 is either activated by its agonist or silenced using siRNA.

Neonate rats were supplemented during lactation with a daily oral dose of leptin or the vehicle. We followed body weight and food intake of animals until the age of 15 months, and measured glucose, insulin, and leptin levels under different feeding conditions: ad libitum feeding, 14-h fasting, and 3-h re-feeding after fasting. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and a leptin resistance test were performed. Food preferences were also measured. Leptin-treated animals were found to have lower body weight in adulthood and to eat fewer calories than their controls. Plasma insulin levels were lower in leptin-treated animals than in their controls under the different feeding conditions, as was the increase in insulin levels after food intake. The homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance index was significantly lower in leptin-treated animals, and the OGTT also indicated higher insulin sensitivity in leptin-treated animals. In addition, these animals displayed lower plasma leptin levels under the different feeding conditions and were also more responsive to exogenous leptin administration. Leptin-treated animals also showed a lower preference for fatrich food. These observations indicate that animals supplemented with physiological doses of oral leptin during lactation were more protected against obesity and metabolic features of the metabolic syndrome.",

The (IFN)gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10/CXCL10), a chemokine with chemoattractant properties for various leukocyte subsets, is expressed and secreted in primary mature human adipocytes. Elevated IP-10 serum concentrations correlate positively with the incidence of type 2 diabetes. Aim of this work was to study the mechanism of IP-10 transcriptional regulation in murine 3T3-L1, primary human preadipocytes and adipocytes and to characterize the relative contribution of preadipocytes and adipocytes to IP-10 expression/secretion. In 3T3-L1 cells, IP-10 expression and secretion was significantly regulated by NF-kB as shown by chemical interfering with blockers of different signalling pathways. This was confirmed by specific inhibition of NF-kB activity using stable overexpression of a transdominant mutant of IkB-alpha which was found to completely suppress basal and IL-1beta-induced IP-10 expression. In additional experiments in primary human adipocytes, the critical role of NF-kB for IP-10 expression was confirmed. An interesting observation both in the human and murine system was that adipocytes secrete and express significantly higher levels of IP-10 compared to preadipocytes. In conclusion these data demonstrate a central role for the NF-kB pathway in the regulation of IP-10 in primary human and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes. Furthermore, the results of our study clearly show that adipocytes rather than preadipocytes contribute significantly to obesity-associated elevated IP-10 levels. Future studies should focus on the potential role of this chemokine as a chemoattractant for immune cells in adipose tissue.

We here assessed more directly the adipogenic potential (proliferation and differentiation) of cultured stromovascular (SV) cells isolated from subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (biopsies) in matched obese men with and without T2DM (n=10 per group, BMI 32.3 \u00b1 4.7, age 58 \u00b1 11, Means \u00b1 SD). SV cells (three sets of triplicates) were seeded at 0.3 \u00d7 10 4 cells/cm 2 in 96-well plates in DMEM/F-12 with 10% FBS. Nuclear fluorescence (CyQuant kit, Invitrogen) was determined on day 1 and 4 (2 culture sets) and proliferation was calculated as the fold-increase in fluorescence from day 1-4. At confluence, the third culture set was switched to serum-free differentiation medium for 11 days followed by fluorescent staining for lipids (BODIPY) and nuclei (DAPI). The BODIPY-to-DAPI fluorescence ratio was used as an index of differentiation. There was no difference in SV cells proliferation between T2DM and controls: 6.1 \u00b1 2.0 vs. 5.0 \u00b1 2.7 (p = 0.3). Large inter-individual variability in adipocyte differentiation was observed but again there was no difference between groups: 27 \u00b1 20% in T2DM vs. 22 \u00b1 11% in controls (p = 0.6). These results demonstrate that in vitro proliferation and differentiation of adipose tissue-derived SV cells are similar in men with and without T2DM. This suggests that the often reported in vivo impaired adipogenesis in diabetes may be due to different physiological milieu of the adipose tissue rather than intrinsic cellular differences. The excessive development of adipose tissue (AT) is the result of both hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the main cellular component of AT, the adipocytes. Surprisingly, few data are available concerning the identity of the adipocyte precursor cell. Among the AT stroma-vascular fraction, the CD34 + /CD31 cell population was shown to be the only one that possesses adipogenic capability. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the proliferative status of the CD34 + /CD31 progenitor cells within human subcutaneous AT and to determine whether stimuli originating from the microenvironment in which CD34 + /CD31 cells reside such as adipokines and oxygen tension, could modulate their proliferation. We demonstrate, using Ki67 as a proliferation marker, that progenitor cells within the human AT were in proliferative state, the proportion of which being positively modulated by the adiposity of the patients and associated to an increased number of small size adipocytes (diameter<60\u03bcm). Moreover, mature adipocyte-and endothelial cell-conditioned media as well as 48 hours of low oxygen tension (1%O 2 ) induced the proliferation of the CD34 + /CD31 cells \"in vitro\" whereas macrophage-conditioned media were antiproliferative (evaluated by BrdU incorporation assay). Among the adipokines possibly involved, leptin, VEGF, IL-6 and LPA were shown to enhance the proliferation of the CD34 + /CD31 cells whereas adiponectin was without effect. The present study suggests that fat mass extension is associated with the proliferation of AT-derived progenitor cells involving local stimuli arising from mature adipocytes and endothelial cells as well as decreased local oxygen tension.",

Mean BMI loss in gastroplasty patients with vagotomy is 7.8\u00b11.4 (sem) versus 6.1\u00b11.0 in gastroplasty alone (p<0.05), corresponding to 44% excess weight loss (EWL) versus 33% over the very long term. 52% TV \"responders\" (BMI loss >8) had a mean 79%EWL compared to 62% among 45% \"responders\" with gastroplasty alone. Preliminary studies of laparoscopic TV alone and combined with adjustable banding demonstrate similar weight loss and safety outcomes. In conclusion: TV has robust long-term effects on body weight, although weight loss is modest in middle-aged severely obese patients. As with all obesity treatment, patient selection is critical and favors younger patients with less disease to minimize volitional breakdown and cognitive override of autonomic function.",

Isoprenoids, such as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), regulate transcriptional and posttranscriptional events that affect various biological processes. In this study, we investigated the effects of FPP or GGPP on adipocyte differentiation because several adipocytokines, which are secreted molecule from adipocyte, have been reported to be involved in systemic insulin responsiveness, and their secretions are closely related to adipocyte differentiation. In 3T3-L1 cells, addition of GGPP during adipocyte differentiation significantly reduced the expression of adipogenic marker genes, such as adipocyte fatty acid binding protein and peroxisome proliferators activated receptor \u03b3, and insulinstimulated glucose uptake. On the other hand, FPP was not effective. The effects of GGPP partially diminished in the presence of liver X receptor (LXR) agonist T0901317, but unchanged in the presence of geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor GGTI-286. Intracellular GGPP levels were increased in parallel with adipocyte differentiation. Moreover the expression levels of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase 1 (GGPS1) which catalyzes the formation of GGPP from FPP increased after differentiation. In 3T3-L1 cells, stably overexpressing FLAG-tagged GGPS1, intracellular GGPP levels were significantly elevated. In these cells, after differentiation induction, both the expression of adipogenic marker genes and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake were reduced. In genetic and diet induced obese mouse white adipose tissue, GGPS1 mRNA expression was up-regulated. These results suggest that GGPP may perform as an endogenous regulator of adipocyte differentiation by a mechanism that is partially dependent on the LXR pathway.",

In this study two indicators-waist circumference & waist to hip ratio-were compared for identifying overweight/obesity in college student girls in the framework of the effectiveness of iron supplementation with and without vitamin C on oxidative stress markers project. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 289 college student girls from Shaheed Beheshti University of Medical sciences dormitories were enrolled voluntarily. Demographic data were obtained by questionnaire. Anthropometric data including height, weight, waist and hip circumferences were measured based on standard protocols and body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio (WHR) were computed. Waist circumference (WC) above 88cm and WHR above 0.85 was considered as central obesity. SPSS software, chi-square test and ROC analysis were used for data analysis. Findings: Mean of BMI, waist circumference and WHR in subjects studied were 22.2\u00b13.1 kg/m 2 , 74.4\u00b18.8 cm and 0.81\u00b10.46, respectively and increased with age (p<0.05). 7.7, 77.4, 13.1 and 1.8% were underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese, respectively. Based on waist circumference, 7.3% and based on WHR, 35.2% of subjects had central obesity. More than 70% of central obese girls based on WHR were categorized in underweight (4.2%) and normal weight groups (67.7%); whereas, only 20% of central obese girls based on WC were categorized in normal weight group. None of the obese ones were included in without central obesity group. Area under ROC curves for identifying overweight/obesity based on WC and WHR were 0.92\u00b10.02 and 0.76\u00b10.04, respectively (p<0.001). WC = 77 cm for identifying overweight in college student girls had better sensitivity (0.85) and specificity (0.75) than WHR =0.79 (sensitivity = 0.70 and specificity = 0.69). Sensitivity of current WC cut off value (88cm) was very low (about 40%). Conclusion: Sensitivity and specificity of waist circumference to identify overweight/obesity in college student girls was higher than WHR and therefore, WC is the better indicator for categorizing this age group based on weight status.

It is important to control adipocyte methabolism for regulating adipocyte hypertrophy and adipocytekine secretion for therapy of life style related disease. But relations between adipocyte methabolism and hypertrophy or adipocytekine secretion are unknown. In this study, we developed simultaneous analysis system of 3T3-L1 adipocyte methabolism by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry by using stable isotope technique to explain adipocyte methabolism and adipocytekine secretion mechanism. Methods: 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated for 10day, incubation with thiazolidinediones. After differentiation, medium were replaced by non-glucose DMEM added 13 C 6 -glucose, and incubated for 48h. Glucose, glycerol, fatty acids, and other organic acids of medium and cell lysate were analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Results: We could develop quantitative analysis method to examine of adipocyte major methabolism, lipolysis, glucose-uptake, several fatty acid syntheses with high sensitivity by using stable isotope technique. In 3T3-L1 adipocyte, addition of pioglitazone made 13 C 6 -oleic acid and other mono unsaturated acid synthesis decreased dose-dependently, whereas addition of losiglitazone made them increased. It was suggested that thiazolidinediones not only activate glucose-uptake and fatty acid synthesis but also regulate fatty acid composition in 3T3-L1 adipocyte. Relations between fatty acids composition and adipocytekine secretion or hypertrophy of adipocytes are under examination by the described method.",

OE is counter-regulated by glucocorticoids since corticosterone prevents the OE-induced loss of lipids in adrenalectomized rats, partly by increasing both hepatic 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 and free circulating glucocorticoid, through modulation of serum CBG binding. To study changes in steroid hormones and the receptors implied in glucocorticoid action, female adrenalectomized Wistar rats were implanted with subcutaneous pellets of placebo, 0.48, 1.67, or 4 .76 mg/day of corticosterone; 5 days later, all rats received a daily gavage of sunflower oil, plain or containing OE at a dose of 10nmol/g for additional 8 days. A group of sham-operated rats was used as control of surgery. The expression of the receptors for glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and progesterone A and A+B in liver were analyzed by Real-Time PCR and corticosterone, dehydrocorticosterone and progesterone in serum were measured by HPLC-MS/MS. Levels of corticosterone and dehydrocorticosterone increased with the dose of corticosterone in pellets with no effects of OE. Progesterone was higher in all OE-treated rats, corticosterone not affecting its levels. OE increased the expression of glucocorticoid and both progesterone receptors in sham-operated and in adrenalectomized rats treated with corticosterone. Corticosterone alone did not change progesterone receptor expression and affected in a biphasic way receptors of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. In conclusion, OE enhanced both glucocorticoid and progesterone signalling in liver through the increased expression of its receptors and availability of the hormones. \u22c5m -2 and 67\u00b15 vs. 54\u00b12 nmol\u22c5m -2 , P<0.01) and inversely related to insulin sensitivity, with OBS showing tendency towards increased response.

Fisiologia, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli \"Federico II\", Napoli, Italy 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine (T2) prevents body weight-gain and fat accumulation when administered to rats receiving a high -fat diet (HFD). It induces an increase in hepatic fatty acid (FA) oxidation concomitant to their less efficient utilization. The effects of T2 on fatty acid oxidation involve the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but it is not clear how its modulation is achieved in tissues such as liver and white adipose tissue (WAT). Three groups of rats were used, either receiving a 6 hour, 1 day, 1week or 4-week high fat diet with (group HFD-T2), or without (group HFD), a daily i.p. injection of T2 (25 \u03bcg/100 g BW),or a standard diet for the same periods (group N). Within 6 hours, T2 increased liver FA oxidation without induction of AMPK phosphorylation. Only after 4 weeks the HFD -T2-treated rats showed a marked increase in liver AMPK phosphorylation. In WAT, between 1 day and 1 week, T2 induced an decrease in AMPK phosphorylation compared to the HFD rats, concomitant with an increase in lipolysis and serum fatty acid levels, which ceases after 4 weeks, possibly because WAT cell volume reached a minimum. At this timepoint hepatic lipids were barely present and serum lipids were not increased compared to N controls. In conclusion, treatment with T2 increases hepatic FA utilization which does not depend on AMPK phosphorylation in this tissue, but decreases AMPK phosphorylation in WAT, resulting in increased lipolysis. As fatty acid oxidation proceeds, liver AMPK is phosphorylated as a consequence of hepatic fuel-depletion.",

Acute exercise is associated with increased sensitivity to the effects of leptin on food intake in an IL-6dependent manner. To determine whether exercise ameliorates the AMPK and mTOR response to leptin in the hypothalamus in an IL-6-dependent manner, rats performed two 3-h exercise bouts, separated by one 45-min rest period. Intracerebroventricular IL-6 infusion reduced food intake and pretreatment with AMPK activators and mTOR inhibitors prevented IL-6induced anorexia. Activators of AMPK increased food intake in control rats to a greater extent than that observed in exercised ones, whereas inhibitors of AMPK had the opposite effect. Exercise was associated with both reduced phosphorylation of the AMPK/ACC signaling pathway and increased phosphorylation of proteins involved in mTOR signal transduction in the hypothalamus. Treatment with leptin reduced food intake in exercised rats that were pretreated with vehicle, although no increase in sensitivity to leptin-induced anorexia after pre-treatment with anti-IL6 antibody, AICAR or Rapamycin was detected.

However it is not clear whether gut microbiota is involved in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. To address this issue, we modulated gut microbiota via antibiotic treatments and examined the diabetic phenotypes of diet-induced obese and insulin resistant (DIO) mice immediately after the treatments and after a 4-week washout period. Our data demonstrate that 2-week treatment with polymyxin B/neomycin (0.5 and 1.0 g/L) significantly altered the cecal microbiota profile and reduced the number of cecal Enterobacteria. The blood glucose concentration was also reduced by 6.2% in the treated DIO mice. Norfloxacin/ampicillin treatment (1.0 g/L each) drastically reduced cecal bacterial DNA concentrations below the limit of detection resulting in enhanced glycemic control with a 15.8% reduction in glycemia and improved glucose tolerance in the DIO mice. After the 4-week washout period, the pattern of cecal microbiota was similar to that observed at the end of antibiotic treatments, regardless of the combination of antibiotics. However, the beneficial effect of norfloxacin and ampicillin was restricted to a lowered fasting glycemia, while the mice previously treated with polymyxin B/neomycin showed further improvements in fasting glycemia and oral glucose tolerance. The continuous improvement in glycemic control was associated with the modulated intestinal microbiota rather than the food intake, body weights or body fat of the mice. In summary, our data indicate that treatment with the non-absorptive antibiotics polymyxin B/neomycin ameliorated glycemic control of DIO mice through a mechanism involved in gut microbiota modifications.",

Blood parameters and the expression (by RT-qPCR) of genes involved in lipogenesis and lipolysis in WAT and in liver were analysed. mRNA levels of genes involved in lipogenesis in liver (SREBP1c, FAS and GPAT) had already decreased after 4 h fasting, as well as those of PPARgamma in WAT, while the decrease in SREBP1c, FAS, GPAT and GLUT4 mRNA levels in WAT was observed after 8 h.

Blood glucose and plasma insulin levels in DIO and ob/ob mice were higher than normal mice, and plasma ghrelin levels were lower in DIO and ob/ob mice. There was reduced body weight loss in DIO mice than in normal mice for 24 hours fasting. When they were re-fed, DIO and ob/ob mice consumed less food intake than normal mice. 24 hours food deprivation induced significantly smaller plasma ghrelin elevation in these obese mice. Fasting-induced decrease in oxygen consumption was significantly smaller in DIO and ob/ob mice than normal mice.

White adipose tissue (WAT) emerges as an important organ in controlling lifespan. Caloric restriction (CR) delays the rate of ageing, which may be modulated partly by altering the amount and function of WAT. This study examined whether CR alters WAT cellularity, and whether CR affects expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, including adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), adiponectin and its receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) in WAT and adipocytes. Epididymal WAT was dissected from male Brown Norway rats that had undergone CR (55% of ad libitum intake) for 4 months or been fed ad libitum. Adipocytes were isolated from WAT following collagenase digestion. The morphometric analysis of adipocytes was performed. Gene expression was quantitated by real-time PCR. Circulating FFA, glycerol and adiponectin levels were determined using commercial kits. CR markedly reduced epididymal fat mass (-42%), adipocyte diameter (-17%) and sectional area (-33%). CR led to an increase in ATGL mRNA levels in both WAT and adipocytes (>2-fold), which was paralleled by a 2-fold rise in plasma FFA and glycerol, respectively. Adiponectin mRNA levels were elevated in both WAT and adipocytes (>2-fold) as were circulating adiponectin (2.5-fold) in CR rats. However, CR had no effects on AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 expression at tissue or cell level. It is concluded that CR reduces fat mass and lipid storage in WAT. These changes might result from increased lipolysis in WAT and enhanced adiponectin production to stimulate lipid utilization in other tissues.

Obesity is associated with insulinresistance and increased plasma oxidized-LDL. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of oxidized-LDL on the sensitivity of human omental adipocytes to insulin stimulation, by evaluating the glucose uptake. Human adipocytes were isolated from omental biopsies obtained from individuals undergoing abdominal surgery for benign conditions. Briefly, adipose biopsies were digested with Krebs-Ringer solution containing collagenase (1mg/g adipose tissue) for 1h at 37\u00b0C. The isolated cells were characterized by Oil Red O staining and mRNA expression of leptin and adiponectin. Moreover the expression of Pref-1 was determined to detect possible pre-adipocyte contamination. After 24h, the cells were serum starved for 3h with or without 0.1 mg/ml native-or oxidized-LDL, and incubated with 0.1\u03bcM insulin for 30 min. Glucose uptake was measured by 2-deoxy-D- [H 3 ] glucose. The isolated adipocytes showed a mature phenotype and a high sensitivity to insulin stimulation as demonstrated by the 100% increase of glucose uptake with respect to un-stimulated cells. In cells treated with native-LDL the uptake was comparable to that of control cells. On the contrary, the treatment with oxidized-LDL resulted in a marked decrease (-40%) of insulin-induced glucose uptake. This result did not depend on cytotoxicity as demonstrated by the [ 3 H]uridine incorporation which was comparable in treated and control cells.",

The purpose of the present work was to compare the effects of this CLA isomer on body fat accumulation, as well as on lipogenic enzyme expression, between young and adult hamsters, in order to determine the influence of age. Young (9-week-old) and adult (8-month-old) male Syrian Golden hamsters were divided into four groups (n=8) and fed high-fat diets containing 0.5% linoleic acid (control groups) or 0.5% trans-10,cis-12 CLA for 6 weeks. Perirenal (PR), epididymal (EP) and subcutaneous (SC) adipose tissues were dissected and weighed, and acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) expressions were measured by RT-PCR in SC depot. Young hamsters fed the CLA-enriched diet showed a significant decrease in adipose tissue weight from all the anatomical locations analyzed (PR: -29%; EP: -21%; SC: -29%). In contrast, in adult animals only SC adipose tissue was significantly reduced (-28%) . No CLA effect on lipogenic enzyme expression was observed. Although a tendency towards reduced expression of lipogenic enzymes was found in adult hamsters when compared with young hamsters, the difference did not reach statistical significance. These results show that CLA induced body fat reduction is greater in young than in adult hamsters, suggesting that aging reduces trans-10,cis-12 CLA effectiveness. This difference was not due to a differential effect on lipogenic enzymes. Dipartimento di Scienze della Vita, SUN Aim: High fat diet (HFD) is associated with the development of steatosis and insulin resistance. Recent evidences suggest that 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine (T2), a naturally occurring iodothyronine, when administered to HFD fed rats, prevents steatosis. However, studies on T2 effects on insulin resistance and oxidative stress, which is known to be involved in insulin resistance and liver steatosis, are still lacking. In the present research, we detected the ability of T2 to improve HFD-induced impaired glucose tolerance, liver steatosis and oxidative stress. Methods: Three groups of rats were used: control rats receiving standard diet (N), rats receiving HFD (D), rats receiving HFD and a daily i.p. injection of T2 (25\u03bcg/100 g b.w.) (DT2). The experimental period lasted 4 weeks. Oral glucose tolerance test was performed after 16 hours fasting. In liver mitochondria, aconitase activity, as an index of mitochondrial oxidative stress, and fatty acid oxidation rate were detected. Results: D rats showed decreased glucose tolerance and elevated plasma insulin, while DT2 rats were characterized by improved glucose tolerance. The livers of D rats were lighter in colour than DT2 livers, suggesting that they contained more fat. At the hepatic level, mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation rate progressively increased in N, D and DT2 rats. When compared to N, D rats showed an increase in oxidative stress which was prevented by T2 treatment. Conclusions: T2 improved HFD-induced impaired glucose tolerance as well as prevented liver steatosis by activating mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation rate and decreasing oxidative stress.

ATGL mRNA levels are regulated by the nutritional status, being induced after fasting. We have studied possible differences in ATGL expression in different white adipose tissue depots and in brown adipose tissue of Wistar rats of different ages (1, 3, 5, 7 and 13 months) , distributed in a control and a 14 h-fasted group. The different adipose tissue depots studied express different amounts of ATGL, with the highest levels found for all the ages in the brown adipose tissue in comparison with the white fat. Fasting up-regulates ATGL expression only in white adipose tissue and, moreover, this up-regulation is lost with age, contributing to an increased difficulty for mobilizing lipids in older animals in response to a nutritional stress as is fasting. However, and despite the high levels found in brown fat, ATGL expression is not affected by fasting at any of the ages studied in this tissue. This fact has not been previously reported and would indicate a different regulation for ATGL in brown fat, independent of feeding conditions.",

Oleoyl-estrone (OE) treatment also enhances insulin sensitivity, but its main effect is to deplete body lipid stores. We compared the effects of rosiglitazone (RG) or OE, alone or in combination, on different white adipose tissue (WAT) sites in order to gain insight into the mechanism of action of OE and to study ways to limit thiazolidinedione-induced increases in body fat. Four groups of overweight male Wistar rats were used for a 10-day treatment: Controls (C), OE-treated (OET), RG-treated (RGT), and combinated OE plus RG treatment (RG+OET); After sacrifice, ventro-lateral strips of subcutaneous (S), epididymal (E), retroperitoneal strip (R), and mesenteric (M) WAT pads were dissected and used for semiquantitative real time PCR measurement of specific mRNAs concentrations in WAT. In the four sites tested, OE markedly decreased the expression of GLUT4, adiponutrin, fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase; It also decreased the expression of lipoprotein lipase, SREBP1c, C/EBPalpha, C/EBPbeta and PPARgama1 when considering all WAT. RG elicited an increase in the expression of fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and adiponutrin in the four sites and induced global increases in the expression of GLUT4, lipoprotein lipase, PPARgamma1 and PPARgamma2. OE and RG show a widely different pattern of change in WAT energy metabolism and regulatory indicators' gene expression. The results hint that OE induced a marked depression in WAT metabolic activity and decrease adipogenesis while the RG effects on rats were practically the reverse.",

Plasma cholesterol was halved in OEt and unchanged in PF. Pair-feeding reduced the expression of 3-HMGCoA synthase and the LDL receptor; but cholesterol synthesis was not affected by OE, nor was the expression of LCAT in all groups. Cholesterol disposal for bile acid synthesis was increased in PF and OE rats, as shown by the expression of cholesterol 7 -hydroxylase, suggesting the activation of cholesterol disposal.

This study was supported by grants from the \"Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias\" and \"Plan Nacional de Investigaci\u00f3n en Biomedicina\", from the Government of Spain. Adiponectin, an adipokine produced exclusively by adipocytes, exerts antiinflammatory effects on macrophages. It suppresses the production of proinflammatory cytokines in response to bacterial lipo-poly-saccharide (LPS). We have shown that the anti-inflammatory effect of adiponectin is more complicated than previously thought and involves induction of macrophage tolerance. More specifically, in the THP-1 human macrophage cell line, in primary mouse peritoneal macrophages and in primary human peripheral macrophages that have not been pre-exposed to adiponectin, exposure to globular adiponectin (gAd) induces TNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion. However, pre-exposure of macrophages to 10 microg/ml gAd renders them tolerant to further gAd exposure or to other pro-inflammatory stimuli such as TLR3 ligand polyI:C and TLR4 ligand LPS, while pre-exposure to low levels of gAd was ineffective in inducing tolerance. We further investigated the mechanism involved in adiponectin-mediated macrophage tolerance. We have found that adiponectin inhibits the TLR signalling pathway. More specifically, gAd induces IRAK-M expression in macrophages both at the protein and the mRNA level. Homologous deletion of IRAK-M partly abolished the tolerogenic effect of gAd since pre-treatment of IRAK-M -/-macrophages with gAd did not suppress LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production. In conclusion, our data suggest that the constant presence of high levels of adiponectin in the blood of lean subjects renders their macrophages resistant to pro-inflammatory stimuli, including that of adiponectin itself via regulation of IRAK-M expression.",

We therefore investigated whether genetic TNF-deficiency affects fat deposition and intracellular insulin signaling in liver and adipose tissue in TNF-KO and wild type (WT) mice fed chow (CH) or HF (60% energy) diet. After 4 wk HF diet access we measured plasma glucose, insulin, leptin and resistin levels after 12-h fasts or 3-h re-feeding, body adiposity and liver fat content, and hepatic PI3K, SOCS3, IRS-2 and PPARg expression. TNF-deficiency had no effect on body adiposity, which increased more in HF than CH mice. KO HF mice had improved insulin sensitivity and lower fed and fasted leptin levels than WT HF mice. Resistin levels were lower in KO vs. WT mice regardless of diet. Liver fat content was increased 3 fold in WT vs. KO HF mice, and the latter was similar to CH mice. Liver fat pad IRS-2 expression was 60 % higher in KO vs. WT HF mice. No other downstream genes were affected in the liver. These results suggest that genetic TNF-\u03b1 deficiency protects against the development of insulin resistance elicited by 4 wk of HF feeding by (a) up-regulation of IRS-2 in the liver, which prevents downstream insulin signaling failure and hepatic steatosis; (b) preventing the expected increase in leptin levels, probably via a non-insulin dependent mechanism; and (c) diet-independent maintenance of low resistin levels.",

Acute hyperinsulinemia, on the other hand, correlates with reduction of total and HMW adiponectin. To clarify the inhibitory role of insulin on adiponectin, total and HMW adiponectin levels were measured during acute hyperinsulinemia before and after weight loss. Fifty-five postmenopausal women were randomized to either a 6 month caloric restriction alone (CR, n = 28) or CR with resistance training (CR-RT, n = 27). Body composition (DEXA) and IS (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp) were assessed before and after weight loss. Total and HMW adiponectin levels were measured by ELISA at baseline, 60, 160 and 180 minutes of each clamp. Relative mean body weight loss was 7.8% for both groups (CR: -7.7\u00b1 0.7%, CR-RT: -7.9 \u00b1 1.0%). IS increased significantly by 11.3% (CR: 9.4 \u00b1 6.3%, CR-RT: 13.2 \u00b1 4.7%). Before each intervention, total and HMW adiponectin levels in both groups significantly decrease in response to hyperinsulinemia (total: 7.8\u00b1 2.5% vs HMW: 2.6 \u00b1 1.6 %). Despite the improvement in IS seen after each intervention, a similar pattern of reduction in total and HMW adiponectin levels was observed during hyperinsulinemia. Taken together, these results attest that total and HMW adiponectin levels are reduced during hyperinsulinemia. Also, the insulin-sensitizing effect of weight loss via caloric restriction alone or with resistance training does not alter adiponectin level reduction observed during hyperinsulinemia.",

Several molecular mechanisms have been convincingly involved in activating inflammatory processes and altering cell composition in white adipose tissue (WAT). However, the overall importance of these alterations, and their long-term impact on the metabolic functions of the WAT and on its morphology, remain unclear. We analyzed the transcriptomic signature of the subcutaneous WAT in obese human subjects, in stable weight conditions and after weight loss following bariatric surgery. An original integrative functional genomics approach was applied to quantify relations between relevant structural and functional themes annotating differentially expressed genes, to construct a comprehensive map of transcriptional interactions defining the obese WAT. These analyses highlighted a significant up-regulation of genes and biological themes related to extracellular matrix (ECM) constituents, including members of integrins family, and suggested that these elements could play a major mediating role in a chain of interactions which connects local inflammatory phenomena to the alteration of WAT metabolic functions in obese subjects. Tissue and cellular investigations, driven by the analysis of transcriptional interactions, revealed an increased amount of interstitial fibrosis in obese WAT, associated with an infiltration of different types of inflammatory cells, and suggested that phenotypic alterations of human preadipocytes, induced by a proinflammatory environment, may lead to an excessive synthesis of ECM components. Our study opens new perspectives in understanding the biology of human WAT and its pathologic changes indicative of tissue deterioration, associated with the development of obesity.

We examined the effect of weight-loss on the APM1, its receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) and visfatin expression in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of morbidly obese subjects with or without diabetes. In 10 obese non-diabetic subjects (NGT) and 10 obese diabetic patients (DM2), SAT tissue was obtained during bariatric surgery and again one year after surgery. mRNA relative quantifications of APM1, AdipoR1, AdipoR2 and visfatin were performed by RT-PCR. After surgery, BMI was reduced in NGT and DM2 subjects (-15.9\u00b13.6 and -15.9\u00b16.1 kg/m 2 , respectively, p<0.0001). Fasting plasma insulin was reduced in both groups (-15.3\u00b111.3 and -13.1\u00b19 .4 \u03bcU/ml, p<0.01). Fasting plasma glucose was reduced in DM2 only (-2.9\u00b11.6 mmol/l, p=0.001). Following weight loss, plasma adiponectin increased in both groups (+4.72\u00b13.29 and +6.56\u00b14.92, p=0.0003, respectively), APM1 did not change in NGT, (3.83\u00b11.25 vs 4.08\u00b12.01, p=ns), whereas it increased in DM2 (2.69\u00b11.32 vs 4.77\u00b11.26, p=0.0035). AdipoR1 was not changed by weight loss in either group (3.49\u00b11.18 vs 2.83\u00b10.98 and 2.73\u00b11.29 vs 2.89\u00b12.89 respectively, p=ns); this was also true of AdipoR2 (4.92\u00b12.84 vs 3.88\u00b11.7 and 4.18\u00b13.02 vs 3.76\u00b11.3 respectively, p=ns). Conversely, visfatin expression decreased both in NGT (2.12\u00b11.15 vs 1.02\u00b10.27, p=0.008) and DM2 (3.09\u00b12.56 vs 1.02\u00b10.24, p=0.028) after weight loss. We conclude that, whereas adiponectin receptor expression is not altered following weight loss, visfatin expression in subcutaneous fat falls markedly with weight reduction. In addition, adiponectin expression increases in weight-reduced diabetic subjects, possibly contributing to their improved insulin sensitivity.",

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the major saturated fatty acids found in coconut and palm oil on the expression of key inflammation-related genes (IL-6, adiponectin) in human adipocytes. Coconut and palm oils are rich in capric (10:0), lauric (12:0) and myristic (14:0) fatty acids; palmitic acid (16:0) is found in palm oil, and in meat and dairy products. Methods: SGBS adipocytes were treated after differentiation with 250 \u03bcM capric, lauric, myristic or palmitic acids. Further sets of cells were used for time-course and dose-response studies on the effects of lauric acid. Results: IL-6 mRNA level was increased by incubation (24 h) with myristic, lauric and palmitic acids, the largest effect being with lauric acid. IL-6 gene expression in response to lauric acid was increased in a dose-dependent manner (from 125 \u03bcM) and was very rapid (within 2 h of treatment). Adiponectin gene expression was increased by treatment with 250 \u03bcM myristic acid, but decreased by lauric and palmitic acids. Adiponectin expression in response to lauric acid was decreased in a dose-dependent manner (from as low as 50 \u03bcM); it was also rapid, occurring by 4 h. Conclusion: High levels of lauric and palmitic acid, as found in diets rich in coconut and palm oil, may induce an inflammatory state in adipose tissue and impair glucose homeostasis. Funding: This research was partially funded by CAPES (Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior, Minist\u00e9rio da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o, Brazil). Adiponectin is known to be protective against the development of insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between the SNP45T>G polymorphism of adiponectin gene (exon2) and adiponectine and insulin levels and lipid parameters in obese versus non obese subjects. Subjects and methods: the study concerned 112 obese subjects and 74 non obese controls. All subjects underwent a clinical examination, biological investigations (basal ad two hours blood glucose and insulinemia, adiponectin, total cholesterol, HDLc and triglycerides) and a genetic study of the adiponectin gene. Results: adiponectin levels were significantly lower in obese vs non obese (4.4 \u00b10.95 vs 8.7\u00b11.54\u03bcg/ml, p<0.001). We noted a higher frequency of the genotype GG in obese vs non obese subjects (8.1 vs 4.0%, NS), a significantly higher basal and two hours insulinemia in GG compared to TG and TT genotypes. There was no significant relationship between the polymorphism of SNP45T>G and HDL cholesterol levels. Conclusion: SNP45T>G polymorphism is associated with obesity and hyperinsulinemia in Tunisian population. Visfatin is a newly discovered adipokine found in abundance in visceral fat... Recent studies indicated that visfatin is one of the inflammatory cytokines as it is known for leptin. Obesity is associated with a low-grade inflammation of white adipose tissue resulting from chronic activation of the innate immune system which can subsequently lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. It is still not clear role of acquired immune response in obesity and related comorbidites such as asthma, cancer or autoimmune diseases. The aim of our study was to assess the association between visfatin and leptin levels in circulation and IL-17, IL-23 and MIF (macrophage migration inhibitory factor). In that order, thirty obese women (BMI =35.59\u00b10.83 kg/m 2 , age=35.53\u00b11.59 yrs) 15 healthy control women (BMI=20.43\u00b10.66 kg/m 2 , age=27.87\u00b10.77 yrs) were included in the study. In each of the investigated subjects, following parameters were measured: Visfatin (EIA Phoenix, ng/ml), Leptin (Linco RIA, ng/ml), circulating Il-17, IL-23 and MIF (macrophage migration inhibitory factor, pg/ml). In separate subgroups (obese and control nonobese women) there was no correlation among investigated parameters except between leptin and BMI (r=0,612, p<0.001). In all investigated women (obese + nonobese) using Spearman's correlation analysis significant positive correlation was found between leptin levels and BMI (r=0.844 p<0.001), leptin and p<0.02 ) and between Il-17 and IL-23 (r=0.506, P<0.05). There was no significant correlation between visfatin and BMI, leptin, IL-17, IL-23 and MIF, , respectively. According our results leptin seems to be a better marker of inflammatory state than visfatin in obese women. Positive correlation between IL-17 and BMI suggests further investigation in order to elucidate relationship between acquired immunity and obesity and obesity-related disorders. Obese adults have raised levels of circulating inflammatory markers, which may contribute to the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease; however, results from studies in children are conflicting. In this study we measured inflammatory markers in a longitudinal cohort of lean and overweight healthy children, aged 7 and 14 yrs. In 1996, 103 (54 males) children were recruited from western Sydney at baseline (7.9 \u00b1 0.6yrs) and at follow-up 7 years later (14.9 \u00b1 0.2yrs). At both time periods, height and weight were measured and serum interleukin (IL)-6 & IL-8 levels determined. Overweight (owt) and obesity (ob) were defined using the International Obesity TaskForce criteria. Preliminary results show no significant differences in IL-6 (pg/ml) between owt/ob children and lean children at baseline [owt/ob (n=20) median (interquartile range)=2.27 (0.92-3.83); lean (n=60) =1.99 (1.14-3.46)] and follow-up [owt/ob (n=32)= 8.99 (7.85-11.43); lean (n=47)=8.51 (8.18-9.77)]. Similar findings were seen for IL-8 (pg/ml) at baseline [owt/ob (n=20)= 17.3 (8.7-21.7); lean (n=78) =12.6 (8.6-21.7)] and follow-up [owt/ob (n=37)= 23.2 (15.0-29.8); lean (n=65) =20.7 (13.2-27.7)]. There were no correlations between IL-6 and 8 levels and BMI z score at baseline or follow-up.",

Adiponectin is an adipocytokine which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Several association studies have already found SNPs in this gene to be associated with BMI. We set out to perform an association study with SNPs spread throughout the APM1 gene to see whether this gene is also involved in the development of obesity in our population. Six haplotype tagging SNPs were genotyped in 223 premenopausal obese women and 87 female controls. After comparison of the allele frequencies between patients and controls, it was clear that the SNP45 wild-type T allele was more common in patients (89% vs 82 %, p = 0,011). The calculated OR was 1,87 with p = 0,011. None of the other genotyped SNPs showed an allele frequency difference between cases and controls. When looking at haplotypes, we saw that the SNP45/SNP712 haplotype was also significantly associated to obesity in our population (p = 0,004). In order to identify the causative SNP, we performed resequencing on 96 individuals. Resequencing of exon 2, exon 3 and intron 2 did not reveal any SNPs in high LD with SNP45. Therefore, we conclude that SNP45 itself is responsible for the observed association.",

SB holds a specialization scholarship from the \"Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT-Vlaanderen)\". Fasting proinsulin and leptin were measured before and after 3 months of orlistat therapy (120mg tid). No other treatment of POS was performed. Results: Compared with controls (healthy age-matched women without POS; mean normal proinsulin values=0.7-6.0pmol/l), proinsulin levels before treatment were significantly increased irrespective of weight: with normal weight 13.9\u00b11.9pmol/l, in overweight 14.1\u00b12.3, in obese 21.3\u00b15.8. After treatment, proinsulin decreased significantly in all groups: 8.5\u00b11.2; 8.1\u00b11.2 and 6.9\u00b11.3, respectively (p<0.05). Leptin concentrations before treatment were significantly decreased in all groups (normal control values=2.9-5.0\u03bcg/l): with normal weight 2.1\u00b10.6\u03bcg/l, in overweight 1.8\u00b10.6, in obese 2.1\u00b10.2. After treatment, leptin increased significantly in the normal weight group 3.6\u00b10.2\u03bcg/l (p<0.05), and in the 2 other groups there was a non-significant increase: 2.4\u00b10.9 and 2.7\u00b11.3, respectively. In most (16) patients in each of the 3 groups menstrual cyclicity and ovulatory cycle restoration were observed. In addition, pregnancy occurred in one overweight woman. Conclusion: In POS, proinsulin is increased and leptin is decreased independently of BMI. Orlistat 120mg is effective in the improvement of these changes and is a useful adjunct in POS treatment.

This study compared whole blood clotting kinetics in patients with 1) NAFLD (n=28); 2) obese controls without NAFLD (n=27); and 3) lean healthy controls (n=22). Methods: Clotting kinetics were assessed in whole blood using thromboelastography (TEG) . Results: Clot kinetics in patients with NAFLD showed significantly greater clot strength (maximum amplitude (MA); 58.3 \u00b1 6.3mm vs. 52.0 \u00b1 10.1mm, p=0.01) and reduced clot lysis in the presence of t-PA (35 \u00b1 30% vs. 51 \u00b1 26% clot lysis 30 minutes after MA, p=0.03) compared to lean controls. Clot strength was independently associated with body mass index in NAFLD, but not in lean subjects. There was a greater platelet contribution to clot strength in patients with NAFLD compared to lean controls despite similar platelet counts. Conclusion: Patients with NAFLD have disturbances in ex-vivo clot kinetics including increased clot strength and clots that are more resistant to t-PA-stimulated lysis. Changes to clot kinetics in NAFLD are platelet-dependent and not related to the severity of liver injury but rather to the degree of obesity. Oleoyl-estrone (OE) increases glucocorticoids and has no significant estrogenicity.

Plasma samples were supplemented with deuterated standards and then extracted with two sets of organic solvents and analysed by HPLC-MSMS. To measure estrogen levels, samples were previously derivatized with dansyl chloride in acetone. OE increased two-fold the basal levels of corticosterone, while dehydrocorticosterone levels increased in a lower proportion, raising their ratio from 9.8 to 11.4. Progesterone levels were under the limit of detection of the method. OE induced a dramatic decrease of both testosterone and androstenedione. Finally, OE increased basal estradiol and estrone levels by factors of x2.2 and x4.4, respectively. The increase in glucocorticoids agrees with their counter-regulatory effect on OE action. The excess of available estrone due to OE hydrolysis in tissues, is essentially converted to estrone sulphate, but part of the estrone is also converted to estradiol through the 17HSDH activity, which the relatively low estradiol suggests is inhibited by OE. This postulated inhibition results in the dramatic decrease in androgens. We can conclude that OE action on testosterone and estradiol is probably a consequence of its effect on 17HSDH, probably the result of a protective mechanism against massive estrogenization brought upon by the high estrone availability.

We aimed to study the sex-dependent response of adiponectin and resistin adipose tissue expression and circulating levels in the onset of dietary obesity. Male and female 4-week old Wistar rats were fed a control or cafeteria diet for 15 days. Body weight and energy intake were monitored. Gonadal (visceral), retroperitoneal (visceral) and inguinal (subcutaneous) white adipose tissue (WAT) depots were collected. Serum adiponectin and resistin and tissue mRNA levels were analyzed by Western blot and RT-PCR respectively. Serum levels of insulin, Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) alpha, and glucose were measured by ELISA and a glucose sensor. Insulin resistance was assessed by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Upon cafeteria diet, there was a higher increase in visceral than in subcutaneous fat, especially in females. The effective production of adiponectin and resistin (total levels adjusted per WAT weight) was decreased in the cafeteria groups (more markedly in females for adiponectin) associated with the tendency to lower WAT mRNA levels for resistin but not for adiponectin. Fasting glucose was slightly increased in cafeteria females. HOMA score was not significantly increased by cafeteria feeding, although it tended to be increased in few cafeteria females. Decrease of WAT adiponectin and resistin effective production seems an early response to obesity development under a high fat (cafeteria) diet, with sex-associated differences. This can probably be related with a physiological role of both adipokines modulating the insulin signalling system.",

HOMA was negatively correlated with \u03945 activity (r= -.454 p<.001) and HUFA omega6 (r= -.228, p<.05) only at normal fasting glucose status. Surprisingly, age was positively associated with \u03945 at both normal and impaired fasting glucose status (r>.4, P<.001 for both), but it could be driven by exogenous HUFA since such a pattern was only seen in HUFA omega3 (r>.5, P<.001 for both) but not HUFA omega6 (P>.05 at normal fasting glucose). This study indicates that reduced consumption of fish brought about by dietary transition among younger Cree generations may compound the effects of obesity which could reduce bioavailability of HUFA omega3 (through reduced \u03945 activity) and thereby likely aggravate disease risk.",

Male Long Evans rats (~350 g) were fed 60% of baseline food intake for two weeks (RF), which produced a weight loss of 71 g vs. ad libitum fed (AL) rats and, when AL was reinstated, 10-14 d of compensatory hyperphagia as body weight renormalized. Expression levels of leptin receptor (lepR) were measured in the arcuate nucleus (Arc) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) by qPCR, and plasma leptin levels by RIA. RF rats had reduced plasma leptin (2.7 \u00b1 0.6 ng/ml) vs. AL control rats (8.4 \u00b1 1.7 ng/ml). One d AL refeeding (RF-AL+1) increased RF rats' leptin to 5.2 \u00b1 1.5 ng/ml, although they still weighed 48 g less than AL control rats. NTS LepR mRNA levels were reduced in RF-AL+1 rats vs. both RF and AL controls. Arc lepR levels were similar in all groups. These preliminary data suggest that 1) RF down-regulates leptin signaling in the Arc and NTS by reducing circulating leptin levels without changes in lepR expression, 2) weight-loss induced hypoleptinemia begins to normalize during the first day of compensatory hyperphagia, before normalization of body adiposity, 3) expression levels of NTS lepR, but not Arc lepR, are down-regulated by acute hyperphagia, and 4) reduced leptin signaling in the NTS, but not in the Arc, contributes to weight lossinduced compensatory hyperphagia on RF-AL+1.",

The consciousness level measurement with AEP (AEP monitor/2 version 1, 61, Danmeter A/S, Denmark). Sedation was performed with propofol TCI (Target Controlled Infusion) 3-6 mcg/ml and analgesia with fentanyl. Servin's weight correction formula was adopted for propofol dosage maintenance. We evaluated: consciousness level -AAI scale, influence of muscular tone and surgical electrocoagulation on AAI, time to extubation and TCI value during extubation. Results: Level of AAI correlated with clinical depth of sedation and enabled to maintain proper dosage of propofol. The interdependence between AAI elevation and muscular strength return or surgical electrocoagulation during abdominal wall dissection were stated. In all patients the consciousness return based on AAI was adequate to clinical status and TCI value. The mean value of propofol effect site concentration during extubation was 2,08\u00b10,36 mcg/ml. The mean time to extubation were 12,69\u00b14,39 min.",

            "text": "The endocannabinoid system (ECS), commonly associated with the stimulation of appetite, has been recently linked with inflammation. There are two major cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, while both TRPV1 and GPR55 have been considered as putative third receptors. The aim of this project is to examine whether the ECS plays an important regulatory role in the inflammatory process in white adipose tissue. RT-PCR was used to define the expression of the ECS receptors in different cell types within adipose tissue. The regulation of the expression of the receptors was then examined in primary human adipocytes (Zen Bio) by realtime PCR. Firstly, a differentiation time course showed an increase in CB1, TRPV1 and CB2 mRNA levels of 500-fold, 30-fold and 5-fold, respectively, at day 3 post-induction relative to preadipocytes. In contrast, GPR55 was mainly expressed in preadipocytes. Macrophages (U937) expressed all four cannabinoid and putative cannabinoid receptors. TNF\u03b1 treatment of the adipocytes downregulated CB1 gene expression by more than 8-fold (at 24 h), and rosiglitazone treatment by 2-fold; dexamethasone induced a 4-fold diminution in TRPV1 mRNA level. Under hypoxic conditions, adipocytes exhibited decreases in CB1 (2-fold) and TRPV1 (3-fold) mRNA levels. Western blotting was used to verify expression of the protein in parallel with the receptor mRNA. It is concluded that CB1 expression in adipocytes is influenced by inflammation-related agents, which may indicate that this key cannabinoid receptor could be a target for the pharmacotherapy of inflammatory events within adipose tissue. Research related to this abstract was funded by the BBSRC. , age=37.53\u00b11.59 yrs, BMI after reduction body weight 31.86\u00b11.84 kg/m 2 ) were investigated twice, before and after 10% reduction of body weight achieved with lifestyle changes and hypocaloric diet. Following parameters were measured before and after weight reduction: leptin (Linco RIA, ng/ml), visfatin (EIA Phoenix, ng/ml), adiponectin (Linco RIA, ng/ml), fasting glycemia (mmol/l), fasting insulin (RIA, Inep, mU/l), CRP (mg/L), MIF (macrophage migration inhibitory factor, pg/ml) and HOMA-IR as marker of insulin resistance. There was a significant reduction in leptin levels (36,53\u00b18,11 vs. 19,82\u00b13,17, p<0 .05) and improvement in HOMA index (2,75\u00b10,31 vs. 2,00\u00b10,27, p<0.05). MIF was also significantly reduced 4923,25\u00b12021,92 vs. 1372,12\u00b1540,81, p<0.05). There were no significant changes in visfatin (78.06\u00b14.76 vs. 78.36\u00b19.38, p<0.05), adiponectin (5,51\u00b12,26 vs. 8,63\u00b12,49, p>0 .05) and CRP levels (4,44\u00b11,38 vs. 5,06\u00b11,70, p>0.05).

The inflammatory molecules produced by adipose contribute to the development of insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that human adipose express thrombin receptors (PAR1 and PAR4) and that thrombin stimulates a lipolytic and inflammatory cytokine response in human adipose predictive of cardiovascular risk. Methods: Human adipose were dissected and minced for whole tissue (AT) assays or digested for pre-adipocyte (PA) isolation. Pre-adipocytes were maintained in culture or differentiated into adipocytes (AD). PAR1 and PAR4 mRNA and protein were detected by RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis. IL-1 , IL-6, IL-10, FGF-2, VEGF, PDGF and lipolysis (glycerol production) were measured from AT (n=5), AD (n=6), and PA (n=3) supernatants after thrombin (10 U/ml; 24 hrs) treatment. Results: Thrombin stimulated lipolysis in AT (17%, p=0.01) cultures but not AD (10%, p=0.08). Thrombin increased the secretion of all cytokines in AT, AD, and PA cultures (P<0.05) for IL-1 (AT: 195\u00b174% and AD: 616\u00b1341%), IL-6 (AD: 3100\u00b11400%), IL-10 (AD: 158\u00b179%) FGF-2 (AD: 195\u00b1106%), PDGF (AD: 198\u00b128% and PA 635\u00b1131), and VEGF (AD: 401\u00b196% and PA: 634\u00b1131%). The direct thrombin inhibitor lepirudin prevented thrombin-mediated cytokine release. Discussion: These data indicate that thrombin PAR1 and PAR4 receptors are present and that thrombin stimulates lipolytic function in human adipose. Thrombin induces the secretion of pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors in adipocytes. Therefore, thrombin alters metabolism, inflammatory cytokine release, and may contribute to the chronic inflammation associated with obesity.

The molecular mechanisms regulating adiponectin production are unknown and there is controversy regarding the role of adiponectin during weight loss. Methods: Plasma samples were obtained from 13 morbidly obese subjects (BMI > 37 kg/m 2 ) at baseline and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after weight loss induced by bariatric surgery (i.e., Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or gastric banding). Seven matched obese subjects without surgical intervention and served as controls. Total and multimeric adiponectin concentrations were determined with a commercial kit (EK-MADP Multimeric Adiponectin ELISA Kit, B\u00dcHLMANN Laboratories AG, Sch\u00f6nenbuch, Switzerland). In addition, adiponectin multimers were detected by native SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Results: 3, 6,12 and 24 months after surgery, the respective increase in total adiponectin was 0.63 \u00b1 0.27 \u03bcg/mL, 0.99 \u00b1 0.23 \u03bcg/mL (P < 0.05), 1.7 \u00b1 0.39 \u03bcg/mL (P < 0.05) and 2.2 \u00b1 0.46 \u03bcg/mL (P < 0.05), respectively.

Compared to lean controls, obese fa/fa rats were hyperleptinemic, hyperinsulinemic and insulin resistant and had reduced RBP4 serum levels and mRNA levels in adipose depots, unchanged visfatin serum levels and reduced visfatin mRNA levels selectively in the inguinal adipose depot. Cafeteria dietinduced obesity resulted in increased fed blood glucose levels, a variable degree of insulin resistance, unchanged serum visfatin and RBP4 levels, and reduced mRNA levels of both adipokines in several adipose depots.

Mice lacking adiponectin display impaired hepatic insulin sensitivity and respond only partially to PPARgamma agonists. Adiponectin-mediated metabolic improvements are related the prevention of ectopic lipid deposition and alleviation of dyslipidemia. A modest increase in circulating adiponectin levels leads to an activation of PPARgamma targets and reduction of liver steatosis at the expense of a massive expansion of adipose tissue in ob/ob mice. To study whether the ameliorated lipoprotein profile affects the formation of atherosclerotic lesions, we crossed mice over-expressing adiponectin with LDL-R receptor deficient (LDLR KO) mice. Although these mice have reduced triglyceride-rich lipoprotein and cholesterol levels, the amount of atherosclerosis is unaffected. Surprisingly, increased adiponectin levels are not sufficient to prevent or delay the accumulation of cholesterol in the aortic walls or to reduce plaque volume in the aortic root. A similar phenotype is observed in LDLR KO mice that are adiponectin deficient. A cholesterol rich diet leads to substantial atherosclerosis, albeit the lack of adiponectin does not accelerate the process. In both cases the phenotype may reflect a limitation related to rodent models. Nonetheless, adiponectin Visceral obesity has been suggested to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD); the role of adipokines in the risk for CVD is less clear. This study was performed to test the predictive value of anthropometric parameters, adipokines and visceral obesity for the risk of CVD. A cross-sectional analysis of apparently healthy males (n=116) and females (n=175) for evaluation of clinical, laboratory, and anthropometric parameters was undertaken. Abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues (SAT and VAT) were measured by computed tomography. Adipokines, including retinol binding protein (RBP) 4 and adiponectin, were also determined. The risk for CVD was estimated using the 10-year Framingham Coronary Heart Disease Risk Point scale (10-y FCRP). All features studied contributed to the morbidity associated with an increase in VAT. The 10-y FCRP was significantly correlated with VAT ( =0.123, P=0.049) and RBP4 ( =0.230, P<0.001), after adjustment for age, gender and BMI. The magnitude of the increased the 10-y FCRP correlated with VAT and RBP4 independent of obesity. In a multiple linear regression model, the serum levels of RBP4 at a given BMI and VAT significantly correlated with the 10-y FCRP ( =0.123, P<0.001). does exert major cardioprotective effects leading to a significant reduction of tissue fibrosis in the heart of LDLR KO mice. This suggests that the actions of adiponectin on the cardiovascular system are complex and at multifaceted, with a minimal direct impact on atherosclerotic plaque formation in the murine model. Funding: This work was supported by funding from the American Heart Association The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between adiponectin and cardiometabolic risk factors and cardiovascular complications, as well as the link between plasma levels of adiponectin and expression of adiponectin gene in visceral adipose tissue, in a group of obese patients. Patients and methods: 40 patients with severe obesity were evaluated. The assessment included clinical parameters (waist, BMI) and paraclinical (lipid profile, HOMA-R index) tests, as well as determination of plasma adiponectin level (ELISA method). Common carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was bilaterally evaluated by Doppler ultrasound (UF 850XTD Tellus).Visceral adipose tissue was obtained during bariatric surgery and we quantified the variation of expression of adiponectin gene (by RT-PCR, using HPRT as reference gene). Patients were divided in 2 groups: with (26) and without (14 patients) metabolic syndrome (MetS) Results: Plasma adiponectin levels were lower in metabolic syndrome patients (15.57\u00b16.73 vs 18.54\u00b17.04 ng/ml). There was a positive correlation between adiponectin and HDL levels (r=0.603, p<0.01) and a negative correlation with waist circumference, triglycerides (r=-0.3) and HOMA index (r=-0.21, p<0.05). In patients with MetS there was a significant negative correlation between adiponectin levels and common carotid IMT (r=-0.44, p<0.05). Adiponectin expression in visceral adipose tissue correlates with plasmatic levels (r=0.33). Conclusion: Our results prove the existence of a significant relation between low plasma adiponectin levels and metabolic risk factors, as well as vascular complications. Visceral obesity role in the pathogeny of these changes is sustained by the correlation between adiponectin expression in visceral adipose tissue and its serum levels.",

            "text": "Interplay between macrophages and adipocytes: stimulation of secretion of adipokines and the role of endocannabinoids The concept of a chronic low-grade inflammatory status of adipose tissue during obesity is now widely accepted. This condition is regarded as a major driver for the development of cardiovascular-and diabetic complications. Macrophage recruitment and -activation is pivotal for the inflammatory process, and the different cell types and forms are involved in a complex interplay. We are investigating the regulation of intercellular communication, with special emphasis on the role of cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1) and CB2 mediated pathways. In order to study the effects of macrophage-secreted factors on adipocytes, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or different RAW264.7 macrophage conditioned media. The release of adipokines by 3T3 cells was measured by multiplex immunoassay. Macrophage-LPS stimulated conditioned medium enhanced the adipokine secretion of especially MCP-1, PAI-1 and adiponectin, whereas release of IL-6 was lower as compared to LPS treatment. No effect on TNF-\u03b1 secretion was observed. Moreover, an enhanced secretion of MCP-1 and PAI-1, but not IL-6, was measured after treatment with macrophage-stimulated conditioned medium (in absence of LPS). Macrophage conditioned medium but not LPS also increased lipolysis in 3T3-L1 cells. When studying the effects of CB1 and CB2 agonists on macrophages and adipocytes, no effects were seen so far on the TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 or IL10 secretion by macrophages stimulated with LPS. We are currently studying other ways of macrophage activation. By contrast, the cannabinoid agonist HU210 induced a 3-fold induction of triglyceride content without affecting adiponectin mRNA levels. The proinflammatory interleukin-18 (IL-18) is elevated in plasma of obese and type-2 diabetic subjects and might participate in the development of these metabolic disorders. In the present study we compared the expression of IL-18 and caspase-1, the key enzyme responsible for active IL-18 production, in adipose tissue and in liver of ob/ob mice and in mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) compared with ob/+ mice and mice fed a chow diet, respectively. Compared with ob/+ mice, the ob/ob mice displayed a 2-fold higher level of circulating IL-18, which was associated with a 4fold increase in IL-18 protein expression in adipose tissue, but only a slight increase (1.3-fold; p<0.05) in hepatic IL-18 protein level. There were no changes in circulating, adipose and hepatic IL-18 protein levels in HFD mice, compared with lean animals. Surprisingly, in ob/ob mice the marked induction of IL-18 protein in adipose tissue was associated with a decrease (1.6-fold; p<0.05) of its mRNA expression. However, caspase-1 mRNA expression and its activity were significantly induced in fat pads of ob/ob mice. In liver of both mouse models of obesity, IL-18 and caspase-1 mRNA expressions were slightly enhanced whereas caspase-1 activity was reduced. In conclusion, IL-18 expression in ob/ob mice is differently regulated between adipose tissue and the liver. In contrast to liver, IL-18 protein induction in adipose tissue of ob/ob mice is directly associated with caspase-1 activation, suggesting that caspase-1 might be involved in the regulation of adipose IL-18 production during obesity.",

Methods: Mice received daily gavages of: 0.15 or 0.5 g CLA / Kg body weight (CLA1 or CLA2 group). Experiment 1: Mice fed a standard (8.7%kcal%fat) or a cafeteria diet for 45 days. Since then, they received CLA1 or sunflower oil (control) for 9 days. Experiment 2: Mice fed a normal-fat diet (10%kcal%fat) and treated with CLA1, CLA2 or sunflower oil for 37 days. Experiment 3: Mice fed with a high-fat diet (45%kcal%fat) and treated with CLA1, CLA2 or sunflower oil for 30 days. Since then, they received a double dose for 35 days. Results: 9-day-CLA treatment did not cause any apparent effect on body and tissue weights or adiponectin and leptin levels in lean or obese animals. In experiments 2 and 3 adiposity, adiponectin and leptin levels were not affected by CLA1 treatment. CLA2 treatment reduced adiposity, although did not attain significantly differences in body weight gain. CLA2 groups showed plasma leptin (22%) and adiponectin (27%) reductions in animals fed on normal-fat diet. Higher reductions were found in animals fed on high-fat diet (34% and 78 %, respectively). Conclusions: CLA treatment reduces adiposity more than body weight gain. The fact that adiponectin and leptin circulating levels reflects the effect of CLA on adiposity when no changes were observed on body weight gain reveals their potential role as early biomarkers of CLA effects.",

Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of partial sleep deprivation on insulin sensitivity and the regulation of energy balance. Methods: In a controlled intervention, 14 healthy women (age 23-38 years, BMI 20.0-36.6kg/m 2 ) were investigated after 2 nights of >8h sleep/night (T0), after 4 nights of consecutively increasing sleep curtailment (7h, 6h, 6h and 4h sleep/night, T1) and after 2 nights of sleep recovery (>8h sleep/night, T2). Resting and total energy expenditure (REE, TEE), glucose induced thermogenesis (GIT), physical activity, energy intake, glucose tolerance and endocrine parameters were assessed. Results: When compared with T0, energy intake (+20%), body weight (+0.4kg), leptin secretion (+29%), free triiodothyronine (+19%), free thyroxine (+10%) and GIT (+34%) significantly increased with sleep deprivation (all P<0.05). Mean REE, physical activity, TEE, oral glucose tolerance and basal ghrelin levels remained unchanged, but the decrease in plasma ghrelin levels following an oral glucose load was reduced at T1. The effect of sleep loss on GIT, fT3, fT4 and cortisol levels was inversely related to fat mass. Sleep lossinduced variances in REE and insulin sensitivity were associated, an increase in REE was related to a decrease in insulin sensitivity (r=-0.73, P<0.01). Conclusions: Short-term sleep deprivation affects both sides of energy balance and leads to net weight gain. Sleep loss induced variances in energy expenditure were associated with fat mass and insulin sensitivity.",

In cold-exposed adult humans, involuntary muscle contractions during shivering are mainly sustained through the oxidation of carbohydrates and lipids. The goals of this study were 1) to examine the effects of cold exposure on changes in plasma IL-6 levels; 2) to determine whether these changes are accompanied by these in substrate metabolism during cold exposure. On two different occasions, 6 men (age 24\u00b15y; % body fat 12\u00b13) were exposed to cold (liquid conditioned suit perfused with 4\u00baC water). During each session, subjects ingested either LOW concentration (0.04g/min) or HIGH concentration (0.8g/min) glucose solution. Using indirect calorimetry and isotope tracer methodology, substrate metabolism was quantified. Plasma IL-6 was assayed from blood drawn at room temperature and every 30 minutes during 2 hours of cold exposure. During cold exposure, plasma IL-6 levels increased significantly over time (1.00 \u00b10.19 pg/ml to 1.80 \u00b10.42 pg/ml, p 0.05) regardless of the condition. Lipid oxidation (60 \u00b112 mg/min to 204 \u00b126 mg/min, LOW and 55 \u00b14 mg/min to 155 \u00b128 mg/min, HIGH; p 0.05) and plasma glucose utilization (50 \u00b15 mg/min to 192 \u00b115 mg/min, LOW and 40 \u00b15 mg/min to 256 \u00b122 mg/min, HIGH; p 0.05) increased in both conditions but to a greater extent in HIGH. In conclusion: 1-) plasma IL-6 concentrations increase during cold exposure and 2-) these changes are associated with increases in glucose and lipid utilization. Funding: Research relating to this abstract was funded by grants from Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are mitochondrial carrier proteins that increase energy expenditure thus decreasing body weight. Recent evidences suggested that UCP3, the muscle-specific isoform, is involved in lipid metabolism promoting fatty acids \u03b2oxidation and reducing their storage. We identified four novel mutations in severely obese (BMI-SDS>2,5) children with early obesity onset (<4y) from Southern Italy: three missense mutations V56M, A111V, V192I, and one non-sense, Q252X, that generates a truncated protein.",

We cloned human UCP3 cDNA wt in the expression vector p3xFLAG-CMV-7.1; mutants were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. Constructs were transiently transfected in HEK 293 cells, lacking of endogenous UCP3. Mitochondrial localization of wt and mutant proteins was assayed by western blotting. Activity of mutant proteins vs wt was indirectly measured incubating cells with 100 \u03bcM palmitic acid mix containing 16,7 \u03bcCi/ml of 3 H-labeled palmitic acid for 2 hours with and without \u03b2-oxidation inhibitors; 3 H-labeled water, produced by palmitate oxidation, was collected and measured at the end (1). All transfected proteins were correctly localised in mitochondria. V192I generated similar amount (97%) of 3 H-labeled water to respect to wt protein; conversely, Q252X mutant, generated only a low amount (20%) of 3 H-labeled water. Interestingly, children carrying Q252X mutation showed highest QR value (1, 05) Androgen deficiency (AD) alters body composition and contributes to increased adiposity. Determining the androgen status of obese men is limited by suboptimal clinical and biochemical measures of androgen activity. To test the hypothesis that obese men are androgen deficient and weight loss improves androgenicity, we conducted an 18 month lifestyle intervention in 20 healthy obese men. Morning blood samples were analysed for total testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, albumin and gonadotrophins. A now gold standard HPLC-Tandem Mass Spectrometry method was used for measuring testosterone concentration. An in-house androgen receptor-driven Dual-Luciferase Reporter Bioassay was used to measure androgen bioactivity. At baseline, both total and calculated free testosterone correlated negatively with body fat measured by DEXA (r=-0.592 and -0.537, p<0.05) and positively with fitness using indirect calorimetry during a graded exercise test (r=0.492, p<0.05). There was no correlation with clinical measures including symptoms of AD, hand grip strength and testicular volume. After lifestyle intervention, participants lost 7.4\u00b15.2 % (9.0\u00b16.3kg) of body weight (p<0.001). There was no significant change in testosterone or androgen bioactivity. This may be related to a significant increase in SHBG (3.3\u00b14.4nmol/L) offset by a similar decrease in albumin (6.7\u00b18.4g/L) (p<0.005). We conclude that clinically achievable weight loss in obese men does not alter androgenicity as assessed by comprehensive biochemical and clinical measurements. Despite this, clinical symptoms of AD and hand grip strength improved significantly (P<0.05), possibly due to improved overall well being and fitness. These data suggest that adiposity does not directly alter the gonadal axis or androgen action. In athletes and lean healthy men, intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) are an intracellular source of energy during exercise. IMCL content is increased in trained as well as obese individuals, and is associated with insulin resistance. Androgen deficiency (AD) reduces strength and endurance. Whether the biochemical partial AD of obesity alters the storage or utilisation of IMCL in acute exercise, thereby contributing to reduced endurance, is unknown. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a cross sectional study on 18 healthy community dwelling obese men with a mean weight of 120.9\u00b117.4kg and examined the relationship between blood testosterone levels with IMCL storage and utilisation. IMCL was measured before and after an hour-long session of exercise by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. Early morning blood samples were analysed for total testosterone (by gold standard Isotope Dilution Liquid Chromatography -Tandem Mass Spectrometry), sex hormone binding globulin, albumin and gonadotrophins (by immunoassay). Total testosterone was inversely correlated with percentage of body fat (DEXA) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA) (r=-0.59 and -0.48, respectively) but positively with fitness independent of fat free mass (r=0.49) (each p<0.05). Calculated free testosterone correlated negatively with IMCL stores (r= -0.57) whereas total and free testosterone both predicted a reduced ability to mobilise IMCL during acute exercises (r=-0.53 and -0.61) (each p<0.05). We propose that androgen replete obese men are more insulin sensitive, store less IMCL and therefore have less IMCL stores to be utilised during acute exercise than those who are androgen deficient. Background: Protein-rich diets spare fat free mass (FFM) during energy restriction and weight loss and gain FFM at the cost of fat mass (FM) during weightmaintenance thereafter. Objective: To examine if there is a FFM-sparing effect with a high protein diet without the trigger of intervention, thus in energy balance. Design: The 4-compartment body-composition; FM, bone mass content (BMC), water and protein mass of 25 subjects (BMI 22.07\u00b11.71kg/m 2 ) and blood parameters were assessed before and after a 3-months dietary-intervention of 2MJ supplements of protein, or carbohydrate or fat, as exchange with 2MJ of habitual energy intake, thus creating a range in protein intake of 96-203% of individual's protein needs. Protein intake was calculated based on 24-hour nitrogen. Results: On average, subjects were in energy balance and did not change their physical activity over time. Change in body weight ( BW) ranged between -1.23kg and +1.93kg. FFM increased significantly by 0.73kg (P=0.033), independently of BW. Independently of BW, protein intake explained 24% of variation in %FFM (P=0.047), while habitual leisure-time physical activity explained 45% (P=0.009). Protein intake explained 29% of variation in BMC (P=0.030). FM decreased by 0.34kg. Trunk %FM was negatively related to protein intake (r=-0.598, P=0.014). Fasting FFA concentrations were positively related to FM and negatively to P=0.013) . HDL concentration was a function of protein intake (r=0.647, P=0.009). Conclusion: A 50% elevation in protein intake of individual's protein needs increased FFM independently of BW, with additional positive effects on lipid and bone characteristics.

Obesity is associated with changes in these functions and with an increased inflammatory state, often leading to a range of complications. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of a short-term nutritional intervention on gene expression in adipose tissue from lean and overweight subjects. Therefore, gene expression profiles were measured in abdominal, subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies from 9 lean and 8 overweight men after consumption of a PUFA-enriched spread or a control spread (40 gram of fat daily) for 9 days. Subcutaneous adipose tissue gene expression profiles of lean and overweight subjects were distinctly different, mainly with respect to genes involved in defense response and genes involved in metabolism. Adipose tissue from lean subjects showed a more pronounced and consistent response to the dietary intervention than adipose tissue from overweight subjects. In lean subjects, consumption of PUFAenriched spread resulted in changes in expression of genes related to energy metabolism. In the majority of overweight subjects, down-regulation of expression of inflammatory genes and up-regulation of expression of lipid metabolism genes might reflect a beneficial effect of the intervention. Individual response to the intervention in overweight subjects was highly variable and correlated to obesity phenotype markers waist-hip ratio and waist circumference, suggesting a link between body fat distribution and response to nutritional intervention. This study indicates that whole genome expression profiling in adipose tissue may help to identify relevant targets of nutritional intervention in obesity prevention or treatment.

The addition of concomitant WL to EX (WLEX), however, may have an additive effect on muscular efficiency during moderate physical activity. These effects remained after adjusting for changes in FFM. The proportion of energy derived from fat increased with EX. Conclusion: Exercise training, but not weight loss alone, increases metabolic efficiency and promotes greater utilization of fat during moderate physical activity in previously sedentary, obese adults. Serotonin 2C receptor (5HT2CR) signaling contributes to the feedinginhibitory effects of cholecystokinin (CCK ) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), but not leptin, in mice.",

Still unclear, however, is which feeding-control signals 5HT modulates and how this occurs in the brain. To investigate the role of 5HT2CR in the satiating action of gut peptides, we examined (1) the effect of null mutations (KO) of 5HT2CR on the feeding inhibitory potencies of CCK (1, 2, or 4 \u03bcg/kg, IP) and 200 and 400 nmol/kg, IP) and (2) the distribution of CCK-induced c-Fos immunoreactivity (cFIR) in the brain. The feedinginhibitory effect of leptin (1 mg/kg, SC) was tested as a positive control (Nonogaki et al., 1998) . Peptides were injected at dark onset. Food intake was measured every 30 min for 4 h. cFIR was measured 90 min after dark onset in separate mice without food access. All CCK and GLP-1 doses decreased food intake in WT, but not KO mice. Leptin decreased food intake similarly in WT and KO mice. CCK (2 \u03bcg/kg, IP) induced cFIR similarly in the PVN and Arc of WT and KO mice, but there was significantly more cFIR in the NTS of WT vs. KO mice. These results suggest that 5HT-5HT2CR signaling is necessary for the full satiating effects of CCK and GLP-1 and that for CCK satiation, the NTS is one site where integration with 5HT-5HT2CR signaling occurs.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolic responses to a standard preload when consumed after a standardized breakfast or extended fast. Twelve normal weight (BMI 23.5 (\u00b1 SD 1.7) kg.m 2 ), non-smoking males (mean age 24.3 (\u00b1 SD 7.3) years) took part in a randomised cross over trial. Subjects were assigned to receive breakfast (Rice Krispies and semi skimmed milk equivalent to 10% individual daily energy requirement) at approx 08.00 (NB) or miss breakfast (OB) in a random order after an overnight fast. A standard 250kcal preload (21, 39 and 41 % total energy from protein, carbohydrate and fat respectively and contained 1500mg acetaminophen as a marker of gastric emptying) was consumed at approx 11.00. Arterialized venous blood samples were collected at baseline (fasting), prior to consuming the preload, and at 15 minute intervals for 90 minutes following preload consumption. Plasma glucose and insulin response (iAUC) to the preload were significantly greater in OB trial (P<0.05). FFA were significantly different between trials (P <0.05). There were no significant differences in serum acetaminophen concentrations between trials, but rate of increase of showed a trend to be greater in B trial (P<0.1). Plasma ghrelin responses were not different between trials. The metabolic responses to a standard liquid preload are different when the preload is provided after a breakfast compared with following an extended fast. This aspect of study design should be considered carefully when interpreting results from appetite studies using preloads. Objective: The A-allele of a FTO (rs9939609) associates with obesity in Caucasians, but the function and pathway of FTO is unknown. We hypothesize that the FTO operates through an influence on energy expenditure (EE), and investigated whether the rs9939609 of FTO and physical activity (PA) and/or EE were associated, and whether an association between the FTO variant and obesity was dependent on PA and/or EE.",

Conclusions: Obese and gastrectomized subjects both have low ghrelin levels, but have different responses to fasting in terms of GH, NEFA release and ketone body formation. Therefore ghrelin is unlikely to explain the metabolic changes seen during fasting. Ghrelin induced a marked biphasic response in NEFA, which may represent increased metabolic flexibility -low ghrelin may contribute to reduced metabolic flexibility in obesity. Epidemiological and clinical data indicate that almonds can be incorporated into the diet without promoting weight gain. This has been attributed to their strong satiety effects, stimulation of resting energy expenditure and limited bioaccessibility of the fat they contain. The mechanisms responsible for these properties have not been elucidated. The present cross-over design study focused on the role of mastication. Following an overnight fast, 13 healthy adults chewed 55g of almonds 10 (C10), 25 (C25) or 40 (C40) times while blood was collected via catheter and appetite was monitored on visual analog scales for 6 hours. Following this, all foods were provided to participants for the next 4 days including daily 55g almond portions that were consumed under the same chewing conditions. Complete fecal samples were collected. This was repeated for each chewing condition in randomized order with a 1 week washout between trials. Hunger was suppressed below baseline longer with C25 compared to C40 (p=0.01) and tended to be lower compared to C10 (p=0.057 Background: More than two thirds of US adults are overweight or obese. Although socioeconomic factors play a role in the differences in obesity between ethnic groups, genetic factors and nutrient intake should also be examined. Methods: Using food frequency questionnaires on 3000 White Americans and 1200 Asian Americans we investigated the role nutrient intake on BMI. We also compared the role of 22 genetic polymorphisms reported in the literature to be involved in nutrient metabolism or obesity. Results: Intake of vitamin B and E supplements, caffeine, saturated fat and refined carbohydrates was much higher in Whites (p<1 x 10 -20 ) than in Asians. Intake of cruciferous vegetables, vitamin A and allium was significantly higher in Asians. Some consistent effects were seen in both ethnic groups: the odds ratio for obesity for each additional SD of saturated fat intake was 1.49 (95%CI 1.26-1.76) in whites and 1.46 (95%CI 1.10-1.95) in Asians. For vitamin A the values were OR=0.82 (95%CI 0.71-0.99) in whites and OR=0.53 (95%CI 0.32-0.88) in Asians. Only a variant in the GSTP1 gene was significantly associated with BMI in whites, and a variant at the CBS gene in Asians. However, a different GSTP1 variant was significantly associated with BMI in whites but only among individuals with low vitamin A intake and not in those with high intake. Conclusions: The role of vitamin A on obesity is consistent with results from animal models. Our data illustrate the complexity of genetic and nutrient determinants of BMI and obesity, and show consistent patterns in two ethnic groups. 1.

            "text": "York D, Boghossian S, Park MJ, Lemmon K Utah State University Insulin has been suggested as a longterm regulator of energy balance, acting on the arcuate-paraventricular pathways to inhibit food intake and regulate energy metabolism. Insulin receptors are widely expressed in the brain, including in other areas, such as the amygdala, that are affect feeding behavior. The purpose of this study was to investigate if insulin was effective within the amygdala to inhibit food intake and if this response was influenced by dietary fat composition. Male Sprague-Dawley and S5B/Pl rats adapted to a low fat (10% energy) or high fat (40% energy) diet for 10 days after surgical implantation of guide cannulas to deliver drugs to the central bed nucleus of the amygdala (CBNA) or the third ventricle to deliver drugs to the arcuate -PVN region. In our experiments, insulin (4 or 8mU) given ic3v had no effect on food intake. In contrast, insulin (8mU) delivered onto the CBNA significantly inhibited food intake of SD rats fed the low fat diet over a 24 hour period. This effect was not observed in SD rats fed the high fat diet. Insulin tolerance tests indicated peripheral insulin resistance in these rats. Likewise S5B rats showed a CBNA insulin response that was diet dependent but in this case there was no evidence of peripheral insulin resistance on the high fat diet. These data suggest the CBNA as a site of insulin anorectic action and that central insulin resistance may develop in parallel to (SD rats) or before (S5B/Pl rats) peripheral insulin resistance. Introduction: Ghrelin and leptin are hormones, involved in the regulation of appetite and food intake. Ghrelin is derived from the stomach and has orexigenic effect, whereas leptin is secreted by the fat tissue and decreases appetite. It is still unclear how fructose-rich diet affects the plasma levels of ghrelin and leptin. Aim: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of fructose on the plasma and hypothalamic expression of ghrelin and leptin.",

            "text": "We used 20 male Wistar rats. Rats were divided into two groups: the first group (experimental, n=10) received a 10 % fructose solution plus chow food; the second group (control, n=10) was fed with standard chow food ad libitum. Both groups were fed for a 13 -week period. Body weight was measured every week. At the end of the nutritional period rats were anesthetized and decapitated. Blood was collected for biochemical measurement of triglycerides, cholesterol and glucose. Hypothalamus and plasma were taken for determination of ghrelin and leptin with ELISA (Biovendor) and Western Blot methods. Results: At the end of the 13 th week body weight of the experimental group was significantly higher than the control group. Moreover, the plasma triglycerides and cholesterol levels were increased in the experimental group. Fructose administration in drinking water induces obesity and changes in lipid metabolism. Our results demonstrate the change of plasma ghrelin and leptin and difference in control and obesity group. Conclusion: Further investigations are needed to clarify the role of fructoserich diet on the plasma and hypothalamic expression of ghrelin and leptin. This study investigated the effect of the whey protein content of a liquid preload on subsequent food intake in men and women. Twelve male and twelve female non-obese healthy subjects completed four trials in a randomised cross-over design. All subjects were unrestrained eaters. Subjects were provided with a standard breakfast on the morning of each trial and then reported to the laboratory at 11am. Subjects completed baseline visual analogue scales (VAS) and then consumed the liquid preload. Further VAS were completed immediately post preload and at 30 min intervals for 90 min. Subjects were then provided with an ad libitum pasta meal. The preloads contained 0% (water), 12.5%, 25% or 50% energy from whey protein. Protein preloads were isocaloric (400 kcal) and isovolumetric. Following the 50% preload, male subjects consumed less energy at lunch than following the 12.5% and 25% preloads (P < 0.005). There were no differences in energy intake at lunch following the protein preloads in female subjects. There were no differences in total energy intake throughout the protocol in the male subjects but total energy intake was higher following the protein preloads than following water for female subjects (P < 0.05). Male subjects reported no differences in VAS ratings of hunger, fullness and desire to eat between trials. Female subjects reported higher hunger and lower fullness and desire to eat scores in the water trial compared to the protein trials (P < 0.05). Whey protein has differential effects on food intake and appetite in male and females.",

No studies have yet looked at the type of meal patterning that would maximize this effect. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine if timed preloads impact on EI, appetite, and PYY and GLP-1 concentrations. Design: Eight normal weight men (79.9 \u00b1 11.1 kg) participated in 3 full-day randomly assigned experimental conditions. In condition 1 (C1), subjects self selected their meals and snacks ad libitum. In condition 2 (C2), subjects consumed a standardized preload (300 Kcal: 40 % protein, 40% carbohydrate and 20 % fat) 15 minutes prior to lunch and dinner. During condition 3 (C3), subjects consumed the preload, at times that maximized their pre-meal fullness levels. During each condition, a standardized breakfast was served, while lunch and dinner were self-selected from a 5 item menu, and eaten ad libitum. Daily EI, fasting and postprandial appetite, PYY, and GLP-1 were sampled every 30 minutes for 9 hours for all 3 conditions. Results: No difference in daily EI, AUC GLP-1, and PYY was noted between conditions. Pre-meal peptide levels tended to be higher during C3. Desire, hunger, and PFC were lowest during C1 (P<0.05 While the current body of medical literature does recognize the surprising prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency, particularly in the overfat population, it does not provide conclusive evidence that replacing Vitamin D stores will result in favorable changes to body composition. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to prospectively examine the effects of Vitamin D repletion on fat-free mass. Overweight and obese patients from our Endocrinology Clinic will be screened for Vitamin D deficiency, electrolyte abnormalities, and renal dysfunction. Those individuals whom are determined to be Vitamin D deficient (as defined by a 25-Hydroxyvitamin D of less than 30 ng/ml) will have a baseline fat mass determination using a Tanita Body Composition Analyzer Goal Setter (Model TBF-310) and will be started on weekly, high-dose Vitamin D 2 (50,000 International Units) for a duration of 3 months (This dose and / or frequency may vary if the patient is known to have malabsorption.). Once Vitamin D replacement is complete, a post-treatment fat mass analysis will be performed (using the same Tanita Body Composition Analyzer) and a repeat 25-Hydroxyvitamin D level (along with serum calcium, phosphorus, and creatinine) will be drawn for comparison. We anticipate an enrollment of approximately 50 overfat, Vitamin D deficient patients, thereby powering this small, pilot study to reliably detect a 3% difference in body fat. We hope to demonstrate that the percentage of fat-free mass in overweight and obese Vitamin D deficient patients will be positively impacted by the repletion of Vitamin D stores.",

Sows were fed control (C, 12% protein), low-protein (LP, 6% protein), or highprotein (HP, 30% protein) diets throughout pregnancy. Birth weight was lower (P < 0.01) in LP (1.14 + 0.03 kg; n = 114) and HP (1.25 + 0.03 kg, n = 87) piglets than in C piglets (1.36 + 0.02 kg, n= 136). At day 1 of age, the percentage of subcutaneous fat tended to be higher (P = 0.10) in LP piglets (11.29 + 0.27) than in C piglets (10.6 + 0.27), whereas it did not differ between HP (10.6 + 0.28) and C animals. Concurrently, the specific activities of fatty acid synthase and malic enzyme, two lipogenic enzymes, were enhanced by 63% (P = 0.01) and 55% (P = 0.06), respectively, in subcutaneous fat of LP piglets compared with C piglets, whereas no differences were observed in these traits between HP and C piglets. Preliminary proteomic investigations using 2dimensional gel electrophoresis (n = 6 per each group) revealed 37 spots significantly different in abundance (fold-change > |1.3|, P < 0.05) in subcutaneous fat from LP piglets vs. C animals; 11 spots differed between HP and C piglets. Differentially-expressed proteins will be further identified, and eventually studied at 185 days of age.

However, its role remains controversial and little is known of its contribution to weight gain or changes in body composition (fat mass and %fat) in children. Aim: Evaluate the contribution of REE at 7y to weight gain and changes in body composition over 36 months. Methods: REE by indirect calorimetry and body composition by DEXA were measured in 179 children (97 boys) from the EarlyBird cohort, annually from 7y to10y. The effect of REE at 7y on subsequent change in weight, excess weight (SDS), and body composition was analysed using linear mixed effects models with body composition and age at baseline entered as covariates. Results: In girls there were small but statistically significant negative associations between REE at 7y and subsequent change in fat mass (~ -0.1kg/year/100kcal, p= 0.01), %fat (~ -0.4%/year/100kcal, p= 0.0002), and excess weight (~ -0.02sds/year/100kcal, p= 0.01). In boys there were no significant effects of REE at 7y on change in fat mass, %fat or weight SDS (all p> 0.34) but a small positive association was found between REE at 7y and change in weight (~ 0.2kg/year/100kcal, p<0.001). Conclusion: The association between REE and change in weight and body composition was small yet statistically significant, together suggesting with some certainty that REE has little impact on the wide variation in weight gain at this age.

Key words: school girls, nutrition education, knowledge, attitude, vegetable-fruit-dairy product Not total body fat, but especially fat accumulated in the abdominal site resulting in upper body obesity (UBO) seems to be related with increased metabolic risk. In a previous study we found that a nine day dietary fat intervention affected subcutaneous fat characteristics of lean and overweight subjects. In the present study we examined the differences in subcutaneous fat characteristics and fat metabolism in overweight men with UBO or lower body obesity (LBO). In a cross-over trial 12 male subjects (age 51\u00b17 y; BMI 28.5\u00b10.8 kg.m -2 ) consumed medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) (C8-C10: 65%; C16: 29%; > C18: 6%) or poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (< C16: 1%; C16: 28%; > C18: 71%) for three weeks, by replacing in total 60 grams of their normal spread intake by the fat supplement. Handling of the consumed fatty acids is hypothesized to be different in UBO (n=5; WHR 1.04\u00b10.05) or LBO (n=7; WHR 0.97\u00b10.02) men due to their fat disposition and the routing of these fatty acids. MCFA will be transported directly to the liver, while PUFA will be absorbed by the chylomicrons via the lymph and transported through the body to the periphery. The effect of the spread supplements on lipoprotein profile, protein synthesis (lipoprotein and adiponectin), fatty acid metabolism in blood and fat tissue was measured with stable isotopes ( 2 H 3 -Leucine enrichment; and U-13 C18 and 13 C4octanoic acid, resp.), which were supplied intravenously and orally. It is hypothesized that PUFA spread will preferentially dispose fat in the periphery affecting lipoprotein and adiponectin production. Results of the study will be presented at the congress. Obesity is a significant risk factor for metabolic diseases, such as atherosclerosis and heart disease. There is emerging evidence that excess adipose tissue, acting as an endocrine organ, may contribute to systemic \"silent\" inflammation. Therefore, our objective was to illuminate how further insight into adipose tissue metabolism could help identify nutraceutical ingredients which may reduce obesity related health risks. Excess adipose tissue produces and secretes circulating factors, or 'inflammatory' mediators that may act at distant sites as key modulators of risk for a number of chronic diseases such as insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, and dyslipidaemia. In obese subjects, levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFalpha, IL-6 and leptin were significantly higher compared to nonobese. Recently it was reported that even in normal weight subjects with body fat masses >30%, plasma levels of TNF-a and IL-6 were elevated. Epidemiology shows that weight loss as such does not reduce CVD risk, while fat loss does. Therefore, fat loss represents a safe method for downregulating the inflammatory state and may improve various aspects of health such as risk for diabetes or coronary disease. Evidence is growing that several fat loss enhancing ingredients, like green tea, guarana or CLA may help to sustainable counteract obesity related inflammation. More than 30 clinical studies have demonstrated that CLA, a naturally occurring dietary fatty acid, reduces body fat mass while maintaining lean body mass. While CLA may not reduce obesity induced inflammation per se, it may modulate the immune response associated with the chronic inflammation.",

Differently from anandamide, which causes overeating and stimulate lipogenesis by activating CB1 receptors, OEA decreases food intake and body weight gain in rats and mice through a cannabinoid receptor-independent mechanism. The effects of OEA on feeding are behaviourally selective and are due to the prolongation of feeding latency and post meal interval. A large body of evidence indicate that they are mediated by the activation of peripheral PPAR-alpha receptors, but the central mechanisms downstream to this activation that are still unclear. Data obtained mapping brain c-fos mRNA levels revealed that the systemic administration of OEA evokes highly localized increase of c-fos transcription in the nucleus of the solitary tract (which is in accordance with the peripheral action of OEA), the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and the sopraoptic nucleus (SO). The magnocellular components of both nuclei release oxytocin, one of the anorectic hypothalamic neuropeptides. During feeding, magnocellular oxytocin neurons, especially those in the SO, become strongly activated indicating their imminent role in meal termination. We hypothesized that oxytocin neurons, might play a key role in regulating energy intake after OEA administration. In agreement with our hypothesis, we found that OEA enhances the gene expression of oxytocin in both areas and that its anorexiant action can be prevented by pretreatment with a selective oxytocin receptor antagonist. Our data suggest that oxytocin release in the PVN and SO nuclei may be responsible for the mediation of the effects induced by OEA on feeding.",

Methods: Eight obese females consumed three iso-energetic meals of different macronutrient composition, a high carbohydrate (HC) (60% CHO, 20% protein, 20% fat), a high fat (HF) (30% CHO, 20% protein, 50% fat) and a high protein (HP) (30% CHO, 50% protein, 20% fat), on three separate occasions, 1 month apart. PYY 3-36, insulin and glucose were measured before, and 15, 30, 60, 120 and 180min following each meal. Results: PYY 3-36 levels increased significantly following the three meals with the HC meal resulting in a sustained postprandial increase in PYY level throughout the experimental period. Comparing the three meals, the HF meal induced a significantly higher increase in postprandial PYY 3-36 levels, at 15 and 30min as compared to the HP (p <0.05). whereas the postprandial increase following the HP meal became significantly higher than that of the HF meal at 120min. Postprandial increase in PYY was highest in the first hour following the HF meal, while that of HP meal was delayed by one hour. Conclusion: Increasing both protein and fat content of a meal may induce an immediate and prolonged increase in PYY 3-36 , resulting in increased satiety and its maintenance for a longer period of time.

Effect of a protein-containing liquid preload on voluntary food intake at a subsequent meal Lara J, Astbury NM, Taylor MA, Macdonald IA School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK Background: Recent studies indicate that certain types of milk protein (eg whey) may be more satiating than others (eg Casein). However, most studies on this topic have been carried out in normal-weight individuals and their replication might not be feasible in overweight/obese subjects. Methods: Six healthy men and two women, BMI 27-32 kg/m 2 , aged 18-45 yrs, not dieting and weight-stable during the previous three months were studied. Women were studied during the first phase of their menstrual cycle. The day of the study participants consumed a standardized breakfast providing 10% of their daily energy requirements. In a randomized cross-over design, 150 minutes after breakfast, participants consumed either a 250 kcal (40% of energy from whey-protein) or a control non-energy flavoured liquid preload (400 ml), with each being repeated on two occasions. Ninety minutes later, adlibitum food intake was assessed at lunch. Visual analogue scales for subjective appetite were scored every 30 minutes. Food intake during the remaining of the day was also reported. Treatments were repeated within a week to assess consistency of results. Results: Eating at lunch and during the remainder of the day was consistent for the repeated exposure of each arm of the study. Energy intake at lunchtime was 115 kcals lower after whey-protein, representing 46% of the preload energy content. No significant differences in appetite ratings were observed between treatments. Conclusions: Our results in overweight/obese subjects participating in a laboratory study showed consistency in ad-libitum and self-reported food intake.

Angelopoulos TJ University of Central Florida, Orlando, USA There is inconsistency regarding whether aerobic exercise training (ET) causes a reduction in leptin in weight stable humans. We speculate this may be due to the variability of leptin levels within the studied populations. The purpose of this study was to examine whether baseline leptin levels affect the response of leptin to ET Ninety seven previously sedentary individuals underwent a 6 month progressive and supervised ET program (60-85% VO2max, 45 minutes per day, 4 days per week). Blood was sampled for the measurement of leptin prior to ET, 24 and 48 hours after completion of the final ET session. All participants were instructed to maintain normal eating habits in order to maintain weight. ET resulted in a small reduction in body mass (80.47 \u00b1 18.03 vs 79.42 \u00b1 17.34kg, p<0.01). Leptin was reduced 24 hours post, but returned to baseline values 72 hours post (Pre: 13.51 \u00b1 12.27, 24hr: 12.14 \u00b1 12.34, 72hr: 12.98 \u00b1 11.40 ng/ml). We compared the lowest 10% (n=9) of baseline leptin to the highest 10% (n=9). There was a significant time X baseline leptin interaction whereby the highest 10% did not follow the typical pattern of increasing leptin between 24 to 72 hour post-training. We expanded the subpopulation to the lowest (n=24) and highest quartiles (n=24) of baseline leptin. Despite the larger sample size the time X baseline leptin interaction disappeared These data suggest that ET is successful in reducing leptin levels only in those whose baseline levels are the highest. Insulin sensitivity can be partitioned into basal (hepatic) and peripheral (muscle, adipose tissues) sensitivity. Adipocytokines are important fat mediators for glucose homeostasis in insulin-resistant subjects. However, relationships of abdominal fat with the basal and dynamic components of insulin sensitivity have not been yet elucidated. Aim was the assessment of possible relationships of adiponectin and leptin with these components of insulin sensitivity in overweight type-2 subjects (T2DM) with plurimetabolic syndrome. Methods: T2DM (5F/11M; 59\u00b12 yr; duration=5\u00b11 yr; HbA1c=6.7\u00b10.1%; BMI=29.5\u00b11.1 kg/m 2 ; waist=104\u00b12 cm; basal glucose=134\u00b15 mg/dl; basal insulin=9.4\u00b11.2 \u03bcU/ml; uric acid=5.3\u00b10.3 mg/dl) and 16 matched overweight controls (CTN) underwent a 75g-2h OGTT. Lipid profile was (mg/dl): cholesterol=204\u00b18, HDL=53\u00b13, LDL=119\u00b18, triglycerides(TG)=168\u00b127. Abdominal fat was determined as cardiovascular risk factor LAP [lipid overaccumulation=(waist-k)\u00d7TG; k=gender constant]. Basal insulin sensitivity was measured with QUICKI index and the peripheral one with OGIS. Results: LAP was 66\u00b18 cm\u00d7mM/L. T2DM and CNT adiponectin (7.4\u00b10.5, 7.8\u00b1 0.9 \u03bcg/ml), leptin (13\u00b13, 13.3 ng/ml) and QUICKI (0.39\u00b10.01, 0.39\u00b10.01) were not different (p>0.2); OGIS (317\u00b111, 406\u00b112.6 ml min -1 m -2 ) was lower in T2DM, p=0.0001. LAP inversely correlated with OGIS (R=-0.57, p=0.026) and QUICKI (R=-0.56, p=0.022) only in T2DM. Cytokines were normalized to BMI (adiponectin=0.25\u00b10.02; leptin=0.42\u00b10.08). Leptin inversely correlated with QUICKI (R=-0.45, p=0.009), adiponectin directly with OGIS (R=0.43, p=0.015), in all subjects. Conclusions: Lipid overaccumulation plays a major role in insulin sensitivity impairment. Adipocytokines mediate insulin resistance, but have different sites of action: adiponectin operates at peripheral tissues level; leptin is active mainly on fasting (liver) sensitivity and is not relevant in diabetic state.",

            "text": "Association of angiotensin-converting enzyme dd genotype with diminished thermogenesis in response to acute cold exposure in healthy children Nagai, N 1 , Sakane, N 2 , Kotani, K 2 , Kimura, T 3 , Hamada, T 2 , Moritani, T 3 Introduction: The adipose tissue renin-angiotensin system (ARAS) contributes to regulation of fat mass and may also impact on energy metabolism. We previously reported that an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene affected the activity of autonomic nervous system (ANS) in healthy young females. In this study, we therefore examined whether or not the ACE I/D polymorphism was associated with cold-induced thermogenesis in healthy children. Subjects and methods: Twenty-two children (6-11yrs) were genotyped for I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene by applying a PCR-restriction fragment length using buccal samples. Resting energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry for 30 min under thermoneutral (25\u00baC) or cold conditions (10\u00baC) in an environmental chamber. The activity of ANS was assessed by power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). Samples of saliva were collected for cortisol determination at the end of experimental session. Each experiment was performed on 2 consecutive days. Results: During cold exposure, total power of the HRV, an index of overall ANS activity, as well as the salivary cortisol concentration significantly increased in the children with wild-type (II) and heterozygous alleles (ID) (II+ID, n=16); while no response was observed in the carriers of homozygous (DD, n=6). Moreover, the DD group showed a significantly lower thermogenesis compared to the II+ID group. Conclusion: Despite cold-induced sympathetic stimulation, the DD genotype had lower thermogenesis potentially through reduced activity of the sympathetic system, supporting the possibility that ACE DD genotype may be one of the genetic markers for future pathogenesis of obesity. Altered eating patterns and a shift toward night consumption has been reported in obesity. We questioned whether animals susceptible to DIO modify their eating behaviours. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats (n=29) were randomly given, ad libitum, high-fat (canola-oil or butter) diets or chow for 50d, followed by low fat diet for 28d and 40% energy restriction for 32d. By day 28, only rats (n=4) in the butter-fed group were categorized, based on excessive obesity index, as DIO-prone. Their behaviour differed from other rats: when switched from chow to high fat diets, they ate the same volume of food and increased their energy intake (61\u00b14 to 99\u00b14 kcal/d, P=0.001), and weighed more (P =0.027) than other high-fat fed rats by day 50; by contrast, canola-fed animals decreased food volume to maintain energy intake. DIO-prone rats had higher weight at baseline (P=0.044) than other groups, and greater abdominal fat volume and leptin levels (P <0.04) than other restricted animals after weight loss. During high-fat diets, DIO-prone ate comparable amounts of calories during light and dark cycles; during energy restriction, they kept food for later contrary to other food-restricted rats. In conclusion, DIO-prone animals develop obesity by failing to compensate for the increase in energy density, only when given a palatable diet, and eating more at inappropriate times; adjustment to diets reduced in energy density is also altered. These behaviours support the known associations between high fat diets and prevalence of obesity in humans and the therapeutic potential for low fat diets to induce weight loss. There is a tight connection between nutrition and health. Most of increased body mass and obesity problems, one third of all cardiovascular diseases and about 40% of malign diseases could be prevented by changes in nutritional habits and increased physical activity. The aim of this research was to evaluate nutritional status (on the basis of BMI), prevalence of chronic noncommunicable diseases, basic dietary habits, and physical activity of adults according gender (485 male, 2500 female). On line questionnaire was placed on a web pages of Podravka, one of the biggest food industries in Croatia, www.coolinarika.com. According the self reported mass and height and BMI calculated, 55% of participants had normal weight, while 42% of participants showed increased body mass. Among men, overweight and obesity were more common, while among women underweight and normal weight were more dominant. 15% of all participants were suffering of chronic noncommunicable diseases, men a bit more that women. The most common diseases encompass hypertension, heart diseases, diabetes, food allergies and thyroid gland problems. Most of the participants were occupied by sedentary activities 2-5 hours a day, and again with higher prevalence among men than among women. In conclusion, our results showed that women more often respect dietary recommendations, often eat breakfast and light meals, take more care of the foods choice, have lower BMI and lower incidence of the chronic noncommunicable diseases.",

The polymorphic effects of the RAS (insertion/deletion of ACE gene and A1675G of AT2R gene) on blood pressure (BP) and obesity-related metabolic changes in response to weight loss induced by low-calorie diet (LCD) with meal replacement drinks (diet's\u00ae, SUNTORY Ltd.) were investigated in 32 obese women (age 49.9 \u00b1 8.4 yrs). Clinical, metabolic and biochemical profiles were measured before and after a 2month intervention of LCD. RAS gene polymorphisms were determined with a fluorescence-based allele-specific DNA primer assay system. Although weight reduction and nutrient intake did not differ among the genotypes, subjects with the ACE D/D genotype and the AGTR2 G/G genotype remained unchanged systolic and diastolic BP, insulin, LDL-and HDL-cholesterol levels, triglyceride, and whole body fat oxidation. Importantly, the AGTR2 G/G genotype showed significantly less improvement of systolic BP (2.5 \u00b1 5.0 vs. -7.2 \u00b1 8.5mmHg, P<0.01), LDLcholesterol levels (-3.5 \u00b1 9.8 vs. -13.6 \u00b1 11.6mg/dl, P<0.05), and whole body fat oxidation (0.1 \u00b1 9.9 vs. 8.3 \u00b1 11.9mg/min, P<0.05) than other AGTR2 genotypes. Furthermore, reduction in body fat after weight loss was significantly less in ACE D/D genotype than in other ACE genotype (-0.8 \u00b1 1.6 vs. -2.3 \u00b1 1.4%, P<0.001). These findings suggest that the homozygous form of the ACE and AGTR2 gene could be a polymorphic marker predicting difficulty in improving BP and obesityrelated metabolic profiles following a LCD to induce weight loss in obese women",

            "text": "The energetic and cardiovascular response to walking and cycling in obese women Physical activity has a main role in obesity management, but exercise capacity is compromised in obese individuals due to excess of mass altering energetics of movements and to dysfunctions of regulatory mechanisms affecting cardiovascular responses. To compare the energetics of walking and cycling, and the related cardiovascular responses in obese individuals, in order to define the exercise modality most sustainable and effective for obesity rehabilitation and weight loss programs, 15 obese (OB) and 6 normal weight (NW) women exercised on treadmill (TM) and cycle ergometer (CE) while gas exchange, heart rate (HR) and metabolic rate (E) were determined. Net cost of transport (NCOT) was calculated for walking and mechanical efficiency (ME) for cycling. During walking, net E was 2.2-2.3 fold higher in OB than in NW (p<0.001), as well as net E/(body mass, BM) and NCOT (p<0.05), which correlated with BM (p<0.001-0.01). During cycling, net E was significantly (p<0.01-0.001) higher in OB than in NW (about +23%) and correlated with BMI (p<0.001). Net leg movement E depended from BMI and, when accounted for, no difference in cycling E between groups remained. While net ME was significantly lower in OB (p<0.001), work ME was similar for OB and NW (p=0.193). In both groups, HR was higher during CE than TM at the same oxygen uptake (VO2), but in OB the HR increment over VO2 was greater for CE than for TM (p<0.001). Due to body mass mechanics, TM locomotion in given conditions is much more costly for OB than NW. When accounting for extra mass, differences in E among groups are abolished for CE, indicating no obesity derangement of muscle efficiency, but not for TM, suggesting that differences in biomechanics may explain the higher E/BM and NCOT of OB. Nonetheless, due to different cardiovascular responses to TM and CE in OB, walking is more convenient, enabling OB to attain target energy expenditure at lower HR, or in shorter time. ",

Subjects and Methods: In a 10-week, European, multi-centre dietary intervention study 771 weight stable, obese (BMI >=30 kg/m 2 ) men and women were randomised to a high-carbohydrate (20-25 % of energy from fat; 60-65 % of energy from CHO) or high-fat (40-45 %E fat; 40-45 %E carbohydrate), hypo-energetic diet (-600 kcal/day). Of 739 genotyped, 622 completed the intervention with an average weight loss of 6.8 kg. Results: Adjusting for gender, age, centre and baseline value of outcome, we found significant interaction between rs7903146 (recessive effect) and diet in weight loss (\u0394weight) (P=0.023), loss of fat free mass (\u0394FFM) (P=0.032), waist circumference (\u0394WC) (0.023) and decrease in homeostasis model assessed insulin resistance (\u0394HOMA-IR) (P=0.001), but not in insulin secretion. Changes in obesity related phenotypes were similar for TT on high-CHO diet; and for CC and CT on either diet. In patients randomised to high-fat diet, the TT group \u0394weight was 2.08 kg (95%-CI: 0.50-3.65), \u0394FFM 1.3 kg (95%-CI: 0.19-2.42), \u0394WC 2.4 cm (95%-CI: 0.32-4.47) and \u0394HOMA-IR 1.26 (95 %-CI: 0.52-2.00) smaller than the CT and CC groups. The genotypes had a similar effect on loss of fat mass, but in an additive model. Background: Effects of reduced or more sustained postprandial glucose rises on appetite are inconsistent, perhaps due to lower energy availability of the carbohydrates tested. A true \"slow carb\" is completely digested in the small intestine but at a slower rate. We compared effects of a true \"slow carb\" versus rapidly digestible carbohydrates on glucose, insulin and appetite responses. Methods: In a 4-way fully randomised double-blind crossover design 35 normal weight volunteers received Slim.Fast meal replacement drinks with 15 g maltodextrin (control), or with maltodextrin replaced by 15g long-, medium-or short-chain Pullulan (LCP, MCP, SCP: 200, 23 and 10 kDalton, respectively). Appetite scores (6 line scales), digestibility (breath hydrogen) and (in an n=12 subset) blood glucose and insulin levels were measured for 5 hours. All parameters were analyzed using ANOVA and baseline values as covariates. Results: 77, 89, and 23% of SCP, MCP and LCP, respectively was digested in the small intestine, and at a slower rate than control. Breath hydrogen data confirmed the same pattern. Consistent with this, LCP produced the lowest, and control the highest blood glucose and insulin excursions, with MCP and SCP showing intermediate and more sustained patterns. All appetite scores were significantly improved after LCP versus control, while after MCP it was significantly improved for \"satiety\" only. All differences were apparent during the first 150 min. Discussion: MCP provided more available energy than the largely indigestible LCP, and can be regarded as a true \"slow carb\". However, LCP had the most consistent effects on appetite. We conclude that more modest rises in glucose have minimal effects on appetite, when tested in products only differing in carbohydrate digestibility rate and extent.

Objective: To evaluate the effect of TE on body composition. Design: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Danish multi-centre, phase IIb trial assessed the efficacy and safety of TE in healthy obese subjects. After a 2 week diet and exercise lead-in period 203 obese men and women (ITT population), 18-65 yrs of age and with a BMI of 30-40 kg/m 2 , were randomized to 0.25, 0.5 or 1.0 mg of TE or corresponding placebo once daily for 24 weeks. Body composition was assessed by DEXA, waist circumference and sagittal diameter. Results: Body weight loss was 2.3\u00b15.2% in the placebo group compared to 6.8\u00b15.9, 11.4\u00b16.3, and 12.7\u00b15.3% with increasing TE dose. Sagittal diameter decreased with 0.6\u00b11.9, 2.1\u00b11.9, 3.3\u00b12.0 and 3.5\u00b11.8 cm, while waist circumference decreased by 3.0\u00b15.7, 6.4\u00b16.2, 9.8\u00b16.0 and 9.8\u00b15.5 cm after placebo, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg of TE respectively.

Discussion and conclusion: Compared to placebo 0.5 and 1.0 mg TE resulted in weight reduction twice that produced by currently approved obesity drugs, of which ~80% could be accounted for by a reduction in fat mass. The concomitant decrease seen in sagittal diameter and waist circumference therefore indicates that TE is highly effective in reducing central obesity. Background: Increasing food volume with air or water can increase satiety and decrease subsequent food intake. We examined the effects of gas-filled version of a liquid food, prepared using advanced interfacial design technologies, on measures of hunger and satiety over 4 hours, with foods eaten as a single large serving or 2 half-servings. Method: In a randomised crossover trial, 24 subjects (age 42\u00b19 y; BMI 26.2\u00b12.4 kg/m 2 ) received isocaloric amounts of a standard or gas-filled version of a liquid meal, varying in volume and/or frequency of ingestion: (A) full volume liquid meal (325 ml, 190 kcal) at 0 min, (B) gas-filled full volume liquid meal (1000 ml, 190 kcal) at 0 min, (C) half volume of treatment (A) (162.5 ml, 95 kcal) at 0 and 120 min, (D) half volume of treatment (B) (500 ml, 95 kcal) at 0 and 120 min. Appetite ratings were measured for 240 min. Results: Both the full-and half-size gas-filled versions of the liquid meal significantly reduced measures of appetite vs. the respective standard liquid meals. Despite 50% less energy, the gas-filled half-volume meal also reduced appetite vs. the full volume standard liquid meal. Increased reports of gastrointestinal complaints were only noted for the full volume gas-filled meal (1000 ml). Conclusion: A gas-filled version of a liquid food, prepared using advanced interfacial design technologies produces a dramatically increased satiety response. This was observed when the food was given as a single large volume at 0 min or 2 half-volumes at 0 and 120 min. Adjustable gastric banding (AGB) is performed to produce a stable body weight reduction in severely obese subjects. The success of the procedure is highly dependent upon patient adherence to permanent dietary restriction and long term follow-up visits. In this study presurgical psychological and psychopathological characteristics were analyzed to predict the outcome of AGB in obese women. 125 females (mean age 41.2\u00b111.7 yr, preoperative BMI 42.6\u00b15.4 and postoperative BMI 31.9\u00b14.5) were administered the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) before surgery. Patients with alcohol abuse or taking psychoactive drugs were excluded. A statistical analysis was applied via a multiple regression analysis, with Excess Weight Loss at 24 months follow up (EWL24) as a dependent variable associated with scores of clinical and content scales of MMPI-2. Using a stepwise algorithm by backward elimination, only the independent variables Hypochondriasis, Fears, Type A, Low Self-Esteem and Work Interference were within the confidence interval of 95% with a R=0.47. To improve the goodness of fit, a nonlinear multivariate analysis, based on MNP, was then considered: R increased up to the value of 0.62. A clustering analysis was then performed to divide patients into quartiles according to the score obtained by the MNP analysis of the selected variables of MMPI-2. The mean \u00b1 SEM EWL24 was 35.3\u00b12.5 in the first quartile and it was 65.3\u00b12.8 in the fourth one. In conclusion, MMPI-2 scores processed by a non linear multivariate analysis based on MNP can be helpfully employed to predict the surgical outcome of AGB in obese women. Obesity is increasingly common in developed countries. Obese pregnant women have increased rates of maternal and neonatal complications, but few studies focus on morbid obesity (BMI>40) in pregnancy. Our aim was to investigate the incidence of pregnancy related conditions, method of delivery and pregnancy outcomes in morbidly obese pregnant women. We did a retrospective analysis of case notes of patients who booked with BMI > 40 from April 2006 to end March 2007 and compared outcomes with women whose booking BMI was within the range 19 to 25 (2282 women 59% total). Within this period 59 (1.53%) of all our deliveries [3845] were to women with booking BMI > 40. Of these 59 women, 5 developed hypertensive disease of pregnancy (9.2%, usual incidence 5%), 3 developed obstetric cholestasis (5.8%, published incidence 0.6%) and 4 gestational diabetes (6.7% compared with 3% in rest of obstetric population Morbidly obese pregnant women have high rates of pregnancy related complications including hypertension, obstetric cholestasis and caesarean section. Therefore they need increased surveillance during pregnancy and delivery.",

Most frequent side effects are related to sympathetic stimulation and psychiatric disorders, but clinical benefits related to weight loss may counterbalance these alterations. Anorectic drugs misuse has been reported due to malpractice and manipulation. There are very few well designed studies in literature to support the clinical use of anorectic agents nowadays. Objectives: The aim of the present study is to evaluate efficiency, safety and tolerability of diethylpropion (DP) in the treatment of obesity. Materials and Methods: Seventy obese patients participated in this two-phase prospective clinical trial. The first phase (0 -24 th week) was double-blind with patients randomized to DP 50 mg twice a day (n = 38) or placebo (n = 32). Fifty three patients concluded the 24-week protocol (31 in DP group and 22 in placebo). The second phase (24 -48 th week) was open with all patients receiving DP. Thirty three patients concluded the whole study. Results: Significant weight loss was found in diethylpropion group (-10,7%) versus placebo group (-3,1%). There was improvement in the metabolic parameters glucose, insulin, total cholesterol and triglycerides in the treated group (p<0.05). Blood pressure and cardiac rate did not change significantly. The psychiatric status (anxiety and depressive symptoms/disorders) was not altered after DP or placebo. Conclusion: According to our data, diethylpropion promoted a significant weight loss, improved some metabolic parameters and showed a favorable safety profile.",

The methodology used should be precise, accurate, accessible, and rapid. In this study the clinical utility of body composition assessment with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in a group of patients treated for obesity is reported. Fifteen subjects (ten women/five men; age 51\u00b110 years; BMI range 25-42) were followed during obesity treatment for 6 months. Lean body mass (LBM), fat body mass (FBM), and %fat were measured with a Lunar Prodigy DXA (GE Healthcare) at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Average subject weight decreased from 88,9kg to 79,7kg after six months. Gynoid and android regional %fat values decreased during treatment. Lean mass was also monitored and training schedules were adapted when a significant decrease in lean mass was detected. We conclude that DXA is a highly useful clinical tool for following patients under treatment for obesity. The Lunar Prodigy provides information on total body and regional fat distribution, lean mass and bone density. Evaluation of regional fat and lean values (e.g. android and gynoid), in addition to total body results, can help the clinician adapt individual diet and treatment programs. DXA body composition offers an accessible technology with very low radiation dose and rapid assessment. Purpose: Controversy exists over the effect of resistance training (RT) vs. aerobic training (AT) on fat-free mass (FFM) and RMR, particularly in overweight/obese individuals. This study was designed to analyze the relative impact of three training types (RT, AT, and AT+RT) on FFM and RMR in overweight women. Methods: Subjects were 38 healthy, sedentary, pre-menopausal, overweight women (38.9\u00b17.0 years; BMI, 29.3\u00b13.5 kg.m -2 ; %FM, 42.0\u00b15.5%; VO2max, 31.1\u00b14.6 ml.kg -1 min -1 ), who were randomized into three training groups: AT, RT and AT+RT. All groups trained for 60 minutes,3 days.week -1 , for 5 months. RMR was measured by indirect calorimetry. FFM was estimated with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Within-group differences after 5 months were calculated and ANCOVA was performed to detect differences between groups after training, adjusting for baseline values. Results: Significant reductions in absolute (RT: -205\u00b1215; AT: -181\u00b1229; AT+RT: -110\u00b1164 kcal.day -1 , p<0.05) and FFM-adjusted (RT: -6.75\u00b14.7; AT: -6.27\u00b15.4; RT+AT: -5.47\u00b14.13 kcal.kgFFM -1 .day -1 , p<0.001) RMR were observed.

            "text": "Evidence that ingested fat acts in the intestine to produce satiety originates from studies showing that intraintestinal infusions of fat decreases food intake more than intravenous infusion. Although some studies suggest that even small amounts of dietary fat can induce short term satiety, the satiating properties of orally ingested fat remain poorly understood. In this pilot study we determined the effect of phase separation of fat in the stomach to delay fat absorption in order to influence satiety parameters differently to that of emulsified fat. Six healthy young males were intubated nasogastrically on 4 different occasions (duplicate measures). In the ON TOP treatment (OT) subjects received orally a fat-free meal replacement drink (325ml, 145kcal) followed by intragastric infusion of 5g canola oil labelled with 13 Ctriolein, to mimic phase separation in the stomach. In the EMULSION treatment (EM) the drink contained labelled canola oil (5g) as a fine emulsion; saline was infused as a control. 13 C-oleic acid plasma appearance was significantly (p<0.05) delayed up to 1 h in OT compared to EM. C max and T max values of CCK were not significantly different between treatments; CCK AUC 240-480min. values were higher (p<0.05) in OT. Between-meal ratings of appetite revealed that hunger and appetite for a snack was diminished to a greater extent by EM than by OT up to 120 min postprandially. However, between 150-240 min appetite for a snack was reduced by the OT. These results indicate that 1) fat emulsions ingested with a meal replacement drink are absorbed more rapidly, whereas absorption of phase separated fat in the stomach is strongly delayed leading (2) to prolonged elevation in CCK plasma levels. The observations from this artificial application of fat suggest that the physicochemical characteristics of small amounts of dietary fat largely affect fat digestion and absorption; its effect on downstream physiological parameters however are much smaller, but could be of benefit in increasing satiety when successfully implemented in food products.

Low-intensity (LI) exercise is known to favour fat oxidation. The efficacy of high-intensity (HI) exercise is unclear in overweight subjects. We studied the effect of either HI or LI on fat oxidation (FO) during exercise and the 7-hours recovery period including food intake after exercise among overweight men. Ten healthy and sedentary overweight men (27.9\u00b15.6 years, BMI:27.8\u00b11.3 kg/m 2 ) cycled to ensure an energy expenditure assessed to be equal to 300 kcal at a LI (35% VO 2 max) or HI (70% VO 2 max). Subjects were fed (in energy balance) 30 min after the exercise bout with an amount of energy intake that did not differ from the amount of energy expended. From indirect calorimetry, Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) and oxidization of fatty acids oxidized (FO, g) were calculated over exercise, 30-min recovery before the meal and over 6 hours after the meal. During exercise, a preferential lipid oxidation was observed during the LI exercise session: RER was higher for HI than for LI trial (p=0.02) and FO was higher for LI trial (17.4\u00b12.2 vs 7.7\u00b11.1 g; p<0.0003). Over the 6 hours of recovery after the meal, FO was higher for HI than for LI trial (39.6\u00b17.9 vs 35.5\u00b15.9 g for HI and LI trials respectively; p=0.03). When considering the cumulative period fitted over the exercise period plus all the recovery period, no difference was observed between HI and LI trial. HI exercise could be considered for weight management of people, as HI does not impair FO compared to the recommended moderate intensity activity.",

The impact of a 16-week walking program on the metabolic risk profile of sedentary and weakly active postmenopausal women 50-65 years-old, whose body mass index ranged from 29-35 kg/m 2 was examined. Another aim was to verify whether ameliorations in their metabolic risk profile may occur independently from cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) changes or rather depend on body fatness changes. Methods: 153 women among whom 90 were sedentary and 63 weakly active (1h exercise/week) were subjected to 3 sessions/week of 45 min-walking at 60 of heart rate reserve. Body composition, resting blood pressure (BP), fasting lipid-lipoprotein profile and CRF estimated by O 2 max were measured before and after endurance exercise. Results: Sedentary women were heavier, fatter and had lower O 2 max at baseline (0.01<p<0.005), compared to weakly active participants. Endurance-training promoted comparable body weight and fat mass losses, waist circumference, BP, cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride level reductions, while it increased both HDL-cholesterol concentrations and estimated O 2 max, in both groups, similarly (p<0.0001). In the whole sample, metabolic risk profile improvements were not associated with increases in CRF but rather depended on reduced adiposity. Finally, women whose clinical features of metabolic syndrome at baseline were the highest showed the greatest ameliorations in response to walking (p<0.05).

The Three Factor Questionnaire (TFEQ)-R18 measures 3 aspects of eating behavior. Objective: We examined biological, psychological, and genetic determinants associated with weight loss using meal replacements. Methods: thirty-two obese female (n=32) followed an 8-wk diet with meal replacement drinks (diet's; SUNTORY Ltd.) under guidance by a dietician. Nutritional counseling focused on hunger and skills for coping with hunger. Counseling sessions conducted 4 times (at baseline, at 1wk, 4 wk, and 8wks). Body weight, body composition, leptin concentration, dietary intake (based on 3-day food records), attitude toward eating (measured by the TEFQ-R18), hunger score (measured with VAS), physical activity, resting metabolic rate (measured with indirect calorimeter), and polymorphisms of the ADRB3 genes were measured. Results: Body weight loss was 4.7+/-2.0 kg (6.7+/-2.6 %). Dietary intake was significantly reduced (2014\u00b1461 kcal to 1385\u00b1327 kcal). The cognitive restraint (CR) score was significantly increased after intervention (13.5 vs. 17.5; p<0.001), while uncontrolled eating (UE) and emotional eating (EE) scores were significantly decreased. The change in CR score was negatively correlated with weight loss (r=-0.681). Changes in UE and EE scores were positively correlated with weight loss (r=0.438 and r=0.475, respectively). There was no difference in weigh loss between genotypes. Changes in CR score were associated with weight loss independent of the initial BMI and ADRB3 Trp64Arg allele on multiple regression analysis.

Weight status variation was the difference between BMI z-score at the end of follow-up and at inclusion. BMI z-score was computed on the basis of the French references. Results: BMI z-score was 4.2\u00b10.6 at inclusion, 1.8\u00b10.6 at the end of treatment and 2.9\u00b11.18 two years after discharge. A regain in BMI z-score after treatment was associated with energy intake (r=0.43; p<0.001). Partial correlations adjusted for energy intake showed no association between BMI regain and mineral (Na, K, Ca, P, Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn) or vitamin (Retinol, D, E, C, B1, B2, B3/PP, B6, B9/Folates, B12) intakes. High intake of beta-carotene was significantly associated with smaller BMI regain (r=-0.26; p=0.04). Conclusion: Energy intake is the main factor affecting weight regain after treatment. A high intake of beta-carotene reflecting high intakes of fruits and vegetables appears to have a beneficial effect on treatment outcome. Background: A number of studies report that the intake of calcium and the consumption of dairy products may modulate blood pressure. Objetive: To determine the association between calcium intake and blood pressure in young overweight/obese women group following two slightly hypocaloric diets, independent of weight loss.",

            "text": "The study subjects were 57 women (aged 20-35 years) with a body mass index (BMI) of 24-35 kg/m 2 , randomly assigned to follow one of two hypocaloric diets: Diet V, in which the relative consumption of vegetables was increased, and Diet C, which involved increasing the relative consumption of cereals (especially breakfast cereals). Dietetic and anthropometric data were collected at the start and at the end of the six week intervention period. Results: An increase in dietary calcium density was associated with a reduction in systolic blood pressure of > 4 mm Hg (P 50 ) in diet V subjects, diet C subjects, and all subjects as a whole. The higher increment of Ca/protein ratio and the index of nutritional quality (INQ) were also protection factors in diet C. When only those women who were hypertensive at the start of the study were taken into account, an increase in the calcium density and the INQ for calcium were associated with a reduction in the sysolic blood pressure of > 4 mm Hg (P 50 ) (OR= 0.9496, 95%CI 0.9102-0.9908; p<0.01, and OR= 0.0049, 95%CI 0.00053-0.4676; p<0.05, respectively). Conclusions: Calcium intake could have beneficial effects on blood pressure and therefore cardiovascular risk in women following hypocaloric diets. Background and Aims: An increase in lipid storage as a consequence of feeding animals with high glycemic index GI diets has been observed by many authors. Fasting plasma ghrelin is lower in Pima Indians, a population with a very high prevalence of obesity, Tsch\u00f6p et al observed that fasting plasma ghrelin levels are negatively correlated with per cent body fat. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of diets with different GI on food intake, growth performances, fat deposition; fasting plasma levels of glucose, ghrelin and insulin. Methods: 20 rats were used, divided in two groups and fed ad-libitum for 21 days with different diets matched for macro and micro-nutrients, but with a different amylaceous fraction and therefore a different GI. Results: In rats fed high GI diet vs low GI diet was observed: increased food intake (18,9\u00b10,6 vs 16, 4\u00b12 grams/day; P<0,01); increased weight gain (28.8\u00b16,6 vs16,4\u00b16 % of initial weight; P<0,01); the % weight (related to total weight) of fat pads were higher ( 1,7\u00b10,4 vs 1,4\u00b10,3 %; P=0,05 ); total ghrelin levels were lower (41,1\u00b110,7 vs 59,5\u00b19,8 pg/ml); fasting glucose and insulin levels were similar. Conclusions: Ghrelin is one of the most important orexigen hormones; despite higher ghrelin levels, rats fed the low-GI diet did not increase their food intake, suggesting a decreased ghrelin sensitivity. These findings confirms an enhanced lipodeposition in rats fed the high GI diet; in the same group decreased ghrelin levels may explain the higher fat pad mass.",

Aim: The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship of visfatin expression in adipose tissue with potential hormonal regulatory factors such as insulin, testosterone and tumor-necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha\u2022 and the effect of the diet-induced weight-reduction on adipose tissue mRNA expression and plasma levels of visfatin. Materials and methods: Biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SCAAT) and plasma samples were obtained from 28 premenopausal women (age 38.7 \u00b1 1.7 years, BMI 27.9 \u00b1 1.4 kg/m 2 ), consisting of 10 lean and 18 overweight/obese subjects. The subgroup of 18 overweight/obese women (age 39.4 \u00b1 2.1 years, BMI 32.2 \u00b1 1.4 kg/m 2 ) underwent a 12 week hypocaloric weight-reducing diet. Biopsy samples were analyzed for visfatin and TNFalpha mRNA levels and plasma was analyzed for relevant metabolites and hormones. Result: Visfatin mRNA expression in SCAAT was negatively correlated with plasma free testosterone in all subjects (r = -0. 532, p < 0.01), plasma insulin (r = -0.469, p < 0.01) and BMI (r = -0.488, p < 0.01) and positively correlated with adipose tissue TNFalpha mRNA expression (r = 0.648, p < 0.001). The diet resulted in the reduction of body weight (by 8%): plasma insulin levels, free testosterone and TNFalpha were also reduced. Visfatin and TNFalpha mRNA expression in adipose tissue and plasma levels of visfatin remained unchanged. Conclusion: In obese females, visfatin mRNA expression in SCAAT is related to TNFalpha expression and to plasma free testosterone and insulin. This suggests the regulatory role of these hormones. Adipose tissue visfatin expression is not altered by a moderate, diet-induced, weight loss. Background: There is concern regarding both compliance to and adverse events (AEs) of weight loss compounds. Drop out from any cause can be interpreted as a composite measure for safety and compliance, and AEs as a general indicator of safety. Objective: To investigate the safety and compliance of orlistat, sibutramine and rimonabant. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed was performed (2007-11-07) . Data were collected from RCTs>1y (n=27; n patients =13685) using doses within the EMEA indication. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) for drop out were calculated by a random effects model. Results: Treatment with orlistat was associated with a significantly reduced risk of drop outs from any cause compared to placebo (Table) . Similar trends were observed for rimonabant and sibutramine. Rimonabant and orlistat resulted in significantly more drop outs due to AEs than placebo, while there was a trend of no difference in risk for sibutramine. The placebo groups showed similar drop out rates for any cause, but not for AEs, for the different compounds. ",

Method: A total of 79 obese but otherwise healthy men and women (age 36.6\u00b17; BMI 34.5\u00b14 kg/m 2 ) were randomized into three treatments groups: DIO (8 weeks very low energy diet (VLED) 600 kcal/d + 4 weeks weight maintenance diet); DEX (8 weeks VLED 800 kcal/d + 4 weeks weight maintenance diet together with 12 weeks supervised exercise); EXO (12 weeks supervised exercise without diet restriction). MRI technology was used to quantify the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous abdominal tissue (SAT) and the NCEP ATP3 definitions were used to define the metabolic syndrome. Results: Subjects in the DEX and the EXO group improved their VO2max with 15% whereas no change in VO2max in the DIO group was observed. A relative weight loss of 11% in the DEX and DIO group was achieved, with a trend to a higher relative reduction of VAT in the DEX group (P=0.08). A total weight loss of 3% in the exercise-alone group (EXO) was accompanied by a 15% reduction of VAT. At baseline the metabolic syndrome was present in 51% of all subjects (DEX 67%; DIO 42%, EXO 41%) whereas after intervention for 12 weeks the prevalence was decreased to 12% (DEX 14%, DIO 5%, EXO 18%) Conclusion: Regular exercise without diet restriction reduced VAT with 15% and decreased the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome with 25%. In combination with diet restriction, exercise has pronounced effect at body composition and the obesity-related metabolic disturbances.",

Method: Based on agreed a priori criteria, we searched electronic databases and secondary references for randomised controlled trials of treatments for adult obesity among participants with BMI>28kg/m 2 , and age>18 years, comparing at least one group-based to one individual-based treatment group, and follow up of at least one year. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and checked by the second. Meta-analyses comparing weight change in group-based to individual-based treatment groups were conducted. Results: Six studies fulfilled all criteria (two from the UK and four from the US), and were conducted by dieticians and psychologists. Included studies failed to report some important aspects of randomised controlled trials (concealment of random allocation, blinding, and intention to treat analysis). All studies stated numbers of dropouts, and reasons for withdrawals were described in three studies. Participants' ages ranged from 20 to 76 years, and BMI from 30 to 49kg/m2. Socio-economic data were reported in only two studies, and provision of training in group-based treatment delivery was explicit in one study only. We found a significant difference in favour of group-based rather than individual treatment at 12 months. Post hoc subgroup-analysis also showed that trial attributes associated with greater effectiveness were the use of financial incentives, the health professional being a psychologist, and participants being women. Background: In a previous 12-week study of obese patients, taranabant, a cannabinoid-1 receptor inverse agonist, induced significant weight reduction and was generally well tolerated. Here we present 24-week results from an 80-week randomized placebo controlled trial. Methods: 532 obese patients (81% female; BMI 27 to 43 kg/m 2 ; age 18 years) were randomized to taranabant 2, 4, 6 mg qd or placebo for 80 weeks. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in body weight at week 24. A subset of 200 patients underwent total body MRI for adiposity assessments. Tolerability was evaluated with clinical/laboratory examinations and reported adverse events. Adverse events were analyzed with a multi-tiered approach. Results: Baseline characteristics were similar among groups. Discontinuation rates were 32, 25, 24, and 21% for taranabant 2, 4, 6 mg, and placebo. Least-squares mean body weight changes from baseline at week 24 for taranabant 2, 4, 6 mg and placebo were -5.9, -6.5, -7.2, and -2.8 kg, (p<0.001 taranabant vs placebo). Percentages of patients who lost \u226510% body weight were 23, 24, 29, and 9% for taranabant 2, 4, 6 mg and placebo (p 0.005 taranabant vs placebo). Significant reductions in visceral adiposity were seen with taranabant. Taranabant (2, 4, and 6 mg) was associated with increased psychiatric, gastrointestinal, and nervous system adverse events at the system organ class level. Conclusions: Taranabant at all doses led to clinically and statistically significant weight loss at 24 weeks. Taranabant was associated with increased incidence of psychiatric, gastrointestinal, and nervous system adverse events. Research relating to this abstract was funded by Merck & Co., Inc. Predictive equations for resting energy expenditure (REE) are mainly based on a wide BMI range and often limited by over-/underestimation. We tested nine established and two new equations in severely obese women. Study group consisted of 160 women (age=41.3\u00b113.2y, BMI=42.8\u00b17.5kg/m 2 ) with a REE of 1919\u00b1129kcal/d measured by indirect calorimetry (REE-IC). Nine established equations were used to predict REE. REE and REE-IC were compared by Bland-Altman-Plots. New REE prediction equations were calculated by linear regression analysis, based on anthropometric (REE1) or body composition parameters FM and FFM by BIA (REE2) and were tested in a validation group of 33 obese women (age=40.4\u00b17.9y, BMI=37.2\u00b14.6kg/m 2 , REE-IC=1947\u00b1128kcal/d).",

The aim of the current study was to investigate the association of two CD36 gene promoter SNP genotypes with anthropometrics, dietary intake and lipid profile in subjects with excessive body weight during a weight loss and maintenance period. Methods: A group of 183 (95 male/ 88 female) individuals [Body mass index: 30.6 \u00b1 3.0 kg/m 2 ; age: 35 \u00b1 5 y] were genotyped for CD36 gene -33137 A/G (rs1984112) and -22674 T/C (rs2151916) promoter polymorphisms by pyrosequencing. Anthropometrical measurements and circulating lipid profile were measured at baseline, following an 8-week low calorie diet (LCD) and 6 months later. Dietary intake was determined before and after the LCD with a validated 24 hours weighted food records. Results: Both SNP genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05) and in complete linkage disequilibrium (D\u00b4=1.0). At baseline, the saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake tended to be lower in carriers of the minor alleles (G+/C+) (p=0.085), reaching significance at the end of the weight loss period (p=0.034). Six months after the end of the LCD, the minor allele was significantly associated with lower total-(p=0.032) and LDL-(p=0.014) cholesterol and higher HDL-cholesterol (p=0.013). Conclusion: These results suggest that in obese individuals both SNPs of the CD36 gene promoter are associated with lower SFA intake during a weight loss period, and with improved lipid profile in the subsequent weight maintenance stage.

Subjects: 267 patients (177 women, 90 men, mean\u00b1SD age 40.2\u00b19.7, BMI 41.9\u00b16.4 kg/m 2 ) remitted to an obesity intervention study initiated with a 12-w VLCD. Methods: 10 % or greater weight loss was regarded as successful outcome. Stepwise multivariate and logistic regression were used to predict 12-w weight loss, successful outcome and attrition. Women and men were analyzed separately. Potential predictors were anthropometry, eating behaviour, health-related quality of life and socio-economic variables at baseline. Results: 64 % of patients lost more than 10 % of their weight. Weight loss in successful women was 16.1\u00b13.5 % and in men 17.1\u00b14.7 %. Nonsuccessful women and men lost 5.8\u00b12.7 % and 5.9\u00b12.4 %. 12-w weight loss in women was predicted by higher number of children, lower educational level and better physical health (sum. score SF-36), R 2 = 12.7 %. In men, weight loss was predicted by better ambulation capacity, cohabiting and higher frequency of ice-cream intake, R 2 =39.4 %. Successful outcome was predicted by less psychosocial problems in women (OR, 95 % CI) 0.98 (0.97-0.999), and in men, better functioning in social interaction 1.02 (1.004-1.04) and ambulation 1.02 (1.003-1.04).

The increasing prevalence of childhood obesity in the Western world has resulted in intervention projects aiming to positively influence the diet and exercise habits of young people. Whilst there has been research into their effectiveness, there has been little consideration of participation from the child's perspective. This small-scale interpretive study employed semistructured interviews to explore experiences and perceptions of 10 pupils on a school-based intervention project. Consideration was given to the structure and content of sessions, and the nature, form and impact of participation. Analysis of the data revealed key themes related to: perceptions of the project; feelings about being identified as 'over-weight' or 'obese'; motivations to attend and adhere to the scheme; the impact of attendance; long-term expectations and impact on family members. The findings revealed a positive view of all aspects of the scheme, with the 'fun' activities, the inclusion of friends and the activity and diet task cards being identified as key motivators. Pupils accepted responsibility for the 'over-weight' label and welcomed the opportunity to positively influence their health and fitness. Attending the project had assisted when seeking support from family members; participants placed value on behaviour endorsed by the project and in making changes to exercise patterns and diet, gained pleasure from resultant feelings of control. Pupils assigned a high priority to long-term aims relating to more positive social interaction, loss of weight, and increased fitness levels enabling them to take a more active part in identified sports and activities.

Beta-glucan (BG) and fructooligosaccharide (FOS) are food ingredients proposed to act this way, but results so far remain inconclusive. We have tested FOS, BG, or their combination on hunger and energy intake during 2 consecutive days. Methods: In a 4-way cross-over double-blind randomized design 21 volunteers (BMI 25.9) received during 2 consecutive days, a Slim\u00b7Fast high protein meal replacement bar at 09.00h and an ad libitum lunch at 13.00h. On day 1 only, subjects consumed a second (identical) bar at 17.00h and a fixed snack at 19.00h. Bars (isocaloric) contained either 1) oats (control, 0.3g BG), 2) 1g added BG (using barley), 3) 8g added FOS, or 4) 1g added BG and 8g added FOS. To accommodate added fibres, all or part of the oats was removed. Hunger/satiety parameters (6 line scales) were regularly scored, and ad libitum meal intake measured. Bar viscosities were also determined under simulated gastric conditions. All parameters were analyzed using ANOVA and (where appropriate) baseline values as covariates. Results: Addition of BG, FOS or their combination did not diminish hunger or food intake, although addition of BG to the bar doubled apparent gastric viscosity (841 vs 351 mPa.s). Discussion: BG, FOS or their combination in bars at these levels did not affect hunger when given for 2 consecutive days. Efficacy might be increased by testing them for a longer period, increasing the BG content, or by using BG with even higher gastric viscosity. High-protein foods are more satiating and have a higher thermogenic effect than normal protein foods, over the short as well as over the long-term. We hypothesized that an acute effect of higher protein intake on satiety may be related to acute metabolic and hormonal responses. The study had a single blind, randomized, crossover design. Subjects underwent two indirect calorimetry tests for measurement of energy expenditure (EE) and substrate oxidation. After a standard subject-specific breakfast, subjects received one of two randomly assigned treatments: appropriate protein (AP) lunch (10%E protein, 60%E carbohydrate, 30%E fat), or high-protein (HP) lunch (25%E protein, 45%E carbohydrate, 30%E fat). Post-lunch EE increased 0.85\u00b10.32 kJ/min after HP lunch and 0.73\u00b10.22 kJ/min after AP lunch (p=0.07). RQ was 0.84\u00b10.04 in HP condition and 0.86\u00b10.04 in AP condition (NS). Satiety Visual Analog Scales (VAS) scores were significantly higher 30min, and 120min after HP lunch than after AP lunch. AUC satiety VAS score was significantly higher after HP lunch than after AP lunch (HP 263\u00b161 VAS mm.h, AP 236\u00b176 VAS mm.h; p<0.02). Observed effects on satiety and diet induced thermogenesis did not coincide with effects on plasma ghrelin, GLP-1 and PYY concentrations. A single HP lunch, therefore, seems to exert its acute effect on satiety not through increased concentrations of satiety related hormones. Short-term effects of the single high protein meal on satiety in the present study may reflect satiation rather than satiety. Other factors, which may explain the HP effect on satiety, may be metabolites or amino acids. The study was funded by DiOGenes (Contract no. FP6-513946) which raises no potential duality of interest. Background: Zantrex-3 is a popular dietary supplement for weight control that consists of a combination of yerba mate, guarana, caffeine and damiana. The combination has previously been shown to decrease gastric emptying and it is likely that the weight controlling effects are related to an increased satiety and thermogenesis. Objective: To investigate the effect of Zantrex-3 on energy expenditure, hemodynamic factors, subjective appetite sensations, and on ad libitum energy intake (EI). Design: Twenty-three men (BMI: 23.9\u00b13.2 kg/m 2 , mean\u00b1SD) participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. The Zantrex-3 compound contained 300 mg xantines (caffeine and caffeine-like stimulants), yerba mate, guarana and damiana. The thermogenic effect was measured for 3 hours postintake. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and appetite ratings were assessed every half hour. Results: Zantrex-3 induced a thermogenic response of 7% above baseline value (62.1\u00b18.1 kJ/3-h (mean\u00b1SE), P<0.0001) compared to placebo and increased the respiratory quotient by 2% (0.02\u00b10.01, P=0.03). Systolic and diastolic BP were increased by 4% (5.1\u00b11.1 mmHg, P<0.0001) and 3% (2.1\u00b11.0 mmHg, P=0.03) compared to placebo, whereas no effect was observed on HR. The sensation of satiety and fullness increased by 8% (P=0.01) and 11% (P=0.001), compared to placebo, whereas the sensation of hunger and prospective intake decreased by 7% (P<0.0001) and 5% (P<0.0001), respectively. Conclusion: Zantrex-3 induced a thermogenic response of 7% and seems to have potential appetite suppressants properties. The increase in BP was acceptable and consistent with the caffeine content, and has been shown to decrease with chronic use due to tachyphylaxia.

Background: Usually, treatment of patients with juvenile obesity is equal between genders, although caloric needs, nutrition, trainability, interests, and life styles differ. Such uniformity has to result in a different gender related success rate. The present study evaluates the gender related 2-year follow-up of an inpatient intervention on body fat. Methods: 5 obese girls and 13 boys were tested before (IN) and after an 8-week inpatient program (8W), after 6 months (6MFU), 13 months (13MFU), and 24 months (24MFU) post-hospitalization program. Girls were 13.8\u00b12.1 years old with a body weight of 74.8\u00b111.8kg and a body mass index of 33.9\u00b12.8kg/m 2 (P>98); boys 13.8\u00b12.1 years, 79.9\u00b117.2kg and 34.3\u00b12.9kg/m 2 (P>98). The inpatient program was based on a multicomponent treatment and education focusing on nutritional changes, behavioral modifications and physical activity. A major effort was done in planning for, and monitoring each patient's post-hospitalization program. Body fat was measured by DEXA. Conclusion: Equal multi-disciplinary treatment of both genders was not as effective in girls as in boys concerning body fat. Specific therapeutic intervention may be indicated to reach success also in females.",

In the end of the camp the children chose their favourite sport. A sports trainer from a local sports club was assigned to support the child to participate in the chosen sport in this sports club during six months. Body weight and height were measured at baseline and after 12 months. Results: Twelve months after the sports camp the intervention group had a significant decrease in BMI SDS (baseline BMI SDS 3.21; follow up BMI SDS 3.10, p=0.02).

Observations of epidemiological studies indicate that dietary fibre intake is involved in body weight control. A dietary fibre component that may be of specific importance is resistant starch (RS). Acute effects of RS on energy expenditure and substrate oxidation have hardly been studied. In addition, the effects of RS on ghrelin, PYY and GLP-1, in relation to changes in hunger and satiety are unknown. Thirty subjects (age: 31\u00b114y, BMI: 23.8\u00b12.8kg/m 2 ) were studied 2 times in a randomized controlled crossover design.

Habitual dieting can deplete iron stores. Women often specifically exclude red meat while slimming, which has potential implications for iron status. Aim: To determine the effect on iron status (serum ferritin) of a weight management programme (12 weeks weight loss & 12 weeks weight maintenance), which included the regular consumption of lean red meat compared to one that excluded it. Methods: A randomised controlled trial of 36 overweight, pre-menopausal women, mean serum ferritin 15.8 (SD 3.1) ug/l. Dietary advice was delivered using a one-to-one approach with review every two weeks. Results: Thirty women completed the study. Weight loss at week 12 was -2.8 (SD1.9) kg, p<0.0001 (meat), -2.6 (SD 2.4) kg, p<0.0001 (no meat). Serum ferritin improved in both diet groups at wk 24 and was significant for the groups combined +3.24 (SD 9.02) ug/l p=0.03. There was some suggestion (p =0.07), that in women consuming meat, better adherence to dietary advice, with greater weight loss, led to greater improvements in serum ferritin Conclusion: The data, although inconclusive, suggest better iron status with regular consumption of red meat. A larger study with greater weight loss is required for definitive health promotion advice. Including red meat provides variety and a rich source of dietary iron and should be an option in any weight management programme. Funding: This study was funded by the Meat and Livestock Commission.",

Introduction: Obesity is an accepted risk factor for increased cardiovascular (CV) risk. The \"obesity paradox,\" decreasing mortality with increasing body mass index (BMI) has been suggested in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Its validity is questioned in relation to intentional weight loss and degree of obesity. Patients with CHF (NYHA Class I/II only) were eligible for the SCOUT trial, which is assessing the impact of weight management on CV outcomes in high-CV-risk patients. All received sibutramine (SIB) 10mg with weight management during a 6-week lead-in period before randomization into the long-term, double-blind phase. This analysis compares the response of obese patients with or without CHF to short-term weight management. Patients and Methods: Eligible patients were overweight or obese with CV risk factors. Of 10,742 patients treated in the lead-in period, approximately 900(8.5%) reported a history of CHF treated with medication.",

There was only a marginal difference between the sexes for mean degree BD (disregarding direction of desire). 42.9% and 54.6% of boys and girls respectively desired a TBS and 14% and 7.1% of boys and girls respectively desired a fatter body shape. As weight increased so did BD, with 88.9% and 97.1% of obese boys and girls respectively desiring a TBS and over 60% of the obese children reported extreme BD. Obese boys were 17.6 (95%CI 6.8-46.0) and obese girls were 35.7 (95%CI 9.0-140.6) times more likely to report desiring a TBS. Conclusions: BD is very common in preadolescents.

Thyroid, parathyroid and pituitary function was evaluated; hypercortisolism was diagnosed by an overnight 1 mg dexametasone suppression test. Thyroid ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration biopsy were performed when indicated. 5 OP had an undiagnosed Cushing syndrome: 3 had a Cushing disease due to a pituitary adenoma, and 2 had an hypercortisolism due to an adrenal adenoma. 119 OP had a multinodular goiter (43 newly diagnosed). 1 medullary and 1 papillary thyroid cancer were discovered. The prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis was 88/495 OP (67 with hypothyroidism under L-T4 therapy, 5 with untreated hypothyroidism). 1 patient was hypothyroid after treatment with amiodarone. 16 OP were under L-T4 therapy after thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer, Graves' disease or toxic multinodular goiter. 4 OP had an unknown primary hyperparathyroidism. The pituitary hormonal screening revealed 1 hyperprolactinemic man with a non-functioning pituitary adenoma causing hypothalamic disconnession, and 1 central hypogonadism due to an empty sella. The overall prevalence of endocrine dysfunctions requiring specific treatment before BS was 104/495 (21%). In conclusion, a careful endocrinological evaluation of OP before BS should be adviced. This may reveal undiagnosed dysfunctions that require specific treatment and/or contraindicate bariatric surgery, and allows proper adjustment of hormonal therapy in patients with previously diagnosed endocrine diseases.",

Aims: In Gateshead, a quarter of 10-11year olds are overweight or obese. Getting the Balance Right is a holistic intervention aimed at tackling this problem in school aged children, specifically, aiming to improve Body Mass Index (BMI) in children completing the pathway of care for a twelve month period. Methods: After inter-disciplinary consultation, between health, social services and leisure services locally, a pathway of care was developed to identify and assess children who were overweight or obese. Personalised programmes of nutritional and behavioural advice and physical activity were offered to children and families. School health advisors or dieticians did initial assessments; paediatricians reviewed children thought to have underlying medical conditions and all children received coaching by a trained leisure worker. All data are quoted as means. BMI adult equivalent (Adeq)and BMI standard deviation scores (SDS) are given. Results: Over 30 months, 231 children with a BMI_Adeq of 28.9\u00b15.8 and BMI_SDS of 3.0\u00b10.7 entered the programme. One hundred and seventy-five (11.4\u00b13.3years, 59% female and 78% obese) attended four dietetic appointment over 6.6\u00b13.1 months and BMI_Adeq decreased by 0.9\u00b11.7 and BMI_SDS by 0.14\u00b10.25 (both p<0.0001).

This study aimed to analyse whether weight at initial assessment, age, gender, pre-operative weight loss or device type predicted total post-operative weight loss. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on data on LGBI patients attending a regional bariatric centre over 3 years. Patients were operated on if BMI>35kg/m 2 with an associated co-morbidity, or BMI>40kg/m 2 without. All received professional dietary advice pre-operatively, and pre-operative calorie restriction of 900kcal for 2 weeks prior to surgery. Devices used included the Lap-Band TM , Swedish adjustable band, or Heliogast TM device. Results: There were 246 consecutive patients analysed: 197 female (80%), median age 42y (IQR 36-49); 49 male, median age 49y (IQR 45-55). Mean waiting time between initial assessment and LGBI insertion was 7.8 months. Median postoperative follow-up was 16 months. Initial assessment weight significantly correlated with pre-LGBI weight loss (p<0.0001, Spearman). Patients with BMI 50kg/m 2 (n=75) lost 6.4\u00b11.0kg before the LGBI, compared to a weight loss of 2.1\u00b10.5kg pre-LGBI in patients with a lower BMI (n=109). Pre-LGBI weight loss correlated with post-LGBI weight loss (p=0.016, Spearman). Post-operative weight loss was not correlated with age, gender or device used. Conclusions: Patients with high assessment BMI, and those with greatest weight losses pre-LGBI appear to achieve greater post-LGBI weight loss. It appears that pre-operative diet predicts post-LGBI compliance and thus weight loss.",

Objective: We examined the association between BMI and CKD incidence and compared it with other anthropometrical measurements to define best predictor of CKD in women. Methods: In this population-based cohort study, a representative sample of 2498 women, older than 18 years of age, free of CKD at baseline, were followed for 3.5 years. We estimated GFR by using the abbreviated equation from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study and defined CKD as GFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2.Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the relation between the baseline anthropometrical measures and CKD incidence. Results:Mean BMI of our participants at baseline was 27\u00b15kg/m 2 .After 3.5years CKD developed in 148 (5.3%) of participants. Higher baseline BMI was associated consistently with increased incidence of CKD. The incidence of CKD in, normal BMI ( 25),overweight (25.1to 30) and obese ( 31.1 kg/m 2 ),were 3.2,8.1, and 10.8%respectively. The crude ORs for having CKD across normal, overweight and obese women categories were 1.00 (reference),2.67 (1.71-4.17 ) and 3.66 (2.34-5.78), respectively, (p for trend<0.01). After adjustment for age, smoking, baseline blood pressure, baseline diabetes, change in BMI, waist and WHR, the odds ratios for CKD incidence were 1.00 (reference), 1.68 (0.95-2.96) and 1.75 (0.86-3.57), respectively; (P for trend<0.05). Waist and WHR were excluded from the model. Similar results were noted after exclusion of participants with baseline diabetes mellitus. Conclusion:BMI,but not waist and WHR, is an independent, strong, and potentially modifiable risk factor for CKD in women.Weight loss might represent a novel intervention to reduce risk of CKD development and progression.",

Preliminary results in obtained in 99 obese pregnant women demonstrate that dietary habits at the start of the study did not reach recommended values, but were comparable between the groups. After the intervention, total energy intake was lower in groups A and B than in the controls (p=0.033). This effect was mainly due to a decreased fat intake in the 2 intervention groups versus control group (p=0.008). There were no significant differences in mean (SD) GWG between the three groups (11\u00b17 vs 10\u00b16 vs 10\u00b17 kg). Birth weight of the babies was comparable.

            "text": "International Journal of Obesity The objectives of the present study were to identify 1) the exercise intensity that elicits the maximum fat oxidation rate during walking and cycling and 2) the intensity at which the lactate concentration starts to accumulate in plasma. Fifteen obese boys (mean BMI: 37.6 kg/m 2 ; fat-mass: 38.6%), aged 13 to 17 years, participated in this study. Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical analysis. Subjects performed a graded exercise test on a cycle-ergometer and on a motorised treadmill. Peak oxygen uptake and maximal fat oxidation rate were determined by indirect calorimetry and stoichiometric equations were used to calculate fat oxidation rate. Blood samples for lactate analyses were collected at the end of each stage of the graded exercise test. The exercise intensity, which elicits maximal fat oxidation, corresponded to (mean\u00b1SD) 39\u00b14% V'O 2 max, or 55\u00b16% HR max , without significant differences between walking and cycling. At this exercise intensity, fat oxidation rate was higher during walking than cycling (0.48\u00b10.04 vs 0.30\u00b10.05 g/min, p<0.001). The intensity at which lactate concentration increased above baseline corresponded to 40 \u00b13% V'O 2 max for walking and cycling. However, at this exercise intensity, lactate concentration was lower during walking than cycling (1.2\u00b10.3 vs 1.8\u00b10.4 mmol/L, p<0.001). In conclusion: i. maximal fat oxidation rate was reached at the same exercise intensity for both walking and cycling; ii. fat oxidation rate was 37% higher during walking than cycling at 55% V'O 2 max; iii. accumulation of plasma lactate was strongly correlated with the reduction in fatty acid oxidation with increasing exercise intensities; iv. lactate accumulation was lower during running than cycling.

Methods: We assessed changes in visceral (VAF) and subcutaneous (SAF) abdominal fat at L4-L5 level by MR and changes in body composition (including trunk fat mass) by DXA scans in 112 obese subjects (26 men and 86 women) before and after an 8 week low-calorie diet with 800-1000 kcal/day. Results: The mean body weight loss was 11.3% (SD 2.7) in men and 10.3% (1.9) in women (p=0.04). A weight loss of 10% produced a body fat loss of 15% (95% CI 14-16), a reduction in SAF of 14% (12-16) and a reduction in VAF of 20% (16-25). Relative changes in VAF and SAF were significantly correlated with changes in trunk fat mass (r=0.45; p<0.001 and r=0.44; p<0.001, respectively). After correction for relative changes in trunk fat mass, the relative reduction in VAF was 34% (28-39) in men and 21% (18-24) in women (p<0.001). Relative changes in SAF did not differ significantly between men and women (p=0.85) after correcting for relative changes in trunk fat mass. Conclusion: For a given percentual reduction in body weight, the accompanying reduction in visceral fat is about twice that size (10 versus 20 %), which is consistent with the visceral fat deposition being easier mobilizable. However, for any weight loss compound claiming a selective effect on visceral fat it is not enough to demonstrate that greater percentage of visceral fat than body weight is lost. Methods: Twenty-eight individuals were randomly allocated to an immediate treatment or to a wait-list condition. Binge eating was studied according to EMA (seven days) at the beginning of wait-list condition, before and after treatment. Results: Before treatment, interpersonal conflicts, negative mood, or situational triggers such as evening time or specific weekday most often triggered binge eating. After binge eating, cognitions regarding low selfefficacy were most prominent. After treatment analyses the same antecendents and consequences were associated with the few binges still exhibited. Conclusion: EMA based assessments show before and after CBT that most often, binge eating is triggered by interpersonal conflicts and negative mood. Further situational aspects, play a major role in triggering binges. After binge eating cognitions regarding low self-efficacy in dealing with the problem dominate. These findings might help tailoring treatment protocols to specific BED patients populations. Objectives: To explore feasibility of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) in evaluating a short-term CBT. Methods: Twenty-eight individuals were randomized to an immediate short-term CBT (8 weeks) or to a wait-list condition (8 weeks). EMA was accomplished during seven days at the beginning of wait-list condition, before and after treatment. Results: Ratings of acceptance and compliance with EMA were high. EMA-based estimates of bingeing were lower than rates assessed by retrospective questionnaires or interviews. Binges assessed by EMA were significantly reduced from 2.75 to 0.5 per week. Craving, feelings of hunger and control remained stable. Conclusion: EMA was well accepted and patients adhered to the EMAprotocol. We find indices of retrospective memory distortion regarding questionnaire and interview based assessment of binge eating. Short-term CBT is efficacious in reducing binge eating, whereas EMA shows, that feelings of loss of control, hunger, craving remain stable. Binge eating may be the tip of the iceberg, which can be remitted in CBT, but craving and reduced feelings of control might represent more stable aberrations of impulse control. ",

Increasing epidemiological evidence links excessive central adipose tissue with cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. One of the challenges of providing health care for overweight and obese people is the limitations of the available methods to distinguish between weight change and adipose tissue distribution. Body mass index (BMI) is the gold standard for classification of overweight and obesity while waist circumference (WC) and sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) have been proposed as methods of measuring central adiposity. The stability of these methods in a primary care setting was explored in a pragmatic longitudinal study, in which 28 people consented to repeated measurement at eight-week intervals for up to four years in a general practice surgery. Recording of BMI (weight/height 2 ), WC using a simple tape measure, and SAD using the Holtain Kahn abdominal calipers enabled exploration of the reliability of these measures in the context of central adiposity.

Funding: Research relating to this abstract was funded by Anglia Ruskin University Purpose: To further understanding on the clinical significance of binge eating in children. Emerging evidence suggests that childhood binge eating is likely associated with overweight and obesity as well as with increased eating disorder and general psychopathology. Methods: 60 children with binge eating, defined as \u2265 1 episode of loss of control over eating (LOC+) within the past 3 months, and 60 matched children without LOC history were recruited from the community. Clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires were used for psychopathological assessment. Results: LOC+ children reported 5 LOC episodes during the past month, mostly objective bulimic episodes, assessed though the Child-Eating Disorder Examination. Recurrent LOC was reported by 31 children (51.7%). LOC episodes were associated with overweight and obesity (36, 60.0%), greater eating disorder psychopathology, depressiveness, but not with psychiatric diagnoses or general behavioral disturbances. A hierarchical cluster analysis based on the DSM-IV and other proposed research criteria of binge eating disorder in children showed a recurrent binge eating cluster including children with \u2265 1 LOC per month, high level of distress, and increased eating disorder psychopathology; an emotional eating cluster including highly depressed children who binge ate at lower frequency; and a nondisturbed cluster with no or occasional binge eating. Both binge eating clusters revealed increased body mass index. Conclusions: These results show that the presentation of binge eating in children is heterogenous. Recurrent binge eating varies along dimensions of eating or mood disturbances. These findings suggest a differential indication for treatment of children from both binge eating clusters.

Usually in the setting of overweight and obesity fat is deposited in all body locations. Abdominal obesity -reflected in an increased waist circumference -is associated with an increased health risk. A positive relation exists between the body mass index (BMI), the total fat mass (TFM) as well as the waist circumference (WC). For cultural reasons patients often do not want to undress or refuse even anthropometric measurements. In this study the relationship between buccal skin fold thickness (BSF) with TFM, BMI and WC was studied in young adults. Methods: 409 students (m/f = 179/230) at the age of 15 -22 years (BMI 21.09 \u00b1 1.81 kg/m 2 ) were examined. Body weight, WC and BMI were measured according to the usual guidelines. The BSF was measured vertically in the middle of cheek between tragus and angulus oris using a calliper (Holtain LDT Crymych, UK). The average of three measurements was used. TFM was determined by bioimpedance (Tanita BF-410, Japan). Results: There correlation coefficient (r) for the relationship between the different variables was for males/females:",

Aims: To assess family history, physical exercise and self-image on recruitment. Method: On entering the project questionnaires were filled in. Questionnaires were evaluated for 52 randomly selected children, which are representative of all participants with respect to age, gender and BMI. Results: 67% of children have other family members who worry about their weight, 61% of these are 1 st degree relatives. Weight related illnesses (cardiovascular or diabetes type II) occur in 12% of 1 st degree and 40% of 2 nd degree relatives. Almost all children (98%) report to exercise, but 35% solely attend school PE lessons. Only a minority (13%) exercise at least 60 minutes/day. 89% of children own a bike, only 29% ride it regularly. 54% walk to school, but often infrequently. Much time is spent watching TV or playing computer games with 30% of the children spending more than 2 hours per day. 71% of children have expressed concerns about their weight and 50% experienced bullying. Conclusions: Obesity and its complications are common in the children's families. Most children report being active, but actual levels of exercise are mostly inadequate. The emotional cost on children was highlighted with high rates of bullying and concern about body weight. Recognition of these characteristics have contributed to the development of our local project with family participation, dietician and school nursing involvement and promotion of physical exercise through local authority facilities.

Comprehensive nutritional education can result in improving not only the quality of diet but also in reducing metabolic disorders. The aim of this study was to assess serum leptin and insulin levels in overweight or obese patients with essential hypertension attending nutritional education program provided by dietitian. A total of 125 pharmacologically-treated patients were recruited from the Outpatients Clinic of Hypertension at the National Institute of Cardiology in Warsaw. The study group consisted of 81 subjects (mean age 62.3\u00b18.8 years and BMI 32.7\u00b14.2 kg/m 2 ) attending nutritional program. Forty four individuals from the control group (mean age 56.8\u00b110 years and BMI 32.4\u00b14.5 kg/m 2 ) received standard medical counseling. Baseline serum leptin and insulin levels, measured before nutritional education, were 22.8\u00b115.5 \u03bcg/L, 15.9\u00b17.9 \u03bcU/ml and 19.8\u00b114.0 \u03bcg/L, 14.7\u00b16.9\u03bcU/ml, in both groups respectively. After 6 month of education statistically significant decrease of leptin ( from baseline -4.04\u03bcg/L, p 0.05) and insulin levels ( from baseline -1.84\u03bcU/ml, p 0.05) was observed in the study group. Increase of both markers was found in the control group ( from baseline 0.09\u03bcg/L, NS, and 2.36\u03bcU/ml, p 0.05, respectively). A decrease in body mass was found in 72% of individuals from the study group and in 41% subjects from the control group. Statistically significant decrease in both, systolic and diastolic blood pressure was found only in the study group (130\u00b16 versus 127\u00b16 mmHg, p 0.05; and 84\u00b13 versus 83\u00b14 mmHg, p 0.05, respectively). It was concluded that nutritional education could be effective strategy for hypertension and obesity management. Background: Ramadan fasting is a religious daytime fasting, which might result in loss of body weight and percentage body fat. We sought to find changes in body weight and percentage body fat in women adhering to Ramadan fasting. Methods: Women from a nearby community center were asked to participate into the study. Body weight and composition were measured by densitometry (BOD POD). Measurement were taken a few days before the start of Ramadan, about 25 days later (3.5 weeks into Ramadan) and about 25 days later (3 weeks after Ramadan). One sample t-test was used. Results: Included were 21 women, loss to follow-up 9. For 12 women mean age was 33 (sd 11) y, BMI 24.6 (5.1), body weight 63.9 (14.2) kg, percentage body fat 31.4 (10.9) %. By the end of Ramadan body weight had decreased by 0.17 kg (95% CI -0.64-0.29) and body fat percentage by 0.68% (95% CI -2.03-0.66). However, between end of Ramadan and 3 weeks after Ramadan body weight increased by 0.88 kg (p= 0.005; 95% CI 0.32-1.44) and percentage body fat increased by 2.09% (p=0.061; 95% CI -0.1-4.3). Total increase in body weight over 7 weeks was 0.65 kg (p=0.063; 95% CI -0.04-1.35).",

Dairy calcium supplementation has been proposed to increase fat oxidation and inhibit lipogenesis. This study investigated the effects of calcium supplementation on markers of fat metabolism. Ten overweight/obese individuals with habitually low calcium intakes received 800 mg/d dairy calcium for 5 weeks. After 4 weeks, an adipose tissue biopsy was taken for analysis of gene expression. Respiratory exchange, glycerol turnover and subcutaneous adipose tissue microdialysis was performed for 7 hours after consuming 400 mg calcium or placebo, with randomized slow release caffeine (SRC; 300 mg) or lactose intake (500 mg). One week later the test was repeated with the SRC/lactose cross-over. Calcium supplementation increased urinary calcium excretion 28% (p<0.05), but did not alter plasma PTH and osteocalcin concentrations. Resting energy expenditure (REE; 59.9 \u00b1 3.0 kcal/h vs 59.6 \u00b1 3.3 kcal/h), fat oxidation (FO; 58.4 \u00b1 2.5 mg/min vs 53.8 \u00b1 2.2 mg/min), plasma free fatty acid concentrations (FFA; 0.63 \u00b1 0.02 mmol/L vs 0.62 \u00b1 0.03 mmol/L) and glycerol turnover (3.63 \u00b1 0.41 \u03bcmol/kg/min vs 3.67 \u00b1 0.38 \u03bcmol/kg/min) were similar with or without calcium supplementation. SRC increased FFA concentrations, resting FO and REE. During microdialysis, epinephrine infusion increased dialysate glycerol concentrations 255% without and 254% with calcium supplementation. Expressions of 7 key metabolic genes in subcutaneous adipose tissue were not affected by calcium supplementation. Calcium supplementation, in overweight subjects with a low habitual calcium intake, failed to alter whole body lipolysis, lipid oxidation, and energy expenditure under resting conditions and during stimulation by caffeine or epinephrine.",

Conclusion: These results imply that poor self-control seen in impulsiveness and lower self-discipline was most important for eating due to negative emotions as well as in response to external food stimuli, suggesting that the inhibition of eating and difficulties to govern ones behaviour are major aspects of these eating behaviours. Attempts to control food intake and body weight seen in restrained eating were associated with more character strengths and ambitions, and also a more outgoing personality style with more stable emotions.",

            "text": "One of the most pervasive weight loss rules is that a cumulative energy deficit of 3500 kcal is required per pound of body weight loss, or equivalently 32.2 MJ per kg. Under what conditions is it appropriate to use this rule of thumb and what are the factors that determine the cumulative energy deficit required per unit weight loss? Here, I examine this question using a modification of the classic Forbes equation that predicts the composition of weight loss as a function of the initial body fat and magnitude of weight loss. The resulting model predicts that a larger cumulative energy deficit is required per unit weight loss for people with greater initial body fat -a prediction supported by published weight loss data from obese and lean subjects. This may also explain why men can lose more weight than women for a given energy deficit since women typically have more body fat than men of similar body weight. Furthermore, additional weight loss is predicted to be associated with a lower average cumulative energy deficit since a greater proportion of the weight loss is predicted to result from loss of lean body mass which has a relatively low energy density in comparison with body fat. The rule of thumb approximately matches the predicted energy density of lost weight in obese subjects with an initial body fat above 30 kg but overestimates the cumulative energy deficit required per unit weight loss for people with lower initial body fat. This work was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH, NIDDK. Cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) approaches of different length and delivery format (e.g. group and individual setting, therapist-guided selfhelp) have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of binge eating disorder (BED). This study evaluated the efficacy of a short-term CBT including 8 weekly sessions, followed by five booster sessions during the 12-month follow-up period. Thirty-six female participants with BED were randomly assigned to eight weeks of CBT or a waitlist condition. Core symptoms of BED (abstinence rates from binge eating, number of objective binge episodes, self-reported weekly binges, body mass index) and associated eating disorder psychopathology (shape and weight concern, eating concern, dietary restraint) were assessed repeatedly up to 12 months following treatment using structured diagnostic interviews and self-report measures. Participants' compliance and therapist's adherence to the treatment protocol were assessed. Statistical analyses were conducted using Linear Mixed Models for continuous variables, and Generalized Linear Models (GLMMs) for dichotomous variables. Short-term CBT produced significant reductions in the number of objective binge eating episodes and significant improvements in the percentage of patients abstaining from binge eating at 12-month follow-up. Findings suggest that the short-term CBT is efficacious in reducing core symptoms of BED, thus providing a cost-effective treatment option for patients with BED.",

It is a post-approval commitment to the European Regulatory Authorities prompted by concern that sibutramine's (SIB) mode of action could exacerbate hypertension (HT). SIB would be contraindicated in most patients eligible for SCOUT; however, approximately 10% of those enrolled were at lower risk and met criteria in current EU Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC-\"label\"). Data from the 6-week lead-in period when all patients received SIB 10 mg plus weight management allow an assessment of initial response in these 2 groups. Patients and Methods: Patients eligible for SCOUT were aged \u226555 years with BMI \u226527 to \u226445 kg/m 2 , or \u226525 to <27 kg/m 2 , waist circumference \u2265102 cm (men)/\u226588 cm (women), blood pressure \u2264160/\u2264100 and had a history of CV disease (coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke) or had type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and another risk factor.

The intragastric balloon is a non-surgical, reversible obesity treatment with promising yet inconclusive results. The aim of the current study was to assess its effect on controlling body weight and improving patients' psychological function and QOL. Patients and methods: Thirty seven (37) adult obese patients with no contraindications to balloon placement were enrolled to this prospective study. Participants were interviewed before the intragastric balloon placement (time 1) and at 6 months (time 2), when the balloon was removed. Psychological function and QOL were assessed by the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), respectively. Results: Two patients (5.4%) had the balloon removed before study completion, because of nausea and vomiting. Patients' mean initial body weight was 117.9 (22.1) kg with a mean BMI of 41.7 (5.0). At time 2, patients' mean body weight was significantly decreased (p=0.000) with a mean loss of 17.5 (11.3) kg. In addition, patients reported a significant reduction in anxiety (p=0.035) and depression (p=0.046) scores and a major improvement in all subscales of the SF-36 including physical functioning (p=0.000), role functioning due to physical (p=0.001) or emotional (p=0.002) problems, bodily pain (p=0.021), vitality (p=0.012), social functioning (p=0.003), general (p=0.005) and mental (p=0.013) health.",

Technology offers potential solutions. An Internet-based weight loss system was created, by which overweight children and adolescents may: 1) be educated on healthy eating and exercise; 2) receive support from overweight peers; and 3) selfmonitor weight with online support and guidance from their healthcare provider. Results of a two-year outcomes study on 124 overweight school and clinic children, with 36 providers, are encouraging. Obstacles encountered include: 1) minimal computer knowledge by providers; 2) lack of provider time to monitor data and post supportive messages; 3) lack of reimbursement for Internet-delivered care; 4) lack of home Internet access by children; 5) lack of time for children to access the system at school; 6) licensure issues when delivering care across state borders, 7) provider privacy concerns that personal information may be stolen from the database, 8) provider liability concerns that a hacker/predator may obtain a provider's password and spoof/prey upon a child. Solutions developed include: 1) automatic email notification to providers of excessive weight gain and when a child has weighed-in or not weighed-in within the provider specified time frame; 2) automatic weigh-in reminders to children, if not weighed-in within their provider-specified period; 3) prewritten weight control messages (templates) sent automatically to children at the provider-specified interval, including provider's photo and signature; 4) Internet-connected scales, constituting \"electronic accountability\". Internet technology has the potential to impact on childhood obesity, if remaining obstacles can be overcome.

            "text": "The quality of life (QoL) has been measured with generic questionnaires such as the SF-36. The present pilot study assessed whether these QoL scores correlated with BMI, socioeconomic status, and biochemical markers of nutritional status. We included 71 subjects (52 women), aged 40.4\u00b111.8 years with BMI 32.4\u00b19.6 (min 18.5, max 56.8). The subjects completed the SF-36 questionnaire and were interviewed for evaluation of socioeconomic status. Blood samples were taken for measurements of 17 biochemical markers related to nutrition. Body composition was determined using bioelectrical impedance analysis. A factor analysis was used to calculate four subjacent factors for the biochemical markers and its scores were used in the analysis. Pearson correlation analysis and the MANOVA test were performed. SF-36 scales correlated with BMI: Physical function (r=-0.43), physical activity (r=-0.30), pain (r=-0.29), general health (r=-0.23), vitality (r=-0.46), social function (r=-0.25), emotions (r=-0.32) and mental health (r=-0.46), p<0.05, for all. Other measurements such as body fat percentage and waist circumference showed the same trend of correlations with the SF-36 measures. Only the mental health portion of the QoL was correlated with the nutrition factor 2 (r=0.3), suggesting a relation between mental health deterioration and low serum concentration of iron, hemoglobin, homocysteine, and transferrin. Vitality was inversely associated with socioeconomic status, after adjustment for sex and age. We conclude that QoL is greatly affected by BMI, the nutrition factor that implies variables related to iron status was inversely correlated with mental health. Data exist that support this association. Other studies have shown that vitality is associated with fatigue, our findings suggest this vitality score is independent explained by BMI and socioeconomic status. Objective: To determine subjacent factors that can explain biochemical markers associated with body composition. Methods: We included 71 subjects (52 women) with age 40.4\u00b111.8 years and BMI 32.4\u00b19.6 (min 18.5, max 56.8). Blood samples were taken for quantification of 17 biochemical markers related to nutritional status. Basic anthropometric measures were taken and body composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance. A factor analysis was used to assess at least four subjacent factors of nutritional status and their association with the anthropometric and body composition variables. Results: We found two nutritional factors that were directly related to BMI. However, factor 1 was associated with lean mass, while factor 2 was associated with body fat. Factor 1 correlated with BMI (r=0.46) and lean mass (r= 0.62); indicating that triglycerides, insulin, retinol-binding protein, ferritin and homocysteine had a direct correlation but HDL-C, serum folate and cobalamin was inverse. Factor 2 showed inverse correlation with BMI (r=-0.45) and body fat percentage (r=-0.54). As body fat increased there was a decrease in serum iron level, hemoglobin, and an increase in homocysteine and transferrin. Prealbumin was inversely related to body fat (r=-0.38) and BMI (r=-0.32), while pepsinogen was directly associated with BMI (r=0.33) and gastrin (r=0.33). Serum creatinine was related to waist circumference (r=0.42), and lean body mass (r=0.70). Interestingly, creatinine/height index and gastrin did not show an important effect in this group of patients. Conclusion: Biochemical nutritional status markers had differential associations with body composition. The least useful index was the creatinine/heght index that did not show any correlation with the studied variables. We found that nutritional markers are not useful for the assessment of malnourishment in obese subjects. These nutritional markers have been used for undernourished subjects. Recently some researchers have suggested that obese patients have a degree of malnourishment; this study does not support this concept. The findings in obese individuals may reflect an epiphenomenon related to circulating marker dilution due to the higher blood volume found in obese individuals. \"Dr. Ionova's clinic\" has the 5 years experience of obesity management. There are same directions of obesity management in the clinic: individual nutritional counseling, individual psychological counseling, group nutritional and psychological counseling, massage and cosmetic procedures.",

Reliable data of the effectiveness of using the product for nutritional patients have been received by now. The effect is reached by means of active components of the shake. The shake includes soy protein (with all essential amino acids), a complex of vitamins, minerals and lactulose. As a fiber, lactulose gives the filling of fullness, stabilizes the function of intestinal tract, provides probiotical effect of intestinal tract improvement, which lasts for a long time after finishing the nutrition program. Indications: obesity, low nutrition, as additional nutrition at exercises. Contraindication: individual intolerance, renal-hepatic insufficiency. The comparative analysis of two groups of patients (1 st -taking the shake during weight reduction, 2 nd -omitting the shake during weight reduction) showed: 1. 1 st group patients (1GP) lost the weight faster, than 2nd group patients (2GP). 2. 1GP doesn't have hunger attacks, they feel fullness faster, than 2GP and for a longer period. 3. 1GP has fewer nutrition breaks. 4. 1GP normalizes the blood cholesterol and other lipids levels faster, than 2GP. 5. 1GP improves the intestinal function. The patients get easy cooking. Preparation: the necessary amount of shake is stirred with dairy products ore sour-milk products. It is used for breakfast and/or for dinner. The portion and the period of shake intaking are determined by the supervising doctor.",

To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet examined the metabolic risk profile of middle-aged pre-and early postmenopausal obese women. Methods: 14 pre-(49 \u00b1 2 years) and 11 postmenopausal women (52 \u00b1 3 years) whose body mass index was 32 \u00b1 3 and 30 \u00b1 2 kg/m\u00b2, respectively (p=0.12) were compared for their metabolic and inflammatory profiles after 3 sessions/week of 45 min-walking each, at 60% of heart rate reserve, during 16 weeks. Body composition was assessed by bioelectric impedance and O 2 max estimated by the 2 km-walking test. Fasting plasma triglyceride, cholesterol (CHOL), lipoprotein fractions as well as PAI-1, C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), fibrinogen and cytokine (adiponectin, TNF\u03b1 and IL-6) levels were determined. Plasma glucose, free fatty acid (FFA) and insulin responses to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were measured. Results: At baseline, postmenopausal women were characterized by lower lean mass and higher HDL-CHOL concentrations (0.01<p<0.02), compared to premenopausal ones. After walking, estimated O 2 max was improved in both groups (0.0001<p<0.002). However, body weight and fat mass (0.0003<p<0.03), plasma CHOL and LDL-CHOL levels (0.008<p<0.01) decreased in premenopausal women, while plasma TNF-\u03b1 and PAI-1 levels (p=0.006) increased in postmenopausal subjects. Plasma levels of hs-CRP, fibrinogen and others adipocytokines as well as glucose, insulin and FFA areas under the curve (OGTT) remained unchanged in both groups (0.21<p<0.77). Conclusion: Our walking program reduces adiposity and improves some features of premenopausal women's metabolic risk profile, only. In order to test the effects of protein-enriched meal replacement (MR) shake in metabolic syndrome (MS), 110 subjects (age 49.8\u00b12.6 yr, BMI 36.2\u00b14.7 kg/m 2 ) were randomly assigned to a protein-rich diet (P group) providing 2.2 g protein / kg lean body mass using two meal replacement (MR) shakes (Herbalife Formula 1) combined with a protein supplement (Herbalife Performance Protein Powder) per day with a diet plan compared to a conventional diet (C group) using foods alone to provide 0.8 g protein / kg body weight for 3 months with prescribed calorie restriction of 500 kcal/day. For 9 months of weight maintenance, both groups consumed 1 MR shake daily. Dietary macronutrients with 30% energy from fat was maintained for both groups. 74 of 110 subjects (31 P and 43 C) completed the study. At 12 months, weight loss in the P group was 11.2\u00b16.4 kg or 11.8 % of initial body weight compared to 6.52\u00b15.8 kg or 6.92 % of initial body weight in the C group. The loss of fat mass was greater in the P group than in the C group with a ratio of fat loss to lean of 3.44 in P and 1.96 in C. 64.5 % in P and 41.7 % in C group no longer met metabolic syndrome criteria with no abnormalities of liver or renal function in any subject. Protein-enriched MR shakes resulted in greater than 10% average weight loss in MS. Introduction: Primary care medicine needs to address the rising epidemic of overweight and obesity. This is especially prudent since behavioral factors are often learned and perpetuated in families. In Germany, only few practices have started to address this issue. We report three-year results of an urban primary care practice.",

Methodology: 265 psychiatric patients (mean age 39,5\u00b110,9 years) participated in the study (220 women and 45 men). Anthropometric measurements (body weight, % body fat, waist circumference), measurement of Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), clinical (type of disease and medication) and biochemical data (HDL cholesterol, triglycerides etc) were collected. Dietary assessment was also carried out. A personalized diet was given for weight control in each patient by a dietitian. The patients were visiting the dietitian every two weeks.

Therefore, the increasing prevalence of obesity in young women is a major public health concern Study Design: In a retrospective cohort study, all women attending the antenatal clinic during the year 2006 were included. Total number of deliveries was 2152; complete data were available for 1863 women. Body weight and height before pregnancy were self-reported. Women were classified according to WHO standards as underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m 2 ), normal weight (BMI: 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9) and obese (BMI \u226530). Mean age did not differ between the groups (30 \u00b1 5 years) Results: 5.8% of the women were underweight and 64.8% presented with normal BMI before pregnancy. Overweight was present in 20.7% and obesity in 8.7% of the study population. BMI in the total group ranged from 15.4 to 52.1 kg/m 2 . 24% of the total population underwent a caesarean section, starting from 20% in the lowest BMI category to 33% in the obese group. Induction of labour was necessary in 38% of the underweight women, 42% in the normal BMI group, 48% for the overweight, 58% in the obese women and increasing even to 68% in the morbid obese (p<0.005). Pregnancy duration, and other obstetric and perinatal outcomes did not differ between the groups. Conclusion: The prevalence of overweight/obesity in pregravid Belgian women is even higher than those reported in literature.

Method: Study included 105 women, aged 32.0 \u00b1 7.6 years who addressed outpatient Nutrition Unit for nutrition counseling because of obesity. Nutritional status was defined by Body Mass Index (BMI). The Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) standardized for use in Serbian population was used for evaluating symptoms and attitudes associated with disordered eating. Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-clinical version) was used for diagnosis of BED. Data on dietary intake were obtained pretreatment and posttreatment. Follow-up period was three months. Results: Using the cut-off point of 20 in the total EAT, 32 women (30.47 %) exhibited disordered eating behavior and 30 women (28.57%) met diagnostic criteria for BED. Before weight loss BED group reported greater average energy intake, including nonbinge days. After weight loss there was no significant difference between BED and non BED group regarding energy intake. Weight loss was higher in non BED group.

            "text": "Objective: To determine what affects human's magnitude of weight loss when exposed to Betahistine, a centrally acting Histamine H1 agonist. Design: Post hoc analysis of BET-201, a multicenter, multiple dose, phase 2 study, that investigated the potential of Betahistine to serve as an antiobesity agent. Results: After the run-in period, 281 subjects were assigned randomly to treatment or placebo, and a total of 234 (83.3%) subjects completed the study. The post hoc exploratory subgroup analysis includes 118 subjects that compose the per protocol population of the Placebo group and the Betahistine high dose group. This analysis revealed that the factors affecting weight response in the Betahistine group were age, ethnicity, gender, and weight loss during the run in period. For age, the cut off for having a good response to the drug was 50 years of age. For gender, women responded better to the drug than men, for weight loss during the run in period, the cut off was 1.5 Kg. For ethnicity, non Hispanics responded better than Hispanics. Race had no effect on the response to the drug. The per protocol population of less than 50 years old, non Hispanic women a statistically and clinically significant weight loss was observed, the Betahsitine group (n=23) lost -4.24+3.87 Kg while the placebo group (n=25) lost -1.65+2.96 Kg during this time period (p=0.005). Conclusion: Histaminergic manipulations may induce weight loss in a subset of patients. Data from animals showed a relation between sex hormones and weight response to histamine, and our data suggests a similar response in humans. Eating behaviour traits, namely Disinhibition and Restraint, exert a powerful effect on food intake and energy balance (Bryant et al, 2008) . For example, Disinhibition is associated with a susceptibility to gain weight (Haynes et al, 2005) . The effectiveness of exercise as a method of weight management could be moderated by these traits. This study examined the relationships amongst exercise, eating behaviour traits, and weight loss. Fifty eight overweight and obese men (n=19) and women (n=39) with mean BMI=31.8 \u00b14.5 kg/m 2 , age=39.6 \u00b19.8yrs and VO 2max =29.1 \u00b15.7ml/kg/min completed 12 weeks of supervised exercise. The Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) was administered, and body weight (Bwt), waist circumference (WC) and fat mass (FM) measured at weeks 0 and 12. After 12 weeks Bwt and FM decreased significantly by -3.3 \u00b13.6kg, and 3.3 \u00b12.6kg respectively (p<0.001). Twelve weeks of exercise and a significant reduction in body weight resulted in a significant decrease in Disinhibition (18%) and increase in Restraint (21%). TFEQ hunger did not change. Baseline (week 0) Disinhibition was significantly correlated with changes in Bwt (r = -0.290, p= 0.029), and WC (r = -0.339, p=0.010 Previous studies showed positive effect of sibutramine on lipids compared to placebo. Today many obese patients are using statin and the sibutramine statin interaction was not evaluated yet. The aim of the study was to evaluate effect of 15mg sibutramine on lipid level in 44 obese patients-mean age 50.8 years, mean BMI 37.2 kg/m 2 , mean weight loss -6.7 kg/ 3 months. 18 patients continued the stable statin dose combined with new sibutramine therapy. 26 newly sibutramine treated patients had no hypolipidemic therapy. We are evaluating the first 3 months of sibutramine therapy using paired Wilcoxon nonparametric test. Results: Lipid levels changed in the following way: cholesterol 5.18\u20264.96 mmol/l (p = 0.02), LDL cholesterol 2.98\u20262.90 mmol/l (p = 0.29), HDL cholesterol 1.18\u20261.25 mmol/l (p = 0.001), triglycerides 1.89\u20261.69 mmol/l (p = 0.04). Comparing both groups there was no significant difference in statin treated and untreated patients. The lipid change was the same in both groups-total cholesterol (p = 0.86), LDL cholesterol (p = 0.97), HDL cholesterol (p = 0.18) and triglycerides (p = 0.27). Nearest to significance was the HDL cholesterol change: without statin +0.06 mmol/l and with statin +0.12 mmol/l and triglycerides without statin -0.35 mmol/l and with statin -0.09 mmol/l. Significant changes of blood glucose and HbA1c level were also present without any difference in both groups. Conclusion: Sibutramine effectively decreases triglycerides and total cholesterol level and increases HDL cholesterol level in 3 month therapy. The effect is the same in statin treated patients. The sibutramine effect on HDL cholesterol could be even bigger in statin treated patients. This effect has to be confirmed in longer studies. It is useful to use sibutramine effect on lipids even in obese patients with established statin therapy. Aim: To analyse effectiveness and clinical outcome of treatment of obese using low calorie diet. Methods and sample: Sample consists of 100 obese patients with comorbidities aged (47.2 \u00b1 12.7 years, 21-74), recruited randomly from patients of Centre of obesity treatment during their first visit. Patients were asked for informed consent with the study, examined (for anthropometric parameters, biochemical parameters from fasting plasma and urine sample from 12 hour diuresis, 24-hour dietary recall), educated in desirable regime changesespecially in LCD (1200 kcal/day). Like biomarkers of prescribed diet and content of vegetable and fruit intake, urine excretion of phenolic compounds was measured. Patients were monthly supervised by nutritionists and after 3 and 6 months examined in the same manner like on the beginning. Wilcoxon`s pair test was used for statistical analyse. Results: After 3 months of therapy only 51 patients and after 6 months only 36 patients remained on the regime treatment with weight loss effect, rest escape from the study or needed complementary treatment. Weight loss after 3 and 6 months was statistically significant with median on the beginning 112.4 kg (Q 1 103.4; Q 3 131.0) vs median at time 3 months 105.9 kg (Q 1 93.0; Q 3 126.0) and 110.5 kg (Q 1 99.8; Q 3 133.0) vs 103.6 kg (Q 1 91.1; Q 3 119.4) in 6 months respectively, together with statistically significant decrease of AST, ALT, GMT, uric acid, total and LDL cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, CRP plasma level, and microalbuminuria. Conclusion: Study has shown measurable clinical success of LCD at minimum in one third of patients. Research relating to this abstract was funded by MSM 0021620819 Abstracts S106 International Journal of Obesity Aim of the study was to explore potential factors affecting attendance and dropout, and consequently, adherence in a weight reduction lifestyle program for patients with metabolic syndrome (MS). Forty nine MS patients (51 % women, mean age: 47\u00b124 years), attending an outpatient clinic in a major general public hospital, were randomly assigned to a Less Intensive (LI, 4 individualized, goal-oriented counseling sessions) or a More Intensive care (MI, 9 individualized, goal-oriented counseling sessions) 6-month intervention. All participants underwent a standard clinical, biochemical and lifestyle examination at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. No statistically significant differences were detected between the two groups in none of the baseline parameters evaluated. Twenty-one patients (42.8% of the total sample) quitted the program and they were classified as dropouts. Discriminant analysis revealed that type of intervention ( =0.834), waist circumference ( =0.937), years of education ( =0.968), blood triglycerides levels ( =0.975) and sex ( =0.987) were the most important factors affecting patients' dropout. Logistic regression further demonstrated that MS patients who participated in the MI (p=0.01) and those with lower waist circumference (p=0.04) were more likely to complete the program. These preliminary findings indicate that baseline participants' characteristics related to the MS (such a waist circumference) as well as intervention characteristics (intensity of the program in terms of number of counseling sessions) may affect patients' dropout, and possibly management of MS factors.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate association of the items of the EI with metabolic risk factors, adiponectin and neuropetide Y (NPY) both before and after the weight reduction. Methods: Four-week in-patient comprehensive weight reduction program was introduced. Food intake and physical activity were strictly controlled. Women (n =67, BMI:32.4+4.4 kg; age:48.7+12.2 years) who maintained stable weight on a 7MJ/day diet during the 1st week of weight management were given a hypocaloric diet characterized by daily energy deficit of 2.5 MJ over the subsequent 3-week period. This treatment resulted in a mean weight loss of 3.80 + 1.64 kg. Association of the items of the EI (restraint:RES, disinhibition:DIS, hunger:HUN) with lipid profile, fasting blood glucose (FBG), C peptide (CP), insulin, adiponectin and NPY were determined before and after weight loss. Results: No significant relations of the EI factors with lipid and glucose profiles and hormone levels were observed before weight reduction. After weight loss RES was associated with FBG (r=-0.327,p=0.007), CP (r=-0.268,p=0.038), insulin (r=-0.336, p=0.006) and NPY (r=-0.242,p=0.05 In an ongoing randomized controlled trial, 120 obese patients underwent a screening period during which they were assigned to a healthy eating low calorie diet for a period of 3 months. Patients who achieved a 5% weight loss at 3 months were continued with this approach while the other patients were randomized to a low-carbohydrate (protein sparing modified fast -PSMF) or a very low calorie commercial diet (LighterLife -LL). Here we present data for 3 months post-randomization. Of the initial 120 patients, 72 were randomized. Subjects on the LL (n=35) lost significantly more weight than patients on the PSMF (n=37) (-11.2 SD 12.9 vs. -2.9 SD 4.5, P=0.01), and had a greater improvement in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.25 SD 0.56 vs. 0.03 SD 0.36, P=0.015). Patients on LL had significantly greater improvement in total cholesterol and fasting glucose concentration but significance was lost when corrected for differences at baseline. Patients on LL had a significant improvement in blood pressure, fasting glucose and HbA1 c between randomization and 3 months. However, there were no significant differences between changes in LL and PSMF for blood pressure, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and fasting HbA1 c concentrations at 3 months. Both dietary approaches achieved significant weight loss. The LL diet produced a greater weight loss than did the PSMF for the first 3 months. The LL diet was associated with greater improvement in some risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Funding: Research relating to this abstract was funded by LigherLife",

Funding: Research relating to this abstract was funded by LigherLife S107 Different types of \u201anovel' carbohydrates have been proposed to reduce hunger by either being slowly digestible themselves (e.g. isomaltulose), or by delaying the digestion of other carbohydrates (e.g., Fibersol\u2122, pullulan) or perhaps by directly increasing satiety hormones (e.g. Nutraflora\u2122). The aim of this study was to assess the satiety value of meal-replacement bars containing these different food-grade carbohydrates. In a 6-way cross-over double-blind randomized design, 24 healthy volunteers (BMI: 21-32 kg/m 2 ) consumed at breakfast iso-caloric meal bars: a control bar (Slim Fast High Protein Granola Bar), bar with addition of 8g Nutraflora\u2122 (a short-chain fructooligosaccharide), or 8g Pullulan (a soluble fibre), or 9g isomaltulose (a slowly digestible disaccharide), or 8g Fibersol\u2122 (a resistant maltodextrin). All carbohydrates were accommodated by removing part of the sugars. Self-reports of satiety measures were collected for following 5 hours. All parameters were analyzed using ANOVA and (where appropriate) baseline values as covariates. Results of 5 of the 6 treatments were reported here. When compared to the control, none of the added carbohydrates affected any of the satiety/hunger parameters, when based on single time points or on area-under-the-curve values. However, time-to-return to-baseline values were significantly improved by pullulan for all satiety parameters except fullness. All test bars were liked significantly less than the control bar. These carbohydrates added to meal replacement bars at the levels tested generally did not affect acute satiety responses. The efficacy of these carbs might be increased by testing them for a longer period or by increasing the level by supplying them twice a day. Background: The regulation of hunger and satiety is complex. The possibility that meal duration may affect these processes has not been adequately addressed. Aim: To evaluate possible differences in the subjective perception of hunger and satiety when healthy males consume the same meal at different rates. Methods: Nine healthy male nonobese volunteers (BMI =26.06\u00b14.45 Kg/m 2 , age =29.9\u00b14.1) consumed the same meal (300 ml ice-cream, 675 Kcal) in three sessions of different duration and in random order: In session A the meal was divided and consumed in 5 minutes and in sessions B and C in 30 and 60 minutes respectively. Visual analogue scales (VAS) for assessment of the subjective feelings of fullness and hunger were filled out by all subjects before, during the meal, and at 30 minute intervals for 2.5 hours after the end of the meal. The subjective feelings of fullness and hunger induced by meal consumption for each session were expressed as area under the curve of postprandial VAS measurements adjusted for time (AUC-A, AUC-B and AUC-C). Results: AUC values for the fullness VAS were not significantly different between the three sessions. However, for the hunger VAS they were significantly higher in session C compared to sessions A and B (AUC-C= 23.5 \u00b17.2 vs AUC-A= 8.5 \u00b16.4 mm [P=0.08], vs AUC-B= 10.6 \u00b18.1 mm [P=0.03]). There was no significant difference between AUC-A and AUC-B for the hunger VAS. Conclusion: Meal duration affects the subjective perception of hunger but not that of satiety in healthy male subjects. Methods: 30 MetS subjects aged 32 -70 years (13 men and 17 women) were enrolled in a 3-month intervention trial. The treatment protocol included: dietary regiment combined with 1 g PUFAs each day (Olisalvin Omega-3 forte, Actavis\u00ae). The following parameters: body weight, fat mass, lipids, fasting plasma glucose, HOMA-IR and plasma adiponectin levels were assessed before and after the treatment period. Eating habits were measured using modified and translated Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ). In addition, stress levels of the subjects were evaluated using validated questionnairies. Results: After 3 months period the lipid levels were lowered. There was an overall decrease of body weight on average between 3 to 1 kilos, which could be explained by the adherence to the dietary regimen. In 36.6 % of all subjects was observed increase of the adiponectin levels.",

Method: 75 morbid obese (bariatric surgery candidates) and sixty-nine non obese filled Social-demographic and Life History Questionnaire, Adult Attachment Scale, Brief Symptoms Inventory, NEO-Five Factor Inventory, Ways of Coping Questionnaire. Results: 88% of the obese participants report at least one type of adverse childhood experience, 59% have psychopathology, and the anxiety attachment dimension is high. Adversity was positively related with psychopathology, attachment dimension \"anxiety\", neuroticism and negatively with direct coping and explains a significant part of all these dimensions variance. 71 % of the non obese report at least one adverse childhood experiences and have normal scores in all dimensions of actual functioning. Obese report statistically significant more adverse childhood experiences, psychopathology, anxiety and neuroticism and less direct coping. Conclusions: Adverse childhood experiences are a significant predictor of maladaptative functioning in obese adults. Adversity and actual functioning predict psychopathology in obese participants. Considering that overeating can be a coping strategy to deal with negative emotions and emotional problems, these results should be taken in consideration in the evaluation of bariatric surgery candidates and in the post-surgery period.

The reduction in cholesterol levels in obese subjects treated with orlistat 120 mg, rimonabant or sibutramine compared with placebo were evaluated. Methodology: A total of 27 studies published during the last 5 years were selected. The search was conducted using the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register. The selection criteria were: patients at least 18 years old, with a BMI between 27 and 30 kg/m 2 (both bounds included), with one or two comorbidities related to obesity. The studies included were double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, of at least 1 year duration, and investigated any of the three medications of interest in the current study. All the studies were considered good quality, with a Delphi index that was greater than or equal to 5. Results: Orlistat 120 mg use resulted in a large reduction in the levels of total cholesterol (32.84 mg/dl) and LDL-cholesterol (30.61 mg/dl) compared with sibutramine (3.87 mg/dl and 3.36 mg/dl). For rimonabant, cholesterol levels were augmented both in the treated group and the control group. Regarding HDL-cholesterol, sibutramine and rimonabant use resulted in increases of this cholesterol while the results for orlistat were stable. Conclusion: A statistically significant reduction in total cholesterol and LDLcholesterol with orlistat 120 mg was detected, while rimonabant and sibutramine did not produce any change after 1 year of treatment.

The aim of the study is to analyze the obesity and metabolically complications (cardiovascular disease) in an rroman population of Grajduri, Iasi County, compared to the Romanian population with the same location. Methods: We focused the study on a population with ethnical particularities and high incidence of abdominal obesity. We compared the prevalence of obesity, cardiovascular risk factors and eating behaviors on an rroman population of Grajduri.

            "text": "Pretlow, R 1 1 eHealth International, Seattle, Washington, USA Generally accepted causes for the obesity epidemic include: 1) genetics (\"thrifty\" gene, weight set-point) and 2) environmental factors (widely-available high-calorie food, sedentary lifestyle). A genetic drive to consume as many calories as possible should cause individuals to overeat both low and high calorie foods, which is not the case. And the environmental theory is analogous to claiming that alcoholism, smoking, and drug addiction are all caused by the environment. Compelling evidence points to overeating as a form of substance abuse. This appears to be a significant contribution to the obesity epidemic. Food is used as a stress coping mechanism (comfort eating, displacement activity), for self-medication (depression, anxiety), and for entertainment (to combat boredom). It has been argued, \"Everyone eats for comfort and entertainment. That doesn't imply that it's causing obesity.\" [1] . One might drink a glass of wine to relax, but many unintentionally drink until intoxicated or until they become alcoholics. The same is true for food. Food qualifies as an \"addictive substance\" per FDA criteria. The food industry openly markets psychological benefits of food (\"comfort in every bar\"milkywaybar.com). In The State of Stress in America, 48% of respondents report that stress has increased over the past five years. 43% overeat when under stress. Foods eaten under stress almost exclusively are high pleasure foods, 'junk foods'. 41,000 postings on an overweight youth web forum and 65 online surveys support psychological food dependence. Obesity should be treated similarly to other forms of substance abuse, by \"sequential detox-withdrawal\" from abused foods, followed by close long-term support. Background: Obesity is a prevalent metabolic disorder in large parts of the developing world and is associated with a chronic inflammatory response, which has been proposed to have an important role in cardiovascular disease. Objective: To evaluate at short term the effects of a moderate intensity physical activity program on blood pressure, metabolic and proinflammatory markers in obese Hispanic adolescents.",

            "text": "We performed a longitudinal study in 43 asymptomatic volunteers' obese adolescents (26 female and 17 male). All subjects were submitted to aerobic exercise training during 90 minutes for 16 weeks, 5 days per week. Before and after exercise training, hemodynamic, metabolic and inflammatory parameters were measured. Results: Body weight was reduced by 4%. Blood pressure, insulin, C reactive protein, interleukine 6, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 significantly decreased whereas adiponectin levels increased. In the multiple regression analysis, change in adiponectin and adiposity were related to change in systolic blood pressure levels (R 2 = 0.26; p=0.001), whereas final maximum O 2 consumption rate and final systolic blood pressure levels were related to decrease in C reactive protein levels (R 2 = 0.79; p=0.0001). Conclusions: A short-term, moderate-intensity of aerobic exercise significantly diminished adiposity, blood pressure, metabolic, and inflammatory markers in Hispanic obese adolescents who are especially prone to develop metabolic and hemodynamic complications. Research relating to this abstract was funded by CONCYTEG grant number GTO-2005-C04-18792. Background: Topiramate has been associated with dose-dependent weight loss in obese subjects. Object: To investigate the efficacy and safety of combining low-dose topiramate with phentermine in the treatment of obese patients. Methods: Fifty obese (body mass index 30kg/m 2 ) male patients, aged 20y~55y, were included. After 4-week non-pharmacological programs, subjects were randomly assigned to a phentermine group (PHN 37.5mg) and a phentermine-topiramate combination group (PHN 37.5mg-TPM 50~100mg). All subjects were advised to follow a fixed calorie diet (1,500 kcal/d). In the PHN-TPM group, topiramate was started on 25mg/d, and the dosage increments by 25mg every other week until 100mg/d. If an intolerable adverse event occurred, the dosage decreased to the previous level. Dosing was continued for 12 weeks. Results: Forty-three subjects completely satisfied the 12-week study protocol. In a per protocol analysis, mean changes in body weight and waist circumference for PHN-TPM were -8.0\u00b12.7 kg (PHN -5.9\u00b12.5 kg, P=0.012) and -8.3\u00b13.3 cm (PHN -6.1\u00b13.6 kg, P=0.043), respectively. In a safety analysis, the frequency of adverse reactions were 88.5% (23 of 26 subjects) for PHN-TPM and 70.8% (17 of 24 subjects) for PHN without clinical significance (P=0.164). Three subjects in PHN-TPM and one in PHN stopped medication due to adverse effects. Serious adverse reactions or complications were not found. Conclusion: Combining low-dose topiramate with phentermine showed more weight reduction than phentermine only without significant drug reactions. The aim of our study was to evaluate depression and anxiety among patients entering our outpatient program for very obese patients. We used Beck\u00b4s Depression Inventory (BDI ) and Beck's Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The BDI consists of 21 questions, with scores ranging from 0 to 63. The BAI consists of 21 questions, also with scores ranging from 0 to 63. During 2004 and 2005 a total of 61 patients (49 women and 12 men) answered the BDI and BAI questions. The average age was 41\u00b110 years and the average body mass index ( BMI ) was 46.7 \u00b1 5.6 kg/m 2 . We defined depression if the BDI score was \u226510 and/or patients were using anti-depressants. We defined anxiety if the BAI score was 8. Of the 61 patients examined, 11 had normal scores, but 50 patients were depressed and/or had anxiety problems. The mean BDI score for depressed patients (N= 43) was 26.7 \u00b1 12.0 and for patients with anxiety (N=35) the mean BAI was 20.7 \u00b1 11.1. These scores are comparable to scores for patients entering psychiatric treatment for these problems. We conclude that depression and anxiety were common among the very obese patients in our study. This finding should be taken into account when organizing treatment for very obese patients. Background: The amount of sleep has recently been added to risk factors for obesity, but studies on this topic are fairly limited in Korea. We studied the relationship between the amount of sleep and obesity based on body mass index (BMI) and percent body fat in adult women. Methods: 484 patients who visited an outpatient clinic of family medicine in a university hospital in Seoul between 2004 and 2007 were recruited. 362 adult women were finally included after excluding patients with chronic systemic diseases and those taking medication that affect body weight were excluded. Family history of obesity, past medical history, physical exercise, and sleeping hours during weekdays and weekends were obtained through questionnaires. Height, weight, BMI, and body composition were measured using Bioelectric Impedance Analyzer. Results: Subjects were divided into three groups according to sleep duration; less than 7 hours, 7~8 hours, and more than 8 hours. When obesity was defined as BMI(\u226525), the group with more than 8 hours of sleep had an odd ratio of 2.21(95% CI 1.14-4.27) for obesity compared to the group with 7~8 hours of sleep after adjusting for covariates. When obesity was defined as percent body fat(\u226530%), the group with less than 7 hours of sleep had an odd ratio of 2.20(95% CI 1.01-4.80) for obesity compared to the group with 7~8 hours of sleep. Conclusion: Our study revealed that inadequate amount of sleep was associated with significantly higher odds ratio for obesity based on both BMI and percent body fat.",

            "text": "While CLA, conjugated linoleic acid, as a dietary supplement for weight management is already sold and clinically proven for more than 10 years, it is not until recently that consumers have the choice to buy CLA also as fortified foods. Despite being on the market, little is known about bioavailability properties of two main isomers c9, t11-and t11, c12-CLA and the influence of food matrix to absorption characteristics. In a randomized clinical trial with 12 volunteers, bioavailability of nearly equimolar mixtures of c9, t11-CLA and t10, c12-CLA was compared in a three way-cross over design: capsules (1) versus a new water-soluble microemulsion of CLA prepared in juice (2) versus CLA prepared in yoghurt (3). Pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed after single doses of 6.4 g CLA. The two isomers c9, t11-CLA and t10, c12-CLA showed highly parallel concentration-curve progression, reflecting their relation in the test products. The concentration time curves differed significantly between CLA out of food matrices versus capsules: time to reach C max levels was significantly shorter after uptake of juice (2.0 \u00b1 0.1h; p<0.001) and yoghurt (2.1 \u00b1 0.4h) versus capsules (4.9 \u00b1 1.4h; p<0.01). For both isomers, C max levels were significantly higher after ingestion of CLA in juice (p<0.01) and yoghurt (p<0.05) in comparison to capsules. Higher and faster maximum concentrations of CLA in plasma can be obtained both with dairy and non-dairy food matrices. As first clinical data and post-launch monitoring data from CLA fortified foods implement, effective dosages might be lower than in capsules. , 1999 , to October, 2000 . 82 (75.9 %) of these teenagers were girls aged from 12 years and 2 months to 15 years and 11months (mean age 15 years and 7 months) whose Z-score ranged from 2.29 to 5 (average BMI 35.47). 26 (24.1 %) of these teenagers were boys aged from 12 years and 4 months to 17 years and 6 months (mean age 15 years and 3 months) whose Z-score ranged from 2.5 to 4.72 (average BMI 33,45).

            "text": "The aim of our study was to investigate the efficacy of orlistat on body weight, metabolism and ovulation restored in obesity adolescents with menstrual disorders. A total 32 adolescent aged 14-18 years with a mean body mass index BMI 33.4\u00b14.3 kg/m 2 were examined. Twenty four (75%) adolescents had oligomenorrhea, 5 (15.6%) had amenorrhea and another 3 (9.4%) suffered from dysfunctional uterine bleeding. All patients measurements of body composition, glucose and insulin response to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), fasting lipids and leptin, hormonal profile before and 6 month treatment with orlistat 360 mg/day as an adjunct to the hypocaloric diet and exercises. Of the 32 patients, 5 dropped out within the 1 st month of the trial due to side-effects attributable to orlistat. Results: Only 7 subjects met all 6 criteria. A further 12 met 5 criteria, 5 met 4 criteria and 6 met 3 criteria. Of those partially matching the criteria (n=23), only 8 (35%) met the requirement to eat more than 50% of calories after the last evening meal. Fifteen (65%) reported snacking during night-time awakenings but individuals who ate very late and then went to bed and slept and individuals who wake to eat, but sleep in the day and stay awake at night are excluded using the criteria. Ten subjects had other ED or sub-threshold symptoms of ED. Overlap was noted between diagnostic groups. Five subjects meeting all or some of the NES criteria also had some symptoms of other ED. Forty subjects had no disordered eating. Conclusion: The 2003 criteria appear too restrictive and are excluding significant numbers of individuals, whose disordered eating and sleeping patterns may be impacting on their obesity. Research related to this abstract has been funded by Roche Products Ltd Heart rate variability (HRV) is used to assess cardiac autonomic function. HRV decreases and the incidence of obesity increases with ageing but any interaction between obesity and age on long-term HRV is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of ageing and obesity on 24-h heart rate variability in healthy lean and obese, young and older men. A Holter recorder was used to determine 24-h HRV in 14 lean (BMI (23.6 \u00b1 1.5 kg.m -2 ) and 13 obese (BMI (32.5 \u00b1 1.8 kg.m -2 ) young men (20-37 yrs); and 22 lean (BMI (23.6 \u00b1 1.4 kg.m -2 ) and 16 obese (BMI (31.7 \u00b1 1.6 kg.m -2 ) older men (50-65 yrs). All time domain variables (SDNN, SDANN, SDNN index, rMSSD and pNN50) were measured. Age significantly influenced all time-domain variables of HRV (P\u22640.01). For most of the time domain variables of HRV (SDNN, SDANN, rMSSD and pNN50) there was a significant interaction between age and BMI (P\u22640.036). For all time domain variables, young lean men had significantly higher 24-h HRV compared to young obese men and older men (P<0.05). SDNN index, but not the other time domain variables, was significantly higher in young obese men compared to older obese men (P<0.05). No significant differences were found in 24-h HRV between lean and obese older men. In conclusion, while age significantly influenced 24-h HRV, the significant effect of BMI on HRV occurred only at the younger age and not in the older age group studied. The diagnosis of metabolic syndrome can be established when 3 or more from 5 risk determinants (waist circumference, blood pressure, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and fasting glucose) are reported. Materials and Methods: A number of 68 patiens -29 male (42,35%) and 39 female (57, 65%), with an average age 47,6 \u00b1 8,6 years, obese (BMI>30kg/m 2 ), with hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol >200mg/dl, HDL-cholesterol<40mg/dl), type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension -were included into an educational program consisting of diet and exercises. The lifestyle changes of these patients aimed to a decreasing cardiovascular risk. The educational program included a description of the risk factors and their primary prevention, a distinct diet (with decreased calory, lipid and sodium intake) and moderate intensity exercises (at least 3 days/week, for a minimum of 30 minutes). Every patient included in this program was clinically reevaluated each 2 months. Measurements of blood pressure, glycemia and lipid levels were taken after 6 months. Results Background: Obesity and associated comorbidities have developed in epidemic dimensions worlwide. Lifestyle-improving interventions are indicated for conventional, presurgical, and postsurgical treatments. In this prospective uncontrolled study, the long-term effect of a 20 week multifactorial group intervention on weight reduction was investigated with a total follow-up of 3 years. Methods: 48 women (median, range, 52, 22-69 years, BMI 31.3, 22.1-54.5 kg/m 2 ) and 33 men (55, 24-69 years, 31.5, 26.0-44.6 kg/m 2 ) completed the intervention. The intervention consisted of a 1.5 hour group meeting once a week for 20 weeks, including recommendations on diet, daily physical activity, eating habits, and stress management. 68.8% of the women and 81.8% of the men were enrolled in the 1, 2, and 3 year follow-up. Results: The weight difference in women after 20 weeks was (median, range) -6.2% (-22.4/-1.6), 1 year -5.8% (-25.0/+2.9), 2 years -7.0% (-32.9/+10.0), and 3 years -7.5% (-27.1/+11.4). In men, the difference after 20 weeks was -6.3% (-22.6/0.0), 1 year -5.3% (-20.4/+8.5), 2 years -4.6% (-15.9/+3.2), and 3 years -5.0% (-15.0/+7.1) with p>0.05. After 1 year, 87.9% of the women and 92.6% of the men showed reduced body weight, after 2 years 87.9% and 74.1%, and after 3 years 81.8% and 77.8%, respectively. Conclusions: 80% of the patients maintained a weight reduction of 5-8% of their initial weight throughout 3 years following a 20 week multifactorial lifestyle-improving group intervention. The multifactorial approach presents a more optimistic outlook than monofactorial strategies. Interventions of longer duration are likely to yield improved long-term success rates. The aim of the present study was to verify body composition, psychosocial issues, eating behavior and physical activity of NWO women. 23 healthy non-obese (BMI < 25 kg/m 2 and Fat % < 30%), 42 NWO (BMI <25kg/m 2 and Fat % > 30%) and 123 preobese (BMI = 25-30 kg/m 2 and Fat % > 30%) women without metabolic syndrome were studied. Anthropometrical variables, body composition and fat distribution evaluated by DXA, cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors, basal metabolic rate by indirect calorimetry, assessment of physical activity, presence of depression, binge eating and yo-yo phenomenon were evaluated and compared between groups. Mean age was the same in all groups. Total and abdominal fat but not body weight or CVD risk factors were significantly different between healthy non-obese and NWO women. Compared with healthy non-obese women, NWO women presented significantly more frequently depression, binge-eating, yo-yo phenomenon and had lower physical activity levels. NWO women, a group of women at risk, can be misclassified if body fat and fat distribution are not evaluated. NWO women are vulnerable because, except of the signs of early inflammation related to the excess body fat, they seem to be less active, frequently depressed and present more frequently binge eating and greater oscillations of their body weight. Regulatory guidance on the design of studies evaluating weight loss medications differs with respect to requiring a dietary lead-in. Weight loss during the first 12 weeks of treatment with orlistat 120 mg has previously been shown to be a good indicator of long-term weight loss, whereas loss of >2.5 kg during a 4 week lead-in adds little predictive benefit [1] . A similar analysis was conducted for orlistat 60 mg by pooling data from two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. After a 4 week lead-in with a hypocaloric, low-fat diet, subjects (BMI 28-43 kg/m 2 ) were randomised to treatment. Data presented are for subjects who completed 1 year of treatment. For subjects who lost >3% baseline weight after 12 weeks of treatment, mean relative weight loss at 6 months was 8.1% (n=200) compared with 1.3% (n=114) in subjects who lost <3% (p<0.0001). Findings were similar at 1 year. Loss of >5% weight at 12 weeks was also closely associated with long-term weight loss. Conversely, lead-in weight loss (>2.5 kg or <2.5 kg) provided lower predictive value for relative weight loss at 6 months in those who lost >3% (8.8%; 6.8%) or <3% (1.1%; 1.3%) at 12 weeks (p=0.0083). No relationship was observed between weight loss during the lead-in and at 1 year (p=0.4120), nor did it have a significant effect on weight loss at 6 months or 1 year in subjects who lost >5% weight at 12 weeks. Weight loss achieved after 12 weeks treatment with orlistat 60 mg is an accurate predictor of successful weight loss at 6 and 12 months. Lead-in weight loss provides little additional value. Hospital AZ Jan Portaels, Vilvoorde, Belgium Rationale: Last years obesity is treated more frequently with bariatric malabsorptive surgery. However the long term safety and complications of these procedures are not well known. I describe here seven female patients who underwent about seven years ago a bariatric surgery procedure for treatment of obesity, now presenting with severe osteomalacia and bone loss. Methods: Out of the ambulatory endocrinology clinic, I describe seven patients suffering from severe bone pain and -fractures. All these patients have characteristics of osteomalacia and in the past a bariatric procedure. All patients underwent clinical examination, fasting blood sample for calcium, alkalic fosfatase, vitamin D and PTH. Results: Mean age of the patients is 39 \u00b1 6 years Duration of operation is 9.2 \u00b1 3 years Mean loss of weight is 27 \u00b1 3 kg Mean BMI is 27.3 \u00b1 4.2 kg/m\u00b2 All patients had hypocalcaemia with a mean value of 7.9 \u00b1 0.4 mg/dl normal 8.6-10.2 mg/dl Mean vitamin D-status is 9.7 \u00b1 1.8 mg/dl normal 7.1-45 mg/dl All patients had an elevation of PTH 173 \u00b1 22 mg/dl normal 9-78 mg/dl Alkalic fosfatase : 277 U/l \u00b1 37 normal 240 U/l Conclusion: In this case report I present seven post-bariatric surgery patients with severe osteomalcia with hypocalcaemia, vitamin D-deficiency and secondary hyperparathyreoidia. All patients had sever bone pain and vertebral fractures. The osteomalacia in this patients is caused by malabsorptive bariatric surgery and can be considered as a long term complication of this procedure. The treatment of this patients is difficult and consists of oral and intravenous administration of calcium and vitamin D. Further larger studies are needed to examine the frequency of this severe long term complication and when planning this surgical procedure, the surgeon must evaluate and communicate to his patient this possible severe complication. On the 1 st session of clients with eating disorders (ED) there must be a mutual consultation of both dietitian and psychologist. It helps to design effective individual program of nutritional and psychological treatment. Every specialist has his own specific number of tasks. Dietitian clarifies the client request, obtains the history, appoints the examination, forms the primary diagnosis, clears up individual food strategies which let the doctor determined the level of ED. The obtained information determines the further approach of the treatment, gives a possibility to offer an individual nutrition program, to prescribe the individual diet, which meet the client's requirement, taking into consideration his somatic state. The psychologist focuses on defining the primary psychological profile, motivation level, actual psychological problems and inner personal resources. The level of cooperation, optimal number of sessions and planned level of psychological assistance are evaluated. Clients' detailed informing by the psychologist and dietitian helps to choose an optimal and the most comfortable and convenient program. This results in contracting the treatment program. The contracting helps to motivate doubting and unconscious clients and select out unmotivated people. The creation of comfortable and confidential climate by psychologist and dietitian gives the positive direction of treatment and brings to successful results. Cooperation of the specialists, the opportunities of mutual assistance are of prior importance. Mutual initial session provides faster and more objective helps to define approximate period and initial plan of treatment. This allows the therapy to obtain the results more effectively.",

More recently a new anthropometric index, the ratio between height (m) at cube and waist (cm) at cube (H 3 /W 3 ) has been proposed. Aim of this study was to evaluate whether parameters obtained with BIA can be used as predictors of qualitative weight loss in obese patients undergoing non-pharmacological treatment. Free Fat Mass (FFM) is correlated with H 3 and therefore we evaluated possible relations among H 3 /W 3 and BIA parameters. An observational cohort study was performed on a consecutive series of 142 obese. The follow up was of 3,6,12 months. The parameters measured were: weight loss, waist, BMI, blood pressure, FFM, Fat Mass (FM), Total Body Water (TBW), Muscle Mass (MM). The analysis was performed by intention to treat, with a weight loss >5% of initial body weight defined as a therapeutic success. A multivariate analysis, after adjustment for age and sex, showed that H 3 /W 3 correlates in a different way on the basis of the follow up: in the short term it is negatively correlated with the weight loss; in the long term this parameter is significantly correlated with FFM and inversely with FM. H 3 /W 3 could be an easy to use anthropometric index useful in monitoring obese patients following a weight loss program based on lifestyle intervention.",

Our aim was to record dietary habits and physical activity in adolescents in a rural region. Methods: The study included 668 students [14.26\u00b10.33 years old, Body Mass Index (BMI): 22.04\u00b10.20 Kg/m 2 ] attending randomly selected schools. The students were subjected to anthropometric measurements and were asked to fill in a questionnaire regarding dietary behavior and physical activity. A diet score was developed taking into account the weekly consumption of meat, legumes, fruits, vegetables, full fat dairy products and snacks. In particular, we assigned ratings from 1 to 3 for each food group with higher scores indicating consumption closer to the Mediterranean pattern. Results: Overall prevalence of overweight and obesity was 24.6% and 10.5% respectively. Mean diet score did not differ between normal BMI and overweight/obese students (9.43\u00b10.11 vs. 9.67\u00b10.14 respectively, p=0.07). However normal BMI students reported higher level of physical activity compared to overweight/obese (1.27\u00b10.03 vs. 1.06\u00b10.04 hours/day respectively, p<0.001). Boys also, spent more time in physical activity in comparison with girls (1.40\u00b10.04 vs. 1.01\u00b10.03 hours/day respectively, p<0.001). Conclusion: A high prevalence of obesity was recorded in our population. Physical activity was higher in boys and in students with normal BMI. In contrast, dietary habits did not correlate with BMI, fact which could reflect dieting or knowledge of favorable choices or even underreporting in obese individuals. Although obesity is closely associated with diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, there is still no definitive method for healthy weight-loss in a short term. We have developed a novel anti-obesity method according to the Traditional Chinese Medicine which named Sai-Style Chinese Qigong Meridian Therapy (SQT). SQT can enhance the life energy qi through whole body acupressure (Dianxue), and make the qi circulate the entire body smoothly and consequently results in healthy weight-loss. Here, we try to report 68 Japanese female cases of effective weight-loss by SQT from June 2004 to September 2005. SQT was performed 25 min at a time, 3~5 times a week. The average age and height were 36.55 years and 158.35 cm, respectively. The average body weight, body fat percentage, and body mass index (BMI) were reduced from 62.18 kg, 32.43%, and 24.80 kg/m 2 to 56.77 kg, 27.78 % and 22.64 kg/m 2 respectively after 20 sessions of SQT within 1 month, and were further decreased to51.62 kg, 24.52% and 20.59 kg/m 2 after 40 sessions of SQT within 2 months. SQT also succeeded in controlling food intake at minimum levels without feeling hungry. Symptoms such as constipation, irregular menstrual cycling, menstrual pain, humpback, swelling, and cold hands or feet also reduced markedly or disappeared after SQT. In conclusion, SQT is a novel and very effective method to treat overweight and obesity. We are planning to explore the molecular mechanisms of SQT and popularize this healthy therapy in Asia, America and Europe in the near future.",

Various partial meal replacement low-calorie diets(PMR-LCDs) plans are a popular option for Korean people with metabolic syndrome in the weight loss and maintenance program. The effectiveness of high protein PMR-LCDs(P-PMR-LCDs) and nutritionally balanced conventional PMR-LCDs(C-PMR-LCDs) on visceral obesity is, however, still unknown in Korean people with metabolic syndrome. We aimed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of P-PMR-LCDs and C-PMR-LCDs on reduction in visceral obesity. Method: Eighty obese adults with metabolic syndrome were double-blinded, randomized to either P-PMR-LCDs group and C-PMR-LCDs group. Visceral fat area was measured with computed tomography(CT) and total body fat mass was measured with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry(DEXA), each before and after the 12-week trial. Participants got diet meal plan at 1200 calorie a day for women and 1500 calorie a day for men from clinical dietitian and received a six session of dietary counseling every other week. Result: Visceral fat area by CT was decreased in the amount of -23.1 \u00b1 30.0cm 2 in P-PMR-LCDs group and -30.5 \u00b1 30.2cm 2 in C-PMR-LCDs group(P value 0.248). Total fat mass by DEXA was also decreased in the amount of -2.5 \u00b1 2.2kg in P-PMR-LCDs group and -2.3 \u00b1 2.2kg in C-PMR-LCDs group(P value 0.770). Conclusion: 12-week diet plan for obese patients with metabolic syndrome using both P-PMR-LCDs and C-PMR-LCDs were associated with significant and comparable weight loss and improvements on visceral obesity. But, no significant differences were observed between two groups in this study. Glycomacropeptide (GMP) is a peptide that has been shown to stimulate release of cholecystokinin which may promote satiety. Aim: The aim of this 1-year study was to examine whether greater weight loss could be achieved and sustained with a GMP-enriched whey powder supplement compared to a skim milk powder supplement. Methods: In a randomised, double blind, parallel design study using meal replacements, participants had weight, body composition (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry), blood pressure, fasting lipids, glucose and insulin measured at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Supplements contained 15g protein from GMP-enrichedwhey-protein-isolate (T1), or skim-milk-powder (T2) and 900 kJ/sachet. Volunteers were advised to consume 2 sachets/day instead of 2 meals for 6 months and 1 sachet/day for a further 6 months. One hundred and twenty seven participants (34 men, 99 women, 95.5\u00b115.4 kg, BMI 33.4\u00b13.4 kg/m 2 , 50.0\u00b112.4 yr) commenced, 82 completed 6 months and 72 completed 12 months of the study. Results: At 6 months weight loss was -9.5\u00b15.8 vs -11.0\u00b16.0 kg, T1 and T2 respectively and -9.9\u00b18.8 vs -10.8\u00b17.4 kg T1 and T2 respectively at 12 months (P<0.001 compared with baseline, at both time-points) with no differences between treatments. Total and LDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerols, glucose and insulin, systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased at 6 and 12 months (All P<0.01 compared with baseline with no difference between treatments). HDL-cholesterol was significantly increased at 12 months (P<0.001 compared with baseline). Conclusion: Weight loss of 10kg was sustained after 12 months with improvements in cardiovascular disease risk markers. GMP had no additional effect.

Bio-impedance spectrometry (BIS) is a quick and easy tool for clinical practice, less expensive and without radiation. The aim was to validate published equations for the prediction of fat free mass (FFM) based on bio-electrical impedance, with DXA as reference in obese adolescents. Methods: Predictive equations were included when based on weight, height, gender, age, impedance, resistance and/or reactance data. FFM was measured with bio-impedance spectroscopy and DXA. Accuracy of equations was evaluated by the root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE), the mean percentage difference between methods (bias), and the percentage of patients predicted within 5% of FFM measured by DXA. Results: Included were 33 predictive equations and 85 (F 49, M 36) obese adolescents. Mean age 14.6 y, mean BMI 33.3 (range 24.0-44.5) kg/m 2 . The RMSPE ranged from 2.9-27.5 kg and the percentage of patients with acceptable prediction ranged from 75-0 % depending on the equation used. The DeLorenzo equation (FFM = 2.330 + 0.588 Height (cm) 2 /Resistance (Ohm) + 0.211 Weight (kg)) had almost lowest RMSPE (3.0 kg), smallest bias (-1 %) and the highest percentage (75 %) of subjects predicted well. This was consistent over gender, BMI and age groups. Conclusion: When bio-impedance spectroscopy is used in obese adolescents 12-18 years of age, the most accurate predictive equation for fat free mass appears the DeLorenzo equation.

Widespread popularity of high protein diets, questioned the superiority of these diets in how best can achieve both weight loss and clinical benefit by these diets. We aimed to evaluate the effects of high protein diets on weight loss and cardiovascular disease risk including inflammatory proteins in obese women. Methods: Twenty-eight (20-48 y) obese women (BMI: 30-41 kg/m\u00b2) were assigned to a high protein (HP: 30% of energy) or a standard protein (SP: 15% of energy) diet, for 10 weeks of weight loss dietary intervention.

Exercise-induced lipolysis in subcutaneous adipose tissue was assessed using microdialysis and glycerol concentrations were measured in two microdialysis probes: one being perfused with Ringer solution and the other with phentolamine (alpha adrenergic antagonist). In control conditions the exercise-induced lipolysis in subcutaneous adipose tissue was lower in obese than in lean subjects and it was potentiated by phentolamine only in obese. During insulin infusion, the exercise-induced lipolysis was reduced in lean subjects by 67% and 71% in control and phentolamine probe, respectively, and only by 39% and 26% in obese. The exercise-induced responses of catecholamines were similar in both conditions in lean as well as in obese subjects. Results suggest that the antilipolytic effect of insulin in adipose tissue is present during the exercise and that the obese subjects are, when compared to lean, resistant to this action of insulin. This resistance may be one of the elements of the reduced flexibility of metabolic responses in obese individuals. Background: Maintenance of weight loss is a core problem in the treatment of obesity. Structured Weight control programs can improve maintenance and body composition in obesity. Objective: To assess long-term effects of body weight and body composition during a standardized obesity program emphasising on fat loss Design and Methods: Obese patients (n=508) were recruited in a primary care setting and followed a standardized obesity program using meal replacements (AENGUS \u00ae , Austria). Body composition was evaluated by both conventional and vector bioelectrical impedance analysis (RXc Graph). Patients having completed up to 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, or more than 30 months of the treatment program (groups I-VI) were analysed, the results were compared to their baseline data.

Whether the linking factor is insulin resistance or hypersecretion, obese subject are thrice more likely to develop T2DM than lean subjects, irrespective of other factors. The risk also increases with increasing BMI. Therefore reducing the demands on islet cells by reducing the contact between food and foregut and weight reduction should be beneficial in treating and, indeed, curing T2DM. All types of bariatric procedures showed beneficial effect on glycaemic control, with gastric banding (GB) leading to a normalisation in oGTT in more than 50% of subjects.

Sixty participants were divided randomly into 3 treatment groups (PG: peanut, MG: mix and PMG: peanut + mix). Each participant completed 4 sessions (1 control meal, 1 control snack, 1 treatment meal and 1 treatment snack). Appetite, anthropometric indices, body composition, physical activity and dietary intake were monitored during the sessions. Plasma leptin, ghrelin and insulin analyses were conducted on a 30 volunteer subsample. Individuals felt hungrier when peanuts were added to a meal of sandwich + banana + chocolate (control) compared to an isocaloric amount of the same meal without peanuts. The same held for the addition of the MG which was matched to the peanuts on volume, energy and macronutrient distribution. This result may be due to smaller gastric volume associated with the PG and MG loads compared to control. Participants also reported a stronger desire to consume something sweet on days the PG and MG were consumed. The control meal also led to a more rapid meal termination. No significant differences were observed in hormone concentrations. In this study, the addition of peanuts or a mix with similar volume, energy content and macronutrients distribution did not augment satiety or appetitive hormone responses relative to isoenergetic meals without these loads. The prevalence and incidence of obesity increase during the last 10 year in whole world. In Czech Republic more than 25% inhabitants are obese. Obesity is a risk factor leading to many serious civilization diseases. Complex access using pharmacotherapy is real good way to lose weight. Methods: In 212 obese men and 28 obese women with BMI over 30 kg/m 2 and with failure of lipid metabolism the reduction of body mass was carried out. The whole pharmacotherapy was 4 months. The changes of selected anthropometric (weight, BMI, % of fat, WHR) and biochemical (TAG, GLY, TCHOL, HDL, LDL) parameters were monitored. Goal: Monitor of effect of taking a dose of 10mg of sibutramin a day. By patients meet inclusion criteria. Results and conclusion: After a 4-month pharmacotherapy reduction we noticed that average decrease of weight was 6,8 kg, of BMI 2,0 kg/m 2 . In both group (men also women) was found statistically significant decrease of body fat. The decrease of whist was 5,2 cm in group of men and 6,6 cm in group of women. The positive effect therapy of decrease of level TCHOL, GLY, TAG was noted too. The level of HDL was not changed. We evaluated, in man, the relative role of various factors involved in the lipid mobilization during exercise like insulin, adrenergic system, Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) and growth hormone (GH). Eight lean young men matched for age and physical fitness performed a 60 min exercise bouts at 50% of their maximal oxygen consumption one day under placebo infusion and another day under octreotide infusion. Lipolysis in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) was evaluated using local microdialysis with selected antagonists: phentolamine (alpha-AR antagonist), propranolol (beta-AR antagonist) and aminoplylline (PDE inhibitor). Octreotide infusion at rest decreased plasma insulin which remained low during exercise. Octreotide suppressed the exercise-induced increase of plasma epinephrine and GH. In both conditions, norepinephrine and ANP increased similarly during exercise. The increase of plasma glycerol concentrations during exercise was largely majored under Octreotide. In the microdialysis Ringer probe, the exercise-increased dialysate glycerol concentrations (DGC) were higher under octreotide than placebo. In the phentolamine and propranolol probe, the higher DGC under octreotide than placebo revealed the contribution of insulin during exercise. The lack of difference in DGC between phentolamine probe and phentolamine plus propranolol probe under octreotide suggest the absence of norepinephrine involvement. But under placebo, DGC were lower in phentolamine plus propranolol probe than in phentolamine probe, showing the beta-adrenergic action of epinephrine. In aminoplylline probe, the DGC were strongly enhanced in both conditions at rest, and the lack of difference in exercise-increased DGC between placebo and octreotide conditions argues for a possible ANP contribution.",

The presence of Arg16Gly polymorphism in ADRB2 gene has been related to insulin resistance. The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of EGCG in the insulin resistance of obese women with Arg16 allele in ADRB2 gene after a hypocaloric diet treatment. 38 healthy obese women (BMI>30 kg/m 2 ) followed a balanced hypocaloric diet (REE, Vmax, x 1.3 -600kcal/day) during 12 weeks. They were divided into 4 groups according to genotype (RT-PCR real time), Arg carriers (Arg-Gly + Arg-Arg) and Gly-Gly group, and treatment (EGCG, 99% TEAVIGO, or placebo, 300 mg/day). BMI, body composition (DEXA) and blood insulin and glucose (ELISA) were assessed before and after treatment and HOMA-IR was calculated. There were not statistically significant differences in weight (P=0.960) and fat mass loss (P=0.890) between the groups. There was a significant interaction effect (P=0.013) of genotype in the response to the EGCG treatment on the HOMA-IR change adjusted with weight loss.

Backgrounds: Mesotherapy is widely used for aesthetic management of localized fat or cellulite in developed countries without sufficient evidence. This study was performed to verify the efficacy and safety of ephedra and green tea mesotherapy on fat mobilization. Methods: Twenty-five otherwise healthy 20-35 year-aged overweight women (body mass index 23kg/m 2 ) were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups: experimental (ephedra and green tea mesotherapy) group (n=13), placebo (saline) group (n=12). Total 8 times of herbal mesotherapies were performed once a week, the previous 4 times were performed on right thigh (1st period), after wash-out of 1 week, the latter 4 times were performed on left thigh (2nd period) without any modification of diet or exercise. Body composition, thigh circumference were measured at each period before and after. Subcutaneous fat was measured by CT scan at the 1st period before and after and free fatty acid (FFA) was measured immediately before 1st treatment, 1 hour later, 24 hours later, and 7 days later. Subjective satisfaction score and adverse events were also evaluated. Results: In the subcutaneous fat, there were no significance between groups, but in the circumference, experimental group had significant change when compared with placebo group (p<0.05). In serum FFA, experimental group has significant elevation in 1 hour after the 1st treatment (p<0.05). There were no serious adverse events in both groups. Conclusions: Herbal mesotherapy with ephedra and green tea may have possibility of size-reduction effect on localized fat through regional lipolytic action. Key words: mesotherapy, localized fat, ephedra, green tea Acknowledgement: This research was funded by The Society of Korean Medicine for Obesity Research. Objective: Childhood obesity shows an increasing tendency in the developed countries meaning a predisposing factor to the later cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adulthood. We investigated the effects of lifestyle changes on three adipokines -leptin, adiponectin, TNF-level -and on the activity of PON1 because of their main role in the process of atherosclerosis. Patients and methods: 23 obese, non-diabetic children (age: 11.45\u00b11.82 years) took part in a two-week long program consisting hypocaloric diet and regular physical activity. Levels of adipokines -leptin, adiponectin, TNF--and paraoxonase and arylesterase activity of PON1 were measured before and after the intervention. Results: Two-week long diet and physical activity resulted in the significant decrease of the anthropometric data (BMI: 29.13\u00b15.05 vs. 27.79\u00b14.9 kg/m\u00b2 p<0.0001; body fat percentage (BFP): 41.3\u00b16.37 vs 40.0\u00b16.86% p<0.001), in leptin (55.02\u00b133.42 vs. 25.76\u00b119.94 ng/ml p<0.0001) and significant increase in adiponectin levels (7.53\u00b13.26 vs. 8.79\u00b13.44 \u03bcg/ml p<0.05) and PON1 paraoxonase activity (107.19\u00b172.87 vs. 121.75\u00b193.48 U/l p<0.05). We found significant correlation between leptin and adiponectin (r=-0.402 p<0,05); TNF-(r=0.321 p<0.05). Conclusion: Our data suggest that short-term lifestyle changes resulting in weightloss influence the metabolic state to an antiatherogenic direction in obese children regarding the changes in leptin, adiponectin levels and PON1 paraoxonase activity. This draws attention to the importance of physical activity and appropriate nutrition in childhood.

Introduction: The aim of the study was to assess the influence of eight-week weight reduction therapy with use of orlsitat on solid phase gastric emptying in obese subjects. Patients and methods: 40 obese women were enrolled into the study and randomly assigned to the weight-reducing treatment with use of orlistat (age 28.2 \u00b1 6.3 y, BMI 37.7 \u00b1 7.4 kg/m 2 ) or placebo (age 28.8 \u00b1 7.2 y, BMI 36.6 \u00b1 5.6 kg/m 2 ). All the subjects received weight reducing program consisting of fat-and simple carbohydrate-restricted 1200 kcal diet and regular physical activity (30 minutes three times a week). Gastric emptying was assessed with breath test method with use of the test meal (a pencake consisiting of 355 kcal with addition of 13 C-octanoic acid) and evaluation of 13 CO 2 content in air samples taken after eating test meal. Results: Weight reduction was 9.1 \u00b1 4.1 kg (9.0 \u00b1 3.2 %) and 5.8 \u00b1 3.2 kg (5.9 \u00b1 3.2 %) in placebo group. Background: Sibutramine administration has been proved efficacious in terms of weight loss but requires parallel monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate. Verapamil sustained release/Trandolapril 180/2 mg (Ve/Tra) is a fixed combination indicated for the treatment of hypertension in patients who require more than one agent to achieve blood pressure (BP) targets. Objective: The primary end-point of this study was to evaluate the 6-month effect of sibutramine and Ve/Tra combination on blood pressure and heart rate in obese patients who had grade 1 hypertension (140-159 and/or 90-99 mmHg). Secondary end-points were the effects on anthropometric and metabolic variables. Methods: Patients (n=32) received a low-fat low-calorie diet and prescribed a combination of sibutramine 10 mg and Ve/Tra 180/2 mg daily for 6 months. Results: Combined treatment resulted in significant body mass index reduction. Significant reductions in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were observed (14.1% for SBP and 15.1% for DBP, p < 0.01) at the end of the 6-month treatment. After the 6-month treatment 78% of patients had BP readings below 140/90 mmHg. None of our patients experienced blood pressure increase during treatment. Heart rate did not significantly change during this period. Significant reductions were also observed in HOMA index, total cholesterol, triglycerides and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (all p<0.05).

Introduction: Energy restriction in diet (D) and increasing physical activity (Ex) must be the primary lifestyle-intervention for improving the risk for developing metabolic syndrome (MS), which is a common cause of cardiovascular diseases. However, the inherent effect of each intervention on improving the anthropometric measures as well as the risks have not yet been clearly elucidated. This study investigated the effect of each Ex and D intervention on the anthropometric measures and metabolic parameters in patients with MS. Methods: Twenty-one obese Japanese subjects (10 males, 11 females; age 40-75 years) who demonstrated risk factors regarding the diagnostic standards of the Japanese committee on MS, participated in a weight loss program during a 12-week period. The subjects were randomly assigned to either the D group or Ex group. The maximal oxygen uptake during a graded cycling test was assessed as an index of cardiorespiratory fitness. The percentage of whole body fat was measured by the underwater method. Results/Discussion: Both groups achieved a substantial BW loss. The waist circumference and lean body mass significantly decreased in the D group, whereas they did not change substantially in the E group. In addition, the arteriosclerosis index and small dense LDL both significantly improved in only the E group. Our results suggested that exercise intervention has beneficial effects to improve the lipid profiles in MS without dramatically changing any anthropometric measures, including the waist circumference in comparison to diet intervention.

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of 12 weeks of low calorie diet (LCD) included in the nutrition counseling on metabolic syndrome risk factors in the overweight and obese men and women in Korea. A total of 44 subjects (17 men, 27 women) who were healthy and overweight or obese (BMI >25 kg/m 2 ) took parts in the study during May-October, 2007. During the study period, the subjects attended nutrition counseling 4 times and consumed 1,100-1,300 kcal/day. Body weight, fat mass (FM), fat free mass (FFM), waist circumference, blood pressure, blood lipid profiles (triacylglycerol, total-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, free fatty acid), glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR were measured at the beginning and end of the study. After 12 weeks of LCD, there were significant changes in body weight, FM, FFM, and waist circumference in both men and women. The means body weight loss for men and women were 4.0 \u00b1 0.5, 4.8 \u00b1 0.7 kg, respectively and the losses of fat mass were 2.31 \u00b1 0.49, 2.03 \u00b1 0.15 kg, respectively. The levels of plasma total-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol decreased significantly and free fatty acid increased. HOMA-IR increased however, glucose and insulin levels were not changed significantly. The results confirmed that the low calorie diet had positive effects on the metabolic syndrome in both men and women through their weight reduction.",

Autonomic function tests were also performed. After completion of the 3-week weight loss and training program, the patients had lost 4.1\u00b10.4 kg (P<0.01). Maximal isometric force improved by 39\u00b110%. Resting heart rate and blood pressure were significantly lower, as were the values of heart rate recorded during isometric contractions. However blood pressure values during isometric work were not significantly different after weight loss. There were no significant changes in autonomic function. The reduction in heart rate at rest and during isometric exercise suggests a lower cardiovascular load during isometric stress in obese women after completing an integrated weight-loss program. A weight-loss program with a physical training component might therefore lessen the potential cardiovascular load experienced by obese individuals during everyday tasks.

Background: While gastric bypass (GBP) is more efficient than adjustable gastric banding (AGB) on weight loss and comorbidities, we and others have previously shown that GBP is associated with a high frequency of nutritional deficiencies. Our goal was to assess the incidence of nutritional deficiencies in patients properly monitored. Methods: We performed a one year-prospective study of nutritional parameters in 70 consecutive obese patients, who have undergone bariatric surgery, including 21 AGB and 49 GBP. After GBP, multivitamin supplements were systematically prescribed and vitamin B12 supplementation was introduced only if a deficiency was observed. Results: Patients lost more weight after GBP than after AGB (40 \u00b1 13 vs 16 \u00b1 8 kg, p < 0.001). Only GBP induced significant decreases of vitamin -B12, -E, serum prealbumin and creatinin concentrations, with only minor clinical consequences. Vitamin B1, vitamin C and iron deficiencies were frequent but were not worsened by bariatric surgery. Anemia was observed in 10% of the patients after both procedures. Hemoglobin concentration was not correlated to vitamin B12 or folate concentrations but was related to iron status, which was better assessed by transferrin saturation than by ferritin in this obese population. Conclusion: Severe nutritional deficits can be avoided after bariatric surgery if patients are systematically supplemented with multivitamin and carefully monitored. However, specific care is required to avoid iron and vitamin B12 deficiencies, anemia and protein malnutrition. Introduction: Severe obesity has serious psychosocial consequences.",

Methodology: Previously validated self assessment questionnaires were used to acquire data from a person-centered perspective of obesity. These assessments were obtained at first referral visits to a secondary care obesity clinic Results: 94 individuals (79 females) provided assessments, ages 18-73 years with BMI 30.2-81.1kg/m\u00b2. 76.6% identified previous attempts at weight loss. Of those, 56.9% quantified up to 50 attempts and 43.1% were unable to enumerate attempts. Nobody wanted to lose <10% of their body weight and almost half (47.8%) wanted to lose >30%. Problems with activities of daily living in this sedentary group were high: 60.6% reported moderate/high scores for difficulty (correlation with BMI = 0.3, p <0.01). They reported high levels of food cravings, poor sleep, body pain, sweating and breathlessness. Statistically significant correlations were found between food cravings and guilt, boredom and poor sleep. Beliefs indicated that 72.9% felt responsible for their own weight. While responding to questions about external locus of control only 22.8% agreed. Conclusion: Health professionals should take account of the perceptions of those who seek treatment for their obesity.

In this way, it was verified the effects of short-term multidisciplinary therapy on resting metabolic rate, the rate substrate oxidation in resting, food intake and body composition in obese Brazilian adolescents. Methods: Twenty post-puberty obese adolescents were enrolled, including 11 boys (BMI 36.00 \u00b1 4.23 wt/ht 2 ) and 9 girls (BMI 34.75 \u00b1 3.70 wt/ht 2 ). Resting metabolic rate and nutrient oxidation was measured by indirect calorimetry. Food intake was assessed by 3 days recordatory inquiry. Body composition was measured by Plethismography and visceral fat was analyzed by ultrasound. Results: We could observe a significant decrease of body mass and BMI in both groups after six months of multidisciplinary intervention. Analyzing macronutrients intake, we verified a significant decrease of the FAT and carbohydrate (CHO) intake in both gender. The FAT oxidation presented a significant increase in both gender after therapy. Conclusion: Our investigation demonstrated that short-term multidisciplinary therapy was effective to improve energy balance to promote obesity control. Results: 98% of patients considered, that bariatric procedure improved their health, 92% admitted that complies with the dietary suggestions and has healthy lifestyle with adequate exercise. 85% of patients was satisfied with the outcome of the operation. The most bothersome problems 6 months postoperatively were: feeling cold in 80% of, increased hair loss in 70%, nail brittleness in 56% of patients. There were also changes in the nutritional habits such as repugnance to meat in 73%, more willingness consume diary and fish products.

Material and Method: We included in the study a number of 180 patients who were overweighed or obese. To all patients we assessed the age, gender, height, body weight, abdominal circumference, BMI. All patients responded to an application which contained questions related to feeding habits, to possible factors involved in the appearance of obesity, and to the presence of obesity per se to the other family members. Results: 67% of our patients related about some others of their family members as being obese or overweight, while 72% of them were female patients. 39% of the family members who presented obesity were children or teens. The causes that induced the weight increase: Giving up smoking at 38%; ceasing of the physical activity at 22%; sedentariness at 80%, stress at 55%; alcohol intake at 22% of patients, bad feeding habits; fast food intake at 25%, ingestion of hyper caloric food at 85%. Out of these patients, it is important to mention that only 30% of them appreciate in an objectivable manner that the excessive aliment intake as the cause which induces obesity. Conclusions: Obesity within the family constitutes a major problem, due to its social and medical impact. It is important that the educational process regarding the nutritional elements to be extended over all the family members, in order to get aware and to correct the alimentary bad habits. Objective: In obesity the medication is useful adjunct to diet and exercise. We proposed to determine the long-term weight loss maintenance under sibutramine (Reductil \u00ae ) treatment and the efficacy of this drug on lipid profile. Material and Methods: Thirty-four obese patients (25 women and 9 men) treated with 10 mg/day sibutramine for 12 months. The inclusion criteria: age 16 to 65 years, body mass index (BMI) \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , blood pressure \u2264150/95 mmHg, pulse rate \u2264 90 beats/min. Clinical parameters was: waist circumference, hip circumference, waist/hip ratio. At initial assessment and at 6 months were measured : serum fasting glucose, total -cholesterol (total-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride. Results: Weight loss dropped from 95.3\u00b110.2 kg to 85.7\u00b110.2 kg (-10.1%) at 6 months and to 81.4\u00b110.2kg (-14.6%) at 12 months. BMI feel from 34.8kg/m 2 to 31.7 kg/m 2 (6 months) and 29.9 kg/m 2 (12 months). The mean waist circumference decreased from 99.2 cm to 94.8 cm (6 months) and to 93.9 cm (12 months). Significant reduction from baseline to the 6 months for the lipid parameters: total-C from 215\u00b138 mg/dl to 197.5\u00b138 mg/dl; LDL-C from 126.9\u00b124 mg/dl to 110.6\u00b124 mg/dl; triglyceride from 129.1\u00b146 mg/dl to 110.1\u00b146 mg/dl; HDL-C risk from 43.7\u00b18.6 mg/dl to 46.26\u00b18.6 mg/dl. Conclusion: Sibutramine therapy and lifestyle for 12 months in obesity management resulted in weight loss. The weight loss was paralleled by a favorable metabolic lipide profile for six months.

Method: 60 obese patients poorly whom type 2 diabetes was not well controlled, who were treated initialy with NPH insulin once daily + metformin, were switched on therapy with insulin glargine once daily + metformin. Insulin dosage was titrated to target FBG 100 mg/dl using a weekly forced titration algorithm. In time (initial, at 3 and 6 months) we evaluated BMI, fasting blood glucose (FBG), HbA 1 c's value and the number of hypoglycemic symptomatic episodes. Results: After 6 months of therapy with insulin glargine we obtained an important lowering in FBG (190,3\u00b122,7 mg/dl vs. 115,6\u00b113 mg/dl -p<0,001), HbA 1 c's value (8,9\u00b1 1,8% vs. 6,8\u00b1 0,8% -p<0,001) without an important increasing in BMI value (36,2\u00b13,1 kg/m 2 vs. 34,4\u00b13,7 kg/m 2 -p>0,05). Timing of administration of the insulin glargine (8 a.m. or 10 p.m.) didn't have an important influence on FBG value (98,5\u00b110,3 mg/dl vs. 110,3\u00b113,2 mg/dl) or on HbA 1 c's value (6,7\u00b10,8% vs. 6,9\u00b10,8%) when these were evaluated at 6 months. At patients treated with insulin glargine, the risk for symptomatic hypoglycemia is 1.8 times lower then in the group treated with NPH insulin. Conclusions: Insulin glargine therapy with metformin in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2, who were also obese, is associated with a better metabolic control, even on a short period (expressed by FBG) of time but also on a long period of time (expressed by HbA 1 c) without an increasing in body weight. Timing of insulin administration hasn't any influence on the metabolic control. Key words: glcemic control, hypoglycemia, insulin glargine, diabetes mellitus type2.",

Characterization of Group: 44 obese (34 female + 10 male) with 47,1 \u00b1 9,07 yo average, BMI 34,9 \u00b1 5,8 kg/m2 a 37,9 \u00b1 7,1 % fat mass. Methods: Patients with overweight and obesity attended TPPA on training heart rate (THR) prescribed after spiroergometry and CHR test. BOH level was measured before 40 minutes exercise test (BOH1), after test (BOH2) and 60 minutes after test (BOH3). The changes of BOH level durin test and after 60 minutes resting were compared with weight changes during TPPA. Results: There we no significant changes in BOH1 a BOH2 levels (0,12 mmol/l vs. 0,11 mmol/l). Increase of BOH level was observed between BOH1 a BOH3 (0,12 mmol/l vs.0,31 mmol/l; p < 0,001). The significant change weight reduction was observed during TPPA (100,8 kg vs 97,2 kg ; p < 0,001). Weight reduction positive correlates with difference of BOH level on the start of exercise test nad after 60 minutes resting after test DIFBOH1-3 (r= -0,428; p < 0,05). Conclusion: It seems that CHR test with assessment of BOH level during test and after resting could predicate weight change during weight reduction programme with physical activity. We should compare results of exercise test and BOH level group dividing according weight changes during TPPA (minimal weight changes or patients with not finished TPPA). It could help with identification of \"unsuccessful patient\" or method. Another methods or combine with other methods than only physical activity program should be prescribed in patients if weight reduction can not be predicated after TPPA. There is no conflict of interest. Funded partly in project Health plus The study into the problem of treatment of patients with BN has been carried out. The number of patients -23 females, aged 18-23; duration of counseling -weekly sessions for an hour during 3 months. Based on preliminary psychological diagnostics (MMPI, Lusher test, Spielberger's State Anxiety, Beck Depression Inventory, TAS-20), the tasks of counseling were set. With the numerous tasks and a complex character of the disease, it is advantageous to use a combination of different methods of psychotherapy. At the beginning of counseling, the use of relaxing methods, Art Therapy caused lowering of internal stress and anxiety, and gave rise to internal resources activation. Then therapeutic efforts were focused on resolution of personal and interpersonal conflicts. To replace distractive nutritional habits and irrational thoughts we used the CBT techniques. For realization of own feelings and needs, for responding to negative emotions, for integration of internal contradictions, Art Therapy and Gestalt Therapy were used. Repeated diagnostics showed: reduction in situational anxiety (P<0.0065) and depression (P<0.014); widening of range of emotional response; increase in assertiveness; rise in social activity. Against the background of improvement of emotional state, bulimia symptoms reduced. Also, we could notice a change in quality of doing drawing tasks. Previously formal and fragmentary drawings gradually came to be detailed and filled with emotions. Consequently, complex psychotherapy of patients with BN makes it possible to attack the problems thoroughly thus affording the positive changes to be made. For the effective treatment, the long-term systematic psychological counseling is required. The aim of the study was to evaluate dietary habits and leisure time activities in school children 6 to 10 years (1st to 4th class of elementary school) in the middle European region. Two methods were used: interview of the child and questionnaire given to the parent. Two hypotheses were set: 1. There are differences in children diet and leisure time activities in a small village (Horn\u00e1 Streda-Slovakia and in a big city Prague-Capital of Czech Republic). 2. Obesity and education of parents has some impact on children. By questionnaire or by interview 113 children in Prague and 95 children were evaluated. Results: The prevalence of higher then normal BMI was from 1st to 4th class in the small village: 25%, 50%. 43%, 33%, in the big town 25%, 14%, 22%. 14%. Children in the big town are eating more fried food and fast food but children in the small town are eating more fatty home made food. Children in the town have more leisure time activities. Obesity in children is more prevalent in families with obese parents in both samples. In both samples no relation was found of parents educational status (basic, middle school, university) to obesity in children.",

A special spread based on egg white was used. Egg white derived products are widely used for weight reduction in our country. Glucose level, insulinaemia and C peptide were evaluated in 0, 60, 120 minute after breakfast. Psychological questionnaire was used to evaluate the taste and satiety. 12 persons were tested on different days with both types ofbreakfast: mean age 38.5+-10.7 years, mean BMI 24.6 kg/m 2 . Results: Standard breakfast: insulinaemia 6.3\u202634.6\u202611.0 IU, C peptide 0.6\u20261.6\u20261.0 pmol/l, glucose 5.0\u20265.4\u20264.8mmol/l Low energy breakfast: insulinaemia 6.6\u202624.6\u202610.7 IU, C peptide 0.6\u20261.4\u20261.0 pmol/l, glucose 4.8\u20265.1\u20265.0 mmol/l .Paired t-test was used for evaluation. Now difference in blood glucose level was found, borderline significances of insulinemia in 60 minute (p= 0.056) and in C peptide (p= 0.089). Significant difference in decrease of insulinemia between 60 and 120 minute (p= 0.03) and borderline significant decrease in C peptide (p=0.055) shows shorter insulin secretion after low calorie breakfast and good insulin sensitivity in this group of lean subjects. Higher satiety and worthier taste were found using low energy breakfast. Conclusion: Low calorie breakfast induces lower and shorter insulin secretion and has a good metabolic effect in lean subjects. Testing in obese subjects will follow.

A second visit was carried out at 30-45 days distance to verify correct application of previous counselling and eventual nutritional modification; if lab results show metabolic alterations an individual diet is designed. !3 over 34 children had a pathological obese first degree relative within the family When present a member of the family in weight excess the child would change effectively his/her alimentary habits (p 0,0009) and/or will present with increasing body weight during follow-up (p 0,0015), furthermore compliance to diet counselling is extremely low (p<0,0001). The family and the presence of obesity in other members or the family has a fundamental infuence on the treatment of children affected by pathological obesity. The patient undergone treatment with diet (proteins 20 en.%) and Orlistat 120 mg 3 times/daily for 6 -month period. In this case it was impossible to advise increase in the physical activity. Results: At the end of the study we found body weight reduction with 40 kg, waist circumference decreased with 22 cm and fat mass -with 12 %. We observed an improvement in the cardio -vascular paramaters and psychological state. Discussion: Our data show that the combination of high -protein diet with Orlistat 120 mg have a beneficial effects on the antropometric parameters in severe obesity. ",

            "text": "The traditional method for determining whether a person is overweight or obese is to determine his/her body mass index (BMI), but it doesn't work very well in the elderly. Numerous studies report a U or J shape relationship between BMI and mortality in adults, but in elderly people this is not so clear. Material and methods: In January 2000, anthropometric data of 63 institutionalized men from Madrid (aged 65 and over) were collected (weight, height, skinfolds and body circumferences), following the norms set out by the WHO. Subjects were classified as low-weight, normal-weight, overweight (OW) or obese (OB). Mortality data were taken from the sanitary records three years later. Results: BMI ranged from 16.5 to 43.7 kg/m 2 . 25.6% of the group had died in the 3 years after the onset of study. In the whole group, BMI is a protection factor for mortality (OR: 0.7; CI: 0.8-0.9; p<0.01). Taken into account the established BMI groups, the BMI is a protection factor in OW group (BMI between 25 and 30 kg/m 2 ) (OR: 0.3; CI: 0.1-1.0; p<0.05), while BMI is neither a protection nor risk factor for mortality in the other groups. Conclusions: In our elderly male group, a slight overweight seems to be a protection factor for mortality. The 25 kg/m 2 normal limit for BMI may therefore be too restrictive in elderly men, and the appropriate BMI for this age group could be higher. Introduction: Obesity is very often combined with metabolic disorders: hyperinsulinaemia, hyperleptinaemia and hypertension. These disorders can have their origin in adolescence. The aim of the study: was the assessment of leptin and insulin concentration in young hypertensives with obesity. Material and Methods: The examined group included 27 patients at the age of 17 to 19 with primary hypertension and overweight and/or obesity. Average BMI in examined group was 31,4 +/-4,5 kg/m 2 , average value of diastolic blood pressure was 148 +/-5,9 mmHg, and systolic blood pressure 92 +/-4,6 mmHg. The control group included 22 patients in similar age with proper blood pressure values, BMI 27,1 +/-3,9 kg/m 2 . Insulin and leptin were described by radioimmunological methods. Results: Average insulin concentration in patients with obesity and hypertension was 14,88 +/-7,7 \u03bcIU/ml, whereas in control group 9,2 +/-3,2 \u03bcIU/ml. Average leptin concentration in group with obesity and hypertension was 20,7 +/-7,9 \u03bcg/ml, in control group 14,8 +/-4,1 \u03bcg/ml. These results were statistically significant (p<0,05) Conclusions: Insulin as well as leptin showed higher values in group of patients with obesity and hypertension and this change was statistically significant.",

Materials and Methods: Selected subjects recruited retrospectively from outpatient clinic for this study were 5835 overweight or obese women. Their hip circumferences to body weight (HC/BW)rates were calculated. Median HC/BW ratio was 1.378, then subjects divided to low HC (HC/BW is <1.378) and high HC (HC/BW is > 1.378). Thereafter, we determined and compared body compositions (body mass index, abdominal fat mass), resting blood pressures, plasma lipoprotein levels, glucose homeostasis and other related biochemical parameters. Results: There were 2913 (49.9 %) subjects in low HC group and 2922 (50.1%) subjects in high HC group. Mean BMI, body fat mass, waist circumferences, abdomal fat mass, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA values, total cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid and high sensitive Creactive protein levels, counts of leukocytes, liver transaminase activities, were significantly higher in low HC/BW group than high HC/BW group (p<0.05). But mean age was not different between groups (p>0.05). Mean HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were lower in low HC/BW group than high HC/BW group (p<0.05) Conclusion: It was shown that increased hip circumferences decrease cardiovascular risk factors and incidence of type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, obese or owerweight women with high hip circumferences corrected and calculated to body weight, have lower cardiometabolic risk markers than women who have low hip circumferences to body weight. It is estimated that up to 40-70% of obesity is attributable to genetic factors. The prevalence of overweight and obesity among Iranian children (Kelishadi et al, 2003) is 8.82% and 4.5% respectively. The prevalence of monogenic forms of obesity has not previously been studied in the Iranian population.",

That is; Boiougito group with perspiration and no constipation, and Bofutsushosan group with no perspiration and persistent constipation. To provide a feeling of satiation in both groups, a therapy combining ear acupuncture (stomach, god gate, brain point), the ingestion of herbal medicine and supplementary drink (cocoa, soy bean powder, wheat germs, honey, fructose) mixed with soybean milk has found to be successful in treating overweight patients (more than one thousand patients) on an outpatient basis. Methods & Results: Two weeks after sustained auricular acupuncture in stomach point, depressant to the feeding center, 3,4-dihydroxybutilic acid (3,4-DB) increased from 174.3\u00b189.8 to 305.7\u00b1104.8 \u03bcmol (p<0.05, n=7).

Introduction: The endocannabinoid system (ECS) plays an important and not yet fully understood role in peripheral regulation of food intake, obesity, and metabolism. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been identified in CB1 receptor gene: the 3813 A /G variant in exon 4 (rs12720071) and 5489 A/G (rs2023239) in exon3. We studied a group of obese-hypertensive patients with high cardiovascular risk. The aim for our findings was to evaluate the frequency of a genetic polymorphism of CB1 and to study its correlation with clinical parameters. Methods: We analyzed 280 obese hypertensive patients (age <65 years) excluding diabetics in therapy and 280 unselected subjects coming from the same geographic region, as reference population. Genotyping for CB1 SNPs were performed using PCR-restriction length polymorphism. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) was identified by ATPIII criteria. Results: There was not difference in genotype distribution between obese hypertensive and control populations. No association was found for the 5489A/G variant, whereas the 3813 A /G variant had a significant association with the MetS. Patients with MetS had a higher frequency of ancestral allele (A/A) than obese hypertensive without MetS (P=0.033). We calculated that 3813G conferred risk for MetS of 0.4 (95%IC 0.1-0.8). Moreover, the 3813G allele was associated with higher levels of HDL in patients without statin therapy (n=201 P=0.03). Conclusion: These results suggest a role for the 3813G allele as an endocannabinoid protective factor in obese-hypertensive patients, and may provide indirect evidence to support cannabinoid antagonist treatment strategies in obesity.",

            "text": "The activity of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) in circulating mononuclear cells and muscle but not in subcutaneous adipose tissue is associated with central obesity but not physical activity in non-diabetic adults Metformin is a potent antihyperglycemic agent as well as an insulin sensitizing agent. Two mechanisms of action have been proposed in mediating its effect, inhibition of complex I of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In this study, we investigated the relationship between the two mechanisms taking the unique approach of measuring simultaneously oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and glycolysis rate in C2C12 myocytes treated with metformin. Inhibition of complex I by either metformin or phenformin lowered basal OCR and elicited a compensatory increase in glycolysis rate as measured by an increase in extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). In metformin-treated cells, palmitate addition induced an increase in OCR while glucose did not suggesting that metformin-treated cells selectively oxidize fatty acids over glucose. Palmitate-CoA can transfer electrons directly to ubiquinone in the ETC via ETF dehydrogenase while glucose cannot. Unlike metformin, treatment with the AMPK activator AICAR stimulated FAO but did not prevent glucose oxidation. Taken together, these data suggest that metformin exert their effect primarily via inhibition of complex I which leads to subsequent AMPK activation in C2C12 myocytes. This provides a mechanistic explanation of metformin's beneficial effect in lowering intramyocellular lipids leading to reduced insulin resistance. Finally, our preliminary results indicate that this mechanism did not operate in primary rat hepatocytes. This suggests that it is likely the insulin sensitization effect of metformin in energy utilization tissue (muscle) is independent of its antihyperglycemic effect in energy homeostasis tissue (liver). Funding/Research relating to this abstract was funded by Seahorse Bioscience S133 T3:PS.05 Obesity is associated with the development of low grade inflammation. Adipose tissue produces many pro-inflammatory factors (cytokines, interleukines) potentially involved in the progression of insulin resistance associated with obesity. Each step of a weight loss program is associated with molecular adaptations in adipose tissue, potentially modulating insulin sensitivity (InS) and the inflammatory status by mechanisms which remain poorly understood. Eight obese women followed 4 weeks of energy restriction (ER) and 6 months of weight stabilization (WS). Gene expression profiling of subcutaneous adipose tissue was performed using pangenomic DNA microarray during ER, WS and the whole dietary intervention (DI). We identified 596, 814 and 568 significantly regulated genes during ER, WS and DI, respectively. Although ER affected transitorily genes related to energy metabolism, WS induced a maintained down regulation of genes involved in immunity-related processes and/or encoding secreted proteins. Partial Least Square analysis (PLS) was used to model the relationship between InS improvement and differentially expressed genes within each phase. Approximately 90 genes appeared to contribute to InS variation in each optimal PLS model. It showed the involvement of inflammation-related genes during DI and identified ALOX5AP, S100A8 and MLXIPL among the most relevant genes. We validated the correlation between InS improvement and mRNA level change of these genes by RT-qPCR. This study shows that the changes in adipose tissue gene expression contributing to InS are clearly different between ER and WS/DI. Further investigations are required to identify the targets and the effects on cellular response to insulin of the new candidate genes. The hepatic left lobe volume (HLLV) has been proposed as an indicator of visceral adiposity, strongly associated with various risk factors of the metabolic syndrome. This longitudinal study was aimed to evaluate the relationship between weight loss, metabolic improvement and the reduction of liver volume in obese women. Swedish Adjustable Gastric Banding (SAGB) was chosen as a model since it produces a sustained weight loss without major alterations of the anatomy and physiology of the gastrointestinal tract. Fifty severely obese women (mean age 44.5 \u00b1 11 yr; mean BMI 43 \u00b1 5 Kg/m 2 ) were enrolled. The postoperative follow-up was 22 \u00b1 7 months. Abdominal ultrasound was performed for determination of HLLV, subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue thickness. Reduction of various anthropometric parameters was, on average, -22.5 % for BMI, -13.3 % for subcutaneous adipose tissue, -41.6 % for visceral adipose tissue and -43.6 % for HLLV. Reduction of HLLV was independently related to reduction of both BMI and visceral adipose tissue. Reduction of liver enzymes, serum glucose, insulin and triglycerides was independently related only to reduction of HLLV. Reduction of serum uric acid was independently related only to reduction of visceral adipose tissue. In conclusion, weight loss obtained by SAGB is associated with a marked reduction of liver volume. Ultrasound measurement of HLLV is confirmed as a reliable, simple and low-cost tool for the estimation of visceral adiposity in obese women. Introduction: Both genetic and environmental factors are involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Amongst environmental factors, there is raising concern regarding fructose consumption as a contributor to metabolic disorders. We therefore assessed the effects of a high fructose diet (HFrD) on hepatic fat and insulin sensitivity (IS) in offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (OffT2D), a subgroup of individuals at higher risk for insulin resistance. Methods: Male OffT2D (n=9) and controls (Ctrl, n=5) were studied in a crossover design after either a 6-day control diet or a-6 day HFrD (3.5g/kg fat free mass/day). IS was assessed by a 2-step hyperinsulinemic clamp (0.3 and 1.0 mU/kg/min) to measure liver and muscle IS. Hepatic IS index was calculated as [100\u00f7(hepatic glucose production\u00d7fasting insulin)]; whole-body IS was estimated from the glucose disposal rate. Intrahepatocellular-(IHCL) and intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) were measured by 1 H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results: HFrD increased (P<0.05) fasting plasma VLDL-triglycerides (Ctrl: +55%; OffT2D: +148%) and IHCL (Ctrl: +62%; OffT2D: +105%) and decreased ketone bodies (Ctrl: -72%; OffT2D: -61%) in both groups. Magnitude of change in VLDL-TG was greater in the OffT2D (P<0.05). Hepatic IS decreased (Ctrl: -15%, P=0.3; OffT2D: -10%, P=0.01), in association with higher alanine aminotransferase (Ctrl: +73%, P=0.1; OffT2D: +89%, P=0.01). Whole-body IS was lower and IMCL higher in OffT2D at the control condition (P<0.05). Conclusions: HFrD induced substantial hepatic alterations after 6 days. These deleterious effects of fructose were more marked in the OffT2D, meaning that they may be more susceptible to HFrD. A single bout of prolonged, moderate-intensity exercise lowers fasting and postprandial triacylglycerol (TAG) concentrations the next day. However, the TAG-lowering effect of exercise is dose-dependent and does not manifest after light exercise of low energy cost (<2 MJ). We aimed to investigate whether superimposing mild calorie intake restriction to such exercise potentiates the hypotriacylglycerolemic effect. Eight healthy, sedentary, premenopausal women (age: 27.1 \u00b1 1.3 years, body mass index: 21.8 \u00b1 0.9 kg . m -2 ) performed two oral fat tolerance tests in the morning on two different occasions: once after a single bout of light exercise (100 min at 30% of peak oxygen consumption, net energy expenditure: 1.04 \u00b1 0.01 MJ) coupled with mild calorie restriction (1.39 \u00b1 0.22 MJ) on the preceding day, and once after resting coupled with isocaloric feeding on the preceding day (control). Fasting plasma TAG, TRL-TAG and serum insulin concentrations were 18%, 34% and 30% lower, respectively, after exercise plus diet compared with the control trial (P<0.05). Postprandial concentrations of plasma TAG and TRL-TAG were 19% and 27% lower after exercise plus diet compared with the control condition (P<0.01), whereas postprandial insulin concentrations were not different. It is concluded that a combination of light exercise along with mild hypocaloric diet comprises a practical and feasible intervention to attenuate fasting and postprandial triacylglycerolemia, especially for people who cannot exercise for prolonged periods of time at moderate-to-high intensities, such as many sedentary or obese individuals.

Aim: To determine whether metabolic syndrome was associated with arterial alterations in obese children. Methods: 161 obese children aged 11.7 \u00b1 0.2 years were studied. Metabolic syndrome was defined in three different ways, two commonly used and one personal. Non-invasive ultrasonic measurements were performed to evaluate intima-media thickness (IMT), cross-sectional compliance (CSC) and distensibility, and incremental elastic modulus at the common carotid artery level. Endothelial function was assessed at the brachial artery level by flow-mediated and glyceryltrinitratemediated dilation measurements. Results: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 11.2%, 11.8% and 16.8% according to the three different definitions used. IMT was positively correlated to LDL-cholesterol (r=0.21, p<0.01) and negatively correlated to HDL-cholesterol (r=-0.17, p<0.05). In adolescents (11-18 years), CSC was negatively correlated with abdominal fat (r=-0.22, p=0.02). We found no significant difference in vascular variables between patients with and without metabolic syndrome, with any of the three definitions used. The only synergistic effects between individual metabolicsyndrome components was an effect of insulinaemia and systolic blood pressure on CSC (4.05; p<0.05). Conclusion: Metabolic syndrome in obese children was not statistically related to arterial dysfunction, whereas several of its individual components were associated with vascular alterations. These data suggest that the metabolic syndrome concept may not be helpful in managing cardiovascular risk in obese children. Instead, risk factors should be evaluated and controlled individually.",

However, this is not associated with increased metabolic disease risk. We hypothesized that adipocyte size subdistribution and number will help us understand this apparent paradox. The aim of the present study was to compare the postprandial metabolic response to the ingestion of glucose (GLUC) vs. trehalose (TRE) and sucrose (SUC) vs. isomaltulose (IMU). We hypothesized that the reduced rate of digestion and absorption of TRE and IMU will induce lower glycemic and insulinemic responses, leading to higher postprandial fat use when compared to GLUC and SUC, respectively. In a randomized, cross-over study, 10 overweight subjects (age=31\u00b1 4 y, BMI=27.7\u00b1 0.8 kg/m 2 ) were given 4 different carbohydrate drinks following an overnight fast (AM) and in combination with a subsequent standardized meal (PM). Blood and expired breath samples were taken before ingestion and then every 30 min, substrate use was measured by indirect calorimetry. Ingestion of carbohydrates in combination with a mixed meal resulted in both a lower peak glycemic response as well as \u0394AUC of TRE vs. GLUC and of IMU vs. SUC. Significant differences in peak insulinemic response and \u0394AUC were observed with TRE vs. GLUC and IMU vs. SUC during PM. Additionally, postprandial fat oxidation was higher with IMU as compared to SUC when ingested with a mixed meal (\u0394AUC/min -0.003 \u00b10.006 g vs. \u0394AUC/min -0.02 \u00b1 0.007 g). Ghrelin response was significantly reduced after ingestion of IMU compared to SUC during AM. In conclusion, the lower glycemic and insulinemic responses with IMU (combined with a mixed meal) stimulate postprandial fat use, and may represent an effective strategy to support weight loss by promoting a negative fat and energy balance. Fat accumulation in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is believed to be particularly dangerous because it is highly correlated with cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors. We investigated whether or not some weight loss interventions are better than others at targeting the reduction of VAT. We hypothesized that changes of VAT are allometrically related to changes of total fat mass (FM), regardless of the type of intervention, as defined by the differential equation dVAT/dFM = k VAT/FM where k is a dimensionless constant. We performed a systematic search of the published literature for weight loss studies that measured FM changes along with VAT changes via MRI or CT imaging. 37 studies satisfied our search criteria, representing 1407 men and women using a variety of weight loss interventions. The allometric equation accurately modeled the data with k=1.3 \u00b1 0.1 and the model had an R^2=0.73. The same equation applied for both genders as well as a wide variety of weight loss interventions including bariatric surgery, caloric restriction with or without exercise, and exercise alone. We conclude that changes of VAT are primarily determined by FM changes as well as the initial VAT to FM ratio. This work was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH, NIDDK.",

Methods: Changes in BMI(SD), fasting glucose, %S (1/HOMA-IRx100), %B (HOMA-%B) and their product, the disposition index (DI), were monitored annually from 5-10y in 218 children (126 boys) from the EarlyBird cohort. The changing relationship between %B and %S was plotted yearby-year. Results: BMI(SD) did not change significantly from 5-7y (+0.02SD, p=0.4) but rose from 7-10y (+0.17SD, p<0.001). Glucose rose (4.3-4.8mmol/l, p<0.001) throughout the 5y period, and the DI fell (186.3-115.6, p<0.001), suggesting progressive weakening of loop control. From 5-7y, the fall in DI was attributable to loss of %B, with some compensatory rise in %S (see graph). Around 7y, %S ceased to rise further, the trajectory reversed, and the continuing fall in DI became attributable to falling %S (rising insulin resistance). Conclusion: A disposition map for healthy children, with its switch in direction around 7y, has not been shown before. The trajectory is clear and may reflect the gain in BMI that precedes puberty. Its inflexion may signify a crucial event on the path towards obesity-related morbidities. Besides weight loss, quality of life (QL) is another measurement of treatment impact. If QL depends only on weight loss could be considered as surrogate and in this case could loss significance. This study investigated the relation between QL score and weight loss. The time of permanence in follow up was considered another variable of interest for QL assessment. We used the IWQOL (Impact of Weight on Quality of Life) developed in the University of Duke. It has 8 areas, validated by our team. We included 69 patients, 55 with complete data (44 women and 11men) (1.9-4.9) (<0.001) -0.04 (0.78) Fifty percent of conditioned success weight lost of 5 or 7% using Kaplan-Meier analysis was obtained at 6.3 months. We concluded obese subjects with BMI >30 improved the QL score independently of BMI decrease and the time of follow up at the clinic. To obtain at least 50% of conditional success in weight loss patients should be maintained in treatment for more than 6 months. ",

Do changes in anthropometric measures correlate to changes in CVRF and does the inclusion of baseline anthropometric measures in the prediction model improve this relationship? Methods: We examined a randomly selected population-based sample of 502 1 st and 5 th grade Swiss schoolchildren in a cross-sectional design and then followed 205 children (randomly selected control group) for 10 months. Outcome measures included hs-CRP, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and fasting insulin concentrations, HOMA-IR and blood pressure, a metabolic risk score and percent body fat (%bf; done by DXA). Exposure variables included BMI, waist circumference and the sum of 4 skinfolds (sfs).",

            "text": "In cross-sectional analyses, BMI, waist circumference and sfs were significantly correlated to hs-CRP, Insulin, HOMA, SHBG, blood pressure, the metabolic risk score (r 2 10-85%, all p<0.001), after adjusting for age group, sex and pubertal status. No clinically relevant differences between those measures were observed except that the pbf was best predicted by the sfs. Stratifying by sex, pubertal status or weight status (normal weight vs overweight or obese) did not significantly alter these results. Changes in anthropometric measures were associated with most changes in CVRF and % body fat, albeit less strongly. Adding baseline anthropometric measures to these models improved their association with changes in CVRF (r 2 3-37%, mostly p<0.05). In this total models, changes in CVRF were predominantly associated with the model that included baseline and changes of waist circumference. Conclusion: BMI in children is not inferior to other anthropometric measures in its association with CVRF in cross-sectional analyses, but might be inferior to waist circumference in longitudinal analyses. In addition to changes in anthropometric measures, baseline anthropometric measures add to the prediction of change sin CVRF. This raises the question, if there exists an entity of \"cardiovascular memory\". The inflammatory component of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in obese humans is generally evaluated by conventional histology. A better characterization of the inflammation is needed since the nature of the inflammation may have important implications for NASH progression. We have characterized the distribution of neutrophils, macrophages/Kupffer cells and activated hepatic stellate cells by immunohistochemical staining of liver sections of 41 severely obese patients, applying antibodies to human neutrophil peptide 1-3 (HNP1-3), myeloperoxidase (MPO), CD68 and alpha-smooth muscle actin. Furthermore, expression of chemokines IL-8 and CXCL1, and macrophage phenotype markers IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-10, CLEC7A and EMR-1 was determined. According to the Brunt scoring system, 16 patients showed simple steatosis whereas 25 patients had NASH. The number of HNP1-3 expressing neutrophils, CD68-positive macrophages/Kupffer cells and activated stellate cells did not differ between these two groups. In contrast, the number of MPO-expressing cells was much higher in the NASH group (13.0 vs 38.8 cells/area). A significant proportion of the inflammatory cells surrounded lipid laden hepatocytes, resembling the 'crown-like structures' frequently found in obese adipose tissue. Both IL-8 (r s =0.350) and CXCL1 (r s =0.401) expression correlated with HNP1-3 positive cell number, but not with the number of MPO expressing cells. Analysis of macrophage M1 and M2 phenotype markers indicated that both pro-and antiinflammatory macrophages are present in NASH. Taken together, our data show that the presence of MPO expressing macrophages/ Kupffer cells is characteristic of the inflammatory lesion in NASH and indicate that there are important similarities between inflammatory processes in the obese liver and obese adipose tissue.

Moreover, to assess the significance of the magnitude of the weight loss and evaluate potential effects of the lipase inhibitor, orlistat, on these parameters. Design: 68 abdominally obese subjects completed eight-weeks of very low-energy diet (VLED~800 kcal/day) followed by three years of randomized treatment with either orlistat or placebo together with life style intervention. Serum levels of these risk factos were measured by flowmetric xMAP technology. Results: Changes in the levels of IL-18, MMP-9, hs-CRP, and adiponectin were similar in the orlistat and the placebo group during this study. Thus, the two groups were combined for further analysis. A weight loss of 8.4 \u00b1 8.8 kg from baseline to three years was associated with significant decreases in IL-18, MMP-9, hs-CRP (p<0.001) and an increase in adiponectin (P< 0.001). MMP-9 was, however, significantly increased after 8 weeks of VLED-induced weight loss (p<0.05).The long term changes in IL-18 were significantly associated with changes in BMI independent of changes in blood pressure and lipids. Levels and changes of these risk factors were significantly associated with each other. Conclusion: Diet induced long term weight loss decreased IL-18, MMP-9, hs-CRP and increased adiponectin. The decrease in IL-18 was associated with changes in BMI independent of changes in blood pressure and lipids, indicating that even a minor weight reduction ( >7%) maintained for up to 3 years has beneficial effects on non-traditional cardiovascular risk markers. Orlistat treatment had no independent effects on these inflammatory markers in the present study.",

Methods and Results: Waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and liver tests (AST, ALT, ALP and GGT) were assessed in overweighed and obese women (n=447). According to the NCEP-ATP III criteria 25.3% of the subjects was diagnosed as having the ms. In 51.3% of the subjects with the MS, one or more of the liver tests were above the upper limit of normal. Comparing subjects with and without the ms, we found significant differences for ALT (37\u00b122 U/l vs 33\u00b132 U/l, p=0.007), ALP (78\u00b119 U/l vs 75\u00b126 U/l, p=0.026) and GGT (34\u00b122 U/l vs 29\u00b132 U/l, p<0.001). For AST we observed a trend (25\u00b111 U/l vs 24\u00b114 U/l, p=0.070). Differences in ALT and GGT remained significant even after adjusting for BMI, ferritin and CRP. When subjects were classified according to the number of components of the MS, levels of ALT, GGT, ferritin and CRP significantly increased with the number of components present (p<0.05). Stepwise multiple regression analysis, with the components of the MS as independent variables and liver tests as dependent variables, showed mainly fasting glucose and triglycerides as the most important determinants of liver markers. Conclusions: Increasing features of the MS are associated with increased prevalence of disturbed liver tests and inflammation suggesting a causal link between the MS and NAFLD.

ALMS is characterized by severe impairments of multiple organ systems, resulting in blindness, hearing impairment, interstitial fibrosis, childhood-onset obesity, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Aim: we aimed to study some pathophysiological aspects of ALMS which recapitulates most of the features of the metabolic syndrome. Research design and methods: we investigated in primary fibroblast cultures from ALMS patients: 1) the insulin sensitivity assayed by insulin-dependent 2-3 H-Deoxy-D-Glucose uptake; 2) the gene expression profile by cDNA microarray analysis and real-time PCR; 3) their ability to differentiate into adipocytes under adipogenic conditions. Lipid accumulation was assessed by oil red O staining and morphological changes by microscopy. Moreover we studied the changes in Alms1 gene expression during adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. Results and conclusions: we did not observe any variation in insulin sensitivity between ALMS and control fibroblasts. Comparative analysis between the differential gene expression profiles of ALMS and control showed a significant increase in INSR without any difference in GLUT4. 11 genes coding for different types of collagen resulted up-regulated suggesting an involvement of ALMS1 in the multi-organ fibrosis. The adipogenic potential of ALMS fibroblasts was clearly increased compared with controls. A downregulation of Alms1 was observed during the 3T3-L1 differentiation, suggesting that Alms1 could have an influence in the early phase of adipogenesis thus partially explaining the propensity of ALMS patients to obesity.",

Recently small, dense low-density lipoprotein (sd-LDL B ) has been highlighted as a risk factor for CHD. Visceral fat exhibits more enhanced lipolytic activity and inflammatory phenotypes than other fat depots. However, it is unclear whether the vicious phenotypes are associated with immune dysfunction in obesity. Because adipose tissue is anatomically associated with lymph nodes, the secondary lymphoid organ, we hypothesized that visceral fat accumulation influences the cellularity of lymphoid tissue embedded in visceral fat. Mesenteric and inguinal lymph nodes were isolated from obese mice fed a high-fat diet and control mice fed a regular diet. T cell population, activation state, and the extent of apoptosis were determined by flow cytometric anlaysis or TUNEL assay. The weight of mesenteric lymph nodes of and the number of lymphoid total cells in the obese mice significantly decreased compared with those in the control mice, however, no change was observed in the weight of inguinal lymph nodes. The numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes of obese mice significantly decreased compared with those of the control. Enhanced T cell activation and apoptosis were observed in the mesenteric lymph node cells of the obese mice. The treatment of lymph node cells with free fatty acids and oxidative stress, which are obesity-related factors, resulted in lymph node T cell activation and apoptosis. These results suggest that visceral fat accumulation can cause the atrophy of mesenteric lymph nodes by enhancing activation-induced T cell apoptosis. Visceral fat accumulation may be crucial for obesity-related immune dysfunction. 2 ) underwent a whole-body DXA-scan (manual segmentation: arms, legs, abdomen). In 149 subjects visceral fat (vcFM MRI ) was analyzed by MRI at L4-L5 and abdominal fat by DXA-segmentation. CR (mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), HDL-C, LDL-C, glucose-and insulin-levels (calculation of insulin-resistance by HOMA-Index)) were assessed. Results: Women had significantly higher proportions of leg-FM DXA /total-FM DXA (f:41%, m:32%), whereas men showed significantly higher proportions of abdomen-FM DXA /total-FM DXA (m:46%, f:40). Partial correlations adjusted for age, sex and %FM DXA revealed significant, positive relationships (negative association for HDL-C) between abdomen-FM DXA /total-FM DXA and CR (r=-0.26(HDL-C), r=0.20(LDL-C), r=0.21(MAP), r=0.24(insulin), r=0.24(HOMA), p<0.01), but inverse associations between leg-FM DXA /total-FM DXA and CR (r=0.26(HDL-C), r=-0.22(LDL-C), r=-0.22(insulin), r=-0.23(HOMA), r=-0.18(MAP), p<0.01). In a partial correlation adjusted for abdomen-FM DXA /total-FM DXA the inverse associations between leg-FM DXA /total-FM DXA and CR remained significant. There were significant and positive associations between different methods to assess abdominal or visceral fat (abdomen-FM DXA vs. WC (f:r=0.79, m:r=0.81), WC vs. vcFM MRI (f:r=0.73, m:r=0.77) and abdomen-FM DXA vs. vcFM MRI (f:r=0.61, m:r=0.76)). Conclusions: CR increased with higher ratios of abdomen-FM DXA /total-FM DXA , whereas greater proportions of leg-FM DXA /total-FM DXA seem to be protective.

Fat-mass (FM), lean body mass (LBM) and muscle-mass (MM) were measured by Dual-Energy-X-Ray-Absorptiometry (DXA). REEm was measured by indirect calorimetry, adjusted for LBM (REEadj) and compared to REEc calculated from organ-and tissue-masses times specific metabolic rates according to Elia, 1992 . To explain REE-variance thyroid hormones (T3, T4, TSH) and fasting glucose-and insulin-levels (insulin-resistance by HOMA-Index) were assessed. Results: REEm and REEadj were significantly higher in men when compared with women (REEm:7.47\u00b10.90 vs. 5.95\u00b10.75MJ/d, REEadj:7.98\u00b10.98 vs. 5.45\u00b10.79MJ/d; p<0.01).

Adjusting REE for LBM significant differences between nw and ob subjects remained (m:-0.45MJ/d, f:-0.71MJ/d) (p<0.01).

In a multiple regression analysis LBM explained 78% of REEm-variance. OMMRI, MMDXA, FMDXA and vcFMMRI explained 86% of REEm-variance. HOMA-Index and plasma thyroid hormone-levels did not further explain the REEm-variance. Conclusion: The contribution of high metabolic rate organ-masses explains sex-differences as well as obesity induced differences in REE adjusted for LBM. Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L. Leguminosae) is one of the oldest medicinal plants, much cultivated in India and Mediterranean countries. It is one of the spices which are contained in curry powder. Fenugreek has various medical effects such as nourishing, lactation stimulant, treatment of indigestion and anti-inflammatory. Recently, hypoglycemic effect of fenugreek on type1 and type2 diabetes was reported. However, its mechanism is still uncertain. And it is difficult to apply fenugreek to foodstuff, because fenugreek has a strong bitter taste. Furostanol saponins contained in fenugreek are major cause for bitterness. Enzymatic cleavage at the O-linked sugar chain of fenugreek saponins yielded fenugreek with reduced bitterness (FRB). To evaluate the effect of FRB on diabetes and investigate its mechanism, we examined the effects of FRB on the metabolism of glucose and lipid in obese diabetic KK-Ay mice.",

We here demonstrate that capsaicin, a naturally occurring phytochemical, can suppress obesity-induced inflammation by modulating adipokine release from and macrophage behavior in obese mice adipose tissues. Capsaicin inhibited the expressions of IL-6 and MCP-1 mRNAs and protein release from the adipose tissues and adipocytes of obese mice, whereas it enhanced the expression of the adiponectin gene and protein. The action of capsaicin is associated with NF-\u03baB inactivation and/or PPAR\u03b3 activation. Moreover, capsaicin suppressed not only macrophage migration induced by the adipose tissue-conditioned medium, but also macrophage activation to release proinflammatory mediators. In vivo experiment, dietary supplement of capsaicin significantly decreased the expression levels of MCP-1 and IL-6, and macrophage accumulation and increased the expression of adiponectin in adipose tissue of the obese mice compared with those of the control. Moreover, capsaicin improved the impairment of glucose tolerance in the obese mice. Capsaicin may be a useful phytochemical for attenuating obesity-induced inflammation and obesity-related complications such as insulin resistance. Visceral adipose tissue is recognized as an independent risk factor for metabolic syndrome in adults. Estimation of abdominal obesity by anthropometry is frequently imprecise, particularly in children. The study aim was to estimate whether epicardial fat (EF) measured by transthoracic echography correlates with waist circumference and metabolic syndrome components in overweight children. In 52 overweight children (23M, 29F) in the mean age 11.6 \u00b12.87 years and in 61 normal weight healthy children (24M, 37F) in the mean age 13.4\u00b12.13 years, measurements of EF thickness on the right ventricle was obtained by two-dimensional M-mode echocardiogram . In all children weight status was assessed according to IOTF criteria and their waist circumference was measured. Fasting total cholesterol (TCh), HDLcholesterol (HDL), triglycerides (TG) and insulin (Ins) were measured, LDLcholesterol (LDL) was calculated and systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DPS) were measured in overweight children. In overweight children EF thickness was 5.52 mm (4.97-6.07 95%CI) vs 2.53 mm (2.32-2.74 (95% CI) in non-overweight, the difference being statistically significant (p<0.0001). EF significantly correlated with weight, BMI, BMI z-score and waist circumference (p<0.0001). There was no correlation between EF and TCh, HDL, LDL, TG, Ins, SBP and DPS, in model adjusting for of weight, age and sex. It is concluded that although epicardial fat in overweight children shows a strong correlation with BMI and waist circumference it does not seem to be independent predictor of metabolic syndrome in this age group.",

Methods and Results: Fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag) plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and high-sensitive creactive protein (hs-CRP) were determined in a group of 292 non-diabetic overweight and obese women. A CT-scan (L4-L5) was performed to estimate the amount of visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Fibrinogen levels were significantly higher in subjects with high levels of hs-CRP (median value; p<0.001), while differences in vWF:Ag (p=0.058) and PAI-1 activity levels (p=0.088) were borderline significant. After correction for hs-CRP, VAT was not related to fibrinogen levels (r=0.10; p>0.05), while there was a significant relationship with vWF:Ag (r=0.18; p<0.01) and PAI-1 activity levels (r=0.34; p<0.001). In multiple regression analysis, hs-CRP was the only independent determinant of fibrinogen (r\u00b2=0.19; p<0.001), but did not determine levels of vWF:Ag or PAI-1. Conclusion: In this group of pre-and postmenopausal women, the relationship between VAT and fibrinogen probably is just a marker of the relationship of both factors with inflammation, while the relationship between PAI-1 and VAT is independent of inflammation. Levels of vWF:Ag are only modestly related to inflammation and VAT. This study aimed to determine the requirements for improving metabolic syndrome through an explorative approach. A total of 323 Japanese women, 24-67 years of age, were recruited as subjects, and they met the following criteria: (i) a body mass index (BMI) of 25-40 kg/m 2 , and (ii) at least 1 metabolic syndrome component (abdominal obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, or hyperglycaemia, conforming to the Japanese criteria). The subjects participated in a 3-month low-calorie-diet-induced weight-loss program. We examined the requirements for improving the metabolic syndrome by using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. Of the 323 subjects, 309 who completed the weight-loss program were included in the analyses. The average percentage weight loss was 11.9% \u00b1 4.2%. The CART analyses showed that the percentage change in weight (cutoff: -8%) was the best requirement for improvement in at least 1 metabolic syndrome component (79.6% in the high-weight loss group vs. 44.1% in the low-weight loss group). In the former group, the baseline BMI (cutoff: 25.9 kg/m 2 ) was the best requirement for further partition. Similarly, classification trees were generated to determine the requirements for improving abdominal obesity (best requirement: -13% change in weight), hypertension (best requirement: baseline age of 42 years), and hyperglycaemia (best requirement: -13% change in weight); however, no classification trees were generated to determine the requirements for improving metabolic syndrome prevalence and dyslipidaemia. These results suggest that moderate weight loss of 8-13% contributes to improvements in metabolic syndrome components in overweight Japanese women.",

Furthermore, expression of AKR1C3 is known to be associated with adiposity, one of the components of the metabolic syndrome. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate AKR1C3 expression in relation to the metabolic syndrome. We studied the expression of AKR1C3 in adipose tissue samples from obese subjects with or without metabolic complications, during very low calorie diet-induced weight loss as well as in isolated human adipocytes of different sizes using microarray analysis and real-time PCR. Adipose tissue AKR1C3 expression levels were lower in obese subjects with the metabolic syndrome compared with healthy obese subjects (p<0.05). Adipose tissue mRNA levels of AKR1C3 were reduced during and after diet-induced weight-loss (p<0.001 at all time-points) compared to baseline levels. In addition, gene expression of AKR1C3 correlated to adipose tissue mRNA and serum leptin levels at baseline (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). AKR1C3 was shown to have its main site of expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue compared to 64 other human tissues. Furthermore, large adipocytes display higher expression of AKR1C3 than small adipocytes (1.5-fold, p<0.01). In conclusion, adipose tissue and adipocyte AKR1C3 expression is altered in metabolic disease.

Seventy four boys (age 13.4\u00b10.4yrs) and 96 girls (age 13.5\u00b10.5yrs) were selected from volunteers enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. MRI was used to assess SAAT and IAAT and DXA measures utilised paediatric software. Height, weight, and waist circumference were measured and stage of sexual maturation was available via self report. DXA-derived trunk fat was the best predictor for IAAT and explained 78.1% and 67.3% of the variance of IAAT in boys and girls, respectively. DXA tended to underestimate IAAT in children with more MRI determined IAAT and overestimate IAAT in children with less MRI determined IAAT. DXA trunk fat was the best predictor for SAAT in boys (92.2% variance explained) and DXA total body fat was the best predictor for SAAT in girls (79.9% variance explained). In the absence of DXA, BMI could be a good surrogate measure for estimation of SAAT (89.4% variance explained in boys; 74.5% in girls). DXA regional trunk fat mass is a relatively good proxy measure of IAAT at the group level but not at the individual level. The DXA prediction equations for SAAT should perform reasonably well at both individual and group levels using regional trunk fat in boys and total body fat in girls.",

The present study was undertaken to further characterize the role(s) and phenotype(s) of these macrophages (i) in human subcutaneous AT of lean to overweight patients and (ii) in subcutaneous and visceral ATs of obese patients. FACS analysis was performed on the SVF using antibodies directed against macrophage cluster of differentiation (CD) markers. AT macrophages (ATMs) were isolated using an immunoselection/depletion approach and real-time RT-PCR analysis was performed. In subcutaneous AT of lean to overweight individuals, ATMs were mainly composed by CD45+/CD14+/CD206+/CD16-cells and showed a mixed expression of pro-(TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-23, MCP-1, IL-8, COX-2) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, AMAC-1, COX-1) factors. Fat mass enlargement was associated with a decreased expression of IL-8 and COX-2 and an increased expression of LYVE-1, a remodeling marker. Interestingly, ATMs exerted a significant pro-angiogenic effect on the AT-derived endothelial and progenitor cells. Comparison of ATMs from obese patient subcutaneous and visceral ATs showed no marked differences in the amount of macrophage accumulated in both locations. However, visceral ATMs exhibited higher transcript levels for COX-1, IL-6 and LYVE-1. These data showed that ATMs exhibit a specific phenotype, characterized by a mixed expression of pro-inflammatory and remodeling factors, together with a proangiogenic activity. Extension of the fat mass is associated with modulation of the ATMs number and phenotype. Finally, AT location modulates the phenotype of ATMs and not their number.

Response to glucocorticoids has in part been attributed to variation in the glucocorticoid receptors (GR) gene. The aim of study was to assess the genotype-phenotype interaction of BclI and N363S polymorphism of GR gene in women with abdominal obesity (AO) in comparison with normalweight, healthy women (NW). The study was performed on 153 AO aged 19-46 yrs and 84 age-matched NW. We evaluated: body mass index (BMI), parameters of body composition, lipid profiles, HOMA and QICKI, cortisol, GH, IGF-1, acylated ghrelin, leptin and adiponectin serum concentration. BclI and N363S CR polymorphism was assessed by PCR-RSLP. Genotype distributions, and G and A allele frequency did not differ between study groups. Amongst AO with CC, GC and GG genotypes of BclI we found significant differences in adiponectin serum concentration and adiponectin/BF ratio. Amongst AO women with AA, AG and GG genotypes (N363S) we found differences in QICKI, serum insulin and leptin concentrations. AO women with wild type (for BclI and N363S) showed lower serum leptin levels In conclusion, our results suggest that G allele donors of BclI and N363S GR polymorphism gene are less prone to control the metabolic disturbances. Obesity and other risk factors included in the definition for the metabolic syndrome are associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, including slightly raised serum levels of the acute phase protein Serum Amyloid A (SAA). Serum levels of SAA are strongly linked to coronary artery disease (CAD) and we therefore hypothesized that genetic variants of SAA1 and the SAA receptor SelenoproteinS (SELS) are of importance in development of CAD. Two amino acid-substituting SNPs in the SAA1 gene were genotyped using RFLP analysis in a study comprising of 484 well-characterized patients with CAD and 621 healthy controls. In addition, three SNPs in SELS were genotyped in 650 CAD patients and 648 controls using TaqMan genotyping assays. Preliminary data showed that subjects with SAA1 3010TT are more likely to develop CAD (OR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.36-3.47) and this link was even stronger in men (OR = 2.28, 95% CI 1.36-3.83). A weaker link was found to genotype 2995CC (OR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.04-2.22). The SAA1 C2995T SNP was associated with BMI and WHR in women (nominal p-value < 0.05 and < 0.05, respectively). Two of the SELS genotype variants were associated with triglyceride and HDL levels (rs4965814 SNP: nominal pvalue 0.016 and 0.006, respectively; G-105A SNP: nominal p-value 0.010 and 0.005, respectively). In conclusion, our results indicate that SAA1 genotypes are associated with CAD and that SAA1 and SELS are involved in the regulation of CAD risk factors.

Effective weight control can lead to improvement or even resolution of their diabetes in these subjects. Laparoscopic methods currently used in bariatric surgery represent a suitable option for sustained weight loss in severely obese-diabetic subjects. Methods: In this prospective review, we analysed the change in the diabetic status in 74 obese-diabetic subjects undergoing three different bariatric procedures in a single institution over 12 months. Included subjects had diabetes for at least 6 months. Evidence of stable treatment was required with oral hypoglycaemic agents or insulin for at least 12 months. They were matched with 74 obese non diabetic subjects on the same conditions. Results: Six months after bariatric procedure the 74 diabetes subjects had a mean excess weight loss (EWL) of 37.8%. EWL dropped by 50.3% in 57 (77.0%) subjects after 12 months. In 47 (63.5%) subjects diabetes resolved completely and 25 subjects (33.8%) had significantly improved their diabetes mellitus (compared with HbA1c) after 12 months. The control group exhibited an average EWL of 41.6% at 6 months. EWL reached 53.4% in 57 control subjects after 12 months. Long-term total mortality after gastric bypass surgery was significantly reduced, particularly deaths from diabetes mellitus. Conclusion: Laparoscopic bariatric surgery resulted in significant and sustained weight loss leading to significant improvement of diabetes. This technique may facilitate treatment of diabetes in subjects refractory to oral medication or on insulin. Key words: bariatric surgery, excess weight loss, diabetes mellitus S142 International Journal of Obesity Inflammation plays a causal role in several morbidities related to obesity, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The complement system is an important component of the innate immune system and could play a role in the pathophysiology of NASH in obesity. Therefore we studied the activation of the complement system in the livers of severely obese patients. Liver tissue sections of 38 severely obese patients were immunohistochemically stained for the presence and distribution of activated C3 (the central component of the complement system) and for mannose binding lectin (MBL), the initiating factor of the lectin pathway. Deposition of activated C3 was detected in 66% of the patients. Staining patterns varied between patients and between liver regions. Intense staining was frequently observed around lipid laden hepatocytes. A similar staining pattern was observed for MBL. Presence of MBL was detected in 79% of the patients. Colocalization of MBL with C3a was seen in most C3a-positive livers. Staining of complement factors of the classical pathway and the alternative pathway is in progress.",

            "text": "Overconsumption of soft drinks has been linked with the obesity epidemic and is recognized as a major public health concern. The present study was aimed at determining the contribution of caffeine to the cardiovascular load imposed by soft drinks. In a randomized crossover study, 12 (8 male) healthy volunteers (aged 20-30 years) ingested drinks containing sucrose with either a caffeine or a placebo tablet. The volume (500ml), sucrose concentration (11%) and caffeine content (50mg) were chosen to simulate a standard soft drink. For 30 min before and 2 hours after each drink, we recorded arterial blood pressure (finger plethysmography), heart rate (ECG) and cardiac output (impedance cardiography). Total peripheral resistance (TPR) was calculated as mean blood pressure divided by cardiac output. Ingesting sucrose+placebo significantly increased heart rate and cardiac output but had no overall effect on blood pressure due to a decrease in TPR. In contrast, ingesting sucrose+caffeine resulted in a gradual increase in mean blood pressure that, after 2 hours, was 7.3\u00b11.4 mmHg above the basal value. The increases in heart rate and cardiac output after ingesting sucrose+caffeine were not significantly different from those in response to the sucrose+placebo drink. However, the average drop in TPR was considerably less (-0.40\u00b10.46 mmHg/l min -1 ) after sucrose+caffeine compared with sucrose+placebo (-1.25\u00b10.44 mmHg/l min -1 ). These data suggest that addition of caffeine to a soft drink, even in small amounts, causes a substantial increase in blood pressure. This effect seems to be due to a caffeine-mediated attenuation of the vasodilatory response to sugar ingestion.

Materials and methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of 1030 subjects (452 men and 578 women) from the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study. Triglyceride, cholesterol, FBS, HDL-C levels and its subfractions, apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein A1 were determined and body mass index and blood pressure were measured. A segment of the mentioned gene was amplified by PCR and the polymorphism reveled by RFLP using HhaI restriction enzyme. Results: Allele frequencies obtained for APOE*2, APOE*3, and APOE*4 were 5.77%, 85.92%, and 8.3%, respectively. The presence of the 2 allele was significantly associated with increased HDL-C levels (E2= 50 \u00b1 14 mg/dl vs. E4 = 44\u00b110 mg/dl for P<0.001), HDL-2 levels (E2= 19 \u00b1 9 mg/dl vs. E4 = 15\u00b17 mg/dl for P<0.001) and HDL-3 levels (E2= 32 \u00b1 8 mg/dl vs. E4 = 28\u00b16 mg/dl for P=0.005). The relations were significant even after adjustment for age; sex but smoking and diabetes status decreased the effect of APO E2 in HDL-C and HDL subfractions. Conclusion: The observed genotype and allele frequencies were similar to those reported for other Caucasians samples. The finding showed that APOE2 increased the level of HDL-C and HDL subfractions. These findings highlight the important effect of variation in this gene on lipid levels. Key words: Apo B, Polymorphism, Frequency, Lipid",

Aim: The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of NAFLD in obese subjects and to characterize the relationship between NAFLD and insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors. Methods: The study was performed in 223 alcohol-and virus-negative obese men and women. Anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, lipid profile, ALT, AST, blood glucose and insulin, HOMA-IR, oral glucose tolerance test and liver ultrasonography were measured in each subject. The metabolic criteria were defined according to the IDF. Plasma adiponectin, leptin, TNF-, C-reactive protein (CRP) and PAI-1 were measured in subjects with NAFLD and metabolic syndrome (n = 60). Results: The prevalence of NAFLD was 78,5%, 71,4% of them had metabolic syndrome, 84%-insulin resistance, 56,7%-hyperinsulinemia, 47%-hypertriglyceridemia, 46%-decreased HDL-C, 61%-hypertension. The prevalence of increased ALT levels was 41,7%, AST -22,9%, AST, ALT-22, 9%. Triglycerides, insulin and HOMA were significantly higher in subjects with NAFLD (p<0,001). Increased ALT activity was significantly associated with fasting insulin, HOMA-IR and TNF-. (p< 0,05). Low adiponectin levels was observed in 44,4% patients, hyperleptinemia-96, 3%, increased CRP-22,2%, increased TNF--24%. All patients had high-level PAI-1. Waist circumference, BMI positively correlated with liver steatosis & negatively with adiponectin. Conclusion: The prevalence of NAFLD is high in obese subjects and strongly associated with cardiovascular risk factors.

RES (\u03bcg/mL) had the same downward trend but appeared not significant 0' vs. 120' changes: controls 9.83\u00b17.40 vs. 4.63\u00b10.93; overweight 11.14\u00b19.56 vs. 5.32\u00b10.61; moderately 11.96\u00b112.16 vs. 5.53\u00b12.03 and severely obese 14.33\u00b122.76 vs. 6.04\u00b14.19. RES values at 0' correlated to 120' in controls (r+0.884; p<0.004) and in obese children (r+0.699; p<0.036). ADQ:RES ratio was lowered in both obese subgroups at 0': 0.59\u00b10.44 (p<0.007) or 0.52\u00b10.43 (p<0.048) and at 120' 0.59\u00b10.43 (p<0.027) or 0.49\u00b10.34 (p<0.042) if compare to controls: 1.08\u00b10.69(0') and 1.68\u00b11.52(120'). There were found ADQ (from p<0.004 to p<0.03) and ADQ:RES (p<0.01) negative correlations at 0' and 120' to body mass, BMI and BMI-SDS. Conclusions: Hyperinsulinemia and/or hyperglycemia in course of OGTT are suspected to be responsible for abrupt fall down of adiponectin and its ratio to resistin in obese children. Investigations are supported from government sources (MNiSW N407 057 32/2522). The aim of this work was to characterize changes in vascular function of resistance vessels related to diet-induced obesity (DIO). Four-week old CB57BL/6J male mice were assigned either to a low-fat (LF) (10 kcal % from fat) or to a high-fat (HF) diet (45 kcal % from fat). After 40 weeks on dietary treatment, HF animals weighed 20% more than LF animals (p<0.05). Both leptin (13.6\u00b12.0 ng/ml vs 28.4\u00b16.1 ng/ml, p<0.05) and insulin plasma levels (2.1\u00b10.3 \u03bcg/l vs 5.8\u00b10.6 \u03bcg/l; p<0.001) were significantly increased in HF animals. In contrast, plasma adiponectin was reduced in this group (9918\u00b1359 ng/ml vs 7758\u00b1415 ng/ml; p<0.001). Reactivity of resistance vessels was characterized by perfusion of the isolated mesenteric bed (flow of 1.5 ml/min). Contractions to KCl (6 to 75 mM) as well as responses to noradrenaline (10 -7 to 10 -5 M) were significantly higher in HF animals. Relaxant response to acetylcholine (10 -9 -10 -4 M) was significantly impaired in HF animals (90.7\u00b14.1% vs 60.1\u00b11.7%, p<0.001). Endothelium-independent relaxations, elicited by sodium nitroprusside, as well as basal release of nitric oxide, determined by the contractile response to L-NAME (10 -4 M), were not modified by dietary treatment. However, superoxide anion production, determined by confocal microscopy, was significantly higher in the HF group. These data show that DIO induces alterations in metabolic parameters which might be related to endothelial dysfunction in resistance vessels. We tested the hypothesis that adipose tissue significantly contributes to increased levels of proatherogenic endothelial cell adhesion molecules (CAM) in obesity and explored the influence of very low calorie diet (VLCD) on this production. 25 obese females (OB) and 14 lean healthy females (C) underwent blood drawing and subcutaneous (s.c.) and visceral (visc.) adipose tissue sampling during gastric banding and elective cholecystectomy surgery, respectively. In VLCD substudy, 20 obese females underwent blood drawing and s.c. fat biopsy before and after 3 weeks of VLCD (550 kcal/day). Serum concentrations of insulin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin were measured using Lincoplex kits, CAM mRNA expression in fat was measured using RT PCR and protein CAM levels in fat were measured using Lincoplex kits and normalized to protein content. BMI, serum insulin levels, HOMA index, ICAM-1 and E-selectin concentrations of OB were significantly higher relative to C. Serum concentrations of VCAM-1 did not differ. Messenger RNA expression and protein levels of CAM in s.c. fat were not affected by obesity while in visc. fat ICAM and VCAM mRNA expression and its protein levels were significantly increased in OB relative to C. Three weeks of VLCD decreased circulating Eselectin levels while it did not change circulating ICAM and VCAM or its mRNA expression in s.c. fat. We conclude that obesity increases visceral but not subcutaneous adipose tissue production of CAM. This finding may partially explain the closer relationship of visceral fat accumulation in obesity to cardiovascular complications. Supported by MZO 000064165 and IGA 8302-5",

A segment of the mentioned gene with PCR was amplified and the polymorphism with RFLP (MspI) revealed. The MS is very common in obese children and adolescents, but is also represented in overweight subjects. These data suggest the importance of an early intervention to prevent overweight, obesity and their metabolic complications. Introduction. The RAS is linked to visceral adiposity and cardiometabolic complications. Differences in expression pattern between subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue (SAT; VAT) might have functional relevance. The aim of the study was to compare RAS expression in SAT and VAT using kidney as control tissue. The relation between clinical parameters and RAS expression was also studied. Methods. Samples of kidney cortex, medulla, and VAT were obtained from 38 patients undergoing nephrectomy (from 14 of these patients SAT was also sampled). Renin, (pro)renin receptor (PRR), angiotensinogen, ACE1, ACE2, AT1 receptor, AT2 receptor, and aldosterone synthase gene expression was evaluated by Real Time-PCR and normalized with GAPDH gene expression. Anthropometric and metabolic characteristics were evaluated before surgery.",

            "text": "Results. Kidney cortex is the main expression site for renin and ACE2. Angiotensinogen was largely expressed in VAT (about 7 folds higher than SAT; P=0.002), whereas ACE1 and AT1 were many folds more expressed in adipose tissue (both SAT and VAT) than in kidney. AT2 and PRR had low expression levels both in adipose and renal tissues, whereas, aldosterone synthase didn't result expressed in neither kidney or adipose tissue. VAT mRNA levels of AT1 was higher in normal-weight than in overweight patients (P=0.017). Discussion. The results suggest that VAT is an important source of angiotensinogen and angiotensin-II. Moreover, adipose tissue is a main target organ of angiotensin-II. It's possible also to hypothesize an AT1 \"downregulation\" due to increased of AngII production in VAT of obese patients. Results: 478 patients were analysed, of whom 70% were male. The mean BMI was 31.9 kg/m 2 and ranged from 15 to 64.7 kg/m 2 . 69.3% of patients had an AHI of 10 or above, of whom 78.8% were male. Mean BMI of those with an AHI of 10 or above was 32.9 kg/m 2 (95% CI 32.0 to 33.8), compared to 30.0 kg/m 2 (95% CI 28.6 to 31.4) for those with an AHI of below 10. Amongst the whole cohort, mean AHI was 26.6 (95% CI 24.4 -28.9), and mean ODI was 22.7 (95% CI 20.3 -25.3). Median ESS was 11 (n = 287; IQR 7 -15). BMI positively correlated with AHI, ODI and ESS; Kendal's tau-b = 0.277, 0.361 and 0.086 respectively, all P < 0.05. Discussion: The majority of patients referred for sleep study had obstructive sleep apnoea. ODI correlated better with BMI than AHI, suggesting that body weight may have a more significant pathological contribution to propensity to desaturate, than to the AHI. Many appetite hormones have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome. The purpose of this study was to investigate the postprandial response of peptide YY 3-36 (PYY 3-36 ) and acylated ghrelin to varied macronutrient composition in adult males with and without the metabolic syndrome. The International Diabetes Federation criteria of metabolic syndrome were used. Subjects received, on separate occasions, a high carbohydrate (HC), a high protein (HP) and a high fat (HF) meal. PYY 3-36 levels increased, while acylated ghrelin values decreased, following the three meals, in subjects with and without the metabolic syndrome. Even though the HC meal induced a higher acute PYY 3-36 peak, both HC and HF meals tended to maintain a continuously higher than baseline PYY 3-36 response throughout the postprandial period, in metabolic syndrome subjects. In control subjects, HF meal tended to induce an acutely, while HP meal a longer term, higher increase of PYY 3-36 above baseline. Postprandial acylated ghrelin decrease tended to be more pronounced following HC meal as compared to HP and HF meals, both in metabolic syndrome and control subjects. However, at 180min for MS subjects and at 180 and 240min for control ones, HP meal tended to maintain acylated ghrelin levels' change from baseline lower than that following HC and HF meals. In conclusion, findings suggest that modulating the release of endogenous appetite hormones, such as PYY 3-36 and acylated ghrelin, through alteration of dietary composition could provide a rational treatment for obesity and metabolic syndrome.

Bariatric surgery is nowadays the recommended treatment for subjects suffering from morbid obesity (or severe obesity with important comorbidities). There is no clear consensus regarding the link between psychological factors, eating behaviour and post-surgery body weight evolution. Objective: To observe the predictive value of psychological state and eating behaviour on body weight loss for obese patients 2 years after a gastric bypass. Method: 43 female patients (BMI: 44.7 \u00b1 0.4 kg/m 2 ) who underwent gastric surgery have been psychologically evaluated with the help of questionnaires on depression (BDI-II), anxiety (HAD) and eating behaviour (EDI-II) before the intervention, and at 1 and 2 years. Results: Excess weight loss at 2 years was 32.1 \u00b1 1.1 and body weight remained stable between the first year (81.3 kg \u00b1 1.7) and the second year (79.8 kg \u00b1 1.7). Depression (p<.01), anxiety (p<.05) and eating behaviour disorder (p<.01) improved between 0 and 2 years. There is no correlation between basic psychological factors in basal state and body weight loss at 1 and 2 years after surgery. However, excess body weight loss at 2 years correlate with psychological factors (depression r=-.30, p<.01 ; anxiety r=-.46, p<.01).",

However, these factors improve after weight loss, and maintained body weight is directly linked with the psychological state at 2 years after weight loss. Background: Dietary protein seems to play an important role in body weight regulation. Objective: To compare the effects of high or normal casein-, soy-, or whey with or without glycomacropeptide(GMP)-protein breakfasts on amino acid, satiety, and 'satiety' hormone respones. Design: Twenty-five healthy subjects (mean+SEM BMI:23.9+0.3 kg/m 2 ;age:22+1 years) received a subject-specific standardized breakfast (20% of daily energy requirements): a custard with either casein, soy, or whey+/-GMP as protein type with either 10/55/35(normal) or 25/55/20(high)En% protein/carbohydrate/fat in a randomized, singleblind design. Appetite profile (Visual Analogue Scale,VAS), plasma glucose, insulin, GLP-1, ghrelin, and amino acid(AA) concentrations were determined for four hours. Results: At 10En%, whey+/-GMP were more satiating than casein or soy (p<0.05), coinciding with higher leucine and lysine responses (p<0.05). This was not underscored by concentrations of glucose, insulin, GLP-1, or ghrelin since differences were not significant. At 25En% however, there were no differences in satiety. Whey+/-GMP triggered the strongest responses with respect to changes in concentrations of GLP-1 (p<0.05) and ghrelin (p<0.05) compared with soy or casein; and insulin (p<0.001) compared with casein. Conclusion: A difference in satiety between different proteins appeared at the normal concentration of protein, namely at 10En% the whey-protein breakfasts were more satiating than the casein-or soy-protein breakfasts, coincided with higher leucine and lysine concentrations but unrelated to changes in hormone concentrations. A difference in changes in hormone concentrations between different proteins appeared at the concentration of protein of 25En%; the whey-protein breakfasts triggered stronger responses than the casein-or soy-protein breakfasts. Aims: Obesity and increases in body weight in adults are considered to be among the most important risk factors for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Low birthweight is also associated with increased rate of T2D. We aimed to examine the association between body shape history from childhood to adulthood and the risk of developing T2D during middle adulthood.",

At baseline, subjects reported their current weight, height and body silhouette, and their body silhouette at 8 years, puberty, 20-25 years and 35-40 years. Birthweight was recorded in the most recent questionnaire. Cases of T2D were ascertained though both self-report and a drug reimbursement database. We evaluated the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) in obese adolescents (age > 10 year) consulting for overweight at our hospital and looked for associated clinical and biochemical risk factors for atherosclerosis. 106 obese (BMI SD > 2) adolescents, aged between 10 and 16.8 years, were retrieved. Beside standard blood analysis for MS screening, also insulin, LDL cholesterol, fibrinogen, homocysteine and uric acid concentrations were measured in fasting condition. Standardized anthropometry and blood pressure measurements were performed. MS, as defined by the recent IDF criteria for children, was found in 52 (49%) subjects. In all subjects waist circumference was above the 90 th percentile. Hypertension was present in 35, low HDL cholesterol in 23, hypertriglyceridemia in 19 and abnormal fasting glucose in 3 patients. No significant differences in gender, age, birth weight, gestational diabetes, paternal obesity and acanthosis nigricans were found between subjects with and without MS. Maternal BMI (30.0 \u00b1 5.5 vs 27.6 \u00b1 4.8; p=0.035), fasting insulin (15.2 \u00b1 9.3 vs 11.3 \u00b1 9.8; p=0.035) and uric acid (5.4 \u00b1 1.3 vs 4.8 \u00b1 1.2; p=0.021), was higher in the MS subjects compared to the non MS group. Fibrinogen concentration, LDL cholesterol and homocysteine were comparable between both groups. In conclusion, half of obese Belgian adolescents have MS by the recent IDF criteria. MS was associated with insulin resistance, but not with a prothrombotic state in this age group. Maternal, but not paternal obesity appears to be a risk factor for MS in obese adolescents.",

Since obesity if very common amongst South African women, it is likely that obesity drives the hypertension prevalence. The aims were to determine whether black African women have higher blood pressures (BP) than Caucasian women, and if obesity is related to their cardiovascular risk. Apparently healthy African (N=102) and Caucasian (N=115) women, matched for age and body mass index, were included. Age-adjusted correlations between obesity (representing total body fat, abdominal obesity and peripheral fat) and cardiovascular risk markers (hemodynamic variables, lipids, inflammatory markers, clotting factors, adipokines) were compared between the ethnic groups. Comparisons between low and high BP groups were also made for each ethnic group. The results confirmed that African women had higher BP (p<0.01), with significantly increased vascular resistance. African women also showed unexpected and significantly weaker correlations between obesity measures and cardiovascular risk markers when compared to Caucasian women (specifically systolic BP, vascular resistance, cardiac output, HDLcholesterol, fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, leptin, resistin). Interestingly the latter five risk markers were also not significantly different between low and high BP African groups. But African women showed significant correlations of obesity with triglycerides, C-reactive protein and insulin resistance that were comparable to the Caucasian women. Obesity is associated with impaired postprandial triacylglycerolemia, an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. Very low-carbohydrate diets decrease postprandial triacylglycerol levels, presumably by suppressing triacylglycerol hepatic secretion. However, they are criticised for their high saturated fat content. In this study we examined the effects of 10% weight loss induced by a low-carbohydrate lowsaturated fat diet on postprandial triacylglycerolemia. Twelve obese but otherwise healthy, sedentary, men and women (age: 38.2 \u00b1 3.3 years, body mass index: 34.8 \u00b1 1.3 kg . m -2 ) performed two oral fat tolerance tests, before and after 10% weight loss. Dietary intervention consisted of low carbohydrate intake (60g/day for the first two weeks followed by a stepwise 10g increase the following weeks if weight loss was greater than 0.3 kg/week), restriction in saturated fat intake, and increased in protein, mono-and polyunsaturated fatty acids intake. Subjects lost 10.4 \u00b1 0.6% of their initial body mass after 15 \u00b1 2 weeks. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was 47% lower after intervention (P<0.01). Postprandial concentrations of plasma triacylglycerols and serum insulin were 41% and 50% lower, respectively, after dietary intervention (P<0.01), whereas postprandial glucose concentrations were not different. Delta HOMA-IR was correlated with changes in postprandial concentrations of plasma triacylglycerols (r=0.678, P=0.015). It is concluded that moderate restriction in carbohydrate and saturated fat intake comprises an alternative intervention to reduce body mass and attenuate postprandial triacylglycerolemia and insulinaemia possibly through increases in insulin sensitivity.",

Overall, SAD showed a slightly higher correlation with most cardiovascular risk factors, especially with insulin resistance (HOMA-IR 0,260, p<0,001), insulinemia ( 0,250, p<0,001), HDL-Cholesterol (0,158, p< 0.05), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p< 0, 01) than other anthropometric measures. A significant correlation was observed between SAD and calculated 10-year Framingham CHD risk. SAD showed a stronger correlation to 10-year Framingham CHD risk (+0,224) than waist circumference (+0,199) . When adjustments were made for age and BMI, the correlation became slightly stronger between SAD and HOMA-IR. The results suggest that SAD, as a simple, cheap and noninvasive anthropometric measurement, could be a clinically useful marker of risk factors and insulin resistance in patients with metabolic syndrome. When further comparing the measures of central obesity and the correlation with PWV by stratifying for gender, the correlation between PWV and SAD was significant in both genders (men; r=0.18; p=0.01, women; r=0.26; p=0.01). However, in a corresponding analysis between PWV and Waist, the correlation was significant only in men (men; r=0.23; p<0.01, women; r=0.16; p=0.10). Conclusions: BMI, Waist and Sagittal Abdominal Diameter were associated with arterial stiffness and LVM in patients with type 2 diabetes. When exploring the associations by gender, SAD appears to be superior to Waist in predicting arterial stiffness in female patients with type 2 diabetes.",

            "text": "Druet C, Ong K MRC Epidemiology Unit, Institute of Metabolic Science, Cambridge, UK Introduction: METRIC is an international collaboration of birth cohort studies that aims to identify the optimal infant predictors of later obesity. The current analysis aims to identify which marker of attained infant size (infant weight, BMI or length) best predicts later BMI and obesity risk. Patients and methods: We performed a meta-analysis of data from 4 cohorts (ALSPAC, HAGUENAU, SWEDES and NFBC), totalling 5648 adults (age 17 to 31 years) and 1042 children (age 6 to 8 years). Infant size was expressed as age and sex-adjusted SD scores (SDS) and analyses were adjusted for childhood or adult height. Results: In separate models, infant weight, BMI and length were all positively associated with adult BMI and accordingly each was predictive of adult obesity OR (95% CI) per +1 SDS of infant weight: 1.34 (1.22-1.48) , BMI: 1.29 (1.18-1.40) , and length: 1.11 (0.99-1.25 ). In multivariate models, risk of adult obesity was positively and independently associated with both infant BMI (1.31 [1.20-1.42] ) and infant length (1.13 [1.02-1.26] ). The results were consistent in each cohort, and similarly both infant BMI (p<0.0001) and infant length (p=0.003) contributed independently to childhood BMI. Conclusion: Both larger infant BMI and greater infant length are independent predictors of later BMI and adult obesity. Infant weight, being a composite of infant BMI and length, represents the best single infant size marker of later obesity. Data from 5 further cohorts will be included to assess the predictive abilities of specific thresholds of infant size. The endocannabinoid system has recently emerged as an important regulator of energy homeostasis, involved not only in the control of food intake but also in the regulation of energy metabolism at peripheral level. We have investigated the effect of rimonabant on hepatic mitochondrial function in rats fed a high fat diet. Sprague Dawley rats fed a high fat diet during 13 weeks were treated with rimonabant during the 3 last weeks and matched with pair-fed controls. Body weight and fat mass were decreased in rats treated with rimonabant compared to pair-fed controls. Moreover, adiponectin was increased with rimonabant. An increase of mitochondrial respiration was observed in rats treated with rimonabant. Especially an increase of mitochondrial respiration with palmitoyl CoA compared to respiration with palmitoyl-l-carnitine stating that the entry of fatty acids in mitochondria via the carnitine plamitoyl transferase 1 was increased in rats treated with rimonabant. Moreover rimonabant has caused a reduction in the enzymatic activity of the ATP synthase whereas the quantity of mitochondrial DNA and the activity of the citrate synthase were remained unchanged. That seems to indicate that oxidation of respiratory substrates was increased in order to compensate the reduction of ATP synthesis but without variation of mitochondrial density. The results obtained suggest that rimonabant has a beneficial effect on mitochondrial function by facilitating fatty acids oxidation, thereby reducing fatty liver and so takes part in the increase of insulin sensitivity observed under rimonabant treatment. Results: Mean BMI 5y 0.32SD, 10y 0.51SD. Fasting glucose rose progressively from 5-10y (4.3-4.8 mmol/l, p<0.001). %B was higher, and %S lower, in T3 than T1 throughout. An unexpected switch in direction of disposition occurred in all tertiles (graph). The switch occurred earlier (6-7y), and at lower sensitivity (221%), in T3 compared with T1 (7-8y, 331%). Conclusion: A loop constantly seeks maximum gain to optimise control of its output (glucose). The switch in disposition is a novel observation which demonstrates how the loop reverts to beta cell reserve once insulin sensitivity becomes constrained. BMI appears to be a crucial determinant of the stage at which the inflexion occurs. Disposition mapping may help us better understand the response of the loop to rising obesity in children. ",

After adjustment by centre, BMI was not significantly higher in the Post women. Paradoxically, adiponectin levels were significantly higher in Post women compared with pre women (10.6 \u03bcg*ml -1 \u00b1 4.2 vs. 9.7 \u00b1 3.6 \u03bcg*ml -1 , p<0.05). However after adjustment for center (F: 2.82, p<0.001), age (F=7.68, p<0.01), BMI (F: 0.38, p=0.53) and waist circumference (F=26.15, p<0.001), menopausal status was not associated with significant differences in adiponectin levels (F=1.68, p=0.19) . Conclusion: Menopausal status is associated with increased adiponectin levels. This finding might indicate an adaptive mechanism involved in the preservation of insulin sensitivity during menopausal transition. Introduction: As childhood obesity increases it also contributes to an increasing incidence of the metabolic syndrome (MS). The aim of the current study was to record the prevalence of these adverse health conditions among Greek preadolescents. Materials and methods: The \"Prediabetes, Obesity and Growth Epidemiological Study in Schoolchildren\" (PROGRESS) examined a sample of 370 primary schoolchildren (9-13 years old) with complete data on certain anthropometric (weight, height, waist circumference), biochemical (fasting plasma glucose and serum lipids levels) and clinical (blood pressure) indices. The IOTF references were used for the definition of overweight and obesity. MS was diagnosed by abdominal obesity and the presence of two or more other clinical features (ie, elevated triglycerides, low HDL-cholesterol, high blood pressure, or increased plasma glucose) based on the new International Diabetes Foundation definition. Results: The prevalence of overweight and obesity was 31.3% and 11.4%, respectively. Regarding the clinical features of the MS, abdominal adiposity was recorded for 8.9% of the total sample. Furthermore, 2.6% of children were diagnosed with elevated serum triglycerides, 17.4% with low HDL-cholesterol, 8.8% with hypertension and 15% with increased plasma glucose levels. The prevalence of the MS was 3% in the total study population and 21.2% in the obese subjects. Conclusion: The prevalence of overweight, obesity and MS reported by the present study are considerably high and comparable to those reported by similar recent studies conducted with children. Because the number of overweight children is increasing continuously, there is a vital need to develop appropriate screening and prevention strategies.

Funding: Research relating to this abstract was funded by Friesland Foods Hellas. It is becoming increasingly important in our society to understand the aetiology and to stop the epidemic of obesity and its' related disorders. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of several risk factors characterised by insulin resistance which can lead to type 2 diabetes. We studied here the impact of the inner quality of food products on metabolic syndrome. Method: 160 men and post-menopausal women aged 18 to 65 years with metabolic syndrome were randomly assigned to a standard diet or a diet containing products naturally rich in omega-3 with similar macronutrients content for 3 month. After the 3-month diet, subjects returned to a free diet but were asked to come back after 2 and 5 months to be measured. 14 subjects from the control group and 14 from the test group also had blood samples taken. Results: no statistical differences were found between the two groups during the 3 month intervention diet. During follow-up, the Body Mass Index (BMI) of the subjects who were in the control group increased significantly more than the BMI of the former test group (+0.58 kg/m\u00b2 \u00b10.90 vs. +0.12 \u00b11.09 respectively, p=0.04). Lipid profile also improved for the 14 subjects in the test group and deteriorated in for the 14 in the former control group. Conclusion: during the 3-month diet, the quantitative impact of the caloric restriction masked the difference between products. During the follow-up, the qualitative aspect predominated and showed that omega-3 fatty acids are potentially beneficial on medium term to help weight management.

Its metabolic background comparison to obese children with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) was the aim of study. Methods: 40 IFG/IGT and 308 NGT obese children with the same anthropometric measures (BMI-SDS 3.7\u00b11.6; age 12.3\u00b13.5) underwent IVGTT and OGTT with insulin, proinsulin and C-peptide estimations; HOMA-IR, WBISI were calculated too. Other investigations included: family health history, lipids, fibrinogen, aminotransferases, abdomen ultrasonography. Results: T2DM in family history was in 32.5% of patients with prediabetes and 20.3% of NGT (p<0.01). 42.5% of IFG/IGT and 22.2% of NGT (p<0.0001) had acanthosis nigricans. In OGTT, IFG/IGT vs. NGT patients had higher insulin: AUC 0-120min (p<0.03), 120-0min mean value (p<0.001) and at 120min (p<0.0001); C-peptide 120-0min mean value (p<0.04) and at 120' (p<0.009); proinsulin at 120' (p<0.01). HOMA-IR was higher (4.81\u00b13.76 vs.3.61\u00b12.8; p<0.03) and WBISI was lower (2.81\u00b11.57 vs. 4.4\u00b13.63; p<0.04) in prediabetic children. In IVGTT, patients with IFG/IGT revealed reduced response during the first 3'(171.5\u00b175.5mU/L) and 5'(249.6\u00b199.5mU/L) in comparison to NGT (292.1\u00b1151.2 and 431.9\u00b1216.5mU/L; p<0.04). NAFLD was more frequent (20% vs.12.9%; p<0.01) and fibrinogen (mg/dl) was higher (417.0\u00b188.6 vs. 363.9\u00b185.7) in prediabetic than NGT patients (p<0.03). Conclusions: Obese children with reduction of the first phase insulin release are close to T2DM, however, there are other advanced disorders caused by insulin resistance too. So, the results suggest to presume an insulin resistance as enough to early diagnosis of prediabetes. Investigations are supported from government sources (MNiSW N407 057 32/2522).",

Assuring Health for All in the Free State is a research project aimed at determining how living in rural areas influences the lifestyles of populations, predisposing them to chronic diseases. Methodology: This study forms part of a prospective and longitudinal epidemiological study. Adults aged 25 and 64 years from three rural areas in South Africa were included. Socio-demographic and anthropometric data was collected and medical examination and blood sampling was done. Results: 553 adults (male=163, female=390) were included. In the age groups 25-45 and 46-65 years respectively, 84.1% and 72.0% of males were normal or underweight (BMI < 25). In the younger and older age groups respectively, 66.9% and 64.8% of females were overweight or obese (BMI > 25). Elevated blood pressure (>140/90 mmHg) was measured in 31.2% males and 40.2% females (25-45 years) and 64.7% males and 62.3% females (46-65 years). In the younger group, 46.2% of males and 54.7% of females who reported receiving hypertension treatment, had elevated blood pressure measurements, while in the older group, these percentages were 74.6% and 66.3% for males and females respectively. Blood glucose levels >7.1 mmol/L were measured in 47.5% of patients with diabetes mellitus and in 2.6% of non-diabetics. Conclusion: Most of the females in this population were overweight or obese, while most men were normal or underweight. A large percentage of hypertensive and diabetic patients had elevated blood pressure and blood glucose levels respectively. Obesity is a pathology associated with other considerable health problems, including endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Objective: to assess the efficacy of orlistat and hormonal therapy in the treatment of the endometrial hyperplasia in obese women. Methods and subjects: we treated 61 obese women with hystologically confirmed endometrial hyperplasia. Group I -simple hyperplasia (32 patients) were treated with levonorgestrel intrauterine device, group IIcomplex hyperplasia with/without atypia (29 patients) were treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 150 -500 mg weekly during 6 month. From each group 15 patients additionally were receiving orlistat 360 mg per day. Results: treatment of endometrial hyperplasia was successful in both groups. In the first group the frequency of hyperplasia recurrence was 2%, in the second one -20%. Side effects of progestins such as increasing of weight and glucose intolerance (II group) were observed in group without orlistat. There were a weight loss and normal results of GTT and lipids after orlistat with progestin. Conclusions: Orlistat combined with progestin was confirmed to improve tolerability and decrease the adverse events in treating the obese women with endometrial hyperplasia.",

Considering that LGI products present by definition a better glycemic profile than high-glycemic index (HGI) ones, we investigated the influence of a medium-term diet enriched with either LGI or HGI products, on the management of the postprandial glycemic profile. In this 5-week randomized study, 38 overweight subjects (BMI 27.3 +/-1.5 kg/m 2 ), replaced their usual starchy foods with either LGI or HGI ones. The GI was significantly different between groups (p<0.0001) with no difference in carbohydrates or caloric content. On Day1 and Day36, glucose metabolism (glycemia, insulinemia, total and exogenous glucose rate of appearance (RaT and RaE), endogenous glucose production (PEG)) was assessed following either a HGI or a LGI 13 C-labeled breakfast. On Day1, the areas under the curve (AUC) of glycemia, RaT, RaE, PEG, and the glycemic peak were significantly lower after the LGI breakfast (p<0.05), but there was no difference in the insulinemic response. No significant diet*time interaction was found for any parameter after 5 weeks. In fact, on Day36, LGI breakfast kinetics were similar to Day1 whereas a trend to a decrease was observed for HGI parameters; as a result, only RaE was lower in the LGI group (p<0.05). The intake of a LGI breakfast improved the short term metabolic tolerance to a meal compared to a HGI breakfast. Interestingly, the LGI beneficial effect was steady but not enhanced by a 5-week LGI diet, whereas the HGI effect remained more variable. ",

Lipid profile was (mg/dl): cholesterol=204\u00b18, HDL=53\u00b13, LDL=119\u00b18, triglycerides(TG)=168\u00b127. Abdominal fat was determined as cardiovascular risk factor LAP [lipid overaccumulation=(waist-k)\u00d7TG; k=gender constant]. Basal insulin sensitivity was measured with QUICKI index and the peripheral one with OGIS. Results: LAP was 66\u00b18 cm\u00d7mM/L. T2DM and CNT adiponectin (7.4\u00b10.5, 7.8\u00b1 0.9 \u03bcg/ml), leptin (13\u00b13, 13.3 ng/ml) and QUICKI (0.39\u00b10.01, 0.39\u00b10.01) were not different (p>0.2); OGIS (317\u00b111, 406\u00b112.6 ml min -1 m -2 ) was lower in T2DM, p=0.0001. LAP inversely correlated with OGIS (R=-0.57, p=0.026) and QUICKI (R=-0.56, p=0.022) only in T2DM. Cytokines were normalized to BMI (adiponectin=0.25\u00b10.02; leptin=0.42\u00b10.08). Leptin inversely correlated with QUICKI (R=-0.45, p=0.009), adiponectin directly with OGIS (R=0.43, p=0.015), in all subjects. Conclusions: Lipid overaccumulation plays a major role in insulin sensitivity impairment.

Furthermore, antioxidant intake has been suggested to protect against oxidative damage and related complications. The objective of this study was to assess the potential association between the total antioxidant dietary capacity (TAC) and several early metabolic syndrome manifestations in healthy young adults. Methods: Anthropometric variables and blood pressure of 101 healthy participants (20.5\u00b12.6 y) included in this study were measured. Dietary intake was assessed by a validated food-frequency questionnaire (SUN), which was used to calculate the TAC and to adjust it by daily energy intake. Fasting blood samples were collected for measuring serum glucose concentrations. Subjects were categorized by the median of body mass index (BMI), whose ranges were: 17.4-21.2 kg/m 2 , 21.2-29.3 kg/m 2 . Results: TAC was inversely correlated with body weight (r=-0.433; p=0.001), BMI (r=-0.294; p=0.028), waist circumference (r=-0.324; p=0.015), serum glucose (r=-0.292; p=0.038) and systolic blood pressure (r=-0.355; p=0.007) in subjects with the highest BMI (percentile 50 and over), whereas HDL-cholesterol (r=0.247) and waist circumference (r=-0.233) showed only a statistical trend (p=0.084). No correlations were found with TAC in subjects with lower values of BMI. Conclusions: These data suggest that TAC, as a measure of antioxidant intake, may be also a potential marker of the risk to develop obesity and metabolic syndrome features in healthy subjects. Background: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is a marker of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), predicts type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) as well as coronary events independently of traditional risk factors and the features of the metabolic syndrome. The extent to which left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), another surrogate marker of cardio-vascular disease (CVD) is associated with ALT levels in morbidly obese (MO) individuals is still unknown.",

In the last evaluation only 3.2% were normal weight, 24.1% overweight (P85<BMI P95) and 72.7% obese (BMI P 95). All had normal glucose levels. Blood pressure 90 th percentile was found in 18,2% of the patients. Cholesterol and triglycerides values were above the 95 th percentile in 10,6% and 23,5% of the patients respectively. LDL-C was above the 95 th percentile in 4,5%, and HDL-C was below the 5 th percentile in 4,0% of the patients. There was a weak statistic association between BMI above the 95 th percentile and high blood pressure (OR: 8,619 IC 95%: 1,990-37,329; C: 0.242, p=0,001) . No association was found between BMI and high cholesterol or triglycerides. Conclusion: There was a statistical association, although weak, between obesity and high blood pressure. The risk of having high cholesterol or triglycerides was similar between overweight and obese children. Because cardiovascular risk was not exclusive of the obese condition according to our results, the importance of including overweight adolescents in multidisciplinary programs at an earlier stage becomes reinforced. The metabolic syndrom (MS) includes abdominal obesity among its mains underlying risk factors. The prevalence of overweight in the Chinese adult population is estimated at 23% (WHO classification of Body Mass Index = BMI). Among preventive solutions, dietary factors, including fiber supplementation, are to be considered among the modifiable risk factors, in particular against overweight and hypertension. A clinical placebo controlled trial investigated the impact of NUTRIOSE \u00ae FB, a soluble dietary fiber, on some MS characteristics. 120 overweight Chinese male volunteers were enrolled in two groups receiving in beverage either 18 g NUTRIOSE \u00ae FB, equivalent of 14 g dietary fiber (NG) or 17 g standard maltodextrin (PG) at the same time, twice daily, for 12 weeks. The endpoints examined included comparisons of body weight (BW), BMI, body fat (BF), waist circumference (WC) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) between the two groups at baseline and throughout the study. 17 volunteers of the NG and 15 of the PG were presenting MS at baseline. Noted decreases in BW (p<0.001), BMI (p<0.0001), BF (21.5% to 21.2%, p<0.005) and WC (N.S.) were noted from month to month throughout the study in the NG. Abdominal scans indicated a final significant reduction of abdominal wall fat thickness in NG compared to PG (p<0.033). There was no difference between groups for SBP. Among participants presenting MS initially, 47% from NG and only 14% from PG were no longer classified with MS after 12 weeks. Dietary intervention through NUTRIOSE\u00ae 06 supplementation significantly modified biological markers of metabolic syndrome. Many previous studies reported that central obesity is related to inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. It also has been reported that resistin can induce proinflammatory cytokines which could be result in endothelial dysfunction. The aim of this study is to asses how resistin plays its role in influencing the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-, IL-6, and the chemokin MCP-1 in nondiabetic central obesity individuals. We hope that the results of this study can help to make a strategy for earlier preventing of endothelial dysfunction, especially for obese individuals. This study was a crossectional with 73 men subjects. The results showed a significant correlation between resistin and TNF-(r = 0,274, p<0,005), and a significant correlation between TNF-and IL-6 (r = 0,430, p<0,001). We found that at high concentration of resistin, the concentration of TNF-, IL-6 and MCP-1 will be increased, then affect to the increase of VCAM-1 (p = 0,0030), We also found significant correlations between waist circumferences and inflammation (hsCRP, r = 0,296 p<0,005 , IL-6, r = 0,374 p<0,001 and HOMA IR, r = 0,331 p<0,001). Finally, the study showed the role of resistin in endothelial dysfunction occurs in a high concentration of resistin through induction of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-, IL-6, and chemokin MCP-1, where the inflammation process occurs in obesity started with a positive feedback loop mechanism between resistin and TNF-.",

Objective: to assess the influence of NAFLD degree in multidisciplinary obesity intervention. Methods: 75 adolescents aged 15-19 y, with BMI > P95, consisting of 49 patients without and 26 with NAFLD, diagnosed by ultrasonography were submitted to longterm multidisciplinary intervention (1 year) (nutrition, psychology, exercise and clinical support). Blood samples were collected to analyze glycemia, hepatic transaminases, lipid profile, ghrelin and adiponectin levels. Insulin resistance and insulin sensibility was measured by HOMA-IR and QUICK. Analyses of food intake were made by 3 days recordatory inquiry. Results: At baseline conditions, the NAFLD patients showed significant increases in body mass, BMI, visceral fat, HOMA-IR, QUICK, triglycerides, VLDL and in hepatic transaminases. Nineteen patients had a low grade of steatosis (grade 1 of the Brunt classification) and 7 patients had a high grade of steatosis (grade 2 or 3). After the intervention, the body mass, BMI, visceral fat, QUICK, ALT and AST, energy and macronutrients intake were reduced significantly in all patients. BMI, insulin, HOMA-IR, QUICK and ALT were significantly higher in patients with a high grade of steatosis. It was observed a positive correlation between NAFLD degree and visceral fat, insulin, HOMA-IR and hepatic transaminases levels. Conclusion: Important clinical parameters present more altered in obese patients with NAFLD, mainly according the NAFLD degree and it is essential to consider it in a long-term multidisciplinary obesity intervention.

            "text": "It is well known that although obesity and accompanying chronic diseases (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis) become evident in adulthood, they are founded early in childhood and even in infancy. Inflammation is proposed as a strong contributor to the initiation and/or development of all of these health conditions. On the other hand, in some studies higher rates of obesity and associated chronic diseases have been documented in the later stages of lives of formula-fed infants compared to breast-fed ones. It is thus speculated that infant formulae prompt susceptibility to obesity and so called chronic diseases through activation of inflammatory pathways early in the course of growth and development. Formula-fed infants might have a higher level of systemic inflammation compared to breast-fed infants. Although the difference between the levels of inflammation in these two groups might be too low to be detected with routine tests, it can trigger the destructive metabolic changes during the several months of the infant's contact with the formulae. In fact, the suggested higher level of inflammation in formula-fed infants has been proposed based on the infant-formula protein and omega-3 fatty acid contents. The proteins in infant-formulae are derived from non-human sources and are more probable than breast-milk proteins to induce immune responses in infant's body. Moreover, the initiated inflammatory pathways are less probable to be suppressed in formula-fed infants than in breast-fed infants. The reason is the lower level of anti-inflammatory prostaglandins in formula-fed infants due to the little omega-3 fatty-acids they receive from the formulae. Introduction: Obesity and co-existing hypertension are the commonest causes of atherosclerosis. Human mechanisms controlling energy balance are complicated. Peptides as the orexigenic NPY and anorexigenic a-MSH and their interaction in hypothalamus are believed that lead in increased sympathetic nervous activity, possibly responsible for HPT. Aim of the study: NPY and a-MSH correlation with obesity induced hypertension Methods: 160 non diabetic individuals, under no medical treatment, mean age 46,7 \u00b111,14 years, were divided in 6 groups according to body mass index (BMI), as obese-Ob (BMI>30), overweight-Ow (25>BMI>30) and normal-Nr (BMI <25) and blood pressure (BP), as hypertensives-Hts or normotensives-Nts, according to JNC 7. Group I: Hts-Nr, II: Hts-Ow, III: Hts-Ob, IV: Nts-Nr, V: Nts-Ow, VI: Nts-Ob. NPY and a-MSH were calculated with ELISA. Statistical analysis was made by oneway ANOVA. Results: NPY/ a-MSH (ng/ml): Group I: 0.315/0.383, II:0.552/0.414, III:0.710/0.415, IV:0.408/0.440, V:0.373/0.454 VI:0.416/0.431. NPY increase was statistically significant (p<0.001) in group III compared to all others and in group II compared to I, IV,V,VI, whereas decrease was significant (p<0.001) in group II compared to III. Among Hts, NPY increased significantly (p<0.001) in groups II and III compared to I, but not among Nts in IV, V and VI (p>0.05). a-MSH showed no difference in any group. Conclusions: NPY (but not a-MSH) significantly increased in overweight and especially obese hypertensives compared to normal weight hypertensives and normotensives (even overweight and obese). NPY increase could be responsible for obesity induced HPT, something that needs further research and could lead to new therapeutical approaches.",

An association between thyroid function and components of the metabolic syndrome in euthyroid subjects has been reported recently. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of thyroid function abnormalities in obese children and adolescents and examine the possibility of an association between them and components of metabolic syndrome. T 3 , T 4 , TSH and antithyroid antibodies were determined in 380 obese children and adolescents (154 boys), aged 3.0 to 15.5 years and in 150 healthy children of normal weight matched for age and sex. All obese children had blood pressure measurements and plasma glucose, insulin cholesterol, triglyceride and HDL determinations, while 260 of them underwent an OGTT as well. Median values of T 3 and TSH of obese children were significantly higher than those of normal weight children. A positive correlation was observed between thyroid hormone concentrations and BMI z-scores of obese children. After adjustment for age, gender, sex and BMI z-scores, no significant correlation was found between T 3 , T 4 , TSH levels and HDL, cholesterol, or BP z-scores. However, an association was observed between TSH and HOMA-IR(r=0.22, p<0.01). In the group of 260 children who underwent OGGT, 70 (27%) were identified as having metabolic syndrome according to the WHO modified criteria. These children had also significantly higher TSH levels (p<0.05) compared to the rest of obese children. In conclusion, our findings suggested an association between thyroid function and at least two of the components of metabolic syndrome (obesity and insulin resistance) in obese children and adolescents, which needs further investigation.

However, it has not yet examined that the dose-dependent effects of fish oil in the diet therapy on diabetes compared with beef tallow. Therefore, we investigated which type of oil or energy ratio is more important in the therapy of diabetic mice. 5-wk-old female KKA y mice were divided into 4 groups and fed by high-fat diets (fat energy: 30%) or high-carbohydrate diets (fat energy: 10%) using beef tallow (B30,B10) or fish oil (F30,F10) for 9 wks after induced DM by a highfat diet for 3 wks. Energy intakes in each group were not significantly changed. Final body weight was not significantly changed, but liver weight was lower in F30 and F10 than that in B30 and B10. Fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels in 10wks were lower in high-carbohydrate diets (B10, F10) than that in high-fat diets (B30, F30). In glucose tolerance test in 11wks, blood glucose levels were lower in F30 and F10. Furthermore, plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride, nonesterified fatty acid and hepatic triglyceride levels were also decreased, and adiponectin levels were significantly increased in F30 and F10. It seems only a few differences of many biomarkers between 10% and 30% of fat energy, but fish oil is remarkably improved in glucose and lipid metabolism compared with beef tallow. Accordingly, we recommend that the diet containing fish oil (10~30 energy %) has almost the same therapeutic effects on diabetes in KKA y mice.

Objectives: Our aim was to compare the influence of low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets on anthropometric, metabolic parameters and other biochemical markers. Methods: We started a non-pharmacological weight-reducing treatment program for obese female patients with metabolic syndrome with a 600 kcal/day hospital treatment, then 91 patients received a 1200 kcal/day low-carbohydrate (low glycemic index) diet, while 30 patients consumed a low-fat diet with similar energy intake for 3 months. Results: Low-carbohydrate diet resulted in significantly higher (p=0.02) weight loss of a mean 8,56 kg (from 102.33\u00b118.64 to 93.77\u00b118.1 kg; -8.4%), than low-fat diet (6,06 kg weight loss, from 97.06\u00b121.48 to 90.6+-17.4 kg, -6.6%). Similar changes were observed in the low-carbohydrate group compared to the low-fat one in abdominal circumference (-8.03% vs. -2.69%, p=0.023), in BMI (-8.39% vs.-4.33%, p<0.0001), in body fat percentage (-7.57% vs. -2.46%, p=0.013) as well. Lipid profile improved significantly in the low-carbohydrate group (Chol: -5%, p=0.0128, Tg: -23.2%, p<0.0001), similarly to carbohydrate metabolism (glucose: -12.58%, p<0.0001, HOMA:-37.25%, p=0.03). We observed a significant decrease in the inflammatory marker CRP in the low-carbohydrate group (p<0.05). Serum leptin produced by adipocytes decreased (p<0.0001), as adiponectin increased significantly with weight loss (p<0.05).

In our previous studies we found lower number of insulin receptors in adipocyte plasma membranes, lower total protein content of GLUT4 in adipose tissue cell membranes and lower stimulation of glucose transport by insulin in isolated adipocytes of obese MSG rats. In order to test the potential role of inhibitory G-proteins in mechanisms of insulin resistance in adipose tissue of obese animals we determined the content of G i1 and G i2 proteins and an extent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in epididymal fat tissue cell membranes using immunoblot. MSG obese rats displayed adipose tissue hypertrophy, elevated levels of insulin, leptin, reduced level of IGF-1 and slightly elevated serum glucose. We found significantly decreased protein content of G i2 in adipose tissue plasma membranes of MSG rats. This was in accordance with lower protein tyrosine phosphorylation noticed in adipose tissue cell membranes of MSG animals. Our results confirm the role of G i2 in development of insulin resistance by crosstalk between the reduced level of inhibitory G-protein and insulin receptor mediated most likely by activation of phosphotyrosine protein dephosphorylation. Research relating to this abstract was funded by Grant VEGA 2/0162/08. Obstity is recognized as a risk factor for insulin resistance, type II diabetes, and several types of cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated that obese adipose tissue is characterized by increased infiltration of macrophages. It is considered that the paracrine loop involving monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 between adipocytes and macrophages establishes a vicious cycle that augments the inflammatory changes in obese adipose tissue. Polyphenols, which are widely distributed in fruit and vegetables, are reported to have anti-inflammatory properties. We investigated the effects of naringenin chalcone, one of the major flavonoids in tomato peels, on the production of proinflammatory mediators in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)stimulated macrophages and in the interaction between adipocytes and macrophages. Naringenin chalcone significantly suppressed the production of MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1, and nitric oxide (NO) by LPS-stimulated RAW264 macrophages. Coculture of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and RAW264 macrophages markedly enhanced the production of MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1, and NO; however, treatment with naringenin chalcone inhibited the production of these inflammatory mediaters. These data indicate that naringenin chalcone exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by suppressing the production of inflammatory cytokines in the interaction between adipocytes and macrophages. The antiinflammatory properties of nareingenin chalcone may be useful for ameliorating the inflammatory change in obese adipose tissue.

Objective: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) have been associated with metabolic syndrome (MS). The aim of this study was to determine the effect of risk factors of MS in ultrasonographic fatty liver. Methods: A total of 462 adult patients participated in this study. Fatty liver was diagnosed by ultrasonography. There were 189 cases of control (without fatty liver) and 273 cases of ultrasonographic fatty liver (USFL). USFL was consist of NAFLD (n=191) and AFLD (n=75). Criteria of MS were defined according to NCEP-ATP III criteria with a modified waist circumference cutoff (men > 90 cm; women > 85 cm). Results: Heavy drinking, smoking, inactivity, obesity, central obesity, blood pressure, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels of USFL were significantly higher than those of control (P<0.05). Obesity, central obesity, heavy drink, smoke, and inactivity were significantly associated with fatty liver. Obesity (BMI>=25) and ALT>35 (upper normal limit) were associated with MS in USFL after adjustment of various variables such as above. Odds ratios of obesity and ALT were 3.76 (95% CI 1.10-12.82) and 6.56 (95% CI 1.71-25.06), respectively. Predictive value positive (PVP) of 'USFL', 'USFL+obesity', and 'USFL+obesity+ALT' for MS were 16.1%, 27.2% and 35.0%, respectively in NAFLD. PVP of 'USFL', 'USFL+obesity', and 'USFL+obesity+ALT' for MS were 24.3%, 35.7%, and 52.9%, respectively in AFLD. Conclusions: Obesity and ALT are associated with MS in patients with ultrasonographic fatty liver.",

The association between atherosclerosis and chronic inflammatory state is well documented. The aim of the study was to evaluate relationship between SCORE risk and fasting and postprandial concentrations of selected inflammatory, proatherogenic chemokine serum levels: monocyte chemotactic protein MCP-1, E-selectin and intracellular adhesive molecule -ICAM in MS patients. Materials and methods: 75 patients (32 men, 43 women, mean age 40,4\u00b112,7 yrs) with MS from Outpatient Clinic for Metabolic Disorders were studied. Criteria to diagnose MS according to ATP III were fulfilled in all patients. SCORE risk was calculated (ESC 2007) . Fasting, postprandial (3-hour oral lipid tolerance test) MCP-1, E-selectin and ICAM concentrations were determined (ELISA). 3-hour areas under the curve (AUC) were estimated. Results: Positive correlation between SCORE result and BMI, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, were found in studied patients. We also found significant positive association between fasting MCP-1, ICAM, E-selectin concentrations, ICAM, E-selectin 3-hour postprandial AUC's and SCORE risk. Conclusions: In metabolic syndrome SCORE reflects risk related to increased body weight and elevated blood pressure. Positive relationship between SCORE risk and increased fasting and exaggerated acute postprandial response of selected chemokine and adhesive molecule concentrations has been found. Elevated pro-inflammatory response may be partly responsible for increased cardiovascular risk in metabolic syndrome.",

Background and Aims: Several noninvasive markers are being used to assess the structural liver damage in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). The objective of this study is to evaluated the correlations between obesity and noninvasive serum markers in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM) and chronic hepatitis C. Materials and Methods: Was selected 115 patients and divided in 2 groups: group A, 58 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic hepatitis C, and group B, 57 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The following parameters were observed: body mass index (BMI), HbA1c, hepatic profile, lipid profile, hematological profile. Noninvasive markers such aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ alanin aminotransferase (ALT) ratio, the AST to platelet ratio index (APRI) and -glutamyltransferase (GGT) were evaluated. Results: The average age was 60.2\u00b19.87 in group A and 57.73\u00b17.9 in group B. Obesity was present in 31,03% patients with CHC, and 61,4% with NASH. BMI value was bigger in steatohepatites group than in patients with diabetes and hepatitis C (30.52\u00b17.64 vs 27.6\u00b14.36 p=0.01). The cytolitic syndrome was more important in patients with obesity in both groups (AST 61.56\u00b158.02 vs 33.14\u00b124.47 p=0.0001, and ALT 74.00\u00b159.64 vs 39.82\u00b131.9 p=0.0003). Higher BMI was correlated with APRI and GGT, but not with AST/ALT ratio. Lipid profile, suggesting dyslipidemia was more frequent in obese patients. AST/ALT ratio and APRI was correlated with triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol but not with cholesterol, in pacients with CHC. Conclusion: Obesity and associated metabolic abnormalities play a rol in the progression of liver disease.",

Methodology: At the beginning of 2007, measurement of the feet of younger school children has been performed. On the basis of the BMI index, 40 boys and 40 girls have been divided into 4 weight groups. Local pressures between the foot and the sock lining by walking have been assessed with the PEDAR system. For processing the data measured, the shoe insole has been divided into 4 masks (heel, outer and inner longitudinal arch and metatarsal). In individual masks, maximum strength, maximum pressure and average pressure have been measured and difference of these values depending on the weight category of subjects have been monitored. Evaluation: When evaluating the tread forces between the foot and the shoe insole, the highest average value of the maximum strength and of the maximum pressure has been found in the metatarsal region and in the heel region. The values of the average pressure have shown that the foot of the subjects of all weight categories has been loaded in the way which corresponds with the anatomical step. With all variables monitored there have been ascertained increasing values of the variables monitored with increasing the body weight of the subjects.",

Stress is a cause of lifestyle-related diseases and the reduction of the harmful effects of stress is very important. Our previous study indicated that fish oil improved insulin resistance induced by the physical stress in lean C57BL/6J mice. Therefore, we investigated the effect of fish oil on insulin resistance and a lipoperoxidation under the physical stress in obese KKAy mice. Female mice divided into four groups were fed the each diet containing 10 or 30 energy % as lard (Lard 10%, Lard 30%) or fish oil (Fish 10%, Fish 30%). In addition, each group was divided into two groups by absence or presence of the stress induced by electric shock. Mice were given each diet for 6 weeks, in the last 2 weeks of experiments, mice of stress groups were exposed to the stress. In Lard 10% and 30%, the stress suppressed plasma insulin levels and elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels. By contrast, in Fish 10% and 30%, the stress elevated plasma insulin levels and did not change FPG. However, as induction of obesity independent of the stress, plasma adiponectin levels and anti-oxidant abilities were decreased, and TBARS in liver and WAT were not changed in all groups. These results suggest that the obesity itself is strong cause of induction of insulin resistance and reduction of antioxidant ability with or without physical stress, and fish oil improves insulin resistance induced by the physical stress in obese mice as well as lean mice.",

The genetic component of these complex phenotypes is partially overlapped. Common points may be represented by the genes involved in regulation of blood pressure or in insulin signaling pathway. Aim: to study the relationship between four polymorphisms and obesity in Romanian population. Materials and methods: Clinical data and blood samples were collected from 150 unrelated obese patients. We selected healthy subjects (n=150) with normal BMI (<25 Kg/m 2 ) as a control group matched for sex, age and Romanian Caucasian ethnicity. All four polymorphisms were genotyped using PCR based methods. Results: The distribution of genotypes for all polymorphisms is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The frequency of alleles is in the range reported for others Caucasians populations. Our results do not sustain the association between obesity and polymorphisms in ACE ID, ATR1 A1166C, eNOS ID and Insulin +1127 Pst. A trend of association has been observed regarding the distribution of Insulin +1127 Pst polymorphism (chi square=2.2) Conclusion: The present study, performed in relative small groups, showed that ACE ID, ATR1, eNOS ID are not a important contributors to obesity, while insulin +1127 Pst polymorphism could present a weak association with obesity in Romanian patients.

Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is characterized by calcification and ossification of ligaments. The pathogenesis of DISH is not fully understood but several factors have been implicated in the disease based on frequent associations with various metabolic conditions such as obesity, diabetes and dyslipidemia. It is not clear whether metabolic disturbances accompanying DISH originate directly from the disease or reflect conditions arising from high prevalence of obesity and insulin resistance in DISH patients. Therefore, we compared non-diabetic DISH patients with a group of age and body weight-matched controls. Both groups were subjected to oral glucose tolerance test and serum levels of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, growth hormone, IGF-1, IGF-BP3, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and uric acid were determined. The indices of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion were calculated. We found only reduced insulinogenic index and insulin/Cpeptide ratio in DISH suggesting decreased insulin secretion (IS) and increased uptake of insulin. Reduced IS is in accordance with lower levels of NEFA, as a stimulator of IS, in DISH patients. We assume that reduced insulin secretion and increased insulin uptake in tissues might be a clue in elucidation of DISH pathogenesis.

More severe values of hypertension, dyslipidemia and glucose were correlated with high values of WHR (>0.95), %BF (>30%) and BFM. Fitness score was measured, expressing the status of body composition. A score less than 70% means \"weakness\", while greater than 90 means \"athletic body type\". Mean value of the subjects was 71.1. Conclusions: Waist-to-hip ratio, body fat percent and body fat mass proved to be more helpful than waist circumference and BMI in assessing health risk in patients with metabolic syndrome.",

Results of human studies were inconsistent. This may be explained by different fats used as control (mostly olive oil), differing study duration and dose of supplements. Moreover, the content of anti-oxidative substances in preparations used was not standardized. Therefore, following study aimed at investigating the effect of CLA on endothelial function and metabolic risk factors compared to control oils adjusted to identical vitamin E contents. In a double-blind, controlled, parallel trial 81 men of the Metabolic Intervention Cohort Kiel were randomized to 4.5g/d CLA isomeric mixture (Tonalin\u2122) or 1 of 3 control fats. Endothelial function was measured using finger pulse waves (PAT) fasting and after a mixed meal (Oral Metabolic Tolerance Test, OMTT). Blood samples were taken before and 9h following OMTT before and after intervention. Fasting PAT remained unaltered with CLA, postprandial PAT was improved significantly versus olive oil. Body weight was significantly reduced with CLA as compared to all other fats. Moreover, fasting glucose and diastolic blood pressure decreased with CLA as compared to oxidized safflower oil, total and LDL cholesterol decreased within the CLA group (p < 0.05). Systolic blood pressure decreased within the CLA and native safflower group (each p <0.01). Isoprostanes were increased with CLA treatment. CLA beneficially modified several cardiovascular risk factors. Endothelial function wasn\u00b4t changed in the fasting state and improved postprandially by CLA as compared to olive oil. Biological relevance of F2-isoprostanes needs to be examined. Objectives: Obesity in childhood and adolescence increases the risk of the insulin resistance syndrome (IRS) and cardiovascular mortality in adult life. The aim of the study was: to evaluate the prevalence of the IRS in Caucasian obese children and adolescents. Materials and Methodology: We selected 102 obese Caucasian children and adolescents with no other diseases or treatment affecting body composition. 52 were males, 50 -females; mean age was 10.3 years. Body Mass Index (BMI) was 95 th percentile. Information on height, weight, waist and hip circumferences, Tanner staging, diet, physical activity, and birth weight, family history of obesity, diabetes, and CVD was collected. BP, OGTT and baseline plasma insulin were measured. Results: At birth 85% of the participants had normal weight and 5% had lower than normal weight. There was no difference in the prevalence of obesity among boys and girls in pre pubertal stage; in pubertal stage obesity was more common among girls (10.3% vs. 7.8%, p<0.05). Abnormal glucose homeostasis was found in 34%, dyslipidemia in 43% and hypertension in 8% of the participants. 30% had only obesity, 43 % had two IRS components, 24% had three and 3% had four IRS components. Positive family history for CVD and/or DM was noted in 36%. Conclusions: 27% of the children had three and more characteristics of IRS. This group of children are undergoing complex weight loss control program with individualized diet and therapeutical lifestyle modification. We plan to keep on monitoring the IRS components in these children along with weight loss program and physical growth.",

Fish oil contains various fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), antioxidants such as vitamin C and delta-tocopherol, and unknown ones. Therefore, we investigated to clarify the main components in fish oil bringing the improvement of insulin sensitivity. C57BL/6J female mice divided into 4 groups were fed the each diet (40% of fat energy); 1) fish oil diet containing antioxidants (FO), 2) extensively hydrogenated fish oil diet (HFO) excluded double bonds of unsaturated fatty acid such as EPA and DHA, 3) fish oil diet containing low amount of antioxidants (FO-low), 4) soybean oil diet (SBO) as a control for 11 wks. In final body weight, FO, HFO and FO-low significantly decreased compared with SBO, but FO groups were not different. In glucose tolerance tests on 8 wks, SBO tended to show higher blood glucose levels than FO groups, and FO tended to show lower blood glucose levels than that of HFO and FO-low at 15 and 30 minutes after an oral glucose load. In insulin tolerance test on 9 wks, FO tended to show the lowest blood glucose levels in four groups. These results unexpectedly suggest that the exclusion of EPA and DHA or reduction of antioxidants in fish oil did not affect body weight. However, unsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants may be important to improve insulin sensitivity.",

Key Words: obesity, type 2 diabetes, leptin, HOMA-IR, BMI Introduction: The percentage of hypertensive patients among children and youth grows every year. Very often hypertension coexists with obesity (or overweight) and lipids disorders. The aim of this work was to assess how often we meet risk factors such as: positive family history, obesity and dyslipidemia in groups of children and youth with primary hypertension. Material and methods: There were 86 patients under examination, aged 14-17 (50 boys and 36 girls) with primary hypertension. The given parameters were estimated: family history, blood pressure, height, weight, BMI, lipid profile. The control group consisted of 93 healthy subjects matched by sex and age. Results: In the analyzed group 39,53% of fathers and 27% of mothers had hypertension. There were also high percentage of obesity among parents -24,42% of fathers were obese and 29,07% of mothers. In examined population BMI was significant higher than in control group. Only in groups of 14 year old boys and 17 year old girls, the differences failed to reach the statistically significance. The average systolic blood pressure was the highest in the group of 17 year old boys and girls (145,0 \u00b1 7,79 mmHg and 143,3 \u00b1 8,16 mmHg respectively). The average diastolic blood pressure was the highest in group of 17 years old girls and 15-and 17 year old boys (88,3 \u00b1 9,83 mmHg and 85,0 \u00b1 9,06 mmHg and 85,0 \u00b1 8,02 mmHg respectively). In analyzed group 39,5 % of patients had both hypertension and obesity, and 8,1% had hypertension, obesity, increased total cholesterol and LDLcholesterol. Conclusion: 1. Overweight or obesity is the most popular risk factor in young hyperensives. 2. In this population hypertension was very often associated with dyslipidemia and family history.",

However, adipose tissue might also produce circulating MMP-9. The aim was to examine whether adipose tissue is a possible source for MMP-9 in the circulation, and if the metabolic syndrome might have a modifying effect. Design, Subjects, Interventions: Gene expression of MMP-9 was explored in adipose tissue, isolated adipocytes, atherosclerotic plaques, macrophages and various other human tissues. Both adipose tissue gene expression levels and plasma levels of MMP-9 were measured in obese subjects with and without the metabolic syndrome, treated with a weight-reducing diet. Relations between plasma MMP-9 and measurements of obesity and metabolic syndrome factors were analyzed in a population-based cohort of 61-year-old men. Setting: Research unit at university hospital. Results: Adipose tissue MMP-9 expression was high compared to that in most of other tissues, but atherosclerotic plaques and macrophages had considerably higher levels. Plasma MMP-9 was not associated with BMI. There were no correlations between plasma MMP-9, and adipose tissue MMP-9 expression, or changes in BMI. MMP-9 expression in adipose tissue was down-regulated, and plasma MMP-9 concentrations decreased during weight loss among obese patients with the metabolic syndrome. In the population-based study, MMP-9 concentrations correlated to biomarkers of inflammation, and metabolic syndrome tended to be associated with increased MMP-9 levels. Conclusion: Adipose tissue mass itself does not seem to contribute to circulating MMP-9, but rather obesity-related conditions such as metabolic syndrome and inflammation. Purpose: To determinate wether weight loss through VLCD diet along with cognitive-behavioral group therapy favored the modification of the risk factors, early diagnosis and prevention of Metabolic Syndrome Method and resources: 40 medical histories were selected randomly from CTMR records for the 2004-2007 periods, selecting obese patients (BMI above 25), and a waist circunference higher than 103 cm for men and 88cm for women (ATP III 2005/IDF/AHA/NHLBI) 24 patients were selected,.the average age was 45 to 55 years old, with preponderance of women. Outcome: Tthe total of the patients assessed presented at least one of the criteria of inclusion for Metabolic Syndrome at the time of admission. The percentage recorded was : 100% for obesity, 40% for dislipemia, 37% for high blood pressure, and 23% for type 2 diabetes a total of 57% of the patetients had 2 or more risk factors, and 43% shared one factor in common.",

The serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration were significantly associated with the metabolic syndrome and its components including waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels. In multiple logistic regression model with adjustments for age, sex, body mass index, education level, cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking habit, comparing to subjects with middle tertile of TSH, subjects with upper tertile of TSH but not subjects with lower tertile had significantly increased risk to have metabolic syndrome.

Metformin can improve insulin resistance and reduce body weight in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2, but also can influence the development of diabetes in patients with well-known risk factors such as obesity or pre-diabetic states. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of metformin on anthropometric and biochemical parameters in patients with metabolic syndrome without diabetes mellitus type 2. Methods: We studied 30 patients (19 women and 11 men; mean age 46.3 +/-5.8) with metabolic syndrome diagnosed based on IDF criteria, but subjects with diabetes were excluded. Study group was divided into two subgroups: treated with metformin in dose 1500 mg/day during 3 months (group A; n=16) and treated only by non-pharmacological methods (group B; n=14). Results: Patients who were treated with metformin had similar weight, % fat content, waist circumference decreasing as patients treated by nonpharmacological methods. There were no significant change of triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol in study subgroups, HDL-cholesterol increased in both groups after treatment. In patient treated with metformin higher decreased of fasting glucose level (-16.3 v. -7.6 mg/dl; p<0.05) were observed . Conclusions: 1. Three months regimen of metformin don't have any additional effect on weight reduction in patients with metabolic syndrome than in subjects treated only by non-pharmacological methods. 2. Metformin can reduce fasting glucose level in patients with metabolic syndrome without diabetes mellitus type 2.",

Objectives: To examine relationship between smoking, obesity and lipid profile in Greek smokers with type 2 diabetes, we study parameters regarding weight and lipids. Methods: Data from patients observed for six months. They were categorized in the basis of smoking or not, and following or not a strict diet pattern. Evaluation of association between smoking diet Body mass index (BMI) Weight, Weight Diference in six months(WD), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), Cholesterol, triglycerides, high and lowdensity lipoprotein (HDL), (LDL). Results: 408 Patients (mean age 65,5 years), 189 males 219 females mean age 63. Performing t test for independent samples by groups we found: No diference on BMI, weight, WD Tg, HDL between patients following and not following diet (p 0.17, 0.14, 0.96, 0.31, 0.73) respectively. There was a statistical significance difference in HbA1c p 0, 001. Patients on diet had statistically significant higher values of Chol and HDL p 0,014 and 0,045. Regarding smoking there was no statistical diference between smokers and not regarding BMI, WD, HbA1c, Tg and LDL, (p 0.91, 0.31, 0.31, 0.50, 0.54). Smokers were heavier than non smokers (p 0.049. Non smokers had also statistically higher values of Chol and HDL(mean 215 mg/dl and 51mg/dl) than smokers (mean 204 mg/dl and 47mg/dl). Discussion: Our results suggest that smoking affects negatively glucose, lipids regulation and weight gain in type 2 diabetics The aim of our study was to determine the use of certain agents that have been proved to exert cardiovascular protective properties in overweight hypertensive patients. We examined 376 hypertensive patients attending their first visit in our Department of Vascular Diseases, 301 of whom (119 men and 182 women) were overweight (BMI > 25) and were included in the study (mean age= 54,6 \u00b1 12,7 yrs). 85,4% of the patients were dyslipidaemic, 20,3% current smokers, 6,6 % had diabetes and 19,6% had a previous cardiovascular event. 25,6% of the patients were taking beta blockers, 27,6%, Ca channel blockers, 21,9% diuretics, 46,5% ACE inhibitors or AT1 blockers and only 5,3% statins, while none was under antiobesity drug treatment. The majority of the patients (41,9%) was under antihypertensive monotherapy. Study population was divided into high risk (= history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes->20% 10-year cardiovascular risk-23,6%) and medium risk patients (> 2 major cardiovascular risk factors-10-20% 10-year cardiovascular risk-76,4%). 11,3% of high risk patients was receiving statins and 53,5% ACE inhibitors or AT1 blockers compared with 3,5% (p=0,01) and 44,3% (p>0,05) of medium risk patients respectively. In conclusion, 46,5% of this overweight hypertensive population was taking ACE inhibitors or AT1 blockers and only 5,3% statins. Although the proportion of statin use in high risk patients was significantly higher than in medium risk patients, these proportions are remarkably low for these patients' groups. On the contrary, a satisfactory proportion of both groups were receiving ACE inhibitors or AT1 blockers, but this difference was not significant.",

However, little is known about how health professionals implement and deliver groups and how this compares and contrasts to the commercial sector. Aims: To compare and contrast existing models of group-based treatments for weight loss and to gain a user and leader perspective of health service and commercial programmes. Methods: Purposive sampling, guided by a sampling frame, was employed to identify groups with diverse characteristics and with differing content, structures and style. Six health service, six commercial groups and one self-led group were observed operating in their real life settings within Scotland. Subsequently, 11 semistructured interviews with group leaders and 22 interviews with group attendees were conducted. The study used a grounded theory approach and applied the Framework Method for qualitative data analysis. Findings: Compared with commercial groups, health service groups tended to offer short-term, closed-programmes, involving fewer attendees. Attendee expectations of the group leader varied according to the type of group attended, but seeking extrinsic motivation and inspiration from the group leader were common to both. There were gender differences in relation to the attendees' expectations of group leaders and the group process. Health service leaders had less opportunity for supervision or training in how to run their groups compared with commercial leaders. Conclusions: Resources, styles and structures differ both within and between commercial and health service sectors. Developing effective health service groups requires further studies to test factors such as group composition, programme flexibility and leader training. Funding: Research relating to this abstract was funded by an NHS Grampian (A Scottish Health Board) Endowment Fund, and The Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government Health Department.",

Results indicate only 50% of participants engaged in physical activity without their families. Participants' male partners engaged more in physical activity alone, suggesting strong gender roles in physical activity choices. Where solitary physical activity was in evidence, perfecting the body through 'bodywork' was central. However, swimming was still popular as a family activity. Participants felt less self-conscious about the perceived deficiencies of their bodies when swimming with their families as they focussed instead on their children's wellbeing, pool hygiene and risk. Hence, participants emphasised children's water safety. Time constraints were a key barrier to participation. Despite participants stating their interest in swimming, significant barriers exist for this group. These barriers were often linked to gender roles.",

Furthermore, the preference's influence on actual food intake is examined in a behavioural task. In our experimental paradigm (according to Field, 2006) , children aged 8-12 years were shown two cartoon characters on a computer screen. They were consistently paired with either a picture of a high-fat or a low-fat food. Before and after the presentations, relative preferences for the characters were registered. Nutritional knowledge was measured using a self-constructed questionnaire. In a behaviour task, the children's choice between two kinds of chocolate bars, depicted with either the high-fat food paired character, or the low-fat food paired character, was recorded. The rating of the positively but not the negatively conditioned character increased more from pre to post conditioning the higher the BMI percentile of the rating child.

With the introduction of palmtop devices and mobile technology, several operating systems are now available to measure a variety of physiological and behavioural parameters. Most of these systems measure one variable (e.g. blood glucose, subjective states). Therefore, a collection of separate devices need to be used to measure several variables. The electronic appetite rating system (EARS) was originally designed to measure subjective states of appetite and mood using the visual analogue scale technique (Stratton et al, 2002; Delargy et al, 1999) . The aim of this current development is to upgrade the EARS and to integrate a range of behavioural and physiological measures on a single device. The Electronic Device for Measuring Appetite and Physiology Profiles (EDMAPP) will provide a novel data capture tool for behavioural and physiological measures in clinical trials. Using Windows operating system, a Hewlett Packard PDA was used to administer subjective appetite and mood sensations, a liking and wanting food preference procedure (Finlayson et al, 2007) , and self-report questionnaires. Further programming is currently been performed to include measures of cognitive performance, food intake, physical activity blood glucose and body weight. Using bluetooth technology the data will be automatically downloaded to a secure internet site. In addition, the system could provide individuals with valuable feedback about their behavioural and physiological profiles. Such a device which is capable of measuring physiological and behavioural variables associated with energy balance and weight management, would serve as a useful technique to be used in clinical trials and as a personal weight management tool. Objective: Evaluate and improve negative body image for obese women with eating disorder. Wee took patients that followed a weight management group in the past. Methods: We created a \"therapeutic group\" during six months, two hours ever two weeks : 6 patients, mean age : 52.5 and mean BMI : 37.6 Kg/m 2 . We based on the program for body-improvement: \"The body image workbook\" published by Thomas F. Cash. We translated this program in French and adapted the protocol for our population: 13 seances instead of 8. We used also questionnaires for evaluating self-esteem, Body Attitude and the \"silhouette\" test before and after therapy The sessions were organised as follow: Session 1: discovering personal body image Session 2: harnessing knowledge for change Session 3: synthesis Session 4: destroying distress and create comfortable reflections Session 5: exposition on the mirror Sessions 6 and 7: establishing reasonable doubts Session 8: discussion about critical thinking Session 9: correcting the private body talk Sessions 10 and 11: identifying self-defeating behaviours Session 12: treating body right Session 13: discussion about how to preserve positive body image for live Results: We observe a better acceptance of their body and more satisfaction with it. They become more contented with their looks, are less self-critical of their body and are less preoccupied with their weight. We observed a better self-esteem and healthier attitudes. Conclusion: This therapy had a positive effect on body image, weight and selfesteem. Background and aim: Taking care of obesity is often de-motivating as far as long term weight lost results. The complexity of obesity needs to be evaluated with other criteria than weight lost. The aim of the project was to create and use a tool that would allow us to highlight the complexity of the treatment of obesity and the transformation of the patient during the follow up, in order to sustain motivation.",

Methods: Subjects were 144 women (BMI=31.1\u00b14.1 kg/m 2 ; Age=38.4\u00b16.7 y) who attended a 12-month obesity treatment program with weekly/biweekly group sessions covering exercise, nutrition, and behavior modification topics and a randomly-assigned comparison group (n=49), receiving a general health education program. Self-esteem, exercise level, and weight were assessed at baseline and at 12 months. Multiple mediation was tested by multiple regression, following procedures described by Preacher and Hayes (2007) . Treatment vs. comparison was the independent variable, while changes in body weight, self-esteem, and exercise were analyzed alternatively as mediators and dependent variables. Results: Weight loss was greater (p<.001) in the intervention group (-5.6\u00b16.8% vs. 1.2\u00b14.6%). Self-esteem improved in both groups (p<.05), while the intervention group was more active at treatment's end (p<.001). The self-esteem mediation model explained 15% of overall weight change (p<.001). Treatment total and direct effects were significant, while only the specific indirect effect of exercise was significant, suggesting that exercise partially mediated the treatment effect on weight change.",

Cognitive and behavioural therapy is known to be efficient in binge eating disorder treatment. New technologies can help disseminate these techniques in a cost-effective manner. An on-line supported self-treatment program for compulsive eating disorders, (STEP), is currently being evaluated with obese and non-obese patients suffering from binge eating disorder at the University Hospital of Geneva. The STEP program consists of 11 sequential modules based on cognitive and behavioral techniques. Each module includes lessons, examples and exercises. Patients work on a new module every two weeks and have six months to go through the program. During this time, the patient is required to have 3 face-to-face evaluation interviews and to maintain a weekly e-mail contact with a trained psychologist. The program is accessed with a pseudonym and a password. It is only available to patients who are supported by a trained health care professional. Program efficacy will be evaluated with standardized questionnaires for behavioural measures (eating disorders) and comorbidities (psychological health). Treatment phase is six months with a follow up evaluation six months after end of treatment. Repeated measures of symptoms during the treatment and follow up phases will allow us to describe the course of the illness and might help us find predictors of a good outcome. Some first results will be available at the ECO 08. Purpose: To analyze the relation between physical activity (PA) history and weight loss during a behavioural weight management intervention. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate this topic. Methods: At baseline, 116 overweight/obese women (age: 38.3\u00b17.0 yr; BMI: 31.9\u00b14.1 kg/m 2 ) were randomly assigned to intervention (IG) or control groups. The IG participated in a 12-month weight management intervention seeking to improve diet and nutrition and increase physical activity. Controls received a general health education curriculum. At baseline, participants completed a PA and exercise history questionnaire. PA was categorized by exercise intensity (light, moderate, vigorous) and life period (infancy, adolescence, adulthood) and quantified in min/yr per category. Associations between PA history variables and success were analysed with correlation/regression analyses and comparing success categories at program's end, defined as a weight loss greater than 4.9%; non-success corresponded to losing less than 2%. Results: In the IG, adolescent vigorous PA was associated with weight loss (rho=-0.25;p=0.048), and a trend was observed for total vigorous PA (rho=-0.22;p=0.081). Comparing success categories, the more successful group reported more total (p=0.001) and adult (p=0.004) vigorous PA, and more total adult PA (p=0.027). For controls only, adult (B=0.691;p=0.002) and infant (B=-0.520;p=0.017) vigorous PA were identified as negative and positive weight loss predictors, respectively. Conclusions: Results suggest PA history may predict success in weight management behavioural programs. Reporting higher levels of past vigorous activity, especially during youth, may be a prognostic marker for improved weight loss outcomes for women under behavioural obesity treatment. ",

Consumers purchasing the drug receive educational materials in the starter package and have access to an online, tailored behavioral support program (BSP), myalliplan.com. Individuals who enrolled in the BSP from June-November (N= 242,263) were mostly female (93%) with an average age of 39 years. Mean BMI was 32.3 kg/m 2 ; 9% fell within normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9), 34 % were overweight (BMI 25-29.9), and 57% were obese (BMI>30). Most enrollees were white, non-Hispanic (71%), with 8% African-American and 12% Hispanic. Percent weight loss for enrollees who reported their weight after 4 (N=51,897), 8 (N=26,374) and 12 (N=12,215) weeks in the program was 2.02\u00b10.01%, 3.23\u00b10.02%, and 4.33\u00b10.04% (mean\u00b1SE), respectively. A continuing online satisfaction survey conducted with a subset of enrollees in October 2007 (N=729) found an overall satisfaction rating of 78 (out of 100) with an average rating of 82 for functionality and 81 for site content. The most used features were informational lessons, menu planning, and feedback from check-ins. Most enrollees would recommend the BSP to someone else, were likely to return, and would use the site as the primary resource for obtaining information towards their weight loss goals (average score 80, 81 and 88, respectively). Most consumers agreed the site provided an honest and realistic approach (94%), an individualized plan (80%), and the support they needed (86%).

It has a poorly performing economy, a major issue with health inequalities, wide differentials in education achievement especially post-16, poor transport infrastructure, isolated and socially disadvantaged communities and pockets of great wealth, particularly in and around the Lake District National Park. The County's technological communications infrastructure is however very good with a very high take up of broadband internet technologies by individuals and communities. The health of the people is generally poor against European averages in medical conditions such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke. It suffers from problems of under-age drinking especially in West Cumbria, above average and growing levels of obesity and a higher than average incidence of teenage pregnancy. This paper to Conference aims to: Outline the role and potential of participatory video and photography as a component of personal and community development Consider the transformative potential of working with video and photographic narratives for individuals and communities Illustrate the range and depth of qualitative data gathered during this Visible Voice project Working in partnership with health professionals, social enterprises, University of Cumbria and local communities, this project makes use of the collaborative potential of participative video and photography to help people identify and express concerns about everyday life, health and well being. The process of creating and screening of videos and photographic exhibits can and is intended to lead to transformations in the lives of the researchers, participants and their communities. Completed films and photographic exhibits are viewed by the wider community and provide a stimulus for individual and community discussion around health and well being issues raised during the project.",

We hypothesized the IWQOL-Lite would be more sensitive/responsive to weight change. Data were from a RCT of an NPY-5R antagonist. Participants were 18 years with BMI 30-43kg/m 2 (or 27kg/m 2 with comorbidities). At baseline and one-year, participants [n=926; mean BMI=35.4; mean age=49.5; 84% female] completed the HRQOL measures and were weighed. Data were pooled to assess the impact of weight change (WC: weight gain, 0-4.9% loss, 5.0-9.9% loss, 10% loss) on HRQOL. We considered this approach to be warranted because no meaningful between-group differences in efficacy/safety were observed. For each WC group, effect sizes (ES) were calculated for mean changes in HRQOL. As hypothesized, ES for SF-36 and EQ-5D were smaller than for IWQOL-Lite. For IWQOL-Lite and EQ-5D total scores, improvements in HRQOL were observed in an increasing trend across WC groups, although ES for IWQOL-Lite were larger (0.12, 0.34, 0.62, 0.93 vs. 0, 0.03, 0.32, 0.53). For IWQOL-Lite Physical Function and Self-Esteem domains, 5.0-9.9% loss resulted in moderate ES (0.57 and 0.58), whereas 10% loss resulted in large ES (0.95 each). For SF-36, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and Mental Health domains showed deterioration or no change across all WC groups; Physical Functioning domain showed moderate improvement (ES 0.44) for 10% loss. In conclusion, compared to generic HRQOL measures, the IWQOL-Lite showed greater sensitivity and responsiveness with WC. Funding: Research relating to this abstract was funded by Merck & Co., Inc.",

We propose here a multidimensional approach addressing the cognitive (i.e. infra and meta), affective and perceptive dimensions of the person. This pedagogic strategy has been experimented with obese and diabetic patients. The results show that the patients can develop the capacity to estimate a physical activity intensity, their blood glucose levels, or other body perceptions such as hunger, satiety. In example, 40 diabetic patients have been trained to guess their glycaemia. 95.6% of 341 patient's trials fall in the acceptable Clarke's grid glycaemic domains. Moreover, this strategy increases the self-esteem of the patients, their motivation to learn (62% to 76% with psycho-pedagogy score) and the acquired knowledge related to the pathology (68% to 80% knowledge score). This has immediate effects on health outcomes, including a better control of the glycaemia (56% to 71% normo-glycaemia).",

A randomised, multicentric, cross-over design study was conducted in 121 healthy, normal and overweight, non-dieting women from France (mean age 32.1; mean BMI 25.0 kg/m 2 ) in order to evaluate the effects of Shape Lasting Satisfaction \u00ae on subjective appetite and subsequent food intake. Two hours after the consumption of a standardised breakfast (190 kcal), subjects were given as mid-morning snack a commercial portion (120g) of either Shape Lasting Satisfaction \u00ae (6.6% protein, 2.2% fibre, 0.1% fat, 75kcal/serving) or a marketed low-fat control yoghurt (3.5% protein, 0.5% fibre, 1.1% fat, 85kcal/serving). Subsequent food intake at an ad-libitum lunch served 2 h after the snack was measured. Appetite sensations (hunger, fullness, desire to eat, prospective food consumption and satisfaction) were recorded throughout the morning and an integrated appetite score was calculated. Post-prandial appetite profiles were analysed by a repeated-measures ANOVA. Compared with the control, Shape Lasting Satisfaction \u00ae significantly reduced subjective appetite over the 2 hours following consumption (all p<0.001) and reduced subsequent energy intake (65kcal) (p<0.01). In conclusion, a low-fat yoghurt enriched in protein and fibre effectively reduced short-term appetite in healthy subjects, which could be helpful for daily appetite and weight management. Women are more prone to nutritional deficiencies. Furthermore informing women about the basics of healthy eating will affect other family members, especially children, as well. This is a cross-sectional, interventional study performed on 500 female employees of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. Nutritional knowledge, attitude and practice of the subjects were determined by a questionnaire at the beginning. Then an educational intervention was performed in form of a lecture session plus distributing an educational booklet. Two months later, the efficacy of the intervention was re-assessed. Before the intervention mean of nutritional knowledge was 17.69 which raised to18.00 after education. Mean of nutritional attitude changed from 14.49 to 14.86 and mean of nutritional practice increased from 2.96 to 3.05.None of these changes were statistically significant (P-Values 0.225, 0.427 and 0.303 respectively).",

Physical activity turns out to be the strongest predictor of long-term weight loss. But only few obese individuals initiate physical activity and maintain their efforts. In this randomized controlled study, the efficacies of a standardized motivation intervention and a relaxation control intervention were compared with regard to increasing physical activity among obese individuals. Method: 38 obese participants were randomly assigned to a one-session motivation or relaxation intervention. Thereafter, both groups participated in an 8-week aerobic program. Compliance, motivational stage of change, physical activity, and body mass index (BMI) were assessed during intervention, and at 3-and 6-month follow-up. Results: Participants of the motivation intervention group attended significantly more aerobic exercise sessions than did participants of the relaxation intervention group and there were fewer dropouts. Moreover, weekly minutes of physical activity increased over time before leveling off, whereas steady decreases were observed in the relaxation group.

Typical treatments emphasize the health care professional as \"expert\"; a didactic, provider-centered method that has proved unsuccessful. Our purpose is to develop an improved communication style for health professionals working with the obese and overweight. This coaching methodology integrates concepts from many areas including positive psychology, motivational interviewing, the Transtheoretical model of change, and appreciative inquiry. And it includes an important element of flexibility regarding patient expectations and individualization of each patient's plan. This respects the patient's pace and values and facilitates an evolution from weight loss to wellness focused. The concepts and methods will be presented in detail. Our approach has been taught at two conferences of the IDEA Health and Fitness Association, to a multi-disciplinary clinical team at the University Hospital of Geneva, as part of dietetic internship programs at Georgia State University, Emory University, and Southern Regional Medical Center in Atlanta, GA , and published in the IDEA Personal Trainer periodical. It is part of an online tool used with over 30,000 members on several health/fitness and weight loss websites. And a randomized controlled trial in a University linked bariatric clinic will begin in early 2008 comparing coaching to a classic multidisciplinary clinical approach. In response to the need for health professionals to acquire tools and attitudes to better work with obese patients, this novel coaching method holds important promise.",

            "text": "We compared changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) over one year among overweight/obese individuals with different patterns of weight change (WC). Data were from 1246 participants in a RCT of an NPY-5R antagonist. At baseline, 12, 24 and 52 weeks, participants (86% female; 78% Caucasian) completed the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (IWQOL-Lite) questionnaire and were weighed. Treatment group data were pooled because no meaningful differences in drug efficacy/safety were observed. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify patterns of WC, distinguished by timing/amount of weight loss/gain and presence/absence of weight regain. IWQOL-Lite changes over time were compared across WC patterns using growth curve analyses (GCA). Seven distinct WC patterns were identified using optimal fit statistics: 2 (5.1% of the sample) depicted significant weight loss (~12% at 24 weeks) followed by either weight regain or continued weight loss; 2 (34%) with moderate weight loss (~5-8%) followed by weight regain, 1 (44.4%) with no weight change, and 2 (16.5%) with initial weight gain (~3%) followed by subsequent loss or return to baseline. GCA revealed improvements in all IWQOL-Lite domains regardless of WC pattern, with the largest improvements in Self-Esteem. ANOVA revealed significant differences in HRQOL changes among WC patterns only for Physical Function (F=2.59; p=.02) and Total score (F=2.08; p=.05). While research has shown that moderate weight loss significantly improves HRQOL, these results indicate that further research is needed to better understand the impact of weight loss patterns on HRQOL and the possibility of a Hawthorne Effect. Funding: Research relating to this abstract was funded by Merck & Co., Inc. Therapeutic education takes its place among the revolutionary biopsycho-social approach of the medical care in Romania. First used in diabetes care education, we literary struggle to initiate and perpetuate medical courses for primary care and ambulatory care medical services providers. Our project -Therapeutic Education for Patients with Chronic Diseaseshas been initiated the early 2007 and is developed now for three counties in Romania. The program has four \"steps\", each of them for three days, and it consists of interactive role playing, psychological group projects, evaluation tests and power point presentation of the main topics. We have involved psychologists, complementary therapists, actors, drama artists and musicians. We gather experience every day within chronic patients with obesity, diabetes, and alcoholism. We have organized support groups for patients (alcoholism and obesity), and also we have introduced a new form of support group, \"mixed\" with patients and doctors, -a group that we use in all interactive work groups to illustrate and exemplify for example the roles in the \"dramatic triangle\", or the spontaneous attitudes from the medical check ups. It is a very common belief, that the battle against overweight is won primarily through increase of physical activity and reduction of food intake. Very often other issues such as psychological and social aspects are not given much attention. There is increasing indication, that this, as well as societal prejudice, are reasons why many existing programs show low sustainability and quite humble success rates. Through clinical experience it becomes obvious that a mere functional approach, such as the well-known input/output model are not going to be efficient. Furthermore, short term treatment programs of only a few months do not take into consideration, that in order to achieve a sustained reduction and stabilization of weight long term changes in regards to life-style, relationship patterns, regulation of emotions and stress are required. On the basis of this experience the multi professional and interdisciplinary out-patient treatment program \"Adifit\" at the University of Berne, Inselspital was developed. The treatment includes adequate medical therapy, psychological group counselling, nutritional counselling, somatic psychology and physical activity during a 36 months' program. The workshop will present the structure and content of the program. Case examples will illustrate the multi professional team approach. Particular emphasis will be given to the transfer and integration of skills and insights -as they are discovered and practiced within a therapeutic context -into the everyday life of the patients. The experience of self-efficacy is seen as an essential prerequisite in dealing with the unavoidable setbacks and hurdles in the process of weight reduction.",

This questionnaire includes a separate lifestyle PA scale. The agreement between Ob_PAR and accelerometry was explored by Spearman rank-order correlation and Bland-Altman analysis. Results: Comparing the Ob_PAR lifestyle scale with accelerometry, lifestyle PA was associated with light (min/wk) (rho=.282; p=.001) and moderate PA (min/wk) (rho=.231; p=.004) from accelerometry. Contrarily, the Ob_PAR lifestyle PA scale was negatively correlated (rho=-.218; p=.056) with sedentary behavior evaluated from accelerometry. Moderate PA (rho=.267; p=.019) and vigorous PA (rho=.252; p=.028) from Ob_PAR were correlated with moderate and vigorous PA from accelerometry, respectively. Using the Bland-Altman analysis, Ob_PAR was found to overestimate moderate (+48.2\u00b164.1 min/day) and vigorous (+23.8\u00b154.8 min/day) PA, compared with accelerometry (p<.001).

During a 10 days interdisciplinary weight loss programme, 19 hospitalized obese patients have received a training to enable them to perceive hunger, gustative pleasure and satiety. A self-evaluation grid containing the following elements has been used: eating pattern, meal context, eating desire and cognitive restrictions. A food interview and a questionnaire have been done before and after the hospitalization and 3 months after. At 3 months: 89% improved their eating pattern; 47% improved their eating conditions; 10% rediscovered hunger; 16% managed better their eating desire; 21% reintroduced more flexibility in eating pattern; 37% rediscovered gustative pleasure and 39% satiety; 10% stopped feeling a postprandial heaviness; 26% felt more confident and self-efficient in weight management.

LighterLife is a commercial weight management programme for those with BMI >29kg/m 2 initiating weight loss via a nutritionally complete Very Low Calorie Diet (VLCD), as well as Transactional Analysis and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy techniques (TCBT) specifically developed for behavioural modification in weight management. Following weight loss, there is an ongoing weight maintenance programme with continued support helping patients implement and sustain further healthy lifestyle changes. Aim: To determine weight maintenance outcomes two years after weight loss in a cohort of 40 women. Method: Initial weight loss data was collected by LighterLife Counsellors on a weekly basis and 2 years (+/-12 weeks) after weight loss. Results: Mean start weight 97.4Kg Mean initial weight loss 26.5Kg Two years after initial weight loss Maintained weight at least 5% below start weight 82.5% at least 10% \" 72.5% at least 50% \" 62.5% at least 80% \" 20 % Conclusion: 2 years after losing weight on the LighterLife programme, 82.5% maintain at least 5% and 72.5% maintain at least 10% of initial weight loss and may continue to benefit from reduced co-morbidities associated with weight loss. Further studies will be carried out to determine the outcome of those who do and do not avail themselves of the long term weight maintenance support offered by LighterLife. Introduction: Many of the patients resign from the weight-reducing therapy shortly after the start. Both external (lack of family support) and internal factors (lack of motivation, depression) may exert the influence on the subjects. The aim of the study was to assess the influence of depression level on the time of continuation of the complex, group, weight-reducing program. Patients and methods: 217 obese subjects starting three-month complex, group weight-reducing therapy were included into the study ( Obesity has multiple causes, both the genetic predisposition on metabolism and the regulatory component of the feeding behavior playing important roles. Materials and methods: 84 families (medicine students and their parents) were included in this study. The mean age of the students (56 girls and 28 boys) was 23,5\u00b11,2; for the parents was 47,5\u00b17,2. The BMI of the females was 23,2\u00b13,4 Kg/m 2 , and for the males was 23,3\u00b14,6 Kg/m 2 . Both the students and their parents were asked to complete the 3 Factor Eating Questionnaire -18 questions. The questionnaire generates 3 scores: cognitive restraint, uncontrolled eating and emotional eating. Results: The following variables were associated with the risk of being overweight or obese -obese father (p<0,01), obese mother (p<0,05), both parents obese(p<0,01). Family history of obesity was a predictive factor (OR=3, 1; CI=1, 2) . From the 3FEQ-18 data, an association for cognitive restraint inheritance was observed (p<0,05), in students of both sexes. Emotional eating seems to be associated with the inheritance from both mother and father in female students.",

Thirty obese patients suffering from eating disorders took part in the arttherapy programme. The art-therapy workshops take place over a period of twelve weeks with a weekly session of two hours. Each session is broken down into three phases. The first phase helps the patient to become aware of his body. The second phase brings the bodily sensation to creative art-work. The third phase is a verbal expression about the pictorial art-creation.

Tutors -a dietitian and a clinical psychologist. Duration of group counseling -10 sessions for 2 hours during 10 weeks. During the first session, body weight, height and body composition analysis were determined. Based on a nutrition pyramid, the food ration was developed (1200-1400 kcal); individual and group goals were set. Subsequent sessions included estimation of body weight and composition, brief analysis of the previous week, required nutritional information and psychological exercises. Following each session, the patients received a home task. Special copybooks were prepared for the patients to do their homework in. For psychological counseling, a combination of CBT, Art Therapy and Gestalt Therapy methods was employed. The final session was held at a restaurant to analyze the acquired habits of choosing food and dishes in real life. As a result, the average weight loss in the group was 5.2 kg, new eating habits were acquired, own needs were referred to and vital activity increased. Although the study is still in progress, it can already be said that a psychological-nutritional group counseling is an effective mode of weight loss treatment; it is a highly efficient method of work with the patients in the long-term weight loss program.",

Before the trial all of them consumed four to eight cups of Turkish coffee per day (300-700 mg caffeine per day), for more than 10 years. During the trial period (duration 8 weeks) they were asked to consume no coffee and not to change diet and lifestyle. Results: At the beginning of trail, total cholesterol serum concentration was 5.64\u00b10.96 mmol/L in normal weight volunteers and 6.57\u00b11.23 mmol/L in overweight volunteers. In both normal weight and overweight participant , abstention from boiled coffee for 8 weeks was associated with a decrease in the total cholesterol serum concentration of 0.67\u00b10.71 mmol/L (t=4,009; p=0,0009; p<0,001, 2 =2,92; p=0,087; p<0,1) and 0.74\u00b10.75 mml/L (t=4,392; p=0,0003; p<0,001) respectively. Conclusion: Coffee consumption abstention for 8 weeks is associated with decrease in total cholesterol concentration in both normal weight and overweight adults but health effects was statistically significant only in normal weight group. It is well understood that obesity can have a significant impact on an individual's health and wellbeing, which can in turn impact on day-to-day life. LighterLife is a commercial weight management programme for those with BMI >29kg/m 2 initiating weight loss via a nutritionally complete Very Low Calorie Diet (VLCD), as well as Transactional Analysis and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy techniques (TCBT) specifically developed for behavioural modification in weight management. Following weight loss, there is an ongoing weight maintenance programme with continued support helping patients implement and sustain further healthy lifestyle changes. Aim: To determine changes in self-reported ability and ease of walking one mile during 2 nd and 13 th week of the LighterLife Programme Method: A sample of 100 female LighterLife clients who completed the LighterLife Programme between March 06 and June 07 filled in questionnaires to rate basic markers of general health and wellbeing, including self-perceived difficulty in walking one mile, during the 2 nd and 13 th weeks on the LighterLife Programme. During that time their weight reduced by an average of 15kg. Obese people keep on living diet as a temporary and extraordinary phase of life, either as a punishment or a deprivation, with negative drawbacks on motivation and self-esteem. At the Clinical Nutrition out-patients dept of Policlinico Tor Vergata in Rome, a therapeutical group intervention has been recently activated ,with the supervision of a psychologist and a dietist. The \"here and now\" focus of this intervention is aimed to stimulate a greater awareness of food use, to ricollocate nutrition in its originary and adaptive function with the aid of self-esteem improvement strategies , and to re-educate to an healthy nutrition and a correct life style. Selected patients (25>BMI >30 ), coming from numerous unsuccessfull dietetic attemps, undergo a psychological examination and self-administrated tests (SCL90r,EAT26,BUT). If eligibile they are included in \"Lifestyle\" groups (6-8 subjects). Patients undergo retests during the 8 weekly meetings (60 minutes each) and the 3 control meetings scheduled. In 2007, 28 obese subjects out of 32 enrolled, completed all the steps. Comparing scores, an improvement of the general mood has become apparent, with a remarkable diminishing of anxious states and an improvement of body perception, even in absence of conspicuous weight loss. 8 patients exhibited a significant weight loss. Every participant recognized a changing in the way of assessing Obesity, not as a cause but as an effect. In conclusion, a positive answer relative to the possibility of changing has been observed in this, although not representative, sample of patients. Results: BMI standard deviation score was higher in boys (0.16 \u00b1 1.81) compared to girls (-0.07 \u00b1 1.49) on conventional therapy and it was significantly higher a year after starting intensified regimen in both (boys 0.38 \u00b1 2.09 and girls 0.42 \u00b1 2.15). HbA l c in girls was 10.23 \u00b1 2.18% before and 9.69 \u00b1 2.35% a year after onset of intensive insulin therapy, while boys had HbA l c 9.79 \u00b1 2.04% before and 9.54 \u00b1 1.86% a year later. There was no significant positive correlation between BMI and HbA l c before and year after onset of intensive therapy. Conclusions: Intensive insulin treatment improves metabolic control in adolescents with T1DM, but it is often related to weight gain. There is a need for more effective prevention of obesity in adolescents with T1DM on intensive insulin therapy.",

            "text": "The purpose of this communication is to report of the life experience of obese people. Do they define their obesity as an illness, a problem, an injustice ? Do they apprehend their obesity as a break in their life or more as a continuum? Is the obesity seen as something they have to fight against or as an event which could potentially give a meaning to their life? Has the obese person the feeling she has to put up with her obesity or does she think that she has the resources to face it, and which (material, medical, relationships, symbolic\u2026) ? To what kind of therapeutic paths does obesity lead? These are the questions organising the framework of this comprehensive research. Considering the definition of illness as a \"complete social fact\", the point of view developed here exceeds the conception of illness as subject of observation in order to give an account of the \"body-subject\", the body \"that can neither be submitted entirely to the rationality of the other, nor correspond perfectly to the theories and tools used by professionals\". It is a question of taking into account the meaning of the experience of illness and suffering by giving room to the word and knowledge inherent to the ill person seen as a human being inextricably peculiar and social. The results coming from the analyses of ten thorough interviews conducted during the exploratory phase of our research allow to present a typology of the experience of obesity. Introduction: Sex Specific Central Obesity(SSCO) and obesity are the main modifiable risk factors for type 2 diabetes(T2D). Aim:To study the incidence of obesity indices and weight loss effects and their relations to control and complications of the disease.",

Height, weight, waist circumference were measured while the body mass index(BMI) and sex specific central obesity(SSCO) were estimated, as well as waist/hip ratio. Furthermore, blood samples were collected for HbA 1c . Macro-and microangiopathy complications of diabetes were also estimated according to international criteria. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS 10.01. Differences were considered significant, if p <0.05. Results: A total of 813 patients(365 men, 448 women, mean age 65,56 \u00b1 0,4 years) were studied, with a mean duration of diabetes 12,7 \u00b1 0,3 years. 37,7% were obese, 42,3% overweight, 72,3% had SSCO and 54,8% had high waist/hip ratio. HbA1c levels were positively correlated with BMI levels(p<0,01 r=0,12) but not with waist or waist/hip ratio. Neither obesity, SSCO or waist/hip ratio associated with macro-or microangiopathy complications of diabetes in our diabetic population. Weight loss in the previous 6 months was associated with better diabetes control(HbA1c 6,9 \u00b1 0,1 Vs 7,3 \u00b1 0,1). Conclusions: In persons with diabetes, chronic hyperglycemia is related to the development of microvascular disease. Ongoing clinical trials, suggest that improvements in glycemic control may also lower the risk for cardiovascular disease.Obesity is one major modifiable risk factor for glycemic control. Introduction: Adults with intellectual disabilities have a higher prevalence of obesity than the general population. Since carers supporting adults with intellectual disabilities have been shown to play a part in implementing weight loss interventions, this study examines paid carers' training needs relevant to lifestyle changes. Methods: An interviewer administered questionnaire was used to examine paid carer knowledge of public health recommendations on diet and physical activity; perceptions of the benefits of healthy diets and physical activity levels; and the carer views on the barriers to change experienced by individuals with intellectual disabilities. Results: A total of 78 carers took part in the study. Overall paid carers have a low level of knowledge around public health recommendations on diet and physical activity. Paid carers are significantly more likely to have full knowledge of the public health recommendation for consumption of fruit and vegetables than that for physical activity (chi\u00b2= 21.8, p<0.001). Greater importance is attributed to the benefits of diet than physical activity, in improving health and reducing the risk of disease (z=-2.8, p<0.01), Twenty six per cent of carers said there were no relevant barriers to the participant changing to a healthier diet, and 23% believed that there were no relevant barriers to the participant with intellectual disabilities increasing their level of physical activity. Conclusions: Paid carers have significant training needs relevant to weight loss interventions. Training initiatives for paid carers should be considered a key part of effective weight loss interventions for adults with intellectual disabilities. Funding: This study was funded by the Research and Development Directorate of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Introduction: Obesity treatment is successful in respect to short or middleterm effects but long-term success is not satisfying. A combination of diverse salutogene and pathogen factors influencing eating and exercise style is important in respect to obesity development, progress and management. One purpose of the study was to identify salutogene factors that are meaningful for successful long-term weight management. Methods and Material: A group comparison design was used to examine differences in quality and quantity of the adopted salutogene strategies and the assumed hierarchical influence of the single factors constituting successful long-term weight management. A broad battery of questionnaires was necessary to measure salutogene and pathogen factors. The psychological test battery consists of the interdisciplinary test system for obesity diagnosis and evaluation \"Ad-Eva\" (Ardelt-Gattinger & Meindl, in press).",

            "text": "The results show that in almost all relevant dimensions the successful weight management group showed more significant and stabile health promoting behaviour patterns. The successful weight loss maintainers show more flexible control in their eating patterns, report higher levels of physical activity and active leisure time behaviour, have better implementation strategies of their knowledge about health promoting behaviour, are lower in eating disinhibition and restraint, craving, binge eating and subclinical eating psychopathology. Conclusions and Discussion: The significant and substantial differences in psychological dimensions should be implemented in a hierarchical structure of criterions that constitute health promoting behaviour in obese subjects so that multi-trait and multi-method analysis of the existing data has to follow to clear the promising results of the presented study. The trucking sector significantly impedes truck drivers' opportunities for physical activity and prudent dietary patterns, thus substantially elevating their obesity risks. This paper examines how the \"transportation environment\" (government regulations, trucking operations, corporate policies in trucking settings, and the built environment) in North America triggers, exacerbates and sustains truckers' risks for obesity and associated comorbidities. Methods: By utilizing the MEDLINE and TRANSPORT databases, an exhaustive review of health and social science literature was conducted on truckers' obesity risks, and 120 journal articles and reports were identified for closer analysis. From these, populations, exposures, and relevant outcomes were evaluated within the framework of the transportation environment. Results: Strong links between the transportation environment and truckers' risks for obesity and associated comorbidities were delineated, and a conceptual framework was developed to illustrate potential causal links between the two. While this framework does not constitute the basis for an integrated theory on the role of environmental factors in obesity risks of professional drivers, it does offer a logical step toward the eventual formulation of such a theory by permitting the operationalization of diverse constructs that can be empirically tested. Moreover, it provides direction for preliminary environmentalscale interventions to curb trucker obesity. Conclusions: This framework underscores the need for further empirical research to: (a) appraise the health parameters of trucking settings; (b) assess truckers' obesity risk trajectories; (c) examine potential causality between the transportation environment, inactivity and poor diets and related comorbidities; and (d) develop, implement, and evaluate interventions to mitigate trucker obesity. Objectives: To measure resting and ambulatory systemic blood pressure (BP) and left ventricular mass (LVM) in pre-pubertal obese and lean children, and to determine their relationships. Study design: Cross-sectional study including 44 obese and 22 lean prepubertal children (mean age 8.8\u00b11.5 years). We measured: casual and 24-hour ambulatory BP; LVM and LVM index (LVMI) by echocardiography; whole body lean tissue and fat mass by DEXA. ) were significantly higher in obese than in lean subjects. Systolic ambulatory hypertension was present in 47.6% of obese children, casual BP missing the diagnosis in 55% of cases. Body fatness, lean tissue mass and 24hour BP correlated positively with LVMI. When adjusted for body fatness, LVMI was associated with 24-hour systolic BP only (adjusted R 2 =15.9%; p=0.001). Conclusions: Ambulatory systemic hypertension and increased LVM appear before puberty in obese children. Left ventricular mass is partially determined by systemic BP; however increased LVM may occur before the development of hypertension. We conclude that prevention and treatment of childhood obesity should be initiated as early as possible to prevent the premature development of hypertension and end-organ damage.

Australian children have high levels of exposure to television advertising of high fat, high sugar foods, which are broadcast more frequently during programs popular with children. By contrast, there has been little published research on the use of persuasive marketing techniques in food advertising in Australia or internationally, despite evidence that food marketing influences children's food preferences. This study aimed to investigate children's exposure to persuasive marketing techniques in food advertising on Sydney commercial television. Advertisements broadcast on all 3 commercial Sydney television channels were recorded for the equivalent one week period in 2006 and 2007. Food advertisements that used persuasive marketing, including premium offers (competitions, toys, rebates and vouchers) and promotional characters (celebrities and cartoon characters) were identified, with type of persuasive technique and food type coded by members of the research team, and checked for reliability. Commercial data on children's viewing patterns were used to determine peak viewing times. Of the 20,201 advertisements recorded over 14 days, 25.5% were for food. During children's peak viewing times, 61% of food advertisements were for high fat/high sugar foods. More food advertisements contained promotional characters (P<0.05) and premium offers (P<0.001) during children's peak viewing times compared to non-peak times. There were 18 times more food advertisements using premium offers during programs popular with 5-12 year olds than during adults' popular programs (x 2 1 = 19.76, P<0.0001). Persuasive marketing of high fat/high sugar foods is targeted specifically to children and must be considered as part of the debate on advertising regulations.

This systematic review and metaanalysis is the first to assess current available evidence relating to the association between maternal obesity and the risk of congenital anomaly. Method: The electronic databases Medline, Embase and Scopus were searched using a comprehensive keyword list for articles published from January 1966 to September 2007. Studies were included if they were English language observational studies reporting data on weight in pregnancy and an outcome measure of congenital anomalies. Pooled odds ratios comparing the risk among obese and non-obese mothers (defined by BMI) were determined for all congenital anomalies (NTDs, cardiovascular, renal and alimentary tract anomalies) and congenital anomaly groups with >150 cases across all the studies. Results: We found 1737 potential articles, of which 38 met the inclusion criteria. Five were excluded because of over-lapping data, one due to fewer than 150 cases for the congenital anomaly and two because type of congenital anomaly was not specified, leaving 23 studies in the meta-analysis. Pooled odds ratios comparing the risk among obese mothers to non-obese mothers identified statistically significant increased risks for NTDs [1.84 (95% CI: 1.62, 2.09) ] and all cardiovascular defects [1.22 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.30) ], as well as for several individual anomaly subtypes. Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis found an almost twofold increased risk for NTDs and a smaller but significant risk for cardiovascular anomalies. This has implications for prevention and screening. Funding: KS was supported by the charity BDF Newlife Introduction: This study examines associations among 2-year old children's BMI, diet, eating behaviors and parental feeding styles in a racially diverse group of mothers who were overweight prior to pregnancy. Methods: Mothers (n = 176) participating in a 2-year postpartum obesity prevention trial brought their 2-year old in for their final follow-up visit. Children's height and weight were measured and mothers completed a survey including the Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ) (Wardle, 2001) and the Parental Feeding Style Questionnaire (PFSQ) (Wardle, 2002 ). Mothers reported their child's dietary intake on two separate days and data were analyzed using Nutrition Data Systems (NDS) software. Results: Average energy intake (Kcal) was associated with child eating behaviors with both whites and African-Americans, specifically Food Responsiveness (r=0.242, p=0.001), p=0.047), Desire to Drink (r=0.180, p=0.017), p=0.014) . When stratified by race, Food Responsiveness (r=0.288, p=0.011) was significant only for African Americans. Similar correlations between energy intake and PFSQ revealed significant findings for Instrumental Feeding for whites (r=0.211, p=0.043) and all races (r=0.190, p=0.012) . Control was significant only for African Americans (r=-0.281, p=0.014) . Correlations between child BMI z-score (zBMI) and CEBQ were significant for Enjoyment of Food for whites only (r=0.189, p=0.039). On the PFSQ, Emotional Feeding was correlated with zBMI for whites only (r=-0.185, p=0.042).",

We proposed to lower the self-reported BMI threshold defining obesity to 29.0 for men and 28.4 for women. This yielded to an estimation of obesity prevalence similar to the one obtained using measurements (15.1% vs. 14.4%, p=0.21) and was the best compromise between sensitivity (83.5%) and specificity (96.4%). A validation procedure was performed on a different population. From 1993 to 2004, a sample of 13,266 men and women (500 each per year) was recruited in Geneva, Switzerland. Self-reported and measured BMI were routinely collected. The reduced threshold for obesity based on self -reported data was applied and its performance compared to measured data. The reduced obesity threshold could correctly classify subjects in 95.5% of cases, with a sensitivity of 88.9% and specificity of 96.5%. Positive and negative predictive values were respectively 78.6% and 98.4%. Subjects in population studies tend to underestimate their weight and to overestimate their height. This yields to erroneous obesity prevalence in populations where this estimation is based on self-reports only. Contrasting with corrective equations, this readily applicable reduced threshold does not require collection of additional data. Its applicability to other European or American countries requires further validation. Background: Obesity frequently clusters with aberrant blood lipid levels and insulin resistance. As nuclear receptors and transcription factors play an important regulatory role in fatty acid and glucose homeostasis, genetic variation in these key regulators and downstream pathways may be involved in the onset of obesity. Objective: To explore associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes from regulatory pathways that control fatty acid and glucose metabolism, and repeated measurements of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference in a large Dutch study population. Methods: A total of 384 SNPs across 253 genes were genotyped among 3575 participants of the Doetinchem cohort, who where examined three times during 11 years, using the Illumina Golden Gate assay. Adjusted random coefficient models were used, whereas false discovery rate q-values were calculated to account for multiple testing. Significance of the associations was defined as a q-value below 0.20. Results: Two SNPs in FXR and SMARCA2 (in women only) were significantly associated with both BMI and waist circumference. In addition, two SNPs in SIRT1 and SCAP (in women only) were associated with BMI alone. Another SNP, in IL6, was associated with waist. None of these associations has been reported before. Another 23 associations between SNPs and either BMI or waist had p-values less than 0.05, but q-values above 0.20. Conclusion: In our explorative study among a relatively large population-based sample we detected five novel SNPs associated with obesity-phenotypes. Replication of these findings and further research on the functionality of these SNPs is necessary. Funding: Research relating to this abstract was funded by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Internal funding for strategic research; project number S/350600). Accelerated weight gain after (adeno)tonsillectomy has been reported in children. Underweight used to be common in children undergoing (adeno)tonsillectomy and, in the past, increased weight gain was invariably described as a beneficial effect. Nowadays, underweight is not as common as it used to be in the patient population and recent studies showed that weight substantially increased after (adeno)tonsillectomy, not only in underweight children, but also in normal weight and overweight children. We investigated the association between (adeno)tonsillectomy and overweight in 3,963 children, participating in the Dutch PIAMA birth cohort. Children were recruited from the general population. Weight and height were measured by the investigators at the age of 8 years. Data on adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy and on confounders (gender, birth weight, maternal education, maternal overweight, maternal smoking during pregnancy, breast feeding and smoking in the home) were obtained from annual questionnaires completed by the parents. The cumulative incidence up to age 8 was 11% for adenoidectomy (without tonsillectomy) and 14% for (adeno)tonsillectomy. Logistic regression analysis showed that (adeno)tonsillectomy was significantly associated with overweight (including obesity) at age 8 (adjusted OR:1.87; 95%CI: 1.31-2.65). Adenoidectomy (without tonsillectomy) was also associated with increased risk of overweight, but the association was not statistically significant. Overweight at the age of 2 was not associated with increased risk of (adeno)tonsillectomy in later years ( ",

Methods: Height, weight, systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as well as elbow flexion, hand grip and knee extension strength were measured from 1,157,750 Swedish men born between 1951 and 1975 Background: Capsaicin, catechins, caffeine and CH-19 sweet pepper have been shown to stimulate energy expenditure and fat oxidation and to some extent reduce appetite and energy intake. These effects might depend on energy balance. Objectives: To investigate how capsaicin, green tea, CH-19 sweet pepper as well as green tea and capsaicin added to three daily meals during respectively negative and positive energy balance affect appetite and energy intake. Design: 27 subjects were randomized to three weeks of negative energy balance and three weeks of positive energy balance during which they received: 1) capsaicin, 2) green tea, 3) CH-19 sweet pepper 4) capsaicin + green tea and 5) placebo treatment. The effects on appetite and desires (100 mm VAS), energy intake (kJ), body weight and heart rate were assessed. Results: CH-19 sweet pepper and a combination of capsaicin and green tea were found to reduce energy intake more during positive than negative energy balance, whereas capsaicin and green tea given individually increased fullness during negative and reduced hunger during positive energy balance. The effect of CH-19 sweet pepper on appetite was less evident. Capsaicin and green tea in combination were found to suppress hunger and increase satiety in both energy conditions however larger effects on appetite were found during negative energy balance. Conclusion: Thermogenic food ingredients induce greater energy intake effects when used in combinations, and when used in positive energy balance. We conclude that they may rather contribute to prevention than to treatment of overweight and obesity.

Because studies may rely on maternal recall, it is important to evaluate the quality of this information. Objective: To determine the accuracy of maternal recall of children BW and GA, using the Danish Medical Birth Register (DBR) as reference and to examine the reliability of recalled BW and its potential correlates. Method: The accuracy studies of BW and GA were composed respectively of 1271 and 678 mothers of schoolchildren, who participated the European Youth Heart Study. The reliability sample of BW was composed of 359 women. The agreement between the two sources was evaluated by mean differences (MD), intra-class correlations (ICC) and Bland-Altman's plots. Misclassification of the various BW and GA categories were also estimated. Results: There was high agreement between recalled and registered BW (MD = -0.2 g; ICC = 0.94) and GA (MD = 0.3 wk; ICC = 0.76). Only 1.6% of BW would have been misclassified into low, normal or high BW and 16.5% of GA would have been misclassified into pre-tem, term or post-term based on maternal recall. The logistic regression revealed that the most important variables in the discordance between recalled and registered BW were ethnicity and parity. Maternal recall of BW was highly reliable (MD = -5.5 g; ICC = 0.93), and reliability remained high across subgroups. Conclusion: Maternal recall of BW and GA can provide accurate information for clinical and epidemiological use regarding fetal and infant growth. Recent analyses suggest differences in the trends of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). The implication is that the nature of excess body weight may be changing to one of greater abdominal obesity. Considering the stronger association of WC with metabolic and cardiovascular risk, this has implications for the burden of obesity-related disease. We analysed trends in BMI and WC (using data from the 1989 National Heart Foundation Risk Factor Prevalence Study, 1995 National Nutrition Survey and 1999 -2000 , focusing on their distributional shifting, changes in skewedness, and changes in the prevalence of risk categories of each. We found that mean BMI increased between 1989 and 2000 by 0.7kg/m 2 in males and 1.1kg/m 2 in females, and mean WC by 4.7cm in males and 5.7cm in females. To explore differences in the increase, we compared the proportions of the population in 2000 that were above the 1989 median BMI and WC -66% for BMI; 58% for waist, and compared z-scores. The rightwards distributional shifts between 1989 and 2000 were significantly greater for WC than BMI, but the degree of this difference differed by age, sex and BMI level. Greater skewing occurred for BMI than WC. Within all BMI categorieseven those considered 'normal' -the prevalence of 'low risk' WC decreased and the prevalence of 'substantially increased risk' WC increased. Our results suggest that the nature of excess body weight may be changing over time, and provide insight into the relative utility of BMI and WC risk categories.",

Since obesity is associated with increased mortality, the aim was to investigate whether this SNP is associated with all-cause mortality, indicating a causal effect of the SNP associated fat mass on mortality. Methods: The study population consisted of 362,200 men appearing at the Danish draft boards between 1943 and 1977. All obese men with a body mass index (BMI) >=31.0 kg/m 2 (n=1,930), and a non-obese control group consisting of a 1% random sample of the study population (n=3,601) were selected. All obese and half of the control men were invited to the Copenhagen City Heart Study (CCHS) in 1991-94. Of these, 1,622 individuals (hereof 749 obese) were genotyped using Taqman allelic discrimination. Cox regression models were used, with age at CCHS as the underlying time scale. Follow-up ended on September 1 st 2000, but will be extended. Results: Among the 1,622 individuals under study, 477 were wildtype, 797 were heterozygous and 348 were homozygous for the T to A change of rs9939609. During follow-up 75 subjects died. The hazard ratio for mortality was 1.33 (95% CIs 0.75-2.36) among the heterozygous and 1.75 (95% CIs 0.90-3.39) among the homozygous carriers compared to wildtypes. Adjusting for baseline BMI or fat-BMI eliminated these associations. Conclusion: There is a tendency that homozygous carriers of the FTO SNP have an increased mortality rate compared to wildtypes, indicating that the increased BMI associated with the SNP may translate into an increased mortality.",

Fish and fish oil intake have health benefits. The objective of the study was to determine whether fish consumption interacts with the Pro12Ala polymorphism in the relation with insulin sensitivity. The study was a cross-sectional analysis of ICAPS' baseline data (a randomized trial designed to prevent overweight in adolescents). 573 children were genotyped for the Pro12Ala polymorphism. Fish consumption was determined by use of a food-frequency questionnaire. Compared to Pro/Pro homozygotes, the presence of the 12Ala allele was significantly associated with lower HOMA (1.81\u00b10.11 vs. 2.02\u00b10.06 in Ala allele carriers vs. Pro homozygotes, p=0.016) after adjustment for age, gender, sexual maturity, parents'sociooccupational status, participation in leisure-time organized PA and body fat. When the effect of fish consumption on HOMA was further investigated, a significant interaction between fish consumption and the Pro12Ala polymorphism was found (p=0.039) such that the Ala allele was associated with lower HOMA in regular fish consumers while no difference was seen in low fish consumers. Plasma phospholipids FA composition were analysed in a subsample (n=283) of subjects. Regular fish eaters had significantly hightened plasma DHA and n-3 PUFA compared to low fish consumers. However neither of the plasma FA interacted with the Pro12Ala polymorphism on HOMA. Although the 12Ala allele may protect adolescents against insulin resistance, this effect may depend on diet characteristics, especially PUFA from fish, the mechanism of which remains to be determined. The Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, Scotland; 2 University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, Scotland 3 NHS Grampian, Aberdeen, Scotland Introduction: The National Health Service (NHS) Grampian Health Board is served by 90 general practices and covers a population of approximately 526000 in the north-east of Scotland. We aimed to determine if the current provision of height and weight measuring devices was sufficient for obesity management in this primary care setting. Methods: All 90 practices were surveyed and 77 (86%) responded. Data was collected by telephone or fax. Results: The number of weighing machines at each practice varied between 2 and 20. The maximum weighing capacity within the practice was identified by 51 respondents and ranged from 127kg to 250kg. Only 25% of practices had at least one scale that measured beyond 150kg. 45 respondents (58%) indicated that new scales would be beneficial to their practice. 22 of these practices (49%) cited a need to conveniently measure and monitor weight change in very heavy patients, including a third of practices that already had at least 1 scale that measured >150kg. Reasons in the latter group included practicalities such as patients having to be escorted elsewhere within the practice to be weighed. Other reasons included avoiding embarrasment caused to patients unable to be weighed, and the potential benefit in obesity management. Conclusion: Obesity prevalence is increasing worldwide, and an increasing number of health programmes are being created to address this. However, without adequate facilities to measure and monitor weight and BMI changes of the overweight and obese, these health programmes will not be able to achieve proper implementation or success. The Czech Republic has undergone rapid political, social, and economic transformation since the late 1980's. While obesity rates among children and adolescents have been rather low previously, situation changed recently, as we can document on large data coming from country-wide anthropological surveys that have been conducted in the Czech Republic regularly (in 10-year intervals) for more than 50 years. We will show (secular) time dynamics of 50 th , 90 th and 97 th BMI percentiles (obtained from LMS and/or its more recent counterparts like GAMLSS). Secular BMI distribution changes are not homogeneous, stressing that different parts of the youth population are subject to different obesity risks. The most dramatic changes have been observed among school-aged children, where BMI-for-age values have increased at the 50th, 90th, and 97th percentiles. In contrast, adolescent girls are thinner. In addition to the overall BMI-for-age curve behaviour, we investigate adiposity rebound (AR) as one of its' important features. AR evidently shifts to earlier ages in the Czech population over last 50 years. On the other hand, shape of the BMI-for-height curve has not changed substantially. We will demonstrate (by means of modern functional data analysis techniques) that in the Czech population, a lot of \"general obesity increase\" (except perhaps for extreme categories) is tight to secular height changes. This illustrates importance of proper height adjustment in the historical population obesity assessments -especially when non-negligible secular height trend is present.

Methods: We conducted three population-based examination surveys in 1989 (n=1,081; participation rate: 86.4%), in 1994 (n=1,067; 87.0%), and in 2004 (n=1,255; 80.2%) . Occupation was categorized as \"laborer\", \"intermediate\" or \"professional\". Results are adjusted to the population of 2002. Results: Between 1989 and 2004, mean BMI increased markedly in all sex and age categories (overall: \u223c0.15 kg/m 2 /calendar year). The prevalence of overweight and obesity combined (\"excess weight\", BMI \u226525 kg/m 2 ) increased from 29% to 52% in men and from 50% to 67% in women. The prevalence of obesity (BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 ) increased from 4% to 15% in men and from 23% to 34% in women. Mean BMIrespectively the prevalence of excess weight-was lower in laborers than professionals in men but higher in laborers that professionals in women and this pattern was similar in the three surveys. Odds ratios for excess weight in professionals vs. laborers were 2.10 (95% CI: 1.94-2.17) in men and 0.51 (0.48-0.53) in women, adjusting for calendar year and participants' age and smoking habits. Conclusion: The prevalence of overweight/obesity increased markedly during a 15year period. Similar increase of BMI over time in all age and sex categories suggests common environment obesogenic factors. The association between SES and excess weight was in opposite directions in men and women. The study emphasizes the need for prevention measures in all sex, age and SES groups, and suggests that they should be tailored according to sex and SES categories. S189 T5:PS.33",

To further explore the genetic pathways underlying these diseases in a unique ethnic population, we performed a linkage scan on a single Filipino family with a high prevalence of MeS, SA and obesity related traits. Methods: A large rural family (N=50, 50% adults) underwent a 10 cM genome-wide scan. Fasting blood was used to measure insulin (INS), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol (HDL). Attended overnight polysomnography was used to quantify the respiratory disturbance index (RDI), a measure of SA. BMI zscores and HOMA-IR scores were calculated. Variance component linkage analyses were conducted in SOLAR on transformed traits, adjusting for age and sex. Results: 38% were obese, 10% had diabetes and 46% had elevated RDI. Linkage peaks with LOD scores >1.5 were demonstrated for BMI on chromosomes 3q (LOD=1.6), 12q (LOD=1.54), 16q (LOD=1.71), and 19q (LOD=1.50) and for HOMA and INS on 2q (LOD=1.68), 4q (LOD=1.77), 21q (LOD=1.51) and 22q (LOD=1.68). Linkage to HDL was seen on chromosome 7q36 (LOD=2.54). The highest peaks for RDI were observed on chromosome 9 (LOD=1.35) and 15 (LOD=1.00) and for TG on chromosome 10 (LOD 1.51). Conclusion: This first report of MeS traits and SA in a Filipino family confirmed previously observed linkage peaks and identified novel linkages. This scan provides evidence for underlying genes in MeS and SA with candidate genes involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid homeostasis. Background: Weight loss and exercise habits are effective to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes. Objective: This study evaluated a community-based diabetes prevention program by health care support for increased physical activity and weight loss in community-dwelling people. The study was a cluster-randomized-controlled trial based on the residential area as the unit of randomization. Methods: In each intervention residential area, volunteer health supporters were selected. After education in leadership, practice, and first aid, the 96 volunteers ran an organized healthy walking campaign and walking groups at several community centers. Emphasis was a placed on the integration of walking into daily routines. Subjects in the control residential area received health information only. To evaluate lifestyle habits, each subject completed a self-administered questionnaire. The primary endpoint was the incidence of diabetes evaluated by the use of anti-diabetic agents. Results: At baseline, there is no difference in age, sex, BMI or exercise habits between the intervention groups (n=942) and control group (n=354). The walking time and steps significantly increased in the intervention group after a 2-year intervention program, while those in the control group did not change.",

However, the influence of socioeconomic status on risk factors of obesity in children has not been thoroughly explored particularly in a multiethnic population. The purpose of this study was to investigate if risk factors of childhood obesity such as diet and sedentary activities differ by socioeconomic status. The present study is a cross-sectional population-based study of 1411 schoolchildren of various ethnicities aged between 10-12 years old. Habitual dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviours were measured using questionnaires administered by trained enumerators. Body Mass Index (BMI) was used as an indicator of obesity. 10.1% of the schoolchildren were obese while 15.2% were overweight. Prevalence of obesity was significantly higher among boys (11.7%) compared to girls (8.7%). Children from families with high monthly income had significantly higher BMI (19.1 kg/m 2 ) compared to those from families with medium or low monthly income (18.2 and 18.3 kg/m 2 ) respectively. Children of high income families spend significantly less time playing outdoor games and more time watching television. They were also more likely to skip breakfast and consume fast food and soft drinks more frequently than children of lower income families. Intervention strategies and methods to promote healthy behaviours in children must take into consideration socioeconomic status which may contribute to the observed differences in the prevalence of obesity among children in Malaysia.

The Assuring Health for All in the Free State (AHA FS) study is an epidemiologic study that aims to provide an estimate of the disease burden attributable to infectious diseases and undernutrition on one hand and obesity and its comorbidities on the other. The aim of this sub-study was to determine anthropometric nutritional status of rural children and adults in the Southern Free State province of South Africa. Methodology: Anthropometric data was collected for all participants (adults 25-64 years and pre-school children) who gave informed consent in Trompsburg, Philippolis and Springfontein, using standard measuring techniques. Results: Data was collected for 598 participants (390 female, 163 male, 45 children). More than half (66%) of females were overweight and obese (BMI >25kg/m 2 ). In men, 23% were overweight and obese, 44% had a normal body mass index kg/m 2 ), while 33% were underweight (BMI <18.5kg/m 2 ). In children, prevalence of underweight (weight-for-age <-2SD) was high at 47%, stunting (height-for-age <-2SD from NCHS median) was 35%, and wasting (weight-for-height <-2SD) 19%. In households with overweight and obese adults (n=31), a high percentage of children were malnourished (46% underweight, 23% stunted and 29% wasted).",

Objective: Because attitudes regarding physical activity for obese children may vary amongst immigrant (IP) and non-immigrant parents(NIP), the aim of this study was to compare attitudes of both groups towards physical activity and sedentarity. Methods: Families of children referred to the nutrition clinic at a tertiary care Canadian pediatric hospital were recruited upon their first visit, after anthropometric data confirmed obesity. At least one parent per family was interviewed with a standardized questionnaire on sociodemographic status and attitudes towards physical activity. Responses of IP were compared with those of NIP parents. Results: The sample consisted of families of 43 children. Mean age of the children was 11.9 years (SD 2.5); 58.1% were girls. Mean BMI was 32.9 kg/m 2 (SD 5.1); mean z-score for BMI was 2.39 (SD 0.26). Responses were obtained from NIP in 30 (69.8%) instances and from IP in 13 (30.2%) instances. All IP and 90.0% of NIP correctly identified lack of physical activity as a cause of obesity in children (p=0.2), while 69.2% of IP and 80.0% of NIP identified excessive TV and computer games as causative (p=0.4). Seventy percent of IP compared to 60.0% NIP described their child as \"not very\" or \"not athletic\" (p=0.9). Seventy seven percent of IP and 86.7% of NIP said they often or always stimulated their child to exercise (p=0.6). Thirty one percent of IP and 33.3% of NIP said they often or always exercised with the child to encourage physical activity in their child (p=0.8). When asked whether the following items were reasons preventing the child from doing sports, 72.7% of IP and 64.3% of NIP identified lack of a person to accompany the child (p=0.6); 58.3% and 60.7% identified \"the child tires too quickly\" (p=0.9); 53.8% and 63.3% identified \"the child doesn't want to, he prefers television or computers\" (p=0.6). Conclusion: Both immigrant and non-immigrant parents of obese Canadian children acknowledge lack of physical activity as a contributor to obesity. Despite this, both groups of parents perceive their children as sedentary. Barriers to physical activity in obese children need to be addressed in a family context.",

This is contrary to the sterotype of South Asians valuing fatness. We explored whether health professionals recognized that overweight is considered indicative of ill-health in this minority ethnic group. Methods: 80 Bangladeshi men and women, without diabetes, participated in 10 focus groups, purposively selected for generation, age and BMI. Groups were conducted in Sylheti or English, recorded & transcribed. Nine standard body images, ranging from underweight to obese, facilitated exploration of beliefs about weight and diabetes risk. Lay participants identified figures with the worst/best health and most/least likely to develop diabetes together with their associated reasoning. 24 health professionals [nurses, dietitians, health advocates, doctors] participated in 3 focus groups and identified what they believed lay participant's choice of figures would have been. Data were analysed by thematic content analysis using the constant comparative method. Results: 1 st and 2 nd generation lay participants suggested obesity reflected poor lifestyle choices and increased diabetes risk. Middle sized figures were considered the healthiest. Conversely many health professionals believed lay participants linked obesity with health, fertility and wealth. Others were unclear of lay perceptions reporting time constraints, language difficulties or trust issues precluded exploration and understanding of this area. Health advocates highlighted the changes that had occurred in community views on fatness and health over the last 30-40 years. Conclusions: This mismatch between health professional and lay views on weight and diabetes risk has important implications for health education and health professional training.

We also explored possible effects of children's sex, body size, place of residence, and parental education on attitudes toward body size. There was a strong association between the body size of the figure being rated and the probability that the children were negative (x 2 df2 =858, p<.0001). Children were 20.5 (95% CI 16.0-25.7) times more likely to be negative to the thin figure compared to the average figure and 52.9 (41.7-67.6) times more likely to be negative to the fat figure compared to the average figure. In turn, the fat figure was more negatively judged compared to the thin figure, OR=2.6 (95% CI 2.3-2.9). BMI, parental education or urban-rural residence did not affect attitude scoring. Conclusion: To deviate from the weight norm increases the risk of being judged negatively, especially if fat. However, not all children hold negative attitudes and studies are needed to determine potential causes of children's attitudes toward body size.

Our aim was to determine the relation between BMI and grade of esophageal damage in patients with GERD symptoms. We studied 917 subjects (53.76% females), aged 37\u00b17 y.o., with endoscopy procedure. BMI in males was higher than females (26.8\u00b13.5 vs. 25.2\u00b14.5, p<0.001). All subjects had a physician interview for evaluation of symptoms associated with GERD (Likert scale). Esophagus distal portion was evaluated endoscopically to determine the presence of mucosal injury according Los Angeles criteria (LA). Severe esophageal damage (C-D ulcers) was associated with intensity of heartburn, retching, halitosis, regurgitation, and chest oppression. The grade of esophageal damage was associated with overweight (BMI 25-30 OR=2.8 95%CI: 1.2, 6.7), but not with obesity (BMI >30). A BMI > 30 were associated with a higher score for heartburn and retching, but a lower for nausea. Using surface response graphics we found that overweight (not obesity) patients with esophageal damage scored C-D had the highest scores for heartburn and retching, adjusted by sex, age, and geographical distribution (using general lineal model).

A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted where self-reported level of pubertal maturation was entered in step1, socioeconomic status in step2 and sleep duration (adjusted for age) in the third and last step. The results showed that the level of pubertal maturation was positively and level of socioeconomic status was negatively associated with body mass index.

Methodology: Participants: 44 overweight and obese children (BMI 34.3\u00b15.7 kg/m 2 , age 14.5\u00b11.8 years). Intervention: An eight-week (max) programme of physical activity, reduced-energy intake and behaviour change education. Assessments: Subjects completed the two types of assessment at the beginning and end of their camp stay. Across-the-day ratings were made before and after each meal and at two hours post meal (9 timepoints) using a hand-held electronic rating system. These ratings were averaged to provide a single score for comparison. End-of-day ratings were paper questionnaires. Results: All end-of-day ratings correlated significantly with across-the-day ratings at both pre (r=0.32-0.74) and post (r=0.31-0.73) camp. However, there were significant differences between measures with across-the-day ratings showing a narrower range of mean values for appetite and mood. Looking at pre-meal ratings, hunger and desire to eat showed a moderate increase across the day and fullness decreased; a pattern which had disappeared by the end of camp. Discussion: These findings show the merits of both assessment approaches in a freeliving environment. Across-the-day ratings are relatively labour intensive but provide detailed profiles of appetite/mood that vary meaningfully over the waking hours. End-of-day ratings are simple to administer, describe overviews of appetite/mood that can be collected prospectively, and are as sensitive as averaged across-the-day ratings. Inter-changeable use of these approaches however is not advised given differences in precision at rating scale end-points. This research is supported by a project grant from GlaxoSmithKline, UK. The food industry needs objective tools to assess the nutritional quality of products and set targets for improvements. However, existing measures are largely focused on total diets or only locally applicable. We (Nijman et al. EJCN 2007; 61:461-471) have recently developed and published a globally applicable method to evaluate the levels of trans fats, saturated fats, sodium, and sugars across a wide foods and beverages portfolio. Setting energy criteria for specific foods is complex because energy density differs greatly between products, and portion sizes are not internationally harmonized. Nevertheless, we have now developed a methodology to evaluate the energy content of foods, based on published recommendations for energy density, energy requirements and intake patterns. Criteria for meal components and beverages are based on energy density. Ready-to-eat meals and snacks potentially make a large energy contribution to the diet, but products vary considerably in both energy density and portion size. Therefore, criteria for these products are based on total energy content. The energy model has been developed to guide product innovation in order to help reduce the risk of excessive energy intakes.",

Objective: To describe weight change over a ten-year period among a population based cohort of older Australians. Methods: A cohort study of people aged 49 years and over at baseline (82% of those eligible) living in two postcode areas west of Sydney. In 1992-94, 3654 people were examined; 2334 people were re-examined five years later and 1952 people 10 years later (75% survivors). Over the ten years of follow-up 1113 people provided measured weight and height data at all three collection periods, with mean age of 62 years at baseline. Results: At baseline, 57.9% of these 1113 participants were overweight or obese (BMI >25); 0.8% were underweight (BMI<18.5). Ten years later, 65.9% were overweight or obese, and 1.2% were underweight. The incidence of weight gain in this population was higher than weight loss at both 5 year and 10 year follow up, with over 50% of participants gaining greater than 2 kg. Conclusions: It has generally been thought that weight loss is more of a concern than weight gain among older people, however this longitudinal study indicates that weight gain is more likely to be occurring. With a large aging population, continued weight gain further increases the burden of chronic disease. These data have implications to support policy and interventions which prevent weight gain among older people. Aims: IOTF(International Obesity Taskforce) obesity definition have not had sufficient evidences in predicting cardiovascular consequences. Recent suggestion is made to apply ancillary measure in addition to assessment of general fatness. The aim of this study is to determine the cutoffs of body mass index(BMI;in kg/m 2 ),waist-circumference(WC), and body fat percentage(%BF) based on cardiovascular risk factors. Methods: The height, weight, WC and %BF was measured manually and by bioelectrical impedance analysis for 449 subjects aged 9 to 11. The cutoffs were determined using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. We estimated age-adjusted odds ratios(ORs) for high blood pressure, high total and LDL cholesterol, high triglyceride, low HDL cholesterol and having more than 2 risk factors. Results: ROC curve analysis indicated that all the cutoffs were from 60 to 80 percentile of the subjects. The ORs for having more than 2 risk factors increased abruptly for BMI, WC, %BF of 22.8, 76cm, 36.1% in boys and 21.7, 70.3cm, 34.5% in girls, respectively in the 80th percentile of the subjects. The each cutoff of BMI and WC is approximately 90th percentile of the BMI for age updated nationally in 2007. Conclusions: Cardiovascular risk factors prevalences increased greatly with the BMI for age at the level above 90th percentile and the insulin resistance can be predicted well with the WC for age at the level above 90th percentile as ancillary measure. Therefore the screening and early prevention should be emphasized for children with BMI at the lower level than the definition currently used.",

Methods: WOO was conducted as a series of separate sub-studies comprising focus groups or interviews with parents, school students, school teachers, early childhood staff and doctors. Participants were recruited through schools, childcare centres and General Practice Divisions in 4 different socioeconomic locations across the state of New South Wales, Australia. Discussions covered participants' understandings about childhood obesity, how they responded in professional or community roles, and views on how other groups should respond. In total, 26 focus groups and 17 individual interviews were conducted. While each sub-study generated specific themes regarding the target groups' perceptions, many themes spanned different groups. Results: Parents, students and professional groups were all aware that childhood obesity was a problem which resulted from a complex set of causes. Participants from all groups acknowledged that parents play a pivotal role, but require support, particularly when children are younger. Parents, students and teachers interpreted weight as one aspect of overall health and expressed concern that the focus on obesity might promote eating disorders. Weight was seen as an awkward topic to talk about. Weight and food were emotional issues, which contrasted to perceptions about activity. Conclusions: Social norms that link weight with people's identity and appearance are reflected in perceptions about childhood obesity. These issues must be considered in the design of communications and programs, if they are to be effective. Funding: The NSW Centre for Overweight and Obesity received funds from the NSW Department of Health and The Ross Family Trust for this work.",

The Vyronas study is a cross-sectional health and nutrition survey. During 2004/2005, a sample of 2008 schoolchildren was selected. BMI was calculated and a semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire was applied. Multiple logistic regression and discriminant analysis were used. Results demonstrated that there is a strong positive association between the parental overweight/obesity status with their children. Discriminant analysis showed that the frequency of breakfast consumption and the consumption of diet drinks are the factors that better distinguished overweight/obesity of both sexes in relation to parental obesity. Furthermore, the frequency of the consumption of pulses was the factor that better distinguished overweight/obesity of girls, while the time devoted to sports activities was the factor that better distinguished overweight/obesity of boys in relation to parental obesity. In conclusion our findings illustrate that eating and lifestyle behaviours are probably influenced differently for boys and girls within the family environment demonstrating the need for sex-specific interventions in order to promote healthy eating and physical activity behaviours during adolescence. 6%) . We compared the prevalence of obesity (BMI 30) for different age groups among men and women in the two studies. Results: The prevalence of obesity among men was 11,0% in the telephone survey, but 17,1% in the health examination. For women the prevalence was 10,8% and 22,7% respectively, p<0,0001 for both sexes. The difference seems to be greatest among younger women. Conclusions: An important underreporting of obesity may be expected when depending only on epidemiological information from telephone interwieving. As telephone or postal surveys are relatively easy to conduct and will be used to monitor obesity prevalence, it is important to be able to make a correction for eventual underestimation.",

Objective: To investigate the risk of death from all and specific causes according to BMI status in young adulthood. Methods: Height and weight were measured at military conscription between 1969 and 1983 (n=693 381; 18.3\u00b10.4y). Date and cause of death and emigration were collected from national registries between 1969 and 2007-09. Data on muscle strength, municipality, socio-economic position, testing centre, and test year were adjusted for in Cox proportional hazard models. Results: The mortality risks among overweight and obese were significantly elevated for all causes, CVD, cancer, injuries and other causes (Table) . In the underweight, the pattern was different. Conclusion: In this age-group, the risk of non-cancer/non-CVD/non-injury death in the overweight was significantly elevated, although of smaller magnitude than for cancer and CVD. The risk of death from injuries was also elevated for underweight, overweight and obese. Objective: To evaluate the perception of body shape and body weight and their relationship with actual body weight in two non-western migrant origin groups, Turks and Moroccans. The association with acculturation was also studied. Methods: Cross-sectional study, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Males and females (18-30yrs) randomly selected from the population registry (n=451). Participants, or at least one of their parents, were born in Turkey or Morocco. Perception of body shape was assessed using silhouette drawings and individuals were asked to describe their weight. Acculturation variables were generation status, cultural orientation and social contacts. Results: Participants had a thin ideal body shape. The discrepancy between ideal and current shape was significant in women but not men (p<0.0001). Perceived current body shape was correlated with BMI (Spearman's correlation coefficient 0.60, p\u20220.001 (men) and 0.733, p 0.001 (women)). Nevertheless, among overweight participants (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m 2 ), 70% of men and 35% of women described themselves as \"average\". Paying attention to body weight was associated with a discrepancy between ideal and current shape amongst women and with describing oneself as \"overweight\" amongst men. Ideal body shape was not associated with any of the three acculturation variables. Conclusion: As is typical of many western populations, in these non-western origin groups the majority of women wish to be thinner than they are whereas most men do not seem to recognize their overweight. Raising awareness of weight status appears to be an important intervention goal although caution is advised when targeting women.

The model, now extending to over 2 million inhabitants in 127 French cities, 5 Spanish and 2 Belgian, consists of the strategic coordination at a national and local level of concrete initiatives fostering pleasant and balanced eating habits and greater physical activity in everyday life. These actions are delivered under the conductancy of a national coordination team using social marketing methods to coach and accompany a local project manager nominated by the mayor. This coordination implicates network organization techniques, continuous education, approaches relying on group dynamics and social policies modification, marketing towards health professionals, general public communication and press relations serving public health issues. Through the local team, this coordination enables to implicate the entire community (teachers, school catering, health professionals, parents, media\u2026) to become a vector within an obesity prevention strategy creating an environment that facilitates changes close to the family. Success to date is measured by a large field mobilization in the French pilot cities and by the encouraging evolution of the BMI of children. We will present the latest measurements concerning field mobilization in the French pilot cities and the encouraging evolution of the BMI of children. Background: Most of published cutoffs for body-fat location indices or BMI have been based on population distribution rather than health outcomes Objective: To evaluate the ability of anthropometric fat location indices and BMI of predicting clustering risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in children, in addition to defining their respective cutoffs. Method: A cross-sectional analysis of 901 Danish schoolchildren from 3 rd and 9 th grade who participated in the European Youth Heart Study was used. Children were considered to have clustering risk factors if, at least three of the following risk factors were present: high levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, blood pressure or %body-fat. The diagnostic accuracy for detecting clustering risk factors was evaluated through ROC analysis and cutoffs producing equal sensitivity and specificity; minimizing misclassifications and; corresponding to 85 th percentile of sex-and-age-specific distribution were derived. Results: Cutoffs producing equal sensitivity-and-specificity and minimizing misclassifications matched respectively the 75 th and 95 th percentiles of sex-and-agespecific distribution and the former produced significantly lower cutoffs than the latter. Specificity was markedly higher than sensitivity for all anthropometric indices and increased within cutoffs ( . Fat mass and fat free mass indexes were calculated by dividing fat mass (kg) and fat free mass (respectively) by height (m) squared. FMI and FFMI centile curves were generated using the LMS programme (version 2.0). For each 7 centile curves were calculated, from the 2 nd through to the 98 th spaced two-thirds of a z-score apart, (z=-2, -1.33, -0.67, 0, +0.67, +1.33, and +2) in the format used in other reference charts. The 85 th and 95 th centile were also calculated. These along with the 2 nd centile were used to generate health ranges for FMI and FFMI. FMI may be a more appropriate tool for assessing obesity than body size, or more useful than fat percentage as changes in both fat and lean components can be tracked. FMI has similarities to BMI improving understanding by clinicians and patients. However, to make it a useable tool reference values need to be established. This paper provides data that may contribute to the development of reference values across all ages. Funding: This study involves the use of a Tanita BC 418MA.

S197 T5:PS.70 Scientific and commercial interest in comparing satiety profiles of foods and ingredients is increasing. However, inconsistent and inappropriate statistical approaches can obscure correct interpretation of results. Several issues are particularly relevant. 1) Balancing treatment order to correct for carry-over effects: A Latin Square (where possible a 'Williams' design) should be used for cross-over trials. 2) Baseline correction: In randomized designs, baseline differences are a random effect. Even if differences are small, correction by the simple subtraction ('change from baseline') introduces artifactual differences (thus potentially artifactual significance) and also inflates variance (potential loss of power). This furthermore carries an implicit, rather improbable, assumption that the baseline differences have a fixed impact at all subsequent measurement points. As with other short-and long-term randomized clinical trial designs, use of baselines as covariates as standard practice is strongly recommended, regardless of the size (or significance) of baseline differences.",

We have compared several alternative approaches to define a method that allows for quantitative estimate and comparison of TTRTB amongst different foods.

This paper presents data collected from 266 men (19-84yrs) who visited MOTO service stations on motorway networks during the summer of 2007. Men were offered 'spare tyre checks' at a health check station making the data unusual in that it provides information from the general population and not those visiting clinicians. The subjects had a number of health indices measured including; body composition by BIA (Tanita BC-420MA), waist circumference. They were also asked a number of questions regarding their perceptions of themselves in matters of health. The subjects were found to be significantly (t (263) = 25.04, p<0.001) overweight (23.01 \u00b1 16.82 kg) and had a mean excess of 4.95\u00b1 16.82 kg of fat. Paired samples t-tests revealed significant differences between their guessed waist and their real waist measurement (t (263) =-18.69, p<0.001) with the average estimate being 3.4 \u00b13.7 inches under. As their waist circumference increased the men regarded their weight to be more important than waist circumference. Subjects were asked to categorise themselves in terms of their body composition. Of those with BMI's 30-35kg/m 2 89% underestimated their size, with 60% of those in the morbidly obese category of >35 kg/m 2 thinking that they were not obese. The differences between perception and reality that individuals have is likely to have an impact on the effectiveness of any education and intervention programme as they will deem the information or process the information more or less relevant to themselves. Background: Obesity rates among Emiratis have risen sharply over past decades with subsequent adverse health ramifications. Among possible contributors to these trends are lifestyle changes (e.g., eating away from home, passive TV/video entertainment). This paper aims to delineate potential connections among TV/video viewing, fastfood consumption, and BMI rates of young Emirati women. Methods: A stratified random sample of 125 high-school and 125 college female students completed a short version of the Youth Healthy Living Survey. Data were collected on sociodemographics, fastfood and fruit/vegetable consumption, TV/video exposure, type of programs viewed, physical activity, and psychosocial and spatial variables. Weight and height were used to compute BMI. Results: In the midst of a health transition with alarming NR-CD rates, this exploratory study constitutes the first in the Middle East to investigate relationships between consumption of fastfood, passive leisure, and obesity. While data collection is ongoing (anticipated to finish in 1/2008), partial data analysis indicates that: (a) eating has become more appealing while physical activity less so due to more fastfood availability and TV viewing; (b) links between amount/type of TV exposure and higher consumption of unhealthful foods are growing; and (c) both are leading to elevated obesity risks. Conclusions: Consumption of fastfood and TV/video viewing among young women in the UAE seems to have adverse effects on dietary quality in ways that plausibly could increase obesity risks. Findings would significantly help in the planning and implementation of health education and promotion programs.",

It is a positive, concrete and step-by-step apprenticeship of nutritional balance and physical activity. E is a behavior-centered approach, with an educational philosophy prompting fun and non-stigmatization of any food.

Grants from: Assureurs Pr\u00e9vention Sant\u00e9, Nestl\u00e9 France, Fondation Internationale Carrefour, EPODE Club des Partenaires Background: Are childhood obesity interventions effective? Two reviews of interventions preventing childhood overweight and obesity provide opposite answers. Summerbell et al, (2005) found relatively few effective interventions (15%) whereas Doak et al, (2006) review found a majority (71%) of interventions to be effective. Aim: To resolve discordant results on effectiveness of interventions. Methods: This study will compare differential inclusion and exclusion criteria, using as examples the most influential exclusion from each review. Finally, this study compares effectiveness by outcome. Results: A total of 36 studies were included by one or the other review, 10 of which were included in both reviews. Combining all 36 interventions showed 17 effective interventions (47%). The two most influential criteria were exclusion of interventions with a stated aim other than preventing weight gain (Summerbell et al, 2005) and excluding pilot studies (Doak et al, 2005) . The first exclusion reduces the effective interventions to 42% (13/31). In contrast, the second exclusion increases the proportion of effective interventions to 54% (17/31). However, outcome assessment shows key differences between skinfold and height/weight results. In these 36 interventions, 63% of interventions are effective by skinfolds whereas only 31% of the interventions are effective by height/weight measures. Conclusion: Interpretation of results depends more on how outcomes are assessed than on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Skinfolds show interventions are mostly effective, whereas outcomes with height/weight measures are not. These results illustrate the need for better measures for monitoring overweight and obesity in children. Background: Child weight and eating habits have been associated with children's temperament (Nederkoorn et al., 2005) , and also with exposure to excessive parental controls around feeding and food (Birch et al., 2003) . The aims of this study were to examine the relevant contribution of child temperament and parental control to predicting children's eating habits and BMI in a non clinical sample of 10 year old children. Method: 75 children (mean age 10.87 years) completed questionnaires about their temperament (Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire), parental controlling feeding practices (Kids Child Feeding Questionnaire), their BMI and their external eating, emotional eating and restrained eating (Dutch Eating behaviour Questionnaire).",

            "text": "Stepwise regressions were used to examine the most significant models to predict children's maladaptive eating styles and BMI. Using stepwise regressions parental restriction was a significant negative predictor of children's restrained eating, parental pressure to eat was a significant positive predictor of child BMI, child impulsiveness was a significant positive predictor of external eating, and child depression was a significant positive predictor of emotional eating. Conclusions: Maladaptive eating styles during childhood can be predicted by a combination of various temperamental traits and also by children's perceptions of parental pressure and control around feeding and food. Further research is necessary to evaluate how children's temperamental traits may interact with their caregivers feeding styles in the prediction of eating habits which may promote obesity. Objectives: To estimate the frequency of high risk people for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) according to body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) in the Spanish middle-aged general population. To estimate the frequency of unknown T2D and Glucose Intolerance (GI) in people with high risk of T2D. Methods: Population-based, cross-sectional epidemiological study in Central Spain. Random sample of 1.961 subjects 45-70 years selected from 6 public health registries. BMI, waist and hip circumferences were measured by trained nurses. Categorization of T2D risk with the FINDRISK SCORE (high risk>14 points). In high risk subjects, a standard 2-hour OGTT was performed to rule-out T2D or GI. Results: 57% women, mean age: 57.5+ 8 years. 585 subjects (29%)showed high risk of T2D (FINDRISK score >14). 32% were obese (BMI> 30) and 47% had an elevated waist circumference (>102 cm in males or >88 cm in females). In the general population (n=1961), 25% of males and 34% of females showed high risk of developing T2D. The FINDRISK mean scores and percent of subjects with high risk of T2D, increased significantly with BMI (Table 1a) and WC (Table 1b) in both, males and females (p<0.001 for all comparisons). high risk subjects (n=585): 17% had unknown T2DM, and 34% (GI or IFG). Frequencies of GI and T2D were respectively 28% and 25% in obese women, compared to 3.8% and 1.9% in normal women. 35% of high risk obese males had unknown T2D in the OGTT and 24% GI; corresponding figures for normal weight males were 2.7% and 1% respectively. Subjects with elevated WC shown higher significant rates of T2D and GI (48% and 44% in women vs. 35% and 40% in males) than people with normal WC. Conclusion: There is a substantial percentage of subjects with obesity and abdominal obesity in the middle aged general population of Spain. The risk of T2D is strongly associated to both BMI and WC in the general population. In T2D high risk people, the frequency of unknown T2D and GI is also strongly associated to BMI and WC in both males and females..",

In this study, associations were expected between food-related parenting, children's responses to food and satiety (i.e., eating behaviours), and child BMI. A new measure of three positive and three negative food-related parenting dimensions was developed based on a comprehensive parenting theory founded in Self-Determination Theory (Skinner et al., 2005) . The six dimensions of food-related parenting include warmth, structure, autonomy support, rejection, chaos, and coercion. Questionnaires were completed by parents (94% female) of 247 young children (M = 5.73 years, 50% female). Children's weight and height were measured at school. Factor analysis of the new measure revealed six factors; each had high internal consistency. Parenting was significantly associated with child eating behaviours, in the expected directions (rs ranging from |.13| to |.44|). The negative parenting dimensions were associated with the widest range of children's eating behaviours, with parental coercion the strongest correlate. The positive parenting dimensions were predominantly correlated with children's enjoyment of food (i.e., children's normal, healthy variation in appetite). Parents' own eating behaviours, and their weight and shape concerns were associated with parenting (rs from |.14| to |.34|), and child BMI was significantly associated with children's eating behaviours in the predicted directions (rs from |.18| to |.367|).",

Seven 'street-level' policy areas covering food and nutrition, physical activity, socioeconomic status and inequalities in obesity have been identified for a comparative evaluation in six countries from different European sub-regions. The present policy analysis aims to understand the processes through which these policy areas are developed and implemented, the aims and motives behind the policies, and the potential for improvement in terms of policy development and implementation processes. Work is organized around the preparation of a concept paper reviewing the existence and effectiveness of policy analysis tools in the health field, ways of analyzing the results and priority setting. The methodological conclusions of the concept paper will feed into the policy analysis tool development which will in turn be subjected to external evaluation by experts before being piloted in countries. The policy analysis tool is currently being developed and will be presented at the ECO 2008. ",

            "text": "The aim of the present study was to describe the association between duration of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), weight-gain in infancy and childhood body mass index (BMI) using two cohorts from Iceland and Denmark. Several metaanalysis have shown an effect of breastfeeding on later obesity, but most are from populations with short duration of EBF. Subjects and Methods: Breast-feeding status was reported monthly during infancy. Weight and length was measured at birth, 2, 6, and 12 months of age as well as in childhood at 6-or 10-years of age. Results: EBF for 2 months or less resulted in 350-400 g more weight gain from 2 to 6 months of age than EBF for 3-4 months (p=0.009) and 5 months (p=0.068). A trend of more weight gain from 6 to 12 months of age was similarly found with shorter EBF, i.e., EBF for 2 months or less gave the highest weight gain and EBF for 5 months or more the lowest. A greater weight change, in terms of Z-scores, between the age of 2 months to the age of 6 months, was associated with higher Z-score of childhood BMI (B=0.49\u00b10.11, p>0.001, adj. R 2 =0.15). Conclusions: Longer duration of EBF was associated with lower weight gain from 2 months of age throughout infancy. Weight gain in infancy was associated with higher childhood BMI. Exclusive breastfeeding may modulate growth rate in infancy and thereby possibly prevent excessive rise in childhood BMI, but other factors determinative for growth in infancy needs to be identified too. Funding: The collaboration which the present paper is based on is part of the Nordic longitudinal epidemiologic research program \"Prenatal and Childhood Growth in Relation to Cardiovascular Disease\" (the NordNet Study) is funded by NordForsk, the Nordic Research Board. The initial studies were supported by, The importance of the social determinants of health in the production of chronic disease has been well established in such seminal publications as the Lalonde report (1974), the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion (1986) and the Toronto Charter on the Social Determinants of Health (2003) . While theoretical advances in understanding these determinants have recently been described (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2005) , the interaction of the social determinants of health (income, education, social support, housing, food security, social exclusion, among others) with proximal risk factors for overweight and obesity (including physical activity, sedentary behaviours, nutritional markers and smoking and alcohol use) in a spatial context (health region and province of residence) has been considerably less developed. In the current study, multilevel logistic regression was used to predict the prevalence of overweight and obesity at regional and provincial levels, using data from three consecutive cycles of the Canadian Community Health Surveys (2001, 2003, 2005) . Significant social, behavioural and geographic effects were observed, after controlling for regional and provincial heterogeneity in overweight and obesity. The relevant knowledge transfer mechanisms for health and social welfare are described, with a particular emphasis on the utility of multilevel modelling for researchers and policymakers in Canada and abroad.",

Objective: to assess the prevalence of NWO in Switzerland according to different cut points used to define excess body fat. Design: cross-sectional study including 3,213 women and 2,912 men aged 35-75 years. Body fat was assessed by bioimpedance and prevalence of NWO was assessed using four previously published definitions for excess body fat. Results: % body fat increased with age: in men, the values (mean \u00b1 SD) were 20.2 \u00b1 5.4, 23.0 \u00b1 5.4, 26.3 \u00b1 5.2 and 28.2 \u00b1 4.6 for age groups [35 -44] , [45 -54] , [55 -64] and [65 -75] years, respectively; the corresponding values for women were 29.9 \u00b1 7.8, 33.1 \u00b1 7.4, 36.7 \u00b1 7.5 and 39.6 \u00b1 6.9. In men, prevalence of NWO was <1% irrespective of the definition used. Conversely, in women, a one to twenty fold difference (from 1.4% to 27.8%) in NWO prevalence was found. The prevalence of NWO increased with age when age-independent cut points were used in women, but not in men. Conclusions: prevalence of NWO is low in the general population and higher in women than in men. The prevalence is highly dependent on the criteria used to define excess body fat, namely in women. The use of gender-and age-specific cut points to define excess body fat is better than fixed or gender-specific only cut points.",

The purpose of this study was to test the accuracy of the Remote Food Photography Method (RFPM) for measuring food intake. The RFPM is a novel method that consists of digital cameraenabled cell phones with wireless data transfer capabilities. Photographs of food selection and plate waste are taken and transmitted to researchers for analysis. Methods: Participants (N=52, 20<BMI<35) were randomly assigned to a dine-in or takeout group. Food intake was measured for three days at lunch and dinner. The dine-in group ate lunch and dinner in the laboratory. The take-out group ate lunch in the laboratory and dinner in free-living conditions. The take-out group was given a cooler containing pre-weighed dinner (plate waste was weighed when the cooler was returned the following morning). Food intake was measured with the RFPM and by directly weighing foods. Food intake estimated with the RFPM was compared to directly weighed intake using Bland-Altman analyses. Results: Food intake estimated with the RFPM correlated highly with weighed intake in laboratory and free-living conditions (r's>.93, p<.0001). The RFPM underestimated food intake by -4.7% (p=.046) and -5.5% (p=.076) in the laboratory, and -6.6% (p=.017) in free-living conditions. Bias did not differ by food intake levels.",

The difference was most pronounced for cardiovascular (41% vs 15%, P<0.001) and musculo-skeletal (40% vs 23%, P<0.001) drugs. These differences were particularly due to beta blocking agents, lipid reducing agents, and agents acting on the reninangiotensin system, and use of anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic agents, respectively. The use of general anti-infectives was similar (28% vs 25%, P=0.48), and the use of drugs for the genito urinary system (17% vs 24%, P<0.001) was lower, in obese than in normal weight persons. Also overweight persons used more prescription drugs of almost all drug classes, but the differences were smaller than for obese persons Future research: We will also present data on the relation of use of prescription drugs and weight change in the preceding years. Introduction: Several previous studies have reported inverse associations between calcium intake and adiposity indices. We examined whether supplementation of calcium or dairy products enriched with calcium and vitamin D 3 in postmenopausal women for 12 months could induce favourable changes in several anthropometric and body composition indices. Materials and methods: A sample of 101 postmenopausal women were randomized to a dairy intervention group (DG: n=39), receiving approximately 1200 mg of calcium and 7.5 \u03bcg of vitamin D 3 per day via fortified dairy products and attending biweekly nutrition education sessions; a calcium supplemented group (CaG: n=26) receiving a total of 1200 mg calcium per day; and a control group who continued with their usual diet (CG: n=36). Results: No significant differences were observed in the mean 12-month changes in body weight, BMI, total body fat and lean mass between groups. However, subjects in the DG were found to have a lower decrease in mid-arm muscle circumference (P<0.001) and a lower increase in the sum of skinfolds' thickness (P=0.042) compared with the CaG and the CG. Furthermore the DG was also found to have a greater decrease in the percentage of legs' fat mass (P=0.025) and a higher increase in legs' lean mass (P=0.012) compared with the two other groups.",

Some studies displayed an inverse relationship between calcium intake and body weight or fat mass. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships of dairy consumption and/or calcium intake with 6-year changes in body weight and waist circumference (WC). Methods: Middle-aged French adults (1,022 women and 1,245 men) were divided into quartiles of dairy consumption and/or calcium intakes. Age-adjusted comparisons, stratified by sex and body weight status at baseline, were presented because of significant interactions. Multivariate analyses included additional adjustment for baseline outcome value and other potential dietary or behavioral confounders. Results: In men who were overweight at baseline, 6-y change in weight was bordeline inversely related to total dairy product consumption (from +2.45 kg for the lowest quartile to +1.61 kg for the highest quartile, p for trend <0.06). In particular, in overweight men, significant inverse trends were found between the changes in weight and waist circumference and the consumption of both milk and yogurt. But no relationship was observed with daily intakes of cheese and of total or dairy calcium. In women, only a positive association between 6-y weight change and yogurt consumption in normal-weight women was found. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the relationship of dairy products and calcium intake with changes in weight and waist circumference may differ according to sex, initial body weight status and type of dairy products. Funding: this research was supported by the French National Health Ministry (grant from the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Sant\u00e9).",

Background: It is well recognized that both genes and the environment are important determinants for obesity. Other risk factors include the psychosocial factors and early psycho-social exposures may be associated with obesity later in life. We examined associations between being bullied in school and being overweight or obese in adulthood Study design: In the Danish Twin Registry 144 pairs of twins (monozygotic as well as dizygotic) were discordant for obesity, i.e. one twin had a normal BMI (between 20 and 25 kg/m 2 ) and the other had a BMI over 30 kg/m 2 . The twins were invited to an interview about their experiences in childhood. Seven validated questionnaires were used and one of these included 13 questions about being bullied in primary school. The interviews were supplemented by physical measurements and blood samples.",

The participants who had been bullied had a BMI which was on average1.3kg/m 2 (p = 0.03) higher at the age of 20 years compared to those not bullied. A growth-curve analysis showed that this difference was sustained throughout life. Conclusion: It seems from the preliminary analysis that independent of other lifestyle and familial obesity, being bullied in childhood may be associated with overweight and obesity in adulthood. Background: Lifestyle interventions to tackle obesity still target areas of relative deprivation, but the evidence for doing so is largely historical. Aim: To examine the link between deprivation and obesity in contemporary UK children. Methods: 266 children (146 boys) from the EarlyBird Study, attending 53 primary schools in a mainly urban setting, covering a wide socio-economic range. Postcodebased Index of Multiple Deprivation (higher IMD score = greater deprivation). Mean IMD score of cohort was 21.7 (range 6.5-73.0), similar to UK mean of 26.3. Waist circumference, BMIsds, and sum of skinfolds at 5y and 8y.Results: BMI tended to be lower, rather than higher, in the more deprived boys at 5y (r=-0.17, p=0.05) and 8y (r=-0.14,p=0.09). Waist circumference was also inversely related to IMD score at 5y (r=-0.20, p=0.02) and 8y (r=-0.18, p=0.03). Boys' skinfolds were not significantly related to IMD score at either age (both p<0.20). There were no significant associations between IMD score and any measure of adiposity in girls (all r<0.07, all p>0.43). Similar findings were obtained using alternative measures of socioeconomic status including parental occupation and income. Importantly, changes in adiposity between 5y and 8y were unrelated to IMD (all r< 0.15, p> 0.10). Conclusion: Our data do not support the popular assumption that obesity is more prevalent among poorer children -indeed, there was statistically significant evidence to the contrary in the boys, making lack of power an unlikely cause. All socioeconomic groups now appear to be at risk of obesity, with important implications for health spending.",

Data were used of 3960 8-year-old children, participating in the Dutch PIAMA birth cohort study. Weight and height, measured by the investigators, were used to define weight status (underweight, normal weight, moderate overweight, obesity). The following parental reported outcomes were studied: a general health index, GP visits, school absenteeism due to illness, health-related functional limitations, doctor diagnosed respiratory infections and use of antibiotics. Multivariate regression modeling was used to assess the associations. Obesity was significantly associated with poorer general health, more GP visits, more school absenteeism, more health-related limitations, a higher incidence of bronchitis and more frequent use of antibiotics (adjusted odds ratios around 2.0 for most outcomes). The associations with flu/serious cold, ear infection and throat infection were also positive, but not statistically significant. For moderate overweight, the associations tended to be in the same direction, but they were weaker and for most outcomes not statistically significant. Underweight was associated with poorer general health and more health related limitations, but these associations seemed to be largely explained by parental perception and only to a lesser extent by actual illness. We conclude that childhood obesity is not merely a risk factor for disease in adulthood, but causes adverse health effects already in childhood. The high prevalence of the outcomes studied implies a high burden of disease in terms of absolute numbers of sick children. The delineation of correlates that explain dietary and physical activity trends will be invaluable to understanding risky behavioral patterns of Abu Dhabi youth and for evaluating school health promotion programs.",

Methods: 166,000 individuals (52% women) from 16 cross-sectional studies part of the Obesity in Asia Collaboration. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were derived to assess the ability of each anthropometric variable to discriminate those individuals with and without dyslipidemia and to estimate optimal cut points. Dyslipidemia was classified as either fasting triglycerides >= 2.3 mmol/L and/or total cholesterol >= 6.2 mmol/L or between 5.2 and 6.2 mmol/L with a total to high density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio > 5.0. Results: Measures of central obesity tended to be more strongly associated with dyslipidemia compared with BMI and the strength of the associations were similar in Asians compared with non-Asians. AUCs ranged from 0.64, for BMI and WHR, to 0.70, for WC and WHTR, indicating that there was little difference between the four measures of overweight at discriminating dyslipidemia. The optimal cut-points for the discrimination of dyslipidemia for each of the anthropometric variables varied by sex and ethnicity but were generally lower among Asians compared with non-Asians. For example, WC cut-points for Asian men and women were 83 and 78 cm respectively and the corresponding figures for non-Asians were 92 and 82 cm. Central body fat is an important marker of chronic diseases. The waist-to-rip ratio and abdominal circumference are utilized like predictors of risk because are strongly associated with visceral fat. However, these techniques not consider the height of the subject, this fact can produce bias in the results interpretation. Conicity index (CI) is another anthropometric measure having potential for predicting fat distribution and disease risk. This index is based upon the idea that the shape of the human body changes from that of a cylinder to that of a \"double cone\" with accumulation of fat around the waist. It has an expected theoretical range ( Methods: A total of 954 girls (37.7% European, 21.6% Pacific Island, 15.8% East Asian, 10.2% Maori, 9.6% South Asian, 5.0% Other) aged 11-15 years participated in this study. Percentage body fat (%BF) was obtained using hand-to-foot bioelectrical impedance analysis. Body size perceptions, diet/exercise behaviours, and pubertal status were assessed by questionnaire. Results: Overall, 23.4% of participants considered themselves to be 'overweight', while 68.6% and 8.0% were self-diagnosed as 'normal weight' and 'underweight', respectively. However, nearly half of the girls tested were trying to lose weight, suggesting a lack of accordance between weight perceptions and weight control practices in this age group. The proportion of girls who reported exercising in the last 30 days for weight maintenance/loss (50.2%) was significantly higher than those who modified their diet (28.2%; P < 0.05). While the probability of dieting and exercise practices was highest in girls self-diagnosed as overweight, only 55.9% of girls with a %BF < 85 th percentile correctly identified themselves as overweight. The interactions among %BF, overweight perceptions, and weight control practices were relatively consistent across ethnicities. Conclusions: Weight control practices are relatively common among adolescent girls who perceive themselves to be overweight, regardless of ethnic background. Nonetheless, a large proportion of girls with excess %BF did not recognise the condition, suggesting that initiatives for assisting girls to identify the indicators of overweight may be beneficial. Funding: Research relating to this abstract was funded by Sport and Recreation New Zealand and the Division of Sport and Recreation, Auckland University of Technology. The prevalence of overweight and obesity among children in Denmark is rising 2 , 7% of the girls and 5,5% of the boys between 5-7 years are overweight. The prevalence of obesity in this age group is 2 % for the girls and 1 % for the boys. 3 The reason for this increase is unknown, but foodand activity habits are assumed to play a major role. There is some evidence that the food-and activity habits of the children are formed early in life and are brought into adulthood 4,5 exactly as there seems to be a connection between the child's overweight from 3 years of age and overweight in adulthood 6 . The purpose of this project is to develop, implement and evaluate a method, which is structured, interdisciplinary and cross sectorial, which can be used in treatment on overweight children and their families in Ringkj\u00f8bing community. All children in Ringkj\u00f8bing community, who are found to be overweight based on age adjusted BMI 6 at the public health examine at the age 3-, 4-and 5 years by their own doctors are offered to participate in the project. The families are meeting with the practitioner team (dietician, physiotherapist, family consultant) in the Nutrition unit 3 weeks after receiving the reference. After 3 consultations (6-9 month from start) the children and theirs family have had change their food-and activity habits. The childrens bmi z-score is the same (73% of the children have a lower bmi and 27% have the same bmi or higher) as start the intervention. Next result: January 2008. Consumption of fast food has increased during the past twenty years, and a sedentary lifestyle has become more common. These are two major risk factors associated with the increase of overweight and obesity, which are found in all ages around the world. The aim of this study was to describe the lifeworld experience while increasing energy intake and simultaneously adopting a sedentary lifestyle for four weeks in healthy, normal-weight individuals. Twelve men and six women (median age 23, range 21-44 years) were prescribed a doubled energy intake in parallel with a maximum allowance of physical activity of 5000 steps per day. After completing this intervention the participants were interviewed and asked to describe their lifeworld experience during the prior four weeks. A phenomenological approach was used. Analyses of the transcripts were performed according to Giorgi. The essence of the phenomenon was resignation, emerging from five themes: Changed Body Shape, Togetherness, Management, Tiredness and Physical Impact. In conclusion, the high-energy diet and sedentary lifestyle influenced participants to experience resignation in their lifeworld. In spite of both physical and mental impact of the intervention, the participants felt indifferent and apathetic. .0001 and in 1990 it was 23.8 (2.9) kg/m 2 , p<0.0001. Prevalence of overweight in the present study was 28.7% whereas that of obesity was 10.3%. Overweight and obesity showed no correlation with the place of residence, however there was a significant positive correlation between overweight and higher education, and obesity and low educational level. Conclusions: Our study shows a positive secular trend for BMI in Greek conscripts in the last 16 years. It also shows a high prevalence of overweight and obesity among young Greek men.",

Objective: 1) To assess the current prevalence of childhood OW in France based on the recent national INCA-2 survey; 2) to compare these rates with the previous estimations from the INCA-1 study (1998-99) ; 3) to assess the relationship between OW and socio-economic status (SES). Design and subjects: Representative sample of French children aged 3-17 y (n=1455) from the 2006 cross-sectional French INCA-2 food consumption survey. Measurements: Weight and height were measured, food consumption was collected using a 7-day food record, physical activity and SES were reported by answering questionnaires. Results: According to the IOTF definition, 14.1% [11. 1-17.1], 15.3% [11.8-18.8], and 11.9% [8.7-15.1] of the children aged 3-10 y, 11-14 y, and 15-17 y, respectively, are OW (including obese).

Key words: Child obesity / France / Trend / Socio-economic status The development of a Healthy Eating Programme from initial pilot study to national roll-out is described. The pilot study evaluated the effectiveness of a programme (the Food Dudes Programme) in bringing about large and longlasting increases in primary school children's consumption of fruit and vegetables in Ireland, where school meals are not provided and children bring food to schools in lunchboxes. The extension of the programme to 99 primary schools followed by national roll-out is then described. In the pilot study (two schools, n= 400), the experimental school participated in the Healthy Eating Programme, which included video-based peer-modelling (the Food Dudes) and rewards for eating fruit and vegetables. In both experimental and control schools, provision and consumption of fruit and vegetables in children's lunchboxes was assessed at baseline, during intervention, and at 12-month follow-up. Results indicated that 12 months following the Food Dude intervention, children in the experimental school brought in and consumed significantly more fruit and vegetables compared to the control school (p < 0.001). In the subsequent roll-out of the intervention, questionnaire data on consumption were collected from parents and teachers in 75 schools. These indicated increased provision and consumption of fruit and vegetables, high enjoyment of the programme, and excellent buy-in from teachers and parents. It may be concluded that the Irish Schools Programme is highly effective in changing children's consumption of fruit and vegetables.

The aim of this paper is to explore whether variations in the obesogenic environment exist across the neighbourhoods of a major UK city. Method: Height and weight data for 3-13 year olds was used to calculate body mass index (standarised using the British reference dataset; obesity > 98 th centile). Microlevel obesogenic covariates were simulated from the Health Survey for England (2002) and the Expenditure and Food Survey (2005) . Univariate geographically weighted regression analyses were undertaken to identify the covariates with the strongest global relationships with obesity, any non-stationarity in the relationships, and the key local determinants of obesity. Results: There is considerable variation in obesity and obesogenic variables across Leeds. The covariates with the strongest global relationships with obesity were supermarket/leisure facilities' access, public transport, fruit and vegetable consumption, sedentary behaviour, household income and urbanisation. These covariates also showed a non-stationary relationship with obesity, meaning that the same stimulus provokes a different response in different parts of Leeds. The key local determinants of obesity were food expenditure, television ownership/internet access, neighbourhood safety, school meals and children's physical activity levels. Discussion: This paper shows that childhood obesity, and its determinants, are not uniform across Leeds, highlighting those areas where the key determinants are different locally to globally.",

Background: In a cross-European study it was recently shown that consumption of lean fish stimulates weight loss in men and has other positive health effects. Objective: To investigate whether lean fish (cod) consumption increases weight loss and diminishes cardiovascular risk in a dose dependent manner during an eight-week energy restriction in young overweight and obese, but otherwise apparently healthy adults. Design: In this dietary intervention 126 subjects (20-40 years, BMI 27.5-32.5 kg/m 2 ) were grouped to energy-restricted diets (-30%) prescribing identical macronutrient composition but different amounts of cod: group 1=control group, no seafood; group 2=150g cod 3x/week; and group 3=150g cod 5x/week. Anthropometric measurements and cardiovascular risk factors were assessed at baseline and endpoint. Results: Body weight decreased after eight weeks (5.0\u00b12.9kg, P<0.001), also waist circumference (5.0\u00b13.2cm, P<0.001), BMI (1.65\u00b10.95kg, P<0.001), systolic (3.4\u00b18.9mmHg, P=0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (2.4\u00b16.9mmHg, P<0.001), triglycerides (1.26\u00b10.567mmol/L, P=0.030) and insulin (1.21\u00b15.31mU/L, P=0.025). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome dropped from 29 to 21%. According to a multivariate analysis weight loss was 1.7 kg greater among subjects consuming 150g 5x/week compared to the control group (P<0.015). The trend analysis supported a dose-response relationship between cod consumption and weight loss (P<0.001), but changes of other measured cardiovascular risk factors were similar between the groups. Conclusions: A dose-response relationship between cod consumption and weight loss during an eight-week energy restriction is found and 5x150 g cod/week results in 1.7 kg greater weight loss in young overweight or obese adults than a isocaloric diet without seafood.

For that purpose a program was designed for each school grade (from 1 st to 6 th grades), with at least one weekly session in the classroom throughout the school-year, training for the teachers, didactic material and extracurricular activities carried out by volunteers. The study included a basic nutritional diagnosis of 327 teachers, ages 21 to 60 (24.6% males and 75.4% females), of 21 public schools of the north (Comarca Lagunera), center (Federal District and State of Mexico) and south (Tabasco) of Mexico that attended the training sessions and that gave their consent for the evaluation. Weight and stature measurements were carried out by standardized nutritionists using Lohman's techniques. Seventy six percent of teachers had overweight or obesity (BMI 25), 59% had central obesity (waist circumference > 88 cm in females and >102 cm in males), and 6% had high glycemia (> 126 mg/dL).

            "text": "Strongin, L, Petrov, A Nizhniy Novgorod State Medical Academy, Nizhniy Novgorod, Russia Aim: To determine the influence of obesity on life quality (HRQL) of diabetic patients with different duration of diabetes. Methods: 103 female diabetic patients were examined with BMI ranging normal to morbid obesity. HRQL was assessed using SF-36 questionnaire. Spirometry, echocardiography, 6-minute walk test (6-MWT) were performed to determine possible contributors to changes in HRQL. Patients with history of MI or stroke were excluded. Results: Patients without obesity (BMI <30, N = 40) had higher HRQL on physical component score scale than obese ones (PCS 39\u00b15,4 vs. 36\u00b16,2 points) due to the difference in physical activity (PA 57\u00b121.9 vs. 42\u00b122.4) and general health perception (35\u00b115.2 vs. 27\u00b115.3). HRQL on these scales negatively correlated with BMI, waist circumference and waist-hip ratio where correlation with waist circumference was the strongest. PCS score correlation with these variables remained significant and became stronger in patients with duration of diabetes less than10 years as well as differences between non-obese and obese groups increased (PCS 41\u00b15.3 vs. 36\u00b16.5, PA 63\u00b123.2 vs. 41\u00b122.4). In duration of diabetes of more than 10 years there was no difference between non-obese and obese groups and no significant correlation of HRQL with obesity. Physical HRQL correlated with 6-MWT distance, severity of neuropathy and nephropathy, severity of CHF and stable angina, duration of hypertension and some spirometric and echocardiographic measurements. Conclusion: Obesity leads to deterioration of HRQL in patients with diabetes decreasing physical activity component. Its influence is the greatest in short duration of diabetes and diminishes with the progression of diabetes. Health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) has been shown in a number of recent studies to be lower in overweight and obese children compared to normal-weight controls. However, investigations of variables mediating this association are rare, although there is preliminary evidence that psychological factors play an important role. We have shown in previous studies that body dissatisfaction is associated with dieting behaviour independent of BMI. The current study used a path analytical approach in predicting HR-QoL in 8-10 year old school children. A sample of 428 children (52% girls, 23% overweight and obese) participated in a crosssectional survey assessing BMI, body dissatisfaction and dieting behaviour. BMI was significantly associated with body dissatisfaction and dieting behaviour. Body dissatisfaction was negatively related to HR-QoL and this effect was mediated by dieting behaviour. Gender had no effect on any of these parameters. The results suggest that a negative body image and dieting behaviour mediate the relationship between BMI and poor HR-QoL. Given that these factors are established risk factors for eating disorders these results are of concern, particularly in children of such a young age. The World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe is establishing a European-wide standardized childhood obesity surveillance system which will monitor the effectiveness of the policy response to the emerging obesity epidemic. The system will be designed to measure routinely the trends in overweight and obesity in a national sample of primary schoolchildren aged 6-9 years. The aim is to have a correct understanding of the epidemic's progress in this population group and to allow intercountry comparisons within the WHO European Region. The first data collection round is planned to take place during the school year 2007/2008 in some countries in the Region and thereafter repeated at a two-year-interval. Core measurements will be body weight and body height; optional will be waist-and hip circumferences as well as associated comorbidities, dietary intake and physical activity/inactivity patterns. The anthropometric measurements will be done in schools by examiners who will be trained and standardized. Although each country is free to develop a system that fits their local circumstances it is imperative that data are collected according to a common agreed protocol and that they contain the stipulated core elements. The system is designed as simple as possible and should not demand a major investment of public resources. There is no intention to replace existing country's health, anthropometry and dietary surveillance systems already ongoing or in the planning, on the contrary, the system should if possible be integrated with them.",

Objectives: BMI evaluation, according to overweight and obesity classes, and new criteria recently proposed. Material e Methods: Patients from Portuguese Institute of Rheumatology followed for 2 months. BMI, fat mass(FM) and abdominal perimeter(AP) were evaluated. Population composed by 511 patients with RA, 792 with osteoarthritis(OA) and a control group with 379 individuals (no rheumatologic diseases). All groups were analysed by gender, current BMI and suggested in recent studies (BMI\u202223Kg/m 2 -overweight and BMI 28Kg/m 2 -obesity). Results: Most men were overweight (approximately 50%) and OA men were more obese. RA and OA women were similar in overweight compared to control. In obesity, OA women were more obese than the other groups. According to new criteria for RA, we have more 16,5% overweight men and 16,2% obese women, both with alterations in body composition and AP. Conclusion: RA population has a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity when compared to controls. According to proposed criteria, a higher number of RA patients have an increased cardiovascular risk disease. In the studied intervals, overweight and obesity prevalence is similar in women with RA when compared with the other two populations, which suggest that BMI redefinition could be revised to other groups 1 Redefining overweight and obesity in rheumatoid arthritis patients, Ann Rheum Dis 2007;66:1316-132",

Therefore, we investigated the effect of whole grain (WG) breakfast cereals on satiety and short-term food intake. Methods: In a randomized crossover design, two commercially available chocolate-flavored WG (32%) breakfast cereals (WGA and WGB, 30g), a refined chocolate-flavored breakfast cereal (0% WG, 30g) and a water control (400ml) were administered to thirty-two healthy adults (12 men) after an overnight fast. The isocaloric cereals were served with 125 ml of milk (2.5 % fat) and 250ml water. Subjective feelings of satiety were measured using validated visual analogue scales at 15min intervals before and after eating. Ad libitum food intake was measured 2 hrs later. Satiety was assessed with a composite score for satiety (CSS), averaging fullness and the inverse of hunger, desire to eat and prospective consumption. Results: All cereals resulted in higher satiety ratings compared with water (Mean CSS \u00b1 SEM, mm\u00b7min: over 2hrs, 6535 \u00b1 474; 6883 \u00b1 451; 6529 \u00b1 444; 3545 \u00b1 319 respectively, P < 0.0001). There was no difference in food intake between refined cereals and water, however, energy intake was lower after WGA and WGB cereals combined (Mean \u00b1 SEM, kcal: 483.0 \u00b1 37.3; 465.3 \u00b1 35.5 respectively) compared with water (513.5 \u00b1 34.1, P = 0.02). Conclusions: Consumption of 32% WG breakfast cereals is associated with better energy compensation 2hrs later compared with refined cereal, helping explain the protective effect of whole grains on obesity.",

The dominant notion is that child overweight is largely caused by poor diets, inactive lifestyle and genetic factors. Little research has been done from the perspective of the 'experts', the overweight children, themselves. Children also have the potential ability to negotiate their own meanings of being fat and construct their own strategies to deal with it. Methods: We used purposive sampling and studied 8 children with overweight aged 8-12 years (mean BMI: 27 (range 25-31), mean age: 10 years). All children participated at a 12 months outpatient treatment program. We used an exploratory and descriptive study design and data was analysed according to qualitative data analysis to identify emergent themes. Children's experiences and perceptions of body size and their strategies were explored using semi-structured in-depth interviews, drawings and a photographic visual exercise.",

            "text": "The studied overweight children experience being fat as a social problem and not as a medical or health problem. They feel stigmatised by the encountered discrimination but also because of the shame of being fat and fear of additional unacceptability. They internalise the health message that overweight is due to eating too much and therefore predominantly blame them selves for being fat. Making friends and being part of a group are extremely important themes in their daily lives and help them preserve a positive identity, to cope with the stigma of being fat and to control their body size. Macrosomia is associated with a high rate of obesity in children. Obesity and overweight affecting children is becoming increasingly important on a global scale. Gestational diabetes mellitus is associated with macrosomia and childhood obesity. Childhood obesity may persist into adulthood as a critical public health threat. The aim of this large scaled investigation is to determine the incidence, risk factors, characteristic features, and perinatal outcome of the macrosomic infants. This is a prospective survey carried out on a total of 6385 newborns. All measurements were taken by the senior pediatrician. Maternal age, blood group, parity, gestational age and type of delivery were also recorded. respectively. Statistically significant decreases were observed in control group. No significant difference was observed between the values of females and males. Blood group A was the most frequently observed type, however, blood group O was dominant in cases with gestational diabetes mellitus. The incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus was 0.6% in control group while this value was calculated as 4.8% among macrosomic births. Macrosomia is associated with adverse perinatal outcome, maternal/neonatal morbidity and obesity strongly associated with severe diseases leading to lifethreatening events in childhood. Therefore, it is important to emphasize the management of macrosomic infants and to consider the characteristic features related to macrosomic births.",

Feeding practices which are forceful have also been shown to predict food refusal in adulthood (Batsell et al., 2002) , however, there is a dearth of research exploring the impact of recollections of other controlling feeding practices upon adults eating practices. The aims of this study were to establish whether students' and their parents' recollections of parental use of controlling feeding practices during childhood predict present students' eating habits and weight. Method: 102 students and their parents completed questionnaires assessing their recollections of childhood feeding practices, Body Mass Index (BMI), and present eating styles. Results: Parents' and students' recollections of controlling feeding practices were significantly, positively correlated. Parental reports of using more restriction were significantly positively correlated with students' reports of external eating, emotional eating, and negatively with their intuitive eating. Students' recollections of experiencing more monitoring and restriction during childhood were negatively correlated with their present intuitive eating. Students' and parents' recollections of feeding practices were not significantly correlated with students' present BMI. Summary: Although the relationships differ when using parent and child report, both parents' and students' recollections of child exposure to controlling feeding practices are associated with students reports of eating practices as adults. These findings suggest that feeding practices used by parents may have long-term influences on eating behaviour, particularly self-regulation, in their children.",

The aim of this study was to assess obesity prevalence and dietary intake in schoolchildren in public and private primary schools in Greece and to examine the potential differences in anthropometric and dietary data. Methodology: A total of 580 children aged 8-12y, from public schools (124 girls and 125 boys), and private schools (151 girls and 180 boys) randomly selected, participated in the study. Anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist and hip circumferences and 5 skinfolds) were obtained from all children. Body fat was estimated according to Slaughter et al. equations (1988) . Cole et al (2000) criteria were used for BMI classification. Dietary intake was assessed using 24-hour recall and weekly food frequency questionnaire. Energy expenditure was also assessed using a validated questionnaire. Results: According to the results, a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity was found in public primary schools compared to private ones. In public schools: 28.0% of the boys and 22.4% of the girls were overweight and a further 12.8% of boys and 12.1% of girls were obese versus private schools: 26% of the boys and 21.2% of the girls were overweight and 5.3% of the boys and 5.3% of the girls were obese.

WHR was significantly lower for girls from private schools (0.80\u00b10.06) compared to girls from public schools (0.82\u00b10.05), p<0.05. There were no statistically significant differences in energy or nutrient intakes between children of public and private schools, but children in private schools had a higher energy expenditure (spent more hours in sports). Conclusion: In conclusion, the prevalence of obesity was found lower in children of private schools in Greece that can be attributed to their higher socio-economic status. Effective intervention programs for childhood obesity should take this factor into account.",

The current study aimed to examine whether mothers' and fathers' reports of their child's temperament were associated with the obesogenic eating behaviours that they reported their child to engage in. Method: Fifty-eight mother-father pairs of young children (mean age 39 months) completed self-report measures of their children's temperament and eating behaviours. The parents also provided data on their child's height and weight. Associations between children's temperament and eating behaviours were considered separately for mothers' and fathers' reports. Results: Where fathers reported that their children were more emotional, they also reported that their children tended to eat more in response to emotions and were more responsive to satiety cues. Fathers also reported that active children were less responsive to food. Mothers who reported their child to be less shy and more sociable also reported that their child enjoyed food more. Greater responsiveness to internal satiety cues was evidenced in children whose mothers considered them to be more shy and emotional. Conclusions: These data suggest a link between temperament and children's ability to regulate their food intake. That temperamentally less active children were perceived as more responsive to food may be an important step in our understanding of children's external eating.",

            "text": "The long-term trend of obesity in Finnish adults Obesity is an increasing public health problem globally. In more affluent countries, obesity is not only common in the middle-aged and elderly, but it is also becoming common among younger population. We have investigated the long-term trends and recent changes (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) in body mass index (BMI) in Finnish adults by age and education. The weight and height of Finns have been monitored regularly every five years in cross-sectional population surveys. The study population consists of over 30 000 men and women aged 25 to 64 years. The mean BMI has increased from 26.2 to 27.2 kg/m 2 in men, and from 25.8 to 26.8 kg/m 2 in women between 1982 and 2007. Simultaneously, the proportion of subjects with BMI 30 has increased from 15% to 21% in men, and from 17% to 20% in women. It seems that the mean BMI for men has also increased during the last five year, but the increase may have leveled off among women. Young birth cohorts (under 45 years) were more obese than the same birth cohorts earlier, but the increase was leveled off among the older birth cohort. The differences in BMI between education groups have remained, especially in women. Well-educated subjects had the lowest BMI. The results suggest that the long-term increasing trend of obesity may have leveled off in Finnish women. The differences in BMI between educational groups are still high, and the BMI has increased in younger adults. The results need to be confirmed in the next survey in 2012. Background: Few data is available on long-term secular trends in height and weight in children in countries in transition. We assessed the secular trends in height and weight among representative samples of children and adolescents from the Seychelles (African region). Methods: Weight and height data from all students of all schools in four selected school grades (kindergarten, 4 th , 7 th and 10 th years) were collected by cross-sectional surveys for periods 1998-9 (3,676 boys, 3,715 girls) and 2005-6 (4,867 boys, 4,846 girls). Data from 1956-7 was extracted from a previously published report. Results: Height increased, in boys, by 1.6 cm/decade for the period 1956-7 to 1998-9, and 1.1 cm/decade for the period 1998-8 to 2005-6; in girls, the corresponding figures were 0.9 cm/decade and 1.8 cm/decade. At age 15.5 years, boys/girls were taller by 10/13 cm in 2005-6 than in 1956-7. Weight increased, in boys, by 1.4 kg/decade for the period 1956-7 to 1998-9, and by 2.2 kg/decade for the subsequent period; the corresponding figures in girls were 1.1 kg/decade and 2.5 kg/decade. Conclusion: Marked upward secular trends in body height and weight were documented in children and adolescents aged <16 years in the Seychelles, consistent with large changes in socio-economic and nutritional indicators in the considered 50year interval. However, indirect evidence suggests that the secular height gain reflects accelerated growth during childhood over time with less than commensurate impact on adult height. Conversely, the largely steeper secular increase in weight than height is consistent with a pediatric obesity epidemic.",

Compared with low Mediterranean diet adherers, children with high KIDMED score were 80% less likely to be OW/OB [95%CI (0.041-0.976)], adjusted for age, gender, parental obesity status, parental educational level, as well as, dietary beliefs and behaviours. When physical activity was taken into account however, the aforementioned relationship was not significant [OR=0.20 95%CI (0.021-1.86)]. Furthermore, male gender, maternal obesity, and dietary beliefs and behaviours emerged as more significant in predicting obesity in children, compared to their KIDMED score. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet is inversely associated with obesity in children; however other behaviours, and in particular physical activity, seem to be more influential.",

In Romania, data about their prevalence are few. The aim of our screening was to evaluate overweight and obesity's prevalence among adolescents and to establish if there are particular aspects between these clinical conditions and other cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension, dyslipidemia, physical activity and nutrition Methods: The study sample included 721 students 390(54,1%) girls and 331(49,5%) boys aged between 15-19 years from a high school in Oradea, Romania .For all adolescents we determined: weight, height, blood pressure and cholesterol's level. They were also invited to answer a questionnaire about lifestyle (physical activity, nutrition, smoking). In overweight and obese adolescents were determined blood level for: HDL-cholesterol, LDLcholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose and insulin. Same blood parameters were determined for 80 normoponderals subjects. Results: General prevalence for overweight was 8% without difference between boys and girls(9,5% versus 9%).Obesity's prevalence was 4,9% with a significant difference between boys-7,4% and girls-4,1%(p<0,001).Hypertension's prevalence is double in those who are overweight or obese comparing to normoponderals.(19,4% versus 8,8%).Comparing with normoponderals in overweight and obese teenagers are significant differences in blood level for: triglycerides(88,0\u00b19,4 mg/dl versus 122,2\u00b113,7 mg/dl p< 0,01), LDL-cholesterol(76,8\u00b18,7 versus 118,2\u00b113,3 mg/dl p<0,01) and HDLcholesterol(33,3\u00b16,2 mg/dl p<0,05).there were no differences in blood level for insulin, fasting glucose and total cholesterol. Overweight and obese adolescents were physically inactive and had a bad nutrition with a low intake of fruits and vegetables and a great intake ob snacks, cookies, beverages and saturated lipids. Conclusions: 1.Among Romanian adolescents overweight and obesity are highly prevalent. 2.From adolescence, in an important number of cases overweight and obesity are clinical condition strongly associated with cardiovascular risk factors. 3.Our results are an alarm signal for the health status in this age. So, it is mandatory to start obesity's prevention as early as we can.",

Material and Methods: 517 obese patients (BMI 35 \u00b1 5 kg/m 2 ) took part in weekly patient classes for 10 weeks. Information was provided on how to separate as far as possible fat and carbohydrates in the diet, nutritional behaviour, physical activity and psychological background of obesity. Participants were asked to follow a very low-fat diet for breakfast and lunch, and after an interval of 4 hours switch to a very low-carb diet for dinner, and take two snacks per day (FaCts=Fat, Carbohydrate, timed snacks). Thereafter participants were offered monthly visits for 6 months; follow-up examinations were done for 7 years. Results: Out of 517 participants 74 did not complete patient classes. According to intention-to-treat-analyses the BMI changed to 32 \u00b1 5 kg within 10 weeks. Weight reduction after 1 and 7 years ranged from 6.5 \u00b1 6.1 kg to 5.5 \u00b1 5.1 kg (mean \u00b1 SD). Dietary protocols attested the participants a balanced diet and laboratory findings revealed an improvement of metabolic parameters. The participants of the FaCts-diet lost more weight compared to participants of a low-fat diet and the same amount of weight compared to a low-carb diet. Summary: FaCts-diet is an easy to learn and more balanced nutrition, as compared to low-fat or low-carb diets, and improves long-term weight reduction and obesity associated risks. Background: In a national study in 2002, the prevalence of childhood overweight in Switzerland was estimated to be nearly 20%. Since then, a number of school-and community-based public health programs have been put in place in an effort to reduce this high prevalence. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the national prevalence of childhood overweight in Switzerland in 2007, and make comparisons to the 2002 data, to determine if these public health programs have had an impact. Study design: A 3-stage, probability-proportionate-to-size cluster sampling of primary schools (n= 56) was used to obtain a representative sample of 6 to 13 year old children, as in 2002. Weight, height, four skinfold thicknesses and waist circumference were recorded. Body mass index and body fat percentage were then calculated and compared to data in 2002.",

Compared to the data from 2002, the prevalence of overweight has decreased 3.8% in boys and 6.1% in girls. Mean body fat percentage of boys (18.6%) and girls (20.9%) in 2007 was similar to that in 2002. Conclusion: The national prevalence of childhood overweight appears to have decreased in Switzerland over the past 5 years. This is likely due to public health campaigns to increase awareness of the problem and a positive impact of the intervention programs set-up across the country.

Material and methods: in a double-blinded placebo-controlled crossover human trial 12 healthy volunteers (using power analysis at the 40 g dosis) consumed various doses (0, 10, 20 or 40 grams) of EmulGold or PreVitae dissolved in water after a standardized breakfast. During three hours they were asked about various aspects of satiety (VAS: visual analogue scale) and after 3 hrs they were allowed to consume an ad libitum lunch, at which the caloric intake was measured. Results: within the three hours all doses of Arabic gum yielded significantly higher satiety perception than water. Interestingly, at 40 grams doses EmulGold obtained significantly (p< 0.01) higher levels than PreVitae. However, the slope of the curve of the latter revealed a longer lasting effect than obtained for the former. With respect to the energy intake a lower intake (110 to 220 kcal) was noted for all doses tested, being significant (p < 0.03) for both blends at the 40 g level, with PreVitae significantly (p < 0.03) lower than EmulGold. Conclusions: EmulGold and PreVitae establish a significant satiety perception for at least 3 hrs after consumption. This is accompanied by a lower energy intake, being significant at the 40 grams level. Therefore, both gums can be used in concepts to support body weight management.",

LazyTown's vision is to become a leading brand for healthy choices. LazyTown food and beverages will soon be introduced in Iceland, a product development brought forth by collaboration between the food industry, Unit for Nutrition Research, retrailers and LazyTown. The goal is to market a wide variety of healthy food for children, in appropriate portion sizes. The first products will be launched in January 2008 and will be available in retrailers in Iceland. The project \"LazyTown Kids Health Initiative -Motivating children to eat healthier food\" is a novel approach in the public health sector using a popular brand to increase availability of healthy food and promote healthy eating habits among children. A baseline study on dietary habits of 3-and 5-year-old children (n=460) was conducted in the Reykjavik area from January 2007-July 2007. Consumption of vegetables was on average 32\u00b132 g/day and 44\u00b140 g/day, and intake of fresh fruit 107\u00b169 g/day and 109\u00b175 g/day among 3-and 5-year olds, respectively. Average consumption of soft drinks and other sweetened drinks was 61\u00b193 g/day and 87\u00b1103 g/day. An endpoint study where any possible effects of the LazyTown introduction will be evaluated is planned in year 2009. Several smaller studies are planned in relation to the project, including taste preference tests, attitude surveys among parents, market research and cost effectiveness analyses. Other health related initiatives in Iceland during the study period will be recorded. Conflict of interest: None disclosed. Unit for Nutrition Research, or individual researches at the institute, will not receive any funding or salary from LazyTown, the food industry or retrailers.

Over the past fifteen years a learning programme has been developed that greatly increases children's consumption of fruit and vegetables. The innovative programme, which uses video heroes (the Food Dudes) and small rewards to influence children to taste the foods, has been put to test in homes, schools and nursery settings. The present paper outlines the results of a series of studies that investigate a whole-school version of the Food Dudes programme, designed to be effective across the age range of any primary school (i.e., 4-11 years) and to be implemented by school staff.

Each student was also measured each hour between 7:00 and 22:00. Statistical analysis was conducted using a general linear model for repeated measurements. Results: the correlation between first and second measurements was very high (Pearson r between 0.985 and 1.000, p<0.001), as well as the correlation between devices (Pearson r between 0.986 and 0.999, all p<0.001). Repeated measurements analysis showed no differences were between devices (F test=0.83, p=0.59) or readings (first vs. second: F test=0.12, p=0.74).

In the researcher's lived experience, indigenous communities interpret obesity as a sign of affluence and of being well fed. What appeals to the public eye regarding obesity vary with cultures and with time. Obesity has reached epidemic levels worldwide. The World Health Organization reported that Southern African countries are particularly affected by this epidemic. There is a discrepancy between perceived and actual weight with most black people accepting bigger bodies as a normal weight. The purpose of the study was to assess the meaning of obesity from a cultural perspective. Also included was to determine how the understanding of obesity influenced the national health strategy to reduce obesity in Thulamela Vhembe district. An exploratory survey study was done using self-report as data gathering method. Data were collected using a questionnaire and focus groups from community members in Thulamela. The data were analysed through descriptive statistics and content analysis. The results indicate that the community members, including health care workers, have a total lack of risk perception in terms of obesity and that any invention to reduce weight should be multi-facetted and must include raising awareness of risks related to obesity. Conclusion: Obesity interventions are challenging and without understanding the full scope of the problem, interventions are bound to fail. A multi-disciplinary and community-specific approach should be used. 1. Conflict of Interest: None Disclosed 2.

Prevention of obesity and overweight is receiving growing attention. GPs attitudes towards obesity prevention are not well documented. After gaining ethical approval, a postal survey of all GP registrars and GP trainers throughout Scotland was undertaken in 2006/2007.

Additionally, the final section sought free text comments. The overall response rate was 51.8%. Doctors from 102 or 9.3% of all Scottish practices responded.

We were interested in the relationship of an increase in Body Mass Index (BMI) during the 6 th age decade of life to dietary regimens, smoking, physical acitivity, as well as to cardiovascular and metabolic disease. Methods: During a period of 2 years 665 patients in the 6 th age decade attended our medical center. 457 of them (age 52.4\u00b118.0 years) revealed a BMI of 20-24.0 kg/m 2 , 208 (age 59.4\u00b114.0 years) a BMI of 25 kg/m 2 . 108 of all of the patients revealed an increase in BMI. A questionnaire about nutrition and physical activity in daily life was part of the routinely performed clinical and laboratory measurements at the initial visit, as well as the smoking status. Results: Patients with an increase in BMI revealed an increase in the number of cardiovascular and metabolic diagnosis from 1.9 in each patient to 2.9 within the observation period. This was paralleled by an increase in blood pressure values and fasting glucose levels, and a worsening of dyslipidemia. 51% of these patients reported to be physically inactive with less then 2.5 hours of activity per week. 43% were active smokers. Compared to patients with stable BMI patients with an increase in BMI showed a higher intake of alcoholic and soft drinks, as well as carbohydrates with high glycemic index, but no difference in fat intake. Conclusion: Life-style recommendations including a more detailed information about the intake of carbohydrates should be offered to the middle-aged population. It is widely acknowledged that the origins of obesity extend beyond individual behaviour to encompass obesogenic environments. This research aimed to understand decision-making on childhood obesity in Latvia and Denmark. Traditional risk analysis was expanded to take into consideration socioeconomic, political, and other non-scientific factors ('framing assumptions'). Stakeholder analysis was used to assess the positions taken and influence held by different stakeholders with regard to soft drink consumption as a risk factor for childhood obesity, and to capture important framing assumptions when analysing the response to soft drink consumption and childhood obesity in each country. The framing assumptions included issues such as the dynamics of stakeholder relations and the perceived legitimacy of State action; the implications of public-private alliances and politico-economic transition; issues around childhood obesity, such as the extent to which it is on the public agenda; and issues around soft drink consumption, such as the perceived role and effectiveness of a soft drink tax and the sales of soft drinks in schools. Building a mechanism to analyse risk will help recognise and address framing assumptions and the various parameters respective to each country, thereby contributing to the global effort to curb the obesity epidemic and associated conditions. Background & Aims: A weight gain during pregnancy that is more than the upper limits recommended is associated with postpartum weight retention and overweight/obesity in later life. Assessing the weight gain in pregnant women and its related factors can contribute to the prevention of overweight and obesity as major risk factors of non-communicable disease.",

            "text": "This study was a descriptive-analytical study with quota sampling based on the aim. The sample size were determined 265 pregnant women as clients of prenatal care clinics of Shaheed Beheshti University of Medical Sciences based on number of daily clients of each hospital. Instrument for data gathering was a questionnaire including demographic, personal, socio-economic data and pregnancy history which was completed by expert interviewers through structured interviews. Mothers' height and weight were measured and BMI (Body mass index) were computed. Pre-pregnancy weight was obtained from the historical files. Statistical analysis was done by using SPSS, Chi-squared, student and paired t-test, pearson correlation and logistic regression. Findings: Most of the studied population (69.5%) was in 20 -30 years old age group, were housewives (83.4%), had diploma (49.1%) and experienced their first pregnancy (47.6%). More than half of them were normal weight, 17% were underweight, 17% were overweight, and 12.8% were obese. Mean of weight gain based on gestational age was not different from recommended level. However, mean of weight gain in overweight (9.97\u00b16.06 vs. 6.63\u00b11.47kg, p<0.001) and obese (9.61\u00b16.35 vs. 6.0kg, p<0.01) groups was significantly higher than recommended level. Weight gain in pregnant women was correlated with extent of house (r=0.13, p<0.05) and monthly income (r=0.18, p<0.01). Pre-pregnancy weight status was correlated with age (p<0.01), education, pregnancy times, number of children, time interval between two pregnancies, family size and occupation of husband (p<0.05). Logistic regression showed that overweight/obesity decreased 0.14 times with employment of mother (CI: 0.05-0.36, p<0.001) and increased 1.29 times with age (CI: 1.14-1.47, p<0.001). Conclusion: Monitoring weight gain during pregnancy, healthy eating recommendations and informing about the proper weight gain are the main strategies for preventing post partum overweight/obesity especially in obese and older women. The objective is to curb the progression of childhood obesity through a methodology that establishes prevention at the heart of the city networks, mobilizing local stakeholders and empowering families and individuals in a sustainable way. This approach is set up in 150 cities in 3 European countries. Success to date is measured by a large field mobilization in the pilot cities and by the encouraging evolution of the BMI of children. The EPODE European Network (EEN) is designed to bring together expertise in the design, delivery and evaluation of similar community based intervention projects. The Network, created and coordinated by the EEN Team, is structured around a board and four committees concerning scientific evaluation and dissemination, public/private partnership, political involvement and social marketing techniques. This 3-years pan European program should particularly lead to various communications and publications in peer reviews leading to the production of a final methodology book to be used for the implementation of EPODE-like programs in other European countries. The objective is also to stimulate relevant stakeholders -i.e. political representatives, city and regional structures, national public health agencies, private stakeholders -to commit themselves in implementing effective local strategies and thus contributing to the EU vision of a multi-stakeholder partnership united in its determination to improve diet and activity habits and to prevent obesity and other chronic diseases. The EEN project will particularly work on building the legal and ethical framework of the public/private partnership.

This economic boom has also led to the development of new dietary habits typical of so-called First World societies, which are largely replacing traditional regional diets.

In Switzerland, 17% of boys and 19% of girls six to twelve years old are overweight, and 4% are obese. Schoolbased programs aiming to prevent obesity in children and adolescents are based on behavior changes related to healthier eating habits and more physical activity. Successful programs are often from Anglo-Saxon countries and we don't know how applicable they are in the Swiss context. As the Canton de Vaud is developing a program for the promotion of physical activity and healthy eating, the objective of this study is to assess the school stakeholders' perception about the acceptability and feasibility of obesity prevention strategies that could be implemented in schools, and to identify alternative strategies that these actors would propose. Participants will be recruited in several schools in Canton de Vaud (Switzerland) between October and December 2007. Focus groups including 6 to 10 people will be organized with 1) school directors, 2) teachers and physical education teachers, 3) people linked to school restaurants, 4) school doctors and nurses and health teachers, 5) parents of young adolescents (11-12 years old), and 6) young adolescents (11-12 years old).

The aim of this study was to determine the breakfast frequency and the fruits and vegetables consumption in adolescents. Male (n = 1390) and female (n = 3610) adolescents aged 12 to 15 years completed a short questionnaire concerning their eating habits. Data were operationalized in: never having breakfast versus one or more breakfast(s) a week, never eating fruits versus one or more portion(s) a day and never eating vegetables versus one or more portion(s) a day. Educational system was stratified in general versus technical/occupational system. 13.9% (n = 510) of the adolescents following general educational system never consumed a breakfast, compared with 25.9% (n = 265) in technical/occupational system (chi 2 with one df = 82.98; p<0.001). Respectively 21.7% (n =773) and 18.4% (n = 695) of the adolescents in general education never consumed fruits or never consumed vegetables, compared with 30.4% (n = 314) and 29.7% (n =332) of the adolescents from technical/occupational education (chi 2 with one df=33.15; p<0.001 for fruits and chi 2 with one df = 65.67; p<0.001 for vegetables). Breakfast frequency is lower and intake of fruits and vegetables are less frequent among adolescents of lower educational systems compared with adolescents of higher educational systems. Interventions aiming to improve eating habits of adolescents should focalize on lower educational levels, using appropriate instruction material. Introduction: During free-living unconstrained walking, the gait parameters (GP), such as walking speed, step frequency (SF) and step length (SL), are influenced by various environmental conditions. In this study we explored body oscillations in 3 axes and determined GP of overweight women while walking at different slopes. Methods: 23 control (C) (60\u00b19 kg, BMI=22\u00b12 kg/m 2 ) and 22 overweight (OW) (88\u00b115 kg, BMI=32\u00b16 kg/m 2 ) women walked at their spontaneous speed along a 2.5 km outdoor circuit with variable slopes (-18% to +18%). Assessment of body oscillations was performed by differential GPS (sampling at 20Hz, with subcentimeter accuracy). The SF was computed by Power Spectrum Density Analysis. The SL was calculated as the distance/# steps and the walk ratio (WR) as SL/SF. The change in GP was calculated using walking on the level as baseline. Results: From -18% to +5% slopes, the change in GP was not significantly different between the C and the OW. Above +5% slope, the SF decreased more in OW as compared to C whereas no significant difference in SL change was observed. As a result the WR increased significantly more in the former compared to values while walking on level: WR increased by 5.6% and 6.4% at +10% and +15% slope, respectively, versus less than 1% increase in C. Conclusion: Adaptation in GP in overweight individuals walking on steeper positive slopes relies more in a reduction in SF than in SL, allowing individuals to moderate walking speed accordingly.",

In our study we compared Czech national growth charts for children 0-2 years (based on Nationwide Anthropological Survey 1991 and 2001) with the new WHO standards. Background: Body Mass Index (BMI) is the indicator most widely used to measure obesity. There would be errors if obesity is determined not by measured BMI, but by self reported BMI. Therefore, this study assessed the accuracy and validity of self reported BMI and identified factors that influence on the misclassification of obesity. Methods: We included 16,153 participants (8,399 men and 7,754 women) who visited a HPC in Seoul and weight, height and general characteristics were obtained by self administrated questionnaire. Pearson product moment correlation coefficients, x2 analysis, sensitivity, specificity were used to determine the accuracy and validity of self reported BMI. We used the logistic regression analysis to identify variables associated with the misclassification of obesity. Results: Weight and height were overestimated for both men and women, and these biases led to underestimations of BMI. Despite the strong correlations between measured and self reported BMI, the prevalence of obesity calculated from measured values was higher than that calculated from self-reported values. Sensitivity and specificity for the self reported BMI were 82.6% and 96.8%, respectively. Female, increasing ages, lower income, and lower education were higher risk factors for the misclassification of obesity. Conclusion: There would be underestimation of obesity in case of using self reported BMI for obesity. Therefore, height and weight of first-time visitors should be measured in-hospital to screen obesity, which will help to diagnose obesity precisely and allow the effective treatment of obesity-related diseases.",

EURO-PREVOB promotes and supports collaboration across existing networks to tackle the social and economic determinants of obesity in Europe. The objectives of EURO-PREVOB are to improve the understanding of the broad determinants of and inequalities in obesity; identify policy initiatives that can impact positively on the determinants of obesity; develop and pilot tools to assess the potential impact of policies on determinants of obesity that are appropriate to different sub-regional contexts; and develop and disseminate guidelines and recommendations for best practice. The project findings will inform public health strategies for obesity prevention, and contribute to best practice in obesity prevention and to the broad dissemination and streamlining of actions against obesity in Europe. Policy tools are being developed to assist obesity policy analysis, identifying the opportunities and limitations of policy transfer to and among European countries. EURO-PREVOB is assessing the applicability of the policy analysis tools in six sub-regions of Europe.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity in a population of middle-aged, sedentary lifestyle and high educational level in the city of Puebla, Mexico. The epidemiological study was cross-sectional survey, the sample was conformed for 74 participants of both gender (37 men and 37 women). It was applied a registration sheet to each participant, also an anthropometric measurement was carried out: weight, size, circumference of waist and hip, cutaneous folds (bicipital, tricipital, subscapular and suprail\u00edac). The average age was of 44.95\u00b17.76 years old; 25% of the population was classified overweight and 14% with obesity according to BMI, percentage of body fat in female was 34.5% and 25.3% in males, waist circumference was 87.37\u00b19.35cm in women and 94.09\u00b18.12cm in men. Conclusions. Given the magnitude and prevalence of obesity, it is seen in Mexico as a threat to the Public Health because it has a negative impact on the quality of life of the population, due to their associated with various chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus type 2, cardiovascular disease and certain malignancies, among others. There is a need for continued research related to overweight, obesity and its associated factors, in order to raise and implement strategies for effective solution to monitor the occurrence of these events.",

Methods: The subjects consisted of 626 adults who participated in a medical checkup. According to Asia-Pacific guidelines, subjects were grouped following; First, subjects were divided into two groups by WC (normal versus high), Second, subjects were divided into two groups by BMI (Group 1; 18.5 kg/m 2 BMI < 25.0 kg/m 2 versus Group 2; 25.0 kg/m 2 BMI < 30.0 kg/m 2 ), Third, subjects were divided into high WC group and normal WC group within the same BMI group. As each reference, odds ratios for hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and the metabolic syndrome were compared. Results: Within the BMI Group 1, individuals with high WC values had greater risk for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and metabolic syndrome compared with those with normal WC values. Within the BMI Group 2, individuals with high WC values had greater risk for hypertension and metabolic syndrome compared with those with normal WC values. These associations remained statistically significant after adjusting for age and sex. Conclusion: Evaluation of each WC and BMI may be a useful method for the assessment of cardiovascular risk, and it is thought to be practical and important to evaluate WC in addition to the BMI.

Methods: The studies published with orlistat as XENDOS, X-PERT, XXL, Derosa et al., Golay et al., Sari et al., Swinburn et al., Samuelson et al., Dimitrov et al., Filippatos et al., Cocco et al., Didangelos et al., Brandberg et al., Tikkainen et al., Bellido and cols., Richelsen et al. and Zelber-Sagi et al. were selected for this study.Results: Orlistat added to life style changes produced a reduction of 37% of the development of DM-2. In patients with DM-2 was observed a reduction of the Hba1c. The reduction of the waist perimeter and the visceral fat estimated have been confirmed in all the studies. The weight loss was enough to reduce the AT. Regarding the lipids, standed out the reduction of the postprandial hyperlipidaemias and the decrease of total and LDL cholesterol. A decrease of non classic risk factors was also observed. Conclusions: Orlistat represent a good choice for the treatment of obese patients due to an effect over different components of the MS including the decrease of the waist perimeter and the visceral AT.",

LDL subclass profiles as well as indicators of plasma oxidative stress and antioxidant potency were determined in pre-and post-intervention fasting state. No significant influence on the overall blood lipid level was found. However dietary fat modification caused by the LF n-3 PUFA (D) and MUFA-rich diet (B), resulted in favorable alteration of LDL phenotype (from B to A), accompanied by diminished oxidative stress and improved antioxidant potency, demonstrating the efficacy of dietary intervention in modification of proatherogenic risk factors in the course of metabolic syndrome without distinct effect on the main plasma lipid concentrations.

Method: At the beginning of 2007, measurement has been performed in several elementary schools. In a file there have been selected 40 boys and 40 girls having 8 to 11 years. According to the BMI index, they have been divided into four weight categories. Maximum strength and maximum pressure of bare foot by walking were measured by the Emed platform. The surface of the foot has been divided in the heel region, the central part of the foot (lateral and medial) and the toe. Evaluation: It is possible to state, that with the increased weight, the average values of the contact surface and of the maximum strength increase. Maximum values of the maximum strength have been found in the toe region. Moderate increase of the average values of the maximum pressure has been recorded in the toe region and, partially, in the heel region. When comparing all weight categories, it is not possible to explicitly say, if average values of maximum pressure depend on body weight. Conclusion: Footwear of obese children should be paid a maximum attention, above all in what concerns the interior room of footwear in its metatarsal region. S165 T3:PS.140",

Methods: case control study included 162 women with osteopenia or osteoporosis diagnosed by distant radius X-ray absorptiometry (\"DTX 200\"). Cases group consisted of 62 patients with metabolic syndrome (MS) according to NCPE ATP III criteria. Members of the Controls group were osteopenic and had no MS. Anthropometry, glucose and lipids metabolism parameters were registered. Results: patients with osteoporosis (T-score -2.5) were less frequent in Case group(x\u00b2 = 4.501; p = 0.034), but there was no difference in atraumatic fractures frequency between the groups (x\u00b2 = 0.278; p = 0.870). Conclusion: MS may be associated with low bone mineral density.

Patients and methods: Forty-two Caucasian subjects were included in the study.Conclusion: It seems that circulating adipokines did not exert influence on depression level in obese women. We observed higher serum concentrations of visfatin and leptin in insulin-resistance obese women. However, resistin and adiponectin concentrations did not differ between groups. Results: Our results are as follows: A concentration dependent biphasic effect could only be detected in control monocytes whereas in obese cells only elevated cholesterol synthesis was found. The signal pathway of 50 ng/mL leptin stimulation involves Ca 2+ signal, activation of PI3 kinase, MAP kinase and HMG CoA reductase. In control monocytes the Ca 2+ signal originated from intracellular pools whereas in obese cells from the extracellular environment. In the 500 ng/mL leptin stimulated control monocytes the suppression of cholesterol synthesis was dependent on the Ca 2+ signal, the H-7 sensitive PKC and PI3 kinase activation, whereas in obese monocytes only PI3 kinase was involved in increased cholesterol synthesis. Conclusion: We conclude that leptin signaling in obese monocytes is characterized by Ca 2+ influx, abrogation of H-7 sensitive PKC activation, and by PI3 kinase-mediated PKC activation.T1:PS.125Adiponectin Levels and Metabolic Factors in Brazilian Adolescents",

Methods: We performed a longitudinal study of consecutive outpatients referred to our unit. We classified all patients in two groups: BMI 30 -39.9 (group 1) and BMI 40 (group 2). Clinical variables (age, sex, years of obesity history, previous stressing personal events). All patients completed a semistructured interview and BDI (Beck Depression Inventory), STAI (Stay And Treats Anxiety Inventory) and COPE (Coping Strategies) questionnaires. A descriptive and a bivariate analyses were performed. Odd Ratios (OR) and its Confidence Intervals (95%CI) by a logistic regression model were obtained. Results: We included 80 obese patients (80% females, 62.0% in group 2). Mean age were 43 yearrs. 58.3% scored above the normal threshold in depression questionnaire, 44.4% in state anxiety and 66.7% in trait anxiety. No significant differences between groups in all questionnaires evaluated. Significant differences were obtained in coping strategies, and in sociodemographic and psychosocial factors between patients with more obesity. It's important to consider the relevance of high prevalence of psychopathology found. These results show us the necessity of integrating physocological management in the multidisciplinary approach of obese patients.Meal duration affects the subjective perception of hunger and satiety in a variable mannerAlexiadou K, Kokkinos A, Argyrakopoulou G, Tentolouris N, Eleftheriadou I, Koliaki C, Konstantoudakis E, Katsilambros N First Department of Propaedeutic Medicine, Athens University Medical School, Laiko General Hospital, Athens, Greece",

Background: Despite the popularity of LC, no long term studies have compared their effects of weight loss and metabolic change to a conventional HC, under isocaloric conditions. Methods: 88 abdominally obese adults were randomly assigned to either an energy restricted (~6-7 MJ, 30% deficit), planned isocaloric LC or HC for 24 weeks in an outpatient clinical trial. Body weight, blood pressure, fasting glucose, lipids, insulin, apoB and C-reactive protein were measured at Week 0 and 24. Results: Weight loss was similar in both groups (LC -11.9\u00b16.3kg, HC -10.1\u00b15.7kg; P=0.17). Blood pressure, C-reactive protein, fasting glucose and insulin reduced similarly with weight loss in both diets. LC produced greater decreases in triacylglycerol (LC -0.64\u00b10.62mmol/L, HC -0.35\u00b10.49mmol/L; P=0.01) and increases in HDL-C (LC 0.25\u00b10.28mmol/L, HC 0.08\u00b10.17mmol/L; P=0.002). LDL-C decreased in HC but remained unchanged in LC (LC 0.03\u00b10.79mmol/L, HC -0.46\u00b10.71mmol/L; P<0.001). However a higher degree of individual variability for the LDL response in LC was observed, with 24% of individuals reporting an increase of at least 10%. ApoB levels were not significantly different from baseline in either diet group. Conclusions: Under isocaloric conditions a LC and HC result in similar weight loss. Although, differential diets effects on lipid profile were observed, cardiovascular risk markers were improved with both diets. This suggests LC as an option for obesity treatment warrants greater consideration, although monitoring individual responsiveness is prudent..

However, no results are available in postmenopausal diabetic women about this relationship in our population. Objectives: To evaluate the relationship between waist circumference and serum triglyceride levels in post menopausal women with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients and methods: 95 postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes mellitus, none of whom were on hormone replacement therapy were chosen for the study. Apart from their basic data, anthropometric measurements and complete fasting serum lipid profile estimation was performed. Data was analyzed using the SPSS\u2122 for Windows version 12.0. Results: While serum triglycerides increased with increasing waist circumference, there was no statistically significant correlation between waist circumference (WC) and serum triglyceride (TG) levels (WC 89.8+14.5cm, TG 1.97+1.2mmol/L, Pearson correlation 0.116, p=0.26). Subgroup analysis was also performed based on waist circumference and similar results were observed.Conclusion:The results indicate a statistically insignificant correlation between waist circumference and serum triglyceride levels.

This study investigated the effects of continued aerobic exercise on metabolic syndrome and arterial stiffness. Method: The subjects were 10 middle-aged female metabolic syndrome patients who underwent medical check-up, met the criteria of NCEP-ATP III and had not taken exercise over the last 3 months. The exercise program was made up of 2 dance sports programs with the level of 50-80% of HRR (Heart Rate Reserve) that lasts 1 hour 2 times a week and walking a time with the level of 13 to 15 (slightly hard-hard) of RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) for 10 weeks. The level of arterial stiffness was measured by CAVI (Cardio Ankle Vascular Index) that used autonomic waveform analyzer. CAVI, anthropometry and blood sampling were conducted before and after the exercise program. Results: CAVI that reflects the level of arterial stiffness significantly declined from 7.5\u00b11.0m/s to 7.2\u00b10.7m/s after the exercise program (P=0.037). Waist circumference significantly decreased from 91.2\u00b16.9 cm to 87.8\u00b15.4 cm (P=0.008), systolic blood pressure from 126.1\u00b112.5mmHg to 121.6\u00b110.4mmHg (P=0.037), fasting blood sugar from 102\u00b118.9mg/dL to 90.2\u00b116.3mg/dL (P=0.005), and triglyceride from 184.5\u00b165.7mg/dL to 152.2\u00b167.5mg/dL (P=0.047).

We estimated the relationship between visceral adiposity and QOL. Methods: The study subjects were 123 men and 196 women (17-69 yearold) who had undergone health examinations for obesity treatment. Anthropometry was measured and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area was determined by computed tomography. The subjects completed a set of standardized tests of Korean obesity-related QOL questionnaire. Results: Mean QOL and subscales were associated with VAT in both men and women. Obesity-related QOL was more impaired in women and older (>=40 year-old) men for those in the highest VAT tertile as compared with those in the lowest VAT tertile. After the multiple regression analyses with adjustment for age and BMI, VAT was identified as predictors of general KOQOL, physical health, work or routine lifestyle subscale in men and physical health and work subscale in women In multiple logistic regression analyses, VAT was an independent predictor of QOL impairment even after adjustment of age and BMI in men and women. Conclusion: VAT was associated with impairment of obesity-related QOL independent of BMI.Comparison of Abdominal Fat Measurement by DXA and AnthropometryDi Gregorio S; Del Rio L; Sole C; Bonel E; Garcia M ; Rosales J CETIR, Centre M\u00e8dic, Barcelona, Spain Waist circumference measured by a tape measure is a commonly used indicator of abdominal fat mass. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), permits direct, immediate measurement of fat mass in the total body, and now also in a new abdominal region. The software automatically calculates %fat and fat mass. Several studies have shown a good relationship between DXA measurements and waist circumference (WC) in overweight individuals. We evaluated if these relationships were similar in underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese patients. A total of 403 subjects participated in this study. Weight status was defined using the World Health Organization BMI categories. One hundred and eighty eight subjects had a normal BMI for age (range 3.years). Abdominal fat (AF) mass between the ribs and pelvis was measured with a Lunar Prodigy (GE Healthcare), software version 8.1, which automatically calculates %fat and fat mass (g). The linear regression model showed a significant correlation in normal subjects, overweight and obese patients, but were more significant in overweight and obese patients than normal subjects In conclusion waist circumference measurements have a strong correlation with fat mass measured by DXA in overweight and obese individuals, and moderate or insignificant correlation in normal and underweight individuals, respectively.T2:PS:136Validation of resting energy expenditure predictive equations with indirect calorimetry in obese adolescentsHofsteenge GH 1 , Stam M 1 , Chin A Paw MJM 2 , Delemarre-van de Waal HA 3 , Weijs PJM 1 1 Dept Nutrition and Dietetics, 2 EMGO Institute, Dept Public and Occupational Health, 3 Dept Paediatrics, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; correspondence: A.Hofsteenge@vumc.nl Background: When resting energy expenditure (REE) of obese adolescents cannot be measured by indirect calorimetry, it has to be predicted with an equation. The aim was to validate the published REE predictive equations with indirect calorimetry in obese adolescents. Methods: Predictive equations were included when based on weight, height, gender, age, fat free mass (FFM) and fat mass, measured with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. REE was measured with indirect calorimetry. Accuracy of equations was evaluated by the root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE), the mean percentage difference between predicted and measured methods (bias), the percentage of patients predicted within 10% of REE measured. Results: Included were 42 predictive equations (of which 16 based on FFM) and 85 subjects (F 49, M 36) with mean age 14.6 (range 12-18) y and BMI 33.3 (range 24.0-44.5) kg/m 2 . The RMSPE ranged 171-659 kcal per day and the percentage of patients with acceptable prediction ranged from 76% to 1% depending on the equation used. The gender specific Molnar equation (1994) had the smallest RMSPE (171 kcal/d) and bias (-1 kcal/d), with high percentage (72%) of subjects predicted well. The Schofield equation had a high RMSPE and bias, and a low percentage of boys predicted well. Conclusions: Indirect calorimetry remains the method of choice for REE. However, when REE predictive equations are used for obese adolescents 12-18 years, the Molnar equation appears most accurate.

Methods: 485 children aged 6-13 years old, from elementary schools of Nemea region were included in the study. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated, while information about the time spent on television watching and organized physical activities, as well as about dietary habits was collected. Results: Children who watched television for >2hours(h)/day were significantly more likely than children who watched television for < or = 2h/days to: have more than 2 servings/week of fast food (77.4% vs. 63.2% respectively, p<0.05), and to have fewer than 2 servings/week of vegetables (35.2% vs. 20.4% respectively, p<0.05). These children were also less likely to participate in organized physical activities (19.3% vs. 29.9% in children who watched television for < or = 2h/days, p<0.05). Finally children who watched television for >2h/day tended to have higher BMI than children who watched television for < or = 2h/days, although this difference did not reach the level of statistical significance (prevalence of overweight/obesity respectively: 33.6% vs. 29.9%, p=NS). Conclusion: Children watching television for more than 2 hours daily are at increased risk of having adverse habits such as low levels of physical activity and poor dietary behavior.T2:PS:147A validated screening tool can be used to identify night-eaters in a UK obesity clinic.Cleator J.1 , James M 1 Wilding J. 1 , Sutton C.J. 2 , Judd PA. 2 University of Liverpool Diabetes & Endocrinology Clinical Research Group 1 . Lancashire School of Health and PG Medicine, University of Central Lancs, Preston 2 .Introduction: Identifying Night Eating Syndrome (NES) in the clinical setting is problematic. Limited resources prevent routine interviews by eating disorder specialists. Screening tools may be useful for preliminary identification, although there is no tool validated for use in UK obese populations. Materials and Methods: 80 subjects from a UK obesity clinic were interviewed for evidence of NES and other eating disorders (ED) based on current criteria. Subjects also completed a screening tool based on the interview items. Results of the interview and tool were compared. Results: The seven subjects who met all criteria for NES and 23 who partially met the criteria were classed as one 'night-eater' group (n=30). All other subjects were classed as non 'night-eaters' (n=50). ROC curve analysis showed an optimal cut-off score of 23 or higher on the night eating items of The tool was successful in identifying night eating, but did not exclude other ED, a prerequisite for a NES diagnosis. In clinical practice, those identified as night-eaters by the tool should have a follow-up diagnostic interview to determine if another Eating Disorder is present.

Laboratorio de T\u00e9cnicas Instrumentales, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad Complutense of Madrid, 28040-Madrid (Spain)BMI and waist circumference are predictors of higher oxidative stress in adults. However, data on the association of abdominal fat and oxidative stress in children are scarce. Objective: Study the relationship between Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and the BMI and waist circumference in schoolchildren.Material and Methods:The study subjects were 352 schoolchildren (154 male and 198 female) from the Community of Madrid, between 9 and 12 years of age. Weight, height and waist circumference were measured following WHO norms. MDA levels were determined as oxidative stress indicators. BMI and a Z-score for waist circumference (Z-WC) were calculated for each children. Results: There were no differences between boys and girls regarding age, weight, height, BMI, Z-WC or MDA. Waist circumference were significantly lower in girls (63.5\u00b17.25 cm versus 66.6\u00b19.8 cm in boys; p<0.001). BMI and WC were correlated with MDA levels (r=0.6406 and r=0.5773, respectively, p>0.001). When considering sex, BMI and Z-WC, only BMI are a predictor of MDA in boys (MDA=0.327 + 0.029 IMC + 0.001 Z-WC; R 2 =0.5188, p<0.001 for the whole model), while both BMI and Z-WC are positive predictors of MDA in girls (MDA= 0.550 + 0.018 BMI + 0.030 Z-WC; R 2 =0.3484, p<0.001 for the whole model). Conclusion: BMI is a strong predictor of MDA levels in both boys and girls, while higher Z-WC is also an independent predictor only in girls. Abdominal obesity could be a risk factor for higher oxidative stress since childhood, especially in girls.

Adipocyte size was measured by osmium fixation, dissociation with urea and counting/sizing on a Coulter counter, followed by a novel statistical analysis to identify subdistribution of adipocyte size [Smith SR, Adipocytes 2006]. Four major adipocyte sub-distributions were identified: very large, large, medium and small adipocytes. Total abdominal subcutaneous number=subcutaneous adipose tissue mass [multislice CT] /mean adipocyte size. Results: Women had greater adipocyte number as well as bigger large adipocytes as compared to men. BMI was positively correlated with very-large adipocyte size in women [R=0.25]. In men, BMI was correlated with total abdominal subcutaneous adipocyte number [R=0.62]. The best correlate of insulin resistance [HOMA] was mean adipocyte size in both women and men [R=0.38 and R=0.56, respectively].HOMA variation was explained by mean adipocyte size and adipocyte number in the women [R2=17], and by mean adipocyte size, visceral adipose tissue mass, age and percent small adipocytes in men [R2=47]. Discussion: Women increase fat mass by adipocyte hypertrophia. Men increase fat mass by hyperplastia, perhaps to compensate for the lower number of adipocytes in abdominal subcutaneous adipose depot. These adaptation features might explain the paradox of decreased metabolic risk despite increased fat mass in women.

Although birth weight has been associated with stroke, less is known about how childhood BMI may affect the risk. Therefore we investigated if birth weight and childhood BMI from 7-13 years of age was associated with stroke in adulthood. The subjects were 97.391 boys and 93.772 girls born from 1936-1976 in the Copenhagen School Health Records Register. BMI values were calculated and transformed to z scores. Stroke events were obtained from Danish Hospital and Cause of Death Registers. Cox regressions were performed. Among boys, birth weight was associated with stroke in adulthood. Compared to boys in the reference category (3251-3750g) those in the lowest (2000-2750g) had a relative risk (RR) of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.22-1.55) of stroke. BMI at 13y was independently associated with stroke in boys. Birth weight and BMI did not interact on the risk of stroke. In a model adjusted for birth weight, compared to those with a z score in the reference category (-0.25-0.25) boys with a BMI z-score >=0.75 had a RR of 1.15 (95% CI: 1.02-1.29). Similar results were observed for girls. Birth weight and BMI have independent associations with stroke in adulthood. Taken together, these results suggest that some risk for stroke is already present at birth but that childhood BMI matters as well. Unlike birth weight, childhood BMI is amenable to intervention, thus prevention possibilities remain.Funding: NIH NRSA 1F32DK070491 (to JLB) & The Danish National Research Foundation T5:PS.53 Relationship between obesity and depression measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale in Korean working population ?Jung-Jin Cho 1 , Ji-Yong Kim 2 , Young-Ho Choi 3 , Soo-Young Kim 4 , Chang-Ho Choi 5 1 Hallym University Sacred Heart Hopsital, Anyang-si, Korea; 2 Dongkook University, Seongnam-si, Korea; 3 Chucheon University Sacred Heart, Chucheon, Korea; 4 Eulji University, Daejeon-si, Korea 5 Masan Samsung Hospital, Masan, KoreaObjectives: This study evaluates the relationships between body weight and depression in an adult Korean working population.

The primary predictor was body mass index (BMI), treated both continuously and categorically in logistic regression analyses. Covariates included age, income, education and marital status. Results: Among women, increased BMI was significantly protective for the presence of depression measured by CES-D (OR = 0.93 95% CI = 0.89, 0.96). Among men, BMI was not associated with depression (OR=1.00, 95% CI = 0.97, 1.04). Relative to average-weight women, obese women (BMI >=25kg/m 2 ) had decreased odds of depression (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.48, 0.95). However under weight women (OR= 1.42 95% CI = 0.83, 2.44) and severe obese (BMI>=30kg/m 2 ) women (OR=1.47, 95% CI =0.64, 3.7) had increased odds of depression, but they weren't significant. No differences between average-weight and obese men were demonstrated (OR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.75, 1.28). Relative to average-weight men, underweight (OR =1.33, 95% CI = 0.88, 2.01) and severe obese men (OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 0.91, 3.71) had increased odds of depression, but they weren't significant. Conclusions: Differences in BMI was associated with current depressive mood in women, which findings are different from western study. Longitudinal studies are needed to differentiate the discrepancy between two societies.

In France, the National Nutrition and Health Program implemented in 2001 aimed to stop this trend. We assessed the changes in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in 7-9y old children between 2000 and 2007. Methods: The protocol was based on the European Childhood Obesity Group recommendations (Lehingue, Am J Clin Nutr, 1999). One primary school was randomly selected in each voluntary department of France, in which two randomly selected classes were included. Weight and height were measured by the medical staff. A lifestyle questionnaire was completed by the parents. IOTF cut-offs were used to define body-mass status. Results: Sixty-seven percent of the French departments participated. In 2007, 19.7% of the 2,525 children included were overweight (boys: 18.3%, girls: 21.1%), among whom 4.8% were obese (boys and girls: 4.8%). Prevalence of overweight was lower in children with executive mothers (8.8%) or fathers (9.3%). Overweight children spent more time in front of a TV or a computer (2h30) than non-overweight children (2h07). In the departments investigated in both 2000 (n=1,582 children) and 2007 (n=1,014) the prevalence of overweight was 18.1% including 3.8% obese in 2000 and 18.1% including 4.0% obese in 2007.Conclusion:This study gives up-to-date prevalence of overweight and obesity in 7-9y children in France. After increasing prevalence during recent decades, the observed stabilisation is encouraging. Factors contributing to this levelling-off must be investigated. An impact of the French National Nutrition and Health Program can be hypothesised.Fat Mass Index and Fat Free mass Index Reference Curves for Children Aged 11-14yearsUniversity of Chichester, Chichester, UK This paper considers methods available for the measurement of childhood obesity and suggests Fat Mass Index (FMI) as a useful diagnostic and assessment tool.

Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted among 785 junior high school students over a 2-year period. Data were collect at baseline in 2004 and 12, 24 months later including anthropometry, parental factors, child's dietary behaviours, sedentary and physical activities using questionnaires and accelerometers. Body mass index (BMI) was assessed and overweight/obesity was defined using IOTF cut-offs. Soft-drink consumption was classified as frequently; not frequently or rarely/don't consume. TV viewing was divided into three levels: <2 hours, 2-3 hours, and >3 hours. Longitudinal Poisson regression analyses were applied to assess associations between dietary and physical/sedentary behaviours and adolescent overweight/obesity. Result: After adjustment for demographics, family/parental factors, the risk of overweight/obesity was 2.5 times higher in children spending >3 hours/day watching TV (RR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.8, 3.4) compared to <2 hours, and was 30% lower in children having 20 minutes/day for vigorous activities (RR = 0.7, 95%CI = 0.6, 0.9) compared to <20 minutes. Frequently consuming sweetened soft-drink increases the risk of overweight/obesity three times (RR = 3.0, 95%CI = 1.9, 4.7) compared to those with the lowest frequency of consumption of soft drinks. Conclusion: Consumption of soft-drink, physical activity and TV viewing are related to overweight/obesity in adolescents in HCMC. Intervention strategies to promote physical activity and reduce TV viewing as well as soft-drink consumption are needed to prevent overweight/obesity among adolescents in HCMC.",

Methods: In this population based cohort study of TLGS, a representative sample of 644 non diabetic adults (211 men, 433 women), aged 20 year, participating in phase III, were selected. The first phase of the TLGS began in 1997.The participants were categorized in three groups, those without and with Met.S in all three phases (group1 and 3 respectively) and those with Met.S in one or two of phases (group2). HRQOL were assessed using the Iranian version of SF-36. A score lower than the sex-specific 10 th percentile of each scale defined as poor HRQOL. Met.S was assessed using ATPIII definition. ANCOVA and logistic regression were used in men and women separately and adjusted for related confounders. Results: Mean age of participants was 49.1\u00b114.0 years, and 67.2% were female. Compared to the first, women placed in the second and third groups had lower scores of Physical component scale (74.1\u00b12.3 vs. 70.0\u00b12.5, 66.3\u00b12.4 p<0.01). In women, there was a significant reducing trend in the scores of bodily pain, general and mental health across the three groups respectively (p<0.05). Among men, however, no significant difference was observed in any of the HRQOL domains in the study groups. In women, the odds ratios of poor physical and mental HRQOL were The duration of Met.S is associated with poor HRQoL in women, not in men and mainly in physical rather than mental health.Mc4r mutations in a sample of morbid obese portuguese patients Department of Endocrinology Hospital S.

Faculty of Nutrition and Food Sciencies, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal Obesity is a chronic multifactorial disease with genetic, metabolic, behavioural, psychological and social components. The Portuguese population obesity prevalence is approximately 14%. Mutations in the gene encoding the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R), present in 2-6% of patients with morbid obesity (MO), represent the most common monogenic cause of obesity. Objective: To evaluate the MC4R gene mutations prevalence in MO patients and its correlation with Binge Eating Disorders (BED). Subjects and Methods: 102 patients (88 females) with MO were screened for mutations in MC4R gene by direct sequence analysis and females evaluated for the prevalence of BED. Results: Five missense mutations in heterozygosity were detected in the MC4R coding region (c.307G>A, c.751A>C, c.811T>C, c.869T>A and c.1056C>T), each with an allele frequency of 0.49%. A mutation in the 5' untranslated region (c.-178A>C) was detected in 4 cases, one in homozygosity and 3 in heterozygosity (allele frequency: 2.45%). The substitution c.-178A>C, as well as the missense mutations c.307G>A(p.Val103Ile) and c.751A>C(p.Leu251Ile), are probably not associated with obesity related-phenotypes since its prevalence is similar in obese and control populations. The three other detected missense mutations, c.811T>C (p.Cys271Arg), c.869T>A(p.Leu290Gln) and c.1056C>T (3'untranslated region)were not yet reported. Twenty females (22.7%) presented BED. These were younger (36\u00b110y) than the patients without BED (42\u00b111y;p=0.02). Conclusions: Three polymorphisms at a frequency of 5.9%, and three non-described mutations with a frequency of 0.98% each were detected in our study. These values are in keeping with previous reports.No correlation of presence of MC4R mutations with BED was observed.

Methods: In total, 397 children (202 boys, 195 girls; 7-10 yrs) from 6 different schools were recruited. The 2-month intervention consisted of promoting mineral water intake by (1) 40-minute educations and leaflets about the adequate fluid consumption, and (2) providing free availability of mineral water in the classrooms by bottled water coolers. At baseline and after the program, all children filled out questionnaires about knowledge of fluid consumption, and about beverage consumption habits overall and at school. After the program, an additional questionnaire (effects of the program on beverage intake of the children and the family, satisfaction with the program, weight and height of parents and the child measured by the parents) was made for parents. Results: During the 2 months, children consumed 285 tanks (5415 liter) mineral water. 92% of the students drank mineral water from the cooler at least once a day. With an emphasis on practical and fun learning, the knowledge of the children has improved markedly. In addition, mineral water consumption increased (0.37\u00b10.2 vs. 0.46\u00b10.2 l/d) and soft drink consumption decreased (0.26\u00b10.3 vs. 0.20\u00b10.2 l/d) significantly after the 2-month period. Conclusion: Providing free availability of mineral water as a healthy choice for beverage intake seems to be a good practice to reduce soft drinks consumption in children.

Methods: cross-sectional study on 2,331 boys and 2,366 girls aged 10 -18 years. Body mass index (BMI) was measured using standardized methods; body fat (BF) was assessed by bioelectrical impedance. Low aerobic fitness was assessed by the 20-meter shuttle run using the FITNESSGRAM \u00ae criteria. Waist was measured in a subsample of 1,933 boys and 1,897 girls. Overweight, obesity and excess fat were defined according to the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) or FITNESSGRAM \u00ae criteria. Results: 38.5% of boys and 46.5% of girls were considered as unfit according to the FITNESSGRAM \u00ae criteria. In boys, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and 95% confidence interval were 66.7 (64.1 -69.3), 67.1 (64.5 -69.6) and 64.6 (61.9 -67.2) for BMI, BF and waist, respectively (P<0.02). In girls, the values were 68.3 (65.9 -70.8), 63.8 (61.3 -66.3) and 65.9 (63.4 -68.4), respectively (P<0.001).

Children's Nutrition Research Centre, Discipline of Paediatrics and Child Health, University of Queensland, Royal Children's Hospital Herston QLD 4029, Australia Introduction: Body Mass Index (BMI) is widely used for assessing overweight and obesity in children. Recently, waist circumference to height ratio (WHtR) has been proposed to be of greater value in predicting obesity related co-morbidities in children. This ratio, however, has not been extensively validated within the paediatric population. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of this index as an appropriate method of adjusting waist circumference for height, in a cohort of Australian children and adolescents. Methods: Height (Ht) and waist circumference (WC) were measured in 3600 children (1737 boys and 1863 girls), from grades 1 (5-7yrs), 5 (9-11yrs) and 10 (15-17yrs), as part of the Healthy Kids Queensland: Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey in 2006. Natural logarithms of waist circumference (cm) and height (cm) were used in regression analyses to determine appropriate powers (p) to raise height, to completely adjust the index for height, by sex and age. Correlations between WHtR and Ht were also assessed. Results: Statistically, WHtR is only valid for use among boys and girls aged 5-7yrs (p= 1.091 (95%CI 0.953-1.229) and p=1.051 (0.907-1.195), respectively) and girls aged 15-17yrs (p= 0.849 (0.616-1.082). However, the error (0.002%-1.00%) associated with the use of this index, in all ages and both sexes is clinically and biologically acceptable. Conclusion: The WHtR is a valid ratio to use among Australian children and adolescents. It may be more appropriate to use than BMI and further investigation can now be undertaken to evaluate its role in predicting health risks.Should early childhood be a focus for obesity prevention?

Design: Following an 8-wk LCD and a 2-3 wk refeeding period subjects were randomized to 3 diets for 6 mo: MUFA: Moderate-fat (35-45E%), high in MonoUnsaturated-Fatty-Acid with low glycemic index; LF: Low Fat (20-30E%) or CTR: ConTRol (35E% fat). A meal test study was performed before and after the 6 mo dietary intervention. Results: No difference in body weight, energy intake or appetite ratings were observed between diets. Both the LF and MUFA diets compared to CTR diet reduced postprandial glycaemia and insulinemia and lowered fasting insulin from mo 0 to 6. Following the 8-wk LCD period lower levels of the appetite regulating peptides: PP, PYY, GLP-1 and GLP-2 along with increased appetite scores were seen in comparison to measurements performed after the 6 mo dietary intervention.Conclusions:The two competing diets, MUFA and LF, were equally good with respect to glucose metabolism, whereas the CTR diet resembling the typical Western diet, high in saturated fatty acids, sugar and high glycemic carbohydrates resulted in higher postprandial glucose-and insulin responses. Lower levels of appetite regulatory peptides along with increased appetite scores following an 8-wk LCD and 2-3 wk refeeding period, suggest that strategies for physiological appetite control following a LCD period are needed, in order to prevent weight regain.Funding: Research relating to this abstract was funded by H.A.

Methods: A representative sample of 4,114 students (7 th -10 th grades) from Abu Dhabi was selected for participation in the Global School-Based Student Health Survey. Participants answered questions on diet and nutrition, physical activity, health protective factors, sociodemographics, and psychosocial domains. Results: Preliminary analysis indicates alarming signs for boys and girls in the Abu Dhabi Emirate. With regard to diet/nutrition, and irrespective of gender, about 35% of the adolescents are overweight or at risk for becoming overweight, 17% consume fastfood three or more times a week, and over 18% eat high-fat foods two or more times a day. On the other hand, only about 20% participate regularly in efficient physical activity, nearly 36% spend three or more hours daily in sedentary leisure activities, and almost 78% use a means of transportation to go to school. Ongoing multivariate analysis focuses on important correlates of risky dietary behaviors and inactivity for youth, such as awareness/knowledge of health risks, parental monitoring and feelings of loneliness, along with sociodemographics such as age, gender, ethnicity, public or private school, and SES.

Lorenzo et al. defined Normal-Weight Obesity (NWO) Syndrome, for women with normal body mass index (BMI<25Kg/m 2 ), but excess fat mass (FM>=30%). Objective:Evaluate differences of NWO syndrome and CVD risk factors between rheumatic women (RW) and healthy women(HW). Methods:We analysed anthropometric variables, body composition by bioelectricalimpedance, hypertension and CVD risk defined by abdominal perimeter (AP 88cm) in 779 women. RW included 584, with 51.9\u00b115.9years, 117(20.0%) Rheumatoid Arthitis(RA), 97(16.6%) Osteoarthritis(OA), 59(10.1%) Spondyloarthropathy(SpA) and 28(4.8%) Osteoporosis(OP), were compared to (n=195) aged 38.0\u00b18.4years. NWO group was compared to non-obese women and NWO RW to NWO HW (54.3\u00b113.8vs.40.2\u00b18.6years; p<0.0005). Results:RW had higher BMI, FM, AP, hypertension and lower total body water (TBW) than HW(p<0.05). The NWO group (n=215) showed higher BMI, AP, hypertension and altered body composition compared with non-obese women(p<0.05). NWO syndrome affected 33.3% RA, 32.1% OP, 32.0% OA and 25.0% SpA's. NWO RW (n=179, 30.7%) presented higher FM (32.8\u00b12.2%vs.31.8\u00b11.3; p=0.012), significant TBW deficit (58.7%vs.37.8%; p=0.020) and higher prevalence of hypertension (44.4%vs.2.8%; p<0.0005) than NWO HW (n=36, 18.5%). AP risk factor did not differ between the NWO groups (74.3%vs.73.0%). Conclusion:NWO syndrome affects a significant group of RW, without differences among most frequent rheumatic diseases, and when compared to NWO HW, we verified a higher prevalence of hypertension and TBW deficit. The presence of metabolic variables alterations in a normal BMI group, reveals a potential risk for developing CVD associated to obesity.T5:PS.108 Structured, Interdisciplinary and Cross-sectorial Offer for Overweight Infants and Their Families in Ringkj\u00f8bing CommunityK Christiansen 1 , L Dalhoff 1 , M Sand 1 , L Viggers 1 . 1 Holstebro Hospital Professional Backing Group: Hans S\u00f8ndergaard 2 , Berit Lilienthal Heitmann 3 , Ulla H\u00f8lund 4 , Jan Eriksen 5 , Lise Forsom 6 , Karen Skou 7 , Jesper Juul 8 , Christian M\u00f8lgaard 9 , Mauritz Dirdal 10 , Ingeborg Kristensen 11 , Alice S\u00f8rensen 12",

Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, a member of the CC chemokine suprefamily, plays a crucial role in adipose tissue inflammatory responses by inducing the infiltration of macrophages. Therefore, it is important to decrease the production of MCP-1 to prevent obesity-related inflammation. Abietic acid (AA), a major component of the rosin fraction of conifer species, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory properties partly via activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma. On the other hand, the efficacy of many AA derivatives including dehydroabietic acid (DAA), which is also contained in conifer, has not been well studied. Using a sensitive screening system for PPAR ligands, we showed that DAA is the most potent dual activator of PPAR alpha and gamma. Furthermore, we examined the effect of DAA on the inflammatory changes in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages and in the interaction between macrophages and adipocytes. DAA significantly suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as MCP-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and nitric oxide in LPS-stimulated RAW 264 macrophages and in the coculture of RAW 264 macrophages and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These results suggest a novel possibility that DAA, natural PPARs agonist, can be a valuable medicinal and food component for improving the inflammatory changes associated with obesity-related diabetes.",

Methods: 94 women (age, 39.3\u00b16.5 y; BMI, 29.3\u00b14, 9 kg/m Background: This study aimed at determining body size satisfaction to investigate whether perception of social norms for body size varies in different groups of society, to see if there is a differences of attitudes between men and women, younger adults, those of higher economic status, those living in urban versus rural areas, married versus single adults, and obese, overweight and normal weight adults. As Tunisia is in an advanced stage of epidemiological transition, the aim was to see if attitudes also appear to be in transition. Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with a nationally representative random stratified, 2-level clustered sample of households aged 35-70 yrs in 2005. An attitudinal scale was developed and validated for this study and contained 13 items that assessed 3 domains-Body satisfaction; Fatness as a value; and Slimness as a value (internal consistency 0.62-0.70 using cronbach's alpha). Linear regression models were used to assess raw and adjusted effect of socio demographic factors on each score. Results: 5416 households participated, of which 63% were either overweight or obese (BMI 25) . Half of women and one-third of men were dissatisfied with their current weight. Those living in cities, on higher income, or with higher education levels were the least satisfied with their body weight (p<0.0001). These same groups had a preference for slimness, whereas fatness was valued more in rural areas, by illiterate, low income adults (p<0.0001). There was no preference by younger adults for slimmer body sizes, as had been expected. Conclusion: The finding that norms for body size in urban areas and in wealthier, higher educated groups are for slimness suggests a transition to those resembling many western cultures. Aims: To identify risk factors for the development of overweight and obesity in a cohort of preschool children.",

Information on neighbourhood, preschool and home environments, socio-economic status, the child and parental characteristics were collected using interviewadministered questionnaires. Dietary intake and physical activity were measured using modified, validated questionnaires. Weight, height were measured and body mass index (BMI: kg/m 2 ) was calculated. Overweight/obesity was classified using IOTF criteria. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were employed to assess longitudinal relationships between risk factors and development of overweight/obesity. Results: Similar factors predicting development of overweight/obesity and obesity only were wealthiest family and male gender. Other factors including emotional relationship with parents (adjusted relative risk, 1.47, 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.15), availability of fruit and vegetables at home (0.50, 0.33 to 0.76), paternal overweight ( Background: Obesity and underweight in young adulthood are associated with greater risk of future disability pension, but the specific causes driving these risks is not well established. The risk associated with overweight at this age has not been established either. Objective: To investigate the risk of future disability pension from all and specific causes according to BMI in young adulthood. Methods: Height and weight were measured at military conscription between 1969 and 2005 (n=1 580 460; 18.3\u00b10.4y). Date and cause of disability pension (ICD 8/9/10), death and emigration dates were collected from national registers between 1971 and 2006. Data on municipality, socio-economic position, testing centre, and test year were adjusted for in Cox proportional hazard models. Results: During 30 820 283 person-years of follow-up, 62 775 subjects were granted disability pension. The total number, and associated hazard ratios (with 95% confidence intervals), are shown in the Background: Obese subjects are believed to eat more and have less healthy eating patterns than normal weight subjects. This assumption, difficult to verify in self-reported data, was explored using co-twin cross-validation and objective measures of energy expenditure in young adult twins. Methods: Comparisons of proxy responses from co-twins and self-reports on questions of eating behavior were studied in 2120 monozygotic and same-sex dizygotic twin pairs aged 22-28 years. Energy intake (EI) was examined by 3-day diaries and total energy expenditure (TEE) by doubly-labeled water in the top 5% most obesity-discordant monozygotic pairs (n=14) and matched control pairs (n=10). Results: Using responses where both twins answered similarly, the twins who were rated to eat more, snack more, choose less healthy foods, eat more fatty foods and sweet and fatty delicacies, were significantly heavier than their co-twins in both monozygotic and dizygotic pairs. Within weight-discordant monozygotic pairs (\u0394BMI 5.2 kg/m 2 ), both co-twins consistently agreed that obese co-twins ate more and had less healthy eating habits than non-obese co-twins. In food diaries, daily EI was similar in obese (9.6 MJ/d) and non-obese co-twins (9.8 MJ/d) which was due to significant underreporting in obese (3.2 MJ/d, 25% of TEE) but not in non-obese co-twins (0.8 MJ/d, 8% of TEE). Underreporting was directed specifically at sweet and high-fat delicacies. Conclusions: Obesity is characterised by excess energy intake and unhealthy eating but due to a considerable underreporting, self-reported food intake is unreliable. Using twins as mutual proxy respondents can significantly increase accuracy of self-reported eating behavior.

This paper demonstrates the utility of micro-level spatial analysis and ecology modelling to facilitate the development of an effective local policy to prevent obesity. Methods: Childhood obesity was defined by body mass index, using cross-sectional height and weight data for children aged 3-13 years (obesity > 98 th centile; British reference dataset).Hot spots of childhood obesity were determined (using SaTScan). Relationships between obesity and simulated obesogenic variables (from the Health Survey for England 2002 and the Expenditure and Food Survey 2005) were assessed using geographically weighted regression, thereby identifying the key global and local determinants of childhood obesity. The existing evidence base was used to develop an ecology framework for a comprehensive obesity prevention policy, which was tailored to each case study locality using the results of the spatial analysis. Results: Obesity was shown to vary greatly, with hot spots in deprived and affluent areas. Twelve simulated covariates were determined as having a strong relationship with obesity. The most important determinants globally and locally were different, plus the key local determinants were different in different wards. This enabled the generic ANGELO-style obesity policy to be modified to allow for each neighbourhood's nuances. Discussion: This paper shows how policy can be tailored to the specific needs of each micro-area, and suggests that solutions need to be tailored to the locality to be most effective. For maximum benefit an obesity prevention policy needs to take a coordinated, multi-component, multi-sectorial public health approach.

The Pro12Ala polymorphism of this gene has been related to visceral fat depot. Moreover some studies have reported interactions between the Pro12Ala genotype and fatty acid intake on insulin resistance and BMI. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of the Pro12Ala polymorphism on abdominal obesity in a randomized dietary trial assessing the effect of a Mediterraneanstyle diet in high cardiovascular risk patients. Methods: A total of 750 high-risk subjects aged 55-80 were recruited. Each subject was randomly assigned to one of three nutritional intervention groups: two of them were advised to follow a Mediterranean-style diet, one with high intake of virgin olive oil and the other with high intake of nuts. The third group was a control group that was advised to follow a conventional low-fat diet. All the participants were genotyped by real time PCR followed by allelic discrimination. Results: Carriers of the 12Ala allele had a statistically significant higher waist circumference (regression coefficient=1.894; p=0.001) compared to wild type subjects after two years of nutritional intervention. When the analysis was performed taking together the genotype and the nutritional group, this adverse effect was not observed among 12Ala carriers allocated to olive oil group. Conclusion: Subjects with the 12Ala allele of the PPARG gene had a higher risk of abdominal obesity than non carriers. It seems that virgin olive oil reverses the effect of Pro12Ala on visceral fat protecting against a higher waist circumference.

The cohort was analyzed over a 10-year interval: children born in 1980 were compared to those born in 1990. Cole's cut off points was used in order to allow international comparisons. Trained school paramedics measured body weight & height repeatedly approximately every year in the initial cohort.Age range : 5.0 to 11.5 y 11.5 \u00e0 16 y 5.00 to 11.5 y 11.5 to 16 y We observed an increase of variable magnitude in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children, which is gender dependent: the prevalence of obesity, although initially low as compared to other European countries, has doubled over 10 years in boys. Introduction: This study is part of an international research effort by various research groups from Australia, Czechoslovakia, Germany, and Switzerland (see acknowledgements). The prevalence of foot disorders and other orthopaedic problems among young people raise sharply 1 . The reason for this situation is widely unknown Anthropometrics of the children and their feet changed sizeably over the last decades. In this context the number of obese children is increased worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of obesity in children in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and to analyse the frequency of foot, knee and back discomfort in obese children. Method: 1000 children (50 % girls, 50 % boys), aged from 6 to 15, of different Czech and Slovak cities were evaluated using a questionnaire about foot, knee and back pain 2 . Additionally the children's body weight and height were examined Data were analysed using SPSS15.0 for Windows. Results: The occurrence of obesity is significantly higher in large cities. Surprisingly, regarding the frequency of orthopaedic problems, undernourished children were complaining more often, about pain in their back and feet than obese or normal weight children. On the other hand, in these children knee pain appeared more often. Considering the feet, the most frequent troubles were in the area of plantar heel and medial longitudinal arch as well as on the lateral side of the ankle.",

The objective of our study was to assess the association between protein intake and obesity risk in schoolchildren. Participants and methods: The study was performed in a convenience sample of 1962 Portuguese school children (49.8% girls), 5-10-year-old (age was 7.5 \u00b1 1.23 years). Height and weight were measured according to international standards, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. The definition of obesity was based on average centiles according to the International Obesity Task Force cut-offs. Children's parents completed a self-administered questionnaire, which provided information on general family background characteristics, children's dietary intake (using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire), and children's physical activity. Unconditional logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the magnitude of the association between protein consumption (adjusted for energy intake) and obesity in children, adjusting for confounders (age, breastfeeding, parental education, dietary fibre, total fat and energy intake). Results: The prevalence of obesity was 14% in boys and 11% in girls. In boys, the probability of being obese increased significantly for those who were in the highest quartile of protein consumption adjusted for energy intake (OR = 1.70, 95% CI 1.01-2.85, p = 0.046), even after adjustment for confounders (OR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.13-3.50, p = 0.017); in girls, no association was found between protein intake and obesity. Conclusion: High protein intake was positively associated with obesity in boys.",

Methods: Cross sectional study with 2013 adults (40.8% men) aged 18 years and older, participating in the 2005 Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System. Height and weight were reported by the participants. Overweight was defined as BMI 25kg/m 2 . Sex-specific relationships of being overweight with sociodemographic factors and lifestyle behaviours were analyzed using Poisson regression. Results: The prevalence of overweight was 39.4% (men=45.2%, women=33.7%, p<0.01). Overweight men and women were more likely to be older, married, and employed. For women, to be non-white colour and being studied less than 9 years were also associated with the risk of overweight. Controlling for sociodemographic factors, overweight men were more likely to report that they were smokers (prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.30). A protective effect against overweight were observed for men reporting consumption of fruits and vegetables five or more times a day (PR=0.76, 95%CI 0.60-0.96), and reporting not eating beef, as compared to those reporting consumption of meat with visible fat (PR=0.57, 95%CI 0.38-0.87). Compared with women who reported consumption of alcoholic drinks more than seven doses per week, those who reported consumption rarely or never, were less likely to be overweight (PR=0.67, 95%CI 0.49-0.92). Conclusions: A high rate of overweight was observed in adults from Florian\u00f3polis city. The findings indicate the importance of identifying sociodemographic characteristics and life style behaviours associated with the risk of overweight.",

Less data are available about possible differences in nutrition in daily life between patients with manifest type 2 diabetes mellitus and those at an increased risk for type 2 diabetes. Patients and Methods: In a medical outdoor center a questionnaire about nutrition in daily life was part of the routinely performed clinical and laboratory measurements at the initial visit. The questionnaire comprised 50 typical middle-European food items and was evaluated by 2 dietitians.148 patients revealed a metabolic syndrome without manifest diabetes, 43 with manifest type 2 diabetes. During the further treatment procedures all patients obtained dietary instructions according to the recommendations of the Austrian Diabetes Association. Data are characterized by mean and standard deviation. Group comparisons were conducted by Student`s t test or nonparametric Mann Whitney U test. Frequency distributions were compared using the chi-squared test. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Patients with manifest type 2 diabetes (HbA1c value 7.3\u00b11.2%) were older (63.9\u00b112.9 years) and revealed a higher BMI (28.1\u00b14.5 kg/m2) compared to patients without manifest diabetes (age: 58.0\u00b19.8 years, p<0.001; BMI: 26.2\u00b13.9 kg/m 2 ,p<0.020). Type 2 diabetics reported a significantly lower intake of fibre (brown bread, salad,vegetables and fruits) than patients without manifest diabetes (1.7\u00b11.4 times per day compared to 4.4\u00b11.4 times), and a higher intake of meat products (2.1\u00b11.1 times per day compared to 1.8\u00b10.9 times). Reported intake of soft drink was lower in diabetics (0.8\u00b10.8 times per day) compared to non-diabetics (1.3\u00b11.0 times per day), no differences could be found with respect to the reported alcohol intake.",

Methods: Data on women 35-70 y were from two nationally representative stratified clustered samples in 1996/97 (n=1506) and 2005 (n=3045). Body mass index (BMI)=weight/height 2 >=30kg/m\u00b2 defined obesity and waist circumference in cm (WC) abdominal fat accumulation. Results: Nationally, from 1996 to 2005, mean(s.e.)

Because the prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing dramatically among women in reproductive age mainly, in Portugal investigations that relate to the maternal obesity breastfeeding are necessary, which is the main purpose of this study warning of the importance of a pregnancy planned and this point to the importance of controlling weight. Methods: In the sample were included all primiparous mothers of singletons (n = 680) aged between 19 and 40 years, whose son was born between 24 May and 31 October 2007 in the Hospital de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Centro Hospital of Vila Nova de Gaia and Unidade Local de Sa\u00fade of Matosinhos, SA, which tried to breastfeed after birth. Body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy and gestacional weight gain were categorized according to guideline from the Institute of Medicine. Results: Regardless of gestacional weight gain, overweight/obese women ( =0,029) were less likely to initiate breastfeeding (defined as the child to be breastfed exclusively with breast milk until at least the first two weeks post-partum) than women with a normal BMI before pregnancy. Because the follow-up (telephone interviews will be made after two weeks, two months and six months post-partum) isn't over yet, results can not be accurate described about the duration of breastfeeding, however it is expected that both obesity before pregnancy and inadequate gestacional weight gain have a negative effect on breastfeeding practice.",

Therefore a great number of different treatment programmes have been developed in recent years, focusing on different aspects of therapy as nutrition, activity or psychosocial issues. But only few interventions have been evaluated regarding effectiveness and long-term results. Objective: Based on this starting point the Federal Centre for Health Education (FCHE) decided to initiate an observational study to give an overview of the effectiveness of obesity treatment in Germany. Two main issues were: What effects did the interventions have on the physical and mental conditions of the patients? What key factors (e. g. therapy concept and intensity) influenced the therapy results? Method: The nationwide observational study started in 2006 as a longitudinal trial. The interventions were grouped in six clusters (1. inpatient treatment 2. day-cases treatment 3. outpatient treatment with focus on a) nutrition b) activity c) psychosocial issues or d) multi disciplinary approach) Main outcome measures were BMI-SDS, comorbidity (blood pressure, lipid profile), quality of life and behaviour modification. Medical and psychological data were collected before and after the intervention, interval depending on the length of treatment. Follow-up data is collected one year after the end of intervention. Participants: 1976 children and youth aged from 8-16 years (mean 12.4 years) with a BMI above the 90 th percentile. Results: First results show a significant reduction of the degree of obesity in all intervention clusters. The mental condition showed a significant improvement after intervention, especially with inpatient-programmes.",

Methods: population-based cross-sectional study including 3213 women and 2912 men aged 35-75 years. Body fat percentage (%BF) was assessed using electric bioimpedance. Obesity was defined using established cut-points for body mass index (BMI) and waist, and three population-defined cut-points for %BF. Between-criteria agreement was assessed by the kappa statistic. Results: in men, agreement between the %BF cut-points was significantly higher (kappa values in the range 0.78 -0.86) than with BMI or waist (0.47 -0.62), whereas no such differences were found in women (0.41 -0.69). In both genders, prevalence of obesity varied considerably according to the criteria used: 17% and 24% according to BMI and waist in men, and 14% and 31%, respectively, in women. For %BF, the prevalence varied between 14% and 17% in men and between 19% and 36% in women according to the cut-point used. In the older age groups, a fourfold difference in the prevalence of obesity was found when different criteria were used. Among subjects with at least one criteria for obesity (increased BMI, waist or %BF), only one third fulfilled all three criteria and one quarter two criteria. Less than half of women and 64% of men were jointly classified as obese by the three population-defined cut-points for %BF. Conclusions: the different anthropometric criteria to define obesity show a relatively poor agreement between them, leading to considerable differences in the prevalence of obesity in the general population.

Those disorders are discovered very often accidentally. There is a progressive increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes worldwide, due to the dramatic augmentation of obesity. Methods: We analysed 149 patients of our Department to determine the existing disorders in carbohydrate metabolism. The inclusion criterion was the BMI > 30 kg/m 2 . We exclude the patients with secondary obesity, previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus t. 2. In every patient we made the anthropometric measurement (weight, height, BMI, waist, hip, % body fat). We analysed also blood lipids, systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure. To examine carbohydrate metabolism we done the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in every patient. Results: The average age of analysed population was 48,8 +/-13,0 years, BMI 38,1 +/-7,7 kg/m 2 , % fat 43,4 +/-10,0. The average SBP was 140,0 +/-21,5 mmHg, DBP 87,9 +/-12,8 mmHg, total cholesterol 5,3 +/-1,2 mm0l/l, HDL 1,1 +/-0,3 mmol/l, LDL 3,2 +/-1,0 mmol/l, TAG 2,1 +/-1,8 mmol/l. In analysed group of 149 obese patients according to OGTT we found 21 patients with new diabetes mellitus (14 % of population) and 53 patients with impaired glucose tolerance (36%). Conclusion: 1. In about 50% of obese patients we found disorders in carbohydrate metabolism. 2. OGTT is a valuable and simple test in searching for diabetes mellitus. In every patients with obesity we should consider the OGTT.",

In addition to counseling programs the diagnosis of metabolic disease or cardiovascular disorders could be of influence on the patient`s motivation to lose body weight. Methods: Clinical and laboratory results of 3193 patients attending a medical outdoor center were evaluated. Diagnosis and the need for medication were compared between patients with a successful weight loss and those with a continuous weight gain during an observation period of 11 years. Results: In the female study population (n=1844) the percentage of patients with normal BMI was 46%, with overweight 19%, with obesity 22% and with morbid obesity 2%. In the male study population (n=1349) 44% of the patients revealed a normal BMI, 40% were overweight, 10% obese and 1% morbidly obese. A counseling program comprising dietary instructions and recommendations for physical activity was offered to all overweight and obese patients.

Introduction: Obesity in adolescence is becoming a public health concern in developing countries. However, few data are available concerning its prevalence and related factors. This study aimed at assessing the overweight prevalence of adolescents and its correlated factors in Tunisia. Methodology: This cross-sectional study, based on a multistage stratified random cluster sample, representative of 3 contrasted socioeconomic regions in Tunisia, was carried out in 2005 on 1019 adolescents aged 15-19 years. Socioeconomic characteristics, anthropometric measures, food consumption (from which diet patterning and quality index were derived) and physical activity behaviour characteristics were recorded during home visits. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify overweight's correlates. Results: Prevalence of overweight (>=85 th perc), and obesity (>=95 th perc) ((NCHS-WHO reference) were respectively 18.9% and 4.3% (15.2% and 2.6% -IOTF definition). Prevalence of overweight increased significantly by socioeconomic level of region (from 3.7% to 22.9%) and was higher in urban (21.5%) than rural areas (8.1%) for boys; whereas no significant difference was found for girls. Overweight was related to diet structure and quality for boys only. After adjustment, overweight was positively associated to living in an urban area, higher educational level of the mother, sedentary lifestyle and irregular afternoon snacking, for boys, It was positively related to school dropout and the higher level of mother's education for girls. Conclusion: Overweight in late adolescence has become a true public health problem in Tunisia. Girls were exposed equally to overweight in rural and urban areas whereas it was more related to the westernization of lifestyle for boys. Results: Among the entire study population overweight was 23,9%, obesity 7,3% and CO 35,5%.Boys were more obese than girls(9,2% vs 5,3%, p<0,05) but CO was equal in 2 sexes(36,6% vs 34,3%, p=0,48).Obesity reduced significantly as age increased(from 10,3% in age 6-9 to 3,3% in age 10-12, p<0,001), but not CO(33,5% in age 6-9, 33,7% in age 10-12, p=0,18 There was also a significant correlation of CO with the frequency of JF consumption and the time of TV/PC usage.Certain aspects of eating habits seems to associated with obesity in our population, giving us a field of preventing interventions.",

Little is known regarding its prevalence in the general population or which cut-offs for BF should be used. Methods: convenience sample of 1,523 Portuguese adults. BF was measured by validated hand-held bioimpedance. NWO was defined as a BMI<25 kg/m 2 and a %BF mass>30%, along other published criteria. Results: prevalence of NWO was 10.1% in women and 3.2% in men. In women, prevalence of NWO increased considerably with age, and virtually all women aged over 55 with a BMI<25 kg/m 2 were actually considered as NWO. Using gender specific cut-offs for BF (29.1% in men and 37.2% in women) led to moderately lower of NWO in women. Using gender-and age-specific cut-points for %BF considerably decreased the prevalence of NWO in women (0.5 to 2.5% depending on the criterion) but not in men (1.9 to 3.4%). Conclusions: gender-and age-specific or at least gender-specific, instead of single cut-offs for %BF, should be used to characterize and study NWO.",

These problems are considerable even in affluent states of Iran like East Azerbaijan state (E.A.S). So the aim of this study is determination of malnutrition Status of under 5-year children of E.A.S and comparison with the whole under 5-year children in Iran. Materials and methods: Study design was observational-cross sectional. Samples collected with systematic cluster method. Sample size for the whole Iran (28 states) and for E.A.S was 7158 and 334 households, respectively. Weight and height was measured with standard methods and recorded to nearest 100g and 0.1 cm, respectively. Then weight for height, weight for age, height for age Z scores was calculated. Data were analyzed by MACCESS, MESXEL and SPSS (version 11.5) software. Results: The prevalence of moderate and severe underweight and stunting (WAZ and HAZ <-2SD NCHS/CDC/WHO) of E.A.S in comparison with the whole Iran was 11% in contrast with 10.4% and 15.4% in contrast with 11.4%, respectively and the prevalence of obesity (WHZ >2SD NCHS/CDC/WHO) was 4% in contrast with 2.8% . Conclusion: Findings suggest that despite of the higher prevalence of obesity of E.A.S in comparison with the whole Iran, underweight and stunting is higher than the mean of whole Iran too. So, planning for improvement of consumption pattern's quality of less than 5 years old children of E.A.S is necessary. Key words: malnutrition, under 5 year children, East Azerbaijan state, Iran. performance, anthropometry and functional measurements as handgrip strength and blood pressure. In 2005, 59.4% of the original group was interviewed, 20,7 % were died and 19.9% were lost to follow-up. Mortality data were obtained from death certificates of the National Civil Registry. All the available people free of functional limitation in 2000 was evaluated in 2005 to determine the risk (logistic regression) of having mobility limitations according baseline dinamometry, BMI, waist circumference and other chronic conditions. Survival estimates according BMI were also calculated. Results: The 5y survival probability was 0,526 for the people with BMI 18.5-24.9 and 0.956 for the individuals with BMI 30. Kaplan Mier survival estimates according dynamometry adjusted by BMI, demonstrates higher survival rates for the people over the p25 of dynamometry (men= 27 Kg, women =15 Kg). The logistic model demonstrates that among anthropometric variables, only hand grip strength was associated (negatively) with 5-y risk of having 2 mobility limitations in both men (b= -221, p=0.002) and women (b= -230, p<0.001).",

Methods: Twenty-six (96%) public and 17 (74%) private schools allow to in-site evaluation of foods available for selling at school. We evaluated 2002 adolescents (participation 78%). Food intake was evaluated using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. As cardiovascular risk factors we measured body mass index, blood pressure, glucose, insulin, the homeostasis model method (HOMA-IR), triglycerides, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Results: A total of 49 machines were present in 22 schools. Machines that only sold beverages (carbonated beverages in three fourths) were present in 11 schools, and 6 schools had machines that exclusively sold chocolates. School cafeterias also sold unhealthy foods, as chocolate bars (33 cafeterias-82.5%), cakes and doughnuts (36 cafeterias-90.0%), candies, gums and popcorn (13 cafeterias-32.5%), and snack mix (6 cafeterias-15.0%). In public schools with food vending machines adolescents reported a significantly higher median (inter quartile range) daily intake of chocolate bars (7.1g (3.3-7.1) vs. 3.3g (0-7.1), p=0.018). After adjustment, students enrolled in public schools with vending machines presented significantly lower risk of overweight (OR:0.60, CI95%:0.42-0.86), and of a blood pressure above the 95 th percentile (OR:0.75, CI95%:0.58-0.98) and lower fasting blood glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR. Conclusions: Portuguese school environment not encouraging healthy food choices, with a strong availability of unhealthy foods. Higher intakes of chocolate bars were founded in schools with vending machines but its presence is not associated with an unfavorable cardiovascular risk profile.

So the aim of this pilot study is determination of relation between physical activity and overweight and obesity in 20-50 years old women living in the north of Tehran, Iran, 2007. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, women living in the north of Tehran, was selected with clustered systematic method and with recourse to their home. Anthropometric data of weight (precision of 100g), height and waist (precision of 0.1cm) were measured with standard methods and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Physical activity level (P.A.L) was obtained with a standard questionnaire via interviewing. This questionnaire was designed with the basis of P.A.L. In this questionnaire, at first amount of each P.A.L was calculated with basis of metabolic equivalent (MET). Then the time which was spent for each activity in a day was multiplied in MET of each activity. Sum of these amounts showed the total P.A.L (MET-h/day) .MET 29 was considered as active people. Data was analyzed by SPSS, version13 software. Results: 38% of subjects were overweight (25 BMI<30), 15.5% obese (BMI 30), 38% had central obesity (waist>88cm).After adjustment for age, Active women had 45% less odds for overweight and obesity(OR=0.55;95%CI:0.15-2.00) and 34% less odds for central obesity(0.66;0.19-2.29) than other women . Conclusion: Findings suggest that higher physical activity is in relation with less risk for overweight and obesity in these women. Key words: physical activity, overweight, obesity, women, North of Tehran, Iran Objective: Obesity is a major risk factor for diabetes. In Mexico 70% of the population is obese and diabetes is the first cause of death. Leptin, an adipocyte secreted protein, plays a major role in food intake and energy balance regulation. Mammes discovered a G\u03b1A polymorphism at locus -2549 in the promoter of the leptin gene, which is related to obesity in western population. We investigated the possible association between this polymorphism and DM2. Methods and Results: One hundred eighty four patients and 204 controls were examined for the presence of polymorphism G-2548\u03b1A using PCR-RFLP. Assay clinic and laboratory characteristics were measured. We found statistical differences in tobacco index, glucose, HDL and triglycerides. The polymorphism was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The frequency of the G allele was significantly different in patients compared with controls. We found association of the G allele in the diabetic patients group (OR 1.77, IC 95% and p<0.05).When we analyzed the frequency of allele G between males and females, we found that the allele G in male has association with DM2 (OR 2.4, IC 95% and p= 0.006).",

Is the first time that this is described. (1996) 12.09% of boys and 9.42% of girls had BF% above 25%, while 6.96% of boys and 2.67% of girls had BF% above 30%. The findings of this study may be helpful in identifying children at risk for adolescent obesity and obesity-related disorders, as well as in providing an opportunity for earlier intervention. Abdominal obesity increases the risk for development of cardiovascular disease and diabetes type 2. Several anthropometric measures have been proposed as a good predictors of cardiovascular risk and it is still under discussion which measure best reflects the level of cardiovascular risk. The aim of our study was to examine correlations between anthropometric indicators of abdominal obesity and metabolic risk factors in regard to the nutritional level, as well as in regard to age. Study group consisted of 881 subjects (291males and 590 females). Nutritional level was assessed using BMI, while adiposity (BF%) was assessed using bioelectrical impedance method. We analyzed following abdominal anthropometric indicators: waist circumference (WC), waist to height ratio (WHTR), sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) and SAD to height ratio (SADH). Blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-and LDL-cholesterol, fasting glucose, index of atherosclerosis, fibrinogen and uric acid were measured. SAD and SADH were better predictors of risk in normal weight males, while WC and WHTR were better predictors in normal weight females. In overweight and obese subjects WC and WHTR correlated stronger with risk factors, comparing to SAD and SADH. Reliability of all anthropometric indicators in risk prediction decreased with aging in males, while in females relationship between anthropometric indicators and risk factors was stronger in subjects younger that 30y and in subjects older than 50y. SAD was the best predictor of BF% in normal weight males and in overweight males. Best predictors of BF% in normal weight and overweight females were WC and WHTR, respectively. Background: Obesity is defined as an excess accumulation of body fat, but there are few studies about the usefulness of percent body fat for diagnosis of childhood obesity. Methods: Anthropometries, blood pressure, blood sample, and body composition analysis using bioelectrical impedance analysis were obtained from 1,021 Korean obese elementary and middle school students. The correlations between the obesity indices such as body mass index (BMI), percentage-weight-for-height (PWH), and percent body fat (PBF) and metabolic risk factors were measured after controlling age and sex. Results: PBF was significantly correlated with systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR. However, the correlation coefficients between PBF and metabolic risk factors were higher comparing with those between metabolic risk factors and BMI or PWH. Odds ratios for high systolic pressure, high triglycerides, low HDLcholesterol and insulin resistance in obese children diagnosed by over 35% of PBF were the lowest compared with odds ratios in obese children diagnosed by above the 95th percentile of BMI and over 120% of PWH. Conclusions: The percent body fat as a diagnostic tool for predicting metabolic abnormalities in Korean obese children was not superior to BMI or PWH.",

Data from these 42 mother-child pairs residing in the same household was used. A questionnaire examining the quantity and quality of the dietary habits, as well as the adherence to the traditional Mediterranean dietary model has been distributed in mothers of both groups. A regression analysis of dietary maternal factors associated with childhood obesity or the risk-for-overweight has been performed using the SPSS programme. Results: Accordingly to our findings, more than half of the boys and girls of urban area (54% and 60%, respectively) were either overweight or at-risk-for-overweight. Obese mothers were twice as likely to have an overweight and/or at-risk-foroverweight child compared with normal-weight mothers. Women born in urban areas were twice as likely to have an overweight and/or at-risk-for-overweight child compared with women born in rural areas. On the contrary, maternal obesity in rural areas is not linked with either child overweight or risk-for-overweight. Discussion: The high prevalence of overweight or at-risk-for-overweight among children of low socioeconomic status in urban area suggests a continued need to develop and practice certain informative programs targeted to low socioeconomic populations. Health professionals who get in touch with such populations should inform accurate the overweight persons and perform dietary and BMI controls repeatingly.",

However, assessment method of DIT is difficult if the total thermogenic response is required. We wanted to develop an alternative technique of computing DIT using data obtained from respiration chamber measurements. Such information in the Japanese population has been lacking. Methods: 49 females and 27 males Japanese subjects stayed in the chamber for 24h. The DIT due to total feeding over the day (for 15h) was evaluated using a traditional principle that calculates the difference between the energy expenditure (EE) without physical activity (PA) (from the intercept of regression equation of EE and PA index) and basal metabolic rate. We proposed 3 indices for evaluating PA, i.e. time duration, intensity and volume (duration*intensity) of PA assessed using a traditional Doppler radar technique and a validated accelerometer, respectively. Results: The DIT, expressed as a percentage of the total energy ingested, averaged 8.1+/-4.7% when the time duration was used for the calculation, and 5.9+/-4.8% when the PA intensity was used. The DIT of 11.4+/-3.8% was found when the volume of PA was accounted for. This combined index had the advantages in terms of goodness of fit of the regression equation with EE (p<0.05), and in provided a relatively reasonable results, as compared to the other two indices. Conclusion: Our improved method based on the traditional principle could partly help to overcome the shortcomings of the previous technique. This technique also brings more consistent results with the literature of computing DIT at a group level.",

Goal: The goal of the treatment was: awareness of eating habits, controlling the eating habits, adopting healthy eating habits and everyday physical activity, reducing body weight for 5% in 6 months, reducing waist line Methods: Body weight and height, Body mass index, blood pressure, waist and hip line were measured before the treatment. Also laboratory tests and behavior-cognitive interviews were conducted. The treatment consisted 15 sessions, 8 sessions once a week, 4 twice a month and 3 once a month. Different techniques were used: Behavioral (self observing, behavior testing, operative conditioning, distractions, and coping cards), cognitive (cognitive restructuration, problem solving, positive self statements), relaxational (abdominal breathing, imagination). Results: Healthy eating knowledge was improved and waist line was reduced from 112 cm to 108 cm. Healthy eating attitudes and everyday physical activity was partially accomplished. Reducing the body weight was not accomplished at the end but in the middle of treatment body weight was dropped. Food choice is influenced by many interrelated factors, among others aging and obesity status. People's food preferences vary during aging. In particular, elderly people show a decrease in pleasantness associated with food intake as a result of both physiological and psychological factors. They are very specific in their flavour and textural requirements and therefore more demanding. It has also been theorized that overweight is related to unhealthy (i.e. energy-dense food) food preferences. Therefore the aim of this work was to examine sensory acceptability of breakfast cereals in different weight categories of elderly people and to determine whether crispy and mashed texture had influence on these preferences. A 7-point verbal hedonic scale was used to determine the level of acceptance for all samples. Research involved 218 (146 females and 72 males) institutionalized elderly people, age 55 to 93 (mean age 75.7). The mean hedonic score for all participants was 4.92 and 4.84 for mashed, and 4.05 and 3.73 for crispy strawberry and chocolate cornflakes, respectively. Pearson's correlation showed that obesity status had influence on choice; overweight and obese participants had better preference towards all provided cornflakes. Furthermore, we affirmed the hypothesis that food texture has influence on elderly people preferences. They significantly prefer mashed texture (p<0.001 for both strawberry and chocolate cornflakes). In conclusion, this research emphasised the thesis that overweight and obese elderly people have an enhanced liking for cornflakes regardless of taste and texture. Key words: cornflakes, overweight status, sensory acceptability, elderly people Background: Many previous studies have shown that children with obese parents could have different anthropometric characteristics, leading to the development of obesity in comparison with those with non-obese parents. The aim of this study was to compare characteristic physical growth in children with obese and those with non-obese mothers.",

The heights and weights were measured by standard methods. Anthropometric indicators such as weight for age, height for age and weight for height were compared with NCHS as reference. Mothers with body mass index above 25 kg/m 2 were defined as obese mothers. Results: Low weight for height had an overall prevalence of 6.3% that was higher in children with obese mother than in those with non-obese mother (5.1%). It is estimated that prevalence higher than 5% is indicative of an increasing some major nutritional deficiencies in the population. The prevalence of low weight for age (7.3%) and small height for age (8.3%) and big weight for age (4.7%) in children with obese mothers were lower than in those with non-obese mothers. Conclusion: Based on the results the most affected anthropometric indicator was the weight for height that shows a mild malnutrition in subjects. Characteristic indicators observed in children with obese mothers showed a strong relationship between child and mother body compositions. Educational programs to promote mothers nutritional knowledge will be required to prevent further nutritional problems in children.",

Introduction: Linkage and association studies in humans and results from animal models suggest a role for the melanocortin 3 receptor gene (MC3R) in obesity. Aim: to assess the association between genetic polymorphisms of MC3R with childhood obesity and insulin resistance in Chilean families. Subjects and Methods: We recruited 160 obese children (6-12 years-old; BMI above P 95 of NCHS/CDC 2000) from which we selected 180 parents in 90 caseparent trios. The genotypes of MC3R Thr6Lys, Val81Ile, -239A>G, +2138InsCAGACC and D20s32e were determined by PCR-RFLP and capillary electrophoresis techniques. In order to adjust insulin levels by age and pubertal status in children, a z-score for Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) was calculated using Chilean reference data (Burrows et al. Rev Med Chile 2006; 134: 1417 -1426 . The Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT) was calculated to assess genotypeobesity associations while non-parametric tests were used to compare HOMA measurements across study groups defined by MC3R genotypes in children. Results: Frequencies of -239G, 17A, 241A and +2138InsCAGACC alleles were estimated as 5.3%, 4.8%, 4.1% and 16.1% respectively. TDT in case-parent trios revealed no significant genotype-obesity associations for any of the genetic variants including the D20s32e marker. Likewise, no significant differences were found when comparing z-scores of HOMA across MC3R genotypes in children, although a nonstatistical trend is observed for higher HOMA values in carriers of -239G and +2138InsCAGACC alleles versus non carriers. Conclusion: There are no sufficient evidences to support a role for MC3R variants in childhood obesity or insulin resistance in Chilean families. Supported by FONDECYT 1061096.",

Introduction: Obesity is associated with poor mood and elevated indices of depression. The 'small changes' programme is a seven week 'course' which involves subjects selecting weekly 'challenges' that involve positive dietary change and increased energy expenditure. The challenges were chosen with 2 facilitators (nutritionist and counselor) who ensured these were realistic and measurable. Method: 18 Subjects, 13 female and 5 male (BMI 36.4 \u00b1 9.38 kg/m 2 , age 45.08 \u00b1 11.02yrs) were separated into an experimental and control group for the small changes programme. Controls were given healthy eating information. The experimental group completed 7 weekly two-hour sessions focusing on selecting goals for weight management. The general well being scale (GWB, Dupuy 1978 ) was used to measure affective state. This was recorded at baseline and week 7. Participants' challenges all related to alteration in diet or physical activity. Suggestions were not made by the facilitators. Results: using SPSS version 13 analysis showed the experimental group GWB scores had improved significantly (p=0.028)by the end of the programme from 64 to 77 (61-72 = moderate distress 73-110 = positive well being). In the control group GWB scores did not alter significantly (69.00-72.50 P=0.615 ). Conclusion: the immediate results of the small changes intervention where subjects self-select dietary and physical activity goals facilitated by a behavioural change expert and a nutritionist show a positive improvement in affective state. Continued development of the small changes programme and analysis of self-selected goals with a larger cohort is warranted. Follow up from this trial will go on for five years. We followed the risk factors for obesity. Results: Next factors were present to our patients:increased birth weight-15 cases,consume of the artificial milk rather than breastfeeding in infancy-48 cases,low mother's education level-35 cases,supersized meals-50 cases,high fat diets-40 cases,consume of a variety of energy-dense foods-50 cases,unlimited access to foods-50 cases,sedentary behaviour-50 cases,parental fatness-16 cases. Our effective interventions included:comprehensive behavioral management, dietary modification and physical activity. Some of 64 adolescents studied succeeded in modifing their habits:decreasing concentrated foods-38 cases,decreasing the consumption of sweetened drinks-28 cases or of fast-food products-25 cases,improved of physical activity-30 cases. We have succeeded in parental involvment only in 35 cases. Conclusions: The family involvment remains an essential component as part of obesity management.It is urgent to propose interventions taking account all environmental factors which could cause obesity.The first outcome of obesity treatment is weight loss followed by the reduction in the severe disability related not only to clinical problems but also to the psychological, familiar and social impairment that reduce the quality and participation at everyday life in obese. To evaluate the disability we can use a new instrument: the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) developed by Word Health Organization that classifies body functions (b) and structures (s), activity and participation (d) and contextual factors (e). It may generate a functioning profile particularly in some chronic diseases. We linked the information obtained by a multidisciplinary approach to obesity with the ICF categories. Medical evaluation, with laboratory and instrumental tests, covered the domains of body function (from b1 to b8) and structures (from s1 to s8), but also, with an interview, environmental factors (e1, e2, e5). Psychological testing and interviews analyzed mental functions (b1), relationships (d7, d8, d9) and environmental factors (e3, e4, e5). Dieticians reconstructed nutritional behaviour (b5, d5, d6). Nurses, physiotherapists and movement therapists by different scales controlled the self care (d5), domestic life (d6) besides mobility (d4). This approach seems suitable to define the disability related to obesity and might recognize the different risks factors for maintenance of this condition. The impact of these information on rehabilitation program might obtain a better care profile. Furthermore, the identification and possible correction of risk conditions might drive also successfully public health programs.

Cake, waffle and milk in more than half of girls and fruit, sandwich and cake in some boys were consumed. Most of students believed that buffets' existence is necessary and majority of them stated that the status of their school buffets was medium to bad. More than half of students thought that food items of buffets were expensive, unhealthy, nonnutritive and without diversity. Conclusion: With respect to undesirable snack pattern of students, improving buffet's status which increases availability to valuable snacks is an important step to change food behaviors of students.

Background: BIA represents one of the methods for classification of body composition. As obesity refers not to excessive body weight but to the condition in which the individual has an excessive amount of body fat. Many laboratory and field assessment techniques exist for estimating a person's body composition. Goals: This work deals with a question of measuring human body compositions. The task is to find out what the role of body hydration is. The goal is to find out what effect liquid consumption has to the measurement. Methods: 6 young individuals from the university in the age group of 21 to 23 years were included in the monitoring. Average BMI was 19.8 to 24.9. All individuals were people having average values of biological parameters. The device Tanita TBF 410 was used. All individuals filled in the medical history form. All drank 1.5 liter of water. Measurements were taken before drinking, 1 hour after drinking, then 30 minutes later and the last measurement was taken before going to toilet. Introduction: Life style is an effective factor for development of obesity especially in children. This study was carried out to examine the prevalence of obesity, and to study of the physical activity and food intake pattern of preschool children in high socio-economic families in Tehran. Methods: In a cross sectional study 60 children 2-5 years old were studied, randomly. Height and weight were measured using standard method. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was calculated using two physical growth indicators such as weight for age (W/A) and weight for height (W/H). Children's levels of physical activity pattern and frequency food intake were assessed through questionnaires. Levels of inactivity were assessed using the mother's report of the time the children spent watching TV, playing computer games and sleeping time.",

In 59% of children total hours of TV and computer viewing was in the acceptable range. Mean sleeping time in 62%was acceptable. 80% of children did not have daily intake of meat and vegetables groups and 67% of children had highest intake level of dairy products and fruit. Conclusion: Obesity and overweight are high in these children and it is accompanied by different level of inactivity, imbalance of food intake as a usual characteristic of the life style in this population. Administration of targeted health programs in different level of community with focus on the empowerment of mothers is necessary.",

However, their knowledge on the evaluation of PA is rather scanty and at least in Switzerland the time available to do it is extremely limited. The objective was to develop a quick questionnaire in order to make aware the GP's about the different components of PA and to know which component could be enhanced. 80 patients of normal to obese BMIs were studied in a single general practice. First, the patients were all interviewed by one GP, using the 5-min-PA. The latter was based on 8 items, selectively exploring the components of daily PA (occupational, non-occupational, transport, leisure, sports) and inactivity (TV, computer, sitting activities). It used a simple scoring system, which allows combining inactivity (-points) to activity factors (+ points) to get a global picture of PA. It used only 3 categories: Low (L), Medium (M) and high (H) PA. The validity of the questionnaire was checked using an objective estimate of PA (electronic pedometers) assessing total number of steps/day over one consecutive week. L level corresponded to 3'460 steps/d (range: 1'844-5'786), M to 7'210 steps/d (5'082-9'210) & H to 10'320 steps/d (7'228-14'213), with a significant difference among groups (ANOVA, p< .01). This global PA assessment check list allows distinguishing 3 broad categories of PA. Acceptance of this questionnaire by GP's remains to be further determined. It could improve awareness and may provide some help for the the diagnosis and prescription of PA in inactive overweight and obese patients.",

            "text": "International Journal of Obesity Despite the high prevalence of obesity among children and adults in industrialized countries, the causes of obesity are poorly elucidated. Among others, infant feeding mode may have a role in later development of obesity. Researchers have hypothesized that breast-feeding may be protective against obesity later in life, but the evidences are inconclusive. In this study data were collected by retrospective insight into medical charts of 203 infants from rural part of Eastern Croatia. Data encompassed infant feeding mode (based on a mother's self-report) and anthropometric parameters (body weight, length) collected at regular intervals (birth, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months) . The infants were divided into 4 groups: infants exclusively breast-fed until 6 months of age, formula fed infants, infants exclusively breast-fed until 4 months and than fed by formula, and infants fed by cow's milk. Anthropometric characteristics of all infant groups were similar at birth, but after 6 and 12 months period group of those exclusively breast-fed until the 4 months of age and than bottle-fed by formula achieved highest weight gain, followed by cow's milk bottle-fed infants, and formula bottle-fed infants, while exclusively breast-fed infants had lowest weight gain. Height gain order was similar. Most of the children in all observed groups achieved weight-for-age and height-forage prescribed by the National Centre for Health Statistics standards. Due to that fact, tendency of achieving higher percentile values in some of the observed groups, indicating higher possibility of obesity development later across the life-span will be additionally evaluated on the basis of weight-for-height scores and z-scores.",

Introduction: Melanocortin 4 receptor gene (MC4R) mutations are the most frequent cause among the rare monogenic forms of human obesity. However, no reports of MC4R mutations are available in South America populations. Aim: to estimate the frequency of MC4R variants in Chilean obese children and adults. Subjects and Methods: We have selected 160 Chilean obese children (6-12 yearsold; BMI above p95 according to NCHS/CDC 2000) and 23 Chilean obese adult women (age range: 25-73 years old; Body Mass Index -BMI-range: 31-54 Kg./m 2 ). The single exon of MC4R gene (geneID 4160; 18q22) was amplified through Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and sequenced using two overlapping PCR products. Additionally, Single Strand Conformational Polymorphism analysis (SSCP) and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis were carried out in some DNA samples to search/confirm the presence of genetic variants. Results: A 449C>T (Thr150Ile) substitution, previously described in populations of South European countries, was identified in heterozygous status in an obese woman (BMI = 41.2 Kg/m 2 ; % body fat = 38.7%) through SSCP techniques and direct sequencing followed by a confirmation using PCR-RFLP. The observation of adiposity indexes in a three-generation family ascertained through the index case suggested a co-segregation of the 150Ile variant with severe obesity. Additionally, two obese children were detected as carriers of the Val103Ile variant in MC4R gene. Conclusion: We have estimated a low frequency of MC4R mutations in Chilean obese subjects and a co-segregation of Thr150Ile with severe obesity in a three generation Chilean family. Supported by FONDECYT 1061096. Obesity is a chronic disease with a high clinical and psychiatric comorbidity. Discrimination and unsuccessful long-term treatments may cause and/or intensify mental disorders. In our sample, anxiety and depression symptoms stand out and patients show characteristics of ego weakness, emotions constriction, dependence on bonds and a non-appropriate performance to self resources. It would be necessary to consider these aspects into the multidisciplinary approach of the pathology and to go more deeply, in future researches, into its knowledge.",

            "text": "Little is known about the long-term effects of dietary energy density (ED) on weight gain. Objective: To assess the long-term relationship between changes of dietary ED and agerelated weight gain. Methods: We conducted a prospective study of 50,026 women (mean age: 36.5; SD: 4.6) in the Nurses' Health Study II followed from 1991 to 1999. Dietary ED and body weight were ascertained in 1991, 1995, and 1999 . Total dietary ED was calculated by dividing each subject's daily energy intake (kcal) by the reported weight (g) of all foods consumed. Results: Dietary ED was positively correlated with saturated fat (r=0.16), trans fat (r=0.15), and the glycemic index (r=0.16), but inversely correlated with vegetable protein (r=-0.30), vegetables (r=-0.27), and fruits (r=-0.17). Women who increased their dietary ED during follow-up the most (5 th quintile) had a significantly greater multivariate-adjusted weight gain as compared with those who most decreased their dietary ED (1 st quintile) (8-y time period: 6.42 kg versus 4.57 kg; p for trend < 0.001). However, the amount of weight change over time varied considerably according to the ED of individual foods and beverages. Conclusion: Increases in total dietary ED were associated with long-term weight gain among middle-aged women. However, public health recommendations cannot be made simply based on ED values of individual foods and beverages only. Reducing consumption of foods high in saturated and trans fats and refined carbohydrates and increasing fruits and vegetables consumption may help to reduce dietary ED and prevent weight gain.",
