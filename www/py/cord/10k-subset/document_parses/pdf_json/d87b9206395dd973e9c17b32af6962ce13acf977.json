Some lymphomas have a very rapid fulminant course. HHV-8 has also been reported to be a cause of lymphoma. The role of CMV in the development of lymphoma is not clear, though both CMV and HHV-8 have been reported in tissues adjacent to the tumour in Burkitt lymphoma patients. Here we present a patient with asymptomatic HIV infection, that contracted a primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) infection. Three weeks before onset of symptoms the patient had unprotected sex which could be possible source of his CMV and also HHV-8 infection He deteriorated rapidly and died with a generalized anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Methods: A Caucasian homosexual male with asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection contracted a primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) infection. He deteriorated rapidly and died with a generalized anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Clinical and laboratory records were compiled. Immunohistochemistry was performed on lymphoid tissues, a liver biopsy, a bone marrow aspirate and the spleen during the illness and at autopsy. Serology and PCR for HIV, CMV, EBV, HHV-1-3 and 6-8 was performed on blood drawn during the course of disease. Results: The patient presented with an acute primary CMV infection. Biopsies taken 2 weeks before death showed a small focus of ALCL in one lymph node of the neck. Autopsy demonstrated a massive infiltration of ALCL in lymph nodes, liver, spleen and bone marrow. Blood samples confirmed primary CMV-infection, a HHV-8 infection together with reactivation of Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Conclusion: Primary CMV-infection and concomitant HHV-8 infection correlated with reactivation of EBV. We propose that these two viruses influenced the development and progression of the lymphoma. Quantitative PCR blood analysis for EBV, CMV and HHV-8 could be valuable in diagnosis and treatment of this type of very rapidly developing lymphoma. It is also a reminder of the importance of prevention and prophylaxis of several infections by having protected sex. [1, 2] . As the majority of HIV-infected patients are CMV-seropositive at the time of seroconversion little is known about primary CMV infection in HIV-patients with or without severe immunodeficiency. Recently two case reports have been published [3, 4] . The first case was a pregnant HIV positive woman on antiretroviral therapy, who was diagnosed with primary CMV-infection after 30 weeks gestation. She was treated with intravenous ganciclovir iv for a week and thereafter valacyclovir orally until the end of pregnancy. She was CMV-PCR negative after 4 weeks treatment, and delivered after 37 weeks' gestation a small child (2.07 kg) in whom a prenatal CMV infection could be ruled out. The second case was a probable primary co-infection with HIV and CMV. A 25-year-old Caucasian male developed meningitis, hepatitis, myelopathy in the legs and retinal cotton wool spots at examination of the eyes but no CMV-retinitis. He was treated with combination antiretroviral therapy (c-ART) for the HIV-infection. During 10 weeks he developed IgG and IgM antibodies to CMV, HIV-RNA in the blood was 386 000 copies and CMV-PCR was 690 copies/ml. The CD4 count was 801 \u00d7 106/L. He improved upon continued c-ART, even if he did not receive CMV-treatment. However the authors conclude that the overlapping manifestations of acute HIV-1 and CMV makes it difficult to determine how each virus infection contributed to his condition. None of these primary CMV-infection cases were associated with lymphoma or other tumour development. That CMV might be involved in the development of PTLD has been suggested [5] . Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV) is related to several types of malignant lymphomas, especially in HIV-infected patients, and also to post-transplant lymph proliferative disorder (PTLD) [5, 6] . HHV-8 is linked to Kaposi's sarcoma, Castleman's disease and to some lymphomas [7] . One HHV-8 associated ALCL has been documented in a HIVpositive patient [8] . In this patient there was no sign of EBV in the tumour but EBV-reactivation and CMV infection was not investigated. A malignant lymphoma in an HIV-positive patient with EBV and HHV-8 co infection has recently been described by Crane et al. [9] . This patient died within 3 months of diagnosis of the lymphoma. An ALCL with very rapid progression has also been described by Mosunjac et al. [10] . The development of HHV-8 infection is not as well described as the infection with the other human herpes viruses. Hladik et al. [11] studied serocorversion time after blood transfusion and found that most HHV-8 negative patients serocorverted in three to ten weeks after transfusion with HHV-8 seropositive blood. Similar seroconvertion times was also found by Sergeric et al and Gentile at al in patients after Bone Marrow Transplantation [12, 13] . Two cases of fatal disseminated Kaposi's sarcoma following HHV-8 primary infections has been described by Marcelin et al. [14] . They died at 5 and 6 months after transplantation after a disease course of 3 to 4 weeks. Abate et al. [15] recently demonstrated other human herpes viruses than EBV in eight patients with Burkitt lymphoma. They found four patients with CMV in the adjacent non-neoplastic tissue, three with HHV-8 and in one patient EBV, CMV, HHV-8 and HTLV-1 was found simultaneously. All viruses were detected by immunohistochemistry and they suggest that these viruses might be a contributing factor to lymphoma development.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 464, "end": 467, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 468, "end": 470, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 712, "end": 715, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 716, "end": 718, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2064, "end": 2067, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2248, "end": 2251, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2252, "end": 2254, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2336, "end": 2339, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2413, "end": 2416, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2659, "end": 2662, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2808, "end": 2812, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2943, "end": 2947, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3255, "end": 3259, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3260, "end": 3263, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3388, "end": 3392, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3498, "end": 3502, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "(Continued from previous page)"}, {"text": "Here we present an asymptomatic HIV-infected Caucasian homosexual male with a primary CMVinfection, HHV-8 infection and concomitant reactivation of EBV, who developed a malignant lymphoma leading to death within 3 weeks.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "(Continued from previous page)"}, {"text": "A 34-year old HIV-infected man presented acutely due to a 2 days' period of fatigue and fever.

Before the acute illness there were no signs or symptoms of generalised lymphoma. Three weeks before onset of symptoms the patient had unprotected sex which could be possible source of his CMV and also HHV-8 infection. The absence of CMV IgM and IgG antibodies early during the acute illness in combination with the seroconversion after 1 week, support the diagnosis of a primary CMV infection. The detection of CMV by virus isolation, rapid isolation, and by PCR [19] , concomitant with the detection of viral DNA in plasma confirmed that the patient experienced a primary CMV infection (Table 1) . Furthermore, the significant increase in CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes is compatible with such a primary infection [20] . The seroconversion for HHV-8 and the rapid HHV 8-DNA increase is consistent with active ongoing infection. The patient was probably infected at the same time as when [11] . The HHV-8 LANA antibodies was negative throughout his disease but this method is not as sensitive as the HHV-8 IFT test [14] . The earlier reports on primary CMVinfection in HIV-patients have not been linked with lymphoma nor with an aggressive and lethal course. Two previously reported cases had been treated with antiretroviral therapy [3, 4] . One was treated with gancyclovir for the CMV infection and responded with a rapid resolution of symptoms. The other had a protracted course, but the role of CMV could not be evaluated, because the symptoms could equally well be due to the concomitant primary HIV infection.

While severe CMV-related CNS disease is often found in AIDS cases, CMV has rarely been found to be directly associated with CNS lymphomas, except in one study, where CMV inclusions were found in the cerebral neoplastic cells [23] . CMV is also connected to EBV-initiated post-transplant lymph proliferative disease (PTLD) in patients after transplantations with bone marrow or solid organs [5, 6] related to the immunosuppressive therapy. A direct relationship between a primary CMV-infection, EBV reactivation and ALCL or other lymph proliferative disorders, such as PTLD, has not been reported. However the presence of CMV together with HHV-8 in the EBV driven endemic Burkitt lymphoma recently observed indicate a possible role for other herpes viruses than EBV in the development of lymphomas. In a few cases of early primary effusion Lymphoma (PEL) the neoplastic cells have shown to be co infected with EBV and HHV-8 [24] . The ALCL is considered to be a T-Cell derived lymphoma but association with EBV or HHV-8 has only been reported in a few cases [7] . In the chronic stage HIV-infection can interfere with the immune system at many levels that will facilitate tumour development (oncogenesis) as well as CMV infection. CMV was not found in the lymphoma cells but can also facilitate tumour development by interfering with the immune system. Crane et al.

Our patient had evidence of five viral infections HIV, chronic HBV, latent EBV and primary CMV and HHV-8. All of these five viruses can have contributed to the development of the lymphoma. During the course of the disease we have seen a rapid increase in CMV-DNA, EBV-DNA and HHV-8 DNA in the blood simultaneously with the development of the lymphoma supporting the earlier findings, that both EBV and HHV-8 could be involved in the tumor development. However neither HIV-RNA levels, nor the CD4/CD8 ratio changed during the course of the disease, implying that the HIVinfection was not directly influenced by the reactivation of the EBV-infection or the development of the lymphoma. However, the HIV-infection might have caused an immunodeficiency that contributed to the tumour development. HBV has only been associated with hepatocellular cancer as an effect of the chronic inflammation in the liver. There is no increased risk of haematological malignancies in HIV-patients with chronic hepatitis B compared to other HIV-infected patients as shown by Jou et al. [25] . HHV-8 infects dendrite cells and B cells [26] . HHV-8 show a very particular protein profile in latency, that has not been identified in other herpes viruses, or viruses in general [27] . During active replication viral IL6, IRF-, IRF-3, K1 and K15 are expressed maximally but they are also detected subsequently in the latent cells. IL6 is a powerful inducer of inflammation and might affect EBV-reactivation, HHV-8 infection or primary CMV infection and even contribute to oncogenic process. The complex interactions of HIV, CMV and HHV-8-and even HBV could have provided the necessary combination of immune suppression and immune stimulation for the lymphoma genesis to precede and accelerate, even though the HIV-infection was not advanced, as measured by HIV-RNA and CD4 counts. We found no primary infection or reactivation of the other human herpes viruses investigated (HSV-1 and 2, VZV, HHV-6 and 7) in this patient. A rapid course (weeks to a few months) of ALCL in a subset of patients has been reported [10] . However, in these patients the development and role of CMV, EBV and HHV8 was not investigated. It would have been interesting to know if rapid lymphoma progression in these patients was correlated to reactivation of CMV, EBV, HHV8 or other viruses. Furthermore, the increase in EBV-DNA, HHV8-DNA in blood that was found in our patient during the cause of the disease might be used as an indicator of the severity of the lymphoma that is under development in a patient with an unclear lymphoproliferative disorder and might also be of help when evaluating the therapeutic response for this lymphoma as has been suggested earlier [28] . It is relevant to look for more than one virus having a role in lymphoma development with both serology and PCR-techniques, especially if you have an unusually rapid progression of the lymphoma. If CMV-PCR increases as a sign of developing CMV-infection treatment with gancyclovir should be started immediately to prevent further deterioration caused by CMV-infection. If both CMV and HHV-8 DNA are discovered foscarnet could also be used. There is a need for optimal and early anti-CMV treatment in patients with HIV infection and a primary CMV infection as well as HHV-8 treatment if HHV-8 infection is found. Today there is no good viral prophylaxis against CMV or HHV-8 infection but there is hope of a CMVvaccine in the future. This case story is also an example of the hazard of having unprotected sex without condoms. The risk is for all HIV-infected patients, especially if the patient is CMV-seronegative.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1248, "end": 1252, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1296, "end": 1300, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1436, "end": 1440, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2270, "end": 2274, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2905, "end": 2909, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CMV-isolation, classical and rapid Positive"}, {"text": "Another issue is the need for specially designed cytostatic therapy for these lymphomas that seem to have a very poor prognosis compared to others.
