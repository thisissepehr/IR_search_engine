Seventy-two hours after sporozoite inoculation of PHHs, parasite schizonts were apparent and smaller than the hepatocyte nucleus (Fig. 2a) . Eight days later the parasite schizonts exceeded the size of the hepatocyte nucleus, but merozoite formation was disorganized and the overall growth of the in vitro schizont was stunted (Fig. 2b) .

In this study, mass spectrometry was used to identify host and malaria proteoforms from liver stages. Because an enrichment mechanism is lacking to specifically harvest schizont-containing hepatocytes, samples in this study likely contained uninfected cells, infected cells with aborted development, and infected hepatocytes with vegetative schizonts. Hence proteoforms sequenced in these studies could be derived from intact or aborted schizonts. Additionally, experiments using chimeric mouse livers that were frozen, thawed, and homogenized could generate degraded proteoforms that reflect degradation during sample preparation rather than parasite metabolic activity. Currently, these two forms cannot be distinguished. Infection of 200,000 hepatocytes with 100,000 P. falciparum sporozoites typically results in 0.1-0.2% of the cells infected with mature schizonts after 96 h post-inoculation [26] . Thus, a majority of hepatocytes inoculated with sporozoites do not mount productive infections. MudPIT sequencing from infected hepatocytes resulted in the identification of both Human and P. falciparum proteins at a ratio of 34:1 (Human: P. falciparum). The P. falciparum species represent approximately 2.9% of the total protein population. Given that so few hepatocytes are infected with mature schizonts after 96 h (postsporozoite inoculation), this result is surprising in that one might expect the ratio to be nearly 1000:1 (Human: P. falciparum proteins). Additionally, each schizont represents only a portion of the total hepatocyte mass. However, there are at least two likely reasons for this result. First, the initial parasite to hepatocyte ratio is 1:2 (during inoculation). In theory, a perfect infection, where each sporozoite gave rise to one schizont would result in 50% of hepatocytes harbouring schizonts. Inoculation only results in 0.1-0.2% of cells containing schizonts [26] . Hence, a majority of parasites must invade hepatocytes and then subsequently abort their development between 0 and 96 h post-inoculation. Proteins from sporozoites that fail to develop in hepatocytes are most likely degraded. Therefore, P. falciparum proteoform identifications from this study are likely derived from both mature schizonts and sporozoites that failed to develop. A second reason for observing an unexpectedly high number of P. falciparum peptides from these hepatocytes is mostly technical. During these experiments, the mass spectrometer isolates and fragments the most abundant peptides. After the first round of peptide isolation and fragmentation, the instrument selects for a lower abundance ion and continues to select for progressively lower abundance ions in a mode known as dynamic exclusion. Importantly, because the instrument in these studies employed dynamic exclusion mode, the number of P. falciparum proteoform identifications was enhanced.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1125, "end": 1129, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2124, "end": 2128, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "While these studies are encouraging and provide a proof-of-concept for sequencing proteoforms from liver stages, recent improvements in mass spectrometry instrumentation could enhance similar studies aimed at identifying malaria liver stage antigens. For example, the development of Tribrid instruments, containing three mass analysers in tandem are capable of identifying more spectra and are compatible with gas-phase separation techniques (such as high-field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry) (FAIMS). From a complex mixture of polypeptides, FAIMS can select proteoforms of interest that have specific size, charge, or shape characteristics [39] [40] [41] . This study and others that aim to isolate small polypeptides (similar in size to MHC Class I), often perform biochemical (often separation by MW) fractionation prior to mass spectrometry analysis [42] [43] [44] . During fractionation much of the low molecular weight polypeptides are lost. In future experiments utilization of FAIMS could circumvent the need for size separation prior to mass spectrometry and instead use gas-phase fractionation to sequence malaria and self-peptides from liver stages. This experimental modification should increase the number and depth of proteoforms identified from malaria liver stages by reducing sample loss experienced during off-line size fractionation and selecting for smaller proteoforms using the FAIMS device.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 648, "end": 652, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 653, "end": 657, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 658, "end": 662, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 861, "end": 865, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 866, "end": 870, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 871, "end": 875, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Numerous antigen discovery efforts have led to the identification of pre-erythrocyte antigens that induce sterile immunity from malaria challenge. Some of these antigens function either partially or entirely through CD8+ T cells. For example, the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is highly expressed in sporozoites and early liver stages, induces antibodies [3, 30, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] , induces immunodominant CD8+ T cells that confer protective immunity in na\u00efve mice [50] , and protects humans from experimental malaria challenge [51] . Despite the strong expression and assumed MHC Class I presentation of CSP at liver stages, this study failed to detect these antigens as dominantly presented peptides. That MHC Class I restricted peptides from CSP are presented to CD8+ T cells during the course of malaria infection suggests that our approach has limitations in sensitivity. Additionally, P. falciparum CSP contains a repeating amino acid pattern of NANPN that accounts for 40% of the predicted protein sequence. Fragment ions from cleavage adjacent to proline ions dominate tandem mass spectra. The dominance of proline within CSP fragments could reduce the number of fragment ion matches resulting in a failure to match CSP spectra to the P. falciparum proteome. As a second possibility, malaria liver stage samples for these studies were taken at timepoints \u2265 96 h after sporozoite inoculation, where CSP expression could wane as the parasite transitions to late liver stages.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 356, "end": 359, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 360, "end": 363, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 364, "end": 368, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 369, "end": 373, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 374, "end": 378, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 379, "end": 383, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 384, "end": 388, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 473, "end": 477, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 536, "end": 540, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "While our analysis failed to detect circumsporozoite proteoforms, both humanized mouse livers and hepatocyte monocultures detected sporozoite proteoforms (Additional file 2: Table S1 and Additional file 3:  Table S2 ).
