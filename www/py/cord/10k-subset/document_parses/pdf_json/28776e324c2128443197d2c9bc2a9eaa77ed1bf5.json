However, elimination of non-specific amplification remains a key challenge for the optimization of LAMP assays. Here, using chlamydia DNA as a clinically relevant target and high-throughput sequencing as an analytical tool, we investigate a potential mechanism of non-specific amplification. We then develop a real-time digital LAMP (dLAMP) with high-resolution melting temperature (HRM) analysis and use this single-molecule approach to analyze approximately 1.2 million amplification events. We show that single-molecule HRM provides insight into specific and non-specific amplification in LAMP that are difficult to deduce from bulk measurements. We use real-time dLAMP with HRM to evaluate differences between polymerase enzymes, the impact of assay parameters (e.g. time, rate or florescence intensity), and the effect background human DNA. By differentiating true and false positives, HRM enables determination of the optimal assay and analysis parameters that leads to the lowest limit of detection (LOD) in a digital isothermal amplification assay.",

LAMP in particular shows promise as a NAAT with fewer hardware requirements compared with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (3) . Despite advancements, the ability to optimize LAMP NAATs for a specific target sequence and primer set (specific to a target organism) remains constrained by a limited understanding of how amplification is affected by myriad factors, including polymerase choice, primer design, temperature, time and ion concentrations. In particular, addressing non-specific amplification remains a core problem as it constrains an assay's limit of detection (LOD). In reactions containing template target molecules, both specific and non-specific amplification reactions may occur. Unlike PCR, LAMP lacks a temperature-gating mechanism, so non-specific reactions consume reagents and compete with specific amplification impacting its kinetics. The presence of non-specific amplicons therefore adversely impacts both the assay's analytical sensitivity (the fewest template molecules that can be detected) and its analytical specificity (ability to detect the target template in the presence of competing reactions). Classifying reactions as either specific or non-specific amplification would therefore be invaluable both during assay optimization and assay deployment in clinical diagnostics.",

            "text": "Optimizing LAMP for CT and other infectious pathogens requires addressing and reducing non-specific amplification or a method for separating non-specific reactions from specific amplification. Reactions run in bulk (i.e. in a tube) in the absence of template can be informative to provide information on performance of non-specific amplification. Another method to identify non-specific amplification includes mathematical modeling in conjunction with electrophoresis to distinguish between non-specific and specific banding patterns (9) . However, in the presence of template, although specific and non-specific reactions occur simultaneously, they cannot be monitored simultaneously. Thus, bulk reactions have three important limitations with regard to assay optimization: (i) differences in the kinetics of specific and non-specific reactions cannot be separated, (ii) rare but significant events, such as early but infrequent non-specific amplification, cannot be easily characterized; and (iii) testing the full design space requires many hundreds of replicates to obtain statistically significant data. To improve an assay's analytical specificity and sensitivity, one strategy is to eliminate the detection of non-specific amplification. In bulk LAMP experiments, non-specific amplification can be excluded from detection by using probes, beacons, FRET or reporter-quencher schemes that show only specific amplification of the target (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) . Although these methods improve the assay, they do not capture non-specific reactions and thus cannot give insights into the origin of non-specific amplification or the conditions that led to non-specific amplicons. Moreover, probes and beacons do not eliminate non-specific amplification; non-specific amplification still competes for reagents and can limit the extent of the signal generated by specific amplification events (20) . Hence, it is highly desirable to distinguish specific from non-specific amplification.",

At target molecule concentrations of 10 copies per L (cp/l), amplification using Bst 2.0 polymerase began between 10-11 min ( Figure 1A ) and had uniform T m ( Figure 1B ). Amplification using Bst 3.0 polymerase ( Figure 1C ), also yielded amplification from 10-11 min; however, we also observed a non-specific amplification at 15 min, defined as having a different T m than the specific amplification events ( Figure 1D ). This indicated Bst 3.0 could be a useful model for studying non-specific amplification. We observed that early amplifying products corresponded to specific amplification events, and the later products corresponded to non-specific amplification, supporting our prediction that we could use T m as a proxy for sequence identity, as is common with PCR and has been used previously in LAMP (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) .",

To investigate the role of the concentration of the target on the incidence of non-specific amplification, we performed half-log dilutions of template from 10 to 0.316 cp/l. At 3.16 cp/l ( Figure  1E and F), only specific amplification occurred (24 replicate wells/plate). However, once template concentrations reached 1 cp/l ( Figure 1G and H), non-specific amplification occurred with greater frequency than specific amplification (18 of the 24 replicates generated false positives). Similarly, for 0.316 cp/l ( Figure 1I and J) 15 of the 24 replicates generated false positives. We next ran the same assay in the absence of template (no-template control, NTC) ( Figure  1K and L). Even though we did not expect amplification, we observed all reactions amplified. A total of 44 of 45 replicates amplified at a T m of 91 \u2022 C, consistent with the T m of non-specific amplification in the presence of template. Although it is possible for a reaction to generate multiple different non-specific amplification products, even ones with T m matching to the specific products, the single amplicon observed at 88 \u2022 C in the NTC was a contaminant that appeared to have the same sequence as the specific products ( Figure 2A [well F8]). In general, when the specific target was present, it amplified sooner and outcompeted the nonspecific amplification, thereby reducing the number of observations of non-specific amplification. To determine if the non-specific amplification was inherent to the polymerase or a consequence of buffer selection, we conducted additional studies using both Bst polymerases (Supplementary Figure S1 and Table S1 ).",

Despite the specific amplification products of Bst 2.0 and Bst 3.0 producing similar gel banding patterns (Figure 3 ) and the same sequencing results (see Figure 2B ), they had different T m ( Figure 1B and D, respectively). We determined the difference in T m was due to differences in buffer conditions (Supplementary Figure S1 and Table S1 ).",

Other potential mechanisms include LIMA (30) and UIMA (31) , but are inconsistent with our sequencing results, which observe nearly equal reads of the forward and reverse strand as measured by counting the complementary sequences between each junction. Our proposed mechanism requires properties that have been observed with Bst enzymes: a strand-displacing polymerase lacking 3 -5 exonuclease activity--common to polymerases from thermophilic bacteria (32, 33) , template switching ability to allow synthesis across a discontinuous template (33), terminal transferase activity, or the ability to perform nontemplated synthesis (32, (34) (35) . Briefly, the non-specific product likely arises from extension of a low probability homo-dimerization of the Backward Inner Primer (BIP), followed by elongation across a discontinuous junction ('template switching') to form a double-stranded product incorporating Forward Inner Primer (FIP). Through breathing of the molecule, the 3 of one strand may form a second hairpin and amplify. Some of these amplification events incorporate several random nucleotides via terminal nucleotidyl transferase activity resulting in a pool of hairpins with 3 randomers. Sequences with complementary randomers are selected in vitro to amplify. The doublestranded product of this amplification can, through intramolecular hydrogen bonding, form two dumbbell-like structures and amplify in a fashion similar to the standard LAMP mechanism, but primed by BIP. Repetitive cycles of self-priming and hairpin priming by BIP result in numerous sequences with complementarity and the possibility of multiple replication loci within a single molecule. This process can give rise to very long amplicons, and even a branched, mesh-like network from the multimeric sequences annealing to their neighbors or in a self-complementary fashion. A simplified version of this mechanism, annotated Figure 2. Quantification of junctions using next-generation sequencing of select Chlamydia trachomatis amplification products from bulk reactions.

Bst polymerase is highly prone to mismatched extension (36) , and the two base pairs of CG provide a sufficient anchoring in the 3 to start elongation. Multiple Primer Analyzer (ThermoFisher) does not identify the BIP homodimer, unless maximum sensitivity is used. Alternatively, BIP-prcBIP product may arise from a single stranded BIP-hairpin, as has been observed by others (37) , although UNAfold (IDT) does not predict the formation of the hairpin for this primer. These structures may not need to be abundant at equilibrium, but as long as they are extended by the polymerase, the product will be stabilized and will accumulate.",

The 3 of FIP is within spatial proximity of the homo-BIP sequence due to microhomology of to 5 end of the double-stranded sequence coupled with rapid breathing of two base pairs of TA. This allows temporary insertion and hybridization of FIP with the double-stranded BIP-prcBIP sequence (Figure 4-3) . When the polymerase is also in proximity of this reaction, FIP slips out of the junction, and the polymerase elongates across the 3 discontinuous junction (33,35) templated by FIP (Figure 4-4) . We confirmed the interaction of FIP and BIP produced the high-T m non-specific amplification, and that elimination of 3 microhomology could significantly reduce high-T m non-specific amplification (Supplementary  Figures S4-6 and Tables S3-4 ). After elongation, the FIP which has served as template, is poised to prime in the opposite direction (Figure 4 -5) . This either displaces the initial BIP mispairing (BIP*) or opens the hairpin, resulting in a double-stranded BIP-prcBIP-FIP product (Figure 4-6 ). This three part junction is observed as a complete product in NGS data. Breathing of double-stranded BIP-prcBIP-FIP is prone to formation of an intramolecular self-priming hairpin of rcBIP-pBIP ( Figure 4 . With each amplification, and re-prime by FIP, a single product is generated. This process of hairpin accumulation would cause the linear 'rinsing' baseline observed by other researchers (37) .",

Our sequencing methods are unable to observe a FIP-randomer hairpin because adapter ligation requires double-stranded products. This pool of hairpins with random sequences will accumulate until LAMP selects for sequences that amplify by sharing complementary 3 'toe holds' (Figure 4 -12) . Much like in vitro evolution, those sequences with the highest probability of amplification are selected (32) . The lack of a thermal gating mechanism in LAMP and lack of 3 -5 exonuclease activity makes the amplification reaction especially prone to in vitro evolution of self-amplifying products. When considered in this light, it is unsurprising that non-specific amplification could arise from mechanisms similar to the specific products. Within a given bulk reaction, variation in randomer sequence length and identity was low. However, between different samples, randomer sequences of multiple lengths and identities were observed. These two results further suggest that in bulk reactions amplification occurs from one or a few sequences (Supplementary Table Groups S5-7) .",

As evidence, when the mechanism of seed formation is disrupted through elimination of the microhomology, amplicons with high T m still occur, albeit with lower frequency and delayed occurrence (Supplementary Figures S4-6 and  Tables S3-4 ). Template switching and non-template synthesis are 100\u00d7 slower than template extension (33). However, once the self-amplifying products are selected, the reaction follows standard exponential LAMP enrichment. Thus, accumulation of a sufficient pool of randomers may take time, but still result in a delayed bulk exponential amplification event. Furthermore, should a hairpin with attached randomer form, it is possible that the rising baseline, attributed to hairpin formation (37) , may also by in vitro selection of the products, lead to and result in spontaneous exponential amplification.",

We used the temperature-independent fluorophore ROX to track each partition's location and the dsDNA intercalating fluorophore SYTO 9 to follow amplification and hybridization status.

Real-time imaging of individual partitions enables us to reconstruct the standard amplification curves of intensity for each partition as a function of time ( Figure 5C ), and plotting the fluorescence intensity as a function of temperature yields an HRM trace ( Figure 5D ); the negative derivative plot ( Figure 5E ) of this melt trace is the standard melt curve. Analogous to bulk measurements, the standard melt curve is used to classify reactions as specific or non-specific.

We found that TTP can be heterogeneous while T m is constant (28.6 \u00b1 8.9 min with 87.5 \u00b1 0.2 \u2022 C), indicating that the same product may initiate at different times ( Figure 5F ). This is consistent with our knowledge of the stochastic initiation of LAMP (23, (38) (39) . Further, we observed some variability in the maximum rate despite similar T m (23.7 \u00b1 6.8 RFU/30 s, with 87.5 \u00b1 0.2 \u2022 C T m ), which indicates the same product may amplify at different velocities ( Figure 5G ). In general, we observed that maximum rate often corresponded to the point when the reaction first began to amplify. By plotting rate as a function of TTP ( Figure  5H ) we observed little fluctuation in rate across a range of different TTPs (23.7 \u00b1 6.8 RFU/30 s with 28.6 \u00b1 8.9 min), indicating that the differences in TTP are mostly delays in the initiation of amplification rather than differences in the rate of amplification.",

We performed dLAMP using three chips containing tem- plate, and three chips lacking template (NTC) and observed \u223c55,000 partitions for each condition. Although 60 000 partitions are possible, not all partitions filled nor can all partitions be tracked for the full duration of an experiment. For the melt curve, fluorescence readings were taken at 1 \u2022 C increments from 55-90 \u2022 C; and at 0.5 \u2022 C increments from 90-95 \u2022 C to give higher resolution. Due to slight differences in the timing between the heating element and the image collection, some chips were observed at slightly different temperatures (<0.5 \u2022 C). Our approach enabled us to differentiate specific and non-specific amplification events using HRM. When using the polymerase Bst 2.0 and template ( Figure 6A , blue points), we observed a large band of amplification in the temperature range 88.5-90.3 \u2022 C, in agreement with the T m observed when performing the reaction in bulk (Figure 1 ). In contrast, the NTC ( Figure 6A , red points) had very few amplification events in that temperature range (68 out of 51 279 partitions). Hence, we defined events that occurred in the T m range 88.5-90.3 \u2022 C as true positives (specific amplification events) and we defined those that occurred outside this range (in both the NTC and in the presence of template) as false positives (non-specific amplification events). When using the polymerase Bst 3.0, we observed a large band of amplification from 91.25 to 92.75 \u2022 C in the presence of template ( Figure 6B , blue points) that did not correspond with amplification in the NTC ( Figure 6B , red points) so we defined these as specific amplification events. As with bulk measurements, we determined the difference in T m between specific amplification events between Bst 2.0 and Bst 3.0 was due to the difference in buffer composition (Supplementary Figure S1 and Table S1 ).",

            "text": "During these experiments, we observed two common patterns. First, the T m for specific amplification events was 3-5 \u2022 C lower in digital compared with bulk measurements. We attribute this difference to temperature calibration; the thermocycler is calibrated to the liquid temperature, whereas the thermoelectric element measures the temperature of the heating element. Second, false positives in the NTC had predominantly high T m , which we attribute to the non-specific product we identified in the bulk reactions. We also observed differences in total amplification events between the two polymerases. Assays with Bst 3.0 resulted in substantially more non-specific amplification than those with Bst 2.0 and confirmed this was not an issue with buffer selection (Supplementary Figure S1 and Table S1 ). After 90 min, Next, we tested whether TTP is different for specific and non-specific amplification. Because LAMP follows a 'winner-takes-all' format, frequent and early non-specific amplification events may dominate bulk amplification. In general, for both Bst 2.0 and Bst 3.0, specific amplification had earlier TTP than non-specific amplification, although there was some overlap, mostly >90.5 \u2022 C ( Figure 6A and B). We were able to distinguish the clustering of high-T m non-specific products separately from specific amplification using a threshold of 88.5-90.3 \u2022 C ( Figure 6C and Supplementary Figure S8A ). We illustrate each partition with only partial opacity so that when false positives in the NTC (red) overlap with false positives in the template-containing sample (blue), the overlap of multiple colors appears purple ( Figure 6D ). Color intensity indicates the abundance of paritions at a given TTP and temperature. To further illustrate how this approach can be used to differentiate specific and non-specific amplification, we next selected a re-gion where both specific and non-specific products were observed. For Bst 3.0, we were able to distinguish the clustering of high-T m non-specific products separately from specific amplification using the threshold of 91. .75 \u2022 C ( Figure 6E ) and we observed better separation of specific and non-specific amplification than with Bst 2.0 ( Figure 6F and Supplementary Figure S8B) . Both enzymes had highly variable TTP, which we have observed previously (23) and attribute to stochastic initiation of LAMP. Bst 2.0 had both earlier specific amplification and later non-specific amplification than Bst 3.0. Bst 2.0 reactions containing template generally started at 10 min, whereas non-specific amplification began at \u223c40 min. In contrast, Bst 3.0 reactions containing template began at 11.5 min and non-specific amplification began at \u223c20 min.",

Previously, we demonstrated that rate could be used to correct for some non-specific amplification using Escherichia coli 23S primers (23), so we wished to test whether we could use maximum rate as a way to differentiate specific and nonspecific amplification. Generally, specific and non-specific amplification reactions did not have the same maximum rate. For Bst 2.0, non-specific amplification tended to have a slower max rate than specific amplification, although there was some overlap (Figure 6G ). At high T m , the clustering of non-specific amplification in both the presence of template and in the NTC were observed at >90.5 \u2022 C and below \u223c50 RFU/30 s ( Figure 6H ). For Bst 3.0, although there was substantial overlap, we again observed that nonspecific amplification tended to have slower maximum rate than specific amplification ( Figure 6I ). Examining the high-T m amplification events, non-specific amplification collects above 92.75 \u2022 C and has maximum rate extending out to 75 RFU/30 s ( Figure 6J ). For both enzymes, overlap between specific and non-specific amplification was similar and specific amplification tended to be faster. However, the maximum rate of specific amplification between the two enzymes differed; Bst 2.0 had a maxium rate of 150 RFU/30 s, whereas Bst 3.0 did not exceed 100 RFU/30 s. Bst 2.0 performing faster than Bst 3.0 is consistent with our previous observations using an E. Coli 23S primer set (23) . Additionally, the maximum rate of non-specific amplification in Bst 2.0 tended to be lower than non-specific amplification in Bst 3.0 (50 and 75 RFU/30 s, respectively). Consequently, the extent of overlap of specific and non-specific amplificaiton was greater for Bst 3.0 than Bst 2.0.",

After 90 min of amplification, a partition should theoretically reach a fluorescence maximum whereby all reagents are consumed, amplification plateaus and thus the final intensity would be independent of the maximum rate of amplification. However, surprisingly, we observed a general scaling between the maximum rate and the final intensity of the partition. For Bst 2.0, all amplification in the NTC has final intensity <1017 RFU and maximum rate <53.4 RFU/30 s. In the presence of template, 79.7% of non-specific amplification and 52.3% of specific amplification had final intensity and maximum rate less than these thresholds. For 45 .6% of specific amplification fell within these thresholds using Bst 3.0. Thus, false positives were generally dimmer and had slower maximum rates than most true-positive events. When examining the brightest partitions, Bst 2.0 ( Figure 6K) and Bst 3.0 (Figure 6L ) exhibit a similar maximal final intensity near 3000 RFU. These maxima are also surprising, considering our 12-bit camera is capable of imaging up to 4096 RFU (the detector was not at saturation). We suspect that this maxima corresponds to consumption of one of the reagents; while scaling between maximum rate and final intensity occurs when stochastically initiated reactions have not completely amplified, resulting in partitions dimmer than the maxima and proportional to their rate of amplification.",

            "text": "Next, to explicitly test whether fast and early events correspond to specific amplification, we analyzed the relationship between a partition's TTP, its maximum rate, and T m . In the first 12 min of amplification, we observed six nonspecific amplification events in Bst 2.0 (four in the presence of template; two in the NTC; Figure 6O ), and we observed 13 non-specific events in Bst 3.0 (10 in the presence of template; three in the NTC; Figure 6P ). For both polymerases, we were able to distinguish the rare, fast and early nonspecific amplicons from true positives. For Bst 2.0, these non-specific amplifications were slower than the fastest true positives, and occurred at similar times. In contrast, for Bst 3.0, the earliest amplification events were false positives and tended to have similar rates to the true positives. We hypothesize that in bulk reactions, the fast and early non-specific amplification events (as seen in Bst 3.0 Figure 6P ) lead to non-specific measurements, whereas non-specific amplification that coincides with specific amplification, but proceeds at a slower rate (as seen in Bst 2.0 Figure 6O ), would still produce specific amplification in bulk. This hypothesis is corroborated by sequencing of bulk LAMP reactions (Figure 2) . Though individual bulk reactions may be assigned a homogeneous label as 'true positive' or 'false positive' by T m , sequencing identifies multiple products within each reaction and the T m is determined by the dominant product. For example, we observed a 'false positive' by T m ( Figure  1C and D) , despite the presence of template. The sequencing of this product, contained non-specific product sequences, similar to those observed in the NTC, at high prevalence, as well as the specific target sequences in low abundance (Figure 2 [well C7]) . Similarly, though 'true positive' is as-signed to other bulk reactions in the presence of template, the non-specific products are still observed at low abundance (e.g. Figure 2 [well F8] ). Further, a greater number of non-specific partitions in digital using Bst 3.0 than Bst 2.0, is correlated with a greater number of non-specific reads despite the presence of template in the sequencing data (Comparing Figures 6A-B and 2B group A versus C) . We hypothesize that the combination of real-time parameters (such as rate and TTP), combined with the ability of digital assays to yield probabilities and to assign reaction identity through HRM, may ultimately help researchers optimize bulk reaction conditions.",

We observed that among all partitions, regarless of if the product was specific or non-specific amplificiation, fluorescence was brighter when amplification occurred earlier and faster. This was true for both polymerases. Additionally, we observed two types of nonspecific amplification. The first type of non-specific was the traditional 'primer-dimer' cloud, which is characterized by a low T m , low final fluorescence intensity, a slow max rate and a generally late TTP. The second type of non-specific cloud matches only in its high T m , and spans a wide range of rates, TTP and final intensities. The high-T m non-specific amplification occurs with greater frequency than the low-T m non-specific amplification. The major differences between the polymerases can also be resolved with this visualization. The number of non-specific amplification events is much fewer for Bst 2.0 than for Bst 3.0. Further, these nonspecific events in Bst 2.0 never achieve same fluorescene intensity or maximum rate as with Bst 3.0.

Assay performance is affected by amplification time and the combination of choices of parameters used to process the data impacting LOD, the probability of detecting a molecule (efficiency), and the clinical sensitivity and specificity.

In this equation, the N True and N False are chip-specific, and take into account the total volume of the chip, the number of partitions and the volume of partitions. Furthermore, in Equation (1), amplification efficiency is implicitly taken into account via the N True parameter (in other words, for a less efficient amplification process, a given C True on a given chip would lead to a lower value of N True ). For simplicity, Equation (1) makes the assumption that the measurements are performed at sufficiently low concentrations (as is typical for LOD experiments) that only a very small fraction of occupied partitions contain more than one molecule and therefore there is a linear relationship between C True and N True . The concentration loaded, C True , generates N total counts of both true-and false-positive events. We can divide this concentration by the minimal number of counts needed to identify a specific amplification event and define this as the LOD. The minimum number of counts needed to guarantee a specific amplification event is observed is determined by N True , N False and N CI . N True and N False are determined empirically, whereas N CI is calculated from the desired expected number of molecules that will yield at least one detection event for a given confidence interval (N CI ) from the Poisson equation. If we require a 95% CI to observe a true positive across an entire chip, the minimum number of counted events is 3 (i.e. 5% of the time, the Poisson expected loading of three target molecules will still measure zero events.) For a 98% CI, N CI would be four counts. Hence, all true-positive counts in excess of N CI are counts observed above the LOD. Uncertainty in the LOD is given by Supplementary Equations S1-2.",

In this case, it is not possible to conclusively observe a true positive, and the LOD becomes irrelevant. Second, Equation (1) gives an absolute LOD.

To answer this question, we plot LOD and the cumulative counts of true and false positives as a function of time for Bst 2.0 ( Figure 7F ). Similarly to Bst 3.0, we observe LOD improve rapidly as true-positive events are counted. However, unlike Bst 3.0, the non-specific amplification events are few and their presence does not have an impact on LOD. Thus, when using Bst 2.0, the curves representing LOD with or without HRM in the final assay overlay and indicate using HRM in the final assay has no additional benefit. Furthermore, the continuously decreasing LOD with time for either case indicates that use of ROC curves to determine an optimum can be misleading. While the ROC implies that an optimum exists, the false-positive incidence is rare enough that a TTP optimum selected by LOD does not exist. Hence, assay developers may select assay time based on requirements other than LOD.",

(Figure 7G ) For both polymerases we observed a similar, rapid decrease in LOD in the initial moments as true-positive events are detected. However, we also noticed several differences. Bst 2.0 has a lower LOD than Bst 3.0 at any amplification time. We attribute this difference to the higher incidence of false positives when using Bst 3.0 compared with Bst 2.0. An additional consequence of the low false-positive incidence using Bst 2.0, regardless of the use of HRM in the assay, is the LOD continues to improve with time as additional true positives are counted. In contrast, Bst 3.0 benefits greatly from use of HRM in the final assay. If HRM is not included in the assay ( Figure 7G , red dashed), a clear optimum for LOD occurs at 34 min and 0.93\u00b10.16 cp/L.

For this primer set, LOD for Bst 3.0 was lower (better) when using TTP (0.93\u00b10.16 cp/L) than max rate (2.11\u00b10.92 cp/L) or final intensity (2.14\u00b10.89 cp/L).

We categorized amplification events as specific and non-specific based on T m as previously. First, we asked: Is there a relationship between fraction of template molecules amplified in dLAMP and amplification time? We then determined the total number of template copies loaded into a chip relative to the copies measured by ddPCR. If amplification initiation is stochastic, as observed in Figures 5F and 6A -B, does longer assay time increase 'efficiency' and thereby improve LOD when using T m (as seen in Figure 7C and F)? We observe that for Bst 2.0 a large number of partitions amplify at in the first 11.5 min, followed by a second phase after 20 min where additional partitions amplify with lower frequency ( Figure 9A ). The mode TTP for concentrations less than 5000 HHGE per l was \u223c11.6 \u00b1 0.2 min (Supplementary Table S8 and Figures S10A-11C) . After the mode TTP, the frequency of observing specific amplification in the absence of HHGE decreases from a maximum frequency of 1.2 \u00b1 0.1% copies detected per 30 s to a lower average fre- quency of 0.23 \u00b1 0.04% copies per 30 s from 20 to 90 min ( Figure 9A ). For Bst 3.0 ( Figure 10A ), we observe a similar trend temporally, though mode TTP was at least 2 min slower and had greater variability than Bst 2.0 (Supplementary Table S8 , Figures S10B-11D) . Further, Bst 3.0 consistently amplified fewer target molecules than Bst 2.0 at all time points. This highlights the stochastic nature of amplification using LAMP, and importance in choice of enzyme on sensitivity. In theory, assays employing T m could be run until all partitions amplify as either a false or true positive. Allow all partitions to amplify would give the highest possible number of target copies amplified and lowest possible LOD when using T m in the final assay.",

The fraction of partitions generating a false-positive amplification at low T m was less than 3.3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 through 45 min (i.e. 7 or fewer events in 20,000 partitions per chip). Similarly, partition counts of high-T m non-specific amplification are <10 per chip until 45 min. After 90 min, high-T m non-specific amplification is more prevalent than low-T m non-specific amplification and the reactions finish with fewer than non-specific 260 counts in 20,000 partitions corresponding to a false-positive fraction of 1.3 \u00d7 10 \u22122 . One exception is the non-specific high-T m amplification in the absence template and HHGE. This condition appears to have lower non-specific background than other conditions. We collected each replicate on separate days and are able to observe the experimental variability between the presence and absence fo template, which might be otherwise lost when examining the NTC alone. This experiment emphasizes the advantage of determining non-specific amplificaiton using T m from the same experiment as specific amplification is counted. At low background rates, such as when using Bst 2.0, inherant variability exists in the false-positive fraction and can impact LOD.

Thus, LOD becomes worse when efficiency is lower (i.e. at 5000 HHGE per l). Similarly, when HRM is not incorporated in the assay, higher concentrations of HHGE tend to result in a worse LOD. However, at long amplification times, high concentrations of HHGE suppress non-specific amplification more than specific amplification, resulting in LOD enhancement relative to low concentrations of HHGE.",

Thus, we conclude background hgDNA impacts dLAMP for this primer set. Generally, investigators should examine their own primer sets in the presence of high concentrations of hgDNA and take caution when examining clinical samples with high leukocyte concentrations (as reported by urinanalysis). For example, CT infection is not inherently associated with high concentrations of leukocytes and many infections are asymptomatic. Ultimately, these experiments underscore the value of quantifying non-specific amplificaiton variability, using HRM, from within the same experiment as a target is quantified. Because non-specific amplificaiton is measured within a given sample, one no longer needs to assume it remains identical to the NTC or between experimental runs.",

Our intention was to design an accessible system with readily available components to enable others to access the advantages of digital microfluidics to study and optimize primer sets, enzymes, and reaction conditions of interest to them.

The formation of these non-specific amplicons occurs from the interaction of multiple primers and the use of a polymerase with template switching ability, terminal transferase activity and lacking 3 -5 exonuclease activity. Interaction of primers may lead not only lead to rising background fluorescence (37), but to spontaneous exponential amplification as well. Primer design and enzyme selection therefore should be judicious to avoid formation of hairpins within primers, as well as microhomology at the 3 with any other primer, in order to prevent non-specific amplification.",

When HRM is incorporated into a dLAMP assay, true and false-positive amplification events can easily be separated. LOD is improved by elimination of non-specific background and thus becomes dependent on the number of molecules that amplify (i.e. amplification efficiency or fraction of copies detected), without dependence on the incidence of false positives. In contrast, if HRM were employed in a bulk reaction, the LOD would still be limited by the competition between specific and nonspecific amplification (which amplifies first) and would require a high number of trials to achieve sufficient statistical power. Importantly, even when HRM will not be used in the final assay, it can still be incorporated during the assaydevelopment stage to improve the assay's LOD by determin-ing the optimal choice of parameters based on rate, TTP, final intensity or any combination of these parameters. Furthermore, our mathematical description of LOD is generalizable to other amplification methods that are measured in digital and can separate specific and non-specific amplification.",

For example, fast or early non-specific events in digital may indicate primers or conditions that will be especially vulnerable to failure in a bulk reaction.
