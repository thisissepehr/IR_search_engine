Interestingly, the mortality rate in PCT-guided patients was also significantly lower compared with the control group (21.1 vs. 23.7%, p \u00bc 0.03). 54 Similar effects were also noted in subgroup analyses stratified by Sepsis-3 definition, severity of sepsis, presence of renal shock, renal failure and type of infection. These positive effects may be explained by a lower risk for antibiotic side effects with PCT-guided care. Also, the prognostic information derived from PCT kinetics may influence therapeutic decisions and prompt additional diagnostic assessment. 55 Consistent with the results mentioned above, another meta-analysis studying PCT use in septic patients with positive blood cultures found a significantly shorter duration of antibiotic therapy for PCT-guided patients (\u00c02.86 days).

A large interventional trial testing the hypothesis that therapy escalation in septic patients in whom PCT did not decrease appropriately would improve outcomes did not reveal a benefit for PCT-guided patients. 39 Despite the current body of evidence for PCT-guided antibiotic discontinuation, a commonly accepted clinical algorithm in critically ill patients was long lacking, which in turn limited a more widespread use of PCT. 21 Still, PCT protocols used in the different trials were all somewhat similar and based on a similar intuitive concept: in patients with suspicion of sepsis, initial antibiotics were recommended based on clinical grounds, and PCT kinetics over time were used for recommendations regarding early discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. 51 Thereby, PCT cutoffs of <0.5 ng/mL or a decrease of 80 to 90% from the peak level were used to indicate resolution of illness and stopping of treatment in case the clinical course was also favorable. An international expert group recently also published a consensus algorithm for PCT use in patients with suspected bacterial infection and came to similar conclusions (\u25baFig. 2). 21 Importantly, this algorithm has been tested in different interventional trials, which all documented significantly reduced antibiotic exposure and no excess mortality or \u25baFig. 2 provides practical guides for a rational use of PCT in high-risk settings in conjunction with the clinical assessment including interpretation of PCT and recommendations for antibiotic use. 21, 57 To optimize antibiotic stewardship, implementation of supplemental educational programs would be useful. In the interventional noninferiority proACT trial, no reduction of antibiotic prescription or treatment duration among patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection in the emergency department could be observed. 58 Indeed, the adherence rate to the PCT protocol was low, illustrating lack of experience with PCT use and its interpretation in the clinical context as well as uncertainty regarding efficacy and safety of this approach. Therefore, frequent education in the context of an antibiotic stewardship may help physicians to gain more confidence in dealing with PCT measurements and improve patient care. 21 This hypothesis is supported by the results of the retrospective cohort study by Broyles and colleagues. By means of education-based antibiotic stewardship, including the use of PCT measurements, lower rates of antibiotic prescriptions as well as reduced resistance rates were found.
