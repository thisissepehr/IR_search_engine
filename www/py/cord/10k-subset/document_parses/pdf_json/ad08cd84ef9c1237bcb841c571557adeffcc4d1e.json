(2009a,b) presented a multi-agent decentralized cooperative strategy (MAD-COS) for dynamic optimization problems. In MADCOS, a population of cooperative agents has moved over a grid containing solutions. In order to test and analyze both different communication schemes for the agents and real need of an explicit diversity preserving mechanism in MADCOS, researchers focused on cooperation and diversity mechanisms. Moreover, two types of diversity mechanisms were investigated. Different configurations of the moving peaks benchmark problem were employed as a test bed. A set of computational experiments have been set to evaluate how different communication strategies affect the search; and the usefulness of having explicit and implicit diversity mechanisms. Last offline error (OE) (\"accuracy\") and relative error between the best found solutions (\"error\") have been recorded to measure the performance of each configuration. Results showed that having an Researchers indicated that regarding diversity, the implicit mechanism provided by their multi-agent model seems to be enough for the scenarios tested. However, it was stated that the explicit mechanism proposed, based on randomization, did not perform as expected. Wang and Liu (2010) presented an agent-based evolutionary search algorithm (AES) for solving dynamic travelling salesman problem (DTSP). In their study, the term agent indicated a candidate position in the search space. Agents resided in a lattice-like environment and a collection of such agents were termed as population. They applied a recombination and local updating procedure to the fittest agent referring to a predefined neighborhood. They also combined the perturbation learning strategy to further reinforce the performance of the local updating rule and hope to seek the global optimum rapidly under changing environments. Dynamic version of KroA100 TSP was selected as the case of implementation. Offline performance which was the best of generation fitness averaged over 100 runs and then averaged over the data gathering period. Experimental result and relevant t test result indicated that the performance of AES was excellent. Researchers indicated that the superiority of AES lie in its faster convergence and optimum tracking ability in dynamic environments. It is concluded that AES algorithm had a more quickly and robust convergence capability than standard genetic algorithm (SGA) on dynamic problem. Billiau and Ghose (2008) proposed a new algorithm for solving distributed constrained optimization problems (DCOPs). The proposed algorithm, which has been called as Support Based Distributed Optimization (SBDO), has used agent level objectives instead of weighted or soft constraints that have been used by other DCOP algorithms. In DCOPs, constraints/ objectives of the problem change over time by adding or removing constraints/objectives. Researchers compared the performance of this algorithm with asynchronous distributed optimization (ADOPT) and distributed pseudotree optimization procedure (DPOP) by using 120 meeting scheduling problem. Result showed that, although SBDO algorithm has not guaranteed to find the optimal solution, it reliably found solutions within two percent of the optimal solution. Results also revealed that SBDO was able to find near optimal results significantly faster than ADOPT and in a comparable time to DPOP. M\u00e1hr et al. (2010) compared two structurally different planning approaches, which were agent based solution and on-line optimization approach, for drayage operations in an uncertain environment. The structurally differentiating feature of the two solution approaches was the level of control: centralized (on-line optimization) and decentralized (agent based solution). Dynamic vehicle routing problem (DVRP) with two types of uncertainty, arrival time and service time, was employed in order to compare the performance of agent-based solution and on-line optimization approach. Moreover, scenarios were developed under different arrival time and service time. In their study, containers and truckers were defined as agent. Each container agent sold itself on an auction to the truck agents. Researchers concluded that when the online optimization approach performed better, it was by capitalizing the optimal (or near optimal) balance between routing and rejection cost. When agents performed better, their flexibility provided by their distributed nature was the competitive advantage.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 701, "end": 723, "text": "Pelta et al.

In this study, resource allocation was expressed as an optimization problem, which could be decomposed into single optimization problems, under certain constraints. Researchers proposed to solve this optimization problem in a distributed fashion by using multiple agents. These agents have acted as local optimizer and coordinated their local solutions to an overall consistent solution. In this study, market based interaction mechanism was employed and the agents have calculated and negotiated complete supply and demand trajectories using model based predictions. In order to test the performance of the proposed approach, researcher employed this approach to three technical examples. Results revealed that this approach could be used to cope with resource allocation in dynamic environments. Li and Li (2009) proposed a multi-agent coordination and integration method which has been called intercommunication job-sharing hybridization, for solving complex problems. These complex problems could be decomposed into smaller separate sub-problems, with communications/exchange between sub-problems identified, human decision-makers' roles clearly defined and managerial judgment incorporated. With the proposed method, the overall problem was divided into distinct jobs which were then assigned to relatively independent and distributed agents. These agents have shared data, information knowledge and carried out different tasks synchronously or asynchronously in the context of Internet/intranets/extranets to produce solutions. In addition, these agents have linked human participants' judgments and intuition together for joint problem-solving. The architecture of the Internet-enabled multi-agent-based hybrid support system for international marketing planning was exemplified. Researchers constructed a prototype, which has been called Agent International, of the proposed multi-agent hybrid framework. This prototype covered some key features of the conceptual framework and its architecture. The potential and value of the prototype was evaluated by a questionnaire which was prepared and delivered to the corresponding firms in London. According to the responses, researchers concluded that the prototype system was rated somewhat moderately in helping understand pertinent marketing decision making factors, exploring various alternatives, performing analysis, coping with uncertainty, incorporating managers' judgment an improving the confidence and quality of international marketing decision-making. Tang et al. (2004) presented an auction based dynamic optimization decision support system. The presented decision support system was applied in solving an automobile load makeup planning problem. The proposed system included three types of agents. These were the yard agents, representing the shipping yard, the truck scheduler agent, representing the transportation company who sold trucks and executed transportation and load agent representing a truck during the planning state. Each type of agent had its own behaviors. In order to solve the static load make up problem, researchers implemented 3 heuristics which were empirical (EM), minimum spanning tree (MST), vehicle routing optimization (VRO). In addition to these heuristics, a virtual market enabled by auction mechanism was employed to solve dynamic optimization problem. Researchers developed the mixture of static optimization with MST algorithm and dynamic optimization with the auction mechanism, MST Dyn, at the beginning of the day, they apply static optimization on the guaranteed information, and then they apply the dynamic optimization until the loads are fixed at the beginning of lining up. In order to test the performance of the algorithms, same scenario was used and each algorithm has run for 120 days. Transportation cost and dwell time were selected as the performance measures. Results showed that, EM algorithm produced the worst performance and MST Dyn the best. The MST algorithm produced the worst performance and EM algorithm the best based on the transportation cost. Researchers indicated that MST Dyn algorithm produced a little bit more transportation cost than EM algorithm. Therefore, it was concluded that MST Dyn algorithm produced the best comprehensive performance. Berro and Duthen (2001) presented an optimization method in dynamic environment. The proposed method, using software agents, tried to provide accurate solutions and react quickly to changes in the state of the problem. In this method, software agents were randomly created and they try to colonize an optimum of the function. The system composed of two parts namely control system and agent. An agent has not communicated but it perceived the presence of other agents. When the functions to optimize and the dimensions of the search space have been defined, the user must specify two parameters namely FORCE which would influence the searching speed and EPSILON which calculated precision of the optimal points. In order to test the proposed method, 2 cases of optimization problems, multimodal function and multi-objective function, were used. The test results were compared with the Genetic algorithm based approaches. Researchers concluded that the first tests result of the proposed method were satisfactory in particular for the computing speed and precision. Jiang and Han (2008) presented a simulated annealing (SA) based algorithm to solve real time multi-agent decision making problem. In this study, the SA algorithm was implemented in a centralized version and performed by the agents in parallel, without assuming the availability of communications. Since there was no standard benchmark to evaluate multi-agent decision algorithm, a random generator was used to generate all test sets. The SA algorithm was tested by comparing it, with other algorithms, especially with variable elimination (VE) algorithm with respect to the scalability and relative payoff. Results revealed that, the proposed method was almost optimal with a small fraction of the time that VE took to compute the policy of the same coordination problem. In addition, researchers indicated two main benefits of this approach as follows: the time taken by the algorithm has grown polynomial with the number of agents and the algorithm could report a near-optimal answer at any time. Researchers concluded that, SA was a feasible approach for action selection in large complex cooperative autonomous systems. Zhou et al. (2008) proposed a model combining discrete event systems and multi agent systems (MAS) to simulate a real time job shop. All entities of the generic job shop were modeled as autonomous agents namely job agent, machine agent, work-center agent, shop floor agent, controller agent and job releaser agent. All agents pursued their own interest with unique functions. All communications in the MAS were realized through message passing. Proportion machines busy (work-center), average number in queue (work-center), maximum number in queue (work-center), average daily throughput (shop floor), average time in system (shop floor), average total time in queues (shop floor), maximal size of work in process (shop floor) were selected as performance indicators. Results of the case study demonstrated the advantage of distributed data collection and analysis. It was indicated that, the case study also validated the proposed system by statistical analysis and comparison to existing simulation results in similar test case. Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2010) presented a new centralized cooperative strategy based on trajectory methods (tabu/taboo search) for solving DOPs. The proposed strategy was compared with two methods namely a multi-QPSO and Agents. The multi-QPSO is a particle swarm optimization (PSO) variant with multiple swarms and different types of particles where there exists an implicit cooperation within each swarm and competition among different swarms. On the other hand, agents are an explicit decentralized cooperation scheme where multiple agents cooperate to improve a grid of solutions. Researchers tried to assess the possibilities of trajectory methods in the context of DOPs and to draw attention on explicitly including cooperation schemes in methods. A set of solver\\threads were consisted in the proposed strategy. Each solver could implement the same of a different resolution algorithm for the problem at hand. The coordinator was responsible for processing the information received from the solver and producing subsequent adjustments of their behavior by sending \"orders\". Exchange of data was achieved by using a blackboard model, with two blackboards. One of them was written by the solvers that wrote the reports of their performances and read by the coordinator; and another was written by the coordinator that wrote the orders and read by the solvers. The information flow in the proposed strategy was achieved by using the following three steps: firstly, performance information was sent from the solvers to the coordinator, and then this information was processed and stored by the coordinator and finally, the coordinator sent directives to the solvers. A set of rule, based on Reactive Search Ideas, was employed to control the solvers. In order to test compare the performance of the proposed strategy, moving peaks benchmark problem and three commonly used multimodal real test functions were selected. To emphasize the importance of dynamism and optimal tracking, and to reduce the number of variables to control in the experiments, only the position of the peaks was altered. Proposed strategy and the other two methods were compared according to offline error. Just before a change, offline error of each algorithm was recorded and this value was averaged over all changes, for all independent runs. Therefore, mean fitness error was calculated. Researchers indicated that the proposed strategy could consistently outperform the results of the two other methods. They concluded that the cooperation included in agents provided some benefits over multi-QPSO on the easier problems, but since the optimization done in agents relied only on using simple random perturbations of solutions it may be enough to cope with more difficult problems, even with the help of the cooperation. Lepagnot et al. (2010) presented a new method called multi agent dynamic optimization (MADO) to solve dynamic optimization problems. In MADO, a population of agent has explored the search space. Three modules namely, memory module, agent manager and coordinator were employed. The number of agents in the system may have varied temporarily, but the number of agents along the whole search process tended to be equal to the predetermined value. This could be achieved by the coordination who would send a delete instruction if the number of agents was higher than a predetermined value. To test the performance of the MADO, moving peaks benchmark problem was employed. Offline error and standard deviation (SD) were selected as performance measure. Different variants of MADO were compared with the proposed one. Results indicated that MADO was better than all the simpler variants. Researchers concluded that the proposed MADO was a promising method for solving dynamic optimization problems. Yan et al. (2010) proposed an agent based evolutionary search (AES) search method. In AES, a population of agents has represented potential solutions. Similar to EAs, AES gradually converged in the search space during the run, especially when the environment has been stationary for some time. In order to improve the performance of AES for DOPs, two diversity maintaining mechanisms, random immigrants and adaptive dual mapping were employed. Dynamic 0-1 optimization problems which were generated from static optimization problems by using XOR generator were investigated. Nine different dynamic test problems were constructed. The environment was periodically changed every predetermined number of generations. Different change severities were employed to test the performance of AES. The performance of AES was compared with traditional SGA, the primal dual GA and the GA with random immigrant, where the worst 10% individuals were replaced with random individuals every generation. Mean best of generation fitness was selected as performance measurements. According to the mean best of generation fitness, researchers indicated that AES could always outperform other EAs on almost all problems. Researchers stated that the competitive and learning behaviors of agents could always help AES to obtain a better performance than the peer GAs could do. They concluded that some dynamic characteristics of the environments may affect the performance of the algorithm. Hanna and Cagan (2009) presented an evolutionary multi-agent system (EMAS) for adaptive optimization. EMAS which has employed the evolution of design strategies within a cooperative virtual team has evolved as conditions change and as new solution states were discovered during the optimization process. A set of strategies for creating solutions were represented by population of agents. In EMAS, the strategies for generating solutions have been recombined, altered, and removed by applying genetic operators that are in typical genetic and evolutionary algorithms. However, researchers have made EMAS different from genetic and evolutionary programming techniques by adding cooperation dimension. Cooperation was employed to combat the problem of not knowing which strategy to use in an unknown but static design space. It has been provided by embodying each strategy in an autonomous agent and allowing the population of agents to communicate. Researchers used the well known combinatorial optimization problem of travelling salesman. Researchers tried to illustrate that the proposed framework was capable of increasing the effectiveness of individual solution strategies by evolving and coordination them a decentralized manner. Three simple heuristic construction algorithms called nearest insertion, farthest insertion and arbitrary insertion were employed. Beside these, three heuristics based algorithms, 2-Opt, 3-Opt and simple mutation were also used. Two basic reduction algorithms, random reduction and best partial reduction were employed. Different from the typical genetic algorithms, gene strings represented agent strategies for generating solutions, not the solutions themselves. The design architecture used in this study was similar to asynchronous team architecture. In this study fitness was based on the ability of the agent to make positive changes in its destination memory. First of all researchers selected a 48-city problem to compare the resulting tours generated by EMAS with those generated by both individual algorithms on their own as well as priori determined hybrid algorithms. When the results of EMAS were compared with the results from running construction algorithms from each starting city and then running improvement algorithms on the resultant tour, researchers found that trials that correlated more strongly with the average patterns had better final values in terms of distance from the optimal value of the average solution quality. In addition to the 532-city problem and 48-city problem, researchers applied these patterns to a team solving a Euclidean 237-city problem modeled on a very large scale integration layout problem. Researchers has seen that the cooperative teams of individual strategies evolved to generate better solutions than both individual strategies alone and a priori set hybrid strategies. It was indicated that the strength of the EMAS algorithm lies in its ability to evolve the best team of agent dynamically. It was also stated that, one of the strength of the EMAS algorithm was as a predictive or learning guide for which set of algorithms or strategies should or should not employed and when. Researchers concluded that, utilizing EMAS in the proposed way has been shown to lower computation time while maintaining or even improving solution quality. Pelta et al. (2009a,b) investigated if the type of rules employed previously in cooperative systems for static optimization problems have had sense when applied to DOPs. The proposed strategy was based on the joint use of a population of solutions and optimizers (agents). Researchers analyzed the roles that diversity and decentralized cooperation mechanisms in the performance of the methods. Researchers aimed to propose and compare two kinds of control rules to update the solution's set. These rules were a simple frequency based re-sampling (probabilistic) rule and a fuzzy-set based rule. Researchers also tried to understand the behavior of both rules in order to develop more efficient cooperative strategies for DOPs. In this study, cooperation was understood as a mechanism for information sharing. The population of solutions had two purposes which were to serve as an implicit memory that has evolved by means of the action of agents and to be a communication channel for them. An explicit cooperation mechanism was proposed. This mechanism, which was not always triggered, was based on a simple idea. In order to test the performance of the proposed strategy, a set of experiments were developed by using Moving peaks benchmark problem. The main aim of the experiments was to evaluate the behavior of both rules which may trigger the explicit cooperation mechanisms. Offline error was used as performance measurement. The performance of the cooperative system for different setting of each rule and the system's dynamic behavior were also investigated. The results of the proposed strategy were compared with some published results. Researchers stated that the fuzzy-based rule has been better than the frequency rule. As a conclusion, researchers indicated that both rules have been competitive when compared with a state-of-the art of the algorithm. Xiang and Lee (2008) proposed an agent-based dynamic scheduling approach which employs ant colony intelligence (ACI) with local agent coordination. The goal of their study was to represent a dynamic manufacturing system through an MAS. They also used ACI to improve the global performance of the system. In the proposed system, entities were modeled as intelligent agents with related knowledge of their own functions and goals. MAS was used to provide parallel execution of commands. Beside this, MAS had the intelligence of negotiation to enhance system performance. The agent coordination mechanism used in the study was inspired by both foraging and division of labor of ant colony in MAS. There were five types of agents in the proposed MAS. They were order agents, job agents, machine agents, work center agents and shop floor agents. Researchers indicated that, different from the previous studies, a more generic manufacturing model with less unrealistic assumptions was considered. Furthermore, ACI was integrated with both machine agents and job agents to solve both task allocation and task scheduling problems. Two types of disturbances were introduced. One of them was resource related disturbance including machine break down and machine recovery. The impact of integrating ACI in agent coordination was investigated by simulating a realistic shop as a multi-agent manufacturing system. In this disturbance, unreality was expressed in terms of mean time between failure and the mean time to repair. Another was source related disturbance including new order\\job arrival and existing order\\job cancellation. To types of agent coordination, namely coordination based on ACI (MAS + ACI) and coordination using FIFO dispatching rule (MAS + FIFO) were compared. Mean flow time, mean tardiness, throughput, buffer size and machine utilization was employed to measure the performance of the proposed approach. Results showed that a MAS + ACI reduced buffer size, max queue number, mean flow time and tardiness. Researchers concluded that a MAS + ACI were outperformed MAS + FIFO. Wang and Usher (2002) presented an agent-based job shop model which employed the contract-net protocol as an agent's negotiation mechanism. In this study, two types of agents, named as job agents and machine cell agents, were used with pure hierarchical control structure. Researchers considered routing flexibility to provide more options for job agents. Average flow time and average queue time were selected as performance measurement. In order to measure the impact of the collaborative factor that was incorporated into the contract-net protocol on the performance, a job shop with five different loading levels were simulated. According to the findings, the collaborative factor did not have much effect on mean flow time when the system load is light, but a significant decrease was observed when the system was heavily loaded. When they examined the average queue time for jobs at each machine cell, they observed that the negotiation scheme with the proposed factor reduced the WIP levels of the bottleneck machine cells when the system was under heavy load. Based on the simulation results, researchers concluded that the collaborative factor could improve the performance of the contract net-based negotiation scheme in agent-based scheduling problems. Wang et al. (2008) proposed a multi-agent approach to study the dynamic scheduling problem in a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) shop floor. The proposed approach was combined with a filtered beam search (FBS). Researchers aimed to show the feasibility of the proposed approach and to evaluate the approach via computational experiments. Dynamisms in this system were provided by new job arrivals. Minimization of a weighted quadratic tardiness function was selected as the objective function. There were two types of agents, a system optimal agent (SOA) and several cell coordinated agents (CCAs). Cooperation and coordination among distributed CCAs and SOA were employed to realize the scheduling goal. Five modules which were called as communication, cooperation and coordination, FBS-based algorithm for decision making, execution and monitoring, human interface, were used. In addition to these modules, one local knowledge base and one capacity database were also included. FIPA CNIP-based negotiation protocol was selected. FBS was performed by filtering phase and beam selection phase. A prototype system was built to show the practicability of the proposed approach. The performance of the proposed scheduling scheme on the prototype system was compared to two dispatching rule combinations. Two dispatching rules were used for cell selection, named as dispatching by objective function value and dispatching by make-span, one dispatching rule for routing assignment, named as modified shortest processing time in the selected cell and one dispatching rule for determination of starting time of an operation on the selected machine. When the results on the performance of the average number of jobs tardy were investigated, researchers indicated that the quality of the global schedules generated with the proposed scheduling scheme was better than those of two dispatching-rue combinations. In addition, researchers sought the time required for a complete process of scheduling negotiation. They concluded that the proposed scheduling scheme was promising for real world implementation in multiple manufacturing cells of size.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 892, "end": 908, "text": "Li and Li (2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2611, "end": 2629, "text": "Tang et al.
