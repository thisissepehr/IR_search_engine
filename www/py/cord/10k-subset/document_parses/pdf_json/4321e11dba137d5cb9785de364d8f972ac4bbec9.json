This axis is emerging as a novel target to attenuate ocular inflammation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the hypothesis that enhancing the activity of the protective axis of RAS by subretinal delivery of an AAV8 (Y733F)-ACE2 vector would protect against the ocular inflammation in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) mice through regulating the local immune responses. Our studies demonstrated that increased ACE2 expression exerts protective effects on inflammation in EAU mouse by modulating ocular immune responses, including the differentiation of Th1/Th17 cells and the polarization of M1/ M2 macrophages; whereas the systemic immune responses appeared not affected. These effects were mediated by activating the Ang-(1-7)/Mas and inhibiting the MAPK, NF-\u03baB and STAT3 signaling pathways. This proof-of-concept study suggests that activation of ocular ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis with AAV gene transfer modulates local immune responses and may be a promising, long-lasting therapeutic strategy for refractory and recurrent uveitis, as well as other inflammatory eye diseases.",

It is one of the main causes of severe visual impairment, even blindness within the working population worldwide 1 . Some uveitis is characterized by recurrence of inflammation that leads to progressive destruction of affected tissues, including the uveal tract, neural retina and adjacent tissues, and consequently compromises the vision of patients. Thus, the refractory autoimmune disease is considered a tremendous challenge for treatment. The conventional treatment of uveitis includes corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents and biologics 2 . However, serious potential side effects limit their use. Furthermore, a significant percentage of patients still do not respond well to these treatments 3 . Therefore, development of effective therapeutic approaches is important and urgent.",

It is a T cell mediated autoimmune disease model that closely resembles several types of uveitic disorders, such as Beh\u00e7et's disease as well as Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease 4,5 . EAU can be induced by immunizing the susceptible animals with a retinal antigen, such as interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), S-antigen, or by adoptive transfer of retinal antigen-specific CD4 + T cells 6-8 . Studies suggest that activated CD4 + T cells play an effector role in the ocular inflammatory pathological process",

            "text": "in human uveitis and in EAU. It is now well recognized that two different T cell effector lineages: Th1 cells which predominantly produce the cytokine IFN-\u03b3 , and Th17 cells in which the hallmark cytokine is IL-17, play crucial roles in uveitis 9 . More importantly, recurrence of autoimmune diseases may also be related to the activation of these T cell effector lineages. Experimental evidence shows that the relapsing/remitting of uveitis was attributed to the increased production of Th1 cytokine, suggesting that recurrent autoimmunity may originate to a degree of the autoreactive T cell 10 . In addition, treatment with mesenchymal stem cells downregulated Th1 and Th17 responses, then ultimately resulted in inhibiting the Th1/Th17-mediated inflammation and reduced the relapse of uveitis as well 11 . The renin angiotensin system (RAS) was classically considered as a circulating hormone system which is essential in modulating the physiologic functions of the cardiovascular and renal systems. Dysfunction of RAS also attributes to the pathogenesis of inflammation and autoimmune diseases. Angiotensin II (Ang II) is the main peptide effector of RAS. It is a potent vasoconstrictor, growth modulator and pro-inflammatory molecule generated from the angiotensinogen through sequential enzymatic cleavages by renin and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 12 . Ang II mediates deleterious effects primarily through a seven trans-membrane G-protein coupled receptor Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) 13 . Nevertheless, the linear cascade of the RAS has been dramatically modified recent years with many new components and pathways 14, 15 . The most notable finding is the discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 cleaves Ang II to generate Angiotensin- (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) [Ang-(1-7)] which mediates counteracting physiologic functions to Ang II via a G-protein coupled receptor Mas. Consequently, a concept of a novel antagonist axis of RAS, i.e. the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis is established 16 . Increasing evidence have demonstrated that activation of this axis not only directly counterbalances the deleterious effects of the classical ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis, but also has a broad range of beneficial effects including ameliorating pathological conditions such as fibrosis and inflammation 17, 18 .",

ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis acts as a negative regulator of the RAS and has become a vital therapeutic target in many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes 19 , autoimmune myocarditis 20 , and arthritis 21 . Moreover, it is protective in several ocular immune diseases. Increased expression of ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) via AAV-mediated gene delivery to the retina diminished retinopathy and inflammation in both mouse and rat models of diabetic retinopathy 22 . Activation of ACE2 is neuroprotective in a glaucoma animal model 23 . More recently, we demonstrated that activating the endogenous ACE2 both systemically and locally evoked beneficial effects by attenuating the inflammation of endotoxin induced uveitis (EIU) in mice and rats 24, 25 . Furthermore, oral delivery of ACE2/Ang-(1-7) bioencapsulated in plant cells conferred protection against ocular inflammation in EAU and EIU mice 26 . Thus, enhancing the ACE2/ Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis of the RAS may be a promising therapeutic approach for ocular inflammation.",

            "text": "However, the underlying mechanisms by which over-expression of ACE2 confer protection against ocular autoimmune inflammation remain poorly understood. We previously showed that the hyper-activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03ba B and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways were involved in the pathological process of EAU and EIU 25, 27 . Expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in CD4 + T cells is essential for the development of EAU, and mice with conditional deletion of STAT3 are completely resistant to EAU 28 . On the other hand, ACE2 activator DIZE mediates anti-inflammatory properties by down-regulating phosphorylation of p38MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), STAT3 and NF-\u03ba B p65 subunit in macrophages 29 . Over-expression of ACE2 significantly inhibits the development of early atherosclerotic lesions in a rabbit model by down-regulating the p38MAPK, ERK1/2 and STAT3 pathways 30 . Hence, we hypothesize that over-expression of ACE2 attenuates the ocular local inflammation in EAU mouse by activating the protective ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis and by inhibition of MAPK, NF-\u03ba B and STAT3 pathways. We employed adeno-associated virus vector serotype 8 (AAV8) vector containing a tyrosine-capsid mutant (Y733F) to deliver the ACE2 gene subretinally since this capsid-modified vector has been shown to provide rapid and efficient gene transduction in adult mouse retina 31 .",

The amplitudes of a-and b-wave represent the function of the photoreceptors and bipolar cells respectively. Representative original ERG responses from AAV8-ACE2 + EAU, AAV8-eGFP+ EAU, EAU and na\u00efve group were shown (Fig. 3a) . ERG responses of na\u00efve mice were used as controls.

Corneal edema, conjunctival hyperemia, hypopyon and posterior synechiae were seen in the AAV8-eGFP+ EAU and EAU group. Whereas there were mild inflammatory signs in the AAV8-ACE2+ EAU group. (c) The severity of clinical scores were remarkably decreased on the 12 th , 14 th and 16 th day in the AAV8-ACE2 treated eyes compared with the AAV8-eGFP treated EAU eyes (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001) and EAU eyes ( # P < 0.05, ### P < 0.001, n = 4-8 per group).

To determine the effects of over-expression of ACE2 on retinal function, both dark-and light-adapted ERG were recorded in EAU mice at the 14 th day after immunization. For dark-adapted ERG, the stimulus light intensity ranged from \u2212 3.0 to 1.0 (log cd-s/m2). For light-adapted ERG, the stimulus light intensities were 0.0 and 1.0 (log cd-s/m2).

Subretinal delivery of AAV8-ACE2 reduced the expression of the inflammatory cytokines in EAU mice. To investigate the effect of ACE2 on the expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in EAU eyes, total RNA was isolated from the retina on the 14 th day after IRBP immunization. Real-time PCR was performed to quantitatively measure the levels of the inflammatory cytokines. Compared with the AAV8-eGFP+ EAU and EAU group, the mRNA levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2 ), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1 ) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were markedly decreased, whereas the expression of IL-10 was significantly increased in the AAV2-ACE2 treated eyes. (Fig. 4 ). In the AAV8-ACE2 + EAU group, there was approximately a 7.8-fold decrease in the mRNA level of IL-6 (p < 0.05) and approximately a 4-fold decrease of IL-1\u03b2 (p< 0.001). The mRNA levels of TNF-\u03b1 and MCP-1 were also significantly reduced in the AAV8-ACE2 treated EAU eyes. There was approximately a 19-fold decrease of TNF-\u03b1 (p < 0.01) and a 4.7-fold decrease of MCP-1 (p < 0.05) compared with the AAV8-eGFP+ EAU group.

The anti-inflammatory effect of ACE2 appeared to result in reducing the expression of inflammatory cytokines and influence the ocular immune responses. The antagonist of Ang-(1-7) A-779 abolished these beneficial effects, suggesting that these protective effects are mediated by activating the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis. Interestingly, increased ACE2 expression might be capable to modulate the ocular local immune responses, including reducing the expression of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17, and shifting the phenotype of macrophages from M1 to M2.

Treatment with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril or with the AT1R antagonist candesartan resulted in the suppression of Th1 and Th17 cytokines (specifically IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17) in a murine model of human multiple sclerosis 48 . It has been shown that blockade of the classical RAS axis alleviated the brain inflammation by reducing the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 in a model of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) 49 and attenuates the clinical symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis by the modulation of the T cell cytokines profile 50 . In addition, Activation of the Mas receptor by Ang-(1-7) significantly ameliorated arthritis in murine models 21 . These results suggest that the RAS system is critically involved in promoting Th1/Th17-mediated autoimmune diseases in different organs.",

Although there was a evidence that NK and NKT cells may be attribute to in part the production of IFN-\u03b3 in EAU, it was just during the innate response phase, thus to shape the effector T cells 51 . In addition, by using immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization, a previous study demonstrated that the presence of IFN-\u03b3 was only localized to the T lymphocytes infiltrated in the retina and uveal tract in the EAU model. Notably, when the inflammatory cells infiltrated in the posterior chamber, no IFN-\u03b3 has been detected 52 . Similarly, despite NKT cells can produce IL-17, it is also happens in the innate response which differs significantly from adaptive IL-17 produced by Th17 effector cells. Moreover, it is produced only by a relatively small NK1.1-negative fraction. As a consequence, its amount is very low and can hardly be detected 53 . Therefore, we strongly believe the expression of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 in the retina can serve as indicators of Th1 and Th17 response in EAU model. Nevertheless, further study are necessary for investigating the possible role of these two signature cytokines in different immune cells and different stages of EAU. It may shed light on potential novel therapeutic targets to protect against uveitis in further studies.",

Furthermore, we found a down-regulated M1/M2 ratio with the treatment of AAV8-ACE2 in the EAU retinas. However, subretinal injection with AAV8-ACE2 or AAV8-eGFP did not influence the polarization of macrophages in spleens or DLNs.

It has been suggested that these signaling pathways were involved in the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis mediated protection. Indeed, by modulating Ang-(1-7) and Mas receptor, an ACE inhibitor olmesartan exerts cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in the experimental autoimmune myocarditis model through decreasing the phosphorylation of p38MAPK, extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) and jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways 63 . In addition, in an allergic asthma mouse model, Ang-(1-7) ameliorated inflammation which was attributed to one of the MAPK family members, the ERK and NF-\u03ba B signaling pathway 64 . Most recently, it was shown DIZE, an activator of endogenous ACE2, remarkably suppressed LPS induced production of proinflammatory cytokines.

            "text": "Many uveitis patients are prone to relapse, the prolonged inflammation often results in a chronic refractory inflammation. After the conventional medications, patients still suffer from recurrent inflammation, suggesting that the treatments can not completely eliminate the pathogenic factors. We found that activating the ACE2/ Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis effectively suppressed the Th1/Th17 responses which not only contribute to the primary inflammation process of uveitis, but also may play an important role in the recurrent inflammation in autoimmune uveitis 11 . Therefore, it is practical to provide a long-lasting strategy to enhance the protective axis of the RAS in these uveitis patients. Moreover, long-term application of the conventional treatments, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, may cause various systemic and local unwanted side effects. Thus topical administration has an advantage of less risk of potential off-target side effects. AAV vector mediated gene therapy for ocular diseases has been successfully applied in human and animal for more than a decade 65 . In view of recent clinical trials 66 , the safety of AAV mediated gene therapy of ocular diseases has been warranted. Furthermore, AAV-associated gene therapies were shown to be highly effective. Existing evidences showed that AAV-mediated ACE2 gene delivery ameliorated the inflammatory responses in diabetic retinopathy 22, 67 . Moreover, oral delivery of ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) vector resulted in down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines in EIU and EAU models 26 . Meanwhile a single AAV vector injection yields a long-term target gene expression which is ideal for treating the chronic and recurrent uveitis. Therefore, AAV mediated ACE2 delivery may be a promising novel intervention for uveitis, as well as other chronic ocular inflammatory conditions. However, there are some limitations in our study. First, although the safety of systemic ACE2 activator application 24 and AAV mediated gene therapy of ocular diseases has been warranted in several clinical trials 66 , and we did not observed any systemic and ocular side effects in our study, it is unknown whether long-term ocular ACE2 over-expression would cause any unwanted systemic or local adverse effects. Hence, a long-term safety study of local ACE2 over-expression should be carried out. Second, to ensure the transferred gene to be functional, we delivered the vectors three weeks before inducing the EAU. Thus enhanced ACE2 occurred before the on-set of inflammation and our study described a prophylactic effect of enhancing ACE2 in the inflammatory process. Nevertheless, in most cases, since it takes a few weeks for the transferred gene to be functional and since it is impossible to treat the patients preventively, we can't modify the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis for the initial uveitis patients by gene therapy in a timely manner. However, a combination of an ACE2 activator, such as DIZE together with gene transfer may be a practical option for these initial patients. Theoretically, it appears that this issue is not a problem for the recurrent patients.",

Of significant interest, the protective axis is limited to modulate the local immune responses, including the differentiation of Th1/Th17 cells and the polarization of M1/M2 macrophages. In contrast to systemic administration, local gene delivery of the ACE2 may significantly reduce the off-target risks. In addition, gene delivery achieves a long-term activation of the RAS protective axis and thus may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for refractory and recurrent uveitis as well as other ocular autoimmune inflammatory diseases.",

Subretinal injection was performed according to the method described previously 33 . All procedures were performed under antiseptic conditions. Briefly, the eyes were dilated by topical administration of compound tropicamide eye drops (Sinqi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shenyang, China). An aperture within the dilated pupil area was made through the cornea with a 30-gauge needle, then a blunt 33-gauge needle was inserted through the aperture, avoiding damage the lens and penetrating the neuroretina under a dissecting microscope (Leica, DMR, Deerfield, IL,USA). The successful delivery of vector was confirmed by viewing fluorescein-positive subretinal blebs demarcating the retinal detachment in the injected retinal area. Such detachments usually can be resolved spontaneously within 1 to 2 days. The damages occasionally induced by ocular injection included temporal corneal edema, iris hemorrhage or cataract formation. The animals with any of these complications were excluded from further study. All animals received antibiotic ointment to the cornea and were observed daily after operation. The vectors were injected subretinally into the right eyes of the mice, the lateral eyes were not injected and served as a control. Clinical and histological assessment of EAU. Clinical signs of EAU were examined by slit-lamp microscopy from day 7 to day 21 after immunization. The clinical severity of ocular inflammation was assessed by two independent observers in a masked manner, and scored on a scale of 0-5 in half-point increments, according to five separate criteria described previously 33 . To evaluate the histopathology changes, mice were sacrificed at the 14 th day after IRBP peptide immunization. Eyes were enucleated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Eyeballs were embedded in paraffin. Serial 4 \u03bc m sections were cut through the cornea-optic nerve axis and stained by haematoxylin and eosin (H&E).

For investigating the signal transduction mechanism involving MAPK, NF-\u03ba B and STAT3 pathways with the corresponding inhibitors on IRBP immunized lymphocytes, the spleens and draining lymph nodes were removed from EAU mice on the 14 th day after immunization. Cell suspension was prepared by mechanical disruption and followed by a passage through a cell strainer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The lymphocytes were separated by using a specific lymphocyte separation kit (TBDscience, Tianjin, China). The RBC lysis buffer was applied to the cells after gradient centrifugation with the Ficoll-hypaque separation buffer, so that the contamination of RBC could be excluded. Although the lymphocytes are a subset of leukocytes, we can still detect the expression of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 which are mainly produced by Th1 and Th17 cells, rather than other leukocytes 9,68 , to reflect the severity of EAU.
