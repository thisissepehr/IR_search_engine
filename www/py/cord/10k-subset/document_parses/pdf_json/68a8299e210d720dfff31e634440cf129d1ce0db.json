By combining this procedure with one in which asymmetrically amplified DNA is used for sequencing (ref. 3 and Fig. l) , we have demonstrated that DNA amplified from a bacterial colony can be sequenced directly by the dideoxy chain-termination method to yield results as good as those obtained when purified template DNA is used for amplification (ref. 4 and Fig. 2 ). By end-labeling the primer that is used in limiting amounts during the amplification step and using it for sequencing, an entire insert of 300 nucleotides or less can be sequenced in one step. Inserts of larger size can be sequenced by using labeled primers that bind within the amplified single-stranded DNA sequence. The procedure is rapid and enables one to obtain sequences from as many as 20 clones in a single day. Fig. 1 . The asymmetric PCR reaction. In the procedure described in this chapter, primer 2 is the limiting primer and will be 5' end-lab&d and used in the sequencing reaction for sequencing the single-stranded DNA product.",

Purify end-labeled primer by passing it through a BioSpin column that has been equilibrated with water according to manufacturer's instructions. 4. Estimate the volume of eluate and use 0.1 vol (x pL used in Section 3.3., step 1 below) (1 pmol of radiolabeled primer) in the sequencing reaction below. One microliter of the eluate can be counted to determine the specific activity of the radiolabeled primer. Approximately lo6 cpm Cerenkov counts/pmol primer is needed.",

Formamide stop solution: 95% deionized formamide, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 10 mM EDTA, DNA sequencing gel for DNA amplified directly from bacterial cells (A) or from purified DNA (B). A cloned 1.7-kb fragment containing the bovine coronavirus nucleocapsid protein gene (5) was subcloned into the pGEM-32 vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and grown in E. coli strain JM 109. The reverse and forward (universal) primers for the pGEM system were used as primers 1 and 2, respectively, for asymmetric amplification and DNA sequencing. For (A) the toothpick method was used, and for (B) 5 ng of purified DNA was used as template in the asymmetric amplification reaction. Reprinted by permission from ref. 4. Prepare a 40-pL PCR reaction mix by adding together 33.2 pL of water, 4 p.L of 10X PCR buffer, 0.8 j.tL of dNTP mix, 1 p.L of 10 pM primer 1, and 1 pL of 0.1 jt.M primer 2. (10 pmol of primer 1 and 0.1 pmol of primer 2, the limiting primer, are used in this reaction.End-labeled primer 2 will be used in the sequencing reaction described in Section 3.3.) 2. With a sterile toothpick, add a few cells from an isolated bacterial colony into the reaction mix. 3. Heat for 15 min at 95\"C, then chill on ice. 4. Add 10 pL (1.25 U) of Taq DNA polymerase in 1X PCR buffer. 5. Cover with two drops mineral oil. 6. Amplify by PCR using the following cycle profile: essentially the forward reaction as described by Satnbrook et al.(6).",
