Targeting S1PR1, which is known to modulate the immune response, provides protection against pathogenic influenza virus. The functional role and molecular mechanism of S1PR1 were analysed by generating inducible endothelial cell-specific S1PR1 knockout mice and assessing the therapeutic efficacy of the selective S1PR1 agonist CYM5442 against acute lung injury (ALI) induced by the 2009 influenza A H1N1 virus. Immune-mediated pulmonary injury is aggravated by the absence of endothelial S1PR1 and alleviated by treatment with CYM-5442, suggesting a protective function of S1PR1 signaling during H1N1 infection. S1PR1 signaling does not affect viral clearance in mice infected with influenza. Mechanistically, the MAPK and NF-kB signaling pathways are involved in the ALI mediated by S1PR1 in infected mice. Combined administration of the S1PR1 agonist CYM-5442 and the antiviral drug oseltamivir provides maximum protection from ALI. Our current study provides insight into the molecular mechanism of S1PR1 mediating the ALI induced by H1N1 infection and indicates that the combination of S1PR1 agonist with antiviral drug could potentially be used as a therapeutic remedy for future H1N1 virus pandemics.",

Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), the metabolic product of sphingomyelinase activity, is a potent immunomodulatory small molecule 8 . Platelets, red blood cells and endothelium are believed to be the main sources of S1P 9-11 . S1PR1, a receptor for the bioactive lipid S1P, is expressed on lymphocytes, dendritic cells and endothelial cells 3 . Endothelial S1PR1 activation is the key regulator of influenza virus-induced cytokine storm 3 . S1P binding to S1PR1 on the endothelial cell surface can limit the migration of effector lymphocytes to immunologic injury areas, down-modulate the number of virus-specific T cells, blunt cytokine/chemokine expression and reduce the supply of innate inflammatory cells (e.g. natural killer cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages) 3,7,12-15 .",

However, S1PR1-deleted mice die at the embryonic stage as a result of oedema, extensive haemorrhage and defective vascular maturation 17, 18 .

The lung wet/dry weight ratios in S1PR1 ECKO mice were significantly higher than those in control mice (P = 0.028) (Fig. 2B) . We next examined whether S1PR1 gene ablation results in an increased degree of inflammatory response induced by virus infection. At 5 days post-infection, histological evaluation of S1PR1 ECKO mouse lungs showed an aggravation of lung injury evidenced by massive pulmonary tissue consolidation, excessive exudation in the alveolar air sacs, vascular haemorrhaging, increased alveolar wall thickness, hyaline membrane formation and considerable inflammatory cell infiltration (Fig. 2C) . A significant increase in the number of infiltrating inflammatory cells was evident in the lungs of S1PR1 ECKO mice (P = 0.030) (Fig. 2D) . At 48 hours post-infection, the concentrations of total protein in S1PR1 ECKO mouse BALF were significantly increased compared with those in control mouse BALF (P = 0.024) (Fig. 2E) , while the abundance of cytokine/chemokine was markedly upregulated in S1PR1 ECKO mouse BALF (Fig. 2F) . Analysis of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL2, CXCL10, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in BALF revealed significantly higher levels in S1PR1 ECKO mice than in control mice. S1PR1 activation by CYM-5442 suppresses the excessive immune response induced by H1N1 infection. Control mice treated with CYM-5442 were much heavier than the vehicle-treated controls (P < 0.001), whereas there was no significant difference in the weight of S1PR1 ECKO mice between those treated with vehicle or with CYM-5442 (Fig. 3A) . The survival rates of the four groups were recorded (Fig. 3B) . Treatment with CYM-5442 significantly improved the survival rate (45%) after influenza challenge compared with that of mice receiving vehicle (10%) in control mice (P = 0.033), but there was no effect in S1PR1 ECKO mice. The pulmonary oedema was measured by wet/dry ratios (Fig. 3C ). On day 5 post-infection, the CYM-5442 treatment significantly reduced wet/dry ratios (P = 0.012) in control mouse lungs but not in S1PR1 ECKO mouse lungs. Histopathology of lungs showed that CYM-5442 administration greatly ameliorated immune-mediated lung damage with markedly decreased tissue consolidation and haemorrhage, thinner alveolar walls, and reduced inflammatory cell accumulation versus lungs from control mice receiving the vehicle (Fig. 3D ). Compared to those of vehicle-treated control mice, there was a significant reduction in the number of inflammatory cells in the lungs (Fig. 3E ) and in the cytokines/chemokines in the BALFs (Fig. 3F ) of CYM-5442-treated mice. In S1PR1 ECKO mice, compared with vehicle recipients, the levels of cytokines/chemokines in CYM-5442 recipients showed a declining trend, although there was no statistical significance.",

In our study, the immunopathology induced by influenza virus infection was not improved by CYM-5442 in S1PR1 ECKO mice, indicating that S1PR1 expression on endothelial cells is critical in CYM-5442-induced lung protection.",

The MAPK family has been shown to play important roles in influenza virus-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression 19, 23, 24 . Therefore, we investigated the effect of CYM-5442 on the activation (phosphorylation) of MAPK components induced by virus infection. We noted that influenza virus infection increased the activation of MAPK pathway components, including ERK1/2 and JNK1/2, whereas CYM-5442 inhibited the activation of the MAPK pathway, which was accompanied by alterations in the levels of cytokines/chemokines. As the NF-\u03baB pathway is a key signaling pathway that mediates the production and release of antimicrobial molecules to activate the immune response 25, 26 , we assessed the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit, which is essential for the activation and translocation of NF-\u03baB heterodimers. We found that activation of p65 was upregulated by H1N1 infection and downregulated by CYM-5442 administration in infected mice, confirming a previous in vitro report 16 . Mechanistically, our study provided in vivo validation of the critical role of MAPK and NF-kB signaling pathways through which S1PR1 signaling may ameliorate ALI induced by influenza virus infection. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The combination therapy of CYM-5442 and oseltamivir gave the greatest therapeutic benefit in virulent influenza virus infections. The survival rate, lung histopathology and pulmonary oedema alterations in the combination-treated mice were significantly improved. During inflammation, increased levels of cytokines/ chemokines result in the recruitment of immune cells into inflamed sites 27, 28 , while an aberrant immune response with robust cytokines/chemokines secretion and excessive inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung is the key contributor to the morbidity and mortality of 2009 H1N1 infections 3, 22 . After treatment with a combination of CYM-5442 and oseltamivir, the levels of responsive cytokines/chemokines were significantly reduced in the infected mice.",

K. B. Walsh 7 demonstrated that S1PR1 agonist treatment can blunt dendritic cell activation and hamper the proliferation of T cells, resulting in a smaller number of virus-specific T cells. Thus, activation of S1PR1 generates a sufficient anti-influenza virus T-cell response that terminates the infection. We found that CYM-5442 did not disrupt the kinetics of viral clearance in vivo but successfully limited immune-mediated pulmonary injury. Oseltamivir inhibits influenza virus neuraminidase activity, preventing the release of newly replicated virions from the surface of lysed cells, ultimately reducing viral load. The joint regimen of oseltamivir and CYM-5442 produced the best therapeutic effects in treatment of H1N1 infection in mice model. Therefore, utilizing a combination of the S1PR1 agonist CYM-5442 which controls immunopathologic injury and the antiviral neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir which inhibits viral replication, could achieve optimal results.",

Signaling by nonessential but injurious S1P receptors that are associated with several side effects, e.g., airway hyperresponsiveness, bradycardia, lymphopenia and vascular barrier disruption, is likely to limit their utility in ALI syndromes [34] [35] [36] [37] , which indicates that selectivity of the S1P receptor is important. Our data provide strong evidence in vivo that activated S1PR1 in endothelial cells is an essential component for dampening the destructive immune response against influenza virus infection. Hence, a therapeutic approach using selective S1PR1 agonists is of particular interest.",

The absence of analysis of delayed administration at the time when the immune response is most destructive is a shortcoming in the study. In actual real world situations, people will not receive treatment until 1-2 days after infection. A delayed therapy, e.g, starting at 6 or 24 hours or later after infection, needs further investigation. Additionally, we did not perform experiments to show which cell types and how these cells contribute to cytokine induced pathology during infection in S1PR1 ECKO mice. However, previous literature has demonstrated that endothelial cells are a source of cytokines/chemokines in the lung during influenza infection, and that S1PR1 signaling in the endothelium provides a mechanism for inhibiting cytokine storms and blunting the accumulation of innate inflammatory infiltrates characterized as macrophages/monocytes, neutrophils, and NK cells 3, 7 . Another limitation is that the role of the CYM-5442 ligand in virus-specific adaptive immune cell recruitment was not checked. It will be an important future direction of our research.",

Wildtype (WT) mice were infected with 10 5.5 TCID50 of H1N1 virus and either vehicle, CYM-5442, oseltamivir or combined CYM-5442 and oseltamivir were administered to mice. (A) Kaplan-Meier survival curves (n = 20). For mice treated with vehicle alone, 15% survived at 10 days after infection. Compared with vehicle administration, CYM-5442 administration alone enhanced survival (45% vs. 15%; P = 0.02). Combined treatment further enhanced survival (75% vs. 15%; P < 0.001) and was more efficient than CYM-5442 (75% vs. 45%; P = 0.03) and oseltamivir (75% vs. 30%; P = 0.001) treatments alone. (B) Lung wet/dry weight ratios on day 5 post-infection (n = 6). (C) Histopathologic analysis of pulmonary tissues on day 5 post-infection. Pathological images showed less inflammatory cell infiltration, haemorrhage and pulmonary oedema in the three treatment groups than in the vehicle group. Tissue injury was minimal in the combined treatment group. Magnification: 200\u00d7 ; scale bars, 100 \u03bcm. (D) Assessment of inflammatory cell accumulation on day 5 post-infection (n = 5). (E) Analysis of total protein in BALF at 48 hours post-infection (n = 5). (F) Levels of cytokines/chemokines in BALF at 48 hours post-infection (n = 5). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001. These data are representative of three experiments and are shown as the means \u00b1 SEM.",
