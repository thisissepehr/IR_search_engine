These solutions characterize the propagating progress and speed of the spatial spread of underlying epidemic waves. For the first diffusion system, we find a lower bound for wave speeds and prove that the traveling waves exist for all speeds bigger than this bound. For the second diffusion system, we find the minimal wave speed and show that the traveling waves exist for all speeds bigger than or equal to the minimal speed. We further prove the uniqueness (up to translation) of these solutions for sufficiently large wave speeds. The existence of these solutions are proved by a shooting argument combining with LaSalle's invariance principle, and their uniqueness by a geometric singular perturbation argument.",

            "text": "epidemics and provide effective control strategies and useful predictions, mathematical modelling of epidemics has become a major focus of research for understanding the underlying mechanisms that influence the spread and transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. Many epidemic models have been developed [2, 4, 6, 13, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33] . In particular, reactiondiffusion equation models and integro-differential equation models have been used to study the spatial spread of infectious diseases, and their traveling wavefront solutions have been used to investigate the question of whether an infectious disease could persist as a wave front of infectives that travels geographically across vast distances. Relevant problems include to determine the thresholds above which traveling waves exist, find the minimum speed and asymptotic speed of propagation (which are usually equal) [3] , and determine the stability of the traveling wave to perturbations [20] . Due to the complexity of the models, these problems often present very challenging dynamical system problems, on which extensive research has been done since the pioneering works of Fisher [10] and Kolmogorov et al. [19] ; consequently, many outstanding results have been obtained, and various methods and techniques have been developed to tackle these problems (see, e.g., [11, 13, 25, 27, 28, 31, 33] and the references therein). With the current development of more realistic and sophisticated epidemic models, the study on these problems remains very active in mathematical epidemiology.",

            "text": "In this paper, we study traveling wavefront solutions for two reaction-diffusion systems, both are derived as diffusion approximations to their integro-differential equations models. These models are spatial analogs of a basic SIRS endemic model in one spatial dimension. The first model is a distributed-contacts model with a kernel describing daily contacts of infectives with their neighbors or the influences, by any reason, of the infectives on their neighbors. This model, which was studied recently by Li et al. [20] , extends a distributed-contacts model of Kendall [18] (a spatial analogue of a SI endemic model). The second model is a nonlocal diffusion model describing the mobility of individuals around the spatial domain. This model generalizes a distributed-infectives model considered by Medlock and Kot [24] and nonlocal dispersal models in [16, 22] . Following the approaches used in Bailey [4] , Hoppensteadt [13] and Kendall [18] , the aforementioned nonlocal models are approximated by reactiondiffusion systems when their kernels are local. The aim of this paper is to show the existence of traveling waves for these diffusion approximations. In this and the next two sections, we concentrate our study on the first model, and in Sect. 4 we establish corresponding results for the second model. The basic SIRS model mentioned above is described by a system of ODEs for the evolution of an infectious disease in a well-mixed and closed population. Dividing the total population into susceptible, infective, and recovered classes, with s(t), i(t), and r (t) denoting the fractions of their population sizes at time t respectively (thus s + i + r \u2261 1), the governing equations of the model are:",

In Sect. 2, we first change the system (1.5) by introducing new independent variable \u03be into an equivalent system (2.1), in which the denominator 1 \u2212 I \u2212 R in (1.5) is removed. We prove Theorem 2.2 for the new system (2.1), whose existence part is proved by a shooting argument in combination with LaSalle's invariance principle. Roughly speaking, we first show that a portion of the 2-dimensional locally unstable manifold W u (O) of (2.1) lies inside a triangular pyramid (see Figs. 1, 2), then by a shooting argument that there exists at least one solution of (2.1) lying on this portion of W u (O) and Sketched are the pyramid without its top face ABC, the set 0 (i.e., the sector O A B ), and three solution orbits of (2.1) from 0 , with the middle one being a heteroclinic orbit claimed in Theorem 2.2 (i) in the case that E is spiral remaining in the pyramid on (\u2212\u221e, \u221e), and then by LaSalle's invariance principle that this solution approaches E as \u03be \u2192 \u221e. Such an approach was first developed by Dunbar [8] and subsequently simplified and generalized by, e.g., Huang et al. [14] , Lin et al. [21] , and Huang [15] . Nevertheless, it is not an easy task to carry out this approach for (2.1) due to its particular feature. In Sect. 3, we prove the uniqueness part of Theorem 2.2 by a geometric singular perturbation argument [1] . This argument also gives a shorter existence proof for sufficiently large c 2 /D. In Sect. 4, we establish a similar theorem to Theorem 2.2 for the second model.",
