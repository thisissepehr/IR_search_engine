Therefore, we have developed \"AVP-IC 50 Pred,\" a regression-based algorithm to predict the antiviral activity in terms of IC 50 values (lM). A total of 759 nonredundant peptides from AVPdb and HIPdb were divided into a training/test set having 683 peptides (T 683 ) and a validation set with 76 independent peptides (V 76 ) for evaluation. We utilized important peptide sequence features like amino-acid compositions, binary profile of N8-C8 residues, physicochemical properties and their hybrids. Four different machine learning techniques (MLTs) namely Support vector machine, Random Forest, Instance-based classifier, and K-Star were employed. During 10-fold cross validation, we achieved maximum Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) of 0.66, 0.64, 0.56, 0.55, respectively, for the above MLTs using the best combination of feature sets. All the predictive models also performed well on the independent validation dataset and achieved maximum PCCs of 0.74, 0.68, 0.59, 0.57, respectively, on the best combination of feature sets. The AVP-IC 50 Pred web server is anticipated to assist the researchers working on antiviral therapeutics by enabling them to computationally screen many compounds and focus experimental validation on the most promising set of peptides, thus reducing cost and time efforts.

            "text": "A ntiviral peptides (AVPs) have recently emerged as an alternative strategy to fight disease causing viruses. 1 The peptide Enfuvirtide (T20) is the first AVP approved by the FDA against HIV. 2 Similarly, Sifuvirtide (SFT) peptide has shown potent anti-HIV activity and pharmacokinetic profiles and is under phase-II clinical trial. 3 The peptide CIGB-228 has shown potency against Human papilloma virus (HPV) infections and is under Phase II clinical trial. 4 A peptide-based HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitope capable of inducing both cellular and humoral responses is in phase I clinical trials against Hepatitis C virus (HCV). 5 Another synthetic peptide (SPC3) was reported to prevent the HIV infection and is being evaluated for its antiviral properties in phase II clinical trials. 6 Since peptides are involved in a number of cellular processes, they have a considerable potential to act as drugs in treating human diseases. Many peptide-based drugs are already generating billions of dollars in annual sales. 7 Peptide-based drugs like penicillin and insulin has been widely used as therapeutics. 8 Antimicrobial peptides are produced by living organisms as a means of defense against invading microbes including bacteria, protozoa, fungi and viruses, for example, cathelicidins, defensins, histatins, and so forth. 9 Lately, antimicrobial peptides have been used to control different types of pathogens, particularly viruses 1,10 which are a major cause of malaise and death in the world because of their high genetic variation, different routes of transmission, efficient replication, and the capability to persist in the host cells. 11 Although there are several traditional antiviral nucleoside and non-nucleoside analogues against few viruses, many of these drugs have undesirable toxic effects. 12 Whereas, AVPs with natural amino acids have lesser toxicity and are easily eliminated from the body. 13 The AVPs block the viruses via different strategies including inhibition of virus fusion, signaling, replication, and so forth. 14 They can interact with various glycosaminoglycans on the cell surface and thus compete with the virus for attachment sites. They may obstruct viral entry by binding virus fusion protein or cellular receptors needed for virus internalization. They can also hinder viral gene expression or translation via inhibition of essential viral proteins like polymerase, reverse transcriptase, and so forth. 15 The earliest reports of AVPs were described for herpes simplex virus (HSV). 16 Daher reported a-defensin as an AVP against HSV. 17 Melittin peptide has been noted to have inhibitory activity against HIV 18 and Junin virus (JV). 10 Similarly alloferon peptides have been demonstrated to inhibit influenza virus. 19 Peptides derived from human lactoferricin were shown to possess potent antiviral activity against a variety of viruses. 20 Generally, the efficacy of AVPs is measured as the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) which is a quantitative measure to signify the concentration of a molecule or drug required to block a given biological process by half (50%). 21 For example, \"FluPep\" blocks Influenza virus entry into the cells with an IC 50 of 0.10 lM. 22 Also, peptides derived from RhoA protein restrict Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replication and the best performing peptide accomplished an IC 50 of 1.23 lM. 23 Similarly, Pinon et al. 24 were able to inhibit Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) protease using AVPs with a minimum IC 50 of 0.28 lM. Also, Ray et al. 25 demonstrated the ability of small peptides in inhibiting HCV translation as well as replication by disrupting the interaction between NS3 protease and HCV IRES with an IC 50 value of 5 lM.",

It has been found by earlier researchers that a given class of peptides follow a certain pattern as is the case with antimicrobial peptide prediction algorithms like APD2, 48 CAMP, 47 AntiBP2, 49 Class-AMP, 56 AMPA, 57 and so forth. To further address this issue, we have used LOVOCV strategy 37 in which AVPs from each virus are iteratively excluded and the classifier is trained on AVPs of the remaining viruses followed by testing on the excluded AVPs. This approach worked for 38 out of 42 viruses. Predictive performance for IC 50 of each virus was satisfactory for most of the viruses despite the fact that their data was not included during training. It shows that AVP-IC 50 Pred can act as a general AVP prediction algorithm, which may be applied to other viruses as well. However, there are a few exceptions like HIV, RSV, INFV A and HSV for which algorithm did not work. It can be due to the fact that some viruses differ in their manner of infection/life cycle and hence mechanism or mode of action of AVPs may differ in some cases. Therefore we have provided virus specific models for the above viruses and also integrated them on the web server. In the future, we are interested in making target specific algorithms once appropriate and enough data are available.",

For example, in similar studies of siRNAs, it was found that the PCC ranged from 0.4 to 0.6 on heterogeneous datasets while it increased to 0.7-0.8 on homogenous datasets. 37, 58 The SVM models in this study were developed using a highly diverse dataset taken from 125 different studies tested in 64 cell lines against 42 viruses. So the PCC of 0.66 in regression mode is reasonable. This performance can be improved further if a large homogeneous dataset is available in future. However, to put more confidence in our present prediction, we used three more MLTs in addition to SVM namely, RF, IBk and K* which performed in a similar fashion. This will also encourage developing newer regression-based algorithms besides the existing classification-based methods in the area of peptide-based therapeutics.",

            "text": "There are limited reports of experimentally improving the IC 50 value of AVPs or to overcome their virus resistance by amino acid substitutions. Izumi et al. 59 designed an enfuvirtide variant containing the S138A substitution and showed that it is a potent inhibitor of both enfuvirtide -sensitive and enfuvirtide -resistant viruses. Also it was shown that mutation of four Cterminal amino acids (WNWF to ANAA) of the enfuvirtide peptide made it inactive. 60 Dwyer et al. 61 found that the mutations, which increased peptide helical structure, were more effective in blocking the virus. All such improvements in the peptide efficacy were achieved after considerable efforts in terms of time and cost. Had there been an algorithm which generates the possible mutants of a potential AVP and predict its efficacy, these results might have been achieved in lesser time. Simultaneously, AVPs with improved efficacy might be useful against mutated viruses. To assist the researchers in this direction, AVP-IC 50 Pred mutation analyzer tool will be useful in designing AVPs with enhanced antiviral potential as illustrated in the \"Application\" section. Further, prediction and analysis of IC 50 of all single mutants of the AVPs in our dataset have been provided on our web server. Besides, AVP-IC 50 Pred web server has also been equipped with some important tools such as physicochemical properties calculator, Motif scan, BLAST, Conservation, Map, and fragment tool for further analysis of the AVPs. 50 Pred is the first regression-based algorithm developed using experimentally validated data sets for prediction of peptide antiviral activity in terms of IC 50 . Multiple MLTs were used to build comprehensive prediction models exploiting important peptide sequence features such as amino acid and dipeptide compositions, binary profile of N8-C8 residues as well as selected physicochemical properties. AVP-IC 50 Pred web server is hoped to assist the researchers working on AVP therapeutics by decreasing the cost and time efforts involved in experimental validation.",
