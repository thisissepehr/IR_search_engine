They are generated through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane and release of interluminal vesicles. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that macrophages infected with Mycobacterium release exosomes that promote activation of both innate and acquired immune responses; however, the components present in exosomes inducing these host responses were not defined. This study used LC-MS/MS to identify 41 mycobacterial proteins present in exosomes released from M. tuberculosis-infected J774 cells. Many of these proteins have been characterized as highly immunogenic. Further, since most of the mycobacterial proteins identified are actively secreted, we hypothesized that macrophages treated with M. tuberculosis culture filtrate proteins (CFPs) would release exosomes containing mycobacterial proteins. We found 29 M. tuberculosis proteins in exosomes released from CFPtreated J774 cells, the majority of which were also present in exosomes isolated from M. tuberculosis-infected cells. The exosomes from CFP-treated J774 cells could promote macrophage and dendritic cell activation as well as activation of na\u00efve T cells in vivo.

Exosomes are one type of bioactive vesicle that has received considerable attention, as they are derived from the release of intraluminal vesicles upon fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane and therefore contain constituents present in the endocytic network [1, 2] . Moreover, exosomes are functionally diverse and known to be released from numerous cell types including cells of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic origin. Exosome release was originally observed in maturing reticulocytes and appears to function in eliminating nonessential proteins from the maturing red blood cells. Later studies demonstrated that exosomes derived from B cells and other antigen-presenting cells were enriched for MHC class II, as well as co-stimulatory molecules like CD86 and could present antigens to sensitized T cells [3] .

In addition, previous studies indicated that CFP-10 and ESAT-6 are secreted from the M.tb as a complex [16] and suggest that these proteins might also be in exosomes. Although we observed the presence of CFP-10 by Western blot, we found that exosomes released from infected J774 cells also contain ESAT-6 by LC-MS/MS (Fig. 1, Table 1 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1235, "end": 1239, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 392, "end": 400, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 674, "end": 683, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1449, "end": 1465, "text": "(Fig. 1, Table 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Western blot analysis of exosomes"}, {"text": "Since our proteomic analysis indicated that the majority of M.tb proteins present in exosomes are known to be secreted, we hypothesized that the majority of these exosome proteins result from the release from the mycobacteria and not from mycobacterial lysis within the macrophage.

This hypothesis is supported by the previous studies where macrophages exposed to Toxoplasma gondii protein antigens produced exosomes containing a subset of these proteins [17] . We observed a similar finding as exosomes isolated from CFP-treated J774 cells (CFP-exosomes) contained many of the same proteins we observed in exosomes released from M.tb-infected macrophages including the antigen 85 complex, GroES, MPT63 among others (Tables 1 and 2 ). In fact only six unique proteins were found in CFP-exosomes. This is not surprising since 95% of the proteins found in exosomes from M.tb-infected J774 cells have been experimentally shown or computationally predicted to be secreted (Table 1 ). In summary, 41 mycobacterial proteins were identified in exosomes from M.tbinfected J774 cells, whereas 29 were identified from CFPtreated cells (Supporting Information Tables 4 and 5 ).

Interestingly, when similar quantities of CFP-exosomes or CFP alone were used, CFP-exosomes promoted a more robust TNF-a response compared with ex vivo stimulation with CFP, suggesting either an enrichment of molecules in exosomes that can stimulate TNF-a production by splenic cells (likely macrophages) or more efficient presentation of these molecules to the splenic cells to promote TNF-a production. The similar IFN-g production by splenocytes treated ex vivo with CFP-exosomes compared with CFP alone also suggest that either the exosomes contain the most potent M.tb culture filtrate antigens or that the exosomes are more efficient at transferring a limited number of M.tb antigens to antigenpresenting cells for presentation to antigen-specific T cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 189, "end": 195, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Exosomes from CFP-treated macrophages can activate resting macrophages and sensitized lymphocytes"}, {"text": "Based on the presence of prominent M.tb antigens on CFPexosomes and our previous studies with exosomes from BCG-infected macrophages, we hypothesized that the exosomes from CFP-treated J774 cells could activate na\u00efve CD41 and CD81 T cells in vivo. To test this prediction, mice were administered intranasally with exosomes from uninfected or CFP-treated cells 1/\u00c0 adjuvant as described in Section 2 and 2 wk after the final vaccination the lungs, MLN and spleens were harvested. Single cell suspensions were stimulated ex vivo with CFP and the T cells were analyzed for proliferation, IFN-g production and memory phenotype. As shown in Fig. 5 , both CD41 and CD81 T cells isolated from mice treated with CFP-exosomes showed increased production of IFN-g upon restimulation with CFP and this was evident in all three organs. The adjuvant did not have a significant effect on the number of T cells which were positive for IFN-g, suggesting that exosomes contain both adjuvant and antigenic properties. This conclusion is supported by the data shown in Fig. 3 which indicate that exosomes from CFP-treated cells can promote DC activation. CD41 and CD81 T cells isolated from mice treated with CFP-exosomes but not from mice treated with uninfected exosomes also showed increased proliferation when stimulated ex vivo with CFP (Figs. 5D and E). Previous studies indicated that antigen-specific effector memory cells may play an important role in protection against M.tb in BCG-vaccinated individuals [18, 19] . Therefore, we addressed whether effector memory cells were produced in mice vaccinated with CFP-exosome and found CD44 hi , CD62L low CD41 and CD81 T cells, which is indicative of effector memory cells, in all three organs (Figs. 5F and G). Together, the data suggest that vaccination of mice with exosomes isolated from CFP-treated J774 cells can induce a profile of T-cell activation often associated with M.tb control (i.e. IFN-g production and effector memory cells).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1496, "end": 1500, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1501, "end": 1504, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 636, "end": 642, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1056, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Exosomes from CFP-treated macrophages can activate na\u00efve CD41 and CD81 murine T cells in vivo"}, {"text": "Previous studies indicate that exosomes isolated from M.tbinfected macrophages can have immune modulatory activity [6, 20] . The exosomes activated both the innate and the acquired immune responses suggesting the presences of multiple mycobacterial components. However, in these previous reports only the antigen 85 complex was identified. In this study, an MS proteomic approach was taken to identify the mycobacterial proteins present in exosomes released from M.tb-infected J774 cells. A surprisingly high number of mycobacterial proteins (i.e. 41) were identified along with a number of expected host proteins. Why the high number and why these particular proteins? Most of the identified proteins are known to be secreted by M.tb and some, including the fibronectin attachment protein have been shown previously to be released outside the phagosome [21] . Recent studies have identified two major mechanisms by which proteins are targeted to the intraluminal vesicles of MVBs for subsequent release in exosomes. One involves ubiquitination of proteins which is recognized by the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery for subsequent trafficking and retention of proteins in the intraluminal vesicles [22] . A second mechanism appears to involve aggregation of membrane proteins forming microdomains which may stabilize the exosomal membrane domains [22] . Although we did not find ubiquitination motifs among the different M.tb exosome proteins, we could not determine from our analysis whether these proteins are aggregating within the phagosome and subsequently trafficked through the endocytic network into MVBs. In addition to these known pathways, there is some evidence to indicate that there may be ESCRT-independent transport mechanisms [23] but whether some or all of the mycobacterial proteins use these alternative targeting pathways must wait until the process is better defined. This is further complicated by the lack of studies addressing the mechanism of phagosomal protein trafficking to MVBs which may differ from how plasma membrane or endosomal proteins are targeted to MVBs and exosomes. Independent of how mycobacterial proteins and other components are targeted to MVBs/exosomes, it is clear that this occurs during the course of an M.tb infection both in vitro and in vivo [6] . At the time of this publication, no other study has defined the microbial components present in exosomes following infection with an intracellular pathogen. Some studies with HIV-infected macrophages and DCs suggest that HIV may bud from cells through exosomes or exosome-like vesicles [24, 25] . Other studies have shown that the HIV Gag protein, when expressed in cells, shows preferential targeting to MVBs and release in exosomes [26] . Studies by Raposo and colleagues have shown that prion protein in both its normal and its scrappie conformation are trafficked to MVBs and released in exosomes [27] . Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders and the infectious forms involve transmission of the prion protein in its scrappie conformation to a susceptible host. The possibility that exosomes may promote the transfer of prion protein is an intriguing one.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 115, "end": 118, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 119, "end": 122, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 854, "end": 858, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1233, "end": 1237, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1382, "end": 1386, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1778, "end": 1782, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2330, "end": 2333, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2622, "end": 2626, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2627, "end": 2630, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2770, "end": 2774, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2937, "end": 2941, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Previous studies have shown that mycobacterial proteins, glycolipids, lipoproteins, etc., can affect the host immune system and can function to either promote an effective immune response or potentially inhibit aspects of this response [28, 29] . To what degree exosomes promote or inhibit immunity will likely depend on what mycobacterial components are present on the exosomes at any given time. The proteomic analysis of exosomes released from infected macrophages as described in this study is the first venture into dissecting their protein composition. Future studies will be needed to define how exosome composition may change over time particularly during the course of an in vivo infection and how this correlates with bacterial burden and the stage of infection. The eventual goal is to better understand exosome's role during the course of an M.tb infection. Nevertheless, our previous studies demonstrate that exosomes isolated from M. bovis BCG-infected J774 cells could activate both na\u00efve CD41 and CD81 T cells, suggesting that under some conditions exosomes from infected macrophages can promote an acquired immune response. This also suggests that exosomes with the right subset of M.tb components may function as a viable vaccine candidate and the presence of highly antigenic M.tb proteins on the isolated exosomes supports this possibility. Members of the 85 complex which are proteins found in exosomes were originally described as a prominent TB antigens in animal models and within infected humans [30, 31] . Subsequent subunit vaccine studies in nonhuman primates showed that this antigen along with another well-known antigen ESAT-6 provides protection against M.tb infection [32] .

There are approximately 205 M.tb proteins in the culture supernatant [15] so our findings that 29 of these including ESAT-6 and the 85 complex are trafficked to MVBs and exosomes suggest an efficient transport mechanism. However, why these specific M.tb proteins are targeted is not known. Another interesting observation was that the majority of these exosomal proteins (25 of the 29) were also present in exosomes from M.tbinfected macrophages. This indicates that these proteins are targeted to MVBs and exosomes independent of whether they traffic through the phagosome or through endocytic pathway. It is important to note that the M.tb is washed prior to the macrophage infection and there is no culture supernatant added to the cells at the time of infection. The ''feeding'' of proteins to DC, B cells or macrophages to produce exosomes containing the added proteins has been performed in the context of tumor antigens [1, 33] as well as microbial antigens from T. gondii [34] , diphtheria toxin from Streptococcus pneumoniae [35] and spike S protein from the SARS-associated coronavirus [36] , suggesting that this may be a mechanism to ''engineer'' exosomes to contain specific proteins.

However, which of these 25 shared M.tb proteins are the major contributors to the T-cell response is presently unknown. Nevertheless, the exosomes derived from CFP-treated macrophages have distinct advantages over those generated from M.tb-infected macrophages with the major advantage stemming from the removal of a BSL3 pathogen infection from the exosome-generation process. Moreover, like the exosomes from M.tb-infected macrophages, CFP-exosomes did not require adjuvant for activation of na\u00efve T cell in vivo and could promote DC activation and maturation in vitro. In contrast, CFP alone, although capable of inducing T-cell activation when injected into mice, could only do so in the presence of adjuvant [37] .
