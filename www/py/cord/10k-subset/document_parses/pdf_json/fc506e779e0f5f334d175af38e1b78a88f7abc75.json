After prolonged, intense exercise the number of lymphocytes in the blood is reduced, and the function of natural killer cells is suppressed; furthermore, secretory immunity is impaired. During this time of immunodepression, often referred to as 'the open window' , the host may be more susceptible to micro-organisms bypassing the first line of defence. This is of interest to top athletes who perform frequent severe exercise. Clinical observations regarding an increased risk of infections in top athletes are compatible with this model. However, in those performing regular moderate exercise the immune system will often be temporarily enhanced and this will protect these individuals from infections.",

The subpopulation composition of T cells is altered, with the CD4+/CD8+ ratio decreasing because the number of CD8+ T cells increases more than the number of CD4+ cells, After intense exercise, the lymphocyte level decreases below pre-exercise values, and the duration of this suppression depends on the intensity and duration of exercise,l3]",

This assay allows the identification of the individual immunoglobulin-secreting cells of blood. Stimulation of cells, in vitro, with pokeweed mitogen (PWM), interleukin (IL)-2 or Epstein-Barr virus (EBY) resulted in significantly decreased numbers of IgG-, IgA-and IgM-secreting blood cells both during and 2 hours after exercise, with recovery after 1 day.144] Purified B cells produce plaques only after stimulation with EBV and in these cultures no exercise-induced suppression was found. It was found that the suppressed immunoglobulin-production of blood mononuclear cells isolated from the blood, post-exercise, was partly restored by addition of indomethacin to the asssay and by removal of the monocytes. These results indicate that the immunoglobulin-producing cells are not directly influenced by exercise, but by substances e.g. prostaglandins produced by the monocytes.",

We hypothesise that high-intensity eccentric exercise causes a more pronounced increase in the muscle and plasma levels of cytokines involved in acute inflammatory responses (IL-I, TNF and IL-6) during and after exercise than does concentric exercise, because of the more pronounced damage to the muscle. We suggest that the source of the cells responsible for an increased synthesis of cytokines may be macro phages, endothelial cells and fibroblasts in the muscle. Concerning BMNC, we hypothesise that recruitment during physical activity may be due to the same mechanisms (e.g. increases in stress hormones) in eccentric and concentric exercise. Moreover, in eccentric exercise a part of the increased postexercise level of neutrophils and monocytes may reflect inflammation in the muscle. An increased level of cytokines, especially IL-I, in the inflammatory response may play a role in the recruitment and activation of NK cells. Further investigation is necessary to elucidate this.",

However, the exercise-induced increase in cells expressing the CDl6 marker (NK cells) was not significantly altered compared with the group receiving placebo. In another study, healthy young men were given epidural analgesia which blocked the afferent nerve impulses and inhibited increases in p-endorphins and ACTH during exercise. In this way, the exercise-induced increase in NK cell function, the percentage of NK cells and the NK cell concentration were significantly enlarged. [57] Therefore, blocking the ~-endorphin receptor and inhibiting the increase in levels of ~-endorphin during exercise exerts differential effects on the immune system (inhibition and augmentation of the exercise-induced rise in NK cell activity, respectively). Only a minor increase in cortisol levels has been described in short term, time-limited exercise stress, [3] and it is unlikely that such modest increments alone can account for the magnitude of exercise-induced immunomodulation.

For nonathletes/athletes, the relative risk was 2.53 for cancers of the reproductive system and 1.83 for breast cancer. [70] The latter finding was confirmed in a recent study.l71] The association between physical job activity and colon cancer was examined in a 19-year follow-up study of 1.1 million Swedish men.l72] The relative risk of colon cancer in men employed in sedentary occupations was estimated at 1.3.

During this time of immunodepression, often referred to as 'the open window', the host may be more susceptible to micro-organisms bypassing the first line of defence.
