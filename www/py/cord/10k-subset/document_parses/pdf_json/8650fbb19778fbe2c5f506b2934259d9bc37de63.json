The GM is non-parametric and does not depend on knowing or estimating the PS, but the method is greatly improved when an estimated PS is incorporated [28] . PS is the conditional probability of having HFOV treatment given the confounding factors. We first estimated the PS by fitting the logistic regression model to both non-HFOV and HFOV groups to estimate their probability of receiving the HFOV at the time of PARDS diagnosis. We applied fivefold cross validation on the PS model to ensure that the model did not overfit. We assessed the performance of the PS model by looking at the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Subsequently, GM optimized the covariate balance between the matched pairs from HFOV and non-HFOV groups. All the aforementioned confounding factors were included as covariates, and the PS is included as an additional covariate in the GM model. GM selects matched pairs using a generalized Mahalanobis distance metric, which includes a vector of weights that indicates the relative importance for each individual covariate. The higher the weight, the more important the covariate as a confounding factor. Expert opinion was used to designate which of covariates were high-or low-priority variables to balance. For instance, the most important confounder was anticipated to be OI, which was a key indicator when inferring mortality [31, 34] . In GM, the weights could be initialized with prior knowledge, and it was optimized by an automated search algorithm, so that the weights would give the best covariate balance in the matched pairs. Thus, GM automates the process of maximizing balance on observed covariates in the matched subjects. We performed GM with replacement and checked the covariate balance through the standardized difference after matching. The association between HFOV and 28-day mortality was analysed using McNemar's test, while the secondary outcomes were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results of the GM were reported using odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical significance was inferred when p value < 0.05.

PS matching was performed with one-to-one matching using a PS with calliper 0.01 across HFOV and non-HFOV groups. Balance was assessed using standardized difference and p values. An extended analysis using daily PS matching (i.e. patients were matched on a daily basis across the two groups) was done (Additional file 1: SE2). For IPTW approach, the HFOV group was weighted by 1/PS, and the non-HFOV group was weighted by 1/(1-PS), creating a pseudo-population in which the distributions of the confounding factors among the HFOV and non-HFOV groups are balanced, i.e. making the control and the treatment groups interchangeable [42] . Details for applying IPTW can be found in Additional file 1: SE3. Balance of the weighted cohort was assessed using standardized difference and p values. Analyses from the PS matching and IPTW model was reported using OR and corresponding 95% CI. MSM was additionally performed to incorporate the effect of the time-dependent HFOV exposure during the first 7 days of ICU stay and thus obtained stabilized weights [43, 44] . The MSM was constructed by fitting the CPH model with the stabilized weighted cohort to estimate the association between HFOV use and outcome. Validity of the proportional hazard assumption was checked using statistical R package 'survival' with function 'cox.zph' [45] . Analyses from MSM CPH model was reported using hazard ratio (HR) and corresponding 95% CI for the HFOV treatment and all covariates. In theory, MSM has the advantage of accounting for time-dependent treatment effects and timedependent confounding factors, and is more likely to produce an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect; it was not used as the primary analysis because the model is complex and requires larger data volume to fit in [46, 47] . More details of the MSM approaches are included in Additional file 1: SE4.

Of note, these studies included a limited number of patients and lacked adjustment for relevant covariates (e.g. OI).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1548, "end": 1552, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1655, "end": 1659, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1903, "end": 1907, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The large retrospective study derived from the Virtual PICU System (VPS) database (n = 9177) and the post hoc analysis of the Randomized Evaluation of Sedation Titration for Respiratory Failure (RESTORE) study (n = 1064), evaluated the use of early (day 1 of intubation) vs. late HFOV using PS matching in children with acute respiratory failure [20, 21] . In comparison to these studies which utilize the PS matching method, our study applies the more robust GM method which achieves covariate balance by direct multivariate matching using an automated search algorithm [29] . Both the VPS and RE-STORE re-analysis studies demonstrated increased mortality, duration of MV and PICU stay in the HFOV group. Early use of HFOV compared to late, was also shown to be associated with increased mortality [20] . However, these studies included undifferentiated acute respiratory failure which may consist of patients with less severe hypoxemia compared with PARDS and lack any form of adjustment or matching for granular oxygenation data [55] . It is possible that the results found in these prior studies were due to the inclusion of patients Fig. 1 Odds ratio and 95% CI for subgroup analysis. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI are represented as black dots and horizontal bars respectively. The subgroup analysis was performed 10 times, while each time exclude one centre from the 10 centres in this study. We observed that the ORs from the 10 experiments were all greater than 1, indicating the 10 centres had consistent harmful outcome of using HFOV in terms of 28-day mortality. The 95% confidence interval of the ORs also support our finding that HFOV was harmful. The p values in 9 out of 10 experiments were less than 0.05. By comparing the ORs and 95% CI from the subgroups, we found there was significant association of HFOV treatment with 28-day mortality in PARDS with likely less severe oxygenation deficit who stood to benefit less from HFOV. This postulation is supported by adult data that showed that HFOV was dependent on baseline severity of hypoxemia with harm demonstrated among patients with mild-moderate ARDS, and the possibility of decreased mortality in patients with very severe ARDS [3, 56, 57] . Our subgroup analysis, however, showed consistent harm in the severe group of PARDS, though our analysis is limited by the small number of matched pairs (n = 74, Additional file 1: Table S3.1,  Table S3 .2).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 346, "end": 350, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 351, "end": 354, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 571, "end": 575, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 799, "end": 803, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1032, "end": 1036, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2203, "end": 2206, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2207, "end": 2210, "text": "56,", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2211, "end": 2214, "text": "57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1138, "end": 1144, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2398, "end": 2419, "text": "Table S3.1,  Table S3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The controversial effects of HFOV on clinical outcomes should also be considered in the context of HFOV-related respiratory and cardiovascular effects. HFOV improves oxygenation by maintaining a higher and more consistent MAP, thereby avoiding conventional swings in airway pressure which increases peak lung stress. The higher airway pressures recruit collapsed regions thereby increasing lung volume and reducing ventilatory strain. Therefore, the main theoretical benefit of HFOV in PARDS is in its ability to prevent volutrauma and atelectrauma which have been shown in clinical trials to worsen outcomes [58, 59] . However, studies using electrical impedance tomography show that some patients recruit unevenly, thereby exposing open regions of lungs to excessively high lung strain [60, 61] . Deleterious hemodynamic effects are also caused by high airway pressures in HFOV and may worsen right ventricular function [62] . Airway pressure-related preload reduction has been demonstrated to occur rapidly after transitioning from CMV to HFOV [63] . These beneficial and harmful effects should be monitored in future trials to better understand the impact of HFOV on clinical outcomes. This is a relatively large study evaluating HFOV use on mortality in children specifically with PARDS. Advanced statistical methods applying several rigorous matching techniques to assess the stability of results were used to compensate for the lack of randomization and standardized protocol due to the retrospective nature of the study. This study provides a good basis for performing a randomized trial on the effect of HFOV in the setting of PARDS. We estimated the association of HFOV use on mortality using the GM approach and found that HFOV may have a harmful effect. The OS-CILLATE trial (n = 548) demonstrated a relative risk of death of 1.33 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.64) whereas the OSCAR trial showed no benefit or harm [1.03 (95%CI 0.75 to 1.40)] from the use of HFOV in adults with ARDS. Our study using four statistical approaches revealed a consistent direction of harmful treatment effect on mortality outcome (OR of 1.3-2.3), which indicates significant harm in using HFOV. However, given the limitations of a retrospective study and statistical modelling, one should interpret these results with caution. A conservative conclusion would be that the results of our study suggest caution in the routine use of HFOV the general cohort of children with PARDS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 609, "end": 613, "text": "[58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 614, "end": 617, "text": "59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 788, "end": 792, "text": "[60,", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 793, "end": 796, "text": "61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 922, "end": 926, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1051, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Other limitations of this study include the use of ventilation data only up to the first 7 days of PARDS diagnosis. Thus, we were only able to adjust for the time-dependent treatment effect and confounding up to the first week in PICU. We also did not include other potentially relevant variables like the PELOD score on the day of switching to HFOV, which may have influenced outcomes. Another limitation was the lack of protocolized MV management in all 10 centres. However, we applied the stratified Cox model to justify that treatment assignments among the 10 centres were indifferent. A randomized trial of HFOV use in PARDS is necessary to address the question of whether the use of HFOV leads to worse clinical outcomes in PARDS and we look forward to the completion of the PROSpect trial (NCT03896763).
