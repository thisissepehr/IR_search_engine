The utilized structured tree is used to represent the nonimageable vessels beyond the 3D domain. The coupling of the two different scales (1D and 3D) employs a Dirichlet-Neumann approach. The simulations are performed under a variety of conditions such as light breathing and constant flow ventilation (which is characterized by very rapid acceleration and deceleration). All results show that the peripheral vessels significantly impact the pressure, however, the flow is relatively unaffected, reinforcing the fact that the majority of the lung impedance is due to the lower generations rather than the peripheral vessels. Furthermore, simulations of a hypothetical diseased lung (restricted flow in the superior left lobe) under mechanical ventilation show that the mean pressure at the outlets of the 3D domain is about 28% higher. This hypothetical model illustrates potential causes of volutrauma in the human lung and furthermore demonstrates how different clinical scenarios can be studied without the need to assume the unknown flow distribution into the downstream region.",

However, the mortality rates of these diseases remains high, approximately 40% \u03531\u0354. In addition, it is widely known that the use of mechanical ventilation is itself the cause of a number of further associated complications \u03532\u0354, which are collectively termed ventilator induced lung injury \u0351VILI\u0352. This is despite the more recent adoption of modern protective ventilation strategies, where lower tidal volumes are administered while retaining a positive pressure at the end of expiration, which increases lung functional residual capacity and alveolar recruitment. These protocols improve the situation considerably over conventional ventilation \u03533-5\u0354. However, there are competing ventilator strategies each with their own merits and drawbacks, for example, the level of positive end-expiratory pressure \u0351PEEP\u0352 required by the patient \u03536,7\u0354. Biologically, these aforementioned ventilator related diseases manifest themselves at the alveolar level and are characterized by inflammation of the lung parenchyma, albeit still much controversy surrounds the precise mechanisms \u03538\u0354. VILI can be characterized into separate but not mutually exclusive protocol dependent mechanisms: these are volutrauma \u0351alveolar overdistension\u0352, atelectotrauma \u0351recruitment-derecruitment\u0352, and biotrauma \u0351inflammation\u0352 \u03539\u0354. Predisposition to these conditions is brought about by heterogeneous lung mechanics when the patient is suffering from ARDS or ALI \u03539\u0354, for example, the functional capacity of a diseased lung can be reduced resulting in alveolar overdistension \u035310\u0354. Mortality is usually caused via indirect mechanisms resulting from VILI \u035311\u0354 in which a cascade of events leads to sepsis or multiple organ failure. Understanding the reason why the lungs still become damaged or inflamed during mechanical ventilation is a key question sought by the medical community.",

Of particular interest are what conditions within the lung mechanically differ under both diseased and healthy conditions. Currently, a number of limitations exist for modeling the lower airways \u0351in this paper lower airways and higher generations are used synonymously to mean peripheral vessels\u0352. First the resolution of CT imaging is restricted \u0351maximum 0.5 mm resolution\u0352, hence, smaller vessels are not visible for segmentation. Second, even if the entire lung was fully segmentable, currently, it is not computationally feasible to simulate the full lung tree. Due to these points, alternative methods for modeling the lung must be sought. Previously, there have been extensive models of nonpatient specific human lungs \u035312-14\u0354 based around literature data such as Weibel \u035315\u0354 and Horsfield et al. \u035316\u0354 .

Impedance of the lung is an extremely important phenomenon as it plays a central role in the development and distribution of lung disease. More specifically, the heterogeneity of lung disease is brought about by changes in impedance conditions within the lung. These changes further affect how flow and pressure distribute through the lung. The aforementioned impedance models assume 1D fluid mechanics throughout the entire lung. However, from previous 3D simulations it is well known that the flow in the upper portion of the lower airways is not accurately modeled with 1D equations since typical bifurcating flow phenomena, such as flow recirculation, exist. For this reason, a fully coupled 1D-3D approach must be used and is hence developed in this paper. The developed impedance is based on an asymmetric structured tree methodology as introduced and used for blood in Refs. \u035326-28\u0354. This cited work has been modified in order to represent the physiological environment in the pulmonary tree. The coupling of the 1D model to the 3D model is achieved utilizing a Dirichlet to Neumann approach introduced in Ref. \u035329\u0354 for arterial blood flow.",

The method was implemented both explicitly and implicitly into our finite element CFD code, however, little difference was observed between the methods and the explicit version was utilized due to the faster solution times. In brief, given the downstream domain pressure, p \u202b\u0621\u202c \u0351t\u0352 \u0351obtained from the impedance model\u0352, the time dependent pressure at the outflow of the 3D domain can be represented by",

All outlet extrusions were deemed suitably long such that the observed profile was parabolic and streamwise independent. Furthermore, the effect that these extensions have on the pressure is minimal. This was further verified using the traction free condition with and without the extensions and comparing the pressure at the equivalent location. Finally, the use of these pressure based boundary conditions, in particular, how the flow distributes, was verified by looking at the mean flow division ratio as a percentage of the inlet flow. The following distribution was obtained: right lobe \u035157%\u0352, left lobe \u035142%\u0352, right superior lobe \u035119%\u0352, right middle lobe \u035110%\u0352, right inferior lobe \u035128%\u0352, left superior lobe \u035124%\u0352, and left inferior lobe \u035118%\u0352. These flow divisions were deemed suitable based on reported literature values \u035316\u0354. The major advantage of this method is that no assumption needs to be made about the flow, hence, flow distribution is completely governed by the downstream region. Further validation was provided by considering the pressure drop calculated with this coupled approach, we considered the pressure drop over the whole model for the varying flowrates. This instantaneous drop was approximately 33 Pa for a flowrate of 0.5 l/s; if we consider the equivalent values reported in literature \u035336\u0354, the value shows good agreement.

Hence the pressure in such models tends to drop in a relatively uniform manner along the vessel.

The current impedance model has the advantage that no a priori assumptions need to be made about the flow since the flow in the 3D domain is governed by the peripheral vessels. This is a major advantage over previous impedance implementations. Here, we consider a light constriction of the left superior lobe, i.e., a lung of reduced functional residual capacity. This could represent clinical scenarios such as alectasis or a derecruited region of the lung. This model is only indicative and is not meant to reproduce the complex nature of true lung disease since lung disease formation tends to be heterogeneous. The constriction of the airways is modeled by increasing the impedance on the outlets. Here, the model responds by letting less flow into this lobe and naturally diverting flow to other regions of the lung. This shows that with our method we can simulate heterogeneous changes in the lung.

This is driven by the flow route, more air is diverted into the left superior lobe, where the pressure is reduced \u0351data not shown\u0352. This results in less air flowing into the left inferior lobe. The flow route is primarily driven by the curvature of the second generation of the left hand side of the lung, where the air is skewed toward the interior surface of the lung, hence flow continuity results in secondary currents, which lead to flow diverting back toward the anterior surface. This aforementioned phenomenon is primarily due to the nonuniformity of the geometry, meaning the cross-sectional area change plays an important role in the pressure and flow distribution. This particularly suggests that models based around circular cross sections fail to capture essential dynamics such as pressure variations due to cross-sectional changes. Figure 11 compares the pressure-flow relationship between ventilation and breathing. Clearly there is a change in this relationship. This is evidenced by the pressure-flow loop area increase, hence indicating that inertial effects are important \u0351pressure is leading flow\u0352. This relationship is also seen to be much more nonlinear. This is specifically true during the acceleration phases.

This is supported by previous medical observations, where it is reported that around 10% of the resistance comes from the small airways \u035339,40\u0354. From a flow physics per-spective, this does not mean the number of generation levels, rather it requires that the Reynolds number at the outlet is sufficiently low.",

            "text": "Modeling diseased lungs is essential for understanding ventilation of diseased patients and can also provide insight into how different mechanical maneuvers affect the diseased lungs. Understanding how the lungs respond under mechanical ventilation is currently an unresolved question still trying to be elucidated by the medical community \u035341\u0354. Here, a partial obstruction of the superior left lobe was investigated in order to see the effects on the rest of the lung. This simulation also demonstrated the usefulness of the coupling method, where no assumption is made a priori about the flow into the peripheral airways, i.e., the flow is realistically governed by the impedance in this downstream region. The obstruction was not meant to model the complexity of lung disease but instead see the effects of the peripheral vessels on the lung dynamics. However, it could be indicative of a downstream derecruited region. The results demonstrated for both normal breathing and mechanical ventilation that the major changes in pressure-flow dynamics tended to be localized to the vicinity of the region, where the constricted vessels are located, i.e., the other regions of the lung showed increased pressure and flow, however, the relationship between the variables is virtually unchanged. In these other regions, the mean outlet pressure was on average approximately 28% higher, which could potentially result in overdistension \u0351volutrauma\u0352 of the downstream alveoli due to elevated lobular pressure. The model here, although completely idealized, demonstrates that diseased lungs respond differently to healthy lungs. Further work is required in this area to understand heterogeneous lung disease. This model represents a step in the direction to understand the complex lung mechanics occurring during mechanical ventilation. One of the major areas, which requires understanding is the effect of different mechanical maneuvers on lung mechanics in a diseased state.",

            "text": "In literature, alternative approaches related to modeling the total tracheobronchial airways have been proposed \u035342,43\u0354. In Ref. \u035342\u0354 , a 15 generation model of the airway system was simulated by calculating the flow in a 3D Weibel triple bifurcation and then repeatedly reproducing this section in parallel, where the outflow from each section becomes the inflow for the next downstream bifurcation unit. In Ref. \u035343\u0354 , an idealized 17 generation model based on an anatomical data set was simulated under steady state conditions, however, their mesh used in the model was very course. Although these two methods provide some useful insights into flow structures in the conducting airways our approach has a number of advantages: We can model the whole conducting airway utilizing a realistic geometry for the first seven generations and then attach 1D trees as boundary conditions onto the 3D domain; the 1D domain takes into account the effects of wall movement; we are utilizing transient simulations; and we have a framework in which we have demonstrated that we can model diseased state conditions. Future work will also encompass the expiration phase, which is nontrivial from a computational perspective. The simulations will also take into account FSI effects using our vast experience in FSI and the efficient implementations in our in-house code \u035321\u0354. This is expected, given the change observed in pressure under impedance conditions to lead to different flow and stress dynamics in the tracheobronchial region. In particular significant changes are expected to be seen in the higher generations due to the reduced wall cartilage content. Currently the 1D model is attached to the outlet of the 3D model obtained from the CT data, future models will include artificial bifurcations based on morphological data to extend the 3D model a few extra generations, this is in order to limit any error associated with using a 1D model. Ultimately, we are working toward a whole lung model, hence, work is currently being undertaken to couple the model presented here to models of the alveolar region \u035344,34\u0354, therefore we will have a model of the tracheobronchial tree coupled to the acinar region. This is ex- pected to alter the results since this is a major part of the respiratory system. This is in the hope that further understanding of the lung, specifically the alveoli under healthy and diseased conditions can be ascertained. Finally, the present models have provided detailed insight into the effects of the peripheral airways on breathing mechanics and also the use of coupling for lung simulations.",
