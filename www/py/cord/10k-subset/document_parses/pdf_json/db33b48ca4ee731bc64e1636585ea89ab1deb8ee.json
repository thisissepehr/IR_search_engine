In fact, health policy-makers could manage the problem of the regional spread of an epidemic, by organizing many vaccination campaigns, or by suggesting other defensive strategies such as blocking movement of people coming from borders of regions at high-risk of infection and entering very controlled regions or with insignificant infection rate. Further, we introduce in the discrete SIR systems, two control variables which represent the effectiveness rates of vaccination and travel-blocking operation. We focus in our study to control the outbreaks of an epidemic that affects a hypothetical population belonging to a specific region. Firstly, we analyze the epidemic model when the control strategy is based on the vaccination control only, and secondly, when the travel-blocking control is added. The multi-points boundary value problems, associated to the opti-mal control problems studied here, are obtained based on a discrete version of Pontryagin's maximum principle, and resolved numerically using a progressive-regressive discrete scheme that converges following an appropriate test related to the Forward-Backward Sweep Method on optimal control.",

In 1927, Kermack and McKendrick [1] were the first researchers on mathematical epidemiology to propose the SIR model which is one of the classical epidemic models that has a compartment structure. In SIR systems, the host population is divided into three epidemiological groups: the susceptibles (S) (individuals not yet infected with the disease), the infectives (I ) (individuals who have been infected with the disease and are capable of spreading the disease to those in the susceptible category), and the removed (R) (individuals who have been infected and then removed from the disease. Those in this category are not able to be infected again or transmit the infection to others). The transmission dynamics of an infectious disease is described by modeling the population movements among those epidemiological compartments. In these types of models, individuals develop an immunity to some diseases such as chicken pox and SARS. In addition, contacts between infected and susceptible individuals can take part in the spread of the epidemic.",

Spatial heterogeneity requires a formulation of a small model for each region (city, or state, etc). One possible approach is to consider the travel of individuals between discrete geographical regions (subdomains of domain of study), assuming that the transmission does not take place during travel. For diseases that affect animals and insects (vectors), and can also be passed on to humans [4] , it is important to accurately model not only the contact/mixing between humans and the various species, but also the movement patterns of each of the species involved, including humans.",

Before the diagnosis of that disease, infected people moved from one city to another. After some infected cases were diagnosed, and the problem was recognized, it took some time until the political decision was made to ban all movements. At that time, the infected cases had already been divided among a large number of regions. The problem was exacerbated. Then, in order to control the spatial spread of the disease, it has became necessary to consider all parts that people can visit. Hence, this study showcases the significance of integration of spatial dynamics in mathematical models of the spread of infectious diseases.",

Most of the models studied, have been partly continuous because of their mathematical tractability. In Allen et al. [8] , a discrete-time, ageindependent SIR type epidemic model with n subgroups is formulated and analyzed, then applied to a measles epidemic on a university campus. In similar pattern, we devise a discrete-time SIR model that describes the propagation of a disease in a population of individuals who travel between p regions (domains). Figure 1 illustrates an example of discrete geographical domains of region of Casablanca-Settat (Morocco) where , Settat (\u03a9 8 ) and Sidi Bennour (\u03a9 9 ) [9] p = 9, that image was originally made based on information from [9] . Births and deaths are included but the population size of each domain remains constant. One reason for the upsurge of discrete epidemic models is that discrete models have advantages in describing an infectious disease since epidemic data are usually collected in discrete time units, which would make it more convenient to use discrete-time models [10] and the ease with which data can be compared to the simulated results [8] .",

The aim of this work is not to consider a special disease but to set up an optimal control problem relative to multi-regional discrete-time SIR model, applicable for any type of infectious diseases. Firstly, we represent the percentage of vaccinated susceptible populations as a control function of time in the SIR model corresponding to the targeted region aiming to control. Hence, the purpose of this optimal control (vaccination) strategy is to minimize the infected and susceptible individuals, and to maximize the total number of recovered individuals in that region by using the minimum possible cost of applying this control and simultaneously, to investigate the sensitivity of the susceptible individuals by the control (vaccination). We illustrate how the optimal control theory and the percentage of the vaccination (control) variables can be applied to minimize the susceptible and infected individuals and increase the removed ones.",

We derive the optimality system for the multi-regional SIR model with the percentage of vaccinated individuals and travel-blocking operation. Then we find an optimal control strategy for this model and solve numerically this system by using an iterative procedure.",

We assume that the recruited individuals (by birth and immigration) are constant and enter the susceptible compartment. To make the model a little more realistic, but in order to work with a constant overall population, we suppose that birth and death occur with the same rate. In addition, we suppose that individuals who are out of their domain do not give birth, and so birth occurs in the home domain at a per capita rate d j > 0. And death takes place anywhere with a per capita rate d j . After one unit time, the susceptible individuals may stay in the susceptible compartment, or get infected and move to the infectious compartment, or die. Disease transmission is assumed to occur between individuals present in a given domain \u03a9 j .

The state system with an initial guess is solved forward in time and then the adjoint system is solved backward in time because of the transversality conditions. Afterwards, we update the optimal control values using the values of state and costate variables obtained at the previous steps. Finally, we execute the previous steps till a tolerance criterion is reached. The multi-regions SIR epidemic model we suggest here, is applicable for any number of regions p.

Once a vaccination control is introduced in the system (4)-(6), particularly in the equations that describes dynamics of S \u03a9 1 , I \u03a9 1 and R \u03a9 1 functions associated to the first region, we can deduce its effect on decreasing the number of infected people in Fig. 3 , from 5730 when there was yet no vaccination strategy, to 2750 when there is the control u \u03a9 1 . One of the major benefits of that control, is to increase the number of the removed people, and this can be observed in the case (a) of Fig. 3 , where the number of the removed people becomes approximately equal to 5500, and that can obviously prove the effectiveness of the vaccination strategy in the first region with a rate that varies in Fig. 4 , from a value equal to 0.15 towards a value equal to 0.3, and which also proves that by a control taking only a nonzero value close to 0, we can reach our goal with a significant number of the removed people. We observe in Fig. 5 that the more the control severity weight A 1 is small, the control u \u03a9 1 is more important and then there is an increasing of the number of removed people in (a), because A 1 has obviously an impact on the values of the control u \u03a9 1 (see simulation (b)) from the control characterization (12) , and also these results are obtained from the fact that the most important role of the vaccination control u \u03a9 1 is to increase the number of the removed people R \u03a9 1 . Figure 6 is added here, to show the importance of another control associated to a travel-blocking operation, instead of following only a vaccination strategy. In fact, the number of infected people in \u03a9 1 is increased by hosting people coming from \u03a9 2 , and we can see the impact of the infection rate \u03b2 12 on the system (1)-(3) of \u03a9 1 in Fig. 6 , and we deduce that the more \u03b2 12 is big, the more the number of infected people in the first region becomes huge.

In contrast, the more u \u03a9 1 is bigger and far from 0, the more we can obtain satisfactory results regarding the evolution of the number of the removed people. Figure 8 presents the simulations of u \u03a9 1 and v 1\u03a9 2 , and we can see that u \u03a9 1 varies from 0.09 (<0.15 in Fig. 4 ) to 0.31 Fig. 7 Simulations of the optimal state functions S * (t), I * (t) and R * (t) associated to the multi-regions discrete system (14)-(16) with controls u \u03a91 * and v 1\u03a92 given by (24) and (25) Fig. 4) and v 1\u03a9 2 varies from 0.0275 to 0.05 which proves that with this small v 1\u03a9 2 close to 0, the decrease of the number of infected people in Fig. 7 is more important than the case where there was no travel-blocking yet. In addition, the effect of the lacking amount of the function u \u03a9 1 in Fig. 8 compared to the simulation in Fig. 4 , could be replaced by the effect of control v 1\u03a9 2 , and by introducing both controls u \u03a9 1 and v 1\u03a9 2 , we would obtain better results that prove the importance of the travel-blocking control. In general, it does not occur a very big change of the control function u \u03a9 1 from the case when there is no control term v 1\u03a9 2 yet to the case when v 1\u03a9 2 is introduced to (14)-(16) as we can see in Fig. 9 , but with changing the values of the severity weight A 1 associated to the control u \u03a9 1 in cases (a) and (b) of Fig. 10 , we can observe more the impact of v 1\u03a9 2 on u \u03a9 1 , and the lacking effect of u \u03a9 1 could be seen replaced by the effect of v 1\u03a9 2 , because for different values of A 1 , the control u \u03a9 1 becomes smaller in the presence of v 1\u03a9 2 in case (a), and bigger in case (b) when v 1\u03a9 2 is not introduced yet to (4)- (6) . Figure 11 also shows the impact of A 1 on the values of v 1\u03a9 2 , and we deduce that more A 1 is important, the more v 1\u03a9 2 is also important. In fact, by analogous conclusions from Fig. 5 , we deduce that in the case of a travel-blocking control that the more the control severity weight A 1 is big, the more the number of infected people in (a) is big, because u \u03a9 1 has obviously an impact on the values of the control v 1\u03a9 2 (see simulation Fig. 11b ) as we explained above (the more u \u03a9 1 is small the more v 1\u03a9 2 is big), and also these results are obtained from the fact that the most important role of the travel-blocking control v 1\u03a9 2 is to decrease the number of the infected people I \u03a9 1 without forgetting that the more v 1\u03a9 2 is closer to zero, the more the number infected becomes insignificant. Opposite results are obtained in Fig. 12 by changing the values of the control severity weight B 2 , and we obtain small v 1\u03a9 2 (see simulation Fig. 12b) whenever B 2 is taken small values because B 2 has obviously an impact on the values of the control v 1\u03a9 2 from the control characterization (25) .",

Numerical results, associated to this first part, showed the effectiveness of this vaccination while the targeted region was still sensitive to infection rates in its neighboring domains at high-risk. Then, we extended the first part to a second part by adding a travel-blocking control, in which we have controlled contacts between susceptible people of the controlled region (by vaccination) and the infected of domains at high-risk of infection. We showed the advantage of each case studied with a comparison between the numerical simulations they provided. We have identified optimal control strategies for several values of the controls severity weights to show the importance and the effectiveness of our approach in controlling the infection spread. Control programs that follow those strategies can effectively reduce the number of infected cases and increase the number of the removed individuals in a specific region.",
