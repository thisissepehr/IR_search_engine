Typhi) is a highly invasive bacterium that infects the human intestinal mucosa and causes ~ 11.9-20.6 million infections and ~ 130,000-223,000 deaths annually worldwide. Oral typhoid vaccine Ty21a confers a moderate level of long-lived protection (5-7 years) in the field. New and improved vaccines against enteric pathogens are needed but their development is hindered by a lack of the immunological correlates of protection especially at the site of infection. Tissue resident memory T (T RM ) cells provide immediate adaptive effector immune responsiveness at the infection site. However, the mechanism(s) by which S. Typhi induces T RM in the intestinal mucosa are unknown. Here, we focus on the induction of S. Typhi-specific CD4+T RM subsets by Ty21a in the human terminal ileum lamina propria and epithelial compartments.",

            "text": "Background CD4+ T cells are crucial for the generation of vaccine-mediated immune responses providing effective immunity against pathogens. Recent studies have demonstrated that both circulating T memory (T M ) cells and tissue resident memory T cells (T RM ) abundant in peripheral tissues are central to elicit protective immunity [1, 2] . T RM represent a non-migratory population of T M that is phenotypically different from circulating T M subsets [e.g., T central memory (T CM ) and T effector memory (T EM )] and mediate rapid effector immune responses following antigen recall [2] . Human T RM are mainly characterized phenotypically by high expression of CD69, a key marker for distinguishing between circulating and resident T M [3] . Integrin \u03b1E\u03b27 (CD103), the ligand to E-cadherin, is also used to characterize T RM but CD103 expression is mostly confined to CD8+ T RM and a minor subset of CD4+T RM [3] [4] [5] [6] . Recent studies have characterized CD4+ T RM subsets in multiple organs including lungs, liver, skin, intestines, vagina and lymphoid sites where they provide protective responses and direct the recruitment of immune cells [7] [8] [9] [10] . In the human intestine, the majority of CD4+T RM are CD69+CD103\u2212 and a minority are CD69+CD103+ [3] but little information is available concerning their role in oral immunization or enteric infections. It is unclear whether live oral attenuated typhoid vaccine, Ty21a, could elicit and generate antigen-specific CD4+T RM responses in the human terminal ileum (TI) (site of infection for S. Typhi).",

Typhi), the etiological agent of typhoid fever, is a human restricted pathogen, that infects around 21 million people globally resulting in approximately to 223,000 deaths yearly [11] [12] [13] . After actively infecting primarily the TI [14] [15] [16] , S. Typhi disseminate to the systemic organs (e.g., liver, spleen and others) leading to systemic illness [17] . To our knowledge, no information is available on the induction of CD4+T RM responses to S. Typhi in the TI mucosa following wild-type S. Typhi infection or immunization with Ty21a. Since the gastrointestinal track is a major reservoir of CD4+T RM , it is important to understand their role in protective immunity against S. Typhi and other enteric pathogens at their preferred site of natural infection. This knowledge will provide novel insights for the development of tailored mucosal vaccines to enteric pathogens. Currently, there are two licensed typhoid vaccines namely, Ty21a and the parenteral Vi polysaccharide vaccine [18, 19] and both have their limitations. Following Ty21 immunization, a modest level of long-lived protection (60-80%, 5-7 years) is obtained [20] [21] [22] while the Vi vaccine is moderately immunogenic but well tolerated [17, 23] . Therefore, effective vaccines that offer durable, long-lasting protection are urgently needed for children and adults.",

These studies demonstrated that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses (e.g., IFN\u03b3, cytotoxic T cells (CTL), proliferation) are induced following Ty21a-vaccination [22, 24, 25, 27, 31, 32] . Moreover, S. Typhi responsive CD4+ T cells are mediated mostly by T EM and RA+T EM (T EMRA ) and, to a lesser extent, by T CM [22, 32, 33] . Furthermore, CD4+T EM and T EMRA subsets responses displayed increases in S. Typhi-specific multifunctional (MF) cells post-vaccination mainly producing IFN-\u03b3 and/or TNF-\u03b1, while IL-2, MIP-1\u03b2, IL-17A and CD107a expression (a marker associated with cytotoxicity) were produced in a small proportion of MF cells [33] . Recently, we reported that oral Ty21a-immunization elicits significant TI lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) S. Typhi-specific CD8+ T M [34] , CD8+T RM [16] , and CD4+T M [35] responses with distinct effector functions. However, it is unknown whether LPMC CD4+T RM are elicited following oral Ty21a immunization.",

Briefly, LPMC and IEL were stained for live/dead discrimination (YEVID) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and then the Fc receptors were blocked using human immunoglobulin (3 \u03bcg/mL; Sigma). This was followed by surface staining. Briefly, cells were stained at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min with fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibodies directed to CD13-Pacific Orange (conjugated in-house), CD19-BV570 (HIB19, Biolegend, San Diego, CA), CD3-BV650 (OKT3, Biolegend), CD4-PE-Cy5 (RPA-T4, BD), CD8-PerCP-Cy5.5 (SK1, BD), CD45RA-biotin (HI100, BD), CD62L-APC-A780 (DREG-56, eBioscience, San Diego, CA), and CD103-FITC (Ber-ACT8, BD). After a wash, cells were stained with streptavidin (SAV)-Qdot800 (Invitrogen) at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. Cells were then fixed and permeabilized using IC fixation and permeabilization buffers (8222/8333, eBioscience). This was followed by staining with monoclonal antibodies directed to interleukin (IL)-17A-BV421 (BL168, Biolegend), interferon (IFN)-\u03b3-PE-Cy7 (B27, BD), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1-Alexa 700 (MAb11, BD), and CD69-ECD (TP1.55.3, Beckman Coulter, Danvers, MA), and IL2-BV605 (MQ1-17H12, Biolegend). After staining, cells were stored in 1% paraformaldehyde at 4 \u00b0C until data collection. Data were collected using a customized LSRII flow cytometer (BD) and then analyzed using the WinList version 7 (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME) software package. S. Typhi-specific responses were expressed as net percentage of positive cells (background after stimulation with uninfected cells were subtracted from values obtained with S. Typhi-infected targets). The FCOM function of WinList was used to determine S. Typhi-specific MF responses in TI LPMC and IEL.

Typhi-stimulation following oral Ty21a immunization. Interestingly, we noted that both CD4+T RM subsets exhibited differences in the background (unstimulated) and \u03b1-CD3/CD28 stimulation responses between Ty21avaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers. Therefore, we hypothesized that Ty21a-immunization might influence the induction of spontaneous cytokines (background responses) and the capacity of CD4+T RM to respond to stimulation. To address this hypothesis, we evaluated CD4+T RM (CD103+ and CD103\u2212) cytokines producing cells when LPMC cells were cultured overnight either alone (unstimulated) or following stimulation with \u03b1-CD3/CD28 beads. Cumulative data from unstimulated LPMC show that there were significant (p < 0.05) increase in IFN\u03b3-S (but not IFN\u03b3-MF) producing cells in both CD4+T RM subsets (Fig. 2a) . Interestingly, we observed that the baseline level of IFN\u03b3 producing cells by CD103+ CD4+T RM cells were significantly higher than those from CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM as shown by green lines (Fig. 2a) . Next, we determined spontaneous IL-17A responses and observed that CD103+ CD4+T RM exhibited significantly higher levels of IL-17A-S following Ty21a-immunization (Fig. 2b) . Furthermore, we noted that the level of IL-17A (S and MF) were significantly higher in CD103+CD4+T RM than in CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM (Fig. 2b) . Similar assessments were made for IL-2 and TNF\u03b1 for background responses (Fig. 2c, d) . Interestingly, no differences in either CD4+T RM subset were noted for IL-2 and TNF\u03b1, except for CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM that showed a decreased trend in IL-2-S ( Fig. 2c ) and an increased trend in TNF\u03b1-S (Fig. 2d ) responses following Ty21a-immunization.

Remarkably, following stimulation with Ty21a homogenates, no significant differences were noted in cytokines (IFN\u03b3, IL-17A, IL-2 and TNF\u03b1) producing CD103+ CD4+T RM between the volunteer groups (Additional file 5: Fig. S5A ).

Taken together, these data suggest that CD4+T RM subsets exhibit unique characteristics following Ty21a immunization. Next, we studied S.

Likewise, we determined multifunctional IL-17A responses and observed no significant differences in IL-17A-S or MF production following Ty21a-immunization (Fig. 5b ) except for CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM that exhibited a trend to show increased responses by IL-17A-S in Ty21a-vaccinees (Fig. 5b) .

            "text": "The intestinal mucosa is composed of a single layer of intestinal epithelial cells that is superimposed on the LP. Because LPMC CD103 +CD4+T RM expresses CD103, a ligand for E-cadherin on epithelial cells, it is reasonable to speculate that CD103+ CD4+T RM are poised to migrate and contribute to S. Typhi responses in the epithelial microenvironment. Thus, we hypothesized that oral Ty21a-immunization might influence the frequencies and baseline responses of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) CD4+T RM in the human TI epithelial compartment. To address this hypothesis, we freshly isolated IEL and phenotypically characterized CD4+, CD8+ T cells and CD4+T RM subsets in Ty21a-vaccinated (n = 17) and unvaccinated (n = 17) volunteers. Representative examples of the gating strategy for a Ty21a vaccinated and an unvaccinated individual are shown in Fig. 6a . Interestingly, we observed that the frequencies of IEL-T cells were significantly altered following oral Ty21a immunization. Specifically, the frequencies of CD3+CD8+ IEL T cells were significantly (p < 0.005) decreased while CD3+CD4+ IEL T cell frequencies were significantly (p < 0.0005) increased following Ty21aimmunization (Fig. 6b) . To confirm that there were no discrepancies in cell yields, the number of viable IEL per mg of TI tissues obtained from biopsies of Ty21avaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers were compared. No significant differences in cell yields were observed between the two groups (Additional file 6: Fig. S6 ). Similarly, almost identical cell yields were observed in LPMC between the two groups. However, significantly higher cell numbers were observed in LPMC as compared to IEL (Additional file 6: Fig. S6 ). Next, we observed that TI CD103 + and CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM were present in similar proportions in IEL as in LPMC (Fig. 6a) . Interestingly, the frequencies of IEL CD103+ CD4+T RM were significant (p < 0.05) decreased following oral Ty21a-immunization (Fig. 6C) . In contrast, IEL CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM frequencies were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in Ty21a vaccinated as compared to unvaccinated volunteers (Fig. 6c) . Thus, these data suggest that the increase in IEL CD4+T cells result mainly from increases in the CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM subset. We next measured and compared the frequency of baseline S. Typhi single (S) and multifunctional (MF) producing cytokines (IFN\u03b3, IL-17A, IL-2 and TNF\u03b1) in unstimulated IEL-CD4+T RM subsets obtained from Ty21a vaccinated (n = 17) and unvaccinated (n = 17) volunteers following an overnight incubation (Fig. 7) . Exvivo unstimulated IEL CD4+T RM obtained from Ty21a immunized volunteers exhibited significantly higher level of IFN\u03b3-S but not MF than controls (Fig. 7a) . In contrast, no significant differences in the production of spontaneous IL-17A-S or MF, TNF\u03b1-S or MF and IL-2-S from IEL CD4+T RM subsets following Ty21a-immunization ( Fig. 7b-d) . Of note, IEL CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM produced significantly (p < 0.05) less IL-2-MF in Ty21a vaccinated than in unvaccinated volunteers (Fig. 7c) . We then studied multifunctional responses of IEL CD103+ and CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM in Ty21a vaccinated (n = 10) and unvaccinated (n = 8) volunteers following stimulation with \u03b1-CD3/CD28 beads. Remarkably, while \u03b1-CD3/ CD28 stimulated equally CD4+T RM subsets from both groups (Additional file 7: Fig. S7A-D) , we observed trends to show significant increases in TNF\u03b1-S CD103+ CD4+T RM and in IFN\u03b3-S CD103\u2212CD4+T RM , as well as significant (p < 0.05) increases in TNF\u03b1-S responses by CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM in Ty21a vaccinees (Additional file 7: Fig. S7A-D) . Above we showed that LPMC S. Typhi-specific CD4+T RM were elicited by oral Ty21a immunization. Thus, we hypothesized that oral Ty21a-immunization would induce distinct S. Typhi specific IEL CD4+T RM responses. To test this hypothesis, net S. Typhi responsive IEL CD4+T RM were evaluated following stimulation with autologous S. Typhi-infected targets in Ty21a vaccinated (n = 7) and unvaccinated (n = 6) volunteers. No significant differences were observed in cytokine production (IFN\u03b3, IL-17A, IL-2 and TNF\u03b1) from IEL CD103+ CD4+T RM following Ty21a-immunization (Additional file 8: Fig. S8A ).

Thus, we hypothesized that the CD69 and CD103 expression profile of CD4+T RM subsets may differ between LP and epithelial compartments following Ty21a immunization. To address this hypothesis, we measured the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD69 and CD103 expressed on LPMC and IEL CD4+T RM subsets obtained simultaneously from Ty21a vaccinated (n = 8) and unvaccinated (n = 8) volunteers (Additional file 9: Fig. S9 ). As shown in cytograms from a representative unvaccinated volunteer, CD103 is highly expressed on both LPMC and IEL CD103+ CD4+T RM with similar intensities in IEL and LPMC (Additional file 9: Fig. S9A ). Next, we compared the level of CD103 MFI between IEL and LPMC CD4+T RM subsets obtained from either Ty21a-vaccinated (n = 8) or unvaccinated (n = 8).

            "text": "Vaccine-mediated protective immunity is generally enabled by the induction of both, antibodies and appropriate cellular immune responses, including those mediated by CD4+T cells. There is growing evidence that T RM (e.g., CD4+T RM ) cells play a crucial role in protective immunity following natural infection and their subsequent secondary exposure. However, there are no previous reports on the role of CD4+T RM following oral Ty21a-immunization in the human TI. Here, we examined the responses elicited by Ty21a-immunization on TI LPMC and IEL CD4+T RM subsets. We observed that Ty21a-immunization activated LPMC CD103+ and CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM resulting in increased spontaneous cytokines (IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 and IL-17A) production. Importantly, LPMC CD4+T RM subsets contributed significantly to S. Typhi-specific IFN\u03b3, IL-17A and IL-2 responses following stimulation with S. Typhi-infected targets. Moreover, these responses differed in magnitude and characteristics between CD103+ and CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM , suggesting a dichotomy in their contributions and possibly different roles in S. Typhi immunity. Finally, we demonstrated that Ty21a-immunization induces IEL CD4+T RM subsets in the epithelial compartment both spontaneously and following antigenspecific stimulation. Interestingly, IEL CD103\u2212 CD4+ T RM contributed significantly to S. Typhi specific IFN\u03b3, IL-17A and TNF\u03b1 as single producing cells while IEL CD103+CD4+T RM contributed to IL-2 production. Taken together, these results contribute major novel information of the effects of oral Ty21a-vaccination and the role of CD4+T RM in human TI mucosal responses.",

            "text": "The intestinal mucosa is a major site of antigenic exposure from various sources including the microbiome and enteric pathogens. Multiple specialized populations of immune cells (adaptive and innate) including CD4+T RM reside in the intestine and contribute to intestinal \"homeostasis\" and protective immunity against enteric pathogens. S. Typhi or the attenuated S. Typhi vaccine Ty21a strain can effectively invade the TI mucosa, preferred site of S. Typhi infection [45, 46] . Then, it is reasonable to hypothesize that exposure to S. Typhi elicits both innate and adaptive responses including CD4+T RM in the lamina propria and the epithelial compartments of the TI which might play a significant role in protection against S. Typhi. The complexities involved in obtaining cells from the human terminal ileum biopsies (LPMC and IEL), are likely to have contributed to the lack of information available on CD4+T RM immune responses following oral vaccination. Using this unique model of oral live attenuated Ty21a vaccine in humans, we showed that oral Ty21a-immunization resulted in the spontaneous production of cytokine cells in the LP from CD103+ (IFN\u03b3-S and IL-17A-S) and CD103\u2212 (IFN\u03b3-S and TNF\u03b1-S) CD4+T RM and in the epithelium where IFN\u03b3-S was produced spontaneously from both CD4+T RM subsets. Similar effects (e.g., increase in IFN\u03b3-S and TNF\u03b1-S in both LP and IEL) elicited by Ty21a-immunization were observed following stimulation with \u03b1-CD3/CD28 stimulation. We hypothesize that there may be multiple cell subsets within each CD4+T RM subpopulation that differ in their requirements for activation and/or their recognition of specific cognate antigens [47] [48] [49] . Future studies should focus on fully understanding the heterogeneity and contribution of the resident cells in spontaneous cytokine production following Ty21a-immunization. These cells might play a role in protection, albeit likely to be of lesser importance than those mediated by antigenspecific responses. Overall, these unique data indicate that immunization with bacterial oral vaccines may have immunomodulatory effects beyond those that are specific for the vaccine being administered leading to a generalized level of activation.",

CD4+T RM unlike CD8+T RM are less uniform in their expression of CD103 and consequently two distinct subsets are present in tissues. Here, TI CD103+ and CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM elicited immune responses were evaluated following Ty21a immunization. Our data provided the first evidence of distinct responses between these two subsets in terms of spontaneous secretion of cytokines, stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28, and S. Typhi-specific responses resulting from stimulation with S. Typhi-infected targets and Ty21a homogenate antigens. Specifically, our results showed striking differences in terms of the characteristics (IFN\u03b3 and S for CD103+; IL-2 and MF for CD103\u2212) of these responses. Of note, a recent study reported differences in IFN\u03b3 responses between lung CD103+ and CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM following stimulation with \u03b1-CD3/ CD28 [7] . Taken together, these results suggest that CD103+CD4+T RM subset (Th1 and Th17) are distinct from CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM subset (Th1) and might play a different role in the mucosa following oral vaccination and/or infection.",

Here, we showed that the IFN\u03b3 and IL-17A are primarily produced by CD4+T RM (a subset of CD4+ T EM ) in significantly higher levels in the terminal ileum mucosa following Ty21a immunization. In addition, we observed that CD103+ CD4+T RM produced cytokines as monofunctional cells whereas CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM cells produced mostly multifunctional cytokines, similar to our observations in LPMC CD4+T EM [50] . These results suggest that examination of heterogeneous CD4+ T populations may mask the 'true' impact of oral Ty21a immunization due to the 'averaging effect' inherent to the analyses of whole populations/subsets which are composed of responding and non-responding cells. Thus, it is essential to focus on the fine granularity (e.g., S. Typhispecific CD103\u2212 or CD103+ T RM subsets, S vs MF) to better characterize the responses and properly study differences between cells in various immune compartments. Here, we demonstrated that oral Ty21a immunization elicited CD4+ T RM subsets in both, the LP and epithelial compartments, involving effector mechanisms (e.g., IL-17A) that might be well suited for protection against intracellular pathogens.",

Typhi-infected targets (moderately efficient CD4+ T stimulation) and Ty21a homogenate antigens (an efficient CD4+ T stimulation) [51] to stimulate CD4+T RM subsets. Remarkably, our results indicate that following stimulation with Ty21a homogenate antigens, LPMC CD103+T RM largely produced significantly higher levels of S. Typhi-specific IFN\u03b3-MF, IL-2-MF and TNF\u03b1-MF in Ty21a vaccinated participants than those in the unvaccinated group. These results were different from those observed following stimulation with S. Typhi-infected targets (IFN\u03b3-S and IL-17A-S), which largely display S. Typhi antigens in the context of both MHC-I and II molecules. Taken together, these data suggest that LPMC CD4+T RM subsets are versatile in responding to S. Typhi antigens. Of note, we recently described that oral Ty21a-immunization elicits the induction of S. Typhi-specific CD8+T RM [16] and were able to respond following in vitro stimulation with soluble antigens and S. Typhi-infected targets, indicating that multiple effector T cell responses are likely to be concomitantly induced. Future studies focusing on the activation requirements of CD4 and CD8 populations in human tissues would be vital to better understand these phenomena to accelerate the development of mucosal vaccines targeting the induction of CMI.",

            "text": "Intestinal T cells are located diffusely throughout the epithelial compartment as intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL). The predominant population of IEL-T cells are CD8+T with a minor population of CD4+T cells. IEL are part of the first line of defense and are deemed to be an important cell subset involved in immune responses at mucosal surfaces. Thus, in this study, we hypothesized that CD103+CD4+T RM (CD103 binds to E-cadherin on IEC) located in the LP are poised to migrate to the epithelium and play a consequential role in S. Typhi immunity. We describe, for the first time, that oral Ty21a-immunization influenced the frequencies of IEL-T cells with a significant shift in the proportion of CD4+T to CD8+T cells (significantly lower CD8+ and higher CD4+T cells). Surprisingly, we observed that this increase in frequency of IEL CD4+T cells was chiefly in the IEL CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM subset but not in the CD103+CD4+T RM subset. These data suggest that there may be other receptor-ligand pair(s) (apart from CD103/E-cadherin) involved in the migration of CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM from LP to the epithelial compartment. Alternatively, CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM cells may be more likely to move freely around the epithelium since it does not depend on their interaction with the E-cadherin on epithelial cells. Regarding S. Typhi-specific cytokine production, we found that oral Ty21a-immunization elicits significant IEL CD103+ CD4+ T RM mainly producing IL-2-S. In contrast, IEL CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM exhibited significant increases in IFN\u03b3S, IL-17A-S and TNF\u03b1-S following stimulation with S. Typhi-infected targets in Ty21a-vaccinated than unvaccinated volunteers. These antigen-specific responses showed diverse characteristics in the epithelium, suggesting that migrating and/or locally differentiated CD103\u2212 CD4+T RM are likely Th1 and Th17 which might play a significant role in S. Typhi protective immunity. In contrast, CD103+ CD4+T RM producing IL-2 might be important in supporting T cells proliferation and likely supporting T regulatory cells in this compartment. Taken together, these data suggest that following oral Ty21a immunization, both CD4+T RM effector subsets are recruited from the LP and activated/ differentiated uniquely in the epithelium, contributing distinct effector responses involved in effective S. Typhi immunity. This compartmentalization of T RM responses in the TI LPMC and IEL may provide important clues for the optimal design of future vaccines.",
