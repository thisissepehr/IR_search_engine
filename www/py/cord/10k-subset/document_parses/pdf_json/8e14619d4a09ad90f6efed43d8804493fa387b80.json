The results showed that significant differences were detected in the genotype distribution of C/A-18 and intron 4 polymorphisms of SP-B gene between cases and controls. No significant differences were detected in the genotype distribution of C/T1580 or A/G9306 between the two groups. Haplotype analysis revealed that the frequency of A-del-C-A haplotype was higher in case group (0.12 to 0.05, P=0.003), whereas the frequency of C-inv-C-A haplotype was higher in control group (0.19 to 0.05, P=0.000). In addition, a significant difference was observed in the frequency of C-inv-T-A haplotype between the two groups. It was concluded that the polymorphisms of SP-B intron 4 and C/A-18 could be associated with BPD in Chinese Han infants, and the del allele of intron 4 and A allele of C/A-18 might be used as markers of susceptibility in the disease.

The condition is the most common chronic lung disease in premature infants and is characterized by disordered lung development and is associated with respiratory and neurodevelopmental morbidities [1] . Despite considerable improvements in obstetric and neonatal care of very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants, BPD remains a major complication of the prematurity resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. It appears to result from multiple factors that can injure the immature lung and interrupt normal development of alveoli and distal vessels [2] . Recently, genetic variance has emerged as a significant risk factor for BPD development. After controlling for covariates, genetic factors account for 53% to 82% of the variance in BPD [3] [4] [5] .

C/A-18 of SP-B is located on the region 5'UTR, 11 nucleotides below the TATAAA box and 18 nucleotides to the left of the transcription initiation site [29] . Because of the critical location of the polymorphism site in the promoter, it could functionally impact on the promoter. The polymorphism C/A-18 has not been extensively studied. A study concerning the association between SP-B polymorphisms and COPD in Chinese Han population demonstrated that the C/A-18 polymorphism was not a susceptibility gene in COPD, but the frequency of CC genotype was higher than that of AA genotype [30] . Another experimental study suggested that the C allele of the SP-B promoter increased transcription more effectively than A allele, and AA genotype was associated with reduced SP-B expression in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) [31] . This indicated that A allele of C/A-18 might be a risk factor for BPD. The length of SP-B intron 4 variation is relatively constant. Moreover, another in vitro experiment showed that the length of the human SP-B intron 4 gene influenced splicing of the exon 4/intron 4 junction, and a larger amount of incompletely spliced SP-B mRNA was present in cancerous tissue with an intron 4 deletion genotype [32] .
