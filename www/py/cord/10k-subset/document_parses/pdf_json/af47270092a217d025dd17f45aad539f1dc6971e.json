In this study, we investigate the capability of NDL-PCBs 101, 153, and 180, 3 of the 6 NDL-PCBs defined as indicators, to impair the immune response in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated J774A.1 and primary murine macrophages. Our results clearly demonstrate that the exposure of J774A.1 and primary macrophages to NDL-PCB 153 or 180 or all NDL-PCBs mixtures causes a significant reduction in LPS-induced cytokine/ chemokine synthesis, such as tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-6, together with monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, involved in cell recruitment. Moreover, PCBs were found to suppress LPS-stimulated NO production, and to reduce cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in J774A.1 and primary macrophages. At mechanistic level, PCBs significantly counteract the LPS-driven toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and CD14 upregulation, therefore inhibiting downstream nuclear factor-jB (NF-jB) activation in J774A.1. Furthermore, PCBs determine a significant loss of macrophage endocytic capacity, a prerequisite for efficient antigen presentation. Taken together, these data indicate that NDL-PCBs reduce macrophage responsiveness, particularly when they are combined at concentrations per se inactive, impairing the capability to orchestrate a proper immune response to an infectious stimulus, disrupting TLR4/NF-jB pathway.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "3 -(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HRP, horseradish peroxidase.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), in addition to well-known polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, belong to the group of persistent organic pollutants and are currently considered as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) (Marques-Pinto et al., 2013) . Since the endocrine and immune systems share several common intracellular signaling pathways, PCBs are also considered potential toxic agents in influencing host defense system against foreign pathogens. Actually, several epidemiological studies show that PCB exposure is associated with modification of innate and adaptive immunity, including effects on immune cells (i.e. monocytes, polymorphonuclear, and natural killer cells). Such effects could lead to increased incidence of infections, insufficient antibody response to vaccination and alterations in immune organs, lymphocyte subsets, and functions (Belles-Isles et al., 2002; Heilmann et al., 2006 Heilmann et al., , 2010 . Notably, childhood is the age of greatest sensitivity to the toxic effects of these chemicals, since PCB exposure has been associated with an increased incidence of respiratory and ear infections, influenza, and chicken pox in healthy Dutch (Weisglas-Kuperus et al., 2000 and Inuit preschoolers (Dallaire et al., 2006; Dewailly et al., 2000) . Consistently, experimental studies indicate a failing of immune defenses after long-term PCB exposure due to disease resistance or increased susceptibility to infections, such as septicemic disease caused by Flavobacterium psychrophilum in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss eggs (Ekman et al., 2004) or subcutaneous abscess by Staphylococcus aureus in mice (Imanishi et al., 1984) . Furthermore, in vitro molecular studies demonstrated that dioxin-like (DL)-PCBs, differently from non-dioxin-like (NDL)-PCBs, exert strong immune suppressive effects binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) (Ferrante et al., 2011; Kerkvliet, 2009; Levin et al., 2005a) . Indeed, the immunotoxicity exerted by NDL-PCBs has been related to signaling interference via the neural-immune axis, calcium homeostasis, or serotonergic system alteration (Duffy-Whritenour et al., 2010; Pessah et al., 2010) . Moreover, Levin et al. (2005a) showed that exposure of healthy human neutrophils and monocytes to the NDL-PCBs 138, 153, and 180, alone or in combination, resulted in reduced phagocytosis activity. In contrast, leukocyte exposure to the DL-PCB 169 or to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin did not affect phagocytosis, strengthening a different immunotoxic mechanism among DL-and NDL-PCBs (Levin et al., 2005b) . In addition, we showed that NDL-PCBs 101, 153, and 180 induce macrophage apoptosis by activating the intrinsic pathway (Ferrante et al., 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 252, "end": 280, "text": "(Marques-Pinto et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 890, "end": 917, "text": "(Belles-Isles et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 918, "end": 939, "text": "Heilmann et al., 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 940, "end": 963, "text": "Heilmann et al., , 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1207, "end": 1237, "text": "(Weisglas-Kuperus et al., 2000", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1261, "end": 1284, "text": "(Dallaire et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1285, "end": 1307, "text": "Dewailly et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1589, "end": 1609, "text": "(Ekman et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1667, "end": 1690, "text": "(Imanishi et al., 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1906, "end": 1929, "text": "(Ferrante et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1930, "end": 1946, "text": "Kerkvliet, 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1947, "end": 1967, "text": "Levin et al., 2005a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2143, "end": 2174, "text": "(Duffy-Whritenour et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2175, "end": 2195, "text": "Pessah et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2208, "end": 2228, "text": "Levin et al.

Our results showed that NDL-PCBs, especially in combinations, inhibited the LPS-induced TLR4 expression, and conceivably the activation of NF-jB. These data were strengthened by the parallel reduction of CD14 expression which is reported to be necessary not only for LPS recognition, but also for TLR4 signal transduction (Zanoni and Granucci, 2013) . Nevertheless, CD14-deficient mice are highly resistant to LPS-induced shock and monocytes derived from CD14-deficient mice are insensitive to LPS as determined by a decrease in IL-6 production, suggesting the essential role for CD14 in binding to LPS (Haziot et al., 1996) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 851, "end": 874, "text": "(Igarashi et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 875, "end": 896, "text": "Ohnishi et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1383, "end": 1410, "text": "(Zanoni and Granucci, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1664, "end": 1685, "text": "(Haziot et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Additionally, Levin et al.

In particular, the authors highlight the impairment of immune cells in identifying foreign antigens, limiting the early cytokine and chemokine production and signaling, that initiate an effective and complete immune response. Our study demonstrates that all PCBs alone and their combinations decrease endocytosis. In macrophages HRP is taken up by fluidphase endocytosis (Steinman and Cohn, 1972) , involving the uptake of macromolecules from extracellular fluid into membranebound endocytic vesicles (Silverstein et al., 1977) . Neither membrane receptors nor cell surface adsorption appear to be implicated in this process and as a result, uptake is concentration dependent.
