The subunits eIF2B\u03b1 (encoded by EIF2B1 gene), \u03b2 (EIF2B2 gene) and \u03b4 (EIF2B4 gene) form the regulatory subcomplex 43 . In this study, we assumed that the chicken genes encoding these subunits have the same interactions as in the mammalian model because eIF2 and eIF2B structures have not been fully investigated in chicken. We present the novel finding that infection with NDV could result in the inactivation of the translation initiation factors eIF2 and/or eIF2B in a chicken tissue. We demonstrated that NDV challenged Fayoumis had lower expression than NDV challenged Leghorns of a gene encoding a eIF1B subunit with regulatory (EIF2B5) activity, as well as a gene encoding a subunit of eIF2 (EIF2S3). Both of these genes could contribute to the difference in relative resistance between these lines. It is important to notice that lower expression of EIF2S3 gene was also observed in Fayoumis than Leghorns for nonchallenged chickens, which shows a difference between the genetic lines under homeostatic conditions. The activity of eIF2B appears to depend on the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 as well the phosphorylation in the eIF2B itself 50 . Other results demonstrate that the catalytic and regulatory subcomplexes in eIF2B can both bind eIF2 independently in vitro 51 ; the interaction between eIF2 and the regulatory subcomplex is increased by phosphorylation of eIF2, whereas the interaction of catalytic subcomplex and eIF2 it is not dependent on eIF2 phosphorylation. Dysregulation of eIF2B\u03b1 may be sufficient to make cells more susceptible to viral infection by neutralizing the consequences of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation 52 . Finally, reduced expression of the eIF2B\u03b5 subunit has been related to reduced protein synthesis in vitro 53 . All these results show the relation between different eIF2B subunits and the control of protein synthesis. Because inhibition of eIF2B can cause the down-regulation of global protein synthesis by reducing the cellular level of ternary complexes that are available for translation initiation 13 , the differential expression of EIF2B5 observed between the two challenged lines could be related to the higher ability of Fayoumis to reduce the replication efficiency of NDV.
