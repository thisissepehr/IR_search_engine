Arnold ENT-Department, University of Diisseldorf, Moorenstrage 5, D-4000 Diisseldorf, Federal Republic of Germany Tissue was prepared for electronmicroscopy taken from four patients suffering from malignant lymphoepithelioma of the nasopharynx and tonsil. Two types of viral inclusion bodies could be detected within many tumor cells in all specimens. A first group of viral particles measuring 75-120 nm in diameter occasionally were seen within the nucleoplasm. They have attributes in common with nucleocapsids of herpes virus as they show a dense core and a single surrounding membrane. More often empty capsids can be detected within the cytoplasm of tumor cells, where their small, more or less dense cores are encapsulated by a double membrane (Fig. la, b) . The viral particles found in this study are not yet described in human lymphoepithelioma; they are very similar to those found in tissue culture lines derived from Burkitt's lymphoma (Epstein, 1962) and from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (De The et al., 1969) . The demonstration of herpes virus like nucleocapsids in malignant lymphoepithelioma might be of great interest because many of those patients show a changing level of EB-virus antibody titer during therapy or recurrence of the disease (Lynn et al., 1977) . This fact points at the possible role of a specific viral infection although it has to be mentioned that elevated EB-virus antibody titer is also present in mononucleosis or recurrent tonsillitis (Veltri et al., 1975) .",
