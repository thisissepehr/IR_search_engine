            "text": "Under physiological conditions, a homeostatic balance exists between the formation of ROS and RNS, and their removal by endogenous antioxidant scavenging compounds [3] . Oxidative stress occurs when this balance is disrupted by excessive production of oxidative agents and/or by overcoming antioxidant defense mechanisms. ROS and RNS are major mediators of cellular injury via peroxidation of polyunsaturated lipids from biomembranes and subcellular organelles. Breakdown products of lipid peroxides, mostly reactive aldehydes, may serve as oxidative second messengers due to their prolonged half-life and ability to diffuse from their site of formation, compared to free radicals. Lipid breakdown products can also make covalent modifications on nucleic acids and proteins and dramatically alter cell integrity [4] . Among other effects, peroxidation of membrane Abstract ExoU is a potent proinflammatory toxin produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a major agent of severe lung infection and sepsis. Because inflammation is usually associated with oxidative stress, we investigated the effect of ExoU on free radical production and antioxidant defense mechanisms during the course of P. aeruginosa infection. In an experimental model of acute pneumonia, ExoU accounted for increased lipid peroxidation in mice lungs as soon as 3 h after intratracheal instillation of PA103 P. aeruginosa strain. The contribution of airway cells to the generation of a redox imbalance was assessed by in vitro tests carried out with A549 airway epithelial cells. Cultures infected with the ExoU-producing PA103 P. aeruginosa strain produced significantly increased concentrations of lipid hydroperoxides, 8-isoprostane, reactive oxygen intermediates, peroxynitrite and nitric oxide (NO), when compared to cells infected with exoU-deficient mutants. Overproduction of NO by PA103-infected cells likely resulted from overexpression of both inducible and endothelial NO synthase isoforms. PA103 infection was also associated with a significantly increased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), a major antioxidant compound. Our findings unveil lipids represents a major threat to cellular integrity, once protein oxidation can alter metabolic function, and oxidative damage to DNA can impair cell division and repair. The pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa infections involves a number of virulence factors, including ExoU, a potent cytotoxin with phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ) activity that is injected into host cytosol through the type III secretion system. Upon injection, ExoU is activated by host cell cofactors [5] [6] [7] and targeted to the plasma membranes, where it cleaves membrane phospholipids, resulting in rapid lysis of a variety of cell types [8] . ExoU PLA 2 activity also accounts for a potent stimulation of inflammatory response and increased release of free arachidonic acid, cytokines, eicosanoids and PAF from infected cells [9] [10] [11] , as well as for the activation of the NF-\u03baB transcription factor via a PAFR signaling pathway [12, 13] . The proinflammatory effect of ExoU has been extensively confirmed in experimental models of pneumosepsis in which P. aeruginosa inoculation into mice airways resulted in a rapid influx of large numbers of inflammatory cells, primarily neutrophils, into the lungs [9, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

            "text": "ExoU [14] . Therefore, it seems unlikely that alveolar epithelial injury has resulted from a direct effect of ExoU, but it is plausible to assume that the increased epithelial permeability detected in mice with pneumonia by ExoU-producing bacteria has resulted from a disequilibrium between pro-oxidant and antioxidant molecules in infected lungs. During pulmonary infections, the majority of oxidants in lungs arise from stimulated phagocytic cells that can generate toxic oxygen metabolites from assembly on cell surfaces of NADPH oxidase (also known as NOX2) [23] . Similar pathways leading to oxidant generation can occur in endothelial and alveolar epithelial cells [23] . A recent study revealed that, in later periods of infection, P. aeruginosa was able to induce NOX2 and NOX4 expression, but not NOX1 and NOX3, in mice lungs. NF-\u03baB was critical to the expression of both NOX1 and NOX3, but NOX2 and NOX4 seemed to have distinct roles in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis, with NOX4 involved in apoptosis and disruption of endothelial barrier integrity and NOX2 in inflammation and oxidative response to the bacteria [29] . Furthermore, it has been shown that, in pulmonary endothelial and phagocytic cells, activation of NOX2 depends on the PLA 2 activity of peroxiredoxin 6 [30, 31] . Since ExoU has PLA 2 activity and activates NF-\u03baB, we hypothesized whether this virulence factor would be able to interfere with the production of oxidants by airway epithelial cells. In agreement with our hypothesis, PA103-infected A549 cells produced increased amounts of lipid hydroperoxide, 8-isoprostane, ROS, NO and peroxynitrite, a strong oxidant that results from the reaction of superoxide and NO.",

However, increasing evidence demonstrates the contribution of constitutively expressed NOS isoforms to NO overproduction [32, 33] . In our study, although airway epithelial cells infected with the ExoU-producing bacteria exhibited enhanced levels of eNOS, expression of iNOS was increased in about 1000 % at as early as 1 h after infection. A similar increase in iNOS and eNOS was reported by Lange et al. [34] in a ovine model of P. aeruginosa pneumosepsis. The novelty of our study is the demonstration of the precocity of iNOS expression in cells infected with the ExoU-producing bacteria, which likely stems from the ExoU-triggered NF-\u03baB activation by the canonical pathway [13] .",

Indeed, enzymes such as SOD can be induced in lung by hyperoxia, bacterial LPS and virus, to name just a few examples [38, 39] . In the present study, infection by ExoU-producing P. aeruginosa resulted in significant increase in the activity of SOD, a group of enzymes that convert superoxide anion to H 2 O 2 . Catalase and glutathione peroxidase exert their antioxidant activity by converting H 2 O 2 to water and oxygen. In our study, the increase in SOD activity together with the decreased levels of GSH suggest that infection by ExoU-producing bacteria likely resulted in enhanced intracellular H 2 O 2 production that was at least partially detoxified by glutathione peroxidase.",
