Mouse B-1a cells are a phenotypically and functionally unique sub-population of B cells, providing immediate protection against infection by releasing natural antibodies and immunomodulatory molecules. We hypothesize that B-1a cells ameliorate sepsis-induced ALI. Methods: Sepsis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). PBS or B-1a cells were adoptively transferred into the septic mice intraperitoneally. After 20 h of CLP, lungs were harvested and assessed by PCR and ELISA for pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2) and chemokine (MIP-2) expression, by histology for injury, by TUNEL and cleaved caspase-3 for apoptosis, and by myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay for neutrophil infiltration. Results: We found that septic mice adoptively transferred with B-1a cells significantly decreased the mRNA and protein levels of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and MIP-2 in the lungs compared to PBS-treated mice. Mice treated with B-1a cells showed dramatic improvement in lung injury compared to PBS-treated mice after sepsis. We found apoptosis in the lungs was significantly inhibited in B-1a cell injected mice compared to PBS-treated mice after sepsis. B-1a cell treatment significantly down-regulated MPO levels in the lungs compared to PBS-treated mice in sepsis. The protective outcomes of B-1a cells in ALI was further confirmed by using B-1a cell deficient CD19 \u2212/\u2212 mice, which showed significant increase in the lung injury scores following sepsis as compared to WT mice.",

In the United States, there are approximately 1 million cases of sepsis annually, with a mortality rate up to 40% (Vincent et al. 2014; Martin et al. 2006; Aziz et al. 2013 ). The lungs are particularly susceptible to injury during sepsis, and more than 50% of patients with sepsis develop acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Sevransky et al. 2009; Gu et al. 2014 ). The pathophysiology of sepsis-induced ALI is less well understood. Antibiotics and supportive measures are the only treatments available for patients with sepsis and ALI, and these measures have limited impact on the high mortality rates of sepsis.",

            "text": "Immune cells recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) via their toll-like receptors (TLRs) to exaggerate \"cytokine storm\", which trigger inflammation and impair tissue function during sepsis (Aziz et al. 2013 ; Barton and Medzhitov 2003; Foster and Medzhitov 2009) . Neutrophil infiltration in lungs is a major pathophysiological hallmark of ALI. Uncontrolled migration of neutrophils into lungs leads to exaggerated production of cytokines, chemokines, myeloperoxidase (MPO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) causing unrestrained inflammation, lung dysfunction and death (Aziz et al. 2013; Grommes and Soehnlein 2011; Abraham 2003; Lee and Downey 2001; Brinkmann et al. 2004 ; Kaplan and Radic 2012; Delgado-Rizo et al. 2017) . Thus, regulating the exaggerated function of neutrophils and their uncontrolled infiltration into lungs serves as an effective therapeutic tool in ALI. The early onset of pro-inflammatory cytokine storm, often contributing to the lung injury in sepsis, can be reversed by the actions of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-10 (Cinel and Opal 2009; Kono et al. 2006) . We recently demonstrated the beneficial role of IL-10 producing B-1a cells in sepsis by controlling the systemic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and bacterial loads (Aziz et al. 2017) , while their role in ALI remained unknown. Elucidation of the novel role of B-1a cells in lungs during sepsis will not only improve our understanding of ALI pathophysiology, but also help us to develop effective therapeutics against ALI. In mouse, B cells consist of various subpopulations, which include follicular (FO), marginal zone (MZ) and B-1 B cells (Aziz et al. 2015) . The role of FO and MZ B cells collectively known as B-2 cells in the early immune response and inflammatory cytokine production during sepsis has been demonstrated previously (Kelly-Scumpia et al. 2011; Honda et al. 2016 ). B-1 cells comprising a minor portion of the total B cells in mice display unique features in terms of their phenotype, localization, development, signaling and function (Aziz et al. 2015; Martin and Kearney 2001; Kantor et al. 1992) . The surface phenotype of murine B-1 cells is B220 lo , IgM hi , IgD lo , CD23 \u2212 , CD19 hi and CD43 + (Aziz et al. 2017; Aziz et al. 2015; Kantor et al. 1992 ). B-1 cells can be further divided into B-1a and B-1b cells, depending on their surface expression of CD5 (Kantor et al. 1992; Berland and Wortis 2002) . B-1a cells are predominantly localized in the peritoneal cavity; however, a small portion of B-1a cells can also be found in the respiratory tract, intestinal tissues, lymph nodes, spleen and bone marrow (Aziz et al. 2015; Yenson and Baumgarth 2014) . B1a cells can secrete large amounts of natural IgM and IgA that are capable of recognition and clearance of invading pathogens (Aziz et al. 2015; Gr\u00f6nwall et al. 2012; Vas et al. 2012) . Natural antibodies have antigen specificity for a number of microbial epitopes such as phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) . Murine B-1a cells are known to produce ample amount of IL-10 and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which attenuate excessive inflammation during sepsis (Aziz et al. 2017; Aziz et al. 2015; Rauch et al. 2012) .",

During influenza virus infection B-1a cells migrate from serosal cavities to the lungs, where they secrete natural Abs and other immunomodulatory molecules to protect rodents against influenza virus infection (Baumgarth et al. 2000; Choi and Baumgarth 2008) . Consistently, in various animal models of ALI initiated by direct instillation of LPS, E. coli or S. pneumoniae, B-1a cells were shown to migrate from the pleural cavity to the lung parenchymal tissues, where they secrete GM-CSF and IgM to protect rodents against ALI (Weber et al. 2014) . A recent study has demonstrated that due to the loss of function of natural IgM as secreted from the B-1a cells could be the cause of poor prognostic outcomes of lung infection in aged animals (Holodick et al. 2016) . The beneficial role of B-1a cells in lungs was shown in virus and bacterial infections, as well as in young over old mice with S. pneumoniae infection, indicating that these cells play a pivotal role in lung diseases. Nonetheless, their role in sepsis-induced ALI remains unknown.",

B-1a cells spontaneously secrete germline-like, polyreactive natural antibody (IgM), which acts as a first line of defense by Fig. 4 Treatment with B-1a cells attenuates apoptosis in lungs after sepsis.

B-1a cells are known to produce several immunomodulatory molecules either spontaneously or in the presence of stimulation, which attenuate infectious and inflammatory diseases including influenza, pneumonia, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmunity, obesity and diabetes mellitus [reviewed in (Aziz et al. 2015) ]. Recently, the beneficial role of B-1a cells in sepsis has been reported (Aziz et al. 2017; Rauch et al. 2012) , and this was shown to be mediated through the control of excessive systemic inflammation and bacterial burdens. Nonetheless, the role of B-1a cells in mitigating inflammation and injuries to the remote organs especially lungs, during sepsis was not known. In the current study, we primarily focused on the role of B-1a cells in attenuating ALI during sepsis. Using a mouse model of sepsis, we previously showed that the numbers of B-1a cells in peritoneal cavity, spleen and bone-marrow were significantly decreased (Aziz et al. 2017) . Adoptive transfer of syngeneic B-1a cells into septic mice significantly attenuated systemic inflammatory and injury parameters as well as bacterial burden in the blood and peritoneal cavity (Aziz et al. Fig. 6 Deficiency of B-1a cells exaggerates lung injury during sepsis. a After 20 h of CLP induced in WT and CD19 \u2212/\u2212 mice, lung tissues were harvested and stained with H&E. The slides were observed under light microscopy at \u00d7 100 original magnification in a blinded fashion. Representative images for each group are shown. Scale bar, 100 \u03bcm. b Histological injury scores of the lungs in WT and CD19 \u2212/\u2212 mice were quantified as described in Materials and Methods. Data obtained from three independent experiments are expressed as means \u00b1 SE (n = 6 mice/ group) and compared by one-way ANOVA and SNK method ( * p < 0.05 vs. shams; # p < 0.05 vs. WT CLP mice).

A total of 5 \u00d7 10 5 sorted B-1a cells were delivered into the peritoneal cavity of CLP mice. After 20 h, lung tissue was harvested from sham, PBS-, and B-1a cell-treated mice and assessed IgM levels in total extracted proteins by ELISA. Data are expressed as means \u00b1 SE (n = 9 mice/group) and compared by one-way ANOVA and SNK method ( * p < 0.05 vs. sham mice). CLP, cecal ligation and puncture; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 2017). In the current study, we found that the adoptive transfer of murine B-1a cells into septic mice significantly attenuated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 in the lungs. We also found overall improvement of lung injury scores in B-1a cell-treated mice during sepsis. The attenuation of sepsis-induced lung injury was correlated with reduced levels of chemokine expression, neutrophil infiltration as assessed by MPO, and cellular apoptosis through the down-regulation of caspase-3 activity. We previously demonstrated B-1a cell-deficient CD19 \u2212/\u2212 mice were more susceptible to infectious inflammation, thereby causing an increased mortality rate in sepsis (Aziz et al. 2017) . Here, we also found that the CD19 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed significantly increased levels of lung injury scores as compared to WT mice after sepsis, thus suggesting the pivotal beneficial role of B-1a cells to protect mice from ALI during sepsis. The improvement of systemic inflammation and lung injury and inflammation after administration of B-1a cells in septic animals can be better reflected in their survival outcomes. In our previous study, we demonstrated significant improvement of the survival outcome in B-1a cell-treated mice over that of PBS-treated mice with sepsis (Aziz et al. 2017) . By contrast, the B-1a cell deficient CD19 \u2212/\u2212 mice had significantly reduced rate of survival as compared to the WT mice during sepsis (Aziz et al. 2017) .",

B-1a cells produce IL-10 in response to LPS stimulation (Aziz et al. 2017; Barbeiro et al. 2011) . In B-1a cells and macrophages co-cultures, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was lower and the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was higher than in macrophage monocultures (Barbeiro et al. 2011) . Interestingly, co-culture of IL-10 \u2212/\u2212 B-1a cells and WT macrophages did not reduce the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (Aziz et al. 2017) , indicating the pivotal regulatory role of B-1a cells in controlling inflammation. Beside these in vitro findings, we demonstrated the beneficial role of B-1a cells during sepsis through the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 ( Aziz et al. 2017) . Lungs contain resident alveolar macrophages which during sepsis become activated to produce excessive amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Aziz et al. 2012; Moldoveanu et al. 2009 ). However, we noticed significant decreases in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 and chemokine MIP-2 in the lungs of B-1a cell-treated mice during sepsis. Since B-1a cells are known to produce excessive amounts of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, it is therefore understandable that the B-1a cells could temper the pro-inflammatory responses of alveolar macrophages and thus protect mice from ALI during sepsis. B-1a cells can serve as antigen presenting cells, providing effective signaling to T-cells via CD80 and CD86 molecules, which are expressed on B-1a cells (Aziz et al. 2015) . Therefore, in parallel to study the crosstalk effect between B-1a cells and macrophages, it would be of interest for future studies to elucidate the novel role of B-1a cells on T cells in the lungs during sepsis.",

The patients with ARDS represent huge infiltration of neutrophils in the lung tissues which correlates with the severity of lung injury as a result of releasing ample amounts of proteolytic enzymes and pro-inflammatory mediators from the infiltrated neutrophils into the lung tissue beds (Abraham 2003; Williams and Chambers 2014) . Thus, it is suggested that the regulation of neutrophil infiltration into the lungs could be an effective therapeutic approach in septic-induced ALI. Here, in the current study, we noticed dramatic reduction of neutrophil infiltration in the lungs as measured by MPO and chemokine MIP-2 levels which ultimately led to diminished lung tissue injury in the B-1a cell-treated mice. Although the direct roles of B-1a cells on macrophages and T cells had been delineated previously, the effect of B-1a cells on neutrophils is largely unknown. Elucidation of the direct role of B-1a cells on neutrophils will provide additional insights into the pathophysiology of ALI in sepsis.",

Natural IgM secreted from B-1a cells eliminates invading pathogens and also scavenges dying cells, which in turn can attenuate inflammation and tissue injury Vas et al. 2012 ). On the other hand, mice lacking natural IgM are prone to develop autoimmune diseases because of the failure to neutralize/remove antigens and apoptotic cells to maintain homeostasis (Aziz et al. 2015; Boes et al. 2000 ). In the current study, we noticed significant reduction in the number of apoptotic cells in the lungs following B-1a cell treatment in septic mice. Although here we did not assess the phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells by professional phagocytes, we found that the septic mice treated with B-1a cells showed reduced levels of caspase-3 activity, indicating inhibition of cellular apoptosis by B-1a cell treatment. It has been demonstrated that endothelial cell pyroptosis, a form of cell death, may result in sepsis-induced ALI through the activation of caspases (Cheng et al. 2017; Aziz et al. 2014 ). Since the pyroptotic cells also undergo DNA fragmentation and, like apoptotic cells show positive TUNEL staining (Mariathasan et al. 2005) , our TUNEL assay data in lung tissues pointed to the possibility of decreased pyroptosis of lung cells following treatment of septic mice with B-1a cells. Further studies by staining the lung tissue sections with endothelial cell marker CD31 Ab, TUNEL and caspase-1 Ab will help confirm the status of endothelial cell pyroptosis in lungs during sepsis, and also demonstrate the inhibitory effect of B-1a cells for endothelial cell pyroptosis during sepsis.",

Following their translocation into lungs, B-1a cells autonomously secrete natural Abs and other immunomodulatory molecules to protect hosts against influenza virus infection (Aziz et al. 2015; Baumgarth et al. 1999; Baumgarth et al. 2000) . In line with this fact, Weber, et al. showed B-1a cells migrate from the pleural cavity to the interstitial lung tissues, where they produce ample amount of GM-CSF and natural Abs to protect the host from endotoxin or S. pneumoniae-induced ALI in mice (Weber et al. 2014 ). In the current study utilizing murine model of sepsis, B-1a cells could be enriched into the lungs as a result of their translocation from the site of origin to protect mice against lung inflammation.",

We basically chose to treat mice with B-1a cells immediately after CLP rather than post-surgery because most of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are expressed early/hyperdynamic phase in sepsis, reaching maximum levels around 10-12 h after CLP and then returns to normal levels (Aziz et al. 2013; Bosmann and Ward 2013; Rittirsch et al. 2008) . Therefore, in order to obtain optimal inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by the treatment of B-1a cells, we chose time of treatment at CLP induction instead of a later time point. We delivered the B-1a cells into the septic mice through the intraperitoneal route; however, administration of B-1a cells intravenously would help shift this laboratory strategy to bedside approaches.",

Our previous studies on B6 background of mice of Taconic and Jackson lab showed similar outcomes in their survival in CLP-induced sepsis (Giangola et al. 2013; Qiang et al. 2013) . However, since the immune responses of mice may vary among various strains and vendors (Otto et al. 2016 ), we consider this as one of our limitations in experimental designing. Further studies using control WT mice and CD19 \u2212/\u2212 mice from the same vendor will strengthen our present finding of the beneficial effect of B-1a cells on ALI during sepsis.",
