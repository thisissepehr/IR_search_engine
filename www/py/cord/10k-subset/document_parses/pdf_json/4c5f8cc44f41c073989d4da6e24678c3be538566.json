These biologics can serve as repositories for adventitious rodent pathogens that, when used in animal studies, can alter research outcomes and result in endemic outbreaks. This review includes a description of some of the biologics that have inadvertently introduced infectious agents into in vivo studies and/or resulted in endemic outbreaks. I also discuss the points of potential exposure of specific biologics to adventitious rodent pathogens as well as the importance of acquiring a complete developmental and testing history of each biologic introduced into a barrier facility. There are descriptions of specific cases of mycoplasma and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDHV), two of the most common organisms that contaminate cells and cell byproducts. The information in this article should help investigators and animal resource program personnel to perform an appropriate risk assessment of biologics before their use in in vivo studies that involve rodents.",

To reduce these risks, most institutions implement strict policies that require testing of biologics for the presence of adventitious infectious agents before their use within the barrier. These tests are typically available through commercial services that use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to detect the presence of nucleic acid sequences of viruses or mycoplasma (Bauer et al. 2004) . Unnecessary testing of samples can waste time and resources, but lack of adherence to strict barrier practices (including the prudent testing of biologics) can leave institutions vulnerable to costly expenditures for remediation of contamination. Thus it is important for investigators and those that manage laboratory animal resources to understand and assess the risks associated with the use of cell lines and biologics.",

Institutions go to great lengths to prevent rodents that may be infected with rodent pathogens from entering their animal facilities, so it is certainly appropriate to accord equal diligence to items that enter the barrier in vials and test tubes.

Viruses that can infect and replicate in the cultured cell line will be able to maintain a higher titer through several passages (generations of cell harvests and seeding) and this in turn will affect the concentration of the viral contaminant when the cells are used in vivo. Agents that have limited ability to replicate in their cohabiting cell line pose less of a threat, because the concentration of the contaminating agent remaining in the culture is dependent on the number of passages since contamination and the agents' ability to survive in the culture media. The in vitro (and in vivo) characteristics of any viral infection are likely to be highly strain dependent. Last, the response of the recipient may also influence the ability of the infectious agent to cause disease and spread. More often than not, cell lines are introduced into immunocompromised mice, providing greater opportunities for any contaminating infectious agent to incubate and multiply in the absence of adversarial host response.",

Both the zoonotic potential (Bowen et al. 1975 ) and a recently reported endemic infection (Ike et al. 2007) of LCMV underscore the importance of continued surveillance for this organism. MHV and MPV outbreaks remain the most common causes of endemic infections in laboratory colonies (Jacoby and Lindsey 1998; Schoondermark-van de Ven et al. 2006) , but the percentage of outbreaks attributable to MHV and MPV contamination of transplanted cells is unknown. Endogenous retroviruses are present in all murine cell lines, and their activation may affect some cancer and/ or virus studies (Aoki et al. 1977; Suzuki et al. 1977) . Because of their ubiquitous nature, cell lines are rarely monitored for the presence of retroviruses, except for use in commercial production of biologics (see Shepherd et al. 2003 for further information).",

However, unless a detailed and complete history of the cell line is available from the progenitor and subsequent handlers, there may have been opportunities for exposure that would put the cell line at risk for contamination. Potential points for rodent pathogen exposure can come early in a cell line's development. For example, primary mouse fibroblast cells and some specifically selected cell lines produce undefined factors that are conducive to cell growth and are often necessary to maintain the viability of primary cultures (Lazaro et al. 1998; Orlik and Altaner 1988) . Once the primary cells become established, these \"feeder cells\" are no longer needed and their previous presence in the culture can be easily forgotten. In some cases conditioned media, in which the feeder cells have been cultured, can substitute for the cells themselves and this substrate may also carry contaminants (Bazin and Lemieux 1989) .",

Stem cells are being increasingly studied for potential application as therapeutics in almost every field of biomedical research (Taupin 2007) . Risks may increase with stem cells that are derived from rodents and/or that require the presence of rodent-derived feeder cells (stromal cells/fibroblasts) for culture maintenance (Hirashima et al. 1999) . Investigations are also under way to define the growth factors and cytokines that control stem cell growth and differentiation in vitro (Kouro et al. 2007 ). The rederivation of these rodent-derived reagents offers an additional avenue for the introduction of infectious contaminants. As Nicklas and Weiss report (2000), embryonic stem cells from institutes with high health monitoring standards have a lower risk of contamination; the authors were unable to detect viral contaminants in the 46 stem cell lines they analyzed. However, it is important to remain vigilant, as Kyuwa (1997) and Okumura and colleagues (1996) demonstrated that mouse hepatitis virus replication can persist in embryonic stem cells.",

The cell lines are the product of the fusion of splenocytes, typically from antigen-stimulated rodents, and myeloma cell lines, also typically derived from mice; infection in either of these cell lines is likely to cause contamination of the resulting hybridoma cell line. The third source of contamination of hybridomas is feeder cells (mouse fibroblasts) or conditioned media added to postfusion cells to increase survival during clonal expansion (Yokoyama et al. 2006) . Last, some researchers believe that it is possible to restore high antibody production from failing hybridoma cells by growing them in the peritoneal cavity of mice and returning the cells to culture. This procedure exposes the cells to yet another mouse colony that could be infected and can therefore result in contamination. In addition, MHV and MPV acquired in the mouse can continue to infect and replicate in cells of lymphoid lineage in vitro, making hybridomas more vulnerable to persistent contamination with these organisms (Lamontagne et al. 1989; Previsani et al. 1997) .",

In some cases, cells from a tumor may not adapt well to the in vitro environment and so are implanted from the human (or other species) directly into immunocompromised mice (Morton and Houghton 2007) . Cells that are supported by the mouse's system will expand and provide a source for repeated trials to optimize conditions for in vitro growth. Cell lines that do not adapt to in vitro conditions may need to be maintained by repeated passage in the mouse (Sobel and Sadar 2005) . This repeated and often prolonged exposure to different mice increases the risk of contamination for these cells. Established tumor cell lines may also be taken out of culture and injected in rodents in order to develop metastatic variants; the cells are injected intravenously and reisolated from target organs of interest (lung, brain, liver, bone marrow) (Kitamura et al. 2000; Victor et al. 1999) . Multiple cycles of reisolation/injection may be necessary to develop the desired characteristics.

The only viral contaminant they found was lactate dehydrogenaseelevating virus (LDHV), and it was present only in cell lines that had been propagated in mice (9 of 14); none of the other 82 cell lines maintained in vitro had evidence of viral contamination. In a similar, earlier survey at a German institute, Nicklas and colleagues (1993) reported contamination of 25% of cell lines tested, with LDHV present in 17.8% of the lines tested. As suggested by these studies and a review by Blank and colleagues (2004) , the incidence of infectious rodent agents in cell lines has markedly decreased over the last 35 years. Records from our institution covering the last 3 years support this assumption, as none of the 153 cell lines that we have imported from vendors and other institutions have tested positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostics for any of the rodent viruses on the RADIL-IMPACT II Profile (RADIL; Columbia, MO) (personal communication with Marie-Louise Miller, MedImmune, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, August 2007).",

Although there are many shortcomings to interpreting data gathered this way, the exercise suggests that a significant number of institutions may not monitor for these potential sources of rodent virus contamination.

Surveys of other institutions revealed that five lots of BMM showed evidence of LDHV contamination. Although the supplier reported using a contract laboratory that implemented a sentinel health monitoring program, LDHV remained undetected in the colony that housed the mice from which the BMMproducing cells were harvested. The fact that LDHV does not readily spread to sentinels (Lindsey et al. 1991) likely explains, in part, why this organism escaped detection and why it is therefore commonly found in cells and biologics. This incident clearly revealed that although the use of sentinels in health monitoring programs may reduce the risks of viral contamination to animals and biologics, agents such as LDHV require monitoring directly in the sample (mouse or biologic) itself. This organism may adversely affect research involving infected mice; fortunately, because its transmission generally requires direct contact, LDHV contamination in a colony does not require extensive decontamination measures as compared to contamination with mouse hepatitis virus or mouse parvovirus.",

Pooling of serum from mice is a typical means of obtaining the quantities and uniformity needed for experimental purposes. Because this practice potentially widens the distribution of infectious agents, there are increased risks associated with pooled serum samples. Most serum transfer protocols are likely to involve mice in the same facility, and in these instances the risk of introducing new contaminants is negligible. However, there are some current models, such as the K/BxN serum transfer model of rheumatoid arthritis, in which serum production can be contracted off-site, stored, and imported (Kouskoff et al. 1996) . In this situation, and others that involve off-site production of biologics for in vivo use, the health status of rodents at the sponsor site may be at risk of exposure to infectious agents from the contracted site.

Antibodies that show potential as research tools and/or therapeutics are often tested further in mouse models (Harris and Adair 1997) .
