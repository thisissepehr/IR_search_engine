            "text": "A study was conducted in the USA to determine whether transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus could be transmitted from carcases of slaughtered pigs. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus was transmitted to 6-day-old piglets by dosing with homogenates of muscle and lymph node collected from 500 clinically normal pigs at the time of slaughter. All piglets in 2 separately housed litters showed clinical signs of TGE with 5 piglets dying within 10 d of oral dosing with homogenates. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus was isolated from 2 of these piglets and all piglets developed TGE antibody. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus was not isolated in tissue culture from muscle and lymph node homogenates, but was isolated from 4 (0.8%) of 500 tonsil samples collected from the same pigs. A survey of 250 serum samples provided an estimate of the prevalence of slaughtered pigs with TGE antibody of 34.8% in the sample population. The results indicate that carcases of some pigs from TGE endemic areas contain viable TGE virus, and that there would be a substantial risk of introducing TGE virus into Australia by the importation of uncooked pig meat from these areas.

However, long-term shedding of viable virus and the role of TGE virus carriers in transmitting the disease have not been fully assessed (Saif and Bohl 1986). Pre-slaughter handling stress of TGE-infected carrier pigs may lead to viraemia and virus shedding. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus has an incubation period as short as 12 to 18 h (Gillespie and Timoney 1981). Therfore, the mixing of susceptible and carrier pigs at buying stations for up to 24 h prior to slaughter could increase the likelihood of pigs incubating the disease at the time of slaughter. Forman (1990) demonstrated the presence of TGE virus in either muscle, lymph node, or bone marrow in recently infected 6-month-old pigs that had been experimentally exposed to TGE virus. The present study involved the sampling of pigs that had been exposed naturally to the virus under North American conditions. Our work shows that TGE can be transmitted to susceptible piglets by feeding carcase samples from apparently healthy pigs. The slaughtered pigs sampled in this study had no evidence of clinical disease and passed routine ante-mortem inspection.",

The herd prevalence in Egan's study was 54.7%, which was similar to the reported herd prevalence of 50.6% in East Anglia, England (Pritchard 1987) . These studies indicate that in areas where TGE virus has existed for some years, the herd prevalence rate approaches 50%. It is therefore reasonable to hypothesise that under the North These two works appeared almost simultaneously as a combined study of the nutrition of grazing ruminants. The book is a detailed and critical discussion of feeding standards for grazing ruminants. The computer model is an aid to its use, with particular emphasis on energy and protein. The book is built on the reports of NRC in USA, and ARC, INRA, and others in Europe.",
