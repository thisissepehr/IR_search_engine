Survival and long-term quality of life assessment, using the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and the EuroQol health related quality of life questionnaire (EQ5D) were assessed and compared to international data from other research groups. Results: Twenty-one patients (mean age 36.3 years) with ARDS receiving ECMO for refractory hypoxemia were studied. Eighteen (86%) patients were retrieved from external intensive care units (ICUs) by a dedicated ECMO retrieval team. Eleven (55%) had H1N1 influenza A-associated pneumonitis. Eighteen (86%) patients survived to hospital discharge. Of the 18 survivors, ten (56%) were discharged to other hospitals and 8 (44%) were discharged directly home. Sequelae and health related quality of life were evaluated for 15 of the 18 (71%) long-term survivors (assessment at median 8 months). Mean SF-36 scores were significantly lower across all domains compared to age and sex matched Australian norms. Mean SF-36 scores were lower (minimum important difference at least 5 points) than previously described ARDS survivors in the domains of general health, mental health, vitality and social function. One patient had long-term disability as a result of ICU acquired weakness. Only 26% of survivors had returned to previous work levels at the time of follow-up. Conclusions: This ARDS cohort had a high survival rate (86%) after use of ECMO support for reversible refractory hypoxemia. Long term survivors had similar physical health but decreased mental health, general health, vitality and social function compared to other ARDS survivors and an unexpectedly poor return to work.

Vitality is a lack of fatigue, or feelings of energy, and social function is the degree to which relationships are maintained with friends and family. It is unclear why our cohort would have reduced energy or inability to maintain social relationships compared to other survivors of ARDS. Importantly, only half of this young cohort had returned to work and a quarter of them had returned to previous work levels. Previous studies have reported an important functional association with survivors of ARDS that have moderate-severe depression symptoms and are less likely to have returned to work compared to those with less severe symptoms [34] . Depression has been reported in up to 50% of ICU survivors 12 months after discharge [35] . Psychiatric screening is also very important to assess depression and PTSD, which is prevalent in ICU survivors [2, 29] . However, compared with the French H1N1 cohort who received ECMO [18] , our patients who received ECMO had reduced HRQoL in both domains of vitality and social function at a median of 8 months follow-up. The study by Luyt et al. (2012) [18] found no difference between survivors of severe H1N1 who received ECMO and those who did not when assessed at 12 months after the stay in ICU. This important question needs to be further addressed in an Australian population comparing survivors of ARDS who do or do not receive ECMO at the same time point.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 179, "end": 183, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 184, "end": 187, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 253, "end": 256, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 257, "end": 260, "text": "29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1160, "end": 1164, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1252, "end": 1256, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1371, "end": 1374, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1375, "end": 1378, "text": "29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1445, "end": 1449, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1597, "end": 1615, "text": "Luyt et al.

Several factors that may have accounted for better outcomes included increased management of viral pneumonitis due to the H1N1 epidemic, improved ambulance retrieval service, the ECMO technology, including ultrasound-guided percutaneous ECMO cannulation, intensivist-driven care from retrieval to decannulation and extensive ECMO experience (10 years) at the center.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 97, "end": 101, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 102, "end": 105, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 106, "end": 109, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 204, "end": 208, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 657, "end": 661, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 367, "end": 376, "text": "(Table  4", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Relationship to previous studies"}, {"text": "Patients were retrieved with severe life-threatening refractory hypoxemia if they did not respond to conventional rescue therapies.
