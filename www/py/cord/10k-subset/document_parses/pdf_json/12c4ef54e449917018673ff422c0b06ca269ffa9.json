An increase in host nutrition could lead to more resources for hosts to expend on the immune system or for pathogens to exploit. In this paper, we report a meta-analysis of studies on host-pathogen systems across the tree of life, to examine the impact of host nutritional quality and quantity on pathogen virulence. We did not find broad support across studies for a one-way effect of nutrient availability on pathogen virulence. We thus discuss a hypothesis that there is a balance between the effect of host nutrition on the immune system and on pathogen resources, with the pivot point of the balance differing for vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Our results suggest that variation in nutrition, caused by natural or anthropogenic factors, can have diverse effects on infectious disease outcomes across species.",

In the context of infectious disease, nutrition is hypothesized to be an important factor in infection outcomes by affecting pathogen virulence, which we define broadly here as disease severity caused by an infecting organism (e.g. [7, 8] ), as well as in other aspects of host-pathogen interactions (e.g. host reproduction [9] ).

From the host's perspective, it is energetically demanding to maintain an active immune response [16, 17] . A decline in their nutritional status could leave hosts less able to suppress infection and, all else being equal, increase the harm caused by the pathogen [7, 18] . For example, in domestic canaries (Serinus canaria) fed diets supplemented with protein and vitamins, Plasmodium relictum exhibited lower parasitemia and virulence (i.e. measured as reduced weight and haematocrit loss) relative to non-supplemented hosts [7] . Alternatively, from the pathogen's perspective, changes in host nutritional quantity (food amount) and quality (specific nutrient content) might affect the availability and type of resources available for pathogen growth during infection [8, 19, 20] . In this case, the assumption is that faster-growing pathogens, or a higher pathogen fitness/load, would necessarily lead to greater virulence. This assumption, however, is not always valid, such as when hosts are tolerant to the infecting pathogen (e.g. [21] and references therein).",

For immunopathological diseases, a major contributor of damage to the host is not pathogen load, but the host's own immune system [22] . One hypothesis suggests that providing improved nutrition, and so more energy for the immune system, is thus likely to worsen, not improve, the outcome of these diseases [23] . For pathogens that infect cells of the immune system, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and its relative simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a strong immune response (to HIV, SIV or other pathogens) can result in more targets for infection rather than controlling the infection [24 -26] . Beyond the immune system, variation in nutrition can also have an impact on host behaviours. An abundance of food can decrease foraging time, and thus increase the time available for behavioural defences against pathogens, such as grooming [4, 27] . Grooming is an effective way of removing ectoparasites [27] , such as ticks, which can act as vectors for pathogens such as Rickettsia sp.",

We separately considered nutritional quantity (for non-human animals) and quality (for non-human animals, plants and humans). The quantity analysis assessed the changes in pathogen virulence driven by an increase or decrease in host food availability, whereas the quality analysis considered more specific changes to diet that are targeted at the particular host or pathogen, such as variation in vitamins (e.g. [13] ) or minerals (e.g. [14] ). To understand the mechanism by which nutrition affects pathogen virulence, we also tested for differences between systems with invertebrate or vertebrate hosts. Subsequently, we discuss the studies in more detail to consider the balance between the effects of host nutrition on the strength of the immune system and the resources available to the pathogen. The immune system is highly complex, but here we simply refer to its 'strength' or ability to act to reduce pathogen fitness, enabling us to address this broad evolutionary question across host-pathogen relationships. Overall, the meta-analysis does not reveal a consistent effect across systems. Bringing these studies together highlights how natural or anthropogenic changes in nutrient availability might cause diverse effects on virulence across species.",

Conversely, negative Hedges's g values represent cases where the pathogen virulence is greater in the lower nutrition treatment group than the higher nutrition group. We then split the data into studies according to whether they investigated nutritional quality or quantity. We used R v. 3.4.3 [34] and RSTUDIO v. 1.0.153 [35] for statistical analyses of the quality and quantity data. We constructed multi-level meta-analytic models using the package 'metafor' [36] . This multi-level model was required as there were multiple effects sizes from some studies [37] . We included two random effects on the model intercept: (1) a study-level random effect (the level of the model at which variation between studies is distributed), and (2) an observation-level random effect (the level of the model at which variance within studies is distributed) [37] . We used a restricted maximum-likelihood estimation method (REML) for estimating parameters. The overall relationship between host nutrition (quality or quantity) and pathogen virulence could be affected by a number of other variables such as: treatment type (High versus Control, Control versus Low, High versus Low), host type (broad taxonomic groupings and invertebrate versus vertebrate hosts) and pathogen type (broad taxonomic groupings). Thus, we performed univariate moderator analyses to investigate the effects of these additional variables [37] . To determine the significance of these moderator variables we carried out analysis of variance (ANOVA). Any groups with sample sizes lower than three were excluded from the moderator analyses. To test for publication bias, we tested for funnel plot asymmetry and then carried out a trim and fill analysis using the package 'metafor' [36] . We also used the packages 'ggplot2' [38] and 'cowplot' [39] for producing figures and 'dplyr' [40] for data manipulation.",

Better nutrition might boost the immune system and so reduce pathogen fitness in that environment (e.g. [18] ).

These studies support the hypothesis that an increase in host nutrition can increase host resources available for exploitation by pathogens.

Specifically, there may be differences between animal groups in energy requirements for the immune system, with the less 'complex' immune system of invertebrates [30, 41] requiring fewer resources. In our meta-analysis, we found no significant difference in the effect of dietary quantity or quality on pathogen virulence for vertebrate compared to invertebrate hosts. However, when we looked at a subset of the studies more closely, we found different patterns in vertebrate and invertebrate host organisms (table 1) . For the most part, we find that invertebrate hosts display what we would expect under a pathogen-centric mechanism-a decrease in fitness with reduced resources for the host, and therefore also the pathogen. Conversely, vertebrate hosts in these studies display what we would expect under a host-centric mechanism-a decrease in pathogen fitness with increased resources, due to enhanced host immune responses. Similarly, Cressler et al. [15] found increased host nutrition was more likely to lead to an increase in pathogen load for invertebrate, rather than vertebrate, hosts. Further studies are needed to increase the number and types of hosts and pathogens for which we have data, to fully test this hypothesis.",

For example, in SIV, where the memory CD4 \u00fe T are the targets of infection, we observed a decrease in pathogen growth with a decrease in host immunity. Our interpretation of these data may be limited by the fewer studies measuring immune responses (rather than, for example, survival or mortality) in invertebrates in the context of host nutrition. This limitation may highlight a system bias for choosing vertebrate hosts when considering immune function in the context of infection and nutrition. More work is required to study the role of host nutrition on virulence in invertebrate hosts. Moreover, careful consideration of how host nutrition is altered in specific systems is needed. For example, very specific changes to nutritional quality, such as the addition or removal of certain micronutrients (e.g. selenium [13, 53] ), can have targeted effects on pathogen virulence, which may also help to explain the lack of a directional pattern when examining host nutritional quality and pathogen virulence.",

Theoretical work has shown these changes can have far-reaching ecological [54] and epidemiological [55] consequences. For example, the constant supply of resources provided by anthropogenic activities can decrease the propensity of species to migrate and consequently affect infection dynamics within those populations [54] . In addition, resource subsidies can affect the evolution of pathogen virulence and transmission [55] . It is important for us appreciate how widespread the knock-on effects of nutrition induced changes on host -pathogen dynamics and evolution are likely to be. Understanding the long-term consequences of host nutrition on infectious disease will require moving beyond single-generation experiments (as included in this meta-analysis) towards long-term data collection from natural populations (e.g. [56] ), evolution experiments (e.g. [57] ) or theoretical approaches considering within-host and between-host evolution (e.g. [55, 58] ).",

Altering the host diet has a complex relationship with infection, either inhibiting or enhancing disease severity and pathogen proliferation across animal and plant species. We think this complexity precludes a general one-way pattern from emerging across all studies to date. Nonetheless, a greater understanding of the general mechanisms underlying links between nutrition and virulence are needed, with data on both host immunity and pathogen fitness merged. We hypothesize a balance of two factors, the strength of the host immune response and the resources available to the pathogen, shapes the link, but more studies are needed to pin this down. Such efforts will allow us to fully grasp the extent to which the nutritional changes we observe in nature will impact hostpathogen interactions, now and over time.",
