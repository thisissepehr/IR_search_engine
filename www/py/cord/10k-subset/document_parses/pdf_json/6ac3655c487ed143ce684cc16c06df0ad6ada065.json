Although this differential may help determine whether a catheter can be retained or must be removed, most indwelling catheter-related infections will respond to antimicrobial therapy alone, without catheter removal; however, some authors suggest that catheter salvage should be attempted cautiously for neutropenic cancer patients with gram-negative bacteremia [160, 161] . Certain exceptions are notable: Catheter removal is advisable for patients with bloodstream infections caused by fungi and non-tuberculous mycobacteria. For other bacteria, the decision concerning the need for catheter removal will depend on the severity of the clinical picture, the degree of immunosuppression, and the availability of an alternative vascular access site in a given patient.

The epidemiology of infection in neutropenic cancer patients undergoes periodic change and is often subject to geographic and institutional factors; however, certain trends are consistent. Approximately half of the episodes of neutropenic fever will have no clinical site or causative pathogen identified, while 20-30 % will have clinical signs of infection such as pneumonia or cellulitis but negative microbiological cultures. Only 25-30 % of episodes will have a microbiologically documented infection, with the most common sites being the bloodstream, urinary tract, respiratory tract, skin and soft tissues, and gastrointestinal tract. A small proportion, generally less than 5 %, will have non-infectious causes of fever, such as tumor or drug fever, identified [40, 178] . Classically, gram-negative bacilli such as E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and P. aeruginosa cause the earliest infections in neutropenic patients. These usually occur within the first 2-3 weeks after the initiation of chemotherapy and are due to the rapid decrease in the neutrophil count. These infections are characterized by acute febrile episodes, which can progress to overwhelming sepsis if not treated promptly [179] [180] [181] [182] [183] [184] . However, beginning in the 1980s, investigators noted a relative decrease in the number of gram-negative bacteremia and a significant increase in infections caused by gram-positive aerobic bacteria, namely staphylococci and streptococci. These observations persist in more recent studies, with gram-positive pathogens causing approximately 50 % of microbiologically documented infections, and up to 75 % if only bloodstream infections are considered. Gram-negative organisms now account for 20-25 % of infections, and another 20-25 % are polymicrobial. Isolated anaerobic bacterial infections occur very infrequently.

The use of both prophylactic and empiric antibiotic regimens targeting gram-negative bacteria diminishes recovery of gram-negative pathogens while selecting for gram-positive infections [185, 186] . One example is the emergence of streptococcal infections in populations of patients receiving fluoroquinolones [187] . The use of intravascular catheters also increases the likelihood of infection with gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococci, that colonize the skin [186] . Chemotherapeutic regimens that cause oral mucositis predispose to infection with bacteria that ordinarily colonize the oropharynx, namely alpha-hemolytic streptococci. Although the mortality associated with gram-positive infections is less than that of gram-negative infections, the morbidity is significant. For example, alpha-hemolytic streptococci have been associated with cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients receiving cytarabine [187] . Furthermore, patients who remain neutropenic for prolonged periods of time are more likely to develop infections with drug-resistant bacteria such as Enterococcus spp., Corynebacterium jeikeium, Serratia spp., Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas cepacia, and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia. These emerge as a consequence of protracted courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics [188, 189] . Because neutrophils play a major role in controlling infections due to Candida and Aspergillus, invasive fungal infections are also frequently encountered in neutropenic patients [188] [189] [190] [191] [192] [193] [194] [195] [196] [197] [198] . Autopsy series have documented invasive fungal infections in 10-40 % of patients with underlying hematological malignancies [45, 191, 199] . Besides prolonged neutropenia, extended hospital stays, previous antibiotics, corticosteroids, central venous catheters, and total parenteral nutrition are also risk factors for fungemia. In addition, many other uncommon fungi have been reported to cause infection in this patient population. Viruses commonly infect neutropenic hosts. Reactivation of HSV is by far the most common viral infection encountered. VZV, CMV, adenovirus, and the viral hepatitides have also been reported in the neutropenic patient with acute leukemia or lymphoma [200] [201] [202] [203] [204] [205] [206] . In the neutropenic patients with leukemia or lymphoma, common sites of infection include the bloodstream; the GI tract, including the mouth, bowel, and perianal region; the respiratory tract; and skin and soft tissues.

Progression to LRT disease and worse outcome was associated with diagnosis of leukemia, age over 65 years, severe neutropenia or leukopenia, and myeloablative transplant.

Chronic HEV in HSCT recipients has not been as well studied, given its low endemicity in areas of the world most likely to perform HSCTs. Some case reports in patients with acute leukemia and in those who have undergone HSCT have demonstrated prolonged shedding following chemotherapy, or viral reactivation more than three months following transplantation. Given evidence for prolonged viremia and fecal shedding, the potential exists for nosocomial transmission, and this has been demonstrated in an outbreak in France. In addition to HEV, chronic norovirus infection has emerged as a viral syndrome in patients with underlying malignancies, especially hematological malignancies, and in those who have undergone HSCT. It can cause prolonged shedding and protracted disease in this population, with patients shedding virus and remaining symptomatic for months and, in some cases, for more than a year. Treatment is supportive, and resolution of disease often requires a decrease in immunosuppression and subsequent recovery of T cells. As with hepatitis E virus, prolonged viral shedding poses a risk for norovirus transmission in healthcare settings [267] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1608, "end": 1613, "text": "[266]", "ref_id": "BIBREF265"}, {"start": 3107, "end": 3112, "text": "[267]", "ref_id": "BIBREF266"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viruses"}, {"text": "Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) can occur in cancer patients. HBV reactivation is a well-known complication in cancer patients who undergo cytotoxic chemotherapy and other immunosuppressive therapies. Rates of reactivation vary from 14 to 72 % in published literature, and variations are associated with underlying malignancy, degree of immunosuppression, and use of prophylaxis. Patients with underlying hematological malignancies are at highest risk, and patients with lymphoma may be at particular risk; however, an increasing number of cases have been described in patients with solid tumors, especially those with breast and hepatocellular carcinomas. Other risk factors include history of high serum viral load, male sex, young age, HBeAg seropositivity, use of corticosteroids, use of certain chemotherapeutic agents such as anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, and vinca alkaloids, and use of monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab and alemtuzumab. In one series, the use of rituximab was associated with 39 % of reactivation cases. Syndromes associated with reactivation vary widely and range from asymptomatic disease to liver failure and death, with mortality ranging from 5 to 52 %. Prophylactic agents such as lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, or tenofovir should be started as early as possible before initiating immunosuppressive therapy in HBsAg positive patients. Although HCV infection is more common than HBV infection in cancer patients, HCV reactivation following immunosuppressive therapy is rare. Reactivation of HCV is more common in patients with hematological malignancies but has been reported in patients with solid tumors and in those who have undergone HSCT. No reliable methods exist to predict an individual patient's risk for reactivation; however, the use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents has traditionally been associated with reactivation disease. Controversy exists as to whether the use of rituximab is a risk factor for HCV reactivation. The clinical consequences of HCV reactivation seem to be less severe than those of HBV reactivation, with only a few deaths reported. However, if severe hepatitis secondary to viral reactivation develops, mortality rates are similar to those seen with HBV. No prophylaxis is currently approved to prevent HCV reactivation in this patient population [268] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2405, "end": 2410, "text": "[268]", "ref_id": "BIBREF267"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viruses"}, {"text": "Antimicrobial resistance is now a global crisis, and patients with underlying malignancies are disproportionally impacted by this emerging trend. Drug-resistant infections cost the United States healthcare system between $16.6 and $26 billion in extra costs annually and cost society approximately $35 billion each year in lost wages and premature deaths [269] . Antibacterial drug resistance is now commonplace among cancer patients. The incidence of penicillin resistance among viridians streptococci is increasing in both adult and pediatric cancer patients [227, 229] . The majority of enterococcal isolates colonizing allogeneic HSCT patients are now vancomycin resistant, and approximately 30 % of VRE-colonized HSCT patients subsequently develop clinical infections. According to one recent study, VRE is now the leading cause of bacteremia in the first 30 days after HSCT and is associated with a fourfold increase in mortality compared to patients without enterococcal bacteremia [270] [271] [272] . In addition, daptomycin resistance is also increasing among VRE isolates [273] . Rates of MRSA are increasing among patients with breast cancer and cancers of the head and neck and, in some centers, are common causes of bacteremia in patients with febrile neutropenia [274] [275] [276] [277] [278] [279] . Gram-negative bacterial resistance is likewise increasing. In some series, over 80 % of E. coli isolates are fluoroquinolone resistant [280] . The presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenemresistant Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii, and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa among cancer patients is now routinely encountered [281] [282] [283] [284] [285] [286] [287] . As mentioned above, the increasing use of azoles for antifungal prophylaxis is thought to have played a role in the emergence of azole-resistant non-albicans Candida spp. such as C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, and C. krusei that are now commonplace in this patient population. Although less common, antiviral resistance is reported among CMV and HSV, due to the prophylactic use of acyclovir and ganciclovir, which has led to both acyclovir-and ganciclovir-resistant strains among cancer patients. To combat the increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance, clinicians must know and employ the strategies of infection prevention and control and antimicrobial stewardship for these patients who are under their care.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 355, "end": 360, "text": "[269]", "ref_id": "BIBREF268"}, {"start": 561, "end": 566, "text": "[227,", "ref_id": "BIBREF226"}, {"start": 567, "end": 571, "text": "229]", "ref_id": "BIBREF228"}, {"start": 989, "end": 994, "text": "[270]", "ref_id": "BIBREF269"}, {"start": 995, "end": 1000, "text": "[271]", "ref_id": "BIBREF270"}, {"start": 1001, "end": 1006, "text": "[272]", "ref_id": "BIBREF271"}, {"start": 1082, "end": 1087, "text": "[273]", "ref_id": "BIBREF272"}, {"start": 1277, "end": 1282, "text": "[274]", "ref_id": "BIBREF273"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1288, "text": "[275]", "ref_id": "BIBREF274"}, {"start": 1289, "end": 1294, "text": "[276]", "ref_id": "BIBREF275"}, {"start": 1295, "end": 1300, "text": "[277]", "ref_id": "BIBREF276"}, {"start": 1301, "end": 1306, "text": "[278]", "ref_id": "BIBREF277"}, {"start": 1307, "end": 1312, "text": "[279]", "ref_id": "BIBREF278"}, {"start": 1450, "end": 1455, "text": "[280]", "ref_id": "BIBREF279"}, {"start": 1683, "end": 1688, "text": "[281]", "ref_id": "BIBREF280"}, {"start": 1689, "end": 1694, "text": "[282]", "ref_id": "BIBREF281"}, {"start": 1695, "end": 1700, "text": "[283]", "ref_id": "BIBREF282"}, {"start": 1701, "end": 1706, "text": "[284]", "ref_id": "BIBREF283"}, {"start": 1707, "end": 1712, "text": "[285]", "ref_id": "BIBREF284"}, {"start": 1713, "end": 1718, "text": "[286]", "ref_id": "BIBREF285"}, {"start": 1719, "end": 1724, "text": "[287]", "ref_id": "BIBREF286"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Antimicrobial Resistance"}, {"text": "Patients with underlying malignancies are at risk for a wide array of infectious diseases that cause significant morbidity and mortality.
