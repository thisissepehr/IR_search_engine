Methods Sputum samples were analysed from subjects in an asthma exacerbation study who experienced a confirmed viral infection. Subjects were monitored for daily symptoms, medication use and peak expiratory flow rate until baseline. Sputum samples were assessed for cell counts and gene expression. Results Interferon gamma expression was significantly greater in patients with asthma exacerbations compared to non-exacerbating patients (P = 0.002). IFN-a1, IFN-b1 and IFN-c mRNA levels correlated with the peak Asthma Index (r = 0.58, P < 0.001; r = 0.57, P = 0.001; and r = 0.51, P = 0.004, respectively).
