The numbers when taken together are overwhelming in their totality, especially when you consider that the majority of these women are poor, and enclosed within patriarchal systems. Most research, including feminist research, does not take into account the problems facing this group of women. This gap between the needs of women in general, and women with disabilities, increases as one analyses the use of science and technology in their lives. In a broader sense it can be argued that in science where men dominate, women's issues find little space and where women with disabilities are concerned they are completely invisible.",

In a world where armaments and finance are advanced as the most important criteria of civilization by governments and multinational companies, society and ethical values are losing ground. This observation is proven by the fact that as the world crosses technological barriers to produce a medical science starting to depend on high-end NBICS technologies, there has been little or no public debate on its uncontrolled development. For instance, nanobiology has found itself forced to transparency in the developed world but synthetic biology is still under wraps (Wolbring, 2006 (Wolbring, , http://www.innovationwatch. com/choiceisyours/choiceisyours.2006 .htm, accessed on 10 July 2006). In the developing world there is no information, no transparency on these new technologies and they are used without consent and information to people. 1 In a world where human rights are supposed to be central to our existence, this technological development remains shrouded in a cloak of governmental and multinational corporation secrecy and based on a philosophy of money and power.",

They are not considered beautiful, even if their faces are, for their legs may be twisted or they may be using a wheelchair or hearing aids. Therefore, many are excluded from the marriage 'markets'. They are visualized as social and economic liabilities. At the same time, disabled women in general are excluded as the world searches for perfect bodies and some disabled women's wombs are targeted by the community of scientists.

As medical science and scientific research advances, nanotechnology is being applied to energy, environment, space exploration and the human body. The aim is always to improve, to enhance and move forward. Cloning of animals or food is one strategy to achieve perfection, but this is only the beginning. La Fontaine sees it as the aim to attain a'perfect' body which places it in the same context as inanimate subjects such as architecture and household goods (La Fontaine, 2003: 43) . The 'perfect' human body is always visualized as without 'defects' and disabled bodies as aberrations. Cloning was therefore accepted with enthusiasm and the exploration for perfect bodies started, but certain groups such as the disabled were excluded. The divide between the disabled and non-disabled is widened due to this technology. The technological search for perfection gives rise to the conception that perfection can be purchased, and results in the discarding of the imperfect.",

When some disabled women do marry they are always seen as having defective wombs, which will produce disabled children. Disabled women are considered incapable of bearing and rearing healthy children and thus more than 80 per cent of disabled women remain unmarried. That's where technology comes in, or as argues Wolbring, 'transhumanism' which views the human body as defective'and everyone as 'impaired' or 'defective' with the potential to be improved for enhanced physical and cognitive performance (Swanson, 2006 , http://www.enablelink.org/ include/article.php?pid \u00bc &cid \u00bc &subid \u00bc &aid \u00bc 1535, accessed on 10 July 2006).

This is more obvious in the context of women's reproductive rights, where a woman is asked to terminate her pregnancy if the foetus is not perfect. In developing countries, usually both mother and child are targeted and disabled women more so. If a test shows a mother is carrying a girl child, she is forced to abort the child even though it is illegal to do so. The girl child in many parts of the world is an unwanted commodity, even though in countries like India wherever sex ratios have declined to very low levels and women are fewer, there is increased violence in the form of kidnappings, rape, etc. Thus, there is also an existing unethical divide in the law itself which considers testing for sex selection as illegal, while testing for disabilities such as Down Syndrome as legal. Women who decide to have such children rarely have societal support and are always looked upon with pity. Medical science thus refuses difference, attempting to produce perfect, alike bodies.",

In this unrecognised form of eugenics, women are therefore forced to use NRTs (New Reproductive Technologies) for fulfilling population control targets through forced sterilizations. Here women are the objects, and it is their rights that are violated. Sterilization is a common practice in many developing countries to limit family size. In India where this Hans: Disabled Women and Technology practice exists on a large scale, new technologies are being tested. One of these tests has been the use of a synthetic malarial chemical called Quanacrine. Like many other earlier contraceptives, it has been used on women without their consent. This practice is not new, multinational companies and medical institutions have often tested drugs (especially birth control drugs) on people without their knowledge and consent. Contraceptive testing, including Norplant, Depo-Provera and Quinacrine, has been conducted on women living in poverty who attend family planning clinics.While contraceptives provide some women reproductive choices, for others it is a clear violation of human rights. Women's rights are violated when women's wombs become testing grounds for NRTs. They can become disabled through such testing and sterilization. For women who are already disabled the situation is far worse, with hysterectomies without consent carried out, especially on women with intellectual disabilities.",
