These overlapping global crises were caused by already known pathogens that can now spread around the world much faster than ever as a result of the increased population mobility, the intensified trade in goods and services, the climate change, and other factors linked to globalization [2] . High death rates from infectious diseases commonly appear in the context of poverty, poor diets, and limited infrastructure found in developing countries. Water, food, and environmental quality are key elements to prevent and control infectious diseases in a globalizing world.

Although these methods are usually inexpensive, they are time consuming, space occupying, and laborious, involving 2 to 3 days for preliminary identification and even more than 1 week for confirmation of the specific pathogenic microorganism. As an alternative, there are different molecular methods that entail near-time or real-time pathogen detection, among them immunoassays and tests for nucleic acids specific of the pathogen. The advent of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a tool for in vitro nucleic acid amplification has led to a new paradigm for the direct detection of pathogen-specific nucleic acids, giving rise to assays that are exquisitely sensitive, and relatively rapid. These methods involve multiple thermocycling steps in highprecision instruments difficult to miniaturize, requiring stringent conditions of laboratory compartmentalization and thus almost exclusively performed in centralized laboratories with high-end instrumentation [4] . An ideal test for point-of-need pathogen detection should meet the ASSURED-affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipmentfree, and delivered to those who need it-criteria outlined by the WHO [5] . With an incremental knowledge on the complex in vivo nucleic acid amplification processes, which are essential in biological systems [6] , novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods are gaining their importance for the development of analytical devices aimed to meet those ideal criteria. Isothermal amplification methods can be easily integrated into simple and low-energy consumption microsystems, which may in the future outperform PCR for pathogen detection. These methods include loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), helicase-dependent amplification (HDA), rolling circle amplification (RCA), signal-mediated amplification of RNA technology (SMART), and strand displacement amplification (SDA). Previously published reviews [6] gave a broad description of these methods and their potential applications. This review focuses in one of these emerging methodologies, HDA, giving a look into the most recent HDA-based analytical methods for the detection of pathogens.

Vincent et al. developed this method in 2004 [7] , which was subsequently patented in 2007 [8] . The initial studies employed UvrD helicase from E. coli, a well-studied helicase II that unwinds DNA in a 3' to 5' direction, using the energy from the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate to break the hydrogen bonds between complementary bases in duplex DNA [9] . In E. coli cells, this protein is involved in the repair of mismatches in DNA, working in coordination with methyl-directed mismatch repair (MutL) protein that stimulates the helicase activity. Consequently, the original HDA system requires, in addition to the helicase to unwind dsDNA, two accessory proteins: MutL and a single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) to stabilize the ssDNA preventing the re-association of the complementary strands. Once DNA is isothermally unwound and stabilized, two oligonucleotide primers hybridize to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 borders of the target sequence and a DNA polymerase extends the annealed primers by adding deoxynucleotide-triphosphates (dNTPs) to generate doublestranded amplification products (Fig. 1) , in a scheme very similar to PCR but without thermal cycling. The process is repeated, giving rise to an exponential amplification of the target dsDNA. The dNTPs mixture must be enriched with dATP, which acts as cofactor of helicase, and Mg 2+ , cofactor for both helicase and polymerase. It is very important that helicase and polymerase work in a coordinated way, preventing polymerase to be displaced by helicase, as the helicase-catalyzed reaction is the rate-limiting step, and unwound DNA strands do not re-anneal before they are copied by polymerase. It is for this reason that a pair helicase/ polymerase working together in natural systems must be employed. In the original work, the E. coli UvrD helicase/ DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment pair is used [7] to exponentially amplify DNA at 37\u00b0C, mesophilic form of HDA (mHDA). Later, a thermostable helicase Tte-UvrD from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongenesis in combination with Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA polymerase (Bst-DNA polymerase) allowed performing the amplification at higher temperatures (60-65\u00b0C), called the thermophilic form of HDA (tHDA) [10] . Unlike mHDA, the tHDA system does not require the MutL protein, thus simplifying the reaction components.

A particular feature of HDA is, however, the recommended long size of HDA primers with respect to PCR counterparts, which feeds confusion between specific amplicons and spurious products, and hence false positive results, as a consequence of their similar size [16] .

Therefore, primers built from SAMRS hybridize with the target but they do not interact with each other, avoiding primerdimer artifacts. Thermophilic enzymes (polymerase and helicase) have demonstrated their capability to work with SAMRS-structurally altered nucleotides by just adjusting Mg 2+ concentration [19] , albeit the best yield has been reported when four SAMRS components are placed at the 3\u2032-end of the primers, followed by one terminal natural nucleotide.

This causes false positive results and adversely affects the detectability and robustness of the methods based on this amplification reaction. Although a careful primer design can reduce primer-dimer formation, this process and unspecific amplification are more pronounced in HDA than in PCR [16] , and fundamentally occur because no hot-start polymerase for HDA is currently available. This is especially a problem for the detection of low copy number targets due to the long time required for amplification, and in the design of multiplex amplifications where various pairs of primers must function together. Besides the HDA modification explained before, termed blocked-primer HDA, in which DNA polymerase cannot extend the primers until they are cleaved by a thermostable RNase [17] giving rise to a quasi-hot-start amplification method, selectivity of the amplification may be modulated by careful optimization of the reaction conditions. The use of additives frequently employed in PCR, such as DMSO, betaine, and sorbitol, which reduce DNA secondary structures facilitating primer annealing, has proven to be effective in HDA amplification [22] , improving its yield and specificity. However, these additives can also greatly reduce the activity of polymerase. Therefore, it is important to test different concentrations to find the best conditions for each amplification system. Similarly, macromolecular crowding agents (polyethylene glycol, dextran, Ficoll) that mimic the conditions for amplification in natural systems, increase the speed of polymerase and affect the structure of DNA, improving yield, robustness, and specificity [23] . The optimization of reaction enzymes mixture is another important issue; for example, it has been demonstrated that, surprisingly, lowering the concentration of both ATP and dNTPs with respect to that usually employed improves the efficiency and selectivity of HDA, suppressing primer-dimer formation, and thus reduces the background amplification problems [24] . All these measures may be combined, and it is of paramount importance to experimentally determine the optimal amount of all additives and reagents for each amplification system. A different strategy that improves the sensitivity and robustness of HDA is the digestion with specific restriction endonucleases during amplification. Mimicking the natural process of mismatch repair in which helicase is involved, restriction enzymes are selected to cleave a sequence near the place where primers anneal, generating blunt ends that help recruiting and loading the helicase [23] . This improves the effective loading of the helicase and thus accelerates the HDA reaction.

Real-time HDA was first developed using a non-mutagenic non-cytotoxic fluorescent intercalator (EvaGreen) that is only fluorescent when bound to dsDNA, which ensures low background signals [29] . Besides, it shows less amplification inhibition than SYBR Green [30] . Since no temperature cycles are performed, the analytical signal is the time needed to exceed an established threshold in fluorescence intensity. This time decreases with target concentration, as expected, and with the primer concentration used. This means that the amplification speed is boosted by the amount of primers in solution. However, an enhancement in primerdimer amplification occurs, limiting the improvement in detectability [31] . In fact, detailed comparison of HDA and PCR suggests that the primer concentration to obtain the lowest limit of detection (1 f. for oligonucleotide template) is 75 nM. For PCR, higher primer concentration, above 200 nM, permitted reaching a smaller limit of detection, 100 aM. From real-time experiments, HDA has been claimed to be faster than PCR [16] but no good linearity was obtained. More recently, HDA was proven to be slightly slower than PCR [32] and doubling times (equivalent to one cycle in PCR) are reported to consistently range from 50 s [33] to 78 s [17, 32, 34] , sometimes longer than usual PCR cycles.

TaqMan MGB (minor groove binder) probes were first used in combination with two DNA polymerases with 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 exonuclease activity [36] .

The LFD contains streptavidin-coated gold nanoparticles that bind the biotinylated amplicon, and the complex flows until the detection line, where immobilized antibodies capture the fluorescein-labeled amplicons forming a visible red-colored line (Fig. 3) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 591, "end": 599, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Lateral flow devices"}, {"text": "Asymmetric amplification is more widely used and relies on a preferential amplification of the strand arisen from a biotinylated primer. The limiting primer is not labeled. A specific complementary short probe labeled with a hapten (fluorescein, digoxigenin or 2,4-dinitrophenyl) at the 3'-end to avoid extension is also added to the amplification solution. This probe hybridizes with the biotinylated strand, forming a partial duplex. This particular hybridization decreases the chance of detecting unspecific products. Then, the partial duplex enters the LFD where it binds to streptavidin-conjugated color particles and is finally captured by the appropriate antibody on the detection line (Fig. 3) . This way, duplex amplifications (two targets in a single experiment) can be carried out, one of them being the internal control of amplification [40, 41] . Commercial kits for some pathogen are currently marketed [42] . The assay for Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and -2 in genital and oral lesions was cleared by FDA in 2011 and it does not require nucleic acid extraction [43] . A simple dilution allows detection of as low as 5.5 and 34.1 copies of HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively, per reaction within 1.5 h [44] . Manual extraction amenable to resource-limited places reached 470 copies/reaction of HIV-1 DNA from dried blood spots with LFD [45] . The identification at species level of Plasmodium malaria parasite is possible by careful selection of the hybridization probes and primers [46] . Three probes with different labels were designed for a single HDA assay; one for all Plasmodium species, a second one specific for P. falciparum, and the third as an internal control. A second HDA amplification with a specific primer for P. vivax and the first and third probes allowed the detection of this species in LFD cartridges. No extraction of DNA from the protozoon is needed. The sensitivity is 5 to 10 times lower when applied to patient samples (200 parasites/\u03bcL) instead of spiked human blood. Microtiter plate version of these LFD with colorimetric enzymatic detection was also demonstrated for detecting 10 copies of the ureC gen of Helicobacter pylori [47] .

Further enzymatic labeling allows optical measurement (Fig. 4) . A variety of surface chemistries have been applied to construct the DNA chip from the simplicity of polypropylene sheets that only require aminated probes and UV-cross-linking [48] to silicon nitride wafers that are not biologically compatible and need two additional layers of polydimethylsiloxane and poly(phenylalanine-lysine), respectively [17, 33] . Those layers introduce a large number of amine groups for further DNA binding, achieving an optimal DNA coverage of 1.5\u00d710 12 molecules/cm 2 and 100% hybridization efficiency [49] .
