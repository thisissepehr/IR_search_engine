A highly significant Moran\u02bcs index value (P < 0.001) was observed, indicating a positive spatial dependency between the neighbourhoods in Campina Grande. Using the Moran mapping and LISA mapping, the autocorrelation patterns of Ae. aegypti infestation rates among neighbourhoods have revealed hotpots that should be considered a priority to preventive actions of the entomological surveillance services. Predominance of high infestation rates and clearer relationships of these between neighbourhoods were observed between the months of May and July, the period with the highest rainfall in the city.",

In 2015 and 2016, an annual average of 1,586,155 probable cases of dengue were recorded in Brazil; although a reduction to 252,054 cases was observed in 2017 [2] , which could be the result of the cross-herd immunity to Zika virus [3] . The differential diagnosis of these diseases is difficult because of the similarity of symptoms, cross-reactivity, co-circulation and overlap of infections by different arbovirus species and strains [4, 5] Arboviral transmission has multiple causes and contributory contextual factors, impacted by the influence of social, environmental and cultural determinants in the course of the natural history of disease [4] . Epidemiological studies have clearly associated the expansion of these diseases with haphazard and unplanned urban development processes, mainly caused by the lack of infrastructure and basic sanitation in areas that have been occupied without prior planning. In northeast Brazil, the population has been disproportionately affected by arboviruses, with 94% of all cases of congenital Zika syndrome being reported in this region [2, 6, 7] . Poor access to garbage collection and an intermittent water supply provide conditions for vector breeding, which in turn makes vector control more difficult in this region [3] .",

The team from Tahiti (French Polynesia) had played in the Pernambuco Arena in June 2013 and the viral phylogenetic study showed that the origin of the Brazilian strain was Asian, sharing a common ancestor circulating in French Polynesia [18] .

This quadrant is classified as high-high (AA, + +); (ii) Q2: the second quadrant (lower left) shows the areas that have low values for the variable in question surrounded by neighbouring areas that also have below-average values for the analysed variables. This quadrant is classified as low-low (BB, \u2212 \u2212); (iii) Q3: the third quadrant (lower right) shows the areas that have high values for the variable under analysis surrounded by neighbouring areas that have values below the average for the variable in question. This quadrant is classified as high-low (AB, + \u2212); and (iv) Q4: the fourth quadrant (upper left) shows areas that have low values for the variable under analysis surrounded by areas that are above the average for the variable in question. This quadrant is classified as low-high (BA, \u2212 +).",

Spatial autocorrelation more accurately points out localities with similar levels of vulnerability and risk of Ae. aegypti infestation, which may help direct the actions of the responsible health authorities. Spatial analysis has been used to show correlations between entomological indicators with the climate, disease transmission and socioeconomic conditions [26] [27] [28] ; however, the strategy had not yet been used to analyse contiguous, or adjoining, neighbourhoods in order to better define areas of similar risk and vulnerability.

A study into the occurrence of dengue fever was conducted in seven municipalities of Greater S\u00e3o Paulo in 2010-2013, showing that the months of January to May were those with the highest number of reported cases in the south-east of Brazil [32] , explained by the authors as being a product of the higher rainfall in this area during those months. Our study in Campina Grande indicates that the infestation levels were higher during the months of May to September, which correlates with the higher levels of rainfall.",

This information is helpful for adopting and directing control vector actions with less impact on material and human resources. There is a gap in the literature in relation to the quantifiable associations between vector indices and dengue transmission that could reliably be used to predict outbreaks [15] . Further studies are required to elucidate the relationship between vector abundance and dengue transmission, which could be performed in comparable areas based on spatial autocorrelation methodologies. In the same municipality, it will be possible to compare the hotspot areas with high frequency of vector mosquitoes with those with low frequency to identify characteristics of each.",

It is possible to observe a repetition in the pattern of autocorrelated areas throughout the year. Figures 6 and 7 showed the Moran scatterplots, the LISA maps, and the Moran maps for HI and BI obtained in 2017. The scatterplots demonstrate the localities that were in the +/+ quadrant (i.e. showed a positive correlation with mosquito infestation) and these are shown on the Moran maps in black. The neighbourhoods in the \u2212/\u2212 quadrant, shown in grey, are those with a negative value in the LIRAa data. The Moran maps directly represent the observations on the scatterplot onto the urban map. For example, in Fig. 6 (HI for 2017), Malvinas (in black), which comprises one of the poorest populations of the Campina Grande city, exerts a positive influence on the indicators.

The use of spatial and temporal autocorrelation revealed hotpots or neighbourhoods that should be considered a priority to preventive actions of the entomological surveillance services. The predominance of high infestation rates and greater spatial dependence was observed between the months of May and July, the period with the highest rainfall in the city. This analysis is an innovative strategy capable of providing detailed information to the relevant public health authorities, which will enable a more efficient allocation of resources, particularly in mosquito prevention actions.",
