Gram-negative bacteria were present in only seven cases. Receiving marrow from an unrelated donor was the only significant risk factor for bacteraemia in univariate regression analysis.

In contrast, death associated with bacteraemia caused by other bacteria, in particular gram-nega- tive bacteria, occurred in 4/17 (3/7 gram-negative bacteraemia). Thus, in general, prophylactic therapies and those initiated early are sufficient protection against such bacteraemias. It is therefore still important to continue using broad-spectrum antibiotics as first-line therapy in febrile episodes during the aplastic phase, since these types of bacteria are more virulent, although death from fulminant ARDS/MOF with \u2423-streptococci bacteraemia has been described. 23 In the latter cases, treatment with adequate antimicrobial agents has not modified the outcome. However, the few cases of fatal \u2423-streptococci or CNS infections do not indicate the use of vancomycin or teicoplanin as empirical therapy. A change of first-line antibiotics to agents more efficient against these two types of bacteria may be associated with several problems, mainly the risk for emergence of resistance against glycopeptides among the enterococcus and staphylococcus species. [24] [25] [26] This calls for restriction in the use of such antibiotics. Another potential problem is that presently available antibiotics covering gram-positive bacteria are also effective against the anaerobic flora and therefore may increase the risk of invasive fungal diseases. In this series, invasive fungal infections were infrequent, but the associated mortality was high. IFI were also the principal cause of early death among our patients despite early empirical therapy with amphotericin B or liposomal amphotericin B. 27, 28 To improve the prognosis for patients with IFI and to reduce the incidence, some issues require attention. In our setting, only 13 of 27 patients with IFI were diagnosed by blood culture, seven of these during the aplastic phase. Better early diagnostic procedures are needed. Candida-DNA detection by poly-merase chain reaction (PCR) is being developed to diagnose invasive candida in blood. 29 There are also reports indicating that blood cultures using large volumes of blood (\u0443 20 ml blood) yield a higher positive rate. 30 However, even if better procedures are developed for more accurate diagnosis the outcome may still be poor in patients with verified invasive fungal disorders despite currently available treatment. Thus, antifungal prophylaxis may be a better way to handle this problem. A few centres have reported a reduced incidence of invasive fungal diseases when using fluconazole, 400 mg/day, as prophylaxis during the aplastic period. 31, 32 However, this may lead to selection of resistant candida strains such as Candida kruseii and Candida glabratae. Moreover, fluconazole has no effect on aspergillus strains. 33 Use of amphotericin B for prophylaxis has not been accepted, because of the high incidence of nephrotoxicity using this drug. 33 The combination of amphotericin B with lipid-based delivery systems has significantly reduced the frequency of side-effects; however the high costs limit their use. 27, 28 In our study, most invasive candida infections (11 of 27) were associated with \u2423-streptococci bacteraemia. This indicates that such fungal infections may have been associated with invasion from a disrupted gastrointestinal mucosal barrier. Thus, reducing mucosal damage may also reduce the risk for invasive fungal infections. Recently, it has been found that IL-11 is an important cytokine in the upregulation of mucosal barriers. 34, 35 Use of IL-11 may offer a prophylactic biological approach to improving mucosal ability in preventing invasion by these microbes. It has been reported that neutrophils, monocytes and eosinophils kill candida blastospores by phagocytosis. In addition, neutrophils and monocytes can also kill fungal hyphae. In vitro data suggest that myeloperoxidase-dehydroperoxide and the superoxide systems are the major mechanisms responsible for intracellular killing of candida. These systems may be upregulated several fold by the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor GM-CSF, TNF\u2423 and in particular IFN\u2425, whereas a number of other cytokines are ineffective. 36 Univariate regression analysis clearly showed a significant difference in bacteraemia frequency between patients receiving grafts from unrelated compared to related donors (48 vs 31%), but no difference in mortality within 60 days between patient categories in the bacteraemia group and non-bacteraemia group. Furthermore, late infections are more common among patients receiving marrow from unrelated donors. 37 Our recipients of unrelated marrow receive more intensive immunosuppressive treatment (additional ATG/OKT-3 during conditioning, higher CsA dose and in some cases T cell depletion). 38 These data may indicate a need for adjustment of immunosuppressive therapy in such patients, although the increased incidence of GVHD in this group might be a limiting factor. 39 Furthermore, additional immunoprotective strategies should be considered in this patient category to reduce the risk of, in particular, mucosaassociated invasive fungal disorders and septicaemias, and the use of haematopoietic growth factors to reduce the duration of neutropenia should be considered. [40] [41] [42] The results of this study indicate that bacteraemia during the aplastic phase after BMT is associated with early death post-BMT, especially from invasive fungal infection and may be an indicator for those at high risk of early transplant-related mortality.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 813, "end": 815, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1306, "end": 1310, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1311, "end": 1315, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1316, "end": 1320, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1838, "end": 1841, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1842, "end": 1844, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2238, "end": 2240, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2370, "end": 2372, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2799, "end": 2802, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2803, "end": 2805, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2978, "end": 2980, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3107, "end": 3109, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3275, "end": 3278, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3279, "end": 3281, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3329, "end": 3339, "text": "(11 of 27)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3714, "end": 3717, "text": "34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3718, "end": 3720, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 4379, "end": 4381, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 4792, "end": 4794, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 4977, "end": 4979, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 5156, "end": 5158, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 5461, "end": 5465, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 5466, "end": 5470, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 5471, "end": 5475, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Ciprofloxacin: initial evaluation in immunocompromised patients", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Newland", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Wood", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1987, "venue": "Chemoterapia", "volume": "6", "issn": "", "pages": "408--409", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "The oral cavity as a port of entry for early infections in patients treated with bone marrow transplantation", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Heimdahl", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Mattsson", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": [], "last": "Dahll\u00f6f", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1989, "venue": "Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol", "volume": "68", "issn": "", "pages": "711--716", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Nosocomial coagulase-negative staphylococcal infections in bone marrow transplantation recipients with central vein catheter.
