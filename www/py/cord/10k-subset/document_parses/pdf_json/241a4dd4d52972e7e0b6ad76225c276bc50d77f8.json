Hallmarks of both syndromes are increased vascular permeability due to dysregulation of the endothelial cell barrier and acute thrombocytopenia. Humans become infected after inhalation of aerosolized excreta of persistently infected (but asymptomatic) rodents. The most severe form of HFRS in Europe is caused by Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV), and especially by the genotypes associated with Apodemus flavicollis and Apodemus ponticus rodents, which serve as natural reservoir hosts of the virus [8, 11, 19] . After an incubation period of 2-42 days (usually 2 weeks), HFRS starts with a febrile, flu-like illness lasting 3-7 days, followed by hypotension and oliguria (or even anuria) that may result in fatal shock. Glomerular and tubular disorders lead to kidney dysfunction and acute renal failure [10] ; hemodialysis is often required. Recovery occurs after a polyuric phase, which usually starts in the second week of illness. Hemorrhagic manifestations may appear towards the end of the febrile phase, while renal failure occurs during the hypotensive phase; pulmonary involvement is present in several cases, and sometimes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops [1, 19] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 213, "end": 216, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 715, "end": 718, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 719, "end": 722, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 723, "end": 726, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1021, "end": 1025, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1402, "end": 1405, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1406, "end": 1409, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Hantaviruses infect and replicate predominantly within vascular endothelial cells [27, 28] .

The observation of overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, known as a ''cytokine storm'', gave rise to the hypothesis that it may play a major role in the pathogenesis of HFRS [7] .

This response was decreased in the fatal case of the present study, since IL-2, IL-12, TNF-a, and IFN-c levels were extremely low, and the Th2/Th1 ratio was high (4.74), suggestive of predominance of the Th2 response. In contrast, these cytokines were increased in the group of the survivors (with severe or non-severe disease), suggesting an early and effective Th1 activation, which resulted in a favorable outcome. However, the Th2/Th1 ratio differed significantly between severe and non-severe cases (2.25 and 0.81, respectively, p \\ 0.05). Based on these results, we concluded that the Th1 response was high in the non-severe cases and low in the fatal case, while a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response The mean values for cytokines are shown. N, number of samples was seen in the survivors of severe disease. A mixed Th1/ Th2 immune response has also been reported for HPS patients, and it has been shown that the magnitude of Th1 response effector cytokines is correlated to HPS severity [3] . An association between a mild form of HFRS caused by Puumala virus and elevated levels of IFN-c and IL-12 has also been observed, which led the authors to suggest that the administration of exogenous IFN-c and IL-12 may provide antiviral benefits for the treatment of HFRS and thus warrants further investigation [7] . The level of IL-13, which is a cytokine produced by T lymphocytes, was also extremely low in the fatal case, significantly lower than in survivors with severe disease. It is of interest that the MIP-1a level was also decreased (below that of the control group) in the fatal case, while MIP-1b was on average fourfold higher than that of the control group (but lower than in the severe cases) ( Table 1 ). In fact, MIP-1a and MIP-1b chemokines attract distinct populations of lymphocytes with MIP-1a having greater effects than MIP-1b, particularly on B cells [23] . The proinflammatory chemokine IP-10 was increased in all HFRS cases, with the highest levels being observed in the fatal case. Expression of IP-10 is seen in many Th1-type inflammatory diseases, and it is thought to play an important role in recruiting activated T cells to sites of tissue inflammation [5] . A correlation of IP-10 with the viral load in CCHF patients has been reported recently; given that the viral load is critical for the outcome of the disease, it was suggested that IP-10 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease [21] . Furthermore, the most significant change in cytokine expression in HFRS cases caused by another hantavirus, Puumala virus, was observed for IP-10, which increased tenfold over the control value at the onset and remained elevated through the oliguric phase, progressively decreasing to a value approximately fivefold over controls by the convalescent phase [2] . In conclusion, the present study showed that the cytokine patterns differ between severe and non-severe DOBV HFRS cases and that an early and efficient Th1 response is critical for the patient's survival. The immune response is the result of numerous interactions and networks of several factors, including cytokines. Systems biology approaches are currently being used to curate the innate immunity interactome and to provide insight into the cross-talk between innate immunity pathways and other biological processes [15] . Similar approaches could enable a better understanding of the immune response in HFRS that may help to guide future studies for drug design.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1079, "end": 1082, "text":
