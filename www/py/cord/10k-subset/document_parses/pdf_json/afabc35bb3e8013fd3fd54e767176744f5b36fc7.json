The efficacy of HDCA in bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (BMT/PBSCT), however, has not yet been elucidated. Findings: We conducted a cohort study to compare the prognosis of HDCA/CY/TBI (N = 435) and CY/TBI (N = 1667) in BMT/PBSCT for AML/MDS using a Japanese transplant registry database. The median age was 38 years, and 86.0 % of the patients had AML. Unrelated donors comprised 54.6 %, and 63.9 % of donors were human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched. Overall survival (OS) was not improved in the HDCA/CY/TBI group (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.14; p = 0.13). Neutrophil engraftment was inferior (HR, 0.80; p < 0.01), and the incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis and thrombotic microangiopathy increased in HDCA/CY/TBI (HR, 1.47 and 1.60; p = 0.06 and 0.04, respectively), leading to significantly higher non-relapse mortality (NRM; HR, 1.48; p < 0.01).

These differences in GVL effects can partly explain the discrepancy in the efficacy of HDCA on post-transplant relapse or disease-related death. A larger proportion of patients with high-risk disease and worse performance status in the HDCA/CY/TBI group may confound the outcomes, but multivariate and subgroup analyses indicated unimproved prognosis in HDCA/CY/TBI even after eliminating those confounding factors. Moreover, subgroup analyses regarding the percentage of myeloblast just before conditioning regimens were carried out; no significant differences of OS between CY/TBI and HDCA/CY/TBI were found in any subgroups (data not shown). The bias in regard to the HCT centers, however, still remains to be overcome in this study.
