This 5-year cohort study was performed at an academic tertiary care center. EEGs in 154 patients with altered mental status were classified according to five predefined patterns: Isolated continuous slowing of background activity (theta, theta/ delta, and delta activity) and patterns with slowing background activity with episodic transients [i.e., triphasic waves (TWs) or frontal intermittent delta activity (FIRDA)]. Clinical characteristics, blood tests and neuroimaging were compared among groups. Associations between EEG patterns and structural and non-structural abnormalities were calculated. Glasgow Outcome Score [3 at discharge was defined as favorable and 1-3 as unfavorable outcome. In multivariable analyses, theta was associated with brain atrophy (OR 2.6, p = 0.020), theta/delta with intracerebral hemorrhages (OR 6.8, p = 0.005), FIRDA with past cerebrovascular accidents (OR 2.7, p = 0.004), TWs with liver or multi-organ failure (OR 6, p = 0.004; OR 4, p = 0.039), and delta activity with alcohol/drug abuse with or without intoxication, and HIV infection (OR 3.8, p = 0.003; OR 9, p = 0.004). TWs were associated with death (OR 4.5, p = 0.005); theta/delta with unfavorable outcomes (OR 2.5, p = 0.033), while patients with FIRDA had favorable outcomes (OR 4.8, p = 0.004). In encephalopathic patients, well-defined EEG patterns are associated with specific pathological conditions and outcomes, suggesting that mechanistic hypotheses underlie these abnormal EEG patterns.

Based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association, acute alteration in mental status was defined as altered consciousness and/or change in cognition (i.e., memory deficit, disorientation, language disturbance) or the development of a perceptual disturbance that was not better accounted for by a preexisting, established or evolving dementia. The disturbance had to have developed over a short time period (hours to days) [2] . EEGs were classified by two certified electroencephalographers into isolated continuous slowing of background activity (theta, theta/delta, or delta activity) and patterns with slowing background activity with episodic transients (TWs or FIRDA). Theta activity was defined as generalized slow background activity with a frequency of 4-7 Hz and amplitudes of [40 lV without intrusions of delta (\\4 Hz) or alpha activity (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) for [20 % of recording during wakefulness (Fig. 1a) . Theta/delta activity was defined as generalized slow background activity of 4-7 Hz and amplitudes of [80 lV with intrusion of alpha activity (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) for \\20 % and intermixed with delta activity (\\4 Hz) in 20-50 % of recording during drowsiness or arousal (Fig. 1b) . Delta activity was defined as generalized background activity of \\4 Hz and amplitudes of [80 lV with intrusion of theta or alpha activity for \\20 % of recording during drowsiness or arousal (Fig. 1c ). TWs were defined as repetitive electrographic elements consisting of three phases, each longer than the preceding one: a surface positive high-amplitude ([70 lV) wave preceded and followed by negative waves with smaller amplitude as first described 1950 [18] and precisely defined by Fisch [17] (Fig. 1d) . FIRDA was defined as a repetitive appearance of rhythmic slow waves with a frequency \\4 Hz with a frontal predilection [1, 8, 10, 11, 22] (Fig. 1e) . None of the patients had TWs and FIRDA simultaneously. In patients with TWs or FIRDA, slowing of background activity was assessed as mentioned above. Patients with a normal EEG were excluded.

Significant findings in ANOVA global test were additionally evaluated by multiple comparison tests using Bonferroni corrections. Covariates were categorized as structural (i.e., brain abnormalities, such as atrophy, white matter changes, intracerebral hemorrhages, posterior reversible encephalopathy, past and present cerebrovascular accidents) and non-structural (i.e., organ failures or insufficiencies, infections, intoxications, or drug abuse). Univariable logistic regression was used to calculate the odds of patients' clinical and imaging abnormalities having one of the five EEG patterns. For all significant results in the univariable logistic regression, a multivariable analysis was performed (adjusting for characteristics, which were significant in the overall comparisons and the use of intravenous anesthetic drugs, as evolution of cortical neuronal dysfunction by depth of anesthesia is well described [33] ). Multiple logistic regression models were used for categorical outcomes and multiple linear regression models for continuous outcomes.

However, predominance of delta activity in patients with alcohol/drug abuse or intoxication is consistent with early work on the neurophysiology of anesthetics [33] . Interestingly, there was no significant coincidence of patients with HIV infection and use of anesthetics or alcohol abuse that would have explained the prevalence of delta activity in patients with HIV. Encephalopathy related to HIV was diagnosed in nearly half of these patients. One possible explanation might be the high burden of marked confluent white matter changes (Schmidt's score 3) seen in all our patients with documented HIV encephalopathy. Studies have described pronounced white matter changes in brain imaging of HIVinfected patients [21] , possible correlates of the pathologic changes in the thalamo-cortical circuits that underlie cortical slowing. Overall there was a high prevalence of structural factors such as brain atrophy and/or white matter changes (74 %) in our cohort, suggesting diminished neurologic reserve. This contributes together with toxic, metabolic, and infectious elements to the appearance of encephalopathy. The co-occurrence of the most common structural with non-structural problems such as infections and metabolic problems was seen in up to one-third of our patients, underscoring the importance of their interplay in the genesis of encephalopathy. However, information on additional pathologic conditions, such as acute changes of blood flow or intracranial pressure could not be assessed retrospectively and would perhaps lead to an even larger proportion of patients with co-occuring acute and chronic pathologic conditions. Prospective studies are needed to determine particular EEG changes in these acute medical conditions and to answer the question if EEG might provide early information in the setting of such critical conditions. The associations of specific EEG patterns with structural and non-structural pathologic conditions have been previously described with TWs and FIRDA [1, 10, 11, 15, 16, 19, 22, 24, 26, 30, 34, 35, 37] . TWs are thought to reflect the activity of thalamo-cortical circuits which also underlie generalized epileptiform discharges and the sleep spindle activity. These structures may well be modified by subcortical white matter disease caused by neurodegenerative or ischemic processes [26, 30, 34] , leading to projected slow activity or the generation of non-epileptic periodic discharges or TWs [25] . However, in our study five of six patients with TWs had isolated metabolic problems with no signs of brain atrophy or white matter changes. This suggests that structural abnormalities may promote or enable projected slower activity (delta activity or TWs), but are not essential for their appearance [25] . A clear and isolated association of renal insufficiency with the appearance of TWs could not be shown, possibly due to the small number of patients without renal problems. Aside from the significant association of liver insufficiency and multi-organ failure with TWs, there was a high odds ratio for TWs with every unit increase in ammonia or urea. Hughes et al. [23] have shown that patients with abnormal EEG patterns (defined as slow wave activity and/or epileptiform patterns in the form of bilateral spike and wave complexes) had significantly higher blood urea. Demendts et al. [12] demonstrated an accurate and sensitive EEG correlation with brain dysfunction in hepatic encephalopathy, but could not show an association with ammonia levels. Remarkably, patients with TWs had high odds of death during the same hospital stay, a result that underscores the unfavorable outcome and high mortality for this encephalopathic condition [4, 34] . Our finding of increasing odds for emergence of TWs with increasing serum levels of urea and/or ammonia further emphasizes that severity may be more important than merely the presence of organ dysfunction. Our finding of FIRDA being associated with past cerebrovascular accidents supports earlier retrospective studies that found a predominance of fixed, prior structural brain damage, such as stroke, abscesses, and encephalitis aside from non-structural metabolic encephalopathies [15] . In a prospective study, Accolla and colleagues found an independent association of structural brain lesions with the occurrence of FIRDA. They further described an association of asymmetric FIRDA with underlying focal brain lesions [1] . Early descriptions suggested a relationship between FIRDA and raised intracranial pressure [10] . Later studies, however, revealed a great variety of conditions that could be associated with FIRDA, including tumors [11, 16] , subcortical lesions [24] , brain edema [19] , and Creutzfeld-Jacob disease [35] .

Unfavorable outcome was associated with theta/delta activity and death with the presence of TWs, while favorable outcome was mainly seen in patients with FIRDA, possibly because this pattern generally reflects an old fixed structural problem (e.g., stroke). Of note, a large proportion of patients with FIRDA had a fast (theta) background activity (73 %) and tended to have more intrusions of alpha activity (38 %) than in patients with theta background activity with (0 %) or without TWs (0 %). The trend to faster background activity in patients with FIRDA may be an additional explanation for the better outcome also reflected by their higher mean GCS. In hospitalized patients with encephalopathy, the associations of EEG abnormalities with outcomes had previously been demonstrated in patients with hepatic encephalopathy and TWs. Marchetti et al. [29] described an inverse correlation of decreasing EEG frequency in patients with cirrhosis and survival, and Bahamon-Dussan and colleagues reported poor prognosis for survival in patients with altered mental status and TWs [4] . Both studies are consistent with our findings. One of the most important confounders in the evaluation of patients with encephalopathy can be the use of sedating intravenous drugs, since a progressive decrease in cortical activity is known to occur with increasing depth of sedation [33] . However, sedating drugs were only used in a few (13 %) patients during or 24 h prior to the EEG recording and were not used in significantly different proportions among the five EEG groups. Nevertheless, we included sedative drugs in our multivariable model. Except for the link between posterior reversible encephalopathy and delta activity, the associations identified in the univariable analyses remained significant in the multivariable models, suggesting robust associations. It is of note that the identified EEG patterns represent an intermediate state of brain dysfunction which, to a certain degree, might change significantly during the course of recovery or worsening of encephalopathy while the identified structural abnormalities in the neuroimaging represent presumably longstanding if not permanent conditions. To what degree the EEG patterns are persistent or variable over time remains unknown. The retrospective nature of this study with a consequent lack of such follow-up EEGs in most cases did not permit sufficient further analysis. Prospective studies with a repeat EEG after resolution of the acute encephalopathy would be important in this context.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 948, "end": 952, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1173, "end": 1176, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1462, "end": 1466, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "There are several limitations to our study. These include the retrospective, single-center design and the size of the subgroups limiting the generalizability of our results.

It is clear that patients may have more than one of the patterns under investigation; have mixtures of transient abnormalities (e.g., FIRDA) and background abnormalities (e.g., theta); and have co-occurrences of several structural and non-structural pathologic conditions. Analyses of such specific combinations require a larger cohort. The extent to which the specific and isolated pathologic conditions had a causal role in the development of the defined EEG disturbances cannot be determined by this study.
