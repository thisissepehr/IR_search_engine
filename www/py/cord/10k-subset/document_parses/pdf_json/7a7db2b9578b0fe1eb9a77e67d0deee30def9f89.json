There are no sequence or structure requirements to encapsidate singlestranded nucleic acid cargo. In this work, we wanted to determine how the length of the cargo impacts the stability and structure of the assembled CLPs. We hypothesized that cargo neutralizes the basic region of the alphavirus capsid protein and if the cargo is long enough, it will also act to scaffold the CP monomers together. Experimentally we found that CLPs encapsidating short 27mer oligonucleotides were less stable than CLPs encapsidating 48mer or 90mer oligonucleotides under different chemical and thermal conditions. Furthermore, cryo-EM studies showed there were structural differences between CLPs assembled with 27mer and 48mer cargo. To mimic the role of the cargo in CLP assembly we made a mutant (4D) where we substituted a cluster of four Lys residues in the CP with four Asp residues. We found that these few amino acid substitutions were enough to initiate CLP assembly in the absence of cargo. The cargo-free 4D CLPs show higher resistance to ionic strength and increased temperature compared to wild-type cargo containing CLPs suggesting their CLP assembly mechanism might also be different.",

First, during extracellular transmission and intracellular transport, the capsid protects the viral genome from being released prematurely or being targeted for degradation. Second, in response to an environmental trigger such as a change in pH, the capsid releases its genome and viral replication begins inside the cell [1] . A capsid that is misassembled may not disassemble at the right time or location during an infection, and subsequently the infection will be attenuated. Understanding the mechanisms and physical basis behind capsid assembly will identify targets for anti-viral therapeutics and provide insight for the design of capsid-based nanoparticles [2] [3] [4] .",

Interactions between either capsid proteins (CP) or nucleic acid and CP contribute to capsid stability, but their exact stoichiometric composition varies for each virus. Individual subunit contacts may be weak but as an entity, capsids are extremely stable.

            "text": "The requirements for nucleic acid to promote in vitro selfassembly vary. Some viruses like MS2 require a stem loopcontaining cargo for assembly to occur [11, 12] . Other viruses like the immature HIV capsid and alphavirus nucleocapsid core require a polyanionic cargo but there is no sequence or structure requirement in vitro [13] [14] [15] [16] . In contrast, Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus and brome mosaic virus can assemble in the absence of nucleic acid but if nucleic acid is present, regardless of its sequence, it will be packaged [17, 18] . In vivo, viruses must package their genomic material to propagate an infection. Many CP contain a domain rich in basic residues (e.g. arginine-rich motifs) which binds to the negatively-charged viral genome. Theoretical studies have shown that a charge ratio (negative charges from cargo to positive charges from CP) ranging between ~1 and 2 is optimal for assembly of a closed capsid; capsids have a preference for being 'overcharged' or containing more negative charges [19] [20] [21] [22] . However, experimental studies have shown that particle assembly can occur with a charge ratio as broad as 0.3 and 9 [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] .",

Self-assembly of the core can be recapitulated in vitro to form nucleocapsid core-like particles (CLPs), but only in the presence of anionic cargo [13, 16] . The cargo requirement can be fulfilled by single-stranded DNA or RNA oligos of at least 14 bases in length, heparan sulfate, or gold nanoparticles coated with carboxylated PEG. CLP assembly has been demonstrated with CP from several alphaviruses including Ross River (RRV), Sindbis, and Western equine encephalitis [16, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Alphavirus CP has a conserved N-terminal domain (residues 1-120 RRV numbering) enriched in basic residues (~30 out of 120 residues), and is thought to mediate electrostatic interactions between the CP and viral genome during core assembly [35] [36] [37] . There is no atomic structure of the alphavirus N-terminus domain. The C-terminus of alphavirus CP ~121-270 (RRV numbering) has a conserved chymotrypsin-like domain and folds independently of any CP-cargo interactions [38, 39] . In this work we use RRV CP.",

However, despite differences in stability, the CLPs with longer cargo still had incomplete capsid shells. To test the importance of electrostatics-mediated CP scaffolding, we mutated the CP and introduced a cluster of anionic residues in the N-terminus of RRV CP.

Two cargos, the 27mer and 48hp were used in previous work [16, 24, 32] . The 27mer was predicted to be linear and the 48hp was predicted to have a hairpin structure.

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and TEM (figure S1 (stacks.iop.org/ JPhysCM/29/484003/mmedia)) were used to measure particle size, and light scattering intensity was used to determine the relative amount of CLPs assembled with each oligo.

The ionic strength at which half of the total CP assembles into CLPs (50% intensity or CLP 50 ) was used to determine the relative stability of CLPs assembled with different length oligos. The CLP 50 for the 27mer encapsidated CLPs required ~125 mM NaCl while the CLP 50 concentration for 48hp, 48lin, and 90mer fell between ~240-250 mM NaCl (figure 1(B)). The particle size, however, was about ~40 nm in diameter independent of the ionic strength of the reaction (data not shown), which is similar to the size of the nucleocapsid core in the virion [24, 28] . Our results show that CLPs containing longer oligos are more stable and require increased ionic strength to disassemble. These results are consistent with our hypothesis that the length of the oligo in the CLP also dictates the function of the oligo. For example, shorter oligos, like the 27mer, are long enough to neutralize the charge of the basic region of the N-terminus of the CP. However, longer oligos may not only neutralize the charge but act as a scaffold and bring CP monomers together. In addition to the cargo having a role as scaffold, it is entropically less advantageous to encapsidate many short cargo segments than a few longer ones. Thus the increase in CLPs made with longer oligos could be from both the cargo length and cargo function.",

The surface area of the oligo that potentially contacts the CP is predicted to affect CLP assembly. We built a 3D model using 3dRNA [40, 41] . We performed ten independent molecular dynamics simulations on each oligo, at low and high salt concentrations, for a cumulative of 480-1000 ns each, the results are shown in figure 1(C). We concluded that our oligo sequences had increasing footprints based on length and presence of secondary structure. We found that only the 48hp contained a hairpin, consistent with our initial design. The presence of the hairpin made 48hp have a smaller radius of gyration than 48lin (figure 1(C), table S1). Furthermore, we determined that all oligos could collapse into a more compact structure under high-salt conditions, presumably because the salt ions screen and attenuate the Coulomb interactions of the negative charges on the oligo (table S1). To help understand the relationship between the cargo and the CPs, we show the 27mer in the presence of the CP (residues 120-264 of Sindbis) arranged as seen in the mature virion [42] (figures 1(D) and (E)).",

Experimentally, the CLP 50 for CLP disassembly would be higher than the CLP 50 determined during assembly reactions. We compared assembly (figure 1(B)) and disassembly of CLPs in the presence of increasing ionic strength (figure 2(A)). For disassembly measurements we took preassembled CLPs made in low salt, titrated increasing amounts of NaCl, and monitored light scattering intensity for decreasing amounts of CLP. While there was a small shift in CLP 50 for the disassembly of 48hp CLPs compared to the assembly, no detectable hysteresis was observed in CLPs made with 27mer, 48lin, or 90mer, suggesting that these CLPs are not closed capsids and/or the CP does not undergo a major conformational change when forming a CLP.",

We examined CLPs assembled with 27mer, 48hp, and 48lin by cryo-EM. We had three questions: Are the CLPs made with longer cargo closed capsids? Are the structures of CLPs made with longer cargos (48hp and 48lin) different than the structure of the 27mer CLP possibly a consequence of cargo length? Is there a difference between the structures of the CLPs made with 48hp and 48lin as suggested in the hysteresis experiments (figure 2(A))? Cryo-EM images of 48hp and 48lin CLPs showed that, like the 27mer CLPs, a majority of the particles were spherical (figure 2(B), top panel) but we also observed some individual particles with non-uniform density distribution at the surface (figure 2(B), arrow); particle diameters did not vary by more than 4% from the average size. We also observed very low amounts of multiplets in all CLP samples. When processing images, we determined that there were major structural differences between CLPs assembled with the 27mer compared to those assembled with longer cargo. The 48hp CLPs and 48lin CLPs were larger, with average diameters of 43 nm and 41 nm respectively, compared to 27mer CLPs which were 37 nm in diameter (figure 2(B), insets). Rotationally and translationally averaged particle images showed that both 48hp and 48lin CLPs have three concentric rings surrounding a dense center; whereas the 27mer CLP has only two rings around its center ( figure 2(B) , insets). Reference-free 2D classification was used to assess the structural features from the cryo-EM images (figure 2(C)). The resulting class averages revealed partially ordered density at the same positions as the three rings seen in the rotationally and translationally averaged particles (figure 2(B), inset).

Applying icosahedral symmetry will allow resolution of the overall surface topology and arrangement of the CLPs while minimizing the effects of gaps or defects in a largely icosahedral CP lattice. If we imposed icosahedral symmetry on completely asymmetric particles we would expect to see a smooth surface. We determined the structure of 48hp and 48lin CLPs to ~14.5 \u00c5 resolution using 4971 and 3569 particles respectively (figure 2(D)). These CLP structures were compared to our previously published 27mer CLP structure. All CLPs had T = 4 symmetry but their surface arrangements were not the same (figure 2(D)). When comparing the CLPs made with the different oligos we saw that the orientation corresponding to the CP density was rotated between each structure. Taken together, our DLS and cryo-EM data show that CLPs assembled with 27mer cargo are structurally different than CLPs assembled with the longer cargos, possibly contributing to their differences in stability. The 48hp CLPs showed a slight shift in CLP 50 between assembly/disassembly compared to 48lin CLPs, however, at our resolution, CLPs assembled with both 48hp and 48lin oligos have incomplete CP shells.",

Our current results indicate that the cargo is important for both charge neutralization and scaffolding multiple CP monomers. We hypothesized that we could fulfill the function of the cargo by introducing polyanionic charge into the N-terminus of the CP itself. To test this hypothesis we made a 4D mutant where we mutated four consecutive Lys residues (104-107, RRV CP numbering) to Asp (figure 3(A)) thus substituting four basic amino acids with four acidic ones. We would predict cargofree assembly to occur with the 4D mutant because the 4D could either neutralize charges on the same CP monomer, similar to a 27mer oligo, or neutralize charges on an adjacent CP monomer. In the process of neutralizing charges on an adjacent monomer, the N-terminus would be fulfilling the scaffolding role of the cargo as well. We further predicted that the 4D mutant would be more sensitive to ionic strength because there would be fewer electrostatic interactions between CP monomers were present, similar to CLPs made with shorter oligos.",

            "text": "Unlike CLPs assembled with oligos and WT CP, when the ionic strength of the reaction mixture was increased, the amount of cargo-free 4D CLPs formed did not decrease ( figure 3(C) ). This was surprising since the mutations in 4D CP were expected to promote electrostatic-mediated scaffolding between adjacent N-termini of CP monomers. In the 4D cargo-free samples we also observed a small peak corresponding to about 10 nm that was also present in low and high ionic strength buffer. We speculate this smaller peak corresponds to unassembled proteins but do not know their oligomeric state. The differences in particle diameter and resistance to ionic strength suggested that 4D CP in CLPs interacted differently than WT CP in CLPs assembled with oligo. To explore this possibility, we used differential scanning fluorometry to compare the thermal stability of cargofree 4D CLPs to CLPs assembled with WT CP and 27mer and 48hp cargos (figure 3(D)) [43, 44] . Based on the stability of the 4D CLPs under increased ionic strength, we expected 4D CLPs to be more stable to thermal denaturation than WT CLPs assembled in the presence of cargo: that the CP-CP interactions in 4D CLPs would be stronger than the cargo-CP scaffolding interactions in WT, cargo-containing CLPs. The inflection point for 27mer and 48hp CLPs were ~49 \u00b0C and ~52 \u00b0C respectively, consistent with our previous findings that 48hp CLPs were more stable than 27mer CLPs. These monophasic melting curves suggest that CLP and CP melting are simultaneous. We found that 4D CLPs produced a biphasic melt-curve with inflection points of ~48 \u00b0C and 54 \u00b0C ( figure 3(D) ). These results indicate that 4D CLPs have two classes of interactions that combine to stabilize CP. We propose that the first inflection point may correspond to the electrostatic interactions between Asp rich region of one CP monomer with the basic rich region of adjacent CP monomer. The second inflection point may correspond to new hydrophobic or protein-protein contacts between the CP monomers that are present in the 4D CLPs but not in the WT+cargo CLPs.",

            "text": "Taking our results and previously published work, we propose that cargo has two functions in alphavirus CLP assembly ( figure 4) . First, the anionic charges neutralize basic residues on the CP N-terminus, preventing electrostatic repulsion between CP monomers and possibly inducing structural changes in CP that confer assembly-competence. Second, cargo acts as a molecular scaffold upon which multiple CP monomers can adhere and interact. Short-range CP-CP interactions that drive assembly are promoted when CP monomers are brought within close proximity to each other via molecular scaffolding. The capacity of cargo to scaffold multiple CP monomers over long intermolecular distances increases with cargo length and the availability of anionic charge. Therefore non-adjacent CP monomers too distant to interact directly via CP-CP interactions can still be templated for CLP assembly. As cargo length decreases, so does the available anionic charge to neutralize basic residues on multiple CP monomers and to scaffold CP over long distances. Charge neutralization is favored over long-distance scaffolding when cargo is short, and assembly is driven primarily by CP-CP interactions between adjacent CP monomers [24] . However when longer cargo is present, both neutralization and scaffolding of multiple CP monomers is possible, allowing for a greater number of intermolecular contacts between CP and cargo alike. We suggest that CLPs formed with longer cargo are more stable to increasing ionic strength and thermal denaturation because of increased intermolecular interactions between CP and cargo conferred with an increase in available anionic charge and scaffold length. One could also speculate that with longer cargo, the assembly competent CP is in a different conformation compared to CP bound to shorter cargo.",

One explanation for this phenotype is the mutations have minimized any repulsion that may be present between the more positively charged N-terminal domains of CP. Now, the N-termini of CP can come in closer contact and new CP-CP interactions are formed. When the N-terminus arginine-rich RNA binding domain from Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus is removed, T = 1 particles are formed presumably because the repulsion between basic residues was removed. With HBV, CP protein missing the arginine-rich domain can self-assemble but when this domain is present either nucleic acid or phosphorylation of the CP is necessary, implying that electrostatic repulsion between argininerich domains must be neutralized before assembly can occur, ( [45, 46] , personal communication M Comos Garcia and W Gelbart).",

There was no obvious difference between CLPs made with 48mer and 90mer in our assays. One possible explanation for the retention of defects is that we are observing kinetic traps, often caused by relatively strong interactions between subunits [7, 8] .

From our cryo-EM 2D classification we see multiple layers of density in particles encapsidating the longer cargo (longer than 27mer) suggesting increased order in the CP or additional contacts made because of the scaffolding function of the cargo. The C-terminal domain of the atomic structure of RRV CP fit well in the cryo density of the CLPs suggesting the differences in topology and inner density is due to rotation/translation and N-terminal CP conformation, all dependent on the length of the encapsidated cargo. We also speculate that the different numbers of concentric rings of density implies different N-terminal conformations in CP and thus a structural difference between CLPs containing 27mer compared to CLPs with 48mer ( figure 2(B) ). This model agrees well with the role of cargo as a scaffold or bridge between CP monomers, orienting them into different conformation, and provides an explanation for why cargo is required for assembly. This model would also be consistent with previous work that showed crosslinking retroviral Gag proteins, with a nucleic acid or by inserting a coiled -coil domain, led to enhanced assembly [47, 48] ; an effect readily explained by increasing the valency of the assembly competent CP [6, 49] .",

Using full length RRV CP and 27mer as cargo, Wang et al proposed that an assembly competent CP subunit consists of one 27mer bound to the N-terminus of one CP [24] . Going from subunit to CLP assembly, the authors put forth a model where strong CP-CP subunit interactions trap structural defects, leading to incomplete CP shells. This model provides an explanation for the structural defects observed in the cryo-EM classification, but does not account for the possible role of longer cargo in scaffolding or bridging between CP monomers to promote CLP assembly. Reports using CP peptides and longer cargo (48-132 nucleotides in length) have proposed that CP-nucleic acid binding promotes the stabilization of a CP dimer bound to nucleic acid. In this model, CP dimers function as the assembly competent subunit, and multiple dimers then oligomerize to form CLPs [29, 33, 34] . Additional interactions between adjacent helical N-terminal domains [30, 31] , and/or interactions between adjacent C-terminal domains [50] were thought to follow during CLP assembly. Whether CLP assembly occurs with subunits of monomeric or multiple CPs bound to cargo, or additional interactions between purported helical domains of CP occur subsequent to cargo-binding, is not directly addressed in our experiments. However, our results suggest a direct correlation between the length of cargo and its ability to interact with the N-terminus of CP, leading to altered CP conformations in an assembled CLP and differential CLP stability.",

These studies suggest that specific RNA-CP interactions occur and then subsequently the CP-CP interactions drive assembly around the viral RNA. It has also been proposed that very weak CP-CP interactions do not promote assembly but too strong CP-CP interactions lead to kinetic traps [55] .",

Through computational simulations Perlmutter and Hagan [20] determined that the most stable capsids have regions of the genome that are not directly binding to CP but are bridging adjacent CP monomers or subunits, acting as a scaffold or linker. In our model, we propose that overcharging occurs in the CLPs as the length of encapsidated cargo and the amount of available anionic charge increases over the number of basic residues to neutralize the N-terminus of CP. It is important to note that in these studies we do not purify CLPs or subsequently quantify the amount of encapsidated cargo or extent of overcharging.",

Assembly was initiated by adding CP to obtain a final concentration of 3 \u00b5M in a final volume of 30 \u00b5l. Measurements were taken on a Malvern Zetasizer \u2122 Nano Z with the attenuator set to 8 and the measurement window at 4.2 mm. Each measurement consisted of at least three runs, each run averaged over 10 s. A peak corresponding to the hydrodynamic diameter of the core like particles (~48 nm) was observed. The data was plotted with the percent derived count rate on the Y-axis and the salt concentration on the X-axis. For disassembly reactions CLPs were pre-assembled in 20 mM salt and diluted into Buffer C containing indicated amounts of NaCl. The final concentration of CP was 2.5 \u00b5M in a volume of 30 \u00b5l for each reaction. The data was visualized using the Zetasizer software from Malvern and analysis was done using Microsoft Excel 2013 and GraphPad Prism. DSF CLP stability was monitored by the increase in the fluorescence of the SYPRO Orange dye. CLPs were prepared at a charge ratio of 1:1 and diluted in 20 mM Phosphate, pH 6.8, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA to yield a final protein concentration of 2.5 \u00b5M in a final volume of 30 \u00b5l. Phosphate buffer was used instead of HEPES because it has a low temper ature dependence (\u0394pH/\u0394T = \u22120.0028). For all samples 3 ul of SYPRO Orange was added, yielding a final concentration of 2.5\u00d7 (the absolute concentration is not disclosed by the manufacturer). MicroAmp optical adherent film was used to cover the microplate during the heating process. Buffer and water were used as negative controls and CP without the cargo was used as the positive control. The CLPs were incubated in a StepOnePlus \u2122 Real-Time PCR instrument. Samples were treated from 25 \u00b0C to 99.9 \u00b0C, in increments of 0.26\u00b0 steps per 20 s and each temperature was maintained for 80 s. The fluorescence intensity was measured every 20 s.

(B) Cargo 48 nucleotides and longer neutralize and scaffold CP monomers that potentially stabilize the assembled CLP. (C) Mutagenesis of the N-terminus of CP can fulfill the role of neutralization and all for CLP assembly as observed with 4D cargo-free CLPs. The CLPs formed via the three pathways have different sensitivities to ionic strength and heat suggesting, consistent with them being structurally different.",
