Methods: The study was conducted at the Down syndrome outpatient Center of Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, in Rome.

We found that Pidotimod treatment did not influence the number of B, T and NK cells in the peripheral blood, but improved the survival and function of B cells in vitro. Ex vivo stimulation with CpG measures the ability of B cells to react to TLR9 [24] . In response to CpG, memory B cells proliferate and differentiate into antibody producing cells. Whereas switched memory B cells produce IgG and IgA, IgM memory B cells secrete IgM. We showed that, after Pitodimod treatment, B cells increased in numbers, proliferated more and secreted higher amounts of IgM antibodies, whereas the concentration of IgG and IgA remained stable. Thus, the function of IgM memory B cell is significantly potentiated after Pitodimod treatment.
