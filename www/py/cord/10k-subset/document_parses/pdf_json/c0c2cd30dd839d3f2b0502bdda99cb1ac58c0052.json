Design: A prospective cohort study. Setting: The adult medical ICU of a tertiary care, university-based medical center. Participants: The study population consisted of 48 patients admitted to the ICU, 24 of whom received mechanical ventilation. Measurements: All patients were evaluated for the development and persistence of delirium on a daily basis by a geriatric or psychiatric specialist with expertise in delirium assessment using the Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV) criteria of the American Psychiatric Association, the reference standard for delirium ratings. Primary outcomes measured were length of stay in the ICU and hospital. Results: The mean onset of delirium was 2.6 days (S. D. 1.7), and the mean duration was 3.4 1.9 days. Of the 48 patients, 39 (81.3 %) devel-oped delirium, and of these 29 (60.4 %) developed the complication while still in the ICU. The duration of delirium was associated with length of stay in the ICU (r = 0.65, P = 0.0001) and in the hospital (r = 0.68, P < 0.0001). Using multivariate analysis, delirium was the strongest predictor of length of stay in the hospital (P = 0.006) even after adjusting for severity of illness, age, gender, race, and days of benzodiazepine and narcotic drug administration. Conclusions: In this patient cohort, the majority of patients developed delirium in the ICU, and delirium was the strongest independent determinant of length of stay in the hospital. Further study and monitoring of delirium in the ICU and the risk factors for its development are warranted.",

Among general medical or surgical patients, the frequency of delirium varies from 15 % to 50 % [1, 2, 3] . These demographic data reflect non-ICU patients and there are, unfortunately, sparse data concerning the demographics of delirium in the ICU [4, 5] and even less on its impact on outcomes among medical ICU patients. The incidence of acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation rises tenfold from the age of 55\u00b185 years [6] , resulting in greater numbers of elderly patients treated in our ICUs [7, 8] . Without appropriate preventive and management strategies, the aging of the population will likely result in an increased burden of delirium among mechanically ventilated patients across the country [9, 10, 11] , a factor which could strongly effect discharge rates to nursing homes following hospital discharge [2, 12] .",

Exclusion criteria defined a priori included a history of chronic dementia, psychosis, mental retardation, or other neurologic diseases that would confound the diagnosis of delirium (e.g., cerebrovascular accident with residual cognitive impair-ment), and patient or family refusal to participate. Twelve patients were excluded due to underlying chronic dementia or psychosis, and there were three refusals, leaving the 53 patients who were enrolled. Five patients were never evaluated by the reference standard geriatric or psychiatric specialist and were therefore excluded from further analysis. This left 48 patients upon which to base the current report.",

            "text": "The institutional review board approved this study, and informed consent was obtained from the patient and/or the surrogate. Two study nurses enrolled patients each morning and recorded baseline demographics, severity of illness data using the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score [21] , activities of daily living [22] , and risk factors for delirium derived from data in the literature [2, 3, 14, 15, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27] . The modified Blessed Dementia Rating Scale (mBDRS) [28] was used to screen for dementia via family or surrogate interviews. This use of the mBDRS is consistent with its original intent, as it was validated as a dementia screening instrument by comparing the structured mBDRS surrogate interview with the patients' neuropathologic findings at autopsy. The surrogates also completed a set of global questions (rated on a 1\u00b15 scale) that were related to their perceptions of the presence or absence of dementia and the likelihood of the development of delirium. While no patients with documented chronic dementia were enrolled in this investigation, it is possible that patients with mild dementia were admitted to the ICU without a prior diagnosis. To account for the possibility of such baseline cognitive deficits, we defined a priori a subgroup of patients as having \u00aapossible mild dementia\u00ba at enrollment if any of the following three criteria were met: (1) the geriatric psychiatric expert rated them as demented; (2) they had an mBDRS [28] of 3 or greater (lower than the usual cutoff of 4 or greater, thereby increasing sensitivity for detection of dementia); or (3) a rating on the question answered by the surrogate of 3 or greater out of 5 as \u00aapossibly having dementia.\u00ba Once enrolled, patients were followed daily until hospital discharge (see Reference Standard evaluations below). At the time of hospital discharge, the patients completed the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [29] , Geriatric Depression Scale [30] , SF-12 [31] , and Maugeri Respiratory Foundation-28 (MRF-28) [32] quality of life instruments. The SF-12 is summarized using mental and physical component scores, which range from 0 to 100 (100 = optimal). The MRF\u00b128 is a disease-specific quality of life instrument designed for use in patients with chronic respiratory diseases [32] , and it is scored from 0 to 100 with lower numbers indicating better quality of life (0 = optimal) based on respiratory disability.",

For this investigation, psychoactive drug days were counted as any day on which a patient received either a narcotic or a benzodiazepine either IV or PO (recognizing, of course, that numerous other drugs are implicated to have deliriogenic features). Days were rounded to the nearest digit. Since the histogram of hospital stay showed a skewed distribution, the data were transformed using the log scale. The transformed variable was approximately normally distributed. The correlation of each of the outcome variable (e.g., ICU length of stay and hospital length of stay) was calculated with each of the covariates in univariate analysis. The relationship between delirium and outcome adjusted for covariates was examined using multiple linear regression analysis. Statistical significance was defined as a P value < 0.05.

S., involving over 17.5 million in-patient days and accounting for at least $4 billion in Medicare expenditures [1, 2, 3, 10, 23, 37] . Medical ICU patients are among the sickest patients in our entire health care system and consume substantial resources with median costs of $25,000 to $30,000 per patient [38] , and costs per quality adjusted life-year ranging from $29,000 to $110,000 depending upon prognostic strata [39] . It is not known whether delirium contributes independently to poor outcomes. We have conducted a delirium investigation in the ICU us- [21] , drug days = number of days that a patient received psychoactive medications designated in Methods b Delirium with onset in the ICU (i.e., \u00aaICU-onset\u00ba delirium), duration measured in days.

The prevalence of delirium in this investigation was four times higher than the control rate of delirium a recently reported cohort of medical patients [1] . The fact that delirium was an independent determinant of length of stay sends an important message to the ICU community that this poorly monitored yet extremely common complication of ICU stay should achieve a high priority for future study. In the ICU setting, as in terminal cancer patients [40] , it will be important to determine if delirium is merely a marker of illness and physical frailty, an avoidable iatrogenic complication, or an independent contributor to poor neurological outcomes and survival. The development of delirium in non-ICU patients has an associated in-hospital mortality of 25\u00b133 % [3, 12, 41, 42] . Francis and Kapoor [34] found that 2-year mortality in patients having experienced delirium was 39 % versus 23 % in controls. In addition, a 3-site epidemiological delirium study showed that delirium was an important independent predictor of the combined outcome of death or nursing home placement [41] .",

While benzodiazepines and narcotics were the most prevalent risk factor in this cohort (administered to 98 % of patients), numerous other risk factors must be considered, as we found that their use explained only 29 % (i.e., r 2 = 0.29) of the variation in duration of delirium. In fact, the mean number of risk factors per patient was 11. Clinical prediction rules have repeatedly shown that it is possible to stratify patients into risk groups depending upon the number of risk factors present [2, 14, 25, 43] . Patients with three or more of these risk factors have been considered \u00aahigh risk\u00ba for delirium [2, 14, 40, 43] , and in ICU patients, this magnitude of risk is nearly universal. In practical terms, the risk factors for delirium can be divided into three categories [2, 3, 14, 15, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27] : 1) the acute illness itself; 2) host factors including age or chronic health problems; and 3) iatrogenic or environmental factors. Modifications of risk factors in the ICU such as the use of psychoactive drugs, maintenance of sleep/wake cycles, attempts at prevention of malnutrition, optimization of the use of restraints, and adjustments in care to account for visual or hearing impairment could help improve the incidence and/or duration of delirium [1] .",

These subtypes of delirium are classified by psychomotor activity as either hypoactive, hyperactive, or mixed [53, 54] . When patients are allowed to emerge from the effects of sedation, they may do so peacefully or in a combative manner. On one extreme are the \u00aapeaceful\u00ba patients, who are often assumed erroneously to be thinking clearly. These patients with hypoactive or quiet delirium represented 94 % of all episodes of delirium in our investigation. This subtype is manifested as decreased mental activity and inattention, and is frequently overlooked by physicians and nurses [12, 27, 35] . Many clinicians expect delirium to present with agitation or hallucinations, features that are not required for the diagnosis. Failing to recognize deficits in cognitive function places these fragile patients at risk for aspiration and reintubation [55, 56, 57] . When patients are in a combative state, they are usually referred to as having \u00aaintensive care syndrome\u00ba or \u00aaICU psychosis,\u00ba which is the hyperactive subtype of delirium [4, 5, 53, 58] . These terms may be a potentially dangerous misnomer, because they imply that increased psychomotor activity and hallucinations are an expected outcome in the ICU [4, 5, 26, 53, 58, 59] . In this cohort, hyperactive delirium was present in only 6 % of the episodes of delirium.",

            "text": "This investigation has several limitations. Most importantly, the size and the duration of follow-up should be extended in future cohorts to better determine the role of delirium on mortality. In addition, future studies of larger cohorts including more elderly ICU patients with diverse causes of respiratory failure should assess neuropsychological function beyond the ICU stay in order to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for persistent deficits. Recent data on long-term outcomes after the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) demonstrated impaired neuropsychological function in 78 % of patients at one-year follow-up [60] . We did not find an association between delirium and impaired quality of life in our study, yet this may represent another limitation of either the size of the study or the quality of life instruments chosen. For example, the MRF-28 has not been used previously in an ICU cohort (it was chosen because it has both disease-specific questions for respiratory patients as well as those related to cognitive impairment). Recently, data has begun to emerge regarding quality of life measures following ICU care [61, 62, 63] , including the role of sedatives and neuromuscular blocking agents in psychiatric disorders after ICU care [64] , but no data are available for delirium. Our risk factor analysis, while thorough in comparison to previous ICU delirium studies, lacked sleep monitoring and employed simple methods to track psychoactive drug use. Future studies should track both of these risk factors in a more detail. While this investigation did not find a striking correlation between age and delirium, the cohort contained a relatively young population and the study was not powered to evaluate this relationship. Lastly, sepsis itself should be tracked as an independent risk factor for delirium in ICU cohorts, considering the aforementioned entity of septic \u00aaencephalopathy,\u00ba which often includes delirium.",

In order to identify all cases cognitive impairment, we have adopted the following measures: 1) the above DSM criteria and mental status definitions will be consistently employed; 2) a geriatric psychiatrist's evaluation will be conducted to determine which of these criteria are met by the patient. This will involve a bedside evaluation and screening for cognitive and attention deficits; 3) lastly, interviewing the family and nurse who provide the majority of patient care will establish baseline functioning and identify fluctuations [33] .",

Over 80 % (n = 39) of patients developed delirium during their hospital stay, with the majority of cases (29 of 39, or 74 % of all delirium) occurring initially in the ICU with an average time of onset between the second and third day. Five patients (10 %) remained comatose throughout the study and were not classified as delirious. The mean duration of delirium was 3.4 1.9 days, with a range of 1\u00b18 days. In this investigation, there were 131 patient days in which active delirium was present (excluding comatose days), and a simultaneously performed rating by the geriatric or psychiatric expert revealed that this delirium was \u00aahypoactive or quiet\u00ba delirium in 123 (94 %) of cases and hyperactive or agitated delirium in eight (6 %) of cases.Over one-fourth of the survivors (11 of 42, 26 %) were delirious within 24 h of hospital discharge. Of 42 patients surviving to hospital discharge, 31 completed the discharge evaluation that included the Folstein MMSE, depression scale, and quality-of-life evaluations. Although application of sensitive baseline criteria identified only 11(22 %)  with possible dementia at entry, 18 of 31 (58 %) patients had MMSE scores below 24 at hospital discharge (< 24 is the standard cut-off to indicate significant deficits by MMSE). Of these 18, 13 (72.2 %) were not delirious at discharge. Of the 11 judged \u00aapossibly mildly demented\u00ba at baseline, only two had MMSE on discharge below 24, leaving 16 cognitively impaired patients who had no baseline indication of dementia. The mean Geriatric Depression Scale score of 13.1 7.8 was above the usual cutoff to indicate depression, and 15 of 31 (48 %) patients had scores of 11 or higher. The quality-of-life instruments used (SF-12 and MRF-28) are summarized inTable 3.
