The threat of a new pandemic persists as novel avian influenza A strains continue to emerge with the ability to induce high mortality (but, to date, limited transmissibility) in humans. These antigenically distinct influenza viruses are categorized, based on phylogenetic characterization and sequence homology of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene, into clades. In the United States, a key component of pandemic preparedness is the National Prepandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile [1] , which currently contains 4 H5N1 avian influenza strain vaccines ( 1/2005) . The rationale behind the stockpile is that a vaccine made from pre-pandemic subtype virus would provide partial cross-protection through immunologic priming [2] , thereby benefiting first responders and other high-risk or priority groups before a better-matched vaccine against the pandemic strain becomes available. Because vaccines comprising H5N1 and other avian pandemic strains have had poor immunogenicity in unprimed populations [3, 4] , 2 immune-enhancing adjuvants have been included in the stockpile (AS03 and MF59). The AS03 adjuvant is a proprietary oil-inwater emulsion product, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, which has been in advanced clinical development for use with a number of seasonal, 2009 pandemic A(H1N1), and pandemicpotential avian influenza (eg, H5N1 and H7N9) virus vaccines. Nonetheless, the optimal strategy for use of pandemic vaccine with adjuvants is incompletely elucidated.",

Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrollment. Eligible persons were healthy men and nonpregnant women aged 18-49 years who were screened for the absence of chronic illnesses and had an erythrocyte sedimentation rate <30 mm/ hour. (Enrollment criteria are described in NCT01317758 and the Supplementary Material.) Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either adjuvanted or unadjuvanted vaccine, then randomized into 1 of 3 groups (1:1:1) to receive 2 intramuscular doses of vaccine, spaced 21 days apart, at 3.75, 7.5, or 15 \u00b5g of HA. Dilution of vaccine and mixture with adjuvant, when indicated, was performed by an unblinded pharmacist and administered by an unblinded vaccinator, neither of whom were involved in clinical evaluations. Subjects were observed for 20 minutes after each vaccination to detect adverse events (AEs). For the next 8 days, they recorded a daily oral temperature and the occurrence of injection site (pain, tenderness, erythema, and induration) and systemic reactions (feverishness, chills, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, and nausea). Interim AEs were collected 2 days after each vaccination by telephone and on days 8, 29, and 42 at the clinic. On days 81, 141, 201, and 386, subjects were interviewed to capture serious AEs (SAEs) and new-onset chronic medical conditions. Clinical safety hematology and chemistry laboratory values were collected before and 8 days after each vaccination. Subjects graded the severity of their symptoms as mild (no interference with normal activities), moderate (some interference with normal activities), or severe ( prevented normal activities). Clinical signs and abnormal laboratory values were graded using predefined criteria. Serum was collected on days 0 ( prevaccination), 8, 21 (before second vaccination), 29, and 42 for assessment of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralization (MN) antibody responses.",

This is approximately 12 times the dose of each HA antigen contained in seasonal influenza vaccines and would have limited utility in a pandemic setting where vaccine quantities are limited and mass vaccination of large populations is required. Aluminum salt-based adjuvants combined with H5 vaccines afforded little if any enhancement of the immune response [7] [8] [9] . These disappointing results prompted a search for novel adjuvants and delivery systems. A major advance was the finding that 2 doses of an H5N1 influenza vaccine containing AS03 with as little as 3.8 \u00b5g of HA antigen elicited HAI antibody responses \u22651:40 to a homologous A/Vietnam/1194/2004 [10] clade 1 virus and an A/Indonesia/ 05/2005 clade 2.1 virus [11] in at least 80% of adults.

This strategy was intended to provide proprietary adjuvants quickly and for use in combination with pandemic antigens produced by other manufacturers [13] . Our findings strongly support that stockpiled AS03 adjuvant combined with candidate pandemic vaccines are highly immunogenic. Within 8 days after the second dose (day 29), >90% of subjects achieved seroprotective antibody levels. Although a single dose of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine elicited seroprotective responses in only one-third of subjects, mathematical models predict a significant reduction in attack rates even with low-efficacy pandemic vaccines [14] .

In addition, only 3.75 \u00b5g of HA per dose was sufficient to achieve this benchmark, allowing the National Stockpile to have 24 times more doses available than if 90-\u00b5g doses were required. Peak antibody titers were observed as early as 8 days following the second dose of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine. This rapid (anamnestic) response to the second dose is likely the result of robust immunologic priming elicited by the first dose, leading to the speculation that the immunization schedule resulted in the induction of strong immunologic memory, a correlate of enduring protection [16, 17] . Immunologic measurements 6 and 12 months after the second vaccination will be performed to test this hypothesis. Moreover, we hypothesize that T-cell priming that may occur even in the absence of serological responses is capable of limiting viral replication and thereby ameliorate disease severity, viral shedding, and presumably transmission [18] .",

However, the results between the HAI and MN assays did not always closely correlate. The MN assay is generally a substantially more sensitive means of detecting antibodies to H5N1 viruses [23] . On the other hand, the MN assay has not been internationally standardized and surrogate endpoints that correlate with protection have not yet been defined [24] . According to amino acid sequence analysis of the HA region of our selected H5N1 viruses, the results of the MN assay more closely resembled the antigenic distance predicted; the relationship is: A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (closest to the reference), then A/Vietnam/1203/2004, then A/Anhui/ 1/2005, and lastly A/Hubei/1/2010 (the most antigenically distant strain).",

We are mindful that concerns about increased adverse effects with the use of AS03, real or perceived, could impact public acceptability of vaccination, especially when public perception of disease risk is low.",

Antibody responses to the drifted strains (A/Vietnam/1203/ 2004, A/Anhui/2005, A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005, and A/Hubei/ 1/2010) were lower than to the homologous vaccine strain (SupplementaryTable 3). Antibody responses following 2 doses of nonadjuvanted vaccine were poor: \u22648% and \u226413% achieved an HAI or MN titer of \u22651:40 at day 42. The antibody responses following a single dose of any AS03-adjuvanted vaccine dosages were also poor: \u226415% and \u226432% achieved an HAI or MN titer of \u22651:40 at day 21. In contrast, the antibody responses following2 doses of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine were relatively robust for A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 and A/Anhui/1/2005, although less robust for A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and A/Hubei/1/2010. The GMT of antibody induced by 2 doses of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine varied according to the heterologous antigens tested (Figure 3). In both HAI and MN assays, GMTs of antibody recognizing A/Anhui/2005 and A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 appeared more vigorous than those recognizing A/Vietnam/ 1203/2004 and A/Hubei/1/2010. The correlation (by Pearson coefficient) between HAI and MN antibody levels was good for A/Anhui/2005 (P = .82) and A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005 (P = .85), but lower for A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (P = .58) and A/Hubei/1/2010 (P = .64).",
