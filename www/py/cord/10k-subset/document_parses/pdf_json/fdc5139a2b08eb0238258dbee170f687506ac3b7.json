All H275Y mutants, except for the L7 clone, had additional common mutations at V80M and S82P, which were parsimony-informative sites ( Table 2 ), suggesting that V80M and S82P might be important for the microevolution of oseltamivir-resistant virus. From the tree, the H275Y mutant was predicted to be derived from an oseltamivir-sensitive L2 clone, because the L2 clone was most closely related to the H275Y mutant and had common mutations at V80M and S82P. The L1 clone, in addition, was located to the center of all oseltamivir-sensitive clones. The L2 clone was supposed to be derived from L1, which is most similar to the putative origin of the Eurasian avian-like swine strain of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009. The oseltamivir-resistant clone L7 was located in the same clade including oseltamivirsensitive clones L6, L7, L8, L9, and L10 (Fig. 2) , indicating that the L7 clone was originally derived from this oseltamivir-sensitive clade.

Clone 33 was also located between the L1 and L2 clones of case 1. We further compared the proportions of nonsynonymous substitution (dN) and synonymous substitution (dS) of all clones (Fig. 4) . The proportion of dS of clones from left lung (case 1) was higher than that of other clones, which was ascribed to the tendency of the small dN/dS value of the left lung clones. The ratio of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN) and synonymous substitutions (dS) indicates positive selection (dN/dS [1) or purifying (stabilizing) selection (dN/dS \\1). The dN/dS ratio of left lung clones (0.31 in Fig. 4 ) was the lowest in case 1, suggesting purifying selection preferentially contributed to the intrahost variation of left lung clones.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 985, "end": 988, "text": "[1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 282, "end": 289, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 485, "end": 493, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 680, "end": 688, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1083, "end": 1089, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Intrahost variation of oseltamivir-sensitive virus in other cases"}, {"text": "Oseltamivir is a first-line treatment of patients infected with pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus, and the majority of 2009 H1N1 viruses remain susceptible to oseltamivir, although oseltamivir-resistant strains have been sporadically reported [3] . In this study, we first detected the H275Y mutation in the right lung but not in the left lung. There are few reports of the uneven distribution of oseltamivir-sensitive and oseltamivir-resistant viruses in a single patient [8] . Further analysis of intrahost variation of the virus in the left lung demonstrated that a part of the population was H275Y mutant and was predicted to be derived from oseltamivirsensitive clone L1 (Fig. 2) , which might be a descendant of Considering the route of virus spread from upper respiratory tract to lower respiratory tract, it is likely that the H275Y mutant is generated primarily in the nasopharynx, then spreads to the right and left lungs. In a study of other patients (cases 2-4), all intrahost species were oseltamivir sensitive, possibly because oseltamivir was administered briefly (case 2) or not administered at all (cases 3 and 4). Minimum spanning trees of all clones in this study determined clone 33, from the case 4 clones, as the core of oseltamivir-sensitive clones, indicating an origin of all intrahost species of oseltamivir-sensitive clones (Fig. 3) . Interestingly, the oseltamivir-sensitive L1 clone of case 1 was also closely located to clone 33 and had common parsimony-informative amino acids (Table 2) , which would predict a high degree of relatedness. In addition, clone 33 was most closely related to the putative origin of 2009 H1N1, European avian-like swineA/swine/Belgium/ WVL1/1979. The dN/dS ratio of left lung clones from case 1 was smallest (Fig. 4) . We also found a further decrease of the ratio of the oseltamivir-sensitive clone (dN/dS = 0.27), which was half of the population in the left lung, indicating comparatively strong purifying selection occurred in the left lung [9] . It might be speculated that the oseltamivirsensitive clone of the left lung is in a stable phase of evolution [9] . It is likely that case 1 might have been infected primarily with the oseltamivir-sensitive virus and that long-term administration of oseltamivir seems to have induced the generation of the H275Y mutant. Unfortunately, specimens were not available at the early phase of oseltamivir therapy, and we could not determine when the H275Y mutant was generated during therapy. Taken together, we supposed that the patient was infected with the L1 lineage first, which then spread to right and left lungs; it mutated independently in the left lung to L4-L10 strains but died out in the right lung (Fig. 2) . In the nasopharynx, major clones having 80M, 82P, and 275Y appeared at about day 13 and spread to the right and left lungs at a later stage (Table 2) . Thereafter, a small number of sensitive strains persisted stubbornly in the left lung although oseltamivir had been administered. It is still unclear, however, why the oseltamivir-sensitive clone still constituted half the total clones in the left lung despite the long-term administration of oseltamivir (21 days).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 234, "end": 237, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 464, "end": 467, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1996, "end": 1999, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2112, "end": 2115, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 667, "end": 675, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1342, "end": 1350, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1499, "end": 1508, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1759, "end": 1767, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2707, "end": 2715, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2858, "end": 2867, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In summary, our study highlights the generation and intrahost variation of oseltamivir-resistant 2009 H1N1 virus under long-term oseltamivir therapy.
