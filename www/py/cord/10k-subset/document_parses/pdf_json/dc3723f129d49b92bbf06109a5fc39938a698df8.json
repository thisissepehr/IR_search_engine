Apart from the physical damage, evaporation of the surface and the underlying tissue or possible infections of the lung by various pathogens are the biggest problems. To prevent these complications, the surface of the lung alveoli is covered by a complex mixture of lipids and proteins with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) as the major lipid component [1] . This mixture, called pulmonary surfactant, is essential for the normal respiratory mechanism. Complications within this mechanism cause severe diseases like the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2] or even complete respiratory failure [3, 4] . Surfactant proteins (SP) considerably influence characteristics and stability of this lipid system. Accordingly, the extensive investigation of SPs is of great interest to develop new therapies against diseases or aftercare medication for operation or transplantation patients of respiratory medicine. Four SPs are known so far, which differ significantly in their characteristics. Surfactant proteins A and D are members of the C-type lectin family, which show immunological properties [5, 6] . SP-A and SP-D can interact with carbohydrates on the surface of different bacteria, protozoans, fungi, and viruses which leads to an accelerated immune defense and opsonization [7, 8] . In contrast to that, the small and very hydrophobic proteins SP-B and SP-C are essential for the stability of lipid monolayers at air-fluid interfaces [9] [10] [11] . They can control the surface tension and fluidity of the layer and regulate the insertion of new lipids into an existing system. To achieve their full functionality, these proteins are modified highly posttranslationally [12, 13] and are able to interact with other surfactant proteins. For example, protein cooperation was demonstrated for SP-A and SP-B [14] . All four proteins were initially identified within pulmonary surfactant, but recently, they were also detected on the eye surface and in different tissues of the ocular system [15, 16] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 478, "end": 481, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 688, "end": 691, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 729, "end": 732, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 733, "end": 735, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1225, "end": 1228, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1229, "end": 1231, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1411, "end": 1414, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1415, "end": 1417, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1574, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1575, "end": 1579, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1580, "end": 1584, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1808, "end": 1812, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1813, "end": 1816, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1942, "end": 1946, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2125, "end": 2129, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2130, "end": 2133, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "By means of whole genome sequencing and bioinformatic sequence analysis, two additional potential SPs named SP-G [17] and SP-H [18] could be identified. Their amino acid sequences have an identity of 23 % and can be found in the UniProt database (accession codes Q6UW10 and P0C7M3) [19] . Their length of 78 amino acids for SP-G and 94 amino acids for SP-H is too short to show any similarity to the group of huge and hydrophilic SPs (SP-A, SP-D). Their sequence length indicates that SP-G and SP-H belong to the SP group of small and hydrophobic proteins (SP-B, SP-C), but they do not share any domains with the members of this group and the sequence identities are very low (about 10 %). Unfortunately, there was no further information about these proteins available prior to the presented studies. Their 3D structure was not known, no characterization of the proteins was done and their detailed localization or function was still completely undiscovered. With these few facts about the proteins, choosing the right experimental work for their further characterization is very difficult. Fortunately, computational chemistry methods like 3D structure modeling or molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can help out in those situations. There are many studies reported in the literature where modeling and MD simulations led to new insights which could promote research and gave valuable suggestions for further experimental studies. MD simulations showed the detailed interaction of SP-B with different lipid species [20, 21] and demonstrated the orientation of SP-B in the vicinity of a lipid layer [22, 23] . For SP-C, the stability of the protein fold was shown [24] and an important role for the formation of bilayer reservoirs [25] was verified in silico. Furthermore, the cooperation of SP-B and SP-C in an MD simulation caused an increased fluidity of a membrane system [26] and was crucial for the preservation and formation of a stable lipid layer system on air-fluid surfaces [26, 27] . As a prerequisite for these protein-lipid simulations, the possibility to reproduce a protein-free monolayer system consisting of lung surfactant lipids in an MD simulation was also described in the literature [28] . Finally, the immunological activity of SP-D was also demonstrated by simulation studies investigating the binding affinity of different sugar moieties, including glycans presented on the surface of the influenza A virus [29, 30] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 113, "end": 117, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 127, "end": 131, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 282, "end": 286, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1517, "end": 1521, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1522, "end": 1525, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1600, "end": 1604, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1605, "end": 1608, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1665, "end": 1669, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1732, "end": 1736, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1877, "end": 1881, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1986, "end": 1990, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1991, "end": 1994, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2207, "end": 2211, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2434, "end": 2438, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2439, "end": 2442, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The aim of this work was the investigation of the novel and putative surfactant proteins SP-G and SP-H with computational chemistry methods to get first insights into their character and function.

This computationally expensive method was able to produce protein structure models for SP-G and SP-H with promising overall quality. The stereochemical quality was evaluated by PROCHECK [34] after minor model optimizations with YASARA [35, 36] . PROSA II [37] was used to determine the quality of the entire protein fold based on the statistical analysis of well resolved protein X-ray structures. Furthermore, the model quality was assessed with ERRAT [38] and PROQ [39] . To check the stability of the protein models, 20 ns MD simulations were performed with YASARA and the YASARA2 force field [36] . For the simulation, each protein model was placed separately in a water box with a physiological NaCl concentration of 0.9 %. The final models were deposited at the Protein Model DataBase PMDB [40] for public download and received the PMDB id PM0078341 for SP-G and PM0079092 for SP-H. Additionally, these final models for SP-G and SP-H were extended by posttranslational modifications (PTMs), which were predicted by sequence-based prediction tools.

DPPC is the most abundant lipid in the pulmonary surfactant [48, 49] and for MD simulations described in the literature, DPPC-only lipid layers are often used to investigate different aspects of lung surfactant research [26, [50] [51] [52] . All simulations in this work were carried out with the GROMACS package version 4.5.4 [53, 54] and the united-atom G53a6 force field [55] . The standard parameter set of the force field for DPPC was slightly modified after Kukol [56] to produce a reliable lipid system. The initial bilayer consisting of 128 DPPC molecules per layer was built with the CELLmicrocosmos MembraneEditor 2.2 [57] . The bilayer was placed in the center of a simulation box and solvated with water (Fig. 1a) . A simulation of 75 ns length indicated that the chosen lipid parameters and simulation settings are able to reproduce a stable lipid bilayer system. The MD simulation was performed with the Nos\u00e9-Hoover thermostat [58, 59] at 323 K and the Parrinello-Rahman barostat [60, 61] with semi-isotropic coupling and a reference pressure of 1 bar. The LINCS constraint algorithm [62, 63] was used to fix the stretching of all bonds, allowing a time step of 4 fs. Electrostatic interactions were calculated with the particle mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm [64, 65] as implemented in GROMACS with a cutoff at 1.2 nm, the van der Waals potential was switched off between 1.2 and 1.3 nm. The neighbor list was updated every five steps, energy and pressure dispersion correction was applied. The last 25 ns of the simulation were used to calculate area and volume per lipid, lateral diffusion coefficient and area compressibility. In order to estimate the simulation quality, these values were compared to literature data (area and volume per lipid [66] , lateral diffusion coefficient [67] , and area compressibility [66, 68] ). The last snapshot of this 75 ns MD simulation was used to build the DPPC monolayer system. The membrane layer with the lipids 1-128 was rotated by 180 degrees so that the polar lipid head groups were facing each other. Afterward, the layers were separated from each other generating space between the lipid head groups. Two systems were generated, one with lipid layers approx. 6.5 nm apart (hereafter referred to as \"small system\") and one with approx. 9.5 nm space between the DPPC layers (hereafter referred to as \"big system\"). Both systems were placed in a simulation box with the lipid layers parallel to the x-y-plane. The z dimension of the box was set big enough to generate a 4-5 nm vacuum phase between the hydrophobic lipid tails due to the applied periodic boundary conditions. The space between the lipid head groups was filled with water molecules. A 25 ns MD simulation was performed to equilibrate the monolayer systems and check their stability. The compressibility of the systems in z direction was set to zero for these simulations to preserve the vacuum layer between the lipid tails. Apart from that, the simulation settings were identical to the bilayer calculations. The resulting monolayer systems were used to build the initial protein-lipid simulation layouts by placing the protein models in the water phase between the lipid head groups (Fig. 1b) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 172, "end": 176, "text": "[48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 177, "end": 180, "text": "49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 332, "end": 336, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 337, "end": 341, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 342, "end": 346, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 347, "end": 351, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 439, "end": 443, "text": "[53,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 444, "end": 447, "text": "54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 486, "end": 490, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 582, "end": 586, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 740, "end": 744, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1053, "end": 1057, "text": "[58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1058, "end": 1061, "text": "59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1110, "text": "[60,", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1111, "end": 1114, "text": "61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1210, "end": 1214, "text": "[62,", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1215, "end": 1218, "text": "63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1382, "end": 1386, "text": "[64,", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1387, "end": 1390, "text": "65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1871, "end": 1875, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1908, "end": 1912, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1940, "end": 1944, "text": "[66,", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1945, "end": 1948, "text": "68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 828, "end": 837, "text": "(Fig. 1a)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3318, "end": 3327, "text": "(Fig. 1b)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "DPPC simulation system setup"}, {"text": "All four protein models (SP-G and SP-H without and with PTMs, respectively) were equilibrated by a 20 ns MD simulation in a water box with the G53a6 force field [55] . For this purpose, the force field was further modified with parameters for the attached PTM residues, namely phosphorylated serine, threonine and tyrosine, palmitoylated cysteine, serine or threonine residues that are O-glycosylated with GlcNAc or GalNAc and N-glycosylated asparagine. The N-glycosylation residue consists of a pentasaccaride core with two GlcNAc and three mannose Fig. 1 Representation of the simulation box layout for (a) the equilibration of a DPPC bilayer in water and (b) the protein-lipid simulations with two DPPC monolayers, which enclose a water phase with the protein model.

The protein backbone is shown in ribbon representation moieties (\u2212GlcNAc-GlcNAc-mannose-(mannose) 2 ). The parameters for these residues were taken from original building blocks of the G53a6 force field (for example glucose or mannose building block) and combined with standard amino acid building blocks to describe the whole modified residue. Missing values for the connection between those parts were complemented manually with parameter sets also available from the original force field. A derivation of novel force field parameters was not necessary. In the case of the phosphorylated amino acids, parameters were taken from the G43a1p force field [69] . The equilibrated protein models were placed in arbitrary orientations in the water phase between the DPPC monolayers. This resulted in six different starting orientations per model, each system containing only one copy of the respective protein model. From these six starting orientations per model, four systems were built based on the \"small system\" and two were based on the \"big system\". As a special feature, in one starting structure based on the \"small system\" for each modified protein, the model was manually positioned in a way that the palmitoylated cysteine residues are interacting with the lipid layer. That is, for the SP-G model with PTMs the palmitoyl moiety of Cys76 is in contact with the DPPC 1-128 layer and the palmitoylated Cys45 and Cys56 are already interacting with the DPPC 129-256 layer for the modified SP-H model at simulation start. Hydrogens were added to all structures according to pH 7 with an automated routine implemented in YASARA [70] . All 24 starting orientations (simulation systems) were neutralized with counter ions (Na + /Cl \u2212 ) and submitted to a 250 ps equilibration run with NVT ensemble and the Berendsen thermostat at 323 K, followed by a 250 ps equilibration run with NPT ensemble and the Berendsen thermostat at 323 K and barostat at 1 bar.

Sequence-based prediction tools indicated numerous phosphorylations, glycosylations, and palmitoylations for SP-G and SP-H, which were manually added to the protein models and did not influence the overall model stability in MD simulations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "Previous attempts to obtain specific antibodies for SP-G and SP-H failed due to the lack of knowledge about the three-dimensional protein structure. The models obtained in this work revealed sequence parts on the surface of the proteins without any PTM, which are suitable antigens for the production of specific antibodies. In this way, the computational modeling significantly promoted experimental work, because the antibodies allowed the first localization of SP-G and SP-H in different cell tissues where other SPs are also present. Furthermore, they could be used in first functional studies [31, 32] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 598, "end": 602, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 603, "end": 606, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "To mimic the basic properties of the pulmonary surfactant, a simulation system containing a DPPC lipid monolayer was established. This system was used to study the characteristics of the SP-G and SP-H model without and with PTMs in their natural environment in 24 MD simulations over a time of 50 ns each. Although the strength of the interactions and contact areas on the protein surface were dependent on the starting structure and attached PTMs, all performed simulations indicated a high potential of SP-G and SP-H to interact with a lipid system. Furthermore, the calculation results suggest that position and conformation of PTMs could be responsible for an amphiphilic character of both proteins, as described for the already known surfactant proteins. The high theoretical lipid interaction potential determined by the presented simulations could be used to support and discuss the outcome of experimental characterization and localization studies [31,
