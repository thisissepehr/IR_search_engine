Early diagnosis of VAP is important to provide appropriate treatment and reduce mortality. Developing a noninvasive and highly accurate diagnostic method is important. The invention of electronic sensors has been applied to analyze the volatile organic compounds in breath to detect VAP using a machine learning technique. However, the process of building an algorithm is usually unclear and prevents physicians from applying the artificial intelligence technique in clinical practice. Clear processes of model building and assessing accuracy are warranted. The objective of this study was to develop a breath test for VAP with a standardized protocol for a machine learning technique. Methods: We conducted a case-control study. This study enrolled subjects in an intensive care unit of a hospital in southern Taiwan from February 2017 to June 2019. We recruited patients with VAP as the case group and ventilated patients without pneumonia as the control group. We collected exhaled breath and analyzed the electric resistance changes of 32 sensor arrays of an electronic nose. We split the data into a set for training algorithms and a set for testing. We applied eight machine learning algorithms to build prediction models, improving model performance and providing an estimated diagnostic accuracy. Results: A total of 33 cases and 26 controls were used in the final analysis. Using eight machine learning algorithms, the mean accuracy in the testing set was 0.81 \u00b1 0.04, the sensitivity was 0.79 \u00b1 0.08, the specificity was 0.83 \u00b1 0.00, the positive predictive value was 0.85 \u00b1 0.02, the negative predictive value was 0.77 \u00b1 0.06, and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curves was 0.85 \u00b1 0.04. The mean kappa value in the testing set was 0.62 \u00b1 0.08, which suggested good agreement. Conclusions: There was good accuracy in detecting VAP by sensor array and machine learning techniques.

According to the US National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system, one-third of all nosocomial infections in ICUs are pneumonia; of these, 83% are associated with mechanical ventilation [2] . Common pathogens of VAP include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii [3] . Patients who acquire VAP have poorer outcomes, higher mortality rates, and longer lengths of hospital stay than uninfected patients [4] . Delays in the initiation of appropriate antibiotic treatment for VAP significantly increase mortality [5] . Patients with suspected VAP should undergo a serial evaluation that includes chest X-ray, sputum Gram stain, sputum cultures, and blood cultures. The sputum Gram stain is not reliable for the early application of antibiotic therapy. Sputum culture requires a long culture duration, and the results might not correlate well with the real causative pathogen [6] . Mechanically ventilated (MV) patients usually empirically receive broad-spectrum antibiotics to control a suspected infection at the earliest time, which may result in the development of resistance [7] . Early diagnosis for VAP is important to provide appropriate treatment and reduce mortality. However, current culture-based microbiological diagnosis is inadequate for the timely prescription of targeted antibiotics. The development of a rapid test to diagnose VAP is therefore important to solve these problems [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 149, "end": 152, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 345, "end": 348, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 526, "end": 529, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 664, "end": 667, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 772, "end": 775, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1134, "end": 1137, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1338, "end": 1341, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1655, "end": 1658, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Many bacterial species can produce volatile metabolites via catabolic pathways, including glycolysis, proteolysis, and lipolysis [9] .

It is difficult to qualitatively and quantitatively measure all the VOCs by GC-MS because most of the compounds are still unknown. To discriminate the VOCs associated with diseases, there is increasing interest in using an electronic nose to address the problem [14] . An electronic nose uses sensor responses to measure VOCs. During the measurements, the VOCs attach to the sensor polymer surface to induce swelling of the polymer film. The swelling increases the electrical resistance of the composite, which generates an electrical signal. The sensor array response data are subsequently used as predictors to create a diagnostic classification algorithm [16] . Artificial intelligence (AI) has been gradually used in medicine to assist physicians in making clinical diagnoses [17] . Machine learning technology is commonly used in the analysis of sensor response data because an electronic nose is a composite of a sensor array and functionally resembles biological olfactory receptors by pattern recognition.

Applying machine learning techniques in medicine is a positive development. However, many defects restrict the future development of AI in medicine. First, few studies report the procedures of model selection and data processing, which makes the statistical analysis look like a \"black box.\" In this study, we report the procedures of model selection and data processing to enhance the transparency of the study. Second, from an epidemiological point of view, many AI researchers in medicine lack the concept of epidemiological study design and do not report the essential items for reporting diagnostic accuracy. In this study, we followed the standards for reporting of diagnostic accuracy studies (STARD) guidelines to enhance the quality of the research [38] . Third, many machine learning studies reported only the best accuracy value without showing details for readers to evaluate the reliability of test results. In this study, we carefully selected machine learning algorithms that are suitable for the learning task for classification. Because the relationships of sensor response variables were initially unclear, this study also used eight types of machine learning to provide a reliable estimation of the accuracy with the mean value. We found that the data of sensor arrays might be susceptible to multicollinearity for the high correlation between sensor responses, and the neural network had poor performance in this situation. Classification trees might be resistant to highly correlated sensor responses. Finally, AUC is an important index for the evaluation of diagnostic accuracy. However, one of the major practical drawbacks of the AUC as an index of diagnostic performance is that it summarizes the entire ROC curve, including regions that frequently are not relevant to practical applications (e.g., regions with low levels of specificity). In this study, we also applied a pAUC to prevent the statistical uncertainty of the estimation [39] . The results of the obtained accuracy reported in this study are therefore conservative but more reliable than AUC results for clinical physicians to judge the new AI technique. From the technical point of view, we suggest that researchers not show only the best results with the highest accuracy; instead, a study should clearly explain all the procedures and conservatively estimate the accuracy for physicians in making clinical decisions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 908, "end": 912, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2110, "end": 2114, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In vitro studies have reported that an electronic nose was able to detect Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in bacterial cultures [40] [41] [42] . In human studies, van Geffena et al. reported that the electronic nose could discriminate bacterial and viral infections in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbations [43] . A study used an electronic nose to detect pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with prolonged chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and reported an accuracy of 90.9% [44] . In ventilated patients, Hockstein et al. used an electronic nose to diagnose VAP and showed a correlation between the electronic The area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for ventilator-associated pneumonia in the training set, testing set, and full data set. High AUCs in the three sets show high diagnostic accuracy Fig. 3 The partial area under the receiver operating curve (pAUC). The blue area corresponds to the pAUC region between 80 and 100% for specificity (SP), and the green area corresponds to the pAUC region between 80 and 100% for sensitivity (SE). The corrected pAUCs are printed in the middle of the plot predictive value, or Kappa values [47] . In fact, in inhospital patients, especially in the ICU, most of the bacterial cultures report many bacteria, and one single bacteria is not common. Therefore, the selection of patients may introduce selection bias that makes it difficult to generalize the research results in clinical practice. For critical patients in the ICU, physicians' primary concern is whether frail patients have bacterial pneumonia, and then they can empirically prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics on time. Our study did not attempt to detect one single bacteria and therefore prevented misclassification bias from selecting study subjects. From the medical point of view, we suggest that future medical AI researchers must know the need in clinical practice, and then the research can truly promote the application of AI in clinical application.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 265, "end": 269, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 270, "end": 274, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 275, "end": 279, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 483, "end": 487, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 650, "end": 654, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1321, "end": 1325, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 983, "end": 989, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the breath study of ICU patients, we must consider the influence of multiple comorbidities that may decrease discrimination ability. Many diseases, such as diabetes, acute renal failure, and acute hepatitis, may influence breath metabolites [48] [49] [50] . Moreover, many subjects had coinfection at other sites, such as the urinary tract and skin. Multiple infectious diseases with coexisting varied pathogens might also decrease the discrimination ability. To prevent confounding results, we suggest that further studies should consider more restrictive exclusion criteria and controls individually matched by age (+/\u2212 5 years) and gender. Owing to a limited number of subjects, we did not conduct an independent external validation test. The results must be interpreted carefully. We suggest enrolling more study subjects in different hospitals to validate the results before clinical use. Some AI researchers may use an independent dataset from another group of subjects to assess the accuracy in the external validation [26] . However, in fundamental knowledge of epidemiology, we know that the prevalence of the disease in the training set and testing sets will influence the accuracy of a diagnostic test. A higher prevalence of the disease in testing subjects will have a higher positive predictive value [51] . Therefore, most studies have used a ratio of 1:1 in the number of cases and controls to obtain the most optimized results, in which the prevalence of the disease is 50%. However, in clinical practice, especially for screening purposes in a community, the majority of subjects are healthy, and the prevalence of disease is low. For this reason, Leopold et al. reviewed the performance of an electronic nose during external validation. The results showed that better performance of the external validation set was always observed when subjects included in the external validation set were derived from the same population or hospitals as the training set; however, decreased performance of the external validation set was observed when the study Fig. 4 The area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for ventilator-associated pneumonia in the testing set, with the 95% confidence interval. We used the random forest algorithm to establish the prediction model and then tested the prediction accuracy on the training set. Using bootstrap resampling for 2000 replicates, the 95% confidence intervals are shown as gray areas around the mean bootstrapped curve subjects included in the external validation set were enrolled from other hospitals [52] . Therefore, researchers should know the limitation of external validation. A prediction model established from hospital patients might not be suitable for community screening.
