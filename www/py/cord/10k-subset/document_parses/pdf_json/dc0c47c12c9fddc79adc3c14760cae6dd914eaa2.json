Investments in agriculture, such as the use of hybrids, agroforestry systems, or fertilizers, have been effective in reducing poverty in developing countries (Sachs 2005) , notably in Africa, where a 10% increase in agricultural yield reduced the percentage of people living on $1 per day by 9% (Irz et al. 2001) . Applying ecological knowledge to the relationship between biodiversity and productivity, species interactions, soil fertility, pollination, and pest and disease control can greatly increase productivity in poor areas, while conserving the resource base upon which agriculture depends. Community ecology has demonstrated that increases in biodiversity can lead to increases in plant community productivity when species complement each other, or use resources differently. For example, planting species from different functional groups together, as in the Meso-American \"three sisters\" combination of corn (a grass), beans (a nitrogen-fixing legume), and squash (a low-lying creeper), maximizes trait differences and resource use efficiency between species (Risch and Hansen 1982) .",

When leguminous trees are interplanted with maize, the two species have temporally segregated light requirements, since the shrubs are coppiced during the corn's growing season, but capture light after the corn is harvested. The coppiced material from the legumes adds 50-200 kg N ha -1 year -1 , depending on species and management. Spatially segregated populations can also be complementary. For example, Tithonia diversifolia, a wild sunflower species, is used to \"mine\" phosphorus from off-site hedgerows and roadsides (Cong and Merckx 2005) . Pruned Tithonia leaves are then mulched into fields, providing an affordable and readily available phosphorus fertilizer.",

Studies on planteating aphids have shown that aphid populations are 18% greater when ground-dwelling aphid predators are experimentally removed, 70% greater when flying predators and parasitoids are removed, and 172% greater when all enemy groups are removed (Schmidt et al. 2003) . Islands of red clover have 19-60% fewer cases of herbivore parasitism compared to non-isolated communities, indicating that lack of habitat connectivity releases insects from predator control (Kruess and Tscharntke 2002) . Semi-natural habitats adjacent to agricultural zones enjoy lower disturbance levels and therefore support larger predator and parasite populations (Thies and Tscharntke 1999) . However, maintenance of semi-natural landscapes must be based on an understanding of the ecology of beneficial species. For example, a study of bumblebee densities showed that densities were positively correlated to availability of mass flowering crops rather than to the proportion of semi-natural habitats in landscapes (Westphal et al. 2003) . Future research needs to be focused on how landscape configuration, complexity, and quality of semi-natural habitat affect agricultural productivity.",

Constructed wetlands treat wastewater at a cost of US$170-410 per m 3 day -1 compared to US$800-1000 per m 3 day -1 for engineered wastewater treatment systems (Blanco et al. 2006) . It is important to remember that these prices are estimations based on case studies from the US.

A pilot project in Santa Maria Navitas, in arid central Mexico, used a constructed wetland consisting of native plants to treat contaminated water used for crop irrigation. The wetland reduced total suspended solids by 96%, chemical oxygen demand by 85%, and total nitrogen concentrations by 62% (Belmont et al. 2004) . Other project benefits included the opportunity to grow ornamental flowers for sale and the production of biomass for composting.

(2004) found that deforestation, forest fragmentation, and road building increase the incidence of leishmaniasis and malaria. Similarly, irrigation projects, population migrations, increased livestock production, and introduction of invasive species have been tied to outbreaks of malaria, Nipah virus, and schistosomiasis in the developing world (Patz et al. 2004) . Through the spatial integration of biogeochemical data, remotely sensed vegetation classes, and mosquito abundance data, Pope et al. (2005) linked phosphorous runoff from agricultural fields in Belize to increased abundance of cattails (Typha domingensis) in adjacent marshes. The increase in cattails may have heightened malaria risk by creating mosquito habitat close to areas of human residency. This kind of spatial understanding of disease risk could be used to inform strategic landscape planning that incorporates water and nutrient management as well as using natural barriers to reduce disease transmission. The emerging field of conservation medicine, which focuses on the intersection of the environment, ecology of human and non-human hosts, pathogens, and conservation biology, aims to reduce the spread of emerging infectious diseases. A conservation medicine approach revealed the spillover of the SARS virus from bats to civets to humans and helped identify potential control points in the transmission pathway (Dobson 2005) . Conservation medicine encourages the pursuit of health and conservation goals in tandem, improving human welfare through greater conservation of ecosystem services and species protection. With humans increasingly encroaching into natural areas, and the heightened potential for rapid disease transmission through global travel, research in this field is directly related to improving human well-being and conserving biodiversity.",

Newer initiatives encourage farmers to diversify and plant a mixture of multi-purpose trees (fuel, food, fodder, and medicine) in multi-strata agroforestry systems (ICRAF 2005) . This \"mixed-portfolio\" approach to agroforestry exploits the functional traits of complementary species, such as sprouting ability, nitrogen fixation, and timing of fruit production to maximize the services provided by woodlots. Benefits include fuelwood production (using the stems of coppiced trees) close to households, improved food security and nutrition, the potential for income generation and diversification through the production of goods for sale, increased soil fertility (more soil nitrogen using the leafy material from coppiced trees and from planting nitrogen-fixing species), decreased soil erosion (through the presence of tree roots and soil cover), watershed protection, biological carbon sequestration, preservation of species and genetic diversity, greater landscape diversity, and decreased pressure on surrounding forests (Leakey 2001) . Hedgerows in small landholder farming communities in western Kenya contain a substantial proportion of landscape-level native plant species diversity, and contribute to the functional complexity of landscapes, even where human population densities are high (Backes 2001) . These more diverse agroforestry systems may be more stable, productive, and able to support a greater number of species that are important to agricultural production (such as pollinators and pest-regulating species).",

Other methods to restore forest cover and diversity include: active reforestation with a high diversity ensemble of native species, high density plantings to outcompete exotic species or competitive grasses, multiple waves of native species plantings to mimic succession and enrichment plantings of late successional, dispersal-limited species (eg large-fruited species; Lamb et al. 2005) . These reforestation methods draw on studies of natural forest succession and knowledge of species traits, regeneration mechanisms, and propagation methods to accelerate successional processes. Reforestation of degraded lands may be an important source for community fuelwood, but careful management is needed to designate where, how much, what size, and what species can be collected to prevent depletion over time.",

Identification of habitat degradation thresholds at which human security is threatened could help guide the limits of resource use in hazardprone areas and help prevent such disasters.

However, empirical studies of large, infrequent disturbances (LIDs) are rare because of the unpredictable nature of these events (Turner and Dale 1998). As a result, LIDs are rarely addressed in manage-ment plans, even though the severity of their impacts can occasionally be mitigated by management. Most of the discussion of LID management is in the context of sparsely populated areas; as a result, there is a paucity of knowledge on how LIDs affect human-dominated ecosystems.

This is also important to development practitioners who seek to \"scale up\" successful pilot projects. To make ecological findings relevant within the development and poverty reduction agenda, ecologists need to present their findings at spatial and temporal scales of importance to human well-being and at which political decisions are made. This may require Figure 4 . A hotel outside of the Yala National Park in Sri Lanka that was completely exposed to the ocean and experienced the full force of the 2005 tsunami, resulting in extensive destruction of the hotel structures and high mortality rates. A few kilometers away, on the same coastline, another hotel had conserved an extensive sand dune system, which absorbed much of the force of the tsunami and protected the hotel structures and occupants (JCI and CMR pers observ).",

            "text": "Social scientists have long recognized that poverty is a complex phenomenon, involving components such as income, health, education, and vulnerability, all interacting across spatial and temporal scales (Agrawal and Redford 2006) . Similarly, ecologists work in multidimensional systems, composed of organisms, energy, and the physical environment interacting at various spatial and temporal scales, which can be described in terms of composition, structure, functions, fluxes, resilience, or other dynamics (Pickett and Cadenasso 2002) . Successful implementation of environmental interventions to reduce poverty will require recognition of the complexities inherent in issues of poverty and the environment and the existence of trade-offs, synergies, and interactions operating among the different components. Historically, most development interventions have not been multisectoral in scope. Infrastructure development and macroeconomic reforms such as market liberalization usually addressed only certain aspects of poverty and often had major, unintended effects on other development goals. For instance, efforts to boost agricultural productivity through irrigation canal construction unintentionally increased malaria incidence by increasing the amount of standing water present (Patz et al. 2004 ). More recent development initiatives, particularly the UK's Sustainable Livelihoods program, are more multisectoral and strive to maximize the benefits of multiple poverty reducing interventions by recognizing trade-offs where they exist while minimizing unintended adverse effects. This approach has also been adopted by the Millennium Villages Project, in which 12 village clusters in each of Africa's agroecological zones will be the site of simultaneous and integrated investments in agriculture, health, education, environment, and infrastructure, to end extreme poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals (Sachs 2005) . These village-level interventions are science-based, shaped by local community input, and are rigorously monitored to assess the progress, cost, and efficacy of interventions. This approach differs from many other development projects by simultaneously addressing the multiple facets of poverty through the joint work of community leaders and multidisciplinary teams of specialists.",

Rigorous development experiments with appropriate controls, measurable outcomes, long-term monitoring, and the use of statistical tools should include the input of ecologists and other researchers. This scientific approach would provide a more detailed understanding of the effects of develop-ment interventions, highlight important contextual factors, determine the long-term sustainability of such initiatives, and facilitate the scaling-up of effective interventions (Agrawal and Redford 2006) .",
