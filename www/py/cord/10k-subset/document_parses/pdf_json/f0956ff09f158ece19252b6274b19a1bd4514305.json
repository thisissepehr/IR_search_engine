Mice were bred as the genetically heterogeneous progeny of a cross between CB6F1 mothers and C3D2F1 fathers. Half of the mice were fed ad libitum (AL group), and the other half were subjected to 60% calorie restriction (CR group). Each mouse was tested at about 9 months of age using age-sensitive tests of immune status, and then again at about 12 months of age using age-sensitive tests of muscle function. The data were then analyzed using the method of partial least squares to determine the combinations of test weights that maximize the covariance of the weighted sum of immune measures with the weighted sum of muscle function measures. Both AL and CR mice exhibited a statistically significant relation between the immune status tests and the muscle function tests. Maximal covariance was obtained with a set of weighting coefficients consistent with our working hypothesis: mice with high levels ofCD4 memory T cells (which increase with age) also had relatively low levels of muscle strength and endurance. Low strength was associated with low CD8 cells in the AL mice, with high numbers ofCD8 memory cells in the CR mice and with low CD3 cells in both diet groups. The partial least squares method generates composite indices of immune status and muscle function that can be evaluated as biomarkers of aging rate in these mice.

Mice, dogs, and human beings are presumed to age at different rates, because the signs of aging -biochemical and cellular changes, physiological declines, and exponential increases in the probability of disease -are typically seen in 2-year-old mice, 10-year-old dogs, and 70-year-old human beings. Despite the clear differences in aging rate across species, whether members of a given species age at different rates is not clear. Some authors argue plausibly that each individual will show an idiosyncratic pattern of physiological changes as he or she grows older, influenced by a unique combination of genetic susceptibilities, environmental influences, and stochastic events (Adelman, 1987; Costa and McCrae, 1995) . According to this view it is not possible to assign a single \"biological age\" to any individual, because any two individuals will differ in a multitude of age-sensitive traits.

In this model age-sensitive traits are influenced both by the aging process and also by factors, including genetic predispositions and environmental variations, that may be unrelated to aging.

When anesthetized, the mice were placed on a plexiglass platform of a \"shoe\" apparatus (Ashton- Miller et al., 1992) . The left knee was secured to the platform and the foot was attached to the shoe with a Velcro strap. The shoe was mounted on the shaft of a servomotor. A microcomputer controlled the servomotor for rotations of the ankle joint that permitted adjustments in muscle length. Strain gauges mounted on the shaft of the servomotor monitored the torque produced by the dorsiflexor muscle group. Needle electrodes were placed adjacent to the peroneal nerve, and the dorsiflexor muscles were stimulated maximally with the dorsiflexor muscle group adjusted to optimal length for force development (L o ). The maximum isometric tetanic force (F o ) was then determined from the plateau of the frequency-force curve.

In the current case there are two such blocks, one consisting of immune status variables obtained from 9month-old mice, and the other consisting of muscle function tests performed on the same set of mice at 12 months of age. The analysis begins with a matrix of ordinary correlation coefficients, each of which summarizes the correlation between one of the immune measures and one of the muscle measures. The goal of the analysis is to generate two sets of weighting factors -one for muscle tests and one for immune tests -that summarize the muscle and immune data in a useful way. Specifically, the weights are chosen in such a way that the weighted sum of the immune outcomes, for a given mouse, has maximum covariance with the weighted sum of the muscle outcomes. The weighted sum of these values is referred to as a latent variable: in the current case one latent variable is a composite summary of immune status, and another latent variable is a composite summary of muscle function. The individual weighting factors are referred to as saliences. Specific immune tests that have high salience receive highest weights -positive or negative -in the computation of the immune latent variable. The set of weights can then be used to calculate, for each individual mouse, a composite immune latent variable and a composite muscle latent variable. The covariance relationship between the immune latent variable and the muscle latent variable can be tested for statistical significance to see if the pattern is likely to represent chance alone.

In each case there is a clear relationship between the immune and muscle latent variables. The covariances are .78 and 1.14, respectively, for the AL and CR groups. These covariance values are somewhat less than the singular values because missing values have been substituted by means in the computation of scores for each mouse. The correlation coefficients are r = .45 for the AL mice, and r = .51 for the CR mice. The correlation coefficient for the AL mice is only slightly above the highest of the individual AL correlation coefficient, and the CR correlation is slightly worse than the highest of the individual CR values. This should not be thought of as \"little gain\" (as in multiple regression approaches), since the subject of discussion is not optimization of the correlation but instead the discovery of patterns in the correlation structure as a whole. The scatterplot for the AL mice (Figure 1, Left) shows that the relation between the two latent variables is well summarized by the correlation coefficient. For the CR mice (Figure 1, Right) , there is one joint outlier, and the correlation coefficient of .51 is thus an overestimate; the correlation coefficient for the data with the outlier omitted (.40) provides a better summary of the CR data set as a whole. DISCUSSION Our working model involves three linked suppositions. First, we hypothesize that there is a physical process, of unknown nature, that influences the rate of change in a wide range of traits that change in adults as they grow older. We further propose that the rate of this process differs among members of a species. Lastly, we postulate that the effects of these differences in rate of aging are strong enough that they can be detected despite the confounding effects of other causes of individual variation.

In a canonical correlations analysis of highly correlated blocks like these, variables measuring \"the same thing\" will be assigned coefficients that vary wildly in value and perhaps even in sign; we can learn little about actual explanatory power from such coefficients. Furthermore, the analysis depends on the structure of the within-block correlation matrices, which is not the case for PLS. Nor would it be appropriate to pool all 12 of these variables in one single factor analysis and then interpret the patterns of loadings on the components that emerge.

The computations of PLS are not far from those of structural-equations analysis of the same data sets when the SEM models are constrained to ignore withinblock factor structure and to estimate by least squares rather than maximum likelihood. The PLS approach is preferable to SEM mainly because PLS supplies the explicit latent variable scores that enter into scatterplots such as Figure 1 and because PLS allows us to test the dependence of these scores on age at death. The PLS analysis does not attempt to predict longevity by any measured variable by either simple or multiple regression.

We note also that an environmental effect, calorie restriction, can retard a panoply of age-sensitive phenotypes (Weindruch and Walford, 1988) . Nonetheless, the single process model is deservedly controversial, and testing it is a central focus of the current study. The model predicts, among other things, that individuals whose aging rate is high compared to others in the population will have relatively extreme phenotypes in many agesensitive traits, including tests of systems for which other sources of linked change seem unlikely. Thus, for example, it seems unlikely, based on present knowledge of pathophysiology, that muscle weakness will lead to alterations in CD4 memory T-cell numbers, and equally unlikely that alterations in T-cell subsets will lead to diminutions in muscle strength or endurance. Thus, evidence to suggest correlated variation in age-sensitive measures of muscle and immune status, such as we present in Table 3 and Figure 1 , is most parsimoniously explained by a model in which variations in both muscle and immune status are regulated by a third factor, hypothetically the aging rate. We can also predict that other age-sensitive traits, such as collagen cross-linking, protein oxidation levels, and measures of function in other physiologic systems, will prove to covary with the immune and muscle assays that are salient in the current data set.

In statistical terms, the life span measurements contain only a very few bits of information (in the limit, one bit: alive or dead), and are thus in principle less well suited to quantitative analysis than indices that integrate a wide range of age-sensitive measurements.
