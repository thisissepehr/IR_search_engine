Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with different environmental influences or certain genetic conditions, and can be artificially induced by inhibitors acting at different steps of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). We found that a short-term (5 h) inhibition of ETC complex III with myxothiazol results in the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 and upregulation of mRNA for the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and several ATF4-regulated genes. The changes are characteristic for the adaptive integrated stress response (ISR), which is known to be triggered by unfolded proteins, nutrient and metabolic deficiency, and mitochondrial dysfunctions. However, after a prolonged incubation with myxothiazol (13-17 h), levels of ATF4 mRNA and ATF4-regulated transcripts were found substantially suppressed. The suppression was dependent on the p53 response, which is triggered by the impairment of the complex III-dependent de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines by mitochondrial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The initial adaptive induction of ATF4/ISR acted to promote viability of cells by attenuating apoptosis. In contrast, the induction of p53 upon a sustained inhibition of ETC complex III produced a pro-apoptotic effect, which was additionally stimulated by the p53-mediated abrogation of the pro-survival activities of the ISR. Interestingly, a sustained inhibition of ETC complex I by piericidine did not induce the p53 response and stably maintained the pro-survival activation of ATF4/ISR. We conclude that a downregulation of mitochondrial ETC generally induces adaptive prosurvival responses, which are specifically abrogated by the suicidal p53 response triggered by the genetic risks of the pyrimidine nucleotide deficiency.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Mutations in the mitochondrial genome or in the nuclear genes related to mitochondrial functions are associated with a wide set of mitochondrial diseases that share some common changes in transcriptome. 1, 2 In particular, there are evidences for common induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR)-or the integrated stress response (ISR)-associated genes, including activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and its target genes, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and asparagine synthetase (ASNS). 2, 3 Mitochondrial dysfunction induced by an inhibition of mitochondrial electron transfer chain (ETC) complex I with rotenone was also shown to induce the expression of the UPR/ISR genes ATF4 and CHOP. 4 Environmental stresses induce rapid changes in gene expression that eventually alleviate cell damage and return cells to homeostasis. Different environmental stresses induce the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 at Ser 51 by protein kinases PERK (ER stress), GCN2 (nutrient depletion), PKR (viral infection) or HRI (heme deprivation), resulting in the global repression of protein biosynthesis 5 that promotes viability of cells during mitochondrial dysfunction. 6 In addition to the global attenuation of translation, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation leads to an increased translation of mRNAs with small upstream open reading frames, including the transcription factor ATF4. 5 ATF4 is a transcriptional activator of the genes involved in nutrient uptake, metabolism, redox regulation and apoptosis.

As the inhibition of complex III induces activation of p53 because of the impairment of pyrimidine biosynthesis, 8 we tested whether a replenishment of pyrimidine nucleotide pools abrogates the myxothiazol-induced inhibition of ATF4 expression.
