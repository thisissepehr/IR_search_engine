Here, we sought to clarify the pathophysiology of early deterioration in asthmatic patients after A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. Cytokine levels and virus titres in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mice with and without asthma after A(H1N1)pdm09 or seasonal H1N1 infection were examined. In asthma/A(H1N1)pdm09 mice, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels peaked at 3 days post-infection and were higher than those in all other groups. IFN-\u03b3 levels in asthma/A(H1N1)pdm09 mice at 3 days post-infection were higher than in all other mice at any time point, whereas at 7 days post-infection, the levels were lowest in asthma/A(H1N1)pdm09 mice. Virus titres in asthma/A(H1N1) pdm09 mice were highest at 3 days post-infection, and decreased by 7 days post-infection, although the levels at this time point were still higher than that in any other group. Histopathological examination showed more inflammatory cell infiltration and lung tissue destruction in the asthma/A(H1N1)pdm09 group than in any other group.",

Although the clinical manifestations of A(H1N1)pdm09 and seasonal H1N1 infections were similar 2 , many severe and fatal cases of A(H1N1)pdm09 occurred not only in patients with underlying diseases but also in healthy children and young adults 3, 4 . Some reports have shown that bronchial asthma was one of the most common underlying conditions in patients hospitalized with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection 5, 6 . Additionally, it has been reported that children with asthma showed increased susceptibility to A(H1N1)pdm09 viral infection 7 , and Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 2 Scientific RepoRTS | 7: 9128 |",

However, severe respiratory issues, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), have been reported in children and young adults with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection 5, [8] [9] [10] . Bronchial asthma increases the risk of hospital and intensive care admission in infants and children [3] [4] [5] [6] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . We previously reported that A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, but not seasonal H1N1 infection, induces severe pulmonary inflammation in a mouse model of asthma 7 days after infection 14, 15 . However, we observed that the duration of the latent period for A(H1N1)pdm09 infection is shorter than 7 days, and patients present earlier progression of pulmonary disease and systemic conditions after infection. Since exacerbation was frequently observed in asthmatic patients after viral infection, we suspect that a cytokine storm, including inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6 and tumour necrosis factor [TNF]-\u03b1), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), anti-viral cytokines (interferon [IFN]-\u03b3), and helper T (Th) 2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13), may occur in the lung following A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. However, little is known about the early host response against A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in patients with underlying bronchial asthma.",

The pulmonary cytokine storm at 3 days post-infection in asthma/A(H1N1)pdm09 mice may mirror the rapid exacerbation observed in asthmatic patients 13 . In contrast, the delayed peak in IL-10 levels and insufficient surge of IFN-\u03b3 levels in A(H1N1)pdm09 mice at 7 days post-infection could lead to ineffective exclusion of the viruses. The early potent inflammation associated with high viral loads in the lungs of asthmatic/A(H1N1)pdm09 mice may corroborate the rapid progression of asthmatic patients during outbreaks of pandemic virus infection. Because the dynamics of IL-1\u03b2 was different from those of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels, IL-1\u03b2 may play other roles after influenza virus infection. In addition, the IL-13 levels were increased in only the asthma/A(H1N1)pdm09 group after the infection. IL-13 may be involved in pathophysiology of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in asthmatic children. Although IL-2, IL-4, and IL-17A may be involved in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma and influenza infection, they were undetectable in the BAL fluid from mice in this study. This may be explained by the cytokines' short half-lives and/or limited roles in this microenvironment.",

            "text": "These results demonstrated that pulmonary inflammation in asthmatic mice is induced beginning in the early phase of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, which mirrors the finding that A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in asthmatic children induces severe pulmonary complications, including pneumonia, atelectasis, etc., after a shorter incubation period than with seasonal virus infection. After A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, the viral loads in BAL fluid from asthmatic mice were higher than those from control mice, which was not typically observed after seasonal infection (Fig. 3) . Immunostaining of the virus showed many InfA-NP-positive cells in the lungs of asthmatic/A(H1N1) pdm09 and control/A(H1N1)pdm09 mice since early phase after viral infection, but not in the lungs of mice from seasonal H1N1 groups, as shown in Fig. 5 . Previous reports demonstrated that A(H1N1)pdm09 viral proteins were detected in damaged type II pneumocytes, epithelial cells, and infiltrated macrophages in the lung by immunohistochemistry [16] [17] [18] . In addition, at autopsy after A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, acute diffuse alveolar damage was observed 19 . Avian influenza viruses preferentially bind to SA\u03b12-3 Gal, which is expressed on distal bronchioles and type II pneumocytes in the lower respiratory tract 19 . In contrast, seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses bind to SA\u03b12-6 Gal, which is expressed on epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract. A(H1N1)pdm09 virus binds to both SA\u03b12-6 Gal and SA\u03b12-3Gal 19, 20 . Predominant replication of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in the lower respiratory tract, compared with that of seasonal influenza virus, could explain the distinct viral loads shown in Fig. 3 . These findings suggested that A(H1N1)pdm09 virus may induce severe pneumonia in asthmatic patients, which is much less likely in seasonal influenza-infected asthmatic patients or non-asthmatic patients.

A previous report also showed that IFN-\u03b3 levels in asthmatic mice were lower than those in control mice at 7 days after A(H1N1)pdm09 infection 21 . Virus titres in the asthmatic/A(H1N1)pdm09 group at both 3 and 7 days post-infection were significantly higher than those in control mice, and the titres of asthmatic/A(H1N1)pdm09 mice at 3 days post-infection were the highest among all groups at both 3 and 7 days post-infection. In contrast, the virus titres of the control/seasonal group were significantly lower than those of the asthmatic/seasonal group at both 3 and 7 days post-infection. IFN-\u03b3 levels were reportedly reduced in bronchial asthmatic patients, indicating an alteration in the cytokine milieu, with excess production of Th2 cytokines and decreased production of Th1 cytokines 22, 23 , and it has been reported that bronchial asthma patients show suppressed innate immunity [24] [25] [26] . IFN-\u03b3 is produced by Th1 cells, CD8 + T (cytotoxic T) cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and NKT cells 27, 28 , and in our study, IFN-\u03b3 levels were elevated against the high virus load in the asthmatic/A(H1N1)pdm09 group at 3 days post-infection, but were not sufficiently augmented at 7 days post-infection.

Briefly, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) were maintained at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO 2 chamber under stationary conditions. Each well of a 6-well plate was seeded with 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells and cultured in \u03b1-minimum essential medium (MEM; GIBCO/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/mL penicillin (GIBCO), and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin (GIBCO). After two washes with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; GIBCO/Invitrogen), the cells were maintained in serum-free DMEM at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Then, each well was overlaid with 200 \u03bcL of diluted BAL (10 \u22123 , 10 \u22124 , and 10 \u22125 dilutions) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. After one wash in serum-free DMEM, the cells were overlaid with serum-free DMEM containing 0.8% agarose (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD, USA), 0.1% diethylaminoethyl-Dextran (Sigma-Aldrich), and 7 \u03bcg/mL trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C for 72 h, fixed in 10% formaldehyde (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan), and then stained with 0.037% methylene blue (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.). Each experiment was performed in duplicate.Histological and immunohistochemical examination of the lungs. Lung tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 24 h at room temperature and then embedded in paraffin. Serial sections (3-\u00b5m thick) were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E; Muto Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The distribution of viral antigens was examined by immunological staining with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against InfA-NP, which recognize not only A(H1N1)pdm09 and seasonal H1N1, but also H3N2 influenza 29 . Specific antigen-antibody reactions were visualized by 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride staining with the Envision Rabbit/HRP system (DAKO Cytomation). The stained sections were observed by light microscopy to evaluate the degree of pulmonary inflammation and localization of A(H1N1)pdm09-infected cells.Statistical analysis. The differences between groups were analysed by the Mann-Whitney U test. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses and calculations were performed using SPSS version 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).",
