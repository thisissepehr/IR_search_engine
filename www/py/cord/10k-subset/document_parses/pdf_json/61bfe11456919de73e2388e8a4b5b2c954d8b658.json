Isolated acinar cells were plated onto tissue culture dishes coated with a three-dimensional, reconstituted basement membrane gel. After attachment in Ham's nutrient mixture FI2, the cells were cultured at 35 ~ C in F12 supplemented with 10% heat inactivated rat serum, epidermal growth factor, dexamethasone, insulin, transferrin, selenium, putrescine, reduced glutathione, ascorbate, penicillin, streptomycin, and the appropriate secretagogue. Under these conditions, the cells attached rapidly and DNA synthesis was initiated within 2 to 3 d. Although the cells flattened on the substratum, they continued to maintain their differentiated morphology. The cells contained secretory granules, and the secretory enzymes peroxidase and amylase could be detected. The use of a reconstituted basement membrane gel proved critical for the attachment and growth of exocrine acinar cells.",

Significant outgrowth from clusters of acinar ceils was apparent by Day 3 to 4 (Fig. 7 b) , coinciding with initiation of DNA synthesis. Although these cells were flattened, they still possessed many of the morphologic features of differentiated acinar cells (Figs. 7 c and 8t. They contained abundant secretory granules located in the perinuclear region and arrays of rough endoplasmic reticulum at the cell periphery lFig. 8 a). Junctional complexes typical of epithelial cells were seen between the cytoplasmic processes of many adjacent cells lFig. 8 cL During the first 3 to 4 d, the size of the secretory granules d, ecreased. Although there was variation from cell to cell, the granules remained smaller in the cultured ceils than in vitro. However, by enzyme cytochemistry, the secretory protein peroxidase could still be identified within the granules of parotid and lacrimal acinar ceils (Figs. 8 a and 9}. Biochemically, in the parotid and pancreatic acinar cells, amylase levels were initially high but decreased with time in culture (Fig 10L After 6 to 7 d in culture, cells with reduced numbers of secretory granules appeared. These ceils tended to be more fibroblastic tFig. 1 a) in appearance. When a well-characterized pancreatic acinar cell line, AR42J, was grown on the basement membrane gel, a similar morphology was observed, with less differentiated cells radiating out from clusters of epithelioid cells iFig. 11 b). To date, the cultures have been successfully maintained for up to I mo.",

Only in the presence of fully supplemented medium, as described in Materials and Methods, were the cells able to grow and maintain their differentiation. The results with dexamethasone were somewhat equivocal. Although the cells grew better in the presence of dexamethasone, there was a tendency for them to be less differentiated.

Without attachment to a substratum, the cells could be maintained in culture, but they would not proliferate (39}. In our experiments the basement membrane extract proved to be superior to any other substratum tested. In Logsdon and William's study 132L pancreatic acini attached to type I collagen gels would divide, but the lag time was longer {4 to 5 d} and the levels of digestive enzymes fell to about 4% of control values. In the present study, the pancreatic acinar cells began to divide at 2 to 3 d in culture and pancreatic amylase levels returned to 50% of the control levels by 6 d in culture. However, in the parotid acinar cells, amylase levels remained very. low. Preliminary. experiments in which 3sS-labeled secretory proteins were immunoprecipitated from cultures of both pancreatic and parotid acinar cells indicate that parotid amylase is the only secretory protein to be so affected. No differences between control and cultured cells could be seen for any other secretory proteins from either the pancreas or the parotid. Furthermore, in cells grown on the basement membrane extract, protein synthesis, as judged by 3sS incorporation, fell to 50 to 60% of control by Day 8, whereas [3H]leucine incorporation fell to 16 to 25% of control when pancreatic acini were cultured on type I collagen gels {32~. The ability of various substrata to promote differentiation and growth of epithelial cells in vitro is well documented (5,18,21,27}. Since Ehrmann and Gey's {12~ original studies on the effects of rat-tail collagen in enhancing the growth of cells in vitro, several types of substrata ranging from collagen extracts to extracellular matrix produced in vitro have been tested on a wide variety of cell types. In general, those substrata which most closely resemble the natural substratum of the cells in vivo have been the most successful in inducing proliferation or maintaining differentiated functions in vitro or both. In the exocrine glands in vivo, the basal portion of the acinar cell is in contact with a basement membrane. Of the substrata examined in the present study, only the reconstituted basement membrane gel was able to support both attachment and proliferation. With all other substrata tested either the cells would not attach or only limited growth was observed.",

Finally, the requirement for ascorbic acid seen in this system was most likely related to the cells' need to synthesize collagen (27~ for basement membrane formation. Mammary epithelial ceils cultured on collagen gels in hormonally supplemented medium do synthesize their own substratum (54) . It has not yet been determined if the exocrine acinar cells are synthesizing their own basement membrane in response to the culture conditions, but their requirement for ascorbate would indicate that they are.",
