We wished to determine the potential for pulmonary overexpression of the extracellular isoform of superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) to reduce the severity of endotoxininduced lung injury. Methods: Animals were randomly allocated to undergo intratracheal instillation of (1) surfactant alone (vehicle); (2) adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors containing a null transgene (AAVnull); and (3) adeno-associated virus vectors containing the EC-SOD transgene (AAV-EC-SOD) and endotoxin was subsequently administered intratracheally. Two additional groups were randomized to receive (1) vehicle or (2) AAV-EC-SOD, and to undergo sham (vehicle) injury. The severity of the lung injury was assessed in all animals 24 h later. Results: Endotoxin produced a severe lung injury compared to sham injury. The AAV vector encoding EC-SOD increased lung EC-SOD concentrations, and enhanced the antioxidant capacity of the lung. EC-SOD overexpression decreased the severity of endotoxin-induced ALI, reducing the decrement in systemic oxygenation and lung compliance, decreasing lung permeability and decreasing histologic injury. EC-SOD attenuated pulmonary inflammation, decreased bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophil counts, and reduced interleukin-6 and CINC-1 concentrations. The AAV vector itself did not contribute to inflammation or to lung injury.

Firstly, this study involved the administration of vector prior to the onset of lung injury. In the clinical setting, lung injury is generally well established at presentation. It is not clear what effect EC-SOD overexpression might have if introduced after the onset of lung injury. However, there are certain settings, such as major cardiovascular or intra-abdominal surgery, where an insult, such as the development of endotoxemia, is a frequent, and relatively predictable occurrence [7] . A safe, low toxicity intervention, if proven effective in these settings, might confer substantial clinical benefit. Secondly, intratracheal delivery of transgene following the development of ALI/ARDS may be difficult, particularly where lung units are collapsed or filled with exudate, reducing the therapeutic utility of intrapulmonary delivered therapies. It is reassuring in these studies that endotoxin injury did not adversely affect transgene expression or activity. Lastly, ALI and ARDS generally have time courses significantly longer than the 24 h assessed by this model. Differences between groups that were not apparent at 24 h might be very clear after a number of days.
