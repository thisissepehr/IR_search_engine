That accomplishment revealed only a glimpse of the much broader reality uncovered by Fire and Mello 5 years later when they reported the capability of exogenous doublestranded RNAs to silence genes in a specifi c manner, disclosing the which are perfectly complementary to their target mRNAs is of crucial importance for the induction of RNAi and leads to mRNA degradation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 216, "end": 221, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "While siRNAs are mainly exogenous molecules, miRNAs instead are a class of RNAi inducers which derive from partially complementary double-stranded hairpin precursors of endogenous origin. Once processed, they are small single-stranded RNAs (20-22 nt long) able to modulate posttranscriptional gene silencing through repression, and at times degradation, of specifi c mRNA target molecules [ 10 ] . It has been estimated that miRNA-coding genes represent 1 % of the total gene population, being the biggest class of regulatory molecules. They are present in plants, higher eukaryotes, and in some viruses. miRNAs are often encoded in clusters by genes usually located in introns and, more rarely, in exons of protein-coding genes, as well as in intergenic regions [ 10 ] . RNA polymerases produce primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) from microRNA genes [ 11 -13 ] . pri-miRNAs are approximately >100 nt long and are subsequently processed into ~70-nt precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) by a microprocessor complex comprised of the enzyme Drosha and a subunit DCGR8 [ 14 -16 ] . Pre-miRNAs are then exported into the cytoplasm by the exportin 5 protein [ 17 , 18 ] . From here on, in spite of their originating difference, common features, such as the length of their mature products and their sequence-specifi c inhibitory functions, suggest that siRNA and miRNA have similar processing and common mechanisms. Their double-stranded precursors (shRNAs and pre-miRNAs) are indeed both cleaved by Dicer, a ribonuclease IIItype protein [ 9 , 19 -21 ] , into short 19-21 duplexes having two symmetric nucleotide overhangs at the 3\u2032 end and a 5\u2032 phosphate along with a 3\u2032 hydroxyl group. After cleavage, Dicer, together with protein complexes TRBP and PACT, loads the obtained duplexes into a nuclease-containing multiprotein complex referred to as the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Once the duplex is loaded, the Ago2 protein component of the RISC then cleaves one of the two strands of the duplex, which is thus, by convention, considered the sense \"passenger\" strand. The antisense strand, which remains loaded into the thus activated RISC, is instead called \"guide\" since it acts as an adapter for the complex to mRNA targets and allows it to carry out the RNAi mechanism [ 22 -26 ] . In miRNAs, the strand which most commonly plays the role of the guide is called \"mature miRNA,\" while the other one is called \"miRNA*\" [ 27 ] . Animal 3\u2032 UTR sequences often present miRNA binding sites in multiple copies, while, conversely, most miRNAs in plants, as well as siRNAs, bind their targets in their coding regions with perfect complementarity. Another fundamental difference between miRNAs and siRNAs consists, in fact, in the type of binding, which is considered a key factor in their regulatory function: miRNAs bind their target with partial complementarity, allowing bulges and loops in duplexes. However, a key feature in their target recognition is represented by the perfect base pairing with the target in positions 2-8 of the miRNA guide, which is known as the seed region. The presence of mismatches in the central part of the duplex is usually associated to translational repression, which seems to be the default mechanism of miRNA-mediated RNAi. The cleavage of perfectly paired duplexes, which is the default RNAi mechanism in the case of siRNAs, is instead considered for miR-NAs an additional feature leading to the same effect on the protein level.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 389, "end": 395, "text": "[ 10 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 763, "end": 769, "text": "[ 10 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 855, "end": 865, "text": "[ 11 -13 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1062, "end": 1072, "text": "[ 14 -16 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1149, "end": 1160, "text": "[ 17 , 18 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1529, "end": 1543, "text": "[ 9 , 19 -21 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2275, "end": 2285, "text": "[ 22 -26 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2423, "end": 2429, "text": "[ 27 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The biological role of these molecules is currently being intensively elucidated, and their involvement in fundamental processes, such as apoptosis, metabolism, cell proliferation, and organism development, has been widely demonstrated.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Due to the fast and cost-effective way of disrupting genes' functions provided by RNAi-based gene knockdown techniques, great and rapid progress has been made in recent years, and siRNAs have become a standard tool routinely used in molecular genetics and functional genomics laboratory [ 28 ] .

In the fi rst case, a bulge at positions 9-12 of the binding site was introduced in order to prevent cleavage and degradation of the sponge.

Both CMV and U6 sponges with 4-7 bulged binding sites produced stronger derepressive effects than sponges with two perfect binding sites. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that U6 sponges mainly localized to the nucleus, thus making CMV constructs a better choice. Experiments showed that sponges could selectively inhibit different miRNAs and that a sponge designed for a certain miRNA could also derepress targets of the other miRNAs of the same family.

The prototype decoy consisted of a short hairpin molecule where the loop exposed a binding site for an miRNA (Fig. 2c ) . The length of the stem is critical for the effi cient transport of stem-loop structures into the cytoplasm by Exp-5. Experiments determined that the optimal stem length, associated to higher inhibitory effects, was 18 bp. Indeed, stems longer than 18 bp had a reduced binding affi nity to Exp-5, while longer stems could be easily digested by Dicer in the cytoplasm. Starting from this prototype, the authors investigated several structural modifi cations in order to optimize the inhibitory potency of decoys. Experiments showed that the optimal TuD RNA consisted of a bulged stem-loop structure where both sides of the bulge were miRNA binding sites fl anked by 3-nt linkers and the two stems separated by the bulge were 18 nt and 8 nt long, respectively (Fig. 2d ) . The optimal binding sites had a 4-nt insert between nucleotides 10 and 11, in order to avoid cleavage of the decoy. In a subsequent work, the same authors introduced S-TuD (synthetic TuD), a modifi cation of TuD which consists of two fully 2\u2032-O -methylated RNA strands exposing an miRNA binding site each [ 62 ] . Following the hybridization of the two paired strands, the resultant S-TuD forms a secondary structure which resembles the corresponding TuD RNA molecule (Fig. 2e ) . In this work, the authors found that internal base pairing between the two miRNA binding sites on the two strands of a S-TuD can negatively affect the structural accessibility for the miRNA and reduce the inhibitory effect. In light of this, they refi ned the design rules and suggested that an optimal S-TuD molecule would feature two miRNA binding sites which are perfectly complementary to the target miRNA sequence and which don't form any base pairing regions longer than 9 nt. If this is not possible, the introduction of a single mutation or a 4-nt insertion in the middle region of the binding sites, as for the TuD previously described, is suffi cient in many cases to abolish the base pairing without signifi cantly affecting the affi nity to the target miRNA.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 177, "end": 183, "text": "[ 61 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1383, "end": 1389, "text": "[ 62 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 295, "end": 305, "text": "(Fig. 2c )", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1065, "end": 1075, "text": "(Fig. 2d )", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1546, "end": 1556, "text": "(Fig. 2e )", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Design of Effective miRNA Sponges"}, {"text": "These design rules proposed by Haraguchi et al. are the most sophisticated rules described so far for the design of effective miRNA sponges.
