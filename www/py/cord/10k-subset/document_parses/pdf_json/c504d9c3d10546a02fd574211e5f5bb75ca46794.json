Male Wistar rats were rendered endotoxemic by intra-peritoneal injection of LPS (15 mg/kg body weight). We examined the expression of protein and mRNA and the immunohistochemical localization of PAR isoforms in lung tissues 1, 3, 6, and 10 h after LPS administration. Induction of ALI by LPS was confirmed based on histopathological changes. LPS administration induced significant increases in the expression of PAR isoforms (protein) at the level of transcription in ALI. While the time course of PAR-1 and -2 expressions were different, those of PAR-3 and -4 were almost similar. An immunohistochemical analysis showed localization of PAR isoforms in the vascular endothelium, alveolar epithelium, and alveolar macrophages. However, the cellular distribution patterns of PAR isoforms were different. We conclude that LPS induces increase in protein expression of PAR isoforms at the level of transcription in rats with ALI.

This appears to be the case for PAR-3 and -4 on mouse platelets [25] . Other studies suggest that PAR-3 facilitates activation of PAR-4 in the presence of low thrombin concentration [25, 26] . Some data indicate that PAR-3 is a cofactor for PAR-4 in mouse platelets: the hirudin-like site of PAR-3 binds and concentrates thrombin at the cell surface, and, thereby, promote cleavage of thrombin to PAR-4 [26] . While the pathological significance of these phenomena has not been elucidated, the co-localization and co-expression of PAR3 and -4, as observed in the present study, may indicate a similar cofactor relationship.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 345, "end": 349, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 463, "end": 467, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 468, "end": 471, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 684, "end": 688, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "A recent study provides strong evidence that neutrophil elastase-mediated apoptosis plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of ALI, through the PAR-1dependent pathway [27] .
