The underlying etiology involves bacterial, viral or fungal infection (infection associated HS; IAHS), autoimmune diseases or hematological malignancies. HS is characterized by the proliferation of macrophages in bone marrow (BM). It is believed that T lymphocytes produce excessive amounts of cytokines which activate macrophages. These, in turn, phagocytize hematopoetic cells in BM. Apart from pancytopenia, other organ failure may occur due to hypercytokinemia. Fever, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) usually occur. We report a case of a patient with life-threatening HS.",

Extensive diagnostic effort including BM aspiration, liver biopsy, and immunology did not definitely reveal primary diagnosis. Elevated antibodies against Coxsackie B5 were found. The treatment consisted of broad-spectrum antibiotics and, subsequently, corticosteroids which had only a temporary effect. On day 33, the patient's status deteriorated (fever, coagulation abnormalities, and axillary lymphadenopathy with non-specific histology) and he was admitted to our ICU.",

The further course of the illness was favorable. The patient was successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation and MODS resolved. BM aspiration on day 69 showed a marked decrease of hemophagocytic histiocytes. The patient was discharged home on day 78. During 12 months of follow-up, no relapse occurred, the patient's health status was excellent, and all laboratory tests normalized.",

Bone marrow aspiration with cytology and/or histology performed by an experienced hematopathologist is necessary for correct diagnosis. The cause of HS often remains unknown. We may only speculate that Coxsackie B5 virus infection was the trigger for the development of HS in our patient. Standard treatment of HS (except for a treatment of known underlying disease) has not been established yet, though more or less successful trials with high-dose steroids, IVIg, plasma exchange, cyclosporin A, and etoposide have been published [3, 4] . In our case, it seems that the treatment with IVIg was effective. The patient survived despite a prolonged ICU stay and the development of MODS. This documents the importance of vigorous supportive intensive care in such situations.",
