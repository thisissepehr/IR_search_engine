Various experimental approaches, the complex signaling pathways of mammalian cells, and the use of different species orthologues render it difficult to compare and interpret the published results. Thus, the four human histamine receptor subtypes were analyzed side-by-side in the Sf9 insect cell expression system, using radioligand binding assays as well as functional readouts proximal to the receptor activation event (steady-state GTPase assays and [ 35 S]GTP\u03b3S assays).

Fusion of hH 2 R to the long (Gs\u03b1 L ) or short (Gs\u03b1 S ) splice variant of G\u03b1 s resulted in comparable constitutive hH 2 R activity, although both G protein variants show different GDP affinities. Medicinal chemistry studies revealed profound species differences between hH 1 R/hH 2 R and their guinea pig orthologues gpH 1 R/ gpH 2 R. The causes for these differences were analyzed by molecular modeling in combination with mutational studies. Co-expression of the hH 3 R with G\u03b1 i1 , G\u03b1 i2 , G\u03b1 i3 , and G\u03b1 i/o in Sf9 cells revealed high constitutive activity and comparable interaction efficiency with all G protein isoforms. A comparison of various cations (Li + , Na + , K + ) and anions (Cl \u00c0 , Br \u00c0 , I \u00c0 ) revealed that anions with large radii most efficiently stabilize the inactive hH 3 R state. Potential sodium binding sites in the hH 3 R protein were analyzed by expressing specific hH 3 R mutants in Sf9 cells. In contrast to the hH 3 R, the hH 4 R preferentially couples to co-expressed G\u03b1 i2 in Sf9 cells. Its high constitutive activity is resistant to NaCl or GTP\u03b3S. The hH 4 R shows structural instability and adopts a G proteinindependent high-affinity state. A detailed characterization of affinity and activity of a series of hH 4 R antagonists/inverse agonists allowed first conclusions about structure/activity relationships for inverse agonists at hH 4 R. In summary, the Sf9 cell system permitted a successful side-by-side comparison of all four human histamine receptor subtypes. This chapter summarizes the results of pharmacological as well as medicinal chemistry/molecular modeling approaches and demonstrates that these data are not only important for a deeper understanding of H x R pharmacology, but also have significant implications for the molecular pharmacology of GPCRs in general.

For example, signaling crosstalk between GPCRs has been described for the G\u03b1 i -coupled GABA B R and the G\u03b1 q -coupled mGlu 1A R (Rives et al. 2009 ). Another example is ACKR1 (atypical chemokine receptor 1), which has been shown to functionally antagonize CCR5 by forming ACKR1/CCR5 heterodimers (Chakera et al. 2008) . Second, the presence of other constitutively active receptors may interfere with the analysis of agonist-independent activity of the receptor of interest. For example, the inverse FPR1 agonist cyclosporin H failed to inhibit basal G\u03b1 i protein activity in HL-60 cells, indicating that these cells additionally express other constitutively active receptors different from FPR1 (Wenzel- Seifert and Seifert 1993; . Third, promiscuous G protein coupling of GPCRs in the presence of several G protein subtypes may preclude the analysis of GPCR-G protein selectivity (Woehler and Ponimaskin 2009) . Finally, some GPCRs are only expressed at low levels in mammalian cells, rendering it difficult to obtain a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio in functional and ligand binding assays. As discussed in a comprehensive review article (Schneider and Seifert 2010c) , the problems listed above are effectively addressed by using the Sf9 cell expression system. Sf9 cells are derived from the Sf21 cell line, which had been originally isolated from the pupal ovarian tissue of the American fall army worm (Spodoptera frugiperda). The protein of interest is expressed by infecting Sf9 cells with baculoviruses encoding the corresponding gene. Although Sf9 cells express G\u03b1 i -, G\u03b1 q -, and G\u03b1 s -like proteins, insect cell G\u03b1 i is not activated by mammalian GPCRs. This renders Sf9 cells a functionally \"G\u03b1 i -free\" system and permits the analysis of G\u03b1 i -coupled receptors without the necessity of pertussis toxin (PTX)-mediated GPCR/G\u03b1 i uncoupling. Also, PTX would not be active in Sf9 cells, because it does not enter the cells (Wenzel-Seifert et al. 1998) . By contrast, uncoupling of G\u03b1 i -coupled GPCRs by PTX in mammalian cells is problematic. Despite entering mammalian cells, PTX is not capable of completely inactivating all G\u03b1 i proteins (Wenzel-Seifert and Seifert 1990) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 131, "end": 149, "text": "(Breitwieser 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 150, "end": 170, "text": "Prezeau et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 171, "end": 189, "text": "Gomes et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 321, "end": 339, "text": "(Rives et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 489, "end": 510, "text": "(Chakera et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 898, "end": 923, "text": "Seifert and Seifert 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}, {"start": 1075, "end": 1104, "text": "(Woehler and Ponimaskin 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF154"}, {"start": 1343, "end": 1372, "text": "(Schneider and Seifert 2010c)", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 2138, "end": 2166, "text": "(Wenzel-Seifert et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF145"}, {"start": 2356, "end": 2389, "text": "(Wenzel-Seifert and Seifert 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF142"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Sf9 Cell Expression System"}, {"text": "Moreover, Sf9 cells do not express constitutively active GPCRs and therefore provide a low-background environment for the analysis of agonist-independent receptor activity.

When histamine binds to the hH 4 R, the receptor protein undergoes a conformational change and interacts with an inactive GDP-bound heterotrimeric G protein ( Fig. 2 step 1 ). This induces GDP release and the formation of the so-called ternary complex, which contains agonist, receptor and guanine-nucleotide-free G protein (Fig. 2 GPCR and G protein promotes GTP binding to the G\u03b1-subunit. This weakens the intermolecular interactions in the G protein and in the ternary complex, breaking the complex up into agonist and GPCR as well as G\u03b1-and G\u03b2\u03b3 subunit (Fig. 2, step 3) . After their dissociation from the receptor, the active GTP-loaded G\u03b1 subunit and the G\u03b2\u03b3 part interact with various effector proteins (Fig. 2, step 4) and induce numerous biochemical processes. Such effects include activation (G\u03b1 s ) or inhibition (G\u03b1 i ) of membranous adenylyl cyclase (AC), modulation of ion channel activity (G\u03b2\u03b3, G\u03b1 i ) or stimulation of phospholipase C (PLC) activity followed by intracellular Ca 2+ mobilization (G\u03b2\u03b3, G\u03b1 q ). As long as GTP is bound to G\u03b1, the G\u03b1 and G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits are active. To terminate signaling, the G\u03b1 subunit inactivates itself by its intrinsic GTPase activity, resulting in conversion of the bound GTP to GDP and release of inorganic phosphate (Fig. 2 , step 5). The inactive GDP-bound G\u03b1 subunit re-associates with G\u03b2\u03b3 and becomes available for another cycle (Fig. 2 , step 6).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 31, "end": 44, "text": "(Gilman 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 45, "end": 66, "text": "Oldham and Hamm 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 377, "end": 390, "text": "Fig. 2 step 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 542, "end": 549, "text": "(Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 775, "end": 791, "text": "(Fig. 2, step 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 928, "end": 944, "text": "(Fig. 2, step 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1485, "end": 1492, "text": "(Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1601, "end": 1608, "text": "(Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "The G Protein Cycle"}, {"text": "High affinity radioligand binding with histamine receptors is performed with radiolabeled agonists, e.g. tritiated histamine ([ 3 H]histamine).

Thus, agonistic radioligands preferentially label the G protein-coupled high-affinity receptor population. When two populations of GPCRs with different G protein coupling states occur simultaneously, the saturation or competition curves with agonistic radioligands may become biphasic, which allows the determination of high-affinity and a low-affinity binding constants. This was, e.g., demonstrated for histamine H 2 R (Houston et al. 2002) as well as for the \u03b2 2 -adrenergic receptor (\u03b2 2 AR) or the dopamine D 1 R (Gille and Seifert 2003) .

Moreover, by means of a highly sensitive HPLC-MS/MS-based detection method, histamine was identified in lymph nodes and thymus of C57Bl/6 and Balb/c mice (Zimmermann et al. 2011 ).

Moreover, data from the characterization of ligands in medicinal chemistry projects will only be discussed, when they lead to new insights about structure and conformation of the corresponding receptor. Finally, publications that contain only \"in silico\" results without experimental verification will be omitted, since the purpose of this chapter is specifically the expression and characterization of human histamine receptors in the Sf9 cell system. For detailed information on the analysis of histamine receptor species variations in Sf9 cells or for the characterization of histamine receptor subtypes in cellular systems other than insect cells, the reader is referred to comprehensive review articles Strasser et al. 2013; Panula et al. 2015 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 251, "end": 271, "text": "(Panula et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 428, "end": 451, "text": "(Zimmermann et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF160"}, {"start": 708, "end": 735, "text": "(Schneider et al. 2014a, b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 736, "end": 755, "text": "Panula et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1089, "text": "Panula et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1585, "end": 1607, "text": "(Vorobjev et al. 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF140"}, {"start": 1608, "end": 1627, "text": "Panula et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 2698, "end": 2719, "text": "Strasser et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 2720, "end": 2738, "text": "Panula et al. 2015", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pharmacological Characterization of Human Histamine Receptors in Sf9 Insect Cells"}, {"text": "The Histamine H 1 Receptor 2.1.1 General Information About the Histamine H 1 R The H 1 R is ubiquitously expressed, specifically in lung, CNS, and blood vessels. It preferentially couples to G\u03b1 q/11 proteins, causing PLC and protein kinase C (PKC) activation as well as inositol-1,4-5-trisphosphate (IP 3 ) formation and intracellular Ca 2+ release Panula et al. 2015) . The typical signs of a type I allergic reaction like pruritus, increased vascular permeability, and edema are caused by H 1 R activation. Therefore, administration of H 1 R antagonists (so-called antihistamines) belongs to the most important anti-allergic therapeutic interventions (Simons and Simons 2011) , e.g. for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. The H 1 R is expressed on various types of immune cells, specifically on T cell subsets and dendritic cells and influences T cell polarization . Moreover, as indicated by results from H 1 R-deficient mice, the H 1 R plays a role in various models of inflammatory diseases, e.g. nasal allergy, Th2-driven allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis or experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) ). In the CNS, H 1 R is involved in the regulation of locomotor activity, emotions, cognitive functions, arousal, sleep and circadian rhythm or pain perception (Schneider et al. 2014a ). Moreover, the H 1 R participates in the modulation of energy consumption, food intake, and respiration. H 1 R blockade with antagonists increases susceptibility to seizures (Schneider et al. 2014a ). Sedation, the most important side effect of brainpenetrating first-generation antihistamines, is caused by antagonism at H 1 R in the CNS (Simons and Simons 2011; Neumann et al. 2014) . The human H 1 R (hH 1 R) is endogenously expressed by various human cell lines. HeLa cervix carcinoma cells as well as U373 MG astrocytoma cells are used since more than two decades to study hH 1 R pharmacology and signal transduction ). In the following, the results from the characterization of the human H 1 R in the Sf9 insect cell expression system will be discussed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 349, "end": 368, "text": "Panula et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 653, "end": 677, "text": "(Simons and Simons 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 1270, "end": 1293, "text": "(Schneider et al. 2014a", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 1470, "end": 1493, "text": "(Schneider et al. 2014a", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 1635, "end": 1659, "text": "(Simons and Simons 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 1660, "end": 1680, "text": "Neumann et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "2.1"}, {"text": "The hH 1 R was extensively characterized in Sf9 cells with regard to ligand pharmacology, and activation of G proteins.

An overview of the most important results is provided in Table 1 . Although Sf9 cells contain an endogenous PLC-stimulating G\u03b1 q -like protein (Hepler et al. 1993 ), histamine does not induce a significant rise in steady-state GTPase activity in Sf9 cell membranes expressing the hH 1 R alone (Houston et al. 2002) . Only co-expression of the hH 1 R with the regulators of G protein signaling RGS4 and GAIP (G-alpha-interacting protein, RGS19) unmasks an interaction of hH 1 R with insect cell G\u03b1q, resulting in histamine-induced stimulatory effects of 142% (RGS4) and 126% (GAIP) (Houston et al. 2002) . These results indicate that the intrinsic GTPase activity of Sf9 cell G\u03b1 q is rate-limiting for hH 1 R-mediated G protein activation in Sf9 cell membranes. This is probably due to a low number of G proteins relative to hH 1 R molecules. RGS proteins commonly accelerate the intrinsic GTPase activity of G\u03b1 proteins, which results in a higher turnover and in increased availability of inactive GDP-bound G\u03b1 subunits (Fig. 2) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 425, "end": 444, "text": "(Hepler et al. 1993", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 575, "end": 596, "text": "(Houston et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 863, "end": 884, "text": "(Houston et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 339, "end": 346, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1302, "end": 1310, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Characterization of the hH 1 R in Sf9 Cell Membranes"}, {"text": "Due to its favorable properties, the Sf9 cell hH 1 R/RGS protein co-expression system is routinely used to characterize affinity (radioligand binding), activity (steady-state GTPase assays), and binding mode of hH 1 R ligands in medicinal chemistry projects. This revealed major pharmacological differences between H 1 R species isoforms. Specifically, some agonistic bulky 2-phenylhistamines and histaprodifens exhibited increased efficacy and up to tenfold higher potency at gpH 1 R as compared to hH 1 R . Such differences were also observed for antagonists. Most notably, the potency of several arpromidine-type H 1 R antagonists was up to tenfold higher at gpH 1 R than at hH 1 R . Mutagenesis experiments were performed to elucidate the molecular basis of these pharmacological species differences. Basing on the hypothesis that smaller amino acid substitutions render the gpH 1 R binding pocket more flexible than the corresponding site at the hH 1 R, the amino acids 153 or 433 of the hH 1 R were mutated into \"gpH 1 R direction\" (Phe-153 !

Interestingly, the D2.50N mutant was not completely NaCl-insensitive, which indicates that the interaction between ions and hH 3 R is more complex and cannot be explained by a single interaction site (Schnell and Seifert 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 96, "end": 118, "text": "(Horstman et al. 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 119, "end": 140, "text": "Wittmann et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF153"}, {"start": 505, "end": 531, "text": "(Schnell and Seifert 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 1194, "end": 1220, "text": "(Schnell and Seifert 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 1307, "end": 1333, "text": "Schnell and Seifert (2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 1758, "end": 1784, "text": "(Schnell and Seifert 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Influence of Monovalent Ions on hH 3 R Function"}, {"text": "In contrast to the hH 3 R, the structurally similar hH 4 R (see Sect. 2.4) exhibits completely NaCl-resistant constitutive activity .

The presence of the H 4 R on monocytes is discussed controversially (Damaj et al. 2007; Gschwandtner et al. 2013; Werner et al. 2014) . Data from a comprehensive analysis of hH 4 R expression on various myeloid cell types have been published very recently (Capelo et al. 2016) . H 4 R knockout mouse models suggest that this receptor plays a role in the pathophysiology of itch, experimental asthma and EAE . The H 4 R represents an interesting target for anti-inflammatory drugs. For example, the H 4 R regulates eosinophilic inflammation in a mouse model of ovalbumininduced allergic asthma (Hartwig et al. 2015) . Moreover, the hH 4 R seems to be a key player in pruritus during inflammatory reactions (Bell et al. 2004; Dunford et al. 2007; Rossbach et al. 2011) . However, studies with mouse models should be interpreted with caution, because H 4 R pharmacology strongly differs between various species . For example, the \"prototypical\" hH 4 R antagonist JNJ7777120 (1-[(5-Chloro-1H-indol-2-yl)carbonyl]-4-methylpiperazine) is an inverse agonist at the hH 4 R, but a partial agonist at the rat, mouse, and canine orthologues Strasser et al. 2013 ). Another caveat is H 4 R-induced G proteinindependent \u03b2-arrestin signaling. Although JNJ-7777120 is an inverse H 4 R agonist with regard to G protein activation, it exhibits agonistic effects on H 4 R-dependent \u03b2-arrestin signaling (Rosethorne and Charlton 2011; Seifert et al. 2011; Nijmeijer et al. 2013) . Recently, the H 4 R antagonist JNJ 39758979 ((R)-4-(3-amino-pyrrolidin-1-yl)-6-isopropyl-pyrimidin-2-ylamine) was shown to be safe and efficacious at reducing histamine-induced pruritus in a phase 1 clinical study (Kollmeier et al. 2014 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 257, "end": 278, "text": "(Hofstra et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 279, "end": 297, "text": "Jemima et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 327, "end": 348, "text": "(Gutzmer et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 349, "end": 367, "text": "Damaj et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 368, "end": 387, "text": "B\u00e4umer et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 388, "end": 412, "text": "Gschwandtner et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 477, "end": 496, "text": "(Damaj et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 567, "end": 586, "text": "(Damaj et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 587, "end": 612, "text": "Gschwandtner et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 613, "end": 632, "text": "Werner et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 755, "end": 775, "text": "(Capelo et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1113, "text": "(Hartwig et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1222, "text": "(Bell et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1243, "text": "Dunford et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1244, "end": 1265, "text": "Rossbach et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 1629, "end": 1649, "text": "Strasser et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 1884, "end": 1914, "text": "(Rosethorne and Charlton 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 1915, "end": 1935, "text": "Seifert et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 1936, "end": 1958, "text": "Nijmeijer et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 2175, "end": 2197, "text": "(Kollmeier et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Histamine H 4 Receptor"}, {"text": "The N-terminally FLAG-tagged and C-terminally His-tagged wild-type hH 4 R was co-expressed with G\u03b1i 2 and G\u03b2 1 \u03b3 2 in Sf9 cells.

This strongly indicates that thioperamide is only a partial H 4 R inverse agonist and not, as originally suggested in the literature (Lim et al. 2005) , a full inverse agonist. The Sf9 cell system provides a \"clean\" background devoid of mammalian G\u03b1 i proteins and their cognate GPCRs. Thus, expression of mammalian G proteins without GPCRs in Sf9 cells provides a valid control for baseline G\u03b1 activity and for the maximum possible effect of a full inverse agonist.

Thus, GTP\u03b3S disrupts the G protein cycle, resulting in the accumulation of uncoupled inactive GPCRs with reduced agonist affinity. Surprisingly the hH 4 R shows an active state which is completely independent of G proteins ). This is supported by the following four observations: First, high-affinity [ 3 H]histamine binding (K D and B max ) to membranes expressing hH 4 R, G\u03b1 i2 , and G\u03b2 1 \u03b3 2 was retained in the presence of GTP\u03b3S.

Since G\u03b1 o is the main G protein subtype in the brain, this result suggests that the hH 4 R is not of major importance in the CNS. We have seriously questioned the widespread but largely unfounded notion of functional hH 4 R expression on neurons (Schneider and Seifert 2016) .

The affinity of [ 35 S]GTP\u03b3S to the G\u03b1 subunit (K D value) reflects efficiency of G protein activation. The inverse agonistic character of thioperamide was confirmed in [ 35 S]GTP\u03b3S assays with membranes co-expressing hH 4 R, G\u03b1 i2 and G\u03b2 1 \u03b3 2 .

In fact, hH 4 R-F169V exhibited decreased constitutive activity as compared to wild-type hH 4 R, resulting in an increased agonistic effect of histamine. Moreover, histamine binding affinity as well as the inverse agonistic effect of thioperamide was reduced (Wifling et al. 2015b ). The second key amino acid identified by Wifling et al.

Moreover, both the carbonyl moiety and the indole NH of the ligand establish an interaction with the side chain of the uncharged Glu 5.46 . The indole moiety of the ligand shows a hydrophobic interaction with the indole part of Trp 6.48 ). Trp 6.48 is a key player in the so-called rotamer toggle switch mechanism of receptor activation, which had been previously postulated for the \u03b2 2 AR . The stabilization of Trp 6.48 in its vertical conformation by the indole-derived ligand is a typical feature of the inactive receptor conformation and may explain the inverse agonism of such compounds. The benzimidazole-related structures bind in a similar way, but, in contrast to the indole-derived compounds, they form two tautomers with distinct binding modes Replacement of the R5/R7 hydrogen of the indole derivatives by the more spacefilling chlorine increases H 4 R binding affinity. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that two small binding pockets in the H 4 R protein may be filled by these chlorine residues, which increases the ligand-receptor contact area ). Substitution of R5 by -OCH 3 reduces binding affinity, suggesting that larger substituents may be unfavorable. However, there is no significant correlation between molar volume and affinity of a series of indole compounds, suggesting that the volume of R5 may not be the only descriptor that influences binding affinity . By contrast, the size of R5 correlates excellently with the inverse agonistic efficacy of a subset of eight indole-derived compounds with varying R5 substituents. A calculation of the descriptors logP, molar refractivity, molar volume, polarizability, refraction index and polar surface area revealed that inverse agonistic efficacy solely depended on molar volume, but not on the other factors.

On the one hand, it might be argued that insect cells do not represent physiological conditions as well as primary cells. On the other hand, it is difficult to isolate primary cells in sufficiently high numbers. Moreover, a side-by-side comparison of receptor isoforms or species orthologues in a defined environment is virtually impossible in primary cells. Since cells from different tissues have to be used, cell type-specific properties like crosstalk with other receptors or special features of the signaling pathways can lead to heterogeneous results, even for the same receptor isoform. Also, for some receptors like H 3 R, no suitable primary cell system is available . Thus, for a comparison of the intrinsic properties of GPCR isoforms, e.g. G protein affinity/selectivity or constitutive activity, Sf9 cells represent a superior option. As explained in this chapter, Sf9 cells do not contain background GPCR activity and do not produce endogenous agonists activating mammalian GPCRs. Moreover, Sf9 cells allow the co-expression of defined mammalian G\u03b1 s or G\u03b1 i protein subunits on a \"clean\" signaling background. This was demonstrated by the analysis of the hH 2 R interaction with long and short G\u03b1 s splice variants or by in-depth studies of hH 3 R/hH 4 R G\u03b1 i isoform specificity and ion sensitivity.

Radioactivity-based assays, however, are increasingly hampered by legal overregulation and growing waste disposal costs. In this situation, fluorescence-based GPCR ligand binding and G protein activation assays could represent interesting alternatives. Unfortunately, many histamine receptor ligands are rather small molecules and easily lose binding affinity when coupled to a bulky fluorophore. Nevertheless, some progress has been made during the past years. For example, a cyanine dye-labeled aminopotentidine derivative exhibited nanomolar hH 2 R potency (Xie et al. 2006c) . Moreover, fluorescent pyrylium-or cyanine-labeled dimeric carbamoylguanidines were synthesized, but these compounds failed in binding assays due to intracellular accumulation and the resulting high fluorescence background (Kagermeier et al. 2015) . A high-affinity fluorescent H 1 R antagonist was obtained by labeling mepyramine with a BODIPY (4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene)-derived dye (Rose et al. 2012) . Fluorescent hH 3 R-selective ligands were developed by using the chalcone partial structure (Tomasch et al. 2012 ).

Furthermore, an hH 3 R crystal may lead to the identification of the anion binding sites responsible for the monovalent anion-mediated reduction of constitutive hH 3 R activity (Schnell and Seifert 2010) . Finally, the knowledge of H x R crystal structures could lead to the development of compounds that alter H x R function as allosteric modulators. The concept of GPCR modulation by allosteric ligands is well established, and such ligands have been identified, e.g. for dopamine, muscarinic, adenosine, or chemokine receptors (Christopoulos 2014) .
