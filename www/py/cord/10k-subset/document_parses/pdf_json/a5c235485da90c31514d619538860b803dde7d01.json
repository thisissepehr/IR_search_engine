All scores are proposed for the estimation of survival probability after ECMO treatment for severe adult respiratory distress syndrome. Methods: Data from 51 patients (2008 to 2013) were analyzed in this retrospective single-center study. A calculation of an adapted PRESERVE score, the RESP score as well as the score developed for externally retrieved ECMO patients was performed. Results: Seventy one percent of patients received veno-venous (v-v) and 29% venous-arterial (v-a) ECMO support during the study period. Overall survival at 6 months was 55%, with a 61% survival rate for v-v cannulated patients and a 40% survival rate for v-a cannulated patients.

While the ECMOnet score [7] is more limited to the H1N1 experience, the PRESERVE score [9] and the RESP score [10] are valuable options for risk assessment in patients with severe respiratory failure. Since ECMO therapy is a highly invasive and costly therapy where optimal conditions for patient selection are required, this is an important finding for further improvement in stratification of mortality risk in these patients.
