The final list of opportunistic infections/presentations could constitute a future reference for researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and regulatory authorities dealing with pharmacovigilance issues. The introduction of biologics in the 2000s for the treatment of JIA has dramatically changed the prognosis of children affected by JIA, but has also raised concerns on the possible risk of infections and other safety events in these patients. Despite the widespread use of these drugs, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding the assessment of the long-term safety of the biologics in JIA. In this context, the role of national and international registries becomes an important source of data [39, [45] [46] [47] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 896, "end": 900, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1603, "end": 1607, "text": "[39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1608, "end": 1612, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1613, "end": 1617, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1618, "end": 1622, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The Pharmachild international registry has the advantage of combining information from different countries based on real clinical data. In Pharmachild, infections occurred in about 11% of patients with JIA [39] , and among them, it is of primary importance to identify the opportunistic infections that may impose a serious threat to the immunocompromised child. This is not an easy task, because apparently there is a large gap between what treating pediatric rheumatologists feel can be considered as an OI and what a panel of experts adjudicates as such. While most serious infections also occur in the healthy population, some events are more frequent or severe in case of immunosuppression. Conversely, some infections, such as tuberculosis, more common in immunocompromised children, may affect also the general population, although usually less severely [48] . Considering these difficulties in correctly defining OI, we made an effort to produce a document defining OI specifically in children with JIA on immunosuppression. Something similar was recently developed by a specialized Committee convened in the adult setting to define OI in adults and children with immune-mediated diseases on biologics [32] . With the same approach, our panel of specialists voted, through a three-step Delphi procedure, for a correct definition of definite and probable OI and subsequently produced a list of OI by cross-matching the provisional list produced by consensus with the Pharmachild data. In a first phase of our study, among the Pharmachild patients, a considerable percentage of infections (119/682, 17.4%) was adjudicated as opportunistic. When we matched the provisional list of OI with the patients' clinical information, it became clear that other than events with full agreement between the SAC and the list, which could be considered either \"confirmed OI\" (106/682, 15.5%) or \"non-confirmed OI\" (274/682, 40.2%), there was a considerable number (299/682, 43.8%) of debatable infections due to the specific patient's history and/or the pathogen presentation, and classified as \"possible/patient and/or pathogen-related OI.\" The best example is represented by herpes zoster (Tables 4 and 5 ). Varicella zoster presentation was included among the \"confirmed OI,\" as suggested in the majority of the literature in this issue [49] [50] [51] . However, primary varicella infection, frequently observed in our population (155/682, 22.7%), was included among the \"possible/patient and/or pathogen-related OI\" rather than \"definite OI\" due to the high incidence in healthy non-vaccinated children and its usually non-complicated presentation. This group of patients highlights the difficulties in defining OI in children with JIA on treatment, but also the critical importance of providing a reference document listing those infections that should always be considered as opportunistic in these patients, with possible implications for treatment or prophylaxis. Half of the patients with herpes zoster infections had varicella in their history indicating a possible subsequent reactivation of the virus due to a transient immunosuppressive condition. One patient developed varicella despite vaccination while 2 patients had herpes infection despite previous vaccination, without manifesting primary varicella. This observation may give rise to speculations about a possible increase in zoster infections in JIA population under immunosuppressive therapy through varicella infection as well as herpes zoster reactivation. Limited data are available on vaccinations for other infections such as papillomavirus, which occurred only in 2 patients not previously vaccinated. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to develop further studies focused specifically on this topic, in order to understand if vaccinations may maintain a protective immune status in JIA patients under treatment or not. It would also be interesting to investigate how to identify patients with JIA at risk for developing OI, but this would require further comparative studies on the immune status in JIA patients receiving different immunosuppressive treatments. Per definition, a definite OI can occur in patients without recognized forms of immunosuppression but its presence indicates a potential or likely alteration in host immunity. Therefore, it is worthwhile to consider each OI as relevant and representing a potential risk for the JIA patient's life, thus requiring a prompt treatment. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies indicating who is at major risk of complications due to an opportunistic pathogen among JIA patients on immunosuppressive therapy. The use of an immune screening to help primary care practitioners who may care for, diagnose, and manage infections is already consolidated in clinical practice [45] . In our study, we found no specific level of immunosuppression indicating an increased frequency of infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii, although too little data are available on this issue and further analysis is needed to understand the correlation between immune status and OI in patients with autoimmune diseases. Biologics and methotrexate were often seen at the time of a \"confirmed OI.\" Nevertheless, a comparative study about the role of immunosuppressive drugs would require a larger population and a deeper analysis, which was not the aim of the present manuscript.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 206, "end": 210, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 861, "end": 865, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1210, "end": 1214, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2332, "end": 2336, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2337, "end": 2341, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2342, "end": 2346, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 4816, "end": 4820, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2183, "end": 2198, "text": "(Tables 4 and 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Besides those pathogens confirmed as OI and non-or possible OI by the panel on the basis of the Pharmachild real patients' data, there are also pathogens (e.g., Nocardia) that have been included in the list of definite/possible OI (Table 1) by consensus, although they were not identified in Pharmachild.
