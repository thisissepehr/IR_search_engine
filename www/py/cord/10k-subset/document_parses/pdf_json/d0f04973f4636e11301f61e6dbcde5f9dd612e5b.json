Acute respiratory distress syndrome can occur with several diseases either associated with those causing direct lung injury such as pneumonia, gastric aspiration or toxic inhalation, or indirect injury such as sepsis or severe burn. The heterogeneity of causes and the complexity of clinical histopathological and radiographic manifestations make the study of ARDS pathogenesis and the test of new therapeutics difficult. Indeed, ARDS follows most often a progressive course characterized by two distinct stages. The acute (or exudative) stage includes the disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier, pulmonary edema, accumulation of protein-rich fluid into the interstitium, alveolar space, and diffuse inflammation. The later organizing stage occurs with the resolution of pulmonary edema and lung inflammation.

Indeed, a large amount of ROS, which are found in broncho alveolar lavages (BAL) of ARDS patients are produced mainly by alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, lung endothelial, and epithelial cells. These ROS can alter gene and protein function. Among several ROS-producing enzymes, NADPH oxidase (NOX) enzymes, which are membrane-bound complexes catalyzing the reduction of molecular oxygen (O 2 ) to superoxide (O 2 -) [2] , are involved in principal clinical manifestations of ALI/ARDS [1, 3] .

Recently, structural homologues of the phagocyte NOX enzyme were identified, such as NOX1-3-4-5, DUOX1, and DUOX2. Despite their similar structure and enzymatic function, NOX enzymes differ in their mechanisms of activation, which depend on the recruitment of membrane or/and cytosolic regulatory subunits such as p22 phox , p47 phox , p67 phox , NOXO1, NOXA1, and RAC [2] .

The number of neutrophils increases fast as they travel via the interstitium into the airspaces. This is facilitated by the disruption of the vascular structures, which occurs when neutrophils and fibrin plugs occlude the capillaries ( Fig. 1a, b) . Hyaline membranes (HM) made of fibrin, proteins and cellular debris; accumulate along the alveolar walls (Fig. 1a, b) . By electron microscopy, all stages of epithelial degeneration can be observed from slight cytoplasmic swelling to huge blister formation and total destruction of the epithelial lining [62] . In parallel, the endothelial cell layer is often irregular because of cytoplasmic swelling and large vacuoles. Endothelial defects (Fig. 1b , enlarged insert). Concerning the late exudative stage, the epithelial lining is thin and covered by laminated paucicellular HM. The alveolar septa are enlarged and contain numerous inflammatory cells. After approximately 7 days, the organizing or proliferative stage is observed with increased interstitial cellularity. The number of large cuboidal cells, which resemble epithelial type II cells and might represent a stem cell population of the lung ( Fig. 1c and d) , increases strikingly. The composition of the interstitial cells changes; neutrophils are partly replaced by macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. The interstitium is organized by the proliferation of connective tissue, persisting edema, and convolutes of loose fibrous tissue without capillaries. There is a strong diminution of the microvasculature that is sometimes compressed by the surrounding tissue. Myofibroblasts that express vimentin and a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) are progressively observed in interstitium and then in airspaces, with a maximum in the early proliferative stage [63] .

There are several causes that increase oxidative stress in ARDS such as breathing high inspiratory oxygen concentration. However, the large majority of oxidants are generated by phagocytic cells transmigrating into the lungs. Neutrophils are crucial since they appear early in histological specimens and are strongly increased in the BAL. They release many inflammatory mediators that include chemokines, cytokines, and proteases [61] . The activation of the neutrophils may occur at remote sites and/or by circulating cytokines, resulting in ROS release and increased pulmonary vascular permeability. However, neutrophils are not mandatory for the development of ARDS, because it can occur in neutropenic patients. Other key initiators of the pulmonary inflammation in ARDS are the circulating inflammatory mediators (e.g., TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, leukotrienes), as well as changes in the coagulation system. Alveolar edema resulting from endothelial dysfunction and loss of epithelial integrity reduces the barrier function. The edema is even increased by the loss of type II pneumocytes that normally promote fluid transport out of the alveolus through their apical sodium pumps. Early loss of surfactant is explained by the damage of type II epithelial cells, which produce surfactant and by its neutralization by protein-rich edema fluid. This contributes to alveolar collapse, intrapulmonary shunt, and hypoxemia. The hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is impaired by endothelial and smooth muscle cell dysfunction. This may, with the association of microthrombi, contribute to the development of secondary pulmonary hypertension.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 612, "end": 616, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Histopathology and pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS"}, {"text": "Whereas the mechanisms that initiate ALI/ARDS remain unclear, there is some evidence that ROS generated by NOX enzymes participate in the pathogenesis of this syndrome.

Animal models reproduce major clinical features of ALI/ARDS observed in humans including the loss of the alveolar-capillary barrier with the damage of both epithelial and endothelial cells and the inflammatory cell influx. In this way, all these models provide key elements to study the role of the NOX family during ALI/ARDS. In the next part, we will examine their involvement in different mouse models of ALI/ARDS that mimic neutrophilic infiltration and lung injury in sepsis-like models and the damage of the alveolarcapillary barrier.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Role of NOX enzymes in ALI/ARDS"}, {"text": "Histological analysis of lung sections from ARDS patients as well as BAL obtained in the acute phase of the disease show massive accumulation of neutrophils [64] and most acute lung injuries induced in animal models are neutrophil-dependent [65] [66] [67] . These inflammatory cells produce high levels of ROS, which are thought to increase the inflammatory processes and tissue injury in septic shock syndrome [68] [69] [70] . In addition, ROS participates in the modulation of cell-signaling pathways that activate transcription factor of redox-sensitive pro-inflammatory mediators such as NF-jB [71, 72] . The studies concerning the effect of ROS generated by NOX enzymes in acute inflammatory responses and lung injury following Escherichia coli and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenges in mice are controversial [37, 71, 73, 74] . Indeed, some studies have shown that the absence of p47 phox (a regulatory subunit essential for NOX2 activation) did not contribute to LPS-induced lung damage, vascular leakage, and infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes in mice [75] . Swain et al. [76] did not observe any improvement of pulmonary lung injury in gp91 phox -deficient mice during pneumocystis pneumonia. By contrast, it has been demonstrated that LPS-induced inflammation and lung injury was inhibited but also in some cases increased in NOXdeficient mouse models. The absence of p47 phox and gp91 phox has been associated with enhanced inflammatory gene expression, lung neutrophil recruitment, and mouse survival after LPS challenge [77, 78] . On the other hand, LPS-induced lung inflammation was reduced in mice deficient for Nrf2, a regulator of antioxidant defenses, in absence of p47 phox or gp91 phox [37] . Moreover, ROS production restricted to macrophages from Nrf2-deficient mice was blunted by the absence of gp91 phox after LPS challenge [37] . Similarly, inflammatory response induced by live Escherichia coli or LPS was reduced in lung tissues of p47 phox -and gp91 phox -deficient mice [71, 73] . Sadikot et al. [74] has reported that NF-jB activation and TNF-a levels were decreased in p47 phox -deficient mice after Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and a recent study showed that ROS generated by NOX2 in neutrophils were involved in TNF-a-induced acute lung injury [38] and participated in inflammatory response through the activation of NF-jB [36] . These results support the notion that ROS generated by NOX2 play a critical role in the induction of inflammatory responses and tissue injury in sepsis. The family of Toll-like receptors (TLR), which to date contains ten members, recognizes specific molecules conserved among microorganisms and pathogens, and plays an important role in initiating the inflammatory response [79] . Emerging evidence demonstrates that NOX enzymes modulate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and TLR2 signaling not only in neutrophils and macrophages but also in other cells. Lipopolysaccharide specifically binds to LPS-binding protein (LBP) and forms a complex that activates the TLR4 receptor of macrophages and others cells. This interaction triggers the activation of Ijb kinase and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKK), which in turn activate NF-jB and AP1, respectively [80] . Activated NF-jB and AP-1 translocate into the nucleus where they bind to DNA promoter regions and induce the transcription of inflammatory genes. It has been shown that in neutrophils, NOX2-derived ROS regulate the TLR4-mediated activation of NF-jB. In addition, in endothelial cells, NOX2 also contributes to TLR2 gene activation in response to LPS [36, 81] . A recent study demonstrated that ROS generated by NOX2 in neutrophils mediates high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)/TLR4 signaling and tissue damage after hemorrhagic shock/resuscitation in mice [82] . Besides NOX2, NOX4 is able to directly interact with TLR4 and mediate ROS generation and NF-jB activation in HEK293T cells [83] . More recently, NOX4 has been shown to mediate LPS-induced NK-jB-dependent IL8, MCP-1 and ICAM-1 gene expression in human aortic endothelial cells [84] and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 transcription factor activation in U373/CD14 cells [85] . NADPH oxidase4 is also able to activate AP-1 and subsequent CXCR6 expression, after LPS challenge in human aortic smooth muscle cells [86] . Similar to NOX4, the presence of crosstalk between NOX1 and TLR4 was suggested by the observation that LPS derived from Helicobacter pylori increases ROS production and NOX1 expression in guinea pig gastric pit cells through a TLR4 signaling pathway [87] . All these results suggest that NOX family plays an important role in the activation of TLR4 signaling pathways (including NF-jB, IRF-3 and AP1) in response to LPS. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism linking TLR4 to NOX1 remains unclear and the function of NOX1 and NOX4 in TLR-mediated signaling in vivo need to be elucidated using either knock-out mice or RNA interference strategy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 161, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 241, "end": 245, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 246, "end": 250, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 251, "end": 255, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 411, "end": 415, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 416, "end": 420, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 421, "end": 425, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 598, "end": 602, "text": "[71,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 603, "end": 606, "text": "72]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 816, "end": 820, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 821, "end": 824, "text": "71,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 825, "end": 828, "text": "73,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 829, "end": 832, "text": "74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1068, "end": 1072, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1088, "end": 1092, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1541, "end": 1545, "text": "[77,", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1546, "end": 1549, "text": "78]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1714, "end": 1718, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1857, "end": 1861, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2008, "end": 2012, "text": "[71,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2013, "end": 2016, "text": "73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2034, "end": 2038, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2369, "end": 2373, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2750, "end": 2754, "text": "[79]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 3243, "end": 3247, "text": "[80]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 3600, "end": 3604, "text": "[36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3605, "end": 3608, "text": "81]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 3803, "end": 3807, "text": "[82]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 3933, "end": 3937, "text": "[83]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 4086, "end": 4090, "text": "[84]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 4183, "end": 4187, "text": "[85]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 4324, "end": 4328, "text": "[86]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 4581, "end": 4585, "text": "[87]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Lung inflammation and injury"}, {"text": "Alveolar cell death has been reported extensively in humans and in experimental models of acute lung injury [88] .

While the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, a lethal lung disorder characterized by abnormal lung repair, is unknown, it involves early inflammatory steps and late fibrotic changes with proliferation of fibroblasts and their differentiation into myofibroblasts [94, 95] . Intratracheal instillation of bleomycin in mice, a well-known characterized model to study initial lung epithelial injury and subsequent fibrosis, mimics ALI/ARDS features occurring during the late proliferative and fibrotic phase. In this model, NOX-dependent ROS are not only responsible for initial epithelial damage but also for the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, the hallmark of the disease. Several studies have shown that TGF-b1 increases ROS levels by up-regulating NOX4 expression in lung fibroblasts and induces their differentiation into myofibroblasts [8, 96, 97] . Interestingly, in human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), NOX4 has been detected in myofibroblasts of late fibrotic scars, suggesting a possible role of NOX4 in the development of organized fibrosis, and was also detected in the alveolar proliferative epithelium of IPF lungs adjacent to fibroblastic foci.

In rodents and in alveolar cell culture, oxygen toxicity (100 % O 2 ) has been used as a well-established model of lesions mimicking the acute phase of ALI/ARDS and for studying direct alveolar damage induced by high levels of oxidants. It was first explored in rats and later extensively characterized in mice [112] [113] [114] . During the initiation phase (usually lasting for 48 h), only subtle changes can be detected, such as the arrest of cell replication, and lesions are not evident on light microscopy. This phase is followed by diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane deposition and extensive death of alveolar cells (mainly endothelial and epithelial cells) associated with a generally mild inflammatory response, which can vary according to the species [115] . Alveolar cell death has been shown to be directly related to increased generation of oxidant in hyperoxic condition [116] . Reactive oxygen species can be generated by mitochondrial chain transport as well as by NADPH oxidase enzymes [117] . In vitro studies have shown that the diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), a non-specific inhibitor of NOX isoforms, was effective in reducing hyperoxiainduced ROS generation in a pulmonary epithelial cell line (MLE-12) and in primary pulmonary type II cells [117] [118] [119] . Recently, our laboratory demonstrated that NOX1, which is highly expressed in lungs, plays a crucial role in hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury [17] . NADPH oxi-dase1-deficient mice exposed to hyperoxia exhibited reduced pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane deposition, and alveolar-capillary damage.

The phosphorylation of both c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), as well as caspase-3 activation were decreased in lung homogenates.

The involvement of NOX4 in hyperoxic cultured endothelial cells (EC) has also been investigated. NADPH oxidase4 mRNA expression is increased in hyperoxia [28] through direct modulation of gene transcription. Indeed, direct interaction between nrf2 transcription factor and NOX4 promoter has been reported. The authors demonstrated that hyperoxia increased the recruitment-and the binding of nfr2 to endogenous NOX4 promoter via antioxidant response element (ARE) in pulmonary endothelial cells [44] . Hyperoxia also regulates NOX activation in part by ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK [117] , but also by an Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p47 phox [29] . It has also been proposed that NOX2 could be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and p47 phox translocation following hyperoxia in ECs derived from human pulmonary artery [120] . Recently, Pendyala et al. [28] demonstrated the contribution of NOX4 in endothelial dysfunction. They showed that the transfection of a NOX4-specific siRNA in HPAEC attenuated hyperoxia-induced migration and capillary tube formation.

These results suggest that NOX4 contributes not only to the dysfunction or death of endothelial cells, but it might be involved in the alveolar-capillary disruption observed in ALI/ARDS.
