However, prophylaxis was routinely used in early studies, and molecular diagnostic tools were not employed. The objective of this study was to review the incidence of PJP during and post-FCR in the era of highly sensitive molecular diagnostics and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)-computerised tomography (CT). Methods: All patients treated with standard FCR at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (March 2009 to June 2012) were identified from a medications management database. Laboratory-confirmed PJP cases during this time were identified from an electronic database. Results: Overall, 66 patients were treated with a median of 5.5 FCR cycles. Eight PJP cases were identified, 6 of whom had received chemotherapy prior to FCR. In 5 cases, 18 F-FDG PET demonstrated bilateral ground-glass infiltrates. Median CD4 + lymphocyte counts at time of PJP diagnosis and 9-12 months following FCR were 123 and 400 cells/lL, respectively. In patients receiving no prophylaxis, 9.1% developed PJP during FCR. The rate following FCR was 18.4%, with median onset at 6 months (2.4-24 months). Conclusion: Given the high rate of late-onset PJP, consideration should be given for extended PJP prophylaxis for up to 12 months post-FCR, particularly in pretreated patients.
