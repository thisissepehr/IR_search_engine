Both reflecting and helping to shape attitudes toward health issues, the relationship between media and the public is more than a simplistic and linear transmission of information. 13, 14 In addition, with the rise of new media, particularly via the internet, the role of traditional sources of health information, such as newspapers, is changing. 15 Nevertheless, studies have consistently shown that the news media, including newspapers, remain one of the single most important sources of health information. It has the power to frame issues and, perhaps, influence perceptions of the risks and benefits of health interventions. 16, 17 Indeed, one study found that 85% of Canadians believe they have made at least one behavioural change as a result of media reports about health. 18 Other studies have found that health care professionals and researchers view the media as a powerful source of health information. 12, 19 Given the important role of the news media -a role that has been recognized and embraced by public health agencies, as exemplified by the numerous A/H1N1-relevant press releases (e.g., refs. 20-22) -we examined print news reports concerning the A/H1N1 vaccine in Canada with the objective of exploring media coverage content, including discussion and/or mention of reasons and evidence for or against being vaccinated or risks associated with the A/H1N1 virus and vaccination; and theme, i.e., whether the article supports, questions or is neutral about the vaccine program.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 154, "end": 155, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 458, "end": 460, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 633, "end": 635, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 950, "end": 952, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1208, "end": 1211, "text": "13,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1212, "end": 1214, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1375, "end": 1377, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1658, "end": 1661, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1662, "end": 1664, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1809, "end": 1811, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1943, "end": 1946, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1947, "end": 1949, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "We conducted a quantitative content analysis to examine latent content such as benefit, risk, evidence and theme. 23 To develop a representative sample of newspaper articles from across Canada, we searched the Factiva and Canadian Newsstand databases, which provide only textual results from a finite set of newspapers from major cities in each Canadian province or territory.

Previous research suggests that the public seeks news that confirms pre-existing values and assumptions. 28 Therefore, even a moderate amount of negative press may be sufficient to reinforce fears among those in the population already skeptical of a vaccine. There are several limitations to our study. First, it is a sampling of Canadian news print articles. Second, the analysis did not include images that originally accompanied the news articles; images that evoke anxiety in some readers (e.g., close-up of a needle puncturing the skin, photo of a crying child getting vaccinated) may influence how the reader interprets the content of the article. While not a limitation of our study, it is important to recognize that there are many other forces that impact public perception. For example, the Internet may provide additional insight into the portrayal of the A/H1N1 vaccination program in Canada. The content and tone of government public health recommendations for vaccination also influence public attitudes and behaviour 29 and present another area for research.

Il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que ces reportages influencent les d\u00e9cisions du public \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la sant\u00e9, notamment les choix concernant la vaccination. Nous avons analys\u00e9 la repr\u00e9sentation du vaccin anti-A/H1N1 dans les journaux canadiens, \u00e0 savoir : la mention des risques et des avantages du vaccin et si l'article \u00e9tait pour ou contre le vaccin ou s'il \u00e9tait neutre \u00e0 ce sujet. M\u00e9thode : Nous avons compil\u00e9 un jeu de donn\u00e9es compos\u00e9 d'articles de journaux canadiens (N=234) et effectu\u00e9 une analyse de fr\u00e9quence de contenu pour examiner la discussion et/ou la mention des preuves li\u00e9es \u00e0 la vaccination, les risques du virus A/H1N1 et du vaccin, et le ton de l'article \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du programme de vaccination au Canada. R\u00e9sultats : Les raisons de se faire vacciner \u00e9taient cit\u00e9es dans 71,8 % des articles, tandis que seulement 18,4 % citaient des raisons de ne pas se faire vacciner. Une discussion des preuves \u00e0 l'appui des all\u00e9gations pour ou contre le vaccin ne figurait que dans 27,8 % et dans 6,8 % des articles, respectivement. Les risques associ\u00e9s au virus A/H1N1 \u00e9taient discut\u00e9s dans 49,6 % des articles, et les risques du vaccin \u00e9taient discut\u00e9s dans 12,4 % des articles.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "202 REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANT\u00c9 PUBLIQUE \u2022 VOL. 102, NO. 3", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Table 1.
