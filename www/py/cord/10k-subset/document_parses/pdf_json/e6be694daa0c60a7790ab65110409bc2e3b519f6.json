The diabetic maculopathy can be explained on the grounds of Starling's law (Gottfredsd\u00f3 ttir et al. 1993; Kristinsson et al. 1997; Kristinsson 1997) . In a reply to this letter, Dr. Bek stated: ''the objective of the paper was not to discuss the idea that diabetic maculopathy is caused by increased hydrostatic pressure in retinal vessels. The objective was to go one step further back and point to a possible cause of this increased hydrostatic pressure. I believe that the idea of disturbed vasomotion as a possible cause of capillary hyperperfusion is new.'' This discussion shows clearly that diabetic macular edema is caused by an increased hydrostatic pressure in the retinal vessels. However, we propose that a decreased hydrostatic pressure in the tissue is another important factor causing macular edema. We suggested earlier that retinal traction by the posterior hyaloid membrane reduces tissue hydrostatic pressure in the retina (Ikeda et al. 1999a (Ikeda et al. , 1999b . We base this on the following observations: We performed vitrectomy on 2 patients (3 eyes) with diffuse macular edema who exhibited attachment of the posterior hyaloid to the retina but no ophthalmoscopic retinal traction. The cystoid changes disappeared a few days after vitrectomy, and the diffuse macular edema resolved within 2 weeks (Ikeda et al. 1999a) . The rapid disappearance of the macular edema after vitrectomy clearly indicated an involvement of the vitreous in the occurrence of edema.",

            "text": "We suggest that macular edema develops by the following mechanism: In the eyes of patients with diabetic retinopathy, plasma components leak into the vitreous due to an impairment of the blood-ocular barrier (Krupin et al. 1979; Cunha-Vaz 1983) , resulting in degeneration and contraction of the vitreous. This induces tangential traction of the posterior hyaloid membrane (Kishi & Shimizu 1993) , leading to an anterior traction of the retina attached to the posterior hyaloid membrane. As a result, the hydrostatic pressure in the tissue decreases (Ikeda et al. 1999b ). This increases the difference in hydrostatic pressure between the tissue and retinal vessels even when the degree of the increase in the hydrostatic pressure in the retinal vessels is slight. If the oncotic pressure remains constant, the outward flux of water into the tissue increases. In our cases in which retinal traction by the vitreous was released by detachment of the posterior hyaloid membrane by vitrectomy, fluorescein fundus angiography 1 week after surgery revealed that fluorescein leakage from the retinal vessels had almost disappeared (Ikeda et al. 1999a ). This was considered to be due to the normalization of the hydrostatic pressure in the tissue and a resultant decrease in the outward flux of water into the tissue. Although our subjects had diffuse macular edema, we have some patients in whom focal leakage from microaneurysms decreased after vitrectomy, suggesting the involvement of vitreous traction as a factor associated with aggravation of focal leakage.",

One way these changes could be induced is by disturbances in retinal vasomotion. S ternal cleft is a rare congenital anomaly, usually reported only as an isolated finding. It is rarely associated both with supra-umbilical raphe, which resembles a postoperative scar, and with craniofacial haemangioma (Leiber 1982; Igarashi et al. 1985 ). An excellent review by Gorlin and coworkers included 42 cases of patients with the combination of sternal non-union and supra-umbilical raphe with no evidence of gender predilection, though an additional 31 cases, in which facial haemangioma was included, were characterised by almost complete female preponderance (Gorlin et al. 1994) . Haemangiomas develop during the first few weeks after birth, grow rapidly for about six months, remain static for a while, and then most of them undergo involution and subside spontaneously by the age of 5-10 years. They are almost always sporadic in occurrence. We would like to report a girl with the three above mentioned findings. The haemangioma, which threatened her vision, manifested good response to systemic steroid treatment.",

Over the course of the next eight weeks, the eyelid haemangiomas continued to grow rapidly. Ophthalmological examination at nine weeks of age revealed the presence of haemangioma in both upper eyelids with bilateral blepharoptosis, more pronounced on the left side and causing obstruction of visual axis and esotropia in the left eye. Visual fixation in the left eye was decreased. Amblyopia treatment with patching was started, and surgery was performed on the left eyelid, the haemangioma being reduced via a 6 mm wide excision and the wound closed primarily.",

Instead, cortisone (Kenacort T A 10 mg/ml 0.2 ml) was injected intralesionally into the haemangiomatous tissue of the upper lid on the left side, and daily systemic steroid treatment was instituted with Prednisolone A 2 mg/kg. Already the following day a decrease of the haemangioma was noted, and ophthalmological examination five days later revealed significant regression. The girl could open both eyes well, and the visual axes were free bilaterally (Fig. 2) . The infant was generally alert. There was esotropia and decreased fixation in the left eye. After two weeks, steroid therapy was tapered off and after 40 days treatment every other day sufficed. The systemic steroid treatment could not be terminated completely until two years later. At the end of the treatment only small bilateral temporal haemangiomas, mild ptosis of the left eye, and a moderately enlarged lower lip remained.",

Fundus examination showed vitreous opacities, juxtapapillary chorioretinitis (Jensen's chorioretinitis), and retinal vasculitis and haemorrhages along the inferior temporal vessels (Fig. 1) . Right eye examination was unremarkable. A blood sample taken on the day of admission revealed the presence of IgM (titre\u21261:64) and IgG (titre\u21261:64) to R. conorii. Serum antibodies were detected using indirect immunofluorescence. TPHA test and tests for the detection of serum IgM and IgG to Toxoplasma gondii and Borrelia burgdorferi were negative. On the basis of these data, the diagnosis of Mediterranean spotted fever was made. As a result, the patient was treated with oral doxycycline (200 mg daily) and topical chloramphenicol (0.5%), dexamethasone (0.2%), and atropine (1%). After 3 weeks of treatment, there was complete resolution of the disease.

Acta Ophthalmol Scand 77: 612-613.In my opinion the comment of Tomohiro Ikeda is indeed important. There is no doubt that vitrectomy in some cases may be beneficial to diabetic maculopathy, especially the diffuse type. However, I think that it is questionable whether this effect is due to an elimination of retinal traction from the vitreous. If retinal traction should be the cause of diabetic retinal oedema one would expect clear regional differences with more lesions in the upper part of the retina (and the macular area) than in the lower part. Furthermore, patients with localized retinal traction from a vitreous string would develop lesions similar to diabetic maculopathy in the affected area. This is in my experience not the case.",
