If they are indeed similar to mucosal mast cells, globule leukocytes would be expected to decrease in number in rats treated with dexamethasone but not in rats treated with compound 48/80, an agent which causes non-antigenic degranulation of connective tissue mast cells. In this study, we determined the number and compared the distribution of globule leukocytes and connective tissue mast cells in the tracheas of pathogen-free rats. We then determined whether the number of these two types of cells changes in rats treated for 5 days with compound 48/80, dexamethasone, a combination of compound 48/80 and dexamethasone, or saline. We identified globule leukocytes and mast cells in whole mounts and histological sections of rat tracheas by using a histochemical reaction that demonstrates the chymotrypsin-like protease (chloroacetate esterase) present in mast cell granules. Using this method, we found that aproximately 225 000 globule leukocytes were present in the epithelium of the trachea. These cells were most abundant in the rostral trachea. Rats treated with dexamethasone had a 91% reduction in the number of globule leukocytes with protease-containing granules, but rats treated with compound 48/80 had a normal number of these cells. We found some 55000 connective tissue mast cells in the same tracheas. Mast cells were most abundant in the posterior membrane of the caudal trachea and in the lamina propria between cartilaginous rings. Rats treated with compound 48/80 had a 96% reduction in mast cells with proteasecontaining granules, but rats treated with dexamethasone had a normal complement of mast cells. We conclude that globule leukocytes are abundant in the tracheas of healthy rats, are similar in morphology and pharmacological responses to mucosal mast cells located in other organs of rats, and are more numerous than and have a different distribution than connective tissue mast cells. Globule leukocytes in the tracheal epithelium may have a role in respiratory defenses similar to that of mucosal mast cells in other organs.",

Although mucosal mast cells have not been specifically described in the respiratory tract of rodents, there exists in the tracheal epithelium of normal rats as well as in the mucosa of other organs in certain other species, the globule leukocyte (Weill 1919; Toner 1963; Kent 1952; Jeffery and Reid 1975) , a cell type which may be related to or identical to mucosal mast cells (Kent 1966; Murray et al. 1968; Mayrhofer 1980; Huntley et al. 1984b) .

This response of mucosal mast cells differs from the response of connective tissue mast cells, which degranulate after treatment with compound 48/80 (Hunt and Hunt 1956) but not after corticosteroids (Rasanen 1960; Heap and Kiernan 1973) , If globule leukocytes in the trachea are indeed analogous to mucosal mast cells of the gastrointestinal tract, granulated globule leukocytes would be expected to decrease in number after treatment with corticosteroids but not after treatment with compound 48/80. There is already evidence that globule leukocytes in the trachea and mucosal mast cells in the gastrointestinal tract have similar responses to dexamethasone (Kent et al. 1954 ), but it is not known how globule leukocytes respond to compound 48/80.

Because the granules of both mast cells and globule leukocytes contain a chymotrypsin-like serine protease (Gomori 1953; Benditt and Arase 1956; Huntley et al. 1984a) , they can be distinguished from other cells in the trachea by the red reaction product produced by the protease's action on a chloroacetate substrate. The intense color of this reaction product enabled us to detect these cells both in histological sections and in tracheal whole mounts. Furthermore, detecting the esterase activity of the granule-associated protease, unlike detecting the metachromasia of granule-associated proteoglycans, is unaffected by aldehyde fixation (Wingren and Enerback 1982; Becker etal. 1985) . Our study revealed that globule leukocytes differed from mast cells in their number and distribution in the trachea and in their response to dexamethasone and compound 48/80, and that the response of globule leukocytes in the trachea to dexamethasone and to 48/80 was indeed similar to that of mucosal mast cells in the gastrointestinal tract.",

The calculation showed that for globule leukocytes and mast cells, the number of cells present was 41% and 40%, respectively, of the number of nuclear profiles counted in sections 2.5 ~tm thick.

Second, the thickness of tracheal whole mounts may limit the visibility of some stained cells located deep in the tracheal wall.

The latter cell type is considered by some to be the same as or related to mucosal mast cells and, by inference, to the globule leukocyte. If globule leukocytes are indeed analogous to bone marrow-derived mast cells, then globule leukocytes may contribute to airway pathology by releasing mediators, such as leukotrienes C4 and D4 (Razin et al. 1982 (Razin et al. , 1983 Mencia-Huerta 1985) , prostaglandins (Razin 1983) , and platelet activating factor (Mencia-Huerta 1983) , that are known to be released by cultured bone marrowderived mast cells. The abundance of globule leukocytes in a sentinel position of the airway, even in specific pathogen-free rats, suggests their potential importance in mediating airway inflammatory and allergic responses.",

Whole mounts of rat tracheas treated according to the histochemical reaction for chloroacetate esterase Fig. 3 shows ovoid mast cells in the connective tissue of the posterior membrane Fig. 4 shows the smaller and more rounded globule leukocytes in the tracheal epithelium. Both types of cells are shown here at a magnification of x 850, which is the same as that of Figs. I and 2 Figs. 5, 6. The relative numbers and distributions of mast cells and globule leukocytes are shown in these micrographs of tracheal whole mounts stained for chloroacetate esterase, x 80 Fig. 5 shows mast cells that are most abundant on the abluminal surface of the trachea's posterior membrane and between cartilaginous rings Fig. 6 illustrates the abundance of globule leukocytes visible in the tracheal epithelium, as viewed here from the luminal surface. The globule leukocytes are more abundant in the epithelium overlying the tissue between cartilaginous rings (two dark vertical bands) than in the epithelium over the cartilaginous rings themselves (pale vertical bands) Figs. 7, 8.
