It is especially prevalent in late spring and summer months and is endemic in many geographic regions such as Africa and the Balkans. The virus is a member of the genus Nairovirus of the Bunyavirus family and can lead to life-threatening bleeding [1] . Although its etiopathogenesis is not clearly understood, the virus is transmitted via tick bite [2] and creates an intense systemic inflammatory response. Nonspecific symptoms like fever, weakness, and myalgia can appear during the acute period. In later stages of the illness, the virus can cause lifethreatening clinical conditions, including shock and spontaneous severe bleeding caused by decreased platelet levels. There has been an increase in the number of cases worldwide and in Turkey over the past few years [1, 2] . Surprisingly, studies investigating the pulmonary system in CCHF are rather rare.

The virus is met by the body's monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells; then, if the virus is not sufficiently eliminated by the host's defense cells, it is replicated [5] [6] [7] . The virus first spreads to regional lymph nodes, and then to the other organ systems, through vascular pathways. The virus damages the liver, spleen, and endothelial cells due to its direct cytotoxic effect. This evokes cytokine and chemokine release from defense cells with non-cytopathic effects, and can lead to endothelial damage as well as an intense inflammatory response. When factors and mechanisms related to this pathogenesis are considered generally, the prognosis of the disease corresponds to viral burden, the sufficiency of the host's immune system, and the inflammatory response [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . There are similar diseases caused by hantavirus, which belongs to the Bunyavirus family. These other diseases include viral hemorrhagic fevers, and are similar in both pathophysiological mechanisms and in clinical characteristics. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is one such disease, which utilizes similar clinical and pathophysiological mechanisms compared with the lung symptoms of CCHF. These two viruses cause similar immune responses and systemic inflammation in the host [13, 14] . Furthermore, when examining lung symptoms of HPS caused by both CCHF and the hantavirus, the affinities of these two members of the Bunyavirus family for lung tissue are better understood.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 295, "end": 298, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 299, "end": 302, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 303, "end": 306, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 904, "end": 907, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 908, "end": 911, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 912, "end": 916, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 917, "end": 921, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 922, "end": 926, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1411, "end": 1415, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1416, "end": 1419, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The effects of CCHF on the lung have not been clearly delineated, and there is limited information concerning these effects. When pathophysiological mechanisms at the molecular level are taken into consideration, this process, caused by numerous inflammatory factors, is associated with increased endothelial damage and vascular permeability. In turn, these conditions are closely related to clinical conditions like pleural effusion, alveolar hemorrhage, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and shock occurring in the lungs of patients with CCHF [15, 16] . For this reason, it can be stated that the CCHF virus, which causes an intense systemic inflammatory Fig. 2 The same patient described in Fig. 1 was examined for the enlargements of the pulmonary trunk and right and left main pulmonary arteries, in addition to diameter measurements, via enhanced thoracic CT response, leads to an intense inflammatory response in vascular and defensive cells of the lungs in a similar fashion. Thus, changes happening due to this intense inflammatory response and endothelial damage in pulmonary vascular beds, especially in pulmonary arteries, have become significant in revealing the etiopathogenesis related to the lungs in CCHF. As indicated in our study, a significant rise in the diameter of the pulmonary artery of CCHF patients can be the evidence of this intense inflammatory response and endothelial damage.

In the echocardiography of one patient in the study group, which was performed during the patient's hospitalization, the sPAP and other cardiac symptoms were detected at normal levels. However, the sPAP was 40 mmHg higher than normal in the echocardiography done on the 10th day of hospitalization. In the follow-up examinations, there was clinical recovery and the sPAP value decreased to normal levels. Engin et al. evaluated 52 patients with CCHF by echocardiography. As a result, when they separated the patients into two groups consisting of severe and mild forms based on their clinical symptoms, the average sPAP value measured by echocardiography in both groups was high (48 and 36 mmHg, respectively). When the patients were grouped as fatal and nonfatal and compared, the sPAP was 50 mmHg in the fatal group and 39 mmHg in the nonfatal group. In that study, the comparisons among all groups were statistically significant (p \\ 0.05) [17] . These results suggest that pulmonary hypertension found in echocardiographic examinations is based on coagulation deficits, vascular endothelial damage, and an inflammatory response that occurs with CCHF's pathophysiology. In our study, the increased diameter of the pulmonary trunks and main pulmonary arteries in patients with CCHF might also be the result of pulmonary hypertension occurring during the clinical and pathophysiological processes of the disease. Our choice to conduct a retrospective study is our first limitation; however, patients' medical information and radiological images had been properly recorded, and there were no difficulties in retrieving their data. Another limitation is that echocardiography could not be performed on all patients. The reason for this was that some patients' general condition was not suitable for an echocardiographic evaluation. In addition, an optimal measurement method is necessary to conduct the follow-up of the patients with echocardiography during their hospitalization and clinical follow-up period, and perform an evaluation of cardiac and pulmonary artery dimensions with thoracic CT in a parallel manner.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1022, "end": 1026, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, pathophysiological changes in CCHF have not yet been clearly elucidated.

Nevertheless, there is still little known about the effect of CCHF on the lungs.
