Polylactic acid (PLA) for 3D printing is widely available and biocompatible, but there is a gap in knowledge concerning its compatibility with chemical disinfectants. In this study, 3Dprinted PLA tensile samples were created with six different printer settings. Each of these six batches consisted of five sets with five or six samples. The first set remained untreated, the others were soaked in Cidex OPA or in a chlorine solution. These were applied for seven consecutive days or in 25 short cycles. All samples were weighed before and after treatment and subjected to a tensile test. Results showed that a third of the treatments led to an increase of the median weight with a maximum of 8.3%, however, the samples with the best surface quality did not change. The median strength increase was 12.5% and the largest decrease was 8.8%. The median stiffness decreased 3.6% in one set and increased in three others up to 13.6%. When 3D printing PLA medical tools, surface porosity must be minimized to prevent transfer of disinfectants to people. The wide variability of mechanical properties due to 3D printing itself and as a consequence of disinfection must be considered when designing medical tools by selecting appropriate printer settings.

Both increases and decreases of stress and strain were found for the yield and breaking points, with a maximum increase of 12.5% and a maximum decrease of 8.8% or the median yield stress. The large decrease in strength of batch A compared to batch B is in line with expectations. A combination of a low temperature and high print speed is known to reduce stiffness and strength [24] . Reducing the fill percentage from 100% in batch B to 65% in batch C resulted in the same decrease of strength, using less material than in batch A. Using the same slicer settings, but printing the samples directly on the bed provided about 50% extra strength in batch F compared to batch C. The effect of printing partially supported surfaces is therefore very important to take into account when designing for 3D printing and printing directly on the print bed should be regarded as an effective way to maximize strength. A further reduction of infill led to decreased stiffness as expected in batch D. Reducing the number of shell perimeters to 2 in batch E led to a yield strength of 1.2 (1.2-1.3) MPa compared to 1.4 (1.4-1.5) MPa with 4 shell perimeters in batch C.

Despite identifying the risks related to transfer of the cleaning agent to human tissue, the magnitude of this risk has not been quantified. Also, Ultimakers are relatively expensive 3D printers and not widely available in LMICs, the same goes for the filament.
