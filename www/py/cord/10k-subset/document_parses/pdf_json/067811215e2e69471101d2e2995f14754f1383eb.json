Environmental exposure can drive epigenetic modification which allows for adaptative immune-T cell activation [18] and memory responses [19] as well as exposure to immuno-toxic or -modulatory activities that can altered immune functions. Interestingly, few studies showed that Ab responses to certain specific vaccines (pneumococcal, rabies, and typhoid vaccines) may be influenced by month of vaccine administration [20] suggesting that seasonally variable environmental Ags may have a co-stimulatory effect on immune responses. Changing temperature, diurnal exposure to sunlight, food availability, and exposure to infectious agents may be part of the different season environmental factors that may act on the immune system. In malariaendemic areas, human populations are repeatedly exposed to salivary components of blood-feeding mosquitoes that possess a variety of pharmacologically active biomolecules with anti-haemostatic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties to counter the host defense responses activated during a blood meal [21] . There is now evidence that co-injected saliva has immunomodulatory properties, and studies support a role for mosquito saliva in enhancing pathogen transmission via the modulation of Th1/Th2 immune responses [22, 23] .",

A more recent study in humanized mice suggests that a mixture of Th1 and Th2 responses are upregulated by mosquito saliva and can last for several days in the skin and bone marrow [26] . Most of studies have been performed in murine models and it is obvious that the investigation of this question in human populations from endemic settings is much more complicated. Relatively few studies have investigated the effects of mosquito saliva on human cells ex vivo [27] and on cytokine production from human cells following stimulation with mosquito saliva [28] [29] [30] . Altogether, it suggests that human immune response to mosquito saliva is significant and complex: mosquito saliva alters the frequencies of several immune cell populations and cytokine production, in multiple tissues, at several times after blood feeding [26] .",

So far, few studies have investigated specifically this assumption. Two independent experimental studies suggested that mice exposed either to Anopheles or to tick feeding showed a down-regulated Ag-specific immune response compared to na\u00efve mice (model Ag = ovalbumin and BSA, respectively) [31, 32] . Studies extending this approach from murine to natural infection in humans living in malaria-endemic settings are challenging but required. Previous studies showed that acquired anti-Plasmodium IgG responses in children differed in two geographic areas where the level of exposure to Anopheles vectors was markedly different [33] . Sarr et al. showed a modulation of the balance of cytophilic Ab responses to parasite Ags according to the level of exposure of children to Anopheles bites. High exposure to Anopheles bites seemed to down-regulate the protective IgG1 Ab responses to whole Plasmodium extracts and to CSP Ag, whereas specific IgG3 responses were similar for the two Plasmodium Ags in villages exposed to either low or high levels of Anopheles bites [34] .",

Interestingly, the intensity of Anopheles exposure was assessed at an individual level by evaluating the IgG level specific to the Anopheles gambiae gSG6-P1 salivary peptide. For the last decade, new immune-epidemiological tools have been developed that aimed at evaluating the level of exposure to mosquito bites at population and individual level [35] . These innovative tools are based on the measure of human antibody responses to salivary proteins of arthropod vector injected during the bite. As far as the Anopheles genus is concerned, the IgG response to the gSG6-P1 peptide (An. gambiae Salivary Gland Protein-6 peptide 1) of An. gambiae saliva has been identified and validated as a pertinent biomarker of Anopheles bites [36] [37] [38] . It represents a proxy of human exposure to Anopheles bites and is a reliable tool for assessing spatial and temporal heterogeneity of exposure at the individual level [35] . The gSG6-P1 salivary peptide is specific to the Anopheles genus, antigenic, easy to synthesize and highly conserved between Anopheles mosquitoes.",

The two approaches did not give the same level of information about the exposure to Anopheles bites. HLC method indicates the mean number of bites that an individual may receive per night. Thus, it appreciates as an approximate proxy the level of exposure for each Culicidae species at site scale but does not take into account the inter-individual heterogeneity of exposure in natural setting. Indeed, environmental factors generating hot-spots of exposure (proximity to breeding sites for example), attraction an individual exerts on mosquitoes and the use of personal protection against mosquito bites (such as nets and coils) suggest that exposure to Anopheles bites can be highly variable from house to house and also between people living in the same house. Only the serological approach reflects the human-Anopheles contact and integrates the individual risk factors of being bitten. It provides for each participant a proxy of the individual level of exposure to Anopheles bites and thus, is more appropriate for reflecting the inter-individual heterogeneity of exposure in natural setting. Numerous studies have evidenced the Anopheles gSG6-P1 salivary peptide represents a reliable and complementary tool to entomological methods for assessing spatial and temporal heterogeneity of exposure to Anopheles bites at the individual level [35] .",

In the present study, when applying the cut-off of positivity (\u0394OD gSG6-P1 = 0.204) [44, 45] , one individual from Petessou and two from Dar-es-Salam were seronegative indicating that all but three individuals can be considered exposed to Anopheles. In addition, the wide range of \u0394OD gSG6-P1 values in either Petessou and Dar-es-Salam, suggested that participants with higher \u0394OD gSG6-P1 values were bitten more in comparison to those with lower \u0394OD gSG6-P1 values and thereby applying a threshold (mean \u0394OD gSG6-P1 \u00b1 0.1) would stratified the population in two groups with different level of exposure to Anopheles bites. IgG, IgG1 and IgG3 levels to PfAMA1 and PfMSP1 merozoite stage antigens were compared according to demographic factors and between groups of exposure. No statistically significant effect of age (univariate and multivariate analysis) or gender (univariate analysis) on the level of Abs specific to PfAMA1 and PfMSP1 was noted. According to univariate and multivariate analysis, specific Ab titres to PfMSP1 differed significantly between groups of exposure in total population (IgG and IgG3) and in Petessou village (IgG, IgG1 and IgG3). A higher exposure to Anopheles bites was associated with a significant trend toward lower IgG, IgG1 and IgG3 responses specific to PfMSP1. A higher Ab titres could be expected in children higher exposed to Anopheles bites and, therefore, to malaria transmission. Nevertheless, the epidemiological observation in the present study is consistent with studies that reported a down-regulated immune response to specific Ag in mice exposed to arthropod saliva compared to na\u00efve mice [31, 32] . Exposure to biting mosquitoes may lead to a modification of the host's immune cells and of the balance between Th1 and Th2 cytokine production [26] . Several experimental murine studies showed that Th2 cytokines as IL-4, the inhibitory cytokine IL-10 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF, were up-regulated after uninfected Aedes, Culex or Anopheles mosquito bites [31, 46, 47] . The secretion of the immunosuppressive IL-10 cytokine could increase the proliferation of T regulatory cells and down-regulate specific Ab immune response because it inhibits Ag presentation, IFN-\u03b3 expression, and macrophage activation. IL-10 has also been involved in the balance of cytophilic Ab responses [48] . Thus, it is conceivable that the potential decrease of Ab levels in children higher exposed may be associated with a lower IL-10 production. This hypothesis could be assessed by analysing the ex vivo cytokine production of immune cells from individuals differently exposed to Anopheles bites.",

Sarr et al. reported that children with higher exposure to Anopheles bites presented a down-regulated IgG1 response to whole Plasmodium extract and to CSP Ag compared to children lower exposed, whereas no effect was observed for the IgG3 isotype response [34] . Dechavanne et al. reported that an environmental variable (quantitative index related to the spatiotemporal risk of exposure to Anopheles mosquitoes) was significantly associated with high anti-Plasmodium Ab levels in infants (6-18 month old infants) [13] . A recent study in malaria elimination context also showed a positive association between Anopheles exposure and IgG responses to PfCSP and PfMSP1 Ags [49] . Differences observed between studies might be attributed to the different context of exposure to Anopheles bites. Indeed, the history and intensity of exposure to mosquito bites may have different effect on immune system, as mentioned in experimental studies that reported a immunostimulatory effect with low concentrations of saliva whereas high concentrations were immunosuppressive [50] . Human studies in different malaria context are therefore needed even if challenging, due to numerous co-factors from the parasite, the human-host or environment that may modulate human immune system. The present study was carried out in uninfected children in order to minimize the antigenic boost of recent infection, thus the time since previous P. falciparum infection and rates of antibody decay may also participate in the differences observed between individuals from different groups of exposure. This represents a limit to the present study in addition to the small sample size. Malaria prevalence was near 50% in Petessou, thus it could be expected that individuals were regularly infected by Plasmodium parasites and that their last infection, symptomatic or asymptomatic, was recent. Other factors such as genetic background, co-infections, or nutritional status may also explain some of the differences in the immunological profiles observed between the two exposure groups.",

Parasitological data indicated that both sites had a similar intensity of malaria transmission with around 50% of malaria prevalence in the initial population. This suggests that factors other than parasite exposure alone may modulate anti-Plasmodium humoral responses. For example, the effect of human genetic factors cannot be excluded since the study children did not belong to the same ethnic group [51, 52] . The population from Dar-es-Salam is mostly composed of Dioula and Manding, whereas autochthonous Baoul\u00e9 live in the rural village of Petessou. Mosquito saliva is known to contain close to 100 secretory proteins, and comparative analyses indicated that Culex and Aedes saliva have specific salivary proteins not found in Anopheles saliva [53, 54] .",

The availability of a serological biomarker of exposure assessing specifically the exposure to Culex spp. bites at the individual level would be valuable in multivariate analysis to strengthen the hypothesis.",

Salivary modulators of the immune system could be prime targets for the development of transmission-blocking vaccines. Indeed, taking advantage of the modulation induced by saliva (e.g., neutralization of the immune suppression) would help the host's immune system to respond to pathogens. Interestingly, over the past few years, combining pathogen and salivary Ags in a single vaccine is seen as a valuable option [55] . Elucidating the mechanism may also lead to the discovery of new immunosuppressive molecules of therapeutic interest. These findings may also have an important impact on the evaluation of vaccine efficacy. Inter-individual variability in humoral immune responses to a specific P. falciparum antigen has been reported in different studies evaluating the immunogenicity of vaccine candidates [56, 57] . The exposure to immunomodulatory insect salivary proteins during or after the immunization period could modulate the acquisition as well the durability of Ab responses to vaccine Ag, as noted for rabies or typhoid vaccines [20] . It could also have consequences on the immunological profiles induced in terms of intensity and/or isotype distribution, and thus on the efficacy of the protective immunity. In this framework, it is clear that a better understanding of the modulation of protective and anti-vaccine immune responses by epidemiological and environmental factors is of public health relevance and would be valuable for malaria vaccine development.",
