EFSA provides scientific advice to the risk manager, at both European and Member State level, for the identification of risks present in the food chain. In the area of currently unrecognised but potentially significant risks for public health, EFSA has set up a dedicated unit on emerging risks (EMRISK). Through the identification of drivers of emerging risks, EFSA also intends to anticipate future risks derived from changes in current food/feed production practices or factors impinging on food/feed production or changes in human exposure through food consumption. EFSA aims to establish a data monitoring capacity, data filtering methodology and networking structures to identify emerging risks and drivers of emerging risks in a timely fashion and to communicate these to the risk manager. To date, the first step of this process (data monitoring) is in place. The following steps, that is, filtering and communication, are being rapidly established. Whilst the current data sources monitored are limited, they have been sufficient to enable the elaboration of the procedures for the next steps in the emerging risks identification process. As more data sources become accessible, the process will become more effective. All processes should be in place by mid -2010 and reported on in EFSA's first annual report on emerging risks in 2011.

Long term anticipation (that is, the prediction of ERs as opposed to their identification) should be based on the identification of drivers (e.g. climate change, new food production or processing technologies, etc.) for the emergence of new risks. This is an important differentiation due to the fact that one does not have to be able to identify a specific hazard in order to be able to anticipate that a certain action or change in conditions may well give rise to the emergence of a risk. It is therefore proposed that some long range forecasting activities do take place.

An example would be the identification of changes in the processes for recycling animal by-products into animal feed as a potential generator of emerging risks, as was probably the case for BSE.

The recent official recognition by WHO, that infections with C. sinensis or O. viverrini are carcinogenic, causing cholangiocarcinoma adds further concern about the spread of these parasitic infections Emerging and re-emerging foodborne infections are not exclusively associated with bacterial or parasitic pathogens. There is now ample documentation that the burden of foodborne viral illness is significant (Future Challenges to Microbial Food Safety, 2008; Newell et al., 2010) . The past decades have witnessed the emergence of new viruses able to infect humans, such as SARS coronaviruses, different strains of highly pathogenic avian influenza, Nipah virus and new genotypes of hepatitis E virus . More recently, evidence is accumulating to suggest that some of these virus infections are far more common than previously recognised, and that they can be acquired through consumption of contaminated food products Newell et al., 2010; Tassios and Kerr, 2010; Teo) . Which foods, routes of exposure, and variant strains represent the greatest risk for consumers is still under debate. Thus, foodborne transmission of viruses has long been recognised, but as the microbiological quality control criteria for food globally rely on standards developed for bacterial infections, these criteria seem to be insufficient to protect from viral foodborne infections . The issue of foodborne viruses is currently being addressed by the BIOHAZ Panel through a self-tasking mandate (EFSA-Q-2009-00877).
