Here, we investigated the effects of arctigenin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury. Mice were divided into four groups: control, LPS, LPS+DMSO, and LPS+ Arctigenin. Mice in the LPS+ Arctigenin group were injected intraperitoneally with 50 mg/kg of arctigenin 1 h before an intratracheal administration of LPS (5 mg/kg). Lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) were collected. Histological changes of the lung were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Arctigenin decreased LPS-induced acute lung inflammation, infiltration of inflammatory cells into BALF, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, arctigenin pretreatment reduced the malondialdehyde level and increased superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and glutathione peroxidase/glutathione disulfide ratio in the lung. Mechanically, arctigenin significantly reduced the production of nitric oxygen and inducible nitric oxygen synthase (iNOS) expression, enhanced the expression of heme oxygenase-1, and decreased the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Arctigenin has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects on LPS-induced acute lung injury, which are associated with modulation of MAPK, HO-1, and iNOS signaling.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Acute lung injury and its severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are leading factors of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients [1] . Histologically, acute lung injury/ARDS is characterized by hypoxemia, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, low lung compliance, and widespread capillary leakage [2] . Airway inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a primary component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, can lead to various human disorders including acute lung injury by triggering severe inflammation [3] . In animal models, LPS challenge has been shown to promote rapid infiltration of inflammatory cells, consequently resulting in the release of a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP2) [4, 5] . LPS can stimulate many intracellular signaling pathways, in particular mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Mammalian MAPKs include three subfamilies: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK. It has been documented that MAPKs are involved in the inflammatory response of lung injury [6] Severe inflammation is commonly linked to induction of oxidative stress [7] . Oxidative stress usually occurs when there is an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and elimination. Excessive ROS may exacerbate pathological inflammation and tissue damage [8] . Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an important antioxidant enzyme that can be induced by oxidative stress. It has been shown that activation of HO-1 confers protection against LPS-induced acute lung injury in rats [9] . Nitric oxide (NO) generated by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) also contributes to lung inflammatory injury due to oxidative stress [10] . Therefore, identification of therapeutic approaches to treat inflammation and oxidative stress is of importance for acute lung injury/ARDS. Arctigenin, a bioactive component of Arctium lappa (Niubang), has various biological properties including anticancer activity [11] , antioxidant activity [12] , and antiinflammatory activity [13] . A recent study has demonstrated that arctigenin attenuates LPS-induced acute lung injury in rats [14] . However, the underlying mechanism for arctigenin-mediated protective effects remains unclear. Arctigenin has been shown to inhibit LPS-induced iNOS expression and MAPK activation in RAW264.7 macrophages [15, 16] . In light of these findings, this study was designed to check whether the protective effects of arctigenin on LPS-induced acute lung injury are mediated through MAPK signaling.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 160, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 320, "end": 323, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 590, "end": 593, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 890, "end": 893, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 894, "end": 896, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1245, "end": 1248, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1321, "end": 1324, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1525, "end": 1528, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1738, "end": 1741, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1873, "end": 1877, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2146, "end": 2150, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2174, "end": 2178, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2211, "end": 2215, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2315, "end": 2319, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2525, "end": 2529, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2530, "end": 2533, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Male C57BL/6 wild-type mice (8-10 weeks old) were bought from the Experimental Animal Center of Zhengzhou University (Zhengzhou, China).
