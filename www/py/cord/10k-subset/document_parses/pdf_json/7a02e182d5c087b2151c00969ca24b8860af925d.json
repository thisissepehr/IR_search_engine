We have shown that the cytoskeletal passive stiffness of airway smooth muscle (ASM) can be regulated by intracellular signaling pathways, especially those associated with Rho kinase (ROCK). We have also shown that an oscillatory strain reduces the passive stiffness of ASM and its ability to generate force. Here, we investigated the combined effect of inhibiting the ASM contraction with b 2 agonist and decreasing the ASM cytoskeletal stiffness with ROCK inhibitor and/or force oscillation (FO) on the relaxation of contracted ASM. We hypothesize that the ASM relaxation can be synergistically enhanced by the combination of these interventions, because drug-induced softening of the cytoskeleton enhances the FO-induced relaxation and vice versa. Sheep tracheal strips were isotonically contracted to acetylcholine (3 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 M). At the plateau of shortening, b 2 agonist salbutamol (10 \u00c07 M), ROCK inhibitor H1152 (10 \u00c07 M), and FO (square wave, 1 Hz, amplitude 6% maximal active force) were applied either alone or in combination. After adjusting for nonspecific timedependent variation, relengthening by individual interventions with low-dose salbutamol or H1152, or small amplitude FO was not significantly different from zero. However, significant relengthening was observed in all combination treatments. The relengthening was greater than the mathematical sum of relengthening caused by individual treatments thereby demonstrating synergistic relaxation. The ASM stiffness did not change with salbutamol or H1152 treatments, but was lower with FO in combination with H1152.

Ovine tracheal smooth muscle was used. All experimental procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Care and the Biosafety Committee of the University of British Columbia and conformed to the guidelines set out by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Ovine tracheas were obtained from a local abattoir, transported in ice-cold physiological saline solution (modified Krebs solution) to our laboratory, and stored in fresh Krebs solution at 4 C. The experiments were performed within 4 days of obtaining the tracheas. The composition of the Krebs solution was: 118 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 1.2 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 22.5 mM NaHCO 3 , 2 mM MgSO 4 , 2mM CaCl 2 , and 2 g/l dextrose at pH 7.4. Smooth muscle strips devoid of epithelium and loose connective tissue were dissected from the posterior membranous portion of the trachea while being maintained at the in situ length (taken as a reference length, L ref ), i.e., the distance between the two insertion points of the muscle to the cartilage ring under relaxed condition. Aluminum clips were then attached to the ends of the muscle strip. Through these aluminum clips and silk thread, the muscle strip was attached to a force/ length transducer (Duo mode, model 300 C, Aurora Scientific, Inc., Aurora, ON, Canada) with minimal passive resting tension and submerged in 37 C Krebs solution aerated with 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide. Indomethacin (5 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 M) was used to prevent the development of intrinsic tone. Figure 1 schematically illustrates the experimental protocol. Muscle strips were equilibrated with periodic electric field stimulation (60 Hz at selected voltage and current density sufficient to elicit maximal response from the muscle) at 5 min intervals until a steady isometric force was reached. The strips were then stimulated with acetylcholine (ACh, 3 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 M). The resulting active isometric force (F max ) was recorded and used to calculate the isotonic load for the subsequent isotonic contractions elicited to evaluate the relaxing effects of mechanopharmacological interventions. During the isotonic contractions, muscle strips were allowed to shorten maximally and then relengthen while the load was kept constant. Relengthening was evaluated in the presence and absence of either single or combined relaxing interventions. (1) Isotonic shortening: An isotonic load was preset at 30% F max . Muscle strips were stimulated with ACh (3 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 M) and first contracted isometrically until the force reached the preset load when the muscle began to contract isotonically. About 4-5 min later, muscle shortening reached a plateau. The amount of shortening from L ref to plateau was defined as the maximal shortening (MS). After the plateau, while keeping the load constant, different interventions were applied and the length of the muscle strips was monitored for 60 min. (2) Force oscillation: After the isotonic shortening reached a plateau, one of the interventions was FO, where the force was controlled to oscillate around the preset isotonic load. The wave form of FO was chosen to be symmetrical square waves. The frequency was chosen to be 1 Hz. Note, this frequency is not the breathing frequency, but meant to be the frequency of pressure oscillations that would be riding on top of the normal tidal breathing at a much lower frequency. The preliminary data (not shown) indicated that tidal breathing alone had no effect on ASM relaxation compared to time control. Also, in preliminary tests, we found that greater frequencies (2, 4, 5, 10, or 20 Hz) of superimposed pressure oscillation did not result in greater relengthening (data not shown). The amplitude was chosen to be 6% F max such that the amplitude of stretching force was less than what would be exerted with a deep inspiration (see more details in the Results and Discussion sections). Due to the intrinsic thread (which connects the muscle preparation to the measuring device) compliance, FO also resulted in oscillatory stretch of the thread. This length variation due to thread compliance would not affect the accuracy of the evaluation of muscle length hence relengthening, because it did not change the midline around which the length oscillation occurred. However, it would affect the stiffness calculation of the muscle during FO. To measure the resulting length oscillation of the thread, at the end of each experiment, the muscle strip was removed. In its place, the warm wet thread was connected to the stationary rod and the exact same FO was applied to the thread alone at the same preset load. The amplitude of length oscillation of the thread was measured and subtracted from the total length change in the calculation of actual amplitude of length change produced by FO in the muscle strip. length, or elongation (E), normalized by MS. The relengthening due to time alone was subtracted from the total relengthening to obtain the net relengthening due to intervention. (4) Evaluation of synergy: Synergy is defined as the combined effect being greater than the mathematical sum of the individual effects. Relengthening due to combined interventions was compared to the mathematical sum of relengthening due to each individual intervention. For example, the net relengthening of combined salbutamol, H1152, and FO was compared to the mathematical sum of relengthening values due to salbutamol, H1152, and FO alone. This was evaluated at four arbitrarily selected time points (11, 21, 40 , and 60 min) after application of intervention. (5) Measurement of stiffness: Stiffness of the contracted muscle strip, with or without interventions, was calculated by the change in force divided by the corresponding change in length during FO. In interventions where FO was not involved, a brief period of FO (5 s) was applied to the strips at the four time points chosen to evaluate synergy; stiffness was calculated as the ratio of the force amplitude and the resulting length amplitude of the square waves (corrected for thread compliance).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 5471, "end": 5475, "text": "(11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 5476, "end": 5479, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 5480, "end": 5482, "text": "40", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1498, "end": 1506, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Methods"}, {"text": "All data in the figures and Table 1 are presented as mean 6 standard error (SE).

Therefore, one would expect that the combined effect of salbutamol and H1152 would be muscle relaxation and stiffness reduction. However, in the absence of FO, salbutamol and H1152 interventions, collectively or individually, resulted in no reduction in muscle stiffness (Fig. 5(a) ). These surprising results could be due to the low concentrations of the drugs used. The synergistic effect of salbutamol \u00fe H1152 in causing muscle relaxation observed in our experiments, therefore, cannot be explained by mechanisms related to alteration of ASM stiffness. b 2 agonist had been suggested to reduce airway wall stiffness. Ansell et al. [22] proposed that there is a synergistic effect in airway segments between b 2 agonist isoprenaline and breathing maneuvers simulated by fixed transmural pressure oscillations in dilating the airways. The authors suggested that the bronchodilator reduced the stiffness of the airway wall which then allowed the oscillation to induce greater relaxation. Our study first of all showed a trend for an increase in stiffness over time, which is not surprising. In chronically shortened ASM, we observed an increase in the muscle's ability to generate force, which we coined force adaptation [23] . The increase in stiffness with time may be related to this phenomenon. Second, compared to time control at equivalent time points, salbutamol at 10 \u00c07 M did not reduce muscle stiffness. This finding does not contradict that of Ansell et al. because we did not test the same bronchodilator nor at the same concentration. They used doses from 10 \u00c07 to 10 \u00c04 M isoprenaline, and it was only at higher end of the concentration spectrum that isoprenaline enhanced the effect of oscillation. In fact, they showed that the b 2 agonist at 10 \u00c07 M did not increase ASM strain during pressure oscillation. Even with FO, salbutamol at the low concentration of 10 \u00c07 M did not cause a reduction in muscle stiffness (Fig. 5(b) ). However, H1152 with FO, with or without salbutamol, resulted in a significant reduction in muscle stiffness (Fig. 5(b) ). This suggests that the synergistic effects observed in combined interventions that involved H1152 and FO could stem from alterations in cytoskeletal stiffness. It is not clear why H1152 and FO alone did not change muscle stiffness, but the combination did. It could be that the low intensity of each of the intervention alone could not overcome the threshold for stiffness change, but the combination could.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 719, "end": 722, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 723, "end": 726, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1363, "end": 1367, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1950, "end": 1954, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1000, "end": 1010, "text": "(Fig. 5(a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 2660, "end": 2670, "text": "(Fig. 5(b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 2782, "end": 2792, "text": "(Fig. 5(b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Findings from this study suggest that we can use small amplitude of pressure oscillation in combination with drugs to more effectively relax or soften ASM and maintain airway patency without excessive pressure oscillation.

While patients maintain their normal tidal breathing at $0.2 Hz, a high frequency pressure oscillation (1 Hz) would be superimposed on top of the tidal breathing through this device. A notable advantage of this type of therapy is that the low drug doses will likely reduce side-effects and the development of tolerance. To deliver the appropriate pressure oscillation to the lung, a device similar to the CPAP machine could be developed. The disease mechanisms are likely very different for obstructive sleep apnea and asthma, and the positive airway pressure used for treatment of sleep apnea [12] may not be necessary for treating asthma.

No intervention was applied; the change in stiffness, therefore, represents a baseline stiffness with which changes in muscle stiffness due to experimental interventions are compared (see next figure) . Muscle stiffness was corrected for the thread compliance (see text). Data are mean 6 SE. **p < 0.01, compared to time 0, 11p < 0.01, compared to 11 and 21 min time points.
