These can \"emerge\" as new diseases by expanding their geographical range or by jumping species (from plants to plants, or from animals to humans). Emerging diseases place an additional burden on developing countries which are often struggling to manage the diseases they already have. New diseases spread through weather, insects or other vectors, or by the movement of people, animals or goods. This study examines the role of cross-border travel in the spread of diseases. A survey of travelers and of residents along the Malawi-Mozambique border found that most cross it frequently and that they rarely travel empty-handed, often taking plants and animals with them. People also cross borders seeking medical attention. Attempting to limit travel would hamper an already struggling economy, where many people make a living by producing, processing or transporting plants and animals for food. Cross border travel per se may pose slight danger for the spread of diseases, if governments can collaborate on sharing information about the status of diseases within their border.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Emerging diseases are ones that have spread geographically, adapted to additional hosts, changed pathogenesis or are recently recognized (Anderson et al. 2004) .

But a disease that has recently jumped from animals to humans, such as Lyme disease (a bacterium carried from deer and rodents by ticks) is also a new or emerging disease (Wang et al. 1999) . The concept of emerging diseases was first applied to humans in the early 1990s (Lederberg et al. 1992) . It has also been applied to animal diseases, e.g., when livestock diseases spread to wildlife (Daszak et al. 2000) . Wildlife can also play a role in spreading disease among domesticated animals, e.g., foot and mouth disease in Africa (Sumption et al. 2007) , or highly pathogenic avian influenza between wild birds and poultry.

Initiatives under the aegis of the African Union aim to replicate the success of the model of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the US, with improved monitoring and surveillance of infectious disease through \"virtual\" centers such as the East African Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance (EACIDS) or the Southern African Centre for Infectious Disease (SACIDS).

For example, Rugalema et al.

Villagers were quick to lay blame on foreigners and expressed concern that the increasing ease of travel was linked to the spread of disease. Respondents blamed poor regulation (e.g., quarantine, vaccination) by Ugandan and Tanzanian officials for the spread of animal diseases, and the failure to restrict movement for the spread of crop diseases, especially in the vegetative planting material of bananas and cassava. This paper reports the results of a study commissioned in 2009 by the FAO Multi-Partnership Program (FMPP) project \"Analyzing the linkages between population mobility and biosecurity risks to rural livelihoods and food security\" on the movement of people in a sample of districts in Malawi on the border with Mozambique to better understand the risks that travel places on human, livestock and crop health, and to recommend ways of managing those risks. 2 Nearly everyone in southern Malawi makes a living producing, processing or transporting food. Travel is brisk across the border, and for many reasons, sometimes to transport crops, seeds or animals, but even when people make the trip just to visit relatives, plants and animals are frequent travelling companions. The central hypothesis of this study was that many people who had sought refuge in Malawi during the civil war in Mozambique left their children in school in Malawi when they returned to Mozambique to work their old farms, initiating constant crossborder traffic that facilitated the spread of plant, animal and human diseases.

In Mulanje, where most of the best land is used by the tea plantations, some people migrate to Mozambique to farm. It is the reverse in Mwanza, where Mozambicans farm in Malawi.

While humans, crops and livestock all suffer from fungal, bacterial and viral diseases, crops are more vulnerable to new health problems (possibly because there are more species of crops than of livestock) and are by far more likely to be attacked by insects and other arthropod pests.
