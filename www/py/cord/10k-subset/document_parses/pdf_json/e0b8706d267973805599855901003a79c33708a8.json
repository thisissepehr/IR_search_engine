Therefore, Fraser (2007) developed an analytical technique to compute r approximately in households models, later extended in Pellis et al. (2010) . However, this approximate method ignores exactly the two points highlighted above, i.e. those intricacies that result from the interaction of the household structure with the temporal details of the infectivity profile. Matching the same analytically tractable approximation of r is therefore equivalent to matching the same R 0 in the mapping procedure. The contribution of the two factors above is small for peaked unimodal infectious contact interval distributions (generations tend not to overlap) and low within-household infection rates (repeated infectious attempts between the same infective and susceptible are rare; see Pellis et al., 2010, and . Therefore, the discrepancy between matching the same R 0 and the same r widens for increasing within-household infectivity.

Unfortunately, those quantities also depend, in addition to the household composition distribution, on the relative infectivity \u03c6 and susceptibility \u03c8 of children versus adults and also on R 0 (in the case of the SAR, only mildly and indirectly on R 0 , through the computation of the vector v AH h ). In particular, the dependence on \u03c8 would have made the axes in most plots presented in this manuscript non-independent of each other. To improve quantitative understanding of p aa , we report in Supplementary Tables 10 and 11 both the SAR and the within-household fraction F h of total transmission, in the baseline scenario of random mixing (values for more realistic mixing patterns are reported in Supplementary Tables 12 and 13 and commented on in the Supplementary Discussion, Section 2.2.1).

As already mentioned in the main text, one of the most striking feature about the final size in model AH is that increasing the difference in susceptibility between adults and children (by keeping R 0 constant) always decreases the final size. This result is already known for multitype models (Miller, 2007; Andreasen, 2011; Andersson and Britton, 2000, Chapter 6 ), but the same behaviour seems to occur for any fixed amount of within-household transmission. At the same time, shifting transmission from outside to within the household (i.e. increasing p aa while decreasing \u03b2 g so that R 0 remains constant) increases the final size, with the negligible potential exception of extremely high values of p aa . All graphs in Supplementary Figure 5e -h appear in the main text, in Figures 1a, 1d, 1g and 2a . Given that for R 0 = 2 the final size in absence of households and age stratification is roughly 80% of the population, there is more room for it to decrease due to age differences than for it to increase due to higher within-household transmission. This is indeed visible in Supplementary Figure 5e , by moving along the y-axis and x-axis. Similar qualitative considerations apply to the rest of the graph: for example, at \u03c8 = 1, z increases by 10% only over the whole range of p aa , while at \u03c8 = 4 it increases by almost 30%, simply because it has more room to do so. The qualitative behaviour is similar for other values of R 0 (Supplementary Figure  5a and 5i) and \u03c6 (not shown), although at low R 0 (e.g. R 0 = 1.5, Supplementary Figure 5a ) the room for decreasing is smaller than that for increasing, while at high R 0 (e.g. R 0 = 4, Supplementary Figure  5e ) the opposite is true.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 314, "end": 328, "text": "(Miller, 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 329, "end": 345, "text": "Andreasen, 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 346, "end": 384, "text": "Andersson and Britton, 2000, Chapter 6", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 746, "end": 769, "text": "Supplementary Figure 5e", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 801, "end": 826, "text": "Figures 1a, 1d, 1g and 2a", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1105, "end": 1128, "text": "Supplementary Figure 5e", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1476, "end": 1486, "text": "Figure  5a", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1551, "end": 1574, "text": "Supplementary Figure 5a", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1685, "end": 1695, "text": "Figure  5e", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Predicted outputs"}, {"text": "In terms of comparison, we have already observed in the main text that model A and model H always predict, respectively, a lower and higher final size than model AH (Figures 1a, 1d and 1g of main text).

This could however be explained, at least partially, by model A having 4 free parameters (\u03c8, \u03c6, \u03b8 A and \u03b2 A ) and therefore being naturally more flexible than the model H, which has only 2 parameters (\u03b2 H h and \u03b2 H g ). In addition, model A has two parameters (\u03c8 and \u03c6) with the same value as in model AH and is somewhat able to partially capture the household structure via re-estimation of the global assortativity. On the contrary, the ability of model H to capture the age structure is almost unnoticeable, as it is limited to the variation in the household size distribution due to age effects in changing v AH h . Finally, it can be noticed that, because the predictions of models A and H depart from those of model AH in opposite directions, if both of them give accurate predictions, model U must also give accurate predictions and is therefore preferred as simpler.

Its qualitative behaviour is essentially the same as that of the final size: in model AH, the peak incidence decreases with increasing age differences and increases with increasing within-household transmission (at fixed R 0 ). It shows a similar (though milder) feature of having more room to decrease due to age differences than to decrease due to the presence of households. This is somewhat surprising, given that the peak incidence is not capped by any upper bound, as the final size is by the total population.

Note that the duration of a stochastic epidemic is subject to much larger random fluctuations than the final size and peak incidence. As described in the Supplementary Methods, Sections 1.2.8 and 1.5, to reduce the stochastic noise to a minimum, the epidemic starts with n 0 = 50 cases, thus essentially excluding the possibility of early epidemic extinction. Furthermore, to reduce as much as possible the effects of system transients from the initial conditions to the stable exponential growth window, we distribute our n 0 as primary cases in different households and divide them in adults and children according to the components of v AH h . Despite all this watchfulness, some evident stochastic noise is still present (see Supplementary Figure 6a -l, in particular Supplementary Figure 6d ). Note, however, that the attempt to reduce stochastic noise by synchronising the epidemics at the peak and starting with n 0 initial cases have the consequence of making variations in the predicted epidemic time to peak very limited overall (within each of the groups a-c, e-g and i-k in Supplementary Figure 6 , as differences between groups are caused by the difference in R 0 ), because most of the variability is due to random delays in the early epidemic phase.

Global assortativity \u03b8 A estimated for model A from the model mapping procedure, with random mixing (A: \u03b3 = 1, \u03b8 g = 0.5381) and UK-like contact patterns including assortative mixing (B:, \u03b3 = 0.75, \u03b8 g = 0.58) as a function of p aa and \u03c8 for various values of R 0 and \u03c6, for the population of Sierra Leone. The dashed line (also along the y-axis) shows where the assortativity has not changed when households are removed (\u03b8 A = \u03b8 g ). In the white region, no value of \u03b8 A can be found to match the same age-stratified incidence as model AH (see Supplementary Discussion, Section 2.3.3). For the same reason, only the region \u03c8 > 1 is plotted, as no value of \u03b8 A can be found for \u03c8 = 1 when random mixing is assumed (see Supplementary Figure 22 : Mapped assortativity of model A for South Africa, with random mixing and UK-like contact patterns. Global assortativity \u03b8 A estimated for model A from the model mapping procedure, with random mixing (A: \u03b3 = 1, \u03b8 g = 0.4592) and UK-like contact patterns including assortative mixing (B:, \u03b3 = 0.75, \u03b8 g = 0.58) as a function of p aa and \u03c8 for various values of R 0 and \u03c6, for the population of South Africa.

Each plot specifies the level of SAR above which a household structure is necessary for output prediction within a \u03b5 = 1% (A), \u03b5 = 5% (B) and \u03b5 = 10% (C) relative accuracy for Great Britain (left; fraction of children = 22.73%, mean household size = 2.35), South Africa (middle; fraction of children = 45.92%, mean household size = 4.27) and Sierra Leone (right; fraction of children = 53.81%, mean household size = 5.85), for random mixing and UK-like contact patterns (see Supplementary Discussion, Section 2.4 for details). In (D) the coefficients of the rule of thumb (regression coefficient \u03b2 1 and intercept \u03b2 0 ) are plotted against each other, for different populations and accuracy thresholds.
