Numerous clinical studies have reported that surgical oncology patients who receive blood transfusions may have greater risk of postoperative complications, decreased locoregional control, lower disease-free survival, and lower overall survival. 47, 65, 66 More than 150 clinical studies have been published on this topic. 66 Many studies have reported an association between perioperative transfusions and either cancer recurrence or postoperative bacterial infection, but a causal relationship for cancer recurrence has not been established because of the heterogeneity of the studies. 47, 66 Several recent observational studies have provided support for an independent effect of blood transfusion and cancer recurrence. [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] Some of these studies reported a positive association only among subgroups of patients according to tumor stage [67] [68] [69] [70] or when the patient received the blood transfusion relative to surgery. 71 Unfortunately, it is difficult to perform a controlled clinical study that will confirm an independent effect of allogeneic blood transfusion on cancer recurrence. For ethical and logistic reasons, surgical oncology patients cannot be assigned to a ''no-transfusion'' group. Therefore, PAD or allogeneic transfusion alone are commonly used as control groups in clinical trials. [74] [75] [76] Busch et al. concluded that PAD before surgery for colorectal cancer reduced the use of allogeneic blood transfusion, but did not improve recurrence rates and disease-free survival. 74, 75 However, the use of blood transfusion-either allogeneic or autologous-was associated with increased cancer recurrence. Heiss et al. also found no significant difference in disease-free survival after surgery in patients with colorectal cancer who donated blood preoperatively compared with patients who did not. 76 In a multivariate analysis, the investigators reported that allogeneic blood transfusion was associated with a greater than 6-fold increase in the relative risk of tumor recurrence in both treatment groups. Another controlled study by van de Watering et al. determined that patients with colorectal cancer had comparable survival and recurrence rates if they were transfused with leukocyte-depleted allogeneic blood or with packed red blood cells with leukocytes. 77 One possible interpretation of the available evidence is that the need for blood transfusions is simply a marker for sicker patients who are more likely to have worse long-term outcomes, rather than a direct effect of blood transfusion. 66 Regardless of whether the association is independent of or dependent on other factors, the use of allogeneic blood in surgical oncology has been repeatedly associated with poor postoperative outcomes.
