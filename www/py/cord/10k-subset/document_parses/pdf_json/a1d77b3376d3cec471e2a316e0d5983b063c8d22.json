            "text": "Lethal mutagenesis is a broad-spectrum antiviral strategy that employs mutagenic nucleoside analogs to exploit the high mutation rate and low mutational tolerance of many RNA viruses. Studies of mutagen-resistant viruses have identified determinants of replicative fidelity and the importance of mutation rate to viral population dynamics. We have previously demonstrated the effective lethal mutagenesis of influenza A virus using three nucleoside analogs as well as the virus's high genetic barrier to mutagen resistance. Here, we investigate the mutagen-resistant phenotypes of mutations that were enriched in drug-treated populations. We find that PB1 T123A has higher replicative fitness than the wild type, PR8, and maintains its level of genome production during 5-fluorouracil (2,4-dihydroxy-5-fluoropyrimidine) treatment. Surprisingly, this mutagen-resistant variant also has an increased baseline rate of C-to-U and G-to-A mutations. A second drug-selected mutation, PA T97I, interacts epistatically with PB1 T123A to mediate high-level mutagen resistance, predominantly by limiting the inhibitory effect of nucleosides on polymerase activity. Consistent with the importance of epistatic interactions in the influenza virus polymerase, our data suggest that nucleoside analog resistance and replication fidelity are strain dependent. Two previously identified ribavirin {1-[(2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)oxolan-2-yl]-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide} resistance mutations, PB1 V43I and PB1 D27N, do not confer drug resistance in the PR8 background, and the PR8-PB1 V43I polymerase exhibits a normal baseline mutation rate. Our results highlight the genetic complexity of the influenza A virus polymerase and demonstrate that increased replicative capacity is a mechanism by which an RNA virus can counter the negative effects of elevated mutation rates. IMPORTANCE RNA viruses exist as genetically diverse populations. This standing genetic diversity gives them the potential to adapt rapidly, evolve resistance to antiviral therapeutics, and evade immune responses. Viral mutants with altered mutation rates or mutational tolerance have provided insights into how genetic diversity arises and how it affects the behavior of RNA viruses. To this end, we identified variants within the polymerase complex of influenza virus that are able to tolerate drugmediated increases in viral mutation rates. We find that drug resistance is highly dependent on interactions among mutations in the polymerase complex. In contrast to other viruses, influenza virus counters the effect of higher mutation rates primarily by maintaining high levels of genome replication. These findings suggest the importance of maintaining large population sizes for viruses with high mutation rates and show that multiple proteins can affect both mutation rate and genome synthesis.",

            "text": "I nfluenza A virus (IAV) remains a persistent health threat due to its high rate of evolution (1) . This high rate of evolution is attributable, in part, to the virus's very high mutation rate (2) (3) (4) (5) . Influenza A virus rapidly acquires antigenic changes and antiviral resistance, which limit the effectiveness of vaccines and antiviral drugs (6, 7) . As in many RNA viruses, influenza A virus's low fidelity is due to the absence of proofreading and repair mechanisms during genome replication (8) (9) (10) . We have previously estimated the IAV mutation rate to be greater than 1 \u03eb 10 \u03ea4 mutations per nucleotide per RNA strand replicated, which suggests that approximately 2 new mutations are introduced into every newly synthesized genome (2) (3) (4) (11) (12) (13) . As a result, IAVs exist as swarms of distinct genetic variants, which provide a rich substrate for natural selection of adaptive mutations.",

Lethal mutagenesis is an antiviral strategy that utilizes nucleoside analogues to increase a virus's mutation rate and the frequency of deleterious or lethal mutations (16, 17) . The effectiveness of lethal mutagenesis has been demonstrated in many viral systems, including poliovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and IAV (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) . A hallmark of lethal mutagenesis is a reduction in virus specific infectivity due to the increased genesis of genomes that do not encode a functional complement of viral proteins.

In most cases, mutagen-resistant variants encode polymerases that exhibit increased replication fidelity, and characterization of these mutants has elucidated the molecular mechanisms governing mutation rate.

This result did not preclude the possibility that there were resistance mutations present at a low level within these populations or that their phenotypic effect was masked by the impact of mutations elsewhere in the genome. Consistent with this hypothesis, next-generation sequencing revealed a number of mutations that were shared among drug-passaged populations and that did not achieve fixation (23) . We identified candidate resistance mutations in the PB2, PB1, and PA open reading frames based on their presence in mutagenpassaged viral populations and absence in either the starting population or control populations passaged without drug treatment. Three nonsynonymous mutations met these criteria. The PB1 T123A mutation was found in all three 5FU-passaged populations at frequencies of 34, 31, and 8%. The PA T97I mutation was found in all three ribavirin-passaged populations at frequencies of 88, 55, and 11%. We also identified the PB1 M645I mutation at frequencies of 90, 14, and 1% in the same ribavirin-passaged populations. The ribavirin-resistant mutation PB1 V43I was not found in any of the populations, and PB1 D27N was only found in one ribavirin-passaged population at a frequency of 3%. We introduced each of these five mutations into a clean PR8 genetic background. We also generated the PB1 T123A PA T97I and PB1 M645I PA T97I double mutants. The PB1 M645I PA T97I double mutant was identified in our ribavirin-passaged viral populations.

The other mutation enriched in ribavirin-passaged populations, PB1 M645I, did not alter sensitivity to any of the three nucleoside analogs.

In the absence of mutagenic drug, we identified a range of fitness effects among the polymerase mutants ( Fig. 2A) . The PB1 T123A virus was more fit than the WT, even out of the drug, and released more genomes into the supernatant early in replication than either WT or the other mutants (Fig. 2B ). Both PB1 M645I and PA T97I were essentially neutral. The PB1 1, and quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure the genome copy number in supernatants. The data were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA, and mutant viruses were compared with the WT using Sidak's multiple-comparison test. (C) The experiment was performed as in panel B, except that genome copy number in the cellular fraction was measured.

Consistent with the lower fitness of this mutant, it produced fewer genomes than the wild type (Fig. 2B ). The rate of genomic RNA production in cells for each of the mutants largely mirrored the rate of release into the cell-free fraction, suggesting that our measurements of viral RNA in supernatants reflect the kinetics of RNA synthesis (Fig. 2C ).

This phenotype is similar to that of the ribavirin-resistant FMDV mutant 3D M296I (34, 51) and may reflect increased selectivity against misincorporation of 5FU. Our finding of reduced mutagenesis, however, seems inconsistent with the specific infectivity decrease we observe upon drug treatment. This may indicate that 5FUmediated increases in the two most common mutation classes (A to G and U to C) are the main contributor to the observed decrease in specific infectivity with drug treatment. The most likely mechanism of resistance appears to be through its increase in replicative fitness in the absence of drug (Fig. 2) . Importantly, the mutant also maintained its genomic output in the presence of 5FU, a phenotype augmented by PA T97I (Fig. 6 [see below] ). The fact that PB1 T123A did not counter the detrimental effects of ribavirin and 5-azacytidine suggests that the resistance phenotype mediated by PB1 T123A is not broadly applicable to other nucleoside analogs.",

This mutant, PA T97I, exhibited fitness and genome production phenotypes that were very similar to those of the wild type. Interestingly, this mutant was selected during ribavirin treatment but was resistant to 5FU and not ribavirin. This mutant closely mirrored PB1 T123A in terms of its smaller decreases in infectious titer upon treatment with 5FU. Unlike PB1 T123A, the baseline and 5FU-induced mutation rates of PA T97I are similar to those of the wild-type virus for all transition mutation classes. This mutant also exhibited decreases in genome production and release during 5FU treatment that were similar to those of the WT. It is currently unclear how PA T97I mediates its resistance to 5FU. Since its resistance was more pronounced at higher concentrations of 5FU, it is possible that the technical limitations in the amount of 5FU we could use for accurate mutation rate measurements prevented us from observing a subtle phenotype.",

Serendipitously, we found that this double mutant exhibited the most dramatic 5FU resistance phenotype of any of the mutants we tested. These two mutations led to a reduced fitness phenotype characteristic of reciprocal sign epistasis; the combination of a mutant with increased fitness (PB1 T123A) with a neutral mutant (PA T97I) led to a double mutant with very low fitness and significantly reduced genomic RNA output. At the concentrations of 5FU used for selection of resistant variants, this double mutant has a fitness lower than that of the wild type, even though it is highly resistant to the drug. This finding likely explains why it did not arise within our experimentally evolved populations. The double mutant virus had a nearly identical spectrum of transition mutation rates to the wild-type virus, and the double mutation only slightly mitigated the mutagenic effect of 5FU on C-to-U mutations. Drug resistance seems to be driven primarily by maintaining high genomic output during 5FU treatment, an effect that appears to be more pronounced than that of the PB1 T123A single mutant (Fig. 6) . Treatment with a nucleoside analog led to almost no reduction in the number of genome segments that are released from infected cells. This mechanism allows for more infectious viral particles to be produced than in the wild type despite similar levels of mutagenesis and specific infectivity decreases.",

Previously, PB1 D27N was identified as a mutation that limited ribavirin inhibition of RNA synthesis in a replicon system (43, 44) . We find that this mutant is not resistant to ribavirin or other mutagenic nucleoside analogs in a replication-competent PR8 virus. Additionally, we found that the mutagen resistance and fidelity phenotype of PB1 V43I is strain dependent. This mutation, which mediates ribavirin resistance in the A/Wuhan/ 359/95 H3N2 and A/Vietnam/1203/1204 H5N1 strains, is sensitive to drug in the PR8 genetic background (22) . The PB1 V43I mutant, which has been suggested to be a fidelity variant even in the PR8 background (45), shows no difference in the rate of transition mutations in PR8. These findings suggest that there are likely to be epistatic interactions governing polymerase activity and fidelity in influenza virus and that the ability of one virus to evolve resistance to a mutagen may not be reflective of how another strain evolves in the face of the same selective pressure.",

We have previously shown that the decreases in specific infectivity associated with nucleoside analog treatment (up to 10-fold) are much smaller than the effect of these compounds on infectious titer output (\u03fe1,000-fold) (23) . The identification of resistant variants that maintain genome output with little impact on specific infectivity suggests that inhibition of RdRp activity is the main mechanism of action for 5FU.

Increased genome production and release will lead to larger populations, and strong selection will quickly purge the large numbers of mutants with lower fitness, leaving the most fit sequence to dominate the mutant spectrum. This \"safety in numbers\" phenomenon leads to population-level mutational robustness, even in the setting of individual-level hypersensitivity.

SuperScript III RT/Platinum Taq (Thermo 2574030) was used with the primers 5=-GACCRATCCTGTCACCTCTGAC-3= and 5=-AGGGCATTYTGGACAAAKCGTCTA-3=, and the TaqMan probe 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-TGCAGTCCT CGCTCACTGGGCACG-3= with Blackhole Quencher 1 with an annealing temperature of 55\u00b0C for M segment copy number measurement. Quantification of cDNA copy number based on threshold cycle (C T ) values was performed using standard curves from 10-fold dilutions of plasmid containing the M gene of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1. The ratio of the infectious titer per milliliter to the genome copy number per milliliter is the specific infectivity of the sample.",

Twenty-four wells containing 1.2 \u03eb 10 4 MDCK-HA cells were infected with 400 TCID 50 of influenza viruses encoding mutant \u0394HA-GFP segments in viral medium. Supernatants were transferred to black 96-well plates (6005182; PerkinElmer) containing 1.5 \u03eb 10 4 MDCK cells and 50 l of viral medium at 17 to 23 h postinfection, depending on the mutation class and drug treatment. Two wells were infected with virus equivalent to the amount used to initially infect the parallel cultures. These wells were used to determine N i (initial population size) in the mutation rate calculation. After 14 h, cells were fixed using 2% formaldehyde for 20 min. Cells were rinsed with PBS and permeabilized using 0.1% Triton-X-100 for 8 min. After rinsing again, nonspecific antibody binding sites were blocked using 2% BSA in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) for 1 h. Cells were stained with 1:5,000 Hoechst (33342; Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1:400 anti-GFP-Alexa 647 conjugate (A31852; Life Technologies, Inc.) diluted in 2% BSA in PBS-T for 1 h. After three washes with PBS-T, the plates were sealed with black tape prior to removal of the final wash. Plates were imaged using an ImageXpress Micro (Molecular Dynamics) using DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), Cy5, and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-specific filter cubes with a \u03eb4-magnification lens. The entire surface area of each well was imaged using four nonoverlapping quadrants. MetaXpress version 6 software (Molecular Dynamics) was used to count cellular nuclei and antibody-stained cells. Cells expressing fluorescent GFP were manually counted from the collected images (13) .",

If the number of green cells in a culture was greater than 0.8 (N f /N i ), it was removed from the calculation because it likely contained a preexisting fluorescent revertant in the inoculum. Cultures with this many green cells were extremely rare due to the use of a small inoculum (N i ). The null class fluctuation test measurement is most precise when P 0 is between 0.1 and 0.7. As a result of lower titers from drug-treated viral cultures, not all of our measurements fell within this range. Replicates for which P 0 was greater than 0.7 are indicated in the mutation rate figures (Fig. 3 and 4) .",
