The VEE complex alphaviruses are classified into six subtypes, designated I to VI, and consist of 9 species [2] , of which subtype I contains the veterinary and medically important VEE virus (VEEV) ( Table 1) . Historically, the VEE complex subtypes I-VI were defined by serological analysis, and this nomenclature has persisted. However, the advent of sequencing resulted in several viruses now being reclassified as distinct species. For example, subtype IF is genetically distinct from the remainder of the subtype I viruses and is now classified as the species Mosso das Pedras virus. Most VEE complex viruses have enzootic cycles where they circulate between wild animals, generally rodents and mosquitoes, particularly Culex (Melanoconion) spp. mosquito vectors. With the exception of VEEV subtype II, VEE complex viruses are geographically distributed throughout Central and South America. VEEV subtype II is found only in Florida and is usually transmitted by Culex cedeci mosquitoes. The recent appearance for the first time of Culex (Melanoconion) species in southern Florida [3] underscores the continuing threat of emergence, possibly enhanced by climate change, which also increases the potential for other VEEV subtypes to spread northwards and establish enzootic transmission cycles. Although many VEE complex viruses have not been implicated in human disease, those that are associated with human disease (VEEV) can cause acute, often severe febrile illness that may progress to encephalitis, causing severe human morbidity and mortality [4] . Patients who survive encephalitis are often left with permanent neurologic sequelae, and the cost for treatment and long-term care related to a single case can be several million dollars [5] . In addition to VEEV (subtype I), which cases the majority of the encephalitis cases within the VEE subtype, subtype II Everglades virus (EVEV), which is found only in Florida, can cause neurologic disease in humans [6] and equids [7] .

Subtypes ID and IE comprise enzootic/endemic strains that circulate continuously in forests and swamps of northern South America, Central America and Mexico and cause a large burden of endemic disease from direct spillover [10] . The remaining VEEV subtypes, IAB and IC, comprise epizootic/epidemic strains that are associated with periodic equineamplified outbreaks that result in severe disease in equids and extensive spillover to humans [11] . These outbreaks can spread from South America as far north as the southern United States [12, 13] , resulting in up to hundreds-of-thousands of cases over a period of months to a few years. Prior to the 1980s, VEE epizootics involving high case-fatality rates were frequently recorded. Because horses have been an important component of the local agricultural economies within many Latin American regions, VEE has often had a sizeable economic impact as well as a direct effect on public and veterinary health [14] . Recent outbreaks during the 1990s in Venezuela, Colombia and Mexico have demonstrated the potential for VEEV to re-emerge periodically from enzootic progenitors [15] [16] [17] [18] . The emergence of VEEV into an epidemic/ epizootic form has been associated with specific mutations that arise in the VEEV envelope glycoprotein 2 (E2) gene of enzootic subtype ID or IE strains. These mutations result in the addition of positively charged amino acid changes on the surface of the virion spikes [19] that give rise to increased virulence and viremia in equids [20, 21] and sometimes enhanced infection of epidemic vector mosquitoes such as Aedes (Ochlerotatus) taeniorhynchus [22] . The higher viremia levels in equids can lead to infection of mosquitoes that are not normally involved in enzootic circulation [23] , which can then result in spillover infections of humans and other domestic animals. The phylogenetic characteristics of the VEE complex have been studied for several decades, recently focusing on structural protein gene sequences [24] [25] [26] [27] . These studies support the hypothesis that the IAB and IC subtypes arise from mutations in enzootic ID strains that result in the acquisition of epizootic/epidemic characteristics [19, 20, 28] .

To test our hypothesis that, like other ancient RNA viruses [48] [49] [50] , dating estimates may be biased in the VEE complex due to the presence of strong purifying selection, we employed a branch-site random effects likelihood (BSREL) approach to determine the extent to which branch lengths (and tMRCAs) were underestimated by standard models of nucleotide evolution. By moving up through the VEE complex phylogeny in an iterative process, we removed the most basal lineages and compared total tree length optimized under BSREL and GTR+\u0393 4 , thereby identifying subtrees whose branch lengths did not expand under BSREL compared with a standard nucleotide model (GTR+\u0393 4 ) (Figs 1 & 2) . We assert that it is these subtrees, which were not underestimated by GTR+\u0393 4 , whose tMRCA can be reliably inferred by standard Bayesian molecular clock dating (e.g. BEAST) (Fig 2) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 89, "end": 93, "text": "[54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 94, "end": 97, "text": "55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 218, "end": 222, "text": "[48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 223, "end": 226, "text": "49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 289, "end": 293, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 294, "end": 298, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 299, "end": 303, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 905, "end": 917, "text": "(Figs 1 & 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1094, "end": 1101, "text": "(Fig 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Phylogenetic analysis of the VEE complex strains"}, {"text": "As we could not generate a fully resolved MCC tree for the entire VEE complex, two trees were generated for subtypes IAB/IC/ID and for subtypes IE.

From the phylogeny we were able to infer that circulation of VEEV may have been present initially in Panama, with a subsequent introduction into Peru. The exact mechanism of introduction into Peru is not understood; the enzootic cycle of VEEV involves rodents and mosquitoes that have limited geographic range, suggesting other mechanisms of transport such as birds may be occasionally be involved in virus movement. The presence of Peruvian sequences in two distinct lineages suggests that there have been at least two independent introductions. Exclusion of VEEV subtypes III-VI and the lack of isolates from countries intermediate between Panama and Peru will therefore limit the possibility of fully resolving the ancestral dispersal of these viruses. As in previous analyses, our results confirm that the IAB strains group together with strain Hoja Redonda, isolated in Peru in 1942, which is basal in the group. Previous partial sequencing and analysis of these strains suggested that some of the IAB outbreaks were a result of incompletely inactivated vaccines [27] . We were able to corroborate this finding using full genome strains that showed tight genetic distance (96.08-99.23%), and no identified ID progenitors (i.e. strains that are genetically related but lack the defining E2 mutations that are associated with the IAB subtypes), although this could be due to inaccurate sampling.

The main VEEV IE lineage is subdivided into two clades: a widely dispersed group with strains from Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Mexico (Pacific Coast lineage) and a group with more limited dispersal circulating mainly in Mexico (Gulf Coast lineage). As is expected of a rodent-hosted arbovirus, there is very little spread among countries and the dispersal within the IE subtype appears to occur between neighboring countries, presumably reflecting the limited mobility of rodents and mosquitoes (Fig 4) . Given the limited number of countries represented in the IE phylogeny and the lack of recent sampling in most countries, it is hard to draw further conclusions about the historical spread of this subtype within Central America.

This finding was significantly different from an expected, random distribution throughout the VEEV genome. It is possible that the preponderance of structural protein substitutions reflects adaptation to different mosquito vectors. Subtype ID strains are vectored by at least three mosquito species: Cx. (Melanoconion) adamesi, Cx. (Mel.) vomerifer and Cx. (Mel.) pedroi [63] , whereas the subtype IE strains appear to be more specialized and vectored nearly exclusively by Cx. (Mel.) taeniopus [64] .
