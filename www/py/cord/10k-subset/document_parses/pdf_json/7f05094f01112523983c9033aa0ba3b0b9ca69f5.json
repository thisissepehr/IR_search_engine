ERBs develop a productive MARV infection with low viremia and shedding but no overt disease, suggesting this virus is efficiently controlled by ERB antiviral responses. This dynamic would contrast with humans, where MARV-mediated interferon (IFN) antagonism early in infection is thought to contribute to the severe, often fatal disease. The newly-annotated ERB genome and transcriptome have now enabled us to use a custom-designed NanoString nCounter ERB CodeSet in conjunction with RNA-seq to investigate responses in a MARV-infected ERB cell line. Both transcriptomic platforms correlated well and showed that MARV inhibited the antiviral program in ERB cells, while an IFN antagonism-impaired MARV was less efficient at suppressing the response gene induction, phenotypes previously reported for primate cells. Interestingly, and despite the expansion of IFN loci in the ERB genome, neither MARV showed specific induction of almost any IFN gene. However, we detected an upregulation of putative, unannotated ERB antiviral paralogs, as well as an elevated basal expression in uninfected ERB cells of key antiviral genes.",

            "text": "Bats are the second-largest order of mammals on Earth and inhabit diverse biotopes worldwide. In recent years, many bat species have been recognized as reservoir hosts for a wide array of viruses [1, 2] . Contact between infected bats and other animals occasionally produces spillover zoonoses that can be highly pathogenic. Among the most notorious emerging pathogens linked to bats are filoviruses, including Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) [3] . Both viruses cause severe diseases in humans and non-human primates (NHPs) with high case fatality rates [4] . Recently, ecological and laboratory efforts have identified the Egyptian rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus, ERB) as a natural reservoir for Marburg viruses [5] [6] [7] . As expected for a viral reservoir, both natural and experimental MARV infection of ERBs cause measurable, low-level viremia and viral shedding but without overt symptoms [8] [9] [10] [11] . In contrast, lethal filoviral diseases in primates are thought to be driven by a strong virus antagonism of host innate immune responses early in infection, particularly interferon (IFN) responses, impairing the host entry into an effective antiviral state to control viral replication [12, 13] . This antagonism is controlled by the activities of the EBOV and MARV protein VP35, in concert with either EBOV VP24 or MARV VP40 [14] [15] [16] . Protein-based studies have suggested that MARV VP35 is overall less inhibitory than EBOV VP35 [14, 17] , while the MARV infection in vitro suppresses the immune response gene expression to varying degrees dependent on the strain, cell type, and assay [17, 18] . However, analogous, antagonism-specific lesions in VP35 of both recombinant EBOV and MARV have been demonstrated to strongly ablate the blockade of immune response and viral growth in vitro, with the VP35-mutant EBOV also showing decreased pathological response in vivo [19] . The similar lack of virulence in ERBs infected naturally with wild-type MARV begets the hypothesis that these animals co-evolved with the virus and have antiviral mechanisms within their innate immune response that temper MARV replication, subsequently preventing the severe disease. Consistent with this hypothesis, the IFNA genes were reported to be constitutively expressed in the Australian black flying fox (Pteropus alecto), an IFN state proposed to explain how this and possibly other bat species might coexist with resident viruses asymptomatically [20] . Unfortunately, studies of ERB immunology and host-virus interactions in vitro or in vivo have been limited due to a paucity of ERB-specific reagents. However, in recent years, efforts to expand this toolkit have led to the establishment of immortalized ERB-derived cell lines [21] , experimental bat colonies and an annotated ERB genome and transcriptome [22, 23] . These advances now pave the way for a more rigorous investigation of ERB antiviral systems.",

In contrast, the other report [18] found little antiviral gene induction in filovirus-infected ERB cells. While informative and useful, these previous studies used either EBOV, for which ERBs are not a natural host, or a human MARV isolate, which may have adaptations for optimal growth in humans. To address the effect that the MARV infection has on antiviral gene expression in natural host cells, we infected an ERB-derived cell line with a recombinant MARV derived from a wild-caught ERB isolate [24] . In parallel, we investigated a recombinant mutant MARV (MARV VP35mut) known to have a diminished IFN antagonist activity in primate cells [25] . Our goal was to determine if (1) ERB cells could mount an effective antiviral gene program in response to a MARV infection, in either the presence or absence of immunomodulatory mechanisms by VP35, and (2) if so, how this profile might contrast with those reported previously for primate cell infections. We assessed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using two transcriptomic platforms-RNA-seq and NanoString nCounter-the latter for which we developed a custom CodeSet of 221 ERB gene probes. Strikingly, analyses with both platforms revealed that, in our ERB cell line, the MARV infection almost completely blocked the immune gene stimulation, whereas MARV VP35mut led to the upregulation of many response genes, in keeping with the previously-described effects for primate cells. Interestingly, we also observed a marked lack of MARV-mediated IFN gene expression, induction of putative paralogs of novel, unannotated immune genes, and an enhanced basal expression of critical antiviral genes. Our findings suggest that, at least for this cell line and contrary to the leading hypothesis, the antiviral gene upregulation may not account for the difference in virulence between MARV-infected ERBs and primates.",

These two techniques have been shown to correlate well in other human, NHP, and rodent studies. A differential host gene expression (DGE) analysis was performed on the two platform datasets in a pairwise manner between each virus infection condition versus control replicates. First, host DEGs identified by both platforms were plotted against each other to determine the data correlation. Analysis of each condition and time point resulted in Pearson's r values above 0.92, indicating a strong correlation ( Figure 1 ). We exempted MARV WT from this analysis because surprisingly only one gene at one time point (24 hpi) was shared between platforms due to an unexpected lack of RoNi antiviral gene induction described further below. Next, we compared the total number of DEGs obtained using either or both platforms to assess sensitivity differences and CodeSet limitations. It was anticipated that RNA-seq would identify far more overall DEGs, given the finite amount of gene probes in our ERB CodeSet ( Figure 2 , Supplementary Files S1 and S3). Regardless, most DEGs detected by nCounter overlapped with those found by RNA-seq, indicating that nCounter performs comparably to RNA-seq for any genes represented in a CodeSet ( Figure 2 ). However, a limited number of DEGs were identified solely by nCounter, perhaps a consequence of the differing biochemistries with which each platform records the transcripts or how each defines the DEGs ( Figure 2B , Supplementary File S5). Finally, also as anticipated, both platforms showed that SeV positive control infection induced the most DEGs of the three viruses. The majority of DEGs obtained for either MARV were found among these SeV DEGs (Figure 2A , Supplementary Files S1-S4).",

These two techniques have been shown to correlate well in other human, NHP, and rodent studies. A differential host gene expression (DGE) analysis was performed on the two platform datasets in a pairwise manner between each virus infection condition versus control replicates. First, host DEGs identified by both platforms were plotted against each other to determine the data correlation. Analysis of each condition and time point resulted in Pearson's r values above 0.92, indicating a strong correlation ( Figure 1 ). We exempted MARV WT from this analysis because surprisingly only one gene at one time point (24 hpi) was shared between platforms due to an unexpected lack of RoNi antiviral gene induction described further below. Next, we compared the total number of DEGs obtained using either or both platforms to assess sensitivity differences and CodeSet limitations. It was anticipated that RNA-seq would identify far more overall DEGs, given the finite amount of gene probes in our ERB CodeSet ( Figure 2 , Supplementary Files S1 and S3). Regardless, most DEGs detected by nCounter overlapped with those found by RNA-seq, indicating that nCounter performs comparably to RNA-seq for any genes represented in a CodeSet ( Figure 2 ). However, a limited number of DEGs were identified solely by nCounter, perhaps a consequence of the differing biochemistries with which each platform records the transcripts or how each defines the DEGs ( Figure 2B , Supplementary File S5). Finally, also as anticipated, both platforms showed that SeV positive control infection induced the most DEGs of the three viruses. The majority of DEGs obtained for either MARV were found among these SeV DEGs (Figure 2A , Supplementary Files S1-S4). ",

The top ten were dominated by genes from all three IFN types and by multiple IRFs, as expected for a virus with diminished VP35 IFN antagonist activity. Additionally present were ACKR2, a chemokine receptor for CCL ligands such as CCL5/RANTES, and IL1RN, an inhibitor of IL1, which is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by activated macrophages. Both predicted regulators had negative z-scores. Positive predicted regulators included canonical IFN induction players such as MAVS, TLR3, and IFN signaling players STAT1 and STAT2; additional relevant negative predicted regulators included MAPK1, STAT3, and TRIM24, the last of which plays an inhibitory role on STAT signaling. At early time points, most of the top predicted upstream regulators for MARV VP35mut were the same, and in a similar rank order, although IL1RN became a stronger hit over time ( Figure 4B , Figure S3B ). Conversely, RIG-I, among the earliest and most critical regulators of IFN induction, was the second highest-scoring prediction at 3 hpi and 8 hpi, but disappeared from the top 20 by 24 hpi, in keeping with its role as an antiviral response pathway initiator ( Figure 4B , Figure S3B ).",

Canonical pathway genes such as RIG-I, IFIH1, EIF2AK2/PKR, MX1, and STAT1 were induced by SeV ( Figure S4B ). MARV VP35mut induced most of the same targets by 24 hpi, with the exceptions of TRIM25 and UBE2L6 (an E2 ligase gene). The expression of certain genes by MARV VP35mut earlier than SeV extended to several ISGylation regulators, including ISG15 itself, RIG-I, EIF2AK2/PKR, UBA7 (an E1 ligase), and USP18 (the ISG15 processing peptidase). Taken together, our findings suggest that the IID mutation of VP35 abrogates much of the MARV immune response antagonism in infected RoNi cells, as previously observed for primate cells [25] .

Many of these unannotated or expanded genes were found to be DEGs after the analysis of our RNA-seq dataset ( Figure S5 , Supplementary File S3). These locus tag DEGs were categorized by the NCBI eukaryotic genome annotation pipeline as Ig lambda-, HLA class I/IIor IFNL3-like genes, as well as several antiviral response-related or uncharacterized genes. Many of the locus tag DEGs appear to be paralogs of expanded immune genes, including canonical antiviral genes such as MX1, OAS3, ISG20, IRF4, and IFIT1. Interestingly, several genes, like IFNL, MX2, and PARP14, had multiple distinct copies detected. These putative, noncanonical immune gene paralogs have not been functionally described, but could contribute to the ERB tolerance to viral infection.",

We find that MARV WT infections strongly suppresses antiviral responses in RoNi cells, while infection with IFN antagonism-deficient MARV VP35mut results in a significant antiviral gene expression. The results highlight the immunosuppressive role of MARV VP35 and are equivalent to those observed previously in primate cells. Strikingly, the antiviral gene upregulation in MARV VP35mut-infected RoNi cells occurs amid a near-absent upstream IFN induction. We also report the differential expression for several novel putative antiviral gene paralogs as well as uncharacterized genes. Finally, compared to similar human cell types, we observed an enhanced basal expression of several genes that may be involved in ERB antiviral activities.",

We designed the first known ERB CodeSet with 240 host response, viral, and reference genes and compared its performance to RNA-seq. Indeed, even with a CodeSet comprising only~1% of the annotated ERB genome, we obtained a comprehensive picture of the in vitro antiviral gene program occurring in MARV-infected ERB cells.

Instead, we discovered that primate cell-like antiviral gene suppression by MARV also occurs in RoNi cells. Our results were largely concordant with previous findings in MARV-infected ERB cells [18] . However, the authors of that study also found some key antiviral response genes apparently deregulated at certain time points, including RIG-I, multiple STAT genes, HERC5, and MX1, which we did not detect. Another ERB cell-based study by Kuzmin et al. had even more divergent results, as they detected a strong response gene induction by a human MARV isolate, including many critical antiviral genes such as IFIT2, MX2, and IRF9 [17] . Further, when using the same bat isolate-derived MARV virus as in our study to infect RoNi/7 cells, they reported a 100-fold upregulation of IFIT1 via qPCR. While the experimental design between their publication and ours appears similar, we do note that usage of a different bat cell line, techniques for the rescue and propagation of virus (for instance, unnecessarily freeze-thawing infected cells), and/or differences in how transcriptomic analyses and qPCR-based assays were performed could each be responsible for the described discrepancies.",

As MARV VP35mut is known to lack VP35-mediated IFN antagonism and be attenuated for growth in vitro in primate cells [14, 25] , we did not expect a lower viral gene expression by the WT virus in RoNi cells. However, this lower MARV WT expression is unlikely to account for the observed absence of ERB responses, as MARV WT at 24 hpi shows a greater viral expression than does MARV VP35mut at 8 hpi, while still clearly showing a lack of response gene induction. Further, many MARV WT DEGs at 24 hpi that are not antiviral-related coincide with those found for SeV, which simultaneously maintained a stimulation of an active immune response. This indicates that RoNi transcriptomic profiles are due to the protein activity of each virus rather than due to differences in viral gene expression.",

This could be due to the suppression by other MARV proteins. MARV matrix protein VP40 is also a known IFN antagonist, blocking the JAK1 activation of downstream IFN signaling [14, 16] , and a putative MARV GP immunomodulatory domain has yet-unknown effects in ERBs [38] . As with VP35, efforts to define the roles and functions of these other viral proteins in infected ERBs will be insightful. Lastly, while the MARV VP35mut response phenotypes in RoNi cells were largely similar to those previously reported in primate cells, we did not expect the absence of IFN gene induction. It remains speculative as to how these responses might occur, but there is a precedent for noncanonical, IFN-independent antiviral gene upregulation. Such novel pathways could involve interactions with IRF1, IRF3, and IRF7, which can function in lieu of IFNs [39] [40] [41] . We must also recognize that the current \"canonical\" IPA is based on well-studied human responses and pathways, and may not reflect uncharacterized, potentially-unique ERB pathways, factors or interactions.",

ISG15 may restrict MARV VP40 by an analogous mechanism. Inhibition of budding in RoNi cells could help explain the higher viral gene counts for MARV VP35mut, as this virus greatly induces ISG15, potentially confining more immature virus within cells. Regarding additional relevant pathways, RNASEL, an OAS-regulated enzyme that targets and degrades foreign dsRNA was found to be a key component of antiviral responses in IFN-treated P. alecto cells [45] . However, we saw only a marginal induction of RNASEL in SeV-infected RoNi cells at 24 hpi, even with strong OAS gene stimulation at all time points, and no upregulation by either MARV virus. Other, more highly-induced immune genes may play bigger roles than RNASEL in the ERB antiviral response. Interestingly, our data also generated ERB-specific response genes that have not been previously identified or annotated. These locus tag genes include putative paralogs for OAS2, MX2, IFIT1 and, especially, PARP14, which had up to seven upregulated at once. The evolutionary expansion of these novel ERB genes and respective roles that any resultant protein products play in host defense or other processes will be a promising avenue for future molecular studies.",

            "text": "Finally, we noted an elevated basal expression of many response genes in uninfected RoNi cells, including ISG20, IFNAR2, and STAT3, compared to the collated data from related human cell types. For example, the resting RNASEL transcription was significantly higher than in the human dataset. We speculate that this gene and others could exist in a basally \"induced\" state in RoNi cells. This may explain why some genes, like RNASEL, showed a muted stimulation even during a robust response, as their promoters were already active. Another gene with enhanced basal expression was ISG15, which, in this case, might be at least partially IRF-dependent. In human cells, IRFs can weakly and transiently transactivate ISG15 without IFN signaling [46, 47] . However, in RoNi cells, higher IFNAR levels, especially soluble IFNAR2-a putative potentiator of quicker more sustained responses-could enable strong IFN-independent, IRF-mediated ISG15 induction, allowing cells to engage a core aspect of the ISGylation pathway in advance of the infection [48] . Interestingly, the cell cycle regulator TP53 can also transactivate both ISG15 and certain IRF genes [49, 50] . We found TP53 among the highest basally-expressed response genes in RoNi cells compared to human cells. Given these intriguing possibilities, we further speculate that this proposed basal induction, including those for major canonical antiviral regulators and receptors, could help prime RoNi cells for a rapid, more efficient host response coordination and infection control in an IFN-independent manner, perhaps an ancient driver of MARV adaptation via VP35. Nevertheless, as our study employed an immortalized cell line, we cannot rule out that higher basal transcription may be artifactual and RoNi cell specific.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our transcriptomic analyses of MARV-infected RoNi cells suggest it is unlikely that antiviral gene upregulation alone can explain ERB resistance to severe MARV disease. Our findings reveal that immune suppression is still a critical feature of MARV infection in ERB cells. Antiviral gene induction is presumably only one of a series of host defenses that MARV must overcome in order to remain viable in ERBs, as multiple determinants of disease resistance might exist. Various host gene activities, pathways, or processes could resist but still tolerate a MARV infection. ERBs may have noncanonical defense mechanisms, as suggested by our observation of IFN-independent signaling and the possible basal \"induction\" of critical response genes. In fact, we posit that a co-evolved interplay between MARV-mediated immune gene suppression and host-mediated noncanonical responses likely defines the ERB disease resistance by tempering both overactive MARV replication and host proinflammatory activation [22] . However, our observations may not be applicable to other bat species, as each could have evolved unique strategies to tolerate their set of species-specific pathogens. Admittedly, given the limitations inherent to using RoNi cells as an in vitro ERB model, it is impossible to capture all aspects of the antiviral response that might otherwise occur in the context of a whole animal (bat) infection. In primates, MARV inhibits antiviral responses in vitro but elicits an exacerbated inflammatory response in vivo, and the balance of both effects may contribute to the severe disease phenotype. Therefore, in vivo ERB infection studies will be vital to our continued exploration for immune response factors that dictate avirulence in the MARV reservoir host.",
