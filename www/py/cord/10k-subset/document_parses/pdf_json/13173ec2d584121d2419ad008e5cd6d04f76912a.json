The low yields of cell-based manufacturing systems using egg-derived CVVs remain an unsolved issue. This study aimed to develop high-growth cell-derived CVVs for MDCK cell-based vaccine manufacturing platforms. Methods: Four H7N9 CVVs were generated in characterized Vero and adherent MDCK (aMDCK) cells. Furthermore, reassortant viruses were amplified in adherent MDCK (aMDCK) cells with certification, and their growth characteristics were detected in aMDCK cells and new suspension MDCK (sMDCK) cells. Finally, the plaque-forming ability, biosafety, and immunogenicity of H7N9 reassortant viruses were evaluated.",

The alum-adjuvanted NHRI-RG5 (derived from the fifth wave H7N9 virus A/Guangdong/SP440/2017) vaccine had the highest immunogenicity and cross-reactivity among the four H7N9 CVVs.

Up to May 2019, there have been 1568 human cases, including 616 deaths (mortality rate of approximately 39%) [1] . Although the H7N9 outbreak is under control currently, the newly emerging H7N9 viruses still pose a threat to public health. The H7N9 viruses in the fifth wave have become highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses that bear mutations in the HA gene [2, 3] and display reduced susceptibility to antiviral drugs [4, 5] . Because of the close proximity of Taiwan to the H7N9 outbreak regions, it is crucial for the surveillance and control measure of poultry and migratory birds to be strengthened. Thus, antiviral medicines and H7N9 prepandemic vaccines need to be stockpiled in Taiwan.",

To increase the yield of egg-derived CVVs in cell-based production platforms, further adaptation is usually required [10] . We produced inactivated whole-virion H5N1 and H7N9 vaccines in characterized adherent MDCK (aMDCK) cells in a PIC/ S GMP bioproduction plant at the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI), Taiwan [11, 12] . However, it took weeks to import the CVVs from ERLs and adapt the CVVs to an aMDCK cell-based platform before vaccine production. For a prompt response to an influenza pandemic, the preparation of cell-derived CVVs is desirable for the rapid production of cell-based pandemic influenza vaccines.",

However, the CVVs generated by using internal genes from PR8 are suitable for egg-based production platform. By using egg-derived CVVs in cell-based platforms, adaptation is usually needed, which takes extra time for preparing production. To shorten the preparation time of vaccine viruses for cell-based manufacturing systems, recent studies used cell-adapted high-growth viruses as master donor viruses (MDVs) [13] [14] [15] , and synthetic hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes [16, 17] to generate cellderived CVVs. In addition, for safety issue, the cleavage site of HA protein was modified to -PKGR-, a cleavage site of LPAI H7N9 viruses, and the position 292 of NA protein was also modified to Arginine (R) to increase the sensitivity to NA inhibitor, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir [18] . In this study, we generated cell-derived H7N9 CVVs by reverse genetics (six internal genes derived from an aMDCK cell-adapted H5N1 virus and two attenuated synthetic HA and NA genes). A strategy to enhance the virus yield of CVVs by using the cell-derived CVV technology in our proprietary suspension MDCK (NHRI sMDCK) cells was presented.",

The HA titers of NHRI-RG5 and NHRI-RG6 in aMDCK cells ranged from 128 to 256 hemagglutination units (HAU)/50 \u03bcL ( Table 2 ) and were maintained at a similar level after several passages (V1aM10, unpublished data). In contrast, the HA titers of NHRI-RG3 and NHRI-RG4 showed an increase from 64 HAU/50 \u03bcL (V1aM2) to 256 HAU/50 \u03bcL (V1aM3) and were maintained at a level similar to that of V1aM10 (unpublished data), which means in the aMDCK-based production system, the aMDCK cell-adapted MDV could not generate highgrowth reassortants for all H7N9 viruses and the reassortant viruses may need further adaptations to reach higher titers (Table 2) . Recently, we developed an sMDCK cell line to overcome the problem of scalability in the adherent cellbased manufacturing process for influenza vaccines. To explore the productivity of CVVs in sMDCK cells, the rescued reassortant viruses were also directly inoculated to the cells. The HA titers of sMDCK-derived NHRI-RG3, NHRI-RG4 increased from 64 HAU/50 \u03bcL (V1aM1) to 256/512 HAU/50 \u03bcL (V1sM1) ( Table 2) . Similarly, the HA titers of sMDCK-derived NHRI-RG5 and -RG6 showed an 8-to 16-fold increase, compared with their aMDCK-derived counterparts ( Table 2 ). These results suggest that the inoculation of the rescued reassortant virus in sMDCK cells directly improved viral titer by 8-to 16-fold without further adaptation. Interestingly, the MDCK-derived reassortant viruses still have a good growth property in eggs, and could grow to high HA titers in chicken embryos which reaching 2048 HA/ 50 \u03bcL (V1aM3E1, Table 2 ).",

In the absence of trypsin, the plaqueforming ability of H7N9 CVVs was reduced 10-fold (Table 4) , and the plaque size was reduced (Fig. 3) .",

To investigate the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the CVVs, H7N9 CVVs were produced in sMDCK cells and purified by using flow-through chromatography. Electron microscopy images revealed that the four purified H7N9 CVVs had a spherical shape with clear spike structures on the surface (Additional file 2: Fig. S1 ). The antigenicity of H7N9 reassortant viruses was determined by HI assay using A/Guangdong/ 17SF003/2016-like standard serum. The HI assay results revealed that the antigenicity of NHRI-RG3, RG4, and RG5 (V1aM3sM1) was similar to that of A/Guangdong/ 17SF003/2016-like standard antigen ( Table 6 ). The sequencing results showed that NHRI-RG3, RG4, and RG5 at V1aM3sM1 passage had HA-I120T or HA-A151T substitutes without other mutation after an sMDCK passage (unpublished data). Hence, these results indicated that HA-I120T and HA-A151T substitutes did not change viral antigenicity. Notably, the HI titer of NHRI-RG6 was 4-fold lower than that of NHRI-RG3, RG4, and RG5, as well as standard antigen, suggesting that the antigenicity of NHRI-RG6 was different with those viruses ( Table 6 ). NHRI-RG6 (derived from A/Taiwan/1/2017) had several differences in HA1 amino acid sequence compared with A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 H7N9 virus (Additional file 1: Table S1 ), which could be the reason for the antigenic difference between NHRI-RG3 and -RG6. Because squalene-based adjuvant (AddaVax) can improve immune response and antibody cross-reactivity [28] , we evaluated the immune response of alum-and AddaVax-adjuvanted H7N9 vaccines. The antisera of immunized mice were analyzed using an HI assay against homologous and heterologous H7N9 viruses. In the alum-adjuvanted groups, the geometric mean HI titers of NHRI-RG3, NHRI-RG4, NHRI-RG5, and NHRI-RG6 vaccines against the homologous virus were 71.3, 80.0, 226.3, and 88.3, respectively (Fig. 4) , and the NHRI-RG3, \u2212RG5 and -RG6 vaccines induced a similar level of antibodies against homologous and heterologous H7N9 viruses (Fig. 4A, C, and D) . However, the NHRI-RG4 vaccine elicited statistically lower cross-reactive antibody (2-to 4-fold lower) against heterologous H7N9 viruses (NHRI-RG3, RG5 and RG6) than homologous H7N9 virus (NHRI-RG4) (Fig. 4B ). In the AddaVaxadjuvanted groups, the geometric mean HI titers of NHRI-RG3, NHRI-RG4, NHRI-RG5, and NHRI-RG6 vaccines against the homologous virus were 127.0, 285.1, 285.1, and 160.0, respectively (Fig. 4) . Compared with alum adjuvant, the AddaVax adjuvant slightly enhanced the immunogenicity of the NHRI-RG3, NHRI-RG5, and NHRI-RG6 vaccines (Fig. 4A , C, and D) and significantly improved the immunogenicity of the NHRI-RG4 vaccine against both homologous and heterologous viruses (Fig.  4B) . These results indicate that NHRI-RG5 has the highest immunogenicity among all H7N9 CVVs, and the low immunogenicity and cross-reactivity of NHRI-RG4 vaccine may be improved using the AddaVax adjuvant.",

            "text": "The manufacturing of vaccines for emerging pandemic influenza usually takes months with multiple processes, including the generation of high-growth CVVs, viral growth optimization, the evaluation of antigenicity and pathogenicity, and so on [26, 29, 30] . However, our experiences show that the use of egg-derived CVVs in cellbased manufacturing systems could prolong the time to final vaccine production because of the paperwork associated with CVV importation and the viral adaptation in (Fig. 1A) . These processes may take an additional 2-4 months. In this study, we developed cell-derived CVVs using reverse genetics and generated high-yield CVVs in the sMDCK-manufacturing system (Fig. 1B) . This approach could help save time by omitting the time of CVV importation and the optimization of viral growth in cells. Although a 3-passage adaptation to aMDCK cells was required to optimize the growth of NHRI-RG3 and NHRI-RG4 CVVs (Table 2) , our results showed that the direct inoculation of the rescued reassortant virus in sMDCK cells improves virus growth without requiring further adaptation (right part in Fig. 1B) . Several suspension MDCK cell lines have also been developed to facilitate cell-based manufacturing processes [31] [32] [33] . Similar to these studies, the productivity of influenza viruses in sMDCK cells was higher than that in aMDCK cells (Fig. 2) . The differences between sMDCK and aMDCK culture systems include cultivation conditions and the characteristics of the cell line. We found that the cell-specific productivity of viral particles (virions/cell) in the sMDCK culture system was 1.9-to 3.5fold higher than that in the aMDCK culture system (Supplementary Table S2) . A previous study also showed that the HA production capability (HAU/10 6 cells) of suspension MDCK cells is remarkably higher than that of adherent MDCK cells [31] . Therefore, we assume that the high yield of influenza virus in the sMDCK culture system does not depend entirely on cell density. To further explore the potential mechanism by which influenza virus growth is increased in sMDCK cells, we will examine the transcriptome differences between sMDCK and aMDCK cells.",

            "text": "Previous studies showed that N-linked glycosylation at N123 and N149 sites of the H7 protein enhances the viral growth, which may be related to the influence on receptor binding [34, 35] . Similarly, we found that CVVs (NHRI-RG5 and NHRI-RG6) with these N-linked glycosylation sites had 4-fold higher HA titers than NHRI-RG3 and NHRI-RG4 at passages V1aM1 and V1aM2 (Table 2 ). In particular, the HA titers of NHRI-RG3 and NHRI-RG4 at passage V1aM3 reached levels similar to those of NHRI-RG5 and NHRI-RG6, which also have amino acid substitutions in the HA protein, including an I120T mutation in NHRI-RG3 and an A151T mutation in NHRI-RG4. The HA-I120T and HA-A151T mutations could potentially induce N-linked glycosylation of the HA protein at N118 (which is the same as NHRI-RG6) and N149 (which is the same as NHRI-RG5), respectively. The N-linked glycosylation at N118 (NHRI-RG3 and NHRI-RG6 and N149 (NHRI-RG4 and NHRI-RG5) in the HA protein has been shown by HPLC-MS/MS (Additional file 3: Fig. S2 and Additional file 4: Fig. S3) . Based on previous studies [34, 35] and our findings, the acquired N-glycosylation site at N118 and N149 may be the reason for the improved HA titer of NHRI-RG3 and NHRI-RG4 (V1aM3), respectively, and these N-linked glycosylations at N118 and N149 did not cause any antigenic change in NHRI-RG3 and NHRI-RG4 (Table 6) . Notably, the S118N mutation in the HA protein occurred gradually during evolution and became dominant in the 4th and 5th wave H7N9 viruses isolated from human, avian and environmental samples (Additional file 5: Fig. S4A ), but the I120T mutation in the HA protein was found only in human samples (Additional file 5: Fig. S4B ). Therefore, it is possible that N-linked glycosylation at N118 and N149 increases the growth efficiency of the H7N9 virus in mammalian cells. In the future, it could be an alternative to generate high-growth CVVs for emerging influenza H7N9 virus via introducing HA-I120T or HA-A151T substitutions, because it is acceptable to introduce special amino acid into the HA protein of influenza CVVs without affecting its antigenicity and pathogenicity [36] . Based on genetic and antigenic stability of influenza viruses, a suspension MDCK cell line, MDCK33016PF, has been considered as a suitable platform for the isolation and preparation of influenza vaccine seed viruses, especially H3N2 and B/Yamagata viruses [37] . The sequencing results of eight segments from NHRI-RG5 and -RG6 was quite stable in sMDCK cells after at least serial 7 passages, but several adaptive mutations, I120T, K163R, A292T, I421V, and I421M, were found in NHRI-RG3 and -RG4 after serial 3 passages and required for improving growth efficiency. Although the role of each amino acid substitution in HA remains unclear, these results suggested that the genetic stability of H7N9 CVVs in sMDCK cells is strain-dependent. Further study is still required to explore the genetic and antigenic stability of various influenza viruses after serial passages in sMDCK cells and the potential of sMDCK cells to isolate and prepare influenza vaccine seed viruses.",

            "text": "Based on the WHO guideline to develop and produce pandemic influenza vaccines [26] , this study conducted strict safety testing procedures to prove the pathogenicity of developed CVVs, including genetic stability, trypsin-independent plaque-forming ability, and biosafety evaluation. This study revealed that sMDCKderived high-growth H7N9 CVVs were attenuated with low levels of pathogenicity. Previous study using chicken Fig. 4 HI activity of mouse serum against inactivated H7N9 CVVs. Each H7N9 bulk (NHRI-RG3, NHRI-RG4, NHRI-RG5, and NHRI-RG6) was mixed with alum or AddaVax adjuvant, and administered to BALB/c mice intramuscularly on day 0 and day 14. The reactivity of mouse serum against inactivated NHRI-RG3, NHRI-RG4, NHRI-RG5, and NHRI-RG6 CVVs (Antigen) was examined by an HI assay, using the serum collected on day 28. The line indicates the geometric mean with a 95% confidence interval. The log 2 -transformed HI titers were analyzed by ANOVA with Newman-Keuls post-test (n = 6 mice for NHRI-RG3, NHRI-RG4 and NHRI-RG5 groups; n = 7 mice for NHRI-RG6 group). Significant differences between alum-and AddaVax-adjuvanted vaccines are indicated by ***, p < 0.001 embryos lethality test showed that reassortant H5N1 CVVs lacks pathogenicity compared with wild-type HPAI viruses, which are consistent with the safety test in ferrets and chickens [27] . According the WHO guideline [26, 38] , the safety study should be conducted in ferrets before the CVVs are released to vaccine manufacturers with BSL-2 enhanced containment. This study aims to develop high-growth influenza CVVs in suspension MDCK cells before vaccine manufacturing; hence, we will conduct ferret study in the future before the CVVs are used as vaccine seed viruses. Although a WHO report showed that the antigenicity of LPAI H7N9 viruses is distinct from that of emerging HPAI H7N9 viruses [39], a previous study illustrated that the AddaVax-adjuvanted LPAI H7N9 vaccine conferred efficient protection against HPAI H7N9 virus infection in a ferret challenge model [40] . Consistently, we found that alum-adjuvanted NHRI-RG4 (LPAI) vaccine induced antibodies with low cross-reactivity against HPAI H7N9 viruses (NHRI-RG3, NHRI-RG5, and NHRI-RG6), but this low cross-reactivity was improved by the use of the Adda-Vax adjuvant, an MF-59-like adjuvant (Fig. 4B ). This improvement has been reported in MF-59-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccines [41] . Interestingly, the antigenicity of NHRI-RG6 was distinct from A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016-like antigen ( Table 6 ), but alum-and AddaVax-adjuvanted HPAI H7N9 vaccines (NHRI-RG3, NHRI-RG5, and NHRI-RG6) could elicit high cross-reactive antibody response to each other (Fig. 4) . We also found that AddaVax adjuvant inclusion enhanced the immunogenicity of NHRI-RG4 (Fig. 4B) , consistent with the dose-sparing effect of AddaVax adjuvant on the H7N9 vaccine in mice [28] . These findings demonstrate that squalene-based adjuvants have the potential to improve H7N9 vaccine efficacy by increasing crossreactivity and immunogenicity.",

We further found that these cell-derived CVVs have high growth rates in sMDCK cells and demonstrated that four cell-derived H7N9 CVVs have a trypsindependent plaque-forming ability and no lethality in chicken embryos. To shorten the preparation time of CVVs for production, it might be ideal to directly establish sMDCK cellderived CVVs, which could improve the process of CVV preparation by eliminating the use of aMDCK cells. Moreover, the comparison of immunogenic and antigenic properties among the four H7N9 CVVs showed that NHRI-RG5 is the most suitable for the production of prepandemic vaccines. In conclusion, combining the two plaforms (sMDCK and reverse genetics) could significantly improve efficiency and productivity of manufacturing influenza H7N9 vaccines for pandemic preparedness.",
