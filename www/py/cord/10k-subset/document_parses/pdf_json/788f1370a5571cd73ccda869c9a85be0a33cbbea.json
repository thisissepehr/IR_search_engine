The major gains made in marketing poultry products strongly reflects both the predictability of supply and the increases in efficiency of production achieved ( Table 3) .

Eradication can be undertaken successfully for those pathogens for which the major means of transmission is via the egg if shedder hens can economically be detected and removed before lay.
