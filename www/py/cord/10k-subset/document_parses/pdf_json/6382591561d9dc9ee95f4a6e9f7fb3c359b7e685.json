But the association between the level of DC-SIGNR and lung cancer is unknown. To investigate the clinical diagnostic significance of DC-SIGNR in lung cancer, we investigated serum DC-SIGNR levels in 173 lung cancer patients and 134 healthy individuals using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results showed that serum DC-SIGNR levels in lung cancer patients were lower than that in healthy controls (P = 0.0003). A cut-off value of 3.8998 ng/L for DC-SIGNR predicted the presence of lung cancer with 78.03 % sensitivity and 49.25 % specificity (area under the curve = 0.6212, P = 0.0003). Strikingly, serum DC-SIGNR levels were significantly higher in lung cancer patients with brain metastasis compared to those without metastasis (P = 0.0283). Moreover, the serum concentrations of DC-SIGNR in lung cancer patients also correlated significantly with serum natural killer cells percentage (P = 0.0017). In addition, immunohistochemistry assay demonstrated that the expression of DC-SIGNR in lung tissues of 31 lung cancer patients and 13 tuberculosis patients was significantly lower than that in 18 normal lung tissues (P = 0.0418, 0.0289), and there is no significant difference between tuberculosis tissues and lung cancer tissues (P = 0.2696).

In our study, the DC-SIGNR levels in lung cancer patients with brain metastasis are significantly higher than those without metastasis. So, we compared the correlation between serum DC-SIGNR and S100b levels. However, there is no significant correlation between them. S100b which is a protein found in astrocytes and only released into serum when the blood-brain barrier is breached [37] . The expression of DC-SIGNR in brain tissues is still unknown. Thus, we guessed that the two molecular may have a difference mechanism to affect the brain metastasis of lung cancer and it can be investigated in further study. We also compared the serum levels of DC-SIGNR in bone, lung, and lymph nodes metastasis with non-metastasis, respectively.

An epidemiologic survey showed that low NK cell activity is associated with increased cancer risk [40] . Numerous studies have demonstrated that the infiltration of NK cells appears to have prognostic value in gastric carcinoma [41] , colorectal carcinoma [42] , and lung carcinomas [43, 44] , as a relatively higher level of NK cell infiltrate correlates with a better prognosis, thus suggesting relevant protective roles for NK cell infiltrate.
