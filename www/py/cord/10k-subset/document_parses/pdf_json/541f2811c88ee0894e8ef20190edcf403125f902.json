Furthermore, literature has labeled hand washing as 'do it yourself' vaccine which can interrupt transmission of various disease agents causing diarrhea and respiratory infections. Rates less than 30% are reported to be associated with high diarrhea-related child mortality in literature [5] . In this regard, achieving a highest hand washing prevalence of 37% falling down to 29% over a period of one year follow-up in present study suggests many bottlenecks in universalization of optimal hand hygiene in community settings.
