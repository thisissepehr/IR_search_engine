            "text": "There is limited information on the reproductive behaviour of the Maned wolf Chrysocyon brachyurus. Although it is a monogamous species, little is known about the J's role in the rearing of pups. In 1994 a comparative study of the behaviour of two 99 with new-born pups was carried out at Belo Horizonte Zoo to try to establish the 5's role in rearing: one was housed, alone with her pups throughout the observation period; the other? was housed with the 3 and pups for the first month and alone with the pups for the second month of observation. The applied methodology for behaviour evaluation was instantaneous sampling (scan). The behaviour of each adult was recorded at one-minute intervals. Location in the enclosure and spatial proximity were also recorded. The results suggest that Maned wolves are inactive for large parts of the day and that they prefer secluded areas within an enclosure. The results also suggest that only the ? is directly involved in rearing the offspring and that 8 participation is limited to protection only. The time that the 9 stays with the pups is at a maximum on the days immediately following birth, but this time decreases considerably as the pups grow. At around day 50, when lactation has ceased, contact between the and pups is minimal and the pups have their own resting places within the enclosure. These resting places, inside the burrows or thick vegetation, are rarely shared with others.",

            "text": "The Maned wolf Chrysocyon brachyurus is the largest endemic, nocturnal and crepuscular canid in South America. Although common in some regions, it is classified as Vulnerable throughout its GROUP range because of the indiscriminate loss of natural habitat and persecution by farmers (Carvalho, 1976; Thornback & Jenkins, 1982; Nowak & Paradiso, 1983; Bernardes et al., 1990; Groombridge, 1993; Fonseca et al., 1994) . As at December 1994 208.201 Maned wolves were reported to the international studbook (Matern, 1995) . Until the mid-1970s maintenance of Maned wolves in captivity was problematic and animals often died prematurely because of inadequate diet, disease and stress (Dennler de la Tour, 1968; Meritt, 1973; Brady & Ditton, 1979) . More recently zoos have maintained and bred this species with improved success, although the survival rate of pups remains low at a little more than 50% per year (Velloso, 1991 ). In Brazilian zoos, between 1962 and 1990 Maned wolves were born of which only nine reached adulthood (Velloso, 1991) . Until the 1990s injury inflicted by the adults was the main cause of infant mortality (Velloso, 1991) , although more recently hand-rearing has improved survival rates (Rosenthal & Dunn, 1995) . This is not a totally satisfactory solution, however, because wild canids are susceptible to diseases usually found in domestic dogs, such as canine distemper, parvovirus and coronavirus, when they are taken for hand-rearing before they have received passive immunity from the dam's colostrum (Velloso, 1991) . A vaccination protocol has not yet been established for these diseases at Belo Horizonte Zoo.",

Although Maned wolves are not typically diggers, Brady & Ditton (1 979) have observed them digging at Washington NZP. Because this behaviour was usually observed on the days that the wolves were fed meat, we assumed that they were probably hiding the remains to eat the next day, when they would be fed on a mixture of rations for wild dogs (Special Crock) and fruit.

In the wild, up to 20 km can be walked during sunset and at night, and this is related to both foraging and territorial defence (Carvalho, 1976) . Because captive Maned wolves do not need to forage, this activity is possibly solely defensive. Because only Carandai and Luana were observed in this activity it is possible that Luana was performing the 6 role of defending the territory. If this assumption is correct then the presence of a 6 may provide the 9 with the security she requires for rearing pups. If a 9 has to spend time and energy defending the ter- ritory she might be neglecting some maternal functions and this could increase stress levels.",

From 1 month old contact between the 0 and young took place outside the nest and was less frequent, shorter in duration and usually only occurred when the pups were suckling. Luana was more attentive to her pups than Xuxa. When Luana called the pups out of the nest, she would inspect them by circling and sniffing and licking them (naso-nasal and naso-anal contacts), before suckling. After suckling, which lasted for about 5 minutes, she played with the pups or let them explore the surroundings. Xuxa did not stay or play with the pups and interaction was limited to 3 4 minutes for suckling. From day 50 contact between Luana and the pups decreased considerably and she even started to avoid them. By this time the young had begun to eat solid food and they did not stay inside the nest.",

Dietz (1984) reported that 65% of faeces were found on rocks or termite mounds, always above ground level, probably for defence or to cause alarm. There is little available information relating to urine marking but its persistent smell suggests that it might also be used for defence or to cause alarm.
