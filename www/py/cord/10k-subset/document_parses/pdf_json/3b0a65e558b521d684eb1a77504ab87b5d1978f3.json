Among the complex taxa, Cx. pipiens (with two forms pipiens and molestus) and Cx. quinquefasciatus are the most ubiquitous mosquitoes in temperate and tropical regions respectively. Mosquitoes of this taxa lack of morphological differences between females, but have frank behavioral and physiological differences and have different trophic preferences that influence their vectorial status. Hybridization may change the vectorial capacity of these mosquitoes, increasing vector efficiency and medical importance of resulting hybrids. Methods: Culex pipiens s.l. from 35 distinct populations were investigated by the study of mtDNA, symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis, nuclear DNA and flanking region of microsatellite CQ11 polymorphism using PCR with diagnostic primers, RFLP analysis and sequencing. Results: Six different mitochondrial haplotypes were revealed by sequencing of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and three different Wolbachia (wPip) groups were identified. A strong association was observed between COI haplotypes/groups, wPip groups and taxa; haplogroup A and infection with wPipII appear to be typical for Cx. pipiens form pipiens, haplotype D and infection with wPipIV for form molestus, while haplogroup E, characteristic of Cx. quinquefasciatus, were correlated with wPipI and found in Cx. pipiens sl. from coastal regions of Southern Europe and Mediterranean region. Analysis of microsatellite locus and nuclear DNA revealed hybrids between Cx. pipiens form pipiens and form molestus, as well as between Cx. pipiens and Cx. quinquefasciatus, in Mediterranean populations, as opposed to Northern Europe. Phylogenetic analysis of COI sequences yielded a tree topology that supported the RFLP analysis with significant bootstrap values for haplotype D and haplogroup E. Conclusions: Molecular identification provides the first evidence of the presence of hybrids between Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. pipiens as well as cytoplasmic introgression of Cx. quinquefasciatus into Cx. pipiens as a result of hybridization events in coastal regions of Southern Europe and Mediterranean region. Together with observed hybrids between pipiens and molestus forms, these findings point to the presence of hybrids in these areas, with consequent higher potential for disease transmission.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Mosquitoes of the Culex pipiens complex are important disease vectors with global distribution [1] .

Typically, introduced Cx. quinquefasciatus initially appears in seaports, spreads along coastal areas and eventually moves inland following human activity [50] . Cx. pipiens with E and E1 haplotypes were also found in coastal areas of Italy, Portugal, Greece, Israel and Morocco (Fig. 3) . Random importation of Cx. quinquefasciatus and crossing with local Cx. pipiens may have resulted in the generation of hybrid populations, as we discovered on the Greek island of Kos [13] and in Tanger, Morocco (this work). Such is the case in the hybrid zone between the 30\u00b0and 40\u00b0parallels in North America [5, 7, 8, 14] , and in Argentina [10] proving the absence of crossing barriers between Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. pipiens. Thereafter, hybrid individuals may have backcrossed with local Cx. pipiens mosquitoes and after several generations, there are both hybrids' nuclear genome as well as Cx.pipiens DNA. Therefore, we find individuals with Cx.pipiens' nuclear genetic background while having Cx. quinquefasciatus' maternal mtDNA.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 283, "end": 287, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 600, "end": 604, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 726, "end": 729, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 730, "end": 732, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 733, "end": 735, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 736, "end": 739, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 759, "end": 763, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 407, "end": 415, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Molecular Phylogenetic analysis of 48 sequences of COI gene from Cx. pipiens s.l. taxa yielded a tree topology that supports the data from the RFLP analysis.

However, higher variability was detected when Cx. torrentium and Cx. pipiens s.l. were compared [40] .

Previous investigations examining either microsatellites [20] or the mtDNA cytb gene and Wolbachia polymorphism [35] also support frequent hybridization events within the Cx.pipiens complex in the Mediterranean Basin. Thus, by contrast with Northern Europe, similar mtDNA haplotypes are found in different Cx.pipiens taxa in the Mediterranean region. Our understanding of the contribution of cytoplasmic inheritance remains inadequate. Mosquitoes with hybrid features may vary from the parental forms in their competence for the transmission of pathogens. The absence of Cx. pipiens with haplotypes from group E in northern temperate climates could hypothetically point to different population origins, with possible interference in their physiology, of which they could be an indicator.
