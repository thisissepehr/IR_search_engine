Its dominant species was C. jamaicense, even though T. domingensis is reportedly one of the most tolerant species to flooding in terms of flood depth (Chen & Vaughan, 2014 ) and time exposed to flooding (Cronk & Fennessy, 2001) because it possesses several mechanisms that enable it to tolerate prolonged periods of flooding (Armstrong, Justin, Beckett, & Lythe, 1991; Colmer, 2003; Cronk & Fennessy, 2001; Voesenek & Bailey-Serres, 2015) . Interestingly, these adaptions can signify that low levels of flooding (\u221210 cm) are stressful for this species (unpublished results).

Along this route, groundwater interacts with different geological materials and becomes enriched with ions, resulting in the modification of its hydrogeochemical signature until its capture and/or arrival at the discharge area. Because of the stratification of the region, multiple sedimentary units of low hydraulic conductivity are present. Water contained in the sedimentary units of the Cretaceous period is confined to aquifers and can only ascend to the surface or mix with more local flows through faults or fractures (Figure 4).

The graph is indicative of the major processes controlling groundwater chemistry: evaporation and crystallization, rock dominance, and atmospheric precipitation. As observed in most of the samples, evaporation processes are most influential followed by water-rock interactions.Overall, during the rainy season, both groups present a greater concentration of TDS compared with the dry season. This may be due to the transportation of sediments and dissolved contaminants in water originating from anthropogenic activities, such as land-use change. Both groups presented a lower concentration of chlorides in the rainy season versus the dry season. The increase in chlorides during the dry season is more notable in Group 2 and is associated with evaporation as a result of high temperatures.The diagram of the HCO 3 + SO 4 versus Ca + Mg relationship is presented inFigure 8ato discern whether groundwater circulates in carbonate rocks or rocks rich in silicates. Most samples (both dates) fall in the field of silicate alteration, whereas only a few correspond with carbonate dissolution, which is likely related with the previously described geological context. The Group 1 samples present low dispersion independently of season. Meanwhile, the Group 2 samples present higher dispersion: In the month of October, alteration by silicates appears to be more influential, whereas during the dry season, interaction with carbonates is evidenced.The Ca/Na versus HCO 3 /Na relationship is presented in This graph has been used to understand the interactions between water and the geological medium through which it circulates (water-rock interactions). In the figure, evolution curves initially representing local recharge or rainwater were identified (I and II). The first curve (I) corresponds with water that has had a greater interaction with volcanic rock, leading to a higher alteration by silicates. The second curve (II) also corresponds with rainwater that has interacted with volcanic rock and has undergone silicate alteration, although it additionally shows evidence of evaporative processes. The evaporative processes observed in curves I and II are consistent with the characteristics of Ci\u00e9naga del Fuerte: month of April, the samples are once again divided into two groups: One group contains the samples from the floodplain pasture and Cladium-Typha sites, and a second group contains the samples from the Thalia and Typha-Cladium sites. During the rainy season, the Group 1 samples are located in the field of meteoric water, whereas the Group 2 samples show greater evolution and interaction with rocks rich in silicates. However, during the month of April, the Group 1 samples show little interaction with silicate rocks (as rhyolite and dacite), whereas the Group 2 samples present greater evolution and interaction with silicates and indicate evaporation, which is consistent with the high temperatures during this month.The Na/Ca versus Mg/Ca relationship is presented inFigure 8c.This graph lets us to identify the interaction between groundwater and rocks rich in silicates (as rhyolite and dacite), limestone, and dolostone as well as mixtures with sea water/saltwater intrusion and irri-gation return. Most samples are located in Quadrants 1, 3, and 4 (indicating the influence marine and weathering silicates). The groups are similarly separated. Overall, in both October and April, the Group 1 samples are mainly distributed in the limestone and silicate zone and indicate little evaporation. The Group 2 samples show interaction with silicates and the influence of evaporative processes, irrigation return, and/or evolution. This finding is congruent given the location of the study area in a discharge area near citrus orchards and the temperatures of the region. The relationship between the cation chloride ratio index and Cl/ (alkanility + Cl) is shown in Figure 9a. Two groundwater evolution curves can be identified: The first begins with Ca + Mg>> Na + K but shifts to Ca + Mg = Na + K as water evolves. Some samples begin at Ca + Mg << Na + K and tend to show similar values as water evolves, initiating with ionic exchange and subsequent alteration of silicates and evapotranspiration as water evolves. Temporally, in the month of October, the Group 1 samples tend to group on the left and show characteristics of rainwater that has undergone little evolution. These samples show greater vertical distribution and, correspondingly, little variation in HCO 3 and Cl. The Group 2 samples are distributed towards the right and are associated with more evolved waters, evapotranspiration processes, and ionic exchange with the clay material present in the soil. In April, the Group 1 samples are slightly dispersed towards the right, showing some influence from evaporation F I G U R E 9 Diagrams of the relationships between (a) Cl and residual alkalinity, (b) the CCR index and Cl/ (alkalinity + Cl), and (c) Cl and Na. CCR, The samples are divided into two regions. The upper region indicates greater presence of bicarbonate ions and ionic exchange. The lower region indicates a lower concentration of HCO 3 than Ca-Mg as well as greater evapotranspiration. Two evolution curves can be observed, with values of residual alkalinity starting near zero. A grouping can also be observed near the right side of the graph, indicating an increase in chlorides and, accordingly, greater evolution and evapotranspiration. Temporally, the residual alkalinity is positive in October and negative in April (dry season), which is congruent with the temperatures during this latter month (25 C to 27 C). On both dates, Groups 1 and 2 are separated. Group 1 tends to have a residual alkalinity near zero, whereas Group 2 has a positive or negative residual alkalinity depending on the season (rainy or dry, respectively). The Cl versus Na relationship is shown in Figure 9c. This relationship can be used to identify processes of ionic exchange and alteration by albite or processes of reversible ionic exchange. The Group 1 samples tend to be concentrated near the origin and have low Na and Cl values, whereas the Group 2 samples show higher concentrations of both ions.

The spatiotemporal behaviour of the water samples shows that groundwater underwent evapotranspiration, possibly as a result of saltwater intrusion and/or irrigation return from agricultural activities. 6. Groundwater in Ci\u00e9naga del Fuerte first undergoes processes of ion exchange and, as it evolves, evapotranspiration occurs. This is congruent with the region's climate and the clay content in wetland soil. 7. The residual alkalinity showed that, as groundwater begins to evolve, spatiotemporal variation is near zero. However, in the rainy season, the Group 2 samples had positive residual alkalinity, which then turned negative in the dry season.
