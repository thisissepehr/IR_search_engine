Third, a confounding factor may have been the relationship between the time of symptom onset and patient presentation, influencing discharge decisions. Finally, a note of caution must be applied regarding molecular test results as these do not distinguish between live or dead organisms or demonstrate antimicrobial sensitivities. Identifying the presence of a pathogen does not confirm infection, and asymptomatic individuals may shed organisms for prolonged periods. However, we used the FilmArray in a targeted manner in patients with symptoms consistent with active infection, which may account for the high number of positive and low number of negative results observed.

Understanding the causes of non-EVD illness is important for planning future laboratory support to EVDTUs and staff health protection measures (eg, influenza vaccination and malaria chemoprophylaxis).
