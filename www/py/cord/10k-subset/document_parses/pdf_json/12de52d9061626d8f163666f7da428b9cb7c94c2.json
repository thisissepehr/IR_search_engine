The polygenic responses to these external stimuli are temporally and coordinately regulated. Specific lncRNAs are induced to modulate innate and adaptive immune responses which can function through various target interactions like RNA-DNA, RNA-RNA, and RNA-protein interaction and hence affect the immunogenic regulation at various stages of gene expression. LncRNA are found to be present in various immune cells like monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, T cells and B cells. They have been shown to be involved in many biological processes, including the regulation of the expression of genes, the dosage compensation and genomics imprinting, but the knowledge how lncRNAs are regulated and how they alter cell differentiation/function is still obscure. Further dysregulation of lncRNA has been seen in many diseases, but as yet very less research has been carried out to understand the role of lncRNAs in regulation during host-pathogens interactions. In this review, we summarize the functional developments and mechanism of action of lncRNAs, in immunity and defense of host against pathogens.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The assumption that ncRNAs can play a critical role in various biological processes has been recognized for a long time such as rRNAs and tRNAs are required for protein synthesis [1, 2] and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) play a major role for mRNA splicing and nuclear organization [3] . Recent developments in sequencing technologies have revealed that ncRNA transcription is more prevalent than previously appreciated [4, 5] . A major breakthrough in molecular biology over the last two decades has been the discovery and demonstration of function for lncRNAs. The emerging role of lncRNAs is only now starting to be cataloged. The major roles of lncRNAs are being uncovered in a diverse array of processes of genomic imprinting to X chromosome inactivation (Xist), to stem cell differentiation, to cancer metastasis and immunity and much more. In our previous review [6] , we comprehensively describe the molecular functions and mechanisms of various lncRNAs. The sequencing technologies revealed their natural structure and precisely determined what type of interaction they follow, for example, RNA-RNA, RNA-DNA, or RNA-Protein interactions. Long noncoding RNAs produce diverse processes to regulate gene expression through transcription, splicing, nucleic acid degradation, decoy, and translation. The emerging role of lncRNAs in immune responses became a subject of attraction with a breakthrough study, which reported that lncRNAs might regulate the innate immune response [7] . Since then, many lncRNAs have been functionally characterized through microarrary and RNA-Seq techniques with respect to innate immunity. This provided a new insight into the role of lncRNAs in immune system regulation. Since then a large number of lncRNAs were discovered, such as Lethe, PACER, THRIL, and NEAT1, representing a new class of molecules that is implicated in regulating the immune gene expression [8] and immune cell functions [9, 10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 179, "end": 182, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 183, "end": 185, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 314, "end": 317, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 452, "end": 455, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 456, "end": 458, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 902, "end": 905, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1513, "end": 1516, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1931, "end": 1934, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1961, "end": 1964, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1965, "end": 1968, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Importance of lncRNAs is emerging for their regulatory role in physiological and pathological responses [11, 12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 104, "end": 108, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 109, "end": 112, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Their functional utility in the immune response is quickly emerging and this is actually the subject of this review.

With a wealth of information coming from different publications regarding immune-related lncRNAs, it is worth mentioning the functional diversity of these lncRNAs. Currently, many of the reported immune-related lncRNAs are located close to or overlapping with immune-related protein coding gene clusters, such as IL1 -RBT46 [14] , lnc-IL7R [15, 16] and lincRNA-Ccr2-5\u2032 AS [17] [ Table 1 ]. These are found to regulate their adjacent protein coding genes in cis or in trans-acting manners. Moreover, recent reports show that the regulatory functions of many immunerelated lncRNAs are mostly involved in processes of RNA/protein binding or RNA/DNA base-pairing [18] . Given the vast number of interactions discovered, immune-related lncRNA can interact with transcription factors and signaling molecules (NF-\u03baB, STAT3) [19] [20] [21] , RNA binding proteins (hnRNP, HuR), [18, 22, 23] as well as chromatin remodeling components (PRC2, WDR5) [24, 25] .

Interestingly, genomic region flanking inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 gene displays high transcriptional complexity. Situated within IL-1\u03b2 locus, a downstream eRNA, namely, IL1\u03b2-eRNA and an upstream mRNA-surrounding RBT called IL1\u03b2-RBT46 have been identified [14] . Further studies revealed the predominant localization of both IL1\u03b2-eRNA and IL1\u03b2-RBT46 in the nucleus of naive and LPS-stimulated cells. The expression of IL1\u03b2-eRNA and IL1\u03b2-RBT46 is mediated by NF-\u03baB, (a classical proinflammatory transcription factor) [14] .

They can function as scaffolds for protein complex and coordinate the gene expression at the post -transcriptional level [6, 19] . Here, we provide the detail of some lncRNAs regarding to this notion in the immune system. PACER PACER (p50-associated Cox2 extragenic RNA) is a wellknown lncRNA located upstream of the Cox2 transcriptional start site and expressed in the antisense direction in humans. The PACER homolog in mice has been identified as cyclooxygenase II enzyme-divergent (Ptgs2os) whose expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts is highly induced by LPS, proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and TNF) and various TLR agonists viz., Pam3CK4, HKLM, Poly(I:C). Interestingly, Cox2-divergent displays similar upregulated expression patterns upon the cytokine/ TLR agonist stimulations in RelA/MEFs as compared to wild type MEFs, suggesting indirect regulation of lncRNA Cox2-divergent by RelA (NF-\u03baB component) [19] . Moreover, Krawczyk and Emerson reported the expression of lncRNA Cox2-divergent homolog PACER in primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) and in human monocytes that are in the process of macrophage differentiation. They also revealed the regulatory role of PACER in COX-2 gene expression [21] . Furthermore, PACER is also been suggested to be involved in regulation of NF-\u03baB signaling by physically interacting with NF-\u03baB p50 thereby sequestering the transcription factor binding to the promoters of target genes such as COX2 (see Fig. 1c ) [21] . The sequestration of transcriptional factor facilitates the recruitment of histone acetyltransferase p300 and assembly of RNA polymerase II pre-initiation complex at the promoter of COX2 gene. PACER expression is induced by chromatin boundary/insulator factor CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), which in turn forms a permissive chromatin environment in the upstream region of COX2 gene [21] .

Silencing of lincRNA-Cox2 does not alter expression of Cox2 (Ptgs2), but causes an increase in expression of several immune responsible genes in resting macrophages, including IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Oas1a, Irf7, Ifi204, Oas1l, Oas2, and Isg15, chemokines (Cl3cl1,Ccl5,) and chemokine receptors (Ccrl). The LincRNA-Cox2 expression is remarkably induced in dendritic cells and macrophages challenged with microbial pathogens and various TLR ligands such as Pam3CSK4, LPS and R848 in MyD88 and NF-\u03baB dependent manner [7, 22] . Recently a study revealed that lincRNA-Cox2 is essential for the induction of other immune-related genes, such as Tlr1, IL-6, and IL-23a in macrophages derived from bone marrow by Pam3CSK4 treatment (see Fig. 1a ) [22] . Thus, it appears that lincRNA-Cox2 plays a role in, either activation or repression of immune-regulatory gene expression in macrophages. Previously, lincRNA-Cox2 is shown to have transcriptional repressive functions via interacting with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A/B and A2/B1 (see Fig. 1a ) [22] . On the other hand, lincRNA-Cox2 was shown to facilitate the inducible expression of a distinct cluster of immune response genes, including proinflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. In addition to its role in macrophages, lincRNA-Cox2 is also regulated downstream of NF-\u03baB in epithelial cells [40] . Similar to what was observed in macrophages, knockdown of lincRNA-Cox2 resulted in reprogramming of the gene expression profile in intestinal epithelial cells exposed to TNF-\u03b1. In particular, lincRNA-Cox2 appears to repress the transcription of IL-12b, and mediates these effects via its interactions with the Mi-2 nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (Mi-2/NuRD) repressor complex, which this lincRNA appears to guide to the Il12b promoter region [40] . These data provide mechanistic insight into the role of lincRNA-Cox2 in promoting epigenetic modulation of cytokine genes and identify lincRNA-Cox2 as a novel regulator of both macrophage and intestinal epithelial inflammatory responses. The Ptgs2 (Cox2) genomic locus in mice encodes a second lncRNA called Cox2-divergent (Ptgs2 opposite strand; Ptgs2os) [19, 22] . This Cox2-divergent lncRNA is located at the 5end of Ptgs2 (nonoverlapping), and is transcribed on the opposite (negative) DNA strand [19] . Although the functions of Cox2-divergent remain to be further clarified, it is highly inducible in mouse embryonic fibroblasts exposed to TNF-\u03b1 and LPS [19] . The RNA binding protein family of hnRNPs includes many multifunctional proteins with a regulatory role in the gene expression and the post transcriptional modification [41] . With the availability of lincRNA-Cox2 knockout mouse [42] , further research is required to clarify the mechanisms of lincRNA-Cox2 in the immune responses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 820, "end": 823, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 824, "end": 827, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1044, "end": 1048, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1365, "end": 1369, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1682, "end": 1686, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2138, "end": 2142, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2501, "end": 2505, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2506, "end": 2509, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2646, "end": 2650, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2805, "end": 2809, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2980, "end": 2984, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 3040, "end": 3044, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 289, "end": 296, "text": "Fig. 1a", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1041, "text": "Fig. 1a", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1362, "text": "Fig. 1a", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "LincRNA-Cox2"}, {"text": "Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells, which links innate immune system with adaptive immune system.

PU.1 a promoter binding transcription factor is shown to control lnc-DC transcription, suggesting its regulatory role in lnc-DC gene expression. Meanwhile, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac are found to activate histone modifications on lnc-DC loci, thereby forming an accessible chromatin structure and hense facilitating an exclusive expression of lnc-DC in human DCs [20] . Knockdown of lnc-DC impaired differentiation of DCs from human monocytes in vitro and from mouse bone marrow cells in vivo and reduced capability of DCs to stimulate T cell activation (see Fig. 1d ). Lnc-DC, was shown to be upregulated during human DC development and was found to be highly expressed in Lin \u2212 MHCII + CD11c + conventional DCs, but absent from plasmacytoid DCs, monocytes, or other leukocyte subsets [20] . Lentiviral knockdown of lnc-DC during human DC development was shown to have broad functional consequences, including impaired expression of surface receptors critical for T-cell activation (CD80/86, HLA-DR, CD40), impairment in antigen uptake by monocyte-derived DCs, and decreased IL-12 production after stimulation with LPS. lnc-DC mediated these effects by activating STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, a transcription factor. Mechanistically, it was shown to regulate STAT3 activity, a critical regulator of DC maturation. lnc-DC bound directly to STAT3 in the cytoplasm, preventing STAT3 binding to and dephosphorylation by SHP1. This resulted in maintenance of STAT3 phosphorylation in the presence of lnc-DC.

THRIL shows basal expression; but, the expression is decreased in a negative feedback loop after the induction of TNF-\u03b1 release by Pam3Csk4 [10, 23] . THRIL also has a regulatory role in basal and Pam3Csk4-induced gene expression. c PACER is localised upstream of the Cox2 transcriptional start site and is shows expression in the antisense direction.

Moreover, THRIL is shown to mediate the effect of Pam3CSK4 on induction of expression of CSF1, TNF\u03b1, IL-8, IL-6, CXCL10 and CCL1 suggesting its role in immune regulation [23] . Additionally, THRIL is found to interact with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNPL). The THRIL-hnRNPL complex binds to TNF\u03b1 promoter thereby regulating its transcription in both basal and Pam3CSK4-activated conditions. Interestingly, the THRIL expression can be inhibited by TNF\u03b1 (see Fig. 1B ) [23] . THRIL loss-of-function (shRNA) studies revealed that THRIL contributes to the inducible expression of the proinflammatory cytokine mediators TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 upon Pam3CSK4 stimulation [44] . Further supporting role for THRIL in immune gene regulation, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments indicated that heterogenous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)-L localized to the TNF-\u03b1 promoter upon Pam3CSK4 stimulation. A very different mechanism by which lncRNAs can induce inflammatory responses seems to be a direct inflammatory response directed against the ssRNA itself. This has recently been demonstrated by transfection of in vitro transcribed lncRNAs into myeloid cells, which led to a strong induction of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-12, or TNF-\u03b1 [45] . Therefore, THRIL is a novel negative feedback regulator for termination of TNF\u03b1 expression in inflammatory response.

Mechanistically, dysregulation of long ncRNAs could control downstream regulation of genes at several functional levels stretching from epigenetic changes influencing chromatin organization to post-transcriptional regulation at transcript levels as well as via direct interaction with other biomolecules such as proteins and RNAs [46, 48] . These interactions could affect (a) host responses to a pathogen not excluding immunological mechanisms (b) regulation of growth and replication of pathogen (c) regulation of apoptosis or survival (d) general stress responses. While there in not certainty about the exact mechanism through which viral lncRNAs act, it has been suggested that the viral long ncRNAs exploit the interaction networks within hosts, thereby influencing their response to infections in an attempt to evade the immunological response. A variety of mechanisms are employed in doing this, besides the inhibition of the RNAi response [49] .

Investigators further assess genome-wide differential lncRNA expression patterns associated with inflammation, infection, and differentiation of monocytes into macrophage and dendritic cells, Using microarray and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) [19, 20, 22, 23, [69] [70] [71] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 222, "end": 226, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 227, "end": 231, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 232, "end": 236, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 237, "end": 241, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 242, "end": 246, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 247, "end": 251, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 435, "end": 439, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 829, "end": 833, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1262, "end": 1266, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1315, "end": 1319, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1489, "end": 1493, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1894, "end": 1898, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 2231, "end": 2234, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2585, "end": 2589, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2590, "end": 2593, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2594, "end": 2597, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2598, "end": 2601, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2602, "end": 2606, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 2607, "end": 2611, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 2612, "end": 2616, "text": "[71]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Long Non-Coding RNA expression in response to infection"}, {"text": "Besides the innate immune responses, increasing evidence revealed the role of lncRNAs in T cell development, differentiation and activation. Using custom microarrays, a study revealed the expression profiles of lncRNAs in mammalian CD 8+ T cells and revealed hundreds of lncRNAs, expressing in a lymphoid-specific manner and/or changed dynamically during lymphocyte differentiation or activation [72] . Recently, 1524 lincRNA clusters in 42 T cell samples were identified from early T cell progenitors to terminally differentiated helper T cell subsets [17] . The analysis revealed very dynamic and cell-specific expression patterns for lincRNAs during T cell differentiation [17] . In addition to this an another study identified more than 500 novel lincRNAs and described lincRNA signatures in human lymphocytes [68, 73] .
