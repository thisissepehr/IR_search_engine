            "text": "Host restriction factors constitute a formidable barrier for viral replication to which many viruses have evolved counter-measures. Human SAMD9, a tumor suppressor and a restriction factor for poxviruses in cell lines, is antagonized by two classes of poxvirus proteins, represented by vaccinia virus (VACV) K1 and C7. A paralog of SAMD9, SAMD9L, is also encoded by some mammals, while only one of two paralogs is retained by others. Here, we show that SAMD9L functions similarly to SAMD9 as a restriction factor and that the two paralogs form a critical host barrier that poxviruses must overcome to establish infection. In mice, which naturally lack SAMD9, overcoming SAMD9L restriction with viral inhibitors is essential for poxvirus replication and pathogenesis. While a VACV deleted of both K1 and C7 (vK1L -C7L -) was restricted by mouse cells and highly attenuated in mice, its replication and virulence were completely restored in SAMD9L -/mice. In humans, both SAMD9 and SAMD9L are poxvirus restriction factors, although the latter requires interferon induction in many cell types. While knockout of SAMD9 with Crispr-Cas9 was sufficient for abolishing the restriction for vK1L -C7Lin many human cells, knockout of both paralogs was required for abolishing the restriction in interferon-treated cells. Both paralogs are antagonized by VACV K1, C7 and C7 homologs from diverse mammalian poxviruses, but mouse SAMD9L is resistant to the C7 homolog encoded by a group of poxviruses with a narrow host range in ruminants, indicating that host species-specific difference in SAMD9/SAMD9L genes serves as a barrier for cross-species poxvirus transmission.",

In particular, zoonotic viral infections have caused such lethal human diseases as SARS, avian influenza, human monkeypox, and Ebola [1] . For many viruses, including coronaviruses and influenza viruses, host species-specific difference in viral entry receptors presents a major hurdle for cross-species transmission [2] . Poxviruses, however, can enter nearly any animal cell [3] . Why many poxviruses show strict host species specificity and what it would take for them to jump to new hosts are less clear [4] . Poxviruses include many lethal animal and human pathogens [5] , the most infamous of which is the smallpox-causing variola virus. Smallpox was successfully eradicated mainly through a global immunization program with vaccinia virus (VACV), and routine VACV vaccination had since discontinued. The human population is now vulnerable to zoonotic orthopoxvirus infection, as some extant poxviruses related to variola virus are capable of infecting a wide variety of wild and domestic animals. There are also many poxviruses with a more restricted host range [6] . For example, capripoxviruses, consisting of sheeppox virus, goatpox virus, and lumpy skin disease virus, have a very narrow host-range in ruminants, causing economically significant diseases in sheep, goats, and cattle, respectively. Host-restricted poxviruses have been exploited as safe vectors for vaccines, gene therapy or oncolytic viral therapies, although the basis for their host restriction is largely unknown [4] .",

VACV replication in most mammalian cell lines requires either K1L or C7L [7] , and the deletion of both genes from VACV aborts the replication prior to viral late gene expression [9] . K1L is only present in VACV and a few related orthopoxviruses, but a C7L homolog that functions nearly identically to VACV C7L is present in most mammalian poxviruses [10] . SAMD9 (Sterile Alpha Motif Domain-containing 9) was found to be the restriction factor in human cell lines that blocked the replication of poxvirus mutants that lack K1L and C7L-like genes [11] .

Humans and many other mammals also encode a chromosomally adjacent paralog of SAMD9 named SAMD9-like (SAMD9L). Human SAMD9 and SAMD9L are ubiquitously expressed in many tissues [17] , and their expression can be further induced by interferons [18, 19] . Evolutionary analysis suggested that the two paralogs derived from the duplication of an ancestral gene early in mammalian evolution and that some mammalian species suffered a loss of either SAMD9 or SAMD9L [20] . Notably, mice lack SAMD9, while many ruminants lack SAMD9L. Mouse SAMD9L is also a tumor suppressor, and haploinsufficiency of mouse SAMD9L resulted in myeloid malignancies [21] . The molecular functions of SAMD9 family of proteins remain largely elusive, but recent sequence analysis predicted a complex domain architecture suggestive of a regulative function of a putative signal transduction network [22] .",

Moreover, whether SAMD9L plays a role in host defense is unknown. We studied the function of SAMD9L from a host that lacks SAMD9 (mice) as well as a host that maintains both paralogs (humans). We found that SAMD9L functions nearly identically to SAMD9 as a host restriction factor and that overcoming SAMD9/SAMD9L (SAMD9/L) restriction is essential for poxvirus replication and pathogenesis. We also discovered some host species-specific difference in SAMD9/L and some poxvirus species-specific difference in antagonizing SAMD9/L, suggesting that these differences contribute to the barrier for crossspecies poxvirus infection.",

Mouse is one of the mammalian species that have lost SAMD9 gene, and a previous study suggested that mouse SAMD9L was not a functional paralog of human SAMD9 in terms of the tumor suppressor function [23] . However, mouse cells, such as NIH 3T3 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), restricted the replication of vK1L -C7L - [24] . To test whether mouse SAMD9L (mSAMD9L) might be the restriction factor for vK1L -C7L -, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to knock out mSAMD9L from 3T3 cells. To control for potential off-target effect, we performed two independent knockouts with different guide sequences. To confirm the gene knockout, cell clones were isolated, and the mSAMD9L genotype of representative clones from the two knockouts (named \u0394mSAMD9L#1 and \u0394mSAMD9L#2) was determined by sequencing. All mSAMD9L alleles of the cell clones were found to contain indels, resulting predominantly in frameshift (S1A Fig) . While vK1L -C7Lwas unable to replicate in the parental 3T3 cells, it replicated well in \u0394mSAMD9L#1 ( Fig 1A) and \u0394mSAMD9L#2 (S1B Fig) cells, resulting in nearly 100-fold increase of viral titer after 24 hours of infection. Moreover, while vK1L -C7Lwas sensitive to interferons (IFNs) in permissive human cells [24, 25] , its growth in \u0394mSAMD9L cells was not inhibited by pretreating the cells with IFN-\u03b2 ( Fig 1A) .",

This panel of viruses were used for comparing the function of different C7 homologs in the same viral background, and they served as a surrogate model for different mammalian poxviruses in terms of their ability to overcome SAMD9 restriction. Studies of these viruses showed that the C7 homologs from many mammalian poxviruses, including myxoma virus (MYXV; infect rabbits) MYXV-M62, Yaba-like diseases virus (YLDV; infect monkeys) YLDV-67, swinepox virus (SWPV) SWPV-064, and sheeppox virus (SPPV) SPPV-063, could bind human SAMD9 and overcome its restriction [12] . All these C7 homologs, except for SPPV-063, could also overcome the restriction of vK1L -C7Lby mouse cell lines [24] . To determine vK1L -C7Lvirulence was restored in SAMD9L -/mice. Littermates from SAMD9L +/mice were grouped according to their SAMD9L genotypes and infected intranasally with vK1L -C7Lor mock infected (PBS). The body weight change following the infection (average and standard deviation) is shown for each group. \" \u00c3 \" indicates statistically significant difference (p <0.05 by two way ANOVA analysis). n denotes group size. WT VACV WR strain was used as a control in C. (D,E,F). The C7 homolog from sheeppox virus (SPPV-063) has a host-species specific defect in mice. Same as A except the viruses used were vSPPV-063 (D), vSWPV-064 (E), or vVACV-C7 (F), which are vK1L -C7L --derived viruses that expressed SPPV-063, SWPV-064 or VACV-C7, respectively. whether the defect of SPPV-063 in mouse cell lines reflects a host species-specific defect, we studied the mouse virulence of vSPPV-063, the vK1L -C7L --derived recombinant virus that expressed SPPV-063. Swinepox virus SWPV-064 is the closest homolog of SPPV-063, so vSWPV-064, the vK1L -C7L --derived recombinant virus that expressed SWPV-064, was used as the control. Similar to vK1L -C7L -, vSPPV-063 did not result in significant body weight loss in SAMD9L +/or SAMD9L +/+ mice but caused lethal intranasal infection in SAMD9L -/mice ( Fig  2D) . In contrast, the same dose of vSWPV-064 was lethal to SAMD9L +/+ and SAMD9L +/mice as well as to SAMD9L -/mice (Fig 2E) . In a separate experiment, vVACV-C7, the vK1L -C7L -derived recombinant virus that expressed VACV-C7, was also lethal to SAMD9L +/+ and SAMD9L +/mice ( Fig 2F) . As SPPV-063 can overcome SAMD9 restriction in human cells, these data show that SPPV-063 has a host species-specific defect in mice. VACV K1, C7 and C7 homologs from diverse poxviruses could bind mSAMD9L, but the sheeppox virus C7 homolog has a specific defect due to the variation of two amino acids A biochemical basis for SAMD9 antagonism by the poxvirus proteins is their binding of SAMD9 [12] , so we next studied the binding of mSAMD9L by the viral proteins. Due to the lack of a specific antibody to mSAMD9L, a plasmid encoding a flag-epitope tagged mSAMD9L was used in transfection of 293 cells, which were subsequently infected with recombinant viruses expressing different V5-tagged viral proteins. Pulldown of VACV-K1, VACV-C7, MYXV-M62, SWPV-064 or YLDV-67 also precipitated mSAMD9L ( Fig 3A) . However, SPPV-063 failed to co-precipitate mSAMD9L. As expected, MYXV-M63 and MYXV-M64, which are two additional C7 homologs from MYXV previously known not to bind human SAMD9 [12] , also failed to co-precipitate mSAMD9L.",

The same substitution was found to result in the binding of SPPV-063 with mSAMD9L ( Fig 3B) .

            "text": "To ensure that the HeLa cell results are representative of the phenotype in human cells, we performed similar knockout studies in a variety of human cells that we identified to be restrictive of the replication of vK1L -C7L -. These include normal human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) and cancer cells derived from skin (A431), breast (HS578T and MDA-MB-231), cervix (HT-3), prostate (PC-3) and ovary (SKOV3). We transduced these cells with a lentivirus expressing a gRNA targeting either hSAMD9 or hSAMD9L and pooled the stably transduced cells. The SAMD9 and SAMD9L protein level in the pooled cells was reduced but not eliminated as in the clonally selected HeLa knockout cells (S4A & S5A Figs) , presumably because the targeted gene was repaired with in-frame indels in a fraction of the cells. Thus, the cells were conservatively speaking gene knockdown instead of knockout cells. Nevertheless, the results were similar to that in knockout HeLa cells. The HFFs were less stringent than the HeLa cells in restricting vK1L -C7L -, allowing the viral titer increase by~3-fold after 24 Thus, in all human cells that we have tested, the basal level of hSAMD9 as well as IFNinduced hSAMD9L are both capable of restricting vK1L -C7Lreplication. VACV K1, C7 and C7 homologs from diverse poxviruses could overcome hSAMD9L restriction, but the sheeppox virus C7 homolog has reduced potency due to the variation of two residues To find out whether mammalian poxviruses could overcome the restriction of hSAMD9L, we induced hSAMD9L expression in \u0394hSAMD9 HeLa cells with 200 U/ml of IFN-\u03b2 and then infected the cells with our panel of vK1L -C7L --derived VACVs. Viruses that expressed VACV-K1, VACV-C7, MYXV-M62, SPPV-063, SWPV-064 and YLDV-67 (but not MYXV-M63 and MYXV-M64) grew in IFN-treated \u0394hSAMD9 cells (Fig 5A) , indicating that all known SAMD9 antagonists could also antagonize hSAMD9L. We then studied these viral proteins for binding of hSAMD9L. While MYXV-M63 (S6 Fig) and MYXV-M64 did not co-precipitate hSAMD9L, VACV-K1, VACV-C7, MYXV-M62, YLDV-67, SPPV-063 and SWPV-064 co-precipitated hSAMD9L (Fig 5B) . Among them, SPPV-063 precipitated a lower amount of hSAMD9L, indicating a reduced affinity. This defect was again due to residue 134 and 135 of SPPV-063, as substitution of these two residues increased the precipitation of hSAMD9L without affecting the precipitation of hSAMD9 (S6 Fig). To determine whether the weaker hSAMD9L binding affinity by SPPV-063 resulted in reduced inhibitory potency, we induced an increasingly higher level of hSAMD9L from \u0394hSAMD9 HeLa cells with IFN-\u03b2 and then infected the cells with either vSPPV-063 or vSWPV-064. The two viruses grew equally well in untreated \u0394hSAMD9 cells, reaching similar titers after 24 hours of infection (Fig 5C) . The viral yields were gradually reduced by the increasing concentrations of IFN-\u03b2, and the magnitudes of the reduction were significantly larger for vSPPV-063 than for vSWPV-064 when the interferon concentration was greater than 250 U/ml, indicating that SPPV-063 is less effective than SWPV-064 at antagonizing hSAMD9L. Discussion SAMD9 was recently identified as a restriction factor for poxviruses in human cell lines [11, 14] . However, whether SAMD9 is important for host defense against poxvirus pathogenesis and whether similar antiviral defense exists in other mammals, especially those that lack a SAMD9 ortholog, were not established. In this study, we showed that the SAMD9 paralog, SAMD9L, from mammalian species as diverse as mice and humans, functions similarly to human SAMD9 as a poxvirus restriction factor. Since at least one of the two paralogs is present in all mammals with a completely sequenced genome [20] , our finding indicates that SAMD9 and/or SAMD9L-mediated antiviral defense is conserved in mammals. This conservation allowed us to use the mouse model to reveal the critical role of SAMD9/L in host defense against poxvirus pathogenesis. Studies of SAMD9/L from two different mammalian species and the SAMD9/L inhibitors from diverse mammalian poxviruses revealed some host speciesspecific difference in SAMD9/L, which could serve as a barrier for cross-species poxvirus infection. This knowledge could be useful in assessing the potential of a given poxvirus in switching or expanding its host range.",

            "text": "Human is one of the mammalian species that have both SAMD9 and SAMD9L, located head-to-tail in adjacent positions of the same chromosome. Previous phylogenetic studies suggested that SAMD9 and SAMD9L originated from a common ancestor through an ancient gene duplication event [20] . Gene duplications have a major role in evolution of new biological functions [27] . With about 60% amino acid sequence identity, human SAMD9 and SAMD9L could have diverged to take on different functions. This idea would be consistent with the previous findings that loss-of-function mutations in only SAMD9 cause NFTC in humans [15] and that knockdown of SAMD9 was sufficient for abolishing the restriction for vK1L -C7Lin several human cell lines [14, 26] . We were thus initially surprised to find that human SAMD9L functioned similarly to SAMD9 as a restriction factor for poxviruses. The advent of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique made it possible to readily knock out one or both of the human paralogs from various human cells. The knockouts in tumor cell lines from various tissues and the normal human foreskin fibroblasts showed that both SAMD9 and SAMD9L, when sufficiently expressed, could inhibit vK1L -C7Lreplication. In many human cells, the basal level of SAMD9 is sufficient for restricting vK1L -C7L -, but SAMD9L has to be induced by IFN to have the same effect. This probably only reflects a difference in gene regulation of the two paralogs in human cells but not any real difference in their potency or mechanism of action. Mouse SAMD9L is also an interferon-stimulated gene [28] , but the basal level of SAMD9L in mouse cells is sufficient for restricting vK1L -C7L -, again suggesting that the role of IFN in SAMD9L function is merely to induce SAMD9L to a sufficient level in some cell types. Similarly, the only contribution made by K1 and C7 in vaccinia virus antagonism of IFN or IRF1 [24, 25] is likely the inhibition of IFN-or IRF1-induced SAMD9/L, as vK1L -C7Lwas not sensitive to IFN in cells that had SAMD9/L knockout.",

GoF SAMD9 mutations cause MIRAGE (myelodysplasia, infection, restriction of growth, adrenal hypoplasia, genital phenotypes, and enteropathy) disorder [29] , while GoF SAMD9L mutations cause a similar disorder characterized with cytopenia, immunodeficiency, and neurological symptoms [19, 30] . In both cases, the GoF mutations predispose to myelodysplastic syndrome by facilitating the selection for a loss of the chromosome that contain the mutations [19, 30] . So why are both SAMD9 and SAMD9L kept in humans and many other mammals? We can only postulate that the duplication of SAMD9 gene and the divergence of sequence and expression pattern represent a strategy for retaining two drastically different \"alleles\" of SAMD9/L in the same host without the deleterious effect of both genes being constitutively active. Having two different alleles of SAMD9/L would have given the hosts more flexibility to rapidly evolve SAMD9/L to evade the viral inhibitors, perhaps during a time of mammalian evolution when the challenge from poxviruses was particularly rampant. Phylogenetic analysis has showed that both SAMD9 and SAMD9L genes have been subjected to sustained positive selection [20] .",

            "text": "Corresponding to the conservation of SAMD9/L in mammals, the distribution of SAMD9/ SAMD9L inhibitors in mammalian poxviruses are also very broad. Nearly all mammalian poxviruses encode a C7 homolog that provides a host-range function similar to VACV C7 [10, 24, 31] , and a few poxviruses also encode K1 (Fig 6) . All the functional C7 homologs and K1 were previously shown to bind and inhibit human SAMD9 [11, 12, 14] . The breadth of their antagonistic activities is now expanded to include human and mouse SAMD9L. Among the C7 homologs from a wide variety of different mammalian poxvirus, the one from sheeppox virus, SPPV-063, stands out as the only one that displays a specificity for SAMD9. SPPV-063 could bind and inhibit human SAMD9, but it has reduced potency against human SAMD9L and failed to inhibit mouse SAMD9L. Remarkably, its binding to mouse SAMD9L could be restored simply by substituting two residues, suggesting that subtle difference between SAMD9 and SAMD9L might be responsible for their different ability in resisting SPPV-63. Interesting, these two residues are only adjacent to the \"three-fingered molecular claw\" that is critical for SAMD9 binding [12] , indicating that they may modulate the conformation of \"the claw\" to influence its binding specificity. Sheeppox virus, goatpox virus, and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) are members of the capripoxvirus genus with a narrow host-range in ruminants. All capripoxviruses encode a nearly identical C7 homolog (>97% identical) as SPPV-063, with the same residues at position 134 and 135, suggesting that they all preferentially antagonize SAMD9. This correlates with the loss of SAMD9L in ruminants. Thus, one evolutionary scenario is that the ancestor of SPPV-063 could tolerate genetic drift that only disrupted SAMD9L binding, after the ancestor of extant capripoxviruses established a niche host in ruminants and was no longer restricted by SAMD9L. While the resulted failure of capripoxviruses in antagonizing mouse SAMD9L could account for the host restriction of capripoxviruses in mice, the resulted reduction in potency against interferon-induced human SAMD9L could only partly explain the host restriction of capripoxviruses in humans. We suspect that similar genetic drift might have occurred to other capripoxvirus host-range genes, resulting in their specialization to the ruminant hosts and altogether contributing to the host restriction of capripoxviruses in non-ruminant hosts. This idea is supported by a previous report that the sheeppox virus homolog of VACV host range gene E3 failed to provide the host range function in HeLa cells [32] . That mouse SAMD9L is completely resistant to SPPV-063 while human SAMD9L is only partially resistant could have been the result of a stronger positive selection in rodents, perhaps by some poxviruses that have similar inhibitory profile as the capripoxviruses. Overall, our studies suggest that host species-specific difference in SAMD9/L gene repertoire contributes to the barrier for cross-species poxvirus transmission.",

The light chain of the precipitated antibody (Ig LC) serves as a loading control. Due to space limitation, lysate of YLDV-67 sample was not loaded on the same gel. (B). Substitution of residue 134 and 135 of SPPV-063 restored binding to mSAMD9L.
