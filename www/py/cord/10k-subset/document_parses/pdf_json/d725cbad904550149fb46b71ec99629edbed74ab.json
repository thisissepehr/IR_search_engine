Hepcidin is a \u03b2-defensin-like antimicrobial peptide and acts as a principal iron regulatory hormone. Hepcidin is mostly produced by hepatocytes, but is also expressed by other cells, such as airway epithelial cells. However, nothing is known about its function in lung infections and inflammatory diseases. We therefore sought to investigate the role of airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin in sepsis-induced acute lung injury. Methods: Acute lung injury was induced by polymicrobial sepsis via cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery. Adenovirus-mediated short hairpin RNA specific for the mouse hepcidin gene hepc1 and control adenovirus were intratracheally injected into mice. The adenovirus-mediated knockdown of hepcidin in airway epithelial cells was evaluated in vivo. Lung injury and the seven-day survival rate were assessed. The levels of hepcidin-related iron export protein ferroportin were measured, and the iron content and function of alveolar macrophages were evaluated. Results: The hepcidin level in airway epithelial cells was upregulated during polymicrobial sepsis. The knockdown of airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin aggravated the polymicrobial sepsis-induced lung injury and pulmonary bacterial infection and increased mortality (53.33% in Ad-shHepc1-treated mice versus 12.5% in Ad-shNeg-treated mice, P <0.05). The knockdown of hepcidin in airway epithelial cells also led to reduced ferroportin degradation and a low intracellular iron content in alveolar macrophages. Moreover, alveolar macrophages form the airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin knockdown mice showed impaired phagocytic ability than those from the control mice.",

The incidence of ALI has been reported to be 190,000 cases per year in the United States, and sepsis is one of the most commonly encountered conditions underlying the development of ALI [1, 4] . Through advances in supportive care, the mortality rate for patients with ALI/ARDS has decreased over time but still remains high [5, 6] . Therefore, elucidating the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS is necessary and may help with the development of novel therapeutic targets for ALI/ARDS. The lung is exposed to a large number of potentially pathogenic microorganisms that are inhaled. To protect this vital organ against infection and inflammation, many defense mechanisms have been evolved in the lung to prevent the development of pulmonary infections. The secretion of endogenous cationic antimicrobial peptides by epithelial cells onto the airway surface represents an important component of immune defense in the lung [7] [8] [9] . Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of these antimicrobial peptides, such as defensins and cathelicidin, in the pulmonary immune system and in pulmonary diseases [10] [11] [12] .",

Hepcidin not only shows antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts, but also functions as a principal iron regulatory hormone [13] [14] [15] . Hepcidin binds to the iron export protein ferroportin and induces its internalization and degradation, which leads to decreased cellular iron export and increased intracellular iron retention [16, 17] . Because iron is an essential nutrient for all organisms, hepcidin also restricts the iron available to invading microbes, thereby enhancing the host defense against pathogens [17] [18] [19] . Furthermore, hepcidin can modulate the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute inflammatory response via the suppression of cytokine expression [20, 21] . The multiple functions of hepcidin suggest its importance in the host immune response to infection and inflammation. Recent studies have reported that in addition to being produced mainly by hepatocytes, hepcidin is also expressed by other cells, such as airway epithelial cells (AECs) [22] . However, the role of AECderived hepcidin in pulmonary immune defense against infection and inflammation remains unknown.",

The expression clone was then generated by recombination of pENTR/U6 entry construct and pAd/BLOCK-IT-DEST vector using BLOCK-iT Adenoviral RNAi Expression System (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After digested by endonuclease PacI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), the recombinant adenoviral plasmid was transfected into 293A cells. The harvested adenovirus was concentrated and purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation. Viral titer was determined using Adeno-X Rapid Titer Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). The recombinant virus and control virus were named Ad-shHepc1 and Ad-shNeg, respectively. To generate a mouse model of AEC-derived hepcidin knockdown, Ad-shHepc1 or Ad-shNeg (approximately 2.2 \u00d7 10 11 viral particles) was intratracheally injected into the mice after anesthesia with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)). To improve the knockdown efficiency, a second administration of the adenovirus was performed 72 hours later. Twelve days after the first injection, the mice were ready used in the experiments.",

The cecum was then exposed, isolated, and ligated with a 4-0 silk ligature just distal to the ileocecal valve to avoid intestinal obstruction. The puncture was performed twice with a 22-gauge needle. Then, the cecum was repositioned, and the incision was closed with a 4-0 sterile suture. Sham-operated mice were underwent the same procedure but without ligation and needle perforation of the cecum. At the end of the operation, the mice were resuscitated immediately by the subcutaneous administration of saline (1 ml/mouse) and allowed free access to food and water after awakening. In the experiment to evaluate the survival rate, the mice were monitored for survival every six to twelve hours until seven days post-CLP.",

A recent study reported that hepcidin is expressed in AECs in response to interferon-\u03b3 [22] . In the current study, an increased hepcidin level in AECs was observed during polymicrobial sepsis. Because the lung is the first vital organ that is adversely affected at the onset of sepsis [31] , the elevated expression of hepcidin may protect the mice against lung injury. To support this hypothesis, knockdown of hepcidin in AECs exacerbated sepsisinduced lung injury (Figure 3 ). Considering that disruption of hepcidin has a deleterious effect, a low severity of CLP model was used in the current study. Since the underlying pathophysiology of sepsis is based on the severity grade of the CLP model, the increase in lung injury parameter such as wet/dry weight ratio was minuscule but significantly different.",

Hepcidin can trigger ferroportin polyubiquitination and induce ferroportin endocytosis [32, 33] . In the lung, AECs express high levels of hepcidin and are the main source of local hepcidin production. Alveolar macrophages express ferroportin and are therefore target cells for hepcidin [22] . In the present study, knockdown of hepcidin in AECs impacted its interaction with ferroportin, and prevented degradation of the ferroportin protein in both alveolar macrophages and the Figure 1 The expression of hepcidin in airway epithelial cells (AEC) was upregulated after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery. Hepcidin expression was examined by immunohistochemistry. A representative image is presented (magnification: \u00d7400) and quantified data are shown. n = 6 mice/group. *P <0.005. lung, which consequently caused intracellular iron export into the pulmonary microenvironment. The elevated iron in the lung can be used not only for invading pathogen growth and replication, resulting in more virulent and persistent infections [18] , but also to generate reactive oxygen species, leading to cell damage and lung injury [34, 35] . On the other hand, a recent study showed that iron status could impact cytoskeleton rearrangement, which is important for the phagocytic process in macrophages [36] . Indeed, the alveolar macrophages from Ad-shHepc1-treated mice showed less phagocytosis ability than those from the control animals. Since liver is the major source of systemic hepcidin, in the current study liver hepcidin levels were not affected and circulating iron concentrations were comparable between the Ad-shNeg-and Ad-shHepc1-treated mice. Therefore, the function of circulating leukocytes should not be influenced. Although the inciting injury (CLP) is remote, when the bacteria circulating in the blood stream invaded the lung after CLP, the decreased phagocytosis function of the alveolar macrophages from the Ad-shHepc1-treated mice could result in bacterial accumulation in the lung. In addition, as hepcidin exhibits broad spectrum antimicrobial properties [37] , the knockdown of hepcidin may contribute to more severe pulmonary infections and lung injuries.",

The contradictory findings between the current study and Frazier's study may result from the difference between the in vivo model and ex vivo model used and the nature of hepcidin peptide. Moreover, limited by the sensitivity of the Prussian blue staining method, the iron content in the AECs was undetectable in this study.
