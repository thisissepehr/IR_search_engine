Historically, the most attention has been paid to RSV infections in infants and in the moderately to severely immunocompromised and less to infection in the population described by Ackerson et al [1] , namely, adults >60 years old. Unlike previous reports comparing hospitalization in RSV and influenza virus infections, the authors found a higher incidence of hospitalizations lasting \u22657 days in the RSV cohort than in the influenza virus cohort, which they suggest may reflect the increased use in recent years of antivirals directed at influenza virus, but not RSV. They reported that 47.1% of RSV-infected and 78.6% of influenza virus-infected individuals received antiviral therapy during the hospitalization period; 99% received oseltamivir, even though oseltamivir has no activity against RSV [2] .",

Vaccines and new antivirals are being tested, but they are not yet available for daily practice. The aging population, however, may benefit from using oral ribavirin, which has been described in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell and lung transplantation [4] . Although evidence from randomized controlled trials is lacking, ribavirin treatment may have a beneficial effect in reducing morbidity and mortality rates or improving recovery of pulmonary function after RSV infection in transplant recipients [5] [6] [7] . As shown elsewhere, oral ribavirin may not be inferior to inhaled therapy in this population and may provide a good and affordable treatment option [8, 9] . Whether these data can also be applied to the population of older adults remains to be confirmed.",

This is especially important in the light of upcoming (and probably expensive) new antivirals, for which ribavirin could be considered as an active comparator. Furthermore, considering the high incidence and availability of quick diagnostic methods for RSV, we deem such a study not only needed but also certainly feasible.

            "text": "Despite a paucity of clinical trial data, there is evidence from several retrospective studies that ribavirin (RBV), sometimes given with immunomodulating agents, appears to reduce the risk of progression of RSV disease and RSVassociated morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, particularly in lung and hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients [3] . As de Zwart et al note, determining whether similar benefits of RBV extend to older adults infected with RSV can best be answered by well-controlled clinical trials. As they also observe, oral RBV is an attractive option given its ease of administration, greater safety for patients and healthcare personnel, and reduced cost yet similar efficacy compared to aerosolized RBV in HCT recipients with RSV infection [4] . However, antiviral agents given after progression of RSV from upper to lower respiratory infection and suppression of viral replication alone may not always prevent progressive pulmonary dysfunction associated with RSV disease that likely contributes to the severe morbidity and mortality observed [5, 6] . Hence, early identification of RSV infection and prompt initiation of antiviral therapy, possibly combined with immunomodulating agents, chest physiotherapy, and other interventions may be important to improving outcomes following RSV infection, particularly in patients at risk of severe disease [3, 7] . Given the limited benefit of RBV in the treatment of RSV disease in some high-risk populations [8] , we are hopeful that RSV vaccines and therapeutic agents with efficacy against RSV-disease in a broad range of populations become available soon.",
