In the United States, it has been estimated that as many as one hospital patient in ten acquires a nosocomial infection, or 2 million patients a year (Weinstein 1998) . Nosocomial infections contributed to 88,000 deaths in the US in 1995. In France, 6.9% of hospitalized patients acquire nosocomial infections; the overall prevalence of 7.5% comes from an average 1.1 infections per patient. The rate is up to 30% in intensive care units. These patients must stay in the hospital 4-5 additional days.

One study of three hospital systems in Avon, England in 2002 -2003 found that outbreaks of nosocomial gastroenteritis cost over US$1 million (including lost bed-days and staff absence), and extrapolated to estimate a cost of nearly US$200 million for all of England during the same time period (Lopman et al. 2004) .

But few studies have focused specifically on other simple preventive measures which could be applied to control nosocomial epidemic risk for pediatric rotavirus outbreaks, like hand washing or disinfection, although their effectiveness has been proven (Fruhwirth et al. 2001) . Studies have shown that it is nearly impossible to maintain compliance levels for such measures above about 50% among health care workers (HCWs) without an ongoing, continually renewed education/reminder campaigns in which the HCWs have direct ownership (Pittet et al. 2000) , as the effects of limited-term campaigns tend to be transient (Avila-Ag\u00fcero et al. 1998 ). Rotavirus is not transmitted exclusively via contaminated individuals serving as vectors: one study of 31 pediatric wards in French hospitals identified having fewer than 20 beds per ward, keeping patients in their rooms, and keeping patients' doors closed as other measures that had strong correlations with lower incidences of diarrheal infections (Jusot et al. 2003 ) (other measures may not have shown significant as predictors because all the wards in the study followed them). However, many notable rotavirus outbreaks have occurred in wards for very young children (including infants) (Cone et al. 1988; Ringenbergs et al. 1989; Rodrigues et al. 2007) , where patients are largely restricted to their rooms and isolation from other patients is simpler to arrange. These same studies showed a significant proportion of asymptomatic infections (Gleizes et al. 2006) , where transmission is unlikely except through direct contact with bodily excretions.

These studies especially emphasized the role of cohorting in infection control, assuming that nursing staff, associated with a single ward, can be assigned to specific disjoint subsets of patients, so as to restrict the spread of pathogen contamination, while physicians and other medical staff which serve the entire hospital cannot be so restricted, creating potential for infection spread across cohorts.

Therefore, cohorting which preserves \u03c9 by partitioning a ward into smaller parts, for each of which the HCW-patient ratio is the same as the average for the entire ward, will under the deterministic model yield the same prevalence as no cohorting, as long as CAD cases admitted to the ward are distributed evenly to all cohorts, which is likely to be true in the mean as long as ward occupancy rates are near 100%, as assumed. In this case, it will make no difference whether the cohorting is perfect or not (that is, whether all staff are restricted to contacting patients in a single cohort, or whether some staff, typically physicians and diagnosticians, make contact with patients in several cohorts). Of course, if all diagnosed CAD cases are admitted to a cohort reserved for this purpose, it would significantly limit nosocomial transmission, but the fact that a quarter or more of CAD patients are admitted with asymptomatic infections would require specific testing (as done in some studies) in order for such a designated cohort to be efficient, a move that could be expensive. The deterministic model can therefore only measure the likely effect of controlling B and W via changes in their ratio \u03c9. As seen in (9), R c is inversely proportional to \u03c9 since the HCW-patient contact rate is determined entirely by patient need: a constant number of total contacts per patient per day means that the more HCWs there are, the fewer contacts per day each of them has with patients, and therefore the less frequently has the chance to receive or pass on rotavirus exposure. Adding a single HCW to the default scenario of 5 HCWs for a 21-bed ward reduces R c from 0.870 to 0.794, mean cumulative prevalence after 90 days (henceforth CumPrev90) from 14.0% to 11.6%, and the mean number of HAD cases present at 90 days from 2.9 to 2.5. If one instead doubles the number of HCWs to 10 (thereby doubling \u03c9), these indices reduce further, to 0.615, 6.73%, and 1.76 cases, respectively. Doubling the number of HCWs to halve the number of HAD cases, however, may not be especially cost-effective, and healthcare facilities are generally already operating with as many staff as they can afford.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "HCW-Patient Ratio and Ward Size"}, {"text": "On the other hand, the CTMC model analyzed in Sect. 4 already showed signs there of the effects of discretization and small population size, and suggests that ward (or cohort) size does affect overall prevalence.

(We use 20 beds as a reference case here, as it is the closest possible size to the reported mean of 21 which allows scaling down with \u03c9 preserved.) As can be seen, the larger the ward size, the closer the stochastic mean is to the deterministic solution, and the smaller the 95% interval. Perfect cohorting (complete isolation of HCWs in each cohort from patients assigned to other cohorts) is therefore likely to result in a lower mean HAD prevalence than no cohorting, due to this discretization effect. Perfect cohorting also means, however, that when a cohort does receive a patient infected with rotavirus, the other patients in that cohort receive a higher concentration of contacts with HCWs who contact the infected patient than they might without cohorting. Consequently, the proportion of patients in that cohort who become infected may be markedly higher than it would be otherwise (as evidenced by the higher top quantile for the 4-bed case).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 213, "end": 221, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "HCW-Patient Ratio and Ward Size"}, {"text": "The CTMC model also shows a similar convergence of the mean cumulative prevalence to that of the deterministic model as the number of HCWs increases for a fixed ward size B; in addition to the reduction in the number of cases observed in the deterministic model as \u03c9 increases, CumPrev90, expressed as a proportion of the prevalence in the deterministic model, increases from 74% for 1 HCW to 80% for 5 HCWs to 90% for 10 HCWs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "HCW-Patient Ratio and Ward Size"}, {"text": "In short, increasing the HCW-patient ratio reduces infection when the amount of attention each patient receives is based on his/her needs rather than the number of available staff, but this factor alone is unlikely to justify the high marginal operating costs thereby incurred.
