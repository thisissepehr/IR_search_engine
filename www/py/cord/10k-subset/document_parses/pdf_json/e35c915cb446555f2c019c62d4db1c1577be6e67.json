The \"Free Radical Theory of Ageing\" (FTRA) posits that a high metabolic rate causes mitochondrial heteroplasmy and the progressive ageing phenotype. Contrary to this, bats are the longest-lived order of mammals given their small size and high metabolic rate. To investigate if bats exhibit increased mitochondrial heteroplasmy with age, we performed targeted, deep sequencing of mitogenomes and measured point heteroplasmy in wild, long lived Myotis myotis. Blood was sampled from 195 individuals, aged between <1 and at 6+ years old, and whole mitochondria deep-sequenced, with a subset sampled over multiple years. The majority of heteroplasmies were at a low frequency and were transitions. Oxidative mutations were present in only a small number of individuals, suggesting local oxidative stress events. Cohort data showed no significant increase in heteroplasmy with age, while longitudinal data from recaptured individuals showed heteroplasmy is dynamic, and does not increase uniformly over time. We show that bats do not suffer from the predicted, inevitable increase in heteroplasmy as posited by the FRTA, instead heteroplasmy was found to be dynamic, questioning its presumed role as a primary driver of ageing.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Sequencing and Quality Control. 252 samples were sequenced obtaining a total of 72,111,278 read pairs prior to quality control.

Stringent quality control (QC) resulted in loss of more than 20% of raw data. 20 samples were deemed unreliable after testing the effect of PCR duplicate removal. Average coverage of samples ranged from 142 to 7800X. 4 samples with average coverage below 1000X were removed. 12 which failed initial QC tests were re-sequenced, and the same quality control steps as before were performed. 4 re-sequenced samples were retained after quality control. A total of 232 samples were retained for further downstream analysis. The average coverage of the 232 QC passed samples was 3837X, ranging from 1355 to 7800X. Sample Demography. As the individuals have been tagged with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags since 2010, it was possible to identify which samples belonged to a unique individual, and know the age for each individual. For individuals caught first as an adult only a minimum bound for the age was known. The 232 QC passed samples included 88 juveniles (<1 years old), and 143 adults (>1 years old) and one individual for which age could not be reliably assigned ( Table 1 ). The 232 samples represent 195 unique individuals (Table 2) , with 21 individuals sampled two, three or four times over consecutive years. All juveniles are 0 years old, with adult samples ranging from 1 years old to at least 7 (hence denoted as 7+). 167 unique individuals aged between 0-5 and a \"6+\" cohort were used to investigate the relationship between heteroplasmy and age ( Table 2 ). Simulation Results. 9 read sets were generated using GemSIM 46 , ranging from 50 to 25,000X coverage. Each read set was analysed using one of three callers, LoFreq, VarScan or FreeBayes, producing 27 variant call sets, which were given a score between 0 and 1 defined as (Power*Accuracy)*(1-False Positive Rate) (described in full in Material and Methods, Variant Simulation). LoFreq was the best scoring caller (Supp. Fig. 1) , and used to call heteroplasmies in all empirical datasets. FreeBayes consistently had the highest power, detecting more than 85% of true variants even at coverages as low 100\u00d7, however, FreeBayes also exhibited a false positive rate >5% at all coverages. LoFreq and VarScan had extremely low error rates, with each detecting only one false positive in the 27 variant call sets.

Sites were called as heteroplasmic if they were heterozygous with an intra-individual minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 1%, Fig. 1A . The frequency of minor alleles was strongly skewed toward low frequency variants. Figure 1B shows a histogram of number of heteroplasmies by MAF for all 254 heteroplasmies. The vast majority, 77.6%, of heteroplasmies were below 5% MAF. The low MAF found for the majority of heteroplasmies suggests these are likely somatic. However, it is not possible to distinguish between somatic and inherited heteroplasmies given the samples are from only one tissue and maternal relationships between individuals are unknown. 210 heteroplasmies were collected from 195 unique individuals, using the most recent sample from recaptured individuals. The difference between the frequency distribution of coding and non-coding heteroplasmies was approaching significance (Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test, p = 0.054) with non-coding heteroplasmies tending to be at lower frequencies. Closer investigation of coding heteroplasmies found nonsynonymous heteroplasmies were at a lower frequency on average than synonymous (Mann-Whitney U-test, p = 0.021 Supp. Fig. 2A ). This also drove the difference observed between coding and non-coding heteroplasmies, as a significant difference was found between the frequency distributions of synonymous and non-coding heteroplasmies, but not between nonsynonymous and non-coding heteroplasmies (KS Test, p = 0.006 and p = 0.374 respectively) (Supp. Fig. 2A) .

Analysis of individual genes revealed ND2, trnaE and trnaN genes were enriched for heteroplasmic sites (\u03a7 2 (1, N = 143) > 3.841, p < 0.05). The majority of sites, 72.7%, were only observed as heteroplasmic in one individual (Fig. 1A) , hereafter called \"private\" heteroplasmies as opposed to \"shared\". While shared heteroplasmies are more likely to be inherited, and shared between maternally related individuals, particular sites within the mitogenome show higher rates of heteroplasmy in unrelated humans 13 , we thus make no assumption as to whether shared and private mutations are somatic or inherited. Private and shared heteroplasmies showed significantly different frequency spectra (KS Test, p = 0.005) with private heteroplasmies at lower average frequency. Private and shared heteroplasmic sites showed similar proportions of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations and no bias toward coding versus non-coding sites (\u03a7 2 (1, N = 143) < 2.706, p > 0.1 in all comparisons). Association between heteroplasmy and age. To test if the number of heteroplasmic sites within an individual showed an association with age we fitted a generalised linear mixed model. The model incorporated age as the sole fixed effect and included sequencing batch as a random effect, with the count of heteroplasmic sites as the negative binomial distributed response variable. Sequencing batch was included as samples from different batches exhibited significantly different numbers of heteroplasmies (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.007). However, the magnitude of the difference in means was small, with a maximum difference of 1.7 heteroplasmies between two batches. Furthermore, batch as a random effect had an estimated variance of 0, indicating the model was degenerate. As such, the simpler generalized linear model with age as the sole fixed effect was retained for further analysis (Table 3) . Two samples within the 6+ cohort were found to be unduly influential points using Cook's Statistic (Supp. Fig. 3A ,B). As such they were removed and the model fit again. With these two samples removed no significant association with age was found (ANOVA, p = 0.1), as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 3 .

The mean change in number of heteroplasmies between two consecutive years across individuals was 0.303 (standard deviation \u00b1 2.52). Of the 33 consecutive intervals (e.g. 2013 to 2014 or 2014 to 2015 etc.) 15 showed no change, 10 showed a decrease and 8 showed an increase (Supp. Fig. 5 ). Not all heteroplasmies were shared between time-points. 14.7% of heteroplasmies were observed in at least two time-points, with 13% shared between all time-points for an individual.

However, though mitochondrial dysfunction and heteroplasmy have been long implicated in ageing, there remains a paucity of data from non-human or non-model organisms to associate increased heteroplasmy as a mechanism underpinning the progressive, ageing phenotype. To this end, for the first time we have deep sequenced, to an average depth of >3500X, whole mitogenomes from 195 M. myotis individuals, and investigated the association between heteroplasmy and age in these long-lived bats. After outlier removal, we found no evidence for an increase in heteroplasmy with age. We also found little to no evidence to support the Free Radical Theory of Ageing, finding no chronic increase in oxidative mutations with age. Through unique, longitudinal sampling we found bats may experience local oxidative stress events followed by removal of the majority of mutations. Nonsynonymous, protein coding mutations were also at a significantly lower frequency than synonymous, and those with predicted deleterious effects were lower again. Together our results suggest M. myotis may remove deleterious mitochondrial DNA mutations, preventing their expansion, to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis, and possibly promoting longevity. This hypothesis will need further investigation. The FRTA posits oxidative mutations in the mitogenome should drive mitochondrial dysfunction 3 . However, many studies have shown a dearth of oxidative mutations in mitochondrial DNA 48 . Studies in model and long-lived non-model organisms have also led many to question this central tenets of the FRTA 19,48-50 . We found little support for the FRTA in M. myotis. Transitions, not oxidative transversions, are the primary source of mutation. Transitions are likely due to errors during DNA replication or spontaneous deamination of nucleosides, rather than damage accrued by oxidative stress 4, 7 . Still, the proportion of heteroplasmies owing to oxidative transversions in M. myotis mitochondrial DNA is much higher than reported in humans 13, 15 . However, the majority of these oxidative mutations were concentrated in only a few individuals. These likely represent local oxidative stress events, rather than a population wide phenomenon. The longitudinal data supports this interpretation as two individuals exhibiting high numbers of oxidative transversions, and some of the highest levels of heteroplasmy, were also sampled the following year (individuals 000702E6B0 and 000702FF51, Fig. 3 ). They had cleared or repaired the majority of the oxidative damage, though each retained at least one of the heteroplasmies from the previous year.

The constitutive expression of interferon or the presence of circulating viruses in bats may lead to acute levels of ROS production in bats enabling them to quickly mediate infection 58, 59 .

One such mechanism is through direct repair of DNA damage. DNA repair genes and pathways have been shown to be evolving or expressed differently in bats compared to other mammals [63] [64] [65] , however, many of these pathways are not active in the mitochondria. Base excision repair (BER) is the primary method of DNA repair in mitochondria. While double strand break repair operates in mitochondria, the mechanisms have not been fully characterised 4 . Another mechanism by which M. myotis may remove oxidative damage is through mitophagy. Mitophagy is a form of autophagy through which cells remove dysfunctional mitochondria. Inhibition of autophagy, and so mitophagy, by knockdown of autophagosome genes has also been shown to lead to increased ROS production 48 . Mitochondria derived ROS have also been shown to promote autophagy during starvation, through oxidation and inactivation of the ATG4 protein 66 . Long lived bats have also been shown to have increased macroautophagy activity in comparison to a short-lived, phylogenetically close sister taxa. Interestingly, other homeostatic mechanisms such as chaperone protein levels and proteasome activity, showed no difference in long and short-lived bats 67 . This suggests long-lived bats rely on autophagy for maintaining homeostasis. Indeed, previous studies have shown that autophagy genes are upregulated in the blood of M. myotis compared to other mammals 65 . Coupled with our results, this suggests M. myotis may possess stringent mitochondrial quality control to prevent accumulation and expansion of deleterious mutations, contrary to what has been shown in humans 13, 15, 16 .

The whole mitogenome of M. myotis was amplified and sequenced using the primers, and sequencing protocols outlined previously 69 . Briefly, samples were enriched for mitochondrial sequences using long range PCR, in two overlapping ~10 kb fragments. Both amplicons were successfully amplified for 252 samples. The two amplicons for each of the 252 samples were purified by vacuum filtration (MilliporeHTS Filtration Plate, cat. no. MAVM0960R), quantified using a nanodrop spectrophotometer and then pooled in equimolar amounts. Pooled amplicons were used to produce sequencing libraries using the Nextera XT preparation kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. Varying numbers of samples were multiplexed and loaded onto an Illumina MiSeq. Quality Control. Raw reads were initially processed using a stringent quality control pipeline prior to variant calling. Samples were trimmed of Illumina and Nextera adapter sequences using Cutadapt (v1.8.3) 70 and The NGS QC Toolkit 71 was used to filter out reads for which 80% of bases had quality scores less than Q30. Due to extreme sequence depths at small target regions in resequencing studies, it is possible that inserts will begin and end at the same position due to chance, called sampling coincidence. Reads from such inserts will be falsely identified as PCR duplicates. However, not removing true PCR duplicates may affect the accuracy of variant calling. In order to remove any potential bias introduced by duplicate removal or retention, we ran the heteroplasmy detection pipeline with duplicates present and removed. As some samples showed extremely high levels of variation between treatments we used the interquartile range to identify and remove outliers. An outlier was defined as any value for which the count value was 2 interquartile ranges below the first quartile or above the third quartile. The mean and standard deviation of these filtered counts was then calculated. A cut-off value of two standard deviations from the mean was rounded down to the nearest integer value. Samples with a difference in counts between the two treatments, which was greater than this cut-off were deemed unreliable and removed from downstream analysis. Finally, average coverage was calculated for each sample using the depth command in samtools (v0. 1.19) 72 .

Prior to variant calling BAM files were processed using Picard Tools (v1.90) 74 and the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK) 75 . Briefly, SAM files were sorted and read groups added using Picard Tools. SAM files were then converted to BAM files and indexed. Prior to base quality recalibration a set of raw variants was produced using the chosen low frequency variant caller, either LoFreq Star 76 or VarScan 2 77 . These raw variants were used as the \"known sites\" necessary for the BQSR walker in the GATK.

Final heteroplasmies were called on the recalibrated data again using the caller of choice. A third variant caller, FreeBayes 78 , does not require recalibrated or realigned data, and so these steps were omitted when FreeBayes was used. For the empirical data, variants with a minor allele frequency greater than 1% and at sites with greater than 1000X coverage were retained.
