He systematically assessed his patients with medical history and physical examination. Hippocrates introduced uroscopy (macroscopic urine examination) as an additional tool for patient evaluation and he believed that uroscopy has an important role not only for diagnosis but also for prognostic purposes. According to Hippocratic references, urinary disorders were classified in the following four categories: difficult urination or dysuria, dropwise urine or strangury, urinary retention and urinary incontinence. Severe disorders of urination appear frequently in descriptions by the Kos medical school implying the impact that such symptoms had on patients.

In 1719 it was re-introduced by John Douglas who realised that a distended bladder could be entered extraperitoneally. This was described by Cheselden in 1722 although he would favour perineal lithotomy for his further practice.

We had performed 13 RPSs and found that resecting the remnant in an antegrade way was sometimes stressful because proximal portion of the remnant was out of sight by camera port in the Lap-protector. We, therefore, developed retrograde approach for remnant resection. The antegrade procedure was followed; we first resected umbilici and urachal ligament as far as possible (2 cm approximately) and then inserted lap protector with 2 port channel into the umbilici defect. Then we resected umbilical ligament (UL) from proximal part towards bladder. This antegrade approach was stressful because dissection of the proximal part of the UL from the small wound of umbilici was physically challenging. We, thus, invented a new method for dissection of umbilical remnant: inserting multichannel port before dissecting umbilici from upper part of the umbilici, and then dissecting median UL and urachal remnant from distant part in a retrograde manner. This new method makes us easily dissect the urachal remnant. Here we describe this new method and compare its surgical result with antegrade approach.",

Patients who are refractory to medical therapy may require a surgical intervention; however, experts recommend against performing a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), as these patients often have a compromised external sphincter and rely on their internal sphincter at the bladder neck for continence.

There is paucity of literature to predict the need for inferior pubectomy in patients with PFUDD. The only available suggestion is by Koratiam who described the bulbourethral index, by measuring the length of bulbar urethra and the length of the gap.

We have modified our protocol with full bladder (which acts as natural contrast) and injecting lignocaine jelly in urethra.

These miRNAs can suppress the expression of Nadc1 and Cldn14, thus enhancing urinary citrate excretion and reducing urinary calcium excretion. Furthermore, systemic delivery of antagomiRs against these miRNAs abolished protection from vinegar through derepression of Nadc1 and Cldn14. Consistent with this, systemic agomiRs could silence Nadc1 and Cldn14 expression, mimicking the effect of vinegar consumption in reducing renal CaOx crystals deposition. Significantly these mechanistic findings were confirmed in human kidney tissues, suggesting similar mechanistic relationships exist in humans among vinegar, Histone H3 acetylation, NADC1 and CLDN14 expression as well as expression of miR-130a-3p, miR148b-3p and miR-374b-5p.",

Since the AVS algorithm was introduced 4 years ago in our center, we aimed to review the applications in clinical practice. from PN to SAE was 12 days. The most common symptom of 31 (75.61%) patients was gross hematuria, followed by flank pain (3/41). Follow-up computed tomography of 7 asymptomatic patients revealed iatrogenic vascular complications.

Introduction and Objective: Bladder cancer (BC), generally urothelial carcinoma, is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. Patients with BC have poor outcomes due to lack of effective molecular targets for therapy. Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), which is involved in embryo formation and neurodevelopment, has been shown to be overexpressed in several human cancer types. Nevertheless, the role of ADNP in the progression of bladder cancer (BC) remains unknown. The present study aimed to identify ADNP as a novel mitochondrial target in BC cells, suggesting a potential role for AKT-MDM2-p53 signaling in human bladder cancer.",

To simplify this procedure, the authors investigated feasibility and safety of second look PCNL without anesthesia and sheath, after maturation of nephrostomy tract. Results: Seven patients had their records reviewed. Mean age was 54 years (range 36 -68 years). All were males. In final histopathology report, 6 were transitional cell and one was adenocarcinoma. Of them, three were T1G3, two were T2N0, one with T3aN1 and last was T3bN2. The intraumbilical incision for specimen retraction and extracorporeal ileal conduit creation was 9 cm. Mean estimated blood loss was 400ml (range 300-700ml). Mean duration of surgery was 6 hours (range 5-8 hours). All of the patients spent 36 hours in intensive care unit. Orally sips allowed on post-operative day (POD) 2 and complete orals by POD 4. Per urethral catheter drain was removed on POD 3. Mean time of abdominal drain removal was 8 days, although in 1 patient, it was kept for 15 days because of urine leak, which was managed conservatively. All patients were discharged on POD14, except one who had urinary leak and was discharged on POD 28. Wound infection occurred in one patient and was managed conservatively.

Urinary stasis within the diverticuli promotes stone formation resulting in renal colic or recurrent infections.

After thorough discussion regarding ureteroscopic and percutaneous approaches, he elected to proceed with the ureteroscopic approach. In the first procedure, it was noted that the distal ureter was tight, hence decision was made to proceed with staged pre-stenting. Subsequently, in the second procedure, there was difficulty identifying the ostium of the stone-bearing calyx. The ostium became apparent only after utilising the \"blue spritz\" technique -methylene blue was instilled into the collecting system via the flexible ureteroscope and then suctioned out; normal saline irrigation fluid was then introduced into the collecting system, with the residual blue dye seen escaping from the ostium of the stone-bearing calyx. A guidewire was then inserted into the calyx with subsequent laser infundibulotomy. The cluster of multiple calyceal calculi was visualised and extracted with a zero-tip basket.",

However, results have been conflicting, there are reports of high failure rates that may be due to ischaemia and fibrosis. Conversely, others have reported favourable results.

Each prostate was partitioned into 12 sectors for a total of 192 sectors evaluated. Micro-Ultrasound images were scored according to the Prostate Risk Identification using Micro-Ultrasound (PR-IMUS) and mpMRI images were scored according to PI-RADS v2. A score of up to or equal to 3 was considered to be suspicious for both scores. The index lesion, which was the biggest lesion visible, was identified and filed depending on the localization. Prostatectomy specimens were processed according to the Stanford protocol. Pre-operative and post-operative results regarding the identification of the index lesion were compared and sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and accuracy were calculated. Conclusion: Sonourethrography has a high accuracy in the determination of extent of spongiofibrosis which correlates excellently with intraoperative findings. It also has a higher sensitivity specificity, PPV and NPV in the determination of length of stricture than retrograde urethrography. Both tools are valuable in management of urethral stricture.",

Introduction and Objective: The use of oral mucosa grafts in urethral reconstruction involves transplantation of non-keratinized oral mucosa for the repair of a variety of urethral defects and in the last two decades, this has emerged as the most widely used substitute tissue in urethral reconstruction. The common sites of oral mucosa grafts for urethroplasty include the inner cheek (buccal), the lips (labial) and the anterolateral aspect of the tongue (lingual). However, harvesting of oral mucosal grafts has certain complications.

Hemostasis was achieved within 5 minutes and none of the cases required renorrhaphy/bolster/additional hemostatic manoeuvres. One patient required post-operative blood transfusion. The median length of stay was 6 days (range 4 -9). Only the case of reapplication of patch required selective polar angio-embolization. Follow up imaging did not pose any disparities. Our initial experience with Veriset TM is promising and its use in NSS is feasible and safe. Easy application, rapid onset of hemostasis and safe profile aids in reducing ischemia time, any need for additional hemostatic manoeuvres and reduces surgeon's anxiety. Nephrometry score had no impact on its application and no issues were noted on follow-up imaging. Crucial steps for best outcomes with Veriset TM were: water-tight PCS closure, adequate point suturing of bleeding vessels, trimming Veriset TM to appropriate shape of the renal cortical defect, avoiding removal and reapplication of the patch.",

Introduction and Objective: Urethral strictures are a common urological problem which could require complex reconstructive procedures. Urethral dilation is a frequent intervention associated with high recurrence rates. Drug-coated balloons with cytostatic drugs have been successfully used for the prevention of vascular restenosis after balloon dilation. These balloons could be used in the urethra to reduce the restenosis rates of urethral dilation. Nevertheless, the urothelium is different from the vascular endothelium and these drugs may not be distributed to the outer layers of the urethra. Therefore, we performed this experiment to evaluate the distribution of paclitaxel (PTX) in the rabbit urethra after the inflation of a PTX-coated balloon (PCB).",

The lower-left of figure shows the expression differences of E. coli biofilm lectins in DAU3 stress group has been developed for diagnostic methods because it could represent profile expression in the cell. Furthermore, RNA urinary isolation methods are important to be established in order to get reliable non-invasive biomarkers compared to tissue biopsy. In fact, the optimization method for isolation RNA from urine is not clear. So that, the optimization and stability storage study are needed to be used as a reference standard protocol. This study was performed to determine the optimization methods of RNA isolation from urine samples and RNA concentration stability storage for transcriptomic (non-coding RNA) analysis.",

On the other hand, there is little information on the relationship between other members and clinicopathological features in bladder cancer tissues. In this study, we paid attention to TSP-5 expression because it is associated with vascular homeostasis including blood coagulation. That is, we hypothesis that TSP-5 plays important roles for tumor growth and cell dissemination via securing blood supply of cancer-related microvessel in cancer tissues. The main aim of this study is clarifying this hypothesis in patients with bladder cancer. Materials and Methods: Expression of TSP-5 was evaluated in 206 patients, with 150 non-muscle, invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and with 56 MIBC patients. TSP-5 immunoreactivity, proliferation index (PI, measured by using anti-Ki67 antibody), and microvessel density (MVD, measured by using anti-CD34 antibody) were evaluated in formalin-fix specimens by immunohistochemical technique.

However, I believe that there is a possibility that TSP-5 is positively associated with malignant aggressiveness via securing blood supply and pathway for cancer cell dissemination in bladder cancer. Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan Introduction and Objective: CD169 + macrophages play a pivotal role in establishing anti-tumor immunity. In mice, they capture dead tumor cells in the draining lymph and activate tumor-antigen-specific CD8 + T cells, which is important for tumor suppression. It was reported that a greater frequency of CD169 macrophages is associated with a better cancer prognosis in cancer patients. The goal of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of CD169 + macrophages residing in the tumor-draining lymph nodes of bladder cancer. Materials and Methods: 64 bladder cancer patients who received radical cystectomy were retrospectively examined. The abundance of CD169 + macrophages in the regional lymph nodes and CD8 + T cells in the tumor were investigated by immunohistochemistry. The CD169 score was determined as the proportion of CD169 + macrophage among CD68 + cells in the lymph node.",

Introduction and Objective: Metastases to the urinary bladder are rare, accounting for up to 4.5% of all bladder neoplasms. These are often due to the direct extension from another pelvic neoplasm, such as cervical, prostate and colon cancer. Metastases from distant organs are exceptionally rare and have been described sporadically, the most common being stomach, lung and skin. We retrospectively studied the surgical and oncological management of patients with secondary neoplasms of the bladder. ). Twenty patients underwent surgical intervention (80%), whilst 1 patient received chemotherapy alone (4%) and 1 patient received radiotherapy alone (4%). Four patients received either a combination of surgery and chemotherapy (16%), 3 patients received Surgery and chemo-radiotherapy (12%), 1 patient received chemotherapy alone (4%) and 1 patient received radiotherapy alone (4%). Chemotherapy regimens varied but most commonly involved Oxaliplatin, Gemcitabine, and Carboplatin. Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumour (17 patients, 68%) and Radical Cystectomy (3 patients, 12%) were the most frequently performed surgical procedures amongst our patients, whilst 5 patients (20%) did not receive any surgical intervention. The median survival for our patients was Renal (1528 days), Ovarian (552 days), Prostate (555 days) Colorectal (518 days), Lymphoma (404 days), Breast (241 days), and Cervical (125 days).

A p<0.05 is considered significant. Male sling was successful in 73% of patients, of which 46% did not use any pads postoperatively. 27% of patients had ongoing residual leakage. The only significant predictors were number of pads, detrusor overactivity and bladder capacity; which were associated with poorer outcomes.",

In this paper, we performed a retrospective study and discussed the possible relationship between non-HDL-c to HDL-c ratio and TD in aging Chinese men with BPH.",

TD was defined as a serum value of TT less than 10.4 nmol/L (300 ng/dL). Conclusion: Nearly one-third of aging Chinese BPH patients we studied had TD. Clinicians should be aware of the high prevalence of low testosterone in these patients. Non-HDL-c to HDL-c ratio has a positive correlation with TD. It may be a good index that could well reflect the status of TD.

They experience more hygiene issues at baseline and are more likely to require skin graft during surgical treatment.

Many treatments have shown limited efficacy in this difficult to treat condition. However, botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) given by intravesical sub-mucosal injection has been used as an unlicensed treatment for IC/PBS. It has been suggested that BTX-A has an effect on afferent neurons in addition to its well-known effects on the neuromuscular junction thereby improving both the urinary symptoms and pain seen in IC/PBS. The aim is to review the published data relating to the efficacy of BTX-A used in IC/PBS with respect to pain and symptom relief and to assess whether the pattern of intravesical injection (bladder wall vs. trigonal injection) impacts outcomes. Analysis of the RCTs suggests BTX-A improves pain control as well other symptoms compared to either placebo or alternative treatments such as hydrodistension and pentosan polysulfate (PPS). One paper compared trigonal and non-trigonal injections and found no significant difference between the two groups but both improved symptoms compared to baseline. Analysis of cohort studies found that BTX-A improved pain and other symptoms when compared to patient's baseline readings.",

High peri-operative mortality is reflected in the most advanced cases despite extensive pre-operative work-up and planning.

No survival loss was seen in the IVR group, but patients with previous BCa have a higher rate of DSM. IVR in our unit can potentially be reduced by limiting the use of URS and introducing post-RNU bladder instillation.",

The patient was evaluated 5 months after surgery with an increasing abdominal mass at a laparoscopic port site. Abdominal and pelvic CT scan showed an 8 cm, solid lesion of the abdominal wall with heterogeneous density but no evidence of visceral metastasis. Surgical enucleation of the abdominal wall mass was performed with a safety margin of 2 cm. A primary closure of the peritoneum was performed, and the abdominal wall was reconstructed with a permanent mesh with a bioresorbable coating. Skin closure was achieved with an abdominoplasty-like approach. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of poorly differentiated tumor consistent with transitional cell carcinoma infiltrating the fibromuscular adipose tissue; the surgical margins were negative.

Comparison of Outcomes of TURP in Small Versus Large Prostates Iqbal N 1 , Khalid M 2 , Akhter S 1 1 Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute, Lahore, Pakistan; 2 Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, Pakistan Introduction and Objective: Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a condition in elderly men in which the prostate gland is enlarged. Trans Urethral Resection of prostate (TURP) has become a gold standard for treating bladder outlet obstruction due to prostate en-largement. In recent guidelines, it has been stressed that prostate should be preferred in prostate size less than 75 mL. It is suggested to opt for procedures such as laser enucleation and resection of prostate for large size prostate. However, such recent and advanced technologies are not easily available in third world countries. So, in poor countries such as Pakistan, either open prostatectomy is the choice or staged TURP is preferred in prostate size more than 100 grams. We aimed here to see single surgeon experiences in which TURP was done in prostate size more than 100 grams. We also compared outcomes between smaller and larger prostates TURP.",

Admissions via ED were associated with higher odds of having previous exposure of radiotherapy (13/44) compared to elective. Additionally, patients with history of radiotherapy were more likely to have multiple presentations to hospital for haematuria, with 5/14 (35.7%) of radiotherapy-exposed patients admitted 2 or more times within the study period. This is in contrast to 5/100 patients with no radiotherapy history. The average duration was also higher in patients with a history of radiotherapy exposure (6.7 vs 1.2 days, p= 0.05).",

All patients underwent dorsal inlay graft (DIG) urethroplasty using prepuce at the mean age of 21 years, and had no postoperative complications such as stricture, fistula and curvature at the mean follow-up of 13 months. In secondary repair group, their complaints were difficulty on urination related stricture in 11 patients, urinary and ejaculation disturbance related fistula in 2, glandular dehiscence in 1. In all 3 patients with fistula or glandular dehiscence, their complaints began during childhood. However, difficulty on urination related stricture was developed at the mean age of 41 years. Ten patients with stricture underwent 2-stage urethroplasty using buccal mucosa. DIG urethroplasty using redundant prepuce was performed in 1 patient with stricture and all 3 patients with fistula or glandular dehiscence. One patient had postoperative urinary tract infection, however, no patient had postoperative stricture, fistula or curvature at the mean follow-up of 15 months.",

A sleep diary and standardised template were used to collect sleep-wake pattern, blood results, visual analogue of pain score (VAS) and international index of erectile function (IIEF). Results: Nine patients were identified as PNE sufferers with a median age of 55 (IQR:46-57), all of whom had normal baseline IIEF and testosterone levels. PNE episodes occurred at least once per night in these patients, ranging from 5-30 minutes in duration. Treatments used included baclofen, etilefrine, clonazepam and corporal aspiration (table 1) .

However, predictive biomarkers of BPT have not been investigated. The aim of this study is to assess the predictive value of inflammation-based scores. Materials and Methods: Fifty-seven metastatic GCT patients were retrospectively evaluated. BPT was defined as the presence of asymptomatic decline in pulmonary function test, pulmonary symptoms, or interstitial pneumonia on computed tomography without infection. Patients were divided according to the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), albumin to globulin ratio (AGR), Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), Glasgow Prognostic Index (GPS) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was calculated to assess the predictive ability of each scoring systems. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the predictive scores associated with BPT. Results: Of the 57 patients, 15 patients developed BPT. The NLR had a highest AUC value (0.763) followed by PNI (0.749) in comparison with other inflammation-based scores. In the multivariate analysis, the NLR (odds ratio 11.5, p= 0.009) and PNI (odds ratio 9.07, p= 0.013) were independently associated with development of BPT. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the NLR and PNI are independent predictive markers of developing BPT and superior to the other inflammation-based predictive scores.

Eight years earlier he received an augmentation urethroplasty done with oral mucosa graft. On clinical evidence of a perineal abscess a surgical exploration was performed. Intraoperatively a periurethral abscess near a urethral lesion was seen. After successful wound conditioning, secondary wound closure was performed. Histologically, malignancy was excluded. Four months later, the patient presented again with a wound healing disorder. In MRI morphological abscess formation was seen. Again, we performed surgical therapy with successive wound conditioning. Histologically, a squamous cell carcinoma was described this time. Despite extensive resection, complete tumor removal could not be achieved. In x-ray imaging, metastasis was excluded. After consulting with the NCT (National Center For Tumor Diseases) in Heidelberg, Germany, platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been recommended prior to an eventually radical surgical treatment. Results: Squamous cell carcinoma of the urethra is an extremely rare disorder with a high malignant potential. Diagnostics and therapeutics require a high degree of professional competence and interdisciplinarity. Conclusion: Due to the poor prognosis of urethral carcinoma, early and targeted diagnosis is essential for the further course of the disease. In addition, curative therapy settings require early radical surgical therapy. Introduction and Objective: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most frequent cause of cancer-related death in men worldwide. It is a heterogeneous disease at molecular and clinical levels which makes its prognosis and treatment outcome hard to predict. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marks a key step in the invasion and malignant progression of PCa. We sought to assess the co-expression of epithelial cytokeratin 8 (CK8) and mesenchymal vimentin (Vim) in locally-advanced PCa as indicators of EMT and consequently predictors of the progression status of the disease.",

In fact, less than 13% of men over 73 yrs old with localized aggressive carcinoma and a life expectancy for at least 10 years, receive radical treatment, instead of younger men with a similar life expectancy. Consequently, these older patients are more likely to receive radiotherapy or androgen deprivation therapy, possibly because their urinary functional outcomes after radical prostatectomy were underestimated.",

Surgical procedures, techniques, and short-term follow-up outcomes were concluded. The surgical incision was made from 4 cm below the umbilicus to 5 cm above the pubis symphysis, where the laparoscopic port of 100 mm in diameter was inserted. 30-degree up lens was adopted, and no patient had undergone pelvic lymph node dissection, while 1 patient had undergone bilateral intrafascial preservation of neurovascular bundles (NVB). Results: Surgical procedures were successfully performed in the 5 patients, with no open conversion. Time of operation was 110 min (range, 85-150 min), console time was 82 min (range, 45-131 min). Estimated blood loss was 100 mL (range, 50-150 mL) with no blood transfusions.

Co-registration of MRI and real-time TRUS is essential to the success of MRI-targeted fusion biopsy (TB), however, uncertainty remains around its accuracy and subsequent tumour yield in larger prostates. We evaluated differences in rates of cancer detection using TB between small, medium and large-sized prostates. Conclusion: MRI-targeted fusion biopsy detects less CS disease in large compared with medium-sized prostates, however, there is no significant difference between medium and small-sized prostates. Reasons for this finding in large prostates could include poor co-registration on fusion biopsy, low incidence of PI-RADS 3-5 lesions, or high PSA confounding the decision to biopsy.",

Over 10-40 years, repeated episodes of Vitamin D deficiency induced innate immune dysfunction, could explain PC linkage with the sun-sensitive P.acnes. In light of the results found in this report, the technology used to produce bacterial vaccines to treat women with recurrent cystitis could offer new approaches to separate low verses high grade PC as could study of low dose check point inhibitors.",

The primary outcomes were recurrence and surgical complications. Secondary outcomes were patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMS) including SHIM questionnaire and global response assessment (GRA) questionnaire administered to measure functional and esthetic outcomes.

Introduction and Objective: Kulkarni Panurethroplasty with one side dissection technique is today practiced at many centers across the globe. The advantage of one side dissection is it preserves the neurovascular supply on the opposite side of urethra. It is minimally invasive urethroplasty. The urethra opens like a book and can be attached to exact same location as before unlike circumferential mobilization Materials and Methods: The Kulkarni Urethroplasty can be used in 3 different scenarios. It is best suited for a single stage, penile invagination, dorsal onlay, one sided dissection buccal graft urethroplasty for Panurethral strictures. This is especially true for lichen sclerosus where staged approach is fraught with recurrence. The penile invagination approach can be applied to penile strictures. Through a perineal incision, penis is invaginated, Urethra mobilized on one side, dorsal onlay urethroplasty done from meatus till entire length of stricture. This can be done without penile incision. In hypospadias fistula, simple fistula closure often fails as usually there is a distal stricture. Buccal graft augmentation with dorsal inlay has been practiced. With Kulkarni one side dissection, urethra can be mobilized dorsally, Fistula closed from inside, and augmented with a dorsal onlay buccal graft. A onlay graft is always bigger and has better attachment to underlying corpora.",

Yet only 5% of them considered previous experience with other types of laser prostatectomies necessary to safely embark on Thulium surgery. Ninety-six percent of surgeons had technical training by the company and 80% received training in congresses and workshops. Only 36% of them had mentor assistance in the first procedures. According to the self-assessment of competence by the surgeons, a mean number of 24 cases were necessary to reach a plateau in performance. Still, according to 12% of responding surgeons more than 50 procedures might be considered necessary to reach surgical expertise. Furthermore, 92% of survey responders considered their experience with Tm-YAG laser prostatectomy as positive and recommendable.",

We compared donor and recipient outcomes between laparoscopic left (LLDN) vs. right (LRDN) donor nephrectomy in a large volume transplant center in the Philippines. Materials and Methods: A chart review was done on all laparoscopic donor nephrectomies performed from January 2011 to December 2015. Donor demographics (age, gender, BMI) intraoperative [operative time (OT), length of hospital stay (LOS), estimated blood loss (EBL) and warm ischemia time (WIT)] and post-operative outcomes [mean creatinine rise, delayed graft function (DGF)], complications and one-year allograft survival were compared between the two groups. Results: A total of 441 donors, 397 (89%) LLDN and 44 (9%) LRDN were performed during the study period. The donor characteristics were similar for both groups. There was no significant difference in OT in LLDN (178 min [85-360]) vs. LRDN (176 min [119-257]); EBL in LLDN (100 mL [10-1600]) vs. LRDN (100 mL [20-250]); LOS in LLDN (3 days [2-8]) vs LRDN (3 days [2-4]); WIT in LLDN (4 min [1-32]) vs. LRDN (3 min [1-12]) and DGF in LLDN 9/397 (2.27%) and LRDN 2/44 (4.55%). There was no significant change in the mean donor and recipient creatinine up to one year. There was neither conversion to open nor mortality for both. The one-year allograft survival was also similar in LLDN 392/397 (98.7%) vs. LRDN 42/44 (95.4%). Conclusion: Regardless of laterality, when performed by experienced hands, laparoscopic donor nephrectomy leads to equivalent outcomes for both donor and recipients in terms of safety profile and excellent allograft function.

In contrast, bladder cancer survivorship is poorly addressed within contemporary research. This study aims to determine the unmet needs of bladder cancer survivorship patients via systematic review, then develop a bladder cancer survivorship assessment tool.and Methods: A systematic review relating to literature on survivorship for patients with bladder cancer was conducted. This was to identify survivorship needs in bladder cancer and also the components of a survivorship tool. The search strategy aimed to identify all references related to bladder cancer AND survivorship. Search terms used were as follows: (Bladder cancer) AND (unmet needs) AND survivorship. The following databases were screened from 1989 to September 2018: CINAHL, MEDLINE (NHS Evidence), Cochrane, AMed, EMBASE, PsychINFO, SCOPUS, Web of Science.Conclusion: From the systematic review, unmet needs were found in patient information, requirement for patient support groups. An active bladder cancer support group are required. Access to healthcare to management side effects of surgery, erectile dysfunction and fatigue, are also important. Survivorship clinics are needed as are community resources for education, and patient navigation are needed. Based on these results a bladder cancer survivorship tool is developed.Introduction and Objective: Traditional non-invasive testing in the form of urine cytology and imaging for urothelial bladder cancer has a low sensitivity. CxBladder is a new diagnostic test which takes into account urine genetic markers and patient phenotypic UP.033,Figure 1: Flow chart of studies identified through the systematic review (adapted from PRISMA) characteristics to calculate the risk of a patient having bladder cancer. We aimed to perform the first Australian assessment of the diagnostic performance of CxBladder for detection and surveillance of bladder cancer. and Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional analytic study design was employed. Patients undergoing cystoscopy for investigation of haematuria or surveillance for urothelial carcinoma between May 2018 and Oct 2018 were enrolled in our study. All patients being investigated for haematuria had three sets of urine cytology and upper tract imaging performed. Data were analysed using SPSS 24.0. : Seventy-five patients were enrolled in our study. The mean age was 67.5 with females comprising 30% of group. Indications were macroscopic haematuria (61%), microscopic haematuria (11%), and bladder cancer surveillance (28%). Histologically proven urothelial carcinoma was present in 12.2% of cases. Of these 2 cases could not have a CxBladder risk calculation due to the presence of high inflammatory markers within the urine. The remaining cases of urothelial carcinoma all had a positive CxBladder test. In comparison urine cytology demonstrated malignant cells in 22%, atypical cells in 33% and were normal in 45% of cases. CxBladder tests were negative in 47% of cases, with all cases being negative for urothelial carcinoma on cystoscopy. : Our study shows that CxBladder has a 100% high negative predictive value, demonstrating its utility as a \"rule out\" test. This has the opportunity to significantly decrease the number of unnecessary cystoscopies being performed for bladder cancer detection and surveillance.The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, ChinaIntroduction and Objective: Systemic inflammation was reportedly to be associated with the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). The aim of this study was to explore the association between preoperative albumin to globulin ratio (AGR), one of the key components of systemic inflammation, and the detection of CTCs. and Methods: Between October 2017 and May 2018, a homogeneous cohort of patients with primary non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients were enrolled in this prospective study. AGR was calculated as AGR = albumin/(total protein -albumin). The enumeration of CTCs was performed before the tumor resection using a size-dictated immunocapture chip. Patients were divided into two groups based on the CTC counts (detectable vs. undetectable). A comparison of clinicopathological factors and AGR value was performed between the two groups. There was no significant difference between the two groups, regarding age at the diagnose, gender, pathological tumor stage and grade(WHO 2004) and smoking history. : AGR is negatively associated with preoperative CTC counts and may be a predictor of CTC detection in NMIBC patients.Introduction and Objective: BCG is widely well recognised and advocated for high and intermediate risk group patients in almost all guidelines. Despite evidence suggestive of its use we found that BCG practice and protocols are widely varied with generation gap among the urologist for number of reasons.",

Median follow time was 8 months (range 1-55 months). Positive FISH result in patients who had completed intravesical chemotherapy was associated with tumor recurrence (p=0.035). Among patients with a positive FISH, 11/12 (91.2%) had biopsy-proven recurrence, with 63% of this subset demonstrating either disease progression or recurrent CIS. Final pathology in three patients who underwent radical cystectomy was recurrent high-grade T1 with CIS, recurrent high-grade T1 alone, and recurrent CIS.

Therefore, we performed the systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic performance of RS in the BCa in this study. and Methods: Comprehensive literature searches were performed in the PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane library databases up to De-cember 2018. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRIS-MA) guidelines, study has been included according to the PICOS (Participant, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes, Study design) approach. The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated according to questionnaires and criteria suggested by Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). : Four studies were included in this analysis though the screening of full-text of the remaining articles based on the inclusion and exclusion crite-statistic, 37.2%). The risk of bias in all included studies were low grade in all domain except patient selection. The applicability concerns were also were a low grade in almost except index test of two studies. : RS is an optical diagnostic technology that has great value in detecting malignant bladder lesions. At the same time, it has advantages of being non-invasive, real-time, and easy to use.

Patients were operated by the same surgeon at a tertiary private medical institute. After the initial TURBT with T1 stage tumor, independently of the grade, patients underwent a second TURBT 20 days later. Subsequently, irrespectively of the histology, patients were submitted to 6 weekly intravesical installations of BCG. A cystoscopy was carried out at 3 months and afterwards every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months for the next 4 years. 3 weekly revision installations of BCG were administered to all patients every 6 months after the initial treatment, for 36 months. : After 5 years of follow up, recurrence-free survival was achieved in 91% of the patients and progression-free survival in 95%. In 11/16 patients the bladder tumor recurred during the 1 st year of follow up.

While immunotherapy showed great potential in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) treatment, it is urgent to discover which subgroup MIBC patients could benefit most from immunotherapy. We here tried to explore the prognostic value of CD103+ CD8+ T cells and provide possible molecular explanations. and Methods: We selected 259 MIBC patients who underwent radical cystectomy from two independent clinical centers between 2002 and 2014. CD103+ CD8+ T Cells were evaluated via immunofluorescence of CD103 and CD8 performed in our constructed tissue microarrays. Prognostic value of CD103+ tissue-resident CD8+ T cells in MIBC was assessed within both training set and validation set. Immune microenvironment was also evaluated by measuring various tumor-infiltrating immune cells and immune-related cytokines. Fresh MIBC specimens were analyzed by flow cytometry to explore the anti-tumoral immune response and immune checkpoint expression of tissue-resident CD8+ T cell. : Patients with higher CD103+ CD8+ T cells infiltration had a significantly better overall survival in both training set and validation set. (HR= 0.243, P < 0.001 and HR= 0.324, P < 0.001). Further, Cox regression indicated that CD103+CD8+ T cells could exhibit its prognosis value independent of CD8+ T cells. Moreover, patients with higher CD103+ CD8+ T cells tended to have more CD8+ T cells, DCs and M1 macrophages infiltrated. Flow cytometry results revealed that CD103+ CD8+ T cells tended to express more IFN-g and granzyme B than CD103-CD8+ T cells (P < 0.001 and P= 0.007, respectively) (n= 10). We then analyzed several well-known immune checkpoint molecules in CD103+ CD8+ T cells. Surprisingly, PD-1, TIM-3 and Lag-3 were highly enriched in CD103+ CD8+ T cells. While there were no significant dif-ferences in CTLA-4 and TIGIT expression between CD103+ CD8+ T cells and CD103-CD8+ T cells. : High CD103+CD8+ T cells could predict better prognosis in MIBC patients. CD103+CD8+ T cells exhibit a distinct immune checkpoint molecules expression pattern. Patients with high abundance of CD103+CD8+ T cells represent a more potent anti-tumor immune response.Malthouse T, Lango A, Down C, Ahmed S Introduction and Objective: European guidance has recently changed and now differs from NICE -who steer us toward repeat resection in all with high-risk disease. European guidance does not include these patients if muscle is included and resection is (macroscopically) complete in the primary resection. NMIBC is expensive to treat. Re-look TURBT places a burden on operating room usage and adds further cost/risk of complications, however, offers more accurate diagnosis and treatment strategy. We aim to assess the role of re-look TURBT in our centre. and Methods: Single centre retrospective study of 112 re-look TURBTs, from 26/01/2015-31/12/2018. Tumours unresectable on primary TURBT were excluded.Results: Mean age was 72.1 years. Re-looks: 19/112 were G2 pTa, 46/112 were G3 pTa and 47 were G3 pT1. Median time to repeat resection was 7 weeks (4-37). 54.5% (61/112) of 1 st specimen included muscle, which rose to 87% on re-look. Grade of surgeon was not associated with inclusion of muscle in specimen. Residual tumour was found in 36.6% (41/112) of relooks; which includes 21% of G2 pTa, 30.2% of G3 pTa and 46.7% of G3 T1 tumours. Residual tumour was found in 32% of G3 Ta tumours that contained muscle in the primary specimen, and 28% in those without. For T1 tumours, those without muscle had a 44.4% chance of residual tumour compared with 48.1% for those that had muscle. Histopathological changes that worsened the prognosis (> vT1 or concomitant CIS) was found in 17%. 8% were up-staged to T2 (15.6% of T1 tumours; of the T1 tumours without muscle this rose to 27.8%). Only 1 patient with a Ta tumour was up-staged to T2. Grade was increased by 2.9%. Median time to BCG from initial TURBT was 105.5 days. Time to BCG was not associated with BCG failure (p= 0.0247).",

Oral 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) became available, and PDD with 5-ALA is expected to be widespread. However, a whole integrated transurethral resection (TUR) system was needed to introduce 5-ALA PDD. Aladuck\u00ae light source system (SBI Pharmaceuticals Co Ltd.), consisting of a fluorescent light (FL) source and a band-pass filter, makes possible to perform 5-ALA PDD using conventional TUR system. We evaluated the diagnostic value of 5-ALA PDD with Aladuck\u00ae system for detecting bladder cancer in flat lesions. TURBt) with Olympus saline TUR system, in combination with Aladuck\u00ae system, were performed. Two hours before TURBt, 5-ALA (20 mg/kg) was orally administered. The bladder samples were pathologically diagnosed and analyzed with cystoscopic findings by WL and FL.Results: A total of 19 patients, consisting of 18 male (19 cases) and a female, underwent TURBt, and, in total, 144 bladder samples (15 papillary lesions and 129 flat lesions) were analyzed. All the papillary lesions were confirmed malignant and were visible both by WL and FL. Thirteen samples (86.7%) were positive by FL. The flat lesions consisted of 35 malignant and 94 non-malignant lesions. The sensitivity was increased (68.6% by FL vs 40.0% by WL, p= 0.016). However, the specificity was decreased (77.7% by FL vs 93.6% by WL, p <0.01). The positive predictive value (53.3% by FL vs 70.0% by WL, p= 0.208) and the negative predictive value (86.9% by FL vs 80.7% by WL, p= 0.253) were not significantly different. All the samples from flat lesions, from patients who had had only low-grade pTa cancer, showed pseudo-positive by FL. No severe complication was observed with 5-ALA administration. : Oral 5-ALA PDD with Aladuck\u00ae system increases the sensitivity of bladder cancer in flat lesions, with less additional options.Nishimura K, Horii S, Okuda Y, Takeda K, Hatano K, Nakai Y, Nakayama M, Kakimoto KiOsaka International Cancer Institute, Osaka, JapanIntroduction and Objective: Urachal carcinoma is a rare disease and most patients with urachal carcinoma are diagnosed at advanced stages. However, standard care for advanced disease has not been established. We analyzed clinical outcomes of patients with urachal carcinoma in our institution. and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed our clinical database for urachal carcinoma from January 1970 to May 2018. Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparisons were made by a log-rank test.Results:We identified 25 patients, including 15 males and 10 females, with a median age of 50 years (range, 27-74 years). According to the Sheldon staging, 13 patients were staged as IIIA, 5 patients IIIC, 1 patient IIID, 1 patient IVA and 5 patients IV B. En-block segmental resection was performed in 20 patients, radical cystectomy in a patient and transurethral resection or biopsy alone in 4 patients. Twelve patients had disseminated disease at initial diagnosis and five patients developed dissemination during follow up. The common sites included peritoneum in 6 patients, lung in 5 patients, and liver in 4 patients. Thirteen patients received 5FU or CDDP containing systemic chemotherapy. Five patients underwent salvage local therapy including metastasectomy or radiofrequency ablation. Overall, 5-year disease-specific survival rate (5Y-DSS) was 57% with a median follow-up duration of 36 months (range, 2 to 267 months). 5Y-DSS of stage IIIC or higher (24%) was worse than that of stage IIIA (90%) (p= 0.0282). Among patients who received chemotherapy for disseminated disease, chemotherapy with salvage local therapy was associated with better survival than chemotherapy alone (p= 0.0232). : En-block segmental resection was a main surgical procedure for urachal carcinoma in our series. The disease was well-controlled for patients with Stage IIIA. In patients with disseminated disease, chemotherapy combined with salvage local therapy may have contributed to prolonging survival.Introduction and Objective: Post-operative Intravesical therapy (IVT) is strongly indicated for NMIBC (Ta and T1) and CIS urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Studies have shown that a single dose of intravesical chemotherapy within 24 hours post TURBT reduces the five-year recurrence rate by 11.7%. Examples of intravesical agents include mitomycin C, doxorubicin, epirubicin, valrubicin and gemcitabine. The European Association of Urology guidelines on NMIBC recommend the use of a single dose of intravesical chemotherapy post TURBT for low grade (Ta, T1 or CIS) cases. Despite these guidelines, the use of post-operative intravesical chemotherapy for NMIBC is variable. We aim to assess the rate of single dose intravesical chemotherapy use post TURBT for NMIBC around world. and Methods: We conducted a multi-centre retrospective audit over a pre-defined period. Participating centres from Australia, New Zealand, England, Ireland, Belgium, USA and Argentina were recruited. After ethics approval, data was collected and entered into a REDCaps database for analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of receiving intravesical chemotherapy. : A total of 432 patients undergoing TURBT for suspected low-risk NMIBC were included of which 180 (41.7%) were instilled with intravesical chemotherapy. The most commonly used agents were epirubicin (50.6%, n=91) and mitomycin C (47.8%, n=86). The majority of patient were instilled within 6 hours (58.3%, n=105) and this was done in the ward/ day procedure area (66.7%, n=120). On multivariable analysis, patients with four or more lesions were more likely to receive IVT compare to those with three and fewer tumours [OR 2.18, 95%CI 1.06-4.55]. Patients who had a probable low-grade lesion identified on flexible cystoscopy prior to TURBT were also more likely to receive IVT at TUBT compared to those that did not undergoing flexible cystoscopy beforehand [OR 1.91, 95%CI 1.02-3.64]. However, patients undergoing TURBT for recurrent tumours were less likely to receive IVT compared to those with primary lesions [OR 0.22, 95%CI 0.12-0.38].

The metastasis rate at diagnosis is about 15%. Typical metastases are bone, liver, brain and peritoneum. In contrast, only a few cases of vaginal metastases have been reported in the literature. and Methods: In October 2015, a 72-yearold woman presented with gross hematuria. A TURB with evidence of a urothelial carcinoma stage T1 G2 has been performed. The following resection remained without tumor detection. Two years later, she was again introduced to us for a vaginal tumor. A gynecological biopsy had already been performed, which suggested a metastasis of the known urothelial carcinoma. In the vaginal tumor excision performed by us a poorly differentiated, non-small cell urothelial carcinoma with transitional differentiation could be secured. It was followed by a radical cystectomy with Mainz pouch plant. Histological examination revealed a lymphogenic metastases of urothelial carcinoma stage T0 N1 (1/27) M1 (vag) L0 V0 Pn0 R0. Primary adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine / cisplatin has been switched to vinflunine after the first cycle due to intolerance. Currently the patient remains recurrence free. : This case shows the very rare appearance of a vaginal metastasis with inconspicuous bladder findings two years after TURB of a non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma. : Due to the poor prognosis, a radical surgical rehabilitation should always be sought.Can We Perform More Prostate-Sparing Cystectomy in Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Chinese Male Patients?

Interestingly, prostate volume is not a significant risk factor despite a larger size in the fail to void group (93 vs 76 grams, p = 0.118). History of diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease and cerebrovascular accident were not associated with success of trial without catheter (TWOC). Uroflowmetry performed showed that initial maximum flow rate (7.3 vs 7.2mls/second, p=0.939) and residual urine (130 vs 129mls, p = 0.974) in both groups were similar.

We investigate these issues from our experiences of upfront Docetaxel use with LH-RH antagonist for advanced hormone na\u00efve prostate cancer, aiming the prevention of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) for apoptosis tolerance. and Methods: Of 28 stage IV, new prostate cancer patients treated with upfront Docetaxel and LH-RH antagonist (Degarelix), 24 patients who could be followed more than 12 months (mean 29.8 months) were analyzed. Docetaxel was used two to three courses basically in usual dose two weeks after the induction of first Degarelix. Results: Of 24 patients, 11 patient's PSA did not decrease below 0.1 ng/mL within 6 months (group A) and gradually rose afterwards. PSA in another 13 patients (group B) decreased below 0.1 within 6 months and kept below 0.1 during the follow-up period. Although statistically not significant, the initial group A's PSA was higher than group B's (average 1,230 and 353 ng/mL), however, number of metastasis, Gleason sum, and bone metastatic extent of disease showed no difference between them. Some of the patients in group B showed only atrophic gland and fibrotic tissue at second prostate biopsy (specimens after more than two years of therapy) suggesting complete response. : Although the number of patients and follow up period were limited, our study suggested that PSA value at 6 months may predict the outcome of whole therapy. Patients showing PSA less than 0.1 ng/mL at 6 months may be induced to complete response. Upfront Docetaxel with LH-RH antagonist may prevent EMT for obtaining apoptosis tolerance, in case the patient does not have the castration-resistant clone at the beginning of the therapy (group B).PSA Density Performs Better in African American Men than Caucasian Men in Predicting Low Risk ProstateCancer at Radical Prostatectomy: Implications for Active Surveillance Introduction and Objective: PSA density (PSAD) <0.15 ng/mL/gm is one of the Epstein criteria for very low risk prostate cancer used to select patients for active surveillance (AS). However, this value was derived from historical cohorts of mostly Caucasian (CA) men. Therefore, it is unknown if this PSAD value is applicable to a modern cohort of African American (AA) and CA men. and Methods: With IRB approval, a retrospective chart review was performed of consecutive AA and CA men who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) between 2012 and 2017. Data collected included age, PSA, prostate volume (PV), pT Stage, pathologic Gleason Score (pGS), and percentage of the prostate involved with cancer (%PCa). The performance of PSAD to predict for low risk disease at RP was evaluated using ROC curve analysis and calculating the area under the curve (AUC). Sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for different PSAD cut off values. Low risk disease was defined as pT2 + pGS 6 + 5%PCa + PSA <10. Results: The entire cohort consisted of 212 patients, including 144 (67.9%) AA men. Only PSAD and pT Stage were significantly different between AA and CA (p= 0.029 and p= 0.043, respectively). PSAD was an excellent discriminator for low risk disease in the AA (AUC 0.912) cohort, but a poor discriminator in the CA (AUC 0.659) cohort. In AA men, a PSAD 0.12 ng/mL/gm had a Se, Sp, PPV, and NPV of 85%, 86%, 99%, and 22%, respectively. This PSAD value resulted in misclassifying 21 intermediate/high risk patients as having low risk disease and 1 (14%) low risk patient as having higher risk disease. In CA men, a PSAD 0.15 ng/mL/gm had a Se, Sp, PPV, and NPV of 60%, 60%, 95%, and 11%, respectively.",

Transperitoneal RALP was adopted with anterior access. Periprostatic anatomical structures, including the endopelvic fascia, puboprostatic ligaments, deep dorsal venous complex, detrusor apron, and bilateral neurovascular bundles were preserved. Anterior reconstruction was made after vesicourethral anastomosis to restore local anatomy. : Median PSA at time of diagnosis was 9.06 ng/mL (Interquartile range (IQR), 7.01-12.28). 82.8% patients were clinically organ-confined. Median time of surgery was 120 min (IQR, 85.0-180.0), with a median blood loss of 50 mL (IQR, 50.0-150.0).

Radical prostatectomy (RP) has gradually developed as an alternative treatment option for locally-advanced PCa in the past few years, especially with help of the da Vinci robotic surgical system, as part of a comprehensive treatment modality, but results are still scarce for node-positive PCa. Neoadjuvant ADT and adjuvant EBRT has been discussed in various clinical settings, showing promising tumor control outcomes. Neoadjuvant radiotherapy (RT) has become an important oncologic treatment strategy, the efficacy of which has been proven in various malignancies such as rectal cancer and sarcoma. However, few studies explored the role of neoadjuvant RT in prostate cancer. Here we present a prospective phase I clinical trial for node-positive patientswho had undergone neoadjuvant EBRT+ADT followed by RP. and Methods: We have designed a prospective, single-center, single-arm, open-label phase I trial. Eligible patients have biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer with pelvic lymph node invasion, regardless of serum PSA level and Gleason score.",

            "text": "and Objective: Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists are the most frequently used drugs for the delivery of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in prostate cancer (PCa). Achieving and maintaining effective testosterone (T) suppression to level attained with surgical castration is the cornerstone of ADT therapy for PCa. Increasing evidence suggests achieving and sustaining very low T levels to <20 ng/dL is desirable and correlates with improved disease-specific survival in patients with advanced PCa. T breakthroughs may occur between injections, especially if a dose is delayed. Late dosing, inadequate T suppression, or disease progression to advanced PCa may also cause a rise in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. This current study evaluated timeliness of LHRH injections, rate of T breakthroughs, and frequency of T/PSA testing prior to dosing in PCa patients.Results: For all LHRH agonist injections, 26.9% were late: 14.4% were 1 week late, 3.1% were between 1-2 weeks late, and 9.4% were >2 weeks late. 43% of T values exceeded 20 ng/dL for late injections; while only 22% exceeded this level for early/on-time injections. 83% of LHRH injections had a PSA value drawn prior to dosing; however, only 13% had a similarly timed T assessment. : Across LHRH agonists, greater than a quarter of injections were late. When dosing was late, the proportion of T >20 ng/dL increased while early/on-time dosing decreased the chance of T breakthrough. Late dosing was correlated with ineffective castration over 40% of the time, yet T values were not routinely assessed in many patients. Considering the clinical benefits of maintaining effective T suppression throughout the course of ADT, clinicians should administer treatments within approved dosing instructions, routinely monitor T levels, and consider prescribing treatments with proven efficacy through dosing interval to maintain T at castrate levels.Whole-Body MRI-Based Multivariate Prediction Model in the Assessment of Bone Involvement in Prostate CancerChen R, Yang Q, Yang Y, Fei J, Gao X, Sun Y, Lu J Introduction and Objective: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of whole-body T1, short tau inversion recovery (STIR), high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and sequence combinations to detect bone involvement in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. and Methods: A total of 545 cases of patients with histologically confirmed PCa at high risk (PSA> 20 ng/mL; or PSA> 10 ng/mL with Gleason score >3+4; Gleason score >4+3, any PSA) for metastasis were referred to whole-body MRI in Shanghai Changhai Hospital from July 2014 to December 2017. Whole-body coronal T1WI, and RESOLVE (readout segmentation of long variable echo-trains) DWI with b value 0-800; pelvic coronal T1WI, fat suppression T2WI; and prostatic DWI with b value 0-1500 were performed in all cases. Bone scan was carried out in all patients. The diagnosis of either metastatic of non-metastatic depends of the \"best valuable com-parator\" with both baseline and 6-month follow-up of imaging and clinical data. Two radiologists review and interpret individual and all sequences to detect bone involvement with a final diagnosis made after discussion in terms of discrepancy. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was applied. and Objective: Prostate specific membrane antigen ligands in PET imaging have shown superior results when compared to traditional imaging techniques in imaging prostate cancer. Simultaneous PSMA PET/MR is an emerging modality yielding promising results, although scant published evidence available. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of multiparametric MRI, PSMA PET/MR and PSMA PET/CT to whole-mount histopathology for the localization of primary prostate cancer. and Methods: A local prospective database (REDCap -Monash University) for patients who underwent MRI since 2013 was used. 18 patients underwent MRI, PSMA PET/CT, PSMA PET/MR and subsequent radical prostatectomy with whole-mount histopathology. Imaging was reported based on Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Sector Maps. These were individually evaluated and results analysed by dividing the prostate into 12 sectors; apex/ mid/base in the transverse plane, left/right in the sagittal plane, and anterior/posterior in the coronal plane. : Whole-mount histopathology revealed significant cancer in all 18 patients, with detection of tumour foci in 85 of 216 sectors, with significant cancer defined as greater than or equal to Gleason 3+4=7 (ISUP Grade Group 2). MRI detected lesions in 49 sectors (43 involving tumour foci) and no lesion in 167 sectors (42 involving tumour foci). PET/ CT demonstrated avidity in 50 sectors (38 involving tumour foci) and no avidity in 166 sectors (47 involving tumour foci). PET/MR demonstrated avidity in 56 sectors (48 involving tumour foci) and no avidity in 160 sectors (37 involving tumour foci). The overall accuracy of all 3 modalities respectively were 77.8%%, 72.7% and 79.2%. and Objective: Currently, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is not an indication for patients with very low-risk prostate cancer. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the usefulness of mpMRI as a diagnostic tool in these patients. and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and pathological data of individuals with very low-risk prostate cancer, according to the NCCN guidelines, who underwent mpMRI before radical prostatectomy at our institution between 2010 and 2016. Patients who did not undergo pre-evaluation with mpMRI were excluded. We analyzed the factors associated with biochemical recurrence (BCR) using Cox regression model, logistic regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier curve. : Of 253 very low-risk prostate cancer patients we observed 26 (10.3%) with BCR during the follow-up period in this study. The multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated that the only factor associated with BCR in very low-risk patients was increased in the pathologic Gleason score (GS) (HR: 2.185, p-value 0.048). In addition, multivariate logistic analyses identified prostate specific antigen (PSA) (OR: 1.353, p-value 0.010), PSA density (OR: 1.160, p-value 0.013), and suspicious lesion on mpMRI (OR: 1.995, p-value 0.019) as the independent preoperative predictors associated with the pathologic GS upgrade. : In our study, the pathologic GS upgrade after radical prostatectomy in very low-risk prostate cancer patients demonstrated a negative impact on the oncologic outcome; and mpMRI is a good diagnostic tool to predict the pathologic GS upgrade. We believe that the implementation of mpMRI would be beneficial to determine the treatment strategy for these patients.Direct and Marginal Cost Analysis of Not Aiming for the Target in a MRI-Targeted Prostate Biopsy PathwayIntroduction and Objective: The diagnostic yield of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in non-targeted biopsies in men with a suspicious mp-MRI is 1-3%. The aim of this multi-centre study was to evaluate non-targeted prostate biopsies when performed alongside MRI-targeted biopsies, in terms of direct cost and marginal analysis (MA), pathologist reporting and MDT reviewing time. and Methods: A prospective online registry was analysed (April/2017-Sept/2018). MA defined as cost to diagnose one additional case of csPCa. NHS reference cost \u2264119/biopsy. Pathologist reporting (8min/biopsy) and MDT reviewing time (1 min/biopsy). Biopsy advised if MRI score was 4-5 or score 3 with PSA-density >/=0.12. All TP-Bx with csPCA defined as any Gleason >/=3+4. ) ng/ml and 49cc. TP-Bx performed in 436 patients, csPCa identified in 48.7% (210/436). csPCa was exclusively present in non-targeted prostate biopsies in 2.1% (7/337). Direct costs of non-targeted negative or insignificant PCa were \u226439,270; 2,640 mins pathologist reporting; 330 mins MDT reviewing time. MA reported average cost per targeted and non-targeted case as \u2264255.59 and \u2264438.03. Marginal cost per case was \u2264240 for targeted and \u22645,729 for exclusively non-targeted biopsy csPCa. : Non-targeted biopsies in MRI-targeted pathway have significant direct and marginal costs per case, consume valuable pathologist time but confer diminishing marginal benefit.Introduction and Objective: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and microvessel density (MVD) play an essential role for tumor progression in prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, we evaluated the association of TAMs and the infiltration with tumor angiogenesis and the response to androgen deprivation therapies (ADT) in PCa to evaluate TAM infiltration as a predictive factor for PCa survival. and Methods: Fifty-four prostate cancer specimens were collected and stained with CD 68 antibody to investigated TAM infiltration in tumor. Von Willebrand factor (vWF) was stained to evaluate microvessel density (MVD) around the cancer foci.

We analyzed patients' survival rate through 5 years after diagnosis. Results: The median serum PSA was 50.7 ng/mL, and the median TAM infiltration was 28 (6-76). Increasing TAM infiltration correlated with increasing tumor angiogenesis (P<0.001, r= 0.61) and the response to ADT was significantly better in patients with fewer TAMs (< 28) compared to higher numbers of TAMs (>28) (P=0.003). TAM number was significantly higher in those with higher serum PSA, higher Gleason score, clinical T stage and metastasis. Multivariate analysis showed that Gleason score, ADT type and MVD number were prognostic factors for response to ADT P<0.05).

Patient medical records, histology, pathology, and radiology were reviewed. : Over a period of 24 months, 170 patients underwent MP-MRI followed by either TRUS-biopsy or TP-biopsy. 89 patients were excluded because they did not have a formal PIRADS scoring. 3 patients were excluded as their mp-MRI showed a PIRADS 2 lesion only. The total number of included patients was n=78. 23 patients had TP-biopsy of which 52% (n=12) patients had clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason3+4). 39.4% (n=9) patients had benign histology and 8.6% (n=2) patients had clinically insignificant cancer (Gleason 3+3, or less). 56 patients had TRUS-biopsy. 67.8% (n=38) patients had clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason3+4). 26.7% (n=15) patients had benign histology and 5.3 (n=3) patients had clinically insignificant cancer (Gleason 3+3, or less). : Our results show a slightly better diagnostic yield of TRUS-biopsy vs TP-biopsy with pre-biopsy MP-MRI, 67.8% (TRUS) vs 52% (TP-biopsy). Benign histology yield was surprisingly higher in the TP-biopsy cohort 39.4% vs TRUS-biopsy cohort 26.7%. Clinically insignificant cancer detection rates were similar in both cohorts. TP-biopsy, however, is associated with fewer complications as compared to TRUS-biopsy. There is no statistical difference in terms of diagnostic yield between the two prostate biopsy methods as evident in the literature.Introduction and Objective:It has been reported that alcohol intake reduces the PSA level in subjects. However, we are sometimes aware that drinking alcohol may be involved in PSA elevation in patients who have visited urologic outpatient office during following up PSA. We retrospectively investigated the relationship between PSA level and drinking in individual case. and Methods: From August 2012 to October 2018, we measured the rate of climb of the PSA due to drinking about 57 cases (net 32 cases) that the presence or absence of episode of drinking was confirmed before and after PSA measurement during PSA following. About the change of the PSA after the abstinence from alcohol, we set a PSA level after the abstinence as 100% and calculated the rate that had risen before the abstinence. : Prostate needle biopsy was performed in 12 patients. Prostate cancer was not observed, and inflammation was noted in 6 cases. There were 53 cases (93%) whose PSA rose due to drinking alcohol. Four patients (7%) had PSA falling due to drinking alcohol. Ninety-eight % of patients who had tenderness at the prostate admitted PSA rise with drinking alcohol. In 8 cases (14%), PSA exceeded the reference value (> 4.0 ng/mL) due to alcohol consumption. The median rate of PSA increase by drinking was 21.8% (-49.1% to 154.8%), and the average value was 32.1%. The PSA increase rate was not correlated with age, PSA at first visit, prostate volume at first visit, or PSAD. : Drinking may elevate PSA at a level of about 30% especially in the patients who indicate tenderness at prostate by digital rectal examination. There is a possibility that PSA falls below the reference value due to abstinence in such cases. Prospective study should be recommended in the future. and Objective: Prostate cancer is the most frequent neoplasia in men over 50 years old, being a public health problem. Transurethral resection is not a standard treatment option in prostate cancer; however, mono-or bipolar could be useful in advanced prostate cancer in order to improve the symptoms, especially the obstructive ones. and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 30 patients with prostate cancer who underwent bipolar transurethral resection and vaporization of the prostate. The indications are represented by incomplete or complete urinary obstruction (24 cases), recurrent urinary tract infections 4 cases, hematuria (2 cases). The mean age of patients was 73.8 (range 61-87). Prostate volume ranged from 38 to 103 cc with a mean value of 56.2 cc. The mean IPSS score was 18.7 (9-33). Mean Qmax was 7.32 (2-15) with a residual volume of 180.8 (20-650 mL). Six patients were admitted for complete urinary retention. The main characteristics of the patients are shown in the table: in all cases hormonal therapy and/or radiotherapy were applied with at least 3 months before the procedure. : The mean operative time was 72 minutes (between 24 and 112 minutes). The mean hemoglobin drop was 0.7 g/dL. Capsule perforation was noted in 2 cases. Postoperative bleeding occurred in one case. The mean catheterization time was 48.5 hours (24 to 120 hours) and the hospital stay was 42.5 hours (26 to 145 hours). IPSS decreased from 18.7 to 9.3 and the residual urine from 180.8 to 48.5 mL. The Q max increased to 18.2 mL/min. The postoperative PSA value (at 3 months after the procedure) was significant low by comparison with the preoperative value (12.5 ng/ dL vs 24.3 ng/dL). : Transurethral resection is a useful tool in the management of urinary symptoms in patients UP.403,Figure 1.

Suspicion of or active PCa was excluded by transrectal ultrasound, digital rectal examination and PSA before treatment/observation initiation. Examinations were repeated between 1-4 times/year. Biopsies were performed when indicated according to EAU Guidelines. : In the T-group, 12 men (2.8%) were diagnosed with PCa. In CTRL, 42 (10.9%) were diagnosed with PCa. The mean baseline-age of PCa patients was 64.9years in the T-group and 64 in CTRL.In the T-group, the average time span between the day of first injection and positive biopsy was 14.2months (range: 5-18).

Currently more than half of the diagnoses correspond to Gleason >7. This could be driven by an increased usage of PSA, additional biomarkers and new imaging modalities. and Objective: As the PSA-based screening for prostate cancer has been widespread, early detection of prostate cancer has been achieved on one hand, while the harms of frequent false-positive results with grey-zone PSA (serum PSA concentration less than 10 ng/mL) and complication rates from biopsy are not overlooked especially in men aged 70 years and older.

Of these, 144 patients (22.2%) with age 70 years and older with grey-zone PSA were included in the study. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the predictive factors for prostate cancer detection. were identified as independent predictors of prostate cancer. Thirty-six patients possessing both of these two risk factors could be identified as very highrisk of pathological prostate cancer by succeeding biopsy (OR 10.15, 95% CI: 3.50 -29.44, p <0.0001). Indeed, 28 patients (77.8%) were positive biopsy results. : Even at the era of MRI/US fusion biopsy, especially for the cases with equivocal MRI findings, serum total testosterone as well as PSAD may be useful predictors whether to proceed to biopsy in men aged 70 years and older with grey-zone PSA. Further cautious validation should be required to confirm our findings. Bone Mineral Density Testing in Men Initiating Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer Hu J, Aprikian A, Vanhuyse M, Nazha S, Dragomir A McGill University, Montreal, Canada Introduction and Objective: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a staple of advanced prostate cancer (PCa) treatment, however several side-effects are associated with its long-term use. Notably, loss of bone mineral density (BMD) is accelerated which increases fracture risk. Guidelines recommend BMD testing when initiating ADT to properly assess baseline fracture risk. The objective was to examine the proportion of BMD testing in men initiating ADT in Quebec, Canada. and Methods: The cohort consists of men extracted from Quebec public healthcare insurance administrative databases diagnosed with PCa from 2001-2012 and treated by ADT. Only patients who received at least one year of continuous ADT treatment were included. The primary study outcome was the receipt of baseline BMD testing (defined as a BMD test identified from medical claims in the period from 6 months prior to and up to 12 months after ADT initiation). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify variables associated with baseline BMD testing. : We identified 7,069 patients, of which 887 (12.6%) underwent baseline BMD testing. Rates of baseline BMD testing varied by year of ADT initiation, from 7.7% in 2001-2003 to 13.3% in 2007-2009 and to 12.3% in 2013-2012. Following multivariable analyses, prior history of osteoporosis (odds ratio[OR] 2.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.03-3.44; p <0.001), prior use of bisphosphonates (OR 1.79; 95%CI 1.47-2.19; p <0.001) were associated with higher odds of baseline BMD testing.

However, there are currently no randomized head-to-head comparisons of both agents. The objective was to compare the effectiveness of ABI and ENZA as second-line treatments in the post-chemotherapy setting in patients with mCRPC. and Methods: A retrospective population-based cohort was extracted from Quebec public healthcare administrative databases. Patients were selected on the basis of having sequentially received androgen deprivation therapy and chemotherapy prior to initiating a novel hormonal agent (ABI or ENZA) between 2012 and 2016. The index date corresponded to the date of the first prescription of ABI or ENZA. The primary outcome of interest was overall survival and evaluated with Kaplan Meier analysis and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. : The cohort is comprised of 621 patients, with 542 in the ABI group and 79 in the ENZA group. Median age at initiation was similar (ABI:73, ENZA:74; p= 0.449). There were more patients in the ABI group with a time from last chemotherapy to index date < 6 months (ABI:72.5%, ENZA:57.0%, p= 0.005). Median duration of treatment was similar in both groups at 6 months (IQR: 3-12) (p= 0.317). Median overall survival was 15.4 months in the ABI group and 17.9 months in the ENZA group (log-rank p= 0.822).

It's rise in value above the normal reference of 4 ng/mL is an indication for prostate biopsy in order to confirm or exclude prostate cancer. In positive biopsies the grade of malignancy is assessed according to Gleason which usually is graded from 3 to 5 and whose presence in the tissue is marked as a sum of the most dominant tissue differentiations. Gleason values of 3+3 and 3+4 are regarded as low degrees of prostate cancer malignancy. and Methods: A representative sample of around 100 biopsies from the main author's workplace during several months' period was taken into account. Analyzed were 18 biopsy results which were positive for prostate cancer and whose PSA ranged from 4 to 20 ng/mL. Data was easily collected from computerised databases and patient histories.Results: Out of 18 reports of prostate biopsies, positive for prostate cancer with PSA values under 20 ng/ mL, in 16 of them the Gleason score was 3+3=6 and in 2 it was 3+4=7. No cancers with dominant Gleason values of 4 or 5 were found. : Results from the derived data indicate that prostate biopsies positive for cancer whose PSA values are not greater than 20 show a low grade of malignancy or rather Gleason values with total sums of 6 or 7 whose dominant differentiation value is 3. So, a conclusion can be formed that with PSA elevation of up to 20 there is no significant danger of higher grades of malignancy of prostate cancer and an advanced stage of the disease which can serve as a determinant for timing of biopsy, whether at the soonest or deferred Imada K, Kashiwagi E, Monji K, Takeuchi A, Shiota M, Inokuchi J, Tatsugami K, Eto M",

Detected the expression of PSA gene in LNCaP and C4-2 cells overexpressed by YAP1 via luciferase reporter gene method. 3. The effect of overexpression YAP1 on PSA in different prostate cancer cell lines was detected by Western blot method, observing the effect of YAP1 silence on PSA protein in C4-2 cells. 4. The Q-PCR method was used to further verify the overexpression of YAP1 in C4-2 and the change of PSA mRNA expression. 5. Meanwhile, cellular immunofluorescence and WB were used to explore the effect of YAP1 on AR in C4-2 cells. : YAP1 is mainly expressed in nucleus and PSA is mainly expressed in cytoplasm in human prostate tissues. In CRPC, PSA can be regulated by YAP1. After overexpression of YAP1, AR in nucleus of C4-2 cells is significantly increased, suggesting that YAP1 has the ability to assist AR to enter the nucleus. : YAP1 can positively regulate the expression of PSA in CRPC and help AR enter the nucleus.Army Military Medical University, Chongqing, ChinaIntroduction and Objective: Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is a lethal subtype of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and associated with aggressive clinical features and poor overall survival. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that NEPC might evolve from prostate adenocarcinoma (Adeno), especially under the pressure from treatment. The underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies remain to be further defined. and Methods: By using a transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mouse model, in vitro macrophage migration assays, and patient samples, we investigated the effect of metformin on the neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of prostate cancer, as well as tumor-associated inflammation during the progression of prostate cancer and after androgen deprivation therapy.",

We retrospectively evaluated the prognosis of 163 patients of M1b. We excluded 33 patients with visceral metastasis. Among 130 patients, 38 were diagnosed as M1b+NRLN. We compared the progression free survival (PFS), cause specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) by Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test between M1b and M1b+NRLN. PSA response rate for second generation androgen-receptor target agents (ART) and docetaxel (DOC) treatment for castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) were evaluated between M1b and M1b+NRLN metastasis.Results: Mean patient age was 73 and 72 years in the M1b and M1b+NRLN metastasis, respectively. The cause specific survival (CSS) were significantly lower in M1b +NRLN patients than M1b (33.8 vs. 52.8 months, p=0.0351, respectively). Overall survival was 33.4 months in M1b+NRLN and 47.7 months in M1b patients (p=0.109). Time to PSA progression were significantly short in M1b+NRLN (10.5 months) compared to M1b (21.6 months) (p=0.0051). One-hundred and thirteen patients progressed to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Twentythree patients were administrated DOC and 33 patients administrated ART. PSA response rate for DOC were 77.7% and 72.7%, and for ART were 72.7% and 64.7% in M1b and M1b + NRLN metastasis, respectively. : PCa patients with M1b + NRLN metastasis showed poor prognosis than M1b patients, however, DOC and ART were both effective for M1b + NRLM metastasis patients. Earlier treatment with DOC or ART might prolong OS in M1b+NRLM patients. and Objective: Emerging data comparing PSMA-PET to multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) suggests combining the modalities provides superior sensitivity at detecting clinically significant PCa than either modality alone. The primary objective of PEPCAM is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-DCFPyL PET to detect PCa in men with a high clinical index of suspicion based on PSA and mpMRI, and prior targeted negative biopsy. and Methods: PEPCAM is a prospective non-randomised single centre trial which started recruitment in May 2018, with a target of 30 participants. Inclusion criteria include a high clinical suspicion for PCa, positive mpMRI and 1 negative prostate biopsy with cognitive or software fusion. If the 18F-DCFPyL PET lesion is concordant with the mpMRI lesion, the patient undergoes transrectal MRI in-bore biopsy with 3-5 cores taken (Arm 1). If the 18F-DCFPyL PET lesion is discordant with mpMRI, the patient undergoes transperineal saturation biopsy of the PET lesion with 3-5 cores taken (Arm 2). If the 18F-DCFPyL PET is negative, the patient has a transperineal mapping biopsy in 12 months (Arm 3). : Eight men have enrolled. Three have had negative 18F-DCFPyL PET and assigned to Arm 3. Two have had discordant lesions and assigned Arm 2, with saturation biopsies of the 18F-DCFPyL lesions pending. Three patients have had concordant lesions and assigned Arm 1, with MRI in-bore biopsies performed. One of these demonstrated ISUP Grade Group 1 PCa on histopathology, the other two were negative. : Despite 2 of 3 men with positive 18F-DCFPyL having negative MRI in-bore biopsies, PEPCAM remains a promising prospective trial looking at the ability of PSMA-PET to discern primary prostate lesions alone and when compared with mp-MRI.Introduction and Objective:To evaluate the Objective Response rate (ORR) efficacy of Temsirolimus in patients with advanced hormone-and chemothera-py-resistant prostate cancer.

There was histological concordance with the MRI reported positive quadrant in 227/237 (96%). In 41/237 (17%) the positive biopsies were confined to the quadrant containing the lesion (single focal quadrant). 101/237(43%) also had disease in 3 or all 4 quadrants (true multifocal disease). In 33/237 (14%) the target biopsy was negative, but systematic biopsy revealed disease in the same quadrant and adjacent quadrant/s. A further group of 10 patients (4%), had a negative target biopsy, but cancer was found in an adjacent and/or opposite quadrant; of these, 2/10 had clinically significant disease. 93 patients proceeded to RARP. The majority were for PIRADS 4 Introduction and Objective: To evaluate the correlations of post-implant regional dosimetrics at 24 hours (24 h) and 1month after implant procedures, with clinical outcomes of low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer. and Methods: Between January 2008 and December 2014, 130 consecutive patients treated for localized prostate cancer, receiving definitive iodine-125 (125I) brachytherapy treatment were retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent post-implant CT imaging for dosimetric analysis at 24 h and 1 month after implantation procedure. Prostate contours were divided into quadrants: anterior-superior (ASQ), posterior-superior (PSQ), anterior-inferior (AIQ), and posterior-inferior (PIQ). Predictive factors and cut-off values of biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS) and toxicities of LDR brachytherapy were analyzed. : The median follow-up time was 69.5 months. Seven patients (5.4%) had biochemical failure. The 3-year and 5-year BFFS rates were 96.7% and 93.1%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, prostate-specific antigen and Gleason score were significant prognostic factors for biochemical failure. D90 (the minimal dose received by 90% of the volume) of PSQ and PIQ at 24 h, and D90 of PSQ at 1 month were also significant factors. The cut-off values of PSQ D90 were 145 Gy at 24 h and 160 Gy at 1 month. D90 of the whole prostate was not significant at 24 h and at 1 month. D90 of PSQ at 1 month was a significant factor for rectal hemorrhage. : Post-implant D90 of PSQ is significantly associated with BFFS for localized prostate cancer not only at 1 month, but also at 24 hours. D90 of PSQ at 1 month is also a significant factor for rectal hemorrhage. and Objective: Therapeutic targeting of receptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), such as eGFR or HER2/neu, has been proven successful for clinical application to cancer. However, there are fewer reports about PTKs for prostate cancer than for other carcinomas. Elevated expression of the EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase, a 130-kDa transmembrane protein, is associated with poor prognosis of certain cancers when the enzyme is dephosphorylated by LMW-PTP. Here, we investigated whether EphA2 is useful as a predictive factor for biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. We also determined whether EphA2 is significantly correlated with LMW-PTP, E-cadherin, and Ki-67 in prostate cancer patients. and Methods: The subjects were 241 patients who underwent a total prostatectomy, at our hospital, between 2007 and 2011. EphA2 expression was categorized as high-expression or low-expression by two pathologists. We examined the relationship between EphA2 expression levels and clinicopathological factors including biochemical recurrence. We conducted Spearman rank correlation tests between EphA2 and LMW-PTP, E-cadherin, and Ki-67. : 121 patients (50.2%) were placed in the EphA2 high expression group; 120 patients (49.8%) were placed in the low expression group. A log-rank test revealed early biochemical recurrence in the high EphA2 expression group (p= 0.0001). Gleason score (p= 0.022), Ki-67 labeling index (p= 0.0002), and biochemical recurrence (p <0.0001) were more frequently identified in the EphA2 high expression group. Furthermore, multivariate analyses revealed that high EphA2 expression level was an independent prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence (HR= 3.62, 95% CI= 2.39-5.61, p <0.0001). In addition, the correlations between EphA2 and both LMW-PTP and Ki-67 labeling index were positive (Spearman's ranked correlation coefficients: 0.521 and 0.483, respectively, p <0.0001 in both cases). On the other hand, EphA2 and E-cadherin were negatively correlated (Spearman's ranked correlation coefficient: -0.585, p <0.0001). : EphA2 overexpression is predictive of aggressive prostate cancer behavior. EphA2 may be a powerful prognostic biomarker for decision-making in postoperative follow-up after total prostatectomy, and with regard to the need for relief treatment. It may be an important therapeutic target.",

The test can be used to provide a more definitive assessment of erectile dysfunction. and Objective: Prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis has been evolving over the years with increased experience and accumulated evidence. Recent changes in international guidelines reflected the efficacy of MRI in guiding targeted prostate biopsy. However, MRI as a stand-alone diagnostic test remains controversy. We conducted this review to investigate if mpMRI has good negative predictive value and may be used as a triage test to avoid unnecessary biopsies. and Methods: Retrospective review and analysis were conducted from a prospective database of patients who underwent transperineal prostate (TP) biopsy with pre-biopsy MRI between July 2018 and December 2018 at Eastern Health. Ninety patients (94.1%) underwent pre-biopsy MRI. The overall prostate cancer prevalence was 56% for the MRI cohort. In these 90 patients, 39 (43%) had negative mpMRI (benign, PI-RADS 1 or 2 lesions). Their median PSA was 6.3 ng/mL (5-7.2 ng/mL). Fifteen out of 39 (38.5%) patients had non-benign biopsy (median PSA = 6.7), 6 of which (15.4%) had Gleason 4 or 5 patterns. Fifteen patients had PI-RADS 3 lesions on mpMRI. Nine of them (60%) had positive biopsy and 7 (46%) had moderate to high risk disease. In 22 patients with PI-RADS 4 lesions, 10 patients (45.5%) had moderate to high risk disease, whereas 7 patients (31.8%) had negative biopsy. In the 12 patients with PI-RADS 5 lesions, all biopsies were positive and 9/12 (75%) had moderate to high risk prostate cancer. Positive predictive value of high PI-RADS lesion on mpMRI in this study group was 79.4%. For overall prostate cancer, with a definition of positive MRI being >=PI-RADS 3, the NPV in our series is 61.5% and the PPV is 73.5%. For csPCa, the NPV of MRI is 84.6% and PPV of 53.1%Conclusion: MpMRI appears to have good PPV especially with high PI-RADS lesions. However, a negative or insignificant MRI alone would have missed clinically significant prostate cancer in some patients.More Prostate Cancer Patients Aged 75 Years Old Are Willing to Receive Radical Surgery Than a Decade Ago in ChinaLiang J, Zhu C, Shen H, Qi JXinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, ChinaIntroduction and Objective: We analyzed the shift of first treatment choice among elder prostate cancer (PCa) patients in China in the past 19 years. and Methods: Using an online database, PC-FOLLOW (http://www.pc-follow.cn), we retrospectively analyzed 3172 PCa patients' data, who were aged 75 years at diagnosis between January 1999 and May 2018. The patients were grouped according to their first treatments after diagnosis, and the mean age, PSA value and Gleason score at diagnosis were compared between groups. : Totally, 1055 patients received radical surgery (RS group) as the first treatment, 2096 received hormonal therapy (HT group), 11 received radiation therapy, and 10 received chemotherapy. The last two groups were not further analyzed due to small number. The mean age, PSA and Gleason score of patients in the RS group were 77.2 \u00b12.4, 40.5 \u00b1147.4 and 7.4 \u00b11.5, respectively, and those in the HT group were 80.2 \u00b13.9, 277.7 \u00b1841.9 and 7.2 \u00b11.7, respectively. RS group had significantly younger mean age (P< 0.05) and lower PSA (P< 0.01) than HT group. For yearly analysis, data before 2005 were merged as one due to the patient number. The yearly percentages of patients receiving RS from before 2005 to 2018 were 21.6%, 17.0%, 24.6%, 28.8%, 25.7%, 17.2%, 22.6%, 30.9%, 29.0%, 33.2%, 41.3%, 45.2%, 40.7% and 56.8%, respectively. The yearly mean ages of patients in RS Conclusion: More patients aged 75 years in China receive RS in recent years than a decade ago, and their ages are also increased. The yearly percentages of patients receiving RS were below 30% before 2011, over 40% after 2014, and reached 56.8% in 2018.

Neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies such as pelvic radiation therapy, ADT and chemotherapy are used to minimalize the risk of positive surgical margin and recurrence. Chemotherapy has been the standard of care for CRPC since the development of the taxanes. In recent years, its application has been widened to mHSPC. The question remains whether 39th CONGRESS OF THE SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9 INTERNATIONALE D'UROLOGIE -SIU 2019 ABSTRACT BOOK neoadjuvant administration of cytotoxic agents with RP can improve perioperative outcome and longterm survival. The present study aims to synthesize current available evidence on the tolerance and efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by RP, and to combine data from multiple studies using meta-analysis. and Objective: MRI-Ultrasound fusion guided biopsy has revolutionized the diagnosis of prostate cancer utilizing the prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS) scoring system by multiparametric MRI (MPMRI). The fusion prostate biopsy system, on the other hand, enables accurate targeting of the tumor. Our objective is to determine the detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer using fusion biopsy and to establish the correlation between PI-RADS score and Gleason's score. and Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to correlate PI-RADS score and prostate cancer using MRI-Ultrasound fusion guided trans-perineal prostate biopsy from June 2017 to July 2018 in a single institution. 135 men presented with an elevated PSA, abnormal DRE or a previous negative prostate biopsy, but with a persistent rise in PSA. 220 lesions were identified. : Two hundred twenty PI-RADS 3, 4 and 5 lesions were detected in 135 patients. 131/ 220 lesions were scored as PI-RADS 3, 61 as PI-RADS 4 and 28 as PI-RADS 5.

However, there is little information on the potential benefits of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor(PDE5i) use on dementia in patients with ADT. and Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study of 5,549 PCa patients with ADT utilizing the Chang Gung Memorial Hospitals Research Database (CGRD) of Taiwan between 2009 and 2016. Nested-case control propensity scorematched analysis was performed between PDE5i user and non-users two groups.

The prebiopsy patient parameters, including patient ages, clinical staging, serum PSA levels, prostate sizes, PSA densities as well as pathological results and 30-days complication and readmission rates were retrieved from the clinical notes. The results of the two groups were then compared. : The 200 TPUSPB were performed from January 2018 to October 2018, while the 200 TRUSPB were done from June 2015 to April 2016. There was no statistical difference between the mean ages of the two groups. The mean prostate size of TPUSPB was smaller than TRUSPB (50.5 ml vs 60 ml, p= 0.001) and higher median PSA level (10.95 ng/dL vs 10 ng/dL, p= 0.158). So, the median PSA density of TPUSPB was higher (0.231 vs 0.172, p= 0.001). The prostate cancer detection rate of TPUSPB was statistically higher than that of TRUSPB (34.5% and 25%, p= 0.038). TPUSPB also showed better prostate cancer detection rate after stratifying PSA density and prostate size. For complications, there was no fever developed in TPUSPB group, while 4% of TRUSPB group had fever, requiring admission of at least one-week course of intravenous antibiotic. (p= 0.004). On the other hand, TPUSPB had more post-procedure acute retention of urine (3% vs 1%, p= 0.317) and haematuria requiring admission (1% vs 0%, p= 0.500), but none suffered from per-rectal bleeding (0% vs 0.5%, p= 0.156). : TPUSPB is a safer procedure of getting prostate biopsy with no infection complication.

Materials and Methods: A prospective pilot study started in April 2015.The study included 54 patients of mean age 63 years, with localized prostate cancer. The mean cancerous lesion volume in mpMRI was V=0,59 cm\u2265.A mpMRI, with U/S guided subsequent prostate biopsies using the transperineal fusion 3D technique was performed to all patients before treatment.

During follow-up, no major complications were recorded. : Although more prospective studies with longer follow-up are needed, local thermoablation with low energy diode laser appears to be an equally effective, safer and less expensive modality for low to intermediate risk localized prostate cancer. It could replace active surveillance strategies for patients that do not wish or are not eligible for major surgery or radiotherapy.UP.447, Table 1.

There are many long-term complications associated with renal allograft transplant. One of them is opportunistic infection by BK virus and development of Transitional cell cancer, which, often leads to early graft loss. Case History: A 57-year-old lady, received live related renal allograft transplant in October 2007. She was under close follow up and during May 2012, she had worsening renal parameters with a creatinine of 2.7mg/ dl. She was subjected to graft biopsy, which revealed Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) grade II. Five months later, she was declared as graft failure and started on hemodialysis. She underwent second live unrelated renal transplant in September 2015. Patient then noticed swelling and heaviness in right lower abdomen. Extensive radiological investigations revealed a large heterogeneous mass in graft kidney and graft biopsy revealed, high-grade urothelial ma-lignancy associated with BK virus. Serum BKV was also positive. Radiology findings were suggestive of the mass infiltrating anterior abdominal wall and Right external Iliac vessels being completely encased by the lymph nodal mass with PET CT showing a 1.4 cms right upper lobe lung lesion, multiple avid pelvic LN.

Longitudinal changes of GFR and T-levels were compared between the two groups. Mixed effect model with a random intercept and fixed effects including testosterone, time, age at entry, baseline BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose, lipids and quality of life was fit to the data among controls only to investigate the natural association between GFR and T-levels. GFR was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula.Results: Mean follow-up: 84 months. Age at study entry was 57.7\u00b17.4 years in T-group and 63.9\u00b14.7 years in CTRL. Testosterone levels at baseline were 9.7 nmol/L in both groups (p=0.841). Systolic blood pressure decreased from 152\u00b117 to 131\u00b15 mmHg (T-group) and increased from 142\u00b114 to 148\u00b115 mmHg (CTRL) . As compared to the control group, which experienced a more rapid decline in both T-levels and GFR, those measurements in the T-group remained relatively stable over time. The mixed-effect model showed that for one nmol/L increase in serum T-levels, the GFR increases by 0.308 ml/min/1.73 m2 (p=0.005), after adjusting for confounders. During observation, there were 16 deaths (3.9%) in the T-group. In CTRL, there were 74 deaths (18.8%), 70 MIs (17.8%) and 59 strokes (15%).Conclusion: Long-term testosterone therapy in hypogonadal men may stabilize GFR despite advancing age. In an untreated control group, GFR deteriorated.",

A manual bladder washout using a syringe and sterile water often cannot be performed satisfactorily through this existing foley catheter as the excessive negative pressure applied to evacuate clots often results in catheter wall collapse. We have designed a new rubber catheter with a unique balloon insufflation channel that runs in a spiral along the surface of the catheter. It is soft and atraumatic for easy insertion but when its balloon is insufflated the catheter walls become turgid allowing increased negative pressure before collapse.Materials and Methods: Initial prototypes were made in 70-80 Fr sizes for proof of concept testing. The final prototype was 3D printed to a 20 Fr size using a rubber polymer. 8 catheter prototypes were subjected to suction pressure using a 150-cc nozzle syringe. Catheter tips were occluded (simulating blockage from a clot) and increasing negative pressure via suction from the syringe was applied. At the point of wall collapse, the volume of air within the syringe was recorded and this was then repeated again, with the balloon channel insufflated. We utilised Van der Waals equation to calculate the pressure that led to the wall collapse in mbar.Results: 8 different catheter prototypes were tested, and the collapse pressures recorded (see table 1 ). In our final prototype, with the balloon channel insufflated, the catheter was able to withstand more than double the negative pressure before collapse.Conclusion : We have shown that a catheter with its balloon port channels running in a spiral through its walls can increase its rigidity and defer the point of collapse when suctioning and negative pressure is applied. This would be specifically useful in the context of evacuating blood clots causing catheter obstruction.",

Student's t-test was used to compare the differences of these factors between female and male attending urologists. P <0.05 was viewed as statistically significant.Results: One-hundred-and-eighty male (93.2%) and 13 female (6.8%) urologists were included. Their differences of their service and revenue were shown in Table 1 . Female urologists had significantly more female patients than male urologists. Although they had similar volumes of outpatient service, the yearly revenue attributed to female urologists was significantly less. On the other hand, there is no differences when it comes to inpatient service or yearly surgical volumes.Conclusion: Female patients are prone to visit a female urologist in Taiwan. There are minor limitations of female urologists in outpatient services, representing as less yearly outpatient revenue, but not in inpatient care and surgery.

Variables described in this study includes gender, age, quality of life, hemodialysis after nephrostomy, and complication after procedures.Results: From 33 patients, we evaluated 24 female patients (72.7%) and 9 male patients (27.3%), aged between 29-62 years old (mean 51.39\u00b186). Most of the malignancies found were gynecology, 22 case (66.6%), following by urinary tract malignancies, 8 case (24.3%) and 3 digestive case (9.1%). Quality of Life (QOL) scoring in patients with digestive cancer before nephrostomy was 87-103 points, 74-100 points for gynecology cancer, and 75-100 points for urinary tract (bladder) cancer. In one month's follow up, Quality of life score in patients were improved in digestive, gynecology, and urinary tract malignancies (87-101, 73-104, 70-90) respectively. About 18 patients underwent hemodialysis around 1-3 times a week before nephrostomy. After nephrostomy, 23 patients (69.7%) showed improvement in kidney function, proven by reduced frequency of hemodialysis after nephrostomy procedure. nephrostomy insertion were dislodged and reinsertion (4 case, 12.1%). About 3 patients (9.1%) came to repair the fixation. Two patients (6%) died before 1 month's follow-up due to sepsis and coagulopathy problems.Conclusion: Nephrostomy might be chosen as the treatment for uropathy obstructive due to malignancy.

A median of 2.9 target biopsy cores per suspicious lesion were taken.The overall cancer detection rate of PI-RADS v2 categories 2, 3, 4 and 5 was 7%, 28%, 65% and 100% for all PCa, and 0%, 13%, 49% and 80% for all clinically significant PCa, respectively. The PI-RADSv2 categories were significantly associated with the presence of PCa and clinically significant PCa (each p <0.05). Negative or clinically insignificant PCa in the target biopsy but clinically significant PCa in the systemic biopsy was observed in 8 of 33 cases (24%).Conclusion: PI-RADS v2 is significantly associated with the presence of clinically significant PCa in Japanese men with elevated PSA levels. However, when performing targeted biopsy, the combination with systematic biopsy still provides the highest detection of clinically significant PCa.",

Two variants of AGD [from the anus to the posterior base of the scrotum (AGD AS ) and to the cephalad insertion of the penis (AGD AP )] were measured. Parametric and non-parametric tests andreceiver operating characteristic (COR) analyses were used to determine relationships between AGD and presence of CaP.Results: The highest area under curve (0.69; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.78 and 0.69; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.77) was obtained for the Gleason= 7 subgroup with the AGD AS and AGD AP measurement, with a sensitivity and specificity of 83% and 55%, and 91% and 41%, the predictive positive value of 39% and 35% and negative value of 90% and 93% respectively. 259 structures, e.g. sphincter and neurovascular bundles, are spared avoiding thermal damage. Immediately after TULSA, treatment effects are confirmed by contrast-medium enhanced MRI. Treatment was done in general anesthesia in the MRI. A suprapubic catheter was placed. Patients were hospitalized for one night. A database was kept prospectively for all patients. All patients had mpMRI and PSA before treatment, and at 3-and 12-months follow-up. Complications and functional results were achieved by interviews, IPSS and IIEF questionnaires. To date, 38 patients completed 1-year follow-up.Results: All procedures were completed, no complications occurred intraoperatively. In the early postoperative phase, n=5 pts had symptomatic UTIs, n=2 unilateral epididymitis, which resolved with antibiotic therapy. All patients achieved spontaneous voiding within 2 weeks, no secondary retention occurred after catheter removal. No incontinence or de-novo erectile dysfunction was reported. All patients maintained ejaculatory function, n=9 reported a decrease of ejaculate volume. PSA decreased from 8.61 ng/ml preoperatively to 2.01 at 3 months and 1.99 ng/ml at 12 months. At 12 months, in all patients no residual necrotic tissue and no residual cancer lesions were detected in mpMRI.Conclusion: Focal treatment of low and intermediate risk prostate cancer using MRI-guided and monitored transurethral thermal ultrasound ablation is feasible and safe. There is a fair chance to maintain continence, erectile function, and ejaculatory function. Short term oncological control was achieved. Longer follow-up in a larger number of patients and randomized controlled studies are required to evaluate oncological control.",

Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to assess overall survival (OS), prostate cancer specific survival (PCSS), metastases free survival (MFS), development of castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and biochemical diseas-free survival (BDFS) according to the Phoenix definition. Cox-regression was used to assess predictive factors for OS, PCSS, CRPC and MFS.Results: A total of 187 patients with completed data were treated with sCryo. Median follow-up was 149 months.

A systematic review and meta-analysis such as tomatoes. Several growth factors, including insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), play important roles in carcinogenesis and metastasis. The IGF-1 is mitogens that play important roles in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Binding of IGF-1 to its cognate membrane receptor activates Ras/Raf/MAP kinase signaling pathways, which regulate cell-cycle progression, cell survival, and transformation. Lycopene has its protective effect, which affects multiple IGF-1 activated signaling pathways. Lycopene stimulates apoptosis through intrinsic pathways, by stimulating the pro-apoptotic factor of the mitochondrial cavity such as the Bax/Bak protein (an apoptotic promotor). Although tomatoes are widely consumed in Indonesia, there is no research study about effect of lycopene on prostate cancer in Indonesia. Hence, this study is conducted to measure the influence of lycopene on the level of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in Indonesian human prostate cancer cells.Material and Methods: An experimental study was conducted on Indonesian human prostate cancer cell from a patient with Gleason score 6, divided into 5 groups: 2 control groups and 3 treatment groups that received 1 \u00b5M, 2 \u00b5M and 4 \u00b5M of lycopene respectively.

We included all the patients with urethral stricture above the age of 12 from Jan 2008 to June 2018. Demographic data, possible etiology, and location of urethral strictures were studied. Moreover, the treatment modality used in terms of endoscopic or urethroplasty was noted. Patients with incomplete data were excluded from the study. The diagnosis of urethral stricture was made on the basis of retrograde urethrogram and cystoscopy.Results: A total of 243 patients met our inclusion criteria. The mean age of the group studied was 47 years old. The estimated incidence is 2 cases per 100,000 per year. The most common etiology of urethral strictures was iatrogenic (41.6%), followed by idiopathic causes (30.5%). Other etiologies that accounted for urethral strictures were Infection (16.5%), trauma (8.6%), and Lichen sclerosis (6%). The location of the stricture was classified as penile (8.2%), penobulbar (1.6%), bulbar (83.1%), membranous (1.2%) and panurethral (5.8%).As end point treatment, urethroplasty was performed in 94 patients (38.7% of the cases).Conclusion: Urethral stricture disease is uncommon urological condition.

There was a mean period of 13 months (range: 9-23 months) between phalloplasty and PPI. Semirigid penile prostheses were inserted into the neophallus using dorsal and/or phalloscrotal approach. The proximal end of each cylinder was fixed to the pubic symphysis preventing their displacement. In case of a three-component inflatable prosthesis, cylinders were inserted using dorsal approach. Pump was placed in the proper scrotal sac at opposite side from microvascular anastomosis, while the reservoir was placed retrovesically using the inguinal approach. All patients were evaluated by either a psychologist or a psychiatrist after complete healing.Results: Follow-up ranged from 20 to 120 months (mean 41 months). Inflatable and semirigid penile prostheses were implanted in 22 and 39 patients, respectively. Good functioning with full rigidity was reported in 15 and 37 patients. Rejection of penile prostheses due to infection was noted in 2 patients (inflatable prosthesis) and one patient (semirigid prosthesis), respectively. Inflatable prosthesis was replaced by a semirigid prosthesis in two patients, due to malfunctioning i.e. migration of cylinders with subsequent rigidity of only proximal part of the neophallus and inability to engage the intercourse. Three patients reported no utilization of inflatable implants. Semirigid prosthesis was replaced in two patients because it was broken due to trauma. All patients who engaged in sexual intercourse reported satisfying penetration.Conclusion: Transmen who desire penetrative sexual intercourse require penile prosthesis implantation. Second stage of gender affirmation surgery with PPI represents complex procedure with possible complications, like rejection or malfunctioning. Musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi phalloplasty provides neophallus of good volume and dimensions, offering simple and safe insertion of penile prosthesis. Our study proves lower complication rate in comparison to PPI in other phalloplasty techniques.",

A paediatric urologist was involved in revision of bladder augment and catheterisable channel as adults in three patients. Despite the broad skill set of the interested urologists who specialise in the care of these adult patients, involvement of urologists with different sub-speciality interests is important. In all patients, lifelong surveillance for deterioration of renal function, metabolic issues, bone health second-ary to chronic acidosis and rare bladder malignancy is required.Conclusion: Patients need referral to urologists with the expertise and support structures to look after their complex ongoing issues and provide the necessary ongoing surveillance. The multidisciplinary team is essential. Paediatric surgeons are needed as an integral resource in management of these adult patients. The current randomness of transitional care may mean that exstrophy patients might present acutely for crisis management in emergency departments or as new referrals to general urologists. At these times it is important to appreciate the complexity of their problems and ensure a secure ongoing urological connection.",

Mean penile curvature was 65\u00ba (range 45-90\u00ba). Mean operative time was 95 min (range 75-120 min). Mean follow-up varied from 4 to 13 months (mean 5). Pre-operatively, penile length measured from 11 cm to 16 cm in erection (mean 14). Post-operatively, 2 patients noted penile length reduction of < 1 cm, 5 patients reported no change and 4 noted a slight increase between 1-1.5 cm in erection. Post-operative residual curvature was < 15\u00ba in 3 patients. Patients and partners satisfaction were high.Conclusion: This procedure is safe and efficacious with no or minimal impact on erectile function and penile length.

            "text": "Introduction and Objective: The treatment of lichen sclerosus (LS), affecting the urethra, is challenging because of its uncertain aetiology, the variable response to treatment and the tendency to recur. Super-potent topical steroids are the mainstay of the treatment of the skin disease and may also be used for distal urethral disease by using clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC) to push steroid cream into the distal urethra. In advanced cases urethroplasty is the mainstay of treatment with variable results.Materials and Methods: 91 men with a mean age of 57 years (range 35-82) were treated for LS urethral strictures between January 2016 and December 2018. Outcomes were assessed with symptoms (PROMs), flow rates, urethrograms and the need for further surgery.Results: All patients had a urethral dilatation (UD) as the first line of treatment. 42 patients continued to be managed thereafter by UD, as required. Of these 42 patients, 14 eventually underwent urethroplasty, or perineal urethrostomy. The other 49 patients were started on CISC and most of these used the CISC to push Clobetasol cream through the meatus and into the fossa navicularis and distal penile urethra. 30 of those patients remain on CISC but 11 eventually had surgery. Management by CISC with or without Clobetasol was successful in 73% of patients and tended to be highest in the more distal strictures or the shorter strictures. It isn't clear whether it is the length or the location that matters. Of the patients using Clobetasol only 13% came to surgery, whereas 40% of the patients not using Clobetasol needed surgery. Urethroplasty was successful in 70% of patients with distal strictures, 50% with penile strictures and 0% in those with full length strictures.",

When surgery is indicated perineal urethrostomy seems to be a better option.

A spiral CT Scan is performed with a scan time of 10 seconds. 3D Images are reconstructed. These images are fed to 3D Ultimaker imprinter. The printing is done at a scale of 0.8 of real size. This printing takes about 20 hours.Results: 10 models were created. This included 9 males and 1 female with PFUDD and incontinence. The models along with conventional urethrogram were shown to fellows and observers. Visually they gave a score of 4.3/5. In correlation with urethroplasty, the models helped in decreasing the surgical time and understanding the anatomy of posterior urethra.In the female patient, the model was accurately able to predict hypsoapdiac meatus, urethro vaginal fistula with introital narrowing which helped in decision making.Conclusion: 3 D Printing can be applied to PFUDD to understand anatomy of posterior urethra, its distance from rectum, length of gap, relation to posterior urethra, direction of displacement of urethra, if Pubectomy is required or not. The next step in our mind is to do 3D printing using composite material, mimicking bone so that the urologist can practice pubectomy before performing urethroplasty.",

At that time, his foreskin and glans skin were scarred due to LSA and was excised. Over time, the wound healed with proximal penile skin covering the surface. He presented with recurrent obstructing symptoms. His glans showed unhealthy skin puckered onto the stenosed meatus. His flow was significantly obstructed. His urethrogram showed distal urethral stricture. Proximal urethra showed successful repair. During the glans repair, unhealthy puckered skin was excised. Penis was degloved. Ventral glans incision including urethrotomy was done, extending well into the proximal healthy urethra. This lumen was <4F. The unhealthy mucosa along with underlying fibrosis was excised. The healthy glanular bed thus created was grafted with a BMG. Ventral urethral layer, glanular sponge, fascia and skin were closed. Penile shaft skin was sutured to the corona. Glans was then resurfaced with FTSG from non-hirsute skin of the lower abdomen. Accurate closure was done with cutaneous approximation at corona and mucocutaneous anastomosis at the meatal edge. Compression tie-over dressing was done over 14 F catheter.Results: When the catheter was removed after urethrogram at three weeks, patient voided well. There was no anastomotic leak. The patient had been voiding well with a good flow and remains under follow up.Conclusion: Glans reconstruction in a devastated Navicular fossa and loss of skin cover in LSA is a challenge. However, as long as there is a healthy glanular sponge, excision of the fibrous urethra and grafting entire surface with BMG followed by external resurfacing with nongenital FTSG achieves a good outcome. In terms of statistics, the time of hospitalization has reduced from a median of 4 to 1.2 days, along with the operative time in all kinds of surgical procedures.",

Unique to our study is the development of a HRQoL survey made independently by patient groups, adapted from existing models. Further validation of this survey is required to assess its benefit in future practice. Materials and methods: Indocyanine Green (ICG) evaluation was performed in 7 patients who underwent urethral reconstructive surgery due to urethral stricture with various etiology. Intravenous administration of 5 grams ICG diluted in 2 mL normal saline prior and after intervention of urethroplasty was performed. Near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) imaging with SPY system (Novadaq) was used to evaluate the expression of ICG in corpus spongiosum.Results: There were seven patients included in this study. The mean age was 47,29 \u00b1 8.46 years. Five patients with traumatic stricture and planned for excision and primary anastomosis (EPA). The other two patients were idiopathic and planned for substitution urethroplasty. During the surgery, the ICG expression showed 6 patients had favorable corpus spongiosum that treated as preoperative surgical planning. All these patients had successful outcome. One patient who had unfavorable corpus spongiosum due to trauma had changed the intervention from EPA to vascular sparring anastomotic urethroplasty. At the 3-month follow up, this patient had also good outcome with IPSS score 3 and Q-max 22 mL/s. There were no immediate or delayed adverse effects attributable to intravenous ICG administration.Conclusion: Intravenous injection of ICG during urethral reconstruction surgery allows for real-time vascularization of corpus spongiosum and helps reconstructive surgeon to determine appropriate urethroplasty techniques. However, many symptomatic patients are reluctant to undertake the IC due to the significant morbidity associated with the procedure and multiple consultations required before they consent.

The distal ureter was excised with bladder cuff in cases of TCC involving the distal ureter. The proximal ureteral end was spatulated and re implanted to the bladder either directly or after developing Boari flap to enable tension free, leak proof anastomosis. The robotic surgical system fwe implanted 6 right ureters and 7 left ureters into theoretically created Boari Flap. Negative margin was insured in all the malignant cases.Results: The average patient age was 67 years (ranging from 34-79). We had 6 male and 7 female patients. All cases were completed robotically with no conversion, the patients were followed for an average of 35 months (ranging from 3 months to 72 months). The ureters were patent in all of the 4 (30%) patients who had benign ureteral stricture. However, 3 patients (23%) who had lower ureteral TCC developed ureterovesical anastomosis stricture. All of the strictures were due to high grade TCC on the initial and final pathology after nephroureterectomy with excision of the flap. One patient with history of high grade TCC of the lower ureter developed multifocal high grade TCC in the renal pelvis on the same side 3 years later.Conclusion: Robotic reconstruction of the lower ureter with Boari flap is feasible and has an acceptable oncologic outcome. High grade TCC of the lower ureter is predictor of recurrence at the anastomosis. Longer follow up is needed especially in cases of malignancy.",

            "text": "Introduction and Objective: The rectus abdominal muscle is a useful flap for multiple surgical repairs including complex urethral fistula repair. Traditionally, open harvest with anterior sheath violation has been performed with significant donor site morbidity including hernias, bulges, infections as well as poor cosmesis due to a large incision. The increasing ubiquity and minimally invasive nature of robotics allows for a fascial sparing technique, mitigating morbidity. Materials and Methods: In 2018, four robotic rectus muscle harvests were performed at our institution by the surgeon authors, a urologist and a plastic surgeon, for complex urethral fistula repair. The operating robot (XI or SP) was docked with a GelPort into the intra-fascial space through a 3mm incision. The rectus muscle was freed robotically up to its costal and subxiphoid margin and brought down off the posterior and surrounding fascial sheath. The flap was subsequently used for pelvic soft tissue repair. Demographic as well as peri-operative variables and outcomes were recorded. Results: A total of 632 patients (LMG 323, BMG 309) from 12 comparative studies (4 RCTs and 8 non-randomized) were included for meta-analysis. Overall pooled effect estimates revealed no significant difference between the groups on reported urethroplasty outcomes and operative stricture-related complications. Effect estimates for patient-reported graft harvest site morbidities such as bleeding, pain/discomfort and food intake did not show any differences between the groups at <1-month, 1-3 months and up to 6-12 months follow-ups. However, LMG group reported a higher proportion of patients with difficulty speaking (RR 6.96, 95%CI 2.04-23.70) and tongue protrusion (RR 12.93, 95%CI 3.07-54.51) within 3-21 days postop. The LMG group had significantly less incidence of early post-procedural harvest site swelling (RR 0.39, 95%CI 0.25-0.61) and numbness at <1-month (RR 0.48, 95%CI 0.23-0.97) and 3-6 months (RR 0.52, 95%CI 0.30-0.90) follow-ups. Difficulty in mouth opening was also reported to be significantly lower among LMG group at <1-month follow-up (RR 0.21 95%CI 0.12-0.37).",

The average length of operation was 423.6 \u00b1 86.9 minutes, with an estimated blood loss of 208.9 \u00b1 88.6 mL. Patients were typically out of bed on post-operative day 1, ambulating on post-operative day 2, and discharged home on post-operative day 3 (average day of discharge 3.2 \u00b1 1.4 days). At mean follow-up time of 404.5 \u00b1 272.6 days, 9 (32.1%) patients had developed urethrocutaneous fistulas (with 2 patients developing 2 fistulas) and 2 (7.1%) patients had developed either a stricture or stenosis. Of the 9 patients who developed fistulas, all were at the base of the neophallus near the penoscrotal junction. In two cases, patients developed both a midshaft and penoscrotal fistula. Two fistulas healed spontaneously, and the remainder required surgical repair with one patient developing recurrence. One patient developed a stricture 5mm from the bladder neck after robotic vaginectomy which was refractory to balloon dilation requiring suprapubic tube placement.Conclusion: Use of the split gracilis muscle in first stage phalloplasty represents a novel approach of providing well-vascularized tissue for both urethral support and closure of intra-pelvic dead space with a single flap, in a safe, efficient, and reproducible manner. While fistulas are a common complication after 2 nd stage urethroplasty, they are detected rapidly and managed without complication in the majority of cases. Clinicopathological data were extracted from medical records. Primary outcome was BNC recurrence rate. Secondary outcome was changes to incontinence and other significant complications.",

The median number of endoscopic procedures for BNC prior to BNI and MMC injection was 3 (IQR 2-4). The median time between each endoscopic treatment was 2.5 months (IQR 1-7). We injected 0.8mg of MMC in two patients, 1mg in seven patients and 2mg in one patient. Seven patients (70%) had a successful outcome with a median follow-up of 12 months (IQR 10-22). Two men underwent a repeat procedure with one having durable response after 9 months. Both patients with urinary continence pre-operatively remained continent post-operatively.No Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or above complications directly related to MMC were recorded. Results: 8 strictures (57%) were bulbar, 2 penile (14%) and 4 pan-urethral (29%). 5 patients (36%) had obliterative strictures and were referred with a suprapubic tube in-situ; 5 (36%) presented with poor flow; 4 (28%) had recurrent urinary infections. In the 12 patients with strictures after transplantation, contributory factors to stricture formation were traumatic catheterisation and urinary tract infections. 2 patients had concomitant pancreatic transplants. In them, irritation of the urethral mucosa by pancreatic enzymes was the most likely cause. 7 patients (50%) underwent urethroplasty (2 non-transecting anastomotic bulbar; 1 augmented non-transecting bulbar; 2 dorsal patch augmentation bulbar; 2 single-stage pan-urethral with bilateral sublingual grafts). Surgery was successful in 6 of the 7 (86%). 3 patients were managed with perineal urethrostomy, 2 by interval urethral dilatation and the other 2 perform self-catheterisation. . Nephrectomy duration and warm ischemia time correlated inversely with case number (r=-0,686, p<0,001 and r=-0,485, p=0,019 respectively). According to the Clavien-Dindo system, 5 patients (23%) had grade 2 complications, and 4 (18%) grade 3 complications. Two patients lost the kidney (9%), one due to arterial thrombosis and another due to renal vein thrombosis.The rate of autotransplant success was 91% (n=20), and these kidneys presented normofunction during the all-time of follow-up. No significant difference was found between preoperative mean serum creatinine (Cr) (0,82 mg/dL) and postoperative Cr (0,81 mg/dL) at a mean follow-up of 33\u00b119 months (p=0.89).In 53% patients there was a reduction in the mean arterial pressure, traducing in a lower number of anti-hypertensive agents or diminished dosages.Conclusion: LN is a feasible minimally invasive alternative to treat RAA with indication for autotransplant. It decreases morbidity, while presenting low complication rates and preserving renal function with excellent long-term results. The better surgical results with the increase in case number reflect the importance of referral for tertiary centers.",

The iATP levels were significantly lower in both RTRL1 and RTRM6 groups compared to control (P <0.001), and in the RTRL1 group compared to the RTRM6 (P <0.05). The iATP concentrations were significantly lower in patients who suffered from infection versus the RTRs with stable graft function (SGF). However, the iATP levels were higher in those with allograft rejection episode (ARE). Our optimization experiments showed that best iATP levels cutoffs were 472.5 and 572.5 ng/mL for predicting risk of ARE, and 218.5 and 300.5 ng/mL for predicting risk of developing infection in RTRL1 and RTRM6 patients, respectively.Conclusion: iATP levels measured by immune function assay might be a promising predictive tool for identifying RTRs who are at risk of developing infection or allograft rejection.

One patient of CML died before any surgical intervention. Erectile function was preserved in those 2 CML patients who were presented and treated within 24 hrs. One polycythemic patient who did not respond to HU and phlebotomy has undergone shunt surgery.Conclusion: The management of priapism in patients of hematological disorders should involve an integrated approach, as missing even a single case of hematologic disorder presenting with priapism will have disastrous implications. Urologists need to have a broader outlook in management of priapism. The aspect of this sexual dysfunction is very variable according to the sex, so in the male population the erectile dysfunction was observed in 35.3%, 9.8% for the function of the desire, 15.7% for the orgasmic function, 19.6% for the satisfaction with sexual intercourse and 17.6% for overall satisfaction of sexual function.

            "text": "Introduction and Objective: Ureteral stent placement is a common procedure in urologic practice. Though there has been no definition for \"forgotten\" as any such term does not exist, but many previous studies consider a variable period of greater than 3 to 6 months to constitute a forgotten stent. Forgotten DJ stent can lead to encrustation, infection, migration, hydronephrosis and fragmentation. Forgotten, encrusted ureteral stents represent a difficult problem for urologists, and a consensus on the best therapeutic approach is lacking. We present our experience with endoscopic management of this challenging problem and discuss the chosen treatment combinations.Materials and Methods: Total 6 patients with forgotten double J stent at urology department of the tertiary teaching hospital from October 2018 to March 2019 were included in this retrospective study. The details reviewed included the indwelling time, presenting complaints, radiological and laboratory investigations, their management techniques and complications of the interventions.Results: Five were male while 1 was female with mean patient age of 38.83 years. Most common presenting complaints were loin pain and fever. Four patients had completely encrusted stent with significant sized calculus formation at the ends of stent in bladder and kidney with encrustation in ureter, while two had broken stent with the parts of stent surrounded by calculus formation. One patient was diagnosed with pyonephrosis. All cases were completely cleared off the stent and calculi using combined endourological techniques of cystolithotripsy, URS and PCNL. After stent removal one patient developed sepsis. Biochemical analyses of stent encrustations revealed that encrustations consisted mainly of calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate and ammonium magnesium phosphate.Conclusion: Imaging evaluation and documentation of negative urine culture are imperative prior to any attempt to remove the stent. The use of various combinations of endourological techniques can achieve effective stent and stone treatment after a single anesthesia session with minimal morbidity and short hospital stay. Stent register, computer-based tracking system along with patient education is the key to ensure safety in developing countries.

Maximum UWT at the stone site and Hounsfield units of ureter wall above and below stone was measured from computed tomography images. Clinical predictors of impacted stones were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Moreover, we evaluated the association between UWT and endoscopic findings, as well as surgical outcomes.Results: Of the total procedures, 37 (28.9%) patients had impacted stones. The univariate analysis showed significant differences in hydronephrosis, stone location, stone volume, Hounsfield units of ureter below stone, and UWT in patients with and without impacted stones, and the multivariate analysis showed that stones in the middle ureter, and UWT (P < 0.01) were independent predictors of impacted stones. The receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that 3.61 mm was the optimal cut-off value for UWT. High UWTs and Hounsfield units of ureter wall below stone were associated with the presence of ureteral edema, mucosal erosions and bleeds, stone fixation, longer operation times, and higher stone retropulsion rates, as compared with non-impacted stone group.Conclusion: High UWT and Hounsfield units of ureteral wall below stone was associated with a higher risk of impacted stones and poor endoscopic results in ureteral stones undergoing URSL. Further research is needed on multi-centeric basis as well. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a non-opioid postoperative protocol even in acute setting in recovery for those undergoing URS in carefully selected patients. There should be such studies on other urologic procedure as well in future to look for Non opioids and even NSAIDS free pain killers.",

Forty-six cases involved patients with stones in the upper calyx group, 15 in the middle group and 11 in the lower group. The average size of the residual stones was 8mm (range 7-12 mm), while among 35 of all the patients were detected with 2-3 stones. Lithiasis composition based on post-PCNL stone analysis was mainly calcium oxalate (50%) and struvite (35%).Results: In 48 cases, automatic stone expulsion was observed after ESWL. Of these, 35 were stones located to the upper calyx group, 11 of the middle and 2 of the lower group. Complications were reported; in one case, perirenal hematoma requiring hospitalization was diagnosed, in 5 cases urinary tract infections which were treated with pos antibiotics and in 11 cases macroscopic hematuria consistent for over 2 days. Fourteen patients required additional treatment with ureterolithotripsy after a month period.Conclusion: Using the ESWL in the treatment of residual nephrolithiasis after PCNL is considered to be a safe and effective method, mainly for upper and middle calyx group stones. The incidence of macroscopic hematuria and the risk of renal injury appear to decrease as long as both treatment methods are spaced longer than 3 weeks.",

Mean age was 56.8 years with mean stone size being 13.7 (7-16.6) mm. PP was the Galdakao-modified Valdivia supine position in all patients and mean NP was 1.1 (1-3) . Most punctures were made in the lower pole calyx (81.3%). Four patients had completely tubeless procedures, four were stented while the rest had ureteric catheters which were removed within 24 hours. No transfusion was recorded. Mean LOS was 1.2 days (1-2) and 88% were documented as being stone free at the end of the procedure.Conclusion: The MIP system performed in the supine position has many advantages over conventional PCNL (cPCNL). There is reduced risk of blood loss and reduced length of stay, while preserving the ability to perform flexible nephroscopy. Several anaesthetic, patient and surgeon benefits are also realised. A greater ease in performing tubeless procedures is also confirmed. It's been shown here to be a safe, useful and effective alternative to cPCNL or an adjunct to ureteroscopy.",

First description for bladder stone management was mentioned by Hippocrates. Perineal lithotomy was described by Celsus in 1st century, which was most effective for children compare to adults. Formally, known as apparatus minor, as incision was made in front of anus upto bladder base. Stone was pushed from anus and removed with hook. In 1520 Marinus from Italy, pass sound from urethra and cut over it to remove stone known as apparatus major which leaves patients in sever Hemorrhage and sepsis. If patients survived, then he had total incontinence. Suprapublic lithotomy, 1st done by Calot on prisoners in 1475 and then and popularized by Peire from, France in 1561. In 1719 John Douglass suggested that distended bladder could be open suprapubic extra peritoneal approach and Cheslden performed 3 surgeries with high success but later they left it due to high bowel injury and bladder bursting injury. In July 1824, John Civiale introduced grasping forceps and started the era of lithotripters. In 1858, Sir Henry Thompson by accident popularized the concept of sterility of instruments to decrease mortality from lithotripsy. Biglow in 1894 form sturdy lithotripters. Meanwhile development of optics in 1879 by Nitze and then by Hopking improves cystoscopy vision. Young and Macken developed cystoscopic lithotripsy in 20th century and later Mulvaney in 1953 apply ultra sound for stone fragmentation. In 1986 laser was introduced.Conclusion: Thus, the management of bladder stone evolved from painful lethal complications. But last few decades due better optics and energy sources it is possible to manage bladder stone as day care procedure.",

In our knowledge, trend of treatment for urinary tract stone (UTS) in South Korea remains unknown. In this study, we investigated trend of treatment for UTS via national health insurance database. Materials and Methods: The incidence of UTS and frequency of treatments were retrieved from national health insurance database. Treatments included extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL), open, laparoscopic and endoscopic ureterolithotomy. We analyzed patients by their age, sex, socioeconomic status and place of residence. Results: The incidence of UTS was from 180,000 to 200,000 patients in each year. Among them, patients with ureter stone was 82%. The incidence of UTS increased in the 50s or older, however, decreased in other age group. High socioeconomic status group was diagnosed with UTS more than lower group. ESWL was the most frequently performed procedure for UTS, accounting 93% of the total procedure. In ESWL, 77% of patients were treated in one session and 98.7% of patients were treated in single endoscopic treatments. Conclusion: UTS have increased in people over 50 years, and ESWL was the most frequently performed procedure for UTS in South Korea.",

The occurrence of urinary sepsis was found in 33.4% (6 out of 18) of patients with urinary colonization compared to 36.8% of patients with colonized stones (7 out of 19). On stones culture, we identified Escherichia coli as the most predominant colonizing pathogen (42.1% of cases) followed by Enterococcus feacalis and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (15.8% for each). The chemical nature of colonized stones was predominantly calcium oxalate (monohydrate, dihydrate) and struvite (p = 0.02, p = 0.02) respectively.

In order to reduce the X-ray impact on the staff, decrease the number of kidney punctures same as possibility of pelvicalyceal system puncture for the first time, ultra-sound control was applied for the puncture of pelvicalyceal system, and for the further formation of the operation channel -X-ray control. To reduce the risk of intestinal trauma, lateral PCNL was performed.Material and Methods: Two hundred and sixty lateral-PCNLs in 243 patients, ages 23-78 years, perfomed from 2013 to 2018 were analyzed. In 226 (87%) cases puncture of the middle and lower calyces of the kidney was performed. Endoscopic optical system Karl Storz F24-26 and ultrasound lithotripter were used for surgical procedures. Surgical treatment of kidney stones 2.5-7 cm was performed. The multiple (2-3) accesses were used in 28 (10.7%) in case of coral stones of complex stereometric configuration. The average duration of the operation was 86 minutes. Total blood loss was less than 100 mL. In 251(96.5%) cases operation was completed by a nephrostomy, which remained for 12-36 hours during post-operative period.Results: Experience of pelvicalyceal system puncture under control of the puncture adapter resulted in quick and unequivocally successful puncture of the hollow system of the kidney, in no case leading to perforation. The use of X-ray control only for dilatation of the working channel and post-operative \"stone free\" control reduced the overall radiological impact on the patient and the staff. Post-operative complications (such as exacerbation of chronic pyelonephritis, macrohematuria) were observed in 39 (15%) cases. Bleeding which required substitution hemostransfusion, in the post-operative period, was not detected. The \"stone free\" effect was achieved in 239 (92%) cases.",

The literature is dead; there is no ongoing discussion of the strengths, weaknesses, and key messages of landmark papers and resources. Most doctors have only a superficial understanding of relevant medical literature. There is currently no central repository of analytical reviews and insights of the current literature. Our objective is to create an online crowd-sourced collaborative platform bringing together the best analytical reviews, insights, tweets, journal clubs and conference discussions about the important landmark papers and resources vital to the prostate cancer journey.

Based on the stone-free level, it was found that postoperative stonefree conditions carried out by urology consultants there was no significant difference with post-operative stone-free conditions carried out by the residents (P>0.05). While based on the duration of the operation, the duration of surgery performed by urology consultant, does not have a significant difference with the surgery carried out by the residents (P>0.05). Based on the unpaired t-test, no significant differences were found in complications, stone-free rates and average duration of operation in PCNL surgery by urology consultants and urology residents. Conclusion: PCNL is one of the main endoscopic procedure for stone treatment, but it still remains difficult procedure with long life learning. More structure training program, restriction of working hour on training, and training under supervised clinical practice would improve learning capability for PCNL.",

We asked also both patients (n=14) and urologists (n=7) about ethical and legal aspects of this accident.Results: The series accounts 12 male patients and two females with a median age of 52+/-6,2 years. The primary pathology was urolithiasis (n=9), ureteral injury (n=2), sepsis (n=1) and renal trauma (n=2). Most of patients (n=9) seems to be not explicitly and adequately informed about the procedure and the stent. In only 10 cases, the urologist and the stuff seem to make a serious effort to contact the \"absent\" patient. Various complications were reported: non-functioning kidney (n=1), encrusted double J stent (n=6), lumbar pain (n=7), urinary infection (n=3), haematuria (n=5) and LUTS (n=10). Seven patients pointed on the urologist responsibility, 3 the hospital respon-sibility and 3 their own responsibility. All urologists but one engages their legal and ethical responsibilities in such situation.Conclusion: Leaving a double J stent in a patient may result in disastrous situation. The indication should be well discussed and the patient well informed about the stent and possible complications.

The data was analysed using bivariate Spearman's Correlation test using SPSS Statistics.Results: 56.2% of the 96 medical students were of female gender and mean age was 22.6 years. Our results report that a majority of the students preferred global (62.5%) style over sensing. The percentage of active and reflective learners were fairly evenly distributed (46.9% vs 53.1%). 16.3% of medical students had moderate or severe scores for depression, 31.3% for anxiety and 18.8% for stress. Depressive levels are correlated with being a reflective learner (Spearman's rho= 0.371, p= 0.036) and being a global learner (Spearman's rho= 0.411, p= 0.02). Gender or age did not have any significant impact on the active/reflective or sequential/global domains. Anxiety and stress levels did not show any correlation to the learning styles.Conclusion: Urology teaching tends to be more active as opposed to reflective. Depressive levels are correlated with reflective and global learning styles, hence there should be greater efforts to reach out to learners whose styles may be marginalised during urology postings. In addition, medical education should include tutelage of student to adopt a more active learning style through problem-based learning and direct interactions.",

Non iatrogenic intraperitoneal ruptures are caused by a sudden rise in intravesical pressure secondary to a blow to the pelvis or lower abdomen.

The cause of the rupture was endoscopic procedures in the bladder in 3 patients, blunt trauma in 2 patients and obstetric surgery in 2 patients. In all patients a two-way foley catheter was placed. In addition, an intraperitoneal drainage tube was inserted by ultrasound or CT guidance. The decision of this minimally approach was due to concomitant diseases which prevented us from open surgery or due to the patients' denial to undergo surgery.Results: Mean duration of catheterization was 18 days. The intraperitoneal drainage tube was removed in an average of 5 days after its initial insertion. All patients underwent cystography prior to the removal of the two-way foley catheter which confirmed the successful management of the rupture. No patient underwent open surgery and no severe complications were noted (fever, renal failure, intraperitoneal abscess).Conclusion: Complicated intraperitoneal bladder ruptures caused by iatrogenic maneuvers or blunt trauma can be managed in a minimal invasive way by a combination of a two-way foley catheter in the bladder plus an intraperitoneal drainage tube inserted via ultrasound or CT guidance. All patients initially managed in this way in our department presented no need of open surgical exploration. As a result, minimally invasive treatment is a viable and safe choice especially in patients with concomitant diseases unfit for open surgical exploration.",

There were slightly higher incidence and shorter time to develop urethral stricture in the RIUR group, but they were not statistically significant difference (p >0.05, respectively).Conclusion: RIUR is excellent short-term outcomes such as simplicity of anesthesia and short procedure time, while PEUR has a merit that the incidence of urethral stricture, which is a complication, is low and takes longer time.",

Thirty-five patients with fracture of penis were included in the study by maintaining the selection criteria. After proper evaluation and taking informed written consent, surgery was performed under spinal anesthesia. The tear of corpora cavernosa and concomitant urethral injury repaired with polyglactin suture material. Intraoperative artificial erection was performedin all cases. Patients were advised to abstain from sexual activity for 6 weeks following surgery. Follow up was given at 6 weeks, 3 months and at 6 months. Postoperative erectile function assessed by validated questionnaires of IIEF-5 for married and single question self report (SQSR) for unmarried patients. Voiding status through IPSS. All patients were interviewed to complete the same questionnaires retroactively for assessment of erectile function and voiding status before fracture of penis.Results: The patients were in the age range of 24 to 60 years, and mean age was 36.4 years. The most common precipitating cause for fracture was vigorous sexual intercourse (68.57%). Mean time of occurrence to surgery was 10.26 \u00b12.3 hours (4hrs to 48 hrs). Rupture of tunica albugenia occurred in all cases with rupture of corpora cavernosa in right, left and bilateral was 65.71%, 25.71% , 8.51% subsequently. Urethral injury found in 4 cases. Four patients developed mild form and three had mild to moderate form of erectile dysfunction. Two patients had mild urinary symptoms according to IPSS score. Wound infection was present in 3 cases, four patients had developed mild penile curvature. Nodule presented at fracture site in every case with gradual reduction in size. All patients complained of pain during intercourse, but pain gradually subside with time with adequate erection.Conclusion: Early surgical correction of fracture penis is associated with good outcome with preservation of erectile and voiding functions.",

Four of them happened in-house and three were referred from other centers. All were males with a mean age of 35.7 years. Avulsion involved left side in 4 patients and right in 3. All patients had impacted relatively large (mean 11.3 mm) ureteric stones with proximal ureteric location in 6 and distal ureteric location in 1. The semi-rigid ureteroscopes used ranged from 4.5/6 F to 8/9.5 F. Five cases had two-point avulsions with loss of the whole length of ureter. Two cases had one-point avulsion-one distal ureteric and the other mid-ureteric. Three avulsions were caused by senior-consultants, 3 by junior consultants, and 1 by a trainee. One distal ureteric avulsion was repaired by immediate uretero-neo-cystostomy. In a case of one-point mid-ureteric avulsion with ureteroscope and stone basket stuck at the injured site, immediate laparotomy was done, instruments were disentangled followed by uretero-ureterostomy. Two patients with two-point avulsions were managed with immediate laparotomy and classical ileal replacement of ureter. Three cases with two-point avulsion referred from elsewhere were initially managed with percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN). Subsequent definitive repair involved classical ileal replacement of ureter in 2 patients and complete ureteral replacement by yang-Monti technique in one. All patients had satisfactory outcome.Conclusion: This is one of the largest series of ureteral avulsions. Two-point avulsion was commoner than one-point avulsion. Risk factors for ureteral avulsions were male gender and relatively large impacted proximal ureteral stones. Small size of the scope and long experience of the surgeon are not necessarily safeguard against ureteral avulsion. Prevention involves avoiding forceful endoscopic maneuver and staging the procedure in case of difficulty. The classical ileal replacement of ureter is a reliable salvage option in the acute situation. Yang-Monti technique of ileal replacement of ureter is also a viable option in a stable patient who has been managed initially with PCN for few weeks.",

He was also advised psychiatric evaluation for further evaluation as an outpatient.Conclusion: There are only a few published articles on insertion of foreign bodies on male urethras. The diagnosis of a foreign object may be difficult due to inconsistent claims during history taking. Consequently, patients may come in for consult due to the secondary complications. Management of these cases is primarily surgical which include cystourethroscopy to diagnose urothelial injuries and to directly visual-ize if there are no fragments left. These objects can be successfully extracted by endoscopic methods with the aid of forceps, snares, and baskets. Psychiatric intervention is later warranted to these patients. Introduction and Objective: Nocturnal Enuresis (NE) is a common problem in the pediatric population, affecting up to 8en at 10 years of age. NE can have a profound psychologic impact on a child'self-esteem and social interactions as well as contribute to parental frustrations and anxiety. in this study we aim to investigate the effect of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) in children with primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis Materials and Methods: A total of 60 patients were included in this prospective study. They were divided into two groups: Group 1: Included 30 patients, each patient was submitted to one PTNS session per week for 12 week each session last for 30 minutes. Group 2: Included 30 patients, each patient was submitted to medical treatment.",

We conducted a questionnaire-based study aiming to record the differences in quality of life (QoL), UI severity and health seeking behaviors between neurological and non-neurological patients. We also developed and studied the psychometric properties of the Health Behavior Questionnaire (HBQ), a three-domain gender-specific tool to assess embarrassment, fear and decision making when seeking medical advice for UI. Materials and Methods: Neurological and non-neurological patients with UI who attended a public teaching hospital's Urology outpatient clinics were interviewed. The study tool comprised five modules: 1) demographics and medical history, 2) King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ), 3) International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence (ICIQ-UI) 4) HBQ, 5) a previously validated treatment adherence questionnaire.Results: We recruited 100 neurological and 100 non-neurological patients (36 men, 164 women). Most neurological patients (52%) suffered from MS. Almost half (55.1%) had sought medical advice. Of them, 68.7% were under UI medication for more than a year. Neurological patients scored higher in the KHQ domains of incontinence impact (p=0.018), physical (p=0.028) and social (p=0.000) limitations, personal relationships (p=0.008), emotions (p=0.002) and embarrassment related to UI (p=0.048). The two groups demonstrated similar severity of UI in ICIQ-SF scores. HBQ Validation. The HBQ modules showed either excellent (Cronbach's \u03b1 =0.852 and 0.757 for embarrassment and fear modules, respectively) or moderate reliability (\u03b1 =0.601 for decision making about treatment seeking). HBQ results. Neurological patients scored higher in fear to reveal bad habits to physicians (p=0.046), were more commonly referred to a Urologist by their treating Neurologist (p=0.01), more concerned about outpatient clinics' accessibility and facilities (p=0.021), but less concerned about possible financial burden associated with medical visits (p=0.01), more compliant with the timing of administration of medication (p=0.024) and a daily medical regimen (p=0.047), and understanding the need for medical treatment (p=0.047).Conclusion: Neurological patients were more severely affected in their QoL by UI than non-neurological patients, and showed differences in factors affecting decision-making when seeking medical advice and in adherence to treatment. The HBQ might become a reliable tool to explore health behaviors towards treatment-seeking for UI. Results: Case 1: 19-year-old female with history of urogenital sinus anomaly status post vaginal reconstruction with total urogenital mobilization 10 years prior. The patient had been doing self vaginal dilation for vaginal stenosis when she developed discomfort and acute onset urinary incontinence. Exam revealed a 24Fr urethrovaginal fistula immediately distal to the most stenotic portion of the vagina and 2cm proximal from meatus. Cystoscopy revealed no additional urologic trauma. With the patient in prone jackknife position, the vagina was repaired at the same time to allow exposure. The fistula tract was excised and the urethra repaired in 3 layers. The stenotic segment of the vagina was incised and augmented posteriorly using a 2x2 cm vaginal mucosal graft harvested from redundant distal vaginal tissue. A 16Fr catheter was left for 2 weeks. At most recent follow-up, she has no urinary symptoms, urethral stricture or fistula. Case 2: 27-year-old female with history of Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome and vaginal agenesis managed with vaginal dilation. During vaginal self-dilation, the patient developed vaginal bleeding. Intra-operative exam revealed an anterior vaginal wall tear and ventral urethral disruption to the level of the bladder neck. Cystoscopy revealed no additional urologic trauma. The urethra was repaired in two layers in dorsal lithotomy position. A 16fr catheter was left for 7 days. At follow-up, she has mild stress urinary incontinence but has no urethral stricture or fistula.",

This review aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transobturator and autologous sling surgery in pRP-SUI. Materials and Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL were systematically searched for prospective studies investigating the outcomes of transobturator and autologous sling surgeries for pRP-SUI. The primary outcomes were cure and improvement rates of pRP-SUI. The secondary outcome was the rate of surgical complications.Results: Fourteen studies (eleven involving transobturator and three autologous slings) with a total of 877 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Cure rates were 50% (95% Cl 39% -60%) in transobturator and 82% (95% Cl 58% -93%) in autologous slings, whereas improvement rates were 30% (95% Cl 26% -34%) and 20% (95% Cl 14% -28%), respectively. Complication rates were 12% (95% Cl 6% -20%) and 10% (95% Cl 3% -27%) in transobturator and autologous slings, respectively. Our findings indicate that both transobturator and autologous slings are effective in curing and improving pRP-SUI, with similar complication rates. Evidence is insufficient to support superiority of either surgical treatment. Further randomised controlled trials are necessary to directly compare the two procedures.",

Sacral Neuromodulation (SNM) has shown to be a very effective treatment option for these refractory symptoms. Although this treatment modality has been available for decades, to our knowledge there is no data on the impact of surgeon's experience on long-term outcomes.Materials and Methods: Failure of SNM was reviewed in patients who had received the implant during the first year in practice of a single surgeon and compared to failure rates in those who received the implant after 18 months of the surgeons' experience. The outcomes were categorized into (1) initial results (at the first two post-implant visits), (2) early results (during the first 18 months) and (3) long-term results (18-36 months). The study period was confined between December 2013 and December 2015 to allow for three years follow-up. Failure was defined as (1) < 50% improvement despite conservative management or (2) revision of the implant due to inefficacy or bothersome symptoms resulting from the implant.Results: A total of 25 patients had received SNM implants during the first year of the surgeon's experience while 31 implantations were done between 18 and 24 months of experience. The demographic data, including age, sex, BMI and the distribution of patients with storage symptoms, urinary retention and pelvic pain were similar in the two groups (p >0.05). Mean implantation time during the first and second years of experience were 55 minutes (25-142) and 36 minutes (24-60) respectively; with 34% of surgeries in the first year lasting > 60 minutes. Initial failure rates were higher during the first year (12% vs 6.25%); however, this was not statistically significant (p= 0.44). Although Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test did not show significant outcome difference during 36 months of follow-up (p= 0.6), the long term outcomes (after 540 days of follow-up) were significantly better in patients who had received the implants during the second year of surgeon's experience (p= 0.04). Introduction and Objective: Radical prostatectomy is one of the most commonly used treatments for localized prostate cancer. Urinary incontinence and erectile disfunction are frequent consequences of the procedure. They are the main predictors of patients\u00b4 quality of life. Age and body mass index appears to be the main predictors for urinary incontinence after surgery. Some studies suggest that membranous urethra characteristics are associated with urinary incontinence after surgery. We reviewed the rates of continence and compared with membranous urethra characteristics evaluated by magnetic resonance. Two patients referred \"a small amount\", 6 patients \"a moderate amount\" and 10 patients \"a large amount\". Mean urethral length in continent patients was 14.0 mm. Mean sphincter width was 12.75 mm. Among patients with moderate and large amount of urinary leak mean urethral length was 17.0 mm and mean sphincter width was 11.0 mm. No significant difference was found between both groups. Conclusion: Urinary incontinence is a major concern in patients\u00b4 quality of life after radical prostatectomy. Our study didn\u00b4t show any difference between continence status and membranous urethra characteristics in magnetic resonance.",

Perioperative details along with the last available follow-up were included in the analysis.Results: In total, 10 patients were included. The mean age (\u00b1SD) was 33.4 (\u00b111.9) years and 9 (90%) were males. The most common presentation was irrita-tive and obstructive lower urinary tract symptoms (90%) along with haematuria (30%), suprapubic pain (40.0%) and acute urinary retention (10%). All of the patients underwent transurethral resection of the bladder tumor as diagnosed on preoperative imaging. All of the patients had a trigonal lesion with bullous appearance partially obstructing the bladder neck. Five patients (50%) had backpressure changes in the kidneys and underwent either bilateral JJ-stenting or percutaneous nephrostomy. The mean follow-up duration was 15.4 months. Patients were kept on surveillance cystoscopy along with upper tract evaluation. The mean number of recurrences was 1.7 (\u00b10.8) with a mean number of recurrent resections was 1.4 (\u00b10.4). One of the patients had to undergo bilateral ureteric reimplantation with resection of the lesion along with augmentation cystoplasty while another patient underwent cystectomy with urinary diversion owing to recurrence and refractory lower urinary tract symptoms. In addition, there was no evidence of malignancy subsequent to this entity in any of the patients.Conclusion: Cystitis cystica is a rare entity and usually occurs in the younger population. Exact etiology and natural course of the disease is still unknown.

Continence was assessed at 3 and 12 months post RRP and was defined as 0-1 pads per day for occasional dribble. Statistical analysis was performed using Welch's t test with p value <0.1 considered to be statistically significant Results: Preoperative, surgical and post-operative care was standardized for all 33 patients included in this study. 45% of patients achieved full continence by 3 months.

Patients suffering from MS usually present with overactive bladder syndrome. Most common symptoms are increased frequency, urgency, incontinence and nocturia which intervene negatively in the quality of life and also affect the ability of patients to work. LUTS occur on average 6 years after the onset of the disease while all patients experience LUTS within a period of 10 years since the initial diagnosis. Our objective is to study the efficacy and safety of treating patients with MS and LUTS using either b3 agonist (mirabegron) or anticholinergics.Material and Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial including 40 patients with MS and LUTS from a single center. At baseline all patients underwent thorough clinical examination including neurological examination and DRE. Medical history was recorded. All patients underwent urine test, urine cultivation and abdominal ultrasound. All patients completed a urination diary (for at least 3 consecutive days) and specific questionnaires such as MusiQoL and NBSS. At second visit and after all the above were completed, all patients were administered either a b3 agonist (mirabegron) or anticholinergics. The choice of which anticholinergic drug to be used was random as no such drug shows any superiority compared to the others. More specifically, twenty patients (the 1 st group) received mirabegron 25mg and twenty patients (the 2 nd group) received solifenacin 5mg, tolterodine 2mg or fesoterodine 4mg. The treatment was always carried out alongside with the MS treatment. Reevaluation was performed 3 months after the first visit. All patients underwent the same clinical and imaging tests that were carried out at first visit.",

Bladder function: 87% (13/15) use SARS successfully 4-5 times/ day, with a 250-700cc voiding volume and 50cc post void residual. One patient with de novo sphincter incompetence received a synthetic male sling. Three pt. (20%) require occasional bladder catheterization (all caregiver-dependent quadriplegics). Two pt. (13%) failed urinary management: 1 pt. did not increase bladder capacity, remaining incontinent and the other did not tolerate SARS due to painful stimulations; both required a continent urinary diversion. Six pt. (40%, all quadriplegics) presented symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs), related to poor caregiver technique. Defecatory function: 93% (14/15) successful daily use. Erectile function: 85% (11 of 13 males) obtain good erections with SARS stimulation. However, of the 6 patients sexually active preSARS, only two (33%) use SARS for intercourse because of displacement of the external antenna. Eventually, 4 patients (31%) require a penile prosthesis implantation. Complications included: two patients (13%) showed postoperative neurapraxia, which resolved spontaneously after 12 months, and two other patients (13%) suffered extrusion of the internal antenna. We observed malfunction/damage of the external hardware in 10pt (67%), mostly related to operator misuse.Conclusion: SARS success was 87% for micturition, 93% for defecation and 33% for intercourse. Our main difficulties were in caregiver-dependent quadriplegics due to operator misuse, causing damage of the external hardware or symptomatic urinary tract infections. Loss of reflex erections was also an undesired side effect in sexually active patients. According to this, we believe the best candidate for SARS is an adult able paraplegic, without use of his reflex erections for intercourse.",

Eighty-two ATOMS \u00ae devices have been implanted in two tertiary hospitals in Spain, from September 2012 to March 2019. 78 were analyzed (6 months follow-up) Clinical data, etiology and SUI severity were initially collected. Preoperative evaluation was performed by cough stress test, cystoscopy, 24-hours pad-test and urodynamics. Outcomes, complications and evolution were registered during follow-up. Statistical analysis was done through Stata 2.0.Results: Mean age was 67 years (\u00b14.8). Radical prostatectomy was the most common cause of SUI (86%). 22% had received external radiotherapy (ERT) previously.33 patients had mild-to-moderate SUI and 58% were severe SUI. Median follow-up was 37.8 months (\u00b121). Continence-rate (dry or less 10g/24h): 74% at 6 months, 78% at 12 months, 79% at 24 months, 83% at 36 months, 80% at 48 months and 88% at 60 months. No differences in continence rate were found between mild, moderate or severe SUI. Continence rate in ERT patients was lower (p<0.0001): 39%, 37%, 38%, 55%, 57% and 60%, respectively. Device refill was performed in 87% patients (3.3\u00b12.24 times each). 5 abdominal valves, 17 scrotal valves and 56 scrotal pre-assembled valves (72%) have been implanted. There were no complications during surgery.Minor complications: 11 spontaneous voided devices and 3 acute urinary retentions. These complications were less frequent in pre-assembled devices (p<0.04). Major complications: 4 valves were removed (3 infections and 1 extrusion). 2 patients needed burying valve. 5 devices were totally removal due to infection (3) and urethral perforation (2).Reoperation rate was 14%.Patient satisfaction was assessed with visual analogical scale: 8.7.Conclusion: ATOMS \u00ae device is safe, easy to implant and can treat male SUI successfully with a low rate of complications and device explanations.

Urodynamic and clinical parameters were compared between groups. The primary endpoint was the rates of success defined as the combination of urgency, urinary incontinence, and detrusor over activity resolution.Results: All cases in both GA and LA groups had Urodynamics beforehand and ISC taught. ISC was used in 5 cases in each group. The patient reported response was 18/18 in the GA group and 19/22 in the LA group. The average time to response was 15.3 months in the GA group and 10.5 months in the LA group. There were 4 UTIS in each cohort, but two with voiding dysfunction and one with retention of urine in the LA group.Conclusion: Intradetrusor botox injection is efficacious and safe, with a good patient response. Patient reported outcome measures are successful for assessing outcomes from onabotulinum therapy. Total patients were ninety women with equal severity for stress and urge MUI. Postoperative SG were 66 patients (73.3%) and DG were 24 patients (26.7%). PSR included CG were 84 (93.3%) and FG were 6 (6.7%).

Regarding data about predictors of early or intermediate-term continence following RARP, some factors, including age, obesity, membranous urethral length, surgical procedures and prostate volume, were reported. However, estimations of urodynamic study (UDS) parameters in prediction of continence after RARP were limited. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of UDS data in recovery of urinary incontinence of elder patients underwent RARP.Materials and Methods: Between April 2014 and December 2017, seventy patients with prostate cancer received UDS before and at 3 months after RARP at our institution. We divided them into two groups; young group (less than 70 years old, n=43) and senior group (70 years old and over, n=27), and then classified each group as urinary continence (UC) or incontinence (UI) in the assessment of urinary function at 3 months post-RARP. Continence was defined by 0-pad or 1-safety pad usage at 3month follow-up. Patient and operative characteristics included body mass index (BMI), initial prostate-specific antigen (iPSA), staging, prostate volume, operation time, blood loss volume and performance of nerve sparing.Results: There is no significant difference in continence rate at 3months after RARP between the young and senior group (67.4% vs 66.7%, p= 0.596). In the senior group, the maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP) of UI was significantly lower than that of UC (71.1\u00b1 40 vs 112.8\u00b1 50.7, p= 0.038). The presence rate of detrusor overactivity (DO) at 3 months post-RARP in UI of senior group was significantly higher than that in UC of them (75% vs 35.3%, p= 0.01). Other variables (BMI, iPSA, staging, prostate volume, operation time, blood loss volume and nerve sparing) did not differentiate significantly between UC and UI in senior group. Moreover, multivariate regression analysis in total patients revealed that the post-operative DO was an independent predictor of continence 3 month following RARP (odds ratio [OR] 0.19, confidence interval [CI] 95%: 0.06, 0.6).",

While pubovaginal sling (PVS) still be the gold standard one, synthetic mesh sling procedures has been developed with high efficacy and showed shorter operative time.

Patient's comorbidity, incontinence severity, socioeconomic status as well as national reimbursement system that synthetic mesh can't reimbursed would be impact on patient's desire and expectation.

One patient died and four patients couldn't be contacted. Consequently, 65 patients participate in this study.Results: Thirty patients choose synthetic mesh sling procedures due to afraid of PVS's complications include pain, retention, increase operative time that's related to impact on patient's comorbidity. Thirty-five patients choose PVS due to financial problem or surgeon recommendation on incontinence severity. Effectiveness of each technique is not different. But PVS seem to have more complication in some aspects (i.e.urinary retention, suprapubic wound complications). No urethral mesh erosion or infection were observed in this study.Conclusion: Principle concern that's affected on patient's decision making is post-operative compli-cations and financial problem as well with national reimbursement system. Second concern is surgeon recommendation. In order to satisfy the patient and improve treatment outcome, we have to break those limitations with the surgeon providing suitable treatment options for individual patient. Moreover, this study's results can urge institutes and government to realize in patient's limitations and find the way to solve these problems leading to improve treatment strategies, develop our country and make it standardization. Overactive bladder (OAB), a symptom syndrome presenting with frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence, substantially affects the lives of millions of people. The symptoms associated with OAB can significantly affect the social, psychological, occupational, domestic, physical, and sexual aspects of those who suffer from it. The main therapeutic modalities are conservative therapies, such as pharmacological treatment and behavioral therapy. Mirabegron, a b3-adrenergic agonist, is established as an alternative monotherapy to antimuscarinics for the treatment of OAB symptoms. Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is a behavioral intervention aiming at reducing detrusor activity. The study aimed to evaluate if PFMT improves the therapeutic effect of mirabegron in women suffering from OAB.",

The main differences in these methods were in the patient's positioning and using ultrasound or fluoroscopy as a guide for stone removal. In all of the guidelines, PCNL has been proposed as a Gold standard to remove large (above 2 cm) and staghorn kidney stones. The strength of PCNL versus other methods has been higher Stone Free Rate in most studies. However, in all studies, high rates of complications of PCNL have been reported (up to 87%). On the other hand, by increasing the length of the surgical procedure, the risk of complications related to anesthesia and surgery, especially in patients with advanced age and underlying cardiovascular and pulmonary problems increases. To overcome these issues, we described the new method of stone removal is PCNL (Enbloc through the skin).",

Available evidence confirms the causative role for chronic inflammation in the formation of prostatic inflammatory atrophy which could eventually develop into precancerous lesions known as prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Recent studies advocate the contribution of the innate and adaptive immune system in prostate cancer tumorigenesis mediated by infiltration of immune cells and release of proinflammatory cytokines. However, the effect of immunologic response ranges from tumor progression to suppression depending on the stage of cancer. Intriguingly, Interleukin gene polymorphism has been shown to have an impact on the incidence rate of prostate cancer, emphasizing the significance of both genetic background and inflammatory state in the pathogenesis of the disease.",

For each patient the appropriate reconstructive surgery was planned based on the patient's complaint and complications. Follow-up visits were scheduled for 1 week, 1, 3 and 12 months, postoperatively.Results: Eleven patients had a history of vaginoplasty using the small intestine, whereas in 10 patients it was done with penile and perineal skin. Three cases needed clitoroplasty. Increased vaginal depth was indicated in four patients due to vaginal shrinkage which was repaired using amniotic membrane and a vaginal stent. Urethroplasty was performed in 5 patients. Skin Removal was required in 4 cases. In 5 patients in whom their previous vaginoplasty had been performed as a superficial pouch at the perineal area, vaginoplasty was done with our classic method. None of the patients reported any major complications during this period and were generally satisfied with their sexual intercourse.Conclusion: Using the various methods of redoing reconstruction of the external genitalia when the surgeon has enough experience might lead to desirable functional and aesthetic results.",

According to logistic regression, the type of patient's participation in decision-making is related to 4 factors, which are the patient's age, education background, medical payment style, and whether it is the first time of hospitalization.Conclusion: Currently, the participating attitude of Chinese patients with prostate cancer in surgical decision-making is more positive than before, but participation in decision-making status is not ideal, so it is a long and arduous task to promote the surgical decision-making of patients with prostate cancer. Medical staff should assess patients' decision-making needs, strengthened communication with patients and their families, in order to promote the degree of patients' participation in the decision-making of surgery. Introduction and Objective: Decision-making around treatment for non-metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) is notoriously complex. Shared decision-making depends upon both clinician and patient having a good understanding of the benefits and harms of different management options. We created PREDICT Prostate, a newly released individualised prognostic model that provides long-term survival estimates for men diagnosed with non-metastatic PCa. The objective of this study is to assess if PREDICT: prostate affects clinician estimates of prognosis and therefore its potential impact on treatment recommendations.",

PREDICT Prostate uses routinely collected clinicopathological information such as age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), histological grade, biopsy core involvement, stage, and primary treatment to determine PCa-specific mortality. PRE-DICT Prostate also contextualizes treatment benefit against non-PCa specific mortality by factoring in comorbidities and age. The tool is now freely available through an easy-to-understand webpage (www.prostate.predict.nhs.uk). In total, 190 clinicians (63% urologists, 17% oncologists, 20% other) were randomised into two groups and shown 12 clinical vignettes. Each group viewed opposing vignettes with clinical information alone, or alongside PREDICT Prostate estimates. 15-year clinician survival estimates and treatment recommendations, with and without the tool, were measured.",
