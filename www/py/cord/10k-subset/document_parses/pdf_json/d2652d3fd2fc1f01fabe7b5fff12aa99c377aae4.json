Methods: Prospective observational study. Enrolled horses had a physical examination performed and nasal secretions collected at the time of entry and subsequently if any horse developed signs of respiratory disease during quarantine. Samples were assayed for equine influenza virus (EIV), equine herpesvirus type-1, 22, 24, and 25 (EHV-1, 22, 24, 25), equine rhinitis virus A (ERAV), and B (ERBV) and Streptococcus equi subspecies equi (S. equi) using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Results: Equine herpesviruses were detected by qPCR in 52% of the study horses including EHV-2 (28.7%), EHV-5 (40.7%), EHV-1 (1.2%), and EHV-4 (3.0%). Clinical signs were not correlated with being qPCR-positive for EHV-4, EHV-2, or EHV-5. None of the samples were qPCR-positive for EIV, ERAV, ERBV, and S. equi. The qPCR assay failed quality control for RNA viruses in 25% (46/ 167) of samples. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Clinical signs of respiratory disease were poorly correlated with qPCR positive status for EHV-2, 24, and 25. The importance of g-herpesviruses (EHV-2 and 5) in respiratory disease is poorly understood. Equine herpesvirus type-1 or 4 (EHV-1 or EHV-4) were detected in 4.2% of horses, which could have serious consequences if shedding animals entered a population of susceptible horses.

Herpesviruses are commonly shed by imported horses, and young horses and some breeds may represent a higher risk. It is important to note that clinical signs were poorly correlated with being qPCRpositive for EHV-2, EHV-4, or EHV-5. The lack of clinical signs in horses with herpes viral infection increases the risk of introducing a shedding horse into a susceptible population. These findings demonstrate the need for rigorous biosecurity measures when introducing recently imported horses into resident equine populations.
