Current therapeutic options include administration of all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), but this treatment produces many side effects. ATRA is known to induce differentiation of leukemic cells into granulocytes, but the mechanism of this process is poorly studied. We performed comparative proteomic profiling of HL-60 promyelocytic cells at different stages of ATRA-induced differentiation to identify differentially expressed proteins by high-resolution mass spectrometry and relative quantitative analysis without isotope labels. A total of 1162 proteins identified by at least two unique peptides were analyzed, among them 46 and 172 differentially expressed proteins were identified in the nuclear and cytosol fractions, respectively.

The median survival was less than 1 week. The disease poorly responded to treatment: the first available therapy with 6-mercaptopurine led to remission in only 5-14% patients; introduction of anthracyclines (including daunorubicin) made it possible to increase the probability of remission to 58% [4] . Discovery of differentiation-inducing effect of all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) on leukemic cells and introduction of differentiating therapy into clinical practice made a revolution in the treatment of OPL and led to an increase in 5-year complete remission rate to 85% [23] . The main complications of ATRA monotherapy is the development of drug resistance and the risk of severe side effect, so-called differentiation syndrome or retinoic acid syndrome. In some cases, a good clinical result can be achieved due to combination of ATRA with other drugs, such as arsenic trioxide and idarubicin [8, 10] . This combination therapy allows reducing the dose of ATRA and, consequently, the risk of complications and side effects associated with differential therapy.
