Recent data show that CF recipients of lung transplantation have survival as good as those of any other diagnostic group. After transplantation, CF patients confront the major threats to life and health of graft infection and rejection. Inflammation is the common mediator of injury to the lung in both these instances. Graft infection after lung transplantation involves the same micro-organisms as are typical with CF as well as opportunistic agents. Prophylactic strategies and aggressive diagnosis via bronchoscopy are both critical in the effective treatment of post-transplant lung infections. Graft rejection involves the detection and recognition of foreign antigen and the subsequent activation of specific T-lymphocyte clones leading to inflammatory injury to the donor organ. Immunosuppression is used to prevent and/or modulate host response to the donor organ and titrated to serum therapeutic drug monitoring and transbronchial biopsy findings. Precise clinical monitoring and aggressive diagnostic approaches are crucial to minimizing graft injury and enhancing life after transplantation. Although most CF lung transplant recipients experience both graft infection and rejection and the 5-yr survival rate remains at approx 50%, improvement in diagnosis and therapy continue over time. With the introduction of new approaches to antimicrobial therapy, new immunosuppressant agents and promising strategies to promote immune tolerance, survival after lung transplantation is likely to improve in the coming decades.",

            "text": "The major clinical problems that occur after lung transplantation, regardless of the organ or recipient, are allograft rejection and infection. The common denominator in these processes is inflammation of the graft. The lung appears to be particularly vulnerable to both allograft rejection and infection as compared to other transplanted organs ( Table 1 ). The lung is the most densely vascularized of the transplantable organs. It receives fully 50% of cardiac output, and has a vast vascular surface compared to the heart, liver, kidney, and small intestine. It is at the endothelial interface that alloantigen attack may take place, thus making the transplanted lung particularly vulnerable to injury. In addition, the lung has unique sizable loci for lymphocytes within its tissue borders, the bronchus-associated lung tissue (BALT). The BALT Table 1 Factors Responsible for the Exaggerated Vulnerability of the Lung after Transplantation Susceptibility to ischemic injury during surgery Large vascular surface area Transplantation of immunologically active cells within the graft (BALT) High density of professional antigen-presenting cells High-dose immunosuppression Anatomic exposure to aerosolized pathogens Blunting of cough reflex in a donor organ brings millions of donor lymphocytes into play in the hours and days after transplantation, theoretically making it much more difficult to camouflage the lung from host response than other transplanted organs. For these reasons, lung transplant patients receive higher doses of most immunosuppressant medications for longer duration than recipients of other solid-organ transplants. Furthermore, it may be that CF recipients who have a near maximal stimulation of the immune system from severe respiratory tract infection are more difficult to suppress after transplantation than other recipients who have not been subject to active and chronic infection. By anatomic design, the lung is exposed to many airborne potential pathogens on a continuing basis, increasing the relative risk of infection in lung transplant recipients compared to other solid-organ recipients. The most common community-acquired infection is respiratory in nature, particularly for children. The transplant surgery causes denervation of the airways, leading to a loss of the cough reflex. This is detrimental when inflammation and mucus accumulate in the central or distal airways. The higher dosing of immunosuppression also increases the vulnerability of the host to infection and severity of infection.",

Despite the development of sophisticated preservation solutions and techniques and the use of external and internal cooling, some degree of injury to the transplanted organ inevitably occurs after transplantation (6, 7) . Usually, endothelial and alveolar type I cell injury occurs (8) , leading to the expression of adhesion molecules that encourage the invasion of neutrophils and outflow of plasma into adjacent extravascular spaces. The clinical and histopathologic picture of ischemia-reperfusion injury, which occurs in 10-20% of transplant recipients, is indistinguishable from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with extravasation of plasma proteins, water and neutrophils into the interstitium and alveolar space. This elaboration of cytokines and inflammatory cells can lead to an enhanced vulnerability to rejection through tissue damage and increased mucus production, with decreased mucus clearance. In an animal model, investigators have shown an upregulation in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II antigen expression on endothelial and epithelial cells in the graft (9) . Further study showed an increased prevalence of acute rejection in those animals (10) . This theoretical and logical vulnerability to rejection has not been proven in humans.",

On biopsy, when the tissue samples reveal pathology, patients with BO have both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes infiltrating the airway wall (13) . Research has demonstrated that the predominant immune response to the donor airway-epithelial cells is expansion of the CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell line, which directs part of its tissue destruction at those same epithelial cells (18) . Furthermore, those T cells are specific for the HLA class I antigens on the epithelial cells. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid collected in individuals with BOS demonstrates chronic neutrophilia (19, 20) . Further evaluation of the airway environment in these patients shows persistent signs of oxidative stress with inadequate down-regulating mechanisms in play (21) . Myeloperoxidase activity and oxidized methionine residues are elevated, and levels of glutathione, an important antioxidant, are reduced in BOS patients. Lastly, there are growth factors secreted into the airway lumen, which may favor the laying down of collagen in a fibrotic and obliterative fashion. Both TGF-and insulinlike growth factor-1 (IGF-1) have been reported to be present in high amounts in patients with BO or BOS (22, 23) .",

Specific diagnosis requires histopathology because all these signs are nonspecific (Table 5 ). Serial spirometry is probably the most sensitive, commonly used test to suggest the possible presence of AGR in patients who are ambulatory after recovery from transplantation. Transbronchial biopsy with 6-12 biopsies from one or more lobes appears to be a sensitive method for diagnosis. Significant AGR is manifested by perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and the degree of rejection is judged on the basis of widely accepted criteria (11) . It has been reported that BAL fluid analysis of patients with AGR shows an increase in cellularity with a differential cell count showing 30-70% alveolar macrophages, 10-60% lymphocytes, and 15-30% neutrophils (24) . Unfortunately, there is such individual variation and overlap with patients with lower respiratory infection that BAL analysis alone cannot be used to diagnose AGR. Investigators have searched for a particular cytokine mix in blood or BAL fluid that might be more precise than simple cell counts. However, the same large inter-individual variation and overlap with patients with acute infection have thus far frustrated the use of these less invasive diagnostic methods for AGR.",

Major loss of small airways has certainly occurred before there has been a 20% loss of FEV1 from baseline. Investigators have been looking for earlier and still sensitive indicators of small airways disease. The early neutrophilia in BAL fluid seen in the first few weeks after transplantation usually resolves by 3-6 mo postoperatively. Patients who go on to have BOS have persistent BAL fluid neutrophilia (20) . Patients with established BO have a moderate elevation in cell counts, with a differential count of 40-70% alveolar macrophages, 10-30% lymphocytes and 20-30% neutrophils (24) . As with AGR, BAL cellular studies are not diagnostic of BO. A German group has reported that there appears to be elevated neutrophil activation factors such as myeloperoxidase and Il-8 as well as transforming growth Clinical Reviews in Allergy and Immunology Volume 23, 2002 factor (TGF-), and less antiprotease activity in BAL fluid in patients with BOS (25, 26) . At times, these changes are noted chemically prior to a drop in lung function. Another group in France has demonstrated the elevation of IGF-1 mRNA in BAL fluid months prior to lung-function changes indicative of BOS (23) . All of these cytokines and growth factors will need further study to prove their sensitivity and specificity. It has also been proposed that physiologic studies may predict BOS months before the spirometric changes are clear, thus presumably at an earlier stage in the process of chronic rejection. Nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity is often seen in lung transplant recipients prior to the point at which BOS criteria have been satisfied (27) . Even more exciting is the potential application of the technique of assessing ventilatory distribution by the simultaneous measurement of two inert gases.

There are some studies that suggest that the use of pulmonary vasodilators such as PGE1 may be effective in minimizing the severity of the lung injury in the immediate perioperative and postoperative periods. Hyperacute allograft rejection can be modulated by detection of circulating anti-HLA antibodies and the pre-emptive use of plasmapheresis in vulnerable patients.",

            "text": "Prevention of infection involves a detailed use of specific antimicrobial agents, as shown in Table 6 . The herpes family viruses, aspergillus, Pneumocystis carinii, and certain bacterial agents can be effectively prevented, modulated, or postponed by the current regimens outlined here. Active immunization is critically important. Among the standard vaccines, live vaccines, which include oral polio vaccine, measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, and varicella vaccine, are avoided. Influenza vaccine is indicated annually for life. Passive immunization against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) with palivizumab is often used in infants and young children. It is usually recommended that infants and young children be spared exposure to a daycare setting if at all possible. Prevention of AGR is difficult, but probably most important in terms of long-term survival. Matching of donor and recipient HLA, as performed in kidney transplantation, would be helpful, but the urgency with which thoracic organs must be implanted into the recipient effectively precludes HLA matching at the present time. The use of the freshest and healthiest of organs and selecting the most vibrant and young recipients would be logical, but practical and ethical considerations prevent these strategies from being implemented. The use of aggressive immunosuppression from the early hours after transplantation is important. The experience of excessive infectious and neoplastic complications from cytolytic therapy in many centers has led to its abandonment in the early induction phase of immunosuppression in many centers. In the USA, \"cytolytic\" agents include OKT3 and anti-lymphocyte globulin (ATGAM \u00ae ). In keeping with tradition, three immunosuppressant drugs are used in most programs to prevent rejection. The standard immunosuppressants used in 2001 in the United States are shown in Table 7 . Recently, some centers have introduced one of the new IL-2 receptor antagonists as an intravenous (iv) infusion just prior to transplantation, and then at scheduled intervals afterwards. These agents are daclizumab, a completely humanized mouse antibody, and basiliximab, a mostly humanized mouse preparation (30) . The efficacy of this approach awaits prospective study.",

More than 80% of patients will respond by clinical exam and lung function within 48 h. With repeated AGR episodes or steroid-resistant rejection, a change in the basic triple immunosuppressant regimen would be considered. Among the most straightforward options are maximizing doses of current immunosuppressants (if feasible), the change from cyclosporine (CSA) to tacrolimus (TAC) and/or the change of azathioprine to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Other employed options are a 6-wk course of once-weekly methotrexate at (0.15 to 0.25 mg/kg/wk), total lymphoid irradiation or photopheresis. Some physicians will employ cytolytic therapy in the form of OKT3 or another antilymphocyte globulin preparation over a 7-14-d course.

In the event of the recent drop in lung function, particularly with histologic evidence of lymphocytic infiltration around or within the airway, many centers choose to augment immunosuppression to seek some degree of reversal or stabilization of what often is a relentlessly progressive course. The pharmacologic options are similar to those outlined for repeated AGR with the more common addition of cytolytic therapy (Table 8 ). There are studies reporting partial success with cytolytic therapy (36) . In my own practice, cytolytic therapy with concurrent high-dose iv methylprednisolone has often been the initial therapeutic response, often followed by a change in maintenance immunosuppression.
