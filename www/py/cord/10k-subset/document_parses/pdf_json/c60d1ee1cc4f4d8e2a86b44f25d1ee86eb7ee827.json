The suckling infant's stomach has both gastric lipase and lingual lipase activities [13] , which can release fatty acids from milk triglycerides. It is likely that these enzymes are responsible for the release of milk antiviral lipids in the infant's stomach because there are no bile salts to activate BSSL and because LPL is inactivated in the stomach [14] . The enzymatic process of fatty acid release in the stomach is much more rapid than in stored milk, in which antiviral activity did not appear until after at least two days at 4 C.
