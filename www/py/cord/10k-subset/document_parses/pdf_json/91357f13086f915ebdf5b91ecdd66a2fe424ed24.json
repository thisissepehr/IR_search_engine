The hallmark of DRESS is the prolonged latency, with symptoms appearing after 2 to 6 weeks from the initial drug exposure [6] . The pathogenesis is not fully understood, but is thought to be related to immunosuppression upon drug hypersensitivity reaction, and an underlying viral infection, such as human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6).

He had a past medical history of type I diabetes, seizures, and hyperlipidemia. His home medications included atorvastatin, insulin, lamotrigine and pregabalin. He had allergy to cephalexin, with itchiness as the only allergic symptom. He also had a right calcaneus fracture with open reduction internal fixation, and he was recently diagnosed with osteomyelitis of the right calcaneus. He was started with parenteral vancomycin 3 weeks prior to admission. On physical exam at admission, he was noted to be febrile (102.6\u00b0F), with severe shortness of breath. There was no evidence of rash, renal injury, lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Chest x-ray in the emergency department (ED) revealed a mild left lower lobe airspace opacity (Fig. 1a) . He was placed on vancomycin and levofloxacin, and was admitted for possible community acquired pneumonia. At admission, his laboratory tests, however, were not suggestive of infection, with Leukocyte count 6700/mm 3 (Neutrophils: 72.1%, Lymphocytes: 15.4%, Monocytes: 7.9%, Eosinophils: 4%, Basophils: 0.6%), Absolute eosinophil count 270/uL (within normal range), Lactate 1.0, and with only mildly elevated C-reactive protein 3.4 (CRP) (0.0-1.0 mg/dL), and mildly elevated Sedimentation rate (SED) 20 (0-15 mm/h). Orthopedics was also consulted in the ED and determined that his osteomyelitis was controlled and localized, with no acute intervention needed. Hospital day 2-3: He developed ARDS with preintubation PaO2/FiO2 ratio 82 (100% FiO2) and postintubation PaO2/FiO2 ratio 109 (70% FiO2 and PEEP of 10 cm H20) (Fig. 1b) . He was placed on vancomycin, piperacillin -tazobactam and levofloxacin for possible sepsis. 10-20 ml bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was obtained via bronchoscopy and revealed serosanguineous fluid with 10-15 white blood cell per high power field and with no organisms identified. Polymerase chain reaction test was obtained via nasopharyngeal swab and was negative for Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus. Blood culture was negative for organisms. There was a questionable convulsion episode witnessed by the family and he was started on levetiracetam due to a history of seizure. An echocardiogram was performed and indicated normal cardiac function (ejection fraction 60%) and normal right ventricular diastolic pressure (36.8 mmHg) . Day 4-5: he developed new onset acute renal injury (AKI) and new morbilliform rash in bilateral hands and knees; vancomycin, piperacillin -tazobactam and levofloxacin were discontinued, and meropenem and daptomycin were started. Day 6-11: the rash progressed to the entire body (sparing face) and became indurated with associated edema (Fig. 1c, d) ; new onset eosinophilia occurred with a peak of 4000/uL; fever and leukocytosis persisted despite treatment with antibiotics. AKI workup indicated interstitial nephritis primarily based on positive urine eosinophil (7%), and negative autoimmune workup including Myeloperoxidase Antibody (<0.2), Proteinase 3 Antibody (<0.2), Antinuclear Antibody (negative), C3 complement 115 (77-166), and C4 complement 34 ; Urine protein to creatinine ratio was 0.66 (normal). Lumbar puncture and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain excluded bacterial meningitis, Cryptococcus, Varicella Zoster Virus, Herpes Simplex I/II and Toxoplasmosis. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no intra-abdominal infectious source. A skin biopsy showed perivascular lymphocytes, occasional neutrophils, scattered eosinophils, and the absence of intraluminal microthrombi (Fig. 1e, f ) . Day 12-14: patient continued to be in critical condition with persistent fever, leukocytosis and negative infection workup. The decision was made to treat as DRESS syndrome with a pulsed corticosteroid regimen, methylprednisolone 125 mg (approximately 1.25 mg/kg daily, body weight 99.3 kg) for 3 days. The patient responded well. He had resolution of the fever, and clinical improvement of ventilation. His renal function recovered in 2 days, and the diffuse rash was reduced to trace erythema in 5 days. The response to the corticosteroids is illustrated Fig. 2 in further details. He was treated with tapering oral prednisone for additional 2 weeks, and was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation facility, and then home.

Features of EGPA include elevated Antineutrophil Cytoplasm Antibody (ANCA) (30-70% cases), tissue eosinophilia in BAL fluid, and intraluminal microthrombi and fibrinoid necrosis in skin biopsy [14, 15] . The patient had negative ANCA, absence of eosinophils in the BAL fluid, and absence of intraluminal microthrombi in skin biopsy, making EGPA a less likely option. Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is another entity which overlaps with DRESS. Secondary HES has a broad range of causes including parasitic infection, allergy and drug reactions. DRESS is currently classified as a subtype of drug induced HES [16] . Alternatively, primary HES is a myeloproliferative disorder and involves neoplastic eosinophils with cytogenetic abnormalities [16] . The peripheral blood smear of the patient did not demonstrate any lymphoid or myeloid lineage dysplasia that may be suggestive of primary HES. Stevens Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SJS/TEN) is a spectrum of severe drug reaction and features epidermal necrosis with epidermis detachment of at least 10% of body surface [17] .
