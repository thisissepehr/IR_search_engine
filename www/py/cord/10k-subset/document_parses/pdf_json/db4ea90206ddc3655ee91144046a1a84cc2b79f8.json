Detailed understanding of such processes at a molecular level requires structural insights into large macromolecular assemblies consisting of many components such as proteins, RNA and DNA. Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy is a powerful method for threedimensional structure determination of macromolecular assemblies involved in these essential cellular processes. It is very often the only available technique to determine the 3D structure because of the challenges in purification of complexes in the amounts and quality required for X-ray crystallographic studies. In recent years it was shown in a number of publications that it is possible to obtain near-atomic resolution structures of large and rigid macromolecules such as icosahedral viruses. Due to a number of methodological advances there are now also great perspectives for high-resolution single particle cryo-EM studies of large and dynamic macromolecules. Successful high-resolution structure determination of dynamic complexes requires new biochemical purification strategies and protocols as well as state of the art electron microscopes and high-performance computing. In the future cryo-EM will thus be able to provide structures at near-atomic resolution and information about the dynamic behavior of macromolecules simultaneously.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Detection and rapid manipulation of phosphoinositides with engineered molecular tools Tamas Balla Section on Molecular Signal Transduction, Program for Developmental Neuroscience, NICHD, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA Polyphosphoinositides (PPIs) are ubiquitous lipid regulators of a variety of cellular processes serving as docking sites and conformational switches for a large number of signaling proteins. The localization and dynamic changes in PPIs in live cells have been followed with the use of protein domain GFP chimeras. In this presentation we will show experimental systems that allow rapid manipulation of the levels of PPIs in specific membrane compartments. We are also actively pursuing strategies that will allow us to map the distribution and possible functional diversity of the phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) pools within intact cells since they are the precursors of PPIs. We will show our most recent progress in addressing this question: the use of a PtdIns specific PLC enzyme isolated from Listeria monocytogenes together with a highly sensitive diacylglycerol sensor to determine the distribution and also to alter the level of PtdIns in living cells. These studies reveal that a significant metabolically highly active PtdIns pool exists associated with tiny mobile structures within the cytoplasm in addition to the known ER and PM PtdIns pools. We will show our most recent data on the consequences of PtdIns depletion within the various PtdIns pools on PPI production and on the morphology and functions of various organelles. The functionality of proteins is known to be intimately related to the motion of their constituents on the atomic/molecular level. The study of microscopic motion in complex matter is often reduced to the observation of some average mean square atomic displacement, a first, very partial characterization of the dynamics. The marked crossover in the temperature dependence of such quantities in hydrated proteins around 200 K, the so called ''dynamic transition'' has been originally observed a quarter of century ago. The origin, nature and the key characteristics of the atomic motions behind this remarkable evolution of the mean square displacement in proteins remained controversial over the past decades. Recent analysis of M\u00f6 ssbauer, dielectric relaxation and neutron scattering spectroscopic data provide unambiguous evidence that this phenomenon is caused by the temperature dependence of a relaxation process spread over several orders of magnitude in the time domain, similarly to the b relaxation process observed in glasses. The review and critical analysis of the available data highlights the inherent ambiguities of commonly used data fitting approaches. Emerging evidence from model independent observations tend to exclude some of the proposed mechanisms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O-004"}, {"text": "Microbial Rhodopsins: light-gated ion channels and pumps as optogenetic tools in neuro-and cell biology E.

Their embodiment departs completely from the conventional flat p-n junction solid-state cells, replacing them by interpenetrating networks. This lecture focuses on dye sensitized mesoscopic solar cells (DSCs), which have been developed in our laboratory. Imitating natural photosynthesis, this cell is the only photovoltaic device that uses a molecular chromophore to generate electric charges from sunlight and that accomplishes the separation of the optical absorption from the charge separation and carrier transport processes. It does so by associating the molecular dye with a film constituted of tiny particles of the white pigment titanium dioxide. The DSC has made phenomenal progress, present conversion efficiencies being over 12 percent for single junction and 16 percent for tandem cells, rendering the DSC a credible alternative to conventional p-n junction devices.

Fluorescence Spectrofluorometer, UV-vis spectrophotometer, Three-dimensional fluorescence and a home-built EMF generator apparatuses were used. Results: Results obtained from this study indicated that NRF has a strong ability to quench HSA in 280 nm. In addition, there was a slight blue shift, which suggested that the microenvironment of protein became more hydrophobic after addition of NRF. Moreover, synchronous fluorescence demonstrated that the microenvironment around Tyrosine (Tyr) had a trivial increase. These, and the results of HSA-NRF in the presence of EMF with 1 KHz, illustrates the same results inferred from quenching and blue shift.

Flavonoids are a large class of naturally occurring polyphenols widely distributed in plants. Rutin (quercetin-3-rutinoside) is the glycoside between flavonoids quercetin and disaccharide rutinose. Like other flavonoids, rutin displays anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. The interaction between HSA and rutin was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy, ab initio and molecular modeling calculations. Fluorescence titration was performed by keeping the HSA concentration (4 lM) constant and stoichiometrically varying the rutin concentration (1-4 lM) . The emission spectra were obtained in the range of 305 to 500nm, with the excitation wavelength at 295nm. The obtained fluorescence data were corrected for background fluorescence and for inner filter effects. The Stern-Volmer quenching constant values were 3.722 9 10 5 and 1.868 9 10 5 M -1 at 298 and 303 K, respectively. From the modified Stern-Volmer association constants 2.285 9 10 5 (at 298 K) and 2.081 9 10 5 M -1 (at 303 K) were calculated the thermodynamic parameters DH = 14.048 KJ mol -1 , DG 298K = -30.557 KJ mol -1 and DG 303 K = -30.834 KJ mol -1 , and DS = 55.4 KJ mol -1 K -1 .

The efficient quenching of the Trp214 fluorescence by rutin indicates that the binding site for the flavonoid is situated within subdomain IIA of HSA. The distance r = 2.397 nm between the donor (HSA) and the acceptor (Rutin) was obtained according to fluorescence resonance energy transference (FRET). Wavelength shifts in synchronous fluorescence spectra showed the conformation of HSA molecules is changed in the presence of rutin. The structure of rutin utilized in molecular modeling calculation was obtained by Gaussian 98 program. The optimization geometry of rutin was performed in its ground states by using ab initio DFT/B3LYP functional with 6-31G(d,p) basis set used in calculations. The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) was calculated to provide the molecular charge distribution of rutin. The gap energy value between the HOMO and LUMO of the rutin molecule was about 4.22 eV which indicates that rutin is classified as a reactive molecule.

We found that the fluorescence quenching observed at high expression level in the cell cytoplasm and the fluorescence depolarization measured at high concentration in vitro are insensitive to the A206K mutation, shown to dissociate other GFP dimers. Both phenomena are satisfactorily accounted for by a model of non-specific homo-FRET between CFP monomers due to molecular proximity. Modeling the expected contributions to fluorescence depolarization of rotational diffusion, homo-FRET within a hypothetical dimer and proximity homo-FRET shows that CFP has a homo-affinity at least 30 times lower than GFP. This difference is due to an intrinsic mutation of CFP (N146I), originally introduced to increase its brightness and that by chance also disrupts the dimers. Biomolecular recognition typically proceeds in an aqueous environment, where hydration shells are a constitutive part of the interacting species. The coupling of hydration shell structure to conformation is particularly pronounced for DNA with its large surface to volume ratio. Conformational substates of the phosphodiester backbone in B-DNA contribute to DNA flexibility and are strongly dependent on hydration. We have studied by rapid scan FTIR spectroscopy the isothermal B I -B II transition on its intrinsic time scale of seconds. Correlation analysis of IR absorption changes induced by an incremental growth of the DNA hydration shell identifies water populations w 1 (PO 2 --bound) and w 2 (non-PO 2 --bound) exhibiting weaker and stronger H-bonds, respectively, than those in bulk water. The B II substate is stabilized by w 2 . The water H-bond imbalance of 3-4 kJ mol -1 is equalized at little enthalpic cost upon formation of a contiguous water network (at 12-14 H 2 O molecules per DNA phosphate) of reduced !(OH) band width. In this state, hydration water cooperatively stabilizes the B I conformer via the entropically favored replacement of w 2 -DNA interactions by additional w 2 -water contacts, rather than binding to B I -specific hydration sites. Such water rearrangements contribute to the recognition of DNA by indolicidin, an antimicrobial 13-mer peptide from bovine neutrophils which, despite little intrinsic structure, preferentially binds to the B I conformer in a water-mediated induced fit.

Here, we use isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to characterize the thermodynamic binding signature of potential TTR tetramer stabilizers, previously predicted by computerassisted methods [3] . ITC allows the measurement of the magnitude of the binding affinity, but also affords the characterization of the thermodynamic binding profile of a protein-ligand interaction.

To achieve this purpose, two fluorescent probes with different bilayer location, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) distributing in membrane hydrocarbon core and 6-lauroyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (Laurdan) locating at lipid-water interface, have been employed.

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is the gold standard for the quantitative characterisation of protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions. However, reliable determination of the dissociation constant (K D ) is typically limited to the range 100 lM [ K D [ 1 nm. Nevertheless, interactions characterised by a higher or lower K D can be assessed indirectly, provided that a suitable competitive ligand is available whose K D falls within the directly accessible window. Unfortunately, the established competitive ITC assay requires that the high-affinity ligand be soluble at high concentrations in aqueous buffer containing only minimal amounts of organic solvent. This poses serious problems when studying protein binding of small-molecule ligands taken from compound libraries dissolved in organic solvents, as is usually the case during screening or drug development.

Every year over 50 million people are infected with dengue virus (DENV), transmitted by a mosquito (Aedes aegypti). This enveloped virus, member of the Flaviviridae family, has four distinct serotypes. It has a single stranded positive RNA molecule with a single open reading frame that encodes a single poliprotein, which, after appropriate processing by viral and host proteases, gives rise to three structural proteins (C, prM and E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) [1] . The surface of the immature virion is composed of E and prM heterodimers that are arranged as trimers protruding from the membrane [2] . The virus is thought to enter the host cell via a receptor-mediated endocytosis, although, if any, the specific dengue receptors have not been described. Once inside the cell, the acidified environment inside the endocytic vesicle triggers an irreversible trimerization of the envelope (E) protein, inducing the release of the nucleocapsid (composed of viral RNA and multiple copies of C protein) to the cytoplasm, thus starting the infection process, where the poliprotein is translated and processed, originating all viral proteins. Considering the structural proteins C and E, these are essential for the viral infection, specifically, protein C is thought to be involved in the viral assembly and specific encapsidation of the genome and protein E (a class II fusion protein) plays a major role in the fusion process. As recently described by some studies [3] , protein C is composed of four a helices connected by four short loops and has a highly hydrophobic region forming a concave groove that could interact with lipid membranes and a region with an increased concentration of positive charges, possibly interacting with the viral RNA. As for protein E, it is composed of three b stranded domains. It is proposed that the fusion loop is located in domain II of this protein and the putative receptor binding sites, considered essential for the viral entry, are supposedly located in domain III. In this work, we describe the identification of the membrane active regions of both these proteins, considering both theoretical studies, hydrophobic moments, hydrophobicity and interfaciality values as well as experimental ones, namely fluorescence spectroscopy, where a fluorescent probe is encapsulated in model membrane systems, and differential scanning calorimetry [4] .

We have exploited the high spatial resolution given by Atomic Force Microscopy to generate DNA arrays of variable density by means of Nanografting. On such nanostructures, we investigate the mechanism of different enzymatic reactions (from restriction enzymes to helicases). Registering with high precision the height variation due to the action of the enzyme onto the engineered DNA sequences (in the case of restriction enzymes) or taking advantage of the different mechanical properties of single and double stranded DNA (in the case of helicases, where for the first time kinetic data were obtained on RecQ1 human helicase), we were able to monitor either the activity and/or the action mechanisms of these two important classes of enzymes. In this study an attempt has been made to investigate the structure, dynamics and stability of cyclic peptide nanotubes (CPNTs) formed by the self-assembly of cyclic peptides (CPs) using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and semiempirical quantum chemistry calculation employing PM6. The structure and energetics of monomer and various oligomeric CPNTs have been investigated by considering the (cyclo-[(D-Ala-L-Ala) 4 ]) peptide as the model for CP. Various geometrical parameters extracted from the MD simulation reveal that the terminal residues are loosely hydrogen bonded to the inner subunits regardless of degree of oligomerization. The hydrogen bonds present in the inner core regions are stronger than the terminal residues. As the degree of oligomerization increases, the stability of the tube increases due to the hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions between the subunits. The results show that the binding free energy increases with the extent of oligomerization and reaches saturation beyond CPNT5. In addition, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions play crucial roles in the formation of CPNTs. Analysis of both structural and energetics of formation of CPNTs unveils that the selfassembly of dimer, trimer and tetramer CPNTs are the essential steps in the growth of CNPTs.

In this work, uv-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to study the ability of different micelles for dispersing zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc). The following surfactants were tested: SDS, CTAB, HPS, Tween 80, Tween 20, and Pluronic F127. ZnPc has low solubility in virtually all solvents, but DMF and DMSO are observed to dissolve ZnPc in concentrations of the order of 0.9 and 0.2 mmol/L, respectively. Stock solutions of ZnPc in DMF and DMSO were prepared. Micelles of the different surfactants containing ZnPc were prepared by dissolving in aqueous medium (milli-Q water or phosphate buffer pH 7.4) small amounts of the stock solutions previously mixed with each surfactant. The amounts of each surfactant were calculated to give an average ratio of one ZnPc molecule per micelle in the final solution. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of ZnPc in the micellar systems were obtained, and were observed to change in time. Immediately after dissolution the spectra are characteristic of monomeric ZnPc, suggesting formation ZnPccontaining nanoemulsions with the mixture of ZnPc-organic solvent in the hydrophobic region of the micelle. Since DMSO and DMF are miscible with water, the solvent diffuses out of the micelle and ZnPc stays inside the micelle in a monomeric or aggregated form.

The findings of this research strongly encourage further efforts in the field of the use of nucleopeptides as supramolecular assembling systems and open the way to novel drug delivery approaches based on nucleobase recognition. conformational plasticity. Their structure depends tremendously on their local environment and confinment, and may accommodate several unrelated conformations, that are a strong challenge for the traditional characterizations of structure, supramolecular assembly and biorecognition phenomena. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) has been successfully exploited for both highly controllable nanolithography of biomolecules and for biorecognition studies, such as oriented prion protein -antibody interaction (Sanavio et al., ACS Nano (2010) 4(11): 6607, Bano et al. Nano Lett (2009) 9(7): 2614-8). Here, we report different strategies for selective, oriented confinement of alphasynuclein at the nanoscale for sensitive and accurate direct detection, via precise topographic measurements on ultraflat surfaces, of biomolecular interactions in confined assemblies. A new class of cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) was generated by splicing the (1-9) and (38-42) segments of crotamine, a toxin from Crotalus durissus terrificus venom [1] . As they localize preferably on the nucleolus, these novel CPPs were named nucleolar-targeting peptides (NrTPs). The extent of NrTP partition to zwitterionic (POPC; POPC:cholesterol 67:33) and anionic (POPG; POPC:POPG 70:30) lipid vesicles was studied following the intrinsic Tyr or Trp fluorescence of the peptides. The partition curves into POPC zwitterionic vesicles were characterized by downward slopes and higher partition coefficients (K p *10 4 -10 5 ). For pure POPG, an upward curve and smaller partition coefficient point out for a different type of membrane-peptide interaction. POPC:POPG membranes present characteristics of both types of interaction. From red edge excitation shift and quenching experiments similar conclusions were attained. Leakage assays ruled out lipid vesicle disruption by crotamine or NrTPs. Further studies on NrTP cellular translocation mechanism and large molecule delivery are currently in progress. Dystrophin is essential to skeletal muscle function and confers resistance to the sarcolemma by interacting with cytoskeleton and membrane. We characterized the behaviour of DYS R11-15, a five spectrin-like repeats from the central domain of human dystrophin, in the presence of liposomes and monolayers as membrane models. Interaction of DYS R11-15 depends on the lipid nature, anionic or zwitterionic, with SUVs, and on the lipid packing when comparing LUVs to SUVs. Lateral pressure of lipid monolayers modifies the protein organization and leads DYS R11-15 to form a regular network as revealed by AFM. Trypsin proteolysis assays show that the protein conformation is modified following its binding to monolayer and SUVs. Label free quantification by Nano-LC/MS-MS allowed identifying the helical amino acid sequences in repeats 12 and 13 that are involved in the interaction with anionic SUVs. Results indicate that DYS R11-15 constitutes a part of dystrophin that interacts with anionic as well as zwitterionic lipids and adapts its interaction and organization depending on lipid-packing and lipid nature. We provide here strong experimental evidence for a physiological role of the central domain of dystrophin on sarcolemma scaffolding through modulation of lipid-protein interactions. extracellular matrix proteins. Overexpression of the MMPs has been associated with a variety of diseases ranging from periodontal disease and arthritis to tumor invasion and metastasis. The majority of the more powerful synthetic inhibitors of MMPs incorporate a hydroxamate group, but exhibit low selectivity and are toxic. In a recent modeling study, Astaxanthin (AST), a carotenoid with potent antioxidant property, has been shown to be a potential inhibitor of MMP-13 function by occupying a binding site near the active center of the enzyme (Bika 0 di et al. 2006). In our ongoing project, we investigate the binding of AST to the catalytic domain of MMPs using biochemical and ultimately crystallization to validate the proposed action of AST. Along these lines, the catalytic domain of MMP-13 (cdMMP-13) was expressed in E.coli BL21(DE3) Codon-Plus and refolded using a novel effective refolding method. Our results reveal that AST has a potent inhibitory effect on cdMMP-13 activity, however, determination of IC 50% or K i is difficult due to fast oxidation and structural instability of AST. Ongoing work aims at optimizing the inhibition conditions and improving the refolding yield to allow analyzing structure and function of the AST-bound MMP-13 in more detail. Hyaluronic acid (Hyaluronan, HA) is a linear polysaccharide with a molar mass in the range of 10 5 to 10 7 Da and is built from alternating units of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine. Synthesized in the cellular plasma membrane, it is a network-forming and space-filling component in the extracellular matrix of animal tissues. Here, we create hyaluronic acid films atop a porous alumina substrate, where they act as a barrier for macromolecular transport depending on their length and geometry. The geometry of the hyaluronic acid switches between a fully stretched and a mushroomlike state and is dependent on the concentration of hyaluronic acid. To bind hyaluronic acid selectively atop the nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO), the AAO is orthogonally functionalized by silane chemistry. By means of time resolved optical waveguide spectroscopy (OWS) the transport of macromolecules, e.g. avidin, across the hyaluronic acid barriers can be recorded as a function of the pore diameter and hyaluronic acid concentration in a time resolved and label free manner. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) provides an alternative method to investigate the orthogonal functionalization of the pores and to elucidate whether a molecule can cross the barrier at the pore entrance. We functionalized gold surfaces with a hydroxy-terminated self-assembled thiol monolayer exposing an adjustable fraction of biotin moieties. [1] By in-situ acetylation or fluorination, surface properties could be fine-tuned to different protein immobilization scenarios. Using streptavidin as a linker protein, immobilization of human ABCC3 [2] in liposomal and planar bilayer systems was possible. ABCC3-containing proteoliposomes doped with a biotinylated anchor lipid were successfully tethered to our streptavidin-coated surfaces. Biotinylation of the extracellular glycosylation of ABCC3 allowed direct immobilization with inside-up orientation and subsequent assembly of a lipid bilayer. Outside-up orientation was achieved by exploiting the C-terminal histidin tag of recombinant ABCC3 for immobilization via Ni 2+ and biotinnitrilotriacetate. All systems were thoroughly characterized by quartz crystal microbalance, atomic force microscopy and surface plasmon resonance techniques with respect to monitoring ABCC3mediated substrate transport in real time.

SDS In countries where seafood is an integrate part of the diet, fish are among the most common food allergen sources. The major fish allergen parvalbumins are abundant in the white muscle of many fish species. Parvalbumin belongs to the family of EF-hand proteins and has a globular shape containing six helical parts. High pressure is known to unfold proteins. We performed high pressure FTIR experiments, to explore the p-T phase diagram of cod parvalbumin, Gad m 1, to test the possibility of its inactivation by high pressure treatment. The infrared spectrum of parvalbumin is characteristic for the helical conformation, in agreement with the crystal structure. A marked transition in the structure of the parvalbumin was observed with the central point of 0.5 GPa (at room temperature). The amide I position shifts to a wavenumber which is between the helical and the unfolded position. We assign this change to a native-molten globule transition.

The first installation enables direct detection and quantification of the interaction of membrane proteins with solid supported lipid bilayers. In the second assembly the original instrument is combined with an upright fluorescence microscope. The advantages of this installation are the direct optical control of the experiment as well as a smaller sensing area. The set-up allows for the detection of interactions on lipid-patches of just several micrometers in diameter. The aim of this work is an experimental system that enables the measurement of transport processes through lipid membranes. We attempt to achieve this by covering a closed porous substrate with a lipid membrane. The first steps to reach this goal were done by spanning membranes over anodized aluminum oxide substrates. Initiation of actin polimerization in cells requires nucleation factors. A pointed-end-binding protein of F-actin -the lei-omodin2-acts as a strong filament nucleator in muscle cells. The dynamical, structural and kinetic properties of a protein can provide important information to understand the intramolecular events underlying its function. We are interested in how does the leiomodin2 regulate the actin polimerization. Our aim is to determine the dissociation constant of the actin-leiomodin2 complex, and study a possible side-binding effect of the leiomodin2. The cardiac leiomodin2 of Rattus norvegicus is a 50 kDa molecular weight protein, which contains a 17 kDa N-terminal, a 18 kDa leucin reach repeat (LRR) and a 15 kDa C-terminal region. The N-term and the LRR regions are together tropomodulin homologues. We expressed the wild type the N-term+LRR the LRR+C-term and the C-term protein fragments by using a pTyB1 vector that contains an amplicillin resistance gene. The expression of the proteins was carried out with the Twin-CN (NE Bio-Labs) kit, which is a chitin-intein self-cleavage and purification system. The nucleation activity of leiomodin and the polimerization speed of actin in the presence of tropomyosin and leiomodin were studied by using pyrene-actin polimerization assay. We measured the stoichiometric, conformational and kinetic properties of the leiomodin-actin complexes with co-sedimentation assay, fluorescence spectroscopic and rapid-kinetic methods. The results showed that the rate of actin polimerization depended on the leiomodin2 concentration. The nucleator activity of leiomo-din2 was ionic strength dependent. The data also confirmed that leiomodin2 is a side-binding and pointed-end binding protein of F-actin. The binding of leiomodin2 to the sides of the actin filaments was slower than to the pointed-end of the F-actin. The structure of F-actin was changed by the sidebound leiomodin2. These observations will contribute to the better understanding of the development and function of thin filaments in cardiac and other muscle tissues. Leukemias are one of the most common malignancy worldwide. There is a substantial need for new chemotherapeutic drugs effective against these diseases. Doxorubicin (DOX), used for treatment of leukemias and solid tumors is poorly efficacious when administered systemically at conventional doses. Therefore, in our study, to overcome these limitations, we used transferrin (TRF) as a drug carrier. We compared the effect of DOX and doxorubicin-transferrin conjugate (DOX-TRF) on human leukemic lymphoblasts (CCRF-CEM). The in vitro growth-inhibition test, XTT assay, indicated that DOX-TRF was more cytotoxic for leukemia cells than DOX alone. In our researches we also evaluated the alternations of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DW m) , and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We monitored the DW m using dye JC-1 (5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine) . The level of ROS was studied using the fluorescent probe DCFH 2 -DA (2', 7'dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate). The results demonstrate that DOX-TRF induced, decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and significantly higher production of ROS compared with DOX treated cells. Moreover, all these results seem to be correlated with DNA fragmentation analyzed by DNA ladder. The tested processes were partially inhibited by the antioxidant, N -acetylocysteine (NAC). The changes induced by DOX-TRF conjugate and free drug were suggest the different mechanism of action of DOX alone and conjugated with transferrin.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-082"}, {"text": "Time-resolved detection of protein-protein interaction Masahide Terazima Kyoto University, Kyoto, 606-8502, Japan", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O-096"}, {"text": "Revealing molecular mechanism of a protein reaction has been a central issue in biophysics.

DNA binding of porphyrins, and their peptide conjugates was investigated with comprehensive spectroscopic methods.

The peptide moiety does not oppose the interaction between the DNA and cationic porphyrins. We compared the effect of complexation on structural stability of DNA and nucleoprotein complex : HeLa nucleosomes and T7 phage.

The wide nucleotide specificity of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) allows its contribution to the effective phosphorylation (activation) of nucleotide-based pro-drugs against HIV. Here the structural basis of the nucleotide-PGK interaction is characterised in comparison to other kinases, namely pyruvate kinase (PK) and creatine kinase (CK) by enzyme kinetic and structural modelling studies. The results evidenced favouring the purine vs. pyrimidine base containing nucleotides for PGK rather than for PK or CK. This is due to the exceptional ability of PGK in forming the hydrophobic contacts of the nucleotide rings that assures the appropriate positioning of the connected phosphate chain for catalysis. The unnatural L-configurations of the nucleotides (both purine and pyrimidine) are better accepted by PGK than either by PK or CK. Further, for the L-forms the absence of the ribose OH-groups with PGK is better tolerated for the nucleotides with purine rather than pyrimidine base. On the other hand, positioning the phosphate chain of both purines and pyrimidines with L-configuration is even more important for PGK, as deduced from the kinetic studies with various nucleotide-site mutants. These characteristics of the kinase-nucleotide interactions can provide a guideline in drug-design.

Protein ligand binding is an important field of biopharmaceutical research. There are many techniques for quantitative determination of the ligand binding.

We previously demonstrated optogenetic monitoring of electrical activity in isolated cells, brain slices and living animals using voltage-sensitive fluorescent proteins (VSFPs) generated by fusing fluorescent proteins with a membrane-integrated voltage sensor domain. However, several properties of these voltage reporters remained suboptimal, limiting the spatiotemporal resolution of VSFPbased voltage imaging. A major limitation of VSFPs had been a reduced signal-to-noise ratio arising from intracellular aggregation and poor membrane targeting upon long-term expression in vivo. To address this limitation, we generated a series of enhanced genetically-encoded sensors for membrane voltage (named VSFP-Butterflies) based on a novel molecular design that combines the advantageous features of VSFP2s and VSFP3s with molecular trafficking strategies. The new sensors exhibit faster response kinetics at subthreshold membrane potentials and enhanced localization to neuronal plasma membranes after long-term expression in vivo, enabling the optical recording of action potentials from individual neurons in single sweeps. VSFP-Butterflies provide optical readouts of population activity such as sensoryevoked responses and neocortical slow-wave oscillations with signal amplitudes exceeding 1% DR/R 0 in anesthetized mice. VSFP-Butterflies will empower optogenetic electrophysiology by enabling new type of experiments bridging cellular and systems neuroscience and illuminating the function of neural circuits across multiple scales. Opsin molecules are a burgeoning new tool for temporally precise neuronal stimulation or inhibition. Opsin properties are commonly characterized in cell culture or acute brain slice preparations using whole cell patch clamp techniques, where neuronal membrane voltage is fixed at the resting potential. However, in vivo, where neurons are firing action potentials, opsins are exposed to large fluctuations in membrane voltage and transmembrane ionic concentrations which can influence opsin function. In the case of implanted light delivery devices, stimulation light power varies as a function of brain tissue volume. We therefore investigated the stability of opsin properties across a variety of in vivo-like stimulation conditions. We find that off-kinetics of excitatory opsins vary significantly with holding membrane potential; channelrhodopsin (ChR2) slowing with depolarisation and ChIEF (ChR1/ChR2 hybrid) in contrast, accelerating. New ChR2 point mutation variants demonstrate stability across all membrane potentials. We additionally explore responses to initial and subsequent light pulses and find that ChIEF has the unique property of accelerating kinetics after the first light stimulation. Inhibitory opsins vary in sensitivity to light in a manner which correlates with their off-kinetics. Slower opsins, such as Mac (Leptosphaeria maculans), have higher sensitivity at low light power densities, saturating early relative to fast inhibitory opsins such as Arch (archaeorhodopsin) and NpHR (halorhodopsin). We discuss the relative merits of stability versus versatility of opsins under variable stimulation conditions. It has been previously shown that overexpression of NDM29 ncRNA in a SKNBE2-derived neuroblastoma (NB) cell line leads to cell differentiation, with a decrease of malignant potential. Here we use the patch-recording technique to characterize the ionic channel apparatus of NB cells expressing NDM29 at its basal level (Mock cells) or at 5.4 fold higher levels (S1 cells). The two cell lines shared very similar pools of functional K channels, but S1 cells displayed larger TTX-sensitive Na currents and were able to generate action potentials, while Mock cells were not. In addition, while Mock cells barely express functional GABA receptors, in the majority of S1 rapid application of GABA elicited a current with a EC 50 =11.4 lM; this current was antagonized by bicuculline (10 lM) and potentiated by zaleplon (EC 50 = 35 nm). In Mock cells, real time PCR evidenced a high level of GABA A a 3 subunit, while in S1 cells a significant expression of a 1 and a 4 was detected, whereas a 3 mRNA was downregulated by 70%, confirming the development of functional GABA A receptors.

Iron is important element used for chemical reaction catalysis and physiological cell functions. The reason of iron deposition is still unknown. Under conditions prevailing in human brain it is expected the formation of an amorphous or minute crystalline phase. We used light, scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive microanalysis, electron diffraction and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) for investigation of iron deposits in globus pallidus of human brain. SEM revealed iron rich particles with Na, Si, P, S, Cl, Ca and Cu around glial cells. TEM revealed bumpy, solid particles of platy and sometimes rounded shape with the size of 2 lm to 6 lm. These ones were identified as hematite. EPR measurements showed the presence of Fe(III) and Cu(II), but little amount of Fe(II) can not be excluded. We consider low-temperature process of hematite formation in human globus pallidus in aqueous environment influenced by organic and inorganic factors. Chemical processes leading to nanoparticles formation can be associated with neurodegenerations such as Alzheimer or Parkinson disease. Over the past 50 years our understanding of the basic biophysical mechanisms governing the spatio-temporal dynamics of neuronal membrane potentials and synaptic efficacies has significantly expanded and improved. Much research has focussed on how ionic currents contribute to the generation and propagation of action potentials, how subthreshold signals propagate along dendritic trees, how the active properties of dendrites shape the integration of incoming signals in a neuron, and how pre-and postsynaptic activities \u00e2 and potential heterosynaptic effects a determine the way synaptic efficacies change on the short-and long-term. Yet, despite these advances, there have been no systematic efforts to relate the basic dynamical repertoire of neurons to the computational challenges neural circuits face, and in particular to explain systematically how the biophysical properties of neurons are adapted to process information efficiently under the constraints of noise and uncertainty in the nervous system. As an initial step in this direction, I will show how various biophysical properties of neurons, in particular short-term synaptic plasticity and dendritic non-linearities, can be seen as adaptations to resolve an important bottleneck in neuronal information processing: the loss of information entailed by the conversion of analogue membrane potentials to digital spike trains. The optogenetic toolbox has greatly expanded since the first demonstration of genetically-targeted optical manipulation of neural activity. In addition to the cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), the panel of excitatory opsins now includes an array of ChR2 variants with mutations in critical residues, in addition to other, related cation channels, and channel hybrids. The inhibitory opsin panel has similarly expanded beyond the first-described halorhodopsin (NpHR), a chloride pump, to include trafficking-enhanced versions of NpHR as well as the proton pumps Mac and Arch. While the expansion of available opsins offers researchers an increasingly powerful and diverse selection of tools, it has also made it increasingly difficult to select the optimal tool for a given experiment. One cannot extract a comparison of opsins from the current literature, since studies differ across multiple variables known to contribute to opsin performance (e.g. expression method, light power density, stimulation protocols, etc.). Here, we provide the first empirical comparison of both excitatory and inhibitory opsins under standardized conditions.

In vitro electrophysiological and imaging studies have demonstrated that dendritic Nav channels support active backpropagation of APs into the dendrites, but the subunit composition of these channels remained elusive. Here, I will present evidence for the somato-dendritic location of Nav channels in hippocampal pyramidal cells (PCs). Using a highly sensitive electron microscopic immunogold localization technique, we revealed the presence of the Nav1.6 subunit in PC proximal and distal dendrites, where their density is 40-fold lower than that found in AISs. A gradual decrease in Nav1.6 density along the proximo-distal axis of the dendritic tree was also detected. We have also investigated the subcellular distribution of Kv4.2 voltage-gated K + channel subunit and found a somato-dendritic localization. In contrast to that of Nav1.6 channels, the density of Kv4.2 first increases then decreases as a function of distance from the somata of PCs. Such subcellular compartment-specific distribution of voltage-gated ion channels increases the computational power of nerve cells. Keywords: Memory, extra cellular matrix, random walk We expose first a biological model of memory based on one hand of the mechanical oscillations of axons during action potential and on the other hand on the changes in the extra cellular matrix composition when a mechanical strain is applied on it. Due to these changes, the stiffness of the extra cellular matrix along the most excited neurons will increase close to these neurons due to the growth of astrocytes around them and to the elastoplastic behavior of collagen. This will create preferential paths linked to a memory effect. In a second part, we expose a physical model based on random walk of the action potential on the array composed of dendrites and axons. This last model shows that repetition of the same event leads to long time memory of this event and that paradoxical sleep leads to the linking of different events put into memory. Myelinated nerve fibres were studied with fluorescent microscopy and laser interference microscopy. Ca 2+ redistribution during prolonged stimulation, changes in morphology and rearrangement of cytoplasmic structures were compared in normal conditions and after membrane modification by lysolecithin and methyl-b-cyclodextrin. Lysolecithin is a detergent known to provoke demyelination, and methyl-b-cyclodextrin extracts cholesterol from membranes. Cholesterol extraction could lead to disruption of membrane caveolae-like microdomains or ''rafts'' and solubilisation of different proteins connected to them. Our data suggest that methyl-b-cyclodextrin and lysolecithin lead to different changes in morphology and distribution of cytoplasmic structures.

Prolonged depolarisation of skeletal muscle cells induces entry of extracellular calcium into muscle cells, an event referred to as excitation-coupled calcium entry.

This can be one out of several factors that affect the viability of organisms undergoing desiccation. Many organisms, however, are resistant to even extreme water loss. Some of them synthesize trehalose which has been shown to be associated with survival of desiccation in phylogenetically diverse organisms (yeast, nematodes, brine shrimp, insect larvae, resurrection plants, and others). Here we have studied hydration sensitive transitions in model lipids to determine the effect of trehalose and electrostatics on lipid order. Hydration pulse-induced time-resolved Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy was used to address hydration-dependent lipid structure as a function of trehalose. In combination with differential scanning calorimetry and studies of Langmuir-Blodget films we arrive at a structural and energetically consistent picture of how trehalose can affects lipidic phase behaviour and support a native lipid structure under water loss.

We have developed lipid-like probes carrying multivalent nitrilotriacetic acid (tris-NTA) head groups for selective targeting of Histagged proteins into liquid ordered or liquid disordered phases. In giant unilamellar vesicles strong partitioning of tris-NTA lipids into different lipid phases was observed. For a saturated tris-NTA lipid, at least 10-fold preference for the liquid ordered phase was found. In contrast, an unsaturated NTA lipid shows a comparable preference for the liquid disordered phase. Partitioning into submicroscopic membrane domains formed in solid supported membranes was confirmed by superresolution imaging. Single molecule tracking of His-tagged proteins tethered to solid supported membranes revealed clear differences in the diffusion behavior of the different NTA-lipids. By using BSA as a carrier, multivalent NTA lipids were efficiently incorporated into the plasma membrane of live cells. Based on this approach, we established versatile methods for probing and manipulating the spatiotemporal dynamics of membrane nano domains in live cells. IL-9 is a multifunctional cytokine with pleiotropic effects on T cells. The IL-9R consists of the cytokine-specific a-subunit and the c c -chain shared with other cytokines, including IL-2 and -15, important regulators of T cells. We have previously shown the preassembly of the heterotrimeric IL-2 and IL-15R, as well as their participation in common superclusters with MHC glycoproteins in lipid rafts of human T lymphoma cells. Integrity of lipid rafts was shown to be important in IL-2 signaling. We could hypothesize that other members of the c c cytokine receptor family, such as the IL-9R complex, may also fulfill their tasks in a similar environment, maybe in the same superclusters. Co-localization of IL-9R with lipid rafts as well as with the IL-2R/MHC superclusters was determined by CLSM. Molecular scale interactions of IL-9Ra with IL-2R and MHC molecules were determined by microscopic and flow cytometric FRET experiments. The role of lipid rafts in IL-9R signaling was assessed by following the effect of cholesterol depletion on IL-9 induced STAT phosphorylation. Our results suggest the possibility that preassembly of the receptor complexes in common membrane microdomains with MHC glycoproteins may be a general property of c c cytokines in T cells. To unravel the molecular processes leading to Fas clustering in lipid rafts, a 21-mer peptide corresponding to the single transmembrane domain of the death receptor was reconstituted into model membranes that display liquid-disordered/ liquid-ordered phase coexistence, i.e. mimicking cells plasma membranes. Using the intrinsic fluorescence of the peptide two tryptophans residues (Trp 176 and Trp 189 ), Fas membrane lateral organization, conformation and dynamics was studied by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence techniques. Our results show that the Fas has preferential localization to liquid disordered membrane regions, and that it undergoes a conformational change from a bilayer inserted state in liquid-disordered membranes to an interfacial state in liquidordered membranes. This is a result of the strong hydrophobic mismatch between the (hydrophobic) peptide length and the hydrophobic thickness of liquid-ordered membranes. In addition, we show that ceramide, a sphingolipid intimately involved in Fas oligomerization and apoptosis triggering, does not affect Fas membrane organization. Overall, our results highlight ceramide role as an enhancer of Fas oligomerization, and unravel the protective function of Fas transmembrane domain against non-ligand induced Fas apoptosis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-134"}, {"text": "Organization and dynamics of membrane-bound bovine a-lactalbumin: a fluorescence approach Arunima Chaudhuri and Amitabha Chattopadhyay Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad 500 007, India E-mail: amit@ccmb.res.in Many soluble proteins are known to interact with membranes in partially disordered states, and the mechanism and relevance of such interactions in cellular processes are beginning to be understood.

We propose that proteins embedded in bio-membranes can spontaneously self-organize into stable small clusters, due to the competition between short-range attractive and intermediate-range repulsive forces between proteins, specific to these systems. In addition, membrane domains are supposedly specialized, in order to perform a determined biological task, in the sense that they gather one or a few protein species out of the hundreds of different ones that a cell membrane may contain. By analyzing the balance between mixing entropy and protein affinities, we propose that protein sorting in distinct domains, leading to domain specialization, can be explained without appealing to preexisting lipidic micro-phase separations, as in the lipid raft scenario. We show that the proposed scenario is compatible with known physical interactions between membrane proteins, even if thousands of different species coexist.

Brij DRMs were enriched in cholesterol as well as TX100 DRMs. HPTLC analysis showed a very similar distribution of phosphatidylcholine-PC, phosphatidylethanolamine-PE and sphingomyelin-SM in Brij DRMs to that found in ghost membranes. SM-enriched DRMs were obtained only with TX100 while PE content was decreased in TX100 DRMs, in comparison to Brij DRMs. Immunoblot essays revealed that rafts markers (flotillin-2 and stomatin) were present in all DRMs. Contrary to TX100 DRMs, analysis of electron paramagnetic resonance spectra (with 5-doxyl stearate spin label) revealed that Brij DRMs are not in the liquid-ordered state, evincing the differential extraction of membrane lipids promoted by these detergents.

We have been developing recently lipids that contain in one of their chains a biphenyl group (TBBPC) affording an orientation parallel to the magnetic field, in the absence of lanthanides. A large number of hydrophobic molecules including membrane proteins have been successfully embedded and static nmR afforded finding the orientation of protein helices in membranes; MAS nmR provided the 3D structure of peptides in bicelles. Biphenyl bicelles keep their macroscopic orientation for days outside the field, thus leading to combined nmR and X-Rays experiments.

Fluoroquinolones are antibiotics that have a large spectrum of action against Gram negative and some Gram positive bacteria. The interaction between these species and liposomes has been cited as a reference in the understanding of their diffusion through phospholipid bilayer and can be quantified by the determination of partition coefficients between a hydrophobic phase (liposomes) and an aqueous solution. It is also known that some porins of the bacterial membranes are involved in transport mechanism of many fluoroquinolones. OmpF, a well characterized membrane protein characteristic of the outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria assumes the conformation of homo-trimer, whose monomers have two tryptophan residues (one located at the interface of monomers and the other at the interface lipid/protein). Thus, we proceeded to study the interaction of Ciprofloxacin, a second generation fluoroquinolone, with unilamellar liposomal vesicles and OmpF proteoliposomes of POPE/POPG, POPE/POPG/Cardiolipin and E. coli total. Partition coefficients (Kp's) and the association with OmpF proteoliposomes were determined by steady state fluorescence spectroscopy under physiological conditions (T=37\u00b0C; pH 7.4).

JAK1 and JAK3 behave differently in various aspects: In the absence of receptors, JAK1 still binds the membrane, whereas JAK3 diffuses homogeneously in the cytoplasm. We used FCS under total internal reflection illumination (TIR-FCS) and determined the membrane binding affinity of JAK1 to be 60\u00b136 nm. The association of JAK3 with the common gamma chain (c c ) is very tight as shown by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Molecular brightness analysis of single-point FCS shows that JAK1 diffuses as a monomer in the rather small cytoplasmic pool, whereas JAK3 diffuses as dimers, which undergo a defined oligomerization. The degree of oligomerization decays at higher concentrations, indicating that some unknown, saturable scaffold is involved. Characterizing the binding and mobility schemes of the Janus kinases may be important to further elucidate their specific and redundant effects in signal transduction. Plasma membrane (PM)-enriched fraction obtained through subcellular fractioning protocols are commonly used in studies investigating the ability of a compound to bind to a receptor. However, the presence of mitochondria membranes (MI) in the PM-enriched fraction may compromise several experimental results because MI may also contain the interest binding proteins. Aiming to analyze the subcellular fractioning quality of a standard sucrose density based protocol, we investigated (a) the Na + K + -ATPase (PM marker) and succinate dehydrogenase -SD (MI marker) activities; (b) the immunocontent of the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT -MI membrane marker) in both PM-and MI-enriched fractions. Since several binding protocols may require long incubation period, we verified the quality of both fractions after 24 hours of incubation in adequate buffer. Our results show that PMand MI-enriched fractions exhibit contamination with MI or PM, respectively. We did not observe any effect of incubation on Na + K + -ATPase activity and ANT content in both fractions. Surprisingly, SD activity was preserved in the PM-but not in MI-enriched fraction after incubation.

Human neutrophil peptide 1 (HNP1) is a human cationic defensin that present microbial activity against various bacteria (both Gram-positive and negative), fungi and viruses. HNP1 is stored in the cytoplasmic azurophilic granules of neutrophils and epithelial cells. In order to elucidate the mode of action of this antimicrobial peptide (AMP), studies based on its lipid selectivity were carried out. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) with different lipid compositions were used as biomembranes model systems (mammal, fungal and bacterial models). Changes on the intrinsic fluorescence of the tryptophan residues present in HNP1 upon membrane binding/insertion were followed, showing that HNP1 have quite distinct preferences for mammalian and fungal membrane model systems. HNP1 showed low interaction with glucosylceramide rich membranes, but high sterol selectivity: it has a high partition for ergosterol-containing membranes (as fungal membranes) and low interaction with cholesterolcontaining membranes (as in mammalian cells). These results reveal that lipid selectivity is the first step after interaction with the membrane. Further insights on the HNP1 membrane interaction process were given by fluorescence quenching measurements using acrylamide, 5-doxylstearic acid (5NS) or (16NS). Nanoparticles (NP) are currently used in many industrial or research applications (paints, cosmetics, drug delivery materials\u2026). Recent papers demonstrate clearly their activity with biological membranes (nanoscale holes, membrane thinning, disruption). Different studies of the NP-membrane interaction suggest that parameters are particularly important, such as the NP size, their surface properties or their aggregation state. Composition of biological membranes being particularly complex, supported lipid bilayers (SLB) composed of a restricted number of lipids are usually used as simplified membrane model. Moreover, these two-dimensional systems are convenient for surface analysis techniques, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), giving information on the morphology of the SLB and its mechanical properties. In this work, we study the behaviour of SLBs made of lipids representative of the membrane fluid phase (POPC) or of the raft phase (sphingomyelin). These SLBs are deposited on planar surfaces (mica or glass) previously recovered with silica beads (10 or 100 nm in diameter) in order to mimick the NP-membrane interaction.

The investigations demonstrated the existence of numerous enzymes in nuclei which modulate the changes of nuclear lipids during different cellular processes. Although the nuclear membrane is accepted as the main place of the lipids localization, nearly 10% of nuclear lipids are discovered in chromatin fraction. The ability of chromatin phospolipids to regulate DNA replication and transcription was already demonstrated. The chromatin phospolipids seems to play an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation as well as in apoptosis. It seems also possible that chromatin phospholipids may be participated in realization of cisplatin antitumor effects. The 24-hour in vivo effect of cisplatin on rat liver chromatin phospholipids was investigated. The phospholipids of rat liver chromatin were fractionated by microTLC technique. The quantitative estimation of fractionated phospholipids was carried out by computer program FUGIFILM Science Lab. 2001 Image Gauge V 4.0. The alteration of total phospholipids content as well as the quantitative changes among the individual phospholipids fractions in rat liver chromatin after in vivo action of cisplatin was established. The total content of chromatin phospholipids was significantly decreased after the cisplatin action. Four from five individual phospholipids fractions were markedly changed after the drug action. Two cholin-content phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin exhibit diversity in sensitivity to this drug: the increase of sphingomyelin content accompanied by quantitative decrease of phosphatidylcholine. The quantity of cardiolipin was markedly increased while the amount of phosphatidylinositol was decreased after the cisplatin treatment. The phosphatidylethanolamin content remained unchanged after the drug action.

The membrane phospholipid lysylphosphatidylglycerol (L-PG) appears to play a key role in Staphylococcal drug resistance, since its absence in mutant bacteria renders them susceptible to a range of cationic antimicrobials.

We have investigated this phenomenon using a range of model membrane systems composed of both synthetic lipids and reconstituted natural lipid extracts, using such techniques as stopped-flow fluorescence, circular dichroism and neutron scattering. Our conclusions indicate that the initial assumptions about the role of L-PG in drug resistance are over-simplistic and certainly do not tell the whole story of the physical and biological properties of this fascinating moderator or membrane behaviour.

In order to separate the effects of increasing concentration of binding sites from this topological effect, we investigated the oligomer formation based on pyrene-fluorescence for a series of lipid compositions, where the fraction of toxin binding lipids (egg phospatidylcholine (ePC) or egg sphingomyelin (eSM)) was varied while their concentration remained constant. The results indicate that an increased local density of toxin binding sites occurring due to phase separation facilitates oligomer formation. Furthermore, the change in local environment (number of neighboring cholesterol molecules) upon domain formation also enhances oligomer formation.We thank the DFG (SFB 490) for financial support, S.

We used the fluorescent probe Laurdan which is able to detect changes in membrane phase properties. When incorporated in lipid bilayers, Laurdan emits from two different excited states, a non-relaxed one when the bilayer packing is tight and a relaxed state when the bilayer packing is loose. This behavior is seen in recorded spectra as a shift of maximum emission fluorescence from 440 nm at temperatures below lipids phase transition to 490 nm at temperatures above lipids phase transition values. Emission spectra of Laurdan were analyzed as a sum of two Gaussian bands, centered on the two emission wavelengths allowing a good evaluation of the relative presence of each population. Our results show that both Laurdan emission states are present with different shares in a wide temperature range for DMPC liposomes with cholesterol. Quercetin leads to a decrease in the phase transition temperature of liposomes, acting in the same time as a quencher on Laurdan fluorescence.

The caveolin scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 includes a short sequence containing a CRAC motif (V 94 TKYWFYR 101 ) at its C-terminal end. To investigate the role of this motif in the caveolin-membrane interaction at the atomic level, we performed a detailed structural and dynamics characterization of a cav-1(V94-L102) nonapeptide encompassing this motif and including the first residue of cav-1 hydrophobic domain (L102), in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles and in DMPC/DHPC bicelles, as membrane mimics. nmR data revealed that this peptide folded as an amphipathic helix located in the polar head group region.

To investigate the interactions between the CRAC motif and the lipids, we performed molecular dynamics simulations in two different environment: a DPC micelle and a POPC bilayer. The results obtained are in good agreement with nmR data and the comparison between both systems provided insight into the orientation of the CRAC motif at the membrane interface and into its interactions with lipids.

The length of the main bridging chain is varied in order to modify the hydrophilic/lipophilic balance. The other chemical modification was to introduce a diacetylenic unit in the middle of the bridging chain to study the influence of the pp stacking on the supramolecular organisation of these molecules. Dry bolaamphiphiles self-organize in supramolecular structures such as lamellar crystalline structure, lamellar fluid structure and lamellar gel structure. The thermal dependence of these structures, as well as the phase transition is followed by smallangle and wide-angle X-ray scattering. Once the thermal cycle is accomplished, the system remains in the kinetically stabilized undercooled high-temperature phase at temperature of 20\u00b0C. Subsequently, the time dependence of the relaxation to the thermodynamically stable phase is followed and very slow relaxation on the order of hours or days is observed.

Liposomes made of OPP and different amount of cholesterol (CH) showed diminished hemolytic activity as compared to micellar OPP, but in most cases cytotoxic activity was lower. In order to find optimal liposomal composition and to understand better the difference in the response of ER+ and ER-cells the interaction OPP liposomes with ER+ and ER-cells was studied. For liposomes with high amount of CH both cell types showed slow release of the liposome entrapped spin probe into the cytoplasm. Liposmes with low amount of CH interact better with cells but the release is faster for ER-as for ER+ cells at 37\u00b0C. Experiments with nitroxide-labeled OPP (SL-OPP) liposomes suggest that the exchange of SL-OPP between liposomes and cellular membranes is fast. However, translocation of SL-OPP across the plasma membrane is slow, but seems to be faster for OPP resistent, ER+ cells as for ER-cells at 37\u00b0C.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-155"}, {"text": "Estimation of a membrane pore size based on the law of conservation of mass Krystian Kubica 1 , Artur Wrona 1 and Olga Hrydziuszko 2 1 Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Instrumentation, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland, 2 Centre for Systems Biology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-161"}, {"text": "The size of biomembrane pores determines which solutes or active compounds may enter the cell.

To this end, we have explored the spatiotemporal dynamics of STAT recruitment at the membrane on a single molecule level. Highly transient interaction of STATs to membrane-proximal sites was detected by TIRF-microscopy, allowing for localizing and tracking individual molecules beyond the diffraction limit. Thus, we obtained a pattern of the spatio-temporal recruitment of STAT molecules to the plasma membrane revealing distinct submicroscopic structures and hotspots of STAT interaction with overlapping recruitment sites for STAT1 and STAT2. Strikingly, these STAT binding sites were independent on receptor localization and expression level. Simultaneous superresolution imaging of the cytoskeleton revealed the organization of STAT recruitment sites within the cortical actin skeleton. Characterization of molecular dynamics on living cell membranes at the nanoscale level is fundamental to unravel the mechanisms of membrane organization andcompartmentalization. We have recently demonstr ated the feasibility of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) based on the nanometric illumination of near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) probes on intact living cells [1] . NSOM-FCS was applied to study the diffusion of fluorescent lipid analogs on living CHO cells. The experiments allowed to reveal details of the diffusion hidden by larger illumination areas and associated with nanoscale membrane compartmentalization. The technique also offers the unique advantages of straightforward implementation of multiple color excitation, opening the possibility to study nanoscale molecular cross-correlation. Furthermore, the NSOM probe evanescent axial illumination allows to extend diffusion study to the membrane-proximal cytosolic region. As such, NSOM-FCS represents a novel powerful tool to characterize the details of many biological processes in which molecular diffusion plays a relevant role. The growing interest in supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) on conductive substrates, such as gold, is due to the possibility of designing lipid-based biosensor interfaces with electrochemical transduction.

HCV entry into the host cell is achieved by the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, replicates its genome in a membrane associated replication complex, and morphogenesis has been suggested to take place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or modified ER membranes. The variability of the HCV proteins gives the virus the ability to escape the host immune surveillance system and notably hampers the development of an efficient vaccine. HCV has a single-stranded genome which encode a polyprotein, cleaved by a combination of cellular and viral proteases to produce the mature structural proteins (core, E1, E2, and p7) and non-structural ones (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B), the latter associated with the membrane originated from the ER in the emerging virus. The NS4B protein, a fundamental player in the HCV replicative process and the least characterized HCV protein, is a highly hydrophobic protein associated with ER membranes. It has recently been shown that the C-terminal is palmitoylated and the N-terminal region has potent polymerization activity. The expression of NS4B induces the formation of the so called membranous web, which has been postulated to be the HCV RNA replication complex. Thus, a function of NS4B might be to induce a specific membrane alteration that serves as a scaffold for the formation of the HCV replication complex and therefore has critical role in the HCV cycle. Due to the high hydrophobic nature of NS4B, a detailed structure determination of this protein is very difficult. The NS4B protein is an integral membrane protein with four or more transmembrane domains. The C-terminal region of NS4B is constituted by two a helices, H 1 (approximately from amino acid 1912 to 1924) and H 2 (approximately from amino acid 1940 to 1960), which have been studied as potential targets for inhibiting HCV replication. Previous studies from our group, based on the study of the effect of NS4B peptide libraries on model membrane integrity, have allowed us to propose the location of different segments in this protein that would be implicated in lipid-protein interaction. Additionally, the H 1 region could be an essential constituent in the interaction between protein and membrane. In this study we show that peptides derived from the C-terminal domain of NS4B protein of HCV are able to interact with high affinity to biomembranes, significantly destabilizing them and affecting their biophysical properties. There were also differences in the interaction of the peptide depending on the lipid composition of the membranes studied. We have also applied fluorescence spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry which have given as a detailed biophysical study of the interaction of the peptide with model biomembranes.

The increased salt concentration means also a larger density of divalent ions which form a bridge at the contact region (stronger adhesion). The overall effect is a smaller membrane repulsion.

Ceramide fatty acid composition selectively regulates distinct cell processes by a yet unknown mechanism. However, evidence suggests that biophysical processes are important in the activation of signalling pathways. Indeed, ceramide strongly affects membrane order, induces gel/fluid phase separation and forms highly-ordered gel domains. The impact of ceramide N-acyl chain in the biophysical properties of a fluid membrane was studied in POPC membranes mixed with distinct ceramides. Our results show that: i) saturated ceramide has a stronger impact on the fluid membrane, increasing its order and promoting gel/fluid phase separation, while their unsaturated counterparts have a lower (C24:1 ceramide) or no (C18:1 ceramide) ability to form gel domains at physiological temperature, ii) differences between distinct saturated species are smaller and are related mainly to domain morphology, and iii) very long chain ceramide induces the formation of tubular structures probably associated with interdigitation. These results suggest that generation of different ceramide species in cell membranes has a distinct biophysical impact with acyl chain saturation dictating membrane lateral organization, and chain asymmetry governing interdigitation and membrane morphology. Extra high content of cholesterol (Chol) in fiber-cell membranes in the eye lens leads to Chol saturation and formation of cholesterol bilayer domains (CBDs). It is hypothesized that high enrichment in cholesterol helps to maintain lens transparency and protect against cataractogenesis. In model studies, the CBD is formed in a phospholipid bilayer when cholesterol content exceeding the cholesterol solubility threshold, thus, the CBD is surrounded by phospholipid bilayer saturated with cholesterol. In the present study, we carried out molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of two bilayers: a palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer (reference) and a 1:1 POPC-Chol bilayer, to investigate the smoothing effect of the saturating amount of cholesterol on the bilayer. To our knowledge, this effect has not been studied so far so this study is certainly providing new results. Our results indicate that saturation with cholesterol significantly narrows the distribution of vertical positions of the center-of-mass of the POPC molecules and the POPC atoms in the bilayer and smoothes the bilayer surface. We hypothesize that this smoothing effect decreases light-scattering and helps to maintain lens transparency. The phospholipid content of Staphylococcus aureus membranes displays a high degree of variability (1-3). The major phospholipids found in S. aureus are phosphatidylglycerol (PG), cardiolipin (CL) and lysylphosphatidylglycerol (LPG), (1) the concentrations of which are environment dependent and see fluctuations on exposure to high concentrations of positively charged moieties (4) . Up regulation of LPG has a suspected role in neutralisation of the plasma membrane in response to cationic threats. Studies have been conducted to probe biomimetic models of this theory however our focus is to look at atomic details of membrane extracts in the presence of magaininF5W. S. aureus 476 lipid extracts from cells grown at pH 5.5 and 7.0, studies by neutron diffraction with and without peptide at two contrasts. D-spacings were assessed by Vogt area fitting and Bragg's law. Bilayer separation at low pH was *1-2 \u00c5 less than pH 7.0. With peptide, bilayer separations of pH 5.5 and 7.0 extracts were reduced by *2 \u00c5 and *4 \u00c5 , respectively. Reduced PG content of low pH extracts is suggested to reduce D-spacing, however presence of peptide further reduces this, possibly by an anion neutralisation effect. Abnormal D-spacing on increased humidity may be due to the breakdown of LPG. Activation of neutrophils releasing HOCl and apoptosis of vein endothelial cells are the events documented to occur in the course of atherosclerosis. As lipid chlorohydrins, which are the key products of the reaction between HOCl and unsaturated fatty acid residues, were found in atherosclerotic plaques, we decided to check their biological activity in the context of their ability to act as the mediators of HOClinduced oxidative stress and apoptosis in the culture of immortalized human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HU-VEC-ST). The concentration of reactive oxygen species was found to be elevated after 1 h cell incubation with phospahtidylcholine chlorohydrins. This effect was at least partially caused by the leakage of superoxide anion from mitochondria and followed by depletion of GSH and total thiols. The significant decrease of antioxidant capacity of cell extracts was also observed. The intracellular red-ox imbalance was accompanied by the increase of the ratio between phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of p38 MAP kinase. After longer incubation a significant number of apoptotic cells appeared. Summing up, phosphatidylcholine chlorohydrins may be regarded as signaling molecules, able to initiate signalling pathways by induction of oxidative stress. Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are a valuable tool in the study of lateral distribution of biological membrane components. GUV dimensions are comparable to typical cell plasma membranes and lipid phase separation can be observed through fluorescence microscopy. GUV studies frequently require immobilization of the vesicles, and several methods are available for that effect. One of the most common methodologies for vesicle immobilization is the use of avidin/streptavidin coated surfaces and biotin labeled lipids at very low concentration in the vesicles. Here, we analyze the effect of using this methodology on lipid domain distribution for different lipid compositions. We show that as a result of non-homogeneous distribution of biotin labeled lipids between liquid disordered, liquid ordered and gel phases, distribution of lipid domains inside GUVs can be dramatically affected.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2962, "end": 2965, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-173"}, {"text": "Monitoring membrane permeability: development of a SICM approach Christoph Sa\u00dfen 1,2 and Claudia Steinem 1 1 Institute for Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry, University of G\u00f6 ttingen, Tammannstra\u00dfe 2, 37077 G\u00f6 ttingen, Germany, 2 GGNB Doctoral Program: IMPRS, Physics of Biological and Complex Systems Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) utilises a nanopipette containing an electrode as a probe for surface investigations with resolutions of 1/3 of the inner pipette diameter.

Interleukin-2 and -15 receptors play a central role in the activation, survival and death of T lymphocytes. They form supramolecular clusters with MHC I and II glycoproteins in T cells. In damaged or inflamed tissues the extracellular K+ concentration increases, which can depolarize the membrane. The common signaling beta and gamma chains of IL-2/15R are phosphorylated upon cytokine binding and get a permanent dipole moment, thus their conformation, interactions, mobility and activity may be sensitive to the membrane potential. We induced depolarization on FT 7.10 T lymphoma cells by increasing the ec. K+ level or by blocking Kv 1.3 voltage gated K+ channels with margatoxin. FCS measuremens showed that the lateral mobility of Fab-labeled IL-2/ 15R and MHC I and II decreased upon depolarization, while that of GPI-linked CD48 did not change. FRET efficiency measured between some elements of the IL-receptor/MHC cluster increased, which may reflect an increase of cluster size. IL-2-induced receptor activity, as monitored by measuring STAT5-phosphorylation, increased upon depolarization, whereas IL-15 induced phosphorylation did not change. Our results may reveal a novel regulatory mechanism of receptor function by the membrane potential. cytokines play an important role in T cell activation and immunological memory, whereas MHCs are known for the role in antigen presentation. We applied RNAi to silence the expression of MHC I in order to study its possible role in receptor assembly and function. FRET data indicated that the association of IL-2R and IL-15R with MHC I as well as between IL-2R and IL-15R weakened. FCS indicated an increase of receptor mobility also suggesting the partial disassembly of the clusters. MHC I gene silencing lead to a remarkable increase of IL-2/IL-15 induced phosphorylation of STAT5 transcription factors. In search for the molecular background of this inhibition of signaling by MHC I we checked IL-2 binding and the formation of the receptor complex (IL-2R alpha -IL-2R beta association), but we did not find a difference as compared to the control. Our results suggest that MHC I plays an organizing role in maintaining supramolecular receptor clusters and inhibits IL-2R signaling, revealing a nonclassic new function of MHC I beyond its classical role in antigen presentation. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is an important cytokine involved in adaptive immunity. IL-4 binds with high affinity the singlepass transmembrane receptor IL-4Ra. The occupied complex, IL-4/IL-4Ra then engages either IL-2Rc or IL-13Ra1, to form an activated type I or II receptor, respectively. This formation of heterodimers is believed to trigger cross-activation of intracellular Janus kinases. Here we follow a fluorescently labeled ligand through various stages of receptor activation in HEK293T: Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), we see that the receptor chains diffuse as monomers within the plasma membrane. Using dual-color FCCS provides direct evidence for ligand induced co-diffusion of occupied IL-4Ra and IL-13Ra1. In contrast, type I complexes containing IL-2Rc could not be observed. However, ectopic expression of GFP-tagged IL-2Rc/JAK3 induced stable fluorescent speckles in or close to the plasma membrane. We identified these structures as early sorting endosomes by colocalization of surface markers like EEA1 and Rab GTPases. The IL-4Ra chain is continuously trafficking into these compartments. These observations suggest that the formation of a type I IL-4R heterodimer may require internalization and that early endosomes serve as a platform for IL-4 signaling. Among the membrane associated proteins, the Ras family, which is lipid-anchored G protein, plays a key role in a large range of physiological processes and, more importantly, is deregulated in a large variety of cancer. In this context, plasma membrane heterogeneity appears as a central concept since it ultimately tunes the specification and regulation of Ras-dependent signaling processes. Therefore, to investigate the dynamic and complex membrane lateral organization in living cells, we have developed an original approach based on molecule diffusion measurements performed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy at different spatial scales (spot variable FCS, svFCS) (1). We have shown in a variety of cell types that lipidbased nanodomains are instrumental for cell membrane compartmentalization. We have also observed that thesenanodomains are critically involved in the activation of signaling pathways and are essential for physiological responses (2-3). More recently, weextend the application of svFCS to characterizethe dynamics of K-Rasproteinat the plasma membrane. As major result, we demonstrated that the rate of K-Ras association/dissociation from the membrane is fast but vary as a functional of the activation state of the molecule as well as of specific intracellular protein interactions. We have so demonstrated that an helical lid sub-domain in the SBD is essential for monomeric AS binding, but not for the anti-aggregation activity of the chaperone, suggesting that Hsp70 is able to interact with pre-fibrillar oligomeric species formed during AS aggregation and that, then, the mechanism of binding for these species is different from that of the monomeric protein. Aggregation of the acylphosphatase from Sulfolobus solfataricus (Sso AcP) into amyloid-like protofibrils is induced by the establishment of an intermolecular interaction between a 11-residue unfolded segment at the N-terminus and the globular unit of another molecule. We have used data from hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments, intermolecular paramagnetic relaxation enhancements and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements on an aggregation-resistant Sso AcP variant lacking the 11-residue N-terminus to characterize the initial steps of the aggregation reaction. Under solution conditions that favour aggregation of the wild-type protein, the truncated protein was found to interact with a peptide corresponding to the N-terminal residues of the full length protein. This interaction involves the fourth strand of the main b-sheet structure of the protein and the loop following this region and induces a slight decrease in protein flexibility. We suggest that the amyloidogenic state populated by Sso AcP prior to aggregation does not present local unfolding but is characterized by increased dynamics throughout the sequence that allow the protein to establish new interactions, leading to the aggregation reaction.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-184"}, {"text": "Amyloid-like aggregates alter the membrane mobility of GM1 gangliosides Martino Calamai and Francesco Pavone University of Florence, LENS -European Laboratory for Non-Linear Spectroscopy, Sesto Fiorentino, Florence, Italy", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O-192"}, {"text": "Neuronal dysfunction in neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease is currently attributed to the interaction of amyloid aggregates with the plasma membrane.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O-192"}, {"text": "Amongst the variety of toxic mechanisms proposed, one involves the binding of amyloid species to GM1 gangliosides.

Importantly, due to the complexity and crowding of the cellular region, such parameters also play a crucial role in in vivo processes. We present an experimental approach to study in vitro amyloid aggregation in a controlled and uniform shear force field and within microscale environments. In particular we focus on the effect of these two parameters on the formation of spherical aggregates, known as spherulites. Using micro channels of different cross-sections from 5 to1000 lm x 12 lm and flow rates in the range of hundreds of ll/min, the number and diameter of spherulites within the channels have been characterized using crossed polarizers optical microscopy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-193"}, {"text": "Inhibition of insulin amyloid fibrillization by albumin magnetic fluid K.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia in the elderly. The most important genetic risk factor identified for AD is the isoform, e2, e3 or e4, of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a lipid-carrying protein. One hallmark of AD is the accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Ab) in the brain which is thought to result from an imbalance between the production of Ab and its clearance. Previous studies report an important role for ApoE in Ab degradation. We sought to determine the effect of ApoE isoform and lipidation status on the degradation of soluble Ab by proteinases such as insulin-degrading enzyme and neprilysin. In this study an in vitro Ab clearance assay based on the competition between Ab and a fluorogenic peptide substrate is developed to quantify Ab degradation. To elucidate the proteolytic clearance mechanism, the fragments resulting from cleavage are identified by mass spectrometry and further analyzed to identify the interacting stretch of the Ab sequence with the different ApoE isoforms. The results suggest that ApoE influences the rate of Ab degradation. The aggregation of proteins into fibrillar nanostructures is a general form of behaviour encountered for a range of different polypeptide chains. The formation of these structures is associated with pathological processes in the context of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases but is also involved in biologically beneficial roles which include functional coatings and catalytical scaffolds.

Interestingly, 14-3-3(eta) does not show any binding affinity for monomeric AS, nor for the mature fibrillar aggregates. We provide evidence that it acts on the oligomeric species which form during the amyloidogenesis process of aggregation.

The kinetics of this process is characterized by the occurrence of multiple transient species that give rise to final aggregates whose morphology and molecular structure are strongly affected by the growth conditions. To observe in details the aggregation pathway as a function of solution conditions, we have used different experimental techniques as Light scattering, Thioflavin T fluorescence, Circular Dichroism and two-photon fluorescence microscopy. This approach gives information on the time evolution of conformational changes at molecular level, on the aggregates/fibrils growth and on their morphologies. The selected experimental conditions allowed us to highlight the existence of at least three different aggregation mechanisms acting in competition. A first assembly stage, which implies conformational conversion of native peptides, leads to the formation of small ordered oligomers representing an activated conformation to proceed towards fibril growth. This process constitutes the rate limiting step for two distinct fibril nucleation mechanisms that probably implicate spatially heterogeneous mechanisms. The formation of amyloid fibrils of amylin 10-29 was studied by means of molecular dynamics (MD) and energy partition on three peptide \u00df-sheet stack systems with the same amino acid composition: wild type amylin 10-29 (Amyl 10-29), reverse amylin 10-29 (Rev-Amyl 10-29) and scrambled amylin version Scr-Amyl 10-29. The results show that for Amylin10-29 peptides, amino acid composition determines the propensity of a peptide to form amyloid fibrils independent of their sequence. The sequence of amino acids defines the shape and the strength of amyloid protofibril, which conforms with the atom force microscope (AFM) data [1] . MD show that the 6x6RevAmyl-10-29 stack has looser selfassembly than the 6x6Amyl-10-29 stack, which conforms with the results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements for the peptides studied [1] . The results of MD show that 6x6Amyl-10-29 could have a turn, which consists with FTIR data [1] . Data on Ab aggregation kinetics have been characterized by a large spread between experiments on identical samples that contain so many molecules that stochastic behaviour is difficult to explain unless caused by uncontrolled amounts of impurities or interfaces. We have therefore spent considerable effort to eliminate sources of inhomogeneity and reached a level of reproducibility between identical samples and between experiments on separate occasions that we can now collect data that can lead to mechanistic insights into the aggregation process per se, and into the mechanism of action of inhibitors. Data on Ab42 aggregation will be shown that give insight into the influence of physical parameters like peptide concentration, shear and ionic strength, as well as the effect of inhibitory proteins, model membranes and the effects of sequence variations. Monte Carlo simulations of amyloid formation from model peptides corroborate the finding from experiments and underscore that the very high level of predictability and reproducibility comes from multiple parallel processes. Negatively-charged membranes were reported to catalyze ''amyloid-like'' fiber formation by non-amyloidogenic proteins [1] . Our study aims to elucidate the factors that govern the formation of these amyloid-like fibers. Lysozyme was selected as a model of non-amyloidogenic protein and was fluorescently-labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (A488-Lz). First, A488-Lz partition towards phosphatidylserine-containing liposomes was characterized quantitatively using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), in order to calculate the protein coverage of liposomes. Secondly, the interaction between A488-Lz and negatively-charged lipid membranes was studied using both steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence techniques. This interaction was found to switch from a peripheral binding to the anionic headgroups, at high lipid/ protein molar ratio (L/P), to a partial insertion of protein into the hydrophobic core of the membrane, at low L/P. Finally, the lipidprotein supramolecular complexes formed at low L/P were characterized by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The mean lifetime of A488-Lz in these supramolecular structures is much lower compared to the values obtained for the free and bound A488-Lz at high L/P.

A convergence of evidence strongly suggests that the early events leading to the structural conversion of the PrP seem to be in relation with more or less stable soluble oligomers, which could mediate neurotoxicity. As commonly shared by other amyloidogenic proteins, membrane-bound monomers undergo a series of lipid-dependent conformational changes, leading to the formation of oligomers of varying toxicity rich in b-sheet structures (annular pores, amyloid fibrils). Here, we have used a combination of biophysical techniques (Dynamic and Static Light Scattering, Fluorescence techniques, and Quartz Crystral Microbalance) to elucidate the interaction of native monomeric PrP and that of purified b-rich oligomeric PrP on model lipid membranes. Under well established conditions, three b-sheet-rich oligomers were generated from the partial unfolding of the monomer in solution, which were found to form in parallel. From single mutation and/or truncation of the full length PrP, the polymerization pathway is strongly affected, revealing the high conformational diversity of PrP. In our previous work, we identify the minimal region of the PrP protein leading to the same polymerization pattern of the full length PrP. Soluble 12-subunits and 36-subunits oligomers were obtained depending on the single mutation or truncation and purified. We compare their structural properties (FTIR, CD) when associated with anionic lipid bilayers and study their propensities to permeabilize the membrane. Fluorescence kinetics suggest different mechanisms of membrane perturbation for the monomer and the PrP oligomers. Deciphering this complex network of lipid interactions and conformational diversity of the PrP protein will help for understanding of how amyloidogenic proteins induce neurotoxicity. The traditional view of the lipid bilayer described as a ''sea'' of lipids where proteins may float freely, is going to be inadequate to describe the increasingly large number of complex phenomena which are known to take place in biological membranes. Membrane-assisted protein-protein interactions, formation of lipid clusters, protein-induced variation of the membrane shape, abnormal membrane permeabilities and conformational transitions of membrane-embedded proteins are only a few examples of the variegated ensemble of events whose tightly regulated cross-talk is essential for cell structure and function. Experimental work on the above mentionated problems is very difficult and some time not accessible, especially when the studied systems have a fast dynamics.

Additionally, SAXS experiments will give structural information about the molecular dimensions of the networks. The amyloid beta peptide (Ab), implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), is released from the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by secretase-induced cleavage. This process results in the release of a range of Ab peptides varying in length. The brains of AD patients often contain longer Ab peptides while the total concentration of Ab is unaffected. Longer peptides are more hydrophobic having far-reaching consequences for their toxicity and aggregation. As Ab is necessary for normal neuronal function, research activities into AD therapeutic development currently explore the possibilities of modulating c-secretase activity to produce short Ab peptides. Whether such an approach effectively ameliorates the toxic effect of Ab has not been explored yet. To answer this question, we studied the impact of heterogeneity in Ab pools in an in vitro biophysical and in cellulo context using MicroElectrode Array to assay the synaptic activity of primary neurons. We show that various lengths of the Ab peptide and mixtures thereof aggregate with distinct kinetics and notoriously affect synaptotoxic and cytotoxic response. We also show that small amounts of less abundant peptides Ab38 and Ab43 induce aggregation and toxicity of Ab40 while the behavior of Ab42 is unaffected. One of the most important irreversible oxidative modifications of proteins is carbonylation, a process of introducing the carbonyl group in reaction with reactive oxygen species. Importantly, carbonylation increases with the age of cells and is associated with the formation of intracellular protein aggregates and the pathogenesis of age-related disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. However, it is still largely unclear how carbonylation affects protein structure, dynamics and aggregability on the atomic level. Here, we use classical molecular dynamics simulations to study structure and dynamics of the carbonylated headpiece domain of villin, a key actin-organizing protein. We perform an exhaustive set of molecular dynamics simulations of native villin headpiece together with every single combination containing carbonylated versions of its seven lysine, arginine and proline residues, the quantitatively most important carbonylable amino acids. Surprisingly, our results suggest that high levels of carbonylation, far above those associated with cell death in vivo, may be required to destabilize and unfold protein structure through the disruption of specific stabilizing elements, such as salt bridges or proline kinks, or tampering with the hydrophobic effect. On the other hand, by using thermodynamic integration and molecular hydrophobicity potential approaches, we quantitatively show that carbonylation of hydrophilic lysine and arginine residues is equivalent to introducing hydrophobic, chargeneutral mutations in their place, and, by comparison with experimental results, demonstrate that this by itself significantly increases intrinsic aggregation propensity of both structured, native proteins and their unfolded states. Finally, our results provide a foundation for a novel experimental strategy to study the effects of carbonylation on protein structure, dynamics and aggregability using site-directed mutagenesis. Septins are an evolutionarily conserved family of GTP-binding proteins involved in important cellular processes, such as cytokinesis and exocytosis, and have been implicated in neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The focus of this study was two septins of Schistosoma mansoni, (the causative agent of Schistosomiasis in South America) named Smsept5 and Smsept10, which were produced in a recombinant system. Our objective was to verify if these septins from a simpler organism display similar characteristics to human septins. Analysis of protein structure by Circular Dichroism showed that both recombinant SmSeptins produced were folded. The GTPase activity assay showed that Smsept5 was able to hydrolyze GTP, whereas Smsept10 was not. Aggregation studies for amyloid fibril detection by right angle light scattering and Thioflavin T fluorescence assay were performed. Both proteins showed a temperature dependent increase in light scattering and fluorescence emission of ThT probe. This indicated that S. mansoni septins tend to aggregate into amyloid-like fibers in high temperatures, with thresholds of 30\u00b0C for Smsept5 and 37\u00b0C for Smsept10. These results are in accordance to that previously reported for human septins.

GQuadruplex requires the presence of monovalent cations playing a key role in stabilizing these structures, since they give rise to coordination bonds needed for the stacking of more tetrads. We performed X-ray diffraction experiments at different pressures (ranging from 1 to 2000 bar), and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) changing the temperature (between 20-60\u00b0C Retinoic acid receptor (RAR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. This ligand-inducible transcription factor binds to DNA as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) in the nucleus. The nucleus is a dynamic compartment and live-cell imaging techniques make it possible to investigate transcription factor action in real-time. We studied the diffusion of EGFP-RAR by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) in order to uncover the molecular interactions determining receptor mobility. In the absence of ligand we identified two distinct species with different mobilities. The fast component has a diffusion coefficient of D 1 = 1.8-6 lm 2 /s corresponding to small oligomeric forms, whereas the slow component with D 2 = 0.06-0.12 lm 2 /s corresponds to interactions of RAR with the chromatin or other large structures. The RAR ligand binding domain fragment also has a slow component probably as a result of indirect DNA-binding via RXR, with lower affinity than the intact RAR:RXR complex. Importantly, RAR-agonist treatment shifts the equilibrium towards the slow population of the wild type receptor, but without significantly changing the mobility of either the fast or the slow population. By using a series of mutant forms of the receptor with altered DNA-or coregulator-binding capacity we found that the slow component is probably related to chromatin binding, and that coregulator exchange, specifically the binding of the coactivator complex, is the main determinant contributing to the redistribution of RAR during ligand activation. Formation of inactive nuclear with high level of DNA compaction in sperm cells is accompanied by a substitution of linker histones H1 by a number of other proteins. Among them sperm-specific histones (SSH), which are characterized by elongated arginine-rich polypeptide chain compared to the somatic H1. The secondary and tertiary structure of the SSH and their interactions with DNA were studied using spectroscopic and thermodynamic approaches. The histones were isolated from sperm of marine invertebrates and rat thymus. All studied SSH demonstrate no considerable compaction of DNA in solutions of low ionic strength. However, at physiological conditions, SSH H1 from S.intermedius and A.japonica compact DNA more intensively than other SSH. The somatic H1 from rat thymus revealed a minimal ability to compact the DNA. We suggest that the SSH H1 are able to interact with DNA not only in the major groove but also in the minor groove of the double helix inducing considerable structural changes in DNA and facilitating the formation of the supercompact sperm chromatin.

During the last decade it was found that in many cases specific structural organization of multi-molecular protein and DNA-protein complexes determines their functioning in living cells. Although these functioning structures are usually unique, it is often possible to identify their common structural elements. One of the interesting examples of such universal elements are HMGB domains: structurally conservative functional domains of non-histone proteins HMGB1/2 also identified in many nuclear proteins. Using AFM, thermodynamic approaches, circular dichroism and molecular absorption spectroscopy in far-UV and mid-IR regions we have studied structural organization of the complexes between DNA and different proteins, including HMGB1, HMGB-domain recombinant proteins and linker histone H1. We have demonstrated, that interaction with DNA leads to increasing both a-helicity of the proteins and thermal stability of DNA. Also, this interaction may result in formation of highly ordered supramolecular complexes facilitated by HMGB-domains. The C-terminal sequence of HMGB1/2 regulates affinity of the proteins to DNA and can be ''inactivated'' by interaction with histone H1. Based on the data obtained a model of the interaction of multy-domain HMGB-proteins with DNA is suggested.

The pKM.101 resistant-factor in case of the control decreases the sensitivity of radiation, which as we suppose, is reached by the help of DNA conformation change. It can be supposed from the well known effect of radiation biology that by the effect of pKM.101, the ratio of DNA radiation sensitive volumes by appearing its new conformation decreases. The pKM.101 R-factor in rec mutants in case of gamma irradiation shows effects in two ways. One is the ''chemical'' connection between the R-factor and DNA, though the other relate to positive and negative ''induced'' radiation resistance from the local type effect of the connection of an R-factor and a rec mutant, and the two radiation resistant effects are added algebraically. As a result from the view of biology we have to categorize the radiation resistance and the connected repair processes as two different classes according to the change either in the chemical or in the induced radiation resistant effect. Recent studies have indicated that two trimethylated peptides (K6, K7), derived from the parental hybrid peptide CA(1-7)M(2-9), strongly interact with a bacterial membrane model (mixture of zwitterionic and negatively charged lipids), but not with a membrane model of mammalian erythrocytes (zwitterionic lipids) [1] . A reduction of the cytotoxicity effect and an improvement of the therapeutic index have also been reported for the derivatives when compared with the parental CA(1-7)M(2-9) [2] . In this work, with the aim of providing insight on the interaction phenomena of the indicated peptides with zwitterionic and negatively charged membrane models, a systematic molecular dynamics study was carried out. Full hydrated bilayers of DMPC:DMPG (3:1) and POPE:POPG(3:1) were studied in the presence of each peptide, and results analyzed in terms of peptide structure and membrane composition. Lipid-water and lipid-lipid interactions at the membrane/water interface play important role in maintaining the bilayer structure, however, this region is not easily available for experimental studies. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of two bilayers composed of two different types of lipids: (1) dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC); (2) galactolipid monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). To investigate the properties of the membrane/water interface region, we performed analysis of lipid-lipid interactions: direct, via charge pairs (DOPC) and hydrogen bonds (MGDG) as well as indirect, via water bridges. We also examined water-lipid interactions. Existence of well-defined entities (lipids) linked by different types of interactions (hydrogen bonds, charge pairs, water bridges) makes the analysis of the membrane/ water interface region a suitable for a graph theoretical description. We applied a network analysis approach for comparative analysis of simulated systems. We note a marked difference between the organization as well as the dynamics of the interfacial region of the two bilayers. L-nucleoside analogues form an important class of antiviral and anticancer drug candidates. To be pharmacologically active, they need to be phosphorylated in multiple steps by cellular kinases. Human phosphoglycerate kinase (hPGK) was shown to exhibit low specificity for nucleotide diphosphate analogues and its catalytic efficiency in phosphorylation was also affected. To elucidate the effect of ligand chirality on dynamics and catalytic efficiency, molecular dynamics simulations were performed on four different nucleotides (D-/L-ADP and D-/L-CDP) in complex with hPGK and 1,3-bisphospho-D-glycerate (bPG). The simulation results confirm high affinity for the natural substrate (D-ADP), while L-ADP shows only moderate affinity for hPGK. The observed short residence time of both CDP enantiomers at the active site suggests very weak binding affinity which may result in poor catalytic efficiency shown for hPGK with D-/L-CDP. Analysis of the simulations unravels important dynamic conditions for efficient phosphorylation replacing the single requirement of a tight binding. Using the van der Waals density functional based on the semilocal exchange functional PW86 together with a longrange component of the correlation energy [1] implemented in the SIESTA program code, we have calculated the band structure of the double stranded DNA. The unit cell was built by taking together 10 GC (or AT) homogenous base pairs and we have considered the translational symmetry as the periodic boundary condition. The results obtained are compared with the oligomer calculations taking up to seven base pairs. The band structure obtained with this van der Waals density functional is also compared with results obtained with other exchange-correlation functionals as well as with band structure obtained by the Hartree-Fock crystal-orbital method taking into account the helical symmetry of the double stranded DNA. The role of different parts of DNA (base pairs, sugar-phosphate backbone, Na ions) is also presented. Transmembrane (TM) proteins comprise some 15% to 30% of the proteome but owing to technical difficulties, relatively few of these structures have been determined experimentally. Computational modeling techniques can be used to provide the essential structural data needed to shed light on structurefunction relationships in TM proteins. Low-resolution electrondensity maps, obtained from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) or preliminary X-ray diffraction studies, can be used to restrict the search in conformational space. At the right resolution, the locations of TM helices can be roughly determined even when the amino acids are not visible. When these data are combined with physicochemical characteristics of amino acids (such as their hydrophobicity) and with evolutionary conservation analysis of the protein family, the location of the amino acids can be modeled.

Calcium channels play a crucial role in many physiological functions and their selectivity mechanism is still an unresolved question and a subject of debate. A physical model of selective ''ion binding'' in the L-type calcium channel is constructed, and consequences of the model are compared with experimental data. This reduced model treats only ions and the carboxylate oxygens of the EEEE locus explicitly and restricts interactions to hard-core repulsion and ion-ion and ion-dielectric electrostatic forces. According to the charge/space competition mechanism, the charge of structural ions attracts cations into the filter, while excluded volume effects are trying to keep them out. This is a competition between energy and entropy, where the balance of these terms minimizes free energy and determines selectivity. Experimental conditions involving binary mixtures of alkali and/or alkaline earth metal ions are computed. The model pore rejects alkali metal ions in the presence of biological concentrations of Ca2+ and predicts the blockade of alkali metal ion currents by micromolar Ca2+. Conductance patterns observed in varied mixtures containing Na+ and Li+, or Ba2+ and Ca2+, are predicted. Ca2+ is substantially more potent in blocking Na+ current than Ba2+. In apparent contrast to experiments sing buffered Ca2+ solutions, the predicted potency of Ca2+ in blocking alkali metal ion currents depends on the species and concentration of the alkali metal ion, as is expected if these ions compete with Ca2+ for the pore. These experiments depend on the problematic estimation of Ca2+ activity in solutions buffered for Ca2+ and pH in a varying background of ulk salt. Equilibrium binding affinity (expressed as the occupancy of the selectivity filter by various ions) is computed by equilibrium grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. The conductivity of the channel is estimated from the equilibrium concentration profiles using the integrated Nernst-Planck equation. Our simulations show that the selectivity of L-type calcium channels can arise from an interplay of electrostatic and hard-core repulsion forces among ions and a few crucial channel atoms. The reduced system selects for the cation that delivers the largest charge in the smallest ion volume.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Computational biophysics and simulation"}, {"text": "We have also performed dynamic Monte Carlo (DMC) simulations for a model Ca channel to simulate current directly and present our results for the dynamical selectivity (expressed as the flux carried by various ions).

Carotenoids are used in light-harvesting complexes with the twofold aim to extend the spectral range of the antenna and to avoid radiation damages. The effect of the polarity and conformation of the environment is supposed to be responsible for the tuning of the electronic, optical and vibrational properties of peridinin carotenoid both in solution and in protein matrix. We investigate the effect of vibrational properties of peridinin in different solvents by means of vibrational spectroscopies and QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations 1 . The shift of vibrational fingerprints in the 1500-2000 cm -1 frequency region, due to the solvent polarity and proticity, is studied in three cases: cyclohexane (apolar/aprotic), deuterated acetonitrile (polar/aprotic) and methanol (polar/ protic). The frequencies and vibrational modes of the carbonyl, the allene, and the polyene chain were identified using effective normal mode analysis 2 and compared with the present and previous experimental data 3 . On the basis of our calculations and experiments in different solvents, we propose a classification of the four peridinins of the high-salt PCP form. The controlled self-assembly of functional molecular species on well defined surfaces is a promising approach toward the design of nanoscale architectures. By using this methodology, regular low-dimensional systems such as supramolecular clusters, chains, or nanoporous arrays can be fabricated. Small biological molecules such as amino acids represent an important class of building blocks that are of interest for molecular architectonic on surfaces because they inherently qualify for molecular recognition and selfassembly [1] . The interaction between amino acids and solid surfaces is decisive for the development of bioanalytical devices or biocompatible materials as well as for a fundamental understanding of protein-surface bonding. We investigate the adsorbtion mechanism of the cysteine on Au(111) surfaces by means of the DFT [2] . Our main concern is to describe the molecule-metal bonding mechanism. Therefore we present a complex study, including the full determination of the density of states for the free and adsorbed molecule, the determination of molecule-surface bonding energy. The method of crystal orbital overlap populations is used in order to determine the contribution of specific atomic orbitals to the molecule-metal bond. It is now widely accepted that myoglobin (Mb) is not simply an O 2 storage/delivery system but, depending on oxygen concentration, it exerts other fundamental physiological roles. Recent studies revealed a widespread expression and, in particular, an over-expression in response to hypoxia, in various non-muscle tissues, including tumor cells. In Human five different Mb isoforms are present. The two most expressed ([90%) differ only at the 54 th position, K54 (Mb-I) and E54 (Mb-II) respectively. Since high-altitude natives from Tibet are characterized by a higher Mb concentration and locomotion efficiency, together with the observation that the Mb overexpression is totally attributable to Mb-II, the idea that the latter might be one of the responses to high-altitude evolutionary adaptation, i.e. hypoxic environment, started to emerge. However, this is not yet supported by any structure/function investigation. We performed hundred nanoseconds MD simulations on human Mbs to investigate the structure and dynamics of both protein and surface water.

We found evidence from experiment and simulation for a polar interaction (hydrogenbond) across leukocyte integrin aLb2 TM that is absent in the better-studied platelet integrin aIIbb3 [1] . Our coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of TM helix-helix selfassembly showed more native-like packing achieved by aLb2 within the simulation timescale as compared to its 'lossof-function' b2T686G mutant or aIIbb3 [2] .

The likely conservation of this polar interaction across the b2 integrin family further reinforces its importance to the proper functioning of leukocyte integrins. Active extrusion of drugs through efflux pumps constitutes one of the main mechanisms of multidrug resistance in cells. In recent years, large efforts have been devoted to the biochemical and structural characterization of RND efflux pumps in Gram-negative bacteria, in particular the AcrB/A-TolC system of E.Coli. Specific attention has been addressed to the active part of the efflux system, constituted by the AcrB unit. Despite the presence of several data, crucial questions concerning its functioning are still open. The understanding of the structure-dynamics-function relationship of MexB, the analogous transporter in P. Aeruginosa, encounters even more difficulties, because of the lack of structural data of the transporter in complex with substrates. To shade some light on the activity of MexB, we performed computational studies on MexB interacting with two compounds, meropenem and imipenem, the first known to be a good substrate, and the second a modest one. Several techniques were used in the present work, ranging from flexible docking [1] to standard and targeted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Starting from the published crystal structure [2] we identified the most probable poses of the two compounds in both the original experimental and in the MD-equilibrated structures. We used information from AcrB binding pocket in order to find relevant binding sites of the two compounds in the analogous binding pocket of MexB. Meropenem frequently lies with appropriate orientation in a pocket similar to the one identified for doxorubicin in AcrB [3] , while the occurrence of imipenem poses in the same pocket is very scarce. Additionally, when present in the pocket, imipenem is located in a position that renders very unlikely its extrusion toward the OprM docking domain during the simulation of the functional peristalsis. The analysis of the trajectories has provided a complete inventory of the transporter and antibiotic hot spots, which is key information in terms of screening and design of antibiotics and inhibitors. Clathrins are three-legged proteins with the intriguing ability to self-assemble into a wide variety of polyhedral cages. The nucleation and growth of a clathrin lattice against the cytosolic face of a cell membrane enables the endocytosis of membrane proteins and various external molecules, by wrapping the membrane around the cargo to produce a coated transport vesicle within the cell. Clathrins can also self-assemble, in slightly acidic solutions devoid of auxiliary proteins, into empty cages. Our simulations of this process, using a highly coarsegrained model, indicate that the key to self-assembly is neither calthrin's characteristic puckered triskelion shape, nor the alignment of four legs along all cage edges, but an asymmetric distribution of interaction sites around the leg's circumference. Based on the critical assembly concentration, the binding strength in these cages is estimated at 25 to 40 k B T per clathrin.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 567, "end": 570, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 797, "end": 800, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2162, "end": 2165, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2274, "end": 2277, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2678, "end": 2681, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-253"}, {"text": "The simulations also answer the long-standing conundrum of how flat patches of purely hexagonal clathrin lattices, which in cryo electron microscopy are frequently seen to decorate cell membranes, can produce highly curved cages containing twelve pentagonal faces interdispersed between hexagonal faces. We present experimental evidence supporting this pathway. In eukaryotic cells, the exchange of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and the nucleus is mediated by specialized transport factors. By binding to these transporters, cargo molecules, which are otherwise excluded from entering the nucleus, can traverse the nuclear pore complex efficiently. Most of the proteins mediating nuclear import and export exhibit a characteristic _-solenoid fold, which provides them with an unusual intrinsic flexibility. CRM1 is an essential nuclear export receptor, which recognizes a very broad range of export cargoes. CRM1-dependent nuclear export is Ran-GTPase-driven, and recognition of RanGTP and cargo is highly cooperative. However, recent crystal structures show that the binding sites for export cargos and RanGTP are located at distant parts of CRM1 [1] [2] [3] . We have used a combined approach of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and small-angle X-ray scattering to study RanGTP and cargo binding to CRM1. We have found that the allosteric effect in CRM1-dependent nuclear export arises from a combination of subtle structural rearrangements and changes in the dynamic properties of CRM1. Light-induced phototactic responds in green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are mediated via microbial-type rhodopsins, termed Channelrhodopsin-1 (ChR1) and Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)1, which carry the chromophore retinal covalently linked to lysin via a Schiff base and were shown to be directly light-gated ion-channels2. The N-terminal putative seven-transmembrane region of ChR2 was shown to be responsible for the generation of photocurrents and exhibits sequence similarity to the well understood proton pump bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and the sensory rhodopsin Anabaena sensory rhodopsin (ASR)3. As for the majority of membrane proteins, there is no 3D-structural data for ChR2 available yet. Here we present homology models of ChR2 using two high-resolution X-ray template structures of BR (1QHJ4) respectively ASR (1XIO5) in order to get structural and functional insights into ChR2. With both homology models we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in a native membrane/solvent environment using GROMACS 4.0.36.

Here we show that the BR-based homology model is a reliable model of ChR2 exhibiting structural features already found experimen-tally7.

The thrombospondin family, being extracelluar proteins, is known to be implicated in various physiological processes such as wound healing, inflammation, angiogenesis and neoplasia. The signature domain of thrombospondins shows high sequence identities and thus allows us to transfer results obtained, studying this complex calcium reach part of the proteins, from one member of the family to the other. The domain is known to play a key role in hereditary diseases such as PSACH or MED. In this part of thrombospondins lies a binding site to integrins, important for cell attachment.

The process of swift heavy ions energy deposition while penetrating a solid or scattering on its surface can result in a strong and nonequilibrium excitation of matter.

Such limitations become more severe as the size of the systems investigated and the length of the simulations increase.

Local anesthetics (LA) are pain-relief drugs, widely used in medicine and dentistry. The relatively short duration of analgesia still restricts their clinical use for the treatment of chronic pain. Nowadays, intensive research is focused on anesthetics entrapped into liposomes to enhance their activity and pharmacokinetic properties [1] . In this work, we investigated the encapsulation of prilocaine (PLC), an aminoamide local anesthetic, into a small unilamellar liposome. On the line of our previous work [2] , we have carried out Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations using a Coarse Grain model up the microsecond time scale. In this way, we compare the effects of the concentration of LA at fisiological pH. We were able to capture important features of the PLC-vesicle interactions. The behavior of PLCs at fisiological pH is essentially a combination of high and low pH: we found that all neutral PLC molecules rapidly diffuse into the hydrophobic region of the vesicle adopting an asymmetric bimodal density distribution. Protonated PLC molecules (pPLC) initially placed in water were instead only found on the external monolayer, with a high rate of exchange with the water phase and no access to the inner part of the liposome in a concentration dependent way.

The importance of delta-opioid receptors as target of a large number of drugs is well recognized, but the molecular details of interaction and action of the compounds are largely unknown. In an effort to shade some light on this important issue we performed an extensive computational study on the interaction of two compounds, clozapine and desmetilclozapine, with a delta-opioid receptor. According to experiments, the lacking of a single methyl group in desmetilclozapine with respect of clozapine makes the former more active than the latter, providing a system well suited for a comparative study. We investigated stable configurations of the two drugs inside the receptor by simulating their escape routes by metadynamics, an algorithm that allows the simulation of events that are otherwise out of range for standard molecular dynamics simulations. Our results point out that the action of the compound is related to the spatial distribution of the affinity sites it visits during its permanency. Desmetilclozapine has a larger distribution of residues, which is interacting with, than clozapine. However, large conformational changes of the receptor were not observed in the presence of both compounds. Thus, a more dynamical picture of ligand-receptor affinity is proposed on the basis of the results obtained, involving the competition among different stable states as well as the interaction with the solvents. Such information might be useful to provide hints and insights that can be exploited in more structure-and-dynamics-oriented drug design. The coupling between the mechanical properties of enzymes and their biological activity is a well-established feature that has been the object of numerous experimental and theoretical works.

We study such phenomena using a method or investigating local flexibility on the residue scale, which combines a reduced protein representation with Brownian dynamics simulations. We performed calculations on the enzyme Guanylate Kinase in order to study its mechanical response when submitted to anisotropic deformations. The resulting modifications of the protein's rigidity profile can be related to the changes in substrate binding affinities that were observed experimentally. Further analysis of the principal components of motion of the trajectories shows how the application of a mechanical constraint on the protein can disrupt its dynamics, thus leading to a decrease of the enzyme's catalytic rate.

Despite of their established potential, RSFPs still have a major drawback: the wavelength for fluorescence excitation is always one of the two switching wavelengths. The imaging process thus inevitably results in the switching of a small fraction of the RSFPs, which might hinder or complicate some experiments. We developed a new reversibly switchable fluorescent protein which eliminates the problem of the coupling between switching and fluorescence excitation. This fluorescent protein follows an unusual and currently unknown mechanism of switching between a fluorescent and a nonfluorescent state. It is brightly fluorescent and exhibits an excellent signal to noise ratio. In parallel studies [2] , QD-based ligands (EGF, Mabs) were targeted to EGFR in gliomas.

The aim is to define more precisely the tumor boundaries at the time of resection. We used the Programmable Array Microscope designed for sensitive, high-speed optical sectioning, particularly of living cells. The PAM is based on structured illumination and conjugate detection using a digital micromirror device (DMD) [3] located in a primary image plane. The unique feature is the rapid, (re)programmable adjustment of local excitation intensity, Dynamic, on-the-fly optimization is thus achieved, e.g. multipoint FRAP [4] , light exposure minimization and object tracking [5] , or super-resolution strategies. The features and operation of the 3rd generation PAM will be presented. Contraction of muscle cells, motility of microorganisms, neuronal activity, and other fast cellular processes require microscopic imaging of a three-dimensional (3D) volume with a video-rate scanning. We present 3D video-rate investigations of structural dynamics in biological samples with the multicontrast third-and second-harmonic generation as well as fluorescence microscope. The multidepth scanning is achieved by two combined laser beams with staggered femtosecond pulses. Each of the beams is equipped with a pair of deformable mirrors for dynamic wavefront manipulation enabling multidepth refocusing with simultaneous corrections for optical aberrations. Combined, more than 250 frames per second lateral scanning with fast refocusing enables the 3D video-rate imaging of dynamically moving structures. In addition, combination of two laser beams is accomplished at two perpendicular polarizations enabling live imaging of sample anisotropy, which is important for structural studies particularly with the second harmonic generation microscopy. Investigations of beating chick embryo hearts with the 3D video-rate scanning microscope revealed multidirectional cardiomyocyte contraction dynamics in myocardial tissue. Intricate synchronization of contractions between different layers of myocytes in the tissue will be presented. The video-rate 3D microscopy opens new possibilities of imaging fast biological processes in living organisms. Confocal fluorescence microscopy is an invaluable tool to study biological systems at cellular level also thanks to the synthesis of always new specific fluorescent probes, e.g. multiprobe labelling enables complex system characterization. However, only the recent employment of narrowband tunable filters overcomes the problems due to the use of the broadband ones. The possibility of acquiring the emission spectra in a spatially resolved way extends simple image intensity studies into characterization of complex probeenvironment relationship through the sensitivity of fluorescence spectra to the local molecular environment differences. Consequently, fluorescence microspectroscopy (FMS) is able to provide the spectral information in a well defined spatial region allowing the researcher to simultaneously obtain spatial and spectroscopic information.

Surface contamination by bacteria is a natural and spontaneous process occurring in any natural environment on biotic (mucosa, tissues\u2026) and abiotic surfaces (medical equipments, food surfaces\u2026). Whatever the bacterial nature (Gram-positive or -negative), the environmental fluid (air, water, blood\u2026) and the receptor surface (implants, medical equipments, food surfaces\u2026), the surface contamination initiated by the first adherent bacteria can evolve to a three dimensional structure named biofilm (cohesive bacteria assembly ensured by an autoproduced extracellular organic matrix). The mechanisms by which these biofilms offer protective environment to viral particles or hypertolerance to antimicrobial action are not yet elucidated. To reach a better understanding of biofilm reactivity, we reported for the first time successful applications of correlative time-resolved optical microscopy approach by time-lapse (TL), FRAP, FCS, FLIM, for real-time analysis of molecular mobility and reaction inside biofilms.

The morphological data were used to precisely measure the glomerular volume in both sides of the brain, investigating the question of volumetric lateralization. Functional calcium imaging allowed to record the characteristic glomerular response maps to external odour stimuli applied to the bees' antennae.

The use of voltage sensitive fluorescent dyes (VSD) for noninvasive measurement of the action potential (AP) in blood perfused heart have been hindered by low interrogation depth, high absorption and auto-fluorescence of cardiac tissue. These limitations are diminished using new near infrared (NIR) VSD (di-4-ANBDQBS). Here we validated toxicity and photo-toxicity of these dyes in guinea pig and human cardiac muscle slabs. Application of NIR VSD showed no effect on cardiac muscle contraction force or relaxation. Optical action potentials closely tracked kinetics of microelectrode recorded APs in both field and electrode stimulated preparations. For phototoxicity assessment dye (50 lM) preloaded cardiac slabs were exposed to prolonged laser radiation of various power. Microelectrode AP recordings show that exposure to prolonged laser radiation (10min.; 2mW/mm 2 ) of dye loaded tissue had no statistically significant effect on APD50 or conduction velocity, thus indicating no or weak photo-toxicity on the NIR VSD. In contrast, exposure to 5 min. laser radiation of phototoxic dyes (mitotracker deep-red) preloaded tissue caused significant reduction in APD50 (by 13%) and conduction velocity (30%). Thus, due to the low photo-toxicity, NIR VSD are well suited for in vivo cardiac imaging. Streptomycesetes are filamentous Gram-positive soil bacteria well known for their complex morphological development and secondary metabolite production. During their life cycle spores germinate to form a network of hyphae, which later develops into aerial mycelium when cross-walls are generated and spores are formed.

The mobility and reaction parameters of molecules inside living cells can be conveniently measured using fluorescent probes. Typically fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) based on confocal microscopy is used for such measurements. This implies high time-resolution but only for a single spot at a time. In order to achieve a high time-resolution at multiple spots, we built a single plane illumination microscope (SPIM) equipped with high-speed image acquisition devices and a high-NA detection optics. This allows us to do parallel FCS measurements in a thin plane (width * 2-3 lm) of the sample. Our setup is equipped with a fast EMCCD camera (full frame time resolution 2000ls) and a 32932 pixel array of SPADs. The SPAD array has a full frame time resolution of 3-10ls, which is even fast enough to resolve the typical motion time-scale of small molecules (like eGFP) inside living cells. The performance of the system is characterized by diffusion measurements of water-soluble fluorescent beads, as well as FCS measurements in living cells. Our data acquisition system uses programmable hardware for some tasks and is fast enough to allow real-time correlation of 1024 pixels, as well as saving the complete dataset for later evaluation. Electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) covers a larger size range than any other technique in structural biology, from atomic resolution structures of membrane proteins, to large noncrystalline single molecules, entire organelles or even cells. Electron crystallography of two-dimensional (2D) crystals makes it possible to examine membrane proteins in the quasi-native environment of a lipid bilayer at high to moderately high resolution (1.8-8\u00c5 ). Recently, we have used electron crystallography to investigate functionally important conformational changes in membrane transport proteins such as the sodium/proton antiporters NhaA and NhaP, or the structure of channelrhodopsin. ''Single particle'' cryo-EM is well suited to study the structure of large macromolecular assemblies in the 3.3 to 20\u00c5 resolution range. A recent example is our 19\u00c5 map of a mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplex consisting of one copy of complex 1, two copies of complex III, and one of complex IV. The fit of the x-ray structures to our map indicates short pathways for efficient electron shuttling between complex I and III by ubiquinol, and between complex III and IV by cytochrome c. Electron cryo-tomography can visualize large protein complexes in their cellular context at 30-50\u00c5 resolution, and thus bridges the gap between protein crystallography and light microscopy. Cryo-ET is particularly suitable for studying biological membranes and large membrane protein complexes in situ. We found that long rows of ATP synthase dimers along ridges of inner membrane cristae are an ubiquitous feature of mitochondria from all 6 species we investigated (2 mammals, 3 fungi, 1 plant).

Hemozoin is formed during malaria infection of red blood cells, the malaria parasite cleaves hemoglobin, leaving free heme which is then toxic to the parasite. The free heme is then bio-crystalized to form hemozoin which allows the parasite to remain viable. The hemozoin is released during the breakdown of the red blood cells, is small and can be difficult to resolve spatially. Since it contains an abundance of heme protein, which has a strong absorbance at 532 nm, it can be readily detected and tracked by using resonant Raman scattering spectroscopy. Here we use slit-scanning confocal Raman imaging to detect the hemozoin and resolve it against the background molecules. Inside a red blood cell, hemoglobin is the strongest background signal since it also contains large amounts of heme. Nevertheless, the discrimination is possible, and the time-resolved observation of hemozoin is an important tool to understand effects of malaria since the hemozoin can trigger the immune response and cause inflammation in tissue. Muscle performance at the molecular level is determined by the elementary displacement (working stroke) produced by the motor protein myosin II, and its dependence on load. We developed a laser trap assay (the optical leash) capable of applying controlled loads to a single myosin head before the working stroke is initiated and probing actin-myosin interaction on the microsecond time scale. We found that the working stroke size depends both on load and on the detachment pathway followed by myosin. In a first pathway, myosin detaches very rapidly from actin (\\1ms) without producing any movement. In a second pathway, myosin steps and remains bound to actin for a time inversely proportional to ATP concentration; the working stroke remains constant (*5 nm) as the load is increased, until it suddenly vanishes as the isometric force is reached (5.7\u00b10.6pN). A third dissociation pathway becomes more populated as the force is increased, due to premature unbinding of myosin from actin, resulting in a working stroke that decreases with load. Taken together, these results give a new insight into the molecular mechanism of load dependence of the myosin working stroke, which is a primary determinant of skeletal muscle performance and efficiency.

Keeping the N-and C-terminal helices that constitute the shaft, we have replaced the middle *200 residues with a short helix-turn-helix motif borrowed from a different protein. The protrusion-less mutant thus made retained a high ATPase activity and rotated fast in the correct direction.

We tested the effect of oscillating electric (AC) field on V-ATPase activity in yeast vacuoles. The AC technique has several advantages over direct observations: it can be applied on native membranes, there are no labels and attachments involved, and the target protein is in its natural environment. This was/is the first of its kind of experiment on V-ATPase, and we got strikingly different results from previous studies on other proteins: Both low and high frequency AC field reduces ATPase activity in a wide frequency range. A sharp resonance is seen at 88.3 Hz, where the ATPase activity reaches or exceeds the control (no AC) level. We think that the resonance happens at that of the 60 degrees rotor steps, meaning that the rotation rate of the rotor is around 15 Hz, under the given conditions. Synchronisation of individual ATPases by slow or matching, but not fast AC is likely via a hold-and-release mechanism. We can explain the above observations by assuming that the AC field interacts with the proton movements, and if we consider the estimated geometry of the hydrophilic proton channels and the proton binding cites on the rotor.

The deuterium order parameter (S CD ) profile calculated by averaging all the lipids in the F o -bound bilayer was not very different from that of the pure bilayer system, which agrees with recent 2 H solid-state nmR experiments. However, by delineating the lipid properties according to their vicinity to F o , we found that the S CD profiles of different lipid shells are prominently different. Lipids close to F o formed a more ordered structure. Similarly, the lateral diffusion of lipids on the membrane surface also followed a shell-dependent behavior. The lipids in the proximity of F o exhibited very significantly reduced diffusional motion. The numerical value of S CD was anti-correlated with that of the diffusion coefficient, i.e., the more ordered lipid structures led to slower lipid diffusion. Our findings will not only help for elucidating the dynamics of F o depending on the protonation states and electric fields, but may also shed some light to the interactions between the motor F o and its surrounding lipids under physiological condition, which could help to rationalize its extraordinary energy conversion efficiency. This work has been published 1 in March 2010, and it was selected as one of the two Featured Articles of that issue. The research project is directed toward the construction of a synthetic bio-inorganic machine that consists in a single actin filament that interacts with a linear array of myosin II motors regularly disposed on a nano-structured device. The motor array is intended to simulate the unique properties of the ensemble of motor proteins in the half-sarcomere of the muscle by providing the condition for developing steady force and shortening by cyclic interactions with the actin filament. The mechanical outputs in the range 0.5-200 pN force and 1-10,000 nm shortening will be measured and controlled The bacterial flagellar motor is a membrane-embedded molecular machine that rotates filaments, providing a propulsive force for bacteria to swim. The molecular mechanism of torque (turning force) generation is being investigated through the study of the properties and three-dimensional structure of the motor's stator unit. We are taking both topdown and bottom-up approaches, combining data from the molecular genetics studies, cross-linking, X-ray protein crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations. We have recently determined the first crystal structure of the protein domain that anchors the proton-motive-force-generating mechanism of the flagellar motor to the cell wall, and formulated a model of how the stator attaches to peptidoglycan. The work presented at the meeting will inform the audience on our latest work that establishes the relationship between the structure, dynamics and function of a key component of the bacterial flagellar motor, the motility protein B (MotB). This work will be put in the perspective of the mechanism of rotation, stator assembly, anchoring to peptidoglycan and interaction with the rotor, and discussed in the light of the elementary events composing the cycle of electrochemical-to-mechanical energy conversion that drives flagellar rotation. Members of the conserved Kinesin-5 family fulfill essential roles in mitotic spindle morphogenesis and dynamics and were thought to be slow, processive microtubule (MT)-plusend directed motors. The mechanisms that regulate Kinesin-5 function are still not well understood. We have examined in vitro and in vivo functions of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Kinesin-5 Cin8 using single-molecule motility assays and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and found that Cin8 motility is exceptional in the Kinesin-5 family.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-357"}, {"text": "In vitro, individual Cin8 motors could be switched by ionic conditions from rapid (up to 50 lm/min) and processive minus-end, to bidirectional, to slow plus-end motion.

The entirely unexpected finding of switching of Cin8 directionality in vivo and in vitro demonstrates that the ''gear box'' of kinesins is much more complex and versatile than thought. Many biological motor molecules move within cells using stepsizes predictable from their structures. Myosin-VI, however, has much larger and more broadly-distributed stepsizes than those predicted from its short lever arms. We explain the discrepancy by monitoring Qdots and gold nano-particles attached to the myosin VI motor domains using high-sensitivity nano-imaging. The large stepsizes were attributed to an extended and relatively rigid lever arm; their variability to two stepsizes, one large (72 nm) and one small (44 nm). These results suggest there exist two tilt-angles during myosin-VI stepping, which correspond to the pre-and post-powerstrokes states and regulate the leading head. The large steps are consistent with the previously reported hand-over-hand mechanism, while the small steps follow an inchworm-like mechanism and increase in frequency with ADP. Switching between these two mechanisms in a strain sensitive, ADPdependent manner allows myosin-VI to fulfill its multiple cellular tasks including vesicle transport and membrane anchoring. http://www.fbs.osaka-u.ac.jp/labs/yanagida/, http:// www.qbic.riken.jp/. Ferritin deposits iron in oxyhydroxide iron core surrounded by protein shell. The iron core structure may vary in different ferritins in both normal and pathological cases. To study iron core variations the M\u00f6 ssbauer spectroscopy with a high velocity resolution was applied for comparative analysis of normal and leukemia chicken liver and spleen tissues, human liver ferritin and commercial pharmaceutical products Imferon, Maltofer\u00d2 and Ferrum Lek as ferritin models. M\u00f6 ssbauer spectra of these samples measured with a high velocity resolution at room temperature were fitted using two models: homogenous iron core (one quadrupole doublet) and heterogeneous iron core (several quadrupole doublets).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-357"}, {"text": "The results of both fits demonstrated small variations of M\u00f6 ssbauer hyperfine parameters related to structural variations of the iron cores.

Invasion of epithelial cells by Salmonella enterica is mediated by bacterial ''effector'' proteins that are delivered into the host cell by a type III secretion system (TTSS). The collaborative action of these translocated effectors modulates a variety of cellular processes leading to bacterial uptake into mammalian cells. Type III effectors require the presence in the bacterial cytosol of specific TTS chaperones. Effectors are known to interact with their chaperone via a Chaperone Binding Domain (CBD) situated at their N-terminus. This work focus on SopB, an effector with phosphoinositide phosphatase activity and particularly its interaction with the specific chaperone SigE by biochemical, biophysical and structural approaches. We have co-expressed SopB with its specific chaperone SigE and purified the complex, determined the limits of the CBD and purified the SopB CBD /SigE complex. The structure of SigE has been solved previously but no crystals could be obtained for structure determination of both complexes. We used SAXS experiment combined with biophysical approach to analyse the interaction between SopB and its chaperone as well as the quaternary structure on the complex that will be described in this presentation. Guanylate monophosphate kinase (GMPK) is a cytosolic enzyme involved in nucleotide metabolic pathways. One of the physiological roles of GMPKs is the reversible phosphoryl group transfer from ATP to GMP (its specific ligand), yielding ADP and GDP. The GMPK from Haemophilus influenzae is a small protein, with a number of 208 amino acids in the primary structure. In order to determine the secondary structure changes of this enzyme, as well as some physical characteristics of its complexes with GMP and ATP ligands, circular dichroism (CD) and ATR -FTIR studies were performed. The enzyme and its ligands were dissolved in Tris -HCl buffer, at pH 7.4 and 25\u00b0C. From the CD spectra the content of the secondary structure elements of GMPK and GMPK/GMP, GMPK/ATP (with and without Mg 2+ ) were determined. The major secondary structure elements of GMPK from Haemophilus influenzae were a-helix (* 37 %) and b-sheet (* 36 %). ATR -FTIR experiments show that the amide I and amide II bands of the GMPK are typical for a protein with great a-helix content. From the second derivative spectra, the content of the secondary structure elements were estimated. These data were in agreement with those obtained by CD. Assembly of the mature human immunodeficiency virus type 1 capsid involves the oligomerization of the capsid protein, CA. The C-terminal domain of CA, CTD, participates both in the formation of CA hexamers, and in the joining of hexamers through homodimerization. Intact CA and the isolated CTD are able to homodimerize in solution with similar affinity (dissociation constant in the order of 10 lM); CTD homodimerization involves mainly an a-helical region. In this work, we show that peptides derived from the dimerization helix (which keep residues energetically important for dimerization and with higher helical propensities than the wild-type sequence) are able to self-associate with affinities similar to that of the whole CTD. Moreover, the peptides have a higher helicity than that of the wild-type sequence, although is not as high as the theoretically predicted. Interesting enough, the peptides bind to CTD, but binding in all peptides, but one, does not occur at the dimerization interface of CTD (helix 9). Rather, binding occurs at the last helical region of CTD, even for the wild-type peptide, as shown by HSQC-NMR. As a consequence, all peptides, but one, are unable to inhibit capsid assembly of the whole CA in vitro. The peptide whose binding occurs at the CTD dimerization helix has an Val?Arg mutation in position 191, which has been involved in dimer-dimer contacts. These findings suggest that event keeping the energetically important residues to attain CTD dimerization within a more largely populated helical structure is not enough to hamper dimerization of CTD. PutP is an integral membrane protein located in the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli, being responsible for the coupled transport of Na + and proline. It belongs to the family of sodium solute symporters (SSS). Structural data for PutP is not available, but secondary structure predictions together with biochemical and biophysical analyses suggest a 13 transmembrane motif. From a recent homology model based on the X-ray structure of the related Na + /galactose symporter vSGLT, previously published electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies, and recent crystallographic and EPR studies on the cognate bacterial homolog of a neurotransmitter:Na + symporter, LeuT, it has been proposed that helices VIII and IX as well as the interconnecting ''loop 9'' region determine the accessibility of the periplasmic cavities which bind sodium and proline. We performed site-directed spin labeling of ''loop 9'' in combination with EPR spectroscopy to investigate the structural features of this region and possible conformational changes induced by sodium and proline. Analyses of spin label mobility and polarity as well as accessibility to paramagnetic quenchers allow us to refine this region in the present homology model. Furthermore, our data suggest conformational changes in this region upon substrate binding including an overall motion of a helical segment. Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABP) are a family of low molecular weight proteins that share structural homology and the ability to bind fatty acids. The common structural feature is a b-barrel of 10 antiparallel b-strands forming a large inner cavity that accommodates nonpolar ligands, capped by a portal region, comprising two short a-helices. B-FABP exhibits high affinity for the docosahexaenoic (DHA) and oleic acid (OA). It is also postulated that B-FABP may interact with nuclear receptors from PPAR family. In the present work, we used molecular biology and spectroscopic techniques to correlate structure, dynamics and function. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to produce 5 mutants of B-FABP with a nitroxide spin probe (MTSL) selectively attached to residues located at the portal region. ESR spectra of the labeled B-FABP mutants were sensitive to the location of the mutation and were able to monitor interactions in three cases: (1) sHSP are ubiquitous proteins involved in cellular resistance to various stress (oxidative, heat, osmotic\u2026). They are able to prevent aggregation of non-native proteins through the ability of forming large soluble complexes and preventing their nonspecific and insoluble aggregation. In consequence to this molecular chaperone function, they can regulate many processes (resistance to chemotherapy, modulation of the cellular adhesion and invasion, inflammatory response in skin), and the modulation of their expression has been found to be a molecular marker in cancers, spermatogenesis, or cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, they are involved in several pathologies: myopathies, neuropathies, cancers, cataracts. Among the 10 human members (HspB1-10), this study focused on HspB1 (Hsp27 involved in some cancers), HspB4 (lens specific), HspB5 (lens, muscle, heart, lung) and HspB5-R120G (responsible for a desmin-related myopathy and a cataract). As sHSP form large, soluble (but polydisperse in mammals) hetero-oligomers, molecular biology, biochemistry, biophysics and bioinformatics were successfully combined to compare the functional/dysfunctional assemblies in order to understand the critical parameters between sHSP members depending upon their tissue and cellular localization. Ionizing radiation is a type of radiation that contains enough energy to displace electrons and break chemical bonds. This can promote the removal of at least one electron from an atom or molecule, creating radical species, namely, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) [1, 2] . These are often associated with damages at cellular level, such as, DNA mutations, cell cycle modifications and, in animal cells, cancer. To overcome this problem, organisms developed different protection/repair mechanisms that enable them to survive to these threats. DNA glycosylases are enzymes that are part of base excision repair (BER) system, mainly responsible for DNA repair. They can recognize a DNA lesion and, in some cases, are able to remove the mutated base.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 8445, "end": 8448, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 8449, "end": 8451, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Structure of proteins and protein complexes"}, {"text": "Here we propose to study one of those enzymes, endonuclease III, which contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster [3, 4] .

Cholesterol is an essential constituent of the animal membrane cells. In order to study the interaction between Na,K-ATPase and cholesterol, we have used the DSC technique, and a proteoliposome system composed by the enzyme and DPPC:DPPE, with different percentage in mol of cholesterol. The heat capacity of purified Na,K-ATPase profile exhibits three transitions with 31, 189 and 60 kcal/mol at 55, 62 and 69\u00b0C. Multiple components in the unfolding transition could be attributed either to different steps in the pathway or to independent unfolding of different domains. This denaturation of Na,K-ATPase is an irreversible process. For the proteoliposome, we also observed three peaks, with 180, 217 and 41 kcal/mol and 54, 64 and 72\u00b0C. This increase in DH indicates that the lipids stabilize the protein. When cholesterol was used (from 10 to 40 mol %), the first transition was shifted to a lower temperature value around 35\u00b0C. These results confirm that cholesterol has an influence on the packing and fluidity of lipid bilayer and changes in lipid microenvironment alter the thermostability as well as the activity of Na,K-ATPase.

MFE-2 is a key enzyme in long-and branched-chain fatty acids breakdown in peroxisomes. It contains two enzymes in the same polypeptide and also consists of differing amount of domains depending on the species. Crystal structure and enzyme kinetics of Drosophila melanogaster MFE-2 has revealed the domain assembly and raised a question about existence of a substrate channeling mechanism. Small-angle x-ray scattering studies have further resolved the assembly of domains in the human MFE-2. Mutations in the MFE-2-coding gene in humans may cause D-bifunctional protein deficiency -a metabolic disease characterized by accumulation of fatty acyl-CoA intermediates due to inactive or residually active MFE-2 protein. We have also studied the structure, stability and dynamics of such mutant proteins both experimentally and in silico. The latest results on all these studies will be presented. FtsZ is a protein that plays a key role in bacterial division, forming a protein ring directly related to the constriction of the membrane. This process has been observed to occur without the help of molecular motors. Nonetheless, the details of the self-assembly and subsequent force generation of the septal ring are still obscure. AFM observations allows the study of the behaviour of FtsZ solutions on a substrate with unprecedented resolution, permitting the identification of individual protein filaments. The different resulting structures can be compared to Monte Carlo models for a 2D lattice accounting for the essential interactions between monomers. These include a strong longitudinal bond that allows a limited flexibility (i.e., curvature of the filaments) and a weaker lateral interaction. The work we present follows this approach, focussing on the latest experiments with FtsZ mutants. By using these mutants, it is possible to choose the specific region of the monomer that will anchor to the substrate, thus generating new structures that provide an insight into monomer-monomer interactions. In this way, we explore the anisotropy of the lateral bond in FtsZ, a factor that has not been taken into account before but may prove to be of importance in FstZ behaviour in vivo.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Structure of proteins and protein complexes"}, {"text": "Modeling protein structures and their complexes with limited experimental data Dominik Gront University of Warsaw, Pasteura 1, 02-093 Warsaw, Poland", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-384"}, {"text": "Conventional methods for protein structure determination require collecting huge amounts of high-quality experimental data.

The spectrum encodes only several independent degrees of freedom that provide a global description of a molecular geometry in a very synthetic way. In this contribution we utilized both local information obtained from nmR measurements and global description of a macromolecule as given by SAXS profile combined with a knowledge-based bimolecular force field to determine tertiary and quaternary structure of model protein systems.

An important nmR limiting step is the often fastidious assignment of the nmR spectra. For proteins whose 3D structures are already known, the matching of experimental and back-calculated data allows a straightforward assignment of the nmR spectra. We developed NOEnet, a structure-based assignment approach. It is based on a complete search algorithm, robust against assignment errors, even for sparse input data. It allows functional studies, like modeling of protein-complexes or protein dynamics studies for proteins as large as 28 kD. Almost any type of additional restraints can be used as filters to speed up the procedure or restrict the assignment ensemble. NOEnet being mainly based on nmR data (NOEs) orthogonal to those used in triple resonance experiments (Jcouplings), its combination even with a low number of ambiguous J-coupling based sequential connectivities yields a high precision assignment ensemble. We observed, that T. thermophilus isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IPMDH) has higher rigidity and lower enzyme activity at room temperature than its mesophilic counterpart (E. coli), while the enzymes have nearly identical flexibilities under their respective physiological working conditions, suggesting that evolutionary adaptation tends to maintain optimum activity by adjusting a ''corresponding state'' regarding conformational flexibility. In order to reveal the nature of the conformational flexibility change related to enzymatic activity, we designed a series of mutations involving non conserved prolines specific to thermophilic IPMDH. Proline to glycine mutations substantially increased conformational flexibility and decreased conformational stability. The mutant enzyme variants did not show enhanced catalytic activity, but the non Arrhenius temperature dependence of enzyme activity of the wild type was abolished. This phenomenon underlines the fact that the delicate balance between flexibility, stability and activity which is required for the environmental adaptation of enzymes can be easily disrupted with mutations even distant from the active site, providing further evidence that optimization of proper functional motions are also a selective force in the evolution of enzymes. The kinetoplastids Trypanosoma brucei, T. cruzi and Leishmania major are responsible for causing great morbidity and mortality in developing countries. The all a-helical dimeric dUTPases from these organisms represent promising drug targets due to their essential nature and markedly different structural and biochemical properties compared to the trimeric human enzyme. To aid in the development of dUTPase inhibitors we have been structurally characterizing the enzymes from these species. Here we present the structure of the T. brucei enzyme in open and closed conformations, completing the view of the enzymes from the kinetoplastids. Furthermore, we sought to probe the reaction mechanism for this family of enzymes as a mechanism has been proposed based on previous structural work but has not received any further verification. The proposed scheme is similar to that of the trimeric enzyme but differs in detail. Using tryptophan fluorescence quenching in the presence of the transition state mimic AlF 3 we have been able to identify which species is the likely transition state in the reaction. The crystal structure of T. brucei in complex with this transition state analogue confirms the nature of the nucleophilic attack clearly showing how it differs from trimeric enzymes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Laboratoire de Chimie et Biologie Structurales, ICSN-CNRS, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"}, {"text": "The structure of factor H-C3d complex explains regulation of immune complement alternative pathway Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is a widely used technique for studying the secondary structure (SS) of proteins. Numerous algorithms have been developed for the estimation of the SS composition from the CD spectra. Although, these methods give more or less accurate estimation for proteins rich in a-helical structure, they often fail to provide acceptable results on mixed or b-rich proteins. The problem arises from the diversity of b-structures, which is thought to be an intrinsic limitation of the technique. The worst predictions are provided for proteins of unusual b-structures and for amyloid fibrils. Our aim was to develop a new algorithm for the more accurate estimation of SS contents for a broader range of protein folds with special interest to amyloid fibrils. Using synchrotron radiation CD (SRCD), we were able to collect high quality spectra of amyloid fibrils with good S/N ratios down to 175nm. The novel reference dataset with spectra that significantly differ from present reference sets, extends the information content for SS determination.

The Type III Secretion System (T3SS) is a complex molecular machine that is a key virulence determinant for important Gram-negative pathogens including Shigella, Yersinia and Salmonella species [1] [2] . The T3SS consists of multiple copies of *25 different proteins (totalling *7MDa), spans both bacterial membranes and drives insertion of a contiguous pore into the host-cell membrane. Virulence factors are secreted via this apparatus directly into the host cell. In all T3SS various levels of regulation occur with switching between secretion off and on states overlaid on control of which substrates are secreted. Genes involved in a variety of these switches have been identified but the molecular mechanisms underlying these functions is poorly understood. We are studying the T3SS of Shigella flexneri, the causative agent of dysentery and will present the structure of the so-called ''gatekeeper protein'' MxiA. The diacylglycerolacyltransferase1 (DGAT1) is an integral protein from the reticulum endoplasmic membrane that plays an essential role in triacylglyceride synthesis. In cattle, this enzyme is associated to the fat content regulation on milk and meat. In this study, synthetic peptides corresponding to both DGAT1 binding sites (Sit1 and Sit2) were designed, purified and employed to investigate the enzyme interaction with substrates and membrane models. Different binding specificities in the interaction with phospholipid vesicles and micelles were noted. Sit1 showed to bind more strongly in nonpolar membrane models, while Sit2 was electrostatically attracted to negative phospholipid surfaces. The binding of both peptides was followed by significant conformational changes (like unordered to helix transition) in circular dichroism spectra and a 20nm blue shift in fluorescence emission. The binding of Sit1 and Sit2 peptides to negative liposome gave dissociation constants (K D ) of 170 and 0.44lM, respectively, and a leakage action 24-fold higher to Sit2. The difference in specificity is related to the features of the putative substrates (acyl-CoAs and diacylglycerol) and can be attributed to the distinct role of each DGAT1 binding site during lipid synthesis. Supported by FAPESP. FtsZ, the bacterial homologue of tubulin, assembles into polymers in the bacterial division ring. The interfaces between monomers include a GTP molecule, although the relationship between polymerization and GTPase activity is still controversial. A set of short FtsZ polymers were modelled and the formation of active GTPase structures was monitored using molecular dynamics. Only the interfaces nearest the polymer ends exhibited geometry adequate for GTP hydrolysis. Conversion of a mid-polymer interface to a close-to-end interface resulted in its spontaneous rearrangement from an inactive to an active conformation. Fluorescent proteins (FPs) have become extremely valuable tools in the life sciences. Due to the latest advances in the light microscopy, there is a steady need for FPs with improved spectral properties. mIrisFP is a monomeric FP that can be switched reversibly between a bright green fluorescent and a dark state by illumination with light of specific wavelengths [1] . Structurally, this photo-switching is based on a cis-trans isomerization of the chromophore. Upon illumination with violet light, mIrisFP can be irreversibly photoconverted from the green-emitting to a red-emitting form. The red form can again be switched reversibly between a fluorescent and a dark state. To elucidate the mechanistic details of the photoinduced reactions, we have generated mIrisGFP1. This variant can still undergo reversible photoswitching, but lacks the ability to photoconvert to the red state so that the photoinduced transitions of the green form can be studied without 'artifacts' due to green-to-red photoconversion. Using UV/visible spectroscopy, we have characterized the on-and off-switching processes in great detail. Several light-activated reaction pathways have been identified. They are highly intertwined so that the net effect achieved with light of a particular wavelength depends on the relative probabilities to photoinduce the various processes. Phosducin (Pd) is a G t bc-binding protein that is highly expressed in photoreceptors. Pd is phosphorylated in dark-adapted retina and is dephosphorylated in response to light. Dephosphorylated Pd binds G t protein bc-heterodimer with high affinity and inhibits its interaction with G t a or other effectors, whereas phosphorylated Pd does not. Therefore Pd down-regulates the light response in photoreceptors. Phosphorylation of Pd at S54 and S73 leads to the binding of the 14-3-3 protein. The 14-3-3 proteins function as scaffolds modulating the activity of their binding partners and their role in Pd regulation is still unclear. The 14-3-3 protein binding may serve to sequester phosphorylated Pd from G t bc or to decrease the rate of Pd dephosphorylation and degradation. We performed several biophysical studies of the 14-3-3:Pd complex. Analytical ultracentrifugation was used to determine the complex stoichiometry and dissociation constant. Conformational changes of Pd induced both by the phosphorylation itself and by 14-3-3 binding were studied using the time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. M\u00f6 ssbauer spectroscopy with a high velocity resolution was used for comparative study of various oxyhemoglobins for analysis of the heme iron electronic structure and protein structure-function relationship. Samples of pig, rabbit and normal human oxyhemoglobins and oxyhemoglobins from patients with chronic myeloleukemia and multiple myeloma were measured using M\u00f6 ssbauer spectrometric system with a high velocity resolution at 90 K. M\u00f6 ssbauer spectra were fitted using two models: one quadrupole doublet (model of equivalent iron electronic structure in a-and b-subunits of hemoglobins) and superposition of two quadrupole doublets (model of non-equivalent iron electronic structure in a-and b-subunits of hemoglobins). In both models small variations of M\u00f6 ssbauer hyperfine parameters (quadrupole splitting and isomer shift) were observed for normal human, rabbit and pig oxyhemoglobins and related to different heme iron stereochemistry and oxygen affinity. Small variations of M\u00f6 ssbauer hyperfine parameters for oxyhemoglobins from patients were related to possible variations in the heme iron stereochemistry and function. The different types of silk produced by orb-weaving spiders display various mechanical properties to fulfill diverse functions. For example, the dragline silk produced by the major ampulate glands exhibits high toughness that comes from a good trade-off between stiffness and extensibility. On the other hand, flagelliform silk of the capture spirals of the web is highly elastic due to the presence of proline and glycine residues. These properties are completely dictated by the structural organization of the fiber (crystallinity, degree of molecular orientation, secondary structure, microstructure), which in turn results from the protein primary structure and the mechanism of spinning. Although the spinning process of dragline silk begins to be understood, the molecular events occurring in the secretory glands and leading to the formation of other silk fibers are unknown, mainly due to a lack of information regarding their initial and final structures.

The Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE) is a multiligand cell surface receptor involved in various human diseases. The major alternative splice product of RAGE comprises its extracellular region that occurs as a soluble protein (sRAGE). Although the structures of sRAGE domains were available, their assembly into the functional full length protein remained unknown. Here we employed synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering to characterize the solution structure of human sRAGE. The protein revealed concentration-dependent oligomerization behaviour, which was also mediated by the presence of Ca 2+ ions. Rigid body models of monomeric and dimeric sRAGE were obtained from the scattering data recorded at different solvent conditions. The monomer displays a J-like shape while the dimer is formed through the association of the two N-terminal domains and has an elongated structure. The results provided insight into the assembly of i) the heterodimer sRAGE:RAGE, which is responsible for blockage of the receptor signalling, and ii) RAGE homodimer, which is necessary for signal transduction, paving the way for the design of therapeutical strategies for a large number of different pathologies. ClpB is a hexameric AAA? ATPase that extracts unfolded polypeptides from aggregates by threading them through its central pore. The contribution of coiled-coil M domains is fundamental for the functional mechanism of this chaperone, and its location within the protein structure in previous structural models is contradictory. We present cryo-electron microscopy structural analysis of ClpB from E. coli in several nucleotide states. The study reveals a novel architecture for ClpB and shows that M domains form an internal scaffold located in the central chamber of ClpB hexamers. This inner structure transmits local signals due to ATP binding and hydrolysis by AAA? domains.

Sporulation in Bacillus subtilis begins with an asymmetric cell division producing a smaller cell called the forespore, which initially lies side-by-side with the larger mother cell. In a phagocytosis-like event, the mother cell engulfs the forespore so that the latter is internalised as a cell-within-a-cell. Engulfment involves the migration of the mother cell membrane around the forespore until the leading edges of this engulfing membrane meet and fuse. This releases the forespore, now surrounded by a double membrane, into the mother cell cytoplasm. Membrane migration during engulfment is facilitated by the interacting proteins SpoIIQ and SpoIIIAH that are membrane-associated and expressed in the forespore and the mother cell respectively 1 . They interact in the intercellular space and function initially as a molecular zipper and later they participate in a more elaborate complex in which SpoIIQ and SpoIIIAH are integral components of an intercellular channel. This channel is a topic of much current interest, having initially been proposed as a conduit for the passage from the mother cell to the forespore of a specific, but putative, regulator of the RNA polymerase sigma factor, r G 2 and later as a gap junction-like feeding tube 3 through which the mother cell supplies molecules for the biosynthetic needs of the forespore. Here we present data on the structure and interactions of SpoIIQ and SpoIIIAH gleaned from biophysical methods and protein crystallography. These data lead to a plausible model for the intercellular channel. The glycine receptor (GlyR) is a chloride permeable ligand gated ion channel and that can mediate synaptic inhibition. Due to a possible involvement in the pathophysiology of temporal lobe epilepsy, the different properties of GlyRs containing alpha3L and K subunit isoforms are currently investigated. Previous characterizations of homomeric receptors consisting of these isoforms have shown a difference in their electrophysiological properties and their membrane distribution as observed by diffraction-limited fluorescence microscopy. We studied these isoforms, when separately expressed in transfected HEK 293T cells, by using single molecule tracking (SMT) in living cells and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) on fixated cells. For both techniques the GlyRs are stained using a primary antibody directly labeled with Alexa Fluor dyes. The dSTORM experiments support the observation that alpha3L GlyR are clustered, while the alpha3K GlyRs are more uniformly spread. The analysis of the short range diffusion coefficients obtained by SMT reveals the presence of heterogeneous motion for both isoforms. The K-isoform has a higher fraction of fast diffusion. In contrast, the L-isoform is more associated with slow diffusion and appears to undergo hindered diffusion. Since nanoparticles are suitable for tumor therapy due to their passive targeting to cancer cells by enhanced permeability and retention effect [1] , it is important to understand mechanisms of their delivery into the living cancer cells. In this respect we have developed a modular spectral imaging system based on a white light spinning disk confocal fluorescence microscope and a narrow tunable emission filter. Firstly, interaction of polymer nanoparticles and cells labeled with spectrally overlapping probes was examined. The use of fluorescence microspectroscopy (FMS) allowed co-localization, which showed that the size of polymer nanoparticles strongly influences their transfer across the cell plasma membrane. Next, the delivery of liposomes (composed of cancerostatic alkylphospholipid (OPP) and cholesterol) labeled with environment-sensitive fluorescent probe was monitored. We were able to detect a very small shift in emission spectra of cholesterol-poor OPP liposomes inside and outside the cells, which would not be possible without the use of FMS. This shift implies that the delivery of these liposomes into cancer cells is based on fusion with the cell membrane [2] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3876, "end": 3879, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4915, "end": 4918, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-407"}, {"text": "[ High-resolution optical imaging techniques make now accessible the detection of nanofeatures in bio-and soft-matter by non-ionizing visible radiation.

These fluorophores report on fast subtle changes of their nanoscale environment at excited state and are meant to fulfill these requirements: a) optical responses (intensity, wavelength-shift, lifetime, anisotropy) predictably related to the environmental polarity, viscosity, macromolecular structure, b) high brightness allowing for single-molecule detection, c) easily conjugable to biomolecules or macromolecules of interest. Notably, we aim at conjugating these properties with the capability of nanoscopy imaging based on Stimulated Emission Depletion or Stochastic Reconstruction Optical Microscopy.

Foamy virus (FV) is an atypical retrovirus which shares similarities with HIV and hepatitis B viruses. Despite numerous biochemical studies, its entry pathway remains unclear, namely membrane fusion or endocytosis. To tackle this issue, dual color fluorescent viruses were engineered with a GFP labeled capsid and a mCherry labeled envelope. Using high resolution 3D imaging and 3D single virus tracing, we followed the entry of the fluorescent viruses in living cells with a precision of 30nm in the plane and 40 nm along the optical axis. To distinguish between the two possible pathways, we developed a novel colocalization analysis method for determining the moment along every single trace where the colors separate, i.e. the fusion event.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-407"}, {"text": "The combination of this dynamical colocalization information with the instantaneous velocity of the particle and its position within the reconstructed 3D cell shape allows us to determine whether the separation of capsid and envelope happens at the cell membrane or from endosomes.

Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P 2 ) is a minor component of the plasma membrane known to a critical agent in the regulation of synaptic transmission. Clustering of PI(4,5)P 2 in synaptic active zones is important for synaptic transmission. However, PI(4,5)P 2 does not spontaneously segregate in fluid lipid membranes and another mechanism must be responsible for the lateral segregation of this lipid in active zones. Clustering of PI(4,5)P 2 is expected to be associated with lipid-protein interactions and possibly partition towards lipid rafts in the plasma membrane. Here we analyze the influence of protein palmitoylation on the formation of PI(4,5)P 2 clusters and on synaptic protein-PI(4,5)P 2 interaction by means of F\u00f6 rster resonance energy transfer measurements by fluorescence lifetime imaging (FRET-FLIM) and FRET confocal microscopy. . During sporulation an entire chromosome is transferred into the forespore. This process starts by the formation of an asymmetrically located division septum that leads to the formation of two unequally sized compartments: a large mothercell and a smaller forespore. The septum traps about 30% of the chromosome to be transferred into the forespore. The remaining (*3Mbp) are then translocated from the mother cell into the forespore by an active mechanism involving the Spo-IIIE DNA translocase. The mechanisms of translocation, particularly the control of the directionality, still remains unknown and various models have been proposed so far. Since each model predicts very different distribution of SpoIIIE proteins at the sporulation septum, we used PALM microscopy (photoactivated localization microscopy) to investigate proteins localization in live-sporulating bacteria. Using this technique, we showed that SpoIIIE proteins are forming a single tight focus at the septum with a characteristic size of around 30nm. More surprising, the focus is usually localized in the mother cell compartment and the mean distance between the SpoIIIE focus and the septum is 35nm. Our data suggest that during the translocation process, SpoIIIE proteins are only forming stable complexes on the mother cell side, allowing then for a control of the chromosome translocation from the mother cell to the forespore. Morphogenetic gradients determine cell identity in a concentration-dependent manner and do so in a way that is both incredibly precise and remarkably robust. In order to understand how they achieve this feat, one needs to establish the sequence of molecular mechanisms starting with morphogen gradient formation and leading to the expression of downstream target genes. In fruit flies, the transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd) is a crucial morphogen that forms an exponential concentration gradient along the embryo AP axis and turns on cascades of target genes in distinct anterior domains. We measured Bcd-EGFP mobility in live D. melanogaster embryos using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. We found that Bcd-EGFP molecules had a diffusion coefficient on the order of * 7 lm 2 /s during nuclear cycles 12-14, both in the cytoplasm and in nuclei.

The first project looks at the changes in the organisation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on the cell surface of macrophages upon activation via Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as it is currently not known whether a higher level of TLR4 organisation is required for the signalling process. Macrophages natively express TLR4 at a low level which allows for oligomerisation to be analysed in live cells by dynamic single molecule colocalisation (DySCo) using data obtained by totalinternal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy.

In a world, were inertia cannot be used for propulsion, in a world at low Reynolds numbers, most of our everyday strategies of self-propulsion do not work. One class of parasites that know their way around, the flagellate Trypansome, manage not only to survive in the blood stream, which is a lot faster than its own propulsion velocity and where the Trypanosome is constantly attacked by its host's immune response, but also to penetrate the bloodbrain-barrier, which actually should be to tight to enter. Even though Trypanosomes are known for more than 100 years, their motility behaviour is not completely elucidated yet. Now, using high-speed darkfield-microscopy in combination with optical tweezers in microfluidic devices and analyzing the recorded data, new light has been shed on the motility of these parasites. Astonishing results show that Trypanosomes are very well adapted to their hosts environment, they even can abuse red blood cells for their self-propulsion and use the bloodstream itself to drag antibodies bound to their surface to their cell mouth, where the antibodies are endocytosed and digested.

Kuimova Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, Exhibition Road, SW7 2AZ, UK Viscosity is one of the main factors which influence diffusion in condensed media and is crucial for cell function. However, mapping viscosity on a single-cell scale is a challenge. We have imaged viscosity inside live cells using fluorescent probes, called molecular rotors, in which the speed of rotation about a sterically hindered bond is viscosity-dependent [1] [2] [3] . This approach enabled us to demonstrate that viscosity distribution in a cell is highly heterogeneous and that the local microviscosity in hydrophobic cell domains can be up to 1009 higher than that of water. We demonstrated that the intracellular viscosity increases dramatically during light activated cancer treatment, called Photodynamic therapy (PDT) [2] . We also demonstrated that the ability of a fluorophore to induce apoptosis in cells during PDT [4] , or to act as a benign molecular rotor, measuring viscosity, can be controlled by carefully selecting the excitation wavelength in viscous medium [5] . In the field of biophysics and nanomedicine, the cellular reaction and the kinetics of gene expression after transfection of live cells with plasmid DNA or gene-silencing siRNA is of great interest. In a previous study on the transfection kinetics of non-viral gene-transfer [1] we realised that the development of single-cell arrays would be a great step towards easy-to-analyse, high-throughput transfection studies. The regular arrangement of single cells would overcome the limitations in image-analysis that arise from whole populations of cells. In addition to that, the analysis of expression kinetics at the single-cell can help to identify the cell-to-cell variability within a cell population. In order to develop suitable single-cell arrays, we are currently adjusting the different parameters of such a microenvironment (e.g. size, shape, surface-functionalisation) in order to end up with a defined surrounding for single-cell transfection studies. In addition to that, we try to find the optimal uptake pathway for each of the different applications. The neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes cognitive impairment such as loss of episodic memory with ultimately fatal consequences. Accumulation and aggregation of two proteins in the brain -amyloid beta and tau -is a characteristic feature. These soluble proteins aggregate during the course of the disease and assemble into amyloid-like filaments. Recently it was found that the toxicity of soluble amyloid beta oligomers must also be taken into account for the pathogenesis of cognitive failure in AD. If oligomers are the predominant toxic species it would be pertinent to determine how they disrupt and impair neuronal function. The prion protein (PrP) receptor has been proposed to mediate amyloid beta binding to neuronal cells. We have characterised the interaction of the amyloid beta and the PrP receptor expressed on hippocampal and neuroblastoma cells at the single-molecule level. We do not detect any colocalisation of either the 40 or 42 amino acids variants with the PrP receptor. Bacterial biofilms are of the utmost importance in the study of environmental bioremediation and the design of materials for medical applications. The understanding of the mechanisms that govern cell adhesion must be analysed from the physics point of view in order to obtain quantitative descriptors. The genus Rhodococcus is widely spread in natural environments. The species are metabolically diverse and thus they can degrade a wide range of pollutants. Due to their high hydrophobicity, these cells are very resistant to harsh conditions, are able to degrade hydrophobic substances (e.g. oil) and attach to high-contact angle surfaces. The hydrophobicity of several strains of Rhodococcus is measured and mapped using Chemical Force Microscopy (CFM) in the present study. CFM relies on the functionalisation of Scanning Force Microscopy (SFM) tips using hydrophobic or hydrophilic groups. In CFM, the microscope is operated in the forcevolume mode, which combines adhesion data with topographic images. The careful control of the tip chemistry permits the study of interactions between the functional groups on the tip and the bacterial surface, thus allowing the assessment of hydrophobicity. In order to perform a CFM study, the cells need to be firmly anchored to a substrate under physiological conditions (i.e. under a nutrient media or a saline buffer). To this end, several adhesive surfaces have been tested in order to find the one that gives the best results. Optical microscopy is arguably the most important technique for the study of living systems because it allows 3D imaging of cells and tissues under physiological conditions under minimally invasive conditions. Conventional far-field microscopy is diffraction-limited; only structures larger than *200 nm can be resolved, which is insufficient for many applications. Recently, techniques featuring image resolutions down to *20 nm have been introduced such as localization microscopy (PALM, STORM) and reversible saturable optical fluorescent transition microscopy (RESOLFT, STED). These methods are well suited for live-cell imaging and narrow the resolution gap between light and electron microscopy significantly. We have used PALM imaging to study the formation and disassembly of focal adhesions of live HeLa cells in a high resolution pulse-chase experiment using monomeric IrisFP [1] . mIrisFP is a photoactivatable fluorescent protein that combines irreversible photoconversion from a green-to a red-emitting form with reversible photoswitching between a fluorescent and a nonfluorescent state in both forms. In our experiments a subpopulation of mIrisFP molecules is photoconverted to the red form by irradiating a specified region of the cell with a pulse of violet light. Migration of tagged proteins out of the conversion region can be studied by subsequently localizing the proteins in other regions of the cell by PALM imaging, now using the photoswitching capability of the red species. Real-time image reconstruction developed in our lab [2] allowed instant control imaging parameters. Live cell imaging of cancer cells is often used for in-vitro studies in connection with photodynamic diagnostic and therapy (PDD and PDT). Especially in presence of a photosensitizer, this live cell imaging can only be performed over relatively short duration (at most 1 hour). This restriction comes from the light-induced cell damages (photodamages) that result from rapid fluorescence photobleaching of photosensitizer. While these studies reveal exciting results, it takes several hours to discover the detailed effects of the photosensitizer on cell damage. Up to our knowledge, however, there is no general guideline for modification of excitation light dose to achieve that. In this paper, the relation between excitation light doses, photobleaching of photosensitizer (PVP-Hyperycin) and cell vitality are investigated using human lung epithelial carcinoma cells (A549). The strategy of this paper is to reduce the excitation light dose by using a low-power pulsed blue LED such that the structures are visible in time-lapse images. Fluorescence signals and image quality are improved by labelling the cells with an additional non-toxic marker called carboxyfluorescein-diacetate-succinimidyl-ester (CFSE). In total we collected 2700 time-lapse images (time intervals 2 min) of dual-marked A549 cells under three different light intensities (1.59, 6.34 and 14.27 mW/cm 2 ) and a variety of pulse lengths (0.127, 1.29, 13, 54.5 and 131 ms) over five hours. We have found that there is a nonlinear relationship between the amount of excitation light dose and cell vitality. Cells are healthy, i.e. they commence and complete mitosis, when exposed to low light intensities and brief pulses of light. Light intensities higher than 6.34 mW/cm 2 together with pulse durations longer than 13 ms often cause cell vesiculation, blebbing and apoptosis. In all other cases, however, we found no cell death. In the future, this striking nonlinearity will be studied in more detail. Progressive advances in scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) [1] enabled us to convert ordinary scanning probe microscope (SPM) in to versatile multifunctional technique. As an imaging tool, ion conductance microscopy is capable to deliver highest possible topographical resolution on living cell membranes among any other microscopy techniques [2] . Also, it can visualize surfaces complexity of those makes them impossible to image by other SPMs [3] . Ion conductance microscopy combined with a battery of powerful methods such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) [4] , patch-clamp, force mapping, localized drug delivery, nano-deposition and nano-sensing is unique among current imaging techniques. The rich combination of ion conductance imaging with other imaging techniques such as laser confocal and electrochemical [5] will facilitate the study of living cells and tissues at nanoscale. ) and coleoptiles of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings, which were growing in light and dark conditions, were used to determine fluorescence of whole cells.

We observed that BGF, RF and FRF intensity increased in the first leaves with the age of the seedlings. In the coleoptiles was observed great BGF intensity increase with the age of the seedlings. In the coleoptiles decreased RF intensity of the 144 and 196 hours old seedlings, and BGF intensity decreased of 196 hours old seedlings. It was found that emission spectrum and fluorescence intensity changes are induced by the lack of light and salt (NaCl) stress.

Live cell imaging techniques such as fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy (FPALM) are currently limited to dual-colour detection due to the restricted availability of red-fluorescent photoswitchable proteins. We employed photoswitching of the oxazine dye ATTO655 under reducing conditions for super-resolution imaging in the cytoplasm of living cells. For efficient and specific covalent labelling of target proteins, we have made use of the HaloTag system. ATTO655 was coupled to the HaloTag Ligand (HTL) and fast reaction of HTL-ATTO655 with the HaloTag enyzme was confirmed in vitro by solid phase binding assays. Efficient labelling of the membrane cytoskeleton using Lifeact fused to the HaloTag was observed and super-resolution imaging was readily achieved. Based on this approach, we managed to follow the nanoscale dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton as well as clathrincoated pits using clathrin light chain fused to the HaloTag. We combined this technique with FPALM for triplecolour super-resolution imaging of the spatial distribution of membrane receptors in context of the membrane skeleton. The ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases consists of four transmembrane proteins that transduce signals across the membrane to control cell fate. Growth factor binding results in homo-and hetero-interactions between these receptors at the membrane. ErbB receptors are implicated in many cancers, making them a target for therapeutic drugs. To date, studies of ErbB interactions have been limited to individual family members or specific pairs, giving an incomplete picture of the highly complex behaviour controlling positive and negative feedback loops and signalling outcomes. To investigate ErbB receptor interactions, we have developed TIRF-based single molecule fluorescence microscopes capable of simultaneously imaging three, and soon five, fluorescence probes in live cells. We have also developed a catalogue of extrinsic fluorescent probes for 1:1 labelling of both endogenous and transfected ErbB family members in mammalian cells, plus a Bayesian approach to the analysis of single molecule data. This allows us to track active and inactive ErbB family members at the basal surface of a model breast cancer cell line that expresses physiological levels of all four receptors. We present here initial characterisation of the entire ErbB family together in the cell membrane. The human genome contains more than 800 G proteincoupled receptors (GPCRs); overall, 3-4% of the mammalian genome encodes these molecules. Processes controlled by GPCRs include neurotransmission, cellular metabolism, secretion, and immune responses. However it is the stoichiometry of these receptors that is the most controversial. The starting point for understanding GPCR function was the idea that these receptors are monomeric. On the other hand a lot of recent studies favour the concept that GPCR form dimers and are not capable of signalling as independent monomers. Recent single molecule studies try to solve this dilemma by suggesting that GPCRs form transient dimers with a lifetime of *100 ms. However questions remain about the physiological relevance of the preparations necessary for these studies, since they have not been performed on endogenous receptors. Here, we directly image individual endogenous receptors using an equimolar mixture of two colour fluorescent Fab fragments. We can then determine the receptors stoichiometry by quantifying its dynamic single molecule colocalisation (Dy-SCo) recorded by total-internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. We have recently investigated the domain dynamics of PGK (1) . Structural analysis by small angle neutron scattering revealed that the structure of the holoprotein in solution is more compact as compared to the crystal structure, but would not allow the functionally important phosphoryl transfer between the substrates, if the protein would be static. Brownian large scale domain fluctuations on a timescale of 50 ns was revealed by neutron spin echo spectroscopy. The observed dynamics shows that the protein has the flexibility to allow fluctuations and displacements that seem to enable function.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 4122, "end": 4125, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O-437"}, {"text": "[ Many physiological and pathological processes involve insertion and translocation of soluble proteins into and across biological membranes. However, the molecular mechanisms of protein membrane insertion and translocation remain poorly understood. Here, we describe the pH-dependent membrane insertion of the diphtheria toxin T domain in lipid bilayers by specular neutron reflectometry and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. We gained unprecedented structural resolution using contrast-variation techniques that allow us to propose a sequential model of the membrane-insertion process at angstrom resolution along the perpendicular axis of the membrane. At pH 6, the native tertiary structure of the T domain unfolds, allowing its binding to the membrane. The membrane-bound state is characterized by a localization of the C-terminal hydrophobic helices within the outer third of the cis fatty acyl-chain region, and these helices are oriented predominantly parallel to the plane of the membrane. In contrast, the amphiphilic N-terminal helices remain in the buffer, above the polar headgroups due to repulsive electrostatic interactions. At pH 4, repulsive interactions vanish; the N-terminal helices penetrate the headgroup region and are oriented parallel to the plane of the membrane. The C-terminal helices penetrate deeper into the bilayer and occupy about two thirds of the acyl-chain region. These helices do not adopt a transmembrane orientation. Interestingly, the T domain induces disorder in the surrounding phospholipids and creates a continuum of water molecules spanning the membrane. We propose that this local destabilization permeabilizes the lipid bilayer and facilitates the translocation of the catalytic domain across the membrane.

The formation of rods is related to the low volumetric ratio between the polar head and hydrophobic tail. The surfactant bearing two Glucose moieties is the most promising one, leading to both homogeneous and stable complexes for both BR and the b 6 f. It was also shown be of particular interest for the structural investigation of membrane proteins using SANS (3). By combining elastic and quasi-elastic neutron scattering data, and by applying theory originally developed to investigate dynamics in glassy polymers, we have shown that in lyophilised apoferritin above T * 100 K the dynamic response observed in the pico-to nano-second time regime is driven by CH 3 dynamics alone, where the methyl species exhibit a distribution of activation energies. Our results suggest that over the temporal and spatial range studied the main apoferritin peptide chain remains rigid. Interestingly, similar results are reported for other smaller, more flexible lyophilised bio-materials.

We found that hydration level dependence of the onset of the protein dynamical transition is correlated with the hydration water network. Hydration water dynamics change above the threshold hydration level, and water dynamics control protein dynamics. These findings lead to the conclusion that the hydration water network formation is an essential property that activates the anharmonic motions of a protein, which are responsible for protein function. Thermal motions and stability of hemoglobin of three endotherms (platypus -Ornithorhynchus anatinus, domestic chicken -Gallus gallus domesticus and human -Homo sapiens) and an ectotherm (salt water crocodile -Crocodylus porosus) were investigated using neutron scattering and circular dichroism.

The microfluidic setup consists of a controlling channel to which microchambers of different shapes and sizes are connected through narrow channels. This design results in having mainly convective transport in the controlling channel and diffusive transport into the microchamber. Rhodamine labeled actin monomers diffuse into the chamber. After polymerization is induced, they form a confined entangled network. Cross-linking proteins can then be added to increase the network complexity. Moreover, we can generate gradients of reactants across the microchambers and Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is a crucial regulator of actin dynamics. It is important in cellular processes such as axon guidance and migration, promoting assembly of filopodia and lamellipodia. VASP's multiple domain structure increases the range of interactions it has with actin monomers, filaments, and other proteins and it displays multiple binding modes both in vitro and in vivo, including barbed end elongation and filament bundling. However, it is not fully understood how VASP affects the structural and mechanical properties of actin networks. We characterize VASP-mediated bundling of actin networks in a simplified in vitro system using confocal microscopy and quantify mechanical properties with rheology measurements. We show that the network properties differ from other actin bundling proteins and reflect VASP's multiple domain structure, displaying a complex bundling phase space that depends upon solution conditions. We observe the formation of large bundle aggregates accompanied by a reduction in network elasticity at high protein ratios.

The mortality of solid tumors is mostly due to the metastatic potential of tumor cells which requires a fine adjustment between cell migration and cell proliferation. As the metabolic processes in the cell provide a limited amount of available energy (i.e. ATP) the various biological processes like cell motility or DNA synthesis compete for the ATP available. The go or grow hypothesis postulates that tumor cells show either high migration or proliferation potential. In our study we investigate on a large series of tumor cell lines whether this assumption stands for malignant cells. Materials and methods: Twenty tumor cell lines derived from malignant mesothelioma (mesodermal origin) and malignant melanoma (neuroectodermal origin) were subjected to three-days-long time-lapse videomicroscopic recordings. Cell motility and proliferation were characterized by the probability of cell division within 24 hours and the 24-hour migration distance of the cells. Results: We found a wide range in both the cell migratory activity and the proliferation capacity in our series. The 24-hour migration distance ranged from 40 to 300 micron and from 10 to 130 micron in mesothelioma and melanoma cells, respectively. The lowest 24-hour cell division probability was found to be 0.21 in both the melanoma and mesothelioma series while the highest proliferation activity reached 1.1 and 1.4 in melanoma and mesothelioma, respectively. Interestingly, in the melanoma cell lines we found a significant positive correlation (r=0,6909; p=0,0186) between cell proliferation and cell migration. In contrast our mesothelioma cell lines displayed no correlation between these two cellular processes. Conclusions: In summary our findings demonstrate that the investigated tumor cells do not defer cell proliferation for cell migration. Important to note the tumor cells derived from various organ systems may differ in terms of regulation of cell migration and cell proliferation. Furthermore our observation is in line with the general observation of pathologists that the highly proliferative tumors often display significant invasion of the surrounding normal tissue. Many cell types are sensitive to mechanical signals. One striking example is the modulation of cell proliferation, morphology, motility, and protein expression in response to substrate stiffness. Changing the elastic moduli of substrates alters the formation of focal adhesions, the formation of actin filament bundles, and the stability of intermediate filaments.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-458"}, {"text": "The range of stiffness over which different primary cell types respond can vary over a wide range and generally reflects the elastic modulus of the tissue from which these cells were isolated. Mechanosensing also depends on the type of adhesion receptor by which the cell binds, and therefore on the molecular composition of the specific extracellular matrix. The viscoelastic properties of different extracellular matrices and cytoskeletal elements also influence the response of cells to mechanical signals, and the unusual non-linear elasticity of many biopolymer gels, characterized by strain-stiffening leads to novel mechanisms by which cells alter their stiffness by engagement of molecular motors that produce internal stresses. The molecular mechanisms by which cells detect substrate stiffness are largely uncharacterized, but simultaneous control of substrate stiffness and adhesive patterns suggests that stiffness sensing occurs on a length scale much larger than single molecular linkages and that the time needed for mechanosensing is on the order of a few seconds. To explore potential role of cytoskeletal component in cardiomyocyte for adaptation to extreme conditions was carried out the comparative study of expression of cytoskeletal sarcomeric protein titin in myocardium of ground squirrels during hibernation and gerbils after spaceflight. We have revealed a two-fold increase in content of long N2BA titin isoform as compared to short N2B titin isoform in different heart chambers of hibernating ground squirrels. The prevalence of the long titin isoform is known to determine the larger extensibility of heart muscle that promotes, according to Frank-Starling law, the increase in force of heart contractility for pumping higher viscous blood during torpor and adapting the myocardium to greater mechanical loads during awakening. Moreover, titin mRNA level showed seasonal downregulation in which all hibernating stages differed significantly from summer active level. It is possible that the decline of mRNA and protein synthesis during hibernation may be regarded as the accommodation for minimization of energetic expenditures. We have not revealed differences in titin mRNA levels between control gerbils and gerbils after spaceflight. But we have also observed the two-fold growth in the amount of N2BA titin isoform in left ventricle of gerbils after spaceflight that is likely to be directed to the restoration of the reduced heart contractility at zero-gravity. These results suggest that the increase of the content of the long N2BA titin isoform may serve as universal adaptive mechanism for regulating of heart function in response to the extreme conditions. Nuclear migration is a general term for a non-random movement of the nucleus toward specific sites in the cell. This phenomenon has been described throughout the eukaryotes from yeast to mammals. The process is however still poorly understood in mammalian cells. By using microcontact printing we are able to regulate the geometry and spreading of cultured cells. Adhesive micropatterns of fibronectin provide an attachment surface for the cells whereas the passivation of the surface by PLL-PEG prevents protein, thus cell adhesion. Live cell imaging by time-lapse microscopy has shown that under these conditions cells gain a bipolar shape, and more interestingly, the nuclei of the cells showed auto-reversed motion. Our research tries to understand the molecular cues and mechanisms behind the observed cellular and nuclear movement. We have already shown that the cytoskeleton plays an important role in this phenomena but the exact players and the detailed mechanism remain to be clarified. In order to identify the most important components and their relationship have drug treatments and siRNA experiments have been applied. Although our research focuses mainly on the motility of the nucleus, it may also help to get a better understanding of the general theme of cell migration. Cell motility involves a number of strategies that cells use to move in their environments in order to seek nutrients, escape danger and fulfil morphogenetic roles. When these processes become uncontrolled, pathological behaviours, like cancer or metastasis of cancerous cells, can occur. Here we present a new method for the contextual quantification of cellular motility, membrane fluidity and intracellular redox state, by using the ratiometric, redox-sensitive protein rxYFP and the ratiometric fluidity-sensitive probe laurdan.

Its polymerization just beneath the cell membrane generates forces responsible for cell movement. Actin filaments form a network whose architecture is defined by the nature of the binding proteins and depends on the location in the cell. For example, in the structure which leads cell migration, the lamellipodium, the gel is branched due to its interaction with Arp2/3 protein complex. Determining the mechanical properties of such actin network is a crucial interest to understand how forces are generated and transmitted in living cells. We grow a branched actin network from the surface of colloids using the Arp2/3 machinery. The particles are super paramagnetic and they attract each other via dipole-dipole interaction to form chain. By increasing the magnetic field we apply an increasing force to the gel and we optically measure the resulting deformation. From those measurements we deduce a Young modulus for a large amount of data. We are characterizing different networks by varying the concentration of the capping and branching proteins and we show how mechanics can be regulated by the different proteins. Microtubules (MTs) are central to the organization of the eukaryotic intracellular space and are involved in the control of cell morphology. In fission yeasts cells MTs transport polarity factors to poles where growth is located, thus ensuring the establishment and maintenance of the characteristic spherocylindrical shape. For this purpose, MT polymerization dynamics is tightly regulated. Using automated image analysis software, we investigated the spatial dependence of MT dynamics in interphase fission yeast cells. We evidenced that compressive forces generated by MTs growing against the cell pole locally reduce MT growth velocities and enhance catastrophe frequencies. In addition, our systematic and quantitative analysis (in combination with genetic modifications) provides a tool to study the role of ?TIPs (plus-end tracking proteins) such as Mal3 and Tip1 in the spatial regulation of MT dynamics. We further use this system to decipher how the linear transport by MT interferes with the feedback circuitry that assures the correct spatial distribution of Tea1, the main polarity factor in fission yeast cells. The dynamics of the cytoskeleton are largely driven by cytoskeletal motor proteins. Complex cellular functions, such as mitotsis, need a high degree of control of these motors. The versatility and sophistication of biological nanomachines still challenges our understanding. Kinesin-5 motors fulfill essential roles in mitotic spindle morphogenesis and dynamics and were thought to be slow, processive microtubule (MT)-plus-end directed motors. Here we have examined in vitro and in vivo functions of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinesin-5 Cin8 using single-molecule motility assays and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. In vivo, the majority of Cin8 motors moved slowly towards MT plus-ends, but we also observed occasional minus-end directed motility episodes. In vitro, individual Cin8 motors could be switched by ionic conditions from rapid (up to 50 lm/min) and processive minus-end, to bidirectional, to slow plus-end motion. Deletion of the uniquely large insert in loop 8 of Cin8 induced bias towards minus-end motility and strongly affected the directional switching of Cin8 both in vivo and in vitro. The entirely unexpected in vivo and in vitro switching of Cin8 directionality and speed demonstrate that kinesins are much more complex than thought.

In this study we analyzed by means of Optical Tweezers the mechanical properties of two different breast adenocarcinoma cell lines corresponding to different metastatic potential. OT were used to grab the plasma membrane by a 1,5 um silica bead and form a plasma membrane tether. We measured the force exerted by the cell membrane on the bead and drew the force-elongation curves.

TPPP/p25 is a disordered protein with extended unstructured segments localized at the N-and C-terminals straddling a flexible region. TPPP/p25 is primarily expressed in oligodendrocytes where its multifunctional features such as tubulin polymerization promoting and microtubule bundling activities are crucial for the development of the projections in the course of oligodendrocyte differentiation enabling the ensheathment of axons with a myelin sheath that is indispensable for the normal function of the central nervous system. Microtubule network, a major constituent of the cytoskeleton, displays multiple physiological and pathological functions in eukaryotic cells. The distinct functions of the microtubular structures are attained by static and dynamic associations of macromolecules and ligands as well as by post-translational modifications. TPPP/p25 is actively involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics not exclusively by its bundling activity, but also by its tubulin acetylation-promoting activity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-477"}, {"text": "Atypical histone deacetylases, such as NAD-dependent SIRT2 and histone deacetylase-6, function outside of the nucleus and control the acetylation level of cytosolic proteins, such as tubulin. Acetylation-driven regulation of the microtubule network during cellular differentiation is an ambiguous issue. TPPP/p25 has been recently identified as an interacting partner and inhibitor of these deacetylases and their interaction decreased the growth velocity of the microtubule plus ends and the motility of the cells. We have established cell models for the quantification of the acetylation degree of microtubule network in correlation with its dynamics and stability as well as in relation to aggresome formation, that mimics the pathological inclusion formation. The intracellular level of TPPP/p25 is controlled at posttranscription level by microRNA and at protein level by the proteosome machinery. Under pathological circumstances this disordered protein displays additional moonlighting function that is independent of its association with microtubule system or deacetylases; it enters aberrant proteinprotein interaction with a-synuclein forming toxic aggregates within the neuronal and glial cells leading to the formation of inclusions characteristic for Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, respectively. The cell membrane separates the intracellular from the extracellular environment while intimately interacting with the cytoskeleton in numerous cellular functions, including cell division and motility. Cell shape changes are for a large part mediated by the contractile actomyosin network forming the cortex underneath the cell membrane. To uncover molecular mechanisms of cell shape control based on actin-membrane interactions, we built a novel biomimetic model system: a cell-sized liposome encapsulating an actively contracting actin-myosin network. Our fabrication method is inspired by a recent report of liposome preparation by swelling of lipid layers in agarose hydrogel films. 1 We extensively characterize important liposomal properties, finding diameters between 7 and 20 lm, unilamellarity, and excellent and uniform encapsulation efficiency. We further demonstrate chemical control of actin network anchoring to the membrane. The resulting liposomes allow quantitative tests of physical models of cell shape generation and mechanics. In the cohesive structure of the cytoskeleton functionally distinct actin arrays orchestrate fundamental cell functions in a spatiotemporally controlled manner. Emerging evidences emphasize that protein isoforms are essential for the functional polymorphism of the actin cytoskeleton. The generation of diverse actin networks is catalyzed by different nucleation factors, like formins and Arp2/3 complex. These actin arrays also exhibit qualitative and quantitative differences in the associated tropomyosin (Tm) isoforms. How the molecular composition and the function of actin networks are coupled is not completely understood. We investigated the effects of different Tm isoforms (skeletal muscle, cytoskeletal 5NM1 and Br3) on the activity of mDia1 formin and Arp2/3 complex using fluorescence spectroscopic approaches. The results show that the studied Tm isoforms have different effects on the mDia1-, and Arp2/3 complexmediated actin assembly. The activity of the Arp2/3 complex is inhibited by skTm and Tm5NM1, while TmBr3 does not have any effect. All three Tm isoforms inhibited the activity of mDia1. These results contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms by which tropomyosin isoforms regulate the functional diversity of the actin cytoskeleton. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a dual pulmonary vascular disorder, which combines major vascular remodelling with small-vessel arteriopathy. The presence of fibroblasts in the clot, occluding the pulmonary arteries, and its composition create a microenvironment with increased collagen level, which might affect the local endothelial function. In this study, human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (hPAEC) were exposed to collagen type I to address the effect of the thrombotic microenvironment on the vessel wall forming cells. The hPAECs, cultured under standard conditions were treated with 1, 10 and 100lg/ml of collagen type I for 6h and 24h. The changes in the endothelial cell barrier function were investigated by performing permeability and migration test as well as VE-cadherin staining. Collagen type I treatment led to a decrease in VE-cadherin signal in hPAEC. The loosening of cell-cell contacts could be proven with a significant increase in permeability after 6h of collagen treatment with different concentrations. Besides the loosening of the cell-cell contacts, the hPAEC migration was also dose dependently retarded by collagen application over time.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2014, "end": 2015, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-477"}, {"text": "Our data show that collagen-rich microenvironment leads to a disruption of the junctional proteins in hPAECs, indicating an environmental induced possible alteration in the function of endothelial cells in the clots of CTEPH patients. The implementation of miniaturisation and high throughput screening has quickened the pace of protein structure determination. However, for most proteins the process still requires milligram quantities of protein with purity [ 95 %. These amounts are required as a result of unavoidable losses during purification and for the extensive screening of crystallisation space. For integral membrane proteins (IMPs), one of the initial steps in the structure determination procedure is still a major bottleneck -the over-expression of the target protein in the milligram quantity range. With a view of developing guidelines for over-expression of human IMPs, a systematic approach using the three most common laboratory expression systems (E. coli, S. cerevisiae, Sf9 insect cells) was implemented. Initial expression levels were determined by either partial purification using Ni 2? -NTA (E. coli), green fluorescence protein (GFP) fluorescence using a C-terminal GFP tagged protein (S. cerevisiae) or FLAG tagged partial purification (Sf9 cells). The results show that E. coli is suitable for the over-expression of human IMPs in the required quantity range however protein size and complexity is an important factor. The yeast system is fast and affordable but, for the group of human IMPs tested, the expression levels were borderline. Finally for the insect cell system, the timelines are slower and it is in comparison costly to run, however, it can produce relatively large quantities of human IMPs. The Cu?-ATPase CopB of Enterococcus hirae is a bacterial P-type ATPase involved in resistance to high levels of environmental copper by expelling excess copper. The membrane protein CopB was purified from an over-expressing strain and solubilized in dodecyl-maltoside. By UV circular dichroism the secondary structure is predicted to contain 40-50 % a-helices and 10-15% b-sheets in agreement with estimates based on homology with the Ca ATPase SERCA1. We present CD-spectroscopic data on thermal unfolding of the protein to address the influence of the binding of the ATP analogs ATPcS and the fluorescent analog mant-ATP on the protein stability. Such analogs are used to mimic functional states of the ATPase but undergo different interactions with the binding site that are not well characterized. We propose a competition-based assay for nucleotide binding using CDspectroscopy to deduce the occupancy of the nucleotidebinding site by non-fluorescent nucleotides. Alternatively, the change of intrinsic fluorescence of mant-ATP upon binding to the ATPase is exploited in these assays. Finally, we show how the simultaneous measurement of protein CD and nucleotide fluorescence in thermal denaturation experiments may help to determine the stability of several functional conformational states of CopB. showing the steady-state distribution of electric potential, ionic concentrations are obtained efficiently.

Besides its function as an ion channel, K V 10.1 has also been associated with non-canonical signaling functions. Various membrane proteins associated with cholesterol-sphingolipids enriched microdomains are involved in signaling pathways. In this work we studied the membrane distribution of K V 10.1 in highly purified brain-tissue plasma membranes as a function of cholesterol content versus cytoskeletal proteins. The results show that one fraction of KV10.1 associates to cholesterol-rich domains or Detergent Resistant Membranes (DRM) and another fraction to non-DRM domains. The KV10.1 fraction inserted in DRM is dependent on cholesterol as well as on cytoskeleton proteins. Depletion of cholesterol leads to a doubling of K V 10.1 current density. We suggest that K V 10.1 coexists in two different populations: one where the transmembrane domain fits cholesterol enriched membranes and another able to fit into a less packed lipid bilayer. The importance of this distribution on signaling processes needs to be further investigated. We use the reduced model of an axis-symmetric water-filled channel whose protein wall has a single charged site. The channel length, radius and fixed charge are selected to match experimental data for Gramicidin A. The ion current, occupancy and escape rate are simulated by the 1D self-consistent BD technique with account taken of the electrostatic ion-ion interaction. The bath with non-zero ion concentration on one side of the channel is modelled via the Smoluchowski arrival rate. It is shown that: a) The occupancy saturates with Michaelis-Menten kinetics. b) The escape rate starts from the Kramers value at small concentrations and then increases with concentration due to the electrostatic amplification of charge fluctuations. The resulting dynamics of the current can be described by modified reaction rate theory accounting for ionic escape over the fluctuating barrier [1] . Many membrane-protein functions are amenable to biophysical and biochemical investigation only after the protein of interest has been reconstituted from a detergent-solubilised state into artificial lipid bilayers. Unfortunately, functional reconstitution has remained one of the main bottlenecks in the handling of numerous membrane proteins.

The major issue of MscL is to understand the gating mechanism driven by tension in the membrane. To address this question, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the opening of MscL embedded in the lipid bilayer. In the closed state of MscL, neighboring TM1 inner helices are crossed each other near the cytoplasmic side and Leu19 and Val23 in the constricted part form a stable hydrophobic environment called gate. Upon membrane stretch, Phe78 in TM2 outer helices was dragged by lipids, leading to an opening of MscL. Thus Phe78 was concluded to be the major tension sensor. During opening, TM1inner helices were also dragged and tilted, accompanied by the outward sliding of the crossings. This led to a slight expansion of the gate associated with an exposure of oxygen atoms of the backbone to the inner surface of the gate. This allows water penetration in the gate and formation of hydrogen bonds between water and the exposed oxygen, which in turn weakened the hydrophobic interaction at the crossings, causing a further opening of the gate and water permeation.

Under prolonged iron starvation IsiA becomes the main chlorophyll-binding protein in the cell and occurs without a photosystem association. These IsiA aggregates have a strong ability to dissipate light energy and there is evidence of carotenoid participation in the quenching mechanism via downhill energy transfer from chlorophyll to the S1 state of a carotenoid [3] . In the present work we have measured the temperature dependence of the fluorescence of carotenoid depleted mutants (echinenone and/or zeaxanthin) and IsiA monomers in order to investigate the role of carotenoid and aggregation in the quenching process. Pigment analysis confirms the absence of the carotenoid mutated in its biosynthesis but shows that it is mainly replaced. The monomers are lacking two carotenoids, echinenone and one of the two \u00df-carotenes found previously in IsiA aggregates.

Production of solar fuels needs to involve the splitting of water into protons, energized electrons and dioxygen. In photosynthetic organisms, solar-energy conversion and catalysis of water splitting (or water oxidation) proceed in an impressive cofactor-protein complex denoted as photosystem II (PSII). The heart of biological water-oxidation is a protein-bound manganese-calcium complex working at technically unmatched efficiency. In an attempt to learn from nature, the natural paragon is intensely studied using advanced biophysical methods. Structural studies by X-ray spectroscopy with synchrotron radiation play a prominent role in this endeavor. Time-resolved methods provide insights in the formation of intermediate states of the reaction cycle. An overview is presented focusing on (i) the efficiency of solar energy usage in PSII, (ii) the interrelation between electron transfer and proton relocations, and (iii) the mechanism of water oxidation.

PCP crystal structures [1] reveal that each chlorophyll is surrounded by 3 or 4 molecules of the carotenoid peridinin, located in non-equivalent positions. The different protein environment of the sites might be responsible of a spectral shift of the pigments with the functional role to extend the absorption spectra of the complex and enhance its light harvesting capabilities. High resolution X-ray diffraction data on a reconstructed PCP, the refolded peridinin-chlorophyll a-protein (RFPCP) [2] , and on the less common high salt-PCP (HSPCP) opened the way to the mechanistic understanding of peridinin spectral tuning, peridinin chlorophyll energy transfer and photoprotective mechanism [3] . The two PCP forms differ in various features: spectral properties, molar mass, amino acid sequence and, above all, pigment stoichiometry, the peridinin:chlorophyll ratio being 4:1 for the RFPCP and 3:1 for the HSPCP [4] . In the present work we perform classical molecular dynamics simulations of the RFPCP and the HSPCP in explicit water solution. We analyse the structure and dynamics of the proteins and of their pigments to characterize the different peridinin sites in both PCP forms in terms of quantities that can affect the chromophore spectra, such as distorsion, fluctuations and nature of the protein environment. The comparison between the data suggests correspondences between the pigments of the two forms. Quantum and mixed quantum/ classical molecular dynamics simulations are also under progress to investigate the effect of the protein environment on the electronic and optical properties of the PCP pigments.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1710, "end": 1713, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1734, "end": 1737, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2105, "end": 2108, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4381, "end": 4384, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4854, "end": 4857, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5051, "end": 5054, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5273, "end": 5276, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-512"}, {"text": "peculiar applications, like in optoelectronics, biosensors, photovoltaics.

In our work we combined purified photosynthetic reaction center protein (RC) and porous silicon (PSi) investigating the morphology and optoelectronic properties of the bio-nanocomposite material. FTIR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicated the binding of the protein to the PSi. Specular reflectance spectra showed a red shift in the characteristic interference peak of the PSi microcavity which was saturated at higher concentration of the protein. The binding was more effective if the functionalization was done by the Si-specific oligopeptide compared to the classical covalent binding via aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APTES). Excitation by single saturation flashes indicated that the RC still exhibited photochemical turnover after the binding. The role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant stress, both as damaging agent and as potential signal molecule is often assessed in experiments using photosensitized elicitor dyes. For these studies, it is essential to know how efficiently these chemicals generate ROS, whether they are specific ROS sources, as well as their cellular localization and additional side effects. The present study addresses these issues using a variety of dyes known and traditionally applied as singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) sources. Rose Bengal (RB), Methylene Violet (MVI), Methylene Blue (MB), Neutral Red (NR) and Indigo Carmine (IC) were studied as putative ROS sources in tobacco leaves. ROS products of photosensitized dyes were measured in vitro, using spin trapping EPR spectroscopy. Dye concentrations and irradiation concentration leading to equal absorbed excitation quanta were determined spectrophotometrically. In vivo studies were carried out using tobacco leaves infiltrated with water solutions of the putative 1 O 2 sources. Cellular localizations were identified on the basis of the dyes' fluorescence.

The yield of formation of carotenoid cation states and/or carotenoid S 1 state is either extremely low or absent, thus excluding their involvement in NPQ quenching as a major quenching mechanism. Single-molecule spectroscopy (SMS) is a powerful technique that allows investigation of fluorescence properties from single fluorescing systems. This technique enabled us to investigate the dynamics of the fluorescence intensity and spectral profiles of single, isolated light harvesting complex (LHC) on timescales of milliseconds to seconds, during continuous laser illumination. We were able to observe how each complex can rapidly switch between different emission states [1, 2] and to characterise the intensity and the spectral dynamics of major and minor antenna complexes from plants, in two different environments, mimicking the light harvesting and the light dissipating state, respectively.

The fluorescence decay kinetics of the systems under study were registered without quenchers and with quenchers added in a range of concentrations.

Both structural (AFM, TEM and SEM microscopy) and functional (flash photolysis and conductivity) techniques showed that RCs can be bound effectively to different CNTs. Both physical sorption and binding through -NH 2 or -COOH groups gave similar results. However, it appeared that by physical sorption some sections of the CNTs were covered by multiple layers of RCs. After the binding the RCs kept their photochemical activity for a long time (at least for three months, even in dried form) and there is a redox interaction between the CNT and RCs. The attachment of RC to CNTs results in an accumulation of positive and negative charges followed by slow reorganization of the protein structure after excitation. In the absence of CNT the secondary quinone activity decays quickly as a function of time after drying the RC onto a glass surface.

Although similar method is used in higher plants, its application in photosynthetic bacteria is novel and highly challanging. The available data are restricted and only the re-oxidation of the reduced primary quinone (Q A -? Q A ) is usually blamed for the decay kinetics. Here, we will analyse the complexity of the kinetics over a very broad time range (from 5 ls to 5 s) and show that the dark relaxation of the bacteriochlorophyll fluorescence reflects the overlap of several processes attributed to the intra-and interproteinous electron transfer processes of the reaction center (RC) and cytochrome bc 1 complex of the bacterium. In the shorter (\\ 1 ms) time scale, the dominating effect is the re-reduction of the oxidized primary donor (P ? ? P) that is followed by the re-oxidation of the acceptor complex of the RC by the cytochrome bc 1 complex. As the life times and amplitudes of the components depend on the physiological state of the photosynthetic apparatus, the relaxation of the fluorescence can be used to monitor the photosynthetic capacity of the photosynthetic bacteria in vivo. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is an indispensable tool to probe molecular architecture. At the molecular level chirality results in intrinsic CD, pigment-pigment interactions in protein complexes give rise to excitonic CD, whereas ''psitype'' CD originates from large densely packed chiral aggregates. It has been well established that the anisotropic CD (ACD), measured on samples with defined orientation, carries specific information on the architecture of molecules. However, ACD can easily be distorted by linear dichroism of the sample or instrumental imperfections -which might be the reason why it is rarely studied in photosynthesis research. Here we present ACD spectra of isolated intact and washed, unstacked thylakoid membranes, photosystem II membranes (BBY), and tightly-stacked lamellar macroaggregates of the main light-harvesting complex II (LHCII). We show that the ACD spectra of face-and edge-aligned stacked thylakoid membranes and LHCII lamellae exhibit profound differences in their psi-type CD bands. Marked differences are also seen in the excitonic CD of BBY and washed thylakoid membranes. Thus ACD provides an additional dimension to the Light induced conformation changes of quinone depleted photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs) purified from the carotenoid-less Rhodobacter sphaeroides R-26 were investigated by transient absorption (TA) and grating (TG) methods.

The latter coincides with the life time of the TG signal, which was assigned earlier [Nagy et al. (2008) FEBS Lett. 582, 3657-3662] to spectrally silent conformational changes. The nature of the 40 ls phase was investigated further. Although, the probability of chlorophyll triplet formation under our measuring conditions was small, possible contribution of the triplet states was also studied. The presence of carotenoid in the wild type RCs eliminated the 40 ls component indicating the role of carotenoid in the energy transfer within the RCs. There was no significant effect of the molecular oxygen on the TA. This fact may be explained if the chlorophyll triplets inside the protein have reduced accessibility to molecular oxygen.

In untreated leaves, at room temperature, the fluorescence rise follows the reduction of the electron transport chain (ETC).

The first example concerns electron tunneling between heme a and heme a3 in the proton pump cytochrome c oxidase. This reaction is very fast, occurring on the nano-second time scale, and it is unclear if this is due to an unusually low reorganization free energy or due to high electronic coupling. Carrying out large-scale all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of oxidase embedded in a membrane, we do not find evidence for unusually small values of reorganization energy as proposed previously, implying that the nanosecond tunneling rate between heme a and a3 is supported by very efficient electronic coupling.

The voltammetric methodology in combination with the advanced data processing procedures allow for comprehensive kinetic data within the congruent series of nano-devices and the subsequent calculation of the key physical parameters, such as the medium reorganization energy of ET, the donor-acceptor electronic coupling, effective relaxation time (related to the protein's and environment's fluctuational dynamics), etc. In our studies the ''model'' redox protein, cytochrome c (CytC), was either freely diffusing to SAM terminal groups (mode 1), or attached to SAMs through the electrostatic interaction (mode 2), or specific ''wiring'' (mode 3). Another redox-active protein, azurin, was confined at terminal SAM groups through the hydrophobic interaction (mode 4). Diverse experimental strategies including the variation of SAM thickness, solution viscosity temperature and hydrostatic pressure, allowed for a severe demonstration of the full adiabatic and nonadiabatic control (thinner and thicker SAMs, respectively), and the intermediary regime, in a nice agreement with the major theoretical predictions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-543"}, {"text": "Proton transfers in a light-driven proton pump J.K. Lanyi Dept. Physiology & Biophysics, University of California, Irvine, USA Illumination of bacteriorhodopsin causes isomerization of alltrans retinal to 13-cis,15-anti and a cyclic reaction ensues, in which the protein and the chromophore undergo conformational changes with an overall ten millisecond turn-over time and a proton is transported from one membrane side to the other. With crystal structures of six trapped intermediate states and plausible structural models for the remaining two intermediates, structures are now available for the initial bacteriorhodopsin state and all intermediates. They reveal the molecular events that underlie the light-induced transport: protonation of the retinal Schiff base by Asp85, proton release to the extracellular membrane surface, a switch event that allows reprotonation of the Schiff base from the cytoplasmic side, side-chain and main-chain motions initiated in the cytoplasmic region, formation of a single-file chain of hydrogen-bonded water molecules that conducts the proton of Asp96 to the Schiff base, and reprotonation of Asp96 from the cytoplasmic surface. The observed changes can be summarized as a detailed atomic-level movie in which gradual relaxation of the distorted retinal causes a cascade of displacements of water and protein atoms results in vectorial proton transfers to and from the Schiff base. Electron transfer (ET) processes are fundamental in photosynthesis, respiration and enzyme catalysis. The relative importance of superexchange and sequential mechanisms in biological ET is still a matter of debate. The identification of any ''stepping stones'' necessary for electron hopping is a key point in the understanding of long range ET. Hence, the study of a single event in the sequence of reactions occurring in these phenomena is a fundamental but formidable task. Muon spin relaxation (lSR) has been shown to be sensitive to charge transport on a molecular lengthscale. The muon is a very sensitive probe of electron transport, as any changes to the electronic density sampled by the muon can change its spin polarization, which can easily be measured. In this context, a very useful tool is the detection of the so-called Avoided Level Crossing (ALC) resonances [1] . The enhancement in the loss of polarization of the muon's spin on these resonances dramatically increases sensitivity. We show that a laser pump -lSR probe technique can measure ET processes at particular, and most importantly known, sites within the amino acids chain, and therefore track the time evolution of the electron over the molecule. Keywords: Photosynthesis, reaction center, electron transfer, proton transfer, Fourier transform infrared, L210DN, isotopic labeling, band assignment, histidine, mechanism In photosynthesis, the central step in transforming light energy into chemical energy is the coupling of light-induced electron transfer to proton uptake. In the photosynthetic reaction center (RC) of Rhodobacter sphaeroides, fast formation of the charge separated state P ? Q A is followed by a slower electron transfer from the primary quinone Q A to the secondary quinone Q B and the uptake of a proton from the cytoplasm to Q B . Previous Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements on RC suggested an intermediate X in the Q A -Q B to Q A Q B transition. Mutation of the amino acid AspL210 to Asn (L210DN mutant) slows down proton uptake and oxidation of Q A -. Using time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy we characterized this RC mutant and proposed specific IR bands that belong to the intermediate X.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2299, "end": 2302, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O-545"}, {"text": "To study the role of the iron-histidine complex located between Q A and Q B , we performed fast-scan FTIR experiments on the L210DN mutant marked with isotopically labelled histidine.

These bands show the protonation of a histidine, most likely HisL190, during the Q A -Q B to Q A Q B transition. Based on these results we propose a new mechanism of the coupling of electron and proton transfer in photosynthesis. Complex I of respiratory chains is an energy transducing enzyme present in most bacteria and in all mitochondria. It is the least understood complex of the aerobic respiratory chain, even though the crystallographic a-helical structures of bacterial and mitochondrial complexes have been recently determined [1] [2] . This complex catalyses the oxidation of NADH and the reduction of quinone, coupled to cation translocation across the membrane. Rhodothermus marinus complex I, our main model system, is a NADH:menaquinone oxidoreductase and has been extensively characterized. We have made an exhaustive study in order to identify all the subunits present in the complex [3] . The nature of the coupling charge of R. marinus complex I was investigated using inside-out membrane vesicles, which were active with respect to NADH oxidation and capable of creating and maintain an NADH-driven membrane potential (DW) positive inside. It was observed that this bacterial complex I is able of H ? and Na ? transport, although to opposite directions. The coupling ion of the system was shown to be the H ? being transported to the periplasm, contributing in this way to the establishment of the electrochemical potential difference, while Na ? is translocated to the cytoplasm [4] . The sodium ion extrusion from the membrane vesicles was due to the activity of complex I, since it was sensitive to its inhibitor rotenone, and it was still observed when the complex I segment of the respiratory chain was isolated by the simultaneous presence of cyanide and external quinones. Additional studies have shown that although neither the catalytic reaction nor the establishment of the DpH requires the presence of Na ? , the presence of this ion increased the proton transport. Combining all these results, a model for the coupling mechanism of complex I was proposed, suggesting the presence of two different energy coupling sites, one that works only as a proton pump (Na ? independent), and the other functioning as a Na ? /H ? antiporter (Na ? dependent) [4] . This model was reinforced by further studies performed in the presence of the Na ? /H ? antiporter inhibitor, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA) [5] . A deeper inside into the coupling mechanism of this enzyme was provided by studying the influence of sodium ions on energy transduction by complexes I from Escherichia coli and Paracoccus denitrificans. It was observed that the Na ? / H ? antiporter activity is not exclusive of R. marinus complex I, since the E. coli enzyme is also capable of such a transport, but is not a general property given that the P. denitrificans enzyme does not performed sodium translocation [6] . Due to the fact that R. marinus and E. coli enzymes reduce menaquinone while P. denitrificans complex I reduce ubiquinone, it is suggested that the Na ? /H ? antiporter activity may be correlated with the type of quinone used as substrate.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 824, "end": 827, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 828, "end": 831, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1188, "end": 1191, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1787, "end": 1790, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2565, "end": 2568, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2722, "end": 2725, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3200, "end": 3203, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O-545"}, {"text": "Under anaerobic conditions some bacteria can use nitrate instead of oxygen in a process called denitrification.

The understanding of NOR functioning was limited by the lack of structural information, but recently the first structures (cNOR type from Ps. aerug. and qNOR type from G. stearoth.) were solved [1] [2] . We will present results of the first computational studies of NOR (both cNOR and qNOR types) [2] [3] . The studies include: (i) large-scale all-atom MD simulations of proteins in their natural environment (i.e. embedded in membrane and solvent), which were performed to describe water dynamics inside the protein and to identify potential proton transfer pathways, and (ii) free-energy calculations by the empirical valence bond (EVB) method [4] for the explicit proton translocations along the pathways established by MD. Among important findings are new proton pathways, which were not predicted from the X-ray structure and could be identified only by means of computer simulations. Simulations also reveal that, despite a high structural similarity between cNOR and qNOR, these enzymes utilize strikingly different proton uptake mechanisms.

The structure of oxidized OmcF was determined (5) being the first example of a cytochrome c 6 -like structure from a nonphotosynthetic organism. The structural features of OmcF hinted a different function compared to cytochromes c 6 from photosynthetic organisms, being an excellent example of how structurally related proteins are specifically design by Nature to perform different physiological functions. In order to elucidate OmcF structural-functional mechanism, isotopic labeled protein ( 15 N and 13 C) was produced and its structure in the reduced form determined by NMR.

This apparent paradox seems related to the belief that the strong similarity of sequence and structure of NO-Synthases must lead to a unique and identical functioning (NO production) for all isoforms. This is blatant for bacterial NOS-like proteins that are lacking the essential components required for NO biosynthesis but remain considered as genuine NO synthases. This approach might remain an obstacle to the understanding of NOS actual biological role and could prevent the design of efficient NOS-targeted therapeutic strategies. To elucidate this ''NOS paradox'' our group has initiated a multidisciplinary approach that aims to relate the wide diversity of NOS biological activities to variations in the catalytic mechanism of NOSs, to modifications of their regulation patterns and to adaptations to their physiological environment. In this context we have been investigating the mechanism of bacillus subtilis NOS-like proteins with a special focus on the features that are specific to NOS mechanism: i) electron and proton transfers and the role of the substrate and the pterin cofactor ii) oxygen activation and the role of the proximal ligand iii) the very molecular mechanism and the variations in the nature of reaction intermediates.

Photosynthetic Iron Oxidation (PIO) is an ancient form of photosynthesis with relevant consequences in the shaping of the planet. This form of metabolism may have been involved in the deposition of geological structures known as Banded Iron Formations, which hold key information regarding the co-evolution of photosynthesis and Earth. Rhodopseudomonas palustris TIE-1 and Rhodobacter ferroxidans SW2 both use ferrous iron as an electron donor to support photosynthetic growth (i.e. photoferrotrophy). The SW2 foxEYZ operon can stimulate light-dependent iron oxidation by other bacteria. It codes a two-heme cytochrome, a pyrroloquinoline quinone protein and an inner membrane transporter, respectively. In TIE-1 the pioABC operon is required for photoferrotrophy. It codes for a ten-heme cytochrome, an outer membrane beta-barrel and a high potential iron-sulfur protein (HiPIP) respectively.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is associated with severe cardiac complications. Recent research suggests that impaired voltage-gated ion channels in dystrophic cardiomyocytes accompany cardiac pathology. It is, however, unknown if ion channel defects are primary effects of dystrophic gene mutations, or secondary effects of the developing cardiomyopathy. Here, we studied Na and Ca channel impairments in dystrophic neonatal cardiomyocytes, derived from DMD mouse models, prior to cardiomyopathy development. Dystrophin-deficiency reduced Na current density. In addition, extra utrophin-deficiency altered Na channel gating. Moreover, also Ca channel inactivation was reduced, suggesting that ion channel abnormalities are universal primary effects of dystrophic gene mutations. To assess developmental changes, we also studied Na channel impairments in dystrophic adult cardiomyocytes, and found a stronger Na current reduction than in neonatal ones. The described Na channel impairments slowed the action potential upstroke in adult cardiomyocytes, and only in dystrophic adult mice, the QRS interval of the ECG was prolonged. Ion channel impairments precede pathology development in the dystrophic heart, and may be considered cardiomyopathy triggers. Supported by Austrian FWF (P19352). It has been over 15 years since sensory neuron-specific sodium channel Na V 1.8 was identified. Since then Na V 1.8 has been shown to play a crucial role in pain pathways, and it became a prominent drug target for novel pain killers. In contrast to myelinated neurons, mechanisms that target voltagegated sodium channels to the unmyelinated C-fibre axons are largely unknown. We investigated the localisation of Na V 1.8 in unmyelinated primary sensory neurons. Na V 1.8 was found to be clustered in lipid rafts on unmyelinated axons. When the lipid rafts are disrupted, remarkable reduction in both the conduction velocity and the number of cells responsive to mechanical stimuli to the unmyelinated axons were seen. Using a compartment culture system, we also found that disruption of rafts in the middle region of the sensory axons caused a significant reduction in the responsiveness of the neurons to chemical stimuli to nerve endings. This is due to the failure of action potential propagation through the axons. These data suggest that clustering of Na V 1.8 in lipid rafts of unmyelinated fibres is a key factor for the functional properties of the channel, which may due to a change in the voltage threshold. Disruption of the Na V 1.8 cluster and modifying lipid rafts in primary sensory neurons may be a useful new approach to control the excitability of nociceptive neurons. Ion currents in are crucially important for activation of T-lymphocytes. Our aim was to investigate how the blockage of various ion channels in isolation or in combination affects mitogen-dependent activation and proliferation of T-cells. We activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes using monoclonal antibodies against the TCR-CD3 complex and CD28. We applied specific channel blockers inhibiting the major ion channels of the T-cell: either the Kv1.3 (TEA or Anuroctoxin), IKCa1 (TRAM-34), or the CRAC channel (2-APB) alone or in combination. Five days after the stimulus we measured the change in cell size and cellular granulation with flow cytometry along with the proportion of dividing cells, using CFSE (carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester) dilution assay. Our measurements indicated that the ion channel blockers suppressed the proportion of dividing cells in a dosedependent manner. Increasing the strength of the stimulation reduced the potency of the blockers to inhibit cell proliferation and eventually the blockers were ineffective in decreasing lymphocyte proliferation. We experienced the greatest amount of inhibition using the combination of the blockers, which indicates synergy in the regulation pathway of the various ion channels. Recently, sodium dependent phosphate transporter NaPi2b was revealed as potential marker for breast, thyroid and ovarian cancer. In vivo, NaPi2b is involved in maintenance of phosphate homeostasis and mutations or aberrant expressions of its gene (SLC34A2) are associated with several diseases including cancer. However, data about NaPi2b mRNA expression in different types of cancer and correspondent normal tissues are controversial and restricted. We investigated SLC34A2 gene expression level in normal ovarian tissues and different histomorphological types of ovarian tumors using real-time PCR analysis. It was found that SLC34A2 gene was highly expressed in well-differentiated endometrioid and papillary serous tumors, but was not expressed in low-differentiated tumors, benign tumors and in most normal tissues. mRNA expression of SLC34A2 in serouse and endometrioid ovarian tumors accurately correlated with protein expression that was detected in these tumor samples by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry in our previous investigation. Upregulation of SLC34A2 gene expression in well-differentiated tumors may reflect cell differentiation processes during ovarian cancerogenesis and could serve as potential marker for ovarian cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

It is shown how the SDF procedure allows us to evaluate both total MSD and partial MSDs through total and partial SDFs. As a result, total MSD is the weighed sum of partial MSDs in which the weights are obtained by the fitting procedure of measured Elastic Incoherent Neutron Scattering (EINS) intensity.

Using the method, several types of proteins (BSA, ERD10, UBQ, a-, b-casein, and WT, A53T, a-synuclein mutants) were investigated in that temperature range. The results are shown in detail as an illustrative example. Potential applications are outlined, which include (i) the distinction between the solvent accessible surfaces of globular and intrinsically disordered proteins, (ii) the distinction between protein mutants, and (iii) the identification of monomer and polymer protein states. This method provides a possibility to study the polymerization process (amyloid formation) and to investigate in-situ the reason and circumstances of that. Morphometry due to self gravity in living organism is an integral part in understanding Self Gravitation Bio. Computational studies of biological system, especially in ab-initio embryo as self gravitating mass, floating over amniotic fluid, as if maintaining anti -gravitation (extrinsic) mechanism, would be an interesting one to explore biomechanics of intrinsic gravity. Since the work would be of exploratory nature, both from the point of view of identifying appropriate stage of development of embryological morulla and available computational logics, it was contemplated to initiate functional study with a few reported ultrasound evidential works on small animals like mice, grasshopper including compact human embryo as mathematical structure that may allow the formal definition of concepts such as convergence, mapping and continuity. As many of the finite-dimensional function analysis in topological vector spaces are available, we initiated our simulation and studies on concentrating locally compact banach spaces. 3 Institute for x-ray physics, University of G\u00f6 ttingen, Germany", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3732, "end": 3733, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-581"}, {"text": "We report on hard x-ray phase contrast imaging of black lipid membranes (BLMs), which are freely suspended over a micro machined aperture in an aqueous solution.

The width of the thinning film is significantly smaller than the detector pixel size, but can be resolved from quantitative analysis of the intensity fringes in the Fresnel diffraction regime down to its native thickness of about 5nm. To our knowledge this is the first time that such small features of a very weak phase object have been visualized by direct x-ray imaging techniques.

This suggests that it interacts predominantly with the outer part of the lipid layer of erythrocytes and liposomes. It was also shown that the CGA decreases the packing order of the hydrophobic part of the membranes, without changing the anisotropic fluorescence of the hydrophobic part. One of the unique features of single molecule absorption/ emission is their anisotropy due to the well-defined transition dipoles for both processes allowing the determination of the molecule's 3d orientation. Therefore, several techniques have been proposed in order to determine the full 3d orientation of dipole emitters on a single molecule level. We recently demonstrated a technique that combines emission distribution and polarization detection [1, 2, 3] . As the method is an intensity distribution technique and based on single photon detection in principle, one can extend the 3d orientation determination to fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) as well as dynamical anisotropy measurements. This allows for the determination of the dynamics in 3d orientation of single molecules down to a nanosecond timescales. The 3d orientation is particularly interesting in non-isotropic environments. A lipid membrane is such a non-isotropic environment of enormous importance in biological systems. We therefore use giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) labeled with dyes like DiO as a model system.

Supported Lipid Bilayers are an abundant research platform for understanding the behavior of cell membranes as they allow for additional mechanical stability and enable characterization techniques not reachable otherwise. However, in computer simulations these systems have been studied only rarely up to now. We present systematic studies on different length scales of the changes that a support inflicts on a phospholipid bilayer using molecular modeling. We characterize the density and pressure profiles as well as the density imbalance induced by the support. It turns out that the changes in pressure profile are strong enough that protein function should be impacted leading to a previously neglected mechanism of transmembrane protein malfunction in supported bilayers. We determine the diffusion coefficients and characterize the influence of corrugation of the support. We also measure the free energy of transfer of phospholipids between leaflets using the coarsegrained Martini model. It turns out that there is at equilibrium about a 2-3% higher density in the proximal leaflet.

Generation of membrane curvature by these membrane deforming proteins often works together with actin dynamics. I-BAR shares its function between actin bundling and membrane binding but it is still obscured what molecular mechanisms are responsible for these functions. The aim of our project is to investigate the detailed membrane binding properties of the I-BAR of IRSp53 and its relations to the actin cytoskeleton. In vitro FRET experiments and fluorescence quenching studies were carried out between the I-BAR and liposomes made up from different lipid constructs. We have found that the I-BAR has preference to bind to the negatively charged lipids however it can also bind to the uncharged lipids. The fluorescence quenching studies reflected that the accessibility of the I-BAR surface was higher toward the negatively charged lipids than for the uncharged ones. TNS fluorescence assay reflected that the I-BAR domain binds to the surface of the micells rather than penetrating into its core. Lipid bilayers present a well-known order-disorder chain transition at ambient temperatures. This transition may become anomalous if the lipid head-group presents ionic dissociation at low ionic strength, as detected by several experimental techniques: between the gel and the liquid phases an intermediate phase appears as a shoulder in the specific heat, a deep in turbulence or a maximum in conductivity. We propose a statistical model which allows ionic dissociation of the polar group on the membrane surface and thus introduces competition between the hydrophobic interaction of hydrocarbonic chains, which favours the gel phase, at low temperatures, and the electrostatic interaction of charged head-groups, which favours the fluid phase, at higher temperatures. The model presents an intermediate fluid phase with higher dissociation and charge ordering on the membrane surface, beyond a sharp gel-fluid transition. The model presents increasing temperature of the main transition by addition of salt, as well as the shrinking of the anomalous region as chain length increases. Model thermodynamic behavior is compared to results for PGs, phospholipids with a glycerol head-group. The well-programmed membrane fusion systems, operating in a weakly acidic environment, have attracted attention in the fields of biochemistry, biophysics, and pharmacy because these acidic conditions are generally observed in endosomal membranes or tumor tissues.

In recent years, buckwheat has been of great interest in the world markets of healthy food, due to its high energy value, the content of unsaturated fatty acids, mineral constituents and vitamins. Its seeds contain flavonoids which are natural, efficient antioxidants. The aim of the present studies was to investigate the effect of buckwheat extracts on the properties of biological membrane, which is the main site of the interaction between the substances buckwheat contains and the organism. The research was conducted on red blood cells and their isolated membranes, using the spectrophotometric, microscopic and fluorimetric methods. From the results obtained it follows that the compounds contained in buckwheat extracts increase the osmotic resistance of erythrocytes, making them less sensitive to the medium's osmotic pressure, induce changes in cell shape, producing increased number of echinocytes, and decrease the packing order of the polar heads of membrane lipids. It can thus be inferred that the compounds contained in the extracts penetrate the hydrophobic region of the erythrocyte membrane and alter its properties. .Due to its small size, symmetric structure, amphipathicity, proteolytic stability and testable mode of activity, the GS backbone is a convenient model system to examine the structure-activity relationship of individual amino acid substitutions. We have previously reported the structure analysis of two GS analogues in which either the Val or Leu residues on the hydrophobic face of the molecule were substituted by the aliphatic 19 F-labeled amino acid 4F-Phg. Using 19 F-ssNMR in oriented lipid bilayers, we observed a re-alignment of the peptide that is compatible with the formation of a putative pore [Top.Curr.Chem. 273:139]. Here, we present novel analogs of GS with different 19 F-prolines in the b-turn region, and with CF 3 -Bpg in place of Leu. Based on these 19 F-ssNMR results and supported by CD, DSC and activity tests, we could demonstrate that all analogues are structurally intact and antimicrobially active. We observe, however, differences in the re-alignment propensity when comparing these GS analogues in DLPC and DMPC bilayers. These differences can be rationalized in terms of molecular shape being changed upon incorporation of unnatural amino acids at various sites of the molecule. The beta-propiolactone (BPL) is an inactivating reagent commonly used to produce viral vaccine preparations (whole virions or split-virions). Although BPL has been reported to inactivate nucleic acids, its mechanism of action on proteins and the outcome on viral infection remains ill-defined. In this work, H3N2/Victoria/210/2009 influenza virus strain has been submitted to various BPL inactivation conditions (from 2lM to 1 mM). Cell infection ability was progressively reduced and entirely abolished at 1 mM BPL. To clarify the BPL effect, we focused on membrane fusion infection steps using kinetic fluorescence molecule leakage from liposome and lipid FRET assays combined with cryo electron microscopy. Membrane fusion measured at pH 5 on GM3 liposomes was reduced in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly the fusion activity was partially restored using the proton-ionophore monensin as confirmed by cryoEM images. In addition, a decrease of molecule leakage irrespective to BPL concentration was measured suggesting that the hemagglutinin affinity for GM3 was slightly modified even at low BPL concentration. Altogether these results strongly suggest that BPL treatment impairs M2 protein activity likely by preventing proton transport and bring new light on the mechanism of action of BPL. Cellular membranes have a heterogeneous lipid composition, potentially forming nano-domains or membrane rafts, believed to be platforms of altered fluidity involved in protein sorting and trafficking 1 . An alternative mechanism, potentially leading to protein sorting, has recently been proposed, suggesting that the curvature of membranes can also actively regulate protein localization 2 . Recently we showed that a variety of protein anchoring motifs are membrane-curvature sensors and thus up concentrate in regions of high membrane curvature 3 . Furthermore the curvature sensing ability of the anchoring motifs persisted independently of their structural characteristics. This leads us to speculate that curvature sensing might be an inherent property of any curved membrane and as a consequence, the lipid composition of the bilayer could potentially regulate this recruitment by membrane curvature. Thus there might be an intimate, yet unrecognized, link between the way raft-like membrane domains and membrane-curvature promotes the localization of membrane-anchored proteins. We examined how changing the lipid composition of liposomes influenced the recruitment by membrane curvature of a model amphiphilic protein-anchoring motif. Employing our single liposome curvature assay, we tested lipid mixtures with different ratios of DOPC, sphingomyelin and cholesterol, giving rise to liposome populations of different phase-states. We found an amplified recruitment by membrane curvature for all raft-like l o phase-state mixtures when compared to the l d phase-state counterparts. Based on these findings we suggest a synergetic effect when combining a raft-like lipid phase-state and high membrane curvature, resulting in a highly potent mechanism for selective localization of membrane-anchored proteins. Keywords: Non-lamellar lipid structure, phase transition, Minerval, 2-hydroxylated fatty acid. Minerval (2-hydroxyoleic acid), a potent antitumoral drug, is known to modulate the lipid membrane structure by decreasing the lamellar-to-non-lamellar phase transition temperature (T H ). A series of 2-hydroxy fatty acid derivatives, varying in acyl chain length and degree of unsaturation, have been analyzed in terms of their ability to stabilize the inverted hexagonal (H II ) phase in palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine membranes. Differential Scanning Calorimetry and 31 P-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance showed that mono-and polyunsaturated, but not saturated, 2-hydroxylated fatty acid molecules were able to decrease the T H . Lipid vesicles mimicking the lipid composition of a cell membrane were solubilized at 4\u00b0C in the presence of Triton X-100. The results demonstrated that the amount of detergent-resistant membranes, which are related to liquid ordered (Lo) structures, decreased in the presence of 2-hydroxylated fatty acids. The so-called Lipid Membrane Therapy focuses on the reversion of cell disfunction through the modulation of the membrane structure, thus altering the activity of membrane-associated proteins. The ability to modify the biophysical properties of a lipid membrane makes the studied 2-hydroxylated fatty acid molecules be prospective candidates for the use in the Lipid Membrane Therapy. ]. However, a significant downward divergence occurs above 4 mol % of probe content, which might indicate deviations to ideal mixing in fluid phase. Results for b-py-C 10 -HPC, in mixtures of POPC with 10 and 20 mol % POPS were indistinguishable from those obtained with pure POPC vesicles; however excimer formation in pure POPS bilayers appears to be appreciably higher. We also compared the excimer formation findings with quenching of the same probes by low concentrations of DOXYL quencher groups labeled acyl phospholipid chain at the same depth of the pyrenyl group. The results are also scrutinized by the same two-dimensional kinetic formalism and good correlation was also found.

This resolves itself essentially into two aspects. The first systematises the dependence of membrane biophysical parameters on lipid molecular structure. Lipid volumes, membrane dimensions, chain-melting temperatures and enthalpies, nonlamellar phase formation and structure, critical micelle concentrations and thermodynamics of membrane formation, membrane-membrane interactions and lipid transfer are amongst the properties of central biophysical interest. The relevant structural parameters are lipid chain length, degree of unsaturation, chain branching and headgroup configuration. The second, more complex and less well developed, aspect concerns the lipidlipid interactions that determine the membrane properties of lipid mixtures. In part, these can be obtained from binary phase diagrams, and the more limited number of ternary phase diagrams -notably with cholesterol -that are available. Extrapolation to higher order mixtures lies in the future. I shall attempt to summarise some of the progress in these directions. The immediate aim is a second edition of my Handbook of Lipid Bilayers, which, in addition to a vastly expanded database, will include interpretative features and will be available in the early part of next year. Lateral diffusion dynamics in phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol bilayers has been mostly accessed by means of EPR, NMR and FCS spectroscopic techniques. Reliable stady-state florescence quenching analysis of diffusion-controlled processes has been ampered by the lack of a self-consistent kinetic formalism for the two-dimensional (2D) counterpart of the classical Stern-Volmer analysis for three-dimensional (3D) solvents. We studied the excimer formation of phospholipid-labeled pyrenyl probes (proportion of 4 mol %) in mixed POPC/Cholestrol MLV liposomes by combined steady-state and timeresolved fluorescence The findings are in very good agreement with the theoretical predictions of the kinetic formalism specific for fluorescence quenching processes occurring in The small hydrophobic head group, the closely packed acyl chains, and the capability of interfacial hydrogen bonding have been suggested to govern the characteristic membrane behavior of long chain saturated ceramides: the self-segregation, and the formation of hexagonal phases and highly ordered gel phases. While it has been shown that structural alterations of the ceramide acyl chains induce position dependent effects on their behavior, we wanted to study the effect of interfacial properties, including hydrogen bonding, on ceramide membrane properties. The H-bond donor functions of 2NH and 3OH in the sphingosine backbone of palmitoylceramide were disrupted either separately or simultaneously by replacing the hydrogen with a methyl-group. When the lateral phase behavior of mixed bilayers containing cholesterol/sphingomyelin-rich domains was studied in the presence of the ceramide analogs, the 3O-methylated ceramide appeared to form a thermally stable, sterol-excluding gel phase with sphingomyelin, whereas the 2O-methylated ceramide failed in both thermal stabilization and sterol displacement. The doubly methylated analog was the poorest ceramide mimic. Together with the possible steric effects induced by the methylations, the lack of 2NH H-bond donor function impaired ceramide membrane behavior to a greater degree than the lack of 3OH H-bond donor function. Sugar-based surfactants are made from renewable resources using the ''green chemistry'' methods, are easily biodegradable and used in washing agents, cosmetics, and drug carriers. Besides, there are attempts to use them as nonviral vectors in gene therapy. We studied the influence of new x-(alkyldimethylamonium)alkylaldonamide bromides (C n GAB) with different chain lengths (n = 10, 12, 14, 16) on the thermotropic phase behavior of DPPC, and DPPC/chol bilayers by means of differential scanning calorimetry. The surfactants were added either to the water phase or directly to the lipid phase (a mixed film was formed). We analyzed the changes in the temperatures, enthalpies and shapes of the main phase transitions as a function of concentration. Molecular modeling methods were also used. Cytotoxicicity of the C n GABs was determined in the cell line L929 and A549. For cytotoxicity test, the cells were seeded in 96-well plates 1 ml of 2\u00c110 6 cells/ml in the culture medium Eagle'a or Dulbecco with 2% calf serum, penicillin and streptomycin was deposited into each plates.

This work was supported by grant N N305 361739. Membrane fusion is ubiquitous in life requiring remodeling of two phospholipid bilayers. As supported by many experimental results and theoretical analyses, merging of membranes seems to proceed via similar sequential intermediates. Contacting membranes form a stalk between the proximal leaflets which expand radially into a hemifusion diaphragm (HD) and subsequently open to a fusion pore. Direct experimental verification of the HD is difficult due to its transient nature. Using confocal fluorescence microscopy we have investigated the fusion of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) containing fluorescent membrane protein anchors and fluorescent lipid analogues in the presence of divalent cations. Time resolved imaging revealed that fusion was preceded by displacement of peptides and lipid analogues from the GUV-GUV contact region being of several lm in size. A detailed analysis showed that this structure is consistent with the formation of an HD. A quantitative model of the hemifusion equilibrium and kinetics of the growing HD was developed. Bilayer tension could be shown to drive HD expansion and interleaflet tension was found to act as a counterforce, because the outer leaflets are compressed upon HD growth.

Yet, their molecular mode of action remains elusive. While one school favors specific (direct) interactions with proteins of the central nervous system, another school adheres to a nonspecific modulation of biophysical membrane properties. One of the strongest arguments against lipid theories is the absence of stereo-specific effects in model membranes, as opposed to their detection by electrophysiological measurements on ionchannels.

We further calculated the effect of the lateral pressure profile changes on the opening probability of an ion-channel using crystallographic information.

In each series, the lipid headgroups were phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylserine (PS), while the acyl chains consisted of symmetric monounsaturated di(18:1), mixed (16:0)(18:1), and methylated di(16:0-4ME). In order to minimize the effect of headgroup electrostatics, measurements where performed in 1M KCl salts.

For the lipids considered, gA lifetimes cover a range from 0.7 seconds in the DOPE lipid to 18 seconds in DPhPS. In this range, we find a Gaussian dependence of gA lifetime on bilayer thickness, consistent with hydrophobic matching models. We discuss different aspects of channel-lipid interactions and to what extent measurements of gA lifetime in binary mixtures are consistent with measurements in pure lipid systems. [ The aim of the studies was to determine the effect of chlorogenic acid (CGA), which is the main constituent of plant extracts, on properties of the model membranes. Its effect was studied on temperature of the main phase transition of various lipids with and without presence of cholesterol, using the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method and the fluorimetric method. In particular, the degree of packing order of the hydrophilic phase of liposomes was determined using the laurdan and prodan probes, and fluorescence anisotropy of the hydrophobic phase with the probes DPH and TMA-DPH. It had also been studied the effect of chlorogenic acid on the structure and capacity of black lipid membranes (BLMs), formed of egg lecithin and lipids extracted from erythrocytes. The results obtained indicate that CGA lowers the main phase transition temperature slightly, without changing the fluorescence anisotropy in the hydrophobic part of the bilyer, and causes a decease in the packing order of the hydrophilic phase. By monitoring the capacity during BLM formation we have found that the presence of chlorogenic acid accelerates the process of lipid self-organization into a bilayer, and increases stability and life of the BLMs. However, the was no effect of CGA on specific capacity of the membranes, and thus on thickness of the liposome membrane hydrophobic layer.

Many examples have recently been found where biological processes in the lipid bilayer are affected by the changes in the physicochemical properties of the membrane, e.g. the local curvature, the membrane tension and certainly the membrane structure. It has been shown that the activity of polyene antibiotics is strongly correlated to the phase diagram in a membrane composed of a mixture of POPC and ergosterol or cholesterol (J Membrane Biol, 237:41-49, (2010)). It is known that polyene action is quite sensitive to the type of sterol in the membrane, which enables its medical use, mainly as antifungals. It has been proposed that this selectivity of the drug to fungi is related to structure modulation by the sterols (see for example, Biophys. J., 85, 2323, (2003)) and therefore the correlation found could be due to structural differences between POPC/ergosterol and POPC/ cholesterol along the corresponding phase diagrams. To investigate this, Molecular Dynamics simulations of the above mixtures along their phase diagrams were performed. It was found that there are indeed marked differences in structure along the phase diagrams, but for the sterol-sterol distribution function.

The binding reduces the rotational freedom of the lipid molecules, as could be shown by an analysis of the CH 2 -streching vibrations. PLA binds in a b-sheet conformation to PG or PA gel phase membranes whereas its structure in bulk is random coil.

In spite of the widespread use and study of such membrane phenomena, their theoretical analysis is rather scarce. Our main goal here is to understand the process during which membrane vesicles first adhere to solid surfaces, then rupture (or go through a series of transient ruptures) due to the mechanical tension induced by the adhesion, and finally spread along the surface forming a supported lipid bilayer. In our theoretical description we simultaneously consider the dynamics of spontaneous pore opening and closing; volume loss via leakage through the pores; and the advancement of the adhesion front. All these processes are supposed to follow an overdamped dynamics and coupled to each other through membrane tension. Our numerical simulations reveal that the rupture process consists of three well distinguishable phases: a fast initial volume loss; followed by a slow volume loss; ending with a final burst and surface spreading. The second phase can be skipped if either the first phase advances far enough or the third phase sets in early enough. The smaller the vesicle, the further the first phase can advance. The third phase can start earlier if either the surface is smooth enough, or the adhesion energy is large enough, or the line tension is small enough. When the second phase is not skipped the time needed for the rupture process can take very long with a large variance. In the realistic range of the material properties (line tension, bending rigidity) the process is qualitatively always the same, so the most decisive parameter remains the size of the vesicle: the smaller the vesicle the faster and easier it ruptures.

We found that resveratrol elevated the number of domains per vesicle, decreased their area and markedly increased the total length of domain border without affecting domains' circular shape. Surprisingly, no such effect was observed for piceatannol differing from resveratrol by one hydroxyl group only. Neither genistein nor 8-prenylnaringenin changed the morphology of lipid domains significantly.

T curve describe quantitatively the interfacial landscape around the protein molecules and can be used for the distinction between the globular and IDP states. The behavior of the T 1 and T 2 data showed that there are two reorientation types present for every protein solutions below 0\u00b0C, irrespective for the nature of the protein or the solvent composition. Local field fluctuation and the BPP models were applied, which failed for the buffered protein solutions and for the IDPs dissolved in water. A main cause of the failure is the changing h in the analyzed temperature range. This case is valid for the solutions of IDPs and for buffered solutions of both protein types. Another cause can be the active relaxation channels other than dipolar when ions of quadrupolar nuclei are present. Ligand-induced disorder-to-order transition plays a key role in the biological functions of many proteins that contain intrinsically disordered regions. This trait is exhibited by RTX (Repeat in ToXin) motifs found in more than 250 virulence factors secreted by Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. We investigated several CyaA RTX polypeptides of different lengths ranging from 111 to 706 residues. We showed that the RTX proteins exhibit the hallmarks of intrinsically disordered proteins in the absence of calcium: they adopt premolten globule conformations and exhibit a strong timeaveraged apparent hydration, due in part to the internal electrostatic repulsions between negatively charged residues, as revealed by the high mean net charge. Calcium binding triggers a strong reduction of the mean net charge, dehydration and compaction, folding and stabilization of secondary and tertiary structures of the RTX proteins. We propose that the intrinsically disordered character of the RTX proteins may facilitate the uptake and secretion of virulence factors through the bacterial secretion machinery. These results support the hypothesis that the folding reaction is achieved upon protein secretion and, in the case of proteins containing RTX motifs, could be finely regulated by the calcium gradient across bacterial cell wall. Occupational exposure to heavy metals has been recognized to be a risk factor for Parkinson's Disease via metaltriggered deposition of alpha-synuclein (aS) 1,2 . In the present work, Al 3? induced conformational change and instant oligomerization of aS have been studied using FRET and FCS as main techniques. Donor and acceptor were labeled in the C-terminal at positions A107C and A140C. The average lifetime of donor in the presence of acceptor increases with the increase of Al 3? concentration, indicating aS adopts a more extended conformation upon Al 3? binding. The intrinsic Tyr fluorescence rises sharply within the mixing dead time, reflecting an enhanced hydrophobicity of the Tyr environment and a fast conformational change of aS. Al 3? also induces an immediate oligomerization of aS as monitored by FCS. The diffusion coefficient of aS changes from 85 \u00b1 5 lm 2 /s as monomer state to 23 \u00b1 5 lm 2 /s as oligomer state. The oligomerization is supposed to be induced by the ligand bridging of trivalent Al ions. Nearly 2% of human genes encode protein-kinases (PK), enzymes involved in cellular signaling and several other vital biochemical functions, which transfer phosphate groups from ATP to specific target molecules, modifying their activity. [1] Deregulated PK have been linked to numerous diseases including cancer and diabetes, making them attractive targets for drug design. [2] Conformational transitions play a central role in regulating the phosphorylation activity. PK adopt an on state that is maximally active and one or more inactive states that shows minimal activity. [3] The similarity of the relatively rigid and largely conserved ATP binding site makes the design of selective inhibitors binding to the active state very difficult. Indeed some of the best cancer therapies available are based on inhibitors, as Imatinib, that bind to inactive states peculiar to a small subset of PK (Abl, c-Kit and PDGFR in the case on Imatinib). Thus, understanding the atomic details of the active to inactive transitions in kinases has a great importance. Here we study a particular active-toinactive transition of c-Src, a fundamental proto-oncogene involved in cancer and metastasis, by using multi-microsecond long fully solvated molecular dynamics simulations, metadynamics and PTmetaD calculations [4, 5] . The results, validated by mutagenesis, x-ray crystallography and binding kinetics, are suggestive of a functional role for the conformational transition. Moreover, we were able to single out the most important residues affecting the conformational transition and to show that even a very conservative amino-acid substitution can have a dramatic effect on the conformational free energy landscape. The time-scales of protein folding events range over many orders of magnitude. In order to understand the complex folding mechanisms, peptides with well-defined secondary structure are often used as model systems as they may be regarded as smallest folding units of proteins. The formation of secondary structure elements occur on the nanosecond to low microsecond time scale. Thus, stopped-flow techniques are too slow whereas pulsed laser techniques are capable to trigger folding processes in nanoseconds and to analyze faster folding events.

We demonstrate how equilibrium and time-resolved infrared spectroscopic data can be combined to deduce folding rates. Unfolding and refolding studies using chemical denaturants have contributed tremendously to our understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding and stability. However, a major limitation of this approach lies in the large uncertainty inherent in the extrapolation of the free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant from free energy values measured at finite denaturant concentrations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-644"}, {"text": "Here we show that this limitation can be overcome by combining multiple spectroscopic signals-including fluorescence, circular dichroism, and absorbance-recorded in a quasi-simultaneous and fully automated way at different wavelengths.

Compared with the traditional approach based on the use of a single or a few wavelengths, we could thus improve the precision of the free energy value by an order of magnitude. We exemplify and validate this novel approach using representative, well-studied globular proteins and explain how it can be exploited to quantify subtle changes in membrane-protein stability which have thus far remained elusive. The rates of protein conformational changes are usually not only limited by external but also internal friction, however, the origin and significance of this latter phenomenon is poorly understood. It is often found experimentally that a linear fit to the reciprocal of the reaction rate as a function of the viscosity of the external medium has a non-zero 1 , the physical basis of pressure unfolding is still largely unknown. We report here a specific study of cavities contributions to the volume difference between unfolded and folded states (DV u ), using four single point mutants of Staphylococcus nuclease (SNase). Each mutation is localised in a strategic position on the protein structure and was designed to change a large buried hydrophobic side chain into alanine, thus opening tunable cavities in the SNase 3D structure. Measuring HSQCs peaks intensities up to 2500 bar monitored the equilibrium high pressure unfolding and leads us to precise estimations of DV u for more than two-thirds of the 143 residues of each mutant. SO-FAST HMQC experiments 2 were also performed to measure folding and unfolding rates from 200 bar pressure jumps. High-pressure fluorescence experiments were done on six additional alanine mutants to complement the NMR study, allowing a more complete exploration of the local pressure sensitivity along the protein 3D structure.

The repetitive nature of the Nank protein was used to study influence of the protein size on DV u in a systematic way with a set of deletion mutants. High-pressure fluorescence data provided new evidences that neither peptide bonds hydration nor side chains differential hydration could be considered as major contributor to the measured DV u value. Additional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations rather suggested that the heterogeneous distribution of void volume in the folded states structures could explain the DV u variations among the Nank deletion mutants. The specific issue of the void volume contribution to DV u values was studied using 10 cavity mutants in SNase, allowing a large structural mapping of the alanine mutations on this globular protein. Combination of X-ray crystallography, highpressure fluorescence, high-pressure NMR and MD simulations provided a first clear determination of the void volume contribution to the DV u values. These results also bring an unprecedented complex and heterogeneous picture at a residue level of the apparent two-state folding process of SNase. We expressed an Ig domain (I27) and a 170-residue-long fragment of the PEVK domain in order to investigate the effect of temperature and pressure on their conformation. FTIR spectroscopy is a useful method for investigating the secondary structure of proteins. We analyzed the amide I band to obtain information on protein structure. Fluorescence labeling was also used in some experiments. To generate high pressures, a diamond anvil cell was employed. The FTIR and fluorescence spectra of the protein fragments were recorded across the pressure and temperature ranges of 0-1 GPa and 0-100\u00b0C, respectively. Moderate changes were observed in the conformation of the PEVK fragments in the explored range of the T-p plane, suggesting that the domain is a highly flexible, random-coil across the entire studied T-p range. By contrast, the I27 domain showed quite stable secondary structure. Intrinsically disordered proteins participate in important regulatory functions in the cell, including regulation of transcription, translation, the cell cycle, and numerous signal transduction events. Disordered proteins often undergo coupled folding and binding transitions upon interaction with their cellular targets. The lack of stable globular structure can confer numerous functional advantages, including, paradoxically, both binding promiscuity and high specificity in target interactions. NMR is unique in being able to provide detailed insights into the intrinsic conformational preferences and dynamics of unfolded and partly folded proteins, and into the mechanism of coupled folding and binding. The function of intrinsically disordered protein domains in transcriptional regulation and signaling will be described, with particular reference to the general transcriptional coactivators CBP and p300, the tumor suppressor p53, and the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein. The globular domains of CBP/p300 are targets for coupled folding and binding of disordered transactivation motifs of numerous transcription factors and viral oncogenes, which compete for binding to limiting amounts of CBP/p300. Many intrinsically disordered proteins contain multipartite interaction motifs that perform an essential function in the integration of complex signaling networks. The role of multipartite binding motifs and post translational modifications in regulation of p53-mediated signaling pathways will be discussed. The early vascular network is one of the simplest functioning organs in the embryo. Its formation involves only one cell type and it can be readily observed and manipulated in avian embryos or in vitro explants. The early vascular network of warm-blooded vertebrates self-organizes by the collective motility of cell streams, or multicellular ''sprouts''. The elongation of these future vascular network segments depends on a continuous supply of cells, moving along the sprout towards its tip. To understand the observed self-organization process, we investigate computational models containing interactions between adherent, polarized and self-propelled cells. By comparing the simulations with data from in vivo or simplistic in vitro experiments, we explore the role of active migration, leader cells, invasion of the ECM, and cell guidance by micromechanical properties of adjacent cell surfaces. Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a promising method for treating the highly fatal brain tumor; glioblastoma multiform. It is a binary modality; in which use is made of two components simultaneously; viz. thermal neutrons and Boron-10. The biophysics of BNCT is very complicated; primarily due to the complexity of element composition of the brain. Moreover; numerous components contributes to the over all radiation dose both to normal brain and to tumor. Simple algebraic summation cannot be applied to these dose components, since each component should at first be weighed by its relative biological effectiveness (RBE) value. Unfortunately, there is no worldwide agreement on these RBE values. Thermal neutrons were formerly employed for BNCT, but they failed to prove therapeutic efficacy. Later on; epithermal neutrons were suggested proposing that they would be enough thermalized while transporting in the brain tissues.

It forms in the neural folds at the border of the neural plate and gives rise to a huge variety of cells, tissues and organs. One of the astonishing characteristic of neural crest cells is that they are able to migrate very long distances in the embryo. The neural crest has been called the ''explorer of the embryo'' as it is one of the embryonic cell types that migrate most during development, eventually colonizing almost every tissue. In this talk I will discuss our recent finding about neural crest migration. We have shown that neural crest cells, classically described as mesenchymal cells, migrate in large clusters Cytokinesis relies on tight regulation of the mechanical properties of the cell cortex, a thin acto-myosin network lying under the plasma membrane. Although most studies of cytokinetic mechanics focus on force generation at the equatorial acto-myosin ring, a contractile cortex remains at the poles of dividing cells throughout cytokinesis. Whether polar forces influence cytokinetic cell shape is poorly understood. Combining cell biology and biophysics, we demonstrate that the polar cortex makes cytokinesis inherently unstable and that any imbalance in contractile forces between the poles compromises furrow positioning. We show that limited asymmetric polar contractions occur during normal cytokinesis, and that perturbing the polar cortex leads to cell shape oscillations and division failure. A theoretical model based on a competition between cortex turnover and contraction dynamics accurately accounts for the oscillations. We further propose that blebs, membrane protrusions that commonly form at the poles of dividing cells, stabilise the position of the cleavage furrow by acting as valves releasing cortical contractility. Taken together, our findings show that the physical properties of the entire cell are integrated into a finetuned mechanical system ensuring successful cytokinesis. Collective motion of individual cells marks the onset of the transition to multicellularity in many microorganisms. This transition is often mediated by intercellular communication signals between cells. Here, we show, in contrast, that the transition from single cell to collective motion in an ensemble of gliding bacterial cells can be understood as a dynamical selfassembly process of self-propelled rods. Experiments were carried out with a mutant of the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus moving by means of the A-motility system only and without undergoing reversals. The collective motion phase is confined to a monolayer and is characterized by the organization of cells into larger moving clusters. A transition to collective motion is detected in experiments by image analysis, that reveals a qualitative change of the cluster-size distribution at a critical cell packing fraction around 17%. This transition is characterized by a scale-free power-law cluster size distribution with an exponent 0.88. We provide a theoretical model for cluster formation of self-propelled rods that reproduces the experimental findings for the cluster size distribution. Our findings suggest that the interplay of selfpropulsion of bacteria and volume exclusion effects of the rodshaped cell bodies is sufficient to explain the onset of collective motion and the related changes in the cluster statistics. Despite much speculation on the existence of structurally distinct oligomeric species associated with the conversion of certain monomeric proteins into amyloid fibrils, it has not previously been possible to observe them directly or to relate them to any key mechanistic steps involved in the interconversion process. We have developed a novel application of singlemolecule intermolecular FRET to investigate in unprecedented detail the aggregation and disaggregation of alpha-synuclein, the protein whose pathogenic deposition as intracellular Lewy bodies is a characteristic feature of Parkinson's disease. Our study reveals that a range of oligomers of different size and structure are formed, even at physiologically relevant concentrations. Interestingly, the resistance to degradation of the aggregated state of alpha-synuclein, which is a well- We focused on the structure-dynamics interplay and showed how the fractal-like properties of proteins lead to such anomalous dynamics. We used diffusion, a method sensitive to the structural features of the protein fold and them alone, in order to probe protein structure. Conducting a large scale study of diffusion on over 500 PDB structures we found it to be anomalous, an indication of a fractal-like structure. Taking advantage of known and newly derived relations between vibrational dynamics and diffusion, we demonstrated the equivalence of our findings to the existence of structurally originated anomalies in the vibrational dynamics of proteins. More specifically, the time dependent vibrational mean square displacement (MSD) of an amino acid is predicted to be subdiffusive. The thermal variance in the instantaneous distance between amino acids is shown to grow as a power law of the equilibrium distance. The autocorrelation function in time of the instantaneous distance between amino acids is shown to decay anomalously.

We also studied the dynamic structure factor S(k,t) of proteins at large wavenumbers k, kR g [ [1, with R g the gyration radius, that are sensitive to the protein internal dynamics. We showed that the decay of S(k,t) is dominated by the spatially averaged MSD of an amino acid. As a result, S(k,t) effectively decays as a stretched exponential. We compared our theory with recent neutron spin-echo studies of myoglobin and hemoglobin for the Rouse and Zimm models of hydrodynamic friction.

(ii) The unfolding of a protein under the exertion of a large pulling force. Allosteric regulation of enzymatic activity is crucial for controlling a multitude of fundamental cellular processes. Yet the molecular level details underlying regulation often remain poorly understood. Here we employed single molecule activity studies to dissect the mechanistic origin of enzymatic activity regulation. As a model system we employed a lipase and measured its activity as a function of accessibility to surface tethered liposomes (1), which are known regulators of its activity. Our results surprisingly revealed that the lipase oscillates between 2 states of different activity. We accurately quantified for the first time both the interconversion rates between activity states and the inherent activity of these states. Based on these we calculated the energetic landscape of the entire reaction pathway and identified that regulatory interactions redistributed the probability to reside on preexisting enzymatic activity states but did not alter the activity of these states. Our findings provide the missing link between conformational and activity substates supporting and represent the first direct validation of the textbook hypothesis of conformational selection for regulation of enzymatic activity To identify the potential targets of cGMP in Arabidopsis plants we adopted a proteomic approach to isolate possible cGMP-binding proteins. Purification of soluble cGMP-binding proteins was performed using cGMP-agarose-based affinity chromatography procedure. Next eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE which revealed ten bands. We focused the subsequent analysis on low-molecular peptides of 15, 16 and18 kDa which were bound cGMP more intensively. After 2D-IEF-PAGE of the proteins isolated by cGMP-agaroseaffinity chromatography eight most abundant protein spots in the low-molecular area were visualized. These spots of interest were excised from the gel and in gel digested by trypsin. Then tryptic peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and identified as isoforms of nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) from Arabidopsis.

SecA binds to SecYEG as a dimer with a nucleotideand preprotein-dependent dissociation constant. One of the SecA protomers binds SecYEG in a salt-resistant manner, while binding of the second protomer is salt-sensitive. Since protein translocation is salt-sensitive we conclude that the dimeric state of SecA is required for protein translocation.

Recent achievements in rational DNA-motors engineering demonstrate the possibility to design nano-motors and nanorobots capable of performing externally controlled or programmed tasks.

The ribosome-mRNAs complexes are fixed to a microscope coverslip through the mRNA, and mRNAs are located through fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides hybridized to it downstream start codon. Because of the ribosome helicase activity, the double strand formed by the oligonucleotide and the mRNA is opened while the ribosome translates this region of the mRNA. Thus, the loss of the fluorescence signal allows us to measure the distribution of translation speed of single ribosomes. Careful attention was given to photobleaching for the data analysis. This experiment opens the door to the study of eukaryotic translation at the single molecule level. Erythrocyte hyperaggregation, a cardiovascular risk factor, has been associated to high plasma concentrations of fibrinogen. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based force spectroscopy measurements, we have recently identified the erythrocyte membrane receptor for fibrinogen, an integrin with a a3 or a3-like subunit [1] . After this, we extended the study to the influence of erythrocyte aging on fibrinogen binding [2] . Force spectroscopy measurements showed that upon erythrocyte aging, there is a decrease of the binding to fibrinogen by decreasing the frequency of its occurrence (from 18.6% to 4.6%) but not its force. This observation is reinforced by zeta-potential and fluorescence spectroscopy measurements. Knowing that younger erythrocytes bind more to fibrinogen, we could presume that this population is the main contributor to the cardiovascular diseases associated with increased fibrinogen blood content, which disturbs the blood flow. Our data also show that sialic acid residues on the erythrocyte membrane contribute for the interaction with fibrinogen, possibly by facilitating the binding to its receptor. Antimicrobial peptides are usually polycationic and amphiphilic with high affinity for bacterial membranes. In order to characterize their therapeutic potential it is crucial to disclose which properties of the peptide/lipids are important for target selectivity, and to examine the peptide structure and its association with lipid bilayers.

Peptides or proteins may convert (under some conditions) from their soluble forms into highly ordered fibrillar aggregates. In vivo such transitions can lead to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease. Alzheimer's Disease is characterised by the extracellular deposition of Abeta peptide in amyloid plaques, and the intracellular formation of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) deposits within neurons, the latter correlating well with disease severity. The major constituent of NFT deposits are paired helical filaments (PHF) composed of a microtubule-associated protein known as tau. Studying the process by which tau forms these large aggregates may be an essential step in understanding the molecular basis of Alzheimer's Disease and other Tauopathies. We have applied a two-colour single molecule fluorescence technique, and single molecule intermolecular FRET measurements to study the soluble oligomers of tau which are formed during the aggregation and disaggregation of PHF's. The neuronal protein alpha-synuclein is considered to play a critical role in the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease. Fibrillar aggregates of alpha-synuclein are the main constituents of the Lewy bodies that are found in the brains of Parkinson patients.

In recent years biomedical applications of diamond nanoparticles have become of significant interest, which rises questions of their biocompatibility and mechanisms of interactions with cells. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of nonmodified diamond nanoparticles (DNPs) and DNPs modified by the Fenton reaction on human endothelial cells. DNPs (\\10 nm particle size, SIGMA) were modified by the Fenton reaction introducing surface -OH groups. Immortalized human endothelial cells (HUVEC-ST) were incubated with 2-100 lg/ml DNPs in the OPTIMEM medium. Diamond nanoparticles modified by the Fenton reaction had smaller hydrodynamic diameter estimated by dynamic light scattering and the surface potential (zeta potential) measured using laser-Doppler electrophoresis. They were more cytotoxic as evaluated by the MTT reduction assay. DNPs augmented generation of reactive oxygen species in the cells, estimated by oxidation of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin, the effect being higher for the Fenton-modified DNPs after 48-h incubation. Cellular production of nitric oxide, estimated with DAF-FM, was also affected by DNPs; after 72h, Fentonmodified OH, in contrast to non-modified diamond, decreased NO production. Diamond nanoparticles affected also the cellular level of glutathione and activities of main antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase). We aim at investigating how photoreactions of proteins can be controlled by means of intense THz radiation tuned in resonance to specific vibrational modes, much in analogy to coherent control experiments conducted by fs NIR laser pulses [1] . For this we will combine a time-resolved IR difference spectroscopic setup with uniquely intense, tunable narrow bandwidth THz radiation (3 -280 lm) at the ps beamline of the THz free electron laser FELBE. These experiments will be performed on bacteriorhodopsin (bR) which is the sole protein of the purple membrane of the archaebacterium Halobacterium salinarum [2] . Upon illumination, the chromophore retinal isomerizes around the C 13 -C 14 double bond [3] and bR pumps a proton from the cytoplasmic to the extracellular side. This proton gradient is used by the bacterium to drive photosynthetic ATP production under low oxygen tension [4] . In our experiment, the photoreaction is initiated by a visible laser pulse as in standard experiments, but then the sample will be irradiated by a THz pulse from the free electron laser tuned into resonance with low-energy vibrational modes which is supposed to influence the photoreaction [1] . Such vibrational control will be monitored by time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy using the step-scan technique [5] . Liposomes are increasingly studied as nanoscale drug delivery systems and biomembrane models. However the exact structure dynamics and mechanical behavior of liposomes is little known. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a powerful tool to characterize nanoscale morphology and enables the mechanical manipulation of submicron-sized vesicles.

Long-term non-invasive in vivo monitoring of the survival, migration, homing and fate of transplanted cells is of key importance for the success of cell therapy and regenerative medicine. Tools for in vivo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of labeled cells are therefore being developed. We have prepared superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles by the coprecipitation of Fe(II) and Fe(III) salts and oxidation. To stabilize the particles and to facilitate their internalization by the cells, the nanoparticles were coated with several novel low-and highmolecular weight compounds including D-mannose, poly(Llysin), poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) and dopamine-hyaluronate conjugate. The surface-modified magnetic nanoparticles were thoroughly characterized by a range of physico-chemical methods, which proved the presence of the coating on the particles. The particles were then investigated in stem cell experiments in terms of real time cell proliferation analysis, viability, labeling efficiency and differentiation. The iron oxide concentration of the labeled cells was assessed using MR relaxometry. The advantages/disadvantages of particular iron oxide coatings will be discussed and the optimal coating suggested.

In the last decades the interest towards the fabrication of innovative bio-sensors with improved sensitivity and reliability for medical-diagnostics applications has been constantly risen. Among the different techniques, microfluidic systems are playing a major role. In order to detect extremely low concentrations of biomolecules (pM and fM), attention should be placed on the controlled, selective functionalization of micro-and nano-channels. In this work we propose a new approach to functionalize gold patches inside fluidic channels. We start from self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of thiolated molecules on a gold electrode deposited inside the channel. Then, by using an electrochemical approach [1, 2] we remove molecules from the SAM at selected locations, by applying a negative voltage to the electrode. The newly exposed gold surface can be re-functionalized by using a thiolated biomolecule (i.e an antibody) capable to bind specific proteins flowing inside the channel. The cycle can be applied to other electrodes in the microfluidic system, creating a multiplexing device which, as we will show, can differentially measure ionic current flows in different channels. Optically actuated micromanipulation and micro-probing of biological samples are increasingly important methods in the today's laboratory. Microbeads as probes are the most commonly used tools in this field, although the only manipulative motion they allow is translation. We present polymerized 3D microstructures which can also be used for optical micromanipulation with more degree of freedom than microbeads. The two-photon polymerization (TPP), based on focused fs laser beam into appropriate photopolymers is a powerful method to build structures of arbitrary complexity with submicrometer resolution. The presented tools have the advantage of being capable of twisting and rotational manipulative motion, and also that the position of biological manipulation and optical trapping is spatially separated. Different manipulative interfaces, the positioning stability and surface activation of the manipulators will be discussed. The potential application of multiplexed quantum dot labeling, MQDL, in clinical detection, prognosis and monitoring therapeutic response has attracted high interests from bioengineers, pathologists and cancer biologists. MQDL is superior comparing with conventional organic dye staining in its narrow emission bandwidths, wide signal dynamic ranges, high detection sensitivity, and low noise to signal ratios. However, the majority of the MQDL application has been limited to identification of specific cell type or cancer subtype and the improvement in labeling methodology. In this study, we focused on simultaneous detection and analysis of 5 proteins in the c-MET activation pathway, i.e. RANKL, VEGF, NRPLN-1, p-c-MET and Mcl-1, which are known to be associated with human prostate cancer progression and metastasis. Two experimental systems were analyzed: 1) fixed xenograft tissues from an established LTL313 castration resistance human prostate cancer or CRPC model; and 2) clinical prostate tissue specimens from localized cancer and bone metastasis. In the presentation we will report our experience in 1) the MQDL protocol optimization for the sequential reactions of individual primary antibody, the biotinylated secondary antibody and streptavidin-coated QD conjugate with nuclear DAPI staining; and 2) the multiplexed image catching, image unmixing, and subsequent per cell base quantification.

The release mechanisms can be further controlled by covering the microcontainers with additional polymer layers to increase diffusion and recrystallization time.

These flexible control mechanisms make this system an interesting candidate for pharmaceutical applications. Magnetic nanoparticles (NP) in combination with therapeutic molecules represent one of most promising methods for targeted drug delivery. One of major current limitations of magnetic drug targeting is to achieve efficient concentration of magnetic carrier-drug complexes at the targeted sites due to poor mobility of nanoparticles in tissue structures. Interstitial delivery is hindered by microscopic extracellular matrix, which represents a major barrier for nanoparticles motilities. In order to achieve efficient magnetic drug targeting it is crucial to know particle mobility in a given in vivo environment as well as to apply magnetic field having appropriate field gradient which drags magnetic NPs. We used gel magnetophoresis in order to measure motilities of different magnetic NPs (Co-ferrite, c-Fe 2 O 3 ) in agarose gel. Numerical modeling using FEM method was used to determine appropriate settings of magnets, which generate sufficient magnetic field gradient. Further, we used the numerical modeling to evaluate the magnetic force on the NPs for different geometries.

These and other approaches in application of developed NC and nanobiotechnologies are considered. This work was supported by STCU grants #1930, #4140, #4953. In the anti-cancer drug delivery domain, nanotechnologies are a promising tool, providing a good tissue distribution and a low toxicity. Drug delivery vehicles relying on solid nanoparticles have been proposed, among which diamond nanoparticle (size\\20 nm) is a very promising candidate [1] . We have investigated the delivery of siRNA by nanodiamonds (ND) into cells in culture, in the context of the treatment of a rare child bone cancer (Ewing sarcoma), by such a gene therapy. siRNA was bound to NDs after NDs coating by cationic polymers, so that the interaction is strong enough to pass the cell membrane without loss of the drug and does not prevent its subsequent release.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1578, "end": 1581, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-746"}, {"text": "The cellular studies showed a specific inhibition of the gene expression at the mRNA and protein level by the ND vectorized siRNA.

Silica nanoparticles are stable aqueous suspension of condensed siloxane nanocomposites, having an average diameter between 10 and 100 nm.

The formation of organized and functional tissues is a very complex task: the cellular environment requires suitable physiological conditions that, presently, can be achieved and maintained by using properly-designed bioreactors reproducing all specific functions and bioactive factors that assure viability/regeneration of cells cultured in an appropriate scaffold. The creation of biomimetic environment requires the use of biomaterials such as membranes with specific physico-chemical, morphological and transport properties on the basis of the targeted tissue or organ. Tailor-made membranes (organic, functionalized with specific biomolecules, in hollow-fiber configuration), designed and operated according to well-defined engineering criteria are able to sustain specific biotransformations, to provide adequate transport of oxygen, nutrients and catabolites throughout the cellular compartment, and to supply appropriate biomechanical stimuli of the developing tissue. In this talk the author will show the development of membrane engineered constructs focusing on liver and neuronal systems. The role of membrane surface and transport properties in providing instructive signals to the cells for the guiding of proliferation and differentiation will be discussed. Membrane bioreactors, which through the fluid dynamics modulation may simulate the in vivo complex physiological environment ensuring an adequate mass transfer of nutrients and metabolites and the molecular and mechanical regulatory signals, will be presented. Here we present a novel but simple system for cell-based assays enabling simultaneous testing of multiple samples on a same tissue without cross-contamination between neighbouring assays, as well as sequenced or repeated assays at the same tissue location. The principle of this method lies in the spatially-controlled diffusion of test compounds through a porous matrix to the target cells. A simple microfabrication technology was used to define areas where diffusion processes are allowed or inhibited. We performed proof-of-principle experiments on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells using Hoechst nuclear staining and calcein-AM cell viability assay. Fluorescent staining superimposed properly on membrane pattern with a dose-dependent response, indicating that both compounds specifically and selectively diffused to the target cells. MDCK cells similarly treated with cytochalasin B showed their actin network rapidly altered, thus demonstrating the suitability of this system for drug screening applications. Such a well-less cell-based screening system enabling multiple compounds testing on a same tissue and requiring very small volumes of test samples appears interesting for studying potential combined effects of different biochemicals applied separately or sequentially. It is generally believed that all-optical data processing is the most promising direction to achieve serious improvements both in capacity and speed of Internet data traffic. One of the bottlenecks of the state-of-the-art photonic integration technology is to find the proper nonlinear optical (NLO) materials that are supposed to serve as cladding media in waveguidebased integrated optical circuits performing light-controlled active functions.

Structure formation occurs by the post-printing fusion of the discrete bio-ink units. When the bio-ink units contain more than one cell type, fusion is accompanied by sorting of the cells into the physiologically relevant pattern. Thus structure formation takes place through self-assembly processes akin to those utilized in early embryonic morphogenesis. We demonstrate the technology by detailing the construction of vascular and nerve grafts. Spherical and cylindrical bio-ink units have been employed to build fully biological linear and branching vascular tubular conduits and multiluminal nerve grafts. Upon perfusion in a bioreactor the constructs achieved desirable biomechanical and biochemical properties that allowed implantation into animal models. Our results show that the printing of conveniently prepared cellular units is feasible and may represent a promising tissue and organ engineering technology. Femtosecond lasers have become important tools for noncontact microprocessing of biological specimens. Due to the short pulse length and intensity-dependent nature of the multiphoton ionization process, fs-laser pulses affect only a small volume of a treated cell, providing a high degree of spatial localization. We employed fs-laser to address topical bioengineering and biomedical problems such as cell fusion and embryo biopsy respectively. A tightly focused laser beam (Cr:F seed oscillator and a regenerative amplifier, 620nm, 100 fs, 10 Hz) was used for a fusion of blastomeres of two-cell mouse embryos and for a polar body (PB) biopsy. In order to fuse blastomeres the contact border of cells was perforated by a single laser pulse. The fusion process usually completed within *60 min. In order to perform a noncontact laser based PB biopsy we initially drilled an opening in the zona pellucida with a set of laser pulses, and then extracted the PB out of zygote by means of optical tweezer (cw laser, 1064 nm). The energy of laser pulses was thoroughly optimized to prevent cell damage and increase the fusion and biopsy rates.

Our study reveals some of the cell membrane modifications induced by Gentamicin (Gt), as they are reflected in the crossover frequency f CO of B16F10 murine cells incubated with Gt for different concentrations and durations. f CO is the AC frequency when cells turn from positive-DEP to negative-DEP. Gentamicin is a positively charged aminoglycosidic antibiotic, with concentration-dependent killing action; it is widely used because of its low cost and reliable bactericidal activity. Gt drawbacks consist in high toxicity for renal and hearing cells; the molecular mechanisms of this toxicity are still unclear. For low external medium conductivities (& 0.0012 S/m), f CO of control and Gt-cells was found to range from 3 to 10kHz. f CO shifts to higher frequencies with the increase of Gt concentration and incubation time. Cells dielectrophoretic behavior is discussed using the cell singleshell based model. Extracellular matrix (ECM) is a major obstacle for succesful delivery of genes. Chitosan is a versatile and biocompatible polysaccharide derived from chitin and is a promising gene carrier. Chitosan-DNA interactions, and hence DNA polyplexation and release can be controlled through chitosan de-acetylation degree, molecular weight and functionalization of chitosan cationic groups. Grafting of poly(ethylene glycol) PEG to gene delivery vectors increases circulation time of gene delivery systems in blood vessels and reduces polyplexes charge. Diffusion and unpacking of PEGylated and non-PEGylated chitosan-DNA polyplexes through articial ECMs based on collagen and collagen-hyaluronic acid (HA) gels were compared using fluorescence correlation microscopy, confocal microscopy and colocalization analysis. Non-PEGylated polyplexes were immobilized in the gels whereas PEGylated polyplexes were diffusing. The smaller charge of PEGylated polyplexes seems to decrease interactions between polyplexes and ECM components. Furthermore, HA might also screen collagen fibers-PEGylated polyplexes interactions. PEGylated polyplexes also showed a higher degree of unpacking in gels, probably due to a looser compaction of DNA by PEGylated chitosan compared to non-PEGylated chitosan. Fabrication of vesicles, a close membrane made of an amphiphile bilayer, has great potentiality for encapsulation and controlled release in chemical, food or biomedical industries but also from a more fundamental point of view for the design of biomimetic objects. Methods based on lipid film hydratation 1 , inverse emulsion techniques 2 and more recently microfluidic techniques such as double emulsion 3 or jetting 4 method are limited either by a low yield, a low reproducibility, a poor control on the size, or by the presence of remaining solvent or defects.

The vesicles have controlled bilayer composition with a polydispersity in size lower than 11%. we have shown that solutions as diverse as actin, cells, micrometric colloids, protein and high ionic strength solutions can easily be encapsulated using this process.

The extremely variable D3 domain of flagellin subunits, comprising residues 190-283, protrudes at the outer surface of flagellar filaments.

The in vivo stem cell microenvironment contains macromolecules which are crucial for stem cell selfrenewal and cell fate determination. In order to mimic this physiological microenvironment, crowders are included in cell culture medium. We have observed that the ex vivo differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into the adipogenic lineage is significantly amplified when a crowder mixture comprising Ficoll 70 and Ficoll 400 is added to the culture medium. Stem cell differentiation is modulated by soluble chemical substances as well as interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM), and both these external influences may be affected by MMC. Measurements we have performed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) show that Ficoll additives cause anomalous subdiffusion within a crowder concentration range of 0 to 300 mg/ml. The diffusion of fluorophorelabelled molecules in artificial lipid bilayers and membranes of living cells is not changed by crowders, suggesting that these crowders do not directly alter membrane properties and cell surface signalling. However, we have data to suggest that crowders increase actin polymerization reaction rates in vitro. We have also observed that crowders are taken up by stem cells and that they localize to specific compartments. Based upon our observations, we hypothesize that crowders can influence stem cell differentiation by influencing molecular kinetics. Lignocellulose-based composites are becoming extremely important and perspective sustainable and renewable natural materials. Fibre modification enhancing their existing properties can be obtained to broaden the application areas. In response to shortcomings of traditional chemical and physical methods, enzymes and chemo-enzymatic methods have emerged as eco-friendly catalysts working under mild conditions and enable tailoring of the material surface properties by substrate specificity and regional selectivity. Recently, binding of different functional molecules to lignin-rich fibres by using an oxidative enzyme (e.g. laccase) has been reported leading to their functionalisation through free radical reactions. By the application of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) laccase action was inspected. Consumption of substrates was investigated and their polymerization traced. Stable radical intermediates were detected with EPR when substrate molecules were in contact with active enzymes. Secondly, oxidation of mediators like nitroxides was determined via EPR spectroscopy of stable water-soluble nitroxide radicals. Finally, the generation of short-lived radicals as well as their reduction was measured via EPR spin trapping using DMPO as sensitive water soluble spin trap. Mammalian ovary hormone stimulation (OHS) is known to be an inalienable stage of reproductive biotechnology as well as human infertility treatment. The basic aim of the OHS is to receive a stock of valuable oocytes and early embryos for subsequent utilization in the reproductive technology, experimental work et al. However, it is known that OHS itself affects the character of ovulation and oocyte quality, which in its turn affects the development of embryos and even has distant consequences. The wideness of cell parameters and appropriate methods for investigation of gamete/embryo quality are very important. The aim of this study is determination of specific electric conductivity of mouse oocytes and early embryos which have been received after OHS in comparison with the ones that have been received in natural animal sex cycle. Using techniques of electroporation the dependence of specific electric conductivity of mouse oocytes, zygotes, 2-cell and 8-cell embryos on the external electric field intensity has been studied. It is shown that the whole pool of oocytes that were obtained in the result of OHS consists of two groups of oocytes that don't differ from each other morphologically, but differ by their electric parameters and resistance to electric breakdown. At the zygote stage, dividing of embryos into two groups is preserved, but is less expressed. At the stage of 2-cell and 8-cell dividing of embryos into two groups on their electric conductivity disappeared but certain scattering of the parameters due to individual embryo peculiarities is observed. The obtained data show that OHS may lead to latent changes of oocyte state that in their turn affect embryo quality. Many microbes synthesize and accumulate granules of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA, biodegradable storage materials alternative to traditional plastics), which help them survive under stresses. In particular, the plant-growth-promoting rhizobacterium Azospirillum brasilense, that is under investigation worldwide owing to its agricultural and biotechnological significance, can produce poly-3hydroxybutyrate (PHB) [1] . In our work, PHB synthesis in A. brasilense cells was studied under various stresses using diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy. PHB in cells was determined from the band intensity ratio of the polyester m(C=O) at *1740 cm -1 to that of cell proteins (amide II band at *1550 cm -1 ), showing A. brasilense to be able to produce PHB up to over 60% of cells' dry weight. Stresses induced PHB accumulation, enhancing IR absorption in PHB specific regions. Analysis of a few structure-sensitive PHB vibration bands revealed changes in the degree of intracellular PHB crystallinity (related to its enzymatic digestion rate) at different stages of bacterial growth, reflecting a novel trait of the bacterial adaptability to an enhancing stress, which is of great importance to agricultural biotechnology. The aim of this work is to furnish enzymes with polymerization ability by creating fusion constructs with the polymerizable protein, flagellin, the main component of bacterial flagellar filaments. The D3 domain of flagellin, exposed on the surface of flagellar filaments, is formed by the hypervariable central portion of the polypeptide chain. D3 is not essential for filament formation. The concept in this project is to replace the D3 domain with suitable monomeric enzymes without adversely affecting polymerization ability, and to assemble these chimeric flagellins into tubular nanostructures. To test the feasibility of this approach, xylanase A (XynA) from B. subtilis was chosen as a model enzyme for insertion. With the help of genetic engineering, a fusion construct was created in which the D3 domain was replaced by XynA. The FliC(XynA) chimera exhibited catalytic activity as well as polymerization ability. These results demonstrate that polymerization ability can be introduced into various proteins, and building blocks for rationally designed assembly of filamentous nanostructures can be created ( Table 1) .

Its C2 domain, in particular, binds to negatively charged phospholipids. We have used Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) to determine the membrane docking mode of the C2 domain of this PKC by the calculation of the b-sandwich orientation when the domain is bound to different types of model membranes, using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy with polarized light. The vesicles lipid compositions used were: POPA, POPC/POPA (50:50), POPC/POPS/POPA (65:25:10), POPC/POPE/CL (43:36:21) and POPC/POPG/POPA (65:25:10). Results show that the interaction with membranes does not strongly affect the secondary structure of the domain and that some differences were found with respect to the extent of binding as a function of phospholipid composition. Small changes are only evident when the domain is bound to model membranes of POPC/POPA and POPC/POPG/POPA. In this case, the percentage of b-sheet of C2 domain increases if compared with the secondary structure of the domain in the absence of vesicles. With respect to the b-sandwich orientation, when the domain is bound to POPC/POPG/POPA membranes it forms an angle with the surface of the lipid bilayer bigger than that one observed when the domain interacts with vesicles of POPC/POPA and POPC/POPS/POPA.

Tortora University of Milano-Bicocca, Department of Biotechnology and Biosciences, Milano, ItalyPolyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a class of neurological amyloid pathologies triggered by an aberrant aggregation of proteins bearing an expanded polyQ stretch. Proteins involved in polyQ diseases do not share any functional and structural similarity besides the polyQ tract which has been accounted as the causative agent of the pathology. Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that the aminoacidic context in which polyQ is inserted can greatly influence protein aggregation and, consequently, cytotoxicity. In this view, a deep knowledge of the structural and dynamic features of polyQ flanking sequences and their interplay within the misfolding and aggregation events are crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms leading to amyloid formation. In the present contribution, we used the multidomain polyQ protein ataxin-3 as a model for polyQ context studies, integrating computational approaches, as atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental data derived from fluorescence, FT-IR and CD spectroscopies, ESI-MS and SEC. Besides the well-known role of the N-term structured Josephine domain (JD) in the protein aggregation pathway, our studies highlighted a crucial role for the disordered tract between JD and polyQ, as well as for the C-terminal tract beyond the polyQ.O-200 Kinetics of protein aggregation Tuomas Knowles, Michele Vendruscolo, Chris Dobson Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Lensfield Road, Cambridge CB2 1EW, UK", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF33": {"text": "References: Hellstrand et al ACS Chem Neurosci. 1, 13-18 (2010); Hellstrand et al, Biophys J. 98:2206-2214 (2010); Cabaleiro-Lago et al, ACS Chem Neurosc., 1, 279-287 (2010)", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF34": {"text": "of DNA repair mechanisms in lymphocytes of melanoma patients as prognostic factor of chemotherapy D.N.

The use of Scanning Force Microscopy (SFM) to image and determine surface characteristics of Chlamydia trachomatis bacteria and two species each of Rhodococcus bacteria and Leishmania parasites will be discussed. Further to this, research into the adhesive properties of Leishmania promastigotes is proposed. This requires fabrication of different glycopolymer modified surfaces/tips to replicate some of the conditions experienced by the parasite whilst in the insect host. The prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms considered have different impacts on the environment; C. trachomatis and Leishmania undergo complex multi-stage lifecycles and cause widespread human disease. This gives the research importance in a medical context, providing information that could be useful for future drug or vaccine research. The diverse species of genus Rhodococcus have potential for use as biofilms for environmental bioremediation. The research should result in a combination of adhesion data and topographic images of the organisms, allowing accurate investigation of surface properties both in ambient conditions and when imaged in aqueous conditions such as under a saline buffer. Functionalization of SFM tips with hydrophilic or hydrophobic groups allows the study of interactions between the functional molecules and the surface of the organism, thus mapping the hydrophobicity of the organism's surface.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF62": {"text": "Roberti M.J., Giordano L., Jovin T.M., and Jares-Erijman E.A.''

We developed a fluorescent MLV virus by fusing GFP to the integrase (IN) of MLV. This system provides the possibility to efficiently detect MLV Pre Integration Complexes (PIC) inside the nuclei of infected cells. A detailed analysis of the spatial distribution of these fluorescently labelled PICs inside the nucleus has been performed: infected cells have been transfected with a fluorescent H2B histone or stained with epigenetic markers of heterochromatin (H3K9me3) or euchromatin (H4K16ac). Moreover, a comparative analysis was performed relatively to fluorescently labelled HIV-1 PICs (visualized by the trans-incorporation of IN-EGFP into the viral particle). The proposed system allows a detailed characterization of the intranuclear distribution of MLV fluorescent viral particles in infected cells and represents a powerful tool to investigate potential interactions between MLV PICs and cellular factors.

O-444 Protein dynamics explored by M\u00f6 ssbauer effect and neutron scattering Hans Frauenfelder Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA Protein functions are determined by structure and dynamics. The naked protein provides the structures that permit the motions necessary for the functions. The bulk solvent and the hydration shell are crucial for the control of the motions through producing two types of fluctuations, called a and b h . The a fluctuations originate in the bulk solvent, affect the shape of the protein, and open channels. The b h fluctuations originate in the protein's hydration shell, depend critically on hydration, but are independent of the solvent viscosity. They control internal motions 1 . To prove the connection between external fluctuations and protein motions tools are needed that measure fluctuations and motions externally and internally over broad ranges of time and temperature. The M\u00f6 ssbauer effect and quasielastic neutron scattering are such tools.In proteins both techniques show a rapid increase of the mean-squaredisplacement (msd) above about 180 K. The increase is accompanied by the appearance of a broad band. The standard explanation of the increase, dubbed ''dynamical transition'', is controversial and no satisfactory explanation for the broad band has been put forward. A new interpretation of the M\u00f6 ssbauer effect in proteins proves that there is no dynamical transition and that the separation into a sharp line and a broad band is misleading. The broad band is inhomogeneous and is composed of sharp lines that have been shifted by b h fluctuations in the protein's hydration shell and a fluctuations in the bulk solvent. In crystals the a fluctuations are absent. Using the dielectric spectrum of the b h fluctuations, we predict the shape of the M\u00f6 ssbauer spectrum from 80 K to 295 K with one dimensionless coefficient.

The optical tweezers tracking was applied to extract the trajectories of endogenous lipid granules which were analyzed using a recently proposed equation for mean square displacement (MSD) 1 . Methods: The set-up is based on a Nd:YAG laser, with the wavelength of 1064 nm. The endogenous granules of diameter about 0.4 lm have been chosen as the microrheological tracers, and the tracer trajectory is recorded through the back focal plane interferometric position detection. Results: Our 1MHz detection scheme has allowed to observe the subdiffusion inside the living cells for the lag times region 10 -5 -10 -3 s. At long time the MSD becomes influenced by the optical potential and tends to a constant.

For a better understanding of the actin cytoskeleton function as a stabilizing but also flexible 3D-network in living cells it is adjuvant to have a suitable model system. For modeling the complex cytoskeleton in a bottom up approach, we use giant unilamellar vesicles created of artificial lipid bilayers to simulate the cell membrane and encapsulate monomer actin inside the vesicle aqueous core.

They have several domains including FH1, FH2, GPB and DAD. In the interaction between actin and formin the FH2 domain plays a key role. The 'mammalian Diaphanous-related 1' constitutes one of the subfamilies of the formins. These mDia1 formin fragments affect the conformation of the actin filaments in a concentration dependent manner. In the current work we have investigated whether the mDia1-FH2 affects the nucleotide exchange on the actin filaments. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy and photometric coupled assay measurements showed that the ATP-ADP conversion was accelerated in the presence of formins, and the effect was stronger at greater formin concentrations. These observations indicate that there must be a tight coupling between the rate of nucleotide exchange on actin protomers and the conformational properties of the filaments.O-481Tropomyosin isoform specific regulation of nucleation factors Andrea Vig, Tam\u00e1 s Huber and Be\u00e1 ta Bugyi University of P\u00e9 cs, Medical School, Department of Biophysics, P\u00e9 cs, Hungary", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF77": {"text": "of charge fluctuations on the ionic escape rate from a single-site ion channel I.

Biology, Biotech. Faculty, Uni. Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia Perfringolysin O (PFO) and Listeriolysin O (LLO) are two Cholesterol-Dependent Cytolysins (CDCs) produced by Gram-positive bacteria. Their main task is to facilitate the infection disrupting plasma or endosomal membranes.Even if CDCs have been well studied, their pore-forming mechanism is not clear yet. Two models are proposed: pre-pore to pore transition and arc-shaped pore formation. Based on this, we investigated the electrophysiological properties and structures of the two toxins pores in different membrane compositions (i.e. phospholipid acyl chains and cholesterol concentration) using Planar Lipid Membrane (PLM) technique and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Our analysis identified two distinct pore-forming abilities. On POPC-CHO 50% membrane, both proteins form well defined pores with conductance values mainly around 10-15 nS, visible by AFM as complete ring inserted into the membrane of about 30 nm diameter. On the other hand on DOPC-CHO 20% membrane, PFO and LLO form pores with heterogeneous conductance (from pS to nS) but in most of the cases, pores are difficult to be sorted out both by PLM and AFM analyses. Collectively, our results support the idea that prevalence of pre-pore or arc-shaped oligomeric intermediates are promoted by different membrane lipid compositions.of Kv7.1 with KCNE1 produces the I KS K ? current that is crucial for the repolarization of the cardiac action potential. Mutations in these subunit genes produce the long QT syndrome, a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. Despite numerous studies performed on Shaker-like Kv channels, very little is known about the mechanisms underlying Kv7.1 channel activation. Do the voltage-induced conformational changes in the Kv7.1 tetrameric complex gives rise to cooperativity in channel function? If so, do they involve concerted or sequential conformational transitions in subunit interactions along Kv7.1 channel activation? To determine the nature of subunit interaction, we introduced one voltage sensor domain (VSD) mutation, R231W, into one, two, three, or four subunits by using a concatenated tetrameric channel construct. When present in all 4 VSDs, the S4 R231W mutation produces instantaneous and voltage-independent K ? currents by ''locking'' the channel in the open state. When present in only one VSD, the R231W mutation does not produce an instantaneous current but causes a left shift in the channel activation curve. The other combinations of mutated VSDs suggest a sequential conformational transition in Kv7.1 channel gating.

Giant vesicles, prepared from a sphingomyelin/dioleoylphosphocholine/ cholesterol mixture, are examined using fluorescence microscopy. NBD-labeled lipid and BODIPY-labeled cholesterol are used to identify the phase domains of the membrane. A vesicle with only two domains is chosen because of its simple geometry, for convenient comparison of the experimental results with the theoretical predictions. The volume of the vesicles is gradually decreased and/or increased by changing the osmolarity. The relevant energy terms of the membrane mechanics are the bending energy and the Gaussian bending energy, and the energy of the domain boundary. The energy of the domain boundary is proportional to its length. At the boundary between the domains a contact angle is taken into consideration. In order to obtain the values of the lateral tension and the contact angle, the areas of the domains and the characteristic dimensions of the shape are determined for different volumes. The best fits were obtained for a line tension of 6 \u00b1 3 pN and a contact angle of 1.4 \u00b1 0.3 rad.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF101": {"text": "between chorogenic acid and erythrocyte membrane Dorota Bonarska-Kujawa, Hanna Pruchnik, Halina Kleszczy\u0144 ska Department of Physics and Biophysics, Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Science, C.K.

Scientific studies have documented a protective action of CGA on the human organism due to its antioxidant, anticancer, fungicidal and bactericidal properties. However, the effect of the acid on the molecular and cell levels have not yet been studied. The aim of the research presented was to determine the effect of CGA on the erythrocyte membrane and liposomes formed of membrane lipids.

Laboratory of Molecular and Cell Biomedicine, University of the Balearic Islands -Lipopharma Therapeutics, S.L., Palma de Mallorca, Spain Keywords: Membrane fluidity, Minerval, 2-hydroxylated fatty acids.Cellular functions are usually associated with the activity of proteins and nucleic acids. Recent studies have shown that lipids may alter the biophysical properties of lipid membranes and modulate the localization and activity of membrane proteins, thus regulation the cellular processes in which they are involved. The present work describes the effect of Minerval (2-hydroxyoleic acid), a potent antitumoral drug, and other different 2-hydroxylated fatty acid derivatives on the fluidity of lipid membranes. The selfquenching method of NBD-phosphatidylethanolamine showed that all the studied 2-hydroxylated fatty acids induced fluidification of domain-containing model membranes. However, phase separation was observed upon addition of these synthetic molecules on vesicles composed of homogeneously distributed lipids. Results of fluorescence confocal microscopy of giant unilamellar vesicles correlates with the disordering effects of the 2-hydroxylated fatty acids on the membrane structure. The ability of changing the membrane biophysical properties makes the 2-hydroxylated fatty acid derivatives candidates to be modulators of the membrane associated proteins activities and the subsequent intracellular cell signaling processes.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF103": {"text": "Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany, 2 National Taras Shevchenko University, Kyiv, Ukraine Gramicidin S (GS) is a cyclic decapeptide (cyclo[Val-Orn-Leu-D Phe-Pro])", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF104": {"text": "membrane fusion inhibited by beta-propiolactone treatment Pierre Bonnafous 1 , Marie Claire Nicola\u00ef 2 , Michel Chevalier 2 , Jean-Christophe Taveau 1 , Julie Morel 2 , Olivier Adam 2 , Fr\u00e9 d\u00e9 ric Ronzon 2 , Olivier Lambert 1 1 CBMN UMR-CNRS 5248, Universit\u00e9 Bordeaux, Bordeaux France, 2 Sanofi Pasteur Research, Lyon, France", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF105": {"text": "scattering detects large vesicle deformations along the anomalous gel-fluid transition of DMPG Thais A.

Along a wide gel-fluid transition region, DMPG dispersions display several anomalous characteristics, like low turbidity, high electrical conductivity and viscosity. Here, static and dynamic light scattering (SLS and DLS) were used to characterize DMPG vesicles. SLS and DLS yielded similar dimensions for vesicles in the gel and fluid phases. However, over the DMPG transition region, SLS indicated a threefold increase in vesicle radius of gyration, whereas the hydrodynamic radius, as obtained from DLS, increased by only 30%. Over the DMPG transition region, large positive values of the second virial coefficient clearly indicated an increase in inter-vesicle repulsion, probably due to the suggested increase in vesicle ionization. Despite the anomalous increase in the radius of gyration, DMPG lipid vesicles maintain isotropy, since no light depolarization was detected. Adding to results present in the literature, we propose an interpretation in terms of large fluctuations of vesicle form and bilayer density along the DMPG transition region, associated to head-group dissociation and formation of bilayer pores.

Characteristic time of the fluorescence signal increase during the incorporation of Hyp and Emd into the BLM was found to be approx. 50 and 10s, respectively. This time period has two components. First, there is a diffusion time of the studied drug molecules across the boundary layer near the BLM surface. Second, there is the time need for the incorporation of the adsorbed molecules into the BLM.

Recently, in a two domain protein such as T4 lysozyme the interdomain cooperativity has been precisely quantified at single molecule level. Such cooperativity has been shown to be dramatically attenuated in a circular permutant which folds to the same native structure. In this paper we exploit this single molecule measurement of cooperativity and a simple molecular model to infer the relationship between the interdomain cooperativity, chain connectivity and free energy landscapes. In particular we show that both species have an onpathway intermediate where one of the domains is completely formed. The change in cooperativity can be ascribed to a change in the rate limiting step for folding. This occurs before the intermediate in the wild type and after in the circular permutant.

Identifying ligand entry/exit routes provides fundamental understanding of protein function and adds substantial information to rational drug design process. In this area of active research, we focus on PPARs family of nuclear receptors that emerged as therapeutic targets.Agonists have established therapeutics benefits in treating diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. In this work, we explore possible ligand entry pathways of GW0072, a PPARc modulator that appears to function as an insulin sensitizer, by using Targeted Molecular Dynamics (TMD) simulations. Starting from the apo-form of PPARc with GW0072 distal from probable exit gates, TMD simulations converge successfully towards the targeted holo-form of the complex. The simulation results showed that i) entrance paths depend on the protonation state of the ligand; ii) ligand approach suggests that hydrophobic interactions guide the penetration process iii) the routes for ligand access to the binding site closely superimpose the most probable ligand exit pathway described in our previous studies (Genest & al.

The higher activity of the immune system perturbs developing brain and may result in this disorder. It has been found that Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein (MCP-1) levels in brains of autistic children are elevated. Interactions of chemokine MCP-1 with antibodies are important for diagnosis and possible treatment . We present results of classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) studies of MCP-1 complex with a murine Fab antibody fragment[1]. Regions important for molecular recognition (MR) are described and their dynamics is critically analyzed. The process of MCP-1 binding/dissociation is modeled on allatoms level using the steered MD method by adding a virtual force to increase probability of rare transition in antibodyantigen complexes. The detailed path of MCP-1-antibody MR is analyzed. The interaction mechanism is compared to IgE-grass Phl p2 allergen recognition process studied earlier.

Single molecule experiments not only probe average distances, but also distance distributions or even fluctuations, and thus provide a powerful tool to study biomolecular structure and dynamics. However, the measured energy transfer efficiency depends not only on the distance between the dyes, but also on their mutual orientation, which is typically inaccessible to experiments. Thus, assumptions on the orientation distributions and averages are usually made, limiting the accuracy of the distance distributions extracted from FRET experiments. Here, we demonstrate that by combining FRET experiments with the mutual dye orientation statistics obtained from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, improved estimates of distances and distributions are obtained. From the simulated time-dependent mutual orientations, FRET efficiencies are calculated and the full statistics of individual photon absorption, FRET transfer, and photon emission events is obtained from subsequent Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the FRET transfer kinetics. All recorded emission events are collected to bursts from which efficiency distributions are calculated in close resemblance to the actual FRET experiment, taking shot noise fully into account. Using polyproline chains with attached Alexa 488 and Alexa 594 dyes as a test system, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by direct comparison to experimental data. We identified cis-isomers and different static local environments as sources of the experimentally observed heterogeneity. Reconstructions of distance distributions from experimental data at different levels of theory demonstrate how the respective underlying assumptions and approximations affect the obtained accuracy. Our results show that dye fluctuations obtained from MD simulations, combined with MCsingle photon kinetics, provide a versatile tool to improve the accuracy of distance distributions that can be extracted from measured single molecule FRET efficiencies.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF91": {"text": "Briggs and K.

Several E2s are characterized by an extended loop (L7), which regulates Ub-charging activity [Papaleo et al, PLoS Comput Biol, in press].We studied L7 interactions, in representative E2s, integrating phylogenetic and residue co-evolution analyses, normal mode and multi-replica molecular dynamics simulations. A pattern of hydrophobic residues emerged as the main determinant of the stabilization of E2 inactive conformations. L7 can have a pivotal role in downstream events related to interactions with Ub and E3 enzymes. In fact, once the E2-Ub complex is formed, L7 open conformation, induced by phosphorylation, allows its acidic residues to reduce conformational freedom of Ub in the E2 catalytic cleft. Indeed, hydrophobic residues interact with E2 distal regions rich of hydrophobic residues determining a L7 conformation competent for interactions with E3s. In light of the above scenario, L7 emerges as a suitable target for drug design, prompting us to develop virtual screening and docking simulations to identify compounds, which should be able to act as molecular hinges and to modify protein dynamics.

ChinaMg 2+ is ubiquitous and often coordinated by the triphosphate of GTP or ATP in signal transduction and motor proteins. It plays an important role in catalytic hydrolysis. Here, we analysed the GTPase Ras which is a crucial switch in cellular signal transduction. It cleaves the substrate GTP hydrolytically to diphosphate and P i . The GAP protein accelerates GTP hydrolysis by a factor of 10 5 . FTIR spectra of GTP show remarkable changes when it binds to the enzyme in comparison to water[1]. The main goal is to understand how this acceleration is accomplished. Spectral features are computed by QM/MM. The simulations provide charge shifts and small deformations of bond lengths and angles that are not accessible by experiments directly. With GROMACS we calculated 50ns MM trajectories of GTP and GTP bound Mg 2+ in water, Ras\u00c1GTP, Ras\u00c1GTP\u00c1RasGAP, Ras\u00c1GDP\u00c1P i \u00c1RasGAP and Ras\u00c1GDP. For each system we took six snapshots from the last 25ns as starting structures for 5ps QM/MM simulations, calculated the FTIR spectra and compared them with experiments for validation. The results give new insights into the role of the Mg 2+ during hydrolysis: It drags the electrons from the triphosphate, stores them and after the P i release returns them to the diphosphate.[1] K\u00f6 tting et al., PNAS (2006) 13911-13916.

P-301 Force distribution analysis of allosteric mechanisms Christian Seifert, Frauke Graeter Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies, Heidelberg, Germany Revealing the pathways of signal transfer in allosteric proteins has remained a challenge for today's biophysical methods. Previous approaches are primarily based on the comparison of active and inactive structures and thermodynamic concepts. However, stiff regions of the protein might mask signal propagation, even though they are able to carry signals in form of high internal stresses. We here present a new method, force distribution analysis (FDA Stacklies et al 2011, accepted), that detects the distribution of stress upon external perturbations in macromolecules like proteins, other (bio-)polymers or even solids with high sensitivity. For tracing signal transfer through a protein structure, FDA calculates the changes, here caused by ligand binding, in the inter-atomic forces of the protein as sampled in Molecular Dynamics simulations. The analyzed proteins are two homologues of the chaperone Hsp90 and the catabolite activator protein CAP. We propose a new model for the signal transduction in the E.Coli (HtpG) and Yeast (Hsp82) homologues of Hsp90. The force differences between the apo, ADP and ATP bound states obtained by FDA based on all-atom trajectories totaling 540 ns revealed a cross-talk between the binding site and the middle domain via distinct paths. The catabolite activator protein (CAP) is a major player in the lac operon. CAP features a negative cooperativity for the binding of cAMP, which is interestingly based not on a change in structure but in flexibility (Popovych et al. 2006). FDA of the apo, single-and double-bound state revealed a signaling network in CAP, which transfers a signal (first cAMP is bound) to the second binding niche without obvious structural changes, thereby explaining the observed cooperativity. This work describes the effectiveness of FDA for resolving allosteric communication pathways, which are directly testable by experiments. As such, it has broad implications for our view on protein internal strain and function.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF113": {"text": "1] Luthey-Schulten, Z.; Wolynes, P. Annu. Rev. Phys.

Here, Molecular Dynamics simulations are applied to explain the influence of membrane cholesterol levels on voltage-gated calcium channels. We used different lipid compositions to obtain information about the possible effects by which cholesterol influences Cav1.2 channels. Cholesterol is not directly interacting with the protein in the open or the closed conformation, but the Ca 2+ ion mobility is decreased in POPC/CHOL systems compared to pure POPC bilayers. Cholesterol increases lipid packing implying that it plays a crucial rule in restricting lipid movement in the region around 1 nm of POPC.

We present evidence suggesting that new protein structures can arise by a swap of segments between domains within a single-chain monomer. By a comprehensive structural search of the current PDB, we identified 32 well-defined segment-swapped proteins (SSPs) belonging to 18 structural families. Nearly 13% of all multidomain proteins in the PDB may have a segment-swapped evolutionary precursor as estimated by more permissive searching criteria. The formation of SSPs can be explained by two principal evolutionary mechanisms: (i) domain swapping and fusion (DSF), (ii) circular permutation (CP). By large-scale comparative analyses using structural alignment and HMM methods, it was found that the majority of SSPs have arisen by the DSF mechanism, and a much smaller fraction by CP. Functional analyses revealed that segment swapping, which results in two linkers connecting the domains, may impart directed flexibility to multidomain proteins. Inter-domain segment swapping represents a novel general mechanism by which new protein folds and multidomain architectures arise in evolution, and segmentswapped proteins have structural and functional properties that make them worth defining as a separate group.O-310 Molecular dynamics simulations of ribosomal translocation based on cryo-EM data Andrea C. Vaiana, Lars V. Bock, Christian Blau, Niels Fischer, Holger Stark, Wolfgang Wintermeyer, Marina V. Rodnina, Helmut Grubm\u00fc ller Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistttingen, GermanyHigh-resolution structural studies of the ribosome have revealed many details of how the ribosomal machinery achieves efficient protein synthesis at the atomic level. These studies provide atomic resolution structures of the ribosome in well-defined states along the protein assembly cycle. Unfortunately, these structures shed little light on intermediate states, transition pathways, and equilibrium states at physiological temperatures. Molecular dynamics simulations allow addressing these dynamical features of the ribosome while maintaining a faithful all-atom, explicit solvent representation of the system. We combine crystallographic and cryo-EM data with molecular dynamics simulations to target the elongation phase of protein synthesis. Using fitted models as starting points we performed molecular dynamics simulations to obtain a picture of the ribosome in different states of transfer RNA translocation. Analyzing the main modes of motion along the simulation trajectories provided insight into the concerted motion of different parts of the ribosome during elongation. The generalized Born model was introduced for the efficient evaluation of continuum electrostatic energies. FACTS (fast analytical continuum treatment of solvation) is an efficient implicit solvent model based on the generalized Born model for calculating the free energy of solvation of a molecule embedded in an aqueous continuum solvent. We discuss a modification to the standard FACTS implicit solvent model for modelling heterogeneous dielectric environments with applications to biological membranes. The membrane-water system in the modified model is represented in the form of multiple layered dielectric regions with dielectric constants different from the solute cavity. The modified FACTS model for membranes is implemented in the CHARMM molecular dynamics simulations package and results are shown for a range of different proteins.P-312Simulating bacterial efflux: how molecular features affect functional rotation A.V.

As it provides a reversible transition following a distinct unfolding pathway, RNase A serves as a model system to investigate large scale thermal fluctuations inside the protein. This is one way to explore the energy landscape at a given equilibrium state and will show us possible rearrangements of biological relevant conformations as well as local stable conformations. By changing environmental parameters such as temperature, pH and solvent conditions, the level of energy can be varied. We are investigating bovine pancreatic RNase A under different denaturation conditions using mainly small angle neutron scattering and neutron spin echo spectroscopy. Combining such techniques provides a unique tool to study the structural arrangement of proteins in solution and their dynamical properties. Large scale fluctuations of protein domains can be accessed as these techniques are sensitive to the structure and to collective dynamics. Using additional techniques, such as circular dichroism spectroscopy gives further insight into the secondary structure and how it responds to changes in temperature.Traditionally, specific DNA recognition is based on static contacts with the bases or phosphates. Residues far outside the binding context, however, can critically influence selectivity or binding affinity via transient, dynamic interactions with the DNA binding interface. The corresponding regions are usually intrinsically disordered (ID), which preserve their conformational freedom even when bound to DNA. There are four possible scenarios how distant ID segments impact DNA binding. They modulate i) conformational preferences, ii) flexibility or iii) spacing of the DNA binding motif(s) or iv) serve as competitive partners. Despite their low sequence similarity, the ID regions are often conserved at the structural level in families of orthologous proteins. Fuzzy protein-DNA complexes offer a variety of regulatory pathways via proteinprotein interactions, post-translational modifications or alternative splicing in response to cellular cues.P-652Understanding the plasticity of c-Src tyrosine kinase through very long molecular dynamics simulations and experimentally validated free energy calculations.R.

Light absorption initiates a photocycle with chromophore isomerization, transient protonation and conformational changes of various magnitude. The formation and decay of the consecutive photocycle intermediates of Halorhodospira halophila PYP after an actinic laser pulse were followed with time-resolved near UV -visible multichannel absorption spectroscopy in the 100 nanosecond -seconds range in buffers containing either NaF, NaCl or NaClO 4 in 0.66 M concentration at pH 8.2. Hofmeister salts -originally classified based on their salting-out or salting-in effects -influence the conformational stability of proteins. We have analyzed the spectrotemporal matrices obtained in different salts with the method Singular Value Decomposition with Exponential Fit Assisted Self-Modeling (SVD-EFASM 1 ) and investigated the correlation of the Hofmeister salt-dependence of various rate constants of the PYP photocycle with the structural model of the protein's function.[1] Zim\u00e1 nyi, L. 2004.

Our analytical calculations, supplemented with numerical simulations demonstrate that depending on the coupling strength (which is related to the flexibility of the protein) the short-wavelength components of the energy landscape roughness can be observed as an increased apparent internal friction with an apparent activation energy.Centre de Biochimie Structurale, INSERM UMR 1054, CNRS UMR 5048, Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier, Montpellier, France, 2 T.

Meanwhile, a more dynamic and flexible picture of these macromolecules has evolved to explain protein function like catalyzing biochemical reactions, transport, regulation, storage or defensive tasks. The importance of thermodynamically driven, internal motions for the functioning of proteins is subject of ongoing research. We will present recent investigations of protein dynamics on Lactoferrin, a protein with antimicrobial activity which is part of the innate immune system. It consists of two binding sites, each is capable of binding and releasing one iron ion. The crystallographic structures show that the binding sites have open and closed conformations, assumedly depending on the presence of iron (Andersen et al.,Nature, 1990). We are analyzing the internal dynamics of different binding states to elucidate of the binding mechanism with neutron scattering. Our unique method includes large scale structural characterization with small angle neutron scattering and the observation of internal motions of subdomains with neutron spin echo spectroscopy on nanosecond scale.

In the present work an impact of nonspecific moderate denaturant, dimethylsulphoxide, DMSO, on the kinetic (functional) and thermodynamic (thermal stability) patterns of a hydrolytic enzyme, a-chymotrypsin (a-CT) has been investigated. For the a-CT-catalysed process of ATEE hydrolysis, within the DMSO concentration range of 0-25% V/V we observed increase of the Michaelis constant (K M ) whereas the catalytic constant (k cat ) remained unchanged. These observations indicate on a preservation of the protein's active conformation accompanied by increase of the conformational flexibility of its active centre. In the presence of similar DMSO concentrations microcalorimetric data reflecting the a-CT thermal denaturation clearly point to the stability increase of the protein's compact part. Subsequent increase of the DMSO concentration leads to the protein's global destabilization, however the enzymatic hydrolysis process still obeys the Michaelis-Menten pattern, indicating about the involvement of the molten-globule-like state of a-CT.O-665 How scarce sequence elements control the function of single \u00df-thymosin/WH2 domains in actin assembly Dominique Didry 2 , Francois-Xavier Cantrelle 1 , Clotilde Husson 2 , Pierre Roblin 2,3 , Anna M.

Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) pathways are involved in several cellular responses such as stress reaction or proliferation controlFADDIN EN.CITE . The High-Osmolarity Glycerol (HOG) pathway in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is in charge of the osmo-regulation and its activation leads to the nuclear translocation of the protein Hog1p. The dynamics of this cascade to mild osmotic shock has been recently investigated by several groups both experimentally and theoretically. Here, we combine a microfludic device with fluorescent microscopy to study the HOG signal transduction dynamics in response to increasing osmotic shock. We show that the nuclear translocation dynamics of Hog1p is slowed down when increasing the osmotic shock intensity. Surprisingly, the cascade is still operational, since Hog1p phosphorylation is not altered. Moreover, we show that this slow down is universal since other signaling pathways are also severely slowed down when activated in a hyper osmotic environment. Our results suggest that the nucleocytoplasmic transport is altered by hyper osmotic shocks.O-676 Polar actin cortex mechanics and cell shape stability during cytokinesis Jakub Sedzinski 1,2 , Mat\u00e9 Biro 1,2 , Annelie Oswald 1 , Jean-Yves Tinevez 1,2,3 , Guillaume Salbreux 4 and Ewa Paluch 1,2 1 Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany, 2 International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Warsaw, Poland, 3 Present address: Pasteur Institute, Imagopole, Paris, France, 4 Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems, Dresden, Germany", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF235": {"text": "Transition to collective motion in bacterial colonies Fernando Peruani 1 , Joern Starruss 2 , Vladimir Jakovljevic 3 , Lotte Soogard-Andersen 3 , Andreas Deutsch 3 , Markus Baer 4 1 Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems, Dresden, Germany, 2 TU-Dresden, Dresden, Germany, 3 Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology, Marburg, Germany, 4 Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Berlin, Germany", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF236": {"text": "Until now the kinetics and energetics of the transition from the basic conformation of ds-DNA (B state) to the 1.7 times longer and partially unwound conformation (S state) have not been defined.

This approach reveals the transition kinetics of ds-DNA elongation and their load-dependence. We show that (1) the elongation (DL) following the force step imposed on the molecule in the region of overstretching transition has an exponential time course with a rate constant (r) that has a U-shaped dependency on the force attained by the step (F); (2) the r-F relation is unaffected by the reduction of the force step size from 2 to 0.5 pN; r is related to the extent of elongation DL 0 through a power equation that, once linearized by double log transformation shows a slope of *0.6.

From the very beginning, confocal microscopy was the workhorse due to its versatility and straight forward multiparameter detection capability. Photon coincidence measurements (antibunching) started as the ultimate proof for the existence of a single emitter but nowadays also decipher the true number of immobilised emitters in the sub-micron observation volume. We use this technique to characterise a new and promising class a luminescent labels, NV defect centers in single nanodiamonds, where knowledge about the number of independent emitters in a single nanodiamond is the prerequisite to understand the complex fluorescence decay behaviour. The combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM) with singlemolecule-sensitive confocal fluorescence microscopy enables a fascinating insight into the structure, dynamics and interactions of single biomolecules and their assemblies. Sub ensemble single fluorophore counting becomes possible as well as the observation of sub-diffraction imaging features. Adding an AFM tip to the confocal observation volume allows to complement the optically acquired information with topographic imaging. In addition, nanophotonic effects, such as fluorescence quenching or enhancement due to the AFM tip, are used to increase the optical resolution beyond the diffraction limit, thus allowing to identify different fluorescence labels within e.g. a macromolecular complex. Silicon tip induced single molecule quenching could be demonstrated on individual organic fluorophores[1].References: [1] O. Schulz, F. Koberling, D. Walters, M. Koenig, J. Viani, R.

Stretching and confining in nanoscale channels and capillaries is used e.g. for sorting fragments of dsDNA of different length. We have employed Monte Carlo simulations based on a discrete worm-like chain model to compute the chain extension R of DNA as a function of channel dimension D (J. Phys. Chem. B, 2009,113,1843). The chain extension profiles R(D) computed for a rectangular channel, tube and slit displayed three sections, in qualitative agreement with nanofluidic measurements of DNA at high salt concentrations. DNA behavior in channels of intermediate widths was explained by the statistics of ideal chain blobs and the scaling relation with the exponent of about x=-1. The transition to regime in narrow channels occurs when the diameter D is about equal to the DNA persistence length. Simulations revealed a considerable amount of folded structures of DNA molecules. Since hairpins are much shorter than the straight forms, they tend to significantly reduce the equilibrium chain extension R. The back-folding of DNA chains is manifested especially at intermediate channel widths. The individual folding-unfolding events can be identified in MC traces. Joost van Mameren, Helge Eggert, Gerd Behme, Torsten Jaehnke, Thomas Neicke JPK Instruments AG (JPK), Bouch\u00e9 strasse 12, 12435 Berlin, Germany In the past decade, experiments involving the manipulation and observation of nanostructures with light using optical tweezers methodology have developed from proof-of-principle experiments to an established quantitative technique in fields ranging from (bio)physics to cell biology. With optical tweezers, microscopically small objects can be held and manipulated. At the same time, the forces exerted on the trapped objects can be accurately measured. JPK has developed a quantitative optical tweezers platform, the NanoTracker. This platform allows the controlled trapping and accurate tracking of nanoparticles, suspended either in a microfluidic multichannel flow chamber or even in a temperature-controlled open Petri dish. With its 3D detection system, particle displacements in the trap can be recorded with nanometer precision. Moreover, dynamic forces acting on the particle (e.g. exerted by motor proteins) can be measured with more than piconewton resolution on a sub-millisecond time-scale. Several successful biophysical applications will be demonstrated. In particular, we show how one of the hallmarks of singlemolecule biophysics, the overstretching transition of DNA, can be studied in a versatile manner and used for protein-DNA interaction mechanics.

This reaction is catalysed by the AddAB helicase-nuclease that unwinds the DNA duplex and degrades the nascent single-strands in a Chi-regulated manner (Yeeles and Dillingham, 2007). We have recently shown that recombinational hotspots regulate AddAB function by preventing reannealing of nascent single strands via formation of a DNA loop (Yeeles et al., 2011). Here, we have used Magnetic Tweezers to measure the real-time dynamics of AddAB at the single molecule level. We have measured AddAB translocation rate for Chi-containing and Chi-free DNA molecules which showed a complex appearance with the presence of constantvelocity segments of 300 bp/s at RT punctuated by stochastic pauses. Pauses duration followed a single exponential distribution with a decay time of 0.6 s. Interestingly, specific nicking in the AddAB translocating strand in both Chi-containing and Chi-free substrates favored pausing of AddAB at this nicked position, but did not prevent further AddAB translocation. Moreover, we observed that the presence of Chi sequences increases the frequency of AddAB pausing and reduces the AddAB translocation rate. The molecular basis for these observations is currently under evaluation. Yeeles, J. T., and Dillingham, M. S. (2007).

In bacteria, recombinational DNA break repair is initiated by a class of enzymes called helicase-nucleases. The prototypical member of this class in the model organism Bacillus subtilis is the protein complex AddAB. It processes a double-stranded end to a 3'-terminated single-stranded DNA overhang, thus creating a substrate for the subsequent repair steps[1, 2]. To study the role of force in the complex process of DNA repair initiation, we have set up and characterized a custombuilt single-beam Optical Tweezers adapted from a published design[3]. Positions of trapped microspheres are measured by high-speed video microscopy as well as detection of backscattered laser light. Our novel instrumentation will enable us to investigate the real-time dynamics of repair processes catalyzed by the molecular motor AddAB. So far, proof-of-principle DNA force-extension measurements have been carried out. At present, we are endeavouring to determine the stalling force of AddAB, which should be larger than 4 pN, based upon observations from a complementary Magnetic Tweezers study (unpublished data).[1] Chedin, F., Ehrlich, S.D. and Kowalczykowski, S.C.

While proteins need to keep their specific native fold structure thermally stable, the native fold displays the ability to perform large amplitude motions that allow proper function. This conflict cannot be bridged by compact objects which are characterized by small amplitude vibrations and by a Debye density of low frequency modes. Recently, however, it became clear that proteins can be described as fractals;namely, geometrical objects that possess self similarity. Adopting the fractal point of view to proteins makes it possible to describe within the same framework essential information regarding topology and dynamics using three parameters: the number of amino acids along the protein backbone N, the spectral dimension d s and the fractal dimension d f . The fractal character implies large amplitude vibrations of the protein that could have led to unfolding. We showed that by selecting a thermodynamic state that is ''close'' to the edge of stability against unfolding, nature has solved the thermostability conflict. Starting off from a thermal marginal stability criterion we reached a universal equation describing the relation between the spectral and fractal dimensions of a protein and the number of amino acids. Using structural data from the protein data bank (PDB) and the Gaussian network model (GNM), we computed d f and d s . for about 5,000 proteins (!) and demonstrated that the equation of state is well obeyed.

We examined the regulation of these structural changes by histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) in key regions of histone-DNA interface. Precise histone PTMs were introduced into nucleosomes by preparing semi and fully synthetic histones by expressed protein ligation and native chemical ligation. Single molecule mechanical measurements of nucleosome arrays determined that only PTMs within the nucleosome dyad region increase the nucleosome disassembly rate. In contrast, F\u00f6 rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis and enzyme kinetic experiments with mononucleosomes show 2-to-3 fold increase in DNA unwrapping only for PTMs located within the entry/exit region. Our studies suggest that the nucleosome regions that control DNA unwrapping and nucleosome disassembly are decoupled, where DNA histone contacts near the dyad regulate disassembly and the DNA entry-exit region regulates DNA unwrapping.P-716Establishing the composition of alpha-synuclein oligomers using single-molecule photobleaching Niels Zijlstra, Christian Blum, Ine Segers-Nolten, Mireille Claessens, Vinod Subramaniam Nanobiophysics, MESA?

The increase of the local dielectric constant induced a significant decrease of the oxidation potential of the primary electron donor and a slow proton release, which appears to be the rate limiting step in the overall process. Systematic selection of the head group charges of detergents and lipids, as well as the thickness of the fatty acid chains of the liposome forming lipids can increase the lifetime of the charge-separated state by up to 5 orders of magnitude.

The motivation for the selection of b-casein is the uncertainty of structural order/disorder. Naturally, the NMR and thermal characteristics were also evaluated. The melting of hydration water could be detected well below 0\u00b0C and the quantity of mobile water molecules (hydration) was measured. The hydration vs. melting temperature curve has informed us on the bonding character between the protein surfaces and water molecules. The generally used local field fluctuation model and the BPP theory were applied in the interpretation, and the limits of the models were concluded. The torsional properties of DNA play an important role in cellular processes such as transcription, replication, and repair. To access these properties, a number of single-molecule techniques such as magnetic tweezers have been developed to apply torque to DNA and coil it. I will briefly refer to investigations of DNA-protein interactions using these techniques, and describe what has been learnt. I will then focus on the development of novel magnetic techniques that go beyond standard magnetic tweezers, such as the magnetic torque tweezers 1 and the freely-orbiting magnetic tweezers 2 . These approaches allow one to quantify conjugate variables such as twist and torque. For example, the magnetic torque tweezers rely on high-resolution tracking of the position and rotation angle of magnetic particles in a low stiffness angular clamp. We demonstrate the experimental implementation of this technique and the resolution of the angular tracking. Subsequently, we employ this technique to measure the torsional stiffness C of both dsDNA molecules and RecA heteroduplex filaments. Lastly, I will describe novel applications of the optical torque wrench 3, 4 . The optical torque wrench is a laser trapping technique developed at Cornell capable of applying and directly measuring torque on microscopic birefringent particles via spin momentum transfer. We have focused on the angular dynamics of the trapped birefringent particle 4 , demonstrating its excitability in the vicinity of a critical point. This links the optical torque wrench to non-linear dynamical systems such as neuronal and cardiovascular tissues, non-linear optics and chemical reactions, which all display an excitable binary ('all-or-none') response to input perturbations. Based on this dynamical feature, we devise a conceptually novel sensing technique capable of detecting single perturbation events with high signal-to-noise ratio and continuously adjustable sensitivity.For the first time we report a comparative approach based on surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and Raman spectroscopy to study different types of haemoglobin molecules in living erythrocytes. In erythrocytes there are two fractions of haemoglobin: cytosolic (Hb c ) and membranebound (Hb m ). The concentration of Hb m is less then 0,5% and therefore it is impossible to study Hb m with traditional optical techniques. Modifications of cellular membrane can affect conformation of Hb m . Therefore, it can be used as a sensitive marker of pathologies. Firstly, we investigated enhancement of SERS signal of Hb m depending on Ag nanoparticles' size. We found that the intensity of SERS spectra of Hb m and enhancement factor increase with the decrease in Ag nanoparticles' size. Secondly, we investigated the dependence of haemoporphyrin conformation in both Hb c and Hb m ion pH values. We observed different sensitivity of Hb c and Hb m to the pH and found that conformational movements of haemoporphyrin (vibrations of pyrrol rings and side radicals) in Hb m are sterically hampered comparably with Hb c . Our observation is an evidence of a benefit of application of surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy to investigate properties of the Hb m in erythrocytes and provide new information about conformational changes and functional properties of Hb m . RNA nanotechnology is an emerging field with high potential for nanomedicine applications. However, the prediction of RNA three-dimensional nanostructure assembly is still a challenging task that requires a thorough understanding the rules that govern molecular folding on a rough energy landscape. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the free energy landscape of the human mitochondrial tRNA Lys , which possesses two different folded states in addition to the unfolded one. We have quantitatively analyzed the degree of RNA tertiary structure stabilization, firstly, for different types of cations, 1 and, secondly, for several naturally-occurring nucleotide modifications in the structural core of the tRNA Lys . 2,3 Thus, notable variations in the RNA binding specificity was observed for the divalent ions of Mg 2? , Ca 2? and Mn 2? , that can be attributed to their sizes and coordination properties to specific ligands. Furthermore, we observed that the presence of m 2 G10 modification together with the principal stabilizing m 1 A9 modification facilitates the RNA folding into the biologically functional cloverleaf shape to a larger extent than the sum of individual contributions of these modifications. In order to elucidate the mechanism of the recognition, we used diffracted X-ray tracking method (DXT) that monitors real-time movements of individual proteins in solution at the single-molecule level. We found that peptides move distinctly from I-A k , and the rotational motions of peptides correlate with the type B T cell activation. In the case of diabetogenic I-A g7 , immediately after peptide exchange, all the peptides moves magnificently but the motion ceased in a week, then new ordered motion appears; the rotational motion of peptides correlate to T cell activation, which is analogous to the peptide in I-A k . The rotational motion of peptides may create transient conformation of peptide/MHC that recognized by a population of T cells. DXT measurement of peptide/MHC complex well correlated to other biological phenomenon too. Our finding is the first observation that fluctuations at the level of Brownian motion affect to the functions of proteins.Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) is an excellent model for the analysis of retrovirus assembly and maturation. However, neither the structure of the viral RNA, nor its modulation by capsid-protein binding are exactly known. To explore the structure of the MPMV genome, here we manipulated individual molecules of its packaging signal sequence with optical tweezers. The 207-base-long segment of MPMV RNA corresponding to the packaging signal, extended on each side with 1200-base-long indifferent gene segments for use as molecular handles, was cloned into a pET22b vector. RNA was synthesized in an in vitro transcription system. RNA/ DNA handles were obtained by hybridization in a PCR with complementary DNA initiated with primers labeled with either digoxigenin or biotin. The complex was manipulated in repetitive stretch and relaxation cycles across a force range of 0-70 pN. During stretch, transition occurred which increased the RNA chain length and likely corresponds to unfolding. The length gain associated with the unfolding steps distributed across three main peaks at *13, 20, 32 nm, corresponding to *35, 57, 85 bases, respectively. Often reverse transitions were observed during mechanical relaxation, indicating that refolding against force proceeds in a quasi-equilibrium process.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 168, "end": 171, "text": "1 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2393, "end": 2395, "text": "3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2396, "end": 2397, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-666"}, {"text": "Structural investigation of GPCR transmembrane signaling by use of nanobodies Jan Steyaert 1,2 1 Structural Biology Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Pleinlaan 2, 1050 Brussel, Belgium, 2 Department of Structural Biology, VIB, Pleinlaan 2, 1050 Brussel, BelgiumIn 1993, scientists at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel discovered the occurence of bona fide antibodies devoid of light chains in Camelidae.

By using highly specific orthogonal posttranslational labelling approaches combined with TIRF-microscopy we probed the spatio-temporal dynamics of receptor diffusion and interaction in the plasma membrane of live cells on the single molecule level. For this purpose, we employed posttranslational labelling with photostable organic fluorophores. This allowed us to map diffusion and lateral distribution of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 with very high spatial and temporal resolution by using single particle tracking (SPT) and single molecule localization imaging. Observed events of ''transient confinement'' and co-localization with the membrane-proximal actin-meshwork suggest partitioning of IFNAR1/2 in specialized microcompartments. This will be investigated in terms influence on receptor assembly and recruitment of cytoplasmic effector proteins.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-713"}, {"text": "Cytoplasmic dynein moves through uncoordinated action of the AAA1 ring domains Ahmet Yildiz Department of Physics, and Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA Cytoplasmic dynein is a homodimeric AAA? motor that moves processively toward the microtubule minus end. The mechanism by which the two catalytic head domains interact and move relative to each other remains unresolved. By tracking the positions of both heads at nanometer resolution, we found that the heads remain widely separated and move independently along the microtubule, a mechanism different from that of kinesin and myosin. The direction and size of steps vary as a function of interhead separation. Dynein processivity is maintained with only one active head, which drags its inactive partner head forward. These results challenge established views of motor processivity and show that dynein is a unique motor that moves without strictly coordinating the mechanochemical cycles of its two heads.O-715 Self-controlled monofunctionalization of quantum dots and their applicaitons in studying protein-protein interaction in live cells Changjiang You, Stephan Wilmes, Sara Loechte, Oliver Beutel, Domenik Lisse, Christian Paolo Richter, and Jacob Piehler Universit\u00e4 t Osnabr\u00fc ck, Fachbereich Biologie, Barbarastrasse 11, 49076 Osnabr\u00fc ck, GermanyIndividual proteins labeled with semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots, QD) greatly facilitate studying protein-protein interactions with ultrahigh spatial and temporal resolution. Multiplex single molecule tracking and imaging require monovalent quantum dots (mvQD) capable of orthogonally labeling proteins with high yield. For this purpose, we prepared monovalance QD-trisNTA by a chemical conjugation method. Our results indicated that monovalent QD-trisNTA was obtained in high yield by restricting the coupling by means of electrostatic repulsion. Monovalent functionalization of the QD-trisNTA was confirmed by assays in vitro and in vivo. Two-color QD tracking of interferon receptors IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 based on mvQD-trisNTA were realized on live cell [1] .To broaden the multiplex toolbox of mvQDs, we extended the electrostatic-repulsion induced self-control concept for mono-functionalizing quantum dots with different affinity moieties. As a first instance, we used negatively-charged biotin peptide to produce QD with biotin mono-functionalization. We confirmed our approach was a general method to rend QD monovalent by single molecule assays based on stepwise photobleaching. These mvQDs facilitate obtaining spatiotemporal information of IFNARs' organization in live cells. By orthogonal labeling U5A cells stably expressing IFNAR2 at low level with biotin mvQD and mvQD-trisNTA-IFN, we verified colocalization and colocomotion of individual IFN and IFNAR2 at minute scale. Combined with super-resolution imaging of IFNARs' cytosolic effecter STAT2, we observed the dynamic coming-and-going contact between the microcompartments of IFNAR2 and STAT2.A micron sized viscometer was fabricated using the Couette type geometry that is capable of measuring the complex viscosity of fluids. The viscometer was produced by two photon polymerization of SU8 photopolymer using a femtosecond laser system, a high NA objective and a piezo translator stage. The viscometer was manipulated by holographic optical tweezers and operated in the 0.005-1 Hz frequency range. Video analysis algorithm was used to evaluate our measurements. We tested the viscometer with water-glycerol solutions. One of the main reasons for lack of reliability in protein analysis for disease diagnostics or monitoring is a lack of test sensitivity. This is because, for many tests, to be reliable, they need to be performed on a homogeneous, and therefore very small, sample. Current in-vitro techniques fail in accurately identifying small differences in protein content, function and interactions starting from samples constituted of few or even single cells. A nanotechnology approach may overcome the current limits in low abundance protein detection. We aim at designing a microwell device for the trapping (in native environment) and the parallel characterization of rare cells (e.g. adult stem cells). Such versatile device, based on soft and nanolithography, will promote cell adhesion and viability on differently functionalized bio-compatible materials, allowing for the morphological characterization of the cells, at a single cell level. In parallel, by facing our microwell device with a protein nanoarray, produced via atomic force microscopy nanolithography, we can run proteomic studies at a single/few cells level. Moreover, we could foresee the possibility to deliver different stimuli to each cell, correlating the changes in chemistry/ morphology with the protein profile at a single cell level. Using an electrophysiological assay the activity of NhaA was tested in a wide pH range from pH 5.0 to 9.5. Forward and reverse transport directions were investigated at zero membrane potential using preparations with inside out and right side out oriented transporters with Na ? or H ? gradients as the driving force. Under symmetrical pH conditions with a Na ? gradient for activation, both the wt and the pH-shifted G338S variant exhibit highly symmetrical transport activity with bell shaped pH dependencies, but the optimal pH was shifted 1.8 pH units to the acidic range in the variant. In both strains the pH dependence was associated with a systematic increase of the K m for Na ? at acidic pH. Under symmetrical Na ? concentration with a pH gradient for NhaA activation an unexpected novel characteristic of the antiporter was revealed; rather than being down regulated it remained active even at pH as low as 5. These data allowed to advance a transport mechanism based on competing Na ? and H ? binding to a common transport site and to develop a kinetic model quantitatively explaining the experimental results. In support of these results both alkaline pH and Na ? induce the conformational change of NhaA associated with NhaA cation translocation as demonstrated here by trypsin digestion. Furthermore, Na ? translocation was found to be associated with the displacement of a negative charge. In conclusion, the electrophysiological assay allowed to reveal the mechanism of NhaA antiport and sheds new light on the concept of NhaA pH regulation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2126, "end": 2129, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O-714"}, {"text": "Swimming motility is widespread among bacteria.

Especially an effective accumulation of nanoparticles inside certain tissues is beneficial for a great number of applications. Predominantly size, shape and surface charge of nanoparticles influence their cellular internalization and distribution. To investigate this, two series of maghemite (c-Fe 2 O 3 ) nanoparticles were synthesized either via aqueous coprecipitation or via thermal decomposition of organometallic precursor molecules. Size and the spherical shape of both nanoparticle types were kept constant whereas the charge was changed by modifying the surface of the nanoparticles with polymers of opposite charge, in detail poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) and a polymaleic anhydride derivative (PMA). The positively and negatively charged c-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles were characterized with respect to size, zeta potential, colloidal stability and magnetic properties. Furthermore, the uptake rate and localization of both formulations into A549 carcinoma cells after fluorescent labeling of the carriers as well as the resulting alteration in MR-relaxation times were evaluated. Membrane proteins are the target of more than 50% of all drugs and are encoded by about 30% of the human genome. Electrophysiological techniques, like patch-clamp, unravelled many functional aspects of membrane proteins but usually suffer from poor structural sensitivity. We have developed Surface Enhanced Infrared Difference Absorption Spectroscopy (SEIDAS) 1,2 to probe potential-induced structural changes of a protein on the level of a monolayer. A novel concept is introduced to incorporate membrane proteins into solid supported lipid bilayers in an orientated manner via the affinity of the His-tag to the Ni-NTA terminated gold surface 3 . Full functionality of surface-tethered cytochrome c oxidase is demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry after binding of the natural electron donor cytochrome c. General applicability of the methodological approach is shown by tethering photosystem II to the gold surface 4 . In conjunction with hydrogenase, the basis is set towards a biomimetic system for H 2 -production. Recently, we succeeded to record IR difference spectra of a monolayer of sensory rhodopsin II under voltage-clamp conditions 5 . This approach opens an avenue towards mechanistic studies of voltage-gated ion channels with unprecedented structural and temporal sensitivity.

The unspecific deposition of biomass onto the adsorbent matrix can severely affect the process performance, leading to a poor system hydrodynamics which then decreases the success of this unit operation. To quantify the bead-biomass interactions different chromatographic beads are attached to AFM cantilevers, and force spectroscopy experiments are performed with these colloidal probes on model surfaces and cells in solution. The experiments are conducted under varying conditions to study Uncovering physiological processes at the cellular level is essential in order to study complex brain mechanisms. Using multisite signal recording techniques in the extracellular space, functional connectivity between different brain areas can be revealed. A novel microfabrication process flow, based on the combination of wet chemical etching methods was developed, which yields highly reproducible and mechanically robust silicon-based multielectrode devices. The fabricated shaft of the probe is 280 lm wide, 80 lm thick, has rounded edges and ends in a yacht-bow like, sharp tip. Its unique shape provides decreased invasivity. The sensor contains 24 platinum recording sites at precisely defined locations. Murine in vivo experiments showed that the probes could easily penetrate the meninges. High quality signals, providing local field potential, multi-and single unit activities, were recorded. The interfaces between the tissue and the platinum contacts were further improved by electrochemical etching and carbon nanotube coating of the metal sites. The integrated optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer is a highly sensitive device, considered a powerful lab-on-a-chip tool for specific detection of various chemical and biochemical reactions. Despite its advantages, there is no commercially available biosensor based on this technique. The main reason is the inherent instability of the device due to slight changes of environmental parameters. In this paper we offer a solution to this problem that enables the optimal adjustment of the working point of the sensor prior to the measurement. The key feature is a control unit made of a thin film of the lightsensitive chromoprotein bacteriorhodopsin deposited on the reference arm of the interferometer. After showing the transfer characteristics of such a device, we demonstrate its applicability to sensing of specific protein-protein interactions. We expect our method to become a rapid and cost-efficientThe combination of unconventional fabrication technology and biomaterials allows both to realize state-of-the-art devices with highly controlled lateral features and performances and to study the main properties of the biomolecules themselves by operating at a scale level comparable with the one crucial for their activity. Soft lithography and microfluidic devices offer a tool-box both to study biomolecules under highly confined environments [1] and to fabricate in an easy way topographic features with locally controlled mechanical and chemical surface properties, thus leading to a finer control of the interplay of mechanics and chemistry. I will present an application of this technology to the control of cell fate that is becoming a key issue in regenerative medicine in the perspective of generating novel artificial tissues. Patterns of Extracellular Matrix (ECM) proteins have been fabricated, by a modified Lithographically Controlled Wetting (LCW), on the highly antifouling surface of Teflon-AF to guide the adhesion, growth and differentiation of neural cells (SHSY5Y, 1321N1, NE-4C) achieving an extremely accurate guidance [2] . Local surface topography is also known to influence the cell fate [3] , thus, integrating this parameter in the substrate fabrication could increase the complexity of the signals supplied to the cells. In this perspective we have developed a novel fabrication technique, named Lithographically controlled Etching (LCE), allowing, in one step, to engrave and to functionalize the substrate surface over different lengthscales and with different functionalities. I will conclude showing how we have been developing ultrathin film organic field effect transistors (OFETs) as label-free biological transducers and sensors of biological systems. OFETs are low dimensional devices where ordered conjugated molecules act as charge transport material. Unconventional patterning techniques and microfluidics have been adapted to proteins and nucleic acids to dose the molecules on the OFET channel with a high control of the concentration. In another set of experiments, we have also been addressing the signalling from neural cells and networks grown on pentacene ultra-thin film transistosr [3, 4] .Advances in nanotechnology are beginning to exert a significant impact in medicine. Increasing use of nanomaterials in treatment of diseases has raised concerns about their potential risks to human health. In our study, the effect of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) nanoparticles (NPs) on function of B-and T-lymphocytes was investigated in vitro. Human blood cultures were treated with PLGA and TiO 2 NPs in concentrations: 0.12; 3 and 75 lg/cm 2 for 72h. Lymphocyte transformation assay was used to assess the effect of NPs on lymphocyte function. Lymphocytes were stimulated with mitogens: concanavalin A, phytohaemmagglutinin (T-cell response) and pokeweed mitogen (B-cell response). Our findings indicate immunomodulatory effect of PLGA NPs. Proliferative response of T-and B-lymphocytes exposed in vitro to the highest dose of PLGA for 72h was suppressed significantly (p\\0.01, p\\0.05). On the other hand, we observed stimulative effect of exposure to middle dose of PLGA NPs on B-lymphocyte proliferation (p\\0.05). No alteration was found in lymphocyte proliferation treated in vitro with TiO 2 NPs for 72h. In conclusion, proliferation of lymphocytes in vitro might be one of the relevant tests for evaluation of NPs immunotoxicity.Embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation in specific cell lineage is still a major challenge in regenerative medicine. Differentiation is usually achieved by using biochemical factors (BF) which concentration and sides effects are not completely understood. Therefore, we produced patterns in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) consisting of groove and pillar arrays of sub-micrometric lateral resolution as substrates for cell cultures. We analyzed the effect of different nanostructures on differentiation of ES-derived neuronal precursors into neuronal lineage without adding biochemical factors. Neuronal precursors adhere on PDMS more effectively than on glass coverslips but the elastomeric material itself doesn't enhance neuronal differentiation. Nano-pillars increase both precursors differentiation and survival with respect to grooves. We demonstrated that neuronal yield was enhanced by increasing pillars height from 35 to 400 nm. On higher pillar neuronal differentiation reaches *80% 96 hours after plating and the largest differentiation enhancement of pillars over flat PDMS was observed during the first 6 hours of culture. We conclude that PDMS nanopillars accelerate and increase neuronal differentiation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3345, "end": 3348, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4042, "end": 4045, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4114, "end": 4117, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5132, "end": 5135, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5136, "end": 5138, "text": "4]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-731"}]}
