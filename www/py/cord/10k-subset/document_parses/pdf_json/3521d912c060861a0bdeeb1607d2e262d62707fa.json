Data showed that the cell lines stably expressed TMPRSS2 and MSPL after 20 serial passages. Both MDCK-TMPRSS2 and MDCK-MSPL could proteolytically cleave the HA of Re-5, Re-6, and Re-9 and supported high-titer growth of the vaccine without exogenous trypsin. Re-5, Re-6, and Re-9 efficiently infected and replicated within MDCK-TMPRSS2 and MDCK-MSPL cells and viral titer were comparable to the virus grown in MDCK cells with TPCKtrypsin. Thus, our results indicate a potential application for these cell lines in cell-based influenza vaccine production and may serve as a useful tool for HA proteolytic cleavage-related studies.",

            "text": "Hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus mediates both receptor binding and membrane fusion [10] . HA cleavage is important for viral infectivity; HA proteins are synthesized as HA0 precursor proteins during transport through the Golgi apparatus. HA0 is cleaved by host cell protease into HA1 and HA2 subunits [11, 12] . Cleaved HA proteins bind to cell receptor and then are endocytosed into the endosome where they undergo conformational changes and exposure of fusion peptide on HA2 subunit under low pH. Then, the fusion peptide is inserted into the cell membrane and mediates the formation of fusion pore [13, 14] . Fusion relies on precise HA0 cleavage for a fusion-capable HA2 subunit. HA proteins of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) have multibasic cleavage sites (R-X-R/K-R) which can be cleaved by ubiquitously expressed furin or PC5/6 protease to cause fatal systemic infections [15] [16] [17] . HA of most of the other mammalian and avian influenza viruses contains a single arginine (or lysine) at the cleavage site, so cleavage of these HAs is restricted to the respiratory tract in mammals and to the respiratory and intestinal tracts in avians and assumed to be processed extracellularly by trypsin-like proteases. Of these proteases, some type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) family members such as human airway trypsinlike (HAT) protease, transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), transmembrane protease, serine 4 (TMPRSS4), and mosaic serine protease large form (MSPL) play important roles in influenza viral infection. TTSPs are expressed in the airways and can cleave multiple strains of influenza HA protein. B\u00f6ttcher and colleagues reported a cell-associated cleavage of influenza viruses HA with a monobasic cleavage site by HAT and TMPRSS2 [18] . Wang and colleagues reported that TMPRSS2 and HAT could cleave the HA of the H1, H3, and H5 subtypes [19] . Zmora and colleagues demonstrated that mosaic serine protease large form (MSPL)could activate HA protein of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza virus [20] , while Okumura and colleagues confirmed that MSPL can cleave the HA protein of H5 HPAIV and support their multicycle replication [21] .",

Their results showed that the cell lines can support multicycle replication of human H2 and H3 influenza viruses without trypsin. Different from their inducible cell lines, the cell lines we established consistently expressed TMPRSS2 or MSPL. Unexpectedly, permanent expression of these proteases was not toxic to the cells and both cell lines could be serially passaged for at least 20 passages. Even though these cells grew slightly slower than MDCK cells, when they grew to the suitable confluence for infection, the viral titer was comparable to the MDCK cells plus exogenous trypsin. Since Re-5, Re-6, and Re-9 are commercial inactivated AIV vaccines in China, we speculate that the cell lines could be applied in the large scale vaccine production in the future. They may also simplify the related researches or industrial applications to meet diverse demands.",

Cells were infected with Re-5, Re-6, and Re-9 at MOI = 0.01 for 1 h at 37 \u2218 C. Inoculum was removed and cells were washed 3 times and placed in DMEM with 5% FBS. 36 h after incubation, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. Infected cells were detected with chicken anti-Re-5, anti-Re-6, and anti-Re-9 as primary antibodies and TRITC-labeled goat anti-chicken IgG (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) as secondary antibody. Stained cells were observed under a Zeiss Axioscop (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) fluorescent microscope.2.6. Viral Titration. MDCK-TMPRSS2, MDCK-MSPL, and MDCK cells were seeded in 6-well plates and grown in DMEM containing 5% FBS for 24 h. Cells were infected with Re-5, Re-6, and Re-9 at MOI = 0.01 in DMEM for 1 h at 37 \u2218 C. Inoculum was removed and cells were washed 3 times after which DMEM with 5% FBS was added. TPCK-treated trypsin (1 g/mL) was added to media of infected MDCK cells. 100 L supernatant from each infected cell culture was sampled at 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after infection. Sample TCID 50 values were determined, and growth kinetics for each virus from each cell line were obtained. Statistical analysis (t-test) was carried out by Excel software (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) for each virus between MDCK-TMPRSS2, MDCK-MSPL, MDCK + TPCK, and MDCK infection groups at the same time point.",
