The severity of the clinical status, ranging from sepsis to severe sepsis to septic shock, depends on the virulence of the pathogen, the use of appropriate antibiotherapy, underlying diseases, and genetic polymorphisms. The frequency and mortality of sepsis in intensive care units are still high. During sepsis, enhanced levels of numerous makers can be detected in the bloodstream as a testimony of the systemic inflammatory response. Usually, the highest levels of these markers correlate with the poorest outcome; however, this correlation does not prove that they are the active mediators responsible for sepsis syndromes. This review focuses on mediators rather than markers. Experiments with neutralizing agents (ie, antibodies, antagonists, drugs) or the use of transgenic or gene-targeted mice (either overexpressing the molecule or knockout [KO] for the gene of a given mediator or its receptor) have helped to define the involvement of each individual molecule in the occurrence of sepsis syndromes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 914, "end": 918, "text": "[KO]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The complement system plays a pivotal role during sepsis.

Both pro-and anti-inflammatory properties have been attributed to C3a [1] . Anaphylatoxin C5a favors the synthesis and release of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1 , IL-6, and IL-8 from human leukocytes [2] , and it can enhance phagocytosis, induce oxidative burst, and favor the release of granular enzymes from neutrophils. In the lung, C5a enhances inflammatory response, particularly by its action on alveolar epithelial cells. C5a has also been found to be a vasodilator, to enhance the expression of adhesion molecules, and to activate the coagulation system. Furthermore, C5a has a major role in cardiac dysfunction during sepsis, participating in septic cardiomyopathy [3\u2022] . Excessive production of C5a may compromise the host defenses, and high levels of plasma C5a in sepsis patients correlate with poor outcome [4\u2022\u2022] . In some models of shock, C5-deficient animals are more resistant to the effects of TNF and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) infusions than controls. Studies of sepsis in animal models have shown that blockade of C5a attenuates physiologic perturbations and prevents the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure. After cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), a model of peritonitis and sepsis, an increased expression of C5a receptor occurs in most tissues including lungs, liver, kidneys, and heart.

Factor VII strongly colocalizes with tissue factor, which correlates with fibrin deposition, mainly at the vascular bifurcations.

IL-1Ra-deficient mice are highly susceptible to endotoxin-induced death, and conversely, mice that overexpress IL-1Ra are relatively protected. Unfortunately, human trials have failed to find any beneficial effects for IL-1Ra. IL-6 is probably one of the best markers of severity. It induces the release of cortisol, IL-10, IL-1Ra, and acute-phase proteins. Accordingly, it can be considered an anti-inflammatory cytokine. However, IL-6 also possesses some proinflammatory properties, as illustrated by its role in myocardial depression [52] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 181, "end": 185, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1440, "end": 1444, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Anti-inflammatory Mediators"}, {"text": "Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 is induced by IL-10 and plays a protective role against oxidative stress.

Numerous animal models have allowed the identification of the mediators contributing to the deleterious effects observed during sepsis. However, caution should be exercised, because the nature of the experimental model greatly influences the conclusions. Despite positive results in animal models, the therapeutic targeting of these mediators has been extremely disappointing in human settings. This disappointment does not mean that they are not involved in the syndromes associated with human sepsis. Indeed, because of the tremendous synergy that exists between all these mediators, the strategy of targeting one only molecule appears a bit too simplistic. On the other hand, the regulatory anti-inflammatory mediators may jeopardize the patient to a second infection.
