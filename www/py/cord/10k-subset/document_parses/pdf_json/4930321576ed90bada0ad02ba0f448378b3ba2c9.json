Ohjeetive To compare the efficacy of inhaled and intranasal sodium cromoglyeate and matching placebos on the symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections. Methods Adult subjects with symptom.s of runny nose, throat pain, or cough for less than 24 h were recruited. They were treated for 7 days using a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, group cotnparative design. The medication given was: sodium cromoglyeate dry powder 20 mg per inhalation in spineaps; sodium cromoglyeate aqueous nasal spray delivering 5.2 mg per dose; or matching placebo as dry powder and nasal spray. One spincap and one spray per nostril were taken every 2h during waking hours on days I and 2 and then four times daily on days 3-7. Severity of nine symptoms (general malaise, body aches and pains, chills and shivering, snce/ing. nasul running, nasal blocking, sore throat, cough and voice disturbance) wus recorded twice daily by subjects on diary cards, using a scale of 0 (absent) to 3 (severe). Re.'iults The sludy was conducted between February and April 1993. One hundred and eighteen patients aged 21-63 years (mean 41 years) were included. Symptoms resolved faster (/*< 0.001) and the severity in the last three days of treatment was significantly less in patients treated with sodium cromoglyeate than with placebo (P<0.05-&dy 5; P<O.O\\-&Ay 6; /'<0.001-day 7). Side-efiects were local and mild atid did not differ between the treatment groups.

An interpretation of this eff\"ect is that the drug down-regulates neurological reflexes that have been enhanced in the case of asthma by exposure to antigen.
